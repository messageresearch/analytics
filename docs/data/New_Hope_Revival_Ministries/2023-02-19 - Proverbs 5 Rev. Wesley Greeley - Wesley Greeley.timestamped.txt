[1:30:37] is is
[1:30:39] singing himself
[1:30:42] but we are blessed to have a marvelous
[1:30:47] worship leader in Benjamin Shelley
[1:30:50] who gives everything as he's leading
[1:30:53] worship and we have a group of people
[1:30:57] that have heard the word of the Lord
[1:30:59] through a pastor that wants people to
[1:31:02] move
[1:31:03] to dance to kneel to lift their hands to
[1:31:06] clap their hands to stomp their feet to
[1:31:10] just move about worshiping the Lord and
[1:31:13] you have responded to that and you can
[1:31:15] continue to respond to that and it helps
[1:31:18] to create the atmosphere in the house of
[1:31:21] the Lord
[1:31:22] I bring you greetings from Brother
[1:31:24] Shelley the stream was not behaving on

[1:31:29] that I know of that even got to see the
[1:31:32] stream but uh most people could not see
[1:31:35] it but he said he thought that that made
[1:31:37] him miss us even more but he sends his
[1:31:40] love from him and his family to all of
[1:31:42] us and I believe they're watching today
[1:31:45] and so we send our love and greetings
[1:31:47] back to them in Florida they're watching
[1:31:49] this service and we just want to tell
[1:31:51] them how much we love them and miss them

[1:32:25] and bow thine ear to my understanding
[1:32:29] that thou mayest regard discretion
[1:32:33] and that thy lips may keep knowledge
[1:32:38] for the lips of a strange woman drop as
[1:32:42] in honeycomb
[1:32:44] and her mouth is smoother than oil
[1:32:48] but her end is bitter as wormwood she
[1:32:52] sharp as a two-edged sword
[1:32:56] her feet go down to death
[1:32:59] her steps take hold on hell
[1:33:04] lest thou shouldest Ponder the path of
[1:33:07] life
[1:33:09] her ways are movable
[1:33:12] that thou canst not know them
[1:33:15] hear me now therefore o you children and
[1:33:18] depart not from the words of my mouth
[1:33:21] remove thy way far from her and come not
[1:33:25] nigh the door of her house
[1:33:28] lest thou give thine honor unto others
[1:33:32] and thy years unto the cruel lest
[1:33:36] strangers be filled with thy wealth and
[1:33:39] thy labors be in the house of a stranger
[1:33:42] and They Mourn at the last when thy
[1:33:46] flesh and thy body are consumed
[1:33:49] and say
[1:33:51] how have I hated instruction and my
[1:33:54] heart despised reproof
[1:33:58] and have not obeyed the voice of my
[1:34:01] teachers nor incline my ear to them that
[1:34:05] instructed me
[1:34:07] I was almost in all evil in the midst of
[1:34:10] the congregation and the assembly I'll
[1:34:12] conclude reading right there for today
[1:34:14] May the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:34:17] reading of his word you may have your
[1:34:20] seats
[1:34:28] now if you've been around for very long
[1:34:32] you will know that
[1:34:35] Solomon
[1:34:37] had a problem with women
[1:34:42] Solomon being the son of
[1:34:45] David and Bathsheba
[1:34:51] and you think about all of the
[1:34:54] course of events
[1:34:57] that came up to the day of Solomon
[1:35:02] how that David although he had
[1:35:07] the Bible tells us that he was a man
[1:35:09] after God's Own Heart
[1:35:12] there was something in David that he was
[1:35:15] a worshiper
[1:35:16] and he wanted to please the Lord with
[1:35:20] everything that was within him
[1:35:23] and
[1:35:25] the scripture tells us that
[1:35:29] as was normal for Kings they went out in
[1:35:33] the spring to fight their battles and
[1:35:36] there was one particular spring that
[1:35:40] David decided that he was not going to
[1:35:44] go out to battle but he was going to
[1:35:46] stay at home and let others fight the
[1:35:48] battle for him
[1:35:50] might I say to any of us
[1:35:55] whether we be young middle-aged or feel
[1:35:58] like we're old there is nobody that can
[1:36:01] fight the battle like you can fight the
[1:36:03] battle
[1:36:06] God has put a sword in your hand to
[1:36:10] wield and to fight the enemy and even if
[1:36:13] you feel like that you can't fight like
[1:36:16] somebody else can fight God gave you the
[1:36:20] sword of the word of God to defend your
[1:36:23] little parcel of ground however large it
[1:36:26] may be as we heard a few weeks ago that
[1:36:30] God wants us to defend what is ours he
[1:36:34] doesn't want us to stand back and expect
[1:36:36] somebody else to defend it for us he
[1:36:39] wants us to fight with everything that's
[1:36:42] within us
[1:36:43] but on this particular spring David
[1:36:46] decided that he was not going to go into
[1:36:48] battle he was going to let someone else
[1:36:51] go into battle and he was going to sit
[1:36:53] at home and he was going to stay in his
[1:36:56] kingly chair perhaps and he was going to
[1:36:58] just take it easy this season but that
[1:37:01] was not what God wanted him to do God it
[1:37:05] was ordained that he should be in the
[1:37:07] battle with the rest of them how bad he
[1:37:10] was at home and and as he's home he
[1:37:14] begins to uh probably get a little bored
[1:37:18] because he knew that his men were out
[1:37:21] fighting for for the kingdom and he was
[1:37:24] at home and his eye got to roving
[1:37:29] huh
[1:37:31] because he had a lot of idleness on his
[1:37:34] hand
[1:37:36] and he wasn't fighting the battle
[1:37:41] read between the lines friends
[1:37:45] when we're not fighting the battle
[1:37:47] we allow our mind to become Idol
[1:37:52] we look for other things to entertain us
[1:37:56] David was looking for something else to
[1:37:58] entertain him
[1:38:00] he found a woman
[1:38:03] was of no fault of hers
[1:38:06] but he was looking
[1:38:08] and Bathsheba was brought to his house
[1:38:10] and the through the course of events
[1:38:13] she became expected and then he brought
[1:38:16] her husband home and tried to make it
[1:38:19] till that he could have time with his
[1:38:21] wife so it would look like it was his
[1:38:23] child and so on and so on and things
[1:38:25] spiraled out of control and it ended up
[1:38:29] that he had to have Uriah killed to try
[1:38:31] to cover his sin and you and I will do
[1:38:34] the same thing if we allow ourselves to
[1:38:37] have this roving eye we're going to look
[1:38:39] for excuses and we're going to try to
[1:38:41] cover our sin David is recognizing now
[1:38:45] that he's got trouble on his hand and he
[1:38:47] has Uriah killed and uh he see he has
[1:38:51] Uriah put in the Forefront of the battle
[1:38:53] and has him killed the child that
[1:38:56] Bathsheba was carrying was David's child
[1:38:58] and that child died
[1:39:01] how big God gave her another child by
[1:39:05] the name of Solomon and Solomon was
[1:39:09] David said that he would sit on the
[1:39:12] throne
[1:39:13] came time as he grew up David was
[1:39:17] getting old and it looked like somebody
[1:39:19] was going to usurp the throne and
[1:39:22] bathshebus came to David and said you
[1:39:24] told me that Solomon was going to sit on
[1:39:27] the throne and David made that happen
[1:39:29] now Solomon was a young man so Solomon
[1:39:33] did not have to go out and fight battles
[1:39:35] like David did
[1:39:37] everything was
[1:39:39] taken care of for Solomon but Solomon he
[1:39:43] loved women
[1:39:45] and I don't know exactly how it all
[1:39:48] started perhaps there was some DNA that
[1:39:52] God passed down to him from David I do
[1:39:55] not know that but we do not see although
[1:39:58] that Solomon was a man of great wisdom
[1:40:02] the Bible tells us he asked the Lord for
[1:40:05] wisdom and God granted to him this gift
[1:40:09] of wisdom because you have not asked for
[1:40:11] this or asked for that to promote
[1:40:13] yourself I'm giving you this gift of
[1:40:16] wisdom
[1:40:17] but it doesn't appear that Solomon had
[1:40:22] the same Heart of Worship as his father
[1:40:25] David
[1:40:28] and as Solomon began to grow and
[1:40:31] understand that this kingdom was on his
[1:40:35] shoulders Solomon he saw that the people
[1:40:39] were coming to him because they wanted
[1:40:42] to see the wisdom that Solomon had
[1:40:46] they wanted his gift
[1:40:49] oh
[1:40:51] they had questions in their minds and
[1:40:54] they wanted his gift and their asker
[1:40:57] coming to him traveling from miles
[1:40:59] around asking him wanting to know about
[1:41:02] this or that to understand what is the
[1:41:07] meaning of this in my life and Solomon
[1:41:10] began to gain notoriety throughout the
[1:41:13] whole Earth
[1:41:15] because of his wisdom
[1:41:18] wisdom
[1:41:20] that was unsurpassed
[1:41:22] because it came from the hand of God
[1:41:26] but as he
[1:41:27] has this gift
[1:41:30] it was a gift from God
[1:41:34] it was a gift from God that God allowed
[1:41:38] Solomon to use
[1:41:41] but it did not keep Solomon
[1:41:46] to have a heart like his father had
[1:41:51] gifts and callings the Bible tells us
[1:41:54] are without repentance
[1:41:59] I'll
[1:42:00] there was something in Solomon that he
[1:42:04] saw what his dad desired to build a
[1:42:08] temple a place of permanent structure so
[1:42:12] that the tent didn't have to be moved
[1:42:14] from place to place and Solomon desired
[1:42:17] to get that built and there was great
[1:42:19] wealth that came into the kingdom and
[1:42:22] Solomon understood that this was a
[1:42:26] burden that had been laid on him by his
[1:42:29] father to build this and so all of these
[1:42:32] things are being done uh the the temple
[1:42:35] being built and and Solomon is while all
[1:42:38] that is being done Solomon is having
[1:42:40] people come into the kingdom and they're
[1:42:42] bringing wealth into the kingdom and
[1:42:44] it's helping to get the temple built and
[1:42:45] it's building Solomon's coffers the
[1:42:47] King's coffers and Solomon is getting
[1:42:50] more and more attention as time goes
[1:42:54] along but as he goes along he is he is
[1:42:58] to his heart is turned away from the
[1:43:02] things of God to other women
[1:43:06] what's up now
[1:43:07] women
[1:43:10] and these were not women of the House of
[1:43:13] Israel
[1:43:15] these were women of pagan kingdoms all
[1:43:17] around that around the earth they were
[1:43:21] Pagan kingdoms that came to Solomon
[1:43:23] because they wanted to know the wisdom
[1:43:26] and so in order for them to uh make a a
[1:43:31] covenant with Solomon they would give
[1:43:34] wives to Solomon
[1:43:36] and these women brought with them all of
[1:43:40] their idolatries they brought with them
[1:43:43] their their things that they had uh
[1:43:46] worshiping in their country they when
[1:43:49] they came to him all they heard was
[1:43:51] about the wisdom of Solomon they didn't
[1:43:54] really uh they weren't really interested
[1:43:57] in the god of Israel they wanted the
[1:43:59] wisdom of Solomon they wanted their
[1:44:01] questions answered
[1:44:03] similar to what we've had in our day
[1:44:06] they didn't want the truth of the word
[1:44:08] of God they wanted the Loaves and the
[1:44:10] fishes but when God begins to speak and
[1:44:14] say uh they eat my flesh and drink my
[1:44:17] blood many of them walked away
[1:44:21] but there were many of these women that
[1:44:24] were stuck in the Kingdom with Solomon
[1:44:26] and then he housed them and can you just
[1:44:29] imagine you have a home that you live in
[1:44:32] uh you you men with with one wife
[1:44:35] a few children
[1:44:37] one or two or three or four or five or
[1:44:40] ten or however many you have
[1:44:42] one house
[1:44:44] and you think about the cost of that one
[1:44:47] house
[1:44:50] now Solomon as his women the wives the
[1:44:53] concubines are being added to him
[1:44:56] they have to have a hotel to stay in
[1:44:59] have to have a house to live in there's
[1:45:01] got to be Cooks there's got to be people
[1:45:03] that look after them because in that
[1:45:06] kind of a society the women didn't clean
[1:45:09] their own room they didn't fix their own
[1:45:11] hair you know it's it's all done for
[1:45:13] them so all of this expense that is
[1:45:17] being poured into taking care of these
[1:45:19] women that are brought into the kingdom
[1:45:22] for Solomon their gifts to him but all
[1:45:25] of the while Solomon is is turn his
[1:45:29] heart is being turned away from the
[1:45:31] things of the Living God and it's being
[1:45:34] turned toward these women and their
[1:45:36] idolatrous things that they've brought
[1:45:39] with them
[1:45:41] and so Solomon he is he is pondering the
[1:45:45] things of life
[1:45:47] he's thinking about all of these women
[1:45:50] that he has
[1:45:52] and
[1:45:54] he
[1:45:55] begins to speak in such a way vanity of
[1:45:59] vanities it's all vanity and vexation of
[1:46:03] spirit
[1:46:05] because he realizes that these women
[1:46:07] have not brought him the satisfaction
[1:46:09] that he desires
[1:46:11] they've they've not brought to him the
[1:46:15] satisfaction that he needs in the Inner
[1:46:18] Man all they're doing is fulfilling the
[1:46:21] fleshly lusts of of one man
[1:46:26] and Solomon doesn't really know what to
[1:46:28] do with that but as he is as he is
[1:46:32] laying this out in the Proverbs he's
[1:46:36] wanting his son to understand
[1:46:40] that all of these women are not the
[1:46:43] answer to what a man needs and he says
[1:46:47] the lips of a strange woman drop as a
[1:46:52] honeycomb
[1:46:54] and her mouth is smoother than oil
[1:46:59] but her end is bitter as wormwood
[1:47:02] sharp as a two-edged sword her feet go
[1:47:06] down to death her steps take hold on
[1:47:10] hell
[1:47:11] and then in verse 6 he says something
[1:47:13] that kind of grabbed my attention
[1:47:17] lest thou part should Ponder the path of
[1:47:20] life
[1:47:21] her ways are movable that you cannot
[1:47:24] know them
[1:47:26] now
[1:47:30] any of you
[1:47:32] young men that have ever
[1:47:35] looked for a wife or are currently
[1:47:38] looking for a wife
[1:47:42] the brothel is not a place to go to find
[1:47:45] one
[1:47:49] Solomon recognized as he's watching
[1:47:53] these women that have come from other
[1:47:56] cultures from other places that
[1:48:00] have been given to him as concubines or
[1:48:04] as wives however you wish to say it he
[1:48:07] starts recognizing a pattern that that
[1:48:11] if they are not godly that there's going
[1:48:15] to be something about her that's going
[1:48:18] to be seductive that's going to be
[1:48:21] wooing but there's going to be an end
[1:48:23] that is not going to be good
[1:48:26] and he set her lips the lips of a
[1:48:29] strange woman they drop as honeycomb
[1:48:32] well when I think of honeycomb I think
[1:48:35] about something sweet and then I don't
[1:48:39] I've I've never
[1:48:42] been in a position to
[1:48:45] even think like this uh trying to find a
[1:48:48] woman outside of of the Covenant of the
[1:48:51] Lord but Solomon is in this kind of a
[1:48:54] position where he recognizes that a
[1:48:57] strange woman one that is not under the
[1:48:59] Covenant of Israel she has she has
[1:49:02] something that comes out of her mouth
[1:49:04] something that comes through her lips
[1:49:07] that is sweet as honeycomb and she makes
[1:49:10] it sound beautiful
[1:49:14] she makes it sound like you are the most
[1:49:18] handsome man that ever walked the face
[1:49:21] of the Earth there is no one that is
[1:49:24] better than you you have all the
[1:49:26] qualities that she wants and this is the
[1:49:29] sweetness that is coming out of her
[1:49:31] mouth
[1:49:33] but Solomon said her and is bitter
[1:49:37] as wormwood
[1:49:39] sharp as a two-edged sword
[1:49:42] now when I think about a two-edged sword
[1:49:46] I think about Ephesians or rather
[1:49:48] Hebrews 4 12 the word of God is quick
[1:49:52] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:49:54] two-edged sword
[1:50:03] a two-edged sword
[1:50:05] has a sharp edge on both sides
[1:50:10] but this two-edged sword that Solomon is
[1:50:13] talking about
[1:50:16] is not the word of God but it is a word
[1:50:19] that comes out of a mouth of a strange
[1:50:23] woman
[1:50:24] that will cut a man to mince meat when
[1:50:28] she is finished with him
[1:50:41] he goes on to say that her
[1:50:44] feet go down to death her steps hold on
[1:50:47] hell but verse 6 says lest you should
[1:50:50] Ponder the path of life
[1:50:53] let me just stop here just a moment
[1:50:56] a young man
[1:50:58] looking for a wife
[1:51:02] should always think about
[1:51:05] more than the moment
[1:51:11] because
[1:51:12] Beauty
[1:51:14] will fade away
[1:51:18] Beauty
[1:51:19] real true beauty
[1:51:22] it goes much deeper than just the skin
[1:51:25] level
[1:51:30] and a man who is choosing a wife
[1:51:34] one who claims a man who claims to have
[1:51:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he does
[1:51:42] not go outside of a church setting
[1:51:44] looking for a wife nor does a woman go
[1:51:48] outside of a church setting looking for
[1:51:50] a husband because we don't need a we
[1:51:55] don't need a divided household
[1:51:59] but a man when he begins to look for a
[1:52:02] wife when he really is searching
[1:52:06] Solomon is saying be careful
[1:52:10] watch that strange woman you stay away
[1:52:13] from her
[1:52:15] lest you should even Ponder the way of
[1:52:18] life with her
[1:52:22] can I really get along with her
[1:52:25] could I live with her
[1:52:28] she puts on lipstick
[1:52:31] but could I could I could I live with
[1:52:36] that
[1:52:39] she
[1:52:40] puts this stuff all over her eyes
[1:52:43] but
[1:52:45] you know maybe it's not so bad I think I
[1:52:48] maybe I could live with that
[1:52:52] she likes to go down to the bar on
[1:52:54] Saturday night and
[1:52:56] have some drink
[1:52:58] but the rest of the time she's a pretty
[1:53:00] good woman
[1:53:04] maybe I can live with that
[1:53:10] lest he should Ponder the way of life
[1:53:13] with her
[1:53:15] her ways are movable
[1:53:20] this woman
[1:53:23] Solomon is realizing that he has a bunch
[1:53:26] of women and he's trying to get a word
[1:53:30] to his sons you be careful that you
[1:53:33] don't choose this kind of a woman
[1:53:36] because
[1:53:38] her ways are movable
[1:53:43] today she's going to be one way tomorrow
[1:53:46] she may even be the same way the next
[1:53:49] day she may be something else
[1:53:55] so lest you should consider a life with
[1:53:59] her
[1:54:01] ways are movable
[1:54:05] they're not going to remain the same
[1:54:07] they they are so movable that you can't
[1:54:11] even know them
[1:54:13] all right
[1:54:14] and Solomon continues to exhort the
[1:54:17] children here now I pray you children
[1:54:19] and depart not from the words of my
[1:54:22] mouth remove thy way far from her and
[1:54:26] come not nigh to the door of her house
[1:54:30] lest thou should give thy honor unto
[1:54:33] others and thy years unto the cruel
[1:54:38] now I am not saying anything today to be
[1:54:41] offensive
[1:54:44] but there are many people
[1:54:46] who have made wrong choices
[1:54:49] and they've ended up
[1:54:51] in a
[1:54:53] serious situation
[1:54:55] and they've paid a deer price for it
[1:54:59] dear price
[1:55:03] and by the grace of God
[1:55:05] some that are sitting here today have
[1:55:08] been able to pick up the pieces
[1:55:11] and let the mercies of God touch them
[1:55:14] and move on
[1:55:18] God gave us the institution of marriage
[1:55:21] between one man and one woman for life
[1:55:26] foreign
[1:55:27] divorce was never his original plan
[1:55:32] he said it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:55:36] and so
[1:55:38] when divorce happens it calls his real
[1:55:42] true believers to remain in an unmarried
[1:55:46] state
[1:55:48] and again I'm not here to be offensive
[1:55:50] it's not even real out where I want to
[1:55:53] go with this today but we must recognize
[1:55:56] as children of God that God when he
[1:56:00] comes and he forgives us we must remain
[1:56:03] as we are and keep moving forward in the
[1:56:06] things of God and let the mercies of God
[1:56:08] continue to come down over us
[1:56:11] now Solomon recognized that this woman
[1:56:15] these women their ways were movable
[1:56:22] today they may give you one story and
[1:56:26] tomorrow they may give you another story
[1:56:28] now I am not here to bash women in any
[1:56:31] way
[1:56:32] no I'm not here for that
[1:56:35] but I recognize that there is a Godly
[1:56:38] concept that the Lord has given to his
[1:56:42] people in the end time that he wants us
[1:56:44] to follow a straight and a narrow
[1:56:46] pathway and that the the the way of the
[1:56:50] world is not going to work for us
[1:56:52] it's a stain
[1:56:55] because we have been called to a high
[1:56:58] and a holy calling a supernatural
[1:57:01] calling that we are to live by and we
[1:57:05] cannot remain down here just doing the
[1:57:08] status quo of what everybody else is
[1:57:10] doing it won't work
[1:57:18] my mind goes back to
[1:57:20] when brother Branham preached
[1:57:22] choosing of a bride in 1965.
[1:57:26] a brother Branham
[1:57:28] he was watching the decline
[1:57:32] of women
[1:57:34] in
[1:57:36] the 40s the 50s and the 60s
[1:57:40] he was watching their decline
[1:57:43] and
[1:57:44] he saw
[1:57:46] how that
[1:57:48] they were
[1:57:49] declining and he talked so much about
[1:57:53] the way the women who are declining as
[1:57:55] the way of women so goes the church he
[1:57:58] said because that the the church was
[1:58:02] typed as a woman
[1:58:04] and when he saw the decline in the
[1:58:06] church he recognized in the women rather
[1:58:09] he saw the decline in the church as well
[1:58:13] and he continued to cry out against all
[1:58:16] of the things that were changing
[1:58:19] now
[1:58:22] when we observe what was happening then
[1:58:26] and we realize how much farther it has
[1:58:29] come today
[1:58:32] and we as individuals may get caught up
[1:58:40] in a mindset
[1:58:44] of certain things well that's not so bad
[1:58:53] now I
[1:58:55] we know that
[1:58:57] Solomon
[1:58:58] he had his issues
[1:59:02] and
[1:59:03] these issues progressed
[1:59:08] and went along
[1:59:10] we know that
[1:59:12] David made the mistake with Bathsheba
[1:59:15] then Solomon he had many women and when
[1:59:18] Solomon when when he uh died and
[1:59:24] rehoboam took the throne and then the
[1:59:27] kingdom was divided and as time went on
[1:59:29] and you had the Kingdom of Israel the
[1:59:31] kingdom of Judah and you go on down and
[1:59:34] you watch the decline of the Kingdom as
[1:59:38] Ahab took the throne
[1:59:42] and as Ahab took the throne even though
[1:59:46] he was the king he had a jezebel
[1:59:55] and we can see by history
[1:59:58] that Jezebel
[2:00:00] was the neck that turned the head
[2:00:07] Ahab
[2:00:09] was the head
[2:00:13] but he had Jezebel beside of him whom he
[2:00:17] was constantly saying yes dear
[2:00:24] are you man
[2:00:26] lest you should think I'm some kind of a
[2:00:29] chauvinist
[2:00:30] there are some times it's very wise to
[2:00:34] say
[2:00:35] Yes dear
[2:00:40] Yes dear
[2:00:43] because there are some things that
[2:00:46] don't really matter in the whole scheme
[2:00:48] of things
[2:00:52] but men
[2:00:54] husbands daddies
[2:00:57] when it's time to be a dad
[2:01:00] when it's time to be a husband
[2:01:03] it is important that you don't let that
[2:01:06] yes dear syndrome get on you
[2:01:10] because the man is the head of the house
[2:01:14] he has been set in that place in divine
[2:01:18] order according to the scripture and he
[2:01:21] is to lead the household he is to be the
[2:01:25] head over his wife even as Christ the
[2:01:28] church and he's to love his wife as
[2:01:31] Christ loved the church and gave himself
[2:01:34] for it
[2:01:36] there are so many men that like that
[2:01:39] feeling of authority over their wives
[2:01:43] and they want to usurp that Authority
[2:01:46] and they want to wield the sword over
[2:01:48] their wife
[2:01:49] and they don't know how to treat her
[2:01:50] like a queen
[2:01:52] she's still your queen
[2:01:56] you chose her
[2:01:59] now brother Branham talked about in the
[2:02:01] choosing of a bride he was talking about
[2:02:03] the the watching this this farmer as
[2:02:06] he's watching these cows come through
[2:02:08] this fence
[2:02:11] and he toy he was watching this man this
[2:02:14] Rancher he's watching him as he's
[2:02:16] keeping an eye looking right in the face
[2:02:19] of these cattle as they come through the
[2:02:21] chute
[2:02:22] and brother Branham couldn't understand
[2:02:24] he said what's the matter what's this
[2:02:26] man doing
[2:02:29] is he some kind of a cow Whisperer or
[2:02:32] something
[2:02:34] he's looking at her in the eye and then
[2:02:37] he begins to explain to brother randomly
[2:02:39] says let me tell you something
[2:02:42] I look in their eyes because if that cow
[2:02:45] has a wild stare in their eye
[2:02:50] she'll never be a mother to her calf
[2:02:53] she's been in a stall and she's fat
[2:02:55] right now but with that wild stare she
[2:02:59] will never be a mother to her calf
[2:03:01] she'll run wild and she'll be skinny and
[2:03:04] she won't be what she needs to be so I
[2:03:06] don't want that wild stare and that
[2:03:08] really struck inspiration into brother
[2:03:10] Brennan because he began to talk about
[2:03:13] how that there were women with that wild
[2:03:15] stare they they're
[2:03:18] lest you should Ponder
[2:03:22] life with her
[2:03:24] her ways are movable
[2:03:30] now let's turn this a bit
[2:03:38] Ahab was the king
[2:03:41] he had a jezebel beside of him
[2:03:46] now
[2:03:48] there is something happening in that
[2:03:50] Kingdom
[2:03:52] that
[2:03:54] Jezebel is really behind the scenes
[2:03:57] ruling the roost
[2:04:00] when Ahab got to a place where that he
[2:04:03] wanted naboth's Vineyard and he tried to
[2:04:06] make an offer to naboth naboth says no
[2:04:09] you can't hide my piece of land naboth
[2:04:12] was standing firm to say this is my
[2:04:14] piece of ground and you can't have it
[2:04:17] no matter what you offer me for it it's
[2:04:19] mine it's my inheritance it's my
[2:04:22] Heritage you can't have it
[2:04:25] Ahab goes back to the Palace crying and
[2:04:28] and he turns his face toward the wall
[2:04:30] and he won't eat
[2:04:31] poor little guy
[2:04:34] Jezebel comes in and oh baby what's the
[2:04:38] matter with you
[2:04:40] naboth won't sell me his Vineyard but
[2:04:43] don't you worry you take your rest I'll
[2:04:45] take care of things
[2:04:47] and she did she had him killed
[2:04:52] but that wasn't the end of the story
[2:04:55] because God had an Elijah on the scene
[2:04:58] that was going to set things in divine
[2:05:00] order
[2:05:02] because God always has a divine order
[2:05:05] now we can we can watch the declines of
[2:05:08] the kingdom and we see that there was
[2:05:10] there was an athalia and she uh she just
[2:05:13] said she destroyed all the seed Royal
[2:05:15] and and she was one who just wanted to
[2:05:19] destroy everybody and
[2:05:22] this is she wanted to rule the roost
[2:05:25] because there was some kind of a wild
[2:05:28] stare in athaliah's eyes she wanted the
[2:05:31] power
[2:05:35] but there was
[2:05:37] a relative
[2:05:40] who hid
[2:05:42] Josh
[2:05:47] now if you follow the genealogy
[2:05:51] there was a descendant of athaliah
[2:05:56] who was married to a priest
[2:06:00] and they together
[2:06:03] hid joash
[2:06:05] in the temple
[2:06:08] for six years
[2:06:14] now I don't know how you keep
[2:06:17] a child from
[2:06:20] being exposed for six years
[2:06:23] I don't know how all that happens
[2:06:28] but jehoiah the priest was able to keep
[2:06:31] that child in the inner
[2:06:33] inner rooms of the Temple to preserve
[2:06:37] his life till at the appointed time
[2:06:39] joash could be brought out as the king
[2:06:42] and athaliah could scream treason
[2:06:46] but God had it ordained that way
[2:06:49] now
[2:06:51] in the lead-up to this
[2:06:55] jehu
[2:06:57] was one that God had ordained
[2:07:00] and
[2:07:03] he was taking care of business
[2:07:07] and the Bible tells us that he drove
[2:07:10] furiously
[2:07:14] like some of us
[2:07:23] as jehu is taking care of business
[2:07:27] I'm bringing this in because I I'm about
[2:07:30] to twist here
[2:07:32] as Jay who is taking care of business
[2:07:35] and he's riding along he comes upon this
[2:07:38] Bedouin
[2:07:40] named Johanna dab
[2:07:43] and he reaches out his hand and he
[2:07:46] beckons him to come he asks him is your
[2:07:49] heart right
[2:07:52] and Johanna dab says yeah my heart's
[2:07:55] right
[2:07:56] and jehu invites him up into the into
[2:07:58] the Chariot with him and jehu whips
[2:08:01] those horses and he moves along and he
[2:08:03] continues taking care of business now
[2:08:05] Johanna dab
[2:08:07] was a Bedouin
[2:08:12] and is he is
[2:08:15] keeping his family in line he is
[2:08:18] instructing them he instructed them
[2:08:21] don't drink wine
[2:08:23] he instructed them that they were to
[2:08:25] live in tents
[2:08:27] he gave them some other instruction
[2:08:29] along the way and they had been true to
[2:08:32] that instruction so when jehu says is
[2:08:35] Your Heart Right
[2:08:36] immediately Johanna dab says yes it is
[2:08:43] then in the book of Jeremiah Jeremiah is
[2:08:46] told by the Lord I want you to bring the
[2:08:48] sons of Johanna dab
[2:08:51] I want you to bring them
[2:08:54] and I want you to put wine plenty of
[2:08:56] wine
[2:08:58] and cups before their faces
[2:09:02] and tell them to drink it
[2:09:06] so
[2:09:07] this is the word of the Lord to Jeremiah
[2:09:12] Jeremiah does so he goes and he finds
[2:09:15] the son of Sons of Johanna dab
[2:09:19] and he puts out plenty of wine with
[2:09:21] plenty of Cups and he says
[2:09:24] drink the wine
[2:09:32] those men
[2:09:34] said we will not do it
[2:09:40] we were instructed by our father not to
[2:09:43] drink wine
[2:09:45] that we were to live in tents
[2:09:48] that we are to be nomads
[2:09:50] and there were some armies that have uh
[2:09:54] pushed in against us and so we came to
[2:09:57] Jerusalem but there's one thing that we
[2:09:59] remain true to and that was that we did
[2:10:01] not drink wine
[2:10:07] and they made such an impression on
[2:10:10] Jeremiah and God spoke to Jeremiah and
[2:10:13] said because they've held fast to this
[2:10:16] that they were this instruction that was
[2:10:18] given by their fathers they will not
[2:10:20] fail to have a place before me
[2:10:26] because somebody stuck by their
[2:10:29] convictions
[2:10:34] somebody
[2:10:36] heard their daddy say
[2:10:39] don't drink wine
[2:10:42] live in a tent
[2:10:44] be a better one
[2:10:47] and these men had stuck to at least one
[2:10:50] thing don't drink wine
[2:10:54] I just want to say to you daddy's
[2:10:59] you create a standard in your household
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:04] and if nobody else wants to live by the
[2:11:08] standard for your household God did not
[2:11:11] instruct you for another household he
[2:11:14] gave you the authority over your own
[2:11:16] hold fast to it
[2:11:19] teach it to your sons and your daughters
[2:11:21] so that they will hold fast to it
[2:11:26] now
[2:11:28] what does that have to do with Proverbs
[2:11:30] Chapter 5. here's where I want to go now
[2:11:33] we recognize by the teachings that we
[2:11:37] have had through the years that there is
[2:11:40] a system
[2:11:41] of religion that has been pressing in on
[2:11:45] the people of God for ages and
[2:11:47] generations
[2:11:49] we have watched it down through we we've
[2:11:51] seen by history down Through the Ages as
[2:11:55] these horse riders have come with a with
[2:11:58] an anointing to be uh to put upon them
[2:12:01] to try to destroy the Church of the
[2:12:05] Living God
[2:12:08] and in every age there has been a a
[2:12:12] counterfeit to the purposes of God
[2:12:17] the enemy has ridden in on his horse of
[2:12:20] whatever color it was at the time to try
[2:12:24] to destroy the covering to try to
[2:12:27] destroy God's people to try to get
[2:12:30] people to change their mind about what
[2:12:33] they had been taught
[2:12:36] foreign
[2:12:38] Church ages when the Apostle Paul had
[2:12:43] been preaching and teaching concerning
[2:12:46] the things of God and how that there
[2:12:48] should be this conduct among the people
[2:12:50] of the Living God and and Paul he was
[2:12:54] teaching that there were some things
[2:12:56] that when the Lord Jesus came there were
[2:12:59] things that were fulfilled that you
[2:13:01] could never do enough of the law to be
[2:13:04] able to satisfy and so when Jesus Christ
[2:13:07] came he was the Fulfillment of it and
[2:13:10] when you are in Christ
[2:13:13] some of those things were no longer
[2:13:15] necessary
[2:13:17] there were other things that Paul never
[2:13:20] said you can do away with this
[2:13:25] there was something inside of them that
[2:13:28] they recognized that there were certain
[2:13:30] things that they needed to remember they
[2:13:33] needed to honor they needed to uh every
[2:13:36] year whenever these things came around
[2:13:38] they needed to be a part of honoring
[2:13:40] that
[2:13:42] but as religion pressed in
[2:13:46] and as the apostles died out
[2:13:49] and men with out the spirit of God that
[2:13:54] that had an intellectual knowledge of
[2:13:57] what Paul was preaching who could come
[2:14:00] as as as
[2:14:02] some did and say we come in the name of
[2:14:06] Jesus who Paul preached that would not
[2:14:10] work
[2:14:11] it was an intellectual religion that did
[2:14:15] not bring the same results the same
[2:14:17] power the same Authority as what Paul
[2:14:21] was preaching when he was alive
[2:14:23] there were men that still had that same
[2:14:26] power and authority but there were
[2:14:28] others who were trying to uh trying to
[2:14:31] imitate it
[2:14:34] and in their imitation
[2:14:37] they're pulling the people away from the
[2:14:40] truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:14:44] and they are trying to give them another
[2:14:48] gospel
[2:14:54] we watched this through the church ages
[2:14:56] as
[2:15:00] the Roman system
[2:15:04] we see that they're offering a
[2:15:07] substitute to the people
[2:15:09] to try to get them to be one
[2:15:13] conglomeration
[2:15:17] we'll say a one world order of churches
[2:15:23] they wanted everybody to do the same
[2:15:26] thing but they weren't getting everybody
[2:15:29] doing the same thing according to the
[2:15:31] word of God they were doing it according
[2:15:33] to the thoughts of men
[2:15:36] so
[2:15:39] as they're giving their own thoughts
[2:15:45] every man
[2:15:47] has his own thoughts
[2:15:51] I have my own thoughts
[2:15:54] and I have had thoughts through the
[2:15:56] years I've had opinions about things
[2:15:58] that the Holy Spirit has had to come and
[2:16:01] correct those things
[2:16:04] to help me to see that I was in error
[2:16:06] that I was that I was
[2:16:09] allowing myself to have an idea of an
[2:16:15] organized religion
[2:16:18] and this is the way that people have
[2:16:20] done down Through the Ages they have
[2:16:23] allowed themselves to get under the
[2:16:27] popular view of things because it was
[2:16:30] easier to come to the popular view of
[2:16:33] things than to be that uh one that was
[2:16:37] always saying not so not so not so not
[2:16:41] so
[2:16:45] there were some that started out well
[2:16:49] preaching the whole truth
[2:16:51] but they got tired of being the odd man
[2:16:53] out
[2:16:58] most people don't like to be the oddball
[2:17:04] we don't like to be odd people
[2:17:06] peculiar people we don't we don't like
[2:17:08] to be the one that just looks so
[2:17:11] different acts so different has a
[2:17:13] different theology than all the rest of
[2:17:14] the church world but friends I'm telling
[2:17:16] you God is calling a people in this hour
[2:17:20] that if if we're going to really truly
[2:17:22] be that Supernatural race of people
[2:17:25] we're going to have to be in full and
[2:17:27] total alignment with the word of God and
[2:17:29] we're not going to be able to run after
[2:17:31] other things that other people have
[2:17:33] bless them if they if they want all of
[2:17:36] the things of the world then let them
[2:17:38] have it I've got to follow the lord
[2:17:41] Jesus with everything that's within me
[2:17:45] I don't know that I have ever ever
[2:17:50] Googled World Council of churches
[2:17:55] until yesterday
[2:17:58] and I find it incredibly interesting
[2:18:02] that Friday
[2:18:05] Friday
[2:18:06] they installed a new general secretary
[2:18:09] to the World Council of churches
[2:18:14] what does that have to do with us
[2:18:15] preacher
[2:18:16] you see the World Council of churches
[2:18:18] the Branham talked about this many times
[2:18:21] he talked about a council of churches
[2:18:23] that wanted people to come under one
[2:18:26] umbrella so that we can all do things
[2:18:28] the same way
[2:18:30] the only thing is that same way is not
[2:18:34] according to the word of God
[2:18:36] and so that means that I cannot come
[2:18:40] under the umbrella of a World Council of
[2:18:42] church your churches and know that I'm
[2:18:45] going to walk in the Supernatural
[2:18:46] because if we're all the same and we're
[2:18:50] all doing things the same and it's not
[2:18:51] according to the word of God we're no
[2:18:53] longer walking in the Supernatural
[2:18:55] we are no longer walking under the
[2:18:58] blessing of the Living God according to
[2:19:00] the word of God now we see the Roman
[2:19:03] system Through the Ages as it has tried
[2:19:06] to get its tentacles here and there and
[2:19:08] everywhere to try to break down the real
[2:19:11] word of God and we are uh we are a group
[2:19:16] of people who have been ridiculed
[2:19:19] because we have tried to get all of the
[2:19:23] sources of romanism
[2:19:26] out of our life
[2:19:28] all of it
[2:19:37] preacher are you going there again
[2:19:41] yes I believe I will
[2:19:45] because as Solomon said about a woman
[2:19:49] that I was was of ill repute that a man
[2:19:53] would Ponder his life with her to say
[2:19:56] can I get along with her
[2:19:58] if she decides to do this can I get
[2:20:01] along with her if she decides to to put
[2:20:04] a little paint on her face can I get
[2:20:06] along with her
[2:20:07] if she decides to go run around with
[2:20:10] another man can I get along with her can
[2:20:13] can we still have our household
[2:20:16] her ways are movable
[2:20:20] and this is the same way it is
[2:20:23] with this
[2:20:25] mother of harlots
[2:20:31] the King James Bible calls her a
[2:20:35] a mother of harlots which means that she
[2:20:39] has daughters
[2:20:42] and all of the while this system is
[2:20:45] trying to get its tentacles into the
[2:20:48] Church of the Living God to give you an
[2:20:51] alternate religion to pull you away from
[2:20:54] the truth of the word of God to give you
[2:20:57] some kind of a substitute
[2:21:00] to pull you away
[2:21:04] from truth
[2:21:07] now what we see
[2:21:10] is as the ages have unfolded and we we
[2:21:15] can go back and we can look at the
[2:21:16] history of those ages and we see how
[2:21:19] that the Deeds became Doctrine
[2:21:24] and as the Deeds became Doctrine
[2:21:28] the people then were no longer under the
[2:21:32] doctrine of this they were under a
[2:21:35] man-made Doctrine
[2:21:37] now we know that as it was when the
[2:21:41] serpent came to the woman in the garden
[2:21:43] there is lots of Truth in it
[2:21:49] but
[2:21:50] there is untruth in it
[2:21:56] and as that untruth
[2:22:00] see the when the enemy comes to you and
[2:22:03] says oh that ain't so bad
[2:22:07] he paints it as beautifully
[2:22:10] as he can
[2:22:15] you ever seen one of these pictures
[2:22:17] where they tell you how many birds can
[2:22:19] you find in this picture
[2:22:22] and they're hidden in there in such a
[2:22:24] way that you maybe can get five or six
[2:22:26] of them
[2:22:27] but there's actually seven and you just
[2:22:29] can't seem to find that that's the way
[2:22:31] the enemy does
[2:22:33] he paints this beautiful picture
[2:22:37] and he puts
[2:22:39] truths in it
[2:22:42] and he puts lies in it
[2:22:46] and he covers up those lies he covers up
[2:22:49] those lies
[2:22:51] and you may catch two or three or four
[2:22:53] or five of them but there's actually
[2:22:55] seven in there or maybe there's ten and
[2:22:57] you not catching them all but that's the
[2:22:59] way the enemy works because he doesn't
[2:23:01] want you to catch all of the lies
[2:23:04] that are are in that picture and he
[2:23:08] wants you to partake of his picture he
[2:23:12] wants you to be a part of his his
[2:23:14] picture because he doesn't want you to
[2:23:17] walk in the fullness of your destiny
[2:23:24] we want you to miss part of it
[2:23:27] and so
[2:23:29] he brings
[2:23:31] things into your life
[2:23:34] to cause you
[2:23:37] to think well that's that's not so bad
[2:23:40] I I can get by with this
[2:23:44] I can
[2:23:46] I can still go to church and
[2:23:49] nobody knows what I'm doing here
[2:23:52] it'll it'll be okay
[2:23:54] as long as I go to church and I I've
[2:23:57] participate and I do my part and I pay
[2:24:00] my tithe and get my offering I I can do
[2:24:03] I can do this and nobody has to know
[2:24:05] about it
[2:24:06] but friends God knows about it
[2:24:12] now we can talk about how that the works
[2:24:16] of the flesh
[2:24:17] get a hold of us
[2:24:21] and we can talk about some things that
[2:24:25] we have conquered in the past about the
[2:24:29] way we dress or the way we live but
[2:24:31] there are things that the enemy tries to
[2:24:34] hide in such a way that we can't see
[2:24:37] them very clearly
[2:24:39] and so then God has to he has to bring
[2:24:43] them Time After Time After Time because
[2:24:46] we've got to see the way that they're
[2:24:48] rooted in a religious system to try to
[2:24:53] keep us from our full walk with the Lord
[2:25:03] don't have to preach over again about
[2:25:06] all the pagan holidays you don't have to
[2:25:09] do that
[2:25:12] but what I would like to say is
[2:25:17] we have been blessed to have a message
[2:25:21] in this day
[2:25:24] to help us to see truth
[2:25:29] and in that message there were little
[2:25:31] things that were dropped along the way
[2:25:37] and we can take
[2:25:39] our time and we can explain them away
[2:25:45] and say there's nothing wrong with that
[2:25:50] he did it
[2:25:52] what can possibly be wrong with it
[2:26:00] here is what I would say
[2:26:03] when I'm standing here
[2:26:06] under the anointing as any man of God
[2:26:08] under the anointing there's a boldness
[2:26:10] that comes over us
[2:26:12] to be able to say things according to
[2:26:15] the word and the will of God
[2:26:18] when a man gets out from under that
[2:26:20] anointing
[2:26:22] and he has to go live with his wife
[2:26:24] his children
[2:26:26] he still has to set his house in order
[2:26:30] it doesn't negate the word of God that
[2:26:33] comes across the pulpit
[2:26:37] no it doesn't it doesn't negate the word
[2:26:40] of God that comes across this Pulpit or
[2:26:43] any Pulpit for that matter
[2:26:46] the word of God Stands Strong it stands
[2:26:49] true and we've got to base Our Lives not
[2:26:53] on what a preacher does but on the word
[2:26:55] of God
[2:26:57] and when there is when we recognize that
[2:27:01] there are things in our house that we
[2:27:03] have allowed to creep in then we've got
[2:27:07] to get rid of them
[2:27:10] we've got to set our own house in order
[2:27:13] you say preacher if I do what you're
[2:27:17] saying then it's going to make my my
[2:27:20] family look like a freak family because
[2:27:22] we're getting rid of this and we're
[2:27:23] getting rid of that and we're getting go
[2:27:25] ahead
[2:27:28] because when it comes down to the end
[2:27:30] you're the man that's got to stand for
[2:27:33] your household and give answer for what
[2:27:35] you've allowed to creep into the house
[2:27:37] because you are the priest of your home
[2:27:41] and you've got to answer for it
[2:27:44] now
[2:27:45] you know in the in the early days
[2:27:47] of this ministry when I first came
[2:27:52] Disney was preached against
[2:27:57] and let me just say it would have been a
[2:28:00] good idea
[2:28:01] hello
[2:28:05] if we as parents
[2:28:08] had kept
[2:28:10] strong on that very thought
[2:28:14] because now in 2023 we see how that the
[2:28:19] demon spirits that have ridden in on
[2:28:21] Disney and all of the wokeness and the
[2:28:25] lgbtq plus and all of that stuff that's
[2:28:28] written in and and it's hidden in little
[2:28:31] uh messages in these little movies that
[2:28:35] are for the kitties and there are
[2:28:37] Disney's not the only ones friends
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:41] it's not the only ones
[2:28:43] but these little in these little hidden
[2:28:46] agendas that are in these movies that
[2:28:49] our children watch and we think that
[2:28:52] they're innocent and yet they're not
[2:28:56] why are you preaching about this
[2:28:58] preacher because I see how that we have
[2:29:01] allowed things to come and we see that
[2:29:05] the ways of this woman are movable
[2:29:09] they're movable
[2:29:12] you say well we ought to be movable and
[2:29:14] fluid that's right we as the children of
[2:29:16] God we go with the flow of the spirit
[2:29:19] not with the flow of Hollywood
[2:29:23] cannot be our movement it's got to be by
[2:29:26] the spirit of God that we move because
[2:29:29] we don't want under to be under the
[2:29:31] sound of a strange woman
[2:29:33] we want to be under the sound of our
[2:29:36] mate the Lord Jesus Christ and when the
[2:29:39] word is being preached and when the word
[2:29:42] is going forth and we hear the sound of
[2:29:45] Truth we need to say yes Lord I will
[2:29:52] so this the book of the revelation we
[2:29:56] see that this mother of harlots
[2:30:00] was not satisfied just to keep her
[2:30:03] Doctrine to herself to keep her religion
[2:30:06] to herself she wanted it passed down and
[2:30:08] passed down and passed down and passed
[2:30:10] down so here we are in our hour where
[2:30:13] that it's been passed down and passed
[2:30:15] down and passed down
[2:30:17] and because
[2:30:19] that we have
[2:30:23] been
[2:30:27] people who have listened to the word of
[2:30:29] God
[2:30:31] and we have
[2:30:35] listened
[2:30:37] to intellectual preachers
[2:30:43] some of which may have never had the
[2:30:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:30:51] we have
[2:30:53] heard what they had to say
[2:30:56] which they had heard from a previous
[2:30:58] generation what they had to say and so
[2:31:02] things began to get watered down
[2:31:06] the the word of God gets watered down to
[2:31:09] the point that people then they say well
[2:31:12] what's wrong with that
[2:31:14] [Music]
[2:31:16] what's wrong with that
[2:31:19] well let me turn the question around to
[2:31:22] you what's right with that
[2:31:24] amen
[2:31:30] let's just go to the most recent one
[2:31:32] since I started up Tuesday night
[2:31:36] what's right with Valentine's Day
[2:31:41] let's write with it
[2:31:45] oh it makes me feel so loved
[2:31:56] the fact is if you trace it back to some
[2:31:59] of its roots
[2:32:01] and the filthiness of it you don't want
[2:32:03] it
[2:32:07] then you realize
[2:32:10] all of the money that is spent on cards
[2:32:13] and flowers and chocolates nothing wrong
[2:32:16] with flowers and nothing wrong with
[2:32:17] chocolate and nothing wrong with a card
[2:32:20] nothing wrong with them
[2:32:23] yet when
[2:32:25] there is all of these
[2:32:28] symbols of paganism
[2:32:30] that are
[2:32:32] inner wove into their holiday
[2:32:36] then a Believer has to say
[2:32:39] what is right with it
[2:32:44] what can I say that's right about
[2:32:47] Valentine's Day
[2:32:49] what can I say that's right about
[2:32:51] Halloween what can I say that's right
[2:32:54] about Christmas what can I say that's
[2:32:57] right about Easter
[2:33:04] well isn't Easter about the resurrection
[2:33:06] of the
[2:33:07] Lord Jesus
[2:33:10] no
[2:33:12] no
[2:33:17] another Pagan deity there involved
[2:33:21] so we don't want nothing to do with that
[2:33:28] now I I've just talked about these
[2:33:31] holidays you see we get we get smacked
[2:33:35] up side to head by people because that
[2:33:37] we want to uh honor the feasts of the
[2:33:40] Lord
[2:33:44] they're Jewish feasts
[2:33:46] nope
[2:33:48] not what the word says
[2:33:51] they're called the feasts of the Lord
[2:33:54] and so I want to honor what is the
[2:33:56] Lord's and and if if it's something that
[2:33:59] he had such a a fondness to such a a
[2:34:03] repetition that he wanted his people to
[2:34:06] remember it where that they had all the
[2:34:08] men had to go up to Jerusalem one time a
[2:34:11] year for each of those feasts so three
[2:34:13] times a year they were supposed to go up
[2:34:15] to Jerusalem there was something special
[2:34:17] in the mind of God that he wanted them
[2:34:20] to remember it and why would we as
[2:34:22] Christian Believers want to remember it
[2:34:25] because we see all of the ways that it
[2:34:29] was pointing toward the lord Jesus
[2:34:31] Christ and the crucifixion and the
[2:34:35] resurrection and all of these things
[2:34:37] that were for us
[2:34:41] Passover pesach
[2:34:44] remembering the blood and the body of
[2:34:47] the Lord
[2:34:49] and how that he when they remembered the
[2:34:53] Feast of the Lord it was because that
[2:34:56] they God wanted them to remember that
[2:34:59] they were brought out by a mighty strong
[2:35:02] hand out from under the uh the bondage
[2:35:05] of Egypt and a Believer can recognize as
[2:35:10] they remember Passover they can remember
[2:35:13] how that they were under Egypt's bondage
[2:35:18] and there was such a bondage over them
[2:35:21] until that they were under the task
[2:35:24] masters of the enemy and there came a
[2:35:27] day where that to deliverer the Lord
[2:35:30] Jesus Christ came and he delivered us
[2:35:33] out from under those task Masters
[2:35:38] and he invited us
[2:35:42] to
[2:35:43] eat his body and to drink his blood
[2:35:47] the body word of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:35:51] foreign
[2:35:54] word of the Lord Jesus Christ is not
[2:35:58] mixed with Fables
[2:36:00] it's not mixed with tradition it's not
[2:36:02] mixed now that ain't saying that we
[2:36:05] don't have traditions
[2:36:07] there is nothing wrong with traditions
[2:36:12] the problem that Jesus had with the with
[2:36:15] the Sadducees and the Pharisees and all
[2:36:18] of the clerical guys of this day was
[2:36:21] that they put their Traditions above the
[2:36:24] word of God
[2:36:26] thank you
[2:36:28] teach
[2:36:30] as gospel you teach as Commandments your
[2:36:36] traditions
[2:36:38] that is why that if I light a Shabbat
[2:36:42] candle I cannot say that it's the
[2:36:45] Commandment because it's not God's
[2:36:48] commandment it's a rabbinical
[2:36:50] commandment
[2:36:52] now if you say it's according to the
[2:36:54] Commandment of the rabbis okay but it's
[2:36:57] not a commandment of the Lord that I
[2:36:59] light a Shabbat candle if I wish to do
[2:37:02] it it's to honor that I know the Lord of
[2:37:06] Shabbat
[2:37:08] he is the one who said come unto me all
[2:37:11] you that weary are weary and heavy laden
[2:37:13] and I will give you rest and he has
[2:37:16] given us rest
[2:37:18] now
[2:37:19] I admit to you today that there are days
[2:37:23] that I cannot find my way into his rest
[2:37:29] because I'm fighting my own battles
[2:37:32] and I don't know how to get there
[2:37:35] after all of these years I'm ashamed to
[2:37:38] tell you there are times that I feel
[2:37:40] like I don't know how to get there
[2:37:44] but yet there's rest for the weary
[2:37:47] and there is a way for me to get there
[2:37:51] and what it amounts to is I don't use
[2:37:54] what I know
[2:37:57] because I have been given a voice a
[2:38:00] voice of Praise as you have to be able
[2:38:03] to Worship the Lord and give adoration
[2:38:06] to the god of Heaven for all that he has
[2:38:09] done for me and that brings a Liberation
[2:38:12] in us and it gets us out from heavy
[2:38:15] loads so many times and there are other
[2:38:18] times where we just can't seem to open
[2:38:21] our mouth
[2:38:24] foreign
[2:38:25] we just
[2:38:27] we we just
[2:38:29] can't seem to do it
[2:38:31] but it's there all the time
[2:38:35] it is ours
[2:38:39] so then it comes back to that lovely
[2:38:42] thing of choice
[2:38:51] how many have ever had
[2:38:53] an easy battle
[2:38:58] I'm not talking about all through life
[2:38:59] I'm just talking about maybe one time
[2:39:01] you went into a battle and you came out
[2:39:03] the other side and you say oh God has
[2:39:05] been so good to me that was kind of easy
[2:39:07] sure we have
[2:39:09] sure we have
[2:39:14] and we had strategy for that moment and
[2:39:18] we knew what to say we knew what to do
[2:39:20] we we just felt like it was just right
[2:39:22] there
[2:39:23] and we came through it and felt like wow
[2:39:27] Lord you are so good
[2:39:29] and there are other times where that we
[2:39:32] came into a battle and it looks similar
[2:39:34] to that battle that looked so easy and
[2:39:37] we try the same strategies and we try
[2:39:39] the same thing and it seems like that
[2:39:41] we're just beating our head against a
[2:39:43] brick wall
[2:39:44] and we can't seem to get any traction to
[2:39:46] to get through this battle and we wonder
[2:39:49] well what's going on why is this one
[2:39:51] harder well friends not every battle is
[2:39:54] going to be easy
[2:39:55] not every battle is going to be overcome
[2:39:58] the exact same way
[2:40:00] the channel that worked for one battle
[2:40:02] was not may not be used on the next one
[2:40:05] the same channel that we get in in a
[2:40:07] spirit of worship may not work in the
[2:40:09] next service it is that we have got to
[2:40:12] hear the mind of the Lord for the moment
[2:40:16] and in order for us to get a stronger
[2:40:19] bow a stronger resistance in us to the
[2:40:23] enemy there's got to be harder battles
[2:40:27] nobody wants to hear that
[2:40:30] nobody wants to hear that
[2:40:33] but yet
[2:40:35] we come with this with this word with
[2:40:38] this warning that the battle is going to
[2:40:40] get hot and heavy well wait a minute
[2:40:42] preacher I thought we were going to have
[2:40:44] a supernatural year well not
[2:40:46] everything's Supernatural is easy to
[2:40:47] come by
[2:40:50] it takes a lot of dying out
[2:40:53] it takes a lot of getting rid of self it
[2:40:55] takes a lot of uh saying not my will but
[2:40:58] thy will be done O Lord
[2:41:00] and as weak this this bride of Jesus
[2:41:04] Christ as we come down to the end of all
[2:41:07] things
[2:41:08] the battle gets hot and heavy and the
[2:41:11] the not only the World Council of
[2:41:14] churches but even those that say they
[2:41:17] believe the same thing that we do start
[2:41:20] pressing in and say that's not necessary
[2:41:26] that's not necessary
[2:41:28] we don't have to live that strict we
[2:41:30] don't have to live like that yeah yeah
[2:41:32] yeah and
[2:41:35] we hear these voices and they're they're
[2:41:38] just pressing in on our mind because the
[2:41:41] enemy wants to break down your will
[2:41:42] because he wants you to be a part of
[2:41:46] this woman that's always moving nothing
[2:41:49] ever stable nothing ever concrete but
[2:41:52] the word of God is sure
[2:41:54] the word of God is steadfast the word of
[2:41:57] God is immovable
[2:42:00] it doesn't change he is the same
[2:42:03] yesterday and today and forever he is
[2:42:07] the same and his word will remain the
[2:42:09] same and when we can understand that we
[2:42:13] cannot run after another woman
[2:42:19] a real man of God is not going to go
[2:42:22] after another woman
[2:42:23] other than his wife
[2:42:28] a young man with the Holy Ghost is not
[2:42:31] going to be chasing two or three girls
[2:42:33] at the same time
[2:42:38] he's going to get a hold of God and he's
[2:42:40] going to say
[2:42:42] Lord you show me
[2:42:45] you help me
[2:42:49] and a real man of God is not going to be
[2:42:51] trying to chase after the truth of God's
[2:42:54] word and the traditions of man and
[2:42:57] another religious system that man of God
[2:43:00] is going to say Lord I have got to put
[2:43:03] my eyes right on you I am I am one who
[2:43:08] has to have the truth I can't have it
[2:43:10] mixed with another man's religion I've
[2:43:13] got to know is am I am I if I am
[2:43:16] partaking of this is this something that
[2:43:19] is going to help me or is this something
[2:43:21] that is going to hurt me
[2:43:24] foreign
[2:43:28] term or long term
[2:43:30] is it going to help me or is it going to
[2:43:32] hurt me
[2:43:33] I've got to know
[2:43:38] religion
[2:43:41] will not
[2:43:42] see you through to the rapture
[2:43:47] relationship with the Lord Jesus
[2:43:49] Christ's will
[2:43:52] and I would encourage you as a body of
[2:43:56] Believers those that are watching this
[2:43:58] I would encourage us everyone
[2:44:01] that we
[2:44:04] really look at the scope of our life and
[2:44:07] we say am I
[2:44:10] doing religion or am I having a
[2:44:15] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:44:17] am I going after man's ideas or am I
[2:44:23] really listening to the word of God am I
[2:44:27] here to say
[2:44:32] not my will Lord
[2:44:39] not my will
[2:44:41] I I
[2:44:43] listen
[2:44:45] if the traditions of men
[2:44:49] could have produced a rapture
[2:44:54] been done
[2:45:00] but that's not what's going to produce a
[2:45:01] Rapture it's going to be a group of
[2:45:03] people
[2:45:04] that are willing to lay down everything
[2:45:10] the musicians are coming please
[2:45:14] we could
[2:45:16] have debate
[2:45:19] about
[2:45:20] things that
[2:45:22] we might think are okay
[2:45:25] we might debate about them and and say
[2:45:27] you know there's there's really nothing
[2:45:29] wrong with that
[2:45:32] and today
[2:45:36] there might not be
[2:45:42] you just
[2:45:43] you think about
[2:45:46] some of the things that we have heard on
[2:45:48] recorded sermons
[2:45:50] from the 50s and 60s that were cried out
[2:45:53] against
[2:45:54] and
[2:45:55] it looked so innocent
[2:45:58] then
[2:46:01] and we thought
[2:46:03] what's wrong with that
[2:46:06] but then you watch the progression of it
[2:46:08] through the years
[2:46:11] that servant of the Lord is gone but
[2:46:13] what he said you watch the progression
[2:46:15] of it
[2:46:17] and as it progresses
[2:46:21] on through the years and you see where
[2:46:23] it is today
[2:46:27] you will see that that
[2:46:31] a prophet Seer could see further than
[2:46:35] that day
[2:46:38] you would see that he could see the end
[2:46:43] of it was leading somebody their feet to
[2:46:45] hell
[2:46:47] it was leading them astray
[2:46:49] and the end thereof would not be a a of
[2:46:53] a nature to where that it would bring
[2:46:55] about the The Godly character that was
[2:46:58] needed in the end time for the Bride of
[2:47:00] Jesus Christ but it was producing more
[2:47:04] of the same either status quo or the
[2:47:08] other direction
[2:47:10] because
[2:47:13] that's what things of the flesh will do
[2:47:21] so you
[2:47:23] I all of us
[2:47:26] when the word of God goes across this
[2:47:28] Pulpit when we hear the word of God when
[2:47:31] something is said that goes against our
[2:47:34] grain
[2:47:41] ever had that
[2:47:43] felt like the cat was being petted the
[2:47:45] wrong direction
[2:47:48] didn't like it
[2:47:51] got mad
[2:47:55] said I don't know why that preacher has
[2:47:57] to touch on that
[2:47:58] don't know why he's got to say stuff
[2:48:00] like that why don't he just stay in the
[2:48:01] word
[2:48:03] we're trying our best to stay right in
[2:48:04] the word
[2:48:06] that's what we want we want to stay in
[2:48:07] the word
[2:48:10] because we want all of the traditions of
[2:48:13] men
[2:48:14] that will not produce the character of
[2:48:16] Jesus Christ we want him out of our life
[2:48:18] we want all of the things that that uh
[2:48:22] man's idea we want them out of our life
[2:48:24] be and we don't want to come under the
[2:48:27] rule of a man-made system as we read in
[2:48:30] the book of of revelation we don't want
[2:48:33] under that woman we don't want a Jezebel
[2:48:35] spirit to lead us we don't want any of
[2:48:37] that stuff we want to be under the
[2:48:39] leadership of the Holy Ghost and know
[2:48:41] that we are hearing the living word for
[2:48:44] now for today we're saying okay Lord I
