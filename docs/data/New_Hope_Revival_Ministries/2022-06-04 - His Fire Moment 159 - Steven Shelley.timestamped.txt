[0:00] because it's not what you do
[0:04] that makes you holy
[0:11] [Music]
[0:12] can i talk to you a minute about the
[0:14] bush
[0:16] did you know there was a mountain full
[0:17] of bushes
[0:20] there was a mountain full of bushes
[0:22] one day moses was walking along the
[0:24] trail of that mountain and god came down
[0:28] and crawled into a bush
[0:33] and a voice spoke out of that bush and
[0:35] said take off your shoes moses
[0:38] unless your sandals
[0:40] because the ground that you are now
[0:43] standing on is
[0:45] holy ground i want to know what made it
[0:47] holy
[0:48] i i want to know what made that bush any
[0:51] different than any other bush on that
[0:56] ah mountain it is
[0:59] it was the god in the bush
[1:02] i want you to know that ordinarily if
[1:04] you look at our life compare it with
[1:06] somebody else's
[1:08] we're really in the natural in the
[1:10] physical no better than anybody else
[1:13] no more special
[1:14] not more intelligent or more talented or
[1:17] more gifted
[1:19] when god said i'm going to make you a
[1:21] holy people he meant i'm going to put
[1:24] myself on you i'm going to eventually
[1:27] live in you by the baptism of the holy
[1:30] ghost and that's what's going to make
[1:31] you holy
[1:33] i believe in coming out of the world
[1:36] i believe in mentally and emotionally
[1:38] checking out of this world and making
[1:40] sure that you have a different life than
[1:43] the world around you i believe in that
[1:45] i believe in that i believe that there
[1:47] are clear distinctions that god gives us
[1:49] in his word he said i want men to look
[1:52] like men
[1:53] and i want women to look like women
[1:55] and i want them to know the difference
[1:58] and i know we're living in an hour where
[1:59] there's a total confusion on the issue
[2:02] but god is not confused he just keeps
[2:04] doing it like he has always done it
[2:07] but i want you to understand that you
[2:09] could live like a monk
[2:12] in a little shack on the side of the
[2:14] mountain and eat cornbread and drink
[2:16] water the rest of your life and not be
[2:17] any more holy
[2:22] because it's not what you do
[2:25] that makes you holy
[2:28] that bush didn't do anything different
[2:30] than any other bush it did what it
[2:32] always did just stood there
[2:35] do i look like a bush
[2:36] [Music]
[2:39] it just stood there
[2:41] it just did what it had always done
[2:43] every day of its life and one day god
[2:46] said you're mine
[2:48] today you're my bush
[2:52] i created every bush on this mountain
[2:55] but today you're my bush
[2:57] i choose you
[2:59] didn't the word say you have not chosen
[3:01] me but i have chosen you says the lord
[3:07] so what he did he chose a bush
[3:10] he put himself in that bush he speaks
[3:13] out of that bush
[3:16] giving moses his commission
[3:19] and because god is standing there in
[3:21] that bush the ground
[3:23] becomes holy ground
[3:27] because god is there
[3:29] today you have become a holy people amen
[3:34] it is not our holiness
[3:36] it is not our righteousness
[3:39] it is not our uniform
[3:41] it's because before the foundation of
[3:44] the world god saw a people in his mind
[3:49] that would choose him even way over in
[3:52] wicked laodicea
[3:55] they would choose a different path to
[3:58] follow the mandate of the master come on
[4:01] and by that he allowed you to come in
[4:03] this hour and he because you've called
[4:05] on him he knew you would
[4:08] he saw you doing it before you did
[4:11] and he poured his righteousness on you
[4:13] just like he chose a bush not a special
[4:15] bush just a bush
[4:17] but it became the most special bush on
[4:19] that mountain because god crawled into
[4:22] it let me tell you in an upper room
[4:25] pillar of fire divided itself into all
[4:28] those little licks of fire and hung over
[4:31] their heads
[4:33] and what was it it wasn't emmanuel god
[4:36] with us anymore it was now god in us
[4:40] by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[4:44] fire he's now living in us
