TRANSCRIPT
========================================
keep eating keep walking if you always do what you've always done you'll always be what you've always been keep walking if the angel of the Lord is going before you and he is measuring out something and pointing you in the direction of something great from the Lord you don't ever want to be slack in moving forward how many of you know sometimes it's a sprint and sometimes it's a creepy crawl you're not going to be judged or measured or evaluated on speed you're going to be evaluated by consistency [Music] walking he goes before you he measures before you he leads you into a deeper place in his side you've got to make sure your walk is submerged in the fresh anointing of the Spirit of God you've got to make sure that your feet are being bathed in a fresh oil in a fresh experience that comes from God and it's got to be consistent you may be running like a hare or you may be dragging like a turtle it does not matter you must be consistent
