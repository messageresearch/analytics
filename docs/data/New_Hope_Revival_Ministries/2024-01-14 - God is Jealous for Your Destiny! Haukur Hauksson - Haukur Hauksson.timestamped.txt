[54:41] you're doing in all of our

[54:49] uncomfortable but you're doing it out of
[54:53] love you you saw something before we
[54:56] were
[54:58] born and you are carefully
[55:03] crafting Our
[55:05] Lives into something
[55:08] [Music]
[55:10] Beautiful Lord we just Commit This
[55:13] Moment to your hands into your into your
[55:16] spirit Lord let your perfect plan unfold
[55:19] father in jesus' name
[55:23] amen you can be
[55:31] did I'm going to be touching my phone
[55:34] but I'm not playing on my phone I'm
[55:36] going to try to control the slides with
[55:39] my phone we'll see how it
[55:54] goes
[56:06] uh he may not be very polished it's
[56:09] going to be
[56:11] real a little bit
[56:13] raw
[56:15] uh I
[56:19] am I was asked to preach quite a bit ago
[56:23] and I kind of
[56:26] said
[56:29] no not not plainly but there was
[56:31] something going on in my life and that's
[56:34] I think it was in November but
[56:37] then December for me was the most
[56:41] interesting month probably in many many
[56:44] years uh
[56:47] but then he came to me again brother
[56:50] Shelly and there was something within me
[56:53] that I had to say yes yes because when
[56:56] you're most
[56:57] uncomfortable and when you don't want to
[56:59] do something that's when you need to do
[57:02] it because if you don't there's
[57:05] something within you that
[57:07] just that that
[57:10] breaks uh so when I'm walking out of
[57:14] brother shelle's office that just this
[57:16] phrase came over me God is jealous over
[57:19] your
[57:21] destiny
[57:23] and he is
[57:25] most
[57:27] importantly he's jealous over your
[57:30] heart like that's what he's
[57:33] after and uh like we may all of us like
[57:38] we we feel like we have a specific
[57:39] purpose some of us have no clue what it
[57:42] is but we have some hints we try to
[57:46] figure it out we get you know usually
[57:49] it's like reveal to us in
[57:53] stages but
[57:55] there's like a there's a main objective
[57:57] that God has for all of us for me for
[58:00] you it's the same
[58:01] thing and
[58:05] uh like our ultimate purpose in life is
[58:10] to be a place where God can live
[58:16] in and in and then we have the ability
[58:20] to love
[58:22] God and out of that
[58:27] come comes our main purpose and that's
[58:29] for the for all of us and that is to
[58:31] love other
[58:32] people it's not to be for somebody to be
[58:36] a teacher or a preacher or a writer
[58:39] producer or have an orphanage like
[58:42] that's all
[58:43] secondary because if you don't love your
[58:46] neighbor it has no
[58:49] meaning and so where God had to deal
[58:52] with me very harshly
[58:56] uh like I think I've never like the last
[59:00] two two three years of my life have been
[59:03] amazing in the
[59:05] natural but in the spiritual inwardly in
[59:08] my heart it's been like
[59:12] horrible and uh when I got a word that
[59:16] God was going to cleanse me like the
[59:18] prophets of
[59:19] old like I had no idea what was fixing
[59:22] to happen on the inside
[59:25] you know I'm just coasting along and on
[59:28] the inside of me I'm absolutely
[59:30] trembling everything in the natural
[59:32] looks amazing everything's going
[59:35] well uh but
[59:38] inwardly I could not enjoy any single
[59:44] thing and and you feel like you're
[59:47] losing your mind like what in the world
[59:49] is going on and it is so
[59:52] uncomfortable but now I know what it
[59:55] what it was all
[59:57] about and I'm thankful for it now
[1:00:00] because God is realigning you to the
[1:00:02] purpose why you were
[1:00:13] born
[1:00:15] okay one of the scribes came and heard
[1:00:17] them arguing and recognized that he had
[1:00:19] answered them
[1:00:21] well asked him what commandment is the
[1:00:25] foremost of
[1:00:27] all Jesus answered the foremost is here
[1:00:30] o Israel the Lord our God is one
[1:00:34] Lord and you shall love the Lord your
[1:00:37] God with all your heart with all your
[1:00:39] soul and with all your mind and with all
[1:00:42] your
[1:00:44] strength the second is this you shall
[1:00:47] love your neighbor as yourself there is
[1:00:50] no other commandment greater than
[1:00:53] this so
[1:00:57] um the whole Bible is summarized in
[1:00:59] three verses like it's all it's all
[1:01:02] about that and so it may sound easy but
[1:01:06] it you incapable of loving God on your
[1:01:10] own and it's impossible it sounds so
[1:01:13] right to love your
[1:01:16] neighbor but the love that he's talking
[1:01:20] about how does he describe his
[1:01:23] love
[1:01:24] laying down your life for your
[1:01:27] friends think about others more than
[1:01:30] yourself there's very like that is in in
[1:01:34] our Human Condition it's impossible
[1:01:38] without the Holy Ghost and it takes a
[1:01:41] lot in life to learn to love because
[1:01:45] that is the progress of our destiny we
[1:01:48] are here to learn to
[1:01:51] love and I wish it was easy like I I I
[1:01:55] really do but it's extremely
[1:01:59] difficult
[1:02:03] um so I want to talk a little bit about
[1:02:09] Destiny I want to talk
[1:02:12] about
[1:02:14] discipline and also just going into the
[1:02:18] Simplicity Simplicity of what God has
[1:02:23] done for our lives because as you grow
[1:02:28] as you walk with God you you can become
[1:02:32] numb for the main
[1:02:35] thing in the beginning you are like you
[1:02:39] are so thankful that God is real that he
[1:02:43] loves you and that he went on a cross
[1:02:46] for you and then as you go along and you
[1:02:49] go in a religious rout the cross becomes
[1:02:52] a Bible story
[1:02:54] and not a living reality in your
[1:02:57] life
[1:02:59] until you really need
[1:03:03] it and uh I want to talk a little bit
[1:03:06] about
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:12] uh and you have forgotten the
[1:03:15] exhortation which was addressed to you
[1:03:17] as Sons my son do not regard lightly the
[1:03:21] discipline of the Lord nor faint when
[1:03:23] you are reproved by
[1:03:26] him For Those whom the Lord loves he
[1:03:28] disciplines and he scorches every son
[1:03:32] whom he
[1:03:34] receives I'm going to go back into that
[1:03:37] at the end of
[1:03:39] this the what I'm going to share
[1:03:45] but it can be a proof that God is
[1:03:48] disciplining you that that he loves you
[1:03:50] if he just leaves you alone and you go
[1:03:52] on your own way that that's not
[1:03:55] good at
[1:03:58] all
[1:04:00] so he will deal with you with all your
[1:04:04] issues from out his motive is
[1:04:07] love and I thought it was appropriate to
[1:04:11] listen to brother Daniel's songs and the
[1:04:14] last song of of Joshua that he sung
[1:04:18] because I have
[1:04:20] prayed dangerous
[1:04:23] prayers a big part of my my journey and
[1:04:26] you probably have too and you have no
[1:04:28] idea what you were praying for Lord
[1:04:31] break my will Lord have your perfect way
[1:04:34] in in in my life whatever it
[1:04:37] takes right so when it h then then it
[1:04:41] happens to
[1:04:42] you and you're like you freak
[1:04:45] out and you have you have no idea what
[1:04:49] what is going on that's right but he's
[1:04:51] dealing with your
[1:04:53] heart and and you can't and it takes a
[1:04:56] lot of pressure to deal with your
[1:04:59] heart be like
[1:05:05] yeah and so again uh I'm going to re it
[1:05:10] a lot of what I'm sharing applies to all
[1:05:12] of us I'm going to share from a personal
[1:05:15] experience so it can be a little bit
[1:05:16] relatable because it's real to me
[1:05:19] because it's something that I'm going
[1:05:21] through right now and
[1:05:27] for for like two to three
[1:05:30] years I am absolutely trying to seek God
[1:05:34] there's no lack of me praying or reading
[1:05:36] or whatever I had no joy zero no peace
[1:05:42] it didn't matter where I was on the
[1:05:45] globe what I was doing no peace no
[1:05:50] joy and and you were wondering I tried
[1:05:53] to to fix it with every remedy any
[1:05:58] vitamins the right diet all of it I
[1:06:01] tried to fix what was going on and I
[1:06:03] could not figure out what in the world
[1:06:05] is going on
[1:06:09] and it
[1:06:13] it I wasn't re at the moment I wasn't
[1:06:16] relating I remember in the back of my
[1:06:19] mind it's like go God is going to
[1:06:20] cleanse you you know I had it in the
[1:06:23] back of my mind but I wasn't really
[1:06:24] aware of it in in the moment I wasn't
[1:06:27] feeling like oh God is loving on me
[1:06:29] right now and you know he he's he's he's
[1:06:32] doing
[1:06:34] something at
[1:06:36] all and but what kept me alive and it
[1:06:40] does to you
[1:06:41] too even though in my religious fervor
[1:06:45] and striving and it was a mixture of a
[1:06:48] genuine desire and selfish ambition and
[1:06:52] it was mixture of a lot of things
[1:06:54] but I'm thankful I've I've said it
[1:06:57] before I'm very thankful that I have a
[1:07:00] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:03] the spirit of God inside of me would
[1:07:07] intercede all the time pretty
[1:07:10] profoundly it's actually the only gift
[1:07:13] that I know of that God has giving me
[1:07:15] you know a lot of people are gifted in
[1:07:17] many many many ways like in the natural
[1:07:20] in the spiritual I only that's the only
[1:07:22] gift that I know I have a gift of
[1:07:24] intercession and so when I would go even
[1:07:27] feeling like trash the spirit of God
[1:07:30] would Gran absolutely grown and I would
[1:07:33] be
[1:07:34] broken but I would I could stay in
[1:07:38] prayer for a long time and God would
[1:07:40] just be doing something but but still
[1:07:44] just a temporary
[1:07:52] relief I was reading a book about prayer
[1:07:55] and uh and
[1:07:57] this was one of the quotes and it just
[1:08:00] spoke to me when you think about
[1:08:03] renouncing your own will and embracing
[1:08:05] the will of God let me suggest you bear
[1:08:09] three truths in mind first of all God
[1:08:12] loves you more than you love yourself
[1:08:15] second God understands you better than
[1:08:18] you understand
[1:08:20] yourself and and third God wants only
[1:08:23] the best for you when you truly yield to
[1:08:27] God's will you will discover that it is
[1:08:32] that is what the Bible says is good
[1:08:35] acceptable and
[1:08:38] perfect and sometimes we don't really
[1:08:41] believe
[1:08:42] it when when we're under pressure things
[1:08:45] are not going our way we don't really
[1:08:47] believe it we know it
[1:08:49] here but in here we like we doubt it
[1:08:54] and he knows how to get our
[1:08:56] attention uh even though we don't feel
[1:09:00] like it like he he wants he wants to
[1:09:03] show you that's what I tell my kids
[1:09:08] like God wants you to know that he loves
[1:09:12] you one of the biggest thing that the
[1:09:14] enemy will tell you that God doesn't
[1:09:16] love
[1:09:17] you and he's disappointed with you he
[1:09:20] doesn't like
[1:09:22] you but I'm going to tell you
[1:09:25] something God has gone through a lot of
[1:09:31] trouble both to save
[1:09:33] you and plan your life it's amazing when
[1:09:38] you think about
[1:09:44] it your destiny will cost you
[1:09:47] everything if it does not you may settle
[1:09:49] for good and
[1:09:51] acceptable but it will not be perfect
[1:09:55] and I feel like the
[1:09:57] last two to three years and even before
[1:10:01] that I was in the good and acceptable
[1:10:05] but not in the perfect and and God uses
[1:10:15] it and so I want to talk a a little bit
[1:10:19] about that we all have a specific
[1:10:22] destiny
[1:10:24] and and we did not come up with it it
[1:10:28] was
[1:10:34] God okay Ephesians 1:1 in him also we
[1:10:38] have received an inheritance a destiny
[1:10:42] we were claimed by God as his own having
[1:10:46] being predestinated chosen appointed
[1:10:49] beforehand according to the purpose of
[1:10:51] him who works everything in agreement
[1:10:55] with the councel and design of his
[1:10:59] will for we are his workmanship his own
[1:11:03] master master work a work of art created
[1:11:07] in Christ Jesus reborn from above
[1:11:11] spiritually transformed renewed ready to
[1:11:14] be used for good works which God
[1:11:17] prepared for us
[1:11:19] beforehand taking PATH which he said so
[1:11:23] that we would walk in them living the
[1:11:25] good life which he pre-arranged and made
[1:11:29] ready for
[1:11:30] us one more
[1:11:32] here and he made from one man every
[1:11:35] nation of mankind to live on the face of
[1:11:37] the Earth having determin their
[1:11:40] appointed times and the boundaries of
[1:11:43] their lands and
[1:11:47] territories in Christ your destiny is
[1:11:50] specifically shaped by the council and
[1:11:52] design of his word will amen you are his
[1:11:56] Masterpiece created in Christ for good
[1:11:59] works that were predetermined before
[1:12:03] your birth for you for you to accomplish
[1:12:06] he determined the time in history and
[1:12:09] the location where we would be
[1:12:15] born God is preparing you for a destiny
[1:12:19] in the end times you greatly valued by
[1:12:22] him to the EXT stand that he chose by
[1:12:25] his own counsel for you to be alive in
[1:12:28] this generation this is the generation
[1:12:31] that will witness the completion of
[1:12:32] God's plan we're here to be instruments
[1:12:35] in the greatest Harvest of souls in the
[1:12:38] history of
[1:12:40] mankind that's pretty huge if you think
[1:12:43] about it it's it
[1:12:46] like it is very very big
[1:12:52] amen and so let me
[1:13:04] see I want to talk a little bit about
[1:13:06] just the progression when you receive so
[1:13:10] in the
[1:13:12] beginning when you're born like you
[1:13:15] don't really know what's going on you
[1:13:17] know you don't know what like why you're
[1:13:19] here that you have a destiny that you
[1:13:22] have a purpose you know and it varies
[1:13:25] from from person to person because some
[1:13:28] people they will grow up in a Christian
[1:13:31] family and so they're taught like oh no
[1:13:33] you you you're made in the image and
[1:13:36] likeness of God you have a Destiny and
[1:13:38] some like me you have no
[1:13:41] clue you know you're just living your
[1:13:43] life and you you have no idea what's
[1:13:45] going on you're just trying to
[1:13:49] survive uh and so God is a spirit
[1:13:54] and you can't know him without
[1:13:59] Revelation and you cannot know the the
[1:14:03] specific plan for your life if God
[1:14:06] doesn't reveal it to you you can't just
[1:14:09] come up with it in your own mind it's
[1:14:11] something Sovereign that God does in
[1:14:13] your life you need to be sensitive to
[1:14:16] it you know you you need to you
[1:14:20] know like me I'm I'm very curious
[1:14:25] and but there comes a time that God has
[1:14:30] an appointment with all of us even if
[1:14:32] you're not a
[1:14:33] Christian or if you're a Christian
[1:14:36] everyone has to have an appointment
[1:14:38] where God reveals himself to
[1:14:41] you and it takes the spirit of
[1:14:51] Revelation so he was asking the
[1:14:54] disciples who he was he said to them but
[1:14:57] who do you say that I am I'm not going
[1:14:59] to like tell you the surroundings and
[1:15:02] all of that I have a lot to cover but
[1:15:04] Jesus is asking his disciples that have
[1:15:06] been walking with him like but who do
[1:15:09] you say that I
[1:15:10] am Simon P Simon Peter answered you are
[1:15:15] Christ the son of the Living
[1:15:18] God and Jesus said to him blessed are
[1:15:21] you Thon bonah because Flesh and Blood
[1:15:24] did not re reveal this to you but my
[1:15:27] father who is in
[1:15:30] heaven it it has to come from the
[1:15:36] father that you can see
[1:15:38] Jesus without that you will you can hear
[1:15:41] about Jesus all day long but if it's not
[1:15:44] revealed to you because he's going to
[1:15:46] ask you who do you
[1:15:49] say he is if can you truly say that from
[1:15:54] Revelation that he is the Christ the son
[1:15:57] of the Living God and is he that to you
[1:16:01] personally not just your parents but to
[1:16:04] you
[1:16:11] personally no one can come unto me
[1:16:14] unless the father who sent me draws him
[1:16:18] and I will raise him up in the last day
[1:16:21] it is written in the prophet phets and
[1:16:24] they shall be taught of God everyone who
[1:16:27] has heard and learned from the father
[1:16:30] comes to me amen and so there's a moment
[1:16:33] for ex example in my life that
[1:16:38] this
[1:16:41] happens to
[1:16:43] me and I had no idea that the spirit of
[1:16:47] the father was dealing with me at the
[1:16:50] moment there's just a there's a
[1:16:53] supernatural act of Grace happening in
[1:16:55] my life without me trying
[1:16:58] anything all of a sudden I am
[1:17:02] spiritually awakened to something that I
[1:17:04] have no clue what is what was going on
[1:17:08] and I am delivered from drugs alcohol
[1:17:12] and all kinds of stuff in almost in a
[1:17:16] moment and God then starts to reveal to
[1:17:20] me at that moment who Jesus is and I
[1:17:23] remember at that moment that uh my mind
[1:17:27] was having a hard time to
[1:17:30] comprehend that
[1:17:33] God became a man my mind was just like
[1:17:38] there was something
[1:17:39] just like it's too it's far out because
[1:17:43] when you look at the universe you look
[1:17:45] at just
[1:17:47] creation that that God who created all
[1:17:49] of that became a man but there was
[1:17:53] something on the inside that I could not
[1:17:55] let go and then
[1:17:58] eventually I just accepted
[1:18:01] it and it was the the greatest moment in
[1:18:04] all my life because what happens is like
[1:18:09] depending on where you are in my case
[1:18:12] never feeling accepted loved or whatever
[1:18:16] then all of a sudden oh wow I'm loved by
[1:18:21] God I'm accept it and that is in a
[1:18:26] moment I will never forget life trans
[1:18:29] transforming
[1:18:38] experience and so when you get this
[1:18:42] Revelation that
[1:18:46] Christ became a
[1:18:48] man and you accept it there's something
[1:18:53] profound that
[1:18:55] happens you literally become a new
[1:18:59] creation you're no longer just a son of
[1:19:05] Adam you become a son of the last Adam
[1:19:08] you come a new creation first came the
[1:19:11] natural and then the spiritual all of a
[1:19:14] sudden you are a spiritual son you you
[1:19:18] go from like the kingdom of darkness
[1:19:19] into the Kingdom of Light and everything
[1:19:22] changed your whole perspective about
[1:19:24] life you
[1:19:26] know what what everything is about the
[1:19:29] reason for
[1:19:30] living a reason for
[1:19:33] existence and um and it's it is
[1:19:38] amazing
[1:19:41] because now your priorities change where
[1:19:44] you're going
[1:19:46] change you think
[1:19:49] differently and there's like a there's a
[1:19:51] there's a new nature Within that you had
[1:19:53] no
[1:19:55] idea was
[1:19:57] real and at that moment often in the
[1:20:01] beginning there's like there's there's
[1:20:04] joy there's love there's something
[1:20:06] amazing that happens to you that you had
[1:20:09] never experienced
[1:20:13] before but there's a lot of of stuff
[1:20:17] junk that God needs to deal
[1:20:20] with and I had no idea it would take so
[1:20:24] long like no
[1:20:33] idea therefore if anyone is in Christ he
[1:20:36] is a new creature the old things passed
[1:20:39] away behold new things have
[1:20:47] come but it but may it never be that I
[1:20:50] would boast except in the cross of our
[1:20:53] Lord Jesus Christ through which the
[1:20:55] world has been crucified to me and I to
[1:20:58] the world for neither is circumcision
[1:21:01] anything nor
[1:21:03] uncircumcision but a new
[1:21:07] creation and it's pretty wild would if
[1:21:09] you would say to an unbeliever it's like
[1:21:12] no I'm from another race I'm from
[1:21:14] another
[1:21:15] world but that's reality you are
[1:21:19] literally a new
[1:21:21] creation and everything has become
[1:21:23] new and so when you become a new
[1:21:26] creation and all of a sudden you're
[1:21:28] spiritually awakened then the sense of
[1:21:31] Destiny starts to be awakened within
[1:21:35] you it's then when you're like oh wow
[1:21:38] there is a specific purpose I have a
[1:21:40] father in Heaven and he has a specific
[1:21:42] purpose for my life and so you go on a
[1:21:46] quest I
[1:21:48] did now I'm like oh wow sense of Destiny
[1:21:52] purpose and like I'm like oh let's go
[1:21:54] for it you know and I
[1:21:58] would I would be I would pray a lot
[1:22:01] about it I really
[1:22:03] did and when this is happening I am
[1:22:09] shortly after I get saved what I do I go
[1:22:13] work for a Christian Ministry television
[1:22:15] station in Iceland and that was amazing
[1:22:17] because at that time that television
[1:22:19] network was growing exponentially and
[1:22:22] became one of the biggest Network in
[1:22:24] Iceland and there was a lot of fruit at
[1:22:27] that point in that
[1:22:29] Ministry and and what happened
[1:22:33] was we were getting a lot of phone calls
[1:22:36] people getting healed saved you
[1:22:40] know people dealing with them of
[1:22:43] avoiding
[1:22:44] suicide and it it was remarkable to see
[1:22:47] what was happening and I was so
[1:22:50] excited and but also at the same time so
[1:22:56] what I want to tell you
[1:22:58] here what I'm going to lean into is
[1:23:01] there there was there have been multiple
[1:23:04] things that have been said to me
[1:23:06] personally both in prophetic words in
[1:23:08] dreams in prayer and all of that about
[1:23:12] my purpose and you probably have the
[1:23:14] same thing for you God deals with you
[1:23:17] God gives you a word you read something
[1:23:21] whatever you know and you long to to
[1:23:23] fulfill it there's two
[1:23:26] things that happened to
[1:23:29] me
[1:23:31] that that screamed to me like this is a
[1:23:34] part of your where you're
[1:23:36] born you know that I've never let go off
[1:23:40] and I want to let you know that you need
[1:23:42] to do the when when God makes something
[1:23:45] real to you don't ever let
[1:23:50] go the preparation is is going to be
[1:23:52] longer right and harder than you ever
[1:24:00] imagined and so it's it's the key
[1:24:03] ingredient to to fulfill the purpose of
[1:24:05] your life is not to give up when things
[1:24:08] don't
[1:24:09] look like you thought they were going to
[1:24:13] look um and so I'm going to paint up
[1:24:16] just that I've shared this before I just
[1:24:18] want to paint just a quick picture um
[1:24:21] because I'm going to read quite a bit so
[1:24:25] you have to stay awake I know I'm not
[1:24:28] very Dynamic so just try a little extra
[1:24:31] to like keep yourself
[1:24:34] awake um so I am working at that
[1:24:38] television network and I am filming
[1:24:40] programs called Israel
[1:24:42] today this speaks to me about
[1:24:44] sovereignty what I'm fixing to share
[1:24:46] with you uh
[1:24:51] so brother Olaf who hosted a program
[1:24:54] Israel today in Iceland on the Omega
[1:24:58] television that I work for he goes two
[1:25:01] times a years he has passed away now
[1:25:03] he's with the Lord he he went on average
[1:25:07] on average two times to Israel three
[1:25:10] months at a at a time one of the trip
[1:25:13] 2003 he goes to a meeting that brother
[1:25:16] Shel was preaching
[1:25:18] at and my wife was in that meeting
[1:25:24] too brother Ola comes back home from
[1:25:27] Israel in 2003 he comes to the channel
[1:25:31] and I remember being in the in the
[1:25:33] kitchen at the channel and brother Ola
[1:25:36] is like hey there's this pastor from
[1:25:40] Alabama and he loves the truth that you
[1:25:45] love and he
[1:25:47] loves Jerusalem and the Jewish people
[1:25:51] and all of us we're like oh wow that is
[1:25:53] super
[1:25:54] interesting um I want to tell you also
[1:25:57] in the beginning of my
[1:25:59] journey that you know that God is
[1:26:01] sovereignly like leading you is
[1:26:06] that brother brandham is
[1:26:10] not there's not many message churches or
[1:26:14] message Believers in Iceland would you
[1:26:16] would label a message believer that
[1:26:18] believed the truth that was brought by
[1:26:20] Brother
[1:26:21] RAM and
[1:26:22] and and so what happens to me in in
[1:26:27] Iceland shortly after I'm
[1:26:30] saved I have no clue who brother brandom
[1:26:32] is and I have no clue that there is
[1:26:34] something called the message or any of
[1:26:36] that and I remember I'm walking beside
[1:26:40] some shelves and I pick up a booklet and
[1:26:45] it was printed on pages like this and
[1:26:47] had like a a tan colored Co cover and
[1:26:50] there was nothing to it it did not look
[1:26:53] attractive to the eye but I feel pulled
[1:26:56] to to to take it out of the
[1:26:59] Shelf I take it home to read it and I
[1:27:03] was it was the Supernatural
[1:27:06] series and I remember I'm met my
[1:27:10] grandparents and I read it and I cried
[1:27:14] like a
[1:27:15] baby I go back to the office the the the
[1:27:19] at the television I go back to the
[1:27:21] television office and I was like hey you
[1:27:24] have no idea what I just read and you
[1:27:28] know there's this William Bram and like
[1:27:31] man it's it's incredible and they were
[1:27:34] blown away because I'm like 20 21 22 I
[1:27:39] can't remember exactly because they had
[1:27:41] been heavily persecuted in Iceland for
[1:27:44] mention William Bram all the churches
[1:27:48] hated Eric ericsen the founder and
[1:27:52] really were against him they did not
[1:27:54] like that he had the only television
[1:27:56] network in Iceland and that he believed
[1:27:59] that brother Brandon was a Propet they
[1:28:00] did not like it at all and so they had
[1:28:03] kind of started to go under
[1:28:07] uh just undercover with the message you
[1:28:11] know and so they were not trying to get
[1:28:15] meat to be involved or anything like
[1:28:18] that so they were blown away when I come
[1:28:20] back it's like hey you
[1:28:22] you need to read this thing you know
[1:28:25] that actually excited them anyway and
[1:28:29] so I started listening
[1:28:33] to I'm going to share another story
[1:28:35] related to that real quick
[1:28:40] so when I was
[1:28:43] 14 I think I was
[1:28:46] 14 my dad who didn't was not very
[1:28:49] involved in my life um
[1:28:52] I actually love him a lot today but at
[1:28:55] that moment he was not very involved in
[1:28:57] my life he dared to give me a Bible for
[1:29:01] Christmas when I was
[1:29:04] 14 and I was so
[1:29:07] mad finally he gives me a present and
[1:29:10] it's the Bible you're
[1:29:15] like and so that's that's when I'm 14 I
[1:29:19] don't use that Bible at all
[1:29:22] and I had forgotten what I had done with
[1:29:24] that Bible
[1:29:26] totally and then one
[1:29:31] time after I get saved I get interested
[1:29:34] in in in the
[1:29:36] message brother Eric Ericson gives me a
[1:29:39] huge uh box of cassette tapes from the
[1:29:44] message so I bring that to my
[1:29:46] grandmother like huge box ton of tapes
[1:29:50] but I have nothing to play
[1:29:53] the cassettes nothing to play with it
[1:29:55] like I didn't have a cassette
[1:29:57] player and so I just put it my my my box
[1:30:00] there and like I need to buy a cassette
[1:30:03] player and then because of the
[1:30:06] transformation in my life going like my
[1:30:10] brother saw what happened to me going
[1:30:13] from
[1:30:14] like drug addict
[1:30:18] violent
[1:30:20] just I don't know what
[1:30:22] I didn't do anything that was pleasant
[1:30:24] at that time and I'm not trying to
[1:30:28] elaborate on that that was just how it
[1:30:29] was and my brother was so affected that
[1:30:32] he got on fire for God just seeing my
[1:30:35] transformation so he comes to my
[1:30:37] grandmother and he's like hey because he
[1:30:41] got a Bible too so he comes like maybe
[1:30:45] my Bible
[1:30:46] is somewhere at at in in the basement at
[1:30:49] my
[1:30:50] grandmother's and
[1:30:53] and he and I actually tell him if you go
[1:30:55] down there see if my Bible is there too
[1:30:58] I would love to you know I had no
[1:31:01] idea my brother goes down comes back up
[1:31:04] he's like hey I found my Bible and I was
[1:31:07] like oh no where's you know I got really
[1:31:10] disappointed but there was something in
[1:31:12] me just like no it's there so I go from
[1:31:17] the sixth floor take the elevator down
[1:31:19] and I remember I open the
[1:31:23] door
[1:31:25] um of that little
[1:31:28] room and about 4 feet high there's one
[1:31:32] brown
[1:31:33] box two feet away from the door like the
[1:31:36] first box I see
[1:31:38] just and I opened the
[1:31:42] box there was my Bible that I got when I
[1:31:45] was 14 and a cassette player beside
[1:31:48] it and that was like that spoke to me
[1:31:52] it's still about the sovereignty of
[1:31:55] God and I remember I started listening
[1:31:58] and there was something like there's a
[1:32:00] grace period when you first get saved
[1:32:03] where you just drink and eat and drink
[1:32:07] and
[1:32:08] eat and I would say it's very important
[1:32:11] to utilize that Grace because you don't
[1:32:13] always have
[1:32:15] it but uh God did a lot just to s a lot
[1:32:21] of Truth in my life at that
[1:32:23] time okay
[1:32:27] so brother Olaf so I'm like I I start to
[1:32:32] love to listen to the truth that we of
[1:32:36] all
[1:32:37] cherish and and I actually remember
[1:32:41] going to Pentecostal churches to be
[1:32:44] around other young people just to have
[1:32:47] fellowship and it created a lot of
[1:32:50] controversy
[1:32:53] even so that it was publicly spoken by
[1:32:56] the biggest Pentecostal preacher on
[1:32:59] their website what I was
[1:33:02] doing because everybody's just sharing
[1:33:04] what they love and I didn't know Church
[1:33:07] politics really even though I was
[1:33:08] reading of and so I'm just ignorant like
[1:33:11] just in love with Jesus and it's like oh
[1:33:13] man check this out and they're like
[1:33:17] uhuh and so people went against it
[1:33:20] pretty hard
[1:33:23] okay so here's what
[1:33:25] happens brother Olaf comes back from
[1:33:29] Israel
[1:33:30] and he talks about brother
[1:33:34] Shelly and and I am intrigued he
[1:33:39] loves he he loves God he loves the truth
[1:33:43] that we cherish he love and I because of
[1:33:45] I was always filming Israel today I
[1:33:48] started to love Israel and the Jewish
[1:33:53] people previously I was under the same
[1:33:57] atmosphere as most icelanders
[1:34:01] anti-Semitic no reason no idea why but I
[1:34:05] did not like the Jews I couldn't tell
[1:34:07] you why but that was my just my
[1:34:11] attitude because when your spirit is
[1:34:14] dead and you're just in the atmosphere
[1:34:17] of
[1:34:19] Darkness you get conformed to the dark
[1:34:21] darkness and it's normal to you and you
[1:34:24] have no idea why but when you get from
[1:34:27] the uh kingdom of darkness into the
[1:34:29] kingdom of Life your your things
[1:34:33] change and uh and so me and brother
[1:34:36] Magnuson that worked at the station we
[1:34:38] were very intrigued and I remember uh
[1:34:41] brother Magnuson printed something out
[1:34:44] from the website ral.org
[1:34:47] and I read it and then I went online and
[1:34:52] I
[1:34:53] read some of the transvision that
[1:34:55] brother shalet
[1:34:57] had and that is what triggered me while
[1:35:01] I'm standing in front of you
[1:35:04] today and I don't want to and so because
[1:35:08] I didn't
[1:35:09] see some of that happen over the
[1:35:12] years that is why I got in trouble with
[1:35:16] God I'll elaborate so what I want to do
[1:35:19] right now I want to read quite a bit
[1:35:32] and you have
[1:35:34] to it's so what I'm fixing to read is
[1:35:37] pretty
[1:35:38] epic if just it is to me it's absolutely
[1:35:44] phenomenal it is of a profound nature I
[1:35:48] can't emphasize it emphasize it enough
[1:35:51] and I want to read it and it'll take me
[1:35:53] some
[1:35:54] time but this is this I believe pertains
[1:35:58] to all of us I really
[1:36:05] do okay so brother shell I think this is
[1:36:08] in January of 98 and brother shell is
[1:36:11] taken into the realm of the
[1:36:14] spirit as we were pouring out our hearts
[1:36:17] to him in song I could both feel and
[1:36:19] hear the Lord beoning me
[1:36:22] I willingly went with him into the realm
[1:36:24] of the spirit and saw before me a
[1:36:27] beautiful River covered in a rising Mist
[1:36:31] even through the Mist I could see the
[1:36:33] river bottom as it was not very deep a
[1:36:38] kind Angel stepped up and said only a
[1:36:40] few have ever been called to this place
[1:36:43] I asked where is this place his answer
[1:36:46] seemed a bit strange if you always know
[1:36:49] where each Journey we lead fear will
[1:36:51] attack your faith it is The Great Divide
[1:36:55] he added soon many will stand where only
[1:36:59] a few have previously stood across the
[1:37:02] Mist river is the throne room of the
[1:37:05] most high God he further explained that
[1:37:08] as the seat of God as of the seat of God
[1:37:11] and the throne room Throne from which
[1:37:13] the bloody lamb stepped forth he also
[1:37:17] said all who stand before this Throne
[1:37:19] can say that they have seen the fullness
[1:37:22] of God his word seemed Grand and a bit
[1:37:26] strange to me but it was filled with a
[1:37:29] longing to stand Before the Throne of
[1:37:31] God that I had never known
[1:37:35] before the mist of the thickening and
[1:37:38] Rising the Mist was thickening and
[1:37:41] Rising higher as we stood on the bank as
[1:37:44] though protecting what was on the other
[1:37:46] Shore the angel said to me do not fear
[1:37:49] storms fear storms often arise in the
[1:37:52] middle of the river in the place where
[1:37:55] the waters run cold many have been
[1:37:57] called this far to cross this River but
[1:38:02] have turned back when they fac the
[1:38:04] Blackness of the storms remember many
[1:38:07] are called but only few are
[1:38:11] chosen that actually spoke to me more
[1:38:14] now than ever
[1:38:16] about when things get hard and black and
[1:38:20] you know
[1:38:22] don't go
[1:38:24] back don't give up you feel like it's
[1:38:27] it's not going to happen you feel like
[1:38:28] it's too difficult you're disappointed
[1:38:31] don't don't turn
[1:38:33] back I begin pleading my case before
[1:38:36] this angel in this whole atmosphere I
[1:38:39] quickly realized that I was still
[1:38:41] carrying hurt and unhealed wounds from
[1:38:44] what had gone through what
[1:38:47] had from what we have gone through in
[1:38:49] the ministry I explained my weariness
[1:38:52] and loss and expressed the fear that had
[1:38:55] made it difficult for me to go
[1:38:57] forward what did he say you must run on
[1:39:03] anyway that's where I am right
[1:39:05] now I have to I have to go
[1:39:09] on I asked about some of my companion
[1:39:12] who had become wounded in the fight and
[1:39:14] a few that appeared to be utterly
[1:39:17] defeated he said that not one would be
[1:39:19] lost from God's hand
[1:39:21] and for anyone who would lay down the
[1:39:23] sword there would be three or more
[1:39:25] raised up to take their
[1:39:27] place he also said that a clear
[1:39:29] revelation of God's glory would be
[1:39:31] imparted and a perfect understanding of
[1:39:33] his person and character as well as
[1:39:36] revelatory rituals would flow from his
[1:39:38] throne the bride was being summoned to
[1:39:41] the throne room of lamb I remember when
[1:39:43] I was reading that the first time I was
[1:39:46] like
[1:39:47] whoa I want to I want to go to the
[1:39:50] throne that was just my like I want to
[1:39:52] go there I have to go
[1:39:55] there he was now standing on the other
[1:39:57] side of the river backing me to follow
[1:40:00] he explained that we were being summoned
[1:40:02] to the throne room on the on top of the
[1:40:06] mountain of God across the wide river I
[1:40:08] remember thinking in sounded strange a
[1:40:10] river on top of a mountain but
[1:40:13] understood that this language was not to
[1:40:15] be comp contemplated with an Earthly
[1:40:18] perspective but with a spiritual insight
[1:40:22] Zion the higher spiritual Place
[1:40:24] represent the Throne of God the Abode of
[1:40:27] the fullness of his presence before this
[1:40:30] Throne we experience more of the measure
[1:40:33] of his presence than angels have
[1:40:35] previously brought to us and this full
[1:40:38] manifested Glory requires protocol of
[1:40:41] reverence and deep
[1:40:44] respect the angel said that in order for
[1:40:48] us to move to the throne there would be
[1:40:50] others spiritual Dimensions through with
[1:40:53] through which we must make our
[1:40:56] way this initial Throne Room visitation
[1:40:58] will unfold to you in three parts you
[1:41:00] will not be allowed to go the entire way
[1:41:02] this time as there is a spiritual
[1:41:05] conditioning necessary to become
[1:41:07] acclimated to walk in these higher
[1:41:09] Realms of Glory you must first
[1:41:11] experience the full release of your
[1:41:14] Earthly body I have to be honest I
[1:41:17] always wonder what that
[1:41:18] meant on your next visit you will be
[1:41:21] guided across the Great Divide to the
[1:41:24] far shore of the River from there you
[1:41:27] will catch your first glimpse of the
[1:41:28] Throne of the Lamb you will be permitted
[1:41:31] to come close enough to the throne to
[1:41:33] worship the angel reminded me that I was
[1:41:36] living in a chosen generation that had
[1:41:39] previously received a significant word
[1:41:41] through our
[1:41:43] Prophet excuse me he said that the full
[1:41:46] significance of what what had had been
[1:41:48] delivered in the past generation would
[1:41:51] be further understood by a bridal Throne
[1:41:54] Room company now being prepared so this
[1:41:57] intrigued me quite a bit because I felt
[1:42:00] God supernaturally lead me to brother
[1:42:04] branam and I was really captured by the
[1:42:07] Revelation that I was
[1:42:08] reading and now I felt like okay there's
[1:42:11] some kind of a continuation going on in
[1:42:13] my time that's what it really intrigued
[1:42:17] me the angel told me to tell the people
[1:42:19] to prepare their Hearts to stand in the
[1:42:21] throne room a new move sorry a new and
[1:42:26] more glorious strength the strength and
[1:42:28] might of the Lord would be released to
[1:42:30] them this would cause the transition
[1:42:33] from knowing god to having the character
[1:42:36] of God being like him every answer to
[1:42:41] every question lies in this place before
[1:42:43] the throne I have a lot of questions and
[1:42:47] I want some
[1:42:48] answers as we learn the bright access to
[1:42:51] the throne room in the end time we will
[1:42:53] be able to move in and out of this realm
[1:42:55] spiritually whenever I need Rises she
[1:42:58] will then go forth with the covering of
[1:43:01] seven spirits of God as I narrated aloud
[1:43:05] to those in the room with me while my
[1:43:07] spirit was in trans a prophecy began to
[1:43:10] flow out of my
[1:43:12] mouth for even as aser was summoned
[1:43:15] Before the Throne in a pleasurable robes
[1:43:18] to please the king I will also extend my
[1:43:22] scepter of favor upon those who are
[1:43:24] being called forward and upward in this
[1:43:27] hour she must come fully clothed in
[1:43:29] Robes of praise and worship for this is
[1:43:33] the atmosphere of my throne room when I
[1:43:36] have given her my accepter of favor my
[1:43:39] kingdom will be at her command even as
[1:43:42] it has been at my command she will exit
[1:43:46] from me with Throne Room favor when she
[1:43:49] steps forth from this place she will
[1:43:51] lead and not cower cower cower she will
[1:43:56] speak and the host of heaven will hasten
[1:43:59] to carry out her request she will become
[1:44:02] one with me and I will
[1:44:05] instinctively instinctively know my will
[1:44:08] and desire for all things and she will
[1:44:11] only speak in agreement with that she
[1:44:13] will walk with courage and strength in
[1:44:15] the revelation of her
[1:44:17] identity and never again question her
[1:44:20] position in
[1:44:21] me I have to be honest I've actually on
[1:44:24] my journey even with profound spiritual
[1:44:27] experiences not
[1:44:30] profound even with very personal
[1:44:32] experiences that are real to
[1:44:35] me
[1:44:38] um I have often questioned my
[1:44:41] identity sometime I'm like oh I God
[1:44:44] loves me more than anybody he is just he
[1:44:47] loves
[1:44:48] me yeah I'm I'm absolutely
[1:44:51] and then the next one is
[1:44:52] like am I'm going to be a Judas am I
[1:44:55] going to betray him
[1:44:59] like and so God doesn't want you to be
[1:45:02] in in a limbo like
[1:45:05] oh but you know what I do when I
[1:45:09] question my identity I'll go on my
[1:45:12] knees even when I don't feel like it and
[1:45:16] I tell them I believe you Jesus
[1:45:19] Christ and you died for my
[1:45:22] sins you are my father and and I speak
[1:45:27] the truth that I know our
[1:45:29] true and that's how I
[1:45:36] survived so you can see that
[1:45:41] um you can see that why brother Shel
[1:45:45] emphasizes praise and worship it's a
[1:45:49] it's so vital
[1:45:51] to enter into the Throne of
[1:45:54] God and that's why the enemy fights you
[1:45:57] to worship amen he doesn't want you to
[1:46:00] feel his presence he doesn't want you to
[1:46:02] feel love and he does not want you to go
[1:46:04] there at
[1:46:05] all that's why it is a fight and
[1:46:10] I'm not I'm not going to say proud
[1:46:14] um
[1:46:16] thankful that brother Shel is able to
[1:46:18] strive and fight for it and not give up
[1:46:22] you know keeping keeping that truth
[1:46:25] before the
[1:46:26] people because when you enter into true
[1:46:31] worship it is the best feeling in the
[1:46:34] whole world you forget about yourself
[1:46:37] your spirit is one with with God and it
[1:46:40] it is it is just
[1:46:43] amazing I know this is going to sound a
[1:46:46] little bit weird because it felt weird
[1:46:49] in the beginning when it it came to me
[1:46:52] but this
[1:46:54] prophecy I was one time
[1:46:58] reading this reminding me like why am I
[1:47:02] here why am I in Alabama why did I come
[1:47:05] here so I read this things often to
[1:47:07] remind
[1:47:08] me and and this Pro so at that this
[1:47:13] particular
[1:47:14] time mirabeth was carrying a
[1:47:17] baby a little girl
[1:47:20] and I was reading and it came to me you
[1:47:23] should name your baby girl
[1:47:28] eser and that's what and I was like no
[1:47:31] it's weird I don't want to get that from
[1:47:34] a prophecy that's like I don't know it
[1:47:36] just felt weird to me but I couldn't get
[1:47:38] away from it I could not get away from
[1:47:41] it and so I prayed and because Aster is
[1:47:43] not really a Hebrew
[1:47:45] name like I I didn't have like 100%
[1:47:49] peace about it
[1:47:51] but I could not get away from
[1:47:53] it the more I prayed the more convinced
[1:47:56] I was her name is s and then I don't
[1:48:01] think I originally told marbeth that's
[1:48:04] how I
[1:48:05] got the
[1:48:07] quickening but we talked about
[1:48:11] it and we agreed to name
[1:48:15] ASAS and then when the pregnancy goes
[1:48:19] along I'm realizing ah she might be born
[1:48:24] around
[1:48:26] Purim and then meab was starting to have
[1:48:29] some complications it was like no that
[1:48:33] it's probably not going to
[1:48:35] happen but right after midnight Midnight
[1:48:39] on
[1:48:40] puim the water breaks and we run to the
[1:48:45] hospital and Esther was born on
[1:48:48] porum and to me God was dealing with me
[1:48:51] okay first at least you can sometimes
[1:48:55] hear
[1:48:55] me but
[1:48:59] also what he showed me in the beginning
[1:49:02] that this is
[1:49:04] real it really is
[1:49:06] real and we cannot
[1:49:10] accomplish okay let me just talk about
[1:49:13] me I don't have the ability to be a tool
[1:49:19] in the hand of God In My Own Strength my
[1:49:23] identity it has to be something of that
[1:49:28] nature it has to be where you can you
[1:49:31] never doubt who you are you go forth in
[1:49:34] his Spirit his
[1:49:37] strength not my idea or my
[1:49:44] agenda I'm going to read just a little
[1:49:46] bit from the next transvision not this
[1:49:48] much much less
[1:49:56] um but I'm telling you when when I read
[1:49:59] that I've had mult like you all of us
[1:50:03] have prophetic words over us we' have
[1:50:06] had dreams like literal
[1:50:08] dreams but not my spirit responded to
[1:50:12] that more than anything else it screamed
[1:50:16] this is your
[1:50:18] destiny and it was it it it affected me
[1:50:21] so much
[1:50:24] that I begged the owner of the
[1:50:28] television network to invite brother
[1:50:31] Shelly not
[1:50:33] realizing that Perry green at the tucon
[1:50:36] Tabernacle had talked about Eric Ericson
[1:50:39] in Iceland years
[1:50:43] before and so I am begging him and then
[1:50:47] you know brother Shel gets a ton of
[1:50:49] invitation all the
[1:50:51] time and so but when he heard that name
[1:50:56] and Eric Ericson calls he immediately
[1:50:59] came that's how this connection came you
[1:51:02] know and
[1:51:06] uh and I can't because this was so loud
[1:51:11] and clear in my spirit this is a part of
[1:51:14] your destiny this is the part of where
[1:51:15] you're born it's the end time move of
[1:51:18] God
[1:51:20] and I don't believe that's only going to
[1:51:22] happen here not at all it's going to
[1:51:25] happen all
[1:51:26] over but it was for me and for
[1:51:32] you this is
[1:51:34] here not saying that God can't transfer
[1:51:37] you I'm not you know I don't have to be
[1:51:40] if God wants me to be somewhere but I
[1:51:42] can't go somewhere else but God doesn't
[1:51:43] tell me that is
[1:51:46] rebellion it really
[1:51:48] is
[1:51:56] okay I'm going to just a little bit more
[1:52:06] of so this happens I think just a few
[1:52:09] months after the uh the one that I just
[1:52:13] shared with
[1:52:14] you and I'm I'm I don't want to read too
[1:52:17] much so I shorten it he's in a he he is
[1:52:21] taken back to the river and this time
[1:52:24] he's he crosses the river I then asked
[1:52:27] my angel guide if he knew why I had been
[1:52:29] summoned he responded because he knew
[1:52:32] that you would tell of all that you see
[1:52:34] and hear he also explained that the
[1:52:37] Heavenly Host Knew by my coming that
[1:52:40] greater access to Heavenly realm Realms
[1:52:43] was being given to the bride which was a
[1:52:46] clear indication that the Final Chapter
[1:52:48] was approaching
[1:52:50] the bride will be given training
[1:52:53] strength and Supernatural wisdom as she
[1:52:55] spends time in Heavenly places I knew
[1:52:59] that the bride would gain certain things
[1:53:01] only by moving in and out of this
[1:53:03] spiritual
[1:53:04] Dimensions she would learn so much more
[1:53:08] about the character and the heartbeat of
[1:53:09] the Lamb by abiding in the atmosphere
[1:53:12] highly charged with Glory this would
[1:53:15] help to prepare her for her final work
[1:53:18] this equipment would also enable the
[1:53:20] bride to move in greatest fears of
[1:53:23] authority tearing down strongholds and
[1:53:26] bringing Deliverance to those previously
[1:53:29] considered the hard
[1:53:32] cases
[1:53:35] and so who who knows what Roland and
[1:53:40] Heidi beger
[1:53:43] are Irish Ministries okay there are
[1:53:47] missionaries in musm Beek the
[1:53:50] grandfather of Roland
[1:53:52] Baker was a missionary in China Visions
[1:53:55] be beyond the veils anybody read Visions
[1:53:58] beyond the
[1:54:01] veils it's profound so there's an
[1:54:04] orphanage in China Bo orphanage and in
[1:54:10] what happened in the early 1900 I can't
[1:54:13] remember exactly something similar to
[1:54:16] what we are reading here the boys young
[1:54:20] boys were taken up in
[1:54:23] transis to the throne
[1:54:25] room very ignorant a lot of them totally
[1:54:29] ignorant of the Bible were were able to
[1:54:31] describe biblical truth about hell about
[1:54:34] judgment about New Jerusalem in details
[1:54:38] and then they came down and they were
[1:54:41] they were had unprecedented anointing
[1:54:44] and authority to to reach
[1:54:48] people totally
[1:54:50] Supernatural and so the grandson of that
[1:54:54] missionary I think
[1:54:56] it's
[1:54:58] Arthur I can't remember no h Harold
[1:55:02] Harold beger was the missionary in
[1:55:04] China the grandson of
[1:55:07] Herold he is a missionary in mosm Beek
[1:55:11] and heid
[1:55:12] beggar and I'm reading a book called
[1:55:14] birthing the miraculous I read a
[1:55:17] lot and and it's actually a profound
[1:55:21] book and what there was something
[1:55:23] interesting that that spoke to me
[1:55:25] concerning this of not giving up
[1:55:31] because it took 20 years to get they
[1:55:34] were on the mission field for 20 years
[1:55:37] and they were about to give up run down
[1:55:40] wore out and none nothing happening I
[1:55:44] think they had three
[1:55:45] churches not that great
[1:55:48] churches in in mosm Beek they had been
[1:55:51] giving amazing promises for mosm Beek
[1:55:55] that God was going to give them the
[1:55:57] nation God was going to do the
[1:55:59] impossible through
[1:56:00] them but after 20 years they like their
[1:56:06] words like we're going to give up we
[1:56:08] can't do
[1:56:10] this and then in one
[1:56:14] year I there everything
[1:56:18] changed
[1:56:21] one natural disaster happened in mosm
[1:56:23] Beek almost half a million people lost
[1:56:26] their
[1:56:27] home and that Ministry Irish Ministries
[1:56:32] went from three churches the details may
[1:56:35] be wrong so don't quote me but from
[1:56:38] three churches to thousands of
[1:56:41] churches they had been praying for the
[1:56:44] sick for the blind for the deaf for
[1:56:47] years because they were told
[1:56:50] this is you're going to heal the sick
[1:56:52] the no
[1:56:55] Miracles nothing happened dead but they
[1:56:59] kept
[1:56:59] praying and then they prayed
[1:57:03] again now it's a daily
[1:57:05] occurrence today it's tens of thousands
[1:57:08] of
[1:57:09] churches Total
[1:57:11] Transformation the like what they're
[1:57:13] doing is incredible but I was thinking
[1:57:16] the same thing with with this what God
[1:57:19] was making real to me here you you feel
[1:57:22] like oh it's not going to happen you you
[1:57:26] your your faith grows cold
[1:57:31] and but you can't give up because in the
[1:57:35] one moment thinking absolutely
[1:57:39] shift but you will not be a part of it
[1:57:41] if you back
[1:57:43] out
[1:57:47] and I'm I'm GNA try to hurry
[1:57:50] because I'm going to shift into
[1:57:51] something else so I started with God
[1:57:54] being disciplining
[1:57:57] you what I what happened to
[1:57:59] me so let me just make God wants you to
[1:58:03] be successful I absolutely believe that
[1:58:06] God wants to bless you God wants good
[1:58:09] things for your
[1:58:10] life and but what happened to me like I
[1:58:16] got a little
[1:58:18] bit
[1:58:20] disappointed slowly but surely just a
[1:58:23] little bit you know
[1:58:26] and when when something that you believe
[1:58:29] with all of your heart all you you you
[1:58:32] you move to another nation and you just
[1:58:35] you are you're so invested in it you're
[1:58:37] so hopeful hopeful and but it it the
[1:58:41] things don't transpire like you expect
[1:58:42] them
[1:58:44] to you start to
[1:58:46] die I did I started to die and what what
[1:58:50] do I do I'm going to come up with an
[1:58:54] idea to make things my destiny happen
[1:58:57] because God had made two things real to
[1:58:59] me about my
[1:59:01] destiny it was to help I feel like with
[1:59:06] a Christian television n in Iceland I
[1:59:08] don't know exactly how it's going to
[1:59:09] look like or anything but it was really
[1:59:11] real to me and then being here and being
[1:59:15] prepared forever what God has for
[1:59:18] me you know in a supernatural
[1:59:21] way both of those and through dreams
[1:59:25] about the
[1:59:27] Omega there were things that God I
[1:59:29] thought really spoke to me very clear
[1:59:32] but then I was like no things are not
[1:59:34] really going to happen like I envisioned
[1:59:37] them and so what happened is like uh I
[1:59:42] go and I wanted to make things happen in
[1:59:46] Iceland in My Own Strength not really
[1:59:50] making any plans but in my heart I'm
[1:59:54] like I'm I'm
[1:59:56] losing vision of what God Made Real to
[2:00:01] me and what was what was worse is like
[2:00:06] my the joy of my salvation was
[2:00:11] gone
[2:00:13] and the old so here's the crazy thing
[2:00:16] we're we're crazy people
[2:00:20] I I was going to go to Iceland and do
[2:00:23] Christian
[2:00:25] Media but I had no no like genuine
[2:00:30] desire to see the Lost
[2:00:34] saved I'm just going to but I had an
[2:00:37] agenda because I felt like God wanted me
[2:00:39] in media and and you're going to go with
[2:00:41] that but the heart for the people wasn't
[2:00:46] there you know you're just in a a
[2:00:49] religious strive fervor that isn't real
[2:00:53] and that's
[2:00:54] torture it really
[2:00:57] is and so and I'm praying all the time
[2:01:00] and also this just the intimacy that I
[2:01:02] used to have with God had diminished
[2:01:05] that I'm always
[2:01:07] praying but there's this feeling of
[2:01:09] being
[2:01:10] loved and allowing God to love you and
[2:01:13] then love others that was just getting
[2:01:17] really numb and that was extremely
[2:01:21] uncomfortable and so two years ago when
[2:01:24] God told me like hey I'm going to
[2:01:27] cleanse you like the prophets of
[2:01:29] old he was going to answer my prayers
[2:01:33] because I always prayed I I have for
[2:01:36] years I want a clean
[2:01:39] heart the most uncomfortable thing is
[2:01:42] when you feel like your heart is not
[2:01:44] pure it is
[2:01:46] torture and I know also was always
[2:01:49] praying I want God's perfect
[2:01:52] will but at the same time I'm
[2:01:56] just inwardly going in a different
[2:02:00] direction and then God comes
[2:02:04] along because he loves you and he hears
[2:02:07] your
[2:02:15] prayers okay I'm going to
[2:02:17] read
[2:02:19] uh a few
[2:02:21] verses before
[2:02:32] closing therefore since we have such
[2:02:36] okay therefore since we have a great
[2:02:38] cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us
[2:02:41] also lay aside every encumbrance and the
[2:02:45] sin which so easily entangles us and let
[2:02:48] us run with an endurance the race that
[2:02:51] is set before us
[2:02:53] endurance we need
[2:02:55] endurance oh
[2:02:58] and these cloud of witnesses that are
[2:03:00] talking
[2:03:02] about their life was pretty rough and a
[2:03:05] lot of the things that they had to
[2:03:06] accomplish took a long
[2:03:14] time and they without us are not perfect
[2:03:20] they we are
[2:03:21] cooperating with some incredible people
[2:03:25] and
[2:03:27] Angels fixing our eyes on Jesus the
[2:03:31] author and the perfector of of Faith who
[2:03:34] for the joy sat before him endured the
[2:03:36] cross despising the shame and has sat
[2:03:40] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[2:03:42] God this is a
[2:03:44] key to endure the race when you fix your
[2:03:48] eyes on him because he endured the cross
[2:03:52] and when you go in a
[2:03:54] rut and you feel like you
[2:03:56] failed you feel shame in all your
[2:04:01] mistakes then this becomes real to
[2:04:07] you I like I have cried and begged and
[2:04:13] tell God God I'm so sorry I was so wrong
[2:04:17] I can't believe I put myself in this
[2:04:20] condition I and you know what happens
[2:04:24] you go back to the
[2:04:27] basics you just start to appreciate what
[2:04:30] God has done for
[2:04:31] you and out of
[2:04:33] that some genuine love for God and for
[2:04:38] other
[2:04:40] people it's it's not all the exra go
[2:04:43] going with your selfish selfish ambition
[2:04:46] your
[2:04:47] agenda you can't accomplish anything it
[2:04:51] is the Simplicity Simplicity simplic I
[2:04:55] have a hard hard done with that word
[2:04:57] it's just being devoted to
[2:05:02] God and just just love
[2:05:05] him and the and and
[2:05:08] also when that happens when you truly
[2:05:11] feel regret and sorry is also Allowing
[2:05:15] God to love you back because if you
[2:05:18] don't allow God to love you back youve
[2:05:20] nothing to give to your
[2:05:24] neighbor for consider him who has
[2:05:27] endured such hostility by Sinners
[2:05:29] against himself so that you will not
[2:05:31] grow weary and lose heart you have not
[2:05:35] yet resisted to the point of shedding
[2:05:37] blood in your striving against sin and
[2:05:41] you have forgotten the exhortation which
[2:05:43] addresses to you as Sons my son do not
[2:05:48] regard like L the discipline of the Lord
[2:05:50] nor faint when you are reproved by
[2:05:54] him
[2:05:56] like I've never been reproved as of
[2:05:59] lately never I've gone through ups and
[2:06:02] downs and God deals with me but nothing
[2:06:04] like
[2:06:05] lately and sometimes you feel like I I
[2:06:08] I'm not going to
[2:06:10] survive it's like I'm too too many
[2:06:14] mistakes it's
[2:06:16] not but you have not not I Promise You
[2:06:20] For Those whom the Lord loves he
[2:06:22] disciplines and he scorches every son
[2:06:25] whom he
[2:06:26] receives it is for discipline that you
[2:06:29] endure God deals with you as with sons
[2:06:32] for what son is there whom his father
[2:06:35] does not
[2:06:36] discipline but if you are without
[2:06:38] discipline of which all have become
[2:06:41] partakers then you you are illegit
[2:06:46] illegitimate children and not Sons
[2:06:50] furthermore we have we had Earthly
[2:06:53] fathers to discipline us and we
[2:06:55] respected them shall we not much rather
[2:06:58] be subject to the father of spirits and
[2:07:03] live for they disciplined us for a short
[2:07:06] time as seemed best to them but he
[2:07:09] disciplines us for our good so that we
[2:07:13] may share his
[2:07:17] holiness that it that is powerful if you
[2:07:22] think about it to sear in the Holiness
[2:07:25] of
[2:07:28] God all discipline for the moment seems
[2:07:30] not to be joyful but sorrowful that's
[2:07:33] for sure yet to those who have been
[2:07:36] trained by it afterwards it yields the
[2:07:39] peaceful fruit of righteousness that's
[2:07:42] where I'm after right now peaceful fruit
[2:07:47] of righteousness where you are just at
[2:07:50] rest not in your
[2:07:56] strive I am the true wine and my father
[2:07:59] is the wine
[2:08:00] dresser every branch in me that does not
[2:08:04] bear fruit he takes away and every
[2:08:07] branch that bears fruit he prunes it so
[2:08:09] that it may be be so it may bear more
[2:08:13] fruit so the purpose of him pruning you
[2:08:16] is so you can fulfill yeah for fruit
[2:08:20] fulfill whatever God has for your
[2:08:23] life so the promises of God can come
[2:08:27] into
[2:08:28] reality that's the love of
[2:08:31] God but for us we have to say
[2:08:34] yes there's something in me is like that
[2:08:38] doesn't like want to
[2:08:40] cooperate because it's so
[2:08:43] uncomfortable but it's the only way for
[2:08:46] every believer that's right
[2:09:02] let me ask you a question it's it's it's
[2:09:04] a trick
[2:09:06] question who wants to follow the
[2:09:10] lord
[2:09:16] okay then Jesus said to his disciples if
[2:09:19] anyone wishes to come after me he must
[2:09:22] deny himself and take up his cross and
[2:09:26] follow
[2:09:27] me for whoever wishes to save his life
[2:09:30] will lose it but whoever loses his life
[2:09:33] for my sake will find
[2:09:34] it for what will it profit a man if he
[2:09:38] gains the whole world and for forfeits
[2:09:41] his soul or what will man give in
[2:09:44] exchange for his soul this is where God
[2:09:47] was dealing with me
[2:09:49] is I
[2:09:50] was I was trying to save my
[2:09:53] life I wanted a little bit of
[2:09:56] Independence I wanted to be like oh it's
[2:09:59] it's it's time for you now to really
[2:10:01] grow up and be be a man and do
[2:10:04] something that that was my like I
[2:10:08] Justified it in my mind I mean that
[2:10:09] sounds right and I was just like and I
[2:10:13] can like I have some things that God
[2:10:16] wants to do in I I wasn't moving to
[2:10:17] Iceland full time at all that was not my
[2:10:20] plan but there was things that I wanted
[2:10:22] to do there and I was just going to make
[2:10:24] it happen but still being completely num
[2:10:27] numb and empty because when when I
[2:10:32] realized what was going
[2:10:35] on okay let me go I'm almost then let me
[2:10:40] when I realiz here's what would
[2:10:42] happened in beginning of December just
[2:10:45] at the start of December God
[2:10:49] show me it's like I there was a light
[2:10:52] bulb that
[2:10:53] came and I and I go to Marth and tell
[2:10:57] her like hey I know why everything is
[2:10:59] crumbling underneath me it's real it's
[2:11:03] like you because because I stopped
[2:11:04] paying attention of what was going on
[2:11:08] right here and I tell her
[2:11:11] that and I become so uneasy almost to
[2:11:16] like I would walk and feel sick in my
[2:11:18] stomach I would be walking here on the
[2:11:20] campground and it was so uncomfortable I
[2:11:24] been i' had been feeling uneasy for a
[2:11:25] long
[2:11:26] time with what I was doing and and then
[2:11:31] December I had couple of dreams that was
[2:11:35] warning me what was going on in my
[2:11:38] life and so and then out of
[2:11:41] that
[2:11:43] like
[2:11:45] I stopped what I was doing doing as for
[2:11:49] making a living and what I was doing in
[2:11:53] my life it and God was working on both
[2:11:57] parties
[2:12:01] and and I knew what was going on was God
[2:12:05] with every fiber of my being it was
[2:12:09] God and but at the same time it was
[2:12:13] absolutely
[2:12:15] terrifying like what am I going to do
[2:12:18] like how do I move forward like how do
[2:12:20] you take care of your family D and it
[2:12:24] was it was so painful because the the
[2:12:27] unknown and the uncertainties are very
[2:12:31] uncomfortable but at the same time God
[2:12:35] was in all of
[2:12:37] it and and so you God it was I felt the
[2:12:42] resistance of God for a long
[2:12:45] time God was actually blessing me on
[2:12:47] multiple levels but no peaceful fruit of
[2:12:52] righteousness it didn't
[2:12:55] exist but external seemed
[2:12:58] okay
[2:13:01] and and then God started dealing with me
[2:13:05] about
[2:13:06] like so you were absolutely a
[2:13:11] nobody I reveal myself to you I go into
[2:13:15] all this trouble to send you to Alabama
[2:13:18] and make something so real to you and
[2:13:21] then you're just going to give
[2:13:23] up that's a little bit offensive you
[2:13:26] know who am
[2:13:29] I and and then God started to renew hope
[2:13:32] within me it's like all the promises of
[2:13:35] God they take a long time a lot of
[2:13:41] preparation and so and then he showed me
[2:13:44] he like uh what if I ever go back to
[2:13:49] Iceland like in the summer or something
[2:13:52] what has to happen what is birth here
[2:13:55] this is what actually God showed me
[2:13:57] originally I'm just I'm not saying it is
[2:14:01] God it's I think it's God what I feel
[2:14:04] like what was going to happen here what
[2:14:07] would be birthed
[2:14:10] here I could then carry something to
[2:14:14] Iceland I you can't go some like you
[2:14:17] can't just beat defeated here and then
[2:14:19] tried to do something somewhere
[2:14:21] else it doesn't make any
[2:14:24] sense and so now God is telling me like
[2:14:29] with with with
[2:14:32] this with the studio with Iceland with
[2:14:35] Israel everything it' be like renewed
[2:14:39] hope it's going to
[2:14:42] happen and I'm super excited about
[2:14:46] it the M mus musicians can
[2:14:53] come and
[2:14:55] so when God no when God when brother
[2:14:59] Shel asked me to speak I was like I'm
[2:15:01] not in a
[2:15:02] place to
[2:15:05] speak but and then I just like I have to
[2:15:10] do
[2:15:10] it and I just want to encourage you if
[2:15:14] there's it it's it doesn't matter matter
[2:15:18] how it looks
[2:15:21] like and often God just wants you to
[2:15:24] come
[2:15:28] back to the
[2:15:31] cross and it's not just a Bible
[2:15:35] story but it's like it's it's the power
[2:15:39] of the Cross it's there where he
[2:15:41] purchased you and redeemed you cleansed
[2:15:46] you and then you are able when that is
[2:15:50] real all the
[2:15:52] shame all the
[2:15:56] mistakes like you feel like they're
[2:15:59] mocking you right now staring you in the
[2:16:02] face and is very
[2:16:04] uncomfortable but then you
[2:16:06] appreciate that he has already dealt
[2:16:08] with
[2:16:09] it and you have the
[2:16:12] ability to put it on
[2:16:14] him and out of that a genuine
[2:16:18] love and compassion for others is is
[2:16:24] born
[2:16:25] and and I feel
[2:16:29] like God wants to take you away from me
[2:16:33] a re religious rut and so he shakes you
[2:16:39] up and and I'm just I'm I'm I'm
[2:16:43] thankful right now I'm so
[2:16:46] thankful
[2:16:48] but it's been last few weeks have been
[2:16:50] probably the hardest weeks of my entire
[2:16:56] existence but it was the only way for
[2:16:59] him to get my
[2:17:16] attention
[2:17:18] here something
[2:17:24] also
[2:17:28] um one time I had a dream and I think I
[2:17:32] shared a little bit I didn't elaborate
[2:17:34] on it that has kept me going for for
[2:17:40] years when brother brandham came to me
[2:17:43] in a dream and was praying about my
[2:17:46] destiny
[2:17:49] the only thing he said to me was
[2:17:50] Alabaster
[2:17:54] Box and of course what I
[2:17:58] do I bought all the books I could on
[2:18:00] Alabaster
[2:18:02] Box and I read everything that brother
[2:18:04] Brandon talked about
[2:18:07] it but that's that's my biggest calling
[2:18:10] in
[2:18:12] life and I think it's yours
[2:18:14] too it's to minister to God
[2:18:20] yes and it and in one thing when he
[2:18:25] talked there was a a group of people
[2:18:28] said like hey didn't we prophesy in your
[2:18:30] name didn't we heal your name preach in
[2:18:33] your name and it's like I never knew
[2:18:37] you if you never open up yourself before
[2:18:41] God he knows everything about you but
[2:18:44] that's one of the biggest thing that we
[2:18:46] can prepare in this hour is to minister
[2:18:50] to
[2:18:51] God and open up your broken
[2:18:56] life open up your soul and and be
[2:19:00] completely
[2:19:03] transparent you don't just do it with
[2:19:05] your problems you
[2:19:07] also you pour out your
[2:19:10] affection this is the only way for God
[2:19:13] to know you in a personal
[2:19:16] way
[2:19:18] he is not after your
[2:19:20] performance or your
[2:19:23] ability he's after something much deeper
[2:19:27] he's jealous over your
[2:19:29] destiny but more importantly he's
[2:19:31] jealous over your heart and he wants you
[2:19:35] to be
[2:19:41] okay we can stand up I think he's going
[2:19:44] to sing a few
[2:19:46] songs
[2:19:52] you are not a God
[2:19:56] created by human hands you are not a god
[2:20:03] depend on anymal man you are not a God

[2:30:32] anybody here dealing with like anxiety
[2:30:35] or depression that you just can't
[2:30:39] shake if
[2:30:41] you and you need an
[2:30:45] assist
[2:30:48] good did you want to
[2:30:54] [Music]
[2:31:09] [Music]
[2:31:14] say my heart is just pounding to say
[2:31:18] this because it fits right
[2:31:20] in and that is to go back to the time
[2:31:25] because you mentioned
[2:31:27] mosambique and Malawi or no you didn't
[2:31:30] mention Mala but the Bakers
[2:31:33] Etc but 30 years ago brother Shelly had
[2:31:38] a
[2:31:39] vision and that was on the 21st of July
[2:31:44] 93 it was a Tuesday night night and all
[2:31:47] of a sudden he looked up at the back of
[2:31:50] the church right above the door there
[2:31:52] was a map of
[2:31:55] Africa and he saw that the fire of God
[2:31:59] had come it started like a flame in the
[2:32:03] uh he didn't know where it was located
[2:32:06] he had to even go and look it up on the
[2:32:08] map and find it exactly and it was in
[2:32:12] the mosambique Mala area and that is
[2:32:17] where the fire of God
[2:32:19] started and then from there it moved to
[2:32:23] South
[2:32:25] Africa and it covered all of South
[2:32:28] Africa and from there it went right over
[2:32:32] and covered the uh
[2:32:34] entire um area of all of Africa it
[2:32:39] started there South Africa and um and so
[2:32:45] I've always pondered that and so when
[2:32:49] brother Arnaldo was here yeah and it was
[2:32:54] on the six six of October we had those
[2:32:57] special meetings and
[2:33:00] after uh when we ate there
[2:33:04] I went over to them and I said you're
[2:33:07] from South Africa and I just told them
[2:33:09] about that
[2:33:12] vision and you know yesterday I thought
[2:33:15] about this and it happened exactly when
[2:33:18] I spoke to them that was when all those
[2:33:21] things were happening in
[2:33:23] Israel you know because that started on
[2:33:26] the 7th that Massacre that took place so
[2:33:30] all of these you know many times there
[2:33:32] are so many different connections yes
[2:33:35] and um that Vision about South Africa in
[2:33:40] 2017 we had a prayer meeting over here
[2:33:44] and brother ryers was here
[2:33:47] and um I remember you know the different
[2:33:50] ones were praying and I want to the
[2:33:54] front and before I realized I told that
[2:33:58] Vision about South Africa and while I
[2:34:01] did Brother Shelly had the same vision
[2:34:03] again he saw it again and so all I want
[2:34:07] to say is there are things moving now
[2:34:10] that happened 30 years
[2:34:12] ago and there are connections there are
[2:34:15] so many things and we need to take heed
[2:34:19] because we have to be
[2:34:22] obedient and uh I think there are things
[2:34:25] starting to happen now even in South
[2:34:27] Africa and God wants to be very you know
[2:34:30] to be mindful and this church has a lot
[2:34:33] of connections that we need to pull
[2:34:36] forward and that's all I wanted to do is
[2:34:39] just to remind the people and speak that
[2:34:41] that we believe what the Lord has showed
[2:34:44] and that we want to walk there
[2:34:47] [Music]
[2:34:58] yeah I believe we're about to step into
[2:35:01] something
[2:35:02] extraordinary uh I don't know I don't
[2:35:05] know how it's going to look
[2:35:07] like I don't know if we're going to see
[2:35:09] everything that I just read to you I
[2:35:12] don't know how it's going to look like
[2:35:14] but the Bible says we're seated together
[2:35:16] in Heavenly places so your spirit right
[2:35:19] now is in another dimension and you can
[2:35:22] be receiving something in the realm of
[2:35:25] the spirit and you can be sometimes
[2:35:27] unaware of
[2:35:28] it and uh there are Supernatural Play
[2:35:31] Supernatural things transpires in a
[2:35:34] meeting like this that's why it is
[2:35:37] important that there is a good
[2:35:38] atmosphere and your mind off that needs
[2:35:40] to be in a in a good
[2:35:42] frame not you know not close push
[2:35:46] yourself
[2:35:47] off and I often have been guilty it's
[2:35:50] like you you're in a rut and so you just
[2:35:52] do the same thing over and over you know
[2:35:55] so it take it can take a discipline and
[2:35:58] to always be in the right frame of mind
[2:36:01] so you can receive something for
[2:36:04] yourself because often if you don't you
[2:36:08] end up just going too far you you close
[2:36:11] your mind you close your heart for too
[2:36:13] long and then it's like
[2:36:17] it's almost too late not that you're
[2:36:19] like lost or something but you you could
[2:36:22] go in a a direction that was not meant
[2:36:25] for
[2:36:27] you and remind yourself it is extremely
[2:36:35] difficult one time I'm not saying this
[2:36:39] is right it was an
[2:36:41] impression and so I'm going through all
[2:36:44] this stuff and I feel like I'm losing my
[2:36:45] mind mind and so I'm I'm I'm walking and
[2:36:48] I got this impression it's like you have
[2:36:52] no
[2:36:53] idea what is coming against you and that
[2:36:56] you're just able to survive is a
[2:37:01] miracle because there is a lot of stuff
[2:37:04] coming against you that you are totally
[2:37:06] unaware of and you think you're just
[2:37:09] making these things up in your
[2:37:11] mind but there is like forces of evil
[2:37:14] trying to stop you
[2:37:20] anyway I love all of you
[2:37:24] and
[2:37:25] I'm I'm appreciated of the family of
[2:37:30] God I do remember when I first came here
[2:37:33] there was so much healing because I had
[2:37:35] a broken uh family
[2:37:40] life and so I came here and I felt so
[2:37:42] much
[2:37:43] love and it was amazing to me to
[2:37:47] see normal
[2:37:49] families because I never experienced it
[2:37:51] in my life you know was unusual for me
[2:37:55] for Mom and Dad to stay
[2:37:58] together but
[2:38:00] uh what we have here is is
[2:38:03] precious and
[2:38:05] sometimes we forget about
[2:38:11] it and
[2:38:13] often this is the Bible Way he takes a
[2:38:16] little group and does extraordinary
[2:38:20] things and I'm I want to be a part of it
[2:38:24] I don't know what's going to look like
[2:38:26] what it is but right now I just want to
[2:38:29] have a yes in my heart am and not try to
[2:38:34] do something in my own agenda you
[2:38:42] know should I just dismiss or you Lord
[2:38:46] we love
[2:38:47] you we thank you for your love we want
[2:38:51] to thank you for your
[2:38:52] grace Lord I want to thank you for
[2:38:54] keeping us all these
[2:38:57] years so many times we we could have
[2:39:01] just given
[2:39:02] up but there was something that kept us
[2:39:10] going would you open
[2:39:13] up the eyes of our understanding
[2:39:16] so we can truly see The Inheritance that
[2:39:19] we have in you what you have in store
[2:39:22] for your
[2:39:23] [Music]
[2:39:26] people may we truly become
[2:39:32] love not just to be kind that's or
[2:39:37] courteous but maybe like when I think
[2:39:42] about the Bible and every time I pray
[2:39:45] I'm reminded it's all about
[2:39:49] love and Lord I was in the prayer Chapel
[2:39:53] the other
[2:39:55] day and you plainly I feel so plainly
[2:39:59] told me why in the world would you want
[2:40:02] to go to Iceland or into
[2:40:06] Columbus to love somebody if you can't
[2:40:08] even love the people that I've called
[2:40:10] you to
[2:40:13] love and that made so much sense to
[2:40:18] me may we learn to love each
[2:40:21] other not take each other for
[2:40:26] granted and and give us the grace to to
[2:40:30] live above just the atmosphere of this
[2:40:34] world and may be something within us
[2:40:37] just
[2:40:42] birthed I really feel strongly just the
[2:40:45] the the commission is to love your
[2:40:48] neighbor and out of that something
[2:40:52] bigger can
