TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of New Hope Revival ministries and we've been sharing a little bit about the renewing of the Mind in Ephesians chap 4: 22 in the Amplified Bible it says and be constantly renewed in the spirit of of your mind having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude I I find that more often than not daily on a daily basis I have to check my mental attitude and sometimes even my spiritual attitude you know I remember one time brother brandham was preaching and he said the greatest battle ever fought will be fought on the Battlefield of the Mind and I don't know about you but I can relate to that because that's where my battle is it's a battle over thoughts whose report will I believe will I believe what Satan says about me his lies his accusations his disqualifications or will I constantly choose over and over again to believe what God's word says about me I'm not talking about the power of self-help I'm talking about the power of being helped by God because you've come to your Wit's End you've come to the end of your own ability to fix the way you think and so you cry out to your father the one who loves you the most and you say Lord I need help in putting off my old mind and putting on the mind of Christ in 1 Peter chap 1 verse 13 in King James it says that we should gird up the loin of our minds be sober and hope to the end for the great Grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ Amplified Bible says it this way so brace up your minds be sober the complete Jewish Bible says therefore get your minds ready to work work properly work like God created us to work to think and The New American Standard says therefore prepare your minds for Action I want you to know that your mind controls your brain and every thought that you have actually produces or creates a neural Connection in the brain certain chemicals are released when we think a certain way a certain thought when we walk down a certain pathway of thoughts and so this being said it's an important thing to remember when you catch yourself spiraling in your thoughts going back to that old pattern of of believing what the enemy has said about you all of your life when you find yourself making that spiral it's in that moment that you have to raise up in the authority of a holy ghost filled believer and say wait a minute that's not who I am that might have been who I was but that is not who I am I am a new creature in Christ Jesus and I'm not going to believe what you say about me anymore I'm going to agree with God's assessment of who I am I want you to know that it sounds so simple and yet it is so profound because so many of us Believers in this hour are fighting a war within right in our mind a war whose report will we believe I choose today and you must choose with me to guard up to put some reins on your thoughts I mean it's like a wild horse sometime you think one thought that leads to another thought that leads to another thought God by the power of the holy spirit will strengthen you if you'll be conscious of what's happening and if you'll be constant and consistent in your desire and in your discipline to say wait a minute enough is enough greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so today remember every thought you have is cre creating a reaction and a neural Connection in your brain your body is responding to your thoughts so think on things that are lovely that are pure that are of virtue and of good report and I know it will cause you to have a much better day don't forget if it has to be one second at a Time Sweet Jesus then so be it God bless you today
