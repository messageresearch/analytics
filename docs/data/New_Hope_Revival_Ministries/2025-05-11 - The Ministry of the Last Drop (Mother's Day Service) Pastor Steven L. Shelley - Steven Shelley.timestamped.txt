[39:14] quickly after that was gone. They were
[39:17] in Atlanta attending an event. They were
[39:20] going to take a few days off after that
[39:22] together in Atlanta before he went back
[39:25] on the road. And uh she's very
[39:28] devastated. I'm sure that she would
[39:30] appreciate our prayers today.
[39:33] You just don't know. No. Life is a
[39:36] vapor. It is. Uh he was a little bit
[39:40] good bit older than she was, but the
[39:42] reality is it doesn't matter. No, it
[39:45] absolutely. I watch the obituary still.
[39:47] Uhhuh. And I'm surprised sometime
[39:50] there's so many people unexpectedly
[39:53] leaving here. Yes. Pray for Jessica and
[39:55] her family. Pray for those who are out
[39:58] of town this weekend. pray for those who
[40:01] uh couldn't be here today that God will
[40:03] help them and strengthen them. And uh
[40:06] let's pray for uh the peace of
[40:09] Jerusalem. Yes. Amen.
[40:11] Amen. Do you have an unspoken need you'd
[40:14] like to make known by the lifting of the
[40:16] hand out across the stream? The needs
[40:18] that you have, we pray for you, remember
[40:21] you, asking the Lord to minister to your
[40:23] needs. Sing this little course with us
[40:26] as we prepare to pray. Always remember
[40:28] Sister Terry and Sister Ge to the Lord.
[40:31] God will strengthen
[40:33] them. Father in heaven, how we love
[40:40] you. We lift your name in all the earth.
[40:48] May your kingdom be established in our
[40:55] praises as your people declare your
[41:00] mighty
[41:01] worth. Blessed be the
[41:05] Lord
[41:07] God
[41:11] Almighty who was and is and is to
[41:17] come. Blessed be the
[41:21] Lord
[41:23] God
[41:26] Almighty who reigns.
[41:29] Brother Daniel Miller, will you come and
[41:31] pray over the needs today? Blessed be
[41:35] the
[41:36] Lord
[41:38] God
[41:42] Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[41:49] Blessed be the
[41:52] Lord
[41:53] God
[41:57] Almighty who
[41:59] reigns
[42:01] forever more.
[42:04] Jesus, Jesus,
[42:08] we declare you reign today, Lord.
[42:12] We declare we've surrendered our hearts
[42:14] to you today.
[42:17] May your abode be welcoming to you
[42:19] today. We don't pray to a God that we
[42:22] don't know who you
[42:24] are. Lord,
[42:26] surely you were the God of Abraham,
[42:28] Isaac, and Jacob.
[42:30] And surely you still are.
[42:33] Surely you were the God of Moses and
[42:35] David and Jeremiah and
[42:38] Isaiah. David testified prophetically
[42:41] that your bones would stare at you one
[42:43] day. And surely Jesus, you are our God.
[42:47] The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[42:49] Took on a mortal robe.
[42:52] You shed your blood for us that we might
[42:55] be cleansed and set
[42:57] apart. You took stripes for our healing.
[43:01] God, there's there's broken hearts
[43:03] today. You've heard the prayer request.
[43:05] Sister Flo's family, her granddaughter,
[43:07] and her loss. God, only you can bind up
[43:10] the brokenhearted. Only you can mend the
[43:12] wound. Only you can heal. Oh
[43:16] God. Surely the God of Abraham, Isaac,
[43:19] and Jacob has been manifested in our
[43:21] day. Lord, you were a creative God with
[43:23] Amy Simple
[43:25] McFersonson. You were a creative God
[43:27] with William Brandom. And God, we want
[43:29] to get out of the way and let you
[43:30] created us. We want to be everything
[43:33] that you've called us to be today.
[43:36] As we set aside this time and we worship
[43:38] the God that was and the God that is,
[43:42] may you come today, speak to our hearts
[43:44] and may your word transform our life and
[43:47] make us into your image. God, you're not
[43:50] looking for a cross and you're not
[43:52] looking for a statue. You're looking for
[43:54] a people today that you might manifest
[43:58] yourself through. May we be that people.
[44:01] Yes, we surrender to you and we thank
[44:04] you for your promises. We thank you for
[44:06] your love. We thank you for your spirit,
[44:09] your atmosphere, your presence. God, we
[44:12] thank you that you're making your per
[44:14] oh, you're making your personality known
[44:16] to us. You're letting us know what you
[44:20] like and what you don't
[44:22] like. God, we just want to bring you an
[44:24] offering of praise today that's worthy
[44:27] of you. We want to lay our petition
[44:30] before you knowing that you won't miss
[44:32] one of them. So we commit it to you. We
[44:34] commit the service to you. We commit our
[44:36] loved ones that are on the road and
[44:38] apart from us today. We commit Sister
[44:40] Terry and Sister Ge to you today, Lord.
[44:43] We
[44:43] commit our fellowship to you today. May
[44:47] you be in everything. May you be lifted
[44:49] up. And may we be all drawn closer to
[44:51] you because of it. We continue to
[44:54] glorify you. have the preeminence in the
[44:57] remainder of the service. Lord, we ask
[45:00] it in the name above all names, the Lord
[45:01] Jesus Christ. Amen. Yeshua Hamashiach,
[45:04] our Messiah. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[45:15] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[45:18] Blessed be the
[45:21] Lord
[45:23] God
[45:27] Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[45:34] Blessed be the
[45:37] Lord
[45:38] God
[45:42] Almighty who
[45:44] reigns
[45:46] forever
[45:51] more. Give him one more shot of praise.
[45:55] Oh
[45:58] hallelujah. We praise you Lord.
[46:07] Amen.
[46:09] God bless you. You may have your seats
[46:11] today.
[46:16] Hallelujah.
[46:20] We're glad to see you in the house of
[46:22] the Lord today. We want to wish all of
[46:25] the mothers a very happy Mother's Day.
[46:29] God bless you. Thank you for what you
[46:32] do. We're so grateful. I'm glad that I
[46:36] still have my mother. She's still alive
[46:39] and still at her post of duty beside of
[46:43] daddy being a pastor's wife. And uh I've
[46:46] not got to speak to her yet today
[46:48] because they leave the house very early
[46:50] and uh they don't text and cell phone
[46:55] sketchy in the mountains. But we're glad
[46:58] that you're here. all of the mothers and
[47:01] glad to be gathered here together with
[47:03] you. I am so very grateful for what the
[47:07] Lord is doing. Um this afternoon we're
[47:10] going to gather un under the uh
[47:13] tabernacle in the fellowship hall that
[47:15] the Lord has provided for us. We know
[47:17] that some already had other plans, but
[47:20] those that could, we're going to bring
[47:22] our lunch together. and and uh I'm I'm
[47:25] only saying that because there is a a
[47:28] new addition in the fellowship hall.
[47:31] Someone came to me who is already raised
[47:34] their children and they wanted to help
[47:37] to make it easier for the mothers and
[47:40] wanted to buy changing tables for the
[47:44] bathrooms. So those are installed uh not
[47:47] only in the ladies bathroom but also in
[47:49] the men's bathroom. So, uh, one in each
[47:53] and the Lord was gracious, uh, just a
[47:56] personal testimony, uh, because it takes
[48:00] it takes something strong to hold one of
[48:03] those things. And, uh, when when you
[48:06] don't have a lot of wood behind the
[48:09] sheetrock to work with, you pray that
[48:11] you have a a 2x4, a stud in the right
[48:15] place.
[48:17] And the Lord was gracious in both
[48:20] bathrooms that I had at least one stud
[48:23] to attach to uh within 3/4 of an inch in
[48:27] the one bathroom and one inch uh in the
[48:30] other one from being centered where I
[48:32] wanted to put them. And I was so
[48:34] grateful to the Lord for that small
[48:35] blessing so that they're good and strong
[48:37] and we don't have to worry about them
[48:39] being pulled off the wall. Amen. But
[48:41] don't change your teenager.
[48:46] I don't know whether it's written on
[48:48] them or not, but the the paperwork says
[48:52] 50B weight limit. Okay. 50
[48:59] lbs. Yeah. All right. Well, we want to
[49:03] receive the tithe and offering today. Uh

[49:11] with them today. And we want to receive
[49:14] the tithe and offering. Uh, brother

[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:32] name.
[1:01:35] Glory.
[1:01:37] Would you mind to give God praise for
[1:01:40] the musicians and the
[1:01:43] camera folk and the sound and the
[1:01:47] projector and all the behind the scenes.
[1:01:51] Isn't the Lord good?
[1:01:54] Amen. Uh I had a bunch of children run
[1:01:57] to the car to greet me this morning when
[1:01:59] I got out got here. I sure did
[1:02:02] appreciate it. And I told them, I said,
[1:02:04] "Well, it's happy pap day." And they
[1:02:07] just giggled, but it's nothing to do
[1:02:09] with me today. Uh, except I had a mother
[1:02:13] or I wouldn't be here. And I know that
[1:02:16] some people get a little funny. They'll
[1:02:19] celebrate a pagan holiday and give it
[1:02:21] call it belonging to Jesus, but uh, they
[1:02:24] wouldn't think of celebrating Mother's
[1:02:27] Day. Well, brother Brandham must have
[1:02:28] thought that Mother's Day was
[1:02:30] appropriate because he said we should
[1:02:32] have it
[1:02:34] 365 days of the year. I didn't hear too
[1:02:38] many women amen. And I thought every
[1:02:40] sister would say amen. And he said not
[1:02:43] that old commercial stuff buying this
[1:02:46] and but he said loving her. And he said
[1:02:48] why don't you I might read it but he
[1:02:50] said why don't you go sit with her?
[1:02:54] Why don't you go sit with her and and
[1:02:57] and love her and listen to her? You
[1:03:00] know, that's that is right. Thank you
[1:03:03] for being here today. Thank you for
[1:03:05] coming to honor the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] above all. And thank thank you so much.
[1:03:12] I'm not going to call names because it's
[1:03:14] no there's no reason to. Everyone is at
[1:03:17] home. We're glad you're here and we've
[1:03:20] been waiting on you to get here and to
[1:03:21] be here, but I think it is outstanding
[1:03:24] that you have come to honor your mom,
[1:03:28] your your wife who is a mom to your
[1:03:31] children. I think it's just good that
[1:03:33] we're gathered here today in in the name
[1:03:36] of the Lord. And you can say amen now.
[1:03:39] Glad to have the travelers home with us
[1:03:41] for the weekend. Very thankful to see
[1:03:44] the Millers here.
[1:03:49] be seated just for two minutes.
[1:03:53] Um, Brother David Templeton, who is the
[1:03:56] pastor of the church up in the valley, I
[1:03:59] don't have the name of it in front of
[1:04:00] me, but uh, some of you have been there.
[1:04:04] And um, they they didn't mention it to
[1:04:07] us directly, but uh, we are we know and
[1:04:11] we're invited. And uh next Saturday
[1:04:15] night at 6:00, brother Oh, I'm sorry. I
[1:04:20] don't know what time. It just dawned on
[1:04:21] me. Jonathan said he would let us know,
[1:04:24] but uh I'd say 6 or 7 somewhere in
[1:04:27] there. And uh but we'll let you know for
[1:04:30] sure on Tuesday night. They're having
[1:04:32] Brother Tim Cross from North Carolina,
[1:04:35] Brother Gerald Hugh's
[1:04:37] son-in-law. And uh he's a wonderful
[1:04:40] musician. his wife is a lovely singer
[1:04:42] and he's a good preacher and I know you
[1:04:45] would be blessed if you were able to go
[1:04:47] and and support that meeting. Uh they're
[1:04:50] wonderful people. Brother David is a
[1:04:52] wonderful man of God and we appreciate
[1:04:55] their friendship. Amen. Amen. This
[1:04:57] Wednesday, May the
[1:05:00] 14th, in
[1:05:03] 1948, the declaration was signed that
[1:05:06] Israel would once again become a nation
[1:05:10] or in technical terms would become an
[1:05:14] independent state.
[1:05:17] And just a few hours later, five Arab
[1:05:20] nations
[1:05:22] uh pulled out the stops and said, "Oh,
[1:05:25] no, not so fast. We'll just try to
[1:05:29] annihilate you and then you won't have
[1:05:32] anybody to inhabit to live on the land."
[1:05:35] But God. Somebody say, "But God."
[1:05:38] God used a rag tag group of volunteer
[1:05:43] soldiers, including a few who left the
[1:05:47] United States to go home and fight in
[1:05:49] that war. And um they used uh simple uh
[1:05:54] technology as simple weaponry included
[1:05:58] dropping motto cocktails out of
[1:06:01] low-flying planes. And by the grace of
[1:06:05] God, they they stopped the the attack of
[1:06:08] these uh Arab armies and they stopped a
[1:06:12] fleet of of the top tanks made in the
[1:06:17] world at that time. God did it.
[1:06:22] And uh so we celebrate May 14th. There
[1:06:26] are other days that are mentioned and
[1:06:27] other days that commemorate various
[1:06:30] steps along the way, but Sister Martha
[1:06:33] Miller shares a birthday. She's not as
[1:06:36] old as the modern state of Israel by any
[1:06:39] means. I won't say anything about
[1:06:41] Brother Truman, but Sister Martha is not
[1:06:44] and her birthday is also on Wednesday.
[1:06:47] So, can we say happy birthday to Sister
[1:06:49] Martha Miller?
[1:06:54] Thursday of the same week is is uh Casey
[1:06:57] Hannah's birthday and we don't see her
[1:06:59] as much as we used to. She's very
[1:07:02] involved in her church and we're very
[1:07:04] thankful that she has a place uh to be a
[1:07:07] part of and that uh that sister Pam is
[1:07:10] going with her and and they worship
[1:07:13] together. But we love her. She's part of
[1:07:15] us and we uh send birthday greetings to
[1:07:19] her. And also Samantha May, who's not
[1:07:21] here this morning, has a birthday that
[1:07:23] day as well. If I've missed anyone, I'm
[1:07:26] very sorry. Uh sometimes I think I'll
[1:07:29] just get away from it all together. But
[1:07:32] uh it's nice that we could at least
[1:07:34] remember that person in extra prayer
[1:07:37] because if you're like me, you need it
[1:07:40] every day, not just on special days. And
[1:07:43] so we we do that uh to believe that God
[1:07:46] will undergard them and strengthen
[1:07:50] them. Uh I want to ask to identify the
[1:07:54] oldest mother real quick. What we're
[1:07:55] going to do this morning is uh we're
[1:07:58] going to honor a few of the mothers uh
[1:08:01] who fit a few special categories and
[1:08:03] then at the end of the service they can
[1:08:06] can take a hanging basket home with
[1:08:07] them. And then at the end of the service
[1:08:10] when we call all the mothers up to
[1:08:11] gather around them and pray for them
[1:08:14] that they will stick around and not
[1:08:15] forsake us in the coming year. But
[1:08:18] they'll continue to be our mothers and
[1:08:20] help us even when we don't appreciate
[1:08:22] them enough uh when they go to their
[1:08:25] seats. We want them to take one of these
[1:08:27] gift bags with them. It was done in love
[1:08:29] and it's always done in memory of my
[1:08:31] grandmother who very much believed that
[1:08:34] it was the least that could be done was
[1:08:36] to say thank you to your mother. Of
[1:08:39] course, she had a mother that raised 15
[1:08:42] children and uh worked very hard until
[1:08:46] the doctor said her backbone was worn in
[1:08:49] two and one wrong move would paralyze
[1:08:52] her for the rest of her life. So she
[1:08:55] hobbled around, but it didn't deter her
[1:08:57] from shouting. When the spirit of the
[1:08:59] Lord would come, she would dance her her
[1:09:01] long braid down. She many, many times
[1:09:04] she would just give God glory anyhow and
[1:09:06] walk out straighter than what she did
[1:09:08] when she came in. That's the goodness of
[1:09:11] God. So, I do that in honor, not to be
[1:09:14] commercial, but uh thank you Amazon for
[1:09:18] helping us, you know, and um I wanted to
[1:09:21] do it always in honor of of her. Uh so,
[1:09:24] I want to get right to the word is what
[1:09:26] I'm getting to. But before we do that,
[1:09:29] uh Sister Williams, are you willing to
[1:09:31] tell us your current
[1:09:35] age? Is there a mother here uh older
[1:09:38] than 88?
[1:09:40] I didn't think
[1:09:42] so. We're very, very happy. Very happy.
[1:09:46] I hope we get to celebrate her for many,
[1:09:49] many more
[1:09:51] years. 88 years old. Can we all say
[1:09:54] happy Mother's Day to Sister William,
[1:09:56] Sister
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:10:01] Isabelle? Most of us in this room, she's
[1:10:04] been a mama to us for many, many years.
[1:10:08] I never made a trip. But what she packed
[1:10:11] my shirts and in every pocket of every
[1:10:15] shirt was a poem or a scripture or a
[1:10:18] word of encouragement. She sent me to
[1:10:20] the nations that way. I had quick
[1:10:23] turnarounds sometime in those early
[1:10:25] days. And she's even driven to Atlanta,
[1:10:28] picked up my dirty clothes, brought them
[1:10:30] home, washed them, laundered them all
[1:10:32] night long, met me at the airport the
[1:10:34] next morning so I could go
[1:10:38] again.
[1:10:42] So, we are not all her biological
[1:10:45] children, but we've all been her
[1:10:46] children. Uh Cindy sitting right there,
[1:10:49] that's one of her children right there.
[1:10:51] And we appreciate uh God's goodness to
[1:10:53] us today. The youngest mother that used
[1:10:56] to be Megan until she started getting
[1:11:01] old. Luke or Sister Pam, how old is
[1:11:06] Megan? 29. Jenna, I think you're younger
[1:11:09] than that, aren't you? Still, how old
[1:11:11] are you? 26. Are there any mothers here
[1:11:14] younger than 26? You're 26 or
[1:11:17] younger. All right.
[1:11:21] Well, Jenna, we want to say happy
[1:11:23] Mother's Day to you. You take
[1:11:28] a We
[1:11:30] are particularly happy to hear about the
[1:11:33] changing uh tables in the men's
[1:11:35] restrooms for for Benjamin. We we ought
[1:11:38] to I don't know who paid for him, but we
[1:11:40] ought to put his name on it and just
[1:11:43] dedicate it to him because that's his
[1:11:46] favorite thing favorite job in the whole
[1:11:49] wide
[1:11:52] world. I don't think it's anybody's
[1:11:54] favorite job, but it's part of the
[1:11:57] package.
[1:11:58] Amen.
[1:12:00] Uh Sister um Teresa, until someone beats
[1:12:04] you, there may be folks working on your
[1:12:06] record. I don't know for sure. It feels
[1:12:08] that
[1:12:10] way. You
[1:12:16] may.
[1:12:18] Well, if we go much lower, we're going
[1:12:21] to get into uh probably ties and tie
[1:12:24] breakers and things like that, which
[1:12:26] which might cause us to be
[1:12:28] embarrassed.
[1:12:30] Uh don't you have quite a few of your
[1:12:33] biological children here?
[1:12:37] Well, now that gets a little
[1:12:46] technical. So, you want to pass it to
[1:12:48] Sister Jada this year? Is
[1:12:53] that Let's Let's Let's do that this
[1:12:56] year. And if we have one left over at
[1:12:57] the end, we'll we'll make sure you get
[1:12:59] it. Sister Resa, let's uh say happy
[1:13:02] Mother's Day to both of them. six and
[1:13:05] seven here
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:11] present. We do usually say that because
[1:13:13] you can you you know you might have as
[1:13:15] many children as the old woman in the
[1:13:17] shoe but but but we want them here. We
[1:13:22] can preach to them. Amen. All right. And
[1:13:25] then uh to the one who's had the baptism
[1:13:27] of the Holy Ghost. This is I'm telling
[1:13:29] you this is the most important part of
[1:13:31] it. Not how old or how young or how many
[1:13:34] children you have but but uh to receive
[1:13:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost completes
[1:13:39] the new birth. So so this is how old you
[1:13:42] are. We'll just claim that that uh who
[1:13:45] has had the baptism of the Holy Ghost 50
[1:13:49] plus years over 50 years. Sister
[1:13:52] Beverly, anybody
[1:13:55] else? Sister Beverly, happy Mother's
[1:13:57] Day. Make sure you have a someone help
[1:14:00] her with a hanging
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:04] basket. Do you know how many
[1:14:09] years? 55 years. She's 55 years old in
[1:14:13] the Lord. Amen. Let's believe that God
[1:14:18] will strengthen her. Uh that she would
[1:14:20] have some healthy and stronger days
[1:14:22] ahead. God is good. He's faithful in all
[1:14:26] of his ways. Let's stand. I'm anxious. I
[1:14:29] don't usually get anxious, but I'm
[1:14:31] anxious to preach a little. Proverbs
[1:14:34] chapter 31. I'm going to read uh a few
[1:14:38] verses in the Amplified this morning
[1:14:41] because it's it's not my my sermon
[1:14:46] uh so much, but I wanted to read the
[1:14:48] beauty of
[1:14:49] it. These are marvelous words. And um I
[1:14:55] I won. I I won. I uh I really truly
[1:15:00] believe
[1:15:01] that God gave me the best wife. And I
[1:15:05] believe that she has been the best
[1:15:07] mother to our children. And I'm honest
[1:15:11] when I read this, when I hear it used to
[1:15:13] describe other people, I think, well,
[1:15:16] that's very nice of them to say so. But
[1:15:18] I know the truth and uh I believe that
[1:15:22] God has given me this this woman. But
[1:15:26] may there be tens of thousands of women
[1:15:29] who will live up to this. This is a high
[1:15:32] standard, a
[1:15:34] capable, intelligent and virtuous woman.
[1:15:39] Who is he who can find her? How many of
[1:15:43] you say I can? I can. She is far more
[1:15:46] precious than
[1:15:48] jewels. And her value is far above
[1:15:52] rubies or
[1:15:54] pearls. Those things would almost demean
[1:15:58] her because her value is so much higher
[1:16:02] than a diamond ring or a pearl around
[1:16:05] her neck. The heart of her husband th
[1:16:08] this is so powerful. The heart of her
[1:16:12] husband
[1:16:13] trusts in her
[1:16:16] confidently and relies on and believes
[1:16:20] in her securely so that he has no lack
[1:16:24] of honest gain or need of dishonest
[1:16:29] spoil. I think trust is one of the most
[1:16:33] important parts of a relationship.
[1:16:36] And if a husband can fully trust a wife
[1:16:40] to have his best interest at heart and
[1:16:43] the best interest of his children at
[1:16:45] heart, he's a rich, rich, rich man.
[1:16:50] She
[1:16:51] comforts,
[1:16:54] encourages, and does him only
[1:16:57] good as long as there is life within
[1:17:01] her. Now, every woman doesn't meet that
[1:17:07] standard. Amen.
[1:17:10] So many in this society are out for
[1:17:14] themselves.
[1:17:15] But that's not the kind of woman Solomon
[1:17:18] is describing. Now, verse 28 through 30,
[1:17:22] her
[1:17:23] children rise
[1:17:25] up. I had it here in the amplified, but
[1:17:28] I forgot to tell you it was. and call
[1:17:31] her blessed, happy, fortunate, and to be
[1:17:37] envied. And her husband boasts of and
[1:17:40] praises her, saying, "Many daughters
[1:17:43] have done virtuously, nobly, and well,
[1:17:46] with the strength of character that is
[1:17:48] steadfast in goodness, but you excel
[1:17:52] them all. Charm and grace are deceptive
[1:17:56] and beauty is vain because it is not
[1:17:59] lasting.
[1:18:01] It's true. But a woman who reverently
[1:18:05] and worshipfully fears the Lord,
[1:18:10] huh?
[1:18:12] A woman who reverently and worshipfully
[1:18:16] fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
[1:18:21] Somebody said we're not supposed to
[1:18:23] praise people. Not in the same manner
[1:18:26] that we would praise the Lord. But yes,
[1:18:28] we absolutely are. Not
[1:18:31] flattery, but
[1:18:33] sincere, kind words to lift them up
[1:18:37] instead of putting them down. May the
[1:18:39] saints say, "Amen." Father, we need you.
[1:18:42] I need him today. Do you need him to
[1:18:44] help us?
[1:18:46] Come and do that, Lord. You may be
[1:18:48] seated.
[1:18:50] Uh, I'm going to just read this from the
[1:18:52] from the
[1:18:54] onset in the message. The invasion of
[1:18:57] the United
[1:18:59] States. There has been a lot of talk
[1:19:02] this week and I'm not adding to it
[1:19:05] because I have some questions before the
[1:19:07] Lord. And before I know this, God is
[1:19:11] faithful and true. He keeps his word. He
[1:19:13] never lies. What he says he's going to
[1:19:16] do, he does. But I know that when we try
[1:19:19] to figure it out, when we try to
[1:19:21] interpret it, when we try to say it's
[1:19:22] this or that or the other, uh sometimes
[1:19:25] we can make a big old mess. Brother
[1:19:27] Brandham told us that God would uh
[1:19:31] interpret his word by by bringing it to
[1:19:35] pass.
[1:19:36] And so considering the fact that we have
[1:19:41] an American pope for the first time in
[1:19:44] the history of the Catholic Church, I
[1:19:46] would definitely say that we are one
[1:19:48] step closer
[1:19:51] to the to the going away of this little
[1:19:53] bride. I would definitely say that uh we
[1:19:57] have both glorious days and terrifying
[1:20:01] days ahead
[1:20:03] because that's not all. You know why we
[1:20:05] are rejoicing over part of the prophecy?
[1:20:08] We are missing the rest of it because he
[1:20:12] tells us that in that federation of
[1:20:14] churches, there will be an image that
[1:20:17] will come forth of the beast
[1:20:20] and there will be a persecution that
[1:20:22] will come to all churches who who refuse
[1:20:25] to acknowledge their mother.
[1:20:29] And we're not seeing that. And when we
[1:20:33] see that when we see that squeeze that
[1:20:36] brings forth the understanding of the
[1:20:39] thunders,
[1:20:41] then we will know. We will know. We will
[1:20:43] know. We will know that we can just
[1:20:46] close our eyes and say, "Lord, we're
[1:20:48] ready. We're ready." Because we will be
[1:20:51] even that much closer to the coming of
[1:20:54] the Lord. The world council of churches
[1:20:56] today is not much of anything but
[1:20:59] overnight it could be a great threat. It
[1:21:03] is not even today what it was in the 50s
[1:21:06] and 60s. Uh our persecution is coming
[1:21:10] from other sources these days.
[1:21:14] So I want to acknowledge that something
[1:21:18] that I didn't see happening did not see
[1:21:21] happening yet has happened. I know how
[1:21:25] the Catholic Church feels about the
[1:21:27] United States and it's not highly
[1:21:30] and uh our the the the new pope has
[1:21:34] already done everything that he could to
[1:21:36] distance himself from the United States
[1:21:38] and will continue to do that. He spoke
[1:21:41] in other languages that he has learned
[1:21:43] refused to say one word of English and
[1:21:47] uh believe me he will move further away
[1:21:50] and distance himself even further from
[1:21:52] the United States. He is and will be the
[1:21:55] most liberal leader the church has ever
[1:21:58] seen. And he was placed and positioned
[1:22:01] and prepared and they knew who it would
[1:22:04] be before there was any smoke out the
[1:22:06] chimney. That I can tell you. So we will
[1:22:10] talk about that another time. But from a
[1:22:14] message that was quite prophetic, the
[1:22:17] invasion in paragraph 253, brother
[1:22:20] Brandham said, "This was on Mother's
[1:22:21] Day. I certainly sympathize with you
[1:22:24] poor mothers sitting here with your
[1:22:25] white roses on. There's a heaven that a
[1:22:28] mother has gone to today where a good
[1:22:31] oldfashioned mother that lived for God
[1:22:34] probably has passed beyond the veil. She
[1:22:36] is waiting for you, Jason. She is
[1:22:39] waiting for you to come. That's right.
[1:22:44] I thought of Jason when I read that
[1:22:46] because his mother did not serve the
[1:22:48] Lord throughout her life. But when she
[1:22:50] made up her mind to do it, she did it.
[1:22:54] She did it. And the Lord took her not
[1:22:59] too long after that. He's got somebody
[1:23:03] waiting for him. Many of us do. He said,
[1:23:07] "And I respect and honor you there with
[1:23:10] your red roses on." Remember that was
[1:23:12] the tradition and has been for years. A
[1:23:15] woman would wear a white rose or ribbon
[1:23:18] for a a mother that had passed and a red
[1:23:20] to signify that her mother was still
[1:23:22] alive. Your mother, if you want to do
[1:23:25] anything for her, do it
[1:23:28] 365 days a year. Go to her house, offer
[1:23:32] prayer, live for God.
[1:23:37] You know, I think there are mothers even
[1:23:39] in this house that would say, "Keep your
[1:23:41] flower. Come on. Serve the Lord with me.
[1:23:45] Come to church with me. Let's worship
[1:23:47] the Lord. Let's stand on the truth."
[1:23:51] This is the greatest honor that we can
[1:23:53] give the woman that God chose to bring
[1:23:55] us to this earth. Go to her house, offer
[1:23:58] prayer, live for God. That's the thing
[1:24:00] to do. He goes on, "And bring up your
[1:24:03] children. And when your children come
[1:24:05] up, they'll call you blessed after
[1:24:07] you've passed on beyond the veil. That's
[1:24:09] the real spirit of motherhood. The real
[1:24:12] spirit of Mother's Day. Mother's Day is
[1:24:16] 365 days a year. He said, "This is the
[1:24:20] day they sell flowers and pass presents.
[1:24:22] The world does. If it passes, if the
[1:24:25] world should stand another 20 years,
[1:24:28] watch. If you want to talk about a
[1:24:30] prophecy fulfilled, here's one. He said
[1:24:32] they'll have son's day and daughter's
[1:24:34] day and cousins day,
[1:24:38] uncle's day, and I could go puppy day,
[1:24:42] donut day, pizza day. Come on. He said
[1:24:46] all them things just enough to get the
[1:24:48] world in a commercial glamour. He said
[1:24:49] that's just where it's going. Right into
[1:24:51] hell.
[1:24:54] Because it is sort of a sham.
[1:24:58] You've got to make sure that you are
[1:25:00] truly remembering mother more than just
[1:25:02] one day. He said, "But you, God bless
[1:25:05] you, is my prayer." I want to read one
[1:25:08] more and we'll move on. Chicago,
[1:25:11] Illinois, in a message, Elisha the
[1:25:13] prophet, he said, "Just keep drilling
[1:25:15] that into their minds, drilling it
[1:25:17] constantly. That's what you do to your
[1:25:19] children, mother. Quit running around
[1:25:22] over the city and gathering about. give
[1:25:24] your children Bible lectures and things.
[1:25:26] That's the thing to do. He doesn't mean
[1:25:30] lecture them like, you know, wag your
[1:25:32] finger at them. He means set them on
[1:25:35] your knee and tell them of the exploits
[1:25:37] of the living God. Tell them there's
[1:25:39] only one way to have eternal life, and
[1:25:42] that's to be born again, bloodbought,
[1:25:44] sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:25:46] of the word, filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:49] Get out of the world. Quit looking like
[1:25:51] a hoochie. quit living like the devil
[1:25:53] and serve God so that you can go out of
[1:25:55] here in a blaze of glory instead of a
[1:25:58] blaze of judgment. He said in these here
[1:26:01] societies and post although it's in the
[1:26:04] church a church is societed up till
[1:26:06] there's no time to raise the children. I
[1:26:09] believe you've heard my expression of
[1:26:10] women
[1:26:11] preachers. Now I might have to crawl
[1:26:13] back on that but let me tell you every
[1:26:16] mother
[1:26:18] Amen. Every mother
[1:26:22] is a smile, honey.
[1:26:25] Smile, Stacy
[1:26:27] Ryan. Every mother is a preacher. Just
[1:26:31] ask her kids. Sure. And God gives her a
[1:26:35] little congregation at home to preach
[1:26:37] to. So now just keep it going. That's
[1:26:39] good. You get it first. So then go right
[1:26:42] with your children. You get full of God
[1:26:44] first and then you set them down and
[1:26:48] drill it. He said, "Drill it and drill
[1:26:50] it and drill it into their minds." You
[1:26:54] say, "Well, I don't want to do that. I
[1:26:55] don't want to influence their decisions.
[1:26:57] I want to be woke and I want to let them
[1:26:59] make their own choices." Well, they're
[1:27:01] not making their own choices when they
[1:27:03] sit down in front of the world.
[1:27:06] They don't make their own choices if
[1:27:08] they get under the influence of the
[1:27:09] public school system. So, you might as
[1:27:12] well be the most important influence for
[1:27:14] the things that are right.
[1:27:17] And here's some, this is what I want to
[1:27:19] read. Some of you will remember this.
[1:27:21] Some time ago, I was reading an article
[1:27:23] where there was a home and five boys
[1:27:25] born into that home. And as soon as the
[1:27:28] oldest one got old enough to go to the
[1:27:30] Navy, off to the Navy he went. The
[1:27:32] second one followed the next one until
[1:27:35] all the whole five went away to the
[1:27:37] Navy. No Marines or Navy men in their
[1:27:40] family. The mother and father couldn't
[1:27:43] understand just why these boys, everyone
[1:27:45] wanted to go away to the Navy. There was
[1:27:49] a real fine combing investigation made
[1:27:51] of this. And come to find out in the
[1:27:54] bedroom where these boys all was brought
[1:27:57] up in this bedroom, there's a beautiful
[1:27:59] big picture hanging there of a big ship
[1:28:02] sailing on a quiet calm sea. And it so
[1:28:06] impressed the boys as they went to bed
[1:28:08] every night. Oh.
[1:28:13] Looking at this
[1:28:14] picture, I mean, this gets me. Yes, sir.
[1:28:18] It was on their mind to sail that quiet,
[1:28:20] soothing sea. And on the morning when
[1:28:23] they arose, the first thing they look at
[1:28:25] was that ship making her way through the
[1:28:27] quiet, calm sea. And it impressed the
[1:28:29] boys so that each one become a sailor.
[1:28:34] Now, if the picture of a ship will
[1:28:37] impress boys to become navy men, sailors
[1:28:41] of the sea, let me tell you something.
[1:28:44] Those navy men found out that the sea is
[1:28:46] rarely calm.
[1:28:48] The life that they chose wasn't a a life
[1:28:52] on a calm sea, right? But what ought the
[1:28:56] picture of the Lord Jesus Christ do?
[1:28:59] Always have the right thing. Always have
[1:29:02] the right thing. Always have the right
[1:29:06] thing. Always have the right thing
[1:29:09] before your children. Bring up a child
[1:29:12] in the way that it should go. See, bring
[1:29:13] it up and teach it right. It'll serve.
[1:29:16] Won't depart from it. Praise God. I like
[1:29:20] it. I like
[1:29:25] it. I don't want my boys to go off and
[1:29:28] sail the Navy.
[1:29:30] I want their influence to be in another
[1:29:32] direction. Someone said that's not our
[1:29:35] respon. It is our responsibility to
[1:29:38] point them in the right direction
[1:29:40] because how they see us treating Jesus.
[1:29:46] How they see us treating Jesus is how
[1:29:48] they're going to start out to treat him.
[1:29:51] If it's with disregard and disdain and
[1:29:54] uh uh just, you know, when I'm done with
[1:29:56] everything else, if there's any more
[1:29:57] time, I'll give that to the Lord. then
[1:29:59] that's the example they'll follow. We're
[1:30:01] blessed in this church to have both
[1:30:04] women and men, mamas and daddies who
[1:30:07] realize that it is our responsibility to
[1:30:10] set before our children something more
[1:30:12] than an influence to the Navy or to
[1:30:16] politics. Amen.
[1:30:20] You may have you may have gathered your
[1:30:22] children around and asked them if they
[1:30:23] wanted to be the president of the United
[1:30:25] States. I guarantee you I never ask any
[1:30:27] of mine that.
[1:30:30] I don't know why anybody would want that
[1:30:32] kind of a job. Amen. That wouldn't be
[1:30:35] the influence. That wouldn't be the
[1:30:36] direction I would want to point my
[1:30:38] children in. Come on. Come on. I want
[1:30:41] you to look with me to Second Kings
[1:30:43] chapter 4. And I'm going to preach now.
[1:30:46] I want to call this this morning the
[1:30:48] ministry of the last drop.
[1:30:51] When I was a boy,
[1:30:54] um, everybody in my family, my life had
[1:30:57] a
[1:30:59] television
[1:31:02] and television was different. I'm not
[1:31:05] that old, but television was different
[1:31:07] then. I was seeing
[1:31:10] reruns. I saw the reruns of Lucy, not
[1:31:13] not current ones, rerun. I saw reruns of
[1:31:18] many shows, Andy Griffith, Walton's,
[1:31:21] things like that. I didn't see, you
[1:31:24] know, they weren't still making some of
[1:31:25] those programs. I said again, I'm not
[1:31:28] that old. I was waiting on your
[1:31:31] amen. I'm not that old, but I remember
[1:31:34] commercials. Oddly enough, I remember
[1:31:37] commercials when I was a child and there
[1:31:40] was a there was a woman who uh was
[1:31:43] sometimes on the Waltons and she also
[1:31:46] played in the Wizard of Oz and she was a
[1:31:50] spokesperson for a coffee
[1:31:54] company. And she would take her coffee
[1:31:58] cup and she would turn it up and she
[1:32:01] would say this. You know it, don't you?
[1:32:02] What I'm going to say? Ah, it's good to
[1:32:07] the last drop.
[1:32:10] Well, my granddaddy adopted that, but he
[1:32:12] didn't say drop. He said
[1:32:15] drop. And he would go around the house
[1:32:17] every morning before he go to work. You
[1:32:20] could hear him. It's good to the last
[1:32:23] drop. It's good to the last drop. And I
[1:32:27] want to preach this morning on the
[1:32:28] ministry of the last drop. When mothers
[1:32:33] pour from empty,
[1:32:36] the ministry of the last drop. When
[1:32:39] mothers pour from empty. Second Kings
[1:32:42] chapter 4. We got to hurry now. There
[1:32:44] cried a certain woman of the wives of
[1:32:48] the sons of the prophets unto Elisha,
[1:32:51] saying, Thy servant, my husband, is
[1:32:54] dead, and thou knowest that thy servant
[1:32:57] did fear the Lord, and the creditor is
[1:33:00] come to take unto him my two sons to be
[1:33:03] bond men." This was a type of indentured
[1:33:08] slavery. How many of you understand what
[1:33:10] I'm saying? It wasn't their debt. It was
[1:33:13] their father's debt. But because the
[1:33:16] debt could not be met, these young men
[1:33:19] would be taken into indentured slavery
[1:33:22] and they would serve not until the debt
[1:33:25] was
[1:33:27] paid. That would be our logical thought.
[1:33:31] But the law required
[1:33:34] more. They would serve until the year of
[1:33:38] Jubilee.
[1:33:42] That might be three years. It might be
[1:33:44] 49 years.
[1:33:46] They would not be released according to
[1:33:49] the instructions of the law until the
[1:33:52] year of Jubilee. We're not looking at a
[1:33:55] Greek book. We're looking at a book with
[1:33:57] a Hebrew mindset.
[1:34:00] And these young men would be away from
[1:34:03] their family and they wouldn't have
[1:34:05] families.
[1:34:07] they would be brought up somewhere else
[1:34:09] working out the debt. And so what did
[1:34:12] she do? She cried after Elisha, who was
[1:34:15] a servant unto Elijah, who was promised
[1:34:18] a double portion of his anointing. Amen.
[1:34:22] And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I
[1:34:24] do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in
[1:34:27] thy house?" And she said, "Thine
[1:34:30] handmmaid hath not anything in the
[1:34:33] house, save a pot of
[1:34:36] oil." Then he said, "Go borrow thee
[1:34:40] vessels abroad of all thy neighbors,
[1:34:42] even empty vessels. Borrow not a few."
[1:34:46] What kind of instructions is this
[1:34:49] prophetic man giving this woman in such
[1:34:52] a pitiful place? And when thou art come
[1:34:55] in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee,
[1:34:58] and upon thy sons, and shall pour out
[1:35:02] into all those vessels, and thou shalt
[1:35:05] set aside that which is full. Are you
[1:35:08] following the story? So she went from
[1:35:10] him, shut the door upon her, and upon
[1:35:14] her sons who brought the vessels to her.
[1:35:17] And I want you to listen to this phrase
[1:35:20] and let it get deep down into the
[1:35:22] recesses of your heart. And she poured
[1:35:25] out.
[1:35:28] I want you to see her. She poured out.
[1:35:33] This was not a job that she could give
[1:35:35] to anyone else. Her sons could bring the
[1:35:39] empty vessels, but they couldn't pour
[1:35:41] the oil. The prophet could tell her what
[1:35:44] to do, but he wasn't to pour the oil.
[1:35:48] Her husband was dead, and he would be of
[1:35:50] no service to her. In fact, he's the one
[1:35:53] who left the debt. And before you call
[1:35:56] him a skunk, you'll need to know who he
[1:35:58] was because he wasn't a skunk at all. In
[1:36:02] fact, he was one of those 7,000 men, or
[1:36:05] is it
[1:36:07] 700 that would never bow a knee to Baal?
[1:36:14] He was a righteous man and an upfront
[1:36:17] man who loved the word and loved the
[1:36:20] truth. There was no hatred in her heart
[1:36:22] toward him. There was no bitterness in
[1:36:25] her heart toward him. She was just going
[1:36:27] to suffer the consequences that had been
[1:36:29] given to her. It's an interesting story.
[1:36:33] I want you to remember. And she
[1:36:37] poured out. I used this text some years
[1:36:40] ago and the Lord, I mean, he placed me
[1:36:44] here again, gave me some extra
[1:36:47] understanding and I want to move forward
[1:36:49] with it. And it came to pass when the
[1:36:52] vessels were full that she said unto her
[1:36:55] son, "Bring me yet a vessel." And he
[1:36:58] said unto her, "There is not a vessel
[1:37:02] more." Read the next line.
[1:37:06] And the oil stayed. And she poured out.
[1:37:11] And the oil
[1:37:13] stayed. When did the oil dry up? when
[1:37:16] the last empty vessel that had been
[1:37:19] borrowed had been filled.
[1:37:23] You've got to understand that she didn't
[1:37:25] have an endless supply. She had a
[1:37:28] limited supply. And all she could do
[1:37:31] with that limited supply was to do what
[1:37:33] the prophet instructed her to do, pour
[1:37:36] out.
[1:37:38] She must have marveled in her mind every
[1:37:41] time she filled a vessel 10 times, 20
[1:37:45] times larger
[1:37:47] than the vessel she was pouring from.
[1:37:52] The last drop, the ministry of the last
[1:37:57] drop. When mothers pour from empty,
[1:38:02] when their tank is empty, when their
[1:38:06] supply is limited, the real heart of
[1:38:10] motherhood kicks in
[1:38:12] and they take from the little supply
[1:38:15] that they have and they pour out and
[1:38:18] they pour out and they pour out and they
[1:38:21] pour out because reality is nobody can
[1:38:24] pour out in a home
[1:38:26] like a mother hand. That's right. Now,
[1:38:29] get behind me and say, "Amen." Say it
[1:38:31] loud enough for your wife to hear. Say
[1:38:33] it loud enough for your mother to hear.
[1:38:36] Where would we be? Where would we be?
[1:38:39] Where would some of us, most of us be
[1:38:42] had there not been a mother pouring out?
[1:38:45] She might not have been a godly mother,
[1:38:47] but she was pouring out of her limited
[1:38:50] supply. What she had to give, she gave.
[1:38:54] It might have been life. That may have
[1:38:56] been the only thing that she was capable
[1:38:59] of giving you, but where would you be?
[1:39:02] Come on. Nowhere.
[1:39:05] You'd be nowhere had she not given you
[1:39:08] life. Amen. I know a man some of you
[1:39:11] related to, dear man, who sat in my
[1:39:15] office shaking like a leaf, telling me
[1:39:18] his life story, telling me the story of
[1:39:22] a mother who was so wrecked, whose
[1:39:24] nerves were so bad, who was under such
[1:39:28] mental oppression that she shook
[1:39:31] constantly like a leaf. And he would see
[1:39:34] her halfway across the floor with a
[1:39:37] skillet in one hand. So
[1:39:40] nervous, so broken down, so distraught
[1:39:45] in the midst of a constant nervous
[1:39:47] breakdown until she would have to stop
[1:39:50] in the middle of the floor and
[1:39:52] consciously bring her body into a into a
[1:39:56] place of of less shaking so that she
[1:39:59] could even walk across the floor and and
[1:40:01] fry a meal for for but she gave him
[1:40:04] life. That's right.
[1:40:08] She might not have been able to give him
[1:40:10] all the love he needed and all the
[1:40:11] direction he needed and and and all the
[1:40:14] teaching he needed, but she poured out
[1:40:18] from her limited supply.
[1:40:20] I want to say to every mother in this
[1:40:22] house and beyond, when you feel like
[1:40:25] you've given everything you have, when
[1:40:28] you feel like your tank is empty and you
[1:40:31] have absolutely nothing to give, don't
[1:40:33] you stop pouring because there's a God
[1:40:37] who's on board with you. There's a God
[1:40:40] in your life who'll meet you at the
[1:40:43] place of your dedication.
[1:40:46] Here I am, Lord. You know, my nerves are
[1:40:49] frazzled. You know, my husband has put
[1:40:52] too much of this load on me.
[1:40:55] Let me tell you something. They You
[1:40:58] might be limited on what you can say to
[1:41:00] him, but you're not limited what you can
[1:41:01] say to the Lord. Tell the Lord on him.
[1:41:05] Come on.
[1:41:07] Somebody said, "I don't go along with
[1:41:08] that." You ought to tell the Lord
[1:41:10] everything just how you feel. I learned
[1:41:13] a long time ago. He understand. He may
[1:41:15] not agree with me.
[1:41:17] But he understands how I feel. He
[1:41:21] understands how I feel. Keep pouring,
[1:41:23] mama. Keep pouring. You may look down
[1:41:25] and it may look like there's not even a
[1:41:27] drop sliding off the end of the vessel
[1:41:30] into one of your children, but God is
[1:41:32] there to fan the flame. God is there to
[1:41:35] multiply the oil. God is there to bless
[1:41:38] your effort.
[1:41:41] Do what you can until he comes with
[1:41:44] something else. Keep pouring. Are you
[1:41:47] hearing me sir? Keep
[1:41:49] pouring. She poured out. And it came to
[1:41:52] pass. The oil stayed. And then she came
[1:41:54] and told the man of God. And he said,
[1:41:56] "Go sell the oil and pay thy debt and
[1:42:00] live thou and thy children of the rest."
[1:42:04] I want you to notice he didn't say,
[1:42:06] "Keep you a little pot so that you'll be
[1:42:08] able to fry the bread in." We understand
[1:42:11] later why. He said, "Just sell it all
[1:42:15] and use the money, pay off the debt, and
[1:42:18] then live."
[1:42:20] You hear that? There was enough. There
[1:42:23] was enough oil supplied supernaturally.
[1:42:26] You don't really believe this, do you?
[1:42:27] Surely this was metaphoric. Surely this
[1:42:30] wasn't re, it was real. I want you to
[1:42:32] know I believe it was real.
[1:42:36] I know missionaries that saw God do it
[1:42:38] in India for a little woman. Uh like
[1:42:41] another story we read in Kings about a
[1:42:43] woman who used the last little handful
[1:42:46] of meal and a little bit of oil and God
[1:42:48] multiplied that. I know missionaries who
[1:42:50] stood in the house and ate the bread
[1:42:53] that was being baked by a woman who had
[1:42:56] that same miracle taking place in her
[1:42:59] life. Nobody adding any meal to the
[1:43:02] barrel. Nobody putting any more oil in
[1:43:04] the cruise. It never was full. The
[1:43:07] barrel was never full. The cruise of oil
[1:43:09] was never full. Mamas, you may never
[1:43:13] feel full.
[1:43:17] You may never feel like you've got
[1:43:20] enough to give.
[1:43:26] But you've got more than you understand.
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] Because there's somebody else living in
[1:43:33] your shoe leather. There's somebody else
[1:43:35] living on the inside of you. He'll meet
[1:43:37] you at your commitment. He'll meet you
[1:43:40] at your dedication.
[1:43:42] You lay those little babies up on the
[1:43:44] Lord's lap and say, "I can only do so
[1:43:48] much. I need your help with the rest." I
[1:43:51] want you to know he'll come swooping in
[1:43:54] faster than a Superman.
[1:43:56] He'll give you what you need if you let
[1:43:59] him. If you'll make King Jesus your
[1:44:02] first resource instead of your last
[1:44:05] resort, you'll keep pouring and pouring
[1:44:09] and pouring. And one of these days,
[1:44:12] those children who seemingly don't
[1:44:14] appreciate you enough now
[1:44:18] will come around and praise you and
[1:44:21] bless you because you poured into them
[1:44:24] when you felt like you had nothing to
[1:44:28] give. Just because you you do what you
[1:44:31] what you think is right doesn't mean you
[1:44:34] feel valued at doing it. But I want you
[1:44:36] to know there's a God looking over your
[1:44:40] shoulder who loves you,
[1:44:44] who sees your sacrifice.
[1:44:47] I don't expect any of us men to really
[1:44:50] understand
[1:44:52] this. We
[1:44:54] are parenthetically from another planet.
[1:45:00] We don't have the same wiring in our
[1:45:03] brain that a woman
[1:45:05] has. Amen.
[1:45:08] We don't look at things the same way. We
[1:45:10] don't express things the same way. We
[1:45:13] don't look at life the same way.
[1:45:16] And though you may have some estrogen in
[1:45:18] you,
[1:45:20] brother, you have not yet come to
[1:45:23] understand, nor I, what a woman goes
[1:45:28] through, not just in
[1:45:30] motherhood, but every month of her life
[1:45:34] and sometimes way beyond the flower of
[1:45:38] her years, there are rushes of chemicals
[1:45:42] and hormones that rush through her body
[1:45:45] that leave her a wreck that leave her uh
[1:45:48] emotionally uh seemingly unstable. Even
[1:45:51] at times she's holding on to try to try
[1:45:54] to get
[1:45:56] through. Somebody said, "I don't
[1:45:58] understand that." No, you don't
[1:45:59] understand that because you weren't made
[1:46:01] like that.
[1:46:03] God knew exactly what it was going to
[1:46:05] take for a woman to be strong
[1:46:08] enough to stand against resistance from
[1:46:12] her children.
[1:46:14] and yet be tender enough
[1:46:19] to look in their eye when they're a
[1:46:21] teenager and they say everything's all
[1:46:23] right. And a mama so built, so wired, so
[1:46:28] chemically
[1:46:29] constructed that she looks with
[1:46:32] spiritual eyes right into the eyes of a
[1:46:34] boy or a girl saying, "Everything's all
[1:46:36] right. Nothing's wrong." And she has the
[1:46:39] ability to know when they're smiling,
[1:46:41] when they're laughing, when they're
[1:46:42] joking, that it's overkill, and that
[1:46:45] there's really something desperately
[1:46:47] wrong inside.
[1:46:49] Mama knows.
[1:46:51] Mama often knows when she's being lied
[1:46:54] to.
[1:46:56] Deceived, fooled.
[1:46:59] Why didn't she say anything? Sometimes
[1:47:02] she does, sometimes she doesn't.
[1:47:05] Sometimes she doesn't because she hopes
[1:47:07] that it's not true. She wishes that it
[1:47:10] were not so. She prays that she's wrong,
[1:47:14] but she's wired in such and such a way.
[1:47:17] Especially, we're talking about the
[1:47:19] redeemed motherhood. We're talking about
[1:47:21] a godly mother. We're talking about a
[1:47:23] Holy Ghost mother. But we're also
[1:47:26] acknowledging that even physically, she
[1:47:29] is created a bit different than the man.
[1:47:34] And you're going to be glad of that one
[1:47:35] of these days if you're not
[1:47:37] already. Do you understand? Her husband
[1:47:41] is dead. Creditors are knocking at the
[1:47:44] door threatening to take her sons off
[1:47:46] like a bunch of captured
[1:47:49] animals. Mothers today, even Christian
[1:47:52] mothers, even New Hope mothers have
[1:47:55] financial
[1:47:57] concerns. Those should not be the burden
[1:48:01] of a mother.
[1:48:04] Oh, let me just take a little water
[1:48:09] here. Mother shouldn't have to
[1:48:11] worry about where she's going to lay her
[1:48:15] head, where she's going to feed her
[1:48:18] children, and what she's going to feed
[1:48:21] them. But if you know women like I do,
[1:48:24] they take it
[1:48:25] on. They can't help themselves. They're
[1:48:28] emotionally attached. They're 100%
[1:48:31] vested into this thing. And they not
[1:48:35] only carry the burdens that a wife and a
[1:48:37] mother are created and chosen to carry,
[1:48:39] but they sometimes carry
[1:48:42] burdens
[1:48:44] that we as men, as husbands, as
[1:48:48] fathers don't shoulder enough of the
[1:48:51] load. There are times that we don't. Is
[1:48:53] there any brother going to get in here
[1:48:55] and say amen with me? There are times
[1:48:57] we're distracted, we're tired, we're
[1:48:59] we're this, we're that, we're the other.
[1:49:04] You, you know, you could have preached
[1:49:06] this message 25 years ago, you wouldn't
[1:49:08] have to mention phones.
[1:49:12] Now, it's not just a football game. It's
[1:49:14] it's it's holding it in your hand.
[1:49:17] It's I got to catch up and you you know,
[1:49:20] I'm not going very far. And so a woman
[1:49:23] has to sometimes get under some of that
[1:49:25] load that she was not created,
[1:49:30] not
[1:49:32] wired, and not chosen to carry.
[1:49:36] That's our responsibility.
[1:49:38] I'm not talking about situations where
[1:49:41] you have agreements and and and
[1:49:44] someone's waiting on a job. I Please
[1:49:47] don't let your mind go there.
[1:49:50] You've got to supply what you can supply
[1:49:52] when you can supply it. I'm not trying
[1:49:55] to generalize everything, but I'm trying
[1:49:58] to tell you that a mother today, she's
[1:50:00] got those uh stretched resources.
[1:50:03] Sometimes she doesn't even know how much
[1:50:05] she has. She's not allowed close enough
[1:50:08] to the balance to even know how much she
[1:50:10] has to spend at the grocery store.
[1:50:18] I've had men sit in my office and say,
[1:50:21] "I give my wife an
[1:50:23] allowance." Well, she's not your paper
[1:50:25] boy.
[1:50:27] She's not your yard man.
[1:50:29] Why don't you put her name on the
[1:50:31] account?
[1:50:34] Amen. Why don't you man up just a little
[1:50:37] bit?
[1:50:38] so that she can be renewed, recharged,
[1:50:41] so that she can get out from under,
[1:50:43] wiggle out from under some of that
[1:50:44] burden, some of that responsibility.
[1:50:46] She's already going to carry her own.
[1:50:48] She shouldn't have to carry any of ours.
[1:50:50] She's feeling in insufficient. She's
[1:50:53] feeling inadequate. She's feeling like
[1:50:55] she's failing those that she loves the
[1:50:59] most. It's not all the time. It's not
[1:51:01] every year. It's not every month, but
[1:51:04] there are these seasons and cycles of
[1:51:06] feeling like that everything you do is
[1:51:09] not enough.
[1:51:11] And you're not just blaming other
[1:51:13] people. You're blaming yourself.
[1:51:16] You realize that you just don't always
[1:51:19] have the answer. If you did, you
[1:51:22] wouldn't need a savior. If you did, you
[1:51:24] wouldn't need a counselor. You wouldn't
[1:51:25] need the Holy Ghost. You're not always
[1:51:28] going to have the answer. And even when
[1:51:30] mothers feel they're most of the time a
[1:51:32] failure, they feel
[1:51:34] unappreciated,
[1:51:36] undervalued, and taken for granted.
[1:51:44] Amen.
[1:51:46] When a mother's taking care of her
[1:51:48] children, she's doing what a mother
[1:51:50] ought to do.
[1:51:53] When a daddy's taking care of his
[1:51:55] children, he's babysitting.
[1:52:02] No, that's not the way it
[1:52:06] works. This mom felt like she had
[1:52:09] nothing left to give. She even felt like
[1:52:12] it was her fault that she owed this debt
[1:52:16] that she inherited from her husband. and
[1:52:19] she realized that she was about to lose
[1:52:21] the next most precious things that she
[1:52:25] had ever had in her life, her two
[1:52:28] sons. They were going to go serve
[1:52:30] somewhere. She didn't know where they
[1:52:32] would end up. She didn't know how long
[1:52:33] it would be before she would see them
[1:52:36] again. And she wondered if she would
[1:52:37] ever see them again. As a last resort,
[1:52:42] she cried out to the prophet, "Help me.
[1:52:46] Help me. I need some help.
[1:52:49] I've spoken in depth to this church
[1:52:52] through the years about the
[1:52:54] Targums. Targums are pieces of
[1:52:58] literature that are written in
[1:53:02] Aramaic. It's an important language
[1:53:05] because it is the common language of the
[1:53:08] first century or what we call the second
[1:53:11] temple period.
[1:53:13] In the times of Jesus, every person,
[1:53:17] every common man would have not been
[1:53:20] communicating perhaps anymore in in
[1:53:23] Hebrew or what is sometimes referred to
[1:53:26] as high Hebrew because the Greek culture
[1:53:30] had so invaded. The language was
[1:53:33] suffering. It was not being taught like
[1:53:35] it had once been taught. And there was a
[1:53:39] language that was acceptable. It was
[1:53:41] Aramaic. It was between the Hebrew, it
[1:53:44] was between the Greek, it had pieces of
[1:53:46] this language and this language. Uh, if
[1:53:50] you wanted to compare it to something,
[1:53:52] it's almost like a dialect of of
[1:53:56] Yiddish, which is a little Hebrew, a
[1:53:58] little German, a little this, a little
[1:54:00] of that. Or maybe Pennsylvania Dutch,
[1:54:03] which is a little German, a little of
[1:54:04] this, a little of that. A little salt, a
[1:54:06] little pepper, a little paprika, a
[1:54:08] little Tabasco sauce, whatever.
[1:54:11] God in his in his greatness has uh
[1:54:15] preserved some
[1:54:17] writings from the time of first century
[1:54:20] second temple period that help us to
[1:54:24] understand how the scriptures were being
[1:54:27] looked at in the time of Jesus. I'm not
[1:54:30] going much further into this, but I
[1:54:32] wanted you to understand that there is
[1:54:35] some powerful lessons that can be
[1:54:37] learned by occasionally looking at the
[1:54:41] Tarums. And I have done that now for
[1:54:43] many years since spending so much time
[1:54:45] in Israel. One of the Tarums is called
[1:54:49] the Targum of Jonathan or we would say
[1:54:52] Jonathan's
[1:54:53] Tarum. And it's so interesting how often
[1:54:58] it runs with such parallel to the
[1:55:02] historian
[1:55:03] Josephus who writes amazing details of
[1:55:08] life at the time of the second temple
[1:55:11] period. I said all of that to to say
[1:55:15] this. Targum Jonathan and the writings
[1:55:18] of Josephus, the antiquities of the
[1:55:21] Jews, some of you have read some of it.
[1:55:24] They both identify the woman, the widow
[1:55:28] woman as the widow of the prophet
[1:55:32] Obadiah who secretly hid and provided
[1:55:37] food for 100
[1:55:40] prophets to protect them from
[1:55:44] Jezebel, which Josephus postulates was
[1:55:48] the source of these debts. I find that
[1:55:52] kind of interesting, don't you? In First
[1:55:55] Kings chapter 18, let's
[1:55:58] hurry. Verse one. And it came to pass
[1:56:00] after many days that the word of the
[1:56:03] Lord came to Elijah in the third year,
[1:56:05] saying, Go show thyself unto Ahab, and I
[1:56:08] will send rain upon the earth. Elijah
[1:56:12] went to show himself unto Ahab. And
[1:56:14] there was a sore famine in Samaria. And
[1:56:16] Ahab called Obadiah, which was the
[1:56:18] governor of his house. He was the
[1:56:21] manager of his
[1:56:24] estate. He was considered the prime
[1:56:27] minister over the business of King
[1:56:31] Ahab. He was the equivalent of Joseph to
[1:56:37] Pharaoh. He was the rightand man.
[1:56:40] Obadiah was prophetic. He studied with
[1:56:43] the prophets.
[1:56:45] He was prophetic. He had the burden of
[1:56:47] the Lord upon him. And God, hallelujah,
[1:56:51] had strategically placed him in the
[1:56:54] palace of Ahab. And if you know anything
[1:56:56] about Ahab, he had a lot to deal with.
[1:57:00] And he was rather a marshmallow. He
[1:57:04] needed a backbone. And God gave Oadiah
[1:57:06] the backbone.
[1:57:08] And so it said, Ahab called Oadiah,
[1:57:10] which was the governor of his house. Now
[1:57:12] Oadiah feared the Lord greatly. He
[1:57:14] wasn't a skunk. He wasn't a dead beatat.
[1:57:17] He wasn't somebody who wasted his money,
[1:57:19] went off and died, and left a debt with
[1:57:20] his wife. He was a noble man. For it was
[1:57:23] so when Jezebel cut off the prophets of
[1:57:26] the Lord. When she cut them off, she cut
[1:57:28] them off. He doesn't mean she cut off
[1:57:31] communication with them. He means she
[1:57:33] had their heads cut off and hid them.
[1:57:36] This is what Oadiah did. Obadiah took a
[1:57:39] hundred of these prophets and hid them
[1:57:41] by 50 in a cave and fed them of his own
[1:57:46] expense with bread and water. We don't
[1:57:50] know how long that went on, but it went
[1:57:51] on for a mount of time. And Ahab said
[1:57:53] unto Obadiah, "Go into the land unto all
[1:57:55] fountains of water and unto all brooks
[1:57:57] per adventure we may find grass to save
[1:58:00] the horses and mules alive that we lose
[1:58:02] not all the beasts." So they divided the
[1:58:05] land between them to pass through it.
[1:58:07] Ahab went one way by himself. Obadiah
[1:58:10] went another way by himself. And as
[1:58:12] Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah
[1:58:14] met him. And he knew him, fell on his
[1:58:17] face, and said, "Art thou that my Lord
[1:58:21] Elijah? Are you my Lord Elijah?" And he
[1:58:24] answered him, "I am. Go tell thy Lord.
[1:58:27] Behold, Elijah's here." Go tell Ahab.
[1:58:30] Right. How would you like to be the one
[1:58:34] who goes to tell the mambby pami
[1:58:36] weakened king that that prophet that you
[1:58:39] don't like very much is on his way to
[1:58:41] your house and he said what if I sin
[1:58:45] this is Oadiah what if I sin that thou
[1:58:47] wouldest deliver thy servant into the
[1:58:49] hand of Ahab he's liable to kill me if I
[1:58:52] go and tell him you're standing at his
[1:58:54] door I want you to understand the
[1:58:56] seriousness of this situation and he
[1:58:59] said what have I seen All
[1:59:01] right, let's go on. And the Lord thy God
[1:59:04] liveth. As the Lord thy God liveth,
[1:59:06] there's no nations or kingdoms whether
[1:59:08] my Lord hath not sent to seek thee. And
[1:59:11] when they said, he's not here, he took
[1:59:14] an oath of the kingdom and nation, and
[1:59:16] they found thee not conveniently. And
[1:59:18] now thou sayest, go tell thy Lord,
[1:59:21] behold Elijah's here. When he wanted
[1:59:23] you, you were not to be found. Now he's
[1:59:25] changed his mind, and here you show up.
[1:59:27] Paraphrase for you. And it shall come to
[1:59:30] pass as soon as I'm gone from thee that
[1:59:32] the spirit of the Lord shall carry thee
[1:59:34] whetherither I know not. And so when I
[1:59:36] come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
[1:59:38] thee, he shall slay me. But I, thy
[1:59:40] servant, fear the Lord from thy
[1:59:43] youth. Was it not told my lord what I
[1:59:47] did when Jezebel slew the prophets of
[1:59:50] the Lord? How I hid a hundred men of the
[1:59:52] Lord's prophets by 50 in a cave and fed
[1:59:55] them with bread and water? So this is
[2:00:00] our understanding of who the widow woman
[2:00:03] was. She was most likely the widow of
[2:00:07] Oadiah. Here's what Joseph said in the
[2:00:10] antiquities of the Jews. I'm hurrying.
[2:00:13] For they say that the widow of Oadiah,
[2:00:16] Ahab's steward, came to him and said
[2:00:19] that he was not ignorant how her husband
[2:00:21] had preserved the prophets that were to
[2:00:23] be slain by Jezebel, the wife of Ahab.
[2:00:25] Therefore, she said that he hid a
[2:00:27] hundred of them and had borrowed money
[2:00:29] for their maintenance and that after her
[2:00:32] husband's death, she and her children
[2:00:34] were carried away to be made slaves by
[2:00:36] the creditors. And she desired of him to
[2:00:38] have mercy upon her on account of what
[2:00:40] her husband did and afford her some
[2:00:43] assistance. Somebody ought to say, "But
[2:00:45] God." But God. And when he asked her
[2:00:48] what she had in the
[2:00:50] house, she said nothing but a very small
[2:00:53] quantity of oil in a cruise. So the
[2:00:56] prophet bid her go away and borrow great
[2:00:58] many vessels of her neighbors. And when
[2:01:00] she had shut her chamber door to pour
[2:01:02] oil into them, for that God would fill
[2:01:04] them full. And when the woman had done
[2:01:07] what she was commanded to do and b her
[2:01:09] children, bring every one of the
[2:01:10] vessels, all were filled. And look at
[2:01:13] what it says. and not one
[2:01:19] the ministry of the last drop.
[2:01:22] I'm telling you that if you will stay
[2:01:25] full of him, if you will recommmit and
[2:01:29] reconsecrate, sister, your life, your
[2:01:33] motherhood, your service to your family,
[2:01:36] if you'll just keep saying, "Lord, I'm
[2:01:38] running low.
[2:01:40] I need some more oil. I need some more
[2:01:43] meal. I need some more strength to
[2:01:47] continue to do what you've called me to
[2:01:49] do. He'll meet you.
[2:01:52] He'll meet you at your point of need.
[2:01:54] Let the weak say,
[2:02:00] I hope I am able. I hope I can do it. I
[2:02:05] sure hope it works out that I can. Mm-
[2:02:07] No, no, no, no, no.
[2:02:11] That won't do it.
[2:02:14] Let the weak say, I am. I'm going to be
[2:02:17] able.
[2:02:19] I am strong. I'm going to do what I've
[2:02:21] purposed in my heart because he is
[2:02:24] strong in me.
[2:02:26] Our vocabulary dictates,
[2:02:29] yes, a lot of circumstances in our
[2:02:32] lives. Do you believe that? Snared by
[2:02:35] the words of our mouth, we are, the
[2:02:37] scripture said. I want to go on. not one
[2:02:40] left empty. She came to the prophet,
[2:02:42] told him they were all full, upon which
[2:02:44] he advised her to go away, sell the oil,
[2:02:46] pay the creditors, what was owing them,
[2:02:48] for that there would be some surplus of
[2:02:50] the price of the oil, which she might
[2:02:52] make use of for the maintenance of her
[2:02:53] children. And thus did Elisha discharge
[2:02:56] the woman's debt, and free her from the
[2:02:58] vexation of her creditors. This is
[2:03:00] recorded as a perpetual memorial, not
[2:03:03] only in the scripture, but details even
[2:03:06] provided in historical references that I
[2:03:09] just read to let you know that God was
[2:03:11] not just looking out for Oadiah's widow.
[2:03:14] He was looking out for Oadiah.
[2:03:18] He didn't want his godly reputation
[2:03:20] ruined.
[2:03:21] God was looking out. I want you to put
[2:03:24] yourselves in the shoes of a widowed
[2:03:26] mother for just a second. Your husband
[2:03:28] just died.
[2:03:31] That's usually about the time we say,
[2:03:32] "God
[2:03:34] forbid." Your husband has just died and
[2:03:37] you're left with a substantial amount of
[2:03:38] debt to pay off. In hopes to raise
[2:03:41] enough money to pay off the debt, you
[2:03:42] liquidate all your belongings and you
[2:03:44] still don't have enough money to pay off
[2:03:46] the debts. On top of all of these
[2:03:48] circumstances, the bill collector needs
[2:03:50] the rest of the amount by the first of
[2:03:52] the month, or your two sons will be
[2:03:54] stripped away from you and sold into
[2:03:56] slavery. You can't fathom the idea of
[2:03:59] your two precious children being taken
[2:04:01] away from you, but it seems to be your
[2:04:03] only option. Commentators are quick to
[2:04:06] point out the legitimacy of the
[2:04:08] creditor's logic from the Mosaic law. If
[2:04:11] you want to write it down, Leviticus
[2:04:13] 2539 and 40. In an ideal world, I would
[2:04:16] take time, could take time, would have
[2:04:18] time to read. I don't. Leviticus 2539
[2:04:21] and 40. You decide to talk to Elisha the
[2:04:25] prophet. You get your courage up hoping
[2:04:27] there's something that he can do for
[2:04:28] you, but his hands are tied and he
[2:04:30] doesn't know how to help you. It's a
[2:04:33] good thing. Oh, but I wasn't around
[2:04:34] because he might be one of those
[2:04:36] husbands always tell his wife, "Don't
[2:04:37] tell the preacher. Don't tell nobody
[2:04:39] else. Don't tell Brother Greley. Don't
[2:04:41] tell nobody. Don't let anybody know.
[2:04:42] Don't tell our
[2:04:44] business." I'm glad Oai was
[2:04:47] gone. He couldn't hold on to pride.
[2:04:51] He said, she said, I got to get in touch
[2:04:54] with the only one I know that might be
[2:04:56] able to help. In devastation, you pick
[2:04:58] up your things and prepare to leave. But
[2:05:00] then Elisha asks you a question that
[2:05:03] will forever change your life. He looks
[2:05:05] at you and says, you're in, you're
[2:05:07] imagining that you're there. He looks at
[2:05:08] you and he says, "What do you have in
[2:05:10] your house?" The question of the prophet
[2:05:13] resounds across the chasm of time and
[2:05:16] space. It is because it's relevant for
[2:05:18] us now, especially on Mother's Day.
[2:05:21] Mama,
[2:05:23] what do you have?
[2:05:27] You've stood around the altar Sunday
[2:05:28] after Sunday. You've told the Lord, "I'm
[2:05:31] empty. I need you to pass by. I'm
[2:05:34] discouraged. I need you to help me. My
[2:05:36] children in trouble. I need you to help
[2:05:38] me." You've told the Lord over and over
[2:05:40] again. Now, the word of the Lord is unto
[2:05:42] you today. He's asking you the question,
[2:05:44] "What is it in your house? What do you
[2:05:47] have? You've told me what you don't
[2:05:49] have. You don't have enough support. You
[2:05:52] don't have maybe enough support even
[2:05:54] from your husband, the father of your
[2:05:56] children. You You've told the Lord that.
[2:05:58] Now the Lord is asking, "What do you
[2:06:00] have?" And I'm asking you,
[2:06:04] mothers, what do you
[2:06:08] have beside
[2:06:13] that? If we would save our children, it
[2:06:16] begins with rightly answering Elisha's
[2:06:18] questions. What do you have in the
[2:06:21] house? The story before us is a bonafide
[2:06:24] miracle through the prophet Elisha. God
[2:06:27] does the impossible. That's not what he
[2:06:30] does. That's who he is. God causes the
[2:06:34] oil in the jar. We're going to call it
[2:06:35] mama's
[2:06:36] oil. God caused mama's oil to multiply.
[2:06:42] We're going to soon see the point is not
[2:06:44] merely that the oil was multiplied. The
[2:06:46] greater miracle is that the mother was
[2:06:48] able to save the lives of her children,
[2:06:51] provide for their future, and not only
[2:06:53] that, be a blessing
[2:06:55] to the larger community. Amen. See, here
[2:06:58] you are thinking you don't have enough
[2:06:59] to bless your children and your husband.
[2:07:01] And the reality is he's pouring in.
[2:07:05] You're not perhaps giving him all the
[2:07:07] chances that you can because he not only
[2:07:10] wants to provide what you have need of
[2:07:12] so that you can pour into your children,
[2:07:14] but he wants even the community,
[2:07:17] even your neighbors, even your those
[2:07:19] around you to be blessed
[2:07:22] because you're drinking.
[2:07:25] Because you're feasting,
[2:07:27] I want you to know if you're if you're
[2:07:29] filling up, you're going to give out.
[2:07:32] Amen. Help me now. I'm not going to stop
[2:07:35] till I'm done.
[2:07:38] So, the oil was in the house. We got to
[2:07:41] learn some things quickly about this
[2:07:42] oil. It seems to be noted that this
[2:07:45] legacy was located in the house in
[2:07:47] Mama's house. A pot, a jar, some kind of
[2:07:52] container of oil.
[2:07:55] Elisha would have been familiar with the
[2:07:57] process that brought this woman into his
[2:07:59] office. To come to Elisha to explain
[2:08:02] that a creditor was going to sell her
[2:08:04] children into slavery was an indication
[2:08:06] that she sold everything already of
[2:08:07] value. She's at the end of the road. And
[2:08:10] he simply asked her, "Well, what do you
[2:08:11] have in your
[2:08:13] house?" God's asking you, "What do you
[2:08:15] have?" Elisha's profound question, "What
[2:08:18] do you have in your house?" Her answer,
[2:08:20] "Nothing except a small jar.
[2:08:24] of
[2:08:25] oil. You may feel mother like you have
[2:08:27] nothing. Wife, you may feel like you
[2:08:30] have nothing. No energy, no patience, no
[2:08:32] answers. But God works with your except
[2:08:37] except a small part. God works with your
[2:08:39] accept. That tiny bit of faith, that
[2:08:42] last ounce of love, that small prayer, a
[2:08:45] small song, calling on the name of
[2:08:48] Jesus, speaking his name over your
[2:08:50] children.
[2:08:52] God will work with your
[2:08:54] except you're not enough is God's
[2:08:57] starting point.
[2:08:59] It's not his limitation.
[2:09:02] I'm waiting on your amen. So Elisha
[2:09:05] asked the question, but he already knew
[2:09:07] the answer. He was a prophet for crying
[2:09:09] out loud. So in asking the question,
[2:09:12] Elisha is letting the mother know that
[2:09:15] God has already seen the situation. He
[2:09:17] knows the furniture's gone.
[2:09:20] He knows the table is gone. He knows the
[2:09:23] extra dresses are gone. Everything is
[2:09:26] gone that can go. But God knows that
[2:09:29] there's one little bottle of oil that
[2:09:32] mama's keeping close to her
[2:09:35] heart. And yet he asked anyway, "What do
[2:09:38] you have? What's
[2:09:40] left? What could it be? She'd save back
[2:09:43] this little bit of oil." But there's no
[2:09:46] way in the natural that he could have
[2:09:47] known that those things had market
[2:09:49] value. So the real question, what's
[2:09:52] left? That's what Elisha was asking
[2:09:54] about. He wanted to know what she had
[2:09:56] stashed away, what was worth holding on
[2:09:59] to, keeping back. The text says a jar, a
[2:10:02] small jar, or or a pot of oil. In
[2:10:05] Hebrew, the word is
[2:10:07] osuk. And ouk is only used one time.
[2:10:11] Thank you. It's only used one time in
[2:10:13] the scripture. The Hebrew and Aramaic
[2:10:16] lexicon of the Old Testament identifies
[2:10:19] the
[2:10:20] root. It uh it it it
[2:10:25] says let let me read what I have here.
[2:10:28] This is evidence that this jar of oil
[2:10:31] was not a vessel that held larger supply
[2:10:33] of oil for cooking, but it was a smaller
[2:10:37] vessel that had only that held only
[2:10:40] anointing oil.
[2:10:43] oil that was used on the body after
[2:10:46] bathing for medicinal use. The word used
[2:10:50] here means
[2:10:52] save and anointing of
[2:10:56] oil. The literal translation save, I
[2:10:59] have nothing. Save anointing of oil,
[2:11:04] which means just enough oil to slather
[2:11:08] on a body after it has been bathed.
[2:11:12] most likely for
[2:11:15] burial. Mama is holding up
[2:11:19] enough so that her children don't have
[2:11:21] to worry about how they're going to bury
[2:11:25] her. The only oil that she had left, not
[2:11:28] a pot, but osuk, it means one small.
[2:11:33] Thank you. One small individual
[2:11:37] portion. It's a unique word here. You
[2:11:40] can take that down. possibly for a small
[2:11:43] anointing
[2:11:45] flask. This oil would have been scented
[2:11:47] with crushed or steamed
[2:11:51] spices. Perfume and cosmetics were worn
[2:11:55] in these days by men and women. We're
[2:11:57] not talking about makeup. We're talking
[2:12:00] about rich and poor. In ancient Israel,
[2:12:02] practically everyone used scented oil to
[2:12:05] make offensive odors and to prot to
[2:12:08] mask.
[2:12:12] I need a breath. I'm reading too
[2:12:15] fast. We don't need any help making
[2:12:18] offensive
[2:12:19] odors. We need help masking
[2:12:23] them. Both men and women would use these
[2:12:26] fragrant oils to mask offensive odors
[2:12:29] and to protect the skin from the dry
[2:12:30] heat and the bright sun. And you can see
[2:12:33] where I found that information. Life in
[2:12:36] biblical Israel. Thank you.
[2:12:39] That's pretty important. This is not
[2:12:41] just any oil. This isn't cooking
[2:12:43] oil. This is special
[2:12:46] oil. Highly valuable oil, very expensive
[2:12:50] oil. The descriptive language here
[2:12:53] appears that mama was entirely destitute
[2:12:57] of the oil which was essential for the
[2:12:59] preparation of food. She only had oil,
[2:13:01] special oil, oil for anointing. since it
[2:13:04] had been held back and not already sold
[2:13:06] or bartered. Many suppose that the small
[2:13:09] flask of oil was to be used to anoint
[2:13:11] her body upon her death. She was
[2:13:14] literally planning to leave it behind as
[2:13:17] a legacy gift so that her sons would not
[2:13:20] have to bear the cost of purchasing such
[2:13:22] oil upon her death. She was pre-planning
[2:13:25] her funeral
[2:13:27] arrangements. She was making sure that
[2:13:29] they didn't have to worry about it. in
[2:13:31] the message perfect strength by perfect
[2:13:34] weakness. I I want to go to paragraph
[2:13:39] 295. No, I want to go to paragraph 296.
[2:13:42] I'm cutting some. One had just a vessel
[2:13:45] with a little oil in it and she had
[2:13:47] nothing. Her two sons going to be sold
[2:13:49] for bondsmen. She had nothing else she
[2:13:51] could do with this little vessel of oil.
[2:13:53] Wasn't very much. She was at the end.
[2:13:55] Elijah said to her, "What have you got
[2:13:57] in your house?"
[2:14:00] said, "Just a little oil." We're talking
[2:14:01] about Elisha. Go to your neighbors.
[2:14:04] Borrow plenty of them there. Look,
[2:14:07] getting ready before it even happens. H
[2:14:10] get ready. David heard the sound in the
[2:14:12] mberry bushes. Elijah saw a cloud just
[2:14:15] the size of a hand and he said, "I hear
[2:14:17] the sound."
[2:14:20] There's faith in those words. Let the
[2:14:22] weak say I'm strong. Instead of saying,
[2:14:25] "I'm empty," say, "I've got just
[2:14:26] enough." I've got just enough. Because
[2:14:29] when I use what I've got, he knows how
[2:14:32] to give me more.
[2:14:34] He said, "Fill the house. Go get some
[2:14:37] empty vessels." If God can only get some
[2:14:40] empty
[2:14:41] vessels, he said, "They're, look,
[2:14:43] getting ready before it ever happened."
[2:14:44] If God can only get some empty vessels,
[2:14:46] he said, "Fill the house full of them."
[2:14:49] Amen. See what God wants. God has got to
[2:14:51] have empty vessels. We've had so much
[2:14:53] doctrine, so much ecclesiastical
[2:14:55] nonsense. Until we're down at the end of
[2:14:57] the barrel, there's only one thing left.
[2:14:59] Turn to God
[2:15:03] I can't understand all this papal
[2:15:05] business. There's one thing left. Turn
[2:15:07] to God and his word.
[2:15:13] I can't explain the fact that that in
[2:15:15] the telling of the
[2:15:17] visions of
[2:15:19] 33, it seems that brother Brandham began
[2:15:22] in in the latter part of his life to to
[2:15:25] mention uh
[2:15:27] interpretations and
[2:15:29] fulfillments as though these things were
[2:15:33] seen in the vision.
[2:15:35] Now visions are by
[2:15:37] symbols and as brother Brandon would go
[2:15:39] along telling them he would mix in with
[2:15:42] the symbols some of the
[2:15:46] fulfillments. When you are following
[2:15:48] that all the way through it can be kind
[2:15:50] of a bumpy road. Here's what I know. I
[2:15:54] know that the answer is to turn to God
[2:15:57] and his word with everything we've got.
[2:16:01] I don't know how a brown cow gives white
[2:16:03] milk that can be churned to make yellow
[2:16:05] butter. But what I do know is that God
[2:16:08] is God is God is God. He is Jesus Christ
[2:16:14] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:16:16] What I do know is there's one God and
[2:16:18] there's one person of the Godhead, Lord
[2:16:21] Jesus Christ. What I do know is that
[2:16:24] with baptism must be administered in the
[2:16:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and not in
[2:16:30] trinitarian titles. I do know that
[2:16:34] holiness is right and separation from
[2:16:37] the world is right.
[2:16:40] I do know that God will help us if we
[2:16:43] let him.
[2:16:45] He's a gentleman. He won't always
[2:16:47] wrestle you down and break your neck to
[2:16:50] be able to talk to you, but he'll talk
[2:16:52] to you if you'll shut up
[2:16:55] and you'll listen to him. He'll talk.
[2:16:59] That's why some folks never slow down
[2:17:02] because they're afraid of what's going
[2:17:03] God's going to say if they do. He's
[2:17:05] coming.
[2:17:08] He's coming.
[2:17:10] Somebody said, "That sounds so creepy."
[2:17:11] Oh, he's coming. He's coming after you.
[2:17:14] You belong to him. You don't belong to
[2:17:16] you. He bought you. He paid a price
[2:17:20] with his own life's blood. Glory to God.
[2:17:23] She had enough to take care of and her
[2:17:24] kids
[2:17:28] $299 and everything else and pay off the
[2:17:30] debts. Just what little she had
[2:17:31] consecrated to God following the word of
[2:17:33] the prophet. She come out right. God
[2:17:37] send us a prophet that'll take the word
[2:17:38] of God that will not take something else
[2:17:41] but just get empty vessels. If God can
[2:17:44] just get empty vessels and then take the
[2:17:46] word of God and pour it into the person.
[2:17:49] He said, "Oh, they say I I I I shook
[2:17:52] when I received it. I spoke in tongues
[2:17:53] when I received it. I dance in the
[2:17:54] spirit." He said, "Forget it. See,
[2:17:56] forget it. Just stay there." And it's
[2:17:58] true. It's right. This is right. Just
[2:18:00] stay there until it comes. Till the
[2:18:02] vessel's full. If you don't do any
[2:18:04] jerking, if you don't do any crying, if
[2:18:06] you don't do any kind of manifestation,
[2:18:08] stay there until he fills you so full of
[2:18:11] who he is. Come on.
[2:18:15] Amen. You've got it, mama. You've got
[2:18:18] it. You've been in the altar yourself.
[2:18:20] You know what it
[2:18:22] means. For whatever reason, this mother
[2:18:25] and a recent widow widow had kept back
[2:18:28] that little bit of oil. She didn't sell
[2:18:31] it. She stashed it away. You might find
[2:18:34] it a strange inheritance to leave
[2:18:35] behind, but to be very plain, she wanted
[2:18:37] to spare them the stench of death and to
[2:18:41] relieve their social and moral
[2:18:43] obligation of having to acquire oil. Can
[2:18:47] you imagine having to go borrow, beg for
[2:18:49] enough oil to kill the older on your
[2:18:53] mother's body when you're laying her to
[2:18:56] rest? She had no intention of selling
[2:18:58] that little portion of oil. But now
[2:19:00] things have changed. And even she if if
[2:19:03] she sold it, it was not enough to pay
[2:19:05] off the debt. Here comes a prophet. What
[2:19:07] do you here? What what what do you have
[2:19:09] in the house? Having been married to a
[2:19:12] spiritual man, the woman in the text is
[2:19:13] sensitive to the moving of the spirit
[2:19:15] perhaps, and she knows the Lord is
[2:19:17] speaking. So standing between joy and
[2:19:19] fear, hope and doubt, she answers, "Just
[2:19:21] a little jar of oil is all I have left."
[2:19:23] That was all she had left to leave
[2:19:25] behind. Can I tell you what you need to
[2:19:28] save your children? Can I tell you what
[2:19:31] you need to ensure their future and to
[2:19:34] help your community? Your answer is in
[2:19:36] your house.
[2:19:39] Can I tell you that your answer is in
[2:19:41] your house? Can I tell you that what you
[2:19:44] need to save your children and bless
[2:19:46] your community is in your house. It's
[2:19:49] where God has placed you. It's where he
[2:19:52] puts you. It's where he's going to feed
[2:19:55] you. It's where he's going to sustain
[2:19:58] you.
[2:19:59] You tell the devil he's a liar.
[2:20:04] I'm not going anywhere. I'm not
[2:20:06] following you anywhere. I'm going to
[2:20:09] stay in the house. My answer is not out
[2:20:12] there.
[2:20:14] What have you got left in your house?
[2:20:16] Just a little bit of oil. Let me ask you
[2:20:18] on this Mother's Day, what do you have
[2:20:19] in your house? For only then can we
[2:20:21] follow this divine strategy. Once the
[2:20:23] mother acknowledges that she only has a
[2:20:25] jar of oil, Elisha shares with her the
[2:20:28] divine strategy that will save her
[2:20:30] children, bless their lives, revitalize
[2:20:32] the community. He says in verse three,
[2:20:34] "Go borrow some vessels. Borrow not a
[2:20:36] few." You see, your level of faith will
[2:20:39] determine Your level of faith will
[2:20:41] determine the level of your harvest. Not
[2:20:45] the level of your supply,
[2:20:48] but the level of your
[2:20:51] faith. Because the prophet said, "You go
[2:20:53] borrow a bunch of vessels. Get as many
[2:20:55] as you can. Get all empty vessels. Get
[2:20:57] them in here as many as you can. And
[2:20:58] from that little bit of oil, just enough
[2:21:02] to take the stench off of a dead body.
[2:21:05] I'm going to multiply that oil."
[2:21:11] Paragraph 341. Perfect strength. That's
[2:21:13] the need of today. That's what we need
[2:21:15] today. We need empty vessels. Yes, sir.
[2:21:17] So God can fill them. God can't use them
[2:21:19] as long as they're already filled up.
[2:21:20] full of theological training. God can't
[2:21:22] use that. God has to have empty vessels
[2:21:25] so he can fill them up. 3:43 That's what
[2:21:29] it was at Pentecost. They had empty
[2:21:30] vessels so God could fill them up.
[2:21:32] Brother, this day demands it. This day
[2:21:34] got to have it. We'll have that or
[2:21:37] perish. We've got to have living water
[2:21:39] or we'll perish. We've got to have the
[2:21:42] real oil or we'll perish.
[2:21:47] You still here? Good.
[2:21:50] Go borrow from your
[2:21:54] neighbors. Empty
[2:21:57] vessels might be like coat hangers.
[2:22:00] Nobody has too many to spare. They're
[2:22:03] holding on to
[2:22:04] them. She said, "These are strange
[2:22:07] instructions. The miracle required her
[2:22:09] obedience despite her
[2:22:12] exhaustion. Trust when I can barely
[2:22:14] function. Give more patience when I have
[2:22:17] none left. pour out more when I'm so
[2:22:20] exhausted I can't hardly think.
[2:22:23] Yes, you go in that house and shut the
[2:22:26] door. She was to pour it out herself.
[2:22:28] Not the prophet, not her children, not
[2:22:30] any of the sons of the prophet, not her
[2:22:32] neighbors. It was her legacy. This was
[2:22:35] her legacy. She was leaving it behind to
[2:22:39] to remove the stench of her
[2:22:42] death. And now she's sacrificing that.
[2:22:45] It's like desert
[2:22:48] Pete investing the water you find
[2:22:52] believing that it'll prime the leathers
[2:22:54] in the pump
[2:22:56] and you'll there'll be more. That's what
[2:22:58] God does. He's a God of divine
[2:23:00] mathematics. Do you believe it? Remember
[2:23:02] the jar was a special container
[2:23:04] specifically filled with anointing oil.
[2:23:06] God's instruction through Elijah is to
[2:23:08] place the anointing oil, the legacy of
[2:23:10] the household into regular ordinary
[2:23:12] vessels borrowed from the members of the
[2:23:15] community. The underlying Hebrew makes
[2:23:17] it clear that the vessels into which the
[2:23:20] oil was to be poured out were ordinary
[2:23:22] vessels. Just ordinary vessels. Anything
[2:23:25] that could hold oil, a bowl, a cup, a
[2:23:28] flask, whatever you can get, go get it.
[2:23:31] Doesn't matter if it's a pint or a quart
[2:23:33] or a half pint or whether it's a big
[2:23:35] bottle that will hold a hen, whatever.
[2:23:38] Go get them. The bottom line is, do you
[2:23:41] want to save your children or not? If
[2:23:43] we're going to save our children, we've
[2:23:44] got to follow the divine strategy. Amen.
[2:23:47] In fact, the text reveals that when we
[2:23:49] follow God's plan, God does more than we
[2:23:51] even ask for. He does exceedingly. He
[2:23:53] does abundantly above all that we could
[2:23:57] ask or think. She followed divine
[2:24:01] strategy without
[2:24:04] question. I want us to look at this as
[2:24:06] we bring this toward a
[2:24:08] close. The mother had to put her finger
[2:24:11] on the stash. Where is it? What have you
[2:24:14] got? And then she had to follow the
[2:24:16] divine strategy. So she left him. She
[2:24:19] shut the door behind her and her
[2:24:21] children, shutting out all distractions
[2:24:23] while she focused on her obedience. I
[2:24:25] want to tell you something. There is a
[2:24:26] time that you've got to shut the door.
[2:24:29] All right.
[2:24:32] Don't call it me time. Call it God time.
[2:24:35] I got to have some God time.
[2:24:38] Then no one can consider that selfish.
[2:24:41] Got to have God time. There would be no
[2:24:43] unnecessary confusion in the mind of her
[2:24:45] neighbors. She's just closing the door
[2:24:47] so nobody can even see what's going on.
[2:24:49] They kept bringing vessels to her.
[2:24:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And she kept
[2:24:53] pouring without intermission
[2:24:55] from this tiny little boat. Filling,
[2:24:57] filling, filling. She was sacrificing
[2:24:59] the way she wanted to handle the oil to
[2:25:01] follow a higher order. One commentator
[2:25:04] wrote, "They saw not the spring that it
[2:25:06] supplied." Excuse me. One commentator
[2:25:09] wrote, "They saw not the spring that
[2:25:11] supplied it, but believed it to be in
[2:25:13] him in whom all our springs are." It was
[2:25:17] supernatural.
[2:25:18] Can't you see them in the kitchen?
[2:25:20] Mama's got a small jar of precious oil
[2:25:22] in her hand. And each child takes a turn
[2:25:24] bringing an empty vessel to her and
[2:25:26] watching her pour precious oil from the
[2:25:27] jar into the vessel. No matter how big,
[2:25:30] how small the vessel, there's enough oil
[2:25:32] flowing from the jar to fill it. No
[2:25:34] matter how many vessels they bring, the
[2:25:37] oil of their legacy. Hallelujah. Yes.
[2:25:41] No matter how many children they have,
[2:25:44] no matter how many church children they
[2:25:46] help raise, come on.
[2:25:50] God keeps supplying the oil that they
[2:25:52] need as long as they continue to pour
[2:25:55] out.
[2:25:58] I don't know about you, but I remember
[2:25:59] some lessons that I learned in the
[2:26:01] kitchen with my
[2:26:03] mother, with my
[2:26:06] grandmother, sitting there while they
[2:26:13] worked. I want you to watch this. The
[2:26:15] children participated in their own
[2:26:17] deliverance.
[2:26:19] Because mama taught
[2:26:21] them how to work with their
[2:26:25] legacy. She filled the empty vessels
[2:26:27] with oil. She schooled her children
[2:26:29] about their legacy. She talked to them
[2:26:31] them about the God who promised to
[2:26:33] supply every need. She told them about
[2:26:35] the righteousness of her father, of
[2:26:37] their father. She told them why they
[2:26:40] were in this situation. Because he
[2:26:42] valued truth and he valued prophetic
[2:26:44] voices and he valued having prophets in
[2:26:47] the land to give the word of the Lord.
[2:26:49] And he was willing to risk his own
[2:26:53] death to hide them and to borrow money
[2:26:57] so that he could feed them. And now God,
[2:27:02] she's just a pouring. She's telling
[2:27:04] these stories while she's pouring. And
[2:27:07] now God is supernaturally giving her
[2:27:09] more than she
[2:27:12] owes. Yes, Lord.
[2:27:15] Yes,
[2:27:16] Lord. The text doesn't tell us how many
[2:27:18] vessels were filled up. We know that mom
[2:27:21] had followed the prophet's instructions
[2:27:22] and gathered a bunch. The text says the
[2:27:26] children kept bringing vessels to her
[2:27:27] and she kept pouring right up until the
[2:27:30] last vessel was filled and the oil
[2:27:32] stopped flowing. The translation says it
[2:27:36] stood. All the vessels are filled. The
[2:27:39] oil has stopped flowing. And she says,
[2:27:41] "Bring me yet a vessel." And had there
[2:27:44] been more vessels.
[2:27:47] Go ahead, say
[2:27:49] it. Had there been more
[2:27:52] vessels, the oil would have kept
[2:27:56] flowing. It would have kept flowing and
[2:27:58] kept flowing and kept flowing and kept
[2:28:00] flowing. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
[2:28:03] get them up to the sixth grade and then
[2:28:04] they're on their own? Wouldn't it be
[2:28:06] wonderful if we get them up to 18 and
[2:28:07] then they're on their own? No, no, no,
[2:28:09] no.
[2:28:10] It seems that a mother's work, a
[2:28:12] father's work is never done. We just
[2:28:13] keep pouring. It's our job. It's our
[2:28:16] job. It's our responsibility, but it's
[2:28:18] also our joy.
[2:28:22] What kind of a father would want his
[2:28:24] child not to to succeed and not to go
[2:28:26] higher? I pray, oh God, that the
[2:28:29] generation that's represented in this
[2:28:31] house today, I pray they'll go higher.
[2:28:35] I pray their understanding will be
[2:28:37] greater. I pray their authority will be
[2:28:40] higher and their power will be of
[2:28:42] greater demonstration.
[2:28:44] Amen. I pray Lord that the day will come
[2:28:47] that we mammas and daddies will be able
[2:28:49] to sit back and pray their strength and
[2:28:52] pray their obedience and pray that they
[2:28:54] will continue on to do what God has
[2:28:57] called them to do. Listen, you're
[2:28:59] leaving a legacy.
[2:29:04] Every person, man, woman, boy, girl,
[2:29:08] dad, mom, you're leaving a legacy
[2:29:10] whether you want to or not. You're
[2:29:13] leaving something behind.
[2:29:16] You're leaving a testimony behind. Is it
[2:29:19] going to be of up one minute and down
[2:29:21] the next or is it going to be a
[2:29:24] testimony that says, "I just put my
[2:29:26] shoulder to the plow, got my eyes on
[2:29:29] Jesus. I pressed on. I pressed on. I
[2:29:33] pressed on. I pressed on. I poured out.
[2:29:38] And then I poured out. And then I poured
[2:29:40] out until there were no other empty
[2:29:50] vessels. The limit of the supply was the
[2:29:54] limit of their capacity to
[2:29:58] receive. Elisha tells her, "Now go sell
[2:30:01] the oil. Pay your debts and you and your
[2:30:03] children are free. Your sons don't have
[2:30:06] to be slaves. Live on the rest. That's
[2:30:10] good news, y'all.
[2:30:14] Before we shout over the fact that her
[2:30:16] children were saved and all of their
[2:30:18] future secured, let me ask you a
[2:30:20] question. Whom did the mother sell the
[2:30:22] vessels
[2:30:29] to? Two principles help bring us to this
[2:30:33] answer. If you borrow a
[2:30:36] vessel, you're going to have to return
[2:30:38] it. This is in 2025
[2:30:44] borrow. You're not using that. I can I
[2:30:46] borrow Can I take that off your hand? We
[2:30:49] think that means I'll return it when I'm
[2:30:51] done until we go visit and we see it
[2:30:54] laid out in their yard.
[2:31:06] She was a woman of integrity.
[2:31:09] And so these vessels of oil were offered
[2:31:11] right back to the ones that had donated
[2:31:12] them first. I'm bringing your empty
[2:31:15] vessel back. It's full of oil now. Can
[2:31:17] you pay for the oil? They were glad to
[2:31:19] pay for
[2:31:20] it. If there were not enough people,
[2:31:23] then there would be enough money made in
[2:31:25] the end that she would be able to pay
[2:31:27] for any other vessel that she borrowed
[2:31:29] and go to the market with this oil.
[2:31:32] Because it's a common fact that in
[2:31:34] biblical times, many people would bring
[2:31:36] their own
[2:31:38] vessels to be filled with oil, to be
[2:31:40] filled with water, to be filled with
[2:31:42] wine, to be filled with grapes, to be
[2:31:43] filled with flour, whatever was needed.
[2:31:46] They bring their own sacks, so to speak.
[2:31:47] Except there were no sacks. So don't
[2:31:50] worry about where it went. When it was
[2:31:53] sold, there was enough to pay the
[2:31:57] debt. But I believe that a lot of those
[2:31:59] neighbors were blessed.
[2:32:01] I believe they got good deals.
[2:32:07] And furthermore, who wouldn't want to
[2:32:09] buy a big pot of supernatural oil?
[2:32:14] This is not Reverend Ike's miracle oil.
[2:32:17] This is real miracle oil. This isn't
[2:32:20] Ernest Angley style. This is real style.
[2:32:24] This is God
[2:32:26] supernaturally supplying a need. Amen.
[2:32:30] I'm coming to a
[2:32:38] close. Mama didn't think she had any
[2:32:42] answers. She thought that her children
[2:32:44] were
[2:32:45] lost to serve a life of an indentured
[2:32:48] slave. In reality, mama had everything
[2:32:51] her children
[2:32:53] needed tucked in here.
[2:32:59] just a little
[2:33:01] bottle of oil. Mama had everything they
[2:33:06] needed. She had faith to call on the
[2:33:10] Lord through the prophet of the
[2:33:13] hour. She had faith enough to obey the
[2:33:17] instruction.
[2:33:20] She had faith enough to turn
[2:33:22] loose of the little bit of oil that she
[2:33:25] needed to stay the stench for her own
[2:33:30] funeral. And that was all she needed for
[2:33:33] her sons to be saved, for her life to be
[2:33:37] preserved, and for her neighbors to be
[2:33:41] blessed. Mama, you better hold on to
[2:33:44] your oil.
[2:33:46] You better make sure that every time you
[2:33:48] can, you get under the
[2:33:50] spout where the glory runs out.
[2:33:54] When it's time to worship, you better
[2:33:56] make sure, wives, that you have pushed.
[2:33:58] If it's only for for three minutes of a
[2:34:01] worship service, somebody said, you
[2:34:02] know, mama, they don't they don't get a
[2:34:05] whole sermon, they don't get a whole
[2:34:06] worship
[2:34:07] service. Let me tell you, God can do
[2:34:09] more for you in three minutes.
[2:34:14] He can do more for you in three minutes
[2:34:16] when you get in his
[2:34:18] presence. Somebody said, "Can't he help
[2:34:20] me at home?" He can, but I tell you, he
[2:34:22] wants you to come and get a dose of that
[2:34:25] corporate anointing.
[2:34:27] He wants you to come and and be blessed
[2:34:29] by your other brothers and sisters. And
[2:34:31] you may feel overwhelmed, and you may
[2:34:32] feel like you're the only mama that's
[2:34:34] running low, but you're not the only
[2:34:36] one. These mothers deal with this. These
[2:34:39] wives deal with this on a regular basis.
[2:34:41] I'm sure they do.
[2:34:43] Sometimes your children have different
[2:34:45] names than
[2:34:50] you. Sometimes God sends neighbor
[2:34:53] youngans to your
[2:34:56] house. Sometimes he sends
[2:35:00] sisters from the church to your
[2:35:03] house, brothers. Sometimes he sends
[2:35:05] other families. Sometimes neighbors come
[2:35:08] to get some of what you got.
[2:35:12] These are spiritual mothers. These are
[2:35:15] spiritual
[2:35:18] porers. Their
[2:35:21] value, it's
[2:35:25] priceless. What you do for your own
[2:35:28] children is valuable. It's vital. It's
[2:35:31] holy. And it's worthy of praise.
[2:35:35] But what you do for somebody else's
[2:35:38] child, what you do for somebody else's
[2:35:43] family, what you do to help somebody
[2:35:46] else have a brighter day, that's
[2:35:50] priceless. Any good mama is going to
[2:35:52] provide for her own children's mental,
[2:35:55] emotional, and physical needs.
[2:35:58] But when you're willing to take on the
[2:35:59] community, when you're willing to take
[2:36:01] on somebody else's little
[2:36:12] brat, somebody have to help my wife
[2:36:15] carry her
[2:36:17] crowns cuz she gets a big one for taking
[2:36:20] care of
[2:36:21] me and our four strong children.
[2:36:26] But she seems to
[2:36:28] collect other
[2:36:30] kids just
[2:36:38] pouring. We go to
[2:36:42] Sam's. Got to get the
[2:36:46] freezies. I said, "Our kids are grown,
[2:36:50] honey. Elelliana don't need them yet.
[2:36:54] You know, we got to have them. Warm
[2:36:56] weather's coming. Got to have them. Got
[2:36:58] to have them. Got to have
[2:37:01] this. What you do, every
[2:37:06] teacher who goes over there to that
[2:37:08] school and pours into somebody else's
[2:37:13] child, someone I love and know recently
[2:37:16] was in a room of 5-year-olds.
[2:37:23] What is your name? Well, I've already
[2:37:25] told you my name. My name is Mrs.
[2:37:26] Shelly. Oh, you mean Mrs.
[2:37:29] Smelly? You mean Mrs.
[2:37:32] Belly? What if I just call you Mrs.
[2:37:35] Belly? 5 years
[2:37:39] old. You know what I'd want to say? What
[2:37:41] if I just called you breathless?
[2:37:48] There's going to be a smell in here real
[2:37:50] quick and it's going to be when I knock
[2:37:52] the poop out of
[2:37:55] you, but then the then the sirens go
[2:37:59] blast and another teacher goes off to
[2:38:02] jail. I said, "You mean to tell me
[2:38:05] kindergarten, five years old? five years
[2:38:09] old, determined to run the class and
[2:38:13] rule the day. And the little neighbor
[2:38:16] teacher comes in and says, "Now, don't
[2:38:18] you all treat this sub like you did the
[2:38:20] last
[2:38:21] sub, leaving the indication that she
[2:38:24] probably ended her day in a meltdown of
[2:38:26] tears." Five-year-olds, come on. Every
[2:38:30] time you have done such a thing as that,
[2:38:33] every time you've loaded up those
[2:38:35] hoodlams on your bus,
[2:38:38] Mimi, Charity, and
[2:38:41] others, you've greeted them with a
[2:38:45] smile, with
[2:38:48] kindness, ran into them at Walmart and
[2:38:51] spoke to them, and they spoke to
[2:38:54] you. You're pouring
[2:39:01] You're
[2:39:02] pouring. You go down to Walmart, you're
[2:39:07] pouring. They don't always Your
[2:39:10] children don't always have your
[2:39:13] name. But if you're willing to pour, God
[2:39:16] will send them.
[2:39:18] He'll send them. Sometimes I have to
[2:39:21] pour to pastors older than I am
[2:39:27] who won't publicly even give me a thumbs
[2:39:32] up on Facebook.
[2:39:36] They won't even greet me with a happy
[2:39:38] birthday on
[2:39:39] Facebook, but will do it
[2:39:44] privately because they don't want
[2:39:46] anybody to know that they even know who
[2:39:49] I am. Won't even give me a thumbs up,
[2:39:52] but they'll reach out older than me. I
[2:39:55] just need some inc. I just need some
[2:39:58] encouragement. Basically, even if it
[2:40:01] comes from you,
[2:40:05] I'm willing. You understand? Amen. My
[2:40:08] children older than me sometime, they
[2:40:10] don't all have my name. Mamas, get it.
[2:40:14] Hear what I'm saying? Teenagers
[2:40:17] here, you got children. You're not old
[2:40:20] enough to have any children. And yet,
[2:40:21] God sends you somebody
[2:40:27] to pour out to.
[2:40:30] your spiritual mothers to
[2:40:34] neighbors. Ants who provide safe havens,
[2:40:38] listening
[2:40:40] ears. Spiritual mentors who pour wisdom
[2:40:43] into younger
[2:40:48] women. Gay-haired, wispyhaired
[2:40:53] women who say, "Do you know what the
[2:40:57] Lord did on June the 11th of
[2:41:06] You ought to have been there when the
[2:41:08] Lord did blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2:41:12] blah. Poor
[2:41:15] poor. Some you'll pour and it'll run
[2:41:19] right out. It'll do them no good in the
[2:41:20] long run. But you'll find some to pour
[2:41:24] into that will remain, that will remain,
[2:41:28] that will grow, that will be steady,
[2:41:30] that will be rock solid, who will pour
[2:41:32] to their own children, to their own
[2:41:34] neighbors.
[2:41:36] It's
[2:41:37] multiplication. This oil multiplied
[2:41:40] according to the number of
[2:41:43] vessels, not according to biological
[2:41:45] connections.
[2:41:51] There was a ginger who poured. There was
[2:41:53] an April who poured. There'll always be
[2:42:00] somebody. There are connections stronger
[2:42:02] than biology. There are assignments.
[2:42:05] There are
[2:42:09] assignments. Teachers get them sometime.
[2:42:11] Like I said a moment ago, bus drivers
[2:42:13] get them sometime. foster
[2:42:16] mothers who open their homes again and
[2:42:19] again and again. It's not the
[2:42:21] connection. It's not the
[2:42:23] biology. It's the faith.
[2:42:26] God doesn't measure motherhood by
[2:42:29] wombs. He measures motherhood by your
[2:42:33] willingness to pour into somebody else
[2:42:36] who's empty.
[2:42:40] It's oil of legacy. It's been there,
[2:42:43] done that, walked through that, whipped
[2:42:45] that devil, overcome that battle. Now I
[2:42:48] can give you a little courage to go do
[2:42:50] it for yourself.
[2:42:53] I'm closing.
[2:42:58] Musicians. Seven quick
[2:43:01] lessons to learn from the widow woman.
[2:43:03] Number one, when you're in trouble, seek
[2:43:06] godly wisdom to gain new perspective.
[2:43:10] She went to the
[2:43:12] prophet. Number two, use what you
[2:43:15] have to get what you need. That's how
[2:43:19] faith operates.
[2:43:21] What's that in your hand,
[2:43:23] Moses? Happened to be a rod. If it would
[2:43:27] have been his
[2:43:29] flipflop, God would have said, "Good.
[2:43:32] I'm going to use a flip-flop to lead my
[2:43:34] children out of Egypt."
[2:43:38] It wasn't that he just happened to have
[2:43:39] the right thing in his hand. God
[2:43:41] literally said, "What is in your hand?"
[2:43:43] That's what I'm going to use. Mama,
[2:43:46] what's in your house? Just a
[2:43:52] little. Number three, sew where you want
[2:43:54] to
[2:43:57] go. This woman set that example. This
[2:44:00] widow woman only had a small jar of
[2:44:02] precious oil, yet she was willing to
[2:44:04] invest all of it
[2:44:07] before she saw the
[2:44:09] miracle. Don't be tempted to hold on to
[2:44:11] something because you can't see where
[2:44:13] the next supply will come from. God's
[2:44:16] math is different and he will multiply
[2:44:19] your seed if you will trust him.
[2:44:23] Number four, the poor widow woman became
[2:44:25] a distribution channel for the kingdom
[2:44:27] of God with just one little small jar of
[2:44:29] oil. I don't have anything. I'm so
[2:44:31] empty. No, no, no, no, no,
[2:44:34] no. Take what you've got. Take what
[2:44:37] little you've got
[2:44:39] left. Sometimes you've got to be mama,
[2:44:41] daddy. Sometime you've got to be aunt,
[2:44:43] uncle, grandma, grandpa. Sometime you
[2:44:45] got to be all of it.
[2:44:48] God's not going to leave you helpless or
[2:44:50] hopeless. Number number five, she did
[2:44:53] not depend on just her own supply. Don't
[2:44:55] be afraid to ask God for help. Don't be
[2:44:58] afraid to ask somebody else for help.
[2:44:59] I'm weak. My faith is a little
[2:45:01] shattered. I'm a little emotional. I
[2:45:03] need a little help.
[2:45:04] Ask. You have not because you asked not.
[2:45:08] Somebody said, "I just don't want to
[2:45:10] ask." Kick that pride. Kick it. Why
[2:45:13] don't you kick that pride right out the
[2:45:16] door and say, "Help me.
[2:45:24] Number six, she was quickly able to sell
[2:45:26] her product because she was providing
[2:45:29] something that everyone needed. You've
[2:45:31] got something. You've got something.
[2:45:33] You've got a
[2:45:34] testimony that somebody needs to hear.
[2:45:38] Hello. Number seven. Even in the midst
[2:45:41] of her own problem, she was a solution.
[2:45:45] God used God gave her supernatural
[2:45:48] abundance, resources, and provision
[2:45:51] because she
[2:45:52] obeyed
[2:45:54] his
[2:45:57] word. Here was a woman getting ready to
[2:46:00] lay down and die with her son sold into
[2:46:02] slavery. And with a miracle, she became
[2:46:05] the entrepreneur to bless the whole
[2:46:07] community around her. She used what she
[2:46:10] had despite how weak she was, how scared
[2:46:12] she felt. And the Lord turned her
[2:46:14] biggest misery into her greatest
[2:46:16] miracle. And he'll do the same for
[2:46:19] you. One more
[2:46:23] point. Sometimes your own
[2:46:27] jar is
[2:46:33] cracked. The jar that you were
[2:46:37] handed was cracked.
[2:46:40] There are
[2:46:42] times when we
[2:46:44] realize that our
[2:46:47] mother was
[2:46:50] broken. She wasn't
[2:46:55] whole. She gave what she
[2:46:58] had. She gave us
[2:47:01] life. She was
[2:47:04] cracked. The vessel she handed us was
[2:47:07] cracked.
[2:47:10] God had to help
[2:47:11] us. There are some of you
[2:47:14] here who
[2:47:18] understand. Some get warm and
[2:47:21] fuzzies at Mother's
[2:47:24] Day and some grieve what never was.
[2:47:33] Maybe your mother was like the brother's
[2:47:36] mother who had to stop and calm
[2:47:39] herself to get from the cabinet to the
[2:47:43] stove to cook the ters for the
[2:47:51] family. You dread the thought of
[2:47:54] Mother's
[2:47:56] Day because of it, Father's Day because
[2:47:59] of it. because you were handed a broken
[2:48:04] pot. We don't have any idea what that
[2:48:06] little pot looked like, but it might
[2:48:08] have been a little chipped. It might
[2:48:09] have been through some stuff. There
[2:48:10] might have been a crack. Might have been
[2:48:12] imperfect. All we know is that it was
[2:48:14] enough to hold enough. It was enough to
[2:48:16] hold
[2:48:18] enough for a miracle to take place. I
[2:48:21] promise you that your situation might
[2:48:23] not have been like mine. Mine might not
[2:48:24] have been like yours. But I promise you,
[2:48:26] as a born again, Holy Ghostfilled
[2:48:28] believer, you've got enough in your pot.
[2:48:31] It might be crack. What was handed to
[2:48:33] you might not been the same as what was
[2:48:36] handed to somebody else. But as a born
[2:48:38] again believer, you've got enough,
[2:48:40] sister. You've got enough, mama. You've
[2:48:43] got enough in you
[2:48:46] to pour out to somebody else.
[2:48:49] Don't grieve away what could have been,
[2:48:52] what should have been. Don't ever let it
[2:48:55] become your excuse. Just pour.
[2:49:05] There was a time that my mother didn't
[2:49:08] support my ministry.
[2:49:12] Instead, she locked me out of the house
[2:49:14] at
[2:49:16] night when I would go and preach the
[2:49:20] gospel and someone would take me and
[2:49:23] drop me
[2:49:24] off. And if it was later than she told
[2:49:26] me to be home, mind you, I wasn't
[2:49:29] drinking. I wasn't drugging. I wasn't
[2:49:31] running around. I was coming home from a
[2:49:34] revival that I had preached.
[2:49:39] My mother was bitter from her own
[2:49:41] heartache, her own
[2:49:44] heartbreak, and her word was the law.
[2:49:46] And it didn't matter if God was
[2:49:49] moving. He better do it within the time
[2:49:52] frame that my mama had given me as a boy
[2:49:55] in
[2:49:57] school. So there were multiple times
[2:50:00] that I came home later than the hour and
[2:50:04] found the door locked. Oh, I
[2:50:07] knocked, but it didn't do any
[2:50:11] good. I made up my mind. I can get mad.
[2:50:15] I can get bitter. I can get filled with
[2:50:17] hate. I can take this religious
[2:50:20] righteous stuff and say, "Oh, I'm doing
[2:50:22] the work of the
[2:50:24] Lord." But I decided to spend the rest
[2:50:27] of the time sitting against the door
[2:50:30] praying for my mama's salvation.
[2:50:35] Lord, she's laying there in that bed.
[2:50:37] She's not
[2:50:39] asleep. She's
[2:50:41] miserable. She's
[2:50:43] angry. She's
[2:50:45] hurting. She's
[2:50:48] mad. She's not getting any more sleep
[2:50:50] than I
[2:50:51] am. I'm suffering on the outside, she's
[2:50:54] suffering on the inside. I want you to
[2:50:57] save her soul.
[2:51:00] I want you to show up in her
[2:51:03] life and show her what love
[2:51:06] is and what it means to be
[2:51:09] unconditionally loved and
[2:51:11] accepted with your
[2:51:17] brokenness. When she would leave to go
[2:51:20] to the bank the next morning, she would
[2:51:21] unlock the door. I would get up. I had
[2:51:24] dozed off usually by
[2:51:26] then. I would wake up. I would get up
[2:51:30] and when I could, I would throw my arms
[2:51:32] around my
[2:51:34] mother and I would say, "One of these
[2:51:38] days, God is going to break the hold in
[2:51:41] your
[2:51:42] life. And I'm going to see you with your
[2:51:44] hands lifted up and tears running down
[2:51:47] your face as you give God
[2:51:50] praise for rescuing you."
[2:51:56] I don't know how many nights there were
[2:51:58] like that, but there were more than
[2:52:03] 30. And it was years before God heard
[2:52:06] those
[2:52:07] prayers. And during those times, it was
[2:52:10] a struggle
[2:52:11] sometime to keep the right
[2:52:14] heart and the right
[2:52:17] spirit and not to be bitter.
[2:52:21] I didn't tell you that for you to feel
[2:52:24] sorry for me. I told you that because
[2:52:27] there are many of us who have stories
[2:52:29] like that and you didn't know that
[2:52:31] woman. Praise
[2:52:34] God. You didn't know
[2:52:38] her by the time you met her. She was not
[2:52:41] perfect, but she was a different woman
[2:52:42] than that. And there are many of us who
[2:52:45] had stories. Sister Teresa, I remember a
[2:52:48] story you told me about your own mother
[2:52:50] that still touches me
[2:52:54] today. In the spur of a moment, she was
[2:52:57] willing to do whatever she had to do to
[2:52:59] protect her life and her
[2:53:01] children. Whatever it
[2:53:05] takes, not perfect
[2:53:09] pots, but worthy of honor.
[2:53:13] There are a lot of us who have those
[2:53:15] mother wounds and we have to give them
[2:53:16] to the Lord, don't we? There's a
[2:53:19] redemptive
[2:53:21] poor. When you're in touch with the
[2:53:26] redeemer, you say, "I didn't have that
[2:53:28] loving mother. I don't know how to be a
[2:53:31] loving mother." Then you just need to
[2:53:33] come under his pour.
[2:53:37] He'll pour redemption into you. He'll
[2:53:39] teach you how to give what you didn't
[2:53:41] have, what you didn't get. He'll give
[2:53:44] you something that was not provided for
[2:53:46] you in your life so that you can give it
[2:53:48] to others. We don't have to continue
[2:53:52] that perpetual, seemingly unending cycle
[2:53:56] of dysfunction.
[2:53:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:54:01] I know mothers in this church that
[2:54:04] weren't properly
[2:54:07] motherthered who are super
[2:54:09] moms. How did that happen? Because there
[2:54:12] is a redemptive poor.
[2:54:21] Your mother's day story does not limit
[2:54:25] your poor.
[2:54:27] Your issues from your growing up doesn't
[2:54:30] limit your poor. Just keep coming to
[2:54:33] him. Fill me. Fill me. The very pain
[2:54:38] that made you feel empty has produced
[2:54:41] mother, sister, wife, and oil in you
[2:54:46] that others desperately need.
[2:54:49] Your scars become your ministry.
[2:54:53] Your lack becomes your offering to
[2:54:57] others. Your healing becomes
[2:55:01] hope to somebody else.
[2:55:07] Let's
[2:55:18] stand. I tried to find the song book. I
[2:55:21] wanted to read you the
[2:55:25] lyrics. This is about
[2:55:27] right for
[2:55:31] time. But I didn't find it quick enough.
[2:55:36] But I used to
[2:55:38] travel with two
[2:55:42] granny's and
[2:55:44] we I was 12 and 13 and 14 and
[2:55:50] 15. They were much older. They sung
[2:55:54] harmony. We sung together. We made our
[2:55:58] own jokes so that nobody else had
[2:56:01] to. They'd say, "What do you call your
[2:56:04] group?" and and they'd speak up and
[2:56:06] they'd say the teenager and the old
[2:56:09] gravel
[2:56:12] gerties, but these were godly
[2:56:16] women. And uh the younger of the two had
[2:56:21] wasted her life in the
[2:56:24] bars, raised in a godly
[2:56:27] family, and she had made her money in
[2:56:30] the bars. And she married in the bars,
[2:56:33] and she raised her children in the
[2:56:36] bars. And the more her godly little
[2:56:38] mother prayed, her mother was about that
[2:56:40] tall.
[2:56:47] That's Rags's greatg
[2:56:51] grandmother.
[2:56:53] She would pray and the more she'd
[2:56:56] pray, the daughter would get wilder and
[2:56:59] meaner and further away from God.
[2:57:04] And one day she was playing in a
[2:57:08] bar, little mini skirt
[2:57:13] on, and she said,
[2:57:17] "Steve, it was just like God took the
[2:57:20] roof
[2:57:22] off, I wasn't thinking about the Lord. I
[2:57:25] was thinking about singing these folks
[2:57:28] drunk so they would put more tips in the
[2:57:31] jar.
[2:57:34] He opened up the roof of that old honky
[2:57:36] tonk and he poured my mama's tears down
[2:57:39] on my
[2:57:41] head and I said over the microphone,
[2:57:45] "Folks, I can't entertain you
[2:57:49] anymore. God's just heard my mama's
[2:57:53] prayers. I'm out of
[2:57:56] here." She said, "I didn't even stay
[2:57:59] around to get my check.
[2:58:01] I didn't even empty my tip
[2:58:06] jar. She said, "I won't ever be back.
[2:58:09] You'll never see me
[2:58:11] again. I'm going to sing for the Lord
[2:58:13] the rest of the days of my
[2:58:15] life." And she
[2:58:17] did. And she said, "But before I
[2:58:20] do, before I leave, I want to sing a
[2:58:24] song that I wrote for my mama that she
[2:58:26] hasn't heard yet.
[2:58:30] Is that all right? And the owner said,
[2:58:32] "Yes, go ahead and then hurry
[2:58:35] out." And she had written these words,
[2:58:39] "The blood of Jesus
[2:58:41] Christ mixed with mama's
[2:58:44] tears again has put old Satan on the
[2:58:49] run." Her joy was quite contagious and
[2:58:53] has
[2:58:54] withtood many years.
[2:58:57] And I'm telling everybody they need a
[2:58:59] little
[2:59:00] touch of the blood of Jesus Christ mixed
[2:59:04] with mama's
[2:59:05] tears. She said, "Steve, there wasn't a
[2:59:08] dry eye in that building." And she said,
[2:59:10] "I thought I might just give an
[2:59:12] invitation on my way out." And so she
[2:59:15] said, "I've got a feeling I'm not the
[2:59:16] only backslider that's tried to outrun
[2:59:19] Mama's tears in Jesus's blood." So she
[2:59:22] said, "It'd be all right if you'd call
[2:59:24] on him today. I know I
[2:59:27] am. And there were many in that bar. In
[2:59:31] fact, we had people come to revival
[2:59:33] years later, walked down the aisle and
[2:59:35] said, "I was in the bar the night that
[2:59:37] you
[2:59:38] quit." And I gave my heart to the Lord
[2:59:40] and I never went back. I asked God to
[2:59:43] give me one opportunity to see you and
[2:59:45] here you are in my
[2:59:47] church singing and preaching
[2:59:51] revival. Why you tell that? Well, I only
[2:59:54] tell it once a year
[3:00:00] usually because you may not keep them
[3:00:03] always,
[3:00:05] mother. They may run. They may run as
[3:00:08] hard and fast and as long as their leash
[3:00:11] will
[3:00:12] allow, but I want you to know God gets
[3:00:15] the last word.
[3:00:18] You keep pouring.
[3:00:22] You just keep
[3:00:24] pouring when you're the only one that
[3:00:26] pours. Keep
[3:00:28] pouring when you're the only one that
[3:00:30] remembers.
[3:00:32] Keep
[3:00:33] pouring. God sees
[3:00:36] it. He sees
[3:00:40] it. He sees it.
[3:00:43] I want to ask
[3:00:44] every mother, every woman of
[3:00:48] God to come and stand here today. We're
[3:00:51] going to pray over you in just a moment.
[3:00:54] We'll have our families, your family to
[3:00:56] come and join you. Come now. Would you
[3:00:59] come and stand here? I don't do this to
[3:01:01] embarrass you. I do
[3:01:03] this to bless you.
[3:01:12] Come in
[3:01:31] close. I'm going be real
[3:01:35] plain. If you're a family here and
[3:01:37] you've got a mother here
[3:01:39] that won't chop her hair off and paint
[3:01:43] her face and put all these crazy things
[3:01:46] through their ears and
[3:01:48] nose, but she'll live a godly
[3:01:51] life, testify of the blood of Jesus and
[3:01:54] the power of God's salvation. You're
[3:01:56] blessed.
[3:01:58] She may not be as cool as somebody
[3:02:00] else's mother or wife, but I'll tell you
[3:02:03] right now, her
[3:02:05] value, it cannot be
[3:02:10] named. I have sung the praises of
[3:02:13] mothers, but I want you to know that I
[3:02:15] know that mothers aren't always perfect
[3:02:17] because fathers are not always perfect
[3:02:19] and husbands are not always perfect and
[3:02:21] Christians are not always
[3:02:24] perfect. But we're blessed here. I want
[3:02:27] you to look around this room, not just
[3:02:29] at what God's given you, but I want you
[3:02:31] to see some of the rest of these. Let's
[3:02:33] have the families just squeeze in close.
[3:02:35] You can't touch your mama, your wife.
[3:02:37] Get where you can just push your way
[3:02:40] in. They need
[3:02:44] us. They don't just need us one day of
[3:02:47] the year. They need us
[3:02:49] 365 days of the year.
[3:02:55] They need our support and our prayers.
[3:02:57] And there are mothers here that don't
[3:02:58] have any of their biological children
[3:03:01] here like Sister Rebecca or Sister
[3:03:04] Beverly, maybe others. Uh get around
[3:03:06] them. Somebody make sure that you lay
[3:03:08] hands on them and remind them how loved
[3:03:12] and appreciated they are in this
[3:03:16] house. You've made some mighty nicel
[3:03:19] looking children, too.
[3:03:23] I don't know what they'd do without
[3:03:26] you. I'm so glad they don't have to
[3:03:29] think about
[3:03:36] it. I've seen you, Jia. I've seen you.
[3:03:39] Some of you others I've seen you. I I've
[3:03:41] watched
[3:03:44] you. I know you poor and poor and poor
[3:03:47] and poor.
[3:03:52] I understand what Johanna and Rachel
[3:03:58] uh
[3:04:01] Roa, they're
[3:04:04] pouring
[3:04:06] poor. Do
[3:04:09] it. You don't always have to know what
[3:04:11] to say. Just pour love. Poor Jesus.
[3:04:19] Pour a
[3:04:24] smile. It's not sympathy you need,
[3:04:28] sister. You need godly
[3:04:31] support. May we all provide
[3:04:38] that. There's such a presence, just a
[3:04:41] for me a very solemn presence here. I
[3:04:44] would like to think that God would
[3:04:46] launch some women today into a place of
[3:04:49] encouragement and a place of victory
[3:04:50] that they haven't been in in a long
[3:04:53] time. I'd like to think that there might
[3:04:56] be a mother that would just take her
[3:04:57] place back. I'm taking it back now. I'm
[3:05:00] taking my voice
[3:05:01] back and I'm going to speak into my
[3:05:04] children like I never have before. I'm
[3:05:06] not going to lecture them, but I'm going
[3:05:08] to teach
[3:05:09] them. Father, in the name of Jesus
[3:05:12] Christ,
[3:05:14] I I just want to honor these women of
[3:05:18] God, so many times beat down in so many
[3:05:23] ways in life and misjudged by the world
[3:05:27] around
[3:05:28] them. But I thank you that their
[3:05:30] dedication is to you,
[3:05:32] Lord. It's you that they love most
[3:05:35] foremost above all.
[3:05:39] I I know that it um bothers our family
[3:05:42] sometime, but the truth is they love you
[3:05:45] more than they love us. And that's what
[3:05:47] every husband should delight
[3:05:49] in to have a wife and a mother for their
[3:05:53] children that would love you above all.
[3:05:55] I pray, oh God, that you will touch
[3:05:58] these
[3:05:59] women, not just biological mothers, but
[3:06:03] women of
[3:06:06] God. Those who have children that don't
[3:06:09] share their name, and those who were
[3:06:11] handed a broken vessel, and yet they
[3:06:14] pour anyway and give anyway. uh every
[3:06:19] sister around this altar, I pray for the
[3:06:23] strength of almighty
[3:06:28] God. We don't always know what to say or
[3:06:31] what to do for them or even tell them
