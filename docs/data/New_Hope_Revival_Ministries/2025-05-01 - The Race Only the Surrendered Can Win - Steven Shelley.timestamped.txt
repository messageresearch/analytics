[0:00] and and we may not know how valuable the
[0:03] favor and the honor of the Lord is, but
[0:07] it's it's almost everything to us
[0:10] because if he takes his hand off and we
[0:13] don't see his favor anymore and we don't
[0:15] sense his honor anymore, we're doing it
[0:18] by oursel. And how many of you know you
[0:20] just can't run this kind of race by
[0:22] yourself?
[0:24] Without the Lord, you're not going to
[0:26] get very far. And that's why so many are
[0:28] sliding backward. It's because they've
[0:31] lost the honor and the favor of the Lord
[0:34] on their life. And they still come to
[0:36] church or go to church and they still
[0:38] raise their hands and they still sing.
[0:41] Some of them still preach. Uh they do
[0:44] all the things that church people do,
[0:47] but they no longer have the favor and
[0:50] they no longer have the honor of the
[0:53] Lord. And something caused that. God
[0:56] doesn't just take it off of you because
[0:58] you made one little
[1:00] mistake. They have allowed their lives
[1:03] to fall into cruise control. They still
[1:06] go through the motion, but their their
[1:09] uh feet are off the the pedals and
[1:12] sometimes their hands are off the wheel
[1:14] and they're just barely getting by. And
[1:18] the the Lord can't honor that kind of a
[1:21] life. It's an upright life. It's a
[1:23] righteous life. It's a holy life that he
[1:26] will honor. It's an obedient life. He's
[1:30] not uh demanding that you in your flesh
[1:34] should be perfect, but he is demanding
[1:37] that you and I in our flesh should be
[1:40] faithful. We can't be perfect in the
[1:43] flesh. We can't yet even be perfect in
[1:47] the realm of soul, mind, will, and
[1:50] emotion. There's still a battle going on
[1:53] in that part of who we are. And but we
[1:56] can perfectly make up our mind to be
[2:00] faithful, to be dedicated to stay with
[2:03] him, to hold on to him, to run the race
[2:06] that is set before us. No matter how
[2:09] difficult it gets, we must endure. God
[2:13] is saying, "If you honor me, I will
[2:16] honor you." Don't you think that you
[2:20] will inherit anything because of who you
[2:23] are or who you're related to or where
[2:26] you go to church.
[2:29] The rapture is not a church-based
[2:31] rapture. It's not a geographical
[2:35] locationbased rapture. There going to be
[2:37] those in every church where the truth is
[2:40] preached that will leave this world in a
[2:43] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:46] because that's the culmination of the
[2:48] rapture that is already in progress now.
[2:51] It's a process first and then it's a
[2:54] moment where we are changed. Hallelujah.
[2:57] The dead in Christ changed.
[3:01] We changed and together we gather and we
[3:06] meet the Lord together in the air. As we
[3:10] get closer to this
[3:13] translation, you can expect that God is
[3:16] looking for righteousness
[3:18] on higher levels, committedness,
[3:22] dedication,
[3:23] sanctification, consecration, obedience,
[3:28] on higher
[3:29] levels than have ever been expected
[3:32] before. We're coming to an hour where if
[3:35] we're going to have a personal
[3:37] individual relationship with God, we're
[3:40] going to have to pursue it on our own.
[3:42] We're no longer going to be able to
[3:43] blame somebody in our house, somebody in
[3:45] our family, somebody in our pull pit.
[3:49] That's keeping us at bay.
[3:52] I want you to know we're going to have
[3:53] to run after him. This message is
[3:55] running with all for Jesus, loving him
[3:57] to the finish line. Let me tell you what
[4:00] it takes to do that. It takes full
[4:01] throttle faith. You've got to pull that
[4:04] thing
[4:05] [Music]
[4:07] back. You've got to let the gear drop
[4:10] down, and you've got to let that thing
[4:13] roll.
[4:15] It takes heartpounding devotion,
[4:18] uncompromising pursuit, an allout
[4:21] surrender, a sacred determination, a
[4:24] relentless passion, a holy
[4:27] endurance, a wholehearted commitment,
[4:30] and a breathless devotion or you'll lose
[4:34] the anointing of God on your life. I'm
[4:37] telling you, hear me now.
[4:41] You'll lose the anointing on your life.
[4:45] The rapture isn't for those who love the
[4:49] Lord. Wink
[4:51] wink, but it's for those who have laid
[4:55] it all down.
[4:59] [Music]
[5:00] And realize that he only honors those
[5:03] who honor him.
[5:06] He only favors those who favor him. He
[5:10] only pours out his abundant blessings on
[5:13] those who serve him with abundant
[5:16] passion, full throttle
[5:18] faith, holy endurance.
