[41:34] amen as the sun goes down this evening
[41:37] we once again remember the time of
[41:41] Sukkot The Time Of Tabernacles it's one
[41:46] of the feasts that the Bible says will
[41:49] be perpetually celebrated before the
[41:52] Lord
[41:53] that means when you stand with him in
[41:55] the New Kingdom you will still remember
[41:58] the time of in gathering
[42:00] you will still celebrate it is the Feast
[42:03] of rest it is the Feast of Joy it is the
[42:07] Feast of the open book
[42:10] we have a lot to be thankful for how
[42:13] many of you are glad the book is open
[42:16] the seals are loosed and we have a
[42:19] revelation the revelation of Jesus
[42:22] Christ
[42:23] and so we look forward to it the prophet
[42:26] told us that it types a great Millennial
[42:29] Reign where we dwell with him and we
[42:34] look forward to that but we look forward
[42:36] to the days and months ahead as we
[42:39] prepare to receive our King amen he's
[42:42] doing great things I want to say it
[42:46] again see if you'll help me he's doing
[42:48] great
[42:52] oh my what a wonderful weakness has been
[42:56] and I am very much aware that many of
[43:00] you are fighting symptoms and sickness
[43:02] in your body my wife is unable to
[43:05] swallow hardly just just barely swallow
[43:08] this morning and uh Joshua as well and
[43:13] we just know like you know when you get
[43:16] attacked we know that the enemy's mad
[43:20] you know and and in some ways it makes
[43:24] us glad when the enemy's mad
[43:28] it's like my old granny said and I
[43:30] mentioned to someone in my office this
[43:31] week granny used to say well if uh if
[43:35] the devil's after you that's a good
[43:37] thing
[43:39] it means he hadn't got you
[43:42] if he leaves you alone if the devil
[43:44] leaves you alone you better worry
[43:46] that means he's running you around
[43:50] that means he's got the reins that means
[43:53] you've given him a saddle to ride your
[43:55] back how many of you want to remove all
[43:58] saddles
[43:59] so that the enemy has no place to ride
[44:02] you want to be rather the horse that the
[44:05] king rides in on we want to bring the
[44:08] king in amen so officially according to
[44:12] the calendar camp meeting starts Tuesday
[44:14] night but how many of you feel like it's
[44:17] starting this morning
[44:18] we're just claiming that we're here
[44:21] we have come to the season of our joy
[44:24] and we believe that God is going to move
[44:27] I want to begin this morning and get
[44:30] this out of the way because I want to
[44:32] say to you from the bottom of my heart
[44:34] how incredibly sorry I am for those of
[44:37] you who were here Wednesday night
[44:39] helping us and who received chemical
[44:42] burns on your knees I want to tell you
[44:45] that I am so sorry and I have carried it
[44:48] very heavy this week and I have felt
[44:52] like I wasn't a very good leader because
[44:54] if I was then maybe I would have
[44:56] realized but I didn't realize and
[44:59] neither did those who were gathered
[45:01] around that night to help and I want to
[45:03] tell you from the bottom of my heart I
[45:05] would have never had you to have those
[45:08] sores or burns on your knees and some
[45:12] were really bad some who already had
[45:15] allergies to those kinds of chemicals
[45:17] and cleaning
[45:19] um really bad and Ariel ended up at the
[45:21] Amer emergency room and I'm so very
[45:25] sorry honey I want you to know that from
[45:27] the bottom of my heart it really really
[45:29] hurt me that you all were here
[45:31] doing something for the Lord and you got
[45:34] injured doing it and that's why when we
[45:37] went to put the tent up yesterday I just
[45:39] prayed Lord make let there be no harm
[45:42] done let there be no emergencies let
[45:45] there be no accidents but let everything
[45:48] be done all of that being said
[45:51] I don't know how to thank you enough
[45:53] because that 30 if it was built in 85 I
[45:58] confirmed that if it was built in 85
[45:59] that makes it what 30 37 year old tent
[46:04] I had that tent built 37 years ago and
[46:08] finally the the man who built it for me
[46:11] texted me last night answered my inbox
[46:14] and he said anything that you can use to
[46:17] stick it together with that'll that
[46:19] ought to work
[46:21] he's almost 90.
[46:24] he said just stick it I said we got it
[46:27] handled
[46:28] Luke wise on the job
[46:31] and uh he was I don't know brother
[46:34] Greeley will talk about that when it's
[46:36] his turn but uh the patching and the
[46:39] cleaning you you folks made a 37 year
[46:41] old tent look brand new I almost smacked
[46:44] a little kid that come up under there
[46:46] yesterday and said it sure is dirty
[46:48] under here
[46:50] I'm kidding I'm kidding
[46:55] I wasn't even tempted to hurt anybody
[46:58] but it was because there were leaves
[47:01] from the wet grass that were stuck up
[47:03] there and they're stains folks
[47:07] some of you that's got shirts you've had
[47:09] for 40 years you know that things just
[47:12] get stained and when we can't make it
[47:15] brand new again but oh what a blessing
[47:19] and it went up and anyway I'm I'm kind
[47:22] of stealing Thunder and I don't want to
[47:24] do that because these brothers have
[47:26] worked so hard Nathan built brand new
[47:28] stobs for the front and we're just
[47:30] amazed at
[47:32] finding so many of the of the axles and
[47:36] the side wall poles and other Greeley
[47:39] painted them up bread the center poles
[47:42] and it was just a wonderful feeling and
[47:44] I I'm sorry that the enemy just you know
[47:47] stirred itself here on Wednesday night I
[47:50] pray that most of your that got into
[47:52] that or recovering well today and then
[47:56] yesterday morning I was here I got here
[47:58] about 10 after nine
[48:00] and there was already a crowd here
[48:02] picking on me for being late
[48:05] and it was just amazing how it went up
[48:08] it I've I've been where that tent was
[48:10] put up many times I wouldn't I wouldn't
[48:13] feel that I was exaggerating to say 300
[48:16] times and I thought about it last night
[48:19] and I would have to say it's been that
[48:21] many and don't know that I've ever seen
[48:23] it go up as good and when brother
[48:25] Greeley mentioned here Tuesday night
[48:27] that
[48:28] we needed strong men everybody was
[48:31] strong and everybody that was weak and
[48:33] and sisters too and brothers too and I
[48:37] was thinking to myself well we probably
[48:38] don't need all those sisters here but
[48:41] but you know we did
[48:43] they held the wall poles and they laced
[48:46] together and they grunted and groaned
[48:48] and got it done and and it felt good
[48:52] you know sometimes people say uh well we
[48:55] don't get enough fellowship at New Hope
[48:57] well I want you to know that you're the
[49:00] minority because the rest of us get
[49:01] about all the fellowship with one
[49:03] another we can take
[49:04] it's a choice
[49:07] people who say that don't stay for
[49:10] picnics and they don't come to work days
[49:12] and they don't make the effort to be
[49:13] here when the body is gathered together
[49:15] outside of a service
[49:17] so you miss
[49:19] you miss it's on you how beautiful how
[49:24] wonderful it is for Brethren to dwell
[49:26] together in unity
[49:28] and when you're working side by side
[49:30] with the kingdom with the with the
[49:32] members of the kingdom of God there's a
[49:34] feeling there's just a feeling of peace
[49:37] and and the presence of the Lord was
[49:40] here and we're just so thankful and we
[49:44] want to say to the seniors that Nathan
[49:46] went last night for us and we had more
[49:49] needed more tables and we bought some
[49:51] more comfortable chairs and we we only
[49:54] bought 16 and what did we how much did
[49:57] they end up being a piece Nathan
[50:01] the chairs are about 25 a piece plus tax
[50:06] and the church is going to take care of
[50:08] those 16 chairs and the four tables but
[50:12] I just had said to brother Greeley last
[50:14] Sunday I'm gonna I want to buy at least
[50:16] one table full of those more comfortable
[50:19] chairs for the seniors and I said I
[50:22] think when everybody sees them and sits
[50:24] in them and and sees how much better
[50:26] they look I don't think we'll have any
[50:27] trouble replacing them all may take a
[50:30] while but I don't think we'll have any
[50:32] trouble so we won't do it tonight today
[50:35] but we might just have a chair auction
[50:37] in here
[50:40] and somebody said well if they buy one
[50:42] they can put their name on I said no
[50:43] they can we don't want their name on the
[50:45] chair
[50:46] because if we do they'll be digging
[50:48] through the pile to find their chair
[50:51] but uh if you will leave those white
[50:53] bottom chairs for the seniors at the
[50:56] picnic today and let them know how much
[50:59] we love them and appreciate them and
[51:01] eventually we'll get you one it'll all
[51:03] work out but just there's just no way to
[51:06] talk about all the things a need comes
[51:09] up and somebody says I'll be right back
[51:11] and they run off to buy what's needed
[51:14] you know nobody come around and said do
[51:16] we have the money can can you write me a
[51:18] check can you everybody just says let's
[51:20] get it done we worry about all that
[51:22] later how many of you know that's what
[51:24] family does
[51:25] so I want to commend every one of you I
[51:28] felt bad that you were worn out and
[51:31] Scattered in the evening when brother
[51:32] and sister minkos moving van got here
[51:36] and I don't know that they had very much
[51:38] help at all but I appreciate those of
[51:41] you who are able did you make it all
[51:43] right
[51:43] and we want to thank God that they have
[51:46] we don't want to say moved in because
[51:48] you know that means boxes unpacked and
[51:51] everything's neat we want to say
[51:54] unloaded right I I'm just sure there's
[51:57] plenty to do but let's thank God that
[51:59] they have were able to get in their
[52:01] place and unloaded let's give God thanks
[52:04] for that
[52:05] [Applause]
[52:09] we want to go to the Lord in prayer and
[52:11] again I want you to remember my wife
[52:13] it's very unusual for her not to be here
[52:16] and and it's hard for me I'm I I really
[52:19] uh it makes a difference for me so would
[52:22] you ask the Lord to raise her up
[52:24] mightily today and strengthen her and
[52:27] Joshua also sister Beverly is finding
[52:31] something very similar I saw where
[52:33] sister Tiffany is also fighting and we
[52:36] want to remember them to the Lord and
[52:38] there's probably even I won't ask who
[52:40] needs a touch from God today because if
[52:43] I do you'll raise your hand and somebody
[52:45] will shun you
[52:49] say well I don't want to get too close
[52:50] to them they raise their hand they were
[52:51] sick so I'm not I'm not going to do that
[52:54] but I'm just going to say may the Lord
[52:56] touch you today and heal you today and
[52:59] protect us
[53:00] let me ask you a very practical question
[53:02] uh uh who has been taking extra vitamin
[53:05] C let me see your hand
[53:07] all right wonderful how about some extra
[53:10] vitamin D let me see your head all right
[53:13] the rest of you are just depending on
[53:14] prayer
[53:17] there's nothing wrong with that
[53:19] but you know the Lord gives us some
[53:21] common sense
[53:23] he really does
[53:24] and you would be surprised I just
[53:28] finished some more research on vitamin C
[53:30] and what it does for the body and how it
[53:33] fights cancer and how it lowers uric
[53:35] acid in the bloodstream and how many how
[53:38] many different in infirmities and
[53:41] sicknesses are connected to uric acid I
[53:44] didn't know there were so many it's
[53:45] something I've struggled with in my body
[53:48] and I didn't know that there are so many
[53:50] things including heart disease and lung
[53:52] disease and and so many other things
[53:54] that can be controlled by controlling
[53:56] uric acid and vitamin C is a powerful
[53:58] thing nothing is more powerful than
[54:01] prayer
[54:02] but a little precaution along the way
[54:04] when you're entering into meetings like
[54:06] this would be wise and it would be smart
[54:09] and you'd be glad because you don't want
[54:11] to miss one service
[54:13] come on now
[54:15] you don't want to miss one because this
[54:17] is the one time a week that we are
[54:19] gathered together like this fully
[54:22] concentrated to get What the Lord Has
[54:24] for us Sister Evelyn Fox reached out and
[54:27] asked for some extra prayer for her
[54:30] traveling down here tomorrow and many
[54:33] others are traveling sister Rebecca has
[54:36] 15 members of her family making their
[54:38] way for the camp meeting this week and
[54:41] we won't ever coming from different
[54:43] places we want every one of them to be
[54:45] remembered those who are flying and and
[54:48] we want to see the place full not so we
[54:51] can brag about a full house but so that
[54:53] every person can be encountered
[54:56] by a living God have a touch in their
[54:59] life sister Sharon's friend Paula is
[55:03] heading south for surgery on a growth on
[55:05] her thyroid and we want to hold her up
[55:08] to the Lord in prayer brother Billy has
[55:10] had some uh uh really Health
[55:13] difficulties lately and we want to hold
[55:15] him up to the Lord and his uncle Richard
[55:17] brother Tebow's brother-in-law a fell
[55:21] off of a ladder and and is in ICU and he
[55:25] broke several bones and really was in
[55:27] pretty serious shape and we want to hold
[55:30] him up to the Lord in prayer all of
[55:33] those who are not here today we want to
[55:35] lift them up if you have a need on your
[55:37] heart would you just hold up your hand
[55:39] across this building you know God sees
[55:42] that we're not dismissing that as
[55:44] non-important because we didn't take
[55:47] time for you to call it out God sees
[55:49] that and we want to see the Lord move on
[55:53] your behalf for the thing that you are
[55:55] concerned about if it concerns you you
[55:59] can rest assured it concerns him I
[56:03] believe that I believe that the smallest
[56:05] thing that's why when someone says would
[56:08] you pray for my pet it doesn't bother me
[56:10] one bit to pray for somebody's animal
[56:12] because if they care about it I know God
[56:15] does whatever you care about he cares
[56:18] about and I want us to stand today and I
[56:21] want us to go to the Lord in prayer and
[56:23] I want us to believe that God is going
[56:25] to help these needs minister to them
[56:28] that he's going to anoint brother
[56:30] Greeley today and use him in a mighty
[56:34] way to build this body up I came in a
[56:37] little lighter today than I normally
[56:39] come in on a Sunday they're still
[56:41] burdens there's still things to be
[56:42] concerned about and things to get done
[56:44] but I came in and walked down the hall a
[56:47] little lighter and I heard somebody say
[56:49] what's going on with Pastor he seems a
[56:51] little lighter today a little happier
[56:53] today yes I'm not preaching
[56:58] I took 15 minutes to drink my coffee
[57:03] it's rest just enjoying myself look took
[57:05] a little extra time on my beard and
[57:08] cleaned it up a little because I I
[57:11] didn't have the responsibility of the
[57:13] word today but I I was praying for the
[57:16] one who does
[57:17] may God use him I feel the Lord right
[57:20] now may God use him in a profound way to
[57:23] speak to our hearts may this be the the
[57:26] greatest camp meeting time that we have
[57:29] ever had together
[57:32] we have we've raised the tent for
[57:35] fellowship and for food because we're
[57:37] going to be serving food after every
[57:40] service beginning
[57:42] Wednesday night and um we're doing that
[57:46] to be a blessing to those who travel and
[57:48] to give you an opportunity to have
[57:50] fellowship with them and so many have
[57:52] been cooking already and buying already
[57:54] and preparing already there's so much to
[57:57] be done but we don't want to be so busy
[57:59] that we miss our blessing and that we
[58:03] miss our opportunity to serve when we
[58:05] come in here what a blessed week we're
[58:07] entering into right now and we want to
[58:10] give God all the glory we want to
[58:13] believe that the word will come forth
[58:15] every night to accomplish exactly what
[58:18] God has sent it to accomplish that there
[58:20] will be deliverances take place this
[58:22] week and lives baptized with the Holy
[58:26] Ghost and Fire and healing Miracles take
[58:29] place Among Us may this be the week that
[58:32] creative Miracles begin in the house why
[58:35] not believe God it's coming
[58:38] it's coming so why not believe now
[58:41] amen so we want to pray for the
[58:44] musicians and uh preachers and those who
[58:48] serve in the audio and video and and
[58:50] singing and because they're going to
[58:52] need strength and anointing and physical
[58:55] healing and help from the Lord we want
[58:59] to lift every one of them up amen let's

[59:49] hearts and challenge us to move up to a
[59:53] higher realm in you we want you to use
[59:57] our brother today from the Oracles of
[1:00:00] God with a call from off your altar that
[1:00:03] he would speak directly to us and we
[1:00:07] would have faith and courage to receive
[1:00:10] your word and to act upon it as quickly
[1:00:13] as possible I pray Lord for those who
[1:00:16] bring their stuff into the house of God
[1:00:19] today I pray that it will not hinder
[1:00:21] them from hearing the word I pray that
[1:00:25] it will not hinder them from their
[1:00:27] healing from their help from their
[1:00:29] Deliverance may they find Grace to lay
[1:00:31] the stuff down and allow you to be God
[1:00:34] in their lives and allow you to bind us
[1:00:37] together in this place with no ISM and
[1:00:40] no Schism but we become one under the
[1:00:44] anointing of the Holy Ghost may we press
[1:00:48] in with everything that we we possess

[1:04:15] know why they don't usually call on me
[1:04:16] to lead a service

[1:04:57] many years was it 50
[1:04:59] 57 years would have been uh the 57th
[1:05:03] anniversary for brother and sister Tebow
[1:05:05] and uh well we could we could have a
[1:05:08] celebration here but how could it begin
[1:05:10] to compare
[1:05:12] with the celebration they're having over
[1:05:15] there
[1:05:16] I wonder if she's still saying bill
[1:05:21] bill
[1:05:26] or he's probably still saying that's
[1:05:28] Rose
[1:05:30] I believe they're at peace in the
[1:05:32] presence of the Lord and we sure miss
[1:05:34] him here and then Thursday of this week
[1:05:36] it's like some kind of jackpot of
[1:05:38] birthdays it's like several all at one
[1:05:41] time Elizabeth Ellsworth has a birthday
[1:05:45] on Thursday
[1:05:48] oh and Kendra wants to make sure we know
[1:05:50] it's 31.
[1:05:52] your friend
[1:05:55] great friend
[1:05:58] what does that matter
[1:06:00] I literally have tents older than that

[1:06:13] radiant hoxson has a birthday hold up
[1:06:16] your hands so everybody can see her how

[1:06:22] how many how many
[1:06:24] 10 years old happy birthday to Rebecca
[1:06:28] we love you
[1:06:33] I could say I could say uh
[1:06:37] Elita Elita but no one would know who
[1:06:40] that was they think it was Mimi so I
[1:06:44] won't say that I'll say more rains she's
[1:06:47] having a birthday also on Thursday we
[1:06:49] want to say happy birthday to her we
[1:06:51] love her
[1:06:55] and brother Steve is not here today but
[1:06:58] his birthday is on Thursday so the next
[1:07:00] time you see him I hope he'll be soon be
[1:07:03] sure to say happy birthday to him how
[1:07:06] many all on one day like that that's
[1:07:08] really something isn't it let's give our
[1:07:10] tithe and offering to the Lord do you
[1:07:12] believe he deserves what's his
[1:07:15] I believe he deserves what's his and I
[1:07:17] believe he deserves a part of what is
[1:07:19] ours that's the tithe in the offering
[1:07:21] when we give God our tithe we're not
[1:07:24] giving him anything but what already
[1:07:27] belongs to him how do you say that
[1:07:29] preacher because the Bible said the
[1:07:30] tithes is it belongs to him we're only
[1:07:34] stewarding what already belongs to God
[1:07:37] and we are a blessed church because this
[1:07:40] is a giving church and we are so
[1:07:42] thankful for those of you who are so
[1:07:44] faithful in your giving we give offering
[1:07:47] because we want to thank him first one
[1:07:50] thing and then another How He blesses us
[1:07:52] all along the way and someone came and
[1:07:56] gave me a wonderful testimony this week
[1:07:58] where there were this morning actually
[1:08:01] where there were needs and things were
[1:08:04] tied and they made a decision to sow a
[1:08:07] hundred dollars into the into the
[1:08:08] insurance offering last weekend and all
[1:08:12] of a sudden six hundred dollars appears
[1:08:14] in the bank account
[1:08:15] you know that's God
[1:08:17] that's just how it works and and I said
[1:08:20] to him that's a very good sign
[1:08:23] because when those things begin
[1:08:25] happening in the body so that you can
[1:08:28] actually put your finger on where the
[1:08:30] increase why the increase has come
[1:08:33] that's a sign that it's about to break
[1:08:35] out
[1:08:36] that's a first fruit I've watched that
[1:08:39] happen so many times and that one
[1:08:42] testimony will become a dozen
[1:08:44] testimonies because that's how God works
[1:08:47] I had another one just remembered
[1:08:48] looking around had another one this week
[1:08:50] uh sister Kathy where she had the same
[1:08:54] kind of thing God ministered and worked
[1:08:56] a miracle for her she sowed a little
[1:08:59] more and trying to trying to figure out
[1:09:01] how to make it work and just gave it and
[1:09:03] God poured that right back into her it
[1:09:06] just works that way
[1:09:08] I I I just have watched it too many
[1:09:10] times so may God bless you for your
[1:09:13] giving today I believe he has already
[1:09:16] and I believe he will let's have Josiah
[1:09:20] and Elias to come they're standing here
[1:09:22] why don't you go around I was going to
[1:09:25] have the people come but why don't you
[1:09:27] go around to them and serve them let's
[1:09:29] give us unto the Lord God bless you as
[1:09:31] you give today
[1:09:36] I was standing on a mountain
[1:09:44] looking toward
[1:09:46] s the sky
[1:09:49] when I saw a storm approaching
[1:09:55] and I fear that I would die
[1:10:02] oh I saw God's creatures
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:08] a better place to hide
[1:10:15] heard the Thunder Rolls down in my soul
[1:10:21] then I bow
[1:10:24] my head
[1:10:27] and cry
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:33] now
[1:10:36] now they were moved
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:44] right

[1:19:03] in getting the tent cleaned and getting

[1:19:08] and
[1:19:10] I too am very sorry for those that
[1:19:13] suffered from the chemical burns
[1:19:16] been praying that God would just
[1:19:17] minister to you and give you a quick
[1:19:21] recovery from that
[1:19:23] uh I want to say thank you to all of you
[1:19:26] who are so quick to change your plans
[1:19:28] when I stood here on Tuesday night and
[1:19:30] said seven o'clock and then charity
[1:19:33] comes and said Dad it'll be nearly dark
[1:19:35] and she says I think we need to back it
[1:19:37] up to five o'clock well I'm not a part
[1:19:39] of that group text and she immediately
[1:19:41] sent it out and you responded and I'm so
[1:19:44] grateful and I thank you for your effort
[1:19:47] to help to get that tent clean and then
[1:19:50] yesterday to be here at nine o'clock to
[1:19:52] help us to get the 10 up would you bring
[1:19:54] these lights down I would just like to
[1:19:56] show this time lapse video that charity
[1:19:58] got of the tent going up
[1:20:01] because it was
[1:20:03] um
[1:20:05] it was it was amazing how quickly it
[1:20:07] went up
[1:20:19] the main body of the tin is in three
[1:20:21] pieces and it has to be laced together
[1:20:25] and the outside poles put in place then
[1:20:28] the center poles
[1:20:30] man that looks so fast
[1:20:35] foreign
[1:20:38] that's a repeat all right
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:44] wait just a minute wait just a minute
[1:20:47] now as we were lacing this tent
[1:20:51] brother Shelley told us that he had
[1:20:54] recently watched a video that
[1:20:56] after the tent is put up
[1:20:59] that they send somebody up on top of the
[1:21:02] tent to lace or to to put the flaps over
[1:21:06] the laces well we did it while it was on
[1:21:09] the ground
[1:21:10] but
[1:21:12] give you this other picture
[1:21:13] Somebody went up on top of that tent
[1:21:19] that is Luke yovich
[1:21:21] and I want to say thank you to Luke
[1:21:23] yovich who ordered the material to
[1:21:25] repair that tent the holes and took care
[1:21:28] of getting it repaired on Thursday night
[1:21:30] but we found more holes yesterday and
[1:21:33] yesterday afternoon he spent fixing
[1:21:35] those holes and so I want to thank Luke
[1:21:39] well
[1:21:41] it is not but I just thought it was kind
[1:21:43] of comical after brother Shelley said
[1:21:45] that they send somebody up there I what
[1:21:48] a thought nobody's gonna get on top of
[1:21:50] that tent but Luke yovich did look
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:22:02] so we appreciate everything that you are
[1:22:05] doing to make this camp meeting possible
[1:22:07] to see that it is
[1:22:12] um
[1:22:12] the best that we've ever had that is
[1:22:15] what we're expecting there is an
[1:22:18] expectation
[1:22:19] that is in the air
[1:22:22] that I don't know whether you've been
[1:22:24] feeling it or not
[1:22:26] but I have
[1:22:30] if you'll stand with us today
[1:22:33] I'm going to try to control myself
[1:22:36] as best I can
[1:22:41] if I let go you not go hear me preach
[1:22:46] hahaha
[1:22:49] there was a spirit of
[1:22:52] intercession
[1:22:58] that came last night
[1:23:02] while I was by myself
[1:23:05] any of you that ever done an ab workout
[1:23:08] that's what it felt like
[1:23:11] there was something powerful
[1:23:13] there's something
[1:23:15] that is moving
[1:23:17] in the spirit
[1:23:20] now I want to tell this local
[1:23:22] congregation I'm going to preach to you
[1:23:24] today you that are watching on the
[1:23:26] stream you're welcome to partake in any
[1:23:29] way that you can but I want this local
[1:23:31] body
[1:23:32] don't miss
[1:23:34] your visitation this week
[1:23:38] don't become so involved in all of the
[1:23:42] stuff that we must do to serve that you
[1:23:46] miss your visitation when you come in
[1:23:49] here leave all of that outside and enter
[1:23:53] into the things of God and let's get

[1:27:03] you're seated Our Father how grateful we
[1:27:05] are to be gathered in your presence
[1:27:07] today with fellow believers who are
[1:27:10] pressing in to all that you have for us
[1:27:15] oh God and we are we are just yielding
[1:27:18] ourselves everyone under your Mighty
[1:27:21] hand to for you to do in and through us
[1:27:25] what you desire to do now Lord we've
[1:27:28] gathered today on this first day of the
[1:27:31] week at the beginning of the Feast of
[1:27:34] Tabernacles but oh God we are making
[1:27:37] preparations continually for what you
[1:27:41] are doing what you are unfolding this
[1:27:43] week God we believe that you're already
[1:27:46] unfolding things and we honor you for
[1:27:49] that and so we are just here to absorb
[1:27:52] what you desire to do in our lives get
[1:27:57] honor and Glory Lord I pray that you
[1:28:01] will rest our pastor and that you will
[1:28:04] rejuvenate him and that you will pour
[1:28:06] energy and strengthen to him for the
[1:28:09] days ahead Lord and we're decreeing it
[1:28:12] over his entire family and over this
[1:28:15] body oh God that you will just pour into
[1:28:19] US
[1:28:20] Supernatural energy God that we can be
[1:28:23] all you've called us to be and it's in
[1:28:26] the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:28] we pray amen
[1:28:32] praise the Lord you may be seated today
[1:28:36] for the past several weeks the Lord has
[1:28:38] been uh
[1:28:40] just speaking to me those two words that
[1:28:42] we read there in Leviticus chapter 23
[1:28:46] the words holy convocation
[1:28:50] that this was not just going to be a uh
[1:28:54] just a typical camp meeting where we
[1:28:57] would gather and rejoice but there was
[1:28:59] something sacred about it something holy
[1:29:01] something set aside something
[1:29:04] extraordinary that he was going to do in
[1:29:07] our midst that we were not to take it
[1:29:09] lightly that we were not to come as a
[1:29:12] haphazard and something thrown together
[1:29:15] but that we were to make preparation for
[1:29:18] it because God was going to meet us he's
[1:29:22] going to speak to us and then as my mind
[1:29:27] began to think about the Holy
[1:29:29] convocation about a meeting where God
[1:29:32] just shows up and he he does
[1:29:35] Supernatural things was because so many
[1:29:38] times as human beings we get in to a
[1:29:41] place where that we become uh just
[1:29:44] accustomed with one another and with our
[1:29:48] surroundings and with these pews that we
[1:29:50] sit in we become accustomed to sitting
[1:29:53] in the same place we become accustomed
[1:29:56] to parking in the same spot we become
[1:29:58] accustomed to singing the same songs
[1:30:00] wearing the same clothes doing the same
[1:30:03] things and leaving the same way
[1:30:08] but God is calling us to a holy to a set
[1:30:13] aside to a convocation a real meeting
[1:30:17] with him one that is separate from all
[1:30:20] of the other times one that is different
[1:30:23] from the other times and God is already
[1:30:27] working setting things in motion
[1:30:29] speaking to people drawing people
[1:30:32] causing people to fast to pray to set
[1:30:36] themselves aside because they feel it on
[1:30:39] the inside something is different
[1:30:42] something is moving something is
[1:30:45] happening and so this this holy
[1:30:49] convocation that God set aside for the
[1:30:52] children of Israel it was uh the first
[1:30:54] day was the Sabbath the last day of
[1:30:56] Sabbath but it was to be a time of
[1:30:59] rejoicing a time of rejoicing in the
[1:31:02] Lord for the goodness that he had showed
[1:31:05] to the children of Israel all of their
[1:31:07] days that he did not make them to remain
[1:31:10] in booths
[1:31:12] but he well he gave them a home
[1:31:15] eventually in a Promised Land but every
[1:31:19] year they were to go and to dwell in
[1:31:21] these booths to remember that they had
[1:31:26] dwelt that way once upon a time then my
[1:31:30] mind began to think about the Tabernacle
[1:31:33] in the wilderness and how that God gave
[1:31:36] instruction to Moses and Moses went on
[1:31:40] the mountain to hear what God had to say
[1:31:43] about this Tabernacle because the
[1:31:46] Tabernacle was not a permanent Dwelling
[1:31:48] Place it was a place where that it could
[1:31:51] be picked up and moved just the same as
[1:31:55] the people's tents that they were
[1:31:56] dwelling in with their families it could
[1:31:59] be picked up and moved but something
[1:32:02] Supernatural happened inside of that
[1:32:05] movable Tabernacle the because the
[1:32:08] children of Israel were murmuring and
[1:32:11] they were complaining and then they were
[1:32:14] trying to decide Who's Who and God said
[1:32:17] I want every man to take a rod
[1:32:22] and I want them to bring it to the door
[1:32:24] of the congregation this is number 17. I
[1:32:28] want them to bring it to the door of the
[1:32:31] congregation each tribe is to bring
[1:32:34] their rod out of the head of that tribe
[1:32:37] and bring it along with Aaron in his
[1:32:40] tribe and I want you to put them in the
[1:32:43] holy of holies I want you to put them in
[1:32:46] that place where I am going to meet with
[1:32:50] you it is in that place where God
[1:32:54] promised Moses I'm going to meet with
[1:32:57] you and so as Moses takes these sticks
[1:33:00] they're just dry sticks dry nothing uh
[1:33:05] parent about them nothing any more
[1:33:08] special in one man's stick than the
[1:33:10] other man's stick it was just a the the
[1:33:13] staff that these men carried and they
[1:33:17] were dry there did not seem to be any
[1:33:19] life in them it just stood to reason
[1:33:22] because they those sticks had been
[1:33:25] disconnected from their life source
[1:33:29] they had been disconnected from their
[1:33:33] life Source when they were taken into
[1:33:35] the holy of holies and left overnight
[1:33:38] something Supernatural happened not to
[1:33:42] all of them but only one of them
[1:33:46] that Rod was the rod of Aaron and is
[1:33:49] said that not only did that Rod bud but
[1:33:52] it bloomed and it brought forth almonds
[1:33:56] the supernatural power of the Living God
[1:34:00] God in that rod and when it was in that
[1:34:04] presence there's something Supernatural
[1:34:07] happened because God had put his hand
[1:34:11] upon the tribe of Levi that they were
[1:34:15] supposed to serve in the Tabernacle why
[1:34:18] was that tribe supposed to serve in the
[1:34:21] Tabernacle if you go back in the
[1:34:23] scripture you can see all the way back
[1:34:26] to the night when God was bringing them
[1:34:29] out of Egypt
[1:34:30] it was to be God said I want you to
[1:34:34] sanctify the firstborn
[1:34:36] that was God's original choice according
[1:34:40] to the scripture the firstborn but when
[1:34:43] they came when God Sanctified them and
[1:34:46] the blood was put over the door and if
[1:34:48] it was not put over the door of down the
[1:34:50] lentil and the doorpost that firstborn
[1:34:53] of that house any of them that would
[1:34:55] been there would have died but because
[1:34:58] the blood the token was applied because
[1:35:02] the token was put on the lentil and the
[1:35:05] doorpost there was something that
[1:35:07] happened that night that was
[1:35:09] Supernatural it was above the natural
[1:35:13] and so when when the death angel passed
[1:35:17] over and he first born that was under
[1:35:19] the blood was spared their lives were
[1:35:22] spared that was God's choice
[1:35:25] but when they came out of Egypt and they
[1:35:28] went over across the Red Sea and they
[1:35:31] got out in the wilderness and they began
[1:35:33] to murmur and complain and they began to
[1:35:36] uh just a Wonder where's God's man
[1:35:41] what's going on he brought us out here
[1:35:45] to die we've got to have a leader what's
[1:35:47] going on we've got to have somebody
[1:35:50] Aaron why don't you lead us
[1:35:52] okay
[1:35:53] Aaron he began to listen to the people
[1:35:59] and as he's listening to the people
[1:36:03] they're wanting a God to serve not
[1:36:06] realizing that the man that has been
[1:36:09] chosen to lead them is in the mountain
[1:36:11] talking to the Living God and they're
[1:36:14] down here playing around in the valley
[1:36:16] wanting somebody to lead them and
[1:36:19] wanting a God that they can follow Now
[1:36:22] by Aaron when Moses came off the
[1:36:25] mountain Moses was angry and he had
[1:36:27] every right to be and Aaron looks at him
[1:36:30] and says they brought all their jewelry
[1:36:33] and I threw it in the fire and this is
[1:36:34] what come out
[1:36:36] down
[1:36:41] we say dumb things when we're under the
[1:36:43] when we're under the microscope
[1:36:46] we say some dumb things
[1:36:48] but Aaron
[1:36:51] Aaron told him said now Moses
[1:36:54] now look
[1:36:55] the people wanted something to follow
[1:36:57] they brought all their earrings they
[1:37:00] brought all their gold and we just threw
[1:37:01] it in the fire and this God come out and
[1:37:03] here we are we're just circling around
[1:37:06] and we and Moses said who is on the
[1:37:09] Lord's Side
[1:37:11] who is on the Lord's Side let him come
[1:37:16] unto me
[1:37:18] and it wasn't all of the firstborn that
[1:37:21] came to him the Bible said it was the
[1:37:23] Levites that came to him and so now we
[1:37:27] have when the The Stick of the of the
[1:37:30] House of Levi the rod of the House of
[1:37:32] Levi the priesthood now this Rod has
[1:37:36] been taken with all of the other dead
[1:37:38] sticks
[1:37:40] in behind the holy of holies
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:44] something going on now
[1:37:47] and God does something in that rod and
[1:37:50] we get Buds and Blossoms and uh almonds
[1:37:54] now and God said I have chosen the tribe
[1:37:58] of Levi
[1:38:00] and God I'm only telling you all of this
[1:38:03] because God said I will meet you in
[1:38:08] there
[1:38:09] I will meet you in there friends there's
[1:38:13] something Supernatural
[1:38:16] something incredibly Supernatural I have
[1:38:21] been I have been pondering the lights of
[1:38:24] God for quite some time because we talk
[1:38:28] about don't let the light go out and I
[1:38:32] Ponder I Ponder how is it that this
[1:38:35] seven Branch Candlestick can never go
[1:38:39] out because the Wicks have to be trimmed
[1:38:41] and oil has to be added and I'm telling
[1:38:44] you it's not the right light
[1:38:48] it's the Shekinah in the holy of holies
[1:38:53] the light of God that never goes out
[1:38:56] that's the light that we're looking for
[1:39:01] we're looking for light to be so evident
[1:39:04] inside of us that it never goes out we
[1:39:09] have our ups we have our downs we have
[1:39:12] our sunny days and we have our cloudy
[1:39:14] days and we have to keep the weeks
[1:39:17] trimmed and be refilled with oil but oh
[1:39:21] if we could ever get inside of the holy
[1:39:24] of holies and be so endued with power
[1:39:28] from on high
[1:39:30] the Shekinah the light of God that will
[1:39:34] forever change us
[1:39:37] we have talked for years around here
[1:39:40] about the difference between the baptism
[1:39:45] of the Holy Ghost and the refillings and
[1:39:48] the final seal of God something that
[1:39:51] cannot be taken away something that
[1:39:54] cannot diminish because it is what God
[1:39:56] has placed his seal Upon Us in such a
[1:40:01] magnitude that nothing no circumstance
[1:40:04] of life no circumstance that we Face
[1:40:07] could ever cause it to me to diminish
[1:40:10] anymore
[1:40:11] we have UPS we have downs but the power
[1:40:15] of God is coming into us more and more
[1:40:19] and more and more because he wants us to
[1:40:23] be so steady
[1:40:25] so uh solid and and on the rock of the
[1:40:31] Revelation that has been given to us
[1:40:33] that we cannot be moved off of it we can
[1:40:37] see people that have said I have a
[1:40:40] revelation I have a revelation of who
[1:40:44] Jesus is and there have been things that
[1:40:46] have come along and caused them to be
[1:40:49] knocked on knocked away and I don't know
[1:40:52] what the end result will be only God
[1:40:56] does but I have seen people be knocked
[1:40:59] to the left and I've seen people be
[1:41:01] knocked to the right and there's more
[1:41:03] shaking that's coming I'm quite sure of
[1:41:06] it because we're still here there's more
[1:41:09] shaking that's coming and I want to be
[1:41:12] so solid and so steady in the word of
[1:41:15] God that if this one falls off and that
[1:41:18] one falls off Upon This Rock I will
[1:41:21] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:41:25] will never Prevail against it that's the
[1:41:29] rock I want to be anchored to
[1:41:32] rock that we need to be building upon
[1:41:36] so this
[1:41:38] Tabernacle in the wilderness that God
[1:41:40] has caused his people to erect and now
[1:41:44] the this uh this Dr dead dry stick has
[1:41:49] blossomed and God has told Moses I'm
[1:41:52] going to meet you in there
[1:41:59] I don't
[1:42:00] even begin
[1:42:03] to understand
[1:42:06] the calling in Moses
[1:42:11] and the leadership
[1:42:13] skills that it must have taken
[1:42:16] to lead all that people
[1:42:21] now you can
[1:42:23] you can say
[1:42:25] that it was all Supernatural but I
[1:42:27] really believe that some of his training
[1:42:30] in Egypt
[1:42:32] the natural training gave him an edge
[1:42:37] what he learned in Egypt gave him an
[1:42:40] edge but God had to take him to the back
[1:42:42] side of the desert to knock all of the
[1:42:44] pride of Egypt out of him so that it
[1:42:47] could bring him and he he poured himself
[1:42:50] into Moses and then he came back to lead
[1:42:52] the children of Israel out and Moses if
[1:42:56] he would have tried to lead the children
[1:42:58] of Israel at the end of his 40 years his
[1:43:03] first 40 years he would have ended up
[1:43:06] doing to the people as he did before he
[1:43:10] fled Egypt
[1:43:14] he would have become angry
[1:43:17] and he would have said
[1:43:20] away with you right I am not going to
[1:43:22] deal with you
[1:43:24] but God chose to take him to the back
[1:43:26] side of the desert to take him into a
[1:43:29] place he didn't really know anything
[1:43:30] about and to put in him something that
[1:43:35] was so above the ordinary because it was
[1:43:38] going to take that Supernatural element
[1:43:40] inside of him in order to overcome all
[1:43:45] of the things that were going to come at
[1:43:47] him now that is not just for a leader
[1:43:50] that is for the Bride of Jesus Christ at
[1:43:54] large all of that desert that you have
[1:43:57] felt like that you have wandered through
[1:43:59] and you felt like you had no friends and
[1:44:02] you felt like you were depressed and you
[1:44:04] were anxious and you were angry and you
[1:44:06] were all of this stuff and God just
[1:44:08] continued bringing his word to you and
[1:44:11] letting you go through low times and
[1:44:13] valleys and deserts friends it's because
[1:44:16] he's trying to instill something
[1:44:19] Supernatural in you
[1:44:22] because you're never going to conquer
[1:44:25] this world you're never going to be the
[1:44:28] complete Overcomer that God called you
[1:44:31] to be just operating in the natural
[1:44:34] realm because there are more people in
[1:44:37] this world that have tenacity and
[1:44:40] self-will more than some of us have who
[1:44:43] would would with with grit would
[1:44:46] overcome many many things but when it
[1:44:50] comes up to Pentecost when it comes up
[1:44:53] to a real experience with the Lord Jesus
[1:44:56] Christ they would be like Judas and say
[1:44:59] I've come all I'm going to come I'm
[1:45:02] through
[1:45:04] but there's something inside of you and
[1:45:07] there's something inside of me that
[1:45:10] predestinated seed of God that just
[1:45:13] continues hungering and thirsting and
[1:45:17] hungering and thirsting for more of God
[1:45:20] and God just keeps pouring it out yes
[1:45:23] preacher but I still have I still have
[1:45:26] anxieties and I still have low days and
[1:45:29] high days oh yes we do
[1:45:31] we're still walking in humanity but
[1:45:34] there's something inside of us that
[1:45:36] keeps saying press on press on press on
[1:45:39] press on press on keep moving keep
[1:45:42] moving
[1:45:43] and then through another
[1:45:46] why should I keep moving everybody else
[1:45:49] seems to be quitting let them quit
[1:45:52] let them quit
[1:45:55] there's something on the inside of me
[1:45:59] and I know it's on the inside of most of
[1:46:01] you and by the end of this week I'm
[1:46:05] expecting it to be throughout this whole
[1:46:07] congregation in such a move of God until
[1:46:10] that we are lifted up we are raised up
[1:46:14] into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:46:17] higher than we've ever experienced
[1:46:20] before now friends I want you to know I
[1:46:23] am not here to Hype you up today
[1:46:26] I am not here to Hype you in fact if I
[1:46:29] could have some kind of a a trip meter
[1:46:33] here something to stop the hype I would
[1:46:36] do I would set it because many times
[1:46:39] people get hyped up for something and
[1:46:41] then they get disappointed because they
[1:46:44] got hyper
[1:46:47] rather than expectant they got hyper
[1:46:51] and I don't want us to get hyper I want
[1:46:55] us to have such an expectation of the
[1:46:58] Living God until that every service we
[1:47:01] come in we've already left outside our
[1:47:05] anxieties and our fears and our anger
[1:47:09] and our rage and our disappointments
[1:47:11] with one another we just leave it all
[1:47:13] outside and come into the house of the
[1:47:16] Lord and say Lord ah I've dealt with all
[1:47:20] of that stuff today maybe I don't
[1:47:22] understand no we got to work our jobs
[1:47:24] before we come to the meeting and we're
[1:47:26] going to deal with stuff but we want to
[1:47:28] leave it aside you say preacher I don't
[1:47:31] know how to leave it aside
[1:47:35] how do I how do I leave aside this stuff
[1:47:40] that's going around in my head and it
[1:47:42] and it's just consuming me
[1:47:44] how do I do it the simplest way that I
[1:47:47] know to tell you is to walk through the
[1:47:50] door saying Lord I'm yielding myself to
[1:47:54] you
[1:47:55] I give myself to you today any of those
[1:47:59] words that I've just mentioned any of
[1:48:02] those things that may be going through
[1:48:04] your head Lord I'm laying them aside for
[1:48:07] the moment because it's my determination
[1:48:10] to press into God to see what he has for
[1:48:14] me because I am not going to miss my
[1:48:18] visitation from the Living God I am not
[1:48:22] going to miss my opportunity it even
[1:48:26] came to my mind you mamas that get so
[1:48:29] involved in taking care of your babies
[1:48:31] sometimes you're just gonna have to hand
[1:48:34] them off to somebody else
[1:48:36] new musicians that might feel so
[1:48:38] connected to your instrument you may
[1:48:41] have to just step out and we may have to
[1:48:43] sing without music we may just have to
[1:48:46] we may just have to sing acapella for a
[1:48:49] while because God wants to do something
[1:48:52] for every one of us
[1:48:56] every one of us
[1:49:01] and we can just bring the babies right
[1:49:04] into the presence of the Lord
[1:49:10] right
[1:49:13] I
[1:49:15] will meet you there
[1:49:17] there's something Supernatural
[1:49:20] that happens
[1:49:22] in that place
[1:49:24] behind
[1:49:26] that curtain
[1:49:29] those of you that have been here for
[1:49:31] some time
[1:49:33] that little room
[1:49:35] that little room
[1:49:37] where it's just you and Jesus you say
[1:49:40] this is a great big groom how can it be
[1:49:42] me and Jesus this is Tabernacles my
[1:49:45] friend this is the time where that you
[1:49:48] can have people in front of you in back
[1:49:52] of you beside of you and still by the
[1:49:56] grace of God you can create a tabernacle
[1:50:00] around you you can create a little
[1:50:03] cocoon around you in such a way till
[1:50:06] that everybody else just Fades into
[1:50:09] peripheral everybody else Fades out of
[1:50:12] your view and you just allow the Holy
[1:50:16] Spirit to do
[1:50:18] what he wants to in you
[1:50:25] Ezekiel chapter 47
[1:50:27] verse 1.
[1:50:29] afterward he brought me again unto the
[1:50:31] door of the house and behold
[1:50:33] Waters issued out from under the
[1:50:35] threshold of the house Eastward
[1:50:39] for the Forefront of the house stood
[1:50:41] toward the East and the waters came
[1:50:44] down from under the right from under the
[1:50:47] right side of the house at the south
[1:50:48] side of the altar
[1:50:50] then he brought me out of the way of the
[1:50:52] gate northward and led me about the way
[1:50:55] without unto the utter gate by the way
[1:50:58] that looketh Eastward and behold there
[1:50:59] ran out waters on the right side
[1:51:02] and when the man that had the line in
[1:51:05] his hand went forth Eastward he measured
[1:51:07] a thousand cubits and he brought me
[1:51:10] through the waters
[1:51:12] the waters were to the ankles
[1:51:16] again he measured a thousand and he
[1:51:18] brought me through the waters
[1:51:21] the waters were to the knees again he
[1:51:24] measured a thousand and he brought me
[1:51:26] through the waters were to the loins
[1:51:30] afterward he measured a thousand and it
[1:51:33] was a river that I could not pass over
[1:51:35] for the waters were risen Waters to swim
[1:51:38] in a river that could not be passed over
[1:51:42] and he said unto me son of man
[1:51:45] have you seen this
[1:51:47] that he brought me and caused me to
[1:51:49] return to the brink of the river now
[1:51:52] when I had returned behold at the bank
[1:51:55] of the river were very many trees on the
[1:51:57] one side and on the other then he said
[1:51:59] unto me the waters issue out toward the
[1:52:02] East Country and go down to the desert
[1:52:05] and go into the sea which bring being
[1:52:06] brought forth into the sea the waters
[1:52:10] shall be healed
[1:52:12] and it shall come to pass that every
[1:52:14] thing that liveth
[1:52:17] which moveth
[1:52:19] withersoever the river shall come
[1:52:22] shall live
[1:52:23] and there shall be a very great
[1:52:25] multitude of fish
[1:52:27] because these Waters shall come thither
[1:52:29] for they shall be healed and everything
[1:52:32] shall live wither the river cometh and
[1:52:35] it shall come to pass that the Fishers
[1:52:37] shall stand upon it from and Getty even
[1:52:40] to an eglium they shall be a place to
[1:52:44] spread forth Nets their fish shall be
[1:52:47] according to their kinds as the fish of
[1:52:49] the great sea exceeding many but the
[1:52:52] Mirey places thereof and the marshes
[1:52:55] thereof shall not be healed they shall
[1:52:58] be given to salt and by the river upon
[1:53:00] the bank thereof on this side and on
[1:53:02] that side shall grow up trees for meat
[1:53:05] whose leaves shall not fade neither
[1:53:07] shall the fruit thereof be consumed it
[1:53:10] shall bring forth new fruit according to
[1:53:13] his months because their Waters they
[1:53:15] issued out of the sanctuary
[1:53:18] and the fruit thereof shall be for meat
[1:53:21] and the leaf thereof for medicine
[1:53:31] revelation 22 verses 1 and 2 he showed
[1:53:34] me a pure River of Water of Life
[1:53:36] clearest Crystal proceeding out of the
[1:53:39] Throne of God and of the lamb in the
[1:53:41] midst of the street of it and on the
[1:53:43] either side of the river was there a
[1:53:45] tree of life the Tree of Life which bear
[1:53:47] 12 manner of fruits and yielded her
[1:53:50] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[1:53:52] tree were for the healing of the Nations
[1:53:55] I wanted to read that into the record
[1:53:57] because I want you to again see that
[1:54:01] this pure River of Water of Life ushers
[1:54:03] forth from the Throne of God and when
[1:54:06] Moses brought the tabernacle into the
[1:54:08] earth when he brought it into the Earth
[1:54:10] it was because he saw the pattern of it
[1:54:13] when he was in the mountain he had
[1:54:15] already been up on the mountain to talk
[1:54:17] to the Lord and the Lord was talking to
[1:54:19] him and he's taken in all of this that
[1:54:21] he was supposed to bring down into the
[1:54:24] Earth and in how his mind I I don't know
[1:54:27] did he draw it out did he have did he
[1:54:29] put it on the stone like he did The Ten
[1:54:31] Commandments I don't know but he brought
[1:54:33] it down to bezelil and bezeliel was
[1:54:36] God's chosen instrument to be able to
[1:54:39] understand Moses to be able to put
[1:54:42] together a work team to be able to
[1:54:45] construct the Tabernacle according to
[1:54:48] what Moses had seen in the mountain that
[1:54:51] he had pulled down from heaven
[1:54:54] and in the holy of holies
[1:54:57] God instructed them to put the Ark of
[1:55:01] the Covenant where those Cherry Beam
[1:55:03] with the wings touching oh were over the
[1:55:05] the the Ark of the Covenant and in that
[1:55:08] place was the Shekinah remember brother
[1:55:10] Shelley told us on Tuesday night talking
[1:55:13] about the day of atonement it was the
[1:55:14] only day of the year that the high
[1:55:17] priest only could go behind that curtain
[1:55:19] and there with the incense he could
[1:55:22] experience the glory of God but it was
[1:55:25] that one time where he brought the blood
[1:55:27] and he put it upon The Mercy Seat one
[1:55:30] time a year but when the precious lamb
[1:55:32] of God came to the earth when that
[1:55:35] precious lamb that was slain from before
[1:55:37] the foundation of the world came into
[1:55:40] the Earth and he shed his blood that we
[1:55:43] could have life and having more
[1:55:45] abundantly it was put on the altar once
[1:55:49] and for all
[1:55:52] there was not a necessity for another
[1:55:54] bull to be killed there was not a
[1:55:57] necessity for another lamb to be killed
[1:55:59] there was not a necessity for another
[1:56:01] turtle dove to be brought to be killed
[1:56:04] because that one sacrifice was brought
[1:56:07] for war for all people for all time
[1:56:10] there never had to be another one but
[1:56:13] then and when that lamb died at Calvary
[1:56:16] that curtain was rent from top to bottom
[1:56:20] and it was an open invitation for the
[1:56:23] believer to come into that place where
[1:56:26] the Shekinah of God the Shekinah Glory
[1:56:29] of God was
[1:56:31] yes but people have been too afraid
[1:56:35] too afraid
[1:56:36] too afraid
[1:56:38] you know why we've been too afraid
[1:56:40] because we've been sold a bill of goods
[1:56:43] by the enemy that tried to continue to
[1:56:46] tell us that we were not worthy to come
[1:56:49] in that we had too many sins in our life
[1:56:52] that we had too many scars in our life
[1:56:54] that we had too much hanging on us that
[1:56:57] we could not go behind there but my
[1:56:59] friend we have an open invitation and
[1:57:02] you don't have to get good enough our
[1:57:05] lamb was the best he was the perfect
[1:57:08] lamb and he invited us in behind there
[1:57:14] when he invited us in behind
[1:57:17] that curtain
[1:57:20] that curtain
[1:57:22] that was in the Tabernacle
[1:57:24] then on in the temple
[1:57:29] it was no longer there
[1:57:32] no longer there
[1:57:37] according to historians they're not even
[1:57:39] sure that the ark was there
[1:57:43] but I want to tell you something today
[1:57:47] when you find yourself in that little
[1:57:50] room
[1:57:53] he made a promise to you
[1:57:55] I will meet you there
[1:57:59] if you have met the requirements that he
[1:58:03] gave in his word if you repent and
[1:58:06] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:58:10] the remission of your sins you shall
[1:58:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:58:15] there is something behind that Veil that
[1:58:19] Veil that was ripped from top to bottom
[1:58:21] that's not the veil that I'm talking
[1:58:23] about there is a veil that the enemy has
[1:58:26] tried to put in front of us to keep us
[1:58:29] out but the word the revelation of the
[1:58:33] of Jesus Christ has come and unveiled to
[1:58:37] the people of God
[1:58:40] thank you
[1:58:44] now this unveiling
[1:58:46] was not to the crowd at Large
[1:58:54] when this unveiling
[1:58:56] takes place
[1:58:58] it's an unveiling to an individual
[1:59:02] because in a crowd this size
[1:59:05] and smaller
[1:59:07] God can bring a revelation of his word
[1:59:10] and one person get the Revelation and
[1:59:13] the one sitting right beside of them
[1:59:15] think
[1:59:16] well that's the craziest thing I've ever
[1:59:18] heard
[1:59:21] one person can leave a meeting saying
[1:59:25] another person can leave
[1:59:28] send me a buzzard
[1:59:30] it's because it's an individual
[1:59:33] Revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:35] but I am calling to this body and to
[1:59:38] anybody that will listen to me do not
[1:59:41] miss your hour of visitation because the
[1:59:43] Holy Spirit wants to move Among Us and
[1:59:46] is moving Among Us and has been moving
[1:59:48] Among Us and people have been pressing
[1:59:50] in and coming as close as they can to
[1:59:53] the fire because they realize I'm not
[1:59:56] going to be left behind
[1:59:59] this church is moving forward I'm not
[2:00:01] going to be left behind I am not going
[2:00:03] to sit in my seat of misery while
[2:00:06] everybody else is getting something I'm
[2:00:08] just gonna step up and see if I can get
[2:00:11] something I don't feel anything right
[2:00:14] this second
[2:00:16] what do feelings have to do with it
[2:00:21] what do feelings have to do with it
[2:00:27] but everybody else is getting in and I'm
[2:00:29] not feeling a thing
[2:00:31] maybe you're still in the outer Court
[2:00:36] maybe you're just in the inner Court
[2:00:39] I'm not trying to Badger you I'm not
[2:00:41] trying to no I'm not trying to make you
[2:00:43] feel bad but I'm trying to give you some
[2:00:46] encouragement than when people are
[2:00:48] moving forward toward the pillar of fire
[2:00:51] you ought to get up and move
[2:00:57] get up and move
[2:01:10] I'm tired
[2:01:12] I don't feel like moving
[2:01:17] did you watch Benjamin today
[2:01:22] when he walked over
[2:01:24] his shirt was soaked
[2:01:26] because he'd give it everything he had
[2:01:35] what I recognized in him was that
[2:01:38] whether you moved or not he was going to
[2:01:42] [Applause]
[2:01:45] if you watch your pastor when he
[2:01:47] preaches and gives everything
[2:01:51] and we feel tired
[2:01:53] he does too
[2:01:54] his body aches doesn't feel good
[2:01:57] sometimes but he comes and gives
[2:02:00] everything because he's not paying
[2:02:02] attention to you he has got a boss
[2:02:05] that's higher than he is
[2:02:09] and if you and I could ever get a
[2:02:12] revelation an understanding that he's
[2:02:16] not the boss
[2:02:17] [Applause]
[2:02:20] I'm not the boss
[2:02:22] we've all got a higher boss
[2:02:25] [Applause]
[2:02:27] if the Lord doesn't come he may be taken
[2:02:30] off the scene but God is still on the
[2:02:33] throne
[2:02:34] and he's still going to be looking for
[2:02:37] believers
[2:02:39] believers who are willing to give
[2:02:42] everything
[2:02:52] well I can't give everything every time
[2:02:56] foreign
[2:03:00] I understand
[2:03:01] Humanity
[2:03:06] but many years ago
[2:03:08] some of you newcomers
[2:03:10] many years ago
[2:03:12] God spoke in this place I believe it was
[2:03:15] while we were still in Columbus
[2:03:17] I think that it was two minutes
[2:03:20] in the presence of God
[2:03:23] would be like eight hours of restful
[2:03:25] sleep
[2:03:29] two minutes
[2:03:31] can you give two minutes
[2:03:34] do you have two minutes
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:39] just two
[2:03:41] two minutes
[2:03:43] but I'm tired two minutes
[2:03:47] can I call you to work some overtime two
[2:03:50] minutes
[2:03:53] if I have that wrong I'm sorry but I
[2:03:56] know it was very short amount of time
[2:03:58] two minutes
[2:04:00] will you work some overtime
[2:04:03] you may be off the work clock but will
[2:04:05] you work some overtime
[2:04:07] because I believe if we come in with
[2:04:10] that kind of attitude God there's
[2:04:13] something Supernatural that I'm being
[2:04:16] told about and I don't feel it right
[2:04:19] this second as I'm getting out of my car
[2:04:21] and I'm trying to get energy to walk in
[2:04:24] that building but God I heard that
[2:04:26] preacher say that two minutes and God
[2:04:28] I'm coming I'm willing to give three
[2:04:31] minutes of overtime because I believe
[2:04:35] that if I can ever get in that two
[2:04:38] minutes
[2:04:41] then time won't matter and you won't
[2:04:43] care about the overtime anymore
[2:04:46] you'll be so grateful for the power of
[2:04:48] God that surges inside of you that you
[2:04:51] will go away saying oh how good it was
[2:04:56] to be
[2:04:57] in the presence of God
[2:05:01] so Ezekiel has this vision of the water
[2:05:04] that's coming from the Throne of God
[2:05:08] Hallelujah
[2:05:10] now when something originates from the
[2:05:13] Throne of God
[2:05:16] [Music]
[2:05:22] and the water came from the Throne of
[2:05:24] God and when Ezekiel Saw It
[2:05:27] he saw this one with a measuring line in
[2:05:32] his hand
[2:05:33] and
[2:05:35] this one goes and he measures out a
[2:05:38] thousand cubits
[2:05:41] we don't talk in qubits in 2022 that is
[2:05:45] approximately
[2:05:46] 1476 feet
[2:05:52] those of you that
[2:05:54] understand football
[2:05:56] it's approximately four lengths of the
[2:05:58] field
[2:06:00] 1476 feet
[2:06:02] so this one measures out a thousand
[2:06:05] cubits this water this holy water that
[2:06:08] is coming ushering forth from the Throne
[2:06:10] of God and the first measurement he
[2:06:12] gives and Ezekiel says it was to my
[2:06:15] ankles
[2:06:17] and then he measures out another
[2:06:19] thousand now we are at three thousand
[2:06:23] feet approximately and when the when he
[2:06:27] steps out into that water the water it
[2:06:29] says that it was to my knees and then he
[2:06:32] steps out another thousand cubits and
[2:06:35] and Ezekiel says then it was to my loins
[2:06:39] and when he says I said when he measured
[2:06:41] the fourth time out into those Waters he
[2:06:45] said it was Waters to swim in
[2:06:48] it was no more splashing around just
[2:06:51] feeling good on the feet or up to the
[2:06:54] knees but there was Waters to swim in so
[2:06:58] the the river of God that was coming out
[2:07:02] from under the Throne of God ushering
[2:07:04] forth Ezekiel was seeing this
[2:07:07] and Ezekiel
[2:07:11] to my understanding
[2:07:14] was not
[2:07:16] just satisfied
[2:07:18] to stay on the sidelines
[2:07:23] Ezekiel knew that there was healing in
[2:07:26] that water
[2:07:27] Ezekiel knew that there was something in
[2:07:29] that water that was Supernatural because
[2:07:32] it originated at the Throne of God now I
[2:07:35] want you to turn with me to Genesis
[2:07:37] chapter 2.
[2:07:40] Genesis chapter 2 and verse 1 thus the
[2:07:43] heavens and the Earth were finished and
[2:07:44] all the hosts of them and on the seventh
[2:07:46] day God ended his work which he had made
[2:07:48] and he rested on the seventh day from
[2:07:51] all his work which he had made and God
[2:07:54] blessed the seventh day and Sanctified
[2:07:56] it because that in it he had rested from
[2:07:59] all his work which God created and made
[2:08:03] these are the generations of the heavens
[2:08:06] and of the earth when they were created
[2:08:08] in the day that the Lord God made the
[2:08:10] earth and the heavens and every plant in
[2:08:13] the field before it was in the earth and
[2:08:15] every herb of the field before it grew
[2:08:18] for the Lord God had not caused it to
[2:08:20] rain upon the Earth and there was no man
[2:08:23] to till the ground and the Lord God
[2:08:25] formed man of the Dust of the ground and
[2:08:27] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[2:08:29] life and Man became a living Soul verse
[2:08:32] 8. and the Lord God planted a garden
[2:08:35] Eastward
[2:08:37] in Eden
[2:08:39] and watered I'm sorry in Eden and there
[2:08:43] he put the man whom he had formed and
[2:08:46] out of the ground made the Lord God to
[2:08:48] grow every tree that is Pleasant to the
[2:08:50] sight and good for food the tree of life
[2:08:53] also
[2:08:54] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[2:08:57] of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[2:09:05] ten and a river went out of Eden to
[2:09:08] water the garden and from fence it was
[2:09:11] parted
[2:09:12] and became into four heads
[2:09:17] the name of the first is pishon
[2:09:20] that is it which compasses the whole
[2:09:23] land of havilah where there is gold
[2:09:27] and the gold of that land is good
[2:09:30] there's bedellium and the Onyx Stone
[2:09:32] the name of the second river is gihon
[2:09:35] the same is it that compasseth the whole
[2:09:39] land of Ethiopia
[2:09:41] and the name of the third river is
[2:09:43] hideko
[2:09:45] sometimes called Tigris that is it which
[2:09:49] goeth toward the east of Assyria and the
[2:09:52] fourth river is Euphrates
[2:09:56] now I would just like to point out to
[2:09:59] you these four
[2:10:01] tributaries from the one River
[2:10:04] it all originated from the Throne of God
[2:10:10] we see in the
[2:10:14] World in Eden
[2:10:17] the garden that God made it was another
[2:10:21] symbolism of what was in Heavenly places
[2:10:26] and the water issuing out of this one
[2:10:30] River and then it parted into four
[2:10:34] tributaries and I would like to call it
[2:10:37] the ankles the knees the loins and
[2:10:41] Waters to swim in
[2:10:43] the the word Pichon means increase
[2:10:48] that's pretty good
[2:10:52] and it is from the world from uh
[2:10:54] Strong's number 6335 meaning to spread
[2:10:58] to grow up
[2:11:00] to grow fat
[2:11:02] or scattered
[2:11:05] then we have the river gihon
[2:11:08] meaning to burst forth or to Break Forth
[2:11:13] then we have the river hideko
[2:11:16] or Tigris meaning rapid
[2:11:20] and the last one Euphrates meaning
[2:11:24] fruitfulness now I find it
[2:11:27] interesting that when you look at the
[2:11:30] word Euphrates
[2:11:32] in the Hebrew the Hebrew transliteration
[2:11:36] is not anywhere near to Euphrates it's
[2:11:40] perath
[2:11:42] meaning to break forth or rushing
[2:11:47] in this water that is coming through the
[2:11:51] land of Eden and coming from the Throne
[2:11:54] of God we have increase we have
[2:11:58] spreading or growing up or growing fat
[2:12:01] we have breaking forth or bursting forth
[2:12:05] we have rapid and when I think of Rapid
[2:12:08] uh you know we we think if you if you
[2:12:12] get to thinking about Rapids you start
[2:12:15] thinking dangerous but here is where my
[2:12:18] mind went when I begin to think about
[2:12:20] rapid we have had prophecy after
[2:12:22] prophecy in this house about
[2:12:25] acceleration and that is what we've
[2:12:28] looked for it for years friends and the
[2:12:31] word of God standeth Shore he will not
[2:12:35] leave us well without a witness he will
[2:12:38] not leave us here to uh be filled with
[2:12:41] doubt but he will always have somebody
[2:12:44] who is going to hold on to a promise and
[2:12:47] say I'm going to see that fulfilled
[2:12:50] I'm going to see it fulfilled
[2:12:53] I'm looking for that this week I'm
[2:12:57] seeing it already that God is doing
[2:13:00] things speedily he's very be a before
[2:13:03] you can even ask here it is
[2:13:12] what if I don't ask
[2:13:15] you probably will
[2:13:18] now you probably will ask but I am
[2:13:22] looking for that time where the thought
[2:13:25] crosses my mind and as it's making my
[2:13:29] way to my lips and it's coming out of my
[2:13:32] mouth it is now a spoken word manifest
[2:13:36] in front of my eyes
[2:13:39] what is the theme of Cam meeting come
[2:13:42] and see
[2:13:43] come and see
[2:13:45] you doubt come and see
[2:13:49] amen you don't think it can happen come
[2:13:52] and see
[2:13:54] you come with your critical attitude I
[2:13:57] already asked you to leave it outside of
[2:13:59] the door and come planning to give a
[2:14:02] little overtime
[2:14:05] just a little overtime
[2:14:09] preacher you don't have any idea what
[2:14:10] I'm going to encounter before this week
[2:14:12] is out none of us do none of us have any
[2:14:16] idea what's going to what we're going to
[2:14:18] encounter before this week is out but
[2:14:21] every test that you have come into your
[2:14:23] pathway and into your visual it is
[2:14:26] because God has once again said you are
[2:14:30] here for the test and you are also the
[2:14:32] one who will walk away with the
[2:14:34] testimony
[2:14:40] I have one I have one or the other
[2:14:43] choice here
[2:14:46] I can be that one who comes under the
[2:14:48] test
[2:14:49] and I can resist the devil and he'll
[2:14:53] flee from me and I'll walk away with a
[2:14:56] testimony or I can be like some others
[2:14:59] and I will walk away just as doubting as
[2:15:03] I was when I came
[2:15:07] it's either Faith or doubt
[2:15:10] am I going to respond to the word of God
[2:15:14] am I going to respond to the worship
[2:15:17] am I going to press in with everything
[2:15:20] that's within me so that God can move
[2:15:24] Among Us well what if I don't get
[2:15:26] anything
[2:15:28] are you am I
[2:15:31] am I willing
[2:15:35] to work
[2:15:37] and to serve
[2:15:41] so that others
[2:15:43] can receive
[2:15:45] from the hand of God
[2:15:51] that's what musicians do
[2:15:54] that's what service leaders do worship
[2:15:56] leaders preachers audio video
[2:15:59] technicians you that are helping to cook
[2:16:02] all this food and make sure that the the
[2:16:04] guests are taking it's it's serving are
[2:16:08] you willing am I willing to serve and am
[2:16:11] I willing to give what I have and then
[2:16:14] after I feel like that I've exhausted
[2:16:17] myself to come in and give a little
[2:16:19] overtime say Lord here I am I'm willing
[2:16:23] to press in a little bit more because I
[2:16:26] am not satisfied to be up to my ankles I
[2:16:30] am not satisfied to beat just to my
[2:16:33] loins but I want the river of God to so
[2:16:37] consume me so envelop me because I
[2:16:42] realize that what is ushering out of the
[2:16:45] Throne of God my mind went to and
[2:16:47] brother Brandon was talking about that
[2:16:49] ocean he said you can take a cup full of
[2:16:52] that ocean water and in that ocean water
[2:16:55] are all of the chemicals of that entire
[2:16:58] ocean in that cup it's all the same
[2:17:00] chemical makeup even though you only
[2:17:03] have a cup and friends that is what God
[2:17:06] is doing for us and has done for us by
[2:17:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he
[2:17:11] poured out the Holy Ghost on the 120 in
[2:17:14] the upper room he wanted to let them
[2:17:17] know the power that was in Jesus Christ
[2:17:20] and raised him up from the dead was
[2:17:23] there to Quicken them
[2:17:28] there to Quicken them
[2:17:31] it wasn't just to make them feel good
[2:17:34] although it did
[2:17:37] it wasn't there just so they could walk
[2:17:39] away and say wow that was a powerful
[2:17:41] meeting
[2:17:42] oh
[2:17:44] because all of these things from glory
[2:17:47] to glory he's changing me
[2:17:51] his likeness and image he wants to
[2:17:55] perfect in me
[2:17:57] and if we will allow the river of God
[2:18:02] to flow from the Throne of God and flow
[2:18:07] into our lives
[2:18:10] we're not talking about this building
[2:18:16] we're going to call this building today
[2:18:18] an inanimate object
[2:18:21] one that when we are taken out of here
[2:18:25] and the Earth is cleansed this is going
[2:18:28] to be turned to ashes
[2:18:31] but you I we are of a different material
[2:18:36] we are of a different substance we are
[2:18:39] of the same substance of that that is
[2:18:42] Flowing out from the Throne of God the
[2:18:45] very same life the life that was in that
[2:18:48] blood cell that he gave that day at
[2:18:51] Calvary that life has come back to the
[2:18:53] believer and indwells us
[2:18:57] in such a way
[2:19:01] that we cry out for more
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:05] because we realize
[2:19:07] that there's more to be had
[2:19:11] I got my cup full
[2:19:13] but I want another cup full
[2:19:17] and then I want the gallon jug full
[2:19:20] and then I want the 55 gallon barrel
[2:19:23] full
[2:19:24] and then I want the ocean full I want
[2:19:27] all that I can get from my Lord because
[2:19:30] he is the inexhaustible fountain
[2:19:34] there you're not going to exhaust the
[2:19:37] the life that flows out of him because
[2:19:40] it's inexhaustible
[2:19:42] and it's for you
[2:19:46] now what if a man this is from the
[2:19:48] restoration of the Bride tree now what
[2:19:50] if a man is planted in such a thing as
[2:19:52] by the river
[2:19:54] where the Springs nine different Springs
[2:19:56] feeding into him oh my what an
[2:19:59] establishment he has and a man that's
[2:20:03] planted by the river the rivers of water
[2:20:05] one water one Spirit there are Gifts of
[2:20:08] healing Same Spirit
[2:20:10] Gifts of Prophecy same spirits
[2:20:14] Same Spirit but many gifts
[2:20:18] one Giver
[2:20:19] now David saw him and he was planted by
[2:20:22] this tree now he could not die now
[2:20:25] notice why he had life in his roots
[2:20:28] where is the roots or the life of the
[2:20:31] tree stays in the roots certainly comes
[2:20:34] up and bears its fruit all right now I
[2:20:36] do want to remind you of that stick that
[2:20:39] had no roots
[2:20:42] no roots
[2:20:44] but it got behind the veil
[2:20:48] it God embedded in the River of Life
[2:20:52] that was behind the veil Where the River
[2:20:55] of waters are flowing from there it was
[2:20:58] immersed and I don't understand why the
[2:21:00] other ones didn't bloom
[2:21:02] I can only go back to by his
[2:21:05] foreknowledge he did predestinate me to
[2:21:08] be conformed into His Image that's the
[2:21:11] only thing I can tell you because the
[2:21:13] Levites were predestinated to be
[2:21:15] conformed into the Earthly priesthood
[2:21:17] and I and you have been ordained to be
[2:21:21] transformed into the image of the Living
[2:21:25] God why is that because there's
[2:21:28] something that pulls us back to that
[2:21:30] living fountain in behind the veil David
[2:21:34] saw him and he was planted by this tree
[2:21:36] now I could not die notice why he had
[2:21:39] life in his roots where is the roots or
[2:21:41] the life of the tree stays in the roots
[2:21:43] certainly comes up and bears its fruit
[2:21:45] all right watch his roots had life in
[2:21:48] them
[2:21:49] to bring forth his fruit and season now
[2:21:52] remember this tree will not cast its
[2:21:54] fruit
[2:21:55] listen
[2:21:56] this tree will not cast its fruit now
[2:22:00] you take a tree and put it away from
[2:22:02] water
[2:22:04] the first thing you know
[2:22:06] you got little apples
[2:22:08] they're all naughty and warm eaten
[2:22:11] but it'll cast its crop
[2:22:14] that's what's the matter with the
[2:22:16] churches today
[2:22:18] you've done God away from the river
[2:22:20] got away from them gifts of the Spirit
[2:22:23] they got a church natural
[2:22:27] friends
[2:22:31] there's too many Church Naturals
[2:22:34] they just got church natural
[2:22:37] and they got away from spiritual gifts
[2:22:38] and the spiritual things and they cast
[2:22:40] their fruit
[2:22:42] what do they do their Believers live
[2:22:45] with the world act like the world steal
[2:22:48] cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble have bunco
[2:22:53] parties in the church to pay the
[2:22:55] preacher and everything else soup
[2:22:56] suppers and dances see they cast their
[2:22:58] fruits it's just like the world now
[2:23:02] see God didn't call us to be Baptist
[2:23:04] methodists episcopalians lutherans he
[2:23:07] didn't call us to be that
[2:23:08] he called us to operate under that
[2:23:11] Pentecostal blessing not the
[2:23:13] denominational Pentecostal bless I'm
[2:23:16] talking about our acts Pentecost that
[2:23:19] blessing that God called us to walk
[2:23:21] under that blessing and and this
[2:23:24] blessing is not just to be a blessing to
[2:23:27] us and we walk away and we forget it but
[2:23:30] we are to live by the rivers of Living
[2:23:33] Water where that we are constantly
[2:23:36] getting life but there are too many
[2:23:38] people who come and they stick their
[2:23:41] ankle in and then they pull it back out
[2:23:43] and they end up they end up stealing and
[2:23:47] cheating and lying and smoking and
[2:23:49] drinking and gambling and having bunco
[2:23:51] parties and gossiping and backbiting and
[2:23:53] having hatred and strife and anxieties
[2:23:56] and all of these things because we just
[2:23:58] keep coming and dipping our toe in the
[2:24:01] water rather than living in the Fountain
[2:24:05] of Living Water where there is bursting
[2:24:09] forth and there is acceleration and
[2:24:12] there's fruitfulness
[2:24:14] the river of God that is coming from the
[2:24:19] very River of God and brother Branham
[2:24:21] finishes this quote
[2:24:22] and the unbeliever looks and say
[2:24:25] there's no difference
[2:24:28] between that person and me
[2:24:34] now if all we're doing
[2:24:37] is we're coming and sticking Our Roots
[2:24:39] in
[2:24:40] and then we're pulling Our Roots out
[2:24:43] listen to me you parents
[2:24:46] you go from one Church to another and
[2:24:49] you put your children in and you take
[2:24:51] your children out
[2:24:52] you don't think it's necessary to be
[2:24:55] here every service your children are in
[2:24:56] and your children are out and you are
[2:24:58] too and your roots get dry and all of
[2:25:01] the sudden we have naughty wormy apples
[2:25:06] because the life is not there but oh
[2:25:11] my God if we could ever if we could ever
[2:25:15] get a past if we could ever get a past
[2:25:19] looking at one another
[2:25:22] we've been told over and over again
[2:25:24] three ways the three steps to get more
[2:25:27] like Jesus is to take your eyes off of
[2:25:30] people put them right on Jesus Take Your
[2:25:34] Eyes Off of people put them right on
[2:25:36] Jesus Take Your Eyes Off of people and
[2:25:39] put them right on Jesus I tell you
[2:25:42] friends we will see a difference in our
[2:25:44] lives we'll see it in this house and
[2:25:47] then it'll go outside of these four
[2:25:49] walls and it'll go outside of the normal
[2:25:51] spectrum that we're used to and we will
[2:25:54] see people's lives change because the
[2:25:56] unbelievers will no longer be looking at
[2:25:58] us and saying there's no difference
[2:26:00] between you and me
[2:26:02] you have the same problems that I have
[2:26:05] you have the same anxieties that I have
[2:26:07] you've had the same diseases that I have
[2:26:09] you backbiting gossip and you do all
[2:26:13] sorts of things you you go to parties
[2:26:15] and you drink just like I do you know
[2:26:18] there's no difference between you and me
[2:26:22] but if we ever fully immerse ourselves
[2:26:27] in that River
[2:26:29] there is something that will happen that
[2:26:34] will be so Supernatural for us and in us
[2:26:38] that we will no longer have the
[2:26:41] unbeliever saying there's no difference
[2:26:43] between you and me
[2:26:45] but the unbelievers will be then
[2:26:48] becoming insane what is that that you
[2:26:50] have
[2:26:52] what is that that you've got that calls
[2:26:55] I I mean I I can see that you're going
[2:26:57] through uh terrible health issue but I
[2:27:01] see such joy in you that is so
[2:27:04] overwhelming you that even though I know
[2:27:07] that you're fighting a battle in your
[2:27:09] physical body there's a Radiance about
[2:27:12] you that is so Supernatural I want to
[2:27:16] know what you have
[2:27:18] I want the musicians to come as I finish
[2:27:20] up today Joel chapter 2 verses 15

[2:27:43] the breasts let the bridegroom go forth
[2:27:46] of his chamber and the bride out of her
[2:27:49] closet let the priests the Ministers of
[2:27:52] the Lord weep between the porch and the
[2:27:55] Altar and let them say spare thy people
[2:27:58] O Lord and give not thine Heritage to
[2:28:01] reproach that the
[2:28:03] Fetters the Heathen sorry should rule
[2:28:06] over them wherefore should they say
[2:28:09] among the people
[2:28:10] where
[2:28:12] is there God
[2:28:14] then will the Lord be jealous for his
[2:28:17] land and pity his people
[2:28:22] yea the Lord will answer and say unto
[2:28:26] his people behold I will send you corn
[2:28:29] and wine and oil and you shall be
[2:28:32] satisfied therewith and I will know more
[2:28:36] make you a reproach among the Heathen
[2:28:38] but I will remove far off from you the
[2:28:42] northern Army and will drive him into a
[2:28:45] land Barren and desolate

[2:28:51] and his hinder parked toward the utmost
[2:28:53] sea and his stink shall come up and his

[2:31:28] very innermost part of the tree
[2:31:31] but I will restore to you the years that

[2:43:36] we rejoice
[2:43:38] [Music]
[2:43:45] some of us are going to have to let go
[2:43:47] of a phrase
[2:43:48] that we like to use often
[2:43:51] it's not fair
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:43:58] it's not fair
[2:44:01] it's not fair
[2:44:04] ask the Holy Spirit to
[2:44:07] help you to eliminate that phrase from
[2:44:09] your vocabulary
[2:44:12] you know why I'm saying that
[2:44:15] because the canker worm
[2:44:17] and the Palmer worm
[2:44:19] the caterpillar
[2:44:21] that great Army
[2:44:24] it was one that he sent
[2:44:27] he sent it
[2:44:32] he said it
[2:44:36] so when we say it's not fair
[2:44:40] we're really saying Lord I despise this
[2:44:42] Army
[2:44:49] remember
[2:44:51] he despised the shame
[2:44:55] but for the joy that was set before him
[2:45:00] who was the joy
[2:45:02] you
[2:45:04] me and in order for this joy that was
[2:45:07] set before him to come to completion he
[2:45:11] had to send this great Army
[2:45:14] to bring about the completion in US
[2:45:17] so we need to just get rid of it's not
[2:45:20] fair
[2:45:21] and say Lord all that that's come
[2:45:26] hearts that I allowed in my life
[2:45:30] because of my discouragement and My Hope
[2:45:34] deferred and then I embrace the next
[2:45:37] stage of that bug that insect but it was
[2:45:40] all a part of God dealing with me
[2:45:43] because he did not want me to tap in to
[2:45:47] a broken cistern but he wanted me to be
[2:45:51] connected to the river of Living Water
[2:45:55] the one that ushers forth from the
[2:45:59] Throne of God
[2:46:01] press in with everything that's within
[2:46:04] you friends and let's watch God move not
[2:46:08] Tuesday night but from this day forward
[2:46:11] we'll watch him move I've given you
[2:46:15] everything I've got
[2:46:16] [Laughter]
[2:46:20] a hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:46:22] hallelujah
[2:46:24] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[2:46:27] thank you Jesus
[2:46:29] thank you Jesus
[2:46:31] thank you Jesus
[2:46:33] I think some of you came around the
[2:46:35] Altar and maybe you wanted to moan or
[2:46:38] groan a little bit or cry and
[2:46:40] intercession a little bit but I want you
[2:46:41] to understand that bridal bridal
[2:46:44] repentance may not look like what we
[2:46:47] have expected or thought in the past but
[2:46:49] what you need to catch a hold of right
[2:46:51] now is this last some of the last things
[2:46:53] that brother Greely was saying this
[2:46:56] throwing the rock in the air or doing
[2:46:58] something a little different than what
[2:47:00] you've been doing you know it's Insanity
[2:47:02] to keep doing the same things that
[2:47:05] you've always done expecting to get
[2:47:08] something different
[2:47:09] if you always do what you've always done
[2:47:11] you'll always be what you've always been
[2:47:14] but we have an opportunity and so we
[2:47:17] start off with a song that almost sounds
[2:47:19] like it doesn't fit the moment
[2:47:23] but it actually did fit the moment
[2:47:28] it was a little bit of it was a little
[2:47:30] bit of a whiplash for you but it really
[2:47:32] does fit the moment because God is
[2:47:35] giving us this opportunity to do
[2:47:37] something a little different than what
[2:47:39] we would normally do and see if he will
[2:47:42] do something a little different if he
[2:47:44] will meet us a little different and then
[2:47:46] what when brother Greely was talking
[2:47:48] about we have to be careful about this
[2:47:50] life isn't fair because we're really
[2:47:52] despising the army that God sins well
[2:47:54] let me tell you what what the Army looks
[2:47:57] like
[2:47:58] let me describe the Army to you that
[2:48:01] Army has familiar faces
[2:48:05] that Army looks like your family
[2:48:08] that Army looks like your brothers and
[2:48:10] sisters in Christ
[2:48:11] that Army looks like people you work
[2:48:13] with
[2:48:15] it looks like people you know that
[2:48:17] you've been familiar with and it looks
[2:48:20] like we we often say well the enemy is
[2:48:22] is using them and the devil is doing
[2:48:24] this and a bad spirit is doing the other
[2:48:26] and the devil's got a hold of them come
[2:48:29] on what we need to realize sometime is
[2:48:32] God has harnessed them
[2:48:34] and he's using them as his army
[2:48:38] he's using them as His
[2:48:44] hit the strike against the hardness of
[2:48:46] our own hearts
[2:48:47] and to bring us to a place where we can
[2:48:49] worship him I want you to come back now
[2:48:52] that we have set the tone for the song I
[2:48:54] want you to come back and sing that and
[2:48:56] I want us to enter into the best of our
[2:48:59] ability for we have surely heard the
[2:49:01] word of the Lord today

[3:18:56] I got just what I needed
[3:19:00] [Music]
[3:19:03] he knew just what I needed so I got just
[3:19:07] what I needed
[3:19:10] [Music]
[3:19:14] oh
[3:19:16] [Music]
[3:19:19] I don't know
[3:19:21] but that old red and white
[3:19:24] sitting out there in the parking lot it
[3:19:26] might have got on me just then that all
[3:19:29] their memories
[3:19:31] Hallelujah well some have hoped that we
[3:19:36] would have a service underneath the tent
[3:19:40] and I know that would be lovely but God
[3:19:43] gave us this place
[3:19:45] he moved us from the Tabernacle here
[3:19:48] and we had a temporary dwelling place
[3:19:51] now we have a permanent Dwelling Place
[3:19:53] and we might sometime in the future have
[3:19:57] a series of meetings Under the Tent
[3:19:59] but I prayed just like I told them I
[3:20:02] would do and I don't want to discourage
[3:20:03] anybody but I prayed just like I told
[3:20:06] them that I would do and I felt like in
[3:20:08] my heart we did not want to interrupt
[3:20:11] what God is already doing
[3:20:13] there's an entirely different uh
[3:20:17] atmosphere when you're out in the open
[3:20:19] like that it's a tremendous amount of
[3:20:22] work and I know that a lot of you don't
[3:20:24] understand that and you think it's just
[3:20:26] Toten if we can just tote it out there
[3:20:28] and we we don't even have to worry about
[3:20:30] Toten because we've got plenty of toters
[3:20:34] it's not the toting that changes things
[3:20:36] it's all the work that goes into
[3:20:38] plugging it up and making it work and
[3:20:40] we're already having problems with two
[3:20:42] brand new microphones and so we don't
[3:20:45] want to go we don't want to go out there
[3:20:46] and then it's squeal and it holler and
[3:20:48] it cry
[3:20:49] and go through all of that and the
[3:20:51] streaming the people that are planning
[3:20:53] to stream we want that to be flawless
[3:20:56] they asked caulk and he said well sure
[3:20:58] we can stream out there but we can't
[3:20:59] guarantee that it would be Flawless and
[3:21:02] these people who cannot be here want to
[3:21:05] be here
[3:21:06] and the only way they can be here is
[3:21:08] through the streaming so please don't be
[3:21:10] disappointed with me I feel like the
[3:21:12] Lord settled it for me and when he did
[3:21:14] then I didn't have any other thought of
[3:21:16] it I just thought this is what we will
[3:21:18] do but God's going to move he's going to
[3:21:20] move
[3:21:21] and you're not going to want to miss it
[3:21:23] amen so you be here
[3:21:25] we have this kind of a meeting once a
[3:21:28] year
[3:21:29] and you say well I didn't know when it
[3:21:31] was yes you did
[3:21:33] yes you did you can never use that
[3:21:35] excuse
[3:21:36] because it's Tabernacles week
[3:21:39] it's been Tabernacles week now for the
[3:21:41] last few years
[3:21:42] it'll be Tabernacles week next year
[3:21:45] October 3rd through the 8th
[3:21:48] it might fluctuate between September and
[3:21:50] October but it's real easy to Google
[3:21:52] when Tabernacles is that's a good time
[3:21:55] to take a knot off work if you can but
[3:21:58] you have to go ahead you have to plan
[3:21:59] ahead and get that done and that's why
[3:22:01] we announce it far in advance I know
[3:22:04] some of you will be tired you will come
[3:22:06] in here tired like brother Greeley said
[3:22:08] but I believe God will meet you here
[3:22:12] when the Holy Ghost fell in Blue Springs
[3:22:14] and my grandmother was sharecropping and
[3:22:18] her husband died and left her with 15
[3:22:20] children
[3:22:21] she would work all day in the field
[3:22:24] she would plow the field Like a Man
[3:22:26] Behind The Mule and she would carry a
[3:22:29] hundred pound sacks of Guyana fertilizer
[3:22:31] to the field and distributed herself and
[3:22:34] never missed a service when the spirit
[3:22:36] of God was moving when they called
[3:22:38] meetings she was there and they said
[3:22:41] sometimes she would come in 10 minutes
[3:22:43] late and she still had dirt on her
[3:22:46] forehead and she'd be wiping the wispy
[3:22:49] hairs out of her eyes and she would drag
[3:22:51] to the Pew in the church people would
[3:22:53] feel so sorry for her because they knew
[3:22:56] how hard she had worked that day in the
[3:22:58] field in the hot Alabama Sun
[3:23:01] but they said that when she would get to
[3:23:03] her Pew sometimes she'd sit down bow her
[3:23:06] head and pray a little prayer and when
[3:23:08] she come up this was my
[3:23:09] great-grandmother and when she would
[3:23:11] come up she'd come up with the light of
[3:23:13] the Lord on her face she'd come up with
[3:23:15] her hands in the air she danced more
[3:23:17] than anybody shouted more than anybody
[3:23:19] hollered Hallelujah more than any
[3:23:22] one they said Not only did God give her
[3:23:25] that recharge but she'd get up the next
[3:23:27] morning refreshed and go and do it all
[3:23:30] over again now listen God can help us
[3:23:32] we may have eaten a whole lot more
[3:23:34] hybrid food than my great-grandmother
[3:23:36] did but he can strengthen us if we'll
[3:23:39] let him if you start getting this
[3:23:41] mentality I heard someone say this week
[3:23:43] I'm going to stop saying I'm going to
[3:23:46] stop confessing that I'm getting old I'm
[3:23:49] going to quit confessing that I think we
[3:23:51] should
[3:23:53] because if you convince yourself I know
[3:23:55] it's a reality out there I'm not a dummy
[3:23:57] but if you convince yourself of that
[3:24:00] then you'll start claiming things
[3:24:04] you'll start acting like it
[3:24:09] Felix was here and
[3:24:12] he was singing Happy Birthday in Publix
[3:24:14] to a 90 year old woman
[3:24:16] said it was her birthday and he told her
[3:24:19] I don't know that boy
[3:24:21] but he told her he said at this rate
[3:24:22] you're going to outlive the queen
[3:24:25] not planning that's
[3:24:26] [Music]
[3:24:32] have a plan
[3:24:33] not to let these things hinder us
[3:24:37] don't look in the mirror and start
[3:24:39] expecting it to get worse every day
[3:24:42] we're so close to The Blessing of
[3:24:43] Abraham now
[3:24:46] come on till you might look in the
[3:24:47] mirror and say hey
[3:24:53] I'm looking a little better and I've
[3:24:55] been looking
[3:24:56] look what God's doing
[3:24:58] you believe he can do it
[3:25:00] I know he can
[3:25:02] amen goodbye to the streamers
[3:25:04] we love you thank you for being with us
[3:25:07] we're going to go
