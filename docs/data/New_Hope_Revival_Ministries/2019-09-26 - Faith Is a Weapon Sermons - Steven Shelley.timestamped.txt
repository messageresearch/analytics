[0:06] Jesus received a change of clothes
[0:10] delayed aside but laureate shared with
[0:17] the father it's at the appearing of the
[0:21] Lord Jesus Christ it's your faith that
[0:24] has been tried by the fire would be
[0:27] worthy of the well done he chooses to
[0:32] see what he saw about me
[0:35] that's mercy my love his grace take your
[0:40] place and take it now your family is at
[0:46] stake it's never too late for a man of
[0:52] integrity to go before God on behalf of
[0:57] his children
[0:59] [Music]
[1:12] [Music]
[1:18] well this verse of scripture some of you
[1:22] could quote for though we walk in the
[1:24] flesh this is 2nd Corinthians 10 verses
[1:27] three through five for though we walk in
[1:30] the flesh we do not war after the flesh
[1:35] there's a warfare going on that is
[1:38] bigger than our flesh it's bigger than
[1:41] who we are as individuals a man for the
[1:44] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[1:47] they are not natural somebody say
[1:50] natural that they're just not natural
[1:53] but they are mighty through God
[1:56] our weapons are mighty through God to
[2:01] the pulling down of strongholds and we
[2:05] understand what those strongholds can be
[2:08] and they vary in different individuals
[2:10] lives casting down imaginations and
[2:13] every high thing that exalteth itself
[2:19] against the knowledge of God and
[2:22] bringing into captivity every fault
[2:27] how many thoughts every thought that's a
[2:32] lot of work how many of you have a lot
[2:35] of thoughts every day it's a lot of work
[2:38] but the Bible said we have to bring
[2:40] every one of those thoughts to obedience
[2:44] we bring them into captivity every
[2:47] thought to the obedience of Christ
[2:51] it's a powerful job but it's a gift to
[2:55] us to be able to do that
[2:57] let me read one more portion to you in
[3:00] Hebrews chapter 11 if you turn there and
[3:04] we're going to read again these are
[3:06] verses you could quote Hebrews 11:1 and
[3:10] 2 now faith is the substance of things
[3:15] hoped for the evidence of things huh not
[3:25] seen
[3:27] if you can see it it doesn't require
[3:32] faith to touch it you just reach out and
[3:36] touch it but if you can't see it if it
[3:41] exists but not in this realm of the seen
[3:46] se e in the realm of the carnal the
[3:51] realm of the natural the realm of the
[3:53] flesh but you know it's there because
[3:56] God's Word said so so you don't access
[4:00] it with your eyes you don't access it
[4:03] with your hands you access it with your
[4:06] faith and without faith what does the
[4:11] scripture say without faith it is
[4:16] impossible to please God
[4:18] we've got faith every one of us have
[4:21] faith it's given to us as a gift but
[4:23] we've got to learn to exercise it amen
[4:26] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[4:28] this morning that you are alive and well
[4:31] in our lives we thank you this morning
[4:34] that you are God's sovereign and you are
[4:37] God's supreme and besides you there is
[4:41] no other God we thank you for your
[4:44] presence that has been here this morning
[4:46] as we worshipped you and we sang of your
[4:50] holiness and your worthiness and there
[4:53] was an atmosphere that began to crowd in
[4:57] on us as we were worshiping you Lord and
[5:00] and may we just say it's worth the
[5:04] effort it's it's worth a little using
[5:07] our voice and the little lifting of our
[5:09] hand and a little bit of of pushing
[5:12] through some stuff to be able to create
[5:14] an atmosphere where your presence can
[5:17] land as Hawk was praying this morning
[5:19] and so Lord we're thankful we're
[5:21] thankful for what you've done on our
[5:23] behalf we sung about that ugly cross the
[5:27] ugly death on the cross but it was the
[5:30] most beautiful thing that's ever been
[5:32] done for another human being you did it
[5:35] for us because you
[5:37] and now Lord we need your word because
[5:40] it's life to us it is strength to us and
[5:43] it is a part of our unseen arsenal those
[5:47] weapons of warfare that are not carnal
[5:50] but rather spiritual and so we need that
[5:53] word to speak to us today and it is
[5:56] anointed already to do so give us ears
[5:59] to hear and may you anoint the gift Lord
[6:02] that your word might go forth in power
[6:05] and that it might scatter the darkness
[6:08] and will give you praise and honor and
[6:10] glory for it's in the name of the Lord
[6:12] Jesus Christ we pray and the church said
[6:15] Amen you may be seated this morning I
[6:19] love something well several things I I
[6:23] know I'm supposed to be praying but I
[6:25] was but I was also listening to Hawks
[6:28] prayer and several of the things he said
[6:31] inspired me and one of the things that
[6:34] he said that was somewhat confirmation
[6:36] to me is he mentioned the fact that our
[6:39] God is a super natural God would you say
[6:45] that with me right now
[6:46] our God is a super natural God don't try
[6:50] to make him natural don't try to make
[6:54] him natural and don't try to make him
[6:56] like any other God you've ever heard of
[6:59] because all the gods of Mythology are
[7:02] myths they don't exist and they never
[7:05] did exist they were formed and created
[7:08] for man to try to explain what God had
[7:12] created and so they made deities out of
[7:16] God's creation and I want you to know
[7:19] that science is not evil but science can
[7:23] be wrong
[7:24] you know our science can be wrong
[7:26] because it is based on man's
[7:29] experimentation and reading the results
[7:34] of his experiment and you build upon the
[7:37] next and you build upon the next and you
[7:39] build upon the next and that's why we
[7:42] have science today saying something
[7:45] entirely different about many things
[7:47] then it said 10 years ago
[7:50] and it wasn't just building on something
[7:52] but we find out that actually it
[7:54] replaced something and we've talked
[7:57] about neuroplasticity we've talked about
[7:59] the brain's ability to rewire and
[8:02] recreate itself and just a few years ago
[8:05] science said that you're you live and
[8:09] die with the brain you were born with
[8:11] but now science a knows better and they
[8:14] know that we have the ability through
[8:16] our thoughts and through healthy habits
[8:19] to rewire our brain and to even we now
[8:24] know that we can even see new healthy
[8:28] brain cells created in our brain and
[8:31] these are things that were mocked twenty
[8:34] years ago made fun of so science is
[8:37] evolving because it's based on the
[8:40] experimentation of the past
[8:42] it's man's desire to understand
[8:45] something bigger than he is and so
[8:49] science is not evil but it can be wrong
[8:52] because it is based on the natural realm
[8:55] how many of you know there's another
[8:57] realm there's another reality this
[9:01] morning and it is that God who is a
[9:04] super natural God our God is a
[9:09] supernatural God we fail so many times
[9:14] in trying to explain him to someone else
[9:17] because all we have to do that with is
[9:20] natural language and how many of you
[9:22] know that natural language flesh
[9:25] language often Falls very very short of
[9:29] really expressing who God is because
[9:33] he's supernatural now how many of you
[9:36] know what supernatural means well in its
[9:39] very basic definition it means to go
[9:44] above and beyond the natural if
[9:50] something goes above and beyond what can
[9:54] be accomplished or understood in the
[9:57] natural it is considered
[10:00] super natural and there is a
[10:02] supernatural realm and it's not very far
[10:06] from any of us this morning if you
[10:08] believe that same n it's a parallel
[10:11] dimension
[10:12] oh that sounds kind of weird doesn't it
[10:16] but but what that means is is in this
[10:19] room it is possible to move in the
[10:23] natural realm and also see the unseen
[10:26] realm the spiritual realm the
[10:29] supernatural realm at the same time in
[10:32] fact you can be standing beside someone
[10:34] who is using their five senses to touch
[10:38] their natural realm and you may have
[10:42] someone on the other side of you who is
[10:44] using their faith at that same moment
[10:46] and they're touching an entirely
[10:48] different reality so many times in our
[10:54] life just stay with me through this
[10:56] foundation even though it's 101 for Holy
[10:59] Ghost fill Christians so many times in
[11:03] our Christian life we learn we hear
[11:07] about that supernatural realm and we
[11:09] know the access is granted to us but we
[11:12] continue to read our environment and to
[11:15] read our circumstances by what we see
[11:18] with natural eyes how many of you know
[11:21] you'll come up short
[11:22] I'm telling you life will disappoint you
[11:25] have you ever been disappointed by life
[11:27] there are many things that happen in the
[11:29] natural stay here many things that
[11:32] happen in the natural realm that will
[11:34] disappoint us and our emotions will most
[11:38] likely reflect what's going on in the
[11:41] natural realm but God is not a natural
[11:44] God God is a super natural God he is
[11:49] above and beyond all that we can
[11:53] understand with the natural mind the
[11:56] natural mind will never comprehend the
[11:59] fullness of the sovereignty and
[12:01] greatness of God but God gives you
[12:04] another sense
[12:06] he gives us another sense faith is the
[12:10] sixth sense
[12:12] faith is the sixth sense really it's an
[12:16] entirely different set of senses it's a
[12:19] spiritual sense it's a gift that God
[12:22] gives you to access and touch the
[12:25] reality of the supernatural your five
[12:28] senses give you the ability to touch
[12:32] your natural environment faith gives you
[12:35] the ability to touch a supernatural
[12:38] environment you serve a supernatural God
[12:46] we're just gonna move slow here in just
[12:48] a moment and that supernatural God has
[12:52] made a way to get from heaven I can hear
[12:57] the old song that they used to sing when
[13:00] I was a boy he came a long long way from
[13:03] heaven he did he came a long long way
[13:07] from heaven and he provided a way to put
[13:12] a portion of that supernatural God and
[13:17] his supernatural life in your mortal
[13:22] body think about that eternal life is
[13:27] God's life it's zowie life in the Greek
[13:31] I think someone was preaching here
[13:33] recently and since it was it was a hawk
[13:36] and said something about Zoe what a good
[13:38] name she has because it's a Greek word
[13:40] for this other kind of life eternal life
[13:44] God life and whether we feel it or
[13:47] whether we can grasp it or whether we
[13:52] can explain it if you're born again of
[13:56] the Spirit of God that supernatural life
[14:00] that eternal life that Jesus Christ life
[14:06] is living inside of you and if he's not
[14:09] living inside of you it's very simple
[14:11] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ confess
[14:15] with your mouth that you're a sinner and
[14:17] you need to be saved and be baptized in
[14:21] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[14:23] Christ and the
[14:25] massive acts 2:38 is you shall receive
[14:28] the gift of the Holy Ghost that's a
[14:31] powerful promise and what that gift of
[14:34] the Holy Ghost is it's a transfer
[14:37] it's a deposit of God's eternal
[14:40] supernatural life in you so when you're
[14:45] walking around you're living a natural
[14:48] life but you're not existing by natural
[14:52] life you are existing by supernatural
[14:55] life hmm one day your natural life is
[14:59] going to end and if you're born again of
[15:02] the Spirit of God that part of you that
[15:05] cannot die did you know that the human
[15:09] soul and spirit that has been
[15:13] transformed and renewed by the eternal
[15:16] life of Jesus Christ cannot die that
[15:20] soul can never die that spirit of course
[15:23] can never die that's what keeps the soul
[15:24] alive the spirit can never die but the
[15:27] Bible says the soul that sinneth shall
[15:31] surely die that's pretty serious isn't
[15:34] it so there is no eternal life anywhere
[15:38] else not even in hell I believe in Hell
[15:44] I believe in a literal hell I believe in
[15:47] a burning hell but I don't believe in an
[15:49] eternal hell pretty heavy huh because in
[15:54] order to have an eternal hell you'd have
[15:57] to have an eternal life to live and be
[16:00] tormented eternally in that hell and we
[16:03] don't know how long that exists but we
[16:06] know that one day the soul that sinneth
[16:07] shall cease to exist but the soul that
[16:10] has been reborn by the Spirit of Jesus
[16:12] Christ will never die we used to sing
[16:16] decadence land I'm on my way we're the
[16:18] soul of man shall never die that may not
[16:22] matter to you now but it'll matter to
[16:24] you over there come on now as soon as
[16:28] this life is over your it's gonna matter
[16:31] to you whether you have eternal life or
[16:33] not loving God would never send
[16:36] sold the hell you're exactly right but
[16:39] in God's design people die every day and
[16:42] go to hell because they're not born
[16:45] again and how is that it's by a choice
[16:49] they made a choice you've made a choice
[16:52] here this morning you chose to be here
[16:55] you chose which tie to wear or what
[16:57] shoes to put on you you girls and
[17:00] sisters decided what how you were gonna
[17:02] do your hair up or down or bow dried or
[17:04] curled or primped or or straining my
[17:08] goodness no wonder you're late you got a
[17:14] lot to do to look like you look a man I
[17:17] could say some of you didn't take enough
[17:20] time but that'd be terrible that'd be an
[17:23] insulting joke you look beautiful
[17:26] I'm gonna be like sister Flo this
[17:27] morning you look beautiful this morning
[17:30] and you do you do you do look beautiful
[17:34] because you made a decision to come to
[17:36] be in the presence of the Lord one day
[17:39] you made a decision to be born again and
[17:41] in that decision you decided that you
[17:45] were going to be forever connected to a
[17:47] supernatural God and to a supernatural
[17:51] reality and a supernatural realm that is
[17:56] so contrary at times to the realm we
[17:59] live in right now in the natural in the
[18:03] natural sometimes it looks like there is
[18:05] no hope nothing will ever make a
[18:11] difference I will always feel like I
[18:15] feel right now there will never be a
[18:18] solution for this problem that I have I
[18:21] could go on and on and on and on and on
[18:23] we see those kinds of problems around us
[18:26] in our own lives things that we just
[18:29] feel like we'll never be any different
[18:31] but I want you to know one moment poking
[18:36] your head up above the natural and
[18:39] choosing to see to access the
[18:42] supernatural with the gift of faith the
[18:45] sixth sense to choose
[18:48] to say wait a minute it looks like in
[18:51] the natural it sounds like in the
[18:54] natural it feels like in the natural
[18:56] that nothing will ever change but it
[18:59] will always be as dark as it is right
[19:01] now or I'll hurt like a hurt right now
[19:04] or my family will be a mess like they
[19:07] are right now or my baby will never
[19:10] sleep through the night come on Emily
[19:13] better get in there you better start
[19:16] accessing that supernatural realm we've
[19:19] just come from brother Darrin and sister
[19:21] Rebecca who are younger than we are but
[19:24] have already raised a family and now are
[19:26] starting over with this foster child a
[19:29] little baby they got it when it was just
[19:31] a couple weeks old and he's growing
[19:33] gideon's growing like a weed and they're
[19:36] dealing again with things that they'll
[19:40] soon be dealing with with grandchildren
[19:41] and now they're dealing with it again
[19:44] and I'm listening to him and I'm
[19:45] thinking thank you lord thank you Lord
[19:49] that all of that is for our part for now
[19:52] at least it's over with and and we can
[19:56] we can send them home some of the
[19:59] adopted ones we have we can send them
[20:01] home when the grandchildren come we
[20:03] won't probably won't want to send them
[20:05] home you know how that works but it
[20:08] looks like things will never be
[20:09] different the baby will never sleep
[20:11] through the night and you'll never get a
[20:14] raise or whatever the situation is but
[20:17] just a few moments of making a conscious
[20:20] decision you had to make one in the
[20:21] beginning to be born again to choose
[20:24] Christ to choose the way of the Cross to
[20:28] choose forgiveness of sin and the blood
[20:31] of Jesus to wash away your iniquities
[20:33] you made a choice and in that same
[20:36] manner we have to make a choice on a
[20:38] fairly regular basis to put our heads up
[20:41] above the natural environment and our
[20:43] circumstances of life and see another
[20:46] realm I want you to know the reality of
[20:49] the supernatural realm is the real deal
[20:52] that spiritual dimension
[20:55] the real deal as we've said so many
[20:57] times the Prophet told us that this that
[21:00] we look around and see is the negative
[21:04] but somewhere there is a positive the
[21:08] light strikes the positive and the
[21:11] negative is formed and so we try to
[21:14] engage with the positive by looking at
[21:19] the negative but how many of you know
[21:21] the negative is reversed you can't base
[21:27] your life on the negative unless you've
[21:30] got enough God's sense to turn the
[21:33] negative around because when the Holy
[21:36] Spirit pours the developing fluid on the
[21:40] negative and a print is made everything
[21:44] that isn't backwards is now right-side
[21:46] up and you are now you're not getting
[21:49] the real but you're getting a picture of
[21:53] what the real is like as pretty powerful
[21:57] illustration isn't it well God's not
[21:59] just giving us a picture he did that
[22:01] that's what the Bible is the Bible is a
[22:04] picture of the real but you know there's
[22:07] something more real than the pages of
[22:09] the Bible because the pages of the Bible
[22:12] record a living world and that living
[22:15] word is a supernatural God and that
[22:17] living word is living inside of you by
[22:19] the new birth come on now and that
[22:23] living God living inside of you that
[22:25] giving you access to the supernatural
[22:27] realm gives you the blessing of being
[22:31] able to say now wait a minute I know
[22:32] what it looks like in the natural and
[22:36] I'm out I've run out of weapons to fight
[22:41] this thing in the natural but I'm
[22:43] realizing that this is really a
[22:45] spiritual battle that's going on and I'm
[22:48] gonna have to pull myself up out of the
[22:49] natural environment you understand right
[22:51] and begin to pick up the weapons of the
[22:54] other realm for the weapons of our
[22:56] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[22:58] through God to the pulling down of
[22:59] strongholds how many of your glad God
[23:02] didn't leave you here to fight a
[23:03] spiritual battle without a spiritual
[23:05] weapon
[23:05] your your spiritual weapon is your faith
[23:09] your faith is what pulls you above your
[23:13] natural environment and lets you live in
[23:16] the supernatural environment I want you
[23:18] to understand if you'll come back to me
[23:20] I want you to understand that as being a
[23:23] part of the elect we talked about that
[23:26] for three weeks for the elects sake you
[23:29] have been chosen to salvation your
[23:32] destiny is in Christ and Christ in you
[23:35] you in Christ and Christ the hope of
[23:38] glory formed in you that's the fullness
[23:41] of your destiny
[23:42] that's the stature of the perfect man
[23:44] that's the coming of the headstone
[23:47] that's what zechariah saw and screamed
[23:49] out in prophecy grace grace repeating
[23:54] what was being heard in the spirit and
[23:55] it's going to take grace grace to come
[23:59] all the way up to that honing in it is
[24:03] and we know that because we're living it
[24:05] and we're fighting it but i want you to
[24:07] understand this morning before we move
[24:09] on it's very very important that when we
[24:13] feel the heaviness of our natural
[24:16] environment that we use our faith
[24:18] weaponed and it'll help to pull
[24:22] ourselves up into that other realm oh my
[24:26] have you ever had a moment of awakening
[24:28] a Eureka moment where all of a sudden
[24:32] the thing you'd been looking at is so
[24:34] disastrous and hopeless but all of a
[24:37] sudden your spirit was stirred on the
[24:39] inside and you began to see it as God's
[24:41] potential and God's purpose and
[24:44] something bigger being formed for you
[24:46] and your future how many I'll tell you
[24:49] what how many of you have ever been
[24:50] riding down the road and someone pulls
[24:52] in front of you and and and and one
[24:54] thing right after another and you're
[24:56] getting later and later and later later
[24:58] and under more stress and under more
[25:00] stress and under more anxiety and you
[25:02] get up there to the to the crossroad and
[25:04] you realize that a terrible accidents
[25:05] just taking place and all of a sudden it
[25:08] doesn't matter that you're late who who
[25:10] cares
[25:11] what happened was you shifted your focus
[25:15] and you saw that perhaps your
[25:17] delay was part of God's plan sometimes
[25:23] delay can be part of God's plan because
[25:26] he's teaching us to look into that other
[25:29] realm hmm well we all know this good
[25:33] when we can learn to practice it will be
[25:35] supernatural people in that right how
[25:38] many of you know having a head knowledge
[25:40] of something is not enough it's got to
[25:42] become a reality and we've got to pull
[25:44] what we know in our head we've got to
[25:46] pull it down to the heart and let it
[25:48] filter through the soul and let our soul
[25:51] get ahold of it because our spirits
[25:54] already touched it but it's our mind our
[25:57] will and our emotions that wants us so
[26:00] many many times to lose that focus are
[26:04] you with me
[26:05] all right the realm of the supernatural
[26:08] is a realm beyond the reach of science
[26:13] it is beyond human explanation the word
[26:17] supernatural means above and beyond the
[26:21] natural this is the realm where God
[26:24] operates stay with me this is the realm
[26:27] where God operates he operates from wait
[26:33] a minute let me everybody get back here
[26:34] with me just a moment he operates from
[26:38] that other realm the realm of the
[26:40] supernatural and from that realm he has
[26:43] the power and the ability as a sovereign
[26:46] creator to shift things around in the
[26:49] natural how many of you would like to
[26:52] think about the fact that there is a
[26:54] supernatural reality but you don't have
[26:57] to get in that other realm to experience
[26:59] the fullness of what's taking place
[27:02] there we step into that realm with our
[27:06] faith we get a hold of that promise but
[27:09] until we leave this world we got to have
[27:11] some help over here in the natural right
[27:13] so what we do is we reach in and we pull
[27:16] that supernatural back to the natural
[27:20] realm does that sound too weird we do it
[27:22] with our faith you see in that other
[27:25] realm you're already healed
[27:28] you believe that your hole over there in
[27:33] that other realm your perfect boy that's
[27:37] hard to say
[27:38] we're perfect we're complete the
[27:42] finished work is finished in that other
[27:45] realm according to the scripture and but
[27:48] we're not living in that realm all the
[27:49] time because we are we're we're dual
[27:52] citizens living in two realms and two
[27:56] dimensions at the same time our faith is
[27:59] giving us access to the spiritual realm
[28:01] our senses are giving us access to the
[28:04] natural realm and sometimes we live by
[28:07] the natural senses instead of by the
[28:10] spiritual senses now what you know it
[28:12] looks overwhelming and depression
[28:15] thrives over here in the natural realm
[28:18] when faith refuses when you refuse to
[28:22] send your faith into God's reality is
[28:26] that too hard to get a hold of how do we
[28:29] get a glimpse if we don't see visions
[28:31] how do we get a glimpse of the reality
[28:35] of that other round by the Word of God
[28:37] the Word of God gives us a glimpse of
[28:40] what we can have when we use our faith
[28:42] to reach over again in that realm you
[28:44] are already healed depression is already
[28:48] gone everything you're fighting and
[28:50] struggling with in that realm it's
[28:52] already behind you so what you've got to
[28:56] do is take the reality of that truth and
[28:58] pull it right down and say I'm gonna
[29:00] live by that how many times do you have
[29:02] to do that how many of those thoughts do
[29:07] you have to bring into captivity and
[29:09] submit them to the media to cry every
[29:11] one of them how often are you gonna have
[29:14] to use your faith to access the reality
[29:16] of the supernatural around every day
[29:19] every day all day long when somebody
[29:24] says you sure do look sick you'd say
[29:26] well I may but with His stripes you
[29:31] could you could help me with his stripes
[29:35] I'm already healed anybody with me I
[29:39] hope so cuz I want to share some
[29:42] or in that realm in that supernatural
[29:46] realm heaven and earth intermingle it's
[29:50] the realm of interaction between God and
[29:52] man it's a faith realm or a supernatural
[29:55] realm and God wants his children to be
[29:58] able to move into that realm and take
[30:00] those promises back just like John in
[30:02] Revelation 4:1
[30:04] when he was invited to come up through
[30:06] an open door into the things of the
[30:07] Spirit everyone is not going to have
[30:10] that kind of experience in their life
[30:11] but I tell you what you will do and what
[30:14] you can do you can send your faith over
[30:16] into that realm and say I believe what
[30:20] God's Word said I believe that more than
[30:22] I believe what I see and feel and since
[30:25] with my own with my own sensors with my
[30:28] own ability now let me give you some
[30:29] some quotes from the message of the hour
[30:31] because I think they'll be a blessing to
[30:33] you and in order for that to happen
[30:35] you've got to really listen and pull a
[30:38] little bit in a message called faith he
[30:41] said jesus said these things that I do
[30:43] shall you do also then in God's then in
[30:47] excuse me then is God sworn covenant
[30:50] true Jesus is here this is the man of
[30:54] God Jesus is here his spirit is here
[30:57] could we say the same thing about this
[30:59] morning sure II can because we brought
[31:02] him with us when we came we serve a
[31:07] supernatural God we carry a deposit of
[31:10] that supernatural God by eternal life
[31:12] inside of us wherever you go your
[31:16] natural life goes and your spirit life
[31:18] goes God goes with you if you're born
[31:21] again of the Spirit of God and so we can
[31:24] say with full confidence Jesus is here
[31:30] we don't see him oh yes we do but not
[31:35] with our natural eyes because in order
[31:38] for us to see him in our natural eyes he
[31:40] would have to be walking among us in a
[31:41] corporal body his earthly body his body
[31:44] of flesh he's not doing that but on the
[31:47] day of Pentecost the very same spirit
[31:49] that was in Jesus fell on the believers
[31:52] so that spirit is in a
[31:54] and we can see him among us not with
[31:58] these eyes but with the other set the
[32:01] faith eyes the spirit eyes we can sense
[32:05] him and feel him as we worship the Lord
[32:08] this morning his presence was real as we
[32:12] prayed over the need his presence was
[32:14] real we shouldn't be surprised he's here
[32:17] he's here all right he goes on to say
[32:21] what happened just now he was moving in
[32:25] and out in this message that he gave us
[32:27] he said I I went into another world
[32:31] it's an unseen world it sounds all
[32:34] mysterious doesn't it sometime it's
[32:37] because we we haven't taken enough time
[32:39] to try to digest it it's not really so
[32:43] mystical at all it's a reality that we
[32:47] got to get a hold of if we're gonna
[32:49] fight the good fight in the last days at
[32:51] any time and any moment that you want to
[32:55] touch that dimension you have the gift
[32:58] of faith to do that you believe that how
[33:03] many of you believe you have faith if
[33:05] you don't God words--all I see because
[33:08] God's Word said to every man that's a
[33:12] human to every man is given a measure of
[33:15] faith to every man is given the measure
[33:17] of faith you've got it and your faith
[33:20] grows by exercising it and by using it
[33:23] every one of us can choose to exercise
[33:27] faith instead of the opposite which is
[33:33] fear and doubt he said it's an unseen
[33:38] world
[33:38] he said we become so conscious of
[33:40] looking at one another like this in the
[33:42] natural but there is an unseen world
[33:44] it's greater than anything you can see
[33:46] with the natural eye and bears Christ he
[33:51] said in this world in this world in this
[33:54] building here now this was a good many
[33:57] years ago but it's still the truth today
[33:59] there are evil spirits at war I know
[34:04] some people don't believe in that
[34:06] because they're they're too focused on
[34:08] the
[34:08] realm but I want you to know just as
[34:11] real as what you and I experienced over
[34:13] here there is another dimension and
[34:15] angels and demons are just as real as
[34:18] you are sitting here this morning and
[34:19] this is not to give you Spooky's or to
[34:22] make you feel all weird it's to help you
[34:24] understand that sometimes you don't
[34:26] understand the battle because you're
[34:28] trying to figure it out as though it was
[34:30] a battle of the flesh and it's really a
[34:32] battle of spirit but don't despair
[34:35] because you've been given every weapon
[34:38] you need to fight a battle in either
[34:40] realm in that good news you can win this
[34:44] thing he said in this building here are
[34:47] evil spirits and war and Christians
[34:50] anointed praise God and the angels of
[34:55] God encamped about them listen to this
[35:00] you know does he mind no the rest of
[35:02] this quotation it's been used a lot he
[35:05] said in the angels of God are encamped
[35:07] around them about them trying to
[35:12] energize their faith did you know that
[35:17] one of the ministries of angels you
[35:20] believe in angels and closing my eyes
[35:23] you believe in angels well they're real
[35:25] whether you believe in them or not so I
[35:28] said well I've never seen one doesn't
[35:29] matter it's actually a little rare to
[35:33] see them with the natural eye can be
[35:35] done can happen they have the ability to
[35:38] step from the unseen realm into the
[35:40] realm of the natural they can be
[35:42] manifested they were in the days of the
[35:43] Bible they were a generation ago and
[35:46] they have been in our day I believe in
[35:51] angels but even if you've never seen an
[35:55] angel it doesn't mean they don't exist
[35:57] and it doesn't mean that they don't work
[35:59] pretty hard to keep you going
[36:01] some of you give them a hard time some
[36:04] of you keep them busy
[36:05] some of you drive too fast not just
[36:10] women either you keep the angels busy
[36:14] trying to protect you and your
[36:15] foolishness but thank God we got them
[36:18] and although we used to joke about him
[36:21] getting out when you get over 70
[36:22] an hour how many of you know I'm glad
[36:24] they don't even when I'm not doing what
[36:27] I'm supposed to do
[36:28] I've still got a purpose to finish for
[36:30] God and he's taking care of me one day
[36:33] my purpose is gonna be over maybe
[36:34] tomorrow
[36:36] one day my purpose is going to be over
[36:38] and when it is I'm leaving here but
[36:42] until that day there's not a devil in
[36:44] that other dimension that can kill me
[36:49] you got to understand that because
[36:52] there's a supernatural God that lives
[36:54] inside of me and he says when it's time
[36:59] for me to go amen because I identify
[37:02] with those who have been chosen to
[37:04] salvation elected to eternal life it's a
[37:09] pretty powerful hope it's a pretty
[37:11] powerful promise so one of the
[37:13] ministries of angels this morning is to
[37:15] energize your faith how many of you know
[37:17] face battery can get kind of low anybody
[37:23] ever had a draining faith battery so I
[37:26] said you just gotta believe God and you
[37:29] say I'm believing with everything I got
[37:30] but I'm getting a little weak I'm
[37:33] getting a little low I'm having a hard
[37:35] time then we got to get in the presence
[37:37] of the Lord we've got to be faithful
[37:40] together with the Saints and get in and
[37:42] buy an environment of faith because the
[37:45] angels there with us but when we get
[37:48] together they're individual
[37:49] messengers who are assigned to us
[37:52] according to the scripture we used to
[37:54] you know the church used to say well
[37:56] everybody gets one well I want you to
[37:58] know I just can't believe that because
[38:00] the Bible doesn't say everybody just
[38:02] gets one and I know that some of you
[38:04] require many more than one you may have
[38:12] a dozen but when we get in the presence
[38:15] of the Lord they all come with us how
[38:19] many times did you hear brother Branham
[38:21] when he was preaching how many times did
[38:23] you hear and say may the angels of the
[38:25] Lord come and take up their position in
[38:27] this place standing along the walls
[38:30] watching over listen somebody said I
[38:32] don't believe in that you believe in
[38:34] Harry Potter
[38:37] you believe in what you see on the
[38:39] television you'd be surprised how much
[38:44] of that is real
[38:48] you'd be surprised that some of what
[38:51] Hollywood has glamorized it's not very
[38:54] glamorous at all it's actually more real
[38:57] than what a lot of people would want to
[38:59] admit this is not to strike fear in your
[39:03] heart it is to tell you you got to use
[39:05] your god-given weapon you got to stay in
[39:08] touch with the unseen realm and not the
[39:10] dark side of the unseen realm but the
[39:13] light side the god side the supernatural
[39:17] God's side is eternal life you got to
[39:20] stay connected to that you do that by
[39:21] faith no weapon no weapon formed against
[39:26] you shall prosper that's a promise but
[39:30] you got to stay connected to the faith
[39:31] realm remember the promise of asking
[39:34] whatever you will and it shall be given
[39:36] to you in my name remember that promise
[39:39] comes with a prerequisite that means a
[39:42] requirement and what is that requirement
[39:45] to stay connected what did Jesus say
[39:49] John 15 if you abide in me and my words
[39:56] it's a terrible shame for a born-again
[40:00] Holy Ghost field child of God not to
[40:02] know what the word said about something
[40:05] somebody said well I just got saved
[40:07] yesterday well you know what your
[40:08] knowledge is going to be limited but
[40:10] people who have been in the word for 30
[40:12] years we ought to know what the word
[40:13] said we can all commit it to memory but
[40:16] we can commit it to spirit we can get it
[40:19] piled inside of us and when we when we
[40:22] need it how many of you know the Spirit
[40:24] of God can bring it back to our memory
[40:25] and we need to exercise that word and
[40:27] use it take your Bible to school day you
[40:35] heard about it it's big nobody had to
[40:39] organize the day in my day when I was in
[40:42] school nobody had to get together
[40:43] I took my Bible to school every single
[40:46] solitary day of my school existence
[40:49] in public school and in Christian school
[40:51] do you know why it was life to me it was
[40:55] life to me I needed a connection and
[41:00] sometimes I needed it more in that kind
[41:03] of environment I needed to know it was
[41:05] there there's no superpower in the book
[41:09] the superpower is in the life but you
[41:13] don't know how to receive and operate in
[41:15] the life unless you read the book the
[41:18] book is the manual that helps you have
[41:22] fellowship with the Living Word I want
[41:25] to know the Living Word of God because
[41:29] it gives us power amen thank you for
[41:32] your amens now he goes on to say
[41:36] something in a message called God's
[41:37] provided way of healing we have a just a
[41:40] little more time he said Oh hallelujah
[41:44] you have to receive the word that's what
[41:47] sets it afire brother when you receive
[41:49] it the revelation something slips this
[41:52] is good something slips out of the
[41:55] unseen world yonder and comes rolling
[41:59] down a mystical channel somewhere into
[42:03] your soul every time you receive a
[42:08] revelation you of truth when God strikes
[42:12] your heart with the truth you've been
[42:14] reading the word you've been listening
[42:16] to a sermon you've been hearing your
[42:18] pastor preached and something quickens
[42:21] that word and you you you say oh that's
[42:24] right that's a true that is real and it
[42:26] becomes a revelation to you you cannot
[42:29] receive a revelation of this world of
[42:31] this dimension the revelation that we're
[42:34] talking about of spiritual understanding
[42:35] of his word it comes from that other
[42:38] supernatural realm and it comes rolling
[42:41] into this realm so every time you get a
[42:43] revelation of God's truth guess what a
[42:45] little more of that supernatural realm
[42:47] comes to live inside of you how many of
[42:50] you realize then that if we could get
[42:52] more and more revelation that's why
[42:54] we're praying all the time lord give us
[42:55] revelation give us understanding
[42:57] somebody said we have a message I know
[43:00] that God has given us a message but has
[43:02] he given you an understanding of that
[43:04] message you see it's hard sometimes
[43:10] these Pentecostal babies it's hard some
[43:14] time to teach them algebra because they
[43:18] haven't learned their ABCs do you
[43:21] understand that you've got to learn your
[43:23] ABCs before you can work in any kind of
[43:26] algebra we're talking spiritual now
[43:28] there are principles that the bride of
[43:30] Jesus Christ are going to need during
[43:32] this awakening we're going to need some
[43:35] of these principles to be able to push
[43:37] back the darkness to get above the
[43:40] depression to get above the the chronic
[43:42] sickness to get above all the things
[43:45] listen there's a spirit of suicide over
[43:47] this region that we have to keep praying
[43:50] about pushing it further and further
[43:53] back and and there must be an
[43:56] intercessor an intercessory bride a
[43:59] bride standing in intercession who takes
[44:02] this very personal how many of you
[44:05] believe it's personal it's in our county
[44:08] it's in our schools we don't have our
[44:11] children in the public school most of us
[44:14] but we still have a responsibility in
[44:16] prayer to pray about that thing I want
[44:20] you to know it's so not prayerless and
[44:21] every day when I go to God with the
[44:23] prayer list I remember that we can't
[44:26] afford to lose another teenager to that
[44:29] spirit until they have an opportunity to
[44:32] know there's more to life than that so
[44:35] you and I we keep getting revelation and
[44:37] praying Lord give me understanding open
[44:40] my eyes to your word so that you can
[44:44] keep getting deposits of that
[44:45] supernatural realm so that you can keep
[44:48] defeating start defeating or keep
[44:50] defeating the works of darkness against
[44:53] you how many of you feel the fiery darts
[44:55] sometime I'm gonna look around how many
[44:57] of you feel fiery darts what do you do
[45:00] catch him you just say well that one's
[45:03] mine I better take it God gives you he
[45:07] gives you an armor he gives you some
[45:10] defense but it's not automatic
[45:13] I'm gonna tell you something this
[45:15] generation is gonna have to get through
[45:16] their thick skull that God is not a
[45:18] lucky rabbit's foot he's not a horseshoe
[45:22] over your door your relationship with a
[45:26] supernatural God has to be a daily walk
[45:28] it's not once a week if it's a serious
[45:34] thing because there's so much darkness
[45:37] that crowds around us we're not only got
[45:41] a we don't only have to receive the
[45:42] light we gotta shine some light we've
[45:45] got to get enough light that it
[45:47] overflows and somebody else can catch a
[45:50] glimpse of it because you're shining how
[45:53] many of you want to shine
[45:54] do you really there's some price
[45:57] involved in there but it's worth it all
[45:59] I guarantee it's worth it all all right
[46:02] let me move on just a moment here we
[46:03] take a few more minutes when God speaks
[46:06] anything this is a message from it life
[46:09] is the healer when God speaks anything
[46:12] you must fasten your soul into that word
[46:15] on to his word and hold on to it no
[46:18] matter what the outside says your faith
[46:21] looks to the unseen world where do you
[46:27] find that in the Bible we just read it
[46:28] faith is the substance of things hoped
[46:32] for and the evidence of things not seen
[46:37] unseen the other realm the realm of
[46:45] completion the realm of fullness the
[46:51] realm that reflects
[46:54] the power and sovereignty of the God we
[46:59] serve
[47:01] you've got to see him you've got to
[47:05] catch a vision in your spirit man of who
[47:08] God is he is not out to get you
[47:12] he's out to get you he's not out to get
[47:19] you
[47:19] he's out to get you he's not out to
[47:23] destroy you he's out to capture you to
[47:29] pull you in to show you there's a
[47:32] purpose for your life you're not here at
[47:36] this time by mistake some of us feel
[47:40] like we were born out of season but you
[47:43] were born in God's season regardless of
[47:46] the circumstances of your conception
[47:49] you're here in God's proper order and
[47:52] timing for your life and you need to
[47:55] catch a glimpse of that it changes
[47:57] everything when you get a real true deep
[48:00] revelation from the supernatural realm
[48:02] that God lives in you and has chosen you
[48:05] and elected you for salvation and you're
[48:08] here for a purpose that is bigger than
[48:09] you are you don't have to know every
[48:11] detail of that purpose to keep pressing
[48:13] through and whipping the devil you just
[48:16] catch a piece of it I mean let me read
[48:21] this I have to find this but I can do it
[48:24] quickly
[48:24] I think but Smith Wigglesworth said
[48:27] something he said if you will take a
[48:30] step of ordinary faith when you come to
[48:35] the end of that faith very often this
[48:40] supernatural faith will take over can I
[48:45] read it again if you will take a step of
[48:49] ordinary faith what faith if you got use
[48:52] what you got you don't need a whole lot
[48:54] just use what you got so many said but I
[48:59] don't have any faith you do if you're
[49:02] alive on planet Earth you were given a
[49:05] measure of faith
[49:08] you may have pushed it down with a lot
[49:11] of doubt with a lot of woe is me
[49:15] with a lot of unbelief but you are given
[49:19] faith and you can touch that faith you
[49:23] can find that faith the key to finding
[49:26] the faith that God gave you in the
[49:28] beginning there's a key to it and that
[49:33] is to acknowledge that you cannot
[49:36] succeed without him your life will not
[49:42] ever be any better as long as you're
[49:45] doing the driving the old timers used to
[49:48] have the license plate god is my
[49:51] co-pilot
[49:52] if God not only does he not need you to
[49:56] be his co-pilot if he's doing the
[49:59] driving you should leave the driving to
[50:01] him
[50:02] you should just crawl in the back seat
[50:04] and cover your head really the best way
[50:06] because he knows what is best for us and
[50:12] he will help us if we quit fighting him
[50:15] why do we fight him why don't we just
[50:18] surrender to Him why don't we just let
[50:20] him come and live his life through us oh
[50:22] they're not have to be one of those
[50:24] weird Christians I'd have to be all
[50:26] spiritual and stuff let me tell you
[50:28] something you were born for that
[50:29] I didn't say religious I like to be able
[50:35] to talk to people without without
[50:37] punctuating every sentence with praise
[50:39] the Lord Amen that doesn't appeal to me
[50:42] but I understand that it's the best some
[50:44] folks can do and so when you're talking
[50:46] to them and in the restaurant its
[50:48] hallelujah praise the Lord god bless you
[50:50] buddy amen praise also good to see
[50:51] hallelujah our God I'm sure that it is
[50:57] sincere but it becomes a little
[51:01] obnoxious I don't really need that to
[51:04] feel like I'm talking to a Christian how
[51:06] many of you understand so you don't have
[51:08] to be flaky to be real he wants to live
[51:13] in you he wants you to quit trying to
[51:15] tell him how to live and how it would be
[51:20] better for
[51:21] where we sent unless we get into that
[51:23] other dimension in faith we only see
[51:25] what natural özkan see but from where
[51:27] your father sits this morning he's
[51:30] looking down and he not only sees right
[51:33] now he sees eternity he knows everything
[51:38] you're gonna go through the rest of your
[51:40] life and he may be setting you up right
[51:42] now for something you're not even
[51:44] expecting and all the steps on the
[51:48] journey are not pleasant but I want you
[51:52] to know there is no joy look at me I
[51:54] know I'm not pretty there is no joy like
[51:59] knowing that you are doing his will
[52:05] did you know that you can feel like you
[52:08] are failing everybody around you and
[52:11] it's enough to make you want to die but
[52:15] if you can catch a glimpse of knowing
[52:19] that you are pleasing God with what
[52:22] you're doing it becomes more than a shot
[52:25] in the arm it becomes an IV it becomes
[52:28] life to you I believe I can press on if
[52:32] I can just know that on that every now
[52:35] and again I please God I'm finding
[52:38] something in my in my destiny and his
[52:40] purpose for my life and I'm stepping
[52:42] into that what a joy that is to be able
[52:45] to go to bed at night and know when you
[52:47] lay your head on the pillow that your
[52:50] soul is anchored in Jesus Christ this is
[52:54] about relationship this is about
[52:56] covenant this is not just about the
[52:58] forgiveness of sin this is about walking
[53:00] with Him a supernatural God because he
[53:07] is racing up a supernatural people if
[53:11] you're a part of that number say man I
[53:13] am I'm a part of that now let me close
[53:17] with this we said something about that
[53:20] spiritual armor aren't you thankful we
[53:23] have one breastplate of righteousness
[53:26] helmet of salvation praise God feet shod
[53:29] with the preparation of peace take the
[53:31] sword of the Spirit
[53:35] but there's something you need to know
[53:37] about that Armour he said now we find
[53:43] our Lord in his work he claimed to do
[53:45] nothing of himself but what he's seen
[53:48] the father doing he gave all praise to
[53:50] God
[53:52] it was supernatural he said every armour
[53:56] that we have brother all of our armor is
[53:59] supernatural you put it on and you can't
[54:05] see it with a natural eye when I walk
[54:08] down the aisle you don't see the helmet
[54:10] of salvation on my head but it's there
[54:16] but it's not in the natural realm it's a
[54:20] supernatural armor that protects me in
[54:22] the natural realm if I take access to it
[54:25] how by faith by faith he said every
[54:31] armor that we have brother all of our
[54:33] armor supernatural nothing natural we
[54:36] must believe it what are the fruit of
[54:37] the Spirit love joy peace long-suffering
[54:38] meekness gentleness patience he said you
[54:42] don't go down to the drugstore and buy
[54:44] me a quarters worth of patients or $5
[54:47] worth alive he said I could stand a lot
[54:50] of that he said see it's unseen
[54:54] sometimes it's the unseen something our
[54:59] whole armor we stand in the unseen world
[55:03] looking at unseen things yet to us we
[55:07] can see them because our faith detects
[55:11] them and says it's there it's real in
[55:19] another message sir we would see Jesus
[55:21] and the whole Christian armor now is
[55:23] unseen the Christian looks at what he
[55:25] doesn't see in the natural that's the
[55:27] only way you can be a Christian you've
[55:28] got to believe God who you can't see the
[55:32] whole Christian armor and he goes on to
[55:35] name the fruits again all those things
[55:37] are unseen but the things that's unseen
[55:40] they're the ones that really has the
[55:44] reality
[55:46] the reality is in the unseen things if
[55:50] it's unseen how do we see it by faith
[55:54] with faith eyes the doctor said there's
[55:58] no hope there's no solution and yet
[56:02] faith rises up in your heart to say wait
[56:04] a minute I understand and respect and
[56:06] honor what you have to say but my faith
[56:09] eyes are seeing something else that's
[56:11] why I'm believing serving God does not
[56:15] mean there will not be any
[56:16] disappointments there will be some
[56:18] disappointments but it means that at the
[56:20] end of every day and at the end of every
[56:22] trial and at the end of every broken
[56:24] heart ache you've still got somebody who
[56:28] said I'm with you I'm in you by my
[56:31] spirit and you can make it you can get
[56:33] through this by trusting me I hear I
[56:37] hear the Lord in the spirit I hear the
[56:38] Lord saying I'm not gonna be your lucky
[56:40] charm
[56:42] I'm just not I'm not gonna be the magic
[56:46] thing you pull down off the shelf when
[56:48] you get to bind I'm looking for
[56:50] relationship God is looking for you to
[56:54] surrender your life to Him let's stand
[56:57] this morning and afternoon I know it's
[56:59] late but remember we didn't start till
[57:01] 11:00
[57:02] and God's good and he's real there's a
[57:12] lot of people who struggle believing
[57:15] that God is good because bad things
[57:18] happen in this world and I want you to
[57:22] know that is a product of sin they're
[57:28] bad things happening around us it is the
[57:31] fruit of man's decision to reject God so
[57:38] if somebody says let's let's take our
[57:41] Bible to school one day I'm for that
[57:45] because remember I tried to take mine
[57:48] every day and did if somebody said let's
[57:51] get around the flagpole and pray today
[57:53] put Jesus back I'm for that
[58:00] nobody conceived in their mind the idea
[58:05] of school mass shootings no one thought
[58:10] that anything like this could possibly
[58:12] be real in those days when they were
[58:16] fighting so hard to keep the Bible out
[58:18] of the classroom and prayer out of the
[58:20] public schools just think about it
[58:22] nobody was thinking about what the
[58:24] results would be we just don't want our
[58:26] kids brainwashed to Christianity but
[58:29] nobody was thinking about the fact that
[58:31] when you reject God and push him out of
[58:33] your life and out of your society the
[58:37] Bible said there's consequences for that
[58:39] and they're already set they're already
[58:42] scripturally outlined way before what's
[58:46] happening now started happening it was
[58:48] already outlined you can't keep
[58:50] rejecting God and expect to have a good
[58:54] life not because he wants to mess with
[58:59] your fun he wants you he wants you he
[59:07] wants your life and he wants you to love
[59:10] him the way that he loves you yes jesus
[59:18] loves me
[59:23] ye-yes
[59:26] Jesus loves
