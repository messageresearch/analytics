TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but he's waiting for you to come into agreement with him and lay it back on the accuser but all young people older people middle-aged people i am telling you the blood of jesus christ has been shed as the atonement and it's standing between you and the wrath of god it is there between you and the wrath of god and that blood wipes the sin away and i'm telling you today the sin that you committed yesterday in the mind of god it's already bleached out but he's waiting for you to come into agreement with him and lay it back on the accuser lay it back on the accuser the dirty devil wants to keep you all bound up in guilt and condemnation and shame to keep you from moving forward he wants to keep you in a pit but hey we're just gonna lay it back over on the devil today and just keep it on him because he is the father of lies he wants to pour out his wrath on you and he wants you to carry some of what he has to carry he wants you to be in a place where that you're bearing something that you don't have to carry you don't have to you know why you don't have to because jesus christ already did and the fact was that i was in him that day at calvary and i already bore it once [Music] now that may be a little over the top for some people but i've come to the understanding that i was in him that day at calvary i was in him therefore i was in him when his visage was marred and it was hard to tell who he was i was in him when he was carrying all of my sin and condemnation i was with him when i he was carrying all of my deepest darkest ugliest secrets that there were i was in him therefore i'm telling you once again you better have confidence in the holy ghost that lives inside of you if i say i am born again of the spirit of god and the blood of jesus christ has cleansed me from all of that stuff then i can come into agreement with the word of god the revealed word of god and say i don't have to carry that anymore you can accuse all day long if you want to but i'm just keeping it right back on you and you're going to have to carry all of these accusations with you to the lake of fire you've got to carry them with you to the day of judgment friends as the bride of jesus christ gets closer and closer to the day of that catching away and she recognizes more and more who she is and that she doesn't have to walk under guilt and condemnation she doesn't have to walk under grief and anxiety and sorrows and the transgressions of the past and the iniquities of the past she doesn't have to walk under any of that and the enemy continues to accuse you and you continue to heap it back on his head i tell you we're going to walk in such exalted victory of the lord jesus christ [Music]
