[0:00] we would begin to see god honoring his
[0:03] word
[0:04] in our mouth like he did in the prophets
[0:07] of old
[0:11] [Music]
[0:15] now we are discovering even at this late
[0:18] hour
[0:18] we're discovering as the bride that we
[0:22] are not here just to live our own
[0:24] lives we are here to be a reflection of
[0:27] the sun
[0:28] amen and his life and in order to get to
[0:32] that place
[0:33] there's a lot of guilt that has to be
[0:35] canceled there's a lot of shame that has
[0:38] to be canceled
[0:39] and you are the only one
[0:42] i can speak positive words over you you
[0:45] can speak
[0:45] positive words over me but as an
[0:48] individual we are the only ones
[0:50] that can receive god's perfect gift
[0:53] that's been given to us
[0:55] you have to release the shame i have to
[0:58] release my shame
[1:00] you have to release your guilt i have to
[1:02] release mine
[1:04] you have to trade your condemnation for
[1:06] acceptance
[1:08] and i have to trade my condemnation for
[1:11] acceptance
[1:12] we have been made accepted
[1:16] in the beloved that's where our
[1:20] true acceptance comes from can i tell
[1:23] you something
[1:25] jesus accepts you
[1:31] if you have come to him in confession
[1:35] and true repentance he accepts you
[1:38] i believe that in order to fully
[1:40] appropriate the power
[1:42] of the blood of jesus christ in our life
[1:46] we're going to have to work on the way
[1:48] we think about the blood
[1:50] it's not just a blanket that we put on
[1:52] and we can say we're covered it's so
[1:54] much more than that
[1:55] it is a total regeneration
[2:00] it changes the believer even on a
[2:03] cellular
[2:04] level when the bible says you are a new
[2:08] creation you are a new creature
[2:12] it means what it says you are of another
[2:16] breed the believer then through that
[2:20] work of regeneration becomes
[2:23] a new race
[2:28] think of that that settles the race war
[2:34] for the believer you're above caucasian
[2:38] you're above african-american you're
[2:41] above nation
[2:43] you become by the transforming power of
[2:46] the blood of jesus christ
[2:47] a new race amen a royal race
[2:52] after the royal seed of abraham
[2:55] and that means that we have power to
[2:58] think
[2:59] a new way and speak
[3:02] a new way but i want you to know with a
[3:05] real understanding and a real revelation
[3:09] of what the blood has accomplished in
[3:10] our life with a rewiring
[3:13] of our thought process with a change of
[3:16] our vocabulary
[3:18] we would begin to see god honoring his
[3:22] word
[3:22] in our mouth like he did in the prophets
[3:25] of old
[3:26] and nobody is going to wake up one day
[3:30] i'm sorry to tell you you're not going
[3:32] to wake up one day
[3:34] thinking different and speaking
[3:35] different
[3:37] it's not going to fall on us like ripe
[3:39] cherries from a tree top is it
[3:41] it's going to be a practice it's going
[3:44] to be a
[3:44] process the word is changing us
[3:48] from faith to faith from strength to
[3:51] strength
[3:52] from glory to glory
