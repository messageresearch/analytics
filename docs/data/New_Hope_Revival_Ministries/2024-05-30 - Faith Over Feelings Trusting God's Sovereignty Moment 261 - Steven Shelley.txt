TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's a necessity for real Christians to forget their feelings it's not that we don't have feelings but as real Believers it is necessary that we lay our feelings aside and we take God at his word we have to do that in crisis we have to do that in good times we have to do that in mediocre times and we particularly have to do it in difficult times because life is a Str brain and it's stressful fear is the enemy of faith and it's easy for all of us to walk in fear but as true believers we have to put fear aside sometimes we have to drive it out sometimes we have to talk to it and tell it to go so that faith can come and take its place because you're given a Measure of Faith it's never that you don't have enough Faith as a Believer God is either Sovereign or he is not sovereign Sovereign and if we walk away from any situation and say if if there would have been another doctor if there would have been another medicine if there would have been another procedure if we walk away with that kind of a declaration we're not moving in faith we're moving in feelings because if God is Sovereign the right man will show up at the right time to do whatever needs to be done and we're not looking to man anyway we're looking to to God God is leading the believer sometimes we don't even know we're being led we just feel a tug or a pull or an urge and it is the spirit of the Lord within us directing us and leading us whether we're aware of it or not I believe the more aware we become of the leadership of the spirit in our life the more successful we'll be as Christians in the last days I want you to know there's a peace that Jesus has that's not just the absence of turmoil come on now it's not just the absence of a problem but he said the peace that I give to you how many of you know that he taught us that it abides forever it seems to pass all human understanding and it never leaves us if you've ever experienced that peace when you needed him let me see your hand is a testimony he comes and in that moment that you found it hard to come to peace it's because you are letting your feelings Rule and in that moment no one can do it for you brother no one can control your feelings and emotions but you it is our responsibility to take a hold of those things when we recognize them pulling us away from the word when we feel those things pulling us away from Faith it's our responsibility to take them captive to arrest them to submit them ain't that what he said casting down all all imagination and taking captive every thought that's contrary to truth did you know yielding to that stuff one time can pull you right out of the will of God it can place a bitterness within you and that bitterness you know it seems like it it normally takes years and years for bitterness to grow but we're living in such an accelerated hour that by entertaining those negative thoughts we can find nearly over night that a bitterness has taken hold and what's wrong with bitterness is we start seeing everything around us from the filter of bitterness amen and we get madder and matter and matter and matter we get more jealous and more jealous and more jealous and the next thing you know we start cutting ourselves off from the people who love us the most we start cutting ourselves off from the church that is there to help us from our leaders that are there to help us so we isolate ourselves into a depression where if we could recognize who we are and what Authority we have over our own life I can't take jealousy out of your life but I can deal with it in mine
