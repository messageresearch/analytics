[56:08] see him
[56:09] we came to hear from the lord
[56:12] and i know he's here i'm like brother
[56:14] greeley said i know he's here because i
[56:16] brought him with me when i came

[56:39] you sing that but tonight we're going to
[56:41] let brother brooks have all the time
[56:44] that he needs to sing who'd want to sing
[56:47] when you when you've got a preacher here
[56:49] that can sing and preach
[56:51] we ought to just work him hard
[56:54] yes really i even had him to ask the
[56:56] blessing at lunch i just said it's time
[56:58] for him to start working
[57:00] while he's here
[57:02] but would you stand with me all over
[57:04] this room again i know you're up and

[57:13] so thankful
[57:15] for
[57:16] the times that brother brooks has come
[57:18] to us from iowa
[57:20] and uh
[57:22] my friendship and with brother brooks
[57:24] goes back a long time
[57:26] when i was living in south carolina he
[57:29] was living in south carolina
[57:31] and he extended
[57:33] a hand of friendship to me
[57:36] and i he and brother henry simmons and i
[57:38] have never forgotten it then he was in
[57:40] ohio and i went up and preached for him
[57:42] while he was pastoring in ohio and then
[57:45] he moved to another country
[57:48] to iowa
[57:49] and i haven't seen him in iowa but a few
[57:53] years ago the lord made a way and put it
[57:55] in our heart to have brother brooks and
[57:57] now we just don't think we can have a
[57:59] camp meeting without him
[58:01] but we are so blessed i want you to
[58:03] raise your hand toward god's servant
[58:05] right now and i want you to ask that god
[58:08] would let his holy anointing fall on him
[58:12] from the top of his head lord to the
[58:14] souls of his feet
[58:16] and lord even though he'll be
[58:18] ministering to some tonight he's never
[58:20] ministered to let there be no
[58:21] awkwardness in this house
[58:24] but lord just let him flow as the holy
[58:27] spirit is poured out upon his life and i
[58:30] ask you to use every gift that you have
[58:33] placed in him for the glory of god
[58:37] and lord let your word flow through him
[58:40] and then we ask you to confirm your word
[58:44] by bringing it to pass in our lives
[58:47] we will give you the glory and the honor
[58:50] and the praise for it all in the
[58:53] wonderful name of the lord jesus christ
[58:56] we pray amen brother brooks would you

[1:16:23] desire my wife

[1:16:40] god and
[1:16:41] i am there's so many things that i i
[1:16:44] really want to say but we're going to
[1:16:45] get right into the word of god and
[1:16:50] words cannot express my gratitude
[1:16:54] but as we stand we're just going to get
[1:16:57] have you read a few scripture
[1:17:02] i believe that we're living in a day
[1:17:08] i love fire i love fire
[1:17:11] i'm disturbed when i don't see fire
[1:17:15] i'm disturbed when the fire is not
[1:17:17] firing up in me and
[1:17:19] and i'm disturbed when i don't see the
[1:17:21] fire in the believer
[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:17:24] we're living in the most glorious time
[1:17:27] ever
[1:17:29] and the bible tells us to lift up our
[1:17:31] heads
[1:17:32] when you see the day approaching
[1:17:35] you supposed to come together the more
[1:17:40] one thing i can truly say about those
[1:17:42] old pentecostal churches
[1:17:44] you had service almost every night
[1:17:48] something was going on
[1:17:50] in reality you didn't have time to sin
[1:17:53] [Laughter]
[1:17:57] hallelujah
[1:17:59] but uh i i wondered within myself lord
[1:18:02] why did you let me
[1:18:04] use so many of my what i considered my
[1:18:06] valuable years
[1:18:08] and the lord spoke to me and and said as
[1:18:11] he preserved israel
[1:18:14] in egypt he preserved me
[1:18:17] and every time i think about that i
[1:18:19] think about the many times that i could
[1:18:21] have been dead
[1:18:23] but god protected me
[1:18:25] even when i didn't even know him
[1:18:29] his goodness and mercy
[1:18:33] followed me all the days of my life
[1:18:37] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[1:18:39] to romans
[1:18:40] i've got three passages of scripture
[1:18:42] here

[1:19:11] and it took me a while to find a receipt
[1:19:12] but i had to go all the way back to lima
[1:19:16] and then when i got the receipt
[1:19:19] they told me that everything on my ipad
[1:19:21] was erased
[1:19:24] so

[1:20:36] an inheritance
[1:20:38] being predestinated according to the
[1:20:41] purpose
[1:20:42] of him who worketh
[1:20:45] all things after the counsel of his own

[1:21:11] second timothy one and nine who saved us
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:16] and called us with an
[1:21:19] holy calling
[1:21:21] not according to our own works that's
[1:21:24] the part i like
[1:21:27] but according to his own purpose
[1:21:30] and grace
[1:21:32] which was given us in christ
[1:21:34] jesus before
[1:21:36] the world
[1:21:38] began
[1:21:41] let us pray
[1:21:43] our gracious father
[1:21:45] we come before you lord jesus as humbly
[1:21:48] as we know how
[1:21:50] i thank you for being so good to us
[1:21:53] without you
[1:21:54] lord where would we be
[1:21:58] coming to know lord who you are
[1:22:03] and your purpose in me
[1:22:07] has been the greatest of all revelations
[1:22:11] and lord i pray tonight that you would
[1:22:13] bless the service in a special way
[1:22:16] break and destroy every yoke yes sir
[1:22:20] even as our sister song that song about
[1:22:23] breakthrough
[1:22:24] because there are many still need
[1:22:28] a breakthrough amen
[1:22:30] we've come in a time oh god where
[1:22:33] darkness is gathering
[1:22:36] at a rapid speed
[1:22:40] but father you are a god of contrast
[1:22:44] and you said you've never left yourself
[1:22:46] without a witness
[1:22:49] lord we believe that we are your
[1:22:52] witnesses
[1:22:54] but father you know even as a witness
[1:22:58] we cannot do anything
[1:23:00] without your leadership
[1:23:03] and your power
[1:23:05] bless us here this evening
[1:23:07] as we come in jesus christ's name
[1:23:10] the only name
[1:23:12] the only true name
[1:23:14] the only living name of god
[1:23:16] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:20] you may be seated
[1:23:26] we
[1:23:29] we want to build up by by god's grace
[1:23:31] we'll try
[1:23:32] to just give what god wants us to give
[1:23:35] tonight
[1:23:37] as i said i'm nobody i'm just a servant
[1:23:40] of the lord
[1:23:41] i don't say that to try to be humble
[1:23:45] i say that because it's true
[1:23:48] and
[1:23:49] when i think about
[1:23:51] salvation
[1:23:53] and how god saved me
[1:23:56] there is no
[1:23:59] way i can even
[1:24:00] understand or even come to the
[1:24:03] understanding of why
[1:24:06] because
[1:24:07] i wasn't the best
[1:24:10] of sinners
[1:24:12] i was the worst
[1:24:14] and the thing about it is that
[1:24:17] there was something about me that
[1:24:20] i did not recognize
[1:24:23] but it took the message to
[1:24:25] bring that out of me
[1:24:27] because no matter how bad i was and
[1:24:30] you know with all of the things that i
[1:24:32] did do in life
[1:24:34] there was always a respect
[1:24:37] for god
[1:24:39] i can remember even when i was a young
[1:24:41] boy
[1:24:43] in sunday school singing yes jesus loved
[1:24:46] me
[1:24:47] and i would sing that song with all my
[1:24:49] heart
[1:24:52] and one of the things that i did not you
[1:24:54] see another one of the things that god
[1:24:56] revealed to me even before i committed
[1:24:59] my life to him
[1:25:01] was that
[1:25:02] jesus christ
[1:25:04] is god
[1:25:07] i was in a baptist church
[1:25:10] and i never saw and understood
[1:25:14] trinity
[1:25:16] i always saw god
[1:25:19] i can't even explain it
[1:25:21] but when i prayed to jesus christ i knew
[1:25:24] i was praying to god
[1:25:29] it is important
[1:25:31] that we come to know who we are
[1:25:35] it's time out
[1:25:38] for guesswork
[1:25:41] but we must know that we are called with
[1:25:44] a holy calling
[1:25:48] yes sir
[1:25:49] we're living in a time where people are
[1:25:51] falling and failing
[1:25:53] people are giving up
[1:25:55] giving up
[1:25:57] something that i cannot even imagine
[1:26:00] how do you give up
[1:26:03] how do you give up
[1:26:07] i always encourage my church
[1:26:10] don't give up on god
[1:26:14] because god won't give up on you
[1:26:18] hallelujah
[1:26:20] living in a day
[1:26:23] when the book is open
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:27] it's no longer closed
[1:26:30] it's no longer given to man's
[1:26:32] interpretation
[1:26:35] because god in these last days have come
[1:26:38] to interpret his own word
[1:26:44] talking about anointed to
[1:26:46] to overcome that's the
[1:26:48] theme anything
[1:26:51] i believe
[1:26:52] i know it's true
[1:26:54] hallelujah
[1:26:56] and we must understand
[1:26:59] who's in control
[1:27:03] hallelujah
[1:27:05] not by power
[1:27:07] not by might
[1:27:09] but by my spirit
[1:27:11] saith the lord
[1:27:14] hallelujah
[1:27:15] let me read a few scriptures here
[1:27:17] isaiah 40 and 26 you don't have to turn
[1:27:20] there
[1:27:21] lift up your eyes on high
[1:27:24] and behold who have created these things
[1:27:29] that bringeth out their host by number
[1:27:33] he calleth all by name
[1:27:36] by the greatness of his might
[1:27:40] for that he is strong
[1:27:42] in power
[1:27:43] not one failing
[1:27:46] why say it thou o jacob
[1:27:48] and speak it o israel
[1:27:51] my way is heared from the lord
[1:27:53] and my judgment is passed over from my
[1:27:57] god
[1:27:58] has thou
[1:27:59] not known
[1:28:02] hallelujah
[1:28:03] has thou not heard
[1:28:06] that the everlasting god
[1:28:08] the lord the creator of the ends of the
[1:28:12] earth fadeth not
[1:28:15] neither is weary
[1:28:17] there is no searching
[1:28:20] of his understanding
[1:28:22] in other words if you are going to know
[1:28:24] him he's got to reveal himself to you
[1:28:28] hallelujah because let me say it like
[1:28:31] this
[1:28:32] god is just as weak as your
[1:28:35] understanding of him
[1:28:38] i'm going to say it again
[1:28:40] god is just as weak
[1:28:42] as your understanding of him
[1:28:46] if god can't do everything
[1:28:48] god won't do everything
[1:28:52] you understand me
[1:28:53] if you think god can't do everything
[1:28:57] then god won't do anything
[1:29:00] hallelujah so you say well what do you
[1:29:02] mean brother brooks we're living in a
[1:29:04] time where god is not looking for
[1:29:07] cowards he's looking for those who will
[1:29:10] take this storm and walk through it
[1:29:13] hallelujah is that right
[1:29:16] this is the day we're living in
[1:29:18] we're living in the day of adoption
[1:29:20] we're living in the day of the full
[1:29:22] world
[1:29:23] we're living in the day where the sons
[1:29:25] of god is to be made manifest
[1:29:28] hallelujah this is the reason why god
[1:29:31] sent us malachi 4.
[1:29:34] hallelujah like i was telling my church
[1:29:38] the prophet of god said the move of uh
[1:29:40] the move is on for the bride and many
[1:29:43] people puts it like this they said the
[1:29:45] move is on the bride no the move is on
[1:29:48] for the bride everything
[1:29:51] that you see around you
[1:29:53] everything is working on your behalf
[1:29:57] hallelujah the darkness is pulling
[1:30:00] together why because light must be shown
[1:30:05] hallelujah
[1:30:06] amen and we're living in the most evil
[1:30:09] age ever
[1:30:11] oh yeah but god has pulled us out
[1:30:14] hallelujah into an eternal age
[1:30:18] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:20] somebody help me here tonight because
[1:30:23] you must realize amen that we're not
[1:30:26] quitters we're winners
[1:30:28] hallelujah you say when did you win i
[1:30:31] won before the foundation of the world
[1:30:35] hallelujah yes sir
[1:30:38] yes sir i was in his mind and you were
[1:30:42] in his mind and he brought you here
[1:30:46] to put the devil under your feet
[1:30:48] hallelujah
[1:30:50] oh yes
[1:30:54] his purpose
[1:30:56] god always has a purpose
[1:30:59] hallelujah
[1:31:01] a lot of times people don't understand
[1:31:04] that even when god created or made the
[1:31:06] serpent
[1:31:08] he made the serpent for a purpose
[1:31:11] hallelujah come on somebody
[1:31:13] he made adam and eve and there was a
[1:31:15] purpose
[1:31:17] oh my god
[1:31:19] when i look at all of the
[1:31:21] shadows and types and
[1:31:23] things of the word of god
[1:31:25] you know when god opened those seals he
[1:31:27] opened also this the meaning of those
[1:31:29] stories that we saw in the book
[1:31:31] all the shadows and types was there and
[1:31:34] then what was he doing he was showing us
[1:31:36] who we really are
[1:31:38] and what we need to do instead of
[1:31:39] running from the devil we need to step
[1:31:41] into the book
[1:31:42] you understand me we must become amen
[1:31:45] what the books say we are
[1:31:48] hallelujah
[1:31:50] let me move on by god's grace
[1:31:53] when you realize that you're serving a
[1:31:55] god
[1:31:57] they cannot be stopped
[1:32:00] hallelujah
[1:32:02] amen death couldn't stop him somebody
[1:32:05] helped me here
[1:32:06] you see the romans they thought they
[1:32:08] could stop him they couldn't stop him
[1:32:11] hallelujah and you see nothing can stop
[1:32:14] god you say why because the bible said
[1:32:17] when the word is spoken
[1:32:19] it cannot come back void
[1:32:22] hallelujah
[1:32:24] listen but it says we're going through a
[1:32:26] time
[1:32:29] but they that wait upon the lord
[1:32:33] shall renew their strength
[1:32:36] they shall mount up with wings
[1:32:38] with the knee as an ego
[1:32:40] they should run and not be weary
[1:32:43] they shall walk
[1:32:45] and not faint
[1:32:47] is that all right
[1:32:49] so you got to understand the word has
[1:32:52] been spoken
[1:32:53] the problem is is that people don't know
[1:32:56] how to worship the word
[1:33:00] hallelujah because you got to understand
[1:33:03] the word is
[1:33:05] god
[1:33:06] and when you hear the scripture that's
[1:33:09] when you're supposed to get excited
[1:33:13] hallelujah it's all right for the music
[1:33:15] to excite you
[1:33:17] it's all right for singing and shouting
[1:33:19] that's good excitement but when the
[1:33:21] world is being preached that's the thing
[1:33:24] that's supposed to excite you
[1:33:27] hallelujah because that's what that's
[1:33:30] what worshiping the word
[1:33:34] is hallelujah
[1:33:37] people say no no no let me tell you
[1:33:39] something i like it
[1:33:41] i've got a brother he's like a lion
[1:33:43] and i tell you when when i'm preaching
[1:33:45] he's up
[1:33:47] he's not worried about nobody else
[1:33:49] hallelujah he's praising god and pulling
[1:33:52] on the gift and yes why because he know
[1:33:55] if he pull
[1:33:56] is that right
[1:33:58] el shaddai is going to give him
[1:34:00] something
[1:34:01] hallelujah the blessed one is going to
[1:34:03] give him something so the more you pull
[1:34:06] the more you get
[1:34:09] hallelujah stop looking at this veil
[1:34:13] don't look at the veil see that's what
[1:34:16] happened in jesus day
[1:34:18] they look at the veil and they miss god
[1:34:22] hallelujah
[1:34:24] like i was trying to tell the people the
[1:34:25] other day
[1:34:27] i say the throne room always moves
[1:34:31] hello
[1:34:32] it moves
[1:34:34] and what people don't understand
[1:34:36] everybody's looking up here
[1:34:38] when god has come down here
[1:34:41] hallelujah is that the truth
[1:34:44] you are designed everything about you
[1:34:47] amen speaks of the word
[1:34:50] is that right your five fingers
[1:34:52] represents the five uh uh ministries of
[1:34:55] god
[1:34:57] is that right
[1:34:58] you got to understand that this these
[1:35:00] two eyes amen that we see is the only
[1:35:04] new testament prophets
[1:35:07] hallelujah but you put them together and
[1:35:09] they see one vision
[1:35:12] oh come on somebody when you see your
[1:35:15] heart
[1:35:16] it has four chambers
[1:35:18] hallelujah the four living creatures
[1:35:22] and right in the midst of the four
[1:35:24] living creatures where where is where
[1:35:26] god dwells
[1:35:28] hallelujah that's why the bible says as
[1:35:31] a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:35:34] holly is that the truth
[1:35:36] then you've got the 24 elders
[1:35:39] 24 reals
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:43] hallelujah come on somebody and what
[1:35:46] they're doing they're protecting
[1:35:48] hallelujah the heart
[1:35:51] the throne room is what they are
[1:35:54] protecting
[1:35:55] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:35:57] everything that moses designed was a
[1:36:00] shadow and a type of you
[1:36:05] hallelujah
[1:36:08] hallelujah
[1:36:10] yes yes yes
[1:36:12] and when god is not on the throne
[1:36:14] it's judgment
[1:36:16] but when he's on the throne of your
[1:36:18] heart
[1:36:19] he comes down shouting grace grace
[1:36:22] hallelujah is that all right so let's
[1:36:25] move on by the grace of god so we look
[1:36:27] at these things and we say well brother
[1:36:29] brooks what are you saying
[1:36:32] in these last days
[1:36:34] we've come through justification
[1:36:36] sanctification baptism holy ghost and
[1:36:38] that baptism of the holy ghost makes
[1:36:40] room for god himself
[1:36:42] is that right
[1:36:43] it's not another holy ghost
[1:36:45] it's the same holy ghost
[1:36:47] hallelujah but god is maturing himself
[1:36:51] in you
[1:36:52] is that right oh it's the truth
[1:36:55] that means amen you've got to go through
[1:36:57] some sufferings
[1:36:59] and people don't want to suffer
[1:37:02] but jesus said if you're going to be a
[1:37:04] follower of me take up your cross and
[1:37:07] follow me
[1:37:09] everybody has a cross to bear
[1:37:12] you want to be a winner
[1:37:17] let me back it up a little bit i was
[1:37:20] dealing with purpose
[1:37:23] you know there had to be a thomas edison
[1:37:29] because of the he created the lights
[1:37:33] yeah
[1:37:34] and god knew we were going to need lice
[1:37:38] hallelujah is that right
[1:37:40] god knew you needed christopher columbus
[1:37:44] because in his mind america was here
[1:37:49] hallelujah
[1:37:50] oh come on somebody
[1:37:52] i'm going to say some things that people
[1:37:54] may not understand what i'm saying
[1:37:56] but slavery even played its part
[1:38:03] because on the days of zuzu street
[1:38:08] god had a purpose
[1:38:11] y'all hear me
[1:38:13] now if he had stayed over there in
[1:38:14] africa god's purpose would not have been
[1:38:17] met
[1:38:19] but in the mind of god god saw seymour
[1:38:24] somebody help me here
[1:38:26] oh you say purpose that's why the
[1:38:28] prophet of god was mixed
[1:38:31] had a little indian
[1:38:33] had a little irish
[1:38:34] and and what was the other one but
[1:38:36] anyway
[1:38:37] his character
[1:38:39] his makeup
[1:38:41] was put together
[1:38:43] in that way
[1:38:44] so he could be the elijah for our day
[1:38:48] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:38:50] let me say it like this god did not make
[1:38:52] a mistake when he made you
[1:38:56] hallelujah everything about you god
[1:39:00] designed in his mind before the
[1:39:03] foundation of the world
[1:39:06] y'all better hear what i'm saying
[1:39:08] thousands of years you
[1:39:10] traveled from the garden of eden
[1:39:13] even up to this day
[1:39:15] oh somebody help me here
[1:39:17] and no matter how many germs
[1:39:20] met that egg they could not break it
[1:39:23] they couldn't go through it
[1:39:25] it wasn't designed for them
[1:39:28] but when you came along
[1:39:30] somebody help me here
[1:39:32] and this is what i tell people
[1:39:34] i said if it's a million to one and i
[1:39:38] made it in the natural birth what about
[1:39:40] now
[1:39:41] hallelujah what about now
[1:39:45] listen people they're falling away
[1:39:48] but god has given us grace to stand
[1:39:50] hallelujah why because you have been
[1:39:53] ordained to make this rapture hallelujah
[1:39:57] glory to god
[1:40:03] hallelujah
[1:40:04] don't get discouraged
[1:40:06] because even in your natural they died
[1:40:09] hallelujah but at the end of the road
[1:40:12] you penetrated
[1:40:14] sister we had a breakthrough
[1:40:16] [Laughter]
[1:40:18] even then and if we had a breakthrough
[1:40:21] then we're going to have the
[1:40:23] breakthrough now
[1:40:25] nothing can stop it
[1:40:29] hallelujah
[1:40:31] oh my
[1:40:33] i'm holding
[1:40:35] the victory
[1:40:37] in me
[1:40:39] that's my subject
[1:40:41] you are holding
[1:40:43] the victory
[1:40:44] in you
[1:40:46] hallelujah so when it looks like you
[1:40:49] can't go any further turn to the victory
[1:40:54] somebody help me here see because you're
[1:40:57] packing something and the devil is
[1:40:59] trying to keep you from knowing what you
[1:41:01] got
[1:41:02] hallelujah but my holy ghost is more
[1:41:05] than a dance my holy ghost is greater
[1:41:08] than a shout
[1:41:09] yes somebody help me my holy ghost is
[1:41:13] more than just a supplier
[1:41:15] but my holy ghost is god himself
[1:41:19] you hear me
[1:41:21] hallelujah your god
[1:41:23] and my god
[1:41:25] it's the god of creation
[1:41:30] and at his name every knee must bow
[1:41:34] hallelujah see what people don't
[1:41:36] understand is that we have a lost
[1:41:38] we oh we say jesus
[1:41:40] we say jesus christ
[1:41:42] but we don't say it with the revelation
[1:41:44] of what the name is
[1:41:46] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:41:48] everybody say jesus but they don't say
[1:41:51] it with the revelation
[1:41:52] but when you say it with the revelation
[1:41:54] of who he is
[1:41:56] something has to happen
[1:41:58] hallelujah if you say jesus and in that
[1:42:02] word you're speaking with hope
[1:42:04] it won't work
[1:42:06] but when you speak jesus and you know
[1:42:09] that he said you can move mountains the
[1:42:12] mountains must move
[1:42:14] oh lord see that's what i'm talking
[1:42:16] about this is nothing something that is
[1:42:19] nothing that's so deep
[1:42:21] but listen
[1:42:22] we come to a place and you say well
[1:42:24] brother brooks what are you trying to
[1:42:26] tell us
[1:42:27] see throughout the church ages
[1:42:30] they mixed the word
[1:42:32] they hybrided it
[1:42:34] and because they did that it stopped
[1:42:36] having the effect that it used to have
[1:42:40] hallelujah and god is calling for a
[1:42:42] virtuous bride is that right he's
[1:42:45] calling for someone that's going to
[1:42:47] believe
[1:42:49] is that the truth
[1:42:51] now somebody says i am saved from sin
[1:42:54] what do you mean oh i don't smoke
[1:42:56] anymore i don't drink no that's not it
[1:42:59] i am saved and when that word saved from
[1:43:02] sin means unbelief
[1:43:06] that it
[1:43:07] i am saved from unbelief
[1:43:10] that means as a christian i must always
[1:43:13] believe
[1:43:15] hallelujah that's why the man of god
[1:43:17] said sang that song only believe only
[1:43:20] believe all things are possible
[1:43:23] hallelujah because when you believe
[1:43:27] when you really believe
[1:43:29] the eyes of the blind is open
[1:43:33] hallelujah is that right the dead is
[1:43:36] raised
[1:43:38] hallelujah is that right every disease
[1:43:41] must bow to the name of jesus christ
[1:43:45] every disease
[1:43:49] and god put
[1:43:50] you here
[1:43:53] and he came to occupy
[1:43:55] your heart
[1:43:56] so he could speak through you
[1:44:00] hallelujah
[1:44:01] god could have come down he didn't have
[1:44:03] to use moses
[1:44:05] god could have come down and spoke
[1:44:06] himself
[1:44:07] but you see when god really comes down
[1:44:10] we most of us we become afraid
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:14] is that right
[1:44:15] remember when they say lord moses we
[1:44:17] want to hear we want to hear god speak
[1:44:20] and when god came down they heard the
[1:44:23] thunder they saw the lightning and you
[1:44:25] know what they said shut him up shut him
[1:44:28] up we're afraid of that
[1:44:30] let us let god speak through a prophet
[1:44:33] and that's when god spoke through moses
[1:44:38] hallelujah and that's that's how god
[1:44:41] speaks today
[1:44:43] hallelujah of the lord
[1:44:45] amen let's move on by god's grace
[1:44:48] i'm trying to set a foundation
[1:44:51] because if i can if i could just get us
[1:44:53] if if god could just allow us to say
[1:44:55] lord
[1:44:56] i really believe
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:00] but what hinders us is that we let our
[1:45:02] five senses
[1:45:04] get in the way
[1:45:06] we look at circumstances
[1:45:09] and you know that's not abraham's seed
[1:45:11] abraham seed called those things that be
[1:45:13] not as though they were hallelujah is
[1:45:17] that right
[1:45:18] see if you can see it you can receive it
[1:45:21] let me put it this way if you can see it
[1:45:23] you can have it
[1:45:25] hallelujah i'm not talking about seeing
[1:45:28] it with your uh yo yo how can i say it
[1:45:31] it must become real to you
[1:45:35] so much so that your vision can see it
[1:45:38] when you can see it
[1:45:40] you can have it
[1:45:42] see that's the thing what it is a lot of
[1:45:44] time people i want the holy ghost and
[1:45:45] many of us has never been to calvary go
[1:45:47] to calvary
[1:45:49] when you're praying go to calvary let
[1:45:52] him take you step by step
[1:45:55] take you through the crucifixion and i
[1:45:57] guarantee you you'll get something
[1:46:00] hello somebody if you can envision
[1:46:03] calvary if you can see jesus hallelujah
[1:46:06] you will get something
[1:46:08] and that would be the holy ghost
[1:46:11] hallelujah but a lot of time we we call
[1:46:14] on jesus because we want a sensation and
[1:46:16] that's uh that's all that all that's all
[1:46:18] good but that can be deceptive too
[1:46:21] deceiving too
[1:46:23] you want a change that's what i try to
[1:46:26] tell people we come to church for a
[1:46:29] change
[1:46:30] or change people it's good to have good
[1:46:33] times but we come for change change me
[1:46:37] oh god
[1:46:39] hallelujah changed me
[1:46:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:44] is that all right
[1:46:46] when i look and see what god has done
[1:46:50] let me move on and when god
[1:46:52] broke those seals open
[1:46:54] a lot of times people look at the cloud
[1:46:57] people fuss about it
[1:46:58] you know they say all manner of things
[1:47:00] and what people don't understand that
[1:47:02] was prophecy it was always in the word
[1:47:04] hallelujah but in that time it was a
[1:47:07] change
[1:47:09] god was moving on
[1:47:11] hallelujah don't get me wrong he never
[1:47:13] told you to stop shouting he never told
[1:47:15] you to stop dancing but he did tell you
[1:47:18] you must mature
[1:47:20] hallelujah that's what it was all about
[1:47:23] to take those pentecostal babies and
[1:47:26] bring them to a maturity until they come
[1:47:30] into the very image and likeness of god
[1:47:33] now everybody didn't see him then and
[1:47:35] everybody won't see him now
[1:47:38] hallelujah
[1:47:40] but in that time
[1:47:41] [Music]
[1:47:42] it was a historical time even the
[1:47:44] prophet god fully didn't even understand
[1:47:46] it at that time and as he went on he
[1:47:48] began to show us amen there was a
[1:47:50] serious thing that took place here
[1:47:52] people and you got to get it
[1:47:54] because listen you got to move on
[1:47:56] you got to move on and i'm not saying
[1:47:58] you're not there i'm just saying you got
[1:48:00] to move on if you're not there you
[1:48:02] understand what i'm saying it's not it's
[1:48:04] not good enough what what god is looking
[1:48:06] for he's looking for a perfect man
[1:48:11] with the divine nature of god
[1:48:14] hallelujah he's looking for a vessel
[1:48:17] that he can dwell in and speak through
[1:48:20] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:48:22] oh oh let me let me let me say it like
[1:48:24] this
[1:48:28] do you know
[1:48:29] let's say like this when a king orders
[1:48:32] something
[1:48:34] it it must come to pass
[1:48:37] it has to be
[1:48:40] obeyed
[1:48:42] now we've got all kinds of
[1:48:45] word all of the word in in the old in
[1:48:47] the old testament as well
[1:48:49] and and types and shadows and
[1:48:52] i never understood
[1:48:54] even in the day you know as it was in
[1:48:56] the days of noah
[1:48:58] you know when
[1:49:00] when that was read i i could always see
[1:49:03] the violence
[1:49:06] and all of the corrupt stuff that went
[1:49:08] in the day that was done in the days of
[1:49:10] noah
[1:49:12] but i i didn't see god
[1:49:16] and there he was he said when the son of
[1:49:18] man
[1:49:19] is revealed
[1:49:21] i'm not talking about a i'm talking
[1:49:22] about v
[1:49:24] right
[1:49:25] god
[1:49:26] hidden in human flesh
[1:49:31] hallelujah
[1:49:32] i remember driving one of my cars one
[1:49:34] time and i hired your plane and i always
[1:49:36] wondered if i was to get in a car
[1:49:38] accident or something would happen to me
[1:49:40] on on an instant where god where would
[1:49:43] god be
[1:49:44] but i could remember as i was turning
[1:49:46] the van was turning and i thought by
[1:49:48] god's grace i thought this 18-wheeler is
[1:49:50] going to hit me and i'm going to die but
[1:49:52] let me tell you something god is my
[1:49:54] witness when i thought that the holy
[1:49:57] spirit filled that place
[1:50:00] he said i'll never leave you
[1:50:04] i'll never forsake you y'all hear what
[1:50:06] i'm saying
[1:50:07] even in that time he showed up
[1:50:11] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:50:14] hallelujah
[1:50:16] we've got to arm ourselves with faith
[1:50:18] you got to know who you are
[1:50:20] everybody's so afraid of this corona and
[1:50:23] this whatever yes yes nobody want to
[1:50:25] catch the flu and i'm sure nobody wants
[1:50:27] to catch the measles
[1:50:30] but god still hears flu
[1:50:33] and he still can heal the measles
[1:50:36] and the bible said many are the
[1:50:38] afflictions of the righteous
[1:50:41] and god delivered them out of them all
[1:50:43] he does not say you won't get it but he
[1:50:46] said he'll be a deliverer
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:50:50] hallelujah and listen when you know god
[1:50:54] ain't through with you yet
[1:50:56] you've got every right to fight
[1:50:59] you hear what i'm saying
[1:51:01] don't lay down to the devil
[1:51:04] when you know god is not through with
[1:51:06] you yet you fight
[1:51:09] and god will join in the battle
[1:51:13] hallelujah
[1:51:16] yes let me tell you believe us
[1:51:18] satan is so afraid of you
[1:51:22] he is so afraid of you he is so afraid
[1:51:24] you're going to catch it
[1:51:26] well let me tell him wherever he might
[1:51:28] be
[1:51:29] hallelujah too late
[1:51:32] hallelujah
[1:51:33] why because it's been spoken
[1:51:36] it's already been spoken
[1:51:39] this bride will be the writer
[1:51:42] she is and will come into perfection
[1:51:46] hallelujah
[1:51:48] glory to god
[1:51:50] hallelujah i'm depending on him brother
[1:51:53] i have nothing else to rest on but i'm
[1:51:55] resting on his word
[1:51:57] he said it i believe it he made the
[1:52:00] promise
[1:52:02] hallelujah i have the victory in me
[1:52:06] i got the victory in me
[1:52:08] you know what the victory is
[1:52:09] is resurrection power
[1:52:14] the bible says
[1:52:17] they did eat
[1:52:19] they drank
[1:52:21] they married wives
[1:52:23] they were given in marriage
[1:52:25] until the day noah entered into the ark
[1:52:27] and where was god where was god
[1:52:31] you think god was in the heavens you
[1:52:33] think god was on the balcony somewhere
[1:52:35] i'll tell you where he was did y'all
[1:52:37] know where he was
[1:52:38] he was in the ark
[1:52:41] is that right
[1:52:42] if he was not in the ark he would say go
[1:52:45] in the ark
[1:52:47] but he was in the ark and he told noah
[1:52:50] come on in the yard
[1:52:53] oh come on somebody if he said come on
[1:52:55] in he must have been there too
[1:52:59] oh help us jesus
[1:53:02] so we understand that noah did not go
[1:53:05] through that rough time by himself
[1:53:09] people say how did noah bring animals in
[1:53:12] because during that time
[1:53:15] god took those animals and he listened
[1:53:18] this revelation he changed their nature
[1:53:23] so the lion could lay down with the lamb
[1:53:27] hallelujah
[1:53:28] y'all hear me
[1:53:30] let me say it like this when those seals
[1:53:32] were open
[1:53:34] john said i heard
[1:53:36] the voice and he thought it was a lion
[1:53:38] right but when he heard the lion the
[1:53:41] bible said he turned to see
[1:53:45] the voice
[1:53:46] and you know what he saw
[1:53:48] a lamb
[1:53:50] why did he see a lamb
[1:53:52] what was the purpose of the lamb
[1:53:55] because you were now entering into
[1:53:57] another age
[1:53:59] it wasn't just the eagle
[1:54:01] the lion
[1:54:03] the ox or the man
[1:54:05] now it's the age of the lamb
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:11] oh come on somebody
[1:54:13] the prophet of god preached it
[1:54:15] we're talking about the nature
[1:54:18] divine nature the divine nature was a
[1:54:20] lamb if a lamb gonna get married it'd
[1:54:23] have to marry a lamb
[1:54:25] it ain't marrying an iron it's not
[1:54:27] manner of an eagle
[1:54:30] the mate of a lion a lamb is a lamb
[1:54:34] hallelujah this is the age you must
[1:54:37] forfeit all of your rights
[1:54:45] oh help us lord
[1:54:47] is that the word
[1:54:49] people you must understand you got to
[1:54:51] forfeit all your rights
[1:54:54] lead me to calvary
[1:54:57] right
[1:54:58] lest i forget
[1:55:00] thou throne
[1:55:02] crown brow
[1:55:04] y'all understand me
[1:55:06] what we're now moving into
[1:55:09] is the changing of your nature from a
[1:55:12] goat to a lamb
[1:55:15] that's oh come on
[1:55:17] you say well what do you i'm just going
[1:55:19] to preach i'ma leave those notes alone
[1:55:20] you got to realize by god's grace
[1:55:24] that in this message this word is living
[1:55:27] you think oh i'm just reading a book
[1:55:29] maybe if you just with that attitude
[1:55:31] that's all you're reading
[1:55:33] but if you in the anointing
[1:55:36] the anointing that comes from those
[1:55:38] words will change you
[1:55:41] yes sir
[1:55:43] hallelujah you say well what do you mean
[1:55:45] remember
[1:55:47] when they took they took ammo's rod
[1:55:50] and what work did aaron have to the rod
[1:55:53] have to do
[1:55:54] once the rod was put behind the veil and
[1:55:57] that's what this message is this message
[1:56:00] is the word that's come from behind the
[1:56:02] veil
[1:56:03] that's the christ that's the eternal
[1:56:05] word y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:56:08] laid that rod out there and all that rod
[1:56:11] had to do was lay in the presence of the
[1:56:13] sun
[1:56:14] come on somebody that's why you must
[1:56:17] read that's why you must study that's
[1:56:19] why you must all come on and bring this
[1:56:22] with it
[1:56:26] hallelujah i was in my kitchen
[1:56:30] i can't remember what i was doing at the
[1:56:32] time sometimes the lord just talked to
[1:56:33] you
[1:56:35] before you say anything to him have you
[1:56:36] had
[1:56:37] you ever had
[1:56:38] he just starts the conversation
[1:56:42] oh come on somebody
[1:56:44] and jesus the lord said to me
[1:56:46] he said you are that book yes sir
[1:56:50] i couldn't understand it he said you are
[1:56:52] the book
[1:56:55] and i'm like

[1:57:11] where i'm coming from because i want you
[1:57:13] to understand
[1:57:15] once you
[1:57:16] take him in
[1:57:18] hallelujah you take in the full word
[1:57:22] that's why in the book of revelation he
[1:57:24] says i am the alpha and the omega
[1:57:28] i'm the beginning and i'm the end
[1:57:31] you take in the full word and when you
[1:57:33] take in the full word you have the full
[1:57:36] abilities you have the potential of the
[1:57:40] whole book
[1:57:43] hallelujah
[1:57:44] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:57:46] why death won't be able to hold my body
[1:57:49] down
[1:57:51] hallelujah why because we have the
[1:57:53] resurrection on the inside
[1:57:56] oh you say well show me a shout show me
[1:57:58] something here remember
[1:58:01] remember
[1:58:02] throughout the church ages i'm kind of
[1:58:03] jumping here throughout the church ages
[1:58:06] all the way up from if ephesus the the
[1:58:08] word of prophecy says i'm coming i'm
[1:58:10] coming i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do
[1:58:11] that i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that
[1:58:13] but in laodicea
[1:58:15] it wasn't so
[1:58:17] he says i now stand
[1:58:19] at the door and knock
[1:58:21] hallelujah so he's no longer in heaven
[1:58:25] he's come
[1:58:26] and he's standing at the door to knock
[1:58:28] and he said brother lam said it like
[1:58:30] this it was a knock into the church ages
[1:58:33] is that right and if any man open
[1:58:36] i will come in and sup with him come
[1:58:39] anywhere to your heart
[1:58:42] into your soul in there is where i come
[1:58:45] and i'll sup
[1:58:46] oh come on somebody that is the word
[1:58:50] hallelujah so we thank god for every
[1:58:53] building that we have that we assembly
[1:58:56] symbol in but in reality you are the
[1:58:59] church
[1:59:01] you're the tabernacle of god
[1:59:04] that's the bible says that know ye not
[1:59:07] that you are the temple of god
[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:12] amen
[1:59:14] getting back all that rod had to do was
[1:59:17] lay there
[1:59:18] hallelujah
[1:59:20] and i love this
[1:59:22] because you know
[1:59:23] we found out that in there
[1:59:26] was the bride
[1:59:28] because you got a female tree
[1:59:32] and you got a male tree
[1:59:34] and the female tree is the one that
[1:59:35] brings forth the fruits
[1:59:39] aaron had no idea
[1:59:41] that he was working with a female
[1:59:47] he had no idea that that rod was a
[1:59:50] symbolism of the bride
[1:59:52] you hear what i'm saying
[1:59:54] all they had to do was lay in the
[1:59:56] shekinah glory
[1:59:58] and god did the rest yes
[2:00:02] you hear what i'm saying your lord i
[2:00:04] want to overcome lay in the presence
[2:00:07] lay there
[2:00:09] cry out
[2:00:11] pray
[2:00:12] let those men the ministry of the voice
[2:00:14] of that's in the voice off the tape let
[2:00:17] them minister you let your pastor
[2:00:19] minister you that's god laying in lane
[2:00:24] you know what i'm saying let me tell you
[2:00:26] something some of y'all who i don't like
[2:00:27] chewing gum but some do
[2:00:30] hallelujah and you don't you don't throw
[2:00:32] the gum away right off
[2:00:34] you get all the juices out
[2:00:38] all the sweetness and sometimes you even
[2:00:41] carry it on when it ain't sweet
[2:00:43] because you just love the way it pops
[2:00:48] hallelujah you understand me that's the
[2:00:50] way the word
[2:00:52] you're supposed to chew on the word like
[2:00:55] a cow with this cud

[2:01:03] right
[2:01:04] when somebody's looking at you and you
[2:01:06] haven't been to church in a while but
[2:01:08] you're still chewing
[2:01:11] hallelujah you see what i'm saying
[2:01:13] circumstances have stopped you from
[2:01:16] coming to church but you've got enough
[2:01:17] in you where you can bring it all
[2:01:19] remember what pastor said oh remember
[2:01:21] what the word says oh you see

[2:02:28] message before i knew
[2:02:30] anything about creation i wish the
[2:02:31] sisters still live but she's going on to
[2:02:33] be with glory i trust
[2:02:35] you know but the thing is i needed just
[2:02:37] a little bit of money
[2:02:39] and uh anyway to make a long story short
[2:02:42] we were down in the basement of the
[2:02:44] church
[2:02:45] and i was just talking and telling the
[2:02:47] sister i needed a money to put in the
[2:02:50] phone booth y'all remember phone booths
[2:02:52] yeah i didn't have change for the phone
[2:02:54] booth
[2:02:55] and
[2:02:56] all of a sudden this light the light
[2:02:59] roll out of the corner it rolled this
[2:03:01] way and it rolled and it rolled and it
[2:03:04] rolled in like a like a corn and it
[2:03:06] stopped and when it stopped it was money
[2:03:10] enough to put in the phone booth
[2:03:14] i didn't know nothing about no creation
[2:03:16] i didn't know
[2:03:17] but he was still creator
[2:03:20] i was in a system didn't know but i
[2:03:22] believe god
[2:03:24] y'all hear what i'm saying like my
[2:03:26] sister was talking about the gate opener
[2:03:27] i believe that
[2:03:29] right you see things that and god does
[2:03:32] things and and sometimes we're so busy
[2:03:34] we don't catch it
[2:03:36] hallelujah but in everything give thanks
[2:03:41] y'all hear me so i know what god can do
[2:03:44] i've seen him create i've seen him raise
[2:03:47] the dead twice
[2:03:49] hallelujah being in this message
[2:03:51] believing this word i saw jesus come on
[2:03:55] the scene
[2:03:56] oh come on you don't have to believe it
[2:03:59] hallelujah but i'ma tell you what the
[2:04:01] true bride of christ she knows when her
[2:04:03] husband is talking
[2:04:07] oh
[2:04:08] as it was in the days of noah i i just
[2:04:11] let me out this is the point i want to
[2:04:12] say
[2:04:13] remember
[2:04:14] the denominations had crucified the lord
[2:04:17] afresh
[2:04:18] is that right
[2:04:20] so much so he was put out
[2:04:22] now if he was crucified that means
[2:04:24] there had to come a resurrection
[2:04:27] a death burial and resurrection
[2:04:30] and this is why brother branham preached
[2:04:32] the message it is the rising of the son
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:38] oh god
[2:04:40] now
[2:04:42] something took place
[2:04:45] because after
[2:04:47] he preached it
[2:04:52] there was a rising
[2:04:55] there was a ministry change
[2:04:57] you understand me
[2:04:59] something took place
[2:05:03] because once
[2:05:04] it was an open show
[2:05:07] when jesus was alive
[2:05:10] it was an open show
[2:05:12] the pharisees the sadducees the baptists
[2:05:15] the methods
[2:05:16] everybody saw what god was doing
[2:05:20] and they call it a devil
[2:05:22] they crucified him
[2:05:24] is that right all right
[2:05:26] but after he died
[2:05:29] oh jesus
[2:05:31] he didn't show himself to everybody
[2:05:37] he didn't show himself to everybody
[2:05:39] he never went back
[2:05:42] he never did go back to the to the
[2:05:44] pharisees and the sadducees and all that
[2:05:48] but it went to those who believed
[2:05:52] and he proved to them he already told
[2:05:54] him now i'm gonna rise again
[2:05:56] he's here
[2:05:58] y'all understand me
[2:06:00] but what is he doing he's building the
[2:06:03] people's faith
[2:06:05] and what is the point what is he
[2:06:06] bringing to them to rig for them for
[2:06:09] them to fully recognize let's jump let's
[2:06:11] jump let's jump to
[2:06:13] to thomas thomas says i'm not going to
[2:06:15] believe
[2:06:18] he said i ain't believing
[2:06:22] you're not going to make me believe it
[2:06:23] y'all crazy people i ain't believing it
[2:06:26] that's what he said
[2:06:30] jesus being the door
[2:06:32] didn't need a door
[2:06:34] so he walked
[2:06:35] because he was the door
[2:06:38] y'all hear me
[2:06:40] he walked through the wall
[2:06:42] and the first person he came to
[2:06:45] thomas
[2:06:47] see god knows you
[2:06:48] i read it
[2:06:51] he knows your thoughts are far off
[2:06:54] he knows whether you're a believer or
[2:06:55] not
[2:06:57] but he don't throw you away if you don't
[2:06:59] believe
[2:07:00] why especially if you're elected
[2:07:03] god couldn't do without thomas
[2:07:05] why because thomas represents somebody
[2:07:08] in here
[2:07:11] hallelujah thomas said if i was just
[2:07:13] stressing my hand to his side now thomas
[2:07:15] really went overboard
[2:07:16] [Laughter]
[2:07:19] hallelujah he wasn't thinking about the
[2:07:20] man's feelings was he
[2:07:23] if i could just stretch my hand into
[2:07:24] decided to my hands in his womb he said
[2:07:26] did i believe
[2:07:28] oh lord can you imagine the
[2:07:30] embarrassment
[2:07:32] and jesus walked up to him and says
[2:07:34] thomas
[2:07:36] here's my side
[2:07:37] thrust your
[2:07:42] thrust your hands in there thomas feel
[2:07:45] that i'm alive thomas
[2:07:47] hallelujah if you don't believe me now
[2:07:50] give me some fish and bread
[2:07:54] y'all hear me
[2:07:56] amen and thomas got the greatest of all
[2:07:58] revelation my lord and my god
[2:08:03] and he said blessed are those who have
[2:08:06] not seen but yet believe
[2:08:09] hallelujah
[2:08:13] so you were perfect
[2:08:15] you're perfectly in his purpose
[2:08:18] because you came after william branham
[2:08:22] you came after god used him as a son of
[2:08:25] man
[2:08:26] hallelujah you have not seen it but you
[2:08:29] believe it
[2:08:31] and so listen when the devil said oh you
[2:08:33] do something wrong with you you you
[2:08:35] following a cult telling you following
[2:08:37] one
[2:08:38] and everybody that follow you is one
[2:08:43] hallelujah but you see i'm not married
[2:08:45] to a system
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:48] and ain't no system gonna ever dictate
[2:08:50] to me again
[2:08:52] somebody help me here
[2:08:54] when i get ready to praise god i'm
[2:08:56] praising the way i want to

[2:09:36] people have systems

[2:09:43] hmm
[2:09:44] glory and now we cleaning our necks
[2:09:50] i'm off on subject now
[2:09:53] but what i'm trying to say he whom the
[2:09:55] son is set free
[2:09:57] is free indeed
[2:10:01] hallelujah
[2:10:02] is that right
[2:10:04] amen i have a sister in lima ohio she
[2:10:06] called me shouting john y'all don't
[2:10:08] heard the story of shouting john
[2:10:09] shouting john was an old man amen that
[2:10:12] loved to worship the lord hallelujah and
[2:10:15] and it got so bad
[2:10:17] until his church put him out because he
[2:10:19] used to shout too much
[2:10:22] and uh but they had to go by the house
[2:10:24] go by his house to tell him and he was
[2:10:26] old big farmer you know what i'm saying
[2:10:28] he had all of the cows and the ducks and
[2:10:30] the chickens and everything you know he
[2:10:31] had all the great things and he had
[2:10:33] children
[2:10:35] and so
[2:10:36] john because he was a spiritual man
[2:10:37] shouting john said well i know
[2:10:39] why you come
[2:10:41] you come to put me out
[2:10:43] you trying to tell me that i can't
[2:10:45] worship my god he said see all the
[2:10:47] things god brought bless me with he
[2:10:49] don't bless me with children he give me
[2:10:51] my house he did me all of these things
[2:10:53] he said and you think that i'm going to
[2:10:56] stop praising him because you feel like
[2:10:59] i shouldn't
[2:11:01] you know you know what john said he said
[2:11:03] hold my mule
[2:11:09] [Applause]
[2:11:11] hallelujah
[2:11:12] that's what i'm talking about
[2:11:15] i'm going to shout if i'm not here in
[2:11:17] your church i'm going to praise him
[2:11:19] hallelujah now anyhow let's move on so
[2:11:22] he comes and begins to show himself and
[2:11:24] this is what this message is doing
[2:11:26] the message is revealing jesus christ
[2:11:28] for your day
[2:11:29] he's trying to show you who you are
[2:11:33] right
[2:11:34] because now he comes and
[2:11:36] um don't worry about it
[2:11:39] peter show up
[2:11:43] because peter denied him
[2:11:45] cursed him and everything else we got
[2:11:48] peters in this message
[2:11:49] so i'm done backslid and going backwards
[2:11:52] but god said i can't move without him
[2:11:53] until he come back
[2:11:56] y'all hear what i'm saying you don't
[2:11:58] give up on your own
[2:11:59] you might not know who they are but hold
[2:12:01] fast
[2:12:03] y'all better hear what i'm saying
[2:12:05] i don't care what the devil has done
[2:12:07] maybe they are peter but god said when
[2:12:10] this gathering come when we get ready
[2:12:12] amen for a translation peter's got to be
[2:12:15] there
[2:12:17] [Applause]
[2:12:23] i know
[2:12:24] some of us will judge it and give up on
[2:12:26] them
[2:12:26] don't you do that
[2:12:28] hallelujah god's mercy and grace is
[2:12:30] beyond you
[2:12:32] huh now tell me the bible said that paul
[2:12:36] even swore and blasphemed
[2:12:38] and he was an angel of the lord
[2:12:40] because truly so you can understand the
[2:12:43] true election cannot baste
[2:12:46] because god elected and chosen them
[2:12:49] predestinated them sealed them or
[2:12:50] whatever you want to say it before the
[2:12:52] foundation of the world
[2:12:55] i don't understand it but that's what he
[2:12:57] said
[2:13:00] absolutely
[2:13:03] you love the lord i feel like i've gone
[2:13:05] a little bit too long but let me move on
[2:13:07] by god's grace
[2:13:09] seven days so what happens
[2:13:11] god is now revealing himself to his
[2:13:13] bride his bride amen one thing he said
[2:13:17] so you can understand with marrying him
[2:13:18] just why seeketh you the dead
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:23] why seek you the living among the dead
[2:13:26] right
[2:13:28] y'all hear what i'm saying why seek you
[2:13:30] the living
[2:13:32] among the dead
[2:13:33] so people you can't allow this church
[2:13:36] or this assembly to become a mortuary
[2:13:42] hallelujah and i'm talking i'm talking
[2:13:44] about life now real life
[2:13:47] i'm not talking about all that other
[2:13:49] stuff i'm talking about real life
[2:13:53] because that's what the devil is afraid
[2:13:54] of he's afraid of your life is that
[2:13:57] right
[2:13:58] is that right
[2:13:59] listen he wasn't afraid of jesus the man
[2:14:02] legion but when legion saw the character
[2:14:06] and saw the light or the illumination of
[2:14:08] god flowing through that natural body he
[2:14:11] said oh have you come to torment me
[2:14:14] before my time
[2:14:17] did you get it
[2:14:18] and you and jesus is one
[2:14:21] [Applause]
[2:14:22] somebody help me here you see what i'm
[2:14:24] saying that's why i said the devil is
[2:14:26] afraid of you especially when he sees
[2:14:29] the character of christ
[2:14:31] living in you
[2:14:35] oh glory to god
[2:14:37] hallelujah
[2:14:38] absolutely there is no losing for you
[2:14:42] you can't lose
[2:14:46] hey they probably laughed at noah says
[2:14:48] noah
[2:14:49] you've got the worst wood there was
[2:14:52] or is and you said telling me
[2:14:55] hallelujah that time there's coming some
[2:14:57] great flood
[2:14:59] hallelujah and they didn't know what
[2:15:00] rain was you know that right they had no
[2:15:03] idea like i like the prophet god said he
[2:15:05] was speaking in tongues they didn't know
[2:15:10] hallelujah
[2:15:11] but when it started raining
[2:15:13] it was revealed
[2:15:17] you love the lord
[2:15:19] god is good right
[2:15:22] listen what the prophet said
[2:15:23] this is the greatest hour that the
[2:15:25] church has ever moved into
[2:15:28] just before the coming of the bride crew
[2:15:31] that's what i'm trying to say and every
[2:15:32] one of us are feeling it
[2:15:35] the world is falling apart it's never
[2:15:38] been so dark
[2:15:39] right sometimes it's so bad you know if
[2:15:42] you didn't know that you were bride you
[2:15:43] would think have i missed it
[2:15:46] you know what i'm saying and it's moving
[2:15:49] so you christians will understand
[2:15:52] you think
[2:15:53] this is just about politics
[2:15:57] this is a religious battle
[2:16:01] lucifer
[2:16:03] the devil himself
[2:16:05] is anointing people
[2:16:08] and the whole gathering together is
[2:16:10] against a true christian
[2:16:15] hallelujah it's not about republicans
[2:16:18] it's not about democrats it's all about
[2:16:20] the christians
[2:16:23] you better hear what i'm saying
[2:16:25] this thing is going to swing
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:29] is y'all hear me
[2:16:31] now a lot of republicans are christians
[2:16:33] but all republicans are christians
[2:16:35] but then anybody that stands for
[2:16:37] christianity they labor you republican

[2:16:58] my people
[2:17:00] they've been so deceived
[2:17:04] my son would have won the lawsuit thing
[2:17:07] he was going but he he mentioned he was
[2:17:09] a christian
[2:17:11] some sort
[2:17:12] and because the judge was a liberal
[2:17:15] he shut him down
[2:17:18] see they're the enemy
[2:17:20] y'all understand what i'm saying i'm not
[2:17:22] i'm talking about the spirit of that
[2:17:24] thing
[2:17:27] and you better understand when this
[2:17:29] thing whirl around is going to happen so
[2:17:31] fast
[2:17:34] do you all know what they're doing in

[2:17:37] you've seen how they built the little
[2:17:38] camps and everything and they they're
[2:17:40] you know just the other day they they
[2:17:42] were tasing this 12 year old girl
[2:17:44] because she didn't have on a mask

[2:18:09] your tests
[2:18:12] the alpha has become the omega
[2:18:15] the lamb must be a lamb
[2:18:18] and brother branham said that jesus
[2:18:20] christ defeated savior
[2:18:23] satan at calvary through sweetness and
[2:18:26] meekness
[2:18:30] he didn't get angry
[2:18:32] he could have spoke the word
[2:18:35] it would have finished it hallelujah but
[2:18:39] he suffered
[2:18:40] and this is what a lot of americans we
[2:18:42] don't know nothing about suffering
[2:18:45] hallelujah but this is your day and you
[2:18:48] need to get enough holy ghosts
[2:18:51] because that's the only thing that's
[2:18:52] going to carry you through hallelujah
[2:18:54] the holy spirit
[2:18:56] he that begun the good work in you is
[2:19:00] faithful to complete it he has promised
[2:19:03] it and it will and shall be done
[2:19:06] [Applause]
[2:19:08] oh the greatest hour that the church has
[2:19:10] ever moved into just before the coming
[2:19:13] of the bridegroom oh the real church of
[2:19:16] the living god ought to be on fire
[2:19:20] not woe is me
[2:19:22] oh lord i'm going through so much lord
[2:19:29] what's wrong with you
[2:19:31] you ought to be shouting down hallelujah
[2:19:34] boulevard
[2:19:36] hallelujah because you know and this is
[2:19:38] what people don't understand this is the
[2:19:39] message
[2:19:40] you don't even see it
[2:19:42] but you're being changed
[2:19:46] already hallelujah and what the change
[2:19:49] is given to you i don't care how many
[2:19:52] vaccinations you take it'll never stop
[2:19:55] the change
[2:19:57] yeah i mean this is a supernatural
[2:20:00] change that's taken listen it will not
[2:20:03] hinder those that are asleep
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:07] so god right now
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:10] it's changing you molecularly i wish i
[2:20:13] had a word i do have it but i don't have
[2:20:15] it with me he's changing you and you
[2:20:17] don't even know it
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:19] something is moving now and you got to
[2:20:21] know it
[2:20:22] something in you is it's loving god more
[2:20:25] now than ever
[2:20:27] y'all hear me
[2:20:29] and you're not doing it it's something
[2:20:31] that's craving it's a craving it's a
[2:20:33] craving and you can't say you can't stop
[2:20:35] it it seemed to get more and more and
[2:20:37] more but that same craving will take you
[2:20:40] where you need to be
[2:20:42] because the deep called to the deep and
[2:20:44] there is a deep to respond
[2:20:48] that's why you're feeling more sinful
[2:20:50] that's why you think yourself to be
[2:20:52] nothing and all of that is good because
[2:20:55] as you scroll in god the more evil
[2:20:58] you'll see yourself as being
[2:21:02] thank god for the change of the body
[2:21:06] hallelujah
[2:21:11] i wish they could take an x-ray of me
[2:21:12] and see jesus in there
[2:21:16] he's there
[2:21:17] he's in another dimension
[2:21:20] but he's there
[2:21:22] hallelujah can i have a few more minutes
[2:21:24] hallelujah so you understand by god's
[2:21:27] grace i've jumped a little bit of every
[2:21:29] place but i want you to understand that
[2:21:31] what was happening
[2:21:32] even in noah's day he says come on in
[2:21:34] the ark seven more days
[2:21:36] and you know the seven is always the
[2:21:38] type of the seven church ages and stuff
[2:21:40] like that
[2:21:43] but there was silence
[2:21:47] and whatever god was doing in those
[2:21:49] seven days only noah and the animals
[2:21:51] knew
[2:21:54] no more preaching
[2:21:55] it was no longer an open show
[2:21:59] they were sealed in
[2:22:01] and god sealed them in
[2:22:03] oh don't you understand what i'm saying
[2:22:05] once you get that sealed he's the one
[2:22:08] who's changing you
[2:22:10] like he did the aaron's rock you hear
[2:22:12] what i'm saying
[2:22:13] he's changing you from glory to glory
[2:22:17] right did y'all know that
[2:22:19] even noah's at the situation of noah was
[2:22:21] a death barrier and resurrection how
[2:22:23] many all knew that
[2:22:24] hallelujah
[2:22:26] and when he rose he came up out of that
[2:22:28] ark he came to see a new land
[2:22:31] so understand when when christ being in
[2:22:34] here he's oh yes we're going to see him
[2:22:38] we will see him
[2:22:40] did y'all know that
[2:22:41] amen but everybody won't
[2:22:45] everybody won't see him
[2:22:46] but first of all you got to see him in
[2:22:48] you
[2:22:50] hallelujah did you know that your life
[2:22:52] is supposed to be so much like christ
[2:22:54] that when people see you they said oh
[2:22:56] that he just like jesus
[2:22:58] she's just like chill
[2:23:00] [Music]
[2:23:01] that's the word
[2:23:05] hallelujah you say oh my yes they were
[2:23:08] called christians
[2:23:10] first at antioch
[2:23:14] you love the lord
[2:23:17] you know it's amazing
[2:23:19] because people don't realize i'm gonna
[2:23:21] say if this is the people who coming you
[2:23:23] it's it's so much later than what you
[2:23:25] think
[2:23:27] and for god to call anybody right now
[2:23:29] it's a miracle
[2:23:31] it's a wonderful miracle
[2:23:33] because you kind of like the one coming
[2:23:35] at the end but you get everything else
[2:23:36] everybody that went through
[2:23:38] but so lo so that you know this is the
[2:23:41] truth
[2:23:42] i've seen it i've seen it work
[2:23:44] and why everybody else in religion and
[2:23:46] everything else while they're over there
[2:23:48] you know and i thank god for his mercy
[2:23:50] and grace toward all of us
[2:23:52] because if all of us at one point we
[2:23:54] didn't see
[2:23:55] we didn't know
[2:23:56] i didn't even know god was supposed to
[2:23:58] send a prophet
[2:23:59] i didn't know none of that stuff i
[2:24:01] didn't know there was a revealed word i
[2:24:03] did not there are things and you know
[2:24:05] what
[2:24:06] grace to me was like hope
[2:24:10] it was like hope
[2:24:12] i saw where he didn't strike me down and
[2:24:14] i was hoping that he wouldn't
[2:24:18] you know and you look at this thing he
[2:24:20] says look the darkness is gathering this
[2:24:22] is what i'm trying if i could
[2:24:24] gain the picture take noah's day you and
[2:24:27] i would have never thought the world
[2:24:28] would be the way it is
[2:24:30] we knew the rapture was going to take
[2:24:31] place but we didn't understand that the
[2:24:33] revealing of god would come at a time
[2:24:35] when it'd be so dark
[2:24:36] is that right
[2:24:38] genesis darkness cover the face of the
[2:24:40] earth
[2:24:42] it was everything was void
[2:24:44] then god said let there be light
[2:24:47] you are the light of the world
[2:24:50] this is the this is the light that god
[2:24:51] is now speaking into existence and you
[2:24:54] are the ones that is supposed to bring
[2:24:56] this thing in order
[2:25:00] you understand me
[2:25:01] so being the light of god
[2:25:04] you show people this is what i love
[2:25:06] about the message because in the message
[2:25:08] you see a real men and you see real
[2:25:10] women
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:15] you know i thought the sisters would
[2:25:16] give a bigger amen than that
[2:25:20] i know you're getting tired but you know
[2:25:22] yeah yes yes yes you're the real thing
[2:25:27] hey he
[2:25:29] y'all she was out there
[2:25:31] who would have thought
[2:25:33] and i don't criticize him i feel sorry
[2:25:36] my heart goes out
[2:25:38] you know they don't know any better
[2:25:41] you think oh they should but i didn't
[2:25:43] when i had that big old afro and all
[2:25:45] those
[2:25:46] psychedelic colors i didn't
[2:25:50] know it's the truth and then they had us
[2:25:53] on with the big old platforms
[2:25:56] you know what that was it was
[2:25:57] high-heeled shoes
[2:26:06] and then you had a cake cutter for a pig
[2:26:11] we didn't know
[2:26:13] we thought that was cool
[2:26:16] man that was in
[2:26:18] yeah
[2:26:19] it wasn't in god for sure y'all know
[2:26:22] what i'm saying
[2:26:23] they i tell you i didn't know they
[2:26:25] didn't they don't know so don't ever
[2:26:27] look at them like oh there's a shame
[2:26:29] they shouldn't do that but they don't
[2:26:31] know
[2:26:33] they don't have a bible
[2:26:34] they don't have nothing godly to look to
[2:26:37] you understand me they just don't know
[2:26:40] and your soul you should pity them and
[2:26:42] really go after them
[2:26:44] [Music]
[2:26:45] you see a person that's tattooed all up
[2:26:48] he's looking for something
[2:26:50] he's very unhappy he's he's he's mocking
[2:26:53] himself that's a sign that i need
[2:26:56] somebody to help me
[2:26:58] is that right
[2:27:00] look at legion he was cutting himself
[2:27:02] amen full of devils and he needed jesus
[2:27:06] hallelujah
[2:27:08] and let me tell you until you get to the
[2:27:10] place to see yourself as being him
[2:27:13] you're bad past people but when you see
[2:27:16] that jesus was a savior you become a
[2:27:18] savior
[2:27:21] y'all know what i'm saying if we're
[2:27:23] going to be born of his bone and flesh
[2:27:24] of his flesh we must be as he is and
[2:27:28] that's what he told his disciples he
[2:27:29] said i'm endowing you with power and go
[2:27:32] into all the world
[2:27:33] to save them
[2:27:35] from what unbelief
[2:27:37] when they see jesus in you they'll know
[2:27:40] he's real
[2:27:42] oh god help me i'm almost done
[2:27:45] i've jumped but that's okay i'm always
[2:27:48] i'm almost done
[2:27:50] hallelujah let me just read this
[2:27:52] and then we'll
[2:27:53] move on
[2:27:56] god is so good to us
[2:27:59] and i know i'm throwing out everything
[2:28:00] and i trust that you the holy spirit
[2:28:02] will pull it all together for you
[2:28:05] because uh we're living at a time when
[2:28:08] when when these uh
[2:28:10] the bride the bride so let me say it
[2:28:13] like this remember the story the prophet
[2:28:14] of god gives about the ranch's son
[2:28:17] right
[2:28:18] and the one that
[2:28:19] was cousin to the the denominations
[2:28:22] yeah and uh
[2:28:24] here she was a simple little girl
[2:28:27] in her proper place
[2:28:30] working her purpose
[2:28:33] and he watched he's up on the fence
[2:28:36] and he's watching her
[2:28:38] throw kitchen water
[2:28:42] the dishwater out
[2:28:44] and he's watching her character the
[2:28:45] whole time
[2:28:47] now just by watching her he decides
[2:28:50] that's the kind of weapon i'm looking
[2:28:52] for
[2:28:53] now god has made it plain to us
[2:28:56] he's not looking for those who's got to
[2:28:57] have a new hairdo every night
[2:28:59] every day with all of the other
[2:29:01] fandangos that goes with it
[2:29:03] you know what i'm saying you don't have
[2:29:04] to glitter and glow
[2:29:09] he want that simple woman that knows
[2:29:11] love being a woman
[2:29:15] you understand me so he want that kind
[2:29:17] and and and he's watching her
[2:29:20] and he falls in love with her
[2:29:25] that's about us you know
[2:29:28] y'all know my testimony
[2:29:30] the lord showed me who my wife was we
[2:29:32] never dated or anything i never kissed
[2:29:34] her until he said you can kiss the bride
[2:29:36] we never were alone in our coat ship
[2:29:39] ever
[2:29:41] i got off my knees i went and asked her
[2:29:44] to marry me she said brother brooks
[2:29:46] minister brooks
[2:29:48] don't be playing with me
[2:29:52] i said i'm not playing with you
[2:29:54] god showed me that was my bride i didn't
[2:29:56] have to worry about all the other stuff
[2:29:59] we've been married 44 years or 45 how
[2:30:02] many years has been
[2:30:06] hallelujah
[2:30:07] you understand what i'm saying
[2:30:10] when god show you who your wife is you
[2:30:12] don't have to
[2:30:14] figure it out or even test it
[2:30:18] y'all know what i'm saying it's the
[2:30:20] truth you know and
[2:30:22] and what what i'm saying to the sisters
[2:30:24] listen this little girl you know she was
[2:30:26] out there and um he proposed this to her
[2:30:29] now this message always is a proposal
[2:30:33] it's an invitation
[2:30:34] to to be my bride
[2:30:37] and it's up to you to accept it
[2:30:39] right
[2:30:40] and so
[2:30:42] first of all she says not me
[2:30:45] see when you hear this message and you
[2:30:47] don't judge yourself as being nothing
[2:30:51] something's wrong
[2:30:53] because you can't come help it
[2:30:56] it comes to help you
[2:30:57] [Music]
[2:30:59] and so she said oh me who am i who am i
[2:31:01] you know god
[2:31:03] and how many times you in prayer are you
[2:31:04] still thinking that how who am i
[2:31:08] why would you choose me brother that's
[2:31:10] right
[2:31:11] knowing what i yes thank god for the
[2:31:14] blood
[2:31:16] but anyhow
[2:31:18] she took his word
[2:31:20] now
[2:31:21] can i say it like this she was in the
[2:31:23] backyard
[2:31:24] on the back side of the house on the
[2:31:26] back side of the book
[2:31:31] and what was going on with her
[2:31:34] all of the world all of the christendom
[2:31:36] had no idea
[2:31:38] they couldn't see it
[2:31:40] so what happens
[2:31:42] she began to tell it
[2:31:45] and she prepared herself
[2:31:47] taking her little knuckles and dimes you
[2:31:49] know what i'm what that means she's
[2:31:50] praying she's fasting she's she's doing
[2:31:52] spiritual things you know it's not money
[2:31:55] but she she's preparing herself she's
[2:31:58] buying her garment
[2:32:00] she adding faith virtue knowledge
[2:32:02] temperance all those things
[2:32:04] right
[2:32:05] and guess what
[2:32:07] she was ready before he got there
[2:32:11] people think oh with the squeeze come
[2:32:12] i'm gonna get ready you better be ready
[2:32:14] before the squeeze comes
[2:32:18] right
[2:32:19] because listen
[2:32:20] when the squeeze come
[2:32:22] let him that be filthy filthy
[2:32:25] he that holy holy
[2:32:26] is that right oh come on it's the truth
[2:32:29] listen
[2:32:30] when that door in noah's day shut it was
[2:32:34] too late
[2:32:36] hallelujah the prophet god said it was
[2:32:38] like the rain when the rain stopped
[2:32:40] falling it was too late when the
[2:32:43] persecution starts squeezing it's too
[2:32:45] late
[2:32:48] people do you hear
[2:32:49] it's too late then now is the time
[2:32:53] why do you think listen it's the truth i
[2:32:55] tell people this everywhere i go i say
[2:32:57] never in the history of the world has a
[2:33:00] world has ever been shut down like egypt
[2:33:04] and the reason why it was shut down in
[2:33:06] egypt is to make sure that the blood and
[2:33:09] the lentil was placed on the doorpost
[2:33:12] make sure you say this is your period of
[2:33:14] grace
[2:33:18] during the times of plagues and
[2:33:19] everything else
[2:33:21] god shut down egypt
[2:33:22] now god shuts down the world because of
[2:33:24] pledge and this is the reason why to
[2:33:27] make sure
[2:33:28] you must make sure that the blood of
[2:33:30] jesus christ has been applied
[2:33:32] [Music]
[2:33:33] hear what i'm saying
[2:33:35] so anyhow you look at this thing you say
[2:33:37] well brother what are you saying i'm
[2:33:38] trying to tell us
[2:33:40] it's later than what we think
[2:33:42] don't ever listen
[2:33:45] don't ever think that you're a loser
[2:33:48] don't ever let the devil think that
[2:33:49] you're a failure you can't fail if
[2:33:51] you're in christ
[2:33:53] he's a winner but you need to use what
[2:33:55] you know you got
[2:33:58] right
[2:33:58] you you use what you have on the inside
[2:34:01] like david he didn't have number one
[2:34:03] little revelation and that was jesus
[2:34:05] christ it's the same yesterday forever
[2:34:07] and he took that thing and he slew the
[2:34:09] giant it ain't about all you know it's
[2:34:12] who you know and who knows you
[2:34:15] right so i'm shutting down now
[2:34:18] but i i i know i'm missing something but
[2:34:20] i'll pick it up later by god's grace but
[2:34:22] i'm trying to tell the people of god
[2:34:24] you're more than a winner
[2:34:26] but listen you can practice all you want
[2:34:29] religion
[2:34:31] it won't help you
[2:34:34] you need
[2:34:35] the holy ghost
[2:34:39] the holy ghost is the one only one that
[2:34:41] can change you
[2:34:43] oh it's true when i was in the apostolic
[2:34:45] church i knew
[2:34:46] you know what i mean i i did everything
[2:34:48] they say do
[2:34:50] i did it
[2:34:53] and i knew god was with me
[2:34:55] and i'm saying to everybody in here you
[2:34:57] came here because god is with you
[2:35:00] god pulled you here
[2:35:02] that's god
[2:35:04] hallelujah millions of people would love
[2:35:07] to hear this word but god chose you
[2:35:11] hallelujah i said lord why did you let
[2:35:13] me waste god didn't waste you didn't
[2:35:15] waste nothing god preserved you
[2:35:18] that's god
[2:35:19] no matter where you were god preserved
[2:35:22] you
[2:35:24] [Applause]
[2:35:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:35:29] and he made you faithful
[2:35:32] he made this is why you hear because you
[2:35:34] love the word
[2:35:35] holy we may not have understood
[2:35:37] everything but we loved him
[2:35:39] and he knows you love him and that's why
[2:35:41] he's got you here
[2:35:43] hallelujah don't feel bad god did it
[2:35:46] hallelujah god has done this thing the
[2:35:49] thing that i'm looking at is that we're
[2:35:51] getting ready to embrace a translation
[2:35:54] did y'all know that hallelujah everybody
[2:35:57] can't see like you see
[2:35:59] now you got eyes to see things they
[2:36:01] can't see
[2:36:03] hallelujah oh lord have mercy
[2:36:07] hallelujah is that right everybody
[2:36:09] didn't see the dead raised
[2:36:12] when jesus got up out of the ground
[2:36:13] everybody didn't see it
[2:36:15] hallelujah
[2:36:17] and then you know you think about it
[2:36:19] jesus could be sitting right up in here
[2:36:20] and you won't even notice him
[2:36:22] he walked on the road to amaze with
[2:36:24] those disciples and they didn't even
[2:36:25] know who he was
[2:36:27] hallelujah but as he began to preach
[2:36:29] what did he do that seventh seed which
[2:36:31] was christ he opened that word and he
[2:36:34] began from genesis
[2:36:35] through the prophecy and he began to
[2:36:36] preach who jesus
[2:36:39] you hear what i'm saying he preached
[2:36:41] jesus
[2:36:42] let me say it like this it's it's beyond
[2:36:45] god sent a prophet he preached jesus
[2:36:49] you better hear what i'm saying
[2:36:51] a true mouth transfiguration experience
[2:36:55] will only glorify jesus christ
[2:36:59] hallelujah only only and that's the
[2:37:02] mountain you must climb in order to
[2:37:05] repent
[2:37:08] is that right
[2:37:09] because when those disciples saw
[2:37:12] elijah moses and jesus
[2:37:14] this is lord shall we make three
[2:37:16] denominations
[2:37:19] so we make three tabernacles
[2:37:21] and then all of a sudden
[2:37:23] a cloud
[2:37:26] a dimensional see what people don't
[2:37:28] understand people think that was those
[2:37:29] weren't water vapors you know
[2:37:34] incompetent about a greater cloud of
[2:37:36] witness those are not
[2:37:39] water vapors
[2:37:42] those are a host
[2:37:44] dressed in white
[2:37:47] hallelujah
[2:37:49] that's why he said as you saw me go up
[2:37:52] you should likewise see me come down
[2:37:55] it's a host
[2:37:57] y'all understand me
[2:37:59] and you and i must understand by the
[2:38:00] grace of god when god comes in and began
[2:38:04] to work with you and let him work
[2:38:07] suffer but thank him for it
[2:38:09] go through what you got to go through
[2:38:11] him but make him make
[2:38:13] let god bring you to a sweetness and a
[2:38:15] meekness
[2:38:17] in everything i'm closing i try i keep
[2:38:20] trying to close and somebody keep
[2:38:21] somebody keep pulling but um
[2:38:25] uh
[2:38:28] it's it's
[2:38:30] because i'm full
[2:38:32] i'm really full and i'm trying to get it
[2:38:35] because i want people to know things
[2:38:37] have changed
[2:38:40] things have changed and remember when
[2:38:42] you was a kid
[2:38:43] and you tried to
[2:38:45] you know you know put on your clothes
[2:38:47] and all that kind of stuff and
[2:38:48] and i don't know a child yet who didn't
[2:38:50] put his shoes on wrong
[2:38:53] you couldn't disturb it determine or
[2:38:55] distinguish between the right shoe and
[2:38:56] the left shoe
[2:38:58] and you walk out like that you know
[2:39:02] it took a while
[2:39:04] it took a while
[2:39:06] to learn that right
[2:39:08] and then you know you you and that's how
[2:39:09] it is with the word you learn
[2:39:12] you learn how it all fits
[2:39:14] but no matter how it fits it's going to
[2:39:16] spell out the lord jesus christ
[2:39:19] every time every time every time every
[2:39:22] time every time don't let no system make
[2:39:26] you believe anything other than that
[2:39:28] because even our prophet never came to
[2:39:30] exalt himself he kept pointing to jesus
[2:39:32] christ
[2:39:35] this is his hour now
[2:39:37] right and in closing i'm closing for
[2:39:39] real this time
[2:39:41] but in closing
[2:39:43] to show you
[2:39:45] where you stand in the scripture
[2:39:48] your esther
[2:39:50] and i can go through another scripture
[2:39:52] but i'm gonna tell you like this in that
[2:39:54] silence because a lot of times people
[2:39:56] think when silence what the word of god
[2:39:57] said the heavens hushed
[2:39:59] didn't say nothing about earth
[2:40:03] because because something say silent
[2:40:04] doesn't mean nothing's going on what
[2:40:07] nothing going on in heaven
[2:40:09] right
[2:40:10] but if you take this the scripture and
[2:40:12] you go into esther because esther's the
[2:40:14] queen she's the girl she's the one
[2:40:16] i didn't mean to say it like that
[2:40:18] [Music]
[2:40:19] but my point is
[2:40:21] you know think about it it was a time of
[2:40:24] desperation
[2:40:25] and haman was going to destroy
[2:40:28] all the jews
[2:40:33] and listen people let's put it this way
[2:40:37] they perhaps had their dna
[2:40:42] and so esther at some point was going to
[2:40:44] be discovered
[2:40:46] but something about esther she knew that
[2:40:48] the king loved her
[2:40:50] now you're going to fail god if you
[2:40:52] don't know he loves you
[2:40:54] if you have allowed the devil to tell
[2:40:55] you that jesus christ do not love you
[2:40:57] then you
[2:40:58] you need to be at the altar
[2:41:01] but esther knew that there was a garment
[2:41:03] that he liked
[2:41:05] and that's the garment of phrase
[2:41:08] you know what i'm saying it's nothing
[2:41:09] that makes a man feel good when he's
[2:41:11] bought his wife a nice outfit and she
[2:41:13] put that thing on
[2:41:16] come on brothers
[2:41:19] yes
[2:41:21] it makes me makes him happy because you
[2:41:23] know she appreciate what you
[2:41:25] right
[2:41:26] and when she put that on she's thinking
[2:41:28] about you
[2:41:32] and you bet not ignore
[2:41:38] but esther put on this thing
[2:41:41] and she knows
[2:41:43] she's haven't been summoned that's the
[2:41:45] key
[2:41:46] she hasn't been summoned
[2:41:48] everybody's waiting on the summons
[2:41:51] but esther did not
[2:41:53] because she saw that she needed
[2:41:57] to see the king
[2:41:59] you understand me
[2:42:01] and she knew
[2:42:02] because the law god had not ordered her
[2:42:05] to come in
[2:42:06] that it meant death
[2:42:08] if he didn't hand out the scepter
[2:42:10] [Music]
[2:42:11] right so you understand where we are in
[2:42:13] history i'm going to tell you something
[2:42:18] when the door swung open
[2:42:21] because remember when the king's chamber
[2:42:23] is business
[2:42:24] all business going on
[2:42:26] he's he's working things trying to get
[2:42:28] things straightened out and everything
[2:42:29] else and don't want to be disturbed
[2:42:32] and esther the door opens
[2:42:35] and esther is standing there
[2:42:38] and everything
[2:42:40] hushed
[2:42:43] i hope you get it
[2:42:46] quiet
[2:42:48] but it was at this time
[2:42:51] esther locked eyes
[2:42:54] with her king
[2:42:56] and let me tell you something
[2:42:58] a man and woman can lock eyes
[2:43:01] and won't have to say one word
[2:43:05] because the language is unspoken
[2:43:08] somebody know what i'm talking about
[2:43:15] i know we all but we remember don't you
[2:43:24] no words had to be spoken
[2:43:28] all business hushed
[2:43:30] don't get it
[2:43:31] like in heaven
[2:43:33] everything hushed
[2:43:35] esther walks in
[2:43:39] she comes up to the king
[2:43:43] and she can tell by his eyes
[2:43:45] it's going to be all right
[2:43:47] he takes the
[2:43:48] scepter you know what the scepter was
[2:43:52] his authority
[2:43:54] and he gives her the little book
[2:43:58] you hear what i'm saying he gives her
[2:44:00] the scepter
[2:44:02] and she takes it and everything's fine
[2:44:05] and he asked her what would you have
[2:44:08] she says i'm having a great church
[2:44:10] service over here
[2:44:13] i want you to come
[2:44:14] she called it a banquet
[2:44:16] she said but i'm going to y'all know a
[2:44:18] banquet is real good
[2:44:21] you know you've never seen a sad person
[2:44:22] at a banquet
[2:44:25] coming over here to a banquet
[2:44:28] and bring the devil
[2:44:34] right
[2:44:35] bring the devil i want the devil to know
[2:44:38] he's already lost
[2:44:41] come on somebody
[2:44:43] y'all know it's the truth
[2:44:45] come on brothers those of you who who
[2:44:47] had a best friend you had a best friend
[2:44:50] as soon as you met your wife you forgot
[2:44:52] him
[2:44:56] it's the truth
[2:44:58] your best friend you ran together you
[2:45:00] played ball together you were together
[2:45:01] all the time and all of a sudden you met
[2:45:03] your wife
[2:45:04] and your best friend went out the window
[2:45:10] it worked that way
[2:45:16] you don't even know you you neglecting
[2:45:18] your birth best friend you're not even
[2:45:19] thinking i'm neglected my best friend
[2:45:21] never crossed your mind
[2:45:23] right so what happens is she said come
[2:45:26] on and i'm i'm closing now for real
[2:45:28] come on
[2:45:30] and she says oh come on now we're going
[2:45:31] to have a banquet and you know she's
[2:45:33] just letting
[2:45:35] this man don't even know
[2:45:38] she going to judge you
[2:45:40] you already judged
[2:45:44] but she's getting ready to tell him
[2:45:46] [Music]
[2:45:48] and the king is the one who's gonna
[2:45:50] put it on you
[2:45:53] and she said he said well esther
[2:45:56] you you had such a wonderful church
[2:45:58] service you praised me so well and every
[2:46:00] time i wanted some grapes you dropped
[2:46:02] them in my mouth
[2:46:03] y'all
[2:46:05] that's not i'm just
[2:46:07] i'm not trying to add but i'm trying to
[2:46:09] give you a picture
[2:46:11] and so what happens is amen
[2:46:13] he says tell you what else to
[2:46:16] here's the book
[2:46:17] here's the scepter
[2:46:19] i'm going to give you half the kingdom
[2:46:23] in other words join us with christ
[2:46:25] i've made you join heirs with the king
[2:46:27] whatever is mine is yours esther you
[2:46:30] understand oh god
[2:46:32] that's what this message has given unto
[2:46:34] you
[2:46:35] it's everything that is of jesus it is
[2:46:38] of yours
[2:46:42] hallelujah
[2:46:46] king said tell me esther says no no no
[2:46:48] no come on you know it's good to have it
[2:46:50] done you know have a witness you know
[2:46:52] let's do it again
[2:46:55] let's do it again
[2:46:57] you understand me
[2:46:58] and so what god does and what she did
[2:47:01] that's you don't you see what i'm saying
[2:47:03] put yourself in esther's shoes
[2:47:05] this is where you become the character
[2:47:08] because when esther when esther came
[2:47:10] before the king you were there
[2:47:16] you put yourself in esther
[2:47:18] and then you see your role to play
[2:47:21] and then you see what's given to you
[2:47:23] and then you see that esther becomes
[2:47:27] if can i say it like this somewhat a
[2:47:29] mediator whatever you want to say it but
[2:47:31] she stood in between the king the
[2:47:33] judgment and her people
[2:47:36] you see what i'm saying
[2:47:38] amen and and you know she was willing to
[2:47:41] die and she did in some blizzard in
[2:47:44] symbolism when she fasted three days and
[2:47:47] three nights that was a death bury and
[2:47:49] resurrection and she went to see the
[2:47:51] king and now the king is giving her all
[2:47:53] she need and now she's telling the king
[2:47:57] that old devil's trying to kill me lord
[2:48:03] she said who who he said who that haman
[2:48:08] right and then haman is what he's trying
[2:48:11] to butter up
[2:48:13] you don't think the devil at that day
[2:48:16] gonna try to butter you up
[2:48:19] all that stuff he doesn't did to you
[2:48:21] and knowing he's gonna be cast into the
[2:48:23] lake of fire
[2:48:25] hello
[2:48:26] all because of you
[2:48:29] what did he do he flirted with you
[2:48:32] that was what god that's the way the
[2:48:34] king interpreted ain't no way you gonna
[2:48:36] come into my king
[2:48:38] into my house in my bedroom or wherever
[2:48:41] they was and then you're gonna try to
[2:48:43] attack my queen
[2:48:47] what a setup
[2:48:48] [Music]
[2:48:48] [Laughter]
[2:48:50] y'all hear what i'm saying
[2:48:53] oh my and now
[2:48:55] now she's got speech she can speak and
[2:48:58] now she's speaking the spoken word he
[2:49:01] needs to die his sons need to die
[2:49:05] and the very hell he could created for
[2:49:08] me he need to hang on that
[2:49:11] [Applause]
[2:49:12] hallelujah
[2:49:14] she is the one that causes his judgment
[2:49:19] don't be afraid of the devil it's
[2:49:22] written
[2:49:23] you're the one that causes the judgment
[2:49:26] of his him being thrown into the lake of
[2:49:28] fire
[2:49:29] [Applause]
[2:49:31] oh my god
[2:49:33] hallelujah
[2:49:35] if you don't shout then you won't have
[2:49:37] no shout
[2:49:38] out huh
[2:49:40] to know where you are and that's why the
[2:49:42] devil hates you so much
[2:49:44] because he know you are his end
[2:49:47] you are his end
[2:49:50] you are his end
[2:49:52] he can never stop you but we are here to
[2:49:55] stop him
[2:49:57] hallelujah let's stand
[2:50:01] hallelujah
[2:50:03] glory to god
[2:50:06] mercy jesus
[2:50:14] can't stop us
[2:50:21] oh lord
[2:50:26] in the presence
[2:50:30] of
[2:50:31] jehovah
[2:50:36] god
[2:50:39] [Music]
[2:50:53] [Laughter]
[2:50:54] [Music]
[2:50:58] hearts are manned
[2:51:02] [Music]
[2:51:14] of the kings
[2:51:18] can we sing that once again in the
[2:51:20] present in the
[2:51:23] praise
[2:51:25] [Music]
[2:51:37] god
[2:51:38] almighty
[2:51:41] let's raise our hands and worship him
[2:51:43] tonight
[2:51:50] [Music]
[2:51:58] hey
[2:52:00] [Music]
[2:52:09] the bread
[2:52:13] [Music]
[2:52:20] you see god is so perfect
[2:52:23] even when you do wrong
[2:52:25] he works it together
[2:52:27] he'll he'll manipulate your will
[2:52:31] to match his will
[2:52:34] you say well what how can you say that
[2:52:37] jonah
[2:52:39] ran
[2:52:42] and he didn't even know
[2:52:44] he was running in the right direction
[2:52:47] [Music]
[2:52:49] he thought he was running from god but
[2:52:51] he was literally running into the will
[2:52:52] of god
[2:52:54] remember jesus told us that
[2:52:58] that god prepared a fish
[2:53:02] for jonah
[2:53:04] so before jonah got there
[2:53:06] the fish was there waiting
[2:53:10] you understand me
[2:53:11] and jonah didn't understand that god
[2:53:15] anointed the fish
[2:53:17] and put him into the ministry
[2:53:18] [Music]
[2:53:20] yes he did
[2:53:22] jonah somehow
[2:53:25] understood
[2:53:26] and when the waves began to dash and
[2:53:29] everything else he said throw me
[2:53:31] overboard
[2:53:33] he was a prophet
[2:53:35] must god must have showed him something
[2:53:37] but then when he got there the fish
[2:53:40] swallowed him
[2:53:41] and what happened
[2:53:43] took him to nineveh
[2:53:46] then i don't know
[2:53:48] how jonah knew
[2:53:50] which direction he was going in
[2:53:53] but he knew how to turn
[2:53:55] and the bible said he turned toward the
[2:53:58] temple
[2:53:59] because remember solomon and david all
[2:54:01] they prayed
[2:54:03] that if any man would turn towards the
[2:54:05] temple god would hear him
[2:54:07] hallelujah
[2:54:08] he prayed and god heard him and the next
[2:54:11] thing you know amen he's in nineveh and
[2:54:13] here's the here's the the whale amen
[2:54:16] throwing him up
[2:54:18] oh my god why because god knew that over
[2:54:22] there in nineveh they were fish they
[2:54:23] worshipped the fish god
[2:54:26] you understand me oh god works on our
[2:54:28] behalf
[2:54:30] yes he does even when we don't think
[2:54:32] he's working for us he's working for us
[2:54:35] and then what happens jonah gets out
[2:54:37] there i don't understand the mind of
[2:54:39] prophets but he began to preach and
[2:54:41] everything else and god did what he did
[2:54:43] and he jonah gets mad
[2:54:49] [Music]
[2:54:53] you know
[2:54:55] and god understand even when you get
[2:54:56] angry
[2:55:00] he's amazing
[2:55:03] i'll tell you what experience
[2:55:05] if there's anybody that needs prayer we
[2:55:07] pray for you
[2:55:08] but just the other week i was preaching
[2:55:11] and i don't know whether god will allow
[2:55:12] me to preach that here
[2:55:14] but i was preaching uh
[2:55:17] uh let thy will be done in earth
[2:55:20] as it is in heaven
[2:55:23] and while i was preaching
[2:55:25] something happened
[2:55:28] it was so fast and so quick
[2:55:31] i actually thought it was i thought it
[2:55:32] was a rapture i really something
[2:55:35] an energy
[2:55:36] a power a light
[2:55:39] a holiness that i can't even comprehend
[2:55:42] engulfed me in just a moment's time
[2:55:45] i understood something i did i can't
[2:55:47] even explain it but i underst i
[2:55:49] understand his holiness is beyond
[2:55:51] anything we can imagine
[2:55:53] and god is the only one that can do that
[2:55:56] you see you can't do it but because you
[2:55:58] are chosen and he's elected
[2:56:01] you
[2:56:02] he
[2:56:03] that begun the good work in you is
[2:56:06] faithful to complete it he will complete
[2:56:09] i wasn't looking for that but i
[2:56:12] understood
[2:56:14] what his will i understand basically
[2:56:16] what his will is for me
[2:56:19] and how it is in heaven
[2:56:21] there's no sickness
[2:56:23] no death
[2:56:25] no miracles
[2:56:27] because you are the miracle
[2:56:29] everything that our being is everything
[2:56:32] we are we're lined up in just a moment's
[2:56:35] time
[2:56:36] we're lined up but right now he's
[2:56:38] building that character because that
[2:56:40] house and the character must fit
[2:56:43] don't worry about nothing trust god
[2:56:46] trust him
[2:56:47] and believe that he's going to do what
[2:56:49] he says stop looking in the mirror and
[2:56:51] seeing your faults and your failures
[2:56:53] because the blood covers all of that
[2:56:57] just press on says lord you see the need
[2:57:00] that's in me that character that i i
[2:57:02] want to have patience i want to be long

[2:57:06] love i want to have this charity i can't

[2:57:14] five minutes anybody in here can do it
[2:57:17] you can't do it you might have a desire
[2:57:20] to do it but you can't do it it's one of
[2:57:23] those things you cannot do and that's
[2:57:25] how it is with god you can't change
[2:57:27] yourself
