[0:00] but i'm telling you there's liberty for
[0:02] you
[0:03] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[0:06] through repentance
[0:08] by accepting what the lord has done for
[0:11] you
[0:11] how he has qualified you how he has made
[0:15] you worthy
[0:16] with his own blood start fellowshipping
[0:20] the truth
[0:21] start choosing to move past your past
[0:25] and into your present somebody said
[0:29] didn't you mean to say
[0:30] into your future you can't move into the
[0:33] future
[0:34] until you are willing to embrace the
[0:37] present
[0:38] you've got to begin to recognize that
[0:41] god is moving today
[0:42] he is an on-time god
[0:46] yes he is he never misses an appointment
[0:50] he never shows up 10 minutes too late
[0:53] he's an on-time god he is a now
[0:57] god and he has a now word
[1:00] for you in your life he is not just a
[1:04] god of history
[1:05] but the scripture says that he is a
[1:08] present
[1:09] help in the time of need do you
[1:12] presently need the lord's help then step
[1:16] past your past make up your mind i'm
[1:19] going to meet jesus christ
[1:22] who is the same yesterday and
[1:25] today and forever i'm going to believe
[1:29] that he
[1:30] has come to deliver me from my past
[1:33] failure
[1:34] from my past hurts and wounds you know
[1:37] folks i know there are some of you
[1:38] watching this program
[1:40] today you've been so wounded so
[1:43] hurt so disappointed so let down
[1:46] so betrayed your life
[1:49] you have known great pain and great
[1:52] sorrow and i
[1:54] i'd like to say how sorry i am
[1:57] i mean that from the bottom of my heart
[1:59] i'm sorry
[2:01] for your pain i i really
[2:04] feel compassion toward you
[2:09] in your pain and in your wounds and the
[2:12] hurts of your past
[2:14] i know there have been people who have
[2:16] let you down
[2:17] i myself have let people down
[2:20] not always being able to be what they
[2:23] needed me to be
[2:24] at that moment i know what it feels like
[2:27] also
[2:28] to be let down and i am i'm so sorry
[2:31] that you
[2:32] had to feel that and walk through that
[2:34] and experience that
[2:36] but i'm even more sorry that it has
[2:39] paralyzed you
[2:41] i'm even more sorry that the enemy has
[2:43] used all of that
[2:45] stuff to keep you locked in a death
[2:48] structure
[2:50] and i've come today to tell you you
[2:52] don't have to live under a structure of
[2:55] death
[2:56] you don't have to be locked in a prison
[2:59] in a stronghold of satan jesus
[3:02] christ has come that you might have life
[3:06] let's quote the whole thing the thief
[3:08] that's who we're talking about
[3:10] he cometh not but for to steal to kill
[3:13] and to destroy
[3:14] but jesus said i am come
[3:18] that you might have life say that with
[3:21] me
[3:22] life life it's no life
[3:25] when you're locked in your past
[3:28] it's no real life when you're when
[3:31] you're living as
[3:32] a prisoner to a structure of death all
[3:34] around you you can't break free
[3:36] jesus said i am come that you might have
[3:39] life
[3:40] and that you might have it more
[3:42] abundantly
[3:44] i want to declare to you today in the
[3:47] most
[3:48] holy name of our lord and savior jesus
[3:51] christ
[3:52] that he has made a way for you and i
[3:55] to have not only life but abundant life
[3:59] more abundance in our life
[4:03] god has made that available if you can
[4:06] recognize how the enemy has built this
[4:09] structure
[4:10] scaffolding around your life that only
[4:13] leads to
[4:14] death and that he has built that
[4:16] scaffolding that structure
[4:18] on the foundation of the past
[4:21] what a scam what a scam artist the devil
[4:25] is
[4:26] to build this structure of death or
[4:29] smack
[4:29] dab in the middle of your past
[4:33] knowing that you have not been able to
[4:35] get through your past
[4:37] to live in the present and to reach for
[4:39] the future
[4:40] he then attempts to take that and
[4:42] establish a strategy
[4:45] that becomes a structure resulting in
[4:48] abandonment or death of vision
[4:51] and abortion of destiny hope deferred
[4:54] let me read it again he then attempts to
[4:57] establish a strategy that becomes a
[4:59] structure
[5:01] resulting in abandonment or death of
[5:04] vision
[5:06] you know some of you god has given you
[5:08] hope for your future
[5:09] god's given you vision for ministry how
[5:12] you might
[5:13] help others how you might serve others
[5:16] well the devil doesn't want you moving
[5:18] ahead to obey god
[5:20] because he knows that if you begin to
[5:21] move in obedience to the call
[5:24] and the plan of god in your life it's
[5:26] going to release the abundance
[5:29] it's going to release the blessing and
[5:32] the devil doesn't want you to be blessed
[5:33] of god he doesn't want you
[5:35] operating in the abundant life he wants
[5:38] to shrink you
[5:39] he wants to pull you back and pull you
[5:42] down
[5:43] but jesus wants to increase you
[5:46] he wants to expand you into
[5:50] his vision for your life you know it's
[5:53] true sometimes we get the wrong vision
[5:55] for our future
[5:56] sometimes in our human effort we come up
[5:59] with the wrong plan
[6:01] but i'm willing i pray you'll be also
[6:03] willing
[6:04] to trade in my vision for my life for
[6:07] his vision for my life
