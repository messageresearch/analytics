[0:00] you know what the mind of Christ looks
[0:01] like it looks like the word it is a
[0:12] beautiful victory to know that we can
[0:17] take in any situation that we choose to
[0:20] the mind of Christ we can in fact it's
[0:25] ours and we can process life through the
[0:29] mind of Christ if we keep making the
[0:31] right choices but it is a choice it's
[0:34] not a daily choice it's actually a
[0:37] minute-by-minute choice to process life
[0:41] through the mind of Christ which is the
[0:44] word you don't know what the mind of
[0:46] Christ looks like it looks like the word
[0:49] come on now and when we say Word
[0:53] we don't just mean Genesis to Revelation
[0:55] either but if the bride could understand
[0:58] that she has received a portion of that
[1:00] word she has received a portion of that
[1:03] logos because that's who she is
[1:06] you were once in him he didn't just
[1:09] think about you he thought you you are a
[1:12] font of God you are now a word of God
[1:16] because you've been expressed into the
[1:17] earth that is who you are not a loser a
[1:23] word sent from God not a defeated whip
[1:30] a word citric god not a nervous wreck a
[1:37] word sent from God come on
[1:41] not a not a jealous Mouse no a word
[1:46] citric god I find out that in the church
[1:50] people are living perpetually in the
[1:54] need for deliverance because they don't
[1:58] understand what deliverance really is
[2:01] deliverance is not the absence of
[2:04] opposition it's not the absence of
[2:07] warfare that's not what deliverance is
[2:10] deliverance is the ability to know that
[2:14] everything you need to win the victory
[2:18] over whatever it is that you're walking
[2:21] through is in you
