[0:00] Because man looks on the outward shell.
[0:04] Man looks at the tinted glass. Man looks
[0:07] on the layer, the surface of what can be
[0:10] seen or perceived. But God sees beyond
[0:13] the badger skin, brother. God sees
[0:16] what's on the inside. And it is by that
[0:19] that he chooses us. It's by that that he
[0:22] anoints us. It's what he knows about our
[0:25] heart.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may seem to be the most
[0:29] religious of them all and the most
[0:31] spiritual of them all on the surface,
[0:34] but God's not looking at your
[0:36] performance only. He's looking at your
[0:39] heart. He alone has the right to judge
[0:43] our motives.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; One of the things the Lord dealt with me
[0:47] about a couple of weeks ago in prayer,
[0:49] he said, "I'm going to deal with
[0:51] hypocrisy in my church first.
[0:55] I'm going to deal with that first and
[0:57] foremost.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to seek out those who pretend
[1:02] to be one thing and live an entirely
[1:05] different thing. That's what I'm going
[1:07] to deal with first.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm depending on him.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; If there's any hypocrisy in my life, I
[1:15] want it dug out with a grubbing hole. I
[1:18] want it revealed to me so that I can do
[1:21] something about it
[1:23] &gt;&gt; because I'm the only one who can take it
[1:26] up with the creator.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; I'm the only one that can make up my
[1:30] mind. I cannot stress to you today the
[1:33] importance enough of having a determined
[1:36] mind, having a madeup mind to hold out,
[1:41] to hold on, to go all the way
[1:44] &gt;&gt; and to be what you say you are.
[1:48] Amen. It's the life of Jesus Christ that
[1:52] we claim.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; We claim to be the very reflection of
[1:57] his light in the earth. May our lives
[2:00] begin to line up.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's going on in our
[2:05] lives. And he's calling us to a place of
[2:09] integrity.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Integrity is everything.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; It's everything. It's so much a part of
[2:17] our character in Jesus Christ.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; This is not a time for drawing other
[2:24] people in
[2:25] &gt;&gt; to our our beef, to our disagreement
[2:28] with someone,
[2:29] &gt;&gt; to our opinion with someone. This is the
[2:32] hour that we should as brothers and
[2:35] sisters desire to somehow cover. I don't
[2:40] mean cover sin, but I mean to to sort of
[2:43] act as a protection
[2:46] &gt;&gt; so that everybody doesn't have to know.
[2:49] What if a hand would appear uh this
[2:52] morning and write on the wall over there
[2:54] between those windows? What if the hand
[2:57] of God were to write there today? Your
[2:59] soul is being weighed in the balance
[3:04] &gt;&gt; and found wanting.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; It's not enough. It's not measuring up.
[3:11] Would you want God then to continue to
[3:13] write your sin on the wall there for
[3:15] everyone to read? Or would you rather
[3:18] take that as a warning from the Lord and
[3:20] go clean up your life?
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, purify us and then refine us
[3:27] &gt;&gt; and then refine us again.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Aba also uses this season of
[3:33] misunderstanding
[3:35] to anchor you in God's approval.
[3:39] rather than in the approval
[3:42] of men.
