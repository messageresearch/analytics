[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope a lord
[1:00] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of
[1:03] New Hope revival ministries and I'm
[1:06] coming to you today on behalf of the
[1:09] gospel channel our wonderful partners in
[1:12] getting the good news of the gospel of
[1:15] the Lord Jesus Christ around the world I
[1:18] want to thank you again for tuning into
[1:21] the broadcasts today I believe the Lord
[1:24] is going to speak to us from his word
[1:26] he's been so faithful to do that as we
[1:30] have been meeting together in this way
[1:32] today we're going to begin another
[1:36] installment of a series that we have
[1:39] been working on this would be number 7
[1:41] in the series schemes and devices and
[1:45] before we get into the study today I
[1:48] want to show you something I brought
[1:50] this out here just to show you our
[1:54] concern for your prayer requests for
[1:57] your needs this is a folder and these
[2:00] are the prayer requests that have come
[2:03] in I want you to see this stack these
[2:05] are the prayer requests that have come
[2:07] in from you our viewers
[2:09] in the last three weeks and I'm I'm you
[2:14] know I to say I'm excited sounds a
[2:17] little strange because there are so many
[2:19] desperate needs in in these notes in
[2:22] these emails in these phone calls but
[2:26] what I'm excited about is the
[2:27] opportunity that God is giving us to
[2:30] stand with you in prayer and in
[2:33] agreement and I want to say that
[2:36] testimonies have started coming in and
[2:38] that's what we're looking for that's
[2:40] what we're believing for that as we
[2:43] agree with you concerning your needs
[2:46] that God begins to move in such a way
[2:50] that it cannot be denied and you receive
[2:53] a testimony and my prayer in my desire
[2:57] is that you would then take the time to
[2:59] share that testimony with us even if
[3:02] it's just a slight move in the right
[3:06] direction even if you can see
[3:08] improvement I would be
[3:10] so delighted to hear what God is doing
[3:13] for you and I keep this folder with me
[3:17] just recently I went to a missionary
[3:19] camp in North Carolina and I took this
[3:22] folder with me so that when my prayer
[3:25] time would come I would be able to hold
[3:27] it put my hands on it
[3:29] skim through some of the pages and read
[3:32] the needs again and ask the Lord
[3:36] specifically to move on your behalf and
[3:39] so I want to invite you to keep sending
[3:42] in your prayer requests and your
[3:44] testimonies either by email or by phone
[3:47] call just remember that there is a great
[3:51] time difference between where we live in
[3:53] Alabama and where most of you would be
[3:55] viewing this program and so it is
[3:58] possible that you would get a recording
[4:00] but that is a prayer line for you to
[4:03] leave your prayer requests and then we
[4:06] have a sister who will come and and
[4:08] transcribe your call and put it in our
[4:12] caller tracking and then I've been
[4:15] printing them out so that I can have
[4:17] them with me as I said just a moment ago
[4:19] and so let us hear from you maybe it's
[4:23] easier for some of you just to send an
[4:25] email and all of that contact
[4:28] information is given to you on the
[4:30] program but anyway I want to thank the
[4:32] Lord today for answered prayer and I
[4:35] want to thank him for this opportunity
[4:37] that brother Eric Erickson has given us
[4:40] that we could partner with the gospel
[4:43] channel and continue to get the truth of
[4:47] God's precious word into your home we've
[4:50] been on this study schemes and devices
[4:53] and the theme scripture for our studies
[4:57] together has been second Corinthians
[5:00] chapter 2 verse 11 and it reads lest
[5:04] Satan should get an advantage of us for
[5:08] we are not ignorant of his devices and I
[5:14] want to just say that I believe
[5:15] ignorance is leaving our lives when it
[5:18] comes to the schemes and devices of the
[5:22] enemy I believe
[5:24] that many so many of you have reached
[5:27] out to us because you are able to
[5:30] recognize that what you're going through
[5:32] is a scheme it is a device of the enemy
[5:36] it is an attack against your life
[5:39] against your family against your church
[5:43] your ministry against your physical body
[5:45] and when we recognize that this is not
[5:49] just perhaps a getting older thing or
[5:54] this is the way it has to be in life
[5:57] thing but when we recognize that what
[6:00] we're going through is indeed an assault
[6:03] of the enemy against us then we we
[6:06] approach that in a completely different
[6:09] way and it is the will of God according
[6:13] to the Apostle Paul that we should learn
[6:16] his devices nobody wants to talk about
[6:18] the devil but we must learn some of the
[6:22] ways or as many of the ways as we
[6:25] possibly can that he unleashes his fury
[6:29] his anger against the children of God
[6:32] because I truly believe that God is
[6:36] raising up an overcoming company of
[6:39] believers the bride of Jesus Christ the
[6:43] fully adopted sons of God in these last
[6:47] days who will move in a new level of
[6:52] intercession a new level of authority
[6:54] against the works of the enemy I truly
[6:58] believe that where we have struggled and
[7:02] where we have battled and where we have
[7:04] seemingly wrestled with the enemy I
[7:07] believe that God desires to move his
[7:10] people into a new level
[7:13] so that we struggle less and we speak
[7:16] with greater authority and remember that
[7:20] when God releases greater authority to
[7:23] the Bride of Christ it's because he has
[7:26] seen in us he has recognized in us a new
[7:31] of surrender a new level of dedication
[7:35] and consecration newer realms of
[7:39] authority they don't fall upon us
[7:44] automatically but it is a response it is
[7:48] a blessing from the Lord when he sees us
[7:51] digging into the Word of God drawing
[7:54] near to him and focusing on the truth of
[8:00] God's Word instead of the lies of our
[8:04] circumstances when God sees us moving in
[8:07] that direction it is his good pleasure
[8:10] it is his joy to release to us the
[8:15] authority that he has purchased for us
[8:18] with his own blood and I am just
[8:22] thankful for what I see God doing so
[8:25] with this new level of authority that
[8:27] that the bride is beginning to walk in
[8:30] we must understand a lot of things you
[8:34] know God wants to open the eyes of our
[8:38] understanding to a lot of deeper truths
[8:41] from his word and remember that this is
[8:45] the season this is the hour we are
[8:47] living in the end times in fact I always
[8:51] say we're living in the last of the last
[8:54] days and so there is a company of people
[8:57] that have been prophesied that have been
[9:00] promised the overcomers and what does it
[9:03] mean to be an overcomer it means to come
[9:06] over and the first thing that we're
[9:09] overcoming is unbelief we're overcoming
[9:12] sin which has its root in unbelief and
[9:16] we're beginning to use the weapons that
[9:20] we've had all along in our disposal the
[9:23] Word of God and I'm going to talk to you
[9:27] today about another application of how
[9:30] we can use the word of God to defeat the
[9:34] enemy in our lives and the name of the
[9:38] Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah his
[9:41] precious blood that He shed for
[9:44] at Calvary all of these things become
[9:49] great weapons and great instruments to
[9:52] use in prayer in prophetic declaration
[9:55] and decree when we speak the truth of
[10:00] God's Word from our heart of course
[10:03] through our mouth it originates in our
[10:07] heart the seed of all human emotion and
[10:10] it projects with our voice it comes out
[10:15] of our mouth and we decree it and we
[10:17] declare it did you know that there are
[10:20] angels of God that are assigned to
[10:24] protect to guard the Word of God did you
[10:29] know that's how precious God's Word is
[10:31] to him that he has assigned a company of
[10:35] angels to guard as guardians of the word
[10:39] and did you know that when you surrender
[10:43] your life to Him and you follow him
[10:46] beyond the born-again experience and
[10:49] into the overcoming lifestyle and you
[10:53] speak that word did you know that those
[10:55] angels I believe are dispatched to guard
[10:59] that word of God that comes out of your
[11:02] mouth
[11:03] I believe they not only guard that word
[11:06] and watch over that word and protect
[11:09] that word but I believe they minister in
[11:12] in many ways to accelerate the
[11:17] fulfillment of that word to help bring
[11:20] that word to pass I was actually in the
[11:25] United Kingdom where many of you are
[11:27] watching today and I was in the
[11:31] beautiful city town of Torquay I hope
[11:36] I'm saying that right down in the
[11:39] southern part I believe of of the United
[11:43] Kingdom just a few years back and I was
[11:47] staying in a beautiful hotel I was
[11:48] speaking in a conference in the hotel
[11:51] and I had an experience with some angels
[11:56] I I don't know how deep I'll go into the
[11:58] today but I you know we don't always see
[12:01] angels some people have never seen an
[12:04] angel and that's not something to be
[12:08] discouraged or defeated about but please
[12:10] just because you've never had the
[12:13] opportunity to see them don't for one
[12:16] minute begin to think that they're not
[12:18] real and try not to doubt if someone
[12:23] that you have confidence II and then you
[12:26] know their life if they tell you that
[12:28] their eyes have been open to see try to
[12:31] be a believer you know sometimes it's
[12:33] harder to believe than it is to doubt
[12:35] it's easy to doubt but I'd like to live
[12:38] a life that it's it's harder for me to
[12:40] doubt the supernatural you know it's
[12:42] easier to believe it than to doubt it
[12:44] that's the life I want to live but
[12:46] anyway I saw these angels and I saw
[12:49] recognize the number how many there were
[12:51] and I wondered about their assignment
[12:55] and they and they communicated to me
[12:58] that they were guardians of the Word of
[13:02] God they were stewards of the Word of
[13:06] God specifically the words that had been
[13:11] spoken over that area of torquey am I
[13:17] saying that right
[13:18] Torquay across the bay and I believe if
[13:23] I remember correctly beyond was the
[13:25] English Channel they were guarding
[13:30] protecting the Word of God now that
[13:33] encourages me that encourages me for
[13:36] Smith Station Alabama because there have
[13:39] been wonderful promises made over this
[13:41] community over this area not just our
[13:45] ministry base here on what we call the
[13:49] Eagles refuge campground but the
[13:52] community at large and there was a word
[13:55] one time that spoke about God extending
[13:58] the the area of our spiritual
[14:01] jurisdiction and and and how many miles
[14:04] it would go out in a circular pattern
[14:07] and I claim that and I believe that no
[14:11] matter where you're watching me there
[14:13] have been promises made over that area
[14:15] maybe over the ministry that you're
[14:17] connected with maybe over your family
[14:19] your own life and you've not yet seen
[14:23] the entire fulfillment or fruition of
[14:26] those promises and of course I know the
[14:28] devil I know how he works trying to do
[14:32] everything he can to discourage us from
[14:34] holding on to the promise of God but
[14:37] somehow you've been holding on I just
[14:40] want you to be aware that you are not in
[14:42] this holding on battle alone I want you
[14:45] to know that there are heavenly hosts
[14:47] that are assigned by God to watch over
[14:51] his word concerning your life your
[14:55] family your home and your ministry and I
[14:58] just believe that knowing that I know it
[15:02] gives me a great sense of encouragement
[15:04] and new courage and I pray that it would
[15:07] I had no intention of sharing that with
[15:09] you today but I feel like the Lord knew
[15:12] all along that that was going to be
[15:14] something that would speak to somebody
[15:15] so you just take that right now if you
[15:18] never see them if you're never
[15:21] physically aware that those angels are
[15:23] laboring around you guarding guarding
[15:27] and stewarding the precious words of
[15:29] truth if you never see them if you never
[15:32] feel them if you never even sense their
[15:34] presence just know that the Bible tells
[15:37] us that he assigns angels he gives them
[15:40] charge authority over our lives to
[15:45] protect us and to keep us and if God is
[15:48] concerned about me stubbing my toe lest
[15:51] I would - my foot against a stone if God
[15:55] is concerned about me stubbing my toe so
[15:59] much so that he gives angels to help
[16:01] protect me and keep me then surely he's
[16:04] jealous over his word and so just be
[16:07] aware of that as we move forward in our
[16:10] study today that you're not in this
[16:12] battle alone
[16:14] praise God but you have the help and
[16:17] strength and courage and boldness of the
[16:19] Lord
[16:21] you and you have the cooperation of the
[16:24] heavenly hosts the angelic beings
[16:27] created as worshippers of the Living God
[16:31] and as stewards of the promises of God I
[16:35] want to share with you a very familiar
[16:38] portion of Scripture from Paul's
[16:40] writings to the church at Ephesus the
[16:43] book of Ephesians we learned it in
[16:46] Sunday school we've sung about it we've
[16:50] heard sermons about it but I want to
[16:53] share it with you today Ephesians
[16:54] chapter 6 verses 10 through 18 and I'm
[16:58] going to read it first in the King James
[17:01] very quickly because I know that a lot
[17:05] of us are very familiar with the way
[17:07] it's presented in the King James and
[17:09] then I want to share it with you in the
[17:12] amplified version of the Bible because
[17:15] it greatly amplifies this portion of
[17:19] Scripture finally my brethren verse 10
[17:22] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[17:27] of his might hallelujah put on the whole
[17:33] armor of God that ye may be able to
[17:38] stand against the wiles of the devil the
[17:44] schemes and devices of the devil for we
[17:49] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[17:54] against principalities now listen
[17:57] because we're getting a little insight
[18:01] into the order of that realm of darkness
[18:07] I believe that there is great order
[18:11] among the heavenly hosts I don't
[18:15] understand at all I couldn't give it to
[18:18] you line by line ABC because I don't
[18:22] fully understand it either but I know
[18:24] there are Archangels and I know there
[18:27] are other kinds of angels who have other
[18:32] functions in the kingdom of
[18:35] and also as we read here in in Ephesians
[18:40] 6:12 there is some sort of order rank
[18:44] hierarchy in the kingdom of darkness and
[18:48] so this makes me want to pay close
[18:50] attention because the enemy wants you to
[18:53] think you're fighting with flesh and
[18:55] blood he did she did he said she said
[19:00] preacher you don't know what they did to
[19:03] me well all of that may be true but our
[19:07] battle as Holy Ghost Ville believers in
[19:11] the Lord Jesus Christ it's not with one
[19:13] another our battle is not with people
[19:17] it's not with personalities it's with
[19:20] principalities we have to understand
[19:23] that behind the human conflict there is
[19:27] another force at work we're not
[19:31] wrestling against flesh and blood but
[19:35] against principalities against powers
[19:40] against the rulers of the darkness of
[19:43] this world against spiritual wickedness
[19:46] in high places but here is the precious
[19:53] remedy here is the solution to all of
[19:57] these dark entities principalities
[20:00] rulers of the darkness of this world
[20:03] spiritual wickedness in high places
[20:06] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[20:08] of God that you may be able to withstand
[20:10] in the evil day that's where we are in
[20:14] the evil day and having done all give up
[20:18] quit go home and take your toys is that
[20:22] what it said no that's not what it said
[20:25] at all there's no giving up in the army
[20:28] of God there's no retirement in the
[20:31] kingdom of God it's not time to retire
[20:34] it's time to refire we can't get upset
[20:38] and go home take our little marbles with
[20:40] us in our pocket and say I I give up oh
[20:43] no sir because you may
[20:46] but I can guarantee you the devil is not
[20:49] going to give up he's going to continue
[20:52] his onslaught and if you're not there to
[20:55] resist him and oppose him he's going to
[20:58] gain the victory over your life no sir
[21:01] we can't allow that to happen we've got
[21:04] to stand having done all not quit having
[21:07] done all stand and then verse 14 stand
[21:12] there for how you're gonna stand he's
[21:15] telling us having your loins Girt about
[21:19] with truth you've got on a girdle of
[21:23] truth a belt of truth and having on the
[21:26] breastplate of righteousness and your
[21:29] feet shod with the preparation of the
[21:32] gospel of peace verse 16 and above all
[21:37] that's that's interesting it gives us
[21:41] some some insight into importance we've
[21:46] had several pieces of armor revealed to
[21:49] us but listen and how this verse opens
[21:54] above all taking the shield of faith so
[22:00] above the belt of truth above the
[22:04] breastplate of righteousness above
[22:06] having your feet shod with the
[22:09] preparation of peace take the shield of
[22:12] faith how important is the shield of
[22:16] faith evidently very important because
[22:19] it's above all wherewith you shall be
[22:23] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[22:27] the wicked now I tell you that's
[22:31] powerful to take the sting out of them
[22:34] to take the fire out of them they may
[22:37] come but without fire without sting if
[22:41] you meet them with the shield of faith
[22:45] and take verse 17 the helmet of
[22:50] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[22:55] which is the word
[22:58] of God now I know that the Word of God
[23:01] is the most important thing in all of
[23:04] this
[23:04] but remember that the writer says above
[23:08] all the shield of faith why because your
[23:12] faith in the Word of God as we taught
[23:16] you right here
[23:17] your faith in the Word of God helps to
[23:22] activate that word in your life you've
[23:27] got to attach your faith to the word or
[23:29] it might be effective in everyone else's
[23:32] life around you and not in your life
[23:35] well that's not the fault of the Word of
[23:38] God that's because as the book of
[23:42] Hebrews tells us that's because it the
[23:45] word didn't profit them because it was
[23:47] not mixed with faith so you've got to
[23:50] get that shield of faith out there
[23:52] you've got to hold it up high that
[23:54] that's the purpose of a shield you've
[23:56] got to hold it up to protect your head
[23:59] you've got to protect your eyes your
[24:01] face your brain you've got to you know
[24:04] you raise it up and you don't just hold
[24:07] it there you move that thing around to
[24:10] meet the challenge of the fiery dart
[24:14] take the helmet of salvation and the
[24:16] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[24:18] God verse 18 praying always with all
[24:22] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[24:25] and watching thereunto with all
[24:28] perseverance and supplication for All
[24:32] Saints well so much for reading it
[24:33] quickly I broke it down a little bit
[24:36] didn't I and I want to pull out granny's
[24:40] classic amplified bible here this has
[24:44] been around for a long long time this
[24:46] was my grandmother's amplified bible and
[24:49] i want to read those same verses to you
[24:52] in this version because it lives it's
[24:57] amplified no doubt about it and so in
[25:01] verse 10 again Ephesians 6 in conclusion
[25:06] be strong in the Lord be
[25:12] powered through your union with him
[25:17] isn't that precious it's precious to me
[25:23] be strong in the Lord how how can we be
[25:28] strong in him we are empowered we are
[25:32] endued with power from on high through
[25:37] our union our oneness our relationship
[25:44] with him
[25:46] you can't live a detached life way out
[25:50] there somewhere on the edge and expect
[25:53] to move in the strength and the power of
[25:57] the Lord you've got to come a little
[26:00] closer you've got to draw near remember
[26:04] the Bible says Jesus tells us if you
[26:07] draw nigh to me I will draw nigh to you
[26:10] this is the promise of the scripture we
[26:13] come near to the Lord and he draws
[26:16] nearer to us we have to come a little
[26:19] closer if you're cold if you're if
[26:21] you're if you're suffering and needy you
[26:24] come a little closer to the fire and
[26:26] there you can feel with with more
[26:30] intensity the heat that the fire
[26:33] provides coming closer to the Lord with
[26:37] our thoughts even even with our thoughts
[26:41] you know our concept of drawing closer
[26:44] to the Lord is often I got to pray more
[26:47] got a fast more got to go to church more
[26:48] got to sing more got it and and yes it's
[26:52] true the the closer we get to his heart
[26:55] the more we love the things that he
[26:58] loves and we gain strength from the
[27:02] corporate gathering of the Saints and we
[27:05] gain strength from fasting in prayer all
[27:08] of these things are true but that's not
[27:10] exactly what drawing closer to the Lord
[27:14] is all about it's moving your heart and
[27:17] and how do we do that we can only do
[27:21] that with our thoughts with our mind
[27:25] it's being more mindful keeping the Lord
[27:30] on our mind the Bible said I will keep
[27:34] him in or them in great peace those who
[27:39] love the law of the Lord and nothing
[27:44] shall by any means offend them great
[27:48] peace have they which love the law of
[27:51] God and nothing shall by any means if in
[27:55] them if you want to stay out of the
[27:58] arena of offense in your life you've got
[28:01] to keep your peace and God's peace in
[28:05] your own thoughts when we draw closer to
[28:09] the Lord and we take confidence in his
[28:12] strength and his power it releases a
[28:15] dimension of Shalom a dimension of peace
[28:20] Shalom is not just peace as defined by
[28:26] by saying the absence of conflict or war
[28:29] but the Shalom of God is a level of
[28:34] wholeness it's a level of completeness
[28:37] okay it's a level of Union this
[28:43] amplified brings it out so beautifully
[28:46] be empowered through your union with him
[28:53] experience wholeness and completeness as
[28:57] you draw near to the Lord in your
[29:01] thoughts in your mind and what you think
[29:05] on your life is going to follow you lead
[29:08] your life not by your actions no your
[29:13] actions are the result of your thoughts
[29:15] you lead your life by what you think
[29:18] about what you think about is what
[29:20] you're going to become the Bible said
[29:22] out out of the abundance of the heart
[29:24] the mouth speaketh and the Bible also
[29:27] says as a man thinketh in his heart
[29:32] think about that as a man thinketh in
[29:35] his heart it's not talking about the
[29:38] brain
[29:38] it's talking about the mind as a man
[29:41] thinketh in his heart so he is one
[29:46] translation said so he is what he thinks
[29:50] he is he is no I tell you that's a
[29:55] powerful phrase because if you allow the
[29:58] enemy to convince you that you're a
[30:00] failure and a loser and unsavable and
[30:03] unredeemable and and a wretch and can
[30:06] never never be anything you are you
[30:10] really are what you have allowed the
[30:13] enemy to convince you you are you won't
[30:15] you won't succeed at anything you want
[30:17] to accomplish anything but it's not
[30:19] because you really are those things it's
[30:23] because you've you have believed it in
[30:26] your own heart and you've confessed it
[30:29] with your own mouth that's why lies are
[30:33] the biggest fiery darts that the enemy
[30:37] is shooting against the body of Christ
[30:39] in this hour I've got the shield of
[30:42] faith I'm gonna stop those fiery darts
[30:45] and again that's not automatic
[30:48] remember how we do that let's let's
[30:50] let's look at those lies those negative
[30:53] thoughts as fiery darts and remember in
[30:57] this study we gave you some of the keys
[31:01] of how we pull down those strongholds
[31:04] casting down imaginations and that's how
[31:08] we deal with those fiery darts i I was
[31:10] almost going to go backward in my notes
[31:12] but if you missed any of this series I
[31:16] invite you to the web to YouTube because
[31:21] every one of these programs are
[31:24] available on YouTube and if it's a new
[31:28] program you're watching it may not be
[31:30] there right this moment but it will be
[31:32] in a few days and so you can go to
[31:35] youtube and you can watch them at your
[31:37] convenience and I know an hour is a long
[31:40] time but YouTube is kind of handy
[31:42] because if you watch it and you watch a
[31:45] portion of it and you go back later on
[31:48] the same browser to watch it it have a
[31:50] little
[31:51] over there and you can press it and
[31:53] it'll show you where you're left off and
[31:55] you can just take up and go right on and
[31:57] one of the ways to get updated so that
[32:00] you'll know when we add a new program is
[32:02] to subscribe I think we we have maybe
[32:05] 1,200 subscribers I'd like to have I'd
[32:08] like to have 25,000 I'd like to have a
[32:12] hundred thousand not so that I could
[32:15] brag I'm not a preacher who has ever
[32:17] based my life and ministry on numbers
[32:19] but so that I could know that what we're
[32:23] doing is affecting more and more people
[32:27] blessing strengthening encouraging more
[32:30] and more people I have the easiest part
[32:33] of this job I just come in here and do
[32:36] what I love doing trying to find the
[32:39] channel of God's anointing and
[32:41] expounding to you the word as God has
[32:44] opened it up to me and I know I fall
[32:46] short many times explaining things and
[32:49] making them as clear to you as God has
[32:52] made them to me but I do the very best I
[32:54] can but there's there's brothers behind
[32:57] the scenes who work much harder than I
[33:00] do to make this happen
[33:02] a brother who handles the video portion
[33:06] and a brother who handles the audio
[33:08] portion and all that goes into that this
[33:11] would not be possible without them and
[33:14] then you consider the gospel channel the
[33:17] programs have to be played they have to
[33:19] be put in the computer system and they
[33:22] had those people have to believe God for
[33:25] the finances to pay for the satellite to
[33:28] pay for the cable so that it can come to
[33:31] you I want you to know this is a huge
[33:33] labor of love much bigger than what a
[33:35] lot of people realize and so when you
[33:38] partner with us with the gospel channel
[33:41] in your prayers and in your support you
[33:44] then become an active player a partner
[33:47] in what God is doing every one of these
[33:50] needs and the prayers that are being
[33:52] prayed over them and because you made it
[33:55] possible and when these testimonies
[33:58] begin to come in you've got a part in
[34:00] the blessing you have a part in it
[34:02] because you've been fed
[34:04] that's how it works so I won't go back I
[34:07] was tempted but I won't go back and and
[34:10] reteach what we've already covered but
[34:12] you find it on YouTube you go back and
[34:15] get it on YouTube new hope revival
[34:17] ministries now let's go on in the
[34:20] amplified for just a moment before my
[34:22] time gets completely away from me but on
[34:26] the whole armour of God
[34:28] oh I gotta go back to verse 10 in
[34:30] conclusion be strong in the Lord be
[34:33] empowered through your union with him I
[34:37] can hardly say that without choking draw
[34:41] your strength from him I want you to
[34:47] know your true strength doesn't come
[34:49] from vitamins or as we say an Alabama
[34:52] vitamins your true strength doesn't come
[34:56] from your mineral supplements and I
[34:58] believe in all of those things and I use
[35:00] them in my life that helps my physical
[35:03] body but I want you to know your true
[35:06] strength comes from the Lord and when we
[35:11] recognize that it it behooves us it
[35:15] compels us to want to be even more
[35:18] connected to him when we can recognize
[35:21] that he is our true source then you are
[35:25] not gonna let I'm not gonna let anything
[35:27] come between me and my source and so
[35:30] when doubt starts creeping in I gotta
[35:32] kick it out and when other past-times
[35:35] begin to rob me of my God time of my
[35:39] union time my fellowship time I gotta
[35:42] cut that out now I enjoy certain certain
[35:46] aspects of social media I do I enjoy
[35:51] certain aspects of Facebook and I enjoy
[35:54] certain aspects of Instagram and I'm not
[35:59] too much into Twitter but I'm there you
[36:01] can find me there but it's just because
[36:04] I I forget to tweet you know but I'm
[36:07] there there's certain aspects of it that
[36:10] make me make me crazy you know angry
[36:14] upset they disturb my peace
[36:17] but there are certain aspects of staying
[36:20] connected that I absolutely love one for
[36:25] instance I'll give you this example a
[36:27] few years ago I went through several
[36:29] surgeries one of them a little more
[36:31] serious than the others and one was a
[36:34] colon surgery and then the other were
[36:36] both foot surgeries and there was some
[36:40] recovery time involved etc and it
[36:42] changed my life for a period of time and
[36:45] and you know I'm a I can be a private
[36:48] person to a certain extent but hey I
[36:51] needed prayer and I just blurted it out
[36:54] I mean I just put it out I'm on my way
[36:57] to you know for surgery and and I cannot
[37:01] tell you the strength that I got when I
[37:03] was able now for the first day you know
[37:06] after colon surgery I don't remember a
[37:09] whole lot I remember the first time the
[37:11] same day they got me up to walk and I
[37:13] didn't want to walk I wanted to hurt
[37:15] somebody in fact but I didn't but I
[37:19] remember walking and and I don't
[37:21] remember a whole lot about it but by the
[37:23] next day I was able to look on Facebook
[37:27] and see the hundreds of people that were
[37:30] praying for me and I had a hard road to
[37:33] go for a few days that was very sick the
[37:35] pain medicine made me very sick but any
[37:38] chance I could could get to read what
[37:41] people were saying and their well wishes
[37:43] and their prayers was strength to me and
[37:46] so even though there's a lot of junk
[37:49] involved in some of that there can also
[37:51] be a lot of strength in that you can
[37:53] find our ministry on Facebook new hope
[37:55] revival ministries is there you can find
[37:58] us on Instagram because I think it's a
[38:01] smart idea to use as many avenues as we
[38:05] possibly can to let people know we're in
[38:08] this for the long haul that this is the
[38:10] you know we want to be the real deal
[38:12] we're not trying to build a ministry
[38:15] we're trying to help build a part of the
[38:17] kingdom of God and that's why I'm so
[38:20] thankful for the gospel Channel I pastor
[38:22] a small Church in Alabama and we have
[38:26] quite a few streamers around the world
[38:28] people who stream
[38:29] our service is live at revival org and
[38:33] they're connected and some of those
[38:35] people paid our tithes and some send
[38:39] offerings to help us do what we do so we
[38:41] have an extended community but I
[38:43] wouldn't be speaking to you most likely
[38:45] today if it weren't for the gospel
[38:48] channel if it was not for the sacrifice
[38:51] that they have made brother Eric
[38:53] Erickson has made all of these years so
[38:55] let's pray a little extra for them let's
[38:58] do what we can to keep that ministry
[39:01] expanding because then that gives our
[39:04] ministry and many many other ministries
[39:07] and opportunity to keep expanding
[39:09] getting our pulpit a little bit larger I
[39:12] keep getting off on these little bunny
[39:14] trails but that's okay it's alright
[39:17] because sometimes the Lord can be in the
[39:19] bunny trails too he can speak to
[39:21] somebody through those little bunny
[39:23] trail Center you know those little
[39:25] little anyway let's look at this again
[39:30] be empowered through you draw your
[39:33] strength from him we get certain amount
[39:38] of strength I think that's how I was
[39:39] starting we get certain amount of
[39:41] strength from one another it helps us to
[39:43] know that folk are praying but at the
[39:45] end of this what if it's just you and
[39:48] the Lord are you gonna be a weak puddle
[39:51] on the floor no because if you are
[39:55] walking with the Lord his joy is your
[39:59] strength his peace is your strength his
[40:02] spirit becomes your strength that
[40:07] strength which his boundless might
[40:11] provides praise God verse 11 put on
[40:17] God's whole armor all of it the armor of
[40:23] a heavy armed soldier that's who you are
[40:28] which God supplies where does the armor
[40:32] come from it comes from God it's the
[40:37] armor of God the armor of
[40:40] Lord that you may be able to that you
[40:44] may be able successfully to stand up
[40:49] against all the strategies and the
[40:54] deceits of the devil the schemes and
[40:56] devices of the devil for we are not
[41:00] wrestling with flesh and blood
[41:02] contending only with physical opponents
[41:05] but against despotisms against the
[41:10] powers against the master spirits who
[41:13] are the world rulers of this present
[41:18] darkness against the spirit forces of
[41:23] wickedness in the heavenly supernatural
[41:27] sphere that's what we were talking about
[41:30] a few moments ago there's a force behind
[41:34] a lot of what you're going through right
[41:36] now it's not just the people that you
[41:38] know involved but there's oftentimes
[41:41] something much darker much larger that's
[41:46] behind the scene but thanks be to God my
[41:50] union with him gives me strength and
[41:52] empowers me to deal with all of that I
[41:55] don't care how high I don't care what
[41:58] authority the enemy comes with we were
[42:01] talking about ranks in the angelic and
[42:03] in the demonic I don't care if the king
[42:06] of all the demons comes if we know who
[42:10] we are
[42:11] who's we are if we are drawing our
[42:14] strength from the Lord and from his word
[42:17] we do not have to fear the enemy don't
[42:21] you let fear rule your life sure they're
[42:26] scary things that happen especially in
[42:29] the realm of darkness are in the realm
[42:31] of the New Age or witchcraft or the
[42:33] demonic sure there are some scary things
[42:36] that happen but greater is He that is in
[42:39] me in you than he that is in the world
[42:43] behold I give you power jesus said over
[42:46] certain
[42:48] lower levels of of wickedness or certain
[42:53] ranks no that's not what he said is it I
[42:56] give you power over all the powers of
[43:01] the enemy so when we know that we are in
[43:06] union with him in relationship and
[43:09] fellowship with them when we know that
[43:11] we are drawing our strength from him it
[43:14] doesn't matter what rank the enemy is or
[43:17] how how many there are
[43:21] we have great peace we have confidence
[43:25] that the Lord is going to get us through
[43:27] every bit of it therefore put on God's
[43:31] complete armor that you may be able to
[43:34] resist and stand your ground not giving
[43:39] the enemy a millimeter not giving the
[43:44] enemy an inch because as we sometimes
[43:47] say if you give the devil an inch he'll
[43:50] never stop with an inch Willy he'll take
[43:53] the mile you give the enemy a millimeter
[43:56] and he's gonna want a kilometre he's
[43:59] gonna want to come in and take more and
[44:01] more and more and more I believe it was
[44:04] the last time that we were together we
[44:06] were talking about dethroning Satan
[44:10] dethroning the enemy in our life moving
[44:13] him off the throne so that God can
[44:17] establish his kingdom where the enemy
[44:20] has come in as a squatter and built his
[44:24] throne his high place over your life my
[44:28] thank God that we have a force we have a
[44:33] God with us
[44:35] who has all power against all the enemy
[44:38] all right he says put on the on God's
[44:42] complete armor that you may be able to
[44:45] resist and stand your ground on the evil
[44:48] day of danger and having done all the
[44:53] crisis demands to stand firmly in your
[44:59] place uh uh there
[45:01] I'm not giving up any ground at all
[45:05] therefore stand there for verse 14 hold
[45:11] your ground
[45:13] having tightened I like it having
[45:16] tightened the belt of truth around your
[45:20] loins you know that is the girding of
[45:26] the loins that is the girdle of truth
[45:30] that the Old Testament talks about this
[45:34] translation uses the belt of truth and
[45:37] tightening that and of course you know
[45:40] the scripture talks about girding up
[45:42] your loins for running and that was
[45:44] tucking in the the longer tales of the
[45:48] of the garment and tucking it in that
[45:50] tightened girdle or that tighten belt so
[45:53] that the legs would be more free to run
[45:56] think about the fact that this the the
[46:01] the thigh area the loin area that is a
[46:05] portion of the core of the body and
[46:08] that's where our strength is we really
[46:12] need to strengthen the core of our
[46:16] bodies physically as well as spiritually
[46:19] and so this is not just any belt or any
[46:25] any girdle or any tightening mechanism
[46:29] but this is the belt of truth so we are
[46:35] strengthening our core so that we can
[46:39] stand longer and firmer against the
[46:43] onslaught of the enemy and what are we
[46:46] strengthening our core with what are we
[46:49] strengthening our our loins our thighs
[46:52] our hips with we are strengthening it
[46:56] with T are you th truth and truth is not
[47:02] just a doctrine it's not just a
[47:05] particular Bible passage truth is a
[47:08] person jesus said I am the way I am the
[47:13] truth
[47:13] I am the life so we're literally
[47:17] strengthening our core by by belting on
[47:21] by tightening the Lord Jesus his word
[47:24] his truth around that part of our body
[47:28] strengthening us to stand longer
[47:30] strengthening ourselves to run faster to
[47:34] endure with greater strength and greater
[47:39] vitality I like that so much
[47:42] hold your ground having tightened the
[47:45] belt of truth around your loins and
[47:48] having put on the breastplate remember
[47:52] King James says of righteousness but the
[47:56] amplified here says the breastplate of
[47:59] integrity and of moral rectitude and
[48:03] right standing with God I want to I want
[48:08] to say something about that you know
[48:10] integrity is an interesting word because
[48:14] integrity is measured by by what you do
[48:17] when no one is looking when no one is
[48:20] around we can perform for the for the
[48:24] folk around us but when we choose to do
[48:27] the right thing when the opportunity
[48:29] presents itself to do the wrong thing
[48:32] and we choose the right thing anyway and
[48:34] no one would know no one would know that
[48:38] we that we took the wrong path no one
[48:41] would know that we took something
[48:42] perhaps it wasn't ours but we choose not
[48:45] to do that because there is a there's a
[48:48] level of integrity that God has helped
[48:51] to establish in our lives but I also
[48:54] want you to look at this it it defines
[48:58] righteousness here in the amplified as
[49:00] not just integrity or our moral
[49:04] rectitude but right standing with God
[49:08] now how can we stand right with God
[49:13] that's what righteousness is a right
[49:16] standing or standing right with God how
[49:20] can we do that well I'll tell you we
[49:22] cannot do it in the flesh with our human
[49:26] effort
[49:27] we cannot attain true righteousness true
[49:33] right standing with God but it's by our
[49:37] union with him it's by letting him be
[49:40] our identity finding our identity in him
[49:43] it's by allowing him to live his
[49:50] righteousness in us for us through us
[49:55] that's how we can use the breastplate of
[49:59] righteousness it's it's beyond it's not
[50:03] just the breastplate of our moral right
[50:06] standing or our integrity or our
[50:10] righteousness but it's the breastplate
[50:13] of his righteousness it's letting his
[50:18] truth become a breastplate in our life
[50:22] and his holiness his integrity his
[50:26] righteousness I'll tell you sometimes we
[50:31] can hardly make the right choice without
[50:34] his strength sometimes the enemy is
[50:37] screaming in our ear you just do that
[50:40] nobody will know it's just one little
[50:42] thing that kind of that kind of struggle
[50:44] can go on and you could be swept away
[50:48] I could be swept away in one moment of
[50:52] yielding to this golden opportunity so
[50:55] to speak that the enemy places before us
[50:58] and and I tell you I've been in a
[51:01] situation or two like that on my
[51:02] Christian journey and I did not have
[51:07] within me maybe the strength to make the
[51:11] right decision on my own but I recognize
[51:14] that it's so important to recognize that
[51:18] I didn't feel defeated
[51:20] I just felt powerless to do the right
[51:25] thing it was a big situation and it
[51:29] would have been so easy to have yielded
[51:31] to the voice but how did I get out of it
[51:35] not by not by saying I've always made
[51:38] the right decision so I'll just make the
[51:40] right
[51:40] decision no it was by crying out to God
[51:43] I do not have the strength to choose the
[51:48] right path this time alone I need your
[51:53] strength
[51:54] I need an impartation of your integrity
[51:59] if I face this alone I'm very likely to
[52:04] fall but if I can know in my heart that
[52:07] you're facing this with me and that by
[52:11] choosing the right thing I'm pleasing
[52:14] you and you're going to cover me and
[52:17] protect me and you're going to become my
[52:19] breastplate of righteousness in this
[52:22] battle I can do it I can choose the
[52:25] right thing I can turn down the golden
[52:27] opportunity that the enemy has offered
[52:30] me and settle seemingly for for taking
[52:36] the right path which is going to be you
[52:39] know less productive it appears and and
[52:43] certainly not as much finance involved
[52:47] and not as much ease involved and it's
[52:50] going to be a harder path but I was able
[52:53] to do that because I remembered if if
[52:58] this whole thing is depending on my
[53:00] ability to always have integrity and do
[53:04] the right thing we may get in trouble
[53:06] but I have another source I have another
[53:11] source of strength I have another source
[53:13] of integrity I have another source of
[53:17] moral uprightness and righteousness it's
[53:20] his it's his righteousness that he's
[53:24] making available to me in God's armor I
[53:28] hope that speaks to you and how
[53:31] important is the armor well it protects
[53:36] two of the most vital organs of the body
[53:39] and maybe more it protects the lungs you
[53:42] got to have lungs to breathe and it
[53:45] protects the heart which is the blood
[53:47] pump for the entire body that
[53:49] breastplate of his righteousness not
[53:52] because of his race
[53:54] justise I'm gonna do the right thing
[53:56] because of his righteousness I'm gonna
[53:59] move in integrity but I must remember
[54:01] that my source of being morally upright
[54:06] is him my strength to do the right thing
[54:10] is from him well my time is gone but I
[54:14] have thoroughly enjoyed our time
[54:17] together in the word and if I offend you
[54:20] by raising my voice
[54:21] I almost apologize but it's the only way
