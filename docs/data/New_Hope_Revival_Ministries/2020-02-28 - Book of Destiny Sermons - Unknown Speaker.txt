TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus received a change of clothes he laid aside the glory he shared with the father it's at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ it's your faith that has been tried by the fire would be worthy of the well done he chooses to see what he saw about me that's mercy my love his grace take your place and take it now your family is at stake it's never too late for a man of integrity to go before God on behalf of his children [Music] [Music] would you go back to Psalm 139 verses 16 through 18 nine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them praise the Lord if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee let me read it as you're just listening carefully in there in the complete Jewish Bible your eyes could see me as an embryo but in your book all my days were already written my days have been shaped before any of them existed God how I prized your thoughts how many of them there are if I count them there are more than grains of sand if I finish the count I am still with you or with thee thank you Lord for that father we thank you tonight for direction that comes to our hearts from your word it lives lord I thank you that your word lives I thank you that your spirit is ever nearer to quicken your word to make words on a page become alive in our lives one thing I know Lord is you can't teach or preach revelation and expect it to be received as such it requires that the Holy Ghost works on both ends Lord of this channel tonight I pray Lord that somebody would catch a depth of what you would say to us a concerning the books of heaven I pray Lord that it would make somebody's way easier and that they might get a hold of something that would give them peace and not turmoil for Lord we thank you that you have seen it all and you intend to stay with us every step of every mile until we have finished the course Lord that's why we know we can make it because you are with us every step of the way we give you this time together in your word now for your glory and we give you honor and praise b'shem adonai Yahshua HaMashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen the Saints said a man so you may be seated I just want to stay with my notes here for just a moment I want to read a few statements to you that we hopefully mentioned some of them on Sunday we believe that every child of God has a record written I like to say a book scroll about them but I'll just quickly say this and then I won't have to say it again it was already mentioned Sunday I don't know what it looks like exactly and I don't know if yours is yours alone or if we're in a book of families or in a I don't know exactly how it is but I know it's there because the Bible said so now I need to be honest with you and tell you that there are many different interpretations of these verses of Scripture and the reason why I choose to preach them and teach them and believe them as I have presented them to you and others have in this pulpit is because it lines up with the message that we have been given I believe with all my heart that this is really a foundational verse or two - to help us understand that not only has God had lots of thoughts about us he wrote him down they are recorded in heaven and he is I tell you he is committed he is fully committed to his word and if it was God's thoughts that he had about you and it was recorded then that is an expression of the thought that becomes his word so if he watches over his word he watches over all of his words do you believe that not just what we have in the written record like whether Carrie taught us and and and I tell you it is something that maybe we knew but but it never hit us like it did until he said it so clearly because we limit some time what the word is to the written record of the word but he's a living he's alive and that is just a portion and any of God's thoughts that that he has expressed well then that becomes a part of his word so it wouldn't be wrong to say that in the message of the hour we also have contained in those messages the words of God in that right now the words of men might also be there because brother Branham is greeting the people and addressing news stories and different things but we know that in those sermons there the Word of God is there it lines up amen and we're thankful for that so we believe every child of God has a written record in the heavenlies about their life God's thoughts about them and toward them we believe from this this scripture and other scriptures that God saw us in our earthly form before we ever existed so he not only had a thought about what we would be spiritually but he also saw that we would it be expressed at some point and he knew exactly what point that was in a physical body of flesh and we know that because this was the plan even for God to come down and walk among us we some denied Redemption it's the greatest story that's ever been told and it required that the thoughts of God become manifest in a body of flesh to flesh out what God had purposed in his heart and you and I are here for a very similar and we must begin to see that and even if we don't know every detail that's written about us I want you to know we who believe this endtime truth we have a lot better idea of what our life is supposed to be than most people out there my heart was moved as as Zachary began to pray tonight and talk about those that he knows he's like most of you he works out there he's rubbing shoulders with hopeless people and even before he said that as some of the prayer requests well I think it might have been his prayer request that brought this thought to my mind and I just said Lord it's not always easy with you I don't believe he got offended that's that's just where it is it's not always easy when we have him because the enemy is always there to try to you know break the fellowship but I cannot imagine I cannot imagine trying to make it without him I mean I know there's even medications and things that can help people get over some of their problems and and and and do deal with some of their blueness and and depressions and so forth like that but my what they have to deal with to get to get that all those side effects and all the different things that go with it and if I did I tell you if we didn't have the Lord we couldn't make it and it ought to give us that same burden that Zachary was praying with tonight Lord help help him and help us to be alive so I'm saying that God saw our days he saw it all I believe even before the foundation of the world was laid he saw our choices he saw our decisions he knew our abilities he knew our strengths our gifts and he even knew our weaknesses it's important to know that he knew everything there was to know about us and therefore our story our Destiny's story is designed based on everything God knew about us our strengths our weaknesses think about it and he knew what it would take to bring us to a place that we could get over those weaknesses and even God said I'm gonna let leave that there he could have taken it I know he could have before it ever began but I'm gonna leave it there because I'm gonna find a place to glorify my name I'm gonna find a place to glorify Who I am and what I can do and and this time not in not in the crops that someone plants or in the battles that a particular army wins but this time I'm going to display my glory and my power and my sovereignty in a people now that's pretty good because you're chosen to be a part of those people then we believe that those thoughts were then recorded in a heavenly record and we sometimes say God wrote it down I don't know who wrote it down but it was written and we say Paul wrote this and Moses wrote that and David wrote this and we know that it came to them by inspiration but all of them didn't always do the writing they had scribes and I know that there are heavenly hosts that stay very very busy because God hasn't stopped thinking think of this he's still thinking and so they're still recording I like that because that means that there are blessings and there are other things along the way to help us sometimes a little little wippen to get us out of the permissive will and back to the perfect will of God and even that's hand designed by loving God I'm thankful you know you could just take his hand off of us and say you just find the perfect wheel the best way you can but he finds ways to guide us and to point us I'm thankful for that so after these thoughts are in the mind of God than they've been recorded in a heavenly record the destiny and kingdom purpose for each of our lives was written long before we were ever born not just the number of our days don't think that it was just this one is going to live 70 years and 211 days and 14 hours and so many minutes and so many seconds he didn't just see our days by number but he saw our days also with content he saw different things that we would do for the kingdom of God he saw things that we would do of our own will and a court and he designed a plan as we just said a moment ago to get us back over to his will you've got a whole list of things that God is going to receive out of your life before you get out of here you understand that remember the teaching on a word sent from God you are you are a word sent from God you were first a thought band you have been expressed and therefore your word and remember what God said about his word and remember also that he was wooing over the water where those fallen seed were the seed of the original creation I read again some of the things that brother Bantam said about that even this afternoon and the Holy Spirit is just guarding and wooing and brooding and making love over the seed of the original civilization he called it in one quote and that was because it was there by the spoken word of God therefore it was the seed of God a thought of God a word of God and if God was so careful by the holy spirit the gentle dove to woo and guard that part of his word that would be brought back into fulfillment into reality and to be I guess we could say fleshed out if God was that careful to guard that word how much more careful is he to guard us our life because he sees the list the list is ever before him of what he intends to accomplish in our life I don't believe we're going to be judged in heaven based on you accomplishing more than me or me accomplishing more than you I don't think that's what rewards are all about I think rewards are about finishing my book did you finish your scroll and we'll show you some things that the scriptures say later and the message that really indicate that that is what a lot of it is about remember brother Branham said we will not stand the bride at the white throne judgment because we're being judged now well we know that means with trials and troubles and furnaces and tribulations but what we also might consider is that we are being judged now and evaluated now by how much of our scroll let's say a scroll tonight how much of our scroll are we living out I want you to know as sincere as I know how to be tonight I'm concerned about mine that's why I'm here tonight that's why I'm talking about this again I don't know what to say and I don't think it's even necessary to to try to figure out what to say to let you think that I'm sincere but I'm very very very sincere I'm concerned about my scroll I'm concerned about my book I I don't even have time to look back to see all the things that I think have been ticked off the list I hope I get some more I like to reminisce I do and I hope that I can get some time one of these days again to go back and think about things that have been marked off my list but now I'm getting very concerned about what's ahead and what's laying there on my list in my book or my scroll that was God's purpose for my life that I have not yet fulfilled and and in order for me to finish the rest I've got to get back to if I'm not there now I've got to get back to the perfect will of God right in His perfect will because it's only in the perfect will of God that those thoughts are ticked off checked off do you understand that I know you do you must you have to all right so I believe we have an individual record I believe he saw our activities he saw what we would accomplish in life and I don't want to get ahead of myself why I'm not going to say it either not just I'll get to it I want to just get to it and not and not then what happens sometime is I I get way over there and then I have a hard time because I want to come back the next service in and catch up and I can't always do that and so one day you you can just read all of this for yourself if you've got the patience you can just read it but but we're in a battle we are in a battle and and the battle is to get low enough to get humble enough to get surrendered enough and submitted enough that he can accomplish everything that he thought about us everything that was written in his record about us and we should be more concerned about getting into that position to do what's in the book then we should trying to discover what's written I don't believe it has to be a secret in fact I'll show you later that there are some ways to begin to discover if you haven't already what God's purpose in your life is but I think sometimes we get so caught up in trying to figure out what part we play maybe what office we are in the five fold or what our direction is or what our gifts are we want to identify that in our own lives we want to identify that in each other's lives and sometimes we can get so caught up in the frustration of not really knowing that we forget there's there's preparation that only you and I can make I don't care how many trials he designs I don't care how many tests come our way at the thoughts of the Lord only you can decide how you're going to respond do you hear me so so you might have another lap around the mountain you may see Kadesh Barnea again and I believe that that is part of what we can we can make some we can make some changes in the duration of some of the things that we have to walk through and we can make some some variations in some of the of the connections that we have to make in life by just getting surrendered Lord we want to get as low before you as we possibly can as humble before you and so we are not looking back to see our trophies but we're just looking ahead saying Lord let me walk out one more page you know if you can't think about a whole book 600 pages or more about you why don't you just say Lord get me a page let me just see what today's supposed to be I know today that I was supposed to try to keep the victory and the joy through everything the enemy sent to try to make me blue or depressed or low or whatever and by His grace I did it because I was aware of it I felt it when I woke up this morning and got in the shower I could feel that heaviness I wasn't him outside yet I could feel that heaviness and I said wait a minute I can't have that today and I just made a conscious decision and yes I've talked to myself in fact today our jet caught me talking to myself he came back to get a coffee err to get a water or something and I said oh you caught me talking to myself I guess you never do that you're probably too young but he said he does it so I guess it's not an aged thing I just speak it out sometime alright so there's a battle going on to get whatever is in that book it's been written about us to manifest and to be fleshed out here on the earth and we have to be completely surrendered to be able to do that could you all put that quote up from dr. Moses from the message dr. Moses I think it was the first one that we had there on the list in the mind of God Christ was already crucified let me just give you a quick context brother branham is talking about the serpent on the pole in the wilderness all right your so you'll know he said in the mind of God Christ was already crucified for he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world back in Eden Christ in God's thoughts which became his word listen Christ in God's thoughts which became his word had not yet materialized but he knew it was for he had promised it and he let the children of Israel draw interest before the deposit was made if you find a bank that will let you earn interest on money that you don't have in the bank let me know because that's an incredible deal isn't it brother branham said that would be a deal but that's what happened see that I thought that was so good here it was already in the mind of God so to god it was done and what he did was he sent a plan put this serpent brass serpent on a pole have everybody to look at that the disease the plague will stop and he did it based on the lamb he did it based on Calvary and Calvary had never happened and so he let them draw a part of Redemption plan before it had ever been purchased because in the mind of God the lamb was already slain in that good amen - so to show that it was him knowing what was going to be he made something here that represent it and that was the the serpent on the pole so through the serpent they could see what was going to happen and through that they received their healing do you like that that is powerful you don't learn that just in an average Sunday school that's powerful you see even Jesus had a destiny that was already from the mind of God because remember he said there he said Christ in God's thoughts because that's where Christ originated in the thoughts of God there's only one God the only one person in God correct and so there's no eternal Sun and so before this thing is over we will look again at the counsel of heaven because the church really likes to talk about the Council of heaven and they like to use Genesis to talk about the Council of heaven let us make man in our image so that we will know there are at least three people sitting around a conference table deciding how Redemption is going to come but how many of you know it wasn't near that difficult because there was only one thinking there was only one mind involved in this that was the mind of God we can say it that way God the mind of God but in the mind of God he had a plan for a son he had a plan for your Redemption and my Redemption he had a plan for how man was going to fall and a plan for how man was going to get to where he could trust a portion of the plan which was the older covenant until he could see the fulfillment and reality of the plan he took care of it and he spread it out think of this he spread it out across the years he could have done it all had it all happen within about a day or two there in the Garden of Eden cross and all but he had a bigger plan he was teaching the people to trust he was showing a people like you and I who are in the end time who get to look back over the whole plan and we can still say no matter what we read God is good no matter what you read in the Old Testament God is good and course people have the question why did he tell him to kill their enemies and why did this have to happen and why did that plague I'm telling you if you get all the way to the end and look back you will have to say god it's good he knew what he was doing all the time so even Jesus originated as the Christ in the mind of God and there was a record written of his life and there was a writ there was a record written about his plan of redemption and what he would do and remember that the Bible said that the world could not contain the books that could have been written had they been written in the earth I'm paraphrasing but this world wouldn't be big enough so I'm telling you four Gospels is full of what he did while he was here on earth but the earth would not contain the wholeness of what he was accomplishing you know why because every move he made he was accomplishing things not just in the natural but also in the spiritual because his surrendered movement his surrendered obedience choosing to go one way to get to a place instead of the other way everything he did breaking the bread why why here he is spitting on the mud and making these mud cakes and putting them in and and and getting them to be washed out other places he didn't heal the blind that way but he did it different ways and every time he moved according to the Father's plan there were multitudes of things being accomplished in both realms famines were being ended and disease was stopping and we don't know what all was happening but we know that because he lived a surrendered and laid down life to the will of the Father we know that every movement that he made was accomplishing great things but none of them a surprise through the Eternal Spirit of the Father God who thought it all and recorded it all so Jesus is more than the written word Christ is more than just the written record of the word he is the word in that right all right now let's look at this verse hebrews chapter 10 verses 5 through 9 and yes we read this i'm watching the time but we're gonna read it again quickly verse 5 Hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings that what is not but a body hast thou prepared me interesting we know the sacrifice and offerings that he's talking about is the older covenant right it's the two rides the instruction of the law it the whole plan of sacrifices are you with me it's the whole plan of offerings every bit of it intricately meticulously designed with with God having an opinion about every detail you know that don't you every color and every material that was used in this whole process in the tabernacle and in the temple was chosen by God to represent something the number of sockets the number of poles in the tabernacle the dimensions of the of though of the curtains that that hung between the poles every bit of it the shape of the camp around the tabernacle God had an opinion about all of it so anybody who looks at the Old Testament and then comes to the New Testament day and say I don't think God cares about too much I want you to know he cares about everything that touches your life every detail he cares about it you believe that he might even care about what vehicle you drive I hope he does because when you're standing there not knowing what to do you sure would like a help from the Lord with you what's your wheel so yes he does all right so he when he cometh into the world sacrifice and offerings that wood is not but a body has thou prepared me and there was a plan for that and a reason for that there was a purpose in all of that in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has no pleasure even though at one time that was exactly what God was requiring but now we have a fleshing out of the word the word the thought of God the mind of God concerning Christ is now being fleshed out and it cannot be fleshed out in lambs and bulls and goats and washings and and fiery offerings it can only be fleshed out in a house in a body then said i lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me everything in that Bible that written record of God's Word that we have every bit of that is written about Jesus how many of you believe that well I mean let me get you caught up for just a moment now please do if you can stay right with me everything in that written record but remember that's not all that God thought and so everything there there must be other books written in the heavenlies with details even about the life and Ministry of Christ that we don't know anything about just yet but he has come to fulfill everything in that written record and he has come to fulfill everything that's been written about him in the heavenlies did you see that you understand that that could very well be the case all right I excuse me in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin that what is not neither hets pleasure there in which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second it was God's perfect plan for the word to be fleshed out in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ what condescension what a what a long long way he came stepping down from that glorious throne to live in a very humble body and think about we know what the Prophet taught us his birth was announced where two Shepherds hard-working farmers you know just common people modern politicians think those common people don't have as much gray matter as some of the rest of us but God must have felt something different he chose to announce his birth to shepherds he wasn't born in a sterile hospital room but but in a in a place where the venom said a manure pile just as humble as it gets those swaddling clothes were those stinking oily and sometimes bloody rags that were used to wipe down the cattle they weren't swaddling blankets warmed in a in an incubator little pink and blue stripes like you get from Medical Center these were used rags didn't make a difference he was coming and there was nothing that could touch him there wasn't a disease that could touch him no siree he was coming and a plan was going to be fulfilled do you believe that so I believe it too so there was a book in heaven that chronicled the kingdom purpose of the Lord Jesus and how it would be fulfilled in the earth can I have divine love please the one from the message divine love let's look at that last Sunday with you here I believe I preached on the assurance the power that God had promised and ordained you and called you before the foundation of the world notice this now ordained you and called you so he didn't just choose you or think a good thought about you but he ordained you do you know what the word ordained means to give authority to give position to to say for instance if a minister is going to have a a place in the at least in the church world in the hierarchy of the church world before he gets up and preaches and and can say I'm a minister and I have a public ministry and I can carry out the ordinances of the church there's a process he goes through but once he receives that ordination it means he has the backing of the church he has the backing of the body now the scripture saying I mean excuse me the quote the message is saying here that before I believe I preached on the assurance the power that God had promised and ordained you and called you before the foundation of the world so not just thought about or chosen but ordained meaning God said that one is mine I'm gonna get my glory from him I'm gonna get my will accomplished through that one there was an ordination and then he said he ordained you and called you before the foundation of the world and put your name in his book you believe that you believe your name is in his book do you believe it I believe it I believe my name is in his book I believe you ordain me and called me before the foundation of the world here is where some people really have a struggle but to me it just causes me to rest you had nothing to do with it and truly you didn't and here's what he's saying he's not saying you didn't have a choice he's not saying that at all he's saying you had nothing to do with God choosing you you had nothing to do with God giving you the power and ordaining you and calling you before the foundation of the world you weren't around you were only a thought in his mind so you couldn't qualify yourself and you couldn't disqualify yourself he's not saying there's not a plan for repentance he's not saying that you don't have a choice of freewill let me tell you something that freewill that God has given us to make our own decisions and choices it means more than just our choice to serve Him we have a free will and that means sometimes I've heard some of these young men let me say this I've heard some of these young men and they're praying different ones and I've also said this many times in private prayer I don't know what public prayer but but then there's a song also that we sing that says I give you permission Lord we give you permission to come and have your way with us tonight how do you feel about that I feel good about it because your free will it's not just the one that said yes I'm gonna serve the Lord one day your free will means God has placed that there and he honors that that's why prayer is so important prayer is not you telling god what the need is help me a little bit he already knows the need so you're not praying to inform God he knows more about it and you do I wonder if he ever chuckles when we lay out the case and God said that's just what you think that's what you think's going on but that's not really what's going on he knows more about the need than we know but because he's given you free will he honors that it's gonna be important later not later deny but later on he honors that he's not going to step over your free will that's why I'm making the right decision all the time is the right thing stay with me come on look this way that's why it's so when we come into a service even every service even one we don't have a whole lot of hope for like a foggy Tuesday night he's not going to force his way on you he's not gonna push yourself on you he's waiting for you to yield yourself you don't and me I don't always have to say Lord I give you permission but I need to express to him Lord I I want to be yielded to you that's why some of these songs are more important than we realize because they become our surrender how we connect with them in faith how we believe what we're saying I'm just like some of you folks I don't particularly like that well you wouldn't believe it would you but I don't particularly like to hear the same thing over and over I don't particularly like to save the same thing I'm even worse about that if I tell you I want you to get it you know what I mean I don't mean in preaching I just mean that even in regular life but also in preaching you don't want to keep saying the same thing over here you tell your your children something you don't have to tell them again over and over again I need you to do this this and this and then them come back before you're ever finished with a list and say what would you say I can see you don't have that problem what was what was what was it I needed to do you you want it to be and so it's important to understand sometime that when we're seeing so sometimes those songs can be very repetitive some some of them but like one that we sung tonight there's that little there's that little section of that song that repeats and the music builds just a little bit and any it does something I feel it sometime when I say it over and over again I know everybody don't feel the same way but sometimes you are saying it first and singing it first by faith you don't feel that I don't feel like I want to do but you keep doing it and you're pushing in and you're confessing and you're choosing and though you may not be saying Lord I'm giving you permission the more you press in that way the more permission it's opening up the gate it's opening up the door and why did it have to be that way because God gave you a free will it's a gift but it's also a responsibility so I'm all for it I'm all for praying Lord we give you permission so that God doesn't need our permission I want you to know there are certain places where he does because he has bound himself to your free will again prayer becomes so important not to inform God of what the need is but to agree I agree with the victory Zachary said I agree with the victory I come in agreement with the victory someone called me today to give me a testimony and I'm not going to particularly share it tonight maybe later have someone else to share it but it was some pain that had been lingering a long time and a new pain had jumped on people were noticing that there was pain there and little you know handicapped a little little what would you say kind of nursing the pain having some different manifestations and then the enemy starts talking and he tells you you know this is not just a strain this is something else you get that in your head and this this brother said to me I just it got so heavy when that that morning I woke up and it got so heavy I could say I'm not even gonna say the word right now got so heavy and I just started confessing and speaking and he went on to give his testimony of how that God moved for him in that direction and that the pain was gone not just the piggy back pain but the original source of the pain was gone and I said I'm gonna pray that God will help you to remember your confession and if the enemy tries to put even a touch of that symptom on you again that you'll jump right up and make the same confession and defeat the devil the same way you're defeating him now how powerful it is what we have what's been given to us all right divine love did we get through that one no you had nothing to do with it God did it isn't that wonderful the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and why this is good it never happened till four thousand years later four thousand years later before the lamb was slain in time he was slain in eternity but not in time for four thousand years but listen to this but God when he spoke it I want you to be looking up there that's why I've decided to put it up there it's hard to follow sometime but this is a good way to see it but God when he spoke it he had to do it cause he has to keep his word his thoughts consistent his words were consistent what he designed for the Ministry of Christ was consistent and also for you he's not changing his mind about his word for you I don't care how bleak your circumstances have turned I don't care how hopeless they feel or or how many hiccups have come or things you did not see coming and you no longer see any way at all there are some things I also have in my mind that I could easily say I don't see any way in the world that could ever be like I thought it was to be but I have to remember if God thought it it is recorded and he is bound he bound himself you didn't bind him I'm not binding him he bound itself with covenant and commitment to his word and it is going to come to pass now in this case it was four thousand years later but you know you know you and I don't have four thousand years of life left so we know that there's some things that have to move for us now he said but God when he spoke it he had to do it because he has to keep his word and the same time that the lamb was wrote down watch now the same time that the lamb was wrote down you were wrote with him think of an you are already in him you are all in him when the record was made of God's plan for redemption you are already in the lamb you may see it you are already in the lamb why is that so important because you may be in a dozen different books I don't know how many individuals well maybe some folks are so busy one Scroll in heaven or one book in heaven couldn't hold all that they're going to see and accomplish and do in their life good bad and ugly or however it works but it could be you may be in more than one I don't know but I'm telling you one you are in you're in the book of the lamb the book of the lamb is the book of redemption it's not just the title deed to heaven and earth but it holds every mystery of the Bible brother Branham said that book was in the hand of God he placed that book in Adams hand is that right Adam forfeited that book that book was taken back that book is sealed was sealed with seven seals that book is the book of redemption brother Branham said it holds all the mysteries of the Bible it holds every name of every person that will ever be saved he said it and he goes on to tell us all the other things that are in it he said it's the Lamb's Book he said it's the book that reveals the Lambs work or the Lambs ministry and now he says tonight when the lamb was written there and the same time that the lamb was wrote down you were wrote with him our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life not the night we come to Christ but before the foundation of the world the Bible said so that's the assurance and brother touched on that this morning in this marvelous Sunday school reading that's the assurance the assurances you were in the lamb from before the foundation of the world when God had the design in his mind and wrote it down and recorded it in these heavenly places you were written in the book with the lamb that's powerful maybe just for me and two or three more but that for me is very very powerful so then Jesus came to this earth in closing with a passion and a commitment to complete everything that had been written of him in that heavenly record the Lambs ministry was pre-planned predetermined by God I want you to think about it just a moment sister Flo said to me one time many years ago before I ever met some of you when she had an accident on her job and the tip of her finger are really more than the tip was taken from her and it really disturbed me terribly I just couldn't stand the fact that that was taken from her and it bothered me for a lot of reasons of course I was in my early 20s and the message was so fresh and so real and so powerful and I was focusing on her more s a lady and I I felt like that would bother her and I said old sister Flo I'm so sorry that it had to be that way in my mind I thought well she'll be sub she'll be self-conscious of it and I said I'm so sorry about it she said well brother Shelly it's alright she said I've got my hand I've got my arm I've got my life and she said furthermore she said maybe it has to be like this some somebody has to be there has to be some limbs missing to fulfill the promise that missing limbs are going to be restored and you may think that was just somebody's comment to come their pastor to him but really it was faith that's what she believes that's what I believe if every bit of the Lambs ministry was recorded before the lamb was ever manifested on planet earth then God had a lot of things in his design I don't have time to talk about him but you think about it with me just a moment that means that in his mind there was a Bartimaeus and he wrote it down in his mind there was a circus and he wrote it down there was a woman with an issue of blood and he wrote it down think about the miracles there were 10 lepers that were going to come and he wrote it down if the Lambs ministry was already outlined in the mind of God and recorded in those heavenly records then every bit of what we read in the New Testament was already a part of God's plan and design and it was up to God think about this it was up to God to get Zacchaeus ff3 Zacchaeus wasn't born again Zacchaeus might have even had a problem with honesty but it was up to God to get Zacchaeus up that tree and as you've read in social media think of times it was up to God to get that tree there are you still with me I'm nearly done it was up to God to get that tree there it was up to God to get Zacchaeus of that tree why because in the mind of God concerning Christ there was a miracle that was going to take place there was a deliverance it was going to take place in Zacchaeus his life that means God had a little bit more to say in the design than what we realize want you to think about a woman it was going to have five husbands and the one she was living with at the time she met the master was not her own not her own husband and Jesus saw that and how that woman get to that place if you thinking about the Ministry of Jesus as though he was only responding to circumstances that presented themselves then you're not seeing the sovereignty of God and his plan and therefore you will see your life I hope you hear this you'll see your life that way and you'll see you as only responding to whatever circumstance comes up in your life but how many of you believe it could free some of us if we began to recognize God already made provision he already made provision for this when heaven meets earth when the plan and design that God has for us above when we bring that down the provision with it the healing with it the direction with it the right job with it the right spouse with it everything that God has remember our life is not reacting to something God didn't see coming we're reacting to things we might not have seen coming but God saw it if that is true about the Ministry of Jesus when his ministry was being wrote down you were wrote down with him that's what he said I believe it seems to fit the continuity of Scripture for me you're afraid for me to get excited I know it's it's not reactionary we make it that way you know what why because we're designed with those emotions that stand between our spirit and our soul and we react by emotion I said we whatever you want me to say we but we don't have to if I choose to act react that way I think I can choose not to react that way and I just have to say Lord this isn't mine put my hand on my knee and said Lord I've dealt with enough of my own infirmity I don't need nobody else's I'm not having this it's just the same way the brother testified on the phone today I'm not I cannot let my mind go to what this could be you know it's a sad thing in America because everybody diagnoses herself and and and I don't know what if that's always good because you can read terrible things awful things you can decide you've got two days to live and it may just be a stone it's gonna pass right listen our life is not reactionary we are not reacting to things that God didn't see coming Jesus his life was not that way he wasn't just responding to circumstances that that presented themselves he was living in sync how many of you know what it means to sink to sink your contacts every time I get in my vehicle it says sinking contacts that means I've added somebody or I've taken somebody out or I have added a birthday or I've put a phone number in and it's sinking them it means bringing all the information in different places into one place so that I can view it in different places Jesus was walking in divine synchronization with the plan that his father had already thought and it already written down you believe it and if I believe it I do and so are we that does not take responsibility off of us it puts more on because I get to choose by by the power of myself will how I react to what God already saw coming my way and how I choose to react is going to determine my victory Orma pain it's going to affect the duration of the trial and the benefit of the victory so I do have a responsibility even though my life is written for me I have a responsibility how many of you know you don't want any you don't want any disconnects you don't want any hiccups and when you're sinking stuff you don't want it one day to disappear out there you if God has a plan you want to be able to keep up with it every step of the way alright give me one more and we're doing now if it's paragraph 12 now if you want your example to lay aside your pattern to see what the scripture goes together with just lay Jesus over here and go to watching him and place it in the Bible you've got the whole thing come out right because it is the revelation of Jesus Christ the new testament and the old both all speak of Jesus would you agree Jesus Christ the Son of God cause he is the book of redemption he is the book of redemption he is the lamb he is the Lion of the tribe of juda isn'y he is the Tree of Life he is the book of redemption Jesus Christ the Son of God because he is the book of redemption he was the word and he is the word and that's bound to be him you see so this is the whole book think of this this is the whole book of redemption which is Jesus Christ fitly put together by God you believe there are any mistakes in building Jesus you believe the father built him just right in every aspect every portion of ministry fitly put together by God with the promises of redemption and healing and everything for the human being see he said do you get that now the book is Jesus Christ put together by God you're in that book and he come as a human being and redeemed us and every promise is in him and for you I'm reading every promise is in him and for you for he is the Redeemer the book of redemption is Jesus just think a moment you think this just a moment in closing is that the same book brother branham identifies the seven seal book as the book of redemption and now he says spiritually Jesus is that book remember what the scripture tells us concerning the book of the revelation there it is the apocalypsis it is the unveiling of Jesus Christ brother banner said the Tree of Life is Jesus these are all representations but very powerful ones what a glorious truth and that's what I was going to say about the book of the revelation we we know that that is not the revelation of st. John the Divine it's what the revelation of Jesus Christ has given us Saint John the Divine so that whole book is a revelation of Jesus now we know the whole Bible is the revelation of Jesus and and we know that that book of redemption was that book that was once sealed with seven seals and yes I'm getting just a bit ahead of myself but I want to leave you with something to chew on if you if you can and that is this when when we pick up in Revelation chapter 10 we see another mighty angel coming down with an open book in his hand because the seals have already been loosed correct and here's something very very powerful very simple but very powerful John is told don't go through the book don't just read the book don't just quote the book eat it eat it does that fit the continuity of Scripture it does Jesus said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this was John coming into synchronization he was coming into divine sync with what had been written about his own life and ministry in the heavenlies you believe John was chosen for the job had to be you believe every devil in Hell tried to stop John you believe they tried to make a french fry out of him banished him to an island thinking he would die if there if the wild beasts didn't kill him there might be a few remaining phoebs and vagabonds there who would kill him and might even eat him they meant to get rid of him but God was preserving him because he wasn't finish living out fleshing out hear me he wasn't finished fleshing out his book he wasn't finished living out his story in fact it couldn't be until he ate it but when he ate that book he was eating the lamb he was eating the revelation of Jesus Christ that had been hidden underneath those seals he was eating Christ in reality it was a divine experience and his commission then followed not the only Commission he ever had his final Commission the last one he was going to get you eat this book it's going to be bitter in your belly sweet in your mouth bitter in your belly and then prophesy again think about that becoming one with the word becoming one with what you eat and you're eating the book and the book is Jesus Christ you want to know what your life is about your life is revealed I'm sure there are details somewhere else but your life is revealed in the book of redemption and God has carefully designed a plan to get you an eye-to-eye you and I out of the confusion of Babylon so that we could come to a book so that we could come to a truth and eat that truth and be changed by what we eat how important is the word let's stand how important is the word how important is the message of the hour very important very important because it reveals Jesus but it doesn't just reveal Jesus it reveals you because when the book was written about him your name your life was written in the same book God's got you brother sister hear me we're done God's got you he's got you
