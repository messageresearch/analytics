[0:13] who wants the lamb he wants the Word
[0:16] made flesh but it's not his body that
[0:23] saves us today can I say the next it's
[0:29] not his mind that saves us today it's
[0:34] the life it's the life that was in the
[0:39] blood the chemistry of the blood is gone
[0:42] but the life of the blood is mine I said
[0:47] it's mine and now by the scripture I am
[0:52] the blood of Christ how by the spirit by
[1:00] the Spirit the life that was alive
[1:03] didn't follow me the life of God fell on
[1:07] me what does that make me if the life of
[1:10] God falls on me brother Bentham said it
[1:12] makes me eternal somebody said what nor
[1:17] do you mean I'm going to a land where
[1:20] the soul of man shall never die
