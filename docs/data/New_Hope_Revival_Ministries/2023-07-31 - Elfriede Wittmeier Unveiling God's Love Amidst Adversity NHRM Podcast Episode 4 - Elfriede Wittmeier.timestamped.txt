[1:45] into the story where were you you were
[1:46] born and where I was born in Poland
[1:48] Poland in went in 1942 I'm the set i'm I
[1:54] come from a big family my first
[1:57] um my older siblings the five were
[2:01] actually born in Ukraine or in a
[2:04] province of Ukraine at the time called
[2:07] walinia okay it it's not very far from
[2:11] Kiev and Rob no these places that are in
[2:15] the news
[2:16] oh or have been yes and so
[2:21] um
[2:21] I'm
[2:23] I'm just very thankful here to be here
[2:26] and to be able to share many of the the
[2:30] wonderful ex things that actually in
[2:34] order for us to realize the enormity of
[2:39] what God is doing today there are so
[2:43] many prayers that have gone forth in the
[2:47] regions in the world in the Nations and
[2:51] it's good to know you know that there
[2:54] are people who have prayed and have
[2:56] always looked for more sure you know
[2:59] before
[3:00] um it was a it was just right after
[3:02] covid started we were having a little
[3:06] prayer meeting
[3:07] with with sister Flo and Sharon we were
[3:12] at her house and we were praying and all
[3:15] of us and it was very powerful it was a
[3:17] there was such an anointing
[3:19] and Sharon began to see the light of the
[3:23] the light come in and I went off to the
[3:27] other direction because the Lord began
[3:29] to speak to me and he told me to pray
[3:33] for the Ukraine and Russia that was
[3:36] before anything had come in and I
[3:39] thought well and then he said you have
[3:42] an inheritance
[3:44] and because many seeds have been sown by
[3:48] your your ancestors
[3:51] and uh that I thought was very
[3:54] interesting and since then you know I
[3:56] have really prayed many many times
[3:58] because it's like my roots yeah you know
[4:02] for sure and so where you're from
[4:05] thankful you know that my God is God is
[4:09] just mindful of everything we do and
[4:13] everything we say and you know it's it's
[4:15] such a privilege you know to be a child
[4:17] of God in these days and really you're
[4:20] you're really a miracle sitting here
[4:22] because kovid got you I mean it hit you
[4:25] pretty good oh yes I almost died and
[4:27] you're I mean so really it's for you to
[4:29] be sitting here talking with us today is
[4:30] really a miracle in itself yes that was
[4:33] that was well the doctor at the hospital
[4:36] had actually told me three times he said
[4:38] if you don't check in at the hospital uh
[4:42] you have double pneumonia covet double
[4:45] pneumonia and uh he spoke of death he
[4:48] said you will not make it wow
[4:51] and so I went to the greeleys they were
[4:54] all sick as well and uh
[4:57] but it was amazing you know when he left
[5:00] he was angry that I didn't stay yeah and
[5:03] and he asked me again are you sure
[5:05] you're not you're you you don't want to
[5:09] stay and I said yes I am I and uh right
[5:13] afterwards the nurse told me you made
[5:16] the right decision wow she told me that
[5:19] you're sitting here with her she told me
[5:21] that three times because I told her I
[5:24] said I'm going to trust the Lord in this
[5:26] and uh you know it was a state of the
[5:29] greatest for about a week they were as
[5:31] sick as I mean it was it was it was
[5:34] terrible there was a real battle going
[5:36] on in there yeah but um seven days later
[5:40] I was driving my vehicle
[5:43] yeah it was so the Lord really undertook
[5:47] so how many siblings do you have I've
[5:49] got eight siblings there's nine yeah the
[5:52] number seven and
[5:55] um yeah so I'm number seven from the top
[5:57] up and number three from the bottom so
[6:00] big family it's a big family yes
[6:04] and they're all in all your siblings now
[6:07] besides all except they're all still
[6:10] alive except for my oldest brother he
[6:12] died last year and they're all they all
[6:13] still live in Canada right yes
[6:15] yes
[6:17] um so let's we're going to try and dive
[6:19] into it um I know you really
[6:21] want to talk about I mean really Your
[6:24] Life Starts before
[6:25] actually
[6:27] yes because so you want to talk about
[6:29] your mom I mean I kept she had such a
[6:32] big impact and your life and spiritually
[6:34] and stuff that we really need to get
[6:36] into that and talk about that as well
[6:39] you know uh you when you go back to well
[6:42] about a hundred years 110 years you know
[6:45] that
[6:46] um just to see things in the perspective
[6:49] I'll just touch a little bit on the the
[6:52] history let's just take a little walk
[6:55] together let's go and 100 years yes so
[6:59] when was your mom born in 1912
[7:03] and um
[7:05] just you know because this is in the
[7:08] news again she was born two months after
[7:11] the Titanic sank wow so that you know
[7:15] it's not just saying well it's this
[7:17] person first world war but that had just
[7:21] happened so and the Titanics and you
[7:24] know all that in the news again it's and
[7:27] all these different countries too like
[7:29] Russia
[7:31] uh now Poland and Ukraine and Germany
[7:35] all you know there has been so much
[7:38] turmoil throughout the years I mean this
[7:41] what is happening now is just another
[7:43] repeat another repeat so tell me a
[7:46] little bit about your mom and a little
[7:47] bit about her history and background
[7:50] okay
[7:51] um
[7:52] like I said she was born in 1912. my dad
[7:56] was born in 1906. they shared a birthday
[8:00] the 24th of June
[8:03] and Dad was born
[8:06] in at the time the Azusa Street Revival
[8:09] began and also like brother Branham had
[8:13] said you know that leodicia the church
[8:16] age started in 1906 so that's kind of a
[8:19] landmark we can go back on
[8:23] so um my mom
[8:27] she
[8:28] well the political situation was
[8:32] terrible I mean as you as you know like
[8:34] the devastation the destruction and and
[8:37] the nation was rising up against nation
[8:40] and Russia itself
[8:44] they they during that those 10 years
[8:48] they got rid of royalty of the tsar and
[8:51] his family that
[8:53] um he was incarcerated in 17 they
[8:58] shipped him to Siberia and then they the
[9:01] kid they assassinated the family and
[9:04] Lenin took over he was and that was
[9:09] actually the birth
[9:10] of Communism that took place all the
[9:14] upheaval so you can well imagine what it
[9:17] was like to live in that part of the
[9:19] country and your mom when she was a
[9:22] little girl didn't she have to weren't
[9:24] they supposed to be like shift off to
[9:26] Siberia or something yes yes but before
[9:30] that
[9:31] um
[9:32] she when she was nine months old
[9:35] her relatives many of them went moved to
[9:38] Canada her ad and I'll go and cousins
[9:40] simply because of they were targeting
[9:44] the German ethnics you know the
[9:47] colonization there that you know
[9:50] although they had lived there for years
[9:52] and years you know probably as far back
[9:55] as under Catherine the Great so that you
[9:58] know they had every right to be there
[10:00] but then when War arises and they think
[10:05] that that they thought perhaps Germany
[10:08] might move over to
[10:10] take over part of that Eastern section
[10:14] so you know that these things just build
[10:16] up for sure so that's the reason they
[10:19] thought well we're getting getting out
[10:21] of here we're not uh so but they lost
[10:25] contact with my mother's family all
[10:28] together because they all went to Canada
[10:30] they went to Canada and my great-grandpa
[10:34] and Grandpa they decided to stay because
[10:36] they had worked very hard and
[10:40] so they you know had started their
[10:41] family mom by that time by the time the
[10:44] war started
[10:46] she was two two and a half
[10:49] and her mother was expecting another
[10:51] baby but my grandpa had to go to war
[10:56] in at the start of the first World War
[11:00] so
[11:01] um because of all the upheaval and that
[11:05] the soldiers had come although they
[11:07] lived more in a remote area you know
[11:10] everything seemed peaceful yeah that but
[11:13] yeah that the soldiers came and
[11:18] they actually she was seven months
[11:21] pregnant my grandma just young she was
[11:23] 21 or 22.
[11:25] and she was a
[11:30] real educated uh person she had gone to
[11:34] school all the time she spoke quite a
[11:36] few languages and she did all the legal
[11:40] work you know for the people in the town
[11:42] and and you know she was she was whereas
[11:47] with my mother because of all the
[11:50] upheavals and that she didn't go to
[11:51] school at all or hardly she taught
[11:53] herself how to read and write and I'm
[11:56] telling you she was a whiz at math yeah
[11:59] we always laughed at her you know
[12:00] anytime we would try to buy some
[12:03] you know linoleum or whatever she had it
[12:06] figured out in her head in no time she
[12:09] was just
[12:11] and like I said she taught herself
[12:14] so
[12:15] she could read and write and your
[12:17] grandmother ended up getting killed in
[12:20] the World War II yes so then what
[12:23] happened right near I think it was
[12:25] almost probably in 1914 in the fall
[12:31] mother would have been about two and a
[12:33] half and she
[12:35] um
[12:36] she was the soldiers had come and they
[12:40] were going to deprive get take all the
[12:43] food from them and everything and so she
[12:46] begged them not pleased to leave them
[12:48] something for the winter
[12:50] and he got so angry and he kicked her in
[12:53] the belly and she tried to get away
[12:56] through the window and she died in in
[12:59] real Agony it was it was apparently was
[13:02] terrible
[13:03] so then mother had to uh because her dad
[13:09] was in the army
[13:10] and she went to live with the her
[13:14] grandparents
[13:16] so then it didn't take very long there
[13:18] because again because of all these
[13:20] upheavals I think perhaps mom might have
[13:23] been around for four years
[13:26] at the time you know when the Czar got
[13:28] killed or just before that so they the
[13:33] soldiers had come right the Baltimore
[13:34] weeks because communism was coming in
[13:37] right and um they came
[13:41] and just overnight they had to get up
[13:45] and leave they could just take with
[13:48] whatever they had they were put on the
[13:51] train
[13:51] and they traveled about 2 000 kilometers
[13:56] so around like I said 12 13. 100 miles
[14:01] miles somewhere yeah and they moved
[14:05] down to the near the um well the Volga
[14:09] River
[14:10] the Caspian Sea or the Black Sea it
[14:14] would be at the bottom of the Euro
[14:16] mountains
[14:17] and so that was it was a very Lush land
[14:21] it was very uh it was nice and they had
[14:26] to work in the Orchards
[14:28] so they worked during the the summer the
[14:32] winters were very severe and that and
[14:35] they had a lot of snow so most of that
[14:37] most of the time then her Grandpa would
[14:40] work in inside
[14:42] and um
[14:44] they said sometimes the snow would go
[14:46] right up to the rooftops wow yes it was
[14:49] it was awful and uh
[14:52] but Grandpa her Grandpa really took
[14:55] advantage of it and he taught her he
[14:59] read the Bible spent a lot of time
[15:01] reading and this is I think with the
[15:04] Lord manned even the the Heritage that I
[15:08] have from because he would teach her
[15:11] and um
[15:13] and one of the things he kept repeating
[15:16] to her was about Israel he so he saw
[15:20] from the scripture that Israel would
[15:23] again become a nation and that he said I
[15:27] know I will not see it but you most
[15:30] likely will and if you don't your
[15:34] children definitely will see the day
[15:36] that Israel will become a nation so that
[15:39] was more than 30 years before it
[15:40] happened now why do you think he was
[15:42] talking so much about Israel and
[15:44] Stockton he loved is I don't know but he
[15:47] he just had it in and he saw that from
[15:49] from the word now I don't know I don't
[15:53] know if we have any Jewish heritage
[15:56] heritage I I wouldn't be surprised okay
[15:59] I was just wondering because that's very
[16:01] interesting I wouldn't say a random
[16:03] thing but like that's something
[16:04] different for him to you know yes yes as
[16:07] a young girl yes and so
[16:11] um they got to go back home
[16:14] in uh right at the end of the war
[16:16] probably around maybe 1920 somewhere
[16:20] and they found you know that the home
[16:24] had been plundered and everything was
[16:27] was
[16:28] um
[16:29] it was vandalized and so they had to
[16:32] start from scratch so to speak it was
[16:36] and that happened actually several times
[16:39] in my mom's life really yes she where
[16:42] she had lost everything I think about
[16:44] either four or five times where they had
[16:46] to start right now
[16:48] so that was very difficult but somewhere
[16:51] in there they were able they rebuilt
[16:54] and they acquired some cattle but
[16:59] because of the
[17:02] uncertainty and the wild animals
[17:06] you know they so Mom and her cousin had
[17:10] to look after the cattle
[17:13] she said for during the day you know
[17:15] just at a young age she would have been
[17:18] is that eight nine ten you know that
[17:21] time and uh
[17:24] she said it's so scared me because there
[17:28] were a lot of wolves around
[17:30] and I learned to pray see Grandpa had
[17:34] taught her a lot yeah she was always
[17:36] very interested in in scripture and so
[17:41] that was she was always looking you know
[17:44] how her mom was right
[17:46] so
[17:48] um
[17:49] it was then
[17:52] that the Lord when she began to pray
[17:54] like that the Lord began to show her
[17:57] and things in the spirit
[18:00] she either would see Visions open
[18:03] Visions that's what she told me that she
[18:05] had seen just before she died
[18:08] I thought it was a one-time thing but
[18:11] that particular time when she had that
[18:14] visitation about two weeks before she
[18:16] died that I was telling you about
[18:20] um
[18:21] she she I had a conversation with her
[18:25] right after
[18:26] I talked to her for about two hours and
[18:29] she kept emphasizing that to me she said
[18:32] remember
[18:33] and then I I said Mom did you see it
[18:36] more often it sounds like that she said
[18:39] yes I kept seeing it either open Vision
[18:42] or I saw a
[18:44] thought in a dream at different times
[18:47] and she said it's very important which
[18:50] is always a Bible and it had a lock on
[18:53] it
[18:54] she thought it was it had a lock on it
[18:57] and she heard the Lord say in your day I
[19:02] am going to send I'm I'm going to open
[19:05] up that word and I'm going to
[19:09] reveal this many secrets you know the
[19:12] secrets of the scripture yeah and he
[19:15] said and I have seen that happen
[19:17] see so he pointed her and I feel that is
[19:21] so important for our day for sure
[19:23] because it's part of that prophesy again
[19:28] and the things we have seen through
[19:31] brother brownham's Ministry and God has
[19:34] done
[19:37] amen I mean if we could even comprehend
[19:41] ever you know what the Lord has really
[19:44] done through that Ministry it's it's
[19:47] just unfathomable for sure too so but he
[19:51] was already then at her young age
[19:54] pointing right direction yes and it's
[19:56] crazy how I mean like like at a young
[19:58] age your grandpa or her grandfather was
[20:00] teaching her about the Bible and stuff
[20:02] yes and then she learned to pray because
[20:04] she was watching cattle and livestocks
[20:07] exactly God really works in mysterious
[20:09] way sometimes yes he does that's awesome
[20:11] so again one thing that they did
[20:13] although they had I'll just share that
[20:16] because
[20:18] um the house they built or it was very
[20:21] small but Mom said at times because of
[20:26] all the upheaval and people you know
[20:29] would come and they would house them
[20:31] really yes they barely had enough of
[20:34] their own but she said they they were
[20:37] sleeping in the living room on the
[20:39] floors everywhere because they had no
[20:40] place to go just people from after the
[20:43] war yes and with what was happening in
[20:46] in Russia and later on when we emigrated
[20:49] to Canada
[20:50] and you know times were very hard at the
[20:54] beginning for all of us in Canada as
[20:56] well and then some people had contacted
[21:01] us from the British Columbia area and
[21:05] they had
[21:07] sent to us a boxes of fruit
[21:12] you know they by this time these people
[21:15] had
[21:16] had
[21:19] acquired an orchard I mean British
[21:23] Columbia is beautiful and it's a fruit
[21:25] area and that and so we started to get
[21:29] all kinds of things like apples and
[21:31] peaches and cherries and and you know
[21:34] and we come to find out that these
[21:37] people have had
[21:41] been one had been a family that they had
[21:44] housed there in Russia really and yeah
[21:47] and they said that
[21:49] um
[21:50] that her those grandparents and them had
[21:54] done so much for them wow and they had
[21:57] just heard that we had emigrated and
[22:00] they just wanted to reimburse wow
[22:05] jumping ahead but I just want to ask you
[22:08] this one thing what year did Joe go to
[22:10] Canada and well we came in
[22:13] um my older sister came in 19. that's
[22:17] right because y'all came in different
[22:18] times different times always a half a
[22:19] year apart wow yeah Bernie's mama she
[22:23] came first and art half a year later and
[22:27] Lydia came half a year later and then
[22:28] the rest of the film okay okay so we can
[22:31] jump in the head a little bit we came in
[22:33] June of we
[22:36] uh it would have been yeah we got on the
[22:38] ship on the mom's birthday I remember
[22:40] that 24th of June 53.
[22:44] when did your mom and dad meet what year
[22:47] did they meet get married they got
[22:48] married in 1929 1929 yes yeah Mom was
[22:52] still very young I think she wasn't
[22:54] quite 17. wow yes and so they they lived
[22:59] in
[23:01] in that part of the Ukraine and that's
[23:03] where my older siblings were born and
[23:07] then all all like in the 30s that's when
[23:12] all the things happened with Hitler he
[23:16] came into power in 33 now Stalin
[23:22] he was he he came into power in 24. so
[23:26] all of that was going on in Russia and
[23:30] under that rulership uh it was just his
[23:34] work Terror maybe even more as bad as
[23:37] the Holocaust and I mean if you know any
[23:39] history at all it was yeah it was
[23:41] terrible but so then Hitler came into
[23:44] power in 33
[23:47] and while Germany was far off you know
[23:49] they were pretty safe yeah so they
[23:52] thought they thought and then yes um so
[23:54] you were born and you were born in okay
[23:57] so then as time progressed
[24:00] um
[24:03] Hitler had
[24:06] invaded Poland
[24:08] in 1939 okay okay and then when he did
[24:14] that
[24:15] my my
[24:17] he replaced he took a lot of these
[24:20] German people and moved them into Poland
[24:25] so these they were basically they were
[24:27] forced to do that they had no option
[24:30] to you know whether they wanted to go
[24:33] they had to leave their Homeland
[24:36] I mean it was home to them and
[24:40] they lost everything
[24:41] then
[24:43] I mean they had to leave everything
[24:44] behind and by the time they my dad had
[24:47] come with a wagon and with the few
[24:52] belongings they were able to take and
[24:55] Mom and the kids had gone by train
[24:58] and they were they were waiting for him
[25:02] to come and you know at the border they
[25:05] stole it people stole everything you
[25:08] know they lost yeah so they had to start
[25:11] all over again poverty in but they were
[25:16] put into oh they had no choice
[25:19] they had to they were placed into a
[25:22] different home and the Polish people
[25:27] they some had to go went to again
[25:31] Siberia
[25:33] or or to Germany yeah to Germany they
[25:38] you know and that there's a lot of
[25:41] animosity even though they had to leave
[25:44] everything behind but then when you have
[25:46] to take over somebody else's home so you
[25:49] don't have a choice yeah and you know
[25:51] with that so now
[25:54] um I mean y'all stayed in y'all's home
[25:56] and right until the tanks were pretty
[25:58] close didn't you uh well yes so now in
[26:03] 1939
[26:06] we had to move to Poland
[26:10] and the place
[26:12] or the province or whatever it was in
[26:15] the vatago it was assigned you know
[26:17] Hitler would have taken that
[26:19] so that's where the four of us the
[26:22] youngest were born what okay so so they
[26:25] had already moved once and now you're in
[26:27] Poland yes okay that is like the oldest
[26:30] siblings were born in the Ukraine
[26:35] my my older brother he said just a year
[26:39] older and I he was born in 41. I was
[26:42] born 42 Bob in 43 and Adolf and 44. okay
[26:46] so we were all about 15 months apart so
[26:52] we were all just babies no now when did
[26:55] your dad have to leave okay that was in
[26:58] dad he was able to stay
[27:02] there you know most of the time of the
[27:05] war at the end of 44 the war ended in
[27:09] May 45 so that was only about six months
[27:12] half a year before he was conscripted
[27:15] into the army he had to go
[27:18] but up to that point he was taking care
[27:21] of all the business you know because
[27:24] most of the men had been drafted yeah
[27:27] and so he was always busy he worked he
[27:31] was a member of the fire department and
[27:34] anytime anything needed fixing or you
[27:37] know he was responsible he was one of
[27:39] the two there were two men dad was one
[27:42] of them so that's why he even got to
[27:44] stay
[27:45] at home until 40 you know the end of 44
[27:50] probably I think the very beginning of
[27:54] um
[27:55] November 44. my youngest brother was
[27:59] born in August so he was just a little
[28:01] over two months old and like I mean and
[28:04] y'all stayed I mean now he had when he
[28:06] was leaving he had packed a wagon for
[28:08] y'all just in case y'all had to get it
[28:09] he did there was a barn and so he had
[28:12] because it was
[28:14] considered treason if you even thought
[28:17] that the Germans were forced to retreat
[28:20] yeah you know they were winning the war
[28:23] right up everybody tell me that Lydia
[28:26] says I was we we were running for our
[28:29] lives but we were winning the war
[28:32] you know so
[28:34] so and there were a lot of treaties and
[28:37] and things going on behind the scenes
[28:40] between Russia and Poland and and
[28:42] everything so it was most dangerous for
[28:45] Germans to be living in that part so
[28:47] then I mean I mean y'all like I said
[28:49] y'all left it like the last minute
[28:51] really well um yes it was on the 17th of
[28:54] January
[28:56] that early in the morning
[28:58] someone this man opened up the door and
[29:03] just hollered and said Mrs Whitmire the
[29:07] enemy is upon us
[29:08] their their close I think it was only
[29:12] about 12 kilometers away from the
[29:14] Russians were coming
[29:16] and we have to you have to get out
[29:20] so that was very
[29:22] very dangerous you can imagine so you
[29:26] have nine kids to get ready
[29:30] but we didn't have
[29:33] many belongings because you had to wear
[29:37] whatever you owned yeah you I mean
[29:41] there was little to be had right so you
[29:43] didn't really have adequate and your dad
[29:46] had already packed up the wagon for
[29:47] y'all yeah well what he had done he did
[29:50] what he could yeah like
[29:53] um he put all the feed for the horses
[29:56] on there and you know with the flower
[29:59] they had it had
[30:02] that in the house yeah you know until
[30:04] you know ready to go so that whoever you
[30:08] know they helped with that and by the
[30:10] time you really get going it took longer
[30:13] than but we were always ahead of the the
[30:18] Army as a that was like the Russians so
[30:21] then y'all y'all went
[30:23] when y'all left the house by wagon did
[30:26] y'all have an idea where y'all were
[30:27] going or y'all just just went you were
[30:30] just going you were trying to head out
[30:32] to West Germany Germany I mean because
[30:36] we were German citizens yeah but
[30:39] it's
[30:42] you just
[30:44] ran yeah and yeah that's crazy yes um
[30:48] now when y'all were all I do want to
[30:51] talk about this uh which sister was it
[30:54] that got
[30:55] lost yes it was Judith's Mom okay that's
[30:59] I don't know this oh it's this one yeah
[31:02] I have yeah yeah
[31:03] um I'm gonna I have pictures of these
[31:05] and Hawk is gonna insert them in the uh
[31:08] yes uh clip or video later on yes um but
[31:12] tell me that story because that's a
[31:14] pretty I mean that's pretty crazy story
[31:15] because I mean y'all are just on this
[31:16] road it was only about we had been on
[31:19] the road for only about two or three
[31:21] days so it wasn't even really hadn't
[31:24] really been that long no no but you also
[31:27] have to realize
[31:28] that Poland you know in January it was
[31:33] always referred to as the hymite it
[31:35] means that cold Homeland
[31:38] really you know you always they always
[31:40] referred and didn't until they switch
[31:42] off on the wagon to who was walking to
[31:44] keep warm or something like that well
[31:46] just to get some exercise too and and so
[31:49] my older sister had just gotten back and
[31:52] I mean it was very exhausting as you can
[31:54] well imagine and so she she was telling
[31:58] me yeah she said I got off the wagon and
[32:00] you know I was just Meandering along and
[32:02] looking to see
[32:06] um you know she was curious at this and
[32:09] that and not realizing the severity
[32:13] of
[32:15] not paying attention now how old would
[32:17] she have been she was eight she turned
[32:19] eight on the first of January and this
[32:22] happened on the 20th well just a baby
[32:25] you know that was
[32:28] you know little you picture that you
[32:30] know nature and in the cold cold weather
[32:33] but anyway then she started running and
[32:36] trying to find uh the wagon you're
[32:40] trying to find the family she got really
[32:41] scared and then she came to y in the
[32:45] road
[32:46] and uh thinking they must have gone
[32:50] straight ahead and she said mom had
[32:52] really drilled that into them that
[32:55] whatever you do you keep running you
[32:57] keep going yeah you know don't stay
[32:59] behind because the enemy is right behind
[33:01] us
[33:02] so
[33:04] um
[33:04] she went straight and mother had veered
[33:08] off to the left where most of the
[33:11] traffic had gone the track had had gone
[33:14] you know what one wagon behind the other
[33:17] and uh yeah and that's
[33:20] that's when your dad years later here
[33:23] she was going through some some things
[33:26] in that and but your dad saw that the
[33:30] vision about her coming to that why and
[33:33] she had had taken the wrong road so she
[33:37] went she went down that Y and she ended
[33:39] up stumbling up on another wagon she
[33:41] came she kept going straight and she
[33:44] said there were only two wagons
[33:48] you know she was running and running
[33:50] hoping to catch up to the family
[33:52] and one thing she did is she stuck to
[33:55] the
[33:56] she held on to that wagon one of them
[34:01] and all night she ran all night long did
[34:04] she well held on and I don't know how
[34:08] she did that
[34:09] I mean an eight-year-old little and uh
[34:13] what happened
[34:15] is she's she said I knew if I let go I
[34:19] would either be trampled to death by the
[34:22] horses or you know wound up wind up
[34:25] under the wagon or land in the ditch
[34:29] either way would have meant death
[34:30] because because she would have frozen to
[34:33] death it wasn't a heavily traffic area
[34:36] it was yeah so she held on and somewhat
[34:41] towards morning they discovered that
[34:44] there was a child here at the back
[34:46] holding on to the wagon they held her up
[34:50] I and they put her on a pillow
[34:53] I probably gave her something to eat I
[34:56] don't know but they were very kind
[34:58] and they put her on
[35:01] to the on the pillow and she fell asleep
[35:04] sound asleep
[35:06] and when she woke up that pillow was
[35:10] soaked in blood like it was all bloody
[35:12] they anyway they took her
[35:15] to a school
[35:17] in the next town you know the school and
[35:21] that's where they left her because
[35:24] that's where people would have picked
[35:26] them up that couple came and picked them
[35:28] up you said the pill was Bloody that's
[35:29] because she was causing blood from her
[35:32] lungs like her lungs and yeah over
[35:34] exertion it was it was yeah just as a
[35:38] and so they took her to a school where
[35:40] this school yes and then that's where
[35:42] that couple came and they took her in
[35:46] cheese spent at least over a year with
[35:50] them and but they did not register her
[35:53] because you see Mom tried everything to
[35:58] locate her even after the war through
[36:01] the Red Cross anybody who would have
[36:03] known any whereabouts you know they but
[36:07] because they didn't register her
[36:10] they
[36:12] they
[36:14] couldn't find her no and uh
[36:17] so when that happened
[36:19] then that man
[36:22] the he had butchered his own sheep you
[36:27] know it was but they weren't allowed to
[36:29] he and then he tried to make it look
[36:32] like it had been stolen
[36:35] and and uh yeah so that's when they they
[36:40] got him they knew it wasn't so so they
[36:42] broke the law he went to jail he went to
[36:45] jail for that yes and then so she went
[36:47] to another family that's it yes and so
[36:51] they registered her yes gotcha so she
[36:54] was with them for over a year they put
[36:56] her in school
[36:58] and uh
[37:00] so this one day and mom always she she
[37:04] told you know her brother
[37:06] her happy she her half-brother you know
[37:10] he was he he was living in in Germany
[37:13] there where we were by that time already
[37:17] and uh she asked him she said would you
[37:20] go and get her if we ever find her and
[37:24] he always tried to distract her
[37:26] and she says no we're going to find her
[37:28] you know the and uh and he said if we do
[37:33] then then I yes I would do it I'll I'll
[37:38] go wherever she is and fortunately she
[37:43] had crossed that one Bridge because it
[37:46] was a city of guben and and that was
[37:50] occupied I think partially by
[37:53] the the allies and also the Russians if
[37:57] she had stayed if she had not gone
[37:59] across it would have been very difficult
[38:01] to to get her out but this was there was
[38:05] no problem then so how long she was gone
[38:09] two and a half years years she came back
[38:12] we lost her in January and she came back
[38:15] sometime in June yep 47. wow yeah do you
[38:21] remember when she came home like I I yes
[38:24] I do I I just remember her standing by
[38:28] the door and mom was explaining to us
[38:31] that this stranger here was uh also from
[38:36] now on she was also our sister
[38:39] I remember her standing and I thought
[38:41] who is you know I mean I didn't remember
[38:44] yeah no oh so
[38:49] so she was about 10 and a half when
[38:52] y'all forgot her back that's that's
[38:54] unbelievable yeah but it's really a
[38:56] miracle it really survived yeah and
[38:59] really I mean it's America I mean think
[39:01] about like all the little certain like
[39:02] the first family didn't register her but
[39:04] then he ended up doing something wrong
[39:06] and ends up going to jail exactly the
[39:08] next family register her I mean that's
[39:10] that's crazy all in itself
[39:12] so we did get her back um now what were
[39:16] the roads I know you have a pretty
[39:18] interesting story about some of the
[39:19] roads that y'all had to travel on
[39:21] to where y'all were go west to West
[39:24] Germany I mean some of them were super
[39:25] Nero on a cliff and stuff oh even when
[39:28] while we were fleeing you see there was
[39:30] that whole time from January until May
[39:35] we were
[39:36] we were overrun in May
[39:41] by you know the the that's when the
[39:44] Russians came out you see and um that's
[39:48] when that incident happened with the pig
[39:51] Barn
[39:52] oh yeah tell me that one that one first
[39:54] yeah tell me that one first okay it
[39:57] um
[39:59] it was it was when when we came there
[40:04] then Mom was so happy that we would
[40:08] finally have a roof over our head you
[40:11] know I mean this was why y'all were
[40:13] still fleeing to get out yes it was
[40:14] right at the end of the war I mean it
[40:17] was early May so the war ended on the
[40:19] 7th and so
[40:22] um
[40:23] we we were she was so happy that
[40:28] so we slept we were supposed to sleep in
[40:31] that pig Barn it had been cleaned up you
[40:35] know it was had been empty for quite a
[40:37] while
[40:37] and my older brothers were staying in
[40:42] the on the wagon
[40:44] art and Irvin they were looking after
[40:47] the belongings mom and the baby by that
[40:51] time he was about
[40:53] well about eight nine months
[40:56] and they slept right by the entrance of
[41:00] the door
[41:03] of that barn and then the way they had
[41:05] you know there was a long hallway and
[41:09] the rest of us were
[41:11] where we had to keep our clothes on you
[41:13] know she was ready to run at any time
[41:16] but um
[41:20] so it was in the middle of the night
[41:23] and mind you the horses that there was a
[41:27] barn there were a lot of there there
[41:29] were in the it was a
[41:31] how like a lot of barns that belonged to
[41:34] that uh
[41:36] house
[41:37] and so they were able to keep the horses
[41:40] in in a barn okay you know so otherwise
[41:45] we would have lost the horses right
[41:46] there
[41:47] and uh so the boys were sleeping on that
[41:50] wagon
[41:51] and Mom all of a sudden in the middle of
[41:56] the night she heard the voice saying
[42:00] uh take the baby and get out
[42:04] and she sat up and she was so exhausted
[42:07] and thought this can't be
[42:10] happening you know what what he didn't
[42:13] she just laid back and fell asleep again
[42:16] and uh this time every time she told it
[42:20] she says whenever I tell that I feel
[42:22] those hands those hands grabbed her
[42:25] under her arm and stood her up
[42:28] he said take the baby and get out wow
[42:31] so she took him and went over to the
[42:35] wagon and
[42:38] he and you know she said I've got to go
[42:42] and wake up the rest of the children now
[42:44] you have to realize everything was dark
[42:47] pitch black it was around one o'clock
[42:49] one two and then when she came back
[42:53] to wake the Wake the rest of us up the
[42:57] tanks have moved in and that Barn had
[43:00] taken a hit wow and it was exactly all
[43:03] of y'all still in it yes
[43:05] but Mom where Mom was with the baby that
[43:09] was where it hit wow it was a direct hit
[43:13] yeah so that was very very so anyway and
[43:19] you know the buildings in in Europe yet
[43:21] they have you know all the brick
[43:25] so that all came down and on the Rafters
[43:28] and and uh right behind while we were
[43:33] right behind that
[43:35] but with whatever happened to Mom from
[43:38] the pressure and and that she was
[43:41] knocked unconscious wow and so it took a
[43:44] little while for her to come too and
[43:45] then she heard a scream and uh she made
[43:49] her way on her hands and knees and and
[43:52] all that rubble and that she pulled out
[43:55] one child after the other but still you
[43:58] know everything was still dark
[44:00] and so they started counting you know we
[44:03] were a short one we don't know who's
[44:06] who's missing and and it was me I was
[44:10] missing so she had to go in again but uh
[44:13] by that time I was already unconscious
[44:16] and that and she kept slapping me and
[44:19] hitting and
[44:21] and Lydia said what's the matter with
[44:24] Mom
[44:26] I thought she was just beating you
[44:30] so so anyway and it was somewhere in
[44:34] there then you know she kept pounding me
[44:36] and that and I yeah I came too I
[44:39] screamed but so I mean that story right
[44:42] there in itself blows my mind every time
[44:44] just to think about what would happen if
[44:47] she would just stayed there I mean yes
[44:49] yeah well none of us would have survived
[44:52] because yeah and and the thing the
[44:57] you know the Divine protection that was
[45:00] there we were right in the middle of the
[45:02] crossfire yeah and the house they had
[45:05] some officers there and that house took
[45:09] a hit see these people were all
[45:11] protected right
[45:13] and uh the officers but they were the
[45:17] ones that got killed they lost their
[45:19] limbs they were torn apart and
[45:21] everything and we were right in the
[45:23] middle of it my brother had a has a scar
[45:26] on his cheek and it and Adina has she
[45:31] had just a little bit on her on her neck
[45:34] really but in all of that none of us
[45:37] were now what happened afterwards y'all
[45:40] got all got out of the barn did y'all
[45:41] just get in the wagon and take off again
[45:43] or no then there was a field Barn there
[45:46] and everything and it was actually
[45:50] um it was then one of the Russian
[45:52] soldiers in all of this I mean all this
[45:55] screaming that was going on in that but
[45:58] the Russian soldier was going to come
[46:00] and he was going to rape mom wow and um
[46:04] and she and all of us kids gathered
[46:08] around her and that and we were and she
[46:11] told him if you touch me these if you do
[46:14] anything to me these kids you're going
[46:16] to be hearing uh their cries in your
[46:19] ears the rest of your life you know he
[46:22] told him and he took off
[46:24] and uh and so we went to the field barn
[46:29] but it didn't take very long and he came
[46:32] back and he had a feather tick
[46:36] and he said now take that and cover all
[46:39] of your kids
[46:40] so we were he just turned right around
[46:43] and and
[46:45] um
[46:46] you know the the Lord just really took
[46:49] care wow of that and then yeah after
[46:52] that well the Russians had come in yeah
[46:55] and uh
[46:57] no no so we lived we lived uh there for
[47:02] almost a year in
[47:04] in uh
[47:06] that that area and that's the Eastern
[47:10] Bloc that was you know captured by the
[47:12] Russians it was Russian territory so as
[47:15] soon as the Border opened up to the West
[47:19] that Mom took the opportunity
[47:22] immediately as soon as we were able to
[47:25] get to West Germany
[47:27] then we left everything behind again and
[47:31] started out yes and over there uh that's
[47:36] when you had asked me if I you know the
[47:40] means of transportation
[47:42] it was um
[47:45] um I do remember being in the cattle
[47:48] cars
[47:50] like the
[47:52] the kind you always see the Jewish
[47:54] people were transported I remember
[47:59] that I thought I'm going to suffocate
[48:02] here
[48:03] because first of all it was hot but the
[48:06] you know I mean I was just what four
[48:09] when we got to the West
[48:11] and uh you're little and you have to
[48:14] stand up it was overcrowded and I could
[48:18] hardly breathe now before we get to uh
[48:22] talking about where when y'all got to
[48:24] West Germany and stuff yes tell me about
[48:26] the story about the two soul I think
[48:28] there are two soldiers that came and
[48:29] helped y'all with the wagon I think no
[48:31] there were more more than two there were
[48:33] yes because the area that see was all at
[48:37] times mountainous region when y'all were
[48:40] traveling yes when we were fleeing you
[48:42] have to realize we were on the go for
[48:44] almost
[48:46] four five months four months
[48:50] and um yeah it was probably
[48:55] um
[48:55] night or dark and or desk or whatever
[49:00] but the roads were so stretch
[49:03] treacherous it was
[49:06] it was you know coming around the corner
[49:09] there was the mountain and then there
[49:12] was the just dropped off dropped off yes
[49:15] and the road was very narrow and so the
[49:18] wagon had to make its way around and no
[49:21] matter how careful you were
[49:23] but just in front of us mom was telling
[49:27] us you could hear that wagon didn't make
[49:30] it
[49:31] and uh and they went down the horses and
[49:34] the screams and and you know it was it
[49:37] was it was terrible it really and so no
[49:41] matter how hard she tried the the horses
[49:44] couldn't get a grip
[49:46] and we were going slowly but the the
[49:48] wheel got caught right on the edge and
[49:52] all the kids were on there you know and
[49:54] she was she was trying to get you know
[49:57] she took a blanket to see if the the
[50:00] horses would get some traction to be
[50:03] able to get out and there was just no
[50:05] way and she was just praying and then
[50:08] all of a sudden these men appeared
[50:11] uh coming around the corner and in no
[50:14] time flat they they helped her out and
[50:17] she was she said I I was just turned and
[50:21] for a moment and she was going to thank
[50:24] them and they were gone wow they weren't
[50:27] yeah they were nowhere to be seen
[50:30] yeah that's crazy so I mean so that yeah
[50:34] it's amazing it really is yeah but it's
[50:37] it's one one thing after the other the
[50:40] mercies and and the protection of the
[50:43] Lord was unbelievable I mean believable
[50:46] yes you know but so so it's like it was
[50:50] a crazy Journey just to get to West
[50:52] Germany well yes
[50:54] well by the time we got to Germany West
[50:57] Germany in 46.
[51:00] so it would have been
[51:04] um
[51:06] you know we were in a in a you know you
[51:09] had to go to all that transition and
[51:12] they designated the the
[51:15] um
[51:17] town or wherever we had to we were able
[51:20] to go okay but and and you said like now
[51:25] look back and stuff y'all were actually
[51:27] pretty close to some of the
[51:28] concentration camps oh there were I mean
[51:30] Poland was was dotted with with him all
[51:33] over yeah we've learned I mean you know
[51:36] when you think about it even Auschwitz
[51:38] was not very far yeah you know it it was
[51:41] but it wasn't or the ghetto the the
[51:46] uh Warsaw Ghetto and then but quite
[51:50] often you know the the Jewish people
[51:52] would come you know when we were still
[51:54] living there and uh
[51:57] uh many times the Jews would come to the
[52:01] door
[52:02] and uh mom would
[52:05] you know because it was so dangerous to
[52:08] even help them at any time and uh and uh
[52:12] she would always make sure that some of
[52:16] the help police so would be gone she
[52:20] would send the girls away and that and
[52:23] she would when she would just gather up
[52:25] whatever
[52:27] she could and she would go and then give
[52:30] it to her well yes behind like
[52:34] the back way and she would make sure she
[52:37] you know she would give them whatever
[52:39] because everything we had was also
[52:41] rationed yeah you know you had to report
[52:44] any anything you know the amount of
[52:47] butter that or or eggs or whatever you
[52:50] would have or you know you had to give
[52:53] that up yeah you just had enough for
[52:56] your own kids and that's it oh
[53:01] now hard times in West Germany after the
[53:04] war ended
[53:06] what made y'all want to start
[53:08] transitioning to Canada just to get out
[53:10] of there just
[53:11] because that's where y'all's family was
[53:13] well tell me about the address because
[53:15] that's okay see then yeah I mean you
[53:19] have to think
[53:20] Germany was destroyed so many of the
[53:25] bridges were gone they were blown up
[53:28] and all the rubble I mean you you
[53:31] wouldn't believe yeah the devastation
[53:34] that was and
[53:36] so
[53:38] um
[53:40] we had
[53:42] well there was no support
[53:45] anything Mama worked
[53:48] you know we were we were
[53:51] living by that time we were living in
[53:53] that little on the second story of that
[53:57] old house it was 200 years old
[54:00] and the quarters were actually meant for
[54:04] the uh old people for their the parents
[54:08] as a retirement
[54:10] so it was square footage was about 600
[54:14] square feet
[54:16] that we had we had no light in that last
[54:20] little room
[54:22] where we slept the little ones then in
[54:27] the middle room there was only one
[54:30] hanging light bulb
[54:32] and I can't remember if we had a light
[54:35] in the other bedroom so there were three
[54:39] rooms 600 square feet no running water
[54:42] no facilities and 10 people living in
[54:45] there yes
[54:47] and we had to yeah but we all had to
[54:50] work I'm telling you we had to go and
[54:52] get the water any anything we needed
[54:56] we had to go right around the house
[54:59] at least a half a block to go and get a
[55:02] pail of water there was
[55:05] a a minister that came to y'all's house
[55:07] yes every once in a while right yes I'm
[55:10] going to tell you about that because
[55:11] right away yeah because that's yes let
[55:14] me just share a little bit just what our
[55:16] living conditions were like there
[55:19] in addition to our
[55:23] not you know just having that little
[55:25] bulb
[55:27] and uh
[55:29] they would turn off the electricity
[55:33] so usually around supper time
[55:36] we and the only heated room we had was
[55:40] that middle room you know that served as
[55:42] a as a kitchen as a living area and one
[55:48] of us kids always wound up sleeping
[55:51] there as well right
[55:53] so but we had that stove and we again we
[56:00] had to go into the woods to try to
[56:02] gather wood
[56:05] so that we would be able to heat the
[56:07] place and that was our only warm place
[56:10] as you can imagine yeah so but
[56:15] so in the winter time you know around
[56:17] suppertime when they would turn off the
[56:21] electricity
[56:22] and that well mom she was she
[56:26] made sure that we would learn a lot of
[56:31] things she set us around there we and we
[56:33] would sing We had to sing or she would
[56:37] tell us stories or you know the
[56:39] scripture she taught us a lot of things
[56:42] we she just used that time
[56:45] at two two
[56:49] you know teach us so
[56:51] anyway she
[56:54] uh we learned a lot of songs that way
[56:57] and if there were 10 verses we had to
[56:59] sing them all
[57:03] white great but you know because of it
[57:07] all we were a very close family
[57:10] I mean you know and even now sometimes
[57:13] when I gone home and I look at them all
[57:15] and I think you know now they're all old
[57:17] and you know and I thought but these are
[57:20] the people that we went through all
[57:22] those Hard Times yeah
[57:24] you know it it I love them dearly and
[57:28] you're getting to go back and see them
[57:29] yes
[57:31] oh yeah so yeah tell me about the
[57:33] preachers because I mean that's really
[57:34] how y'all were introduced to brother
[57:36] Brandon yes okay uh he he was like an
[57:40] itinerant preacher he would come
[57:43] he you know we got to know some of the
[57:46] different people even in in the town we
[57:49] lived in and also three kilometers away
[57:52] there was a the town of Lindell and you
[57:56] know we got to know what Mom was always
[57:59] a people person but they were Believers
[58:03] and they really believed in praying
[58:05] through and experiencing the Lord and so
[58:08] that man was related to one of those
[58:10] families
[58:11] okay but we had
[58:14] we had
[58:16] mm-hmm
[58:18] talking a lot
[58:21] um
[58:22] so he would come and he would preach and
[58:26] sometimes in that little you know in
[58:29] those little rooms I don't know how we
[58:31] fit all these people and but you know
[58:34] where there is a will there's a way and
[58:36] uh I remember falling asleep so often
[58:39] they had the benches along the the wall
[58:43] there and we'd be sleeping underneath
[58:46] there but
[58:48] I can I can still remember his preaching
[58:52] really I was seven eight somewhere
[58:55] around that yes I really it interested
[58:58] me how would he come around to y'all oh
[59:00] sometimes every three four months or so
[59:02] not very often no but but they would
[59:05] also get together you know with the
[59:07] people and prayed so it they weren't
[59:09] fully dependent on him but it was very
[59:12] but he saw
[59:14] he saw visions
[59:16] and dreams he was a very spiritual man
[59:20] and at the time when we emigrated to
[59:23] Canada
[59:24] he told he told my mom whatever you do
[59:30] when you get to Canada make sure that
[59:35] you get in touch with the ministry of
[59:38] William Branham he said he's a great man
[59:41] of God on the rise right now and that
[59:43] would have been in the 40s I think the
[59:45] late 40s already
[59:46] yeah so so we got to hear
[59:51] you know I remember even about
[59:53] the you know the magazine the midnights
[59:56] cry
[59:57] the uh
[1:00:00] they uh translated that and
[1:00:04] things were written about brother Brown
[1:00:05] I'm there
[1:00:07] already
[1:00:08] so we got to hear
[1:00:10] and then later on I'll just fast forward
[1:00:13] a little bit to with what happened
[1:00:16] is um all these
[1:00:19] the years had gone my mom had searched
[1:00:22] and she because we we were in Baptist
[1:00:27] circles and they didn't know they didn't
[1:00:30] hear we didn't hear of him at all and
[1:00:33] she didn't know where to find him and
[1:00:37] until one day
[1:00:39] we had a young you know the young people
[1:00:42] always came to our place
[1:00:44] this is Canada this is Canada already
[1:00:48] and this one young man he uh he said oh
[1:00:52] I'm just gonna stay for dinner and then
[1:00:54] because I want to go over and go over to
[1:00:57] the the exhibition because there's a
[1:00:59] preacher there and I want really want to
[1:01:01] hear him
[1:01:02] so Mom asked him you know who it was
[1:01:05] what was his name she was interested and
[1:01:08] she said he told her that was it was
[1:01:12] William Branham wow
[1:01:15] so that that and and it was within
[1:01:19] walking distance yeah I think it was
[1:01:21] only about from where we lived it was
[1:01:25] just
[1:01:26] to three miles well yeah now did she end
[1:01:30] up going she went to one meeting and but
[1:01:34] she didn't understand very much that's
[1:01:36] right you told me because you know we
[1:01:38] had gone to a German Church she didn't
[1:01:47] yes and um
[1:01:49] she would always ask her what did she
[1:01:51] say what did he say yeah you know she
[1:01:54] understood a few words but yeah she
[1:01:56] wants now so that lady actually my her
[1:02:01] granddaughter
[1:02:03] is now married to my nephew really yes I
[1:02:08] did not know that yes yeah yeah they did
[1:02:12] not know that they live
[1:02:13] so oh now I feel like it's important to
[1:02:17] tell everybody how y'all came to Canada
[1:02:20] because y'all had no y'all y'all had no
[1:02:23] idea where to go no idea who to contact
[1:02:25] no no and the lord gave your mom's an
[1:02:28] address yes what happened and that was
[1:02:32] would have been fairly early because we
[1:02:34] came to West Germany in 46.
[1:02:37] and um
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:41] she had really experienced the Lord and
[1:02:45] I'll tell you about that right away but
[1:02:48] um she kept praying
[1:02:50] and uh she said Lord we have to have
[1:02:53] some help
[1:02:54] here you know we all she worked she
[1:02:57] worked for the farmers down you know as
[1:03:00] much as she could and and everything
[1:03:02] but um
[1:03:04] and uh he and she saw this address
[1:03:10] now you have to think that was
[1:03:14] they had emigrated
[1:03:16] well
[1:03:17] let me let me just tell you when she she
[1:03:20] wrote it down
[1:03:22] and wrote to these people I had no idea
[1:03:24] who it was
[1:03:26] so several weeks later
[1:03:29] we she gets a letter
[1:03:31] and it turned out to be a letter from
[1:03:34] her cousin and her aunt and uncle who
[1:03:36] had moved in 1913 and this would have
[1:03:42] been in the 40s now how did she get that
[1:03:44] address though the Lord showed it to her
[1:03:46] in a dream or a dream or Vision yes it
[1:03:50] was very it was plain she wrote it down
[1:03:53] immediately and yeah and it was that
[1:03:57] that specific I mean she would have
[1:04:00] known that she has relatives in Canada
[1:04:02] okay well she would have had no idea
[1:04:04] where they were yeah no but never mind
[1:04:10] um Edmonton Alberta
[1:04:13] and then 11818 67th Street I mean you
[1:04:18] know it was it was just and so it ended
[1:04:20] up being y'all's family and they kind of
[1:04:22] sponsored y'all yes
[1:04:25] they sent us a lot of care packages and
[1:04:30] um
[1:04:30] everything it was and coffee was one of
[1:04:34] the the Staples they said yes and you
[1:04:37] would think why would they send coffee
[1:04:39] you know but Mom said it was the best
[1:04:42] thing because you know all the bartering
[1:04:44] going on and the neighbor the next door
[1:04:47] neighbor was a baker
[1:04:49] and he first of all he loved coffee for
[1:04:52] himself but also he um he was very
[1:04:58] um
[1:05:00] why he sold it on the black market
[1:05:03] so he made money but in turn you know he
[1:05:07] had wheat and he he you know we got
[1:05:11] several loaves of bread for each pound
[1:05:14] of coffee
[1:05:15] so
[1:05:17] and uh so they were they were the ones
[1:05:19] that ended up helping y'all get to
[1:05:20] Canada yes they went to a Baptist Church
[1:05:23] it was a big Baptist church and they
[1:05:28] they
[1:05:29] sponsored a lot of German people
[1:05:32] he the the pastor he was he spoke German
[1:05:35] and English and he was very instrumental
[1:05:38] in helping many of the German people to
[1:05:42] come
[1:05:43] because even in the early 50s
[1:05:46] just in the Edmonton area they had
[1:05:49] approximately somewhere at least 60 000
[1:05:52] German people
[1:05:53] it was like the the south side part was
[1:05:57] was now what made that such a popular
[1:06:01] place for everyone to well everywhere I
[1:06:04] mean Europe was overrun with refugees
[1:06:08] so they had to go somewhere
[1:06:10] and
[1:06:13] you know the The Americans
[1:06:16] and and Canadians I mean they did on
[1:06:20] they helped Europe unbelievably I mean I
[1:06:24] don't know if you're you're familiar at
[1:06:26] all with the Marshall Plan and and in
[1:06:29] every they helped
[1:06:31] oh Lord and I think even well every
[1:06:35] Feud if you just really dig into that a
[1:06:38] little bit about what all it all
[1:06:41] entailed the Marshall Plan was
[1:06:44] America was unbelievable in helping
[1:06:49] in helping Europe come to so do you have
[1:06:51] any like memories about coming over to
[1:06:53] Canada like when you got here I was 11.
[1:06:56] oh so you yeah you would yeah by the
[1:06:58] time you see we lived in Germany for for
[1:07:01] about
[1:07:02] uh
[1:07:04] for seven years than before we finally
[1:07:07] came but let me just share share
[1:07:10] something else that really happened with
[1:07:13] Mama is uh
[1:07:15] is one of the things that I really
[1:07:18] remember
[1:07:19] is
[1:07:21] you know when I got a little older
[1:07:24] I I would sleep in her bedroom
[1:07:28] you know I mean we had beds everywhere
[1:07:30] as you kind of position
[1:07:32] did y'all stay in the same building for
[1:07:34] all seven years of the same house same
[1:07:36] same house same place yeah it there was
[1:07:39] such a housing shortage it was
[1:07:42] but anyway I
[1:07:45] I do remember those 40s
[1:07:50] I would wake up in the night so often
[1:07:52] and she would be crying out to the Lord
[1:07:55] is is like I heard her pray that it was
[1:08:01] it was only the Lord that brought us
[1:08:02] through
[1:08:03] because
[1:08:06] I mean it was it was amazing but one of
[1:08:10] the things now that preacher really
[1:08:12] helped her a lot and he told her that
[1:08:15] she needed to pray through and the Lord
[1:08:17] would really answer
[1:08:19] and she had had quite a few Supernatural
[1:08:23] experiences her breakthrough came one
[1:08:26] night
[1:08:27] when in those early early 40s
[1:08:32] and
[1:08:34] she had been praying and it was dark
[1:08:38] and she said the room all lit up
[1:08:42] and she heard the audible voice of God
[1:08:45] and he quoted scripture to her
[1:08:49] about
[1:08:51] um one of them was yay I have loved you
[1:08:55] with an everlasting love and with loving
[1:08:58] kindness have I drawn you now it was so
[1:09:02] real to her
[1:09:03] that it because it was audible years
[1:09:06] later
[1:09:07] I remember I was talking to now this was
[1:09:10] all in German right
[1:09:12] and I was telling somebody about that
[1:09:16] scripture having been given to Mom and
[1:09:19] she was just passing by and I still see
[1:09:22] her she just stopped and she she didn't
[1:09:25] recognize the English version of it
[1:09:28] right well
[1:09:29] and she said what did you just tell her
[1:09:33] because as soon as you did she said
[1:09:35] everything it just came through me like
[1:09:38] like the power of God just struck me so
[1:09:41] what did you just tell her that's how
[1:09:43] real yeah how real it was yeah I
[1:09:46] remember standing in that kitchen it
[1:09:48] happened
[1:09:49] and then the other one he quoted three
[1:09:52] script scriptures to her
[1:09:55] that time
[1:09:56] and uh and the room was all light
[1:10:00] and then when he was over she said he
[1:10:03] placed his hand on her head
[1:10:05] and it the power of God just she felt
[1:10:08] the hands on her head and the power of
[1:10:12] God would strike her it was it was
[1:10:14] amazing I mean God just took care of us
[1:10:18] yeah for sure it was and we were taught
[1:10:22] we were taught to look for the
[1:10:24] supernatural
[1:10:25] and she always did
[1:10:28] so I mean I mean as you as a young girl
[1:10:31] for you to be you know laying in the
[1:10:33] same room as your mom praying and crying
[1:10:35] like that I mean that I mean I guess
[1:10:37] that's where you could have learned to
[1:10:38] like really pray I hurt you yes
[1:10:43] she was
[1:10:45] yeah and then when we came to Canada you
[1:10:48] know once they sponsored us
[1:10:51] and she it's still but you can imagine
[1:10:55] you're coming to a new country different
[1:10:58] language different Customs you don't
[1:11:01] know what is awaiting there was no
[1:11:03] income at all except you know my older
[1:11:08] siblings they by that time you know
[1:11:10] Adina art and Lydia had been there
[1:11:14] but then again she prayed and the Lord
[1:11:18] showed her
[1:11:20] and she heard kept seeing this hand
[1:11:24] and she heard him speak and she didn't
[1:11:26] know where where this was written
[1:11:30] and uh
[1:11:32] it
[1:11:33] and he said
[1:11:36] I no Ishmael
[1:11:40] it meant it was I will be the I will be
[1:11:44] I am the I am
[1:11:47] and she said she found it later in the
[1:11:49] scripture but it was the Luther
[1:11:50] translation and you know and that's uh
[1:11:54] he said I will be the I that that there
[1:11:57] is that is the
[1:11:59] yeah
[1:12:00] so that's God just really he really
[1:12:04] really we had to work very hard yeah but
[1:12:07] even as kids as you can imagine you know
[1:12:11] we had to go and uh
[1:12:14] and uh
[1:12:15] even as a preschooler I remember we had
[1:12:18] to go to the woods we have to get had to
[1:12:20] get gather Woods or we did a lot of
[1:12:25] gleaning after the farmers
[1:12:28] um when you know once they had dug the
[1:12:30] potatoes then we
[1:12:33] were free to go and do what you can get
[1:12:37] what we could yes and sometimes we would
[1:12:40] have a little bag full and you know but
[1:12:43] God always saw to it that we would
[1:12:46] we would you know we never we never went
[1:12:50] hungry and Mom she she almost could make
[1:12:54] something out of nothing you know yeah
[1:12:57] she was is that where you get your shoes
[1:12:59] from is your mom
[1:13:03] you like this she makes the best chicken
[1:13:05] skin
[1:13:07] and she's the one that got me hooked on
[1:13:10] coffee on coffee you were two years old
[1:13:12] I mean you've I mean really you've been
[1:13:14] a part of our family in Michigan a long
[1:13:16] time you've traveled the world with us
[1:13:18] yes yes she got me hooked that coffee on
[1:13:21] it I remember that table and this little
[1:13:23] guy that he thought I thought it was a
[1:13:26] big boy he drank coffee and you have
[1:13:30] been
[1:13:30] yeah whatever I'm addicted ever since
[1:13:35] so it's all thanks to you
[1:13:37] um yes I'm sure
[1:13:39] yeah you know it must have been I mean
[1:13:41] just a total like culture shock going
[1:13:43] culture it was gone from Germany to
[1:13:46] Canada it was yeah see I had I had all
[1:13:50] my in my basic schooling I finished I
[1:13:52] was in grade six by the time we came to
[1:13:56] Canada
[1:13:57] and um didn't understand a word of
[1:14:00] English
[1:14:01] so they they put us back into grade
[1:14:05] three
[1:14:07] just to learn yeah and then yeah but it
[1:14:10] didn't it took about two or three months
[1:14:13] and I was right back on yeah so there
[1:14:15] wasn't that wasn't much of a problem
[1:14:18] because as a as a young person it's
[1:14:20] surprising how quickly you do pick it up
[1:14:22] when you go back home do you still speak
[1:14:24] German to your family yeah I speak
[1:14:26] German very like but like they still
[1:14:29] speak it to them
[1:14:30] sometimes I don't even know which
[1:14:33] because I know
[1:14:35] like I'm saying Judith or do we call it
[1:14:36] Juju who is your niece yes
[1:14:39] um like when she when her mom calls her
[1:14:41] on the phone or something they both
[1:14:42] speak German to each other I know a lot
[1:14:43] of the time so yes that's why I didn't
[1:14:45] know yeah well we kept it up because
[1:14:47] when we were uh we went to a German
[1:14:50] English church Baptist Church okay they
[1:14:53] would have German services
[1:14:55] and in the morning and English in the
[1:14:58] evening so there again you know that's
[1:15:01] when you learn the because the Bible
[1:15:03] language is so different too yeah you
[1:15:05] know yeah for sure it was it it all
[1:15:08] worked out yeah but actually even the
[1:15:12] next the next Generation still speaks
[1:15:15] German yeah they do yeah um
[1:15:18] I want you to tell me about
[1:15:21] brother how you got to the services of
[1:15:23] brother Branham because it's a pretty I
[1:15:25] mean it's a pretty uh fascinating Story
[1:15:27] how God lined everything up for you able
[1:15:30] to get there and so like that and we
[1:15:31] have time for you to tell us I'd love
[1:15:33] for you to go ahead and tell that story
[1:15:34] and yes and how you uh were in his
[1:15:36] meetings Okay
[1:15:39] um that was in
[1:15:41] in 65
[1:15:44] at the end of
[1:15:47] well that was in January 65.
[1:15:53] um
[1:15:53] actually by that time you know we had
[1:15:57] gone through
[1:15:58] quite a bit in in the Baptist Church
[1:16:02] well first of all we were always looking
[1:16:04] for more
[1:16:06] somehow there was that pole you know and
[1:16:10] and uh
[1:16:12] I will I remember just being a barely a
[1:16:17] teenager and
[1:16:19] the Baptist preacher announced for
[1:16:22] instance that he was going to preach on
[1:16:25] the Book of Revelation I was so excited
[1:16:29] I thought I thought I now I really want
[1:16:33] to be able to understand that yeah right
[1:16:36] and I can't even tell you how
[1:16:39] disappointed I was
[1:16:41] when after he had done that
[1:16:45] I thought
[1:16:46] I could have done better
[1:16:48] I I don't mean to be bragging there but
[1:16:51] I thought
[1:16:52] you know when you just read
[1:16:55] I thought there is even women preachers
[1:16:58] there is a deeper no but what I'm saying
[1:17:01] is you know there's a deeper meaning
[1:17:03] there than what he said for sure
[1:17:07] and you knew that I just felt that and
[1:17:10] so that and you're always looking for
[1:17:13] more there's just there's this part of
[1:17:16] God that you that you wanted to
[1:17:21] too and I remember when I first heard
[1:17:24] brother Brown I'm later on I thought
[1:17:26] I've heard that before
[1:17:28] I've you know when he said that I
[1:17:31] somehow it was like you know you always
[1:17:35] said that a voice within a voice well I
[1:17:38] know for me I thought
[1:17:40] yeah that just clicks that's that's the
[1:17:44] way it is you know but anyway so we had
[1:17:49] there was a great like a split in the
[1:17:52] Baptist Church after like in the 50s
[1:17:55] okay already and that was very hurtful
[1:17:57] even to that Pastor and everything it
[1:18:00] was to me it was very traumatic but the
[1:18:03] German people they opened up another
[1:18:06] church on the south side and there was
[1:18:09] only German so we went there
[1:18:12] for quite a while and then
[1:18:15] they branched out some more
[1:18:18] and
[1:18:21] so
[1:18:22] I they had asked us they didn't have a
[1:18:26] choir or anything you know so they asked
[1:18:30] us to sing
[1:18:32] for one month until they kind of got
[1:18:35] established
[1:18:37] and okay we agreed for about a month we
[1:18:41] would do it
[1:18:42] but that then that one month turned into
[1:18:47] six months and I wanted to go back to
[1:18:51] that other church I was you know it was
[1:18:53] just temporary and that's what they had
[1:18:55] told us
[1:18:56] and but I can see now you know that God
[1:19:00] was using these Stepping Stones so to
[1:19:02] speak for sure and you got kind of
[1:19:06] really disgruntled and that's how I was
[1:19:11] we were very open
[1:19:13] to that we got invited to go to this
[1:19:17] little skid row mission that was a woman
[1:19:19] preacher
[1:19:21] and it was
[1:19:25] God was moving
[1:19:26] you know and we went there and that's
[1:19:29] where I had a powerful experience with
[1:19:32] the Lord and that's how we got us out of
[1:19:36] Baptist Church so it was just one thing
[1:19:38] so then when y'all left you heard about
[1:19:40] well you had already heard about brother
[1:19:42] Brandon really but
[1:19:45] there in that little mission
[1:19:48] they were there was a problem because
[1:19:52] many of those people had heard brother
[1:19:54] Branham and he he knew what he said
[1:19:56] about women preachers
[1:19:59] so there was another stepping stone
[1:20:02] so my family
[1:20:04] was in and out in no time
[1:20:07] you know about a half a year yeah and
[1:20:10] that was okay but
[1:20:13] not me
[1:20:14] I thought I'm gonna I'm tired I'm tired
[1:20:18] of going here and There and Everywhere
[1:20:20] You Know
[1:20:21] it was it I knew I had experienced the
[1:20:25] Lord there and to me it didn't matter if
[1:20:28] the drunks were in the back
[1:20:31] you know it just didn't I knew that I
[1:20:34] was I was finally coming into a real
[1:20:38] relationship with the Lord yeah it was
[1:20:40] real that was in 63
[1:20:42] and at the time
[1:20:45] at the time
[1:20:47] I was going I was finishing up my
[1:20:51] education I had to you know I had to
[1:20:54] quit because because and work to help
[1:20:57] contribute for our family
[1:21:00] to because times were very hard okay and
[1:21:04] so I would go back I would go to night
[1:21:06] school and you know I was always always
[1:21:11] studying going you know I was a bookworm
[1:21:14] anyway and so
[1:21:17] we I had gone I was in that Baptist
[1:21:21] College right there
[1:21:23] and that year I'll just quickly tell you
[1:21:27] that because because you will think it's
[1:21:29] funny
[1:21:32] okay here I am
[1:21:35] um 20. 20 21 something like that
[1:21:40] and uh
[1:21:41] so we would always have Chapel in the
[1:21:44] morning the whole of the it was also
[1:21:47] Seminary and and uh so we were all
[1:21:51] Gathering the chapel and I had a
[1:21:55] powerful
[1:21:56] I I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:59] that during that those Christmas
[1:22:02] wow
[1:22:04] holidays okay so our first day back
[1:22:09] um
[1:22:11] we we all gathered there
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:17] then they said we're going to do
[1:22:18] something different today we are going
[1:22:21] to have
[1:22:22] all of all of you testify what you have
[1:22:25] experienced during these Christmas
[1:22:27] holidays
[1:22:29] and I was sitting at the very front to
[1:22:32] the left
[1:22:34] and I thought oh good I'll be the first
[1:22:36] one and I'll get it over with because I
[1:22:38] thought
[1:22:39] I I would have to
[1:22:41] testify what the Lord did had done for
[1:22:44] me
[1:22:45] well they said no we'll do something
[1:22:46] this different this time
[1:22:49] and we'll start at the back
[1:22:51] so I was happen to be the very last one
[1:22:55] and they all all testified about how you
[1:22:59] know they visited Raul
[1:23:01] their relatives and all the good times
[1:23:04] they had and you know one after the
[1:23:06] other and then when it came to me
[1:23:10] I said I have to tell you something
[1:23:13] entirely different because I experienced
[1:23:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] and I have found out that God is real
[1:23:23] just very short yeah short and the uh
[1:23:29] the dean he was so nonchalant about that
[1:23:34] if as if I had talked about the weather
[1:23:36] but it was like it just settled over
[1:23:40] everybody I after that
[1:23:44] I'm telling you they watched me like a
[1:23:46] hawk
[1:23:49] they had special classes they had
[1:23:51] special instructions that you
[1:23:54] automatically received the baptism of
[1:23:56] the Holy Ghost when you believe and and
[1:24:00] all this they tried to disprove me and
[1:24:04] and I mean sometimes they made fun I
[1:24:05] remember this whole
[1:24:07] this man he was saying
[1:24:09] I'm this is all leading up to here to
[1:24:12] brother Branham but he he was saying
[1:24:15] Alfreda are you saying now this was a
[1:24:19] senior in the Seminary he was graduating
[1:24:22] these two of them and I was sitting in
[1:24:23] the lunchroom
[1:24:26] this is minding my own business and he
[1:24:28] and he said are you trying to tell me
[1:24:31] that this precious brother of mine here
[1:24:34] doesn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:36] so he put me on the spot that's right
[1:24:39] and
[1:24:41] so I just looked at him I said I don't
[1:24:44] know what he has I'm just telling you
[1:24:46] what I received
[1:24:48] it's probably the best energy
[1:24:51] yes
[1:24:52] and that they but um after a while I
[1:24:58] only got to study in the library I was
[1:25:00] not allowed I don't know I know
[1:25:03] it was it was pretty it was quite an
[1:25:07] experience but anyway but you can see it
[1:25:09] was just stepping stones
[1:25:11] to go on and then the Lord
[1:25:15] so here I kept Faithfully going to that
[1:25:18] that mission
[1:25:20] and
[1:25:22] um then there was a group of people
[1:25:24] going to hear Brother Branham
[1:25:27] and uh I in Tucson right Phoenix in
[1:25:31] Phoenix in Phoenix it was in January in
[1:25:33] Phoenix
[1:25:34] and
[1:25:36] what happened was
[1:25:39] I was working but at that time I was
[1:25:41] working for the oil company and I had
[1:25:43] had previous service with them so so
[1:25:46] that really worked out very well
[1:25:49] but this time it was a cold cold
[1:25:53] uh winter terrible winter we had
[1:25:57] and
[1:25:58] the the conditions were very severe and
[1:26:03] what happened it was
[1:26:05] the winter I mean it was so cold then a
[1:26:09] chinook had blown in like a warm wind it
[1:26:12] turned warm and then we had rain and
[1:26:15] then everything froze again so the whole
[1:26:18] city was like an ice box skating rink
[1:26:21] and uh just even the highway there was a
[1:26:25] short distance of about a 20 minute
[1:26:27] travel
[1:26:28] I remember there were 180 vehicles in
[1:26:32] the ditch wow yeah it was so I'm just
[1:26:35] describing you how how when you have an
[1:26:39] appointment with God
[1:26:41] he will he will see to it it gets
[1:26:45] down and I knew I had to okay
[1:26:49] so that morning I didn't drive my
[1:26:51] brother drove me but he in turn he had
[1:26:54] to go to the consulate he got his Visa
[1:26:57] he's got it he got his passport
[1:26:59] and I had a doctor's appointment so he
[1:27:02] dropped me off so by this time it was
[1:27:04] about 10 o'clock in the morning
[1:27:07] and I kept contemplating
[1:27:11] I could have gone there I there's still
[1:27:13] an empty seat uh with these strangers
[1:27:16] but I would be able to go with them
[1:27:19] and then so I just made mention made
[1:27:22] mention that to the girl sitting beside
[1:27:25] me there lady
[1:27:27] and she said
[1:27:28] go
[1:27:30] you know why don't you go and she was so
[1:27:33] persistent and my boss was actually
[1:27:38] at a very important meeting and and I
[1:27:41] said listen he's not even here I can't
[1:27:43] even ask for permission to go and she
[1:27:46] said call him
[1:27:51] and finally I did okay and I asked him
[1:27:56] and that man
[1:27:58] he is left his important meeting he said
[1:28:01] I'll be right there
[1:28:03] he left that meeting and and then Within
[1:28:09] just and I called my brother within just
[1:28:14] a short time I had my vacation because I
[1:28:18] had had previous service with him so I
[1:28:20] had my two week vacation we got paid
[1:28:22] twice a month the the money came my
[1:28:25] check came in the day before so that was
[1:28:28] waiting for me and he called the
[1:28:31] Personnel Department right away and and
[1:28:34] he says yeah because I needed a letter
[1:28:37] from them stating that I was working
[1:28:39] there and I would be returning
[1:28:41] and I called my brother
[1:28:43] and I said would you please come and
[1:28:45] pick me up because I want to go and get
[1:28:47] my I had no valid passport
[1:28:50] okay so by quarter to 12 and the the
[1:28:53] embassy closed at 12.
[1:28:56] quarter to 12 I had the money I had the
[1:28:59] vacation I had I had my my passport
[1:29:03] everything you couldn't get your
[1:29:04] passport that fast nowadays yeah but I
[1:29:07] was a German citizen yeah at that time
[1:29:11] I wasn't even a Canadian yet really no
[1:29:15] and so so that's why I had to go to the
[1:29:18] Embassy and I got it and and by I think
[1:29:21] about two o'clock we were on the just
[1:29:24] you and your brother or who just you my
[1:29:26] brother and I we went with this couple
[1:29:29] and their boy so there was enough room
[1:29:31] for three days we traveled to Phoenix
[1:29:34] now what brother went with you Herbert
[1:29:36] yeah the dark one here oh
[1:29:39] no
[1:29:40] and then we got to brother Brown on some
[1:29:43] meetings now I they didn't know these
[1:29:46] people they didn't know that I was still
[1:29:48] going to that mission because they had
[1:29:51] been there and left
[1:29:53] okay
[1:29:55] so these people that I went with because
[1:29:58] they would not have taken me
[1:30:00] okay
[1:30:02] and so anyway
[1:30:05] with brother Branham
[1:30:07] and I at home they had the reel to reel
[1:30:11] they played that but they let me go to
[1:30:14] you know it was okay but I was drawn to
[1:30:18] it but
[1:30:19] but I just I just had to know
[1:30:23] it was it was very important to me that
[1:30:26] it would become Revelation to me that
[1:30:29] that was it
[1:30:31] so there was that whole series of
[1:30:33] meetings how many did you attend
[1:30:36] uh
[1:30:37] actually it was six six he preached
[1:30:42] seven but we didn't know because of what
[1:30:44] happened when he preached birth pains
[1:30:47] that um
[1:30:49] that
[1:30:51] I he had had that experience with a
[1:30:55] priest handing him the Bible so actually
[1:30:57] that was supposed to have been his last
[1:30:59] meeting
[1:31:00] he was not and we had to leave on the
[1:31:03] Monday okay okay so but brother Branham
[1:31:06] had returned and he had he had told them
[1:31:10] what that was all about okay
[1:31:13] so so I we
[1:31:16] we attended six services and actually
[1:31:18] there was a total of seven what was that
[1:31:20] like but it was amazing you know he
[1:31:25] um turned his back to people
[1:31:28] towards the
[1:31:29] ending you know he he didn't look at
[1:31:32] them
[1:31:33] he he said because uh people have said
[1:31:36] you know it's mental telepathy and all
[1:31:38] of this so or he's reading people's
[1:31:40] minds and that so he when there was a
[1:31:44] prayer line you know he said I'll turn
[1:31:46] my back to him and he would tell them
[1:31:48] anyway but yeah it was amazing I
[1:31:52] remember
[1:31:52] um
[1:31:53] the very first time there were I would
[1:31:57] say there must have been close to 3 000
[1:31:59] people there at the hotel it was packed
[1:32:02] and talk about a noise talking talking
[1:32:06] talking I had my head down and all of a
[1:32:10] sudden it was like a hush came right
[1:32:13] over the whole audience that was I mean
[1:32:16] you're I'm just trying to give you a few
[1:32:18] details yeah no and and I thought what
[1:32:20] happened now you know and so here was
[1:32:24] brother Branham and he was greeting
[1:32:26] everybody on the platform and then he
[1:32:29] went to the pulpit and he said good
[1:32:30] evening friends you know and uh it was
[1:32:34] it was very special just just the
[1:32:36] atmosphere change in a moment yeah sure
[1:32:40] what was your feeling just sitting in
[1:32:43] there like well uh did it get better
[1:32:46] every night you went back or or well see
[1:32:49] I was going through the turmoil
[1:32:52] of having to leave
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:57] place you see I was still in going to
[1:33:00] that mission okay and I said Lord I'm so
[1:33:03] tired of this I had been fasting and
[1:33:06] praying that God would send the family
[1:33:08] back we would have a place to go to and
[1:33:11] uh and instead he got me out of there
[1:33:14] what happened
[1:33:16] it was I said Lord you will have to
[1:33:18] speak to me yeah you know you I I just
[1:33:22] can't
[1:33:23] I can't accept
[1:33:25] just anything you know these people were
[1:33:28] all all um
[1:33:31] Gung a hoe about brother Bannerman I
[1:33:33] loved what I heard
[1:33:35] don't get me wrong
[1:33:37] but would that mean that I would have to
[1:33:39] leave I said you would have to tell me
[1:33:41] Lord
[1:33:42] and I had that kind of a relationship
[1:33:44] with him it was it was very important to
[1:33:49] me
[1:33:50] so
[1:33:51] I
[1:33:53] as as the services went on
[1:33:56] and all of a sudden and that's how I
[1:33:59] perceived it I don't know it was my
[1:34:02] experience okay
[1:34:04] brother Branham was
[1:34:07] preaching all of a sudden suddenly he
[1:34:09] kind of stopped now you have to realize
[1:34:11] that we're about three thousand people
[1:34:14] and um
[1:34:17] it was like there was a connection
[1:34:19] between him and me I thought what just
[1:34:21] happened
[1:34:23] you know something was coming from him
[1:34:26] and he said lean not on your own
[1:34:28] understanding
[1:34:31] and he said if I were you I would not go
[1:34:33] back wow
[1:34:36] and I don't that's what I heard yeah
[1:34:39] okay and I can just tell you it was
[1:34:42] almost like a swish something just left
[1:34:44] him and touched me I felt something
[1:34:48] dropped like it's almost like something
[1:34:51] dropped from my eyes it was like my eyes
[1:34:55] were veiled before it and I felt it on
[1:34:57] my cheekbones just you know and I
[1:35:01] thought what just happened I had no idea
[1:35:06] but but
[1:35:08] that's a supernatural experience I had
[1:35:12] and from that moment on I knew I would
[1:35:14] not go back yeah I knew exactly God had
[1:35:18] answered my prayer that I needed to
[1:35:21] believe what that man was preaching for
[1:35:24] sure that's that's incredible yeah and I
[1:35:27] had no pull whatsoever to go back
[1:35:30] um and I loved it I loved it
[1:35:33] was there was there anything that like
[1:35:36] really stuck out to you about brother
[1:35:38] Branham or something
[1:35:40] I can tell you and yes I'll just share
[1:35:43] with you again and that it was
[1:35:46] um
[1:35:47] you know that Bishop Stanley is this
[1:35:50] still yeah that's fine okay
[1:35:52] Bishop Stanley was the the man
[1:35:55] who he was sitting on the front platform
[1:35:58] he were on the
[1:36:00] front row of the platform and brother
[1:36:03] banham had picked up the Bible
[1:36:06] and he had
[1:36:09] he had
[1:36:11] he was trying to find the the scripture
[1:36:13] about this day this scripture is
[1:36:16] fulfilled I think it was either he
[1:36:18] mentioned Luke 4 and and then he he said
[1:36:22] aren't or and Luke 16 or 17 I think and
[1:36:26] he couldn't find this scripture he had
[1:36:28] been looking for
[1:36:30] and uh and then he turned to Brother
[1:36:33] Moore I think behind him and he said
[1:36:36] isn't this the right one
[1:36:38] Etc
[1:36:39] and uh finally the priest gets up he had
[1:36:44] all of the his robes on you know and it
[1:36:46] was and he came over there and whispered
[1:36:49] something to brother Branham and handed
[1:36:51] him the Bible
[1:36:54] and um
[1:36:55] so then
[1:36:57] so he read it then and uh
[1:37:01] that's when he he spoke about all birth
[1:37:05] pains and Roy borders I think he had him
[1:37:09] preach before the service even began and
[1:37:12] he told of the incident you know when
[1:37:14] Alaska almost had that when he had
[1:37:17] thrown the rock up you're all familiar
[1:37:19] with that story and uh and right after
[1:37:23] that there was the Alaskan earthquake on
[1:37:25] Good Friday
[1:37:27] and that that was a terrible
[1:37:30] time okay so he spoke about that next
[1:37:33] was brother Brown and when that incident
[1:37:35] happened
[1:37:36] and he continued to preach about
[1:37:40] uh birth pains
[1:37:42] and then all of a sudden towards the end
[1:37:44] he was speaking about California and the
[1:37:47] condition that how sin was increasing
[1:37:52] and uh you know all the problems that
[1:37:55] they were having having
[1:37:58] when he did that
[1:38:00] all of a sudden this woman up at the
[1:38:03] front jumps up and begins to prophesy
[1:38:07] and she keeps saying like it was it I
[1:38:12] thought what is happening now here and
[1:38:15] you can hear it on the tape birth pains
[1:38:17] they in the books all they have written
[1:38:19] there was
[1:38:21] um
[1:38:23] a woman speaks in tongues that's all
[1:38:27] okay so they didn't it's never been
[1:38:29] printed right
[1:38:31] what she actually said but one of the
[1:38:34] things she said I am the god of Abraham
[1:38:38] Isaac and Jacob and she got louder and
[1:38:40] she really rolled her R's if you if you
[1:38:43] have you heard it yeah and then she kept
[1:38:47] saying them it's the message the message
[1:38:49] and she gets louder and she said the
[1:38:52] Judgment the judgment is coming and it
[1:38:55] is coming it is coming you know all all
[1:38:58] of that it was it was very powerful okay
[1:39:03] but then about a month later no the next
[1:39:07] day that's when brother Branham didn't
[1:39:10] really know what had really happened and
[1:39:13] the Lord had told him that when he read
[1:39:16] the scripture about that Jesus being in
[1:39:20] the synagogue and how he only read up to
[1:39:23] a certain point because it was the
[1:39:26] acceptable year of the Lord and then he
[1:39:29] did not read the time thing uh that part
[1:39:32] of the scripture that pertain to our day
[1:39:35] that the day of judgment you know is so
[1:39:39] all of that was transpiring in before us
[1:39:43] it was it was it was just amazing and so
[1:39:47] a month later brother Branham preached
[1:39:50] no when he came back the following day I
[1:39:54] I've just heard the tape
[1:39:56] okay he they allowed him to explain what
[1:39:59] had really happened so and and it's only
[1:40:02] about not not quite 30 minutes
[1:40:05] and
[1:40:06] but on there that woman prophesied again
[1:40:11] and uh it so you can hear that on the
[1:40:14] tape I knew normally I would not have
[1:40:18] um look for
[1:40:20] looked for it or anything but I
[1:40:23] because I had heard her
[1:40:25] and even um yes and even on my way back
[1:40:29] you know the people there they had they
[1:40:31] had told us that that was a pretty
[1:40:33] sister who had prophesied and apparently
[1:40:35] she had never spoken in tongues or
[1:40:38] prophesied before wow and a month later
[1:40:40] when brother Branham preached that this
[1:40:43] day this scripture is fulfilled then he
[1:40:47] referred to that again and yet just
[1:40:50] yesterday as I was reading that brother
[1:40:52] Branham said that she actually
[1:40:57] uh he had been discussing something with
[1:41:00] with Bishop Stanley up on the platform
[1:41:03] and he had just whispered it to him you
[1:41:06] know and they had not and and he said
[1:41:09] she
[1:41:11] prophesied what
[1:41:14] he they they were Whispering about wow
[1:41:17] yeah and she had never that's
[1:41:19] interesting yes it is as I thought
[1:41:22] another thing that happened in the
[1:41:24] service was with Florence shakarian
[1:41:28] and uh you know who she was I do yes
[1:41:31] okay now that was demus's sister and she
[1:41:35] was very ill at the doubt and uh she
[1:41:39] looked she I she wore this red dress she
[1:41:42] looked very Greek she was 42 years old
[1:41:45] and Demas came and she had a beautiful
[1:41:48] singing voice so he uh went and got her
[1:41:53] and they had her sing and she sang the
[1:41:56] song it's
[1:41:57] real it's real I know it's it's real
[1:42:00] okay and the second verse
[1:42:04] she she sang in tongues and the
[1:42:09] atmosphere now you have to realize
[1:42:13] I've come from Baptist background and
[1:42:16] just I had my own experience with the
[1:42:19] Lord I knew how powerful that was but
[1:42:23] um
[1:42:24] her whole body was shaking
[1:42:27] it and she's saying like it's the second
[1:42:30] verse in tongues wow yeah it was it was
[1:42:34] amazing okay
[1:42:36] the whole atmosphere changed and then
[1:42:39] people began to prophesy
[1:42:42] and the theme I remember there were
[1:42:44] three there may have been more but there
[1:42:47] was one lady that she was about two or
[1:42:50] three uh pews ahead of me you know so I
[1:42:54] heard her very well but in general it
[1:42:58] was all my daughter you will live and
[1:43:01] not die um
[1:43:03] and yet brother Brown I'mma have to go
[1:43:05] and tell Demas that
[1:43:08] she would not live that she would die
[1:43:10] within the year it would be between two
[1:43:13] and three o'clock in the morning and uh
[1:43:16] and uh you know that she was not so
[1:43:20] everything he had to say the exact
[1:43:22] opposite to what had transpired
[1:43:25] so I
[1:43:29] and it caused a lot of confusion
[1:43:32] as you can well imagine yeah for sure so
[1:43:35] and um
[1:43:37] but the priest Bishop Sandy he said all
[1:43:40] we have to do is just wait a year
[1:43:43] and see what happens well Florence died
[1:43:46] 10 months later between it was 20 to 3.
[1:43:50] and uh
[1:43:51] and I know he was with Carl Williams
[1:43:55] some brother Bonham was with her and
[1:43:59] he said something about can't you see
[1:44:02] her can't you see her and Carl says
[1:44:05] can't you see who you know he said it's
[1:44:08] Florence I see her climbing the golden
[1:44:11] stairs wow yeah
[1:44:14] so that so he she had
[1:44:18] she had passed away a young woman she
[1:44:21] was 42. yeah but so that was
[1:44:26] another another incident that happened
[1:44:29] was
[1:44:30] um you know that was also the time of
[1:44:32] the inauguration of
[1:44:36] President Johnson he had you know there
[1:44:40] had been that the Kennedy assassination
[1:44:43] and so he felt he completed that term
[1:44:45] and the next so that was his first his
[1:44:49] inauguration and he got really sick and
[1:44:53] everywhere on the news you heard well he
[1:44:55] had he was hospitalized and he had a bad
[1:44:58] case of the flu or whatever
[1:45:01] but they sent a telegram to brother
[1:45:04] Branham and asked him to pray for him
[1:45:07] because he had to have a heart attack
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:10] you know that and that is documented as
[1:45:13] well you know in there so those are some
[1:45:16] of the things that were those the only
[1:45:18] set of meetings that you went to a
[1:45:19] brother yes he was yes
[1:45:22] because he died 11 months later yeah and
[1:45:25] and that was very that was very see and
[1:45:28] because of what had happened to me that
[1:45:30] experience see I didn't go back but we
[1:45:34] you know you also have to realize you
[1:45:36] hardly had any tapes
[1:45:39] so brother Martins this was like my
[1:45:42] brother's future uh father-in-law he he
[1:45:47] received all the realtor reels and
[1:45:49] because there was it was quite a group
[1:45:52] already they
[1:45:55] um
[1:45:56] he passed them around but so we got to
[1:45:59] keep them maybe for just a few days and
[1:46:01] then we had to pass them on okay I mean
[1:46:04] it's hard to believe you know but there
[1:46:06] was nothing to be had hardly anything in
[1:46:08] in writing it's crazy to think about it
[1:46:11] now you have it on your phone or on
[1:46:12] everything yes and crazy yeah and it was
[1:46:16] so we listened to that and in that whole
[1:46:21] summer okay I from January and brother
[1:46:25] Bonham died this December so that was 11
[1:46:28] 10 months 11 yeah
[1:46:31] months later
[1:46:32] I
[1:46:34] I remember when I heard brother Branham
[1:46:36] had passed away
[1:46:38] my reaction was not
[1:46:42] I mean I I thought it was terrible it
[1:46:44] was it was like a family member had just
[1:46:47] passed away but my reaction was this now
[1:46:52] what is going to happen
[1:46:54] what's going to happen about the White
[1:46:57] Eagle Ministry I heard him talk about
[1:46:58] about the seventh seal what about the
[1:47:01] Thunders what about the tent Vision what
[1:47:04] about the bride's Revival
[1:47:06] and to me everything was hinged on him
[1:47:09] yeah amen
[1:47:11] I was certain he's got to come back
[1:47:15] I mean I know that this is real
[1:47:18] God let me know
[1:47:21] that this is what I was to follow
[1:47:25] and
[1:47:27] what you know I mean that's your initial
[1:47:29] reaction and then it was it was very
[1:47:33] very hard but it didn't take too long
[1:47:36] and I realized God was going to do some
[1:47:39] other things yeah you know but there's a
[1:47:42] lot of people who have
[1:47:44] have you know
[1:47:48] follow that and they think yeah
