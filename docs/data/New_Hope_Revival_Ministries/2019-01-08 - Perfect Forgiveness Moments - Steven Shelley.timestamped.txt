[0:13] there are memories that none of us want
[0:16] to relive there are places in our life
[0:18] that none of us want to walk through
[0:20] however we don't want to miss the
[0:24] opportunity to embrace that God used
[0:28] some of those situations to shape us in
[0:33] a way that he can use us
[0:35] Satan meant it I guarantee you we know
[0:38] Satan meant it to kill us he meant it to
[0:42] destroy us and he meant to lead us into
[0:46] enough sin that we would never be able
[0:48] to forgive ourselves and because we
[0:51] could never forgive ourselves we would
[0:52] never be able to really receive God's
[0:55] perfect forgiveness for her better think
[0:58] of that because that's really what the
[1:00] old devil is after he's still after that
[1:04] keeping you in a place where you can't
[1:07] let go and so here you are hearing the
[1:10] deep call feeling the pole and you're
[1:13] standing on the outside of the holy of
[1:16] holies and you're just about ready to
[1:18] step into a new dimension in the spirit
[1:20] that's promised for the bride of Jesus
[1:22] Christ you could call it many things the
[1:25] full manifestation of the spoken word
[1:26] the full manifestation of the third pool
[1:28] prophesy again you could call it the
[1:31] manifestation of the sons of God there
[1:33] are so many things that we could call it
[1:35] but your ride up right up to the edge
[1:38] and you're just about to step in you
[1:41] want to be able to go on in regardless
[1:43] of the howl of the enemy
[1:47] that only comes we're only gonna be able
[1:51] to step in when we truly know who we are
[1:54] and when we truly recognize not only is
[1:58] every bit of that forgiven it no longer
[2:01] disqualifies us in any way from being
[2:05] used in the kingdom of God because like
[2:07] Paul you didn't know what you were doing
