TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope a lord hello and welcome to the program again today I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and I'm coming to you again today in partnership with our great friends at the gospel channel and we are thankful to God I don't take this opportunity for granted I'm thankful to the Lord every day for giving me the chance to be able to speak to you the precious Word of God it's life to us you know there are things in the Word of God that are corrective but I've been told that love is corrective and I know that God loves me I want you to know today that God loves you and his word is his answer to every situation in your life there are times that we read the Word of God and it encourages us it blesses us it strengthens us to move forward in him and there are times that we read it and we see by God's Word that we're not quite measuring up to what the scripture is asking of us and instead of being condemned we take that as conviction and we can repent and we can say lord help me to align myself with your precious word so when you're reading the scripture understand that it is the plan of God's salvation and redemption for all mankind it's a love letter from the heart of God to you and make it personal you know I've often heard preachers say put your name in there you know when you're reading the scripture for God so loved the world don't be ashamed to read it for God so loved Stephen Shelley that he gave himself I think it's important to make the Word of God personal to see ourselves as a part of God's economy I want to say also that I believe in the power of prayer it's not prayer in itself but prayer is a means that God has given us of coming into fellowship with him to bare our heart before him to agree with what his word has spoken about particular situations to cast our cares to lay our burdens at his feet and I am often overwhelmed with a great sense of peace and assurance when I'm finished praying knowing that my Heavenly Father hears and that he answers and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him and I think I did this a couple of programs back but I wanted to do it again today I wanted to show you across the world where you're watching this program I wanted to show you this stack of prayer requests and I wanted you to know that these are the emails and the phone calls that have been recorded of you reaching out to us sharing your heart sometimes very personal details and it it blesses me to know that you have seen something or heard something in this program that would cause you to have enough confidence in us that you would call or write and share what's going on in your life right now and I want you to know that all of us at New Hope revival ministries take this seriously in fact this stack of prayer requests is rarely very far from where I am it's usually where I am I often take it home with me when I leave the office so that when I pray in the evening or in the morning before I come in I have it I don't think that's necessary but I like laying my hands on it as a point of agreement and contact and I like looking through it again and again and again and reading your names which I wouldn't read on the air without your permission but I enjoy reading your name here a precious sister has called from London asking for prayer for her daughter's kidneys she's in the hospital and things have not been going well and we've been praying over that request since it came in lately we've had a lot of requests from people who have have experienced some of the spiritual attacks that we have been talking about and you have been able to identify with some of the teaching that has gone forth and you have written us to pray and we have been praying here is someone who has just experienced a whole battery of medical tests and they're asking the Lord for healing and for good results from those tests here is someone who feels like their family has been dealing with witchcraft that's been spoken against them and they desire to have freedom and to live in peace and love and harmony that's what the request says and these are just a small representation of the needs that are out there these are the ones who have taken the time to reach out and to let us know that you would appreciate our faith being joined with yours I want to start our time together today with a word of Prayer and even if your requests are not in this stack I want you to know that when we pray over these needs we're praying over your needs as well we believe that that God is able to reach right down into your home into your place of business into into your wherever you are wherever you're watching this program and I say it that way because we're not only airing this on the television but it will air on YouTube and it will air on the gospel channel website where you can access the website all over the world and watch the programs on the three networks that are represent they're the one that reaches into Scandinavia the one that reaches across the beautiful island of Iceland and the one that reaches across Europe all three of those feeds you can can see them right there on the gospel channel on their website and so I don't know where you're going to see this but I want you to know that when we pray together in a moment you put your need before the Lord and you join your faith with our faith and let's see some miracles take place the Bible tells us that if we will agree together as touching any one thing that it would be given to us and I'm not just saying that because I have something to sell I don't have anything to sell I'm saying that because I've lived it and I believe it with every fiber of who I am I've watched the Lord answer prayer I've stood in the hospital room where the doctor said there is no hope not even prayer I've had doctors say to families in my presence not even prayer would be able to help us now well I want you to know I've seen the Lord step into the room I've seen the Lord reverse what the doctor said could not be reversed I've actually seen those who were told they would never walk again with my own eyes I've watched them walk again those who were told they would never speak again and I was in the room when they spoke their first words after many years because of an accident that took away their ability to speak let me tell you something with with faith in God all things are possible and I truly believe that and we usually go off the air with a prayer but today I want you to agree with me in prayer right now that God will move on your behalf whatever your need is let's pray together Heavenly Father we thank you today for this wonderful privilege that you have given to us I stand amazed that the God of all eternity would bow his ear to our humble prayer it blesses me to know Lord with all that goes on in the universe that you give an attentive ear to the cries of the righteous to the calls of your people and today O God we lift up every need that is represented in this stack of prayer requests and with them Lord we add every need that is represented by every viewer of this program across the board all of the different means by which someone could see this program it even sometimes appears on Facebook lord I ask that every one of those needs that are hidden in the hearts of the viewer right now that you would consider them Oh God as we lift up our faith to you knowing that you are faithful you are the healer many sicknesses many infirmities but you are the healer of them all you are Jehovah Rapha the Lord our God who healeth all of our diseases Lord some are under demonic attack I know there are some who might watch the program who who mock at the very idea but many of us as believers understand the battle that rages in the realm of the Spirit but Lord we look to you right now and we break curses of witchcraft and we break satanic strongholds and we asked Lord for grace to close demonic doorways that these precious ones could be set free from the attack of the enemy we pray as we have prayed before that you would help each believer to identify any area in their life where they should close the door maybe a door has somehow been opened up that has the enemy some permission to move against them lord I ask that you would pinpoint that even now and show them the way of escape you said Lord with every temptation you would give us a way of escape Lord I pray for the backslider who might be watching this program or who has a loved one who is watching the program and calling out to you for their salvation for their fellowship with you to be renewed I pray right now that you would draw them back to the fold that you would work in their lives according to your plan oh god whatever the needs are some marriages are rocky and relationships have been severed Oh God wedges have been driven down between longtime friends and neighbors who have once worked together and moved together and now the enemy has come to destroy that relationship but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we look to you today O God to move to saved a heal to deliver to set free because that's who you are old precious Lord we pray for the gospel channel we pray for brother Eric Erickson and the staff that you would bless them and strengthen them we pray for every need that they have we pray for financial breakthrough for the network that it would be able to continue to go forward and spread the good gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray right now that you'd bless our time together in your word today and that you would search our hearts and if there be any place in us that is rebellious against your word or against your will and plan for our lives would you show it to us today Lord and give us grace to turn from rebellion and to walk in total submission to truth that's who you are and truth makes us free we pray all of these things and for every need represented by those viewing this program right now in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Yeshua our Messiah that's who you are Lord and we thank you amen and amen I believe God I believe God if you'd like to add your prayer requests to this stack please feel free to do so this is program 11 in a series that we have entitled schemes and devices and in one way we're winding down in this portion of the study and yet there is a very similar direction that I I'm praying about and strongly considering moving into where we would be a little more specific than what we've been in this particular series and really look at some of the ways our lives can be opened up to that dark side of the spirit world I I believe that there are boundaries that that surround the life of the believer and I believe that when we let down when we move those boundaries when we let down the walls and we are careless with some of our decisions we really open up our life and we make ourselves very vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy I believe there's power in the blood of Jesus Christ there's power in the name there's power in the Word of God we were talking together in a program a few back in the series again about the whole armor of God God's armor that he has given us to protect us to give us what we need to not only stand against the wiles of the enemy but to fight for our lives and sometimes it seems that that's what the battle is about fighting for the victory you know one of the things that I like the enemy uses against God's people until it makes me angry I hope you don't lose confidence in me for saying so but I get mad when I see how the enemy uses depression and anxiety and emotional heaviness against the people of God it really makes me fighting mad and I know that if you and I could recognize that it is the enemy and if we could recognize that we have already been given power over the enemy in that area over the last couple of days I've been following a news story in our country of a young pastor who took his own life maybe you've seen that across social media and it has caused me to weep because I I don't have one word of criticism I don't have one word of judgment it is not up to me whether another man serve it stands or Falls it's not my place to judge anyone's eternal home where where they live for eternity that is between them and God but I can tell you as a pastor I completely understand how the enemy targets the people of God and how he specifically targets those of us who have surrendered our lives to ministry and to live instead of for ourselves to live for others and it's broken my heart to think about small children who will grow up without a father and a precious young wife without her husband and a precious Church a vibrant church I understand who will certainly be shaken to the core how can these things happen but I want you to know the enemy is sly and he will use every trick and every temptation that he can possibly utilize to try to take God's people out because he sees those of us who are walking in the spirit as threats it's as though many of us have a an x mark on our back and we're targeted by the enemy this is not something that should provoke fear in us but it should certainly provoke awareness I also want you to know that mental disease is real it's it's not something that is made-up mental sickness or mental disease it's a very serious problem in the United States of America and around the world and when someone is in ministry it's it's so humiliating it seems so embarrassing it seems actually it is for anyone who fights in that area who battles with that kind of a sickness but you can imagine a pastor or a church leader and I wonder sometim who can they reach out to even as a pastor who can I reach out to if I'm battling in such a manner as that I want you to know that we all need those connections we all need accountability partners we all need peers there's no doubt about it we need friends we need human contact we need to be able to support one another but I want you to know there are limits to what we can do for one another unless you've walked in that kind of a situation where you've experienced panic attacks and anxiety and depression and all that goes with it suicidal tendencies and thoughts unless you've walked in that kind of a place it's very hard for us to understand exactly what someone is going through and so when we say to them I know what you're going through it's very hard for them to accept that we know but here's what I want to say to you at the end of this of this little speech I want to tell you that Jesus is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother and although we need all these friends and we need a support system and we need to be able to cry out for help even ministers even worship leaders watching this program right now you need to be able to cry out for help you need to be able to be transparent find someone that you can say I'm struggling and I need prayer but at the end of the day I want you to know there there are limits to what people who love us can do for us but hear me well there is no limit there is no limit to what God can do for us when we lean on him when we totally throw ourselves at his mercy and we say oh god it's no longer up to me whether I sink or swim it's up to you I've gone as far as I possibly can go in my own strength and I'm going to seemingly lay here and die if you don't raise me up but I am depending and trusting you you have promised me in your word and you know maybe some of you hear this and you you think I must really be a naive person but I'm basing what I tell you on experience not just my own experience but the experience of so many others that I have walked with through the years there's just nobody like Jesus to know him to be able to talk to him you know what this is a strange statement to make but I have shared some things with the Lord that I wouldn't want to share with another I love my wife I can talk to my wife I hope she can talk to me but there are feelings that I've had thoughts that have come through my mind hurts and anger and and and roots of bitterness that creep up that I wouldn't have wanted to tell a single solitary soul embarrassed humiliated to admit to someone that after all these years I would have a thought like that or I would struggle through a situation like that but I have found out you can tell Jesus you can share with him whatever you're going through and however you feel and I don't think I've ever shocked him I may have disappointed him but his love for me has been so real that when I finished I don't know if this is proper to say in every place where this program will air but sometimes we make this expression spill my guts maybe that's way too too graphic to say it just means you know you just pour out everything to the Lord you just tell him everything every hidden thing every everything you'd be embarrassed to tell anybody else and this piece I don't ever remember getting up from one of those confession sessions where I felt like the Lord was angry with me I don't ever remember feeling like you're he's angry with me or he'll never use me again or he's gonna kick me out because I've been honest with him let me tell you something children of God we live below our means even I struggle at times I know to understand the depth of God's love for me he loves me he loves you he is for you he is not against you he may not like everything that we say or do we may not always please him or live according to his word but if our heart is toward him and we are actively seeking to surrender to his authority in our lives I'll tell you he'll go the farthest mile he'll walk in places where you would think God would never walk he'll reach out to you in situations that you would think he would never reach out to you in that's his love for you I don't know who I'm talking to right now but I'm telling you no matter how bad your circumstances are life with geez it's worth the living I can't tell you that your life as it is right now is worth the living I don't know you and I don't know the circumstances of your life but I'll tell you this life with Jesus I don't care how bad life is if you live it now with Jesus it'll change everything for you it'll give you the grace to to pick yourself up to look up to push push a little harder to press in a little more fervently and believe that with God all things are possible things can change when we surrender our lives to him so let him come invite him and then make room for him to come and occupy your your heart and to occupy your life if you are struggling with depression if you're struggling with anxiety if you're struggling with thoughts of suicide open your heart right now let the love of God come in let the truth of God's Word penetrate the darkness and let me tell you again life with Jesus is worth the living no matter what the circumstances are right now I don't believe there's a circumstance that God can't make a difference in if we open up and we allow him to come in and to move in every area of our lives find someone find a church somewhere find something to be connected to where someone can support you and help you but if that's not available to you understand that God wants to meet with you and your flat he wants to meet with you in your home right where you are his spirit can be just as real and just as tangible as a friend coming over and sitting and having a cup of tea with you his presence can be that satisfying his love can be that comforting if you just open your heart to him and I know we pray but I'm going to pray again father in the name of Jesus Christ whoever I'm speaking to right now I pray Lord that if as they open their heart to you you would allow your love to become as tangible as I have described it to be let your presence surround them right now or father and confirm to their heart that life with you is worth the living and lord I ask you to give them grace to surrender every area of their life that looks so dark and so broken and so hopeless and I'm asking you to come and get glory in the darkness in the hardship in the in the dire circumstance come Oh God and receive glory for your name by manifesting and breaking out and breaking forth in every area of that life we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I believe the Lord is speaking to someone and I believe that he's there he's as close as you and I will allow him to be when we studied the Word of God together last time we were we were mentioning a time when God gave very specific instructions on how a particular thing was to be handled Saul went into this situation knowing that God had said every one of the Amalekites must be destroyed he knew exactly what God was requiring of him in his day and understand that things were different in the day of King Saul than they are now and King Saul was being used of God to not only secure safety for the people of God in that generation but in other generations to come and because Saul was not completely surrendered to this instruction but he thought that his idea was a little bit better than God's idea he thought his plan was a little bit superior to God's plan and so he obeyed in almost all of the details but there were some details that that he just wasn't obedient in he kept certain of the animals and even more dangerously he allowed King Agag the king of the Amalekites to live and what what happened because of that was it would have been a seed that would have continued on that would have always brought threat against the people of God and God wanted this to be a threat that was completely wiped out and so he sent the prophet Samuel to meet Saul coming back from the slaughter and to speak to him about what had happened and you know Saul knew in his heart that he had not fully obeyed the Lord just like nearly every person watching this program right now you know in your heart the areas of your life where you have been fully surrendered to God and you also know right now those those little places in your life that you have held on to and that you have not allowed the Word of God and the Spirit of God the love of God to penetrate those areas where you have not been obedient Saul knew and instead of just opening up and facing the consequences saying to the prophet Samuel I'm guilty what's going to happen to me now he got very religious and he said all yes I have spared some of the animals because we wanted to sacrifice them to God you know God wasn't looking for a sacrifice he was looking for submission and for obedience and the Bible tells us obedience is better than sacrifice to obey God what he's looking for in our lives is it always easy preacher to obey God no I try to be honest and transparent with you there are times that God asked of us things that they don't feel so easy to do but the older I get the more I learn and the more I've experienced I now have more years to look back on in those moments when it seemed that God was asking requiring something of me that I just did not have the strength to do as I prayed about it as I yielded myself and just finally said Lord I can't do it on my own but if you think I can evidently Lord you think I can or you wouldn't have required it of me and so I'm asking you for grace now all grace come on now amazing grace God's grace empowers us strengthens us to do things for him that we would never think possible in the natural so in every area of your life like King Saul where you have not been completely submitted and obedient to God I ask you allow the grace of God to come in allow the strength of the Lord to come in if he wants it done he knows how to give you grace to yield your life to yield the gifts that he has placed in your life so that the work can be accomplished and so this this confrontation between the prophet Samuel and King Saul it came down to some serious moments and finally after Saul was confronted for failing to obey God's commandments completely he was then rebuked by the Prophet saying for rebellion this is first samuel 15 verse 23 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry you see God saw right through Saul's excuse this had nothing to do with soul desiring to bring more sacrifices this had everything to do with Saul's own pride he thought that he had a plan that was superior to God's plan i I've been guilty I've been guilty of the very same thing and maybe you have too if you followed the Lord for any period of time God leads us circumstances open up doors begin to open up God begins to reveal his plan for a particular situation and all of a sudden we get a bright idea a bright idea that turns out not to be so bright let me tell you something if it's not God's idea it's not often a bright idea what God inspires ideas that he breathes inspiration into that's a good idea and when God says you go and do a work do a job and do it thoroughly it's a good idea to obey and saw found that out he found out that this was not even though he offered a religious excuse as we often do he found out God saw right through it and this was not a matter of wanting to be more faithful and more religious and offer more sacrifices he found out that this was rebellion I wonder if it was a surprise to Saul to hear spoken aloud by the prophet Samuel that there was actually witchcraft rebellion in his life for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry I believe we need to be steadfast but we don't need to be stubborn because stubbornness is as the sin of idolatry and rebellion is likened to witchcraft why would that be well it's interesting the rebellion is likened to witchcraft because witchcraft is about control and really rebellion is a power struggle it's really about who is going to be in control of my life of my decisions of my choices is it going to be me shouldn't I be don't I have my rights shouldn't I be in charge of my own life or will I surrender my will to God's will and to God's Way so in this story we learned that there's a spirit behind rebellion and it's not the Holy Spirit but it's rather witchcraft how can then a stubborn person be guilty of idolatry I think we mentioned the last time we were together he makes an idol of his own thoughts of his own opinions nobody has better thoughts better opinions better ideas than that man and when when he feels that way and lives that way operates that way he's leaving out the most important part of life God the one who has a better plan the one who has a more superior way and so his own opinions become like idols like gods to him it's really a form of self worship it really is it's at the root of humanism that you as a human being are the center of the universe and that everything is about you well I want you to know you're a very special person and you're a very special part I know of God's economy but it's not all about you it's all about God it's not the whole universe the whole world doesn't revolve around you and I as human beings rather it should revolve around the Creator the one who has given so much that we can have peace you know sometimes I hear agnostics say well God must really be a control freak because he wants everything done his way well I I'd be careful to say something like that but I understand how our mind our thoughts can be twisted when we're in rebellion against God you know you hear people say I don't believe that there is a God these people are followers of atheism or they call themselves atheist I've had a few that I've had an opportunity to speak to through the years and a couple of those people when they say to me boldly I don't believe in God and I said well that's alright God doesn't believe in atheist and neither do i God doesn't believe in atheist and I don't believe in atheists because I truly believe that most every individual on the planet is aware that there's something bigger something higher something more powerful than themselves maybe they call it the wrong thing maybe they go about devoting themselves to it in a wrong way but I believe that God knows how to speak up for himself and I pray for people like that I don't see and maybe you're like me I don't see how anyone could live in the world we're living in today see the beauty study a little bit about the human body and believe that that nature could just take its course and we would be where we are today in our world the intelligence that we have the technology that we have the beauty that the world has to offer there oh yes sir there is a divine creator there is a divine intelligence that's behind this creation that we all enjoy he desires not because he wants to control our lives but he desires that we submit to him because he wants to bring blessing into our life he wants to bless us and the most blessed life that anyone can live on planet Earth is a life that is laid down to Jesus Christ the one who gave everything that you and I would not only know peace while we're temporarily on this planet but that we could know peace for all eternity I would say that no matter who you are a god like that is worthy of your devotion a god like that is worthy that you would surrender your will and your weight to him rebellion can get down in us we think we know better than God we think we know a better way of doing things than the way that God has outlined in the scripture and this in itself is a scheme this in itself is a device that Satan is using to keep people from enjoying the full benefit of laying down your life for Jesus Christ serving him in real peace in real joy in real obedience the New Testament talks about rebellion and likens that also to witchcraft it's described witchcraft is described in two ways in the New Testament one as a work of the flesh and that's in Galatians and second as an evil spiritual power so witchcraft is not just necessarily incantations and dark magic and the things that that people get so interested in it seems but witchcraft is about control it's about manipulation it's about wanting to be in charge wanting to have authority Oh or something that we've not been given authority over in Galatians three one I believe we used this verse the last time we were together but I want to mention it again Galatians three one who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth you see disobedience is being likened here to being bewitched under the influence of witchcraft who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified did you know there were believers and that was the New King James I think did you know there were believers in the church at Galatia that had seen with their own physical eyes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ they not only saw with their eyes his crucifixion but they knew very well that he had resurrected from the dead they knew very well that he had ascended from Jerusalem into the heavenlies with a promise that I'm going away and if I go away I'm coming back in like manner they were aware of though of the instruction that was given to tarry in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high but just a few short years after the crucifixion and the resurrection and the Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ there were some in the church in Galatia that were already under a spell even though their physical eyes had seen the reality of the crucifixion and the resurrection of our Lord they were already under this this bewitching spirit of rebellion to do their own thing to be their own somebody and believing that their idea was superior to God's idea bewitchment is defined the power to mislead as in using spells or hexes or incantations etc I don't believe Paul was mistaken when he chose to use a word that would mean such a thing because he was likening rebellion to this form of manipulation and control Satan Satan your enemy is the one who plants this seed or or spreads this influence of rebellion in your life where you start getting this this idea I know the better way I know I know how to live my life I have my rights and then this thing gets stronger and stronger until we are no longer submitted to the Lord and here were Christians followers of Jesus Christ who had fallen under a spell so to speak under the influence being misled it baffles my mind because these were people who saw him die who are very well aware of his resurrection and ascension the Greek word for bewitchment literally means to smite or to mislead with the eyes you know sometimes we can't believe what we see because the enemy will influence our vision he will cause us to see things in a perverted way which is a word that means twisting the enemy likes to twist truth the enemy will take God's Word and give you an alternative understanding of a scripture that's his plain as the nose on your face I hear people in this modern age that we live in taking God's Word and fixing it up to seemingly mean whatever it is they want it to mean how many of you know that's why God teaches us in the word how to apply the word how to approach the word and how to apply the word and that's by laying line upon line and precept upon precept that's not that's not by taking a verse of scripture and with a heart of rebellion twisting that to mean what we want it to mean because it would be more convenient I want you to know God's way is the best way God's way is the right way God's Way is the holy way and God's Way is the only way that has the benefits it has the blessing and not only blessing as we live on planet Earth but what about eternity what about eternity with him oh yes I believe yes I believe that there is a promise beyond this life I believe there's a home that's been prepared for the believer beyond this life and I also believe that the enemy will do anything and everything he can to bewitch us to manipulate us with a spirit of rebellion that says I don't doesn't matter what that what that says doesn't matter what the Bible said doesn't matter what the preacher says I'm gonna do it my way all God have mercy let's not fall into that trap because this is one of the schemes and the devices that the enemy uses in this hour I'll just read my note here Jesus had been crucified before the very eyes of some of these Galatian people and yet they were unable to see and obey this is the reason why we say that the work of the cross was obscured from before them they forgot what they saw the twisting influence of the enemy had caused them to no longer see clearly the death the price the blood that came streaming down before their eyes a perfect blood a blood created for salvation and redemption I'm telling you if anyone knew of the gift that had been given these Galatians knew it because unlike us they saw it with their physical eyes but Calvary the remembrance of what they saw the remembrance the memory of of the price that was paid it began to get howdy and blurry and obscured and before Satan before the enemy can lead us into rebellion or influenced us with bewitchment as defined in this verse of scripture before he can do that to a true believer the power of the cross must be obscured so the first thing he he tries to do before leading us completely astray is to cause us to forget what happened for us at Calvary if the enemy can disqualify you if he can somehow cause you to see yourself on the outside of what Jesus did at Calvary or he can diminish or devalue what took place on my behalf listen my behalf if I would have been the only one that needed him he would have gone all the way to the cross for me if you would have been the only one in all of history that would have needed his blood to be shared his life to be laid down I believe he would have gone all the way for you this is Grace it's a gift that I don't have words really to even explain how can we even comprehend but one of the ways we can make sure that it doesn't become obscured in our vision is keep it ever before us remind yourself often of the price that has been paid remind yourself often friend just quote the verse I am NOT my own as the apostle said I am NOT my own I have been bought with a price blessed be the name of the Lord and not a corruptible price one of gold or silver ore or treasure here on the earth but an incorruptible price the precious and perfect blood of the spotless lamb at Calvary keep your eyes on the cross don't allow even the modern songs of the church cause you to forget you know sometimes I listen to the words of our more popular worship music where it seems that so much of it focuses on our experience perhaps on our reaction to his presence and if you're finding the same thing I find find you some songs that focus on what he did on our behalf my oldest son Benjamin is 20 years old and he is one of the worship leaders in our church and he sings some of the modern worship songs and some of them I really enjoy some of them are not quite my cup of tea but there's not a feeling any sweeter than to hear him after maybe singing something a little more popular hear him lead us on a Sunday morning when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot thou has taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul there's a verse in that hymn that talks about my sin not in part but in whole are nailed to the cross they're no longer before me brother when you begin to think on that truth or you sing the old hymn of the church victory in Jesus your he is he is our victory you've got to keep the truth of redemption the truth of salvation ever before your eyes you've got to remember if you do that friend it will be harder for the enemy to plant a seed or to cast a cloak of rebellion over your life he can't manipulate you if you keep the cross ever before you I hope you understand what good advice that is rebellion is a work of the flesh we read in Galatians 5:19 and 20 both witchcraft and idolatry are mentioned there is works of the flesh right next to adultery fornication hatred murder and drunkenness so so to to operate in rebellion against God's will and God's Way is as serious in the New Testament theology in the scripture of the New Testament as some of these other things that we are so dead set against and we stay as far away from as we possibly can I want you to know the enemy wants to operate illegitimate power over your life and he wants to cause you to move in rebellion and I believe there's power to break that over your life I believe that we can take some practical steps I I know that the modern church seems to be teaching in many places that repentance is no longer necessary I just see the Apostle Paul who had been through a whole lot more than I've been through and and he said I die daily every day I have to come back to Calvary and remember that when he died I was in him the scripture is clear every day I have to go back and remember my death was in him and there are some things in my life that I have to keep putting them under submission to the Word of God to the authority of God it may sound a little old-fashioned but obedience is what God is looking for in our life and if we don't walk before him with His grace and to obey Him we are opening up our life in fact I have a highlighted note here every time I insist on having my own way I expose myself to satanic or demonic influence and I believe that I believe when we choose our own way and reject the way of God and what God has called us to in his word we are swinging open the door for complete rebellion against who God is and what he has accomplished on our behalf at the cross I know we've prayed twice already but in the moment I have left I'd like to pray again Father in the precious name of Jesus Christ I ask Lord for the gift to every believer who's watching right now that you would renew our vision of the Cross would you let us keep the work that you accomplished for us in that bloody sacrifice would you help us Lord to remember it to keep it ever before us to keep our eyes on you and remember what you have done for us and on our behalf and Lord I repent right now of any area of my life where I have been rebellious or where I choose continue to choose my way over your way I pray right now you'll give my friends the same grace to repent to say Lord in any area of my life where I keep doing my own thing instead of your thing I repent I ask for your forgiveness and I ask you Lord to teach me how to yield myself teach my friends Lord how to yield themselves more and more to your precious love to your precious grace we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so glad unsaved I'm glad I'm sanctified I'm glad that I'm filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire you can have the same experience seek the Lord thank you for watching the program today I've thoroughly enjoyed sharing my heart with you join us again next time bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
