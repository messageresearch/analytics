TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen how many of you want to endend if Jesus terries you want to end both the Hebrew year and the fall and the Gregorian year on December 31st 2024 you want to end it by this testimony my feet did not slip I climbed some mountains this year I took some well I feel good I took some Spiritual Authority and my jurisdiction in the realm of the spirit was expanded Ed come on now and some devils had to get out of my way because I recognized who I was and who God was in me in that situation I'm not going to just beat the air and strike without an adversary it's like Chief Joseph said we as an Indian people have fought so many insignificant Wars among ourselves let me let me hear you that when the Real Enemy came that's me and you the white folks when the Real Enemy came we were so defeated our spirit so broken our resolve so smeared until we were defeated before the enemy had we not spent so much energy fighting the air but recognizing who the real enemy is it's not Church against church or preacher against preacher it's a child of God against the enemy of God because really he hates God and you get in the way between him and God so you become the target you know the reality is the devil knows that he may be able to sway the nominal Christian but he'll never be able to cause the bride to fail he knows that and yet he refuses to leave you alone and go to somebody else do you know why because he's a kleptomaniac he's a masochist he likes seeing your pain he knows he can't change your I'm going to preach now he knows he can't change your Eternal Destiny he can't change your election or your predestination or your destination
