[0:00] foreign
[0:06] just remember
[0:09] perfect love
[0:13] well we know what perfect love somebody
[0:14] said what is it it's Jesus
[0:17] it's father forgive them
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] for they know not what they do
[0:27] it's love without prejudice
[0:32] it's loving someone who is unlovable
[0:37] it's loving someone who plucks out your
[0:40] beard
[0:42] [Music]
[0:44] it's loving somebody who despitefully
[0:47] uses you and it's not that old phony
[0:50] love I love you anyway
[0:56] anybody ever had you that
[0:58] I love you all right but I'd sure like
[1:00] to fix you that's not love
[1:03] that's religion
[1:05] I've asked the Lord
[1:07] I want to love people like you love them
[1:10] and he's tested me a few times
[1:13] you heard me tell about going through
[1:16] some of my stuff and finding a gift that
[1:18] someone had given me that had later
[1:20] tried to destroy my life
[1:23] and I picked that gift up and I walked
[1:25] over to the trash can and I tossed it in
[1:27] and I thanked God to be rid of those
[1:29] people in my life
[1:31] thank God I don't have to deal with him
[1:33] anymore
[1:35] and he got me
[1:38] he said now you will go back
[1:41] and you'll take that out of the trash
[1:43] can
[1:44] [Music]
[1:45] and I went over there and I picked it up
[1:47] out of the dress can and if I would have
[1:49] dropped something I cared about it would
[1:51] have smashed to a thousand pieces
[1:54] but this thing was perfectly intact
[1:57] even though I
[2:01] had a little righteous indignation when
[2:03] I
[2:04] threw it away
[2:05] it was just perfect
[2:07] and I said Lord what must I do with this
[2:10] I don't even like it
[2:12] [Music]
[2:14] and all of a sudden it was like a movie
[2:16] on in my head I remembered how much I
[2:18] liked it when it was given to me
[2:21] now why didn't I like it now
[2:24] because I was prejudiced
[2:27] prejudiced anybody hear me
[2:30] I said what must I do with it I'm sure I
[2:32] can find a box for it
[2:34] after all it came out of a box I'm sure
[2:37] I can find a box for it and the Lord
[2:39] said um
[2:39] [Music]
[2:42] you will place it in a predominant spot
[2:46] on your desk
[2:48] [Music]
[2:49] and you will look at it every day
[2:53] until you can pray for them
[2:58] I would pray for them
[3:03] wasn't easy
[3:04] there were times I would look at it and
[3:07] I'd go right down on my knees with a
[3:08] burden for those people there were times
[3:10] I looked at it and I thought hmm
[3:15] I have church people who love me that
[3:18] need my prayers
[3:20] those people would never think of me
[3:23] praying for them why should I pray for
[3:25] them they'll never even think of me
[3:27] praying for why should I waste my time
[3:31] praying for them and the Lord to take
[3:34] you right it was like you started over
[3:36] okay
[3:38] you must really like looking at it
[3:43] I remember the day
[3:45] I remember what I had on
[3:47] I remember what I had for lunch
[3:50] the day I walked into my office and I
[3:52] saw that there and my compassion and my
[3:56] love for them was beyond me
[3:58] [Music]
[4:00] I fell down on my knees and I prayed and
[4:03] when I got through praying the Lord said
[4:05] now I had you to pray for them because
[4:07] nobody else
[4:10] [Music]
[4:14] I know this I know what it means to
[4:17] struggle with prejudice
[4:19] you see my problem is not racial
[4:21] [Music]
[4:22] that's not the kind of prejudice I'm
[4:24] talking about I'm talking about
[4:26] remembering or wrong
[4:30] [Music]
[4:31] till we can
[4:33] kind of
[4:35] birth explosion
[4:38] perfect love filling us
[4:42] we can pray for one another without
[4:44] prejudice look folks uh uh get him Lord
[4:48] is not a qualified prayer
[4:55] God is the one who decides how to draw
[4:59] it's up to you and I to let him fill our
[5:01] hearts with that perfect love I truly
[5:04] believe
[5:05] as brother Branham has told us it's
[5:07] going to take that perfect love
[5:09] to make the rapture
