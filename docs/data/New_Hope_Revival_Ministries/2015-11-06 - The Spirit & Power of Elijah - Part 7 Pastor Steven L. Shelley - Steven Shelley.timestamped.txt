[0:00] oh
[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] [Music]
[0:37] hi I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're
[0:39] watching the eagle cry I want to welcome
[0:42] you to the broadcast today and tell you
[0:44] that I appreciate you taking the time
[0:46] out of your busy schedule to hear what
[0:50] the Lord has placed on my heart for you
[0:52] today and uh I believe God will speak to
[0:55] you if you'll just open up your heart
[0:57] right now and allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:00] take this word and drive it down into
[1:02] your spirit man and you know what I've
[1:05] noticed is we always start out with a
[1:07] plan we have a subject and a series
[1:09] going but I've watched how so many times
[1:12] the Holy Spirit Will direct my thoughts
[1:15] and take me a little bit off the off of
[1:17] our plan and I believe it's because he's
[1:19] speaking to someone's need specifically
[1:22] you know we've been trained and in uh
[1:24] our ministry to if we have a question if
[1:27] we have something on our heart that we
[1:29] we just present that when we're in
[1:31] church we just present it before the
[1:33] Lord in faith and we've watched the Lord
[1:35] time and time again no matter who is
[1:37] preaching who was doing the teaching we
[1:40] watch the Lord just change the flow of
[1:43] the message and direct the words right
[1:45] to our heart you know God is so good he
[1:47] is so faithful he is mindful of your
[1:50] needs whatever they may be God already
[1:53] knows about them and I just encourage
[1:56] you to present them to him in faith
[1:58] believing that already heard you and you
[2:01] can have exactly what you need from the
[2:04] Lord in fact while we're talking about
[2:06] prayer and faith and the power of God's
[2:09] faithfulness in our lives I'd like to
[2:11] invite you to send us your prayer
[2:13] request all the contact information that
[2:16] you'll need is available on the screen
[2:19] and I would be more than happy to help
[2:21] you pray over your needs it's always a
[2:23] blessing when we hear from someone out
[2:26] there across the nations of the world
[2:28] who have watched the Eagles cry
[2:30] broadcast and been blessed that's why
[2:32] we're here we're not trying to build a
[2:35] Ministry for a man or a kingdom for men
[2:38] but what we're trying to do is just sew
[2:40] something into your life that would make
[2:42] a difference we are truly living in the
[2:44] end time and if we listen to the news
[2:47] around us we could get awful discouraged
[2:50] with the death and the terrorism and
[2:52] destruction that's going on every day
[2:55] it's almost like we go to bed at night
[2:57] we wake up the next morning and we dread
[2:59] connecting to the news because we know
[3:02] that somewhere something awful has
[3:05] happened but I have some good news for
[3:07] you and that is Jesus is Alive and Well
[3:11] oh yes they crucified him that's
[3:13] absolutely right and he shed his blood
[3:16] for my salvation for your salvation but
[3:20] the good news is that is good news but
[3:22] the really good news is he didn't stay
[3:25] dead you know he defied death and won
[3:29] the victory over the grave and uh okay
[3:32] there have been many good men who have
[3:34] lived in the history of the world men
[3:36] who spoke good things and spoke about
[3:39] peace and demonstrated charity and
[3:42] kindness there are other men who are
[3:45] adored and uh lifted up exonerated in
[3:48] other faiths but I want you to know that
[3:51] uh my God is a different story and my
[3:54] savior the Lord Jesus Christ he died all
[3:57] right and paid the price for you and I
[3:59] to be born of the spirit but he didn't
[4:01] stay in that grave on the third day he
[4:04] arose and he lives today he is eternal
[4:09] he's not going anywhere and whatever you
[4:11] have need of he is right there waiting
[4:14] for you to call he's as close to you
[4:17] right now as the mention of his name if
[4:20] you'll just call on him you know my
[4:22] grandmother taught me when I was a very
[4:24] small boy that I would say to her how do
[4:27] we know that the Lord still loves us you
[4:30] know I was a boy I was the product of a
[4:32] divorce I was an only child my mom and
[4:35] dad divorced when I was 5 years old and
[4:37] so I had a lot of insecurities about
[4:40] love love was something I wasn't so sure
[4:42] about and my granny was trying to speak
[4:44] to me on a child's level and she said I
[4:47] tell you what you do you just sit down
[4:49] and begin to say from the depth of your
[4:52] heart I love you Lord I love you Lord I
[4:56] love you Lord with all my heart I love
[4:58] you and I want to serve you and she said
[5:00] you just keep saying that and listening
[5:03] very very still and very very close and
[5:06] she said I can almost guarantee that
[5:09] before you finish you're going to at
[5:12] least feel in your spirit or hear in
[5:15] your inner being the Lord saying I love
[5:18] you too and that may sound absolutely
[5:21] silly and it may not be an autal voice
[5:23] that shakes the room but I have still
[5:26] practiced that and that was many years
[5:28] ago I find that if I tell him I don't
[5:31] hardly get to two or three times before
[5:33] I can feel him hear him in my spirit
[5:37] reassuring me of his love and concern
[5:40] maybe you're in a part of the world
[5:42] where things are really dark and you're
[5:45] believing God every day for your daily
[5:47] bread and it's easier perhaps for you to
[5:50] get discouraged but I want you to know
[5:52] that you're on Jesus's map he has not
[5:56] forgotten you he knows exactly where you
[5:58] are and what your needs are and as I'm
[6:01] speaking to you right now I feel like
[6:04] there's someone watching this program
[6:06] that you're carrying such a heavy burden
[6:09] not for yourself but for your loved ones
[6:12] and you see how steeped they are in
[6:15] false religion and for generations and
[6:19] God in his graciousness revealed himself
[6:22] to you and called you out of the
[6:24] darkness of false religion and lies and
[6:27] you have come to the Glorious gospel of
[6:29] Jesus Christ and yet your heart remains
[6:32] so heavy for your loved ones for your
[6:35] family that are that are left in that
[6:38] kind of a situation well I want you to
[6:40] know that I join my faith with yours
[6:43] right now and I pray in the mighty name
[6:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ that blinders
[6:49] will fall off of their eyes that their
[6:52] ears will be unstopped to hear the
[6:55] Glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ we read
[6:58] testimonies often around the world where
[7:01] the Lord is appearing to men and women
[7:03] in dreams in Visions in all kinds of
[7:07] various ways and revealing himself to
[7:10] them and most of these testimonies come
[7:14] from those who have other faiths who
[7:16] have other religions I've even heard of
[7:19] the Lord appearing like he did to to uh
[7:21] Saul on the road to Damascus and saying
[7:25] I am Jesus and I the one who has come to
[7:28] give you life what do you do with that
[7:30] when you've been taught your whole life
[7:32] that Jesus was just one of the prophets
[7:35] or not even a holy man at all and then
[7:38] he shows up and reveals himself to you
[7:41] well in that manner you have no choice
[7:43] but to surrender so I'm just going to
[7:45] agree with you that God will encounter
[7:48] your loved ones I don't know how and you
[7:50] know what it's not really up to you and
[7:52] I to tell God how to do it it's up to us
[7:55] to trust him when we pray believing that
[7:59] he will will do even exceedingly and
[8:02] abundantly that which we could even ask
[8:04] or think that's the promise of the
[8:06] scripture and I don't know about you but
[8:08] I'm resting in that I absolutely am now
[8:12] you let us know when you see God
[8:14] beginning to break through because we
[8:15] want to Rejoice with you we want to
[8:18] share the good news that Jesus still
[8:21] answers prayer and I believe he does we
[8:24] are in the middle of a series on the
[8:26] spirit and power of Elijah past present
[8:30] and future because we discover in the
[8:33] scriptures that the anointing that was
[8:35] on the life of Elijah the prophet was
[8:38] such an outstanding anointing with great
[8:42] characteristics and demonstrations of
[8:44] the power of God that God In His
[8:47] Infinite Wisdom said this is an
[8:49] anointing that's not just going to be
[8:52] needed once in the Earth but it's going
[8:54] to be needed a number of times we saw
[8:57] that repeated immediately in the life of
[9:01] Elisha who received a double portion of
[9:04] the power and the spirit that was on the
[9:07] Prophet Elijah we see in the scripture
[9:09] that also John the Baptist came
[9:11] fulfilling a portion of Malachi 4 5 and
[9:16] six and yet we believe that the spirit
[9:19] of Elijah returned again to finish up
[9:23] the leodan church Age Again turning the
[9:27] hearts of men and women back back to the
[9:29] original Faith back to the real absolute
[9:33] word of God we also believe that in this
[9:36] hour the world is nearing a time if
[9:39] we're not already there when it needs
[9:42] again the spirit and power of Elijah
[9:46] this time my prayer is that it will fall
[9:49] on a many membered body of believers who
[9:52] are sold out to the truth of God's word
[9:55] who are willing to be counted as those
[9:58] who are radical Changed by the power of
[10:01] God and who want to be Changers we we've
[10:04] been changed God has changed us now we
[10:07] want to help see change in other
[10:09] people's lives and then the scripture
[10:11] tells us there will be another
[10:13] installment of the spirit and power of
[10:15] Elijah during the Great Tribulation
[10:17] period the great wrath where two
[10:20] prophets will raise up and preach the
[10:23] Glorious truth from the streets of
[10:25] Jerusalem so each time this Spirit of
[10:28] Elijah has returned turn as was the
[10:30] promise Malachi 45 and 6 and he shall
[10:34] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[10:36] children and the Heart of the children
[10:38] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[10:42] the Earth with a curse now we've been
[10:44] studying on the past few broadcasts some
[10:47] of the characteristics or attributes of
[10:52] the Elijah Elijah the prophet of the
[10:55] scripture and in doing so it helps us to
[10:58] identify the attributes and
[11:00] characteristics of those who will be or
[11:03] who have been anointed by the spirit and
[11:07] power of Elijah number one we said he
[11:10] was a man of the Wilderness he
[11:13] understood the value of pulling aside
[11:15] into separation and hearing from the
[11:18] Lord number two we said that he preached
[11:20] without fear against the religious order
[11:23] and the spiritual Norm of his day
[11:26] remember that great confrontation on
[11:28] Mount Carmen where God showed himself
[11:31] powerful and stronger than the make
[11:34] believe God bael and then we talked
[11:37] about the fact that Elijah the prophet
[11:39] demonstrated the raw power of God he
[11:42] spoke into the heavens and the heavens
[11:44] sealed up and there was no rain for the
[11:47] space of three and a half years but when
[11:49] it was time in the mind of God for rain
[11:52] to come again who was it that loosed the
[11:54] heavens none other than Elijah the
[11:57] prophet and James 5 say 17 tells us that
[12:00] Elijah was a man with like passions with
[12:04] with similar emotions and a similar
[12:06] Constitution to all men and yet he had
[12:09] power with God to to supersede even the
[12:13] laws of nature for the glory of the
[12:16] kingdom of the father I love that I
[12:18] believe that's a powerful truth and I'm
[12:21] looking for a company of Believers to
[12:23] exercise that same kind of spirit and
[12:26] Power in the end time Lord help me to be
[12:29] be patient I know it's coming and then
[12:32] at the end of The Last Broadcast we
[12:33] talked about the fact that Elijah
[12:36] because he was a man of like passions as
[12:38] we are he experienced some unbelievable
[12:42] emotional swings he was up on the
[12:45] mountain spiritually one moment and down
[12:48] in the pits the next and this is
[12:50] something that we want to guard our
[12:52] hearts against it seems that when that
[12:54] Mighty power of God falls on us we feel
[12:58] almost invinci able because of the power
[13:00] and the anointing that is surging
[13:03] through our body but when that anointing
[13:05] leaves us then we're left to deal with
[13:08] our own issues perhaps the issues that
[13:11] we have carried our whole lives issues
[13:13] of rejection issues of of not having an
[13:17] Earthly father to be able to relate to
[13:19] maybe be an orphan Spirit or a spirit of
[13:22] poverty or whatever it is that you have
[13:25] dealt with in your life and perhaps not
[13:28] completely overcome come when that
[13:30] anointing lifts it's almost like those
[13:32] issues become magnified and we find
[13:35] Elijah sitting under the juniper tree
[13:37] praying to die feeling like he was the
[13:40] only one so guard your heart because if
[13:43] in that hour that God sends the spirit
[13:46] and power of Elijah on a on a many
[13:49] membered body if you're a part of that
[13:51] number you're going to want to be usable
[13:54] you're going to want to have all of your
[13:56] dissu issues dealt with and you're going
[13:59] to want to be ready to step up to serve
[14:02] the Lord in whatever capacity he's
[14:04] calling you to in other words this is
[14:07] the hour of preparation and if you're
[14:09] still dealing with those uh strong
[14:12] emotions that have a tendency to pull
[14:14] you into depression I want you to open
[14:16] up your heart and let the Lord bring
[14:18] healing I want you to turn loose of the
[14:20] pain do you know that the the Bible
[14:22] talks about offense and the Bible talks
[14:25] about pain and it appears that these
[14:28] things are inevitable
[14:29] Jesus Promised I tell you offenses will
[14:32] come but what we're finding out is that
[14:35] even though pain and offense and even
[14:39] sometimes rejection are inevitable
[14:41] experiences that we go through in life
[14:44] the suffering is optional in other words
[14:47] if we choose to continue to suffer
[14:50] because of those things that we've
[14:51] experienced it's because we keep giving
[14:54] them value we keep holding on to them as
[14:58] though they were the most important
[14:59] things for the present and for the
[15:01] future and I want you to know
[15:03] yesterday's gone and it will never be
[15:06] again and what I'm saying to you right
[15:09] now is not an attempt to uh delegitimize
[15:13] what you've gone through or to devalue
[15:16] your suffering or your pain or the
[15:18] experience of rejection I want you to
[15:21] know that was real it was raw and and
[15:24] it's it's true that it set you back okay
[15:27] perhaps it held you back back and and
[15:30] stunted your spiritual growth in some
[15:32] way but again that was yesterday you do
[15:35] not have to continue to suffer there is
[15:38] a healing bomb in Gilead he wants to
[15:42] apply his healing into that area of your
[15:45] heart you've just kind of got to reach
[15:48] out and and and hand it to him and say
[15:50] Lord here is my heart come in Heal Me
[15:54] soothe the pain and Deliver Me from the
[15:58] suffering that is not who you are and
[16:01] unfortunately what often happens is we
[16:04] become our pain and we find our identity
[16:08] in what we have suffered I want you to
[16:10] know that is not who you are if you're
[16:12] born again you are a child of the King
[16:15] of Kings and the Lord of lords one who
[16:18] overcame the world and also has given us
[16:22] power to overcome you do not have to
[16:25] remain crippled or handicapped
[16:28] spiritually mentally emotionally because
[16:31] of the suffering the pain of your past
[16:34] there is a solution in the Lord so
[16:36] Elijah experienced these real highs and
[16:40] real lows and from that we learn it
[16:43] would be vitally important for you and I
[16:45] to try to guard our heart against those
[16:48] true uh emotional swings watch out for
[16:53] depression depression and and oppression
[16:56] of of the enemy is a real t IC in this
[16:59] hour hopelessness is one of the things
[17:02] the enemy uses against the body hope
[17:04] deferred there's so many ways that Satan
[17:08] works against us in the realm of
[17:10] emotions right in the flesh and the soul
[17:13] but I want you to know that we have
[17:15] everything we need in the Lord Jesus if
[17:18] we're just willing to trust him you know
[17:21] sometimes especially men they they're
[17:23] not very in touch with their emotions
[17:25] they they think that's for women you
[17:27] know I I'm not going to to sit down and
[17:30] evaluate my own emotional health or
[17:32] mental health that that's for women to
[17:34] do and and sometimes we blame that on
[17:37] chemicals and hormones of the body but I
[17:40] want you to know that there are many
[17:41] many men of God many men around the
[17:44] world who also deal with with heaviness
[17:48] and depression and and you need the Holy
[17:51] Spirit to give you a lift hold on
[17:53] because he'll do it if you open up your
[17:56] life and allow him to one of the last
[17:59] powerful characteristics that we notice
[18:02] in the life of the Elijah the Elijah of
[18:05] the book of Kings is that he was called
[18:08] to oppose the spirit of Jezebel now that
[18:13] was an unbelievable challenge for Elijah
[18:16] the prophet and it wasn't always easy
[18:19] and he didn't always feel capable or
[18:23] adequate to handle that Spirit but I
[18:26] want you to know God used him anyway way
[18:29] to begin to expose that Spirit of
[18:32] manipulation and that Spirit of control
[18:35] and that Jezebel spirit is a spirit that
[18:39] operates every day in the church around
[18:43] the world no matter where you are that
[18:45] Spirit of control from from the enemy
[18:49] desires to the church it desires
[18:53] to paralyze the leadership it desires to
[18:56] put Pastors in a position where they
[18:59] have no uh confidence to be able to
[19:02] deliver a clear word from the Lord and
[19:04] you know that Spirit of Jezebel has to
[19:06] be dealt with so that the truth can come
[19:09] forth and the Bride of Jesus Christ can
[19:12] be transformed by the full unveiling of
[19:16] the character uh of the Lord Jesus
[19:18] Christ there's transformation coming and
[19:21] Satan doesn't want you to be transformed
[19:24] if you just kind of lay down and and
[19:27] give up well the enemy will leave you
[19:29] alone but if you're determined to keep
[19:31] pressing toward the kingdom of God and
[19:33] pressing toward your bridegroom the Lord
[19:36] Jesus Christ Satan is going to do
[19:39] anything and everything he can to hold
[19:42] you back let me remind you one more time
[19:44] greater is he that is in you than he
[19:47] that is in the world uh today the spirit
[19:50] of Jezebel exercises a major role in the
[19:55] power of evil over the nations of the
[19:57] world and so the spirit of Jezebel is
[20:00] not just trying to paralyze the church
[20:04] but the spirit of of uh domineering
[20:07] control this Jezebel spirit this is how
[20:10] we're identifying it in scripture
[20:13] because Jezebel was the queen and she
[20:16] was actually calling the shots she was
[20:19] pulling the strings in the nation doing
[20:22] it through Ahab her husband Ahab had the
[20:26] title of being The Sovereign of the
[20:28] nation to make decisions but really that
[20:32] Spirit of control and manipulation on
[20:34] his wife Jezebel was controlling him and
[20:38] therefore controlling the Nations the
[20:41] nation and I want you to know today that
[20:44] Spirit of Jezebel is alive in
[20:46] controlling the Nations keeping them
[20:48] away from God and causing them to make
[20:52] foolish decisions in the name of
[20:54] Tolerance that only jeopardize the
[20:57] safety and and future of their own
[21:00] Generations that has to be dealt with
[21:02] and that can't be dealt with only in the
[21:05] voting box that has to be dealt with in
[21:08] the realm of the spirit and so we need
[21:11] men and women anointed by God with the
[21:14] spirit and power of Elijah to deal with
[21:17] that Spirit of Jezebel that seeks to
[21:20] control the Nations under the Jezebel
[21:23] Spirits destructive and manipulative
[21:26] sway the governments in recent years
[21:29] have enacted laws and policies that tear
[21:33] away at the social moral and spiritual
[21:37] fiber of of any country I want to say
[21:40] our country also the United States of
[21:44] America but it's perhaps also going on
[21:47] in the country where you are right now
[21:50] one of the primary ways that that
[21:52] Jezebel spirit gains inroads to power
[21:56] and to control is by deceiving and
[22:00] corrupting legitimate leadership corrupt
[22:03] leaders cause their people to go estay
[22:07] as well so I want you to see this in the
[22:09] government and I also want you to see
[22:12] this in the leadership of the church if
[22:14] the Jezebel spirit can control the
[22:18] leaders of a Nation then she is able to
[22:22] give that nation and the control of that
[22:25] nation into the hands of the enemy and
[22:28] when when the enemy has the ability to
[22:31] control and influence a nation I tell
[22:34] you you'll see the most destructive
[22:36] things take place in that Nation we're
[22:39] seeing that in the United States of
[22:41] America as many of our leaders have
[22:44] become corrupt then we're dealing now
[22:46] with the consequences of that corruption
[22:49] what can we do about it well the biggest
[22:51] thing that we can do about it is pray I
[22:54] still believe prayer works now looking
[22:56] at that in the church we see that it is
[23:00] Satan's desire to arrest good Godly
[23:04] leadership if he can get a hold of men
[23:07] who have surrendered their lives to lead
[23:10] the body of Christ and cause them to go
[23:13] astray cause them to fall into moral sin
[23:17] cause them to to fall into the
[23:20] temptation of misusing or mis handling
[23:23] funds caused them to turn their backs on
[23:26] blatant sin that is going on in the body
[23:29] and refuse to address it from a Biblical
[23:32] standpoint that Spirit of Jezebel if she
[23:36] can accomplish any of those things in
[23:38] the leadership of the church then she
[23:40] gets a voice and anybody any body of
[23:44] Believers where Jezebel has a voice you
[23:47] can rest assure the word of the Lord
[23:50] thus saith the Lord is not being heard
[23:53] in the frequency and anointing that it
[23:56] needs to be so we've got to pray pray
[23:59] against the spirit of control the same
[24:02] kind of spirit that we see displayed in
[24:05] the life of Jezebel the Bible talks
[24:08] about it in First Kings chap 16 and
[24:11] verse 30 and Ahab the son of omry did
[24:15] evil in the sight of the Lord above all
[24:18] that were before him and it came to pass
[24:21] as if it had been a light thing for him
[24:24] to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son
[24:26] of nebat that he took to his wife
[24:29] Jezebel the daughter of ethbaal King of
[24:33] the zidonians and went and served bael
[24:36] and worshiped him and he reared up an
[24:39] altar for bael in the house of bael
[24:43] which he had built in Samaria this is
[24:45] the king of Israel building a temple to
[24:49] a false god in the land of promise in
[24:52] the land of Samaria and Ahab made a
[24:55] Grove that's a forest of trees and Ahab
[24:59] did more to provoke the Lord God of
[25:02] Israel to anger than all the kings of
[25:05] Israel that were before him and lot of
[25:09] that he was already walking in an evil
[25:12] path but when he married this Jezebel
[25:16] the evil that was in her just
[25:19] strengthened the evil that was in the
[25:21] life of Ahab we understand by reading
[25:25] the scriptures that Ahab was a man of
[25:27] weak character character oh God we need
[25:30] you to raise up men with true character
[25:34] who walk in true Integrity who serve you
[25:38] Lord in the beauty of Holiness and
[25:41] righteousness you know that's a prayer
[25:43] that we ought to pray together as
[25:46] Believers when we come back together the
[25:48] next time for the next broadcast we'll
[25:51] go a little bit farther into
[25:54] understanding how the spirit of Jezebel
[25:57] works today and what we can believe God
[26:00] for to deal with that spirit so that the
[26:03] move of God can take place in our
[26:06] nations in our churches and in our
[26:08] individual lives I want to pray for you
[26:11] right now that that that God will give
[26:13] you strength and courage to walk before
[26:16] him in integrity and in wholeness father
[26:20] I thank you for every believer every
[26:23] person watching this broadcast right now
[26:26] if they're not Believers I pray that
[26:28] they will call on you and find
[26:31] forgiveness and salvation right where
[26:34] they sit at this very moment Lord if
[26:37] Believers are also listening right now
[26:40] watching this program who need a real
[26:44] stirring up in their spirit I loose the
[26:47] anointing of God to go right now and
[26:49] stir up those lives and with their faith
[26:53] and my faith we agree together right now
[26:56] for strong leadership in our nation oh
[27:01] God in the nations of the world men who
[27:04] will lead us back to the god of the
[27:06] Bible men who will take a stand for the
[27:09] Lord Jesus Christ we pray against that
[27:12] Jezebel spirit that she will be exposed
[27:15] and that the the anointing of the holy
[27:18] spirit will break the churches free from
[27:22] manipulation from control of the enemy
[27:25] so that the precious word of God can go
[27:27] forth with power and demonstration we
[27:31] ask this in the mighty name of the Lord
