[0:00] the object friend of a believer
[0:03] the object of a believer
[0:06] is to become one hundred percent yielded
[0:09] to the Holy Spirit
[0:11] and as we come closer and closer to the
[0:14] coming of the Lord
[0:16] and we're laying off more of us more of
[0:19] us remember John said I must decrease so
[0:22] he can increase that ought to be a
[0:24] statement that we're constantly saying
[0:26] about our own selves I've got to
[0:29] decrease there has got to be less of me
[0:32] and more of him because when there's
[0:35] less of me and I'm depending more and
[0:38] more and more on the spirit of God that
[0:40] dwells in me then I am getting myself
[0:43] more and more ready for a translation
[0:47] these temporary raptures that we have
[0:51] like we had this morning as we were in
[0:53] worship and there was a high praise
[0:56] would go these are temporary raptures
[0:58] and then we come back down but we don't
[1:00] ever want to come back down to where we
[1:02] started
[1:05] we go up
[1:07] and we come back down
[1:09] but we're higher
[1:13] then God can speak to us on that level
[1:15] and we get in the next time and we press
[1:18] in and we praise and we let God deal
[1:20] with our heart and we Rapture again to
[1:22] maybe a higher level and then we come
[1:24] back down but by God's grace never to
[1:27] that level that we started out at
[1:29] because the spirit of God is taking us
[1:31] higher and higher this is where we we
[1:34] talk about uh we're going to speed up
[1:37] and they're going to slow down and we're
[1:39] going to meet in the middle the
[1:40] molecules of our body we're taking on
[1:43] another dimension in the spirit because
[1:46] this Earth is not going to hold us
[1:50] so we become more and more yielded to
[1:54] the Holy Spirit
[1:56] allowing him to be fully in us because
[2:01] we can do nothing of ourself because if
[2:05] if we try to do it of ourself that's
[2:08] what we get
[2:09] self
[2:11] exactly
[2:13] we end up with self
