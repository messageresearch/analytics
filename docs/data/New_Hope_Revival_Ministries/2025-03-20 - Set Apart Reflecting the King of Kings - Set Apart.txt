Description:
The daughters of Zion lost sight of their high calling—to shine forth the glory of the God of Israel, who parted seas and rained manna from heaven! He summoned them to mirror His heart, radiant in humility, not dimmed by Egypt’s pride—a people set apart, marked as His own. How it grieved Him when they chased shadows! Rise today—embrace His Word, reject the world’s lure, and step into your destiny. Born again, washed in Jesus’ blood, ablaze with His Spirit—live boldly, a beacon of His glory!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you see the daughters of Zion forgot who they were representing they weren't just representing their Soldier husbands but they were representing the god of Israel The God Who dwelt in Zion and so they were not just reflecting on their families or their parents or where they came from but they were actually reflecting on the god of History the god of Israel the God who brought his children out of Egypt The God Who fed him with Mana who fed them with Quail The God Who allowed water to come out of a rock when they were thirsty and when the water was bitter he made a way for the water to be sweet and when the ocean kept them back he opened up the sea and made a way for them to pass through that's a God who loved his people a God who was faithful to them and a God who wanted a people who would walk before him in humility in meekness in humbleness of heart both genders men who would not be so proud of their military might that they didn't give God credit for his strength and courage women who wouldn't be so proud of their beauty that they would uh pick up the ways of Egypt and the ways of the amalekites and the ways of the Canaanites because he wanted a separated people if God said I don't want your peas and your corn to grow in the same row he wanted even their Farm to be identified as belonging to a child of the king of kings Jehovah God and so if he cared about that so much that he even told them under that ceremonial law that your clothes could not be made of mixed fiber and there were all kinds of added Securities played on how they would dress and how they would live how they would worship how they would bring offerings unto the Lord it was a very organized and a very meticulous plan that God had created for his people how it must have grieved his heart when he saw them beginning to put on the bracelets and put on the anklets and put on the all of the different things the twistings of the hair and the ways that they would try to make them it's not that God wanted his women to be ugly it's not that God cared if the Israelite women uh were beautiful he he made them beautiful he just didn't want them taking on the appearance of the women of of heathenism the women of paganism the way the women of false religion he said they can be beautiful but they don't have to put on and Trust in changing of garments and and all of these mirrors and all the time do you know that even in Victorian days women use mirrors as part of their outfit and they used fans as part of of their outfit and they would walk around looking at themselves this is a spirit of Pride and God said I'm going to have a people and they're not going to be necessarily homeless they're going to be a beautiful people I'm going to beautify them with salvation they're going to walk differently they're going to talk differently they're going to dress differently they're going to definitely differentiate between the genders but I don't want them picking up too many of the habits of the other nations because if they do there's no stopping place it's the slippery slope and if it was only out there we could lock ourselves away in some little box somewhere but it's not just out there it'll creep right in among us if we don't make a stand and you ought to aim in the word if you have to follow it with an oh me is this the thing that matters the most no it doesn't matter the most what matters the most is are you born again are you washed in the blood of Jesus Christ baptized in his name Sanctified by the word filled with the Holy Ghost that is the main thing but there are other things that follow the main attraction and these are those things come out from among themen and be separate sayth the Lord
