TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello i'm pastor steven shelley and you're watching the eagles cry i want to welcome you to the broadcast today we've been studying for several weeks now the birth pangs of the messiah matthew chapter 24 verse 8 where the lord jesus tells us that all these things are the beginning of sorrows or the beginning of the labor pains the the pains of travail and we see these things happening in the world and it's easy to get discouraged when we look out at the condition of the world and the darkness that surrounds us but this is not a time for the bride of christ to be discouraged or defeated in fact it's a time for us to cling to him like we've never clinged to him before hold on to him refuse to turn him loose i know that he'll carry us safely through whatever happens in this world i'm sure of that i want to thank you for contacting our ministry new hope revival ministries in smith station alabama our address is on the screen our telephone number where you can call if there's no one there to take your call leave your name leave your prayer request if you'd like a call back leave your phone number and we'll try to get back with you we want to be a blessing to you but uh the easiest way probably to send your prayer request is by email you can find us on the world wide web at revival revival.org that's revival.org you can read read some of the information that we have on our website check out some of our resources and as i said send your prayer requests because we want to join with you in prayer i tell you i i still believe that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much i believe when two or three agree together as touching any one thing we have a promise that it will be given to us of our father we're not praying selfish prayers in this hour to uh to try to prosper in our own in our own plans and plots but we are praying prayers of faith believing for healing believing for provision believing for salvation and deliverance whatever we have need of in this hour i believe our father owns the cattle of a thousand hills i believe that he is the source instead of using the lord as our last reso resort i guess i should say we should come to him as our first resource because he has everything that we have need of in this hour we want to we want to uh sort of begin to draw our study to a close on the birth pangs of messiah as i mentioned a little bit earlier we've been doing a countdown counting backward the ten most important uh events signs birth pains of the coming of the lord we see these things all of these things growing in uh frequency and intensity as we get closer to his coming i want to just go over those those 10 things with you again because today we're going to talk about the number one sign of the nearness of the coming of the lord before we do i want to re-mention all of the others number 10 signs in the sun moon and stars scripture you can look at is luke 21 25 number nine violence upon the whole earth luke 17 26 and genesis 6 11. number eight famines pestilences and earthquakes matthew 24 verse 7 luke 21 verse 11. i wish we had time to re uh re-look at all of these but we've covered them well and you can find a way to access the other episodes on our website at revival.org number seven nations in distress with perplexity just people out of their heads with confusion about what's going on in the nations of the world number six false prophets and false teachers and there's certainly been an increase of that number five an increase of technology in the end time as prophesied by daniel in daniel chapter 12 and verse 4. number four nations aligning for prophetic fulfillment in psalm chapter 2 verse 1 and 3 one of the scriptures that we can look at you could look at revelation 9 verse 16. you could look at daniel chapter 2. uh there there are many other places ezekiel 38 39 etc and then the third is apostasy a the formation of a one world church look at revelation chapter 13 all the way through chapter 17 for more information about that number two the forming of a one-world government and a one-world economy which would include a one-world monetary system you say well that's not a reality today no it's not a reality as of yet but tremendous strides uh unbelievable steps are being taken right now to to bring us into that kind of a situation and then what we have to be concerned about is that one world government forming together coming together merging with that one world religious system because when you put the religious system and the political system together you're covering all your bases and that's when the antichrist is going to have full full power to do whatever he wants to do on the earth um i'm sure there are going to be limitations on that scriptural limitations and and and god is still god don't forget that but there's going to be a lot of serious things happening on this planet during the great wrath i believe that god is protecting his people in this hour he's going to see us through and i am one of those old-fashioned preachers that still believes in a resurrection rapture i just don't believe that resurrection rapture will take us out of here before there's going to be some pretty serious things happen on the earth they're happening now and again i want to continue to stress the fact that these birth pains these signs of the coming of the lord are increasing in frequency and in intensity we come now to the most important number one sign birth pain that helps us to know that we are nearing the coming of the lord and that number one sign is the nation of israel we we recognize and the church has recognized for years that israel is like the time peace of god specifically the city of jerusalem the prophets tell us throughout the scripture to watch jerusalem keep our eyes on israel and we will know the mind of god the mind of god will be revealed to us by watching the nation of israel the prophet zachariah one of my favorite prophets of the older covenant certainly gives us some indication of what things are going to look like in the end time concerning israel before we look at zechariah 12 let's mention first the miracle that there is a nation of israel let's think about the fact that a nation was born in a day fulfilling the words of the prophets of the old testament a nation was truly born in a day the jewish people were restored to their homeland now it hasn't been an easy process by any means there are many many nations many groups of people that would like to see israel and the jewish people driven into the sea in complete devastation and in utter announcement but i want you to know that the god of eternity has made an eternal covenant with the jewish people in the nation of israel it was god it wasn't the un it wasn't the president of the united states it wasn't the prime minister of of the united kingdom that established the nation of israel it was god who did it it was god's supernatural power that provided away after the scattering of the jewish people after the horrors of the holocaust god allowed his people to go home and what they found was a barren wasteland a desert with very little vegetation and very little hope for a future but god blessed those resilient jewish pioneers they hacked out a life in that desert land and now the scriptures have been fulfilled the nation the desert is blooming like a rose i've spent a tremendous amount of time in the past 10 years in the nation of israel and i love being there because every day before me i see prophecy fulfilled i've eaten the fruits of canaan i've tasted them with my own lips i know that god's word is true i've seen the desert blossom like a rose i know that modern the modern state of israel is a miracle and it is a prophetic sign that we're nearing the coming of the lord but zachariah begins to tell us what it's really going to look like at that time and let's look at zechariah chapter 12 we can look at the first few verses to get a pretty good picture the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundations of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burdened themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it i want you to know there's never been a time like this hour where we can see the beginning of the fulfillment of this prophecy of zachariah where all nations are coming against the nation of israel in one form or another uh it it can be as simple as calling for a boycott on all israeli uh imports uh into into particular nations i mean come on what's wrong with the nation that would refuse a shipment of hand lotion because it was made at the dead sea coming from the nation of israel something is seriously wrong there is a uh a prejudice and a jealousy against the nation of israel like we've never seen before and it can can start off that simple as boycott of products and it goes to the threats that are that are hurled every day in the media we want to see the jewish people driven into the sea we want to see the nation of israel so it's never going to stop with a two-state solution it's never going to stop with a road map for peace come on the scripture tells us that it's going to intensify not get better it's going to intensify until all nations form against israel against jerusalem zachariah has prophesied it and i tell you it's not a good idea so even though i know the scripture says it's coming i pray against it every day i pray that that america will not make that fatal mistake i pray for other nations that they will not make that fatal mistake but ultimately there is coming a time perhaps prayer is holding it back for now but there is coming a time when these verses of scripture will be reality and and let's not forget the rest of the story let's read down a little bit more let's look at verse 7 for instance in zechariah 12. the lord also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah in that day verse 8 here it goes hold on verse 8 in that day shall the lord the lord adonai defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all nations that come against jerusalem period final no room for discussion no room for uh compromise in this at all i will pour out upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his son in that day shall there be a great morning in jerusalem now this is uh talking about the recognition of the rejection of yeshua the lord jesus as the messiah this has not happened yet this is how we know that these scriptures have not been fulfilled yet because there has not been a repentance uh corporately for the rejection of yeshua as the messiah but god has not forgotten his covenant with the jewish people i've had the blessing of sending this eagles cry broadcast at different times over the past few years right into the nation of israel and we have seen god use it in a in a a wonderful way for for both a jew and for arab i've had contact from people living in ramallah as well as contact from jewish people living in in jerusalem and in some of the surrounding areas and i can't tell you how much i love all of the people who live in israel i want to see god send a revival to the arab nations of the world to the palestinian people i want to see god bring deliverance and hope and salvation please don't misunderstand or or judge what i'm saying as being prejudiced however i have a moral obligation and a spiritual responsibility to say what god said and god said i will destroy every nation that rises against jerusalem now i believe the jewish people have an unfailing right to the city of jerusalem i didn't say the christians i said the jewish people god didn't give the land of israel to the christian people he gave it to the jewish people if they're good enough to share it with the christian people then i think that's amazing but i want you to know that i have to say what god's word said and what is going on right now helps us we're not just talking about intifada we're talking about something bigger than that we're talking about a conspiracy in the league of nations against the nation of israel it seems that every other nation in the world is allowed without criticism to defend their own people and the rights to their land but if israel does the same things that other nations do she is emphatically condemned this is so unfair and to to speak against the jewish right to the land of israel is to speak against the scripture and the god of scripture so we better be careful how we do that i love some of the verses of scripture that talk about how what's going to unfold in the land of israel and the bible some of it can be very very serious remember that that one of the things that they're talking about now when they're condemning israel is we have to do this for the sake of peace we want peace peace peace well let me remind you what the bible said in the new testament in 1 thessalonians chapter 5 verse 3 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape so all of the road map for peace and the idea that that we're going to compromise for uh give land for peace and all of this kind of stuff that's going on right now that just enrages the nations and uh and and the allies of israel they want to say we can sort this out we can settle it well the bible said we won't be able to sort it out it's a bigger a bigger issue than what we realize it's a not just a political issue or an ethnic issue or a religious issue this is a god issue and what we see going on i guess what i what i need to summarize and say here is what we see going on with israel with the jewish people and with the nations that hate her is nothing in the world but the fulfillment of multiple prophetic scriptures in the bible it lets us know that we are getting closer and closer and closer to the coming of the lord uh the antichrist is going to to do some uh things he's going to have some influence even in uh in that nation in the nation of israel we we see that some things are going to unfold there but god ultimately is going to reveal himself to the jewish people and i believe what the scripture said don't let it be misunderstood the bible said all israel will be saved they're going to recognize according to daniel 12 they're going to recognize the scars in his hands they're going to mourn for him as as their own son read zechariah chapter 13 and zechariah chapter 14 as well to get a fuller picture of why we believe that the things that are happening around israel now are pointing us to the soon coming of the lord but before we go today let's look at daniel chapter 8 verse 25 speaking about this wicked one this man of sin it says and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand so we have some clear insight toward a final battle that's going to take place the forces of god are good and the forces of evil god's going to win the scripture is going to prevail the truth of god's word cannot it just doesn't lie and and it cannot fail and we can count on that uh we need to pray for the nation of israel uh we who know who the messiah is we who have hope in yeshua the lord jesus christ we have a responsibility and a privilege to pray for the jewish people and pray for the nation of israel the bible tells us if those who pray for israel those who who speak on her behalf those who stand up for her they're going to prosper if if your nation wants to survive in the end time there's a dividing taking place between sheep nations and goat nations and i believe that's determined by how a nation chooses to stand in agreement in covenant with what god has said concerning israel and the jewish people i do not believe in replacement theology let me slide that in here for the record i've spoken to you about it before that the church has replaced israel that the christian church has taken the place of of natural israel because of the rejection of the messiah again do you think that caught god by surprise are you trying to tell me that god didn't know what israel was going to do how she would not recognize for the most part who the messiah was that's not the god i serve nothing catches him by surprise he knew exactly how it was going to be in fact the scripture said according to the apostle paul he he blinded their eyes to prevent them from being able to see harden their heart according to romans chapter 11 so that you and i could have an opportunity so that all people would have an opportunity to see the messiah and to be grafted in god always had a plan all throughout the scripture for not only the household of israel but for the stranger among them you don't have to feel like a second-class citizen if you don't have natural jewish lineage because god has made provision the problem is the church has persecuted the jewish people down through the ages in the name of religion and uh the the prejudice and the hatred uh against the jewish people it it's it's it's heartbreaking if you do any research it's heartbreaking uh even the wicked heart of hitler was some of his ideas were rooted and and in in in the tenets of the christian faith what he had read from from leaders and and so uh i think we owe a debt uh the church at large owes a debt to the jewish people the way we can we can help repay that debt is to pray for the peace of jerusalem to pray for the nation of israel to stand with her if you can do anything to support her and help her then i think god is well pleased when we make that commitment so the miracle of the modern state of israel started i think it started a time period of the end i think we can say that when when israel uh formed as a nation again and the and the magan david the star of david flew again over the city of jerusalem i think we can say that the end times that that final end times scenario started unfolding and here we are today some 60 years later and i believe we can see with what's happening around the world concerning this miracle of israel helps us to know that we are swiftly approaching the consummation of the ages the end of all things the second coming of the messiah the lord jesus christ if you don't know him and the power of his resurrection if you've never tasted the sweet sweetness of his salvation come to him today repent of your your sins acknowledge that he is the savior he has paid the price for your salvation and your redemption invite him into your life if you are a believer and you are have grown cold in your spiritual walk i pray that god will set you on fire that your life will be radically stirred up again that you will seek revelation that only comes by the holy spirit from the word of god remember every revelation even dreams or visions or prophecies all of that has to be taken back to the absolute of the word of god to be judged we can't build our faith on something that is not scriptural everything has to come back and line up with the word of god i want to pray for you who have lost loved ones that you're concerned about i want to join my faith with yours that this will be the season of them coming to salvation let's pray together now before we go off the air father i thank you for the privilege of leading this prayer for every person who is watching this program right now i ask you lord to break forth with your salvation into the life of any person who is praying a sinner's prayer right now inviting you into their life i pray for the encouragement of every believer right now and we join together in hope for our lost loved ones we want to give you our whole being in this hour lord come and sit on the throne of our heart and rule and reign in our lives we ask this in the name of yeshua the messiah our lord jesus christ thank you for watching the eagles cry i hope you've been inspired by something that's been said today or in this series and i want to invite you to come back again next week and let's see what else the lord would have us to learn together god richly bless you thanks
