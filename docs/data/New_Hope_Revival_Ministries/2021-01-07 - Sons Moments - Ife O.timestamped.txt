[0:00] what god was really after was
[0:03] he was after sons
[0:14] he is going to have sons
[0:18] to fellowship with throughout
[0:21] all eternity god is not setting up a
[0:25] honeymoon only
[0:27] he's setting up a kingdom in a new
[0:30] heaven and a new earth that has no date
[0:34] it has no expiration date upon it
[0:37] it won't be just a thousand years that's
[0:40] the honeymoon
[0:41] that leads to the eternity
[0:45] a thousand years is still measured in
[0:47] time
[0:48] and that's not what we're working toward
[0:51] we're not working toward a millennial
[0:53] honeymoon
[0:54] we're moving toward and launching forth
[0:57] toward an
[0:59] eternity in
[1:02] fellowship with a sovereign god
[1:06] he didn't want to dwell eternally in a
[1:09] tent
[1:10] he wanted to dwell temporarily
[1:13] in a tent he wanted to dwell
[1:16] temporarily in a temple made by the
[1:19] hands of
[1:20] men solomon's temple
[1:23] herod's remodeled temple it goes on
[1:27] but god's ultimate purpose was not to
[1:30] live
[1:31] under badger skins in a dusty old tent
[1:35] in the wilderness somewhere what god was
[1:38] really after was he was after
[1:42] sons hallelujah
[1:46] what about daughters sons
[1:49] that's not leaving out the female
[1:52] that's pulling her all the way in
[1:56] to god's economy when we talk about his
[2:00] bride
[2:00] his bride his sons they're the same body
[2:05] these are different relationships that
[2:09] we have in the natural
[2:11] to help us understand the greatest
[2:14] relationship of them all
[2:16] our spiritual fellowship our spiritual
[2:19] relationship
[2:20] with the sovereign god he wanted to live
[2:24] in sons once made of flesh
[2:28] like we say so often the son of god
[2:32] became a son of man that we
[2:36] the fallen sons of men might become
[2:41] the sons of god
