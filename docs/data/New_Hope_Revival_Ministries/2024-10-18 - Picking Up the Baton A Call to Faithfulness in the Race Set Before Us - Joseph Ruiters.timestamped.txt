[0:01] let me tell you now the baptism of the
[0:03] Holy Ghost is your key
[0:08] yes that is your key
[0:11] sir Pastor Sally we were speaking about
[0:14] this
[0:16] race here's the
[0:19] problem that's why I want this
[0:21] generation to
[0:22] understand along the way we've dropped
[0:25] the Batton we have let the Batton fall
[0:30] we don't know our history we don't know
[0:34] our
[0:37] heritage we've started to
[0:41] compromise we've started to find a
[0:45] Gateway and alternative
[0:47] way you see in this in the in this race
[0:50] that we were talking about you cannot
[0:53] change the rules or the
[0:57] objective the rule has been set for you
[1:04] yes you cannot
[1:06] change because this is how I believe and
[1:09] this is how it's going to be there's
[1:11] only one solid solid there's only one
[1:16] one solid and this is the word of
[1:19] [Applause]
[1:22] God not half of it not this and that you
[1:27] either take the fullness or you believe
[1:32] it because the problem is in a relay
[1:36] race if you've dro the Batton yes you've
[1:40] got only three Alternatives come on you
[1:44] either stop or discontinue yes if the
[1:48] Batton has been
[1:51] dropped you stop the race you
[1:55] discontinue some of us still think we
[1:59] can run
[2:00] huh uh without some of us think there's
[2:05] a way to the to the Finish Line if
[2:09] you've dropped the battle come on you
[2:12] will be
[2:14] disqualified even if you have completed
[2:18] the race yes yes your last alternative
[2:21] is go
[2:24] back go
[2:27] back go back and pick up that
[2:32] b there's no other way no the same place
[2:37] where you faulted that's why you correct
[2:40] [Music]
[2:42] it don't just walk on and wish somebody
[2:47] is going to overlook
[2:53] it you you fix it where it was broken
[2:57] that's
[2:58] right some of
[3:00] us wants to change the Baton John speaks
[3:06] about the swer and the
[3:11] reaper shall rejoice together
[3:16] together do you think do you
[3:20] think if I've
[3:23] planted Tomato's year and I are
[3:28] harvesting am year that the reaper will
[3:32] be happy with
[3:34] me he will not be
[3:38] happy because the
[3:40] swer and the
[3:43] reaper needs to be
[3:49] United they need to become one right and
[3:52] here's the
[3:53] thing this is how we how you finish this
[3:56] race if you've not proved faith
[4:00] in that which belongs to
[4:03] another who will give you that which is
[4:06] your
[4:07] own
[4:09] amen you see the condition here is being
[4:13] faithful the condition is being
[4:17] faithful true to the original the same
[4:21] way that you've received
[4:23] it not
[4:25] compromise not
[4:27] chains not reposition
[4:30] come on not re
[4:34] reconstructed the same way that you've
[4:36] received
[4:38] it that is being faithful
