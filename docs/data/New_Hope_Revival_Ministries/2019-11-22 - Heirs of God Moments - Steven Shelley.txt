TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you have every right to claim the same portion that has been allotted of the Father to Jesus Christ you have every right to claim the same portion that has been allotted of the father to Jesus Christ you are not only joint heirs but you have the same promise that he had and the same life and if we have the same promise and the same life we should believe for the same power everything Christ inherited from the eternal spirit of the Father we are entitled to that by election and by his precious blood price it is ours the scripture said it's yours heirs of God join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together amen and did you know that according to the New Testament I suffered with him before I was ever born because Paul said I was crucified with him and if you made it to the crucifixion in the mind of God you made it through the suffering in the mind of God and if you made it through the crucifixion in the mind of God you made it through the resurrection in the mind of God as we are gathered here in his name with truth and under truth we are seated here together and heavenly places in Christ Jesus that is not a location that is a revelation not a location or a proximity that is a revelation amen so in the midst of your chunk in the midst of your hell am i permitted to say that in the midst of all of that we are seated because of truth we are sated together with Christ in heavenly places heirs of God joint heirs with Jesus Christ [Music]
