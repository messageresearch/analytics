TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again today in partnership with gospel channel and I'm delighted to be able to come and share with you the good Word of God I am very excited about all of the prayer requests that have been coming in I've been praying over them personally we've been lifting up the folder in front of the congregation and praying and then in our Thursday morning prayer meetings we've had several people to come and lay hands on the folder your needs are being carried before the throne of grace and I'm especially excited about the testimonies people are beginning to call and send emails and say hey the Lord heard and answered prayer I don't know why it is but sometimes we pray and we pray and we believe and then when God answers the prayer it almost shocks us it almost surprises us but we should never be surprised that God answers prayer the Bible says that the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much and I believe that it is a gift that God has given us I believe prayer is not only a gift it's also a responsibility that we should take seriously and I want to assure you that at New Hope revival ministries we take your needs seriously we just feel extremely blessed that you have confidence in us enough that you would call and share sometimes you're a very personal request and I'm delighted that God has allowed us to have an opportunity to stand with you in faith today we are in part to our teaching today will be part two in the demonic doorways series the last time that we were together in this series there have been a couple of other programs with guests but when we were together for part 1 we were talking about something that is I think somewhat controversial in the body of Christ and that is generational curses or generational cycles patterns that appear generationally in a family line we talked about some of the reasons why that we see these patterns repeating in families we understand that some of it is because of the influence the atmosphere that is built in one generation and that influences the next generation and therefore the tendencies to relieve stress or to forget it all whether it be with alcohol or drugs or illicit sexuality pornography whatever the means is it seems that what is patterned what the example is in one generation often becomes the habits of the next generation we also talked about the fact that you know Satan is sneaky and he is sly and I believe that he observes from from the outside he observes these kinds of atmospheres that are created and I believe that he even assigns demonic spirits to watch over the next generation and the next to set up circumstances and situations that would cause that next generation to have a predisposition a tendency to follow in the same path that their fathers and grandfathers followed in I'm concerned about the iniquity that is involved and in order to explain to you what I mean I'm going to have to go a little deeper in the scripture than what I had originally prepared to do when we were together the last time in fact I thought it might not even be necessary but I have spent some time in thought and I have spent some time in prayer and I think that it would be helpful for you and I to have a teaching a lesson together on the different words that are used in English from the Hebrew in the Old Testament that we sort of put in a big category the category of sin but the Bible talks about sin iniquity and transgression and I believe that it is iniquity that is easily carried over from one generation to the next I believe that we have a choice and the problem is that many people don't realize they have a choice and when that iniquity of the fathers begins to come and influence the next generation it just becomes the habit it becomes the normal Oh have mercy Lord what has become normal in our society today ways that people forget about it all so to speak and we talked about that when we were together last time you know even Christians who are not under the influence of a cycle of iniquity we still have stress we have anxiety we have situations that drive us to desperation but thanks be to God we have the Bible way we have the the God way to deal with these kinds of things and I'm not going to say that no Christian ever has the temptation to fall back into you know I'll just get drunk and forget about it all or I'll just go out and and party and forget about it all because the temptation may be there but the wonderful promise of the scripture is that to the believer with every temptation our God gives a way of escape and I generally find that the way to escape temptation is to bring our minds back to what is true what is virtuous what is holy what is pure and of course above it all that is the Word of God so we could never emphasize enough the importance or the value that we have found in the Word of God it is so valuable in every face of life and in every circumstance of life and I know that it may be too many it's just an antiquated book of stories but truly friend to the believer the Word of God is life the Word of God is both spirit and it is life and when we fall into that mode of being tempted and we have to rise up above it or else we would yield to it what value what power we can find by using the word of God to help us bring our focus to bring our thoughts back to what is good and what is right and what is holy and many people don't realize that what is happening in their life is a part of a cycle that's older than they are and I really believe that we can have a tremendous effect on that cycle I believe that once we understand that the enemy is setting up this generational trap that just continues to pass from generation to generation once we realize that we can discover there's a way to break that cycle thanks be to God there's a way to slam the door in the face of the demonic and say wait a minute trick is not going to work anymore because there's somebody on the inside of me who's leading me and guiding me the Bible tells us when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will lead us and guide us into all truth and once the Spirit of Truth has come he leads us to the tools to the strategies to the weapons if you will that we can use against the enemy and the Word of God becomes that crushing hammer that can destroy every generational cycle every generational curse if you will that the enemy tries to continue to use to propagate it from one generation to the next now let me let me take you to the scriptures here and understand that this might get slightly technical for a few moments but I believe it will be of great benefit to you if you will give it a listen and hear what the scripture is saying about these different words that are translated from the Hebrew to the English all under the umbrella of sin I think we should start in Exodus chapter 34 verse 6 and 7 and this is one of the verses or one of the portions that we used in in episode 1 and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and in truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the generation upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation let me read that verse again keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and the fourth generation now notice the scripture didn't say the sin would be visited and it didn't say that the that the transgression of the fathers would be visited but instead it says that the iniquity of the father's would be visited upon the children and upon the children's children even to the third and the fourth generation so we can tell by that one verse another example and I feel like it might help to know there more than one in Daniel chapter 9 verse 24 the scripture said seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins so we've got two already and to make reconciliation for iniquity there is the third and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy and this is another subject much bigger than we have time to to dig into today but this prophecy of Daniel and his seventy weeks is something that we can lay out over history from the time of the prophecy all the way up until the hour that we're living in right now and it will take us even to the very end of time as we know it this was a very powerful prophecy and in the in the introduction of Daniels prophecy we find all three English words that we have mentioned thus far both sin and transgression and iniquity all three and in the Hebrew these words though similar also have different and distinct meanings I think I want to to mention it that way because some people will say when they read the scripture over here in in Ezekiel they will say wait a minute I believe Izzi kiyul is saying there's nothing to this generational cycle or generational curse and they will often feel like the whole thing is disqualified in one chapter of the Bible one prophecy from Ezekiel even though it's mentioned in other places in the scripture and I think I want to just read this to you right now and then we will go back and talk about these three words sin transgression and iniquity in Ezekiel chapter 18 verses 1 through 4 the word of the Lord came to me again saying what do you mean when you use the proverb concerning the land of Israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge as I live says the Lord God you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel behold all souls are mine the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine so when some people hear that they say wait a minute then that that proverb is is cancelled but you see that doesn't do away with the scriptures that specifically say that the iniquity will be visited doesn't say the sin or the transgression it says the iniquity will be visited upon the 3rd and the 4th generation now if you take Ezekiel 18 I told you we'd get just a little bit technical here and you go down to verse 20 through 22 let's get those read the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the Father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live and in other words the prophet Ezekiel was dealing with a completely different situation altogether he found that the people were actually using the proverb and what they might have understood from the from the scripture as an excuse to to say well you know I I don't have a lot of choice here my father was involved in besan thus and thus and so it's very it's very common and expected that I should be involved in the same people were beginning to sort of use that as an excuse and I don't think that any of us would struggle too hard to imagine how easy that would be because I hear people doing it even today I hear people saying you know I could live a better life I could I could live a cleaner life or I could be closer to the Lord if my husband was a Christian or if I had a better job or if I had a better living circumstance you know and and so really using excuse some people say if I would have had a better upbringing I would be a better Christian today and so this is the kind of attitude that the prophet Ezekiel was dealing with don't you let these proverbs become excuses for not dealing with your own issue with your own sin your own iniquity and your own transgression Ezekiel did say you are not going to pay before God you're not going to answer before God for the transgression or for the iniquity of your father his his transgression his sin his iniquity he's going to answer for and at the end of your life you're going to answer for your your sin your transgression your iniquity and at the end of your children's life so I love the fact that we have such balance in the scripture and that's why we can't build an entire doctrine on one phrase of one verse of scripture book but what a picture we get when we take the time to pull all of these scriptures together and we begin to see something very beautiful in fact the prophet Ezekiel finishes up as we just read if by saying all his transgression that he had committed they shall not be mentioned unto him this is to the person who repents this is to the person who recognizes wait a minute I am responsible I'm not blaming my father I am responsible for my choices I am responsible for what I have chosen to do even though I knew that it was not good or it was not according to God's Word and once I repent of that then I'm not going to be held responsible even for my own sin my own transgression there's power in the blood of Jesus Christ there's power in coming to him with repentance and asking for him to take his precious life-giving blood and wash away your sin your transgression your iniquity and then you're free you're justified just if I'd never sinned it's completely wiped away of course we need the grace of God and the strength to obey so that we don't go and fall right back into the trap that we came out of but righteousness works the same way he said these things are not going to be mentioned to him again in his righteousness that he hath done shall he live so his lifestyle is transformed from one of of sin transgression and iniquity to a lifestyle of of doing what is right what is righteous and even when we try our hardest to do what is righteous the scripture tells us we will often fall short and that is why he gives us if we fellowship with him in faith if we obey His Word to the best of our strengths and ability he dresses us with the garments of salvation he clothes us with the robe of his righteousness and when he sees us he sees us through the blood of the Lamb and he sees the robe of righteousness that he has placed on our back and we stand upright and justified in the sight of God so it I don't think it's it's a good idea to take this Ezekiel and then disqualify all of the other things I've read some articles where where people have mentioned the other scriptures and then they say but of course it's all finished and cancelled and Ezekiel tells us there's nothing to it I don't think that is what Ezekiel was prophesying at all I think he was trying to bring the balance and tell the people you can no longer use your forefathers as an excuse to make the same dumb choices okay to make the same stupid decisions you've got to answer for yourselves and I think that's very good advice the other argument that sometimes Christians will bring up against this concept of generational curse or generational cycles or cycles of iniquity patterns of iniquity is they'll say well the blood of Jesus just canceled all of that and once you are a Christian then there's no more influence of of your forefathers and well that would be like saying that because you are a Christian the devil has no more influence over you and he can no longer make your way hard and he can no longer touch your circumstances and we know as Christians this is just not the same just not the truth we have the power we have the authority over the enemy but he is allowed by permission to make our way hard because God is using the enemy as a tool in his hand to bring his true children to their place of completion and perfection and when you begin to view your enemy that way as a tool in the hand of God then you spend less time focusing on what the enemy is doing and you spend more time focusing on the grace that God is extending to help you get out of the trap or the snare that Satan is setting for you so I think we've covered a couple of the of the big arguments and and I don't want to debate with anyone about whether this is true you could never change my mind I've lived long enough now that I have watched the enemy take advantage of the third and the fourth generation you know I'm 50 years old and I'm old enough now that I've seen the the same traps that tormented the great grandparents I've seen how that can absolutely pass down and become such a trap and such a trick and such a temptation and I know there's victory I know that we can absolutely crush the cycle and that's why I have chosen to to tackle a subject that can be controversial and and in some ways confusing but by the response that we've already received from episode 1 I believe there are more people out there who connect with this concept they may not be able to to ground it theologically they may not be able to you know to give us chapter and verse and use homiletics and hermeneutics to explain why it's happened in their life but but they're smart enough to know that that the enemy doesn't just go over in the corner and lay down and play dead and and he looks at a family and he says hey this worked for grandpa this is how I was able to ruin his life and sometimes grandpa died in ruin and so I think the enemy says you know I won't have to work so hard to go after the son it works so well with Grandpa I'll just I'll just go after the son with the same thing but what the enemy is not counting on is you hearing truth the enemy doesn't want you to hear truth because if you become equipped with the truth of God's Word you can say like we mentioned in the last broadcast you can say hey wait a minute no enough is enough it stops here and I believe that's why we're coming to you today again is to give you the strength the encouragement that you need to depend on the Lord I can't break this for you but I know the one who can and I can give you some simple tools and you know it's not a magic formula I've got to pray the right thing I've got to hold my mouth the right way while I'm praying I've gotta bow my head at the right angle and make sure that my fingertips touch let me tell you something that's religion and religion rather than helping you become free in truth religion will try to bind you and hold you back in the same cycles that you struggled with for years you just call on the Lord for mercy and if all you can get out is in the name of Jesus Christ by the blood of the Lamb I this cycle over my family and I start right here with this generation with my generation and I say this cannot go any farther to my children or my children's children and then equip your family if you can equip them to understand that the enemy is gonna try he's gonna be sly and he's gonna bring out the same tricks that he is used in your life but be transparent and let the Lord lead you to to help your children to help your grandchildren so that they don't have to suffer perhaps the way that you have suffered now I want to look at in the time that we have left I want to look at these words and see if we can get some definitions of the way these words are translated in the English that will help us I think every one of us know that sin is anything that comes short of the glory of God the Bible tells us in Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God so anything in our lives that causes us to come short of the glory of God would could be defined biblically as sin we believe that the true sin the only real sin is unbelief and unbelief in every form will keep you an eye from reaching the mark of the glory of God we will fall short every time and this word appears in so many in so many places let me give you one more verse that talks about all three I want to do a good job here Leviticus 16 21 and Aaron shall lay both of his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him this this is speaking about that service that takes place in Tabernacles time where in in the fall feast where the the sins of the people are symbolically transferred onto the head of the scapegoat and he is driven into the wilderness notice the language here that Aaron shall lay both of his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions even all their sins there's all three words again and in my notes I referenced the fact that all three words have their own Hebrew number in Strong's Concordance meaning that although they are similar in the fact that they all cause us to come short of the glory of God iniquity is coming short of the glory of God transgression is coming short of the glory of God and so is sin but there's enough difference in those words in the original language that we can learn a little bit of a lesson so why don't we look at these scriptures and and kind of have this understanding that sin iniquity and transgression are similar but different in some way in fact I think it could be said that they all three represent increasing levels of falling short of the glory of God so maybe they even represent different levels of a falling short maybe one if we are caught up in one of the aspects one of those dimensions we might even we might even be in worse shape it might even be harder for us to break through but but remember this the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus the sacrifice that he made for you and and really all you need is truth and that's the Word of God and you need the Spirit the Holy Spirit of God to lead you and how to use the truth and once the Spirit of God reveals to us how to use the truth I just want you to know there's not a curse there's not a cycle there is no sin iniquity transgression on and on and on there is noting that the blood of Jesus cannot take care of but we have to learn to use the blood to appropriate the blood we have to exercise the authority that we have been given to use the blood of Jesus Christ the Word of God as we talked to you many times and the precious name that God has given to us okay so sin is anything that comes short of the glory of God what you might remember about sin is that the Greek word that is translated to us in English in the New Testament as in a sin is actually a term for archery for drawing back the bow and releasing the arrow toward the target and so you may have heard the Greek definition that we have in the New Testament more often than than any Old Testament concept or Hebrew concept and that is the definition of New Testament of sin in the New Testament is missing the mark now I'm telling you I've missed the mark a time or two in fact it's possible to miss the mark in the course of every day of your life where you start out to accomplish something I'm gonna go all day long without letting my thoughts go in a certain direction I'm going to choose my words all day long to edify and glorify and build up you you may have other some other goal in mind but you just want to reflect the love and character of Jesus Christ and then you get in traffic and you lose your cool are you getting you get into a situation in a business on your job with your coworker and and you're just I mean I hope you're not going berserk but but you're just kind of falling short you realize hey wait a minute my emotions are going in a direction that I purpose they would not go in my thoughts are following and my words are coming pretty close you know things begin to come out of my my that I really didn't wanna I didn't want to speak death I really wanted to speak life and so even in the life of a believer that that very basic understanding of sin is something that we all deal with drawing back the bow aiming you know looking very close to try to to make sure that we sin the arrow right to the bull's eye but somewhere along the way that arrow can miss the target it can it can be a small defect in the in the arrow itself it can be in the in them in the way that you've drawn back maybe you you jerked a little bit at the last minute there's so many things I don't know all that much about archery but there are so many variables that could cause you to release the arrow thinking fully intending to send it to the bull's eye but somehow it gets out of the way it doesn't make it it misses the mark and this is this is a really good basic definition and understanding of the word sin slipping away from where you should be airing from the path on which God has put you not achieving a standard that God has set missing the mark or the path it's like a trail and and you know if if you're following the markings of a trail in the forest and it's easy to miss to miss one of the landmarks to miss one of the little signs and if you're not careful you may make some steps off of the trail and you could even find yourself in a dangerous situation because you missed the mark because you missed the marker and you stepped off the trail thanks be to God for the grace that he has given me in my life so many times hundreds of times thousands of times maybe tens of thousands of times hundreds of thousands of times when I missed a when I when I was not walking carefully looking carefully enough when I drew back the bow thinking that I was absolutely gonna nail the bullseye and somehow I missed a little bit and I say oh Jesus have mercy on me help me Lord to do better the next time and he does that's what it means to walk in relationship with God never taking advantage of grace this is not willfully sinning that's transgression that's another definition altogether it's another category all together but but setting out to do what is right and finding myself not quite making the target he has been so good and so faithful to me and I believe that every child of God watching this program could say hey man yes brothers Shelley he has been so good to me and so that Greek understanding of the word sin missing the mark or an act of disobedience to the Lord this this concept and this word sin is something that's not too deep seeded unless it is linked with an iniquity and we'll talk about that in a moment we could almost look at it as though sin is on top of the surface of the skin it's not something that goes deep down like iniquity and like a transgression one theological definition of the word sin the voluntary departure of a moral agent from a known rule of rectitude or duty prescribed by God any voluntary transgression of the divine law or violation of a divine command now the way that that definition reads it speaks more of them of making a conscious choice to sin and when you begin to do that when when missing the target becomes the norm when you are aware that you keep repeating this thing over and over again it becomes a willful choice then it takes you to another level and that would be of course the level of transgression sin is either an action in which a known or divine a known divine law is violated or it is the voluntary neglect to obey a positive divine command or a rule of duty clearly implied in such a command sin consists not of actions only but neglect of known Duty all evil thoughts purposes words desires whatever is contrary to God's commands are laws so we understand there's a difference in in sense of commission things that we do and there are sins of omission things that we neglect things that we fail to do there are sins of ignorance the Bible talks about it Leviticus 4 chapter chapter 4 verse 13 begins to give an order of what we should do when someone has come who has sinned through ignorance and the thing be hid from the eyes of the Assembly and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord Leviticus 4:2 if a soul shall sim through ignorance against any of the commandments so the Bible talks about a sin of ignorance not not even realizing what you're doing but the Bible also talks about doing it willfully and knowing full well what you're doing I want to talk about this word iniquity in in contrast or in comparison to the word sin because the scripture specifically mentions the word iniquity when it talks about that which is carried over from one generation to another and so the word iniquity in Hebrew is a word that means to bend or to twist or to distort so iniquities are a bending or a twisting or a distorting of the law or God's Word to different degrees all worthy of punishment of course Exodus 34 17 mentions iniquity and guilt in the same sentence as God says he is forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin this word transgression is a word that means a willful act of disobedience it is a transgression done specifically to spite or in the face of God and I'm afraid that if if we don't deal with those cycles of iniquity then our sin becomes influenced our missing the mark becomes influenced by the iniquity of our forefathers and when we choose to go in that direction the direction that we are bent toward you see that's what these generational cycles and patterns and curses do is they cause the next generation to be distorted to be bent toward something as though that were the norm as though that were the right way and what we have to do is we have to believe that once we recognize how the enemy is working then we're making better choices it's not always easy but we have the grace of God to make better willful choices and especially when we can look back and see the destruction that alcoholism or the destruction that lust and pornography have had in in our family members lives that in itself gives us a little bit of strength to make a better choice but I'm telling you there's only one thing that will give us the total strength that we need to make better choices and that is to surrender to the truth of God's Word to be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ to be filled with the precious power of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost comes to empower us to make better choices the Holy Ghost comes to to help us to recognize things like what we're talking about today so that we can make better choices another verse that mentions all three is psalm 32 and verse five I acknowledged my sin to you this is the psalmist in prayer I did not cover my iniquity I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the iniquity of my sin the psalmist is saying I just laid it all out before the Lord I mentioned the Lord to the Lord my sin I acknowledged every time that I had missed the mark and I did not cover my iniquity I was confessing to the Lord the psalmist is saying the way that I had been bent the direction that I had been bent in that's what the iniquity is about and he said I confess my transgressions to the Lord the times the transgression is the times that I yielded to how I had been bent instead of allowing the grace of God to give me the strength to stand up rightly before him I have to be honest with you and tell you that in my Christian life I know there were times that I allowed myself I yielded myself to the way the enemy was trying to bend to me to the direction that he was trying to bend me thanks be to God when I began to recognize what was going on that I was beginning to make choices based on how I had been bent instead of choices based on the truth of God's Word I went before the Lord in full confession and in full disclosure you must never be afraid to come before the Lord your maker your Creator the lover of your soul and make full disclosure this is what the psalmist was saying I acknowledged my sin I did not cover my iniquity and I confess my transgressions to the Lord and you can always be assured that there is forgiveness of sin if you will walk in this truth that God is trying to make a real in your heart and in your life and it's a journey it's a journey you might you might say boy I really struggle well well here's the thing I've often heard this expression and I believe it's encouraging I may not be what I ought to be I may not yet be what I want to be but I can thank God that I am no longer what I used to be if that's the only testimony you can have today maybe you just are so discouraged with yourself because you keep yielding to the way the enemy has bent your life the circumstances again some of which have been visited on your generation by the iniquity of a prior generation especially the iniquity that was never confessed that was never dealt with sin and transgression that was never made right before God that that kind of sin that kind of iniquity and transgression has more potency and more power to affect the next generation and that's why you must recognize that you've got to be one of the ones who says enough is enough I can't afford to live the rest of my life yielding to the way the enemy has bent me the influences the predispositions can I say even the excuses that I've used because of my hard life there have been times and I'm saying myself to be transparent but I want you to know I'm speaking about you in your life as well because our circumstances are not all the same but I can tell you that even in my life I've been serving the Lord since I was a small child I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old so the majority of my life has been a one of trying to please God and trying to walk in what was right but I I'm not going to pretend that I haven't failed to the Lord and and and he still loves me this is what's so wonderful he still loves me and he has given me the strength and I can say that I'm a whole lot closer to where I want to be then I used to be but I'm not where I want to be I know there is more the more I yield myself to him the more I come into that place of Union and intimacy relationship with them I know there's more of God that needs to be expressed in my life but I'm on the journey and I encourage you to stay the course I encourage you that when you become aware of the fact that you just made a quick decision not based on the Word of God not based on what is right but based on what is convenient because of the way you've been bent the way you've been influenced there's a lot of this that is being proven today scientifically to be genetic code to have to have the circumstances of a prior generation and what they have yielded to to be written in genetic code to affect your DNA this is now becoming you know you know for many years we were told by science that we would live our whole life with the brain that we were born with and with the genetic code in DNA that we were born with but we're now learning scientifically what the Bible has said all along there is no part of you that can't be transformed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ even your DNA can be healed even your genetic code can be rewritten by the blood of Jesus Christ even the the desires that you have that you don't want to have God can replace those by feeding on His Word and learning to use his word as your weapon you can absolutely mold yourself bend yourself by grace with his help believe me I know it's not something we do by ourselves but we can bend ourselves right right back straight just like the Word of God says we do that by his gift by His grace by asking him by pleading with him and when I say pleading I don't mean begging I mean petitioning him faithfully Lord I believe your word and I believe you can deal with every bit of what the enemy is trying to do I've watched how some of this stuff can work how perversion this is now becoming a scientific fact that perversion in one generation can absolutely bend change the DNA the RNA structure of the flesh it can affect the beliefs in the attitudes it can make genetic changes that are passed down from generation to generation so there's only one solution to remedy that to bring that back into God's order and that's by what we've been talking about by going God's Way we there is so much research now that says things like high blood pressure alcoholism sexual perversions jealousy anger fear are passed down from generation to generation racism greed even idolatry have having a tendency to run in families why because this is a trap that the enemy wants to put your family in but there's victory it signifies not merely that which is wrong when we talk about a generational cycle or a generational curse we're not just talking about something that is wrong but the tendency to do wrong even the tendency the preference to do wrong a predisposition to do wrong it's easily passed down a perversion of truth can affect our intent our will it can affect Oh a lot of things about who we are in our life and that's why we need to break that cord of iniquity that the enemy would try to bind us with he wants to bind you with the past he wants to keep you walking on the same road that others have walked before you oh no there's another way there's a highway there's the King's way and I believe God is giving victory I believe there are many of you that are about to take your future into your hand in the name of Jesus I'm not talking about humanism I'm not talking about the power of positive thinking I'm talking about waking up one day and realizing I don't have to lay down and play dead while the devil destroys my home my family my children my grandchildren I can stand up and take authority over the enemy the Bible talks about so many scriptures here that we won't be able to get to in the time that we have left but we'll have one more lesson on this and we'll start bringing some clarity I hope and I want to talk to you about the opposite you know if the enemy can influence our generations with iniquity with with thought processes and ideas perversions and addictions I find that whatever the enemy perverts there there's a great truth in there somewhere that can be a great blessing and a great benefit and I found many references in scripture to what we could call the generational blessing if there can be a generational curse there can be a generational blessing and we have rights to claim that and maybe you don't have any any you know your your elders your ancestors maybe they didn't serve the Lord maybe you're the first generation Christian in your life well then you say brother Shelly how is how is a generational blessing going to affect me I'll tell you what it can affect you by affecting your children by you saying wait a minute I've turned this thing around by the truth of God's Word and I'm calling for my children and my grandchildren to begin to be blessed to receive the benefit of my obedience to the Lord we have every right to claim our loved ones to present them before the Lord and say Lord as you have done for me I believe you to do the same for my children and grandchildren does that take away their free will does that mean they don't have a choice does that mean this becomes automatic it doesn't mean any of that but what it does mean is that the favor of the Lord through your obedience can release an atmosphere over their life that they can't get away they cannot get away from the truth that there is a way out of sin and transgression and iniquity we can we can start making a difference even by the words that we speak I'm absolutely 100% sure of that I think we'll pray our time is gone and when we meet again we'll bring some of this together I'm even going to to make a longer list with you of certain things that we have noticed through the years travel easily through generations and there therefore if you recognize some of that in your own family line you would I would encourage you and hope that you would bring that before the Lord maybe everything on the list if necessary and say O God I repent for my generation for myself or my for my influence over my family I repent and I believe that you will give grace and favor and deliverance that I can be free and so that I can help the next generation and the next generation to be free Lord knows we need somebody to stand up for truth your family needs somebody your nation needs somebody to stand up for truth father where would we be Lord without your word and without your help o God we would be lost and we would care and we wouldn't even know it we would be on our way to a devil's hell but we want to thank you today for the truth of the gospel the good news of Jesus Christ we want to thank you today that it is the power of God unto salvation and we want to thank you that you have given us a remedy a cure for sin transgression and iniquity lord I thank you right now for for this this attitude that that I believe is gripping people's hearts to be proactive to come before you and begin to lay these things out before you by saying no father I repent for my own for my own influence over my family and I intend to do everything I know to do to break that cycle that it would not be passed down to my children and grandchildren we want to see freedom we want to see household salvation and you promised in your word that we could believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved and our house it was given to the jailer this promise we reach up and take a hold of that because we also believe Lord that you love us and it is your desire to help our family members Lord I pray for a stirring for a revival in families that are represented by those watching this program today and I want to thank you again for the gospel channel Lord may all of their needs be met may they go forth continuing to make this opportunity available that the truth go forward and that it make a difference in people's lives we pray for freedom and we pray for health to be released in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Yeshua our Messiah well I got a little excited and I've been moving around and rocking back and forth I hope I didn't bother you too bad I believe the Lord is helping us and I hope you'll tune in again next time god bless you [Music] [Applause] you
