is on the way if it hadn't come yet it's on the way and so we just have the faith of Abraham and we call it done we we don't we don't speak by what we see we we speak and confess by what we know well that was unplanned man didn't plan that but the Holy Spirit did and if I was a part of a church that the Holy Spirit couldn't move in I'd find me another church I'm so thankful I'm so thankful I'm so thankful I'm so [Applause] thankful you may be seated just a moment what a week this has been there's been so many things most of them good but there has also been tragedy and so we have a family to pray for today we didn't mention it in the prayer request I thought I might just direct you to the app where brother Robert has written about something that has taken place in the life of of Tiffany's husband and of course it affects them all and we want to pray for that family we especially want to pray for Josh SS and for the entire family that God will help them it's a difficult time for them but God is with us if we trust him if we put our hope in him he's with us in the good and the bad and you know you can't blame a God that you don't believe in and so we really need to pray that God will use this tender moment he'll use brother Robert and sister Teresa to minister to that family we have seen God move this week not only one new life given to us but two new lives given to us and God was real in both of them and we welcome both both of those new babies they are as fresh as they can be one six days and one today would be three days and uh born Friday so this would be two days Saturday Sunday right two days and I know what the doctors would say we didn't ask them there's no safer place to be than in the presence of the Lord I could feel us all cringed just a little bit when the spirit of the Lord moved on Jenna because we know that she's had surgery but you know we're just we just believe I just said Lord she's in your hands there wouldn't be anything we could do to stop her now and so she's just in your hands and you'll just have to continue the healing process both of these mothers are are extremely unusual anyway and they're strong women and we thank God for them we were literally sitting in we heard that Friday morning that Liz was having some contractions and she was convinced on Tuesday night that it was all Braxton Hicks along the way but there must have been a little something else going on because the Midwife only made it by did they tell me 29 minutes is that right can anybody confirm say it again the Midwife was there 29 minutes before she was needed and my wife who was supposed to be there and to bring tally I think they were what were you 11 minutes they they got their 11 minutes before the baby was born and from my understanding this might be too much information for some of you delicate people but from what I understand it was one long push and she was here and so two days later she's in the house of God and we're so thankful there there is a whole story behind what has happened for Benjamin and Jenna but it's really their story and when the time is right of course some of you are hearing it from them and that's the best way to hear it but at some point we will we'll tell you a little bit about it because there's a there's a part of the story that that doesn't just belong to them and we'll share it with all of you I'm just so thankful for a group of people who who really believe they don't just say they believe they believe and we thank you for your prayers we're blessed with wonderful anointed music and we want to thank these musicians for their service to the Lord [Applause] today we're going to try to uh pull this together now and continue the service we greet all of you who are streaming the service whether it's on YouTube our website our ministry app or whether you're streaming on Facebook and I'm just looking at YouTube this morning and we're being greeted from all over God bless every one of you God bless you in Mammoth Springs brother Merl my old friend God bless the brother Gosman and his wife in Indiana and brother and sister Ryder in South Africa and here's someone who has written and said all the way from Winnipeg Canada and we can certainly say that our home is filled with the same presence God bless you richly that's our prayer the reason why that touches me so is we have prayed Lord let your same presence visit those who can only join us by stream and I truly believe that if you create an atmosphere where the spirit of the Lord is welcome he comes like that whether it's listening in on the telephone or whether it's watching a video or whether it's hearing the prophet on a tape sometimes I'm hearing brother brandom preach and I am thinking oh I wish I could see I wish I could see him I wish I could see what's going on when he would say that lady there in the third row that light is over I want to see her but that's not possible but we're thankful today for the technology that we have amen would you stand again and let's go to the word and um we're just blessed to be able to do that today is a special day because we get to dedicate a handsome little boy back to the Lord a miracle another miracle and we're so thankful brother Austin came in the office just after me meeting him and he told me he said God showed me he's going to give me a son and and they're holding that son in their arms today and sister Anna went through so much in her first pregnancy that of course there was extra concern but God was with her every step of the way and today they have come to give little Isaiah River back to the Lord because they know that's where life comes from and he's in their hands and we wanted this to be about the gift that God has given to them and uh we're just going to celebrate with them at the end of this service I'm so glad that brother and sister Miller could come they've made a great sacrifice to be here for to be in church but also to be at the dedication of their little grandon they have flown in in the wee hours of the morning driven all the way home what time did you did you hit opala 2:30 and what time do you leave Atlanta 7:30 tonight that's that's pretty good isn't it you have to you have to be Daniel and Anna Miller to pull that off most of us couldn't do it but they're not built like most of us and we're very thankful for that it comes in handy doesn't it would you turn in your Bibles this morning to well it's noon now to Romans chapter 8 and we were there Tuesday night and I'd like to go back back there for for just a few moments I don't want to step on anybody's toes but I just want to remind you today these are familiar quotations that we'll use and familiar scriptures but I just want to remind you that it's a necessity for real Christians to forget their feelings it's not that we don't have feelings but as real Believers it is necessary that we lay our feelings aside and we take God at his word we have to do that in crisis we have to do that in good times we have to do that in mediocre times and we particularly have to do it in difficult times because life is a strain and it's stressful fear is the enemy of Faith yes and it's easy for all of us to walk in fear but as true believers we have to put fear aside sometimes we have to drive it out sometimes we have to talk talk to it and tell it to go so that faith can come and take its place because you're given a Measure of Faith it's never that you don't have enough Faith as a Believer brother brandom settled that in the stat family it's not that you didn't have enough Faith to heal that little child but it's that God saw your great faith and he chose to carry out his divine plan knowing that you would continue to love him and serve him him and praise him let me remind you before I read the scripture that God is either Sovereign or he is not sovereign and if we walk away from any situation and say if if there would have been another doctor if there would have been another medicine if there would have been another procedure if we walk away with that kind of a declaration we're not moving in faith we're moving in feelings because if God is Sovereign the right man will show show up at the right time to do whatever needs to be done and we're not looking to man anyway we're looking to God we know that he has ultimately all the power I read all 23 verses to you on Tuesday night so I'm going to do my best not to do that but just show us verse one so that everyone will remember the context of Romans chapter 8 I'll read a few verses and let you have your seat and we'll move on there is therefore now now no I want to hear you say no no there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus if there's any condemnation over your life you can rest assured God didn't place it there he may convict you he may certainly cause you to feel conviction and to surrender more of your life to him but he does not condemn his own if you're in this word and this word is in you there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's the mark of a True Believer why do you say that because John's gospel says it as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you know God's leading the believer may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated God is leading the believer sometimes we don't even know we're being led we just feel a tug or a pull or an urge and it is the spirit of the Lord within us directing us and leading us whether we're aware of it or not I believe the more aware we become of the leadership of the spirit in our life the more successful we'll be as Christians in the last days he this he promised he would never leave us and he would never forsake us would you show us verse three for what the law could not do and when he says law he's referring to the instruction of the Old Testament particularly the first five books of the Bible or what we call the Torah and uh you remember that this is the Apostle Paul who is speaking a Pharisee among Pharisees one who so learned the law of Moses that he had committed as a Pharisee he had committed a great portion of all five books to memory and it was particularly necessary in second temple period time that as a Pharisee he would have to recite the Book of Leviticus from memory now I want you to know that's a big thing because a lot of us can't even read in the Book of Leviticus but he had to commit it to memory because he had committed himself to the law so for a Pharisee among Pharisees to speak to this little believing church and say to them for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son and he didn't send his own son in flesh that was was Angelic he sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh now we closed on Tuesday night with with one of these quotations in in the sermon whyatt had to be Shepherd I just want to reread that one paragraph to you as we move on he had started a new creation he's referring to God what was it a creation of himself help me now God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that that being the word made flesh you know what God is when you see Christ I tell you you think that is just common Christianity 101 but I'm tell telling you it comes by only by Revelation because many will say yes of course Jesus is a is one of the persons or the second person in the godhead and they try to so compartmentalize God cut him up in little pieces that they have no real revelation of who he is so we thank God for the Revelation that when we have seen Christ we have looked into the face of the father Jesus says it himself he said when you've seen me you've seen the father now what about the paraclete what about the Holy Ghost he said I will not leave you comfortless in one place he said I'll send you another comforter but in another place he said I I Jesus talking to his disciples I will come to you now how did Jesus come to the disciples we're we're drawing very close to the biblical Feast of chavot we only have a little while to go and uh maybe you were Disturbed that I didn't mention Pentecost Sunday because the church gets you know quite excited around the world about Pentecost Sunday well I'd get excited about it too if it was at the right time but we understand that that shav doesn't come on the Gregorian calendar it comes on a Hebrew calendar which was God's calendar so we're going to commemorate soon the the Feast of chavot which is now called Pentecost and when he came into that upper room that wasn't another person that was the same God he said I will come to you so they were not filled with a substitute they were not filled with a proxy they were filled with the very same God who had spoke to them in a fleshly body because that's Same Spirit and here is the promise if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken make alive resurrect your mortal body now you want someone to behave you want someone to to to always be able to to push down what they feel bubbling up inside some of my friends are preaching very hard these days against what they call a Revival of emotion well I cannot help help to remember that over and over and over again the prophet tells us if there's no emotion in your religion it's already dead that's he it's only good for one thing and that's to be buried yes sir I don't think I could hold steady if I didn't have something that on some occasion I could feel it now we're not living by feelings but we're not minimalizing their presence in our life no I've told you many times Church through the years that people have said to me in dire times in their life in a funeral situation they have said now you know when we are in church we're not we're we're just we we don't act like everybody because we're not emotional people we're just not emotional people well I want you to know when they got in a situation that was unpleasant and when they begin to experience grief or lost guess what happened they became extremely emotion extreme emotion driven extremely emotional and I've even been in places where where someone had to be slapped I'm just thankful I wasn't the one that had to do it they had to be slapped to bring them down out of hysterics and I remembered them telling me through the years I'm not an emotional person let me tell you something we're all given emotions we learn to control them and that's a very good thing but when the spirit of God begins to move in your life the very life of Jesus Christ begins to Bubble Up The Apostle called it anastasis in Greek which means a a a resurrection that is reproducible when our Lord raised from the dead he raised with a resurrection that can be reproduced in the life of the believer so aren't you glad today we can celebrate because the s o n this isn't the rising of a of a Greek god uh we call it Sunday this isn't the celebration of a Roman God we're here today to celebrate the s o n amen the very life of Jesus Christ that has fallen on the believer he goes on to tell us in demonology he said in paragraph 199 if I could think of how that Jes Jesus when he died he went and preached to the souls that were in prison he died a sinner Jesus died a sinner knowing no sin right yet our sin was on him and God listen for his sins sent him to hell that was a good idea for God but a bad idea for the devil was wasn't it the Bible said he went and preached to the souls we ended Tuesday night by talking about the fact that he descended Into the Heart of the earth and he led captivity captive and those which had slept in the faith they also raised from the dead and appeared to many and that's because the gospel was presented to them in flesh form in body form we should say and they received him as their Messiah and we know there's coming a day that National Israel is going to recognize who he is and they're going to inquire about the scars in his hands and he's going to say without condemnation these are the scars that I received in the household of my friends of my brethren but the Bible tells us all Israel true Israel will be saved so said that's hard for me to Fathom that's because the resurrected Christ hasn't come to you perhaps in body form and said I'm the one but to them he will come that way aren't you glad you can be counted among those who haven't seen him with their eyes but they believe him in their heart of Faith blessed are the eyes that have not seen and still believe how about squeezing out an amen amen in in chapter 8 verse 6 and 8 it says for to be carnally minded is is what is death you can be alive and be dead we sometimes refer to them as The Walking Dead they're not zombies of course but they're moving around in a physical body but death has already struck them from within the prophet talks about souls in prison now there are people walking around Among Us who who are already in a prison house that sounds hopeless except for the fact that God has sent a Word of Deliverance for those who are in the prison house and the word of the Lord fell on the prophet he takes his hands he looks down at his little puny arms and he says there I'm no match for these bars but the Word of Deliverance that was in his mouth screamed out House of Hell give way in the name of je woo give way in the name of Jesus Christ and there came a shaking just like in the days of the Apostles in this experience and the bars fell to the side and those prisoners began to run out and brother Brandon began to recognize some of them as they as they ran past him in Deliverance I'm holding on to that I'm believing that in the very last of the last days there are still some today held in a prison house they've been taken captive like prisoners of War taken hostage by the enemy but I believe that the power and the authority of the spoken word is in the bride and I believe one day by the unction of the Lord we'll call some of those out of their bondage and see them come to full Deliverance if that doesn't excite you something's wrong because you've got family I've got family that seem to be locked in a prison who no matter what you say no matter what they hear no matter what happens they can't seem to surrender but you know what there's coming a day like sister Hatty rght sons that a spirit of conviction will fall on them and some will run I know that some will run to the altar so to be carnally minded is death to live in your feelings is death but to be spiritually minded is not just life which we would call the opposite of death but it's also peace if this word peace were in the Old Testament it would be Shalom and Shalom doesn't just mean peace does it it's a completion it's a fullness I want you to know there's a peace that Jesus has that's not just the absence of turmoil come on now it's not just the absence of a problem but he said the peace that I give to you how many of you know that he taught us that it abides forever it seems to pass all human understanding and it never leaves us if you've ever experienced that peace when you needed him let me see your hand as a testimony he comes and in that moment that you found it hard to come to peace it's because you are letting your feelings Rule and in that moment no one can do it for you brother no one can control your feelings and emotions but you it is our resp responsibility to take a hold of those things when we recognize them pulling us away from the word when we feel those things pulling us away from Faith it's our responsibility to take them captive to arrest them to submit them ain't that what he said casting down all imagination and taking captive every thought that's contrary to truth how many of you have had to do it how many of you had to do it before you got here today maybe who knows who knows but because the carnal mind verse 7 is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so if you're living under some kind of of carnal mentality there's no way to bring your body your flesh into subjection to the word it's only by a spiritual mind that you're going to be able to push down the Flesh and cause it to bow to the sovereignty of Jesus Christ so then they that are flesh verse eight so then they that are in the flesh cannot cannot no matter who you are if you're living after the Flesh and the carnality of life you cannot please God I'd like to show you another translation don't be a offended I'm doing this just to help you grab the concept for the Mind Set On the flesh is death but the Mind Set On the spirit is life and peace you think I'd let the devil come in and steal my Holy Ghost no because it's his spirit in me that gives me life and peace verse seven because the mind set on the flesh is now I I know that's how most people say hostile but that's not how I say it because hostile doesn't sound big enough I say very very HiFi I say hostile I want you to see how big it is the the he said the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile toward God did you know that means it makes itself an enemy when you're living in your carnal thoughts your thoughts become an enemy to God we've got to do something about it for it does not subject itself to the law of God for it is not even able to do so so for you and I to think that we can push down the urges of the flesh by mind over matter or by thinking a better thought we must know that it's impossible to do that it's only to those who have received the Holy Spirit of God into their life who yield on his leadership and who obey what he compels them to do it's only those individuals who have the power to bring their flesh into subjection to the word it's not by will it's by the spirit it's not by might or power it's by the spirit that we win the victory do you believe that and verse 8 says and those who are in the flesh cannot please God so know this if you're not operating in the spirit you're not pleasing God if you still live on the gerbal wheel of religion thinking that you have to perform a certain way to have the favor of God you've missed Redemption this grace is not a license to sin this forgiveness is not something that causes us to do whatever we want to to to live any way we want to live and still call oursel the children of God this Grace actually moves us out of that realm and the grace of God helps push down the urge of the Flesh and bring it into subjection because the scripture tells us if we live in the urges of the flesh we cannot somebody say cannot please God are you with me good proof of the Resurrection paragraph 134 he said isn't that just the modern Christian today oh let the healing take place and they're shouting the victory let the power of the Holy Spirit fall and they're shouting the Victory and those who are really filled with the Holy Ghost remains that way sir down through life's journey so some people like to take a little quar or two of brother brandham and where he talks about the those who are emotional and those who are uh you know have a tendency toward the Spirit uh that they also often have the tendency to backbite and they often have the tendency to uh to you know hurt one another and harm one another and they're prone to all there's no doubt in my mind that is certainly a truth but don't miss everything he said you can only understand a quotation by looking at it in the light of all the other things and you've got to understand that it's possible and if you're going to live the spiritual life then then you're going to have to yield yourself to him entirely he said isn't that just the modern Christian today oh let the healing take place I want to go back they're shouting the victory let the power of the Holy Spirit fall they're shout and those who are really filled with re the those excuse me those who are really filled with the Holy Ghost remains that way what way what way shouting the victory what way shouting the victory what way those who are really filled with the Holy Ghost remain that way shouting the victory down through life's journey so so we sing in the good times praise His name in The Bad Times do the same let everything that hath breath prise praise the Lord so if you're able to yield yourself to that Holy Spirit and let him give you power to pull down the flesh you do not have to be ashamed for having the victory brother Brandon found out one time in his life that he just simply didn't have enough Victory what he said he said it and when he yielded to the Holy Spirit he found himself doing what they were doing dancing in the victory it's not about a dance oh no don't think that it's about being able to remain Rock Steady when the wind blows against you what brother Cade was singing when the water the boat he said had already started taking on water can you imagine and he thought for sure he was going to drown but in the last moment hallelujah what happened the one who controls the winds and the waves was there amen now let's move on to the next part of that he said but the man that that's still walking with a carnal mind let a little discouragement come up now I know that none of you have ever dealt with any discouragement but I have and I know what that feels like and if anybody happens to have experienced that you know what it feels like you let a little discouragement come up something go wrong and they go away saying well I thought it was all right but oh my look at it now I thought that little church would never fail I thought this person you got your mind hello you've got your mind on the the wrong thing so really Church it doesn't matter who fails around you who lets you down you got to keep trucking on for the one that saved you the one that redeemed you the one that filled you with this Spirit he said put your mind on him that can't fa fail let your conversation not be about your church we're talking to you too I'm want to add here forgive me your conversation is not about your pastor your conversation is about how you're Lord about what he's done in your life he said that's the one not about your neighbor but about your Lord let your conversation be there's only one way that you can keep your conversation of him or about him and that's to keep your thoughts on him let's look at 8 n and 10 we're just taking it verse by verse as we move on so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you does any body have that abiding spirit in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his this Holy Spirit in your life is not optional it's mandatory to complete the new birth it's not just an issue of blood or an issue of water it takes life for there to be a birth and we're reminded of that this week it takes all three for there to be a birth and that spirit is the life part yes you've got to be baptized yes you've got to find a place of repentance yes you've got to be washed in the water of the word and cleansed by the blood but that doesn't complete the new birth it's only when the Holy Ghost comes to live inside of you that the new birth is completed I wish you'd help me that means if you're sitting here today and you don't know whether or not you've received the fullness of the spirit you need to check up on that and you need to begin to ask him Lord fill me and if you feel like it's leaked out it hasn't but if you feel like it has you just come and say refill me the prophet said there's one filling and many refilling aren't you glad we ought to want one every day we ought to want to experience that every day of our life so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit and if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his next verse and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin that's good news now I want you to know sometime the flesh will try to raise itself up want it but the spirit of God can beat that down if we allow it that's where the Apostle talks about crucifying the flesh daily somebody said if you're already dead why do you have to crucify the flesh because it has this unusual ability to pull itself back together and attack you in your faith and if you don't stay on the job you'll find yourself going in the way of the flesh but if we stay vigilant and in the spirit we know that we can defeat the thoughts of the flesh we can have control over our own body we can possess our vessels in sanctification if you believe that let's say Amen brother brandham tells us in the in uh let's go on if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness the uncertain sound he said and yet the man somewhere down in him somewhere in him if he could only let that little as I Illustrated it like a button I want you to really listen to this one I just think about it like some little button or something on the inside of you when a man is saved that much of him that little button that much of him is God I want you to see it just a little button that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make him quit doing what's wrong now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out it didn't say the little light would do it for you it said you you're taking it out if you can take take it out if you can call it out and force it to be subject to the truth did you know you have power to take jealousy you can choose not to be jealous somebody said I've tried year after year after year and I'm just not able to control it let me tell you something you can make an active choice and when you feel that thing rising up he will when you feel that thing rising up you call it out immediately you there's no room in you I I don't want you to grow in me I want the button to grow I want that little button of light I want that little life of God that's in me to grow look look listen to what he says if you can take the malice and the envy and the strife and the unbelief out that little button like of the light and power of God will do what growing growing growing growing come on growing so you start out with a little button and the more of the old stuff that you shove out of your life and every time you're faithful you got to be vigilant you've got to be faithful to take it down every time did you know yielding to that stuff one time can pull you right out of the will of God it can place a bitterness within you and that bitterness you know it seems like it it normally takes years and years for bitterness to grow but we're living in such an accelerated hour that by entertaining those negative thoughts we can find nearly overnight that a bitterness has taken hold and what's wrong with bitterness is we start seeing everything around us from the filter of bitterness and we get matter and matter and matter and matter we get more jealous and more jealous and more jealous and the next thing you know we start cutting ourselves off from the people who love us the most we start cutting ourselves off from the church that is there to help us from our leaders that are there to help us so we isolate ourselves into a depression where if we could recognize who we are and what Authority we have over our own life I can't take jealousy out of your life but I can deal with it in mine come on a husband can't help his wife I mean you can certainly talk to her and love her and support her but in the end you can't cut that root of of jealousy or bitterness out of her heart she's the only one that can make up her mind I'm just not going to let it bother me you may not be like me but I have to talk to myself pretty often because as a minister if you let bitterness grow in your heart you'll have no compassion for the very people you're called to serve so I have to be extra vigilant and I have to remember that even somebody causes you some stress and strain you can't let a resentment come oh I know it's quiet I know after a holy ghost explosion this can be as dull as Nails I get it but somebody's got to come and Report the truth so that's what I'm trying to do today we are emotional people whether we recognize it or not and it's not someone else else's responsibility you you can raise your children right and talk to them about everything but only they can deal with what's growing in the as they begin to grow and mature so if we get some of that other stuff unpacked and driven out of our Lives we make room that that light and power of God that starts in us like a button it will keep growing growing growing growing and this is what's so powerful as it grows it crowds out any form of unbelief and unbelief is what keeps us it's what keeps us in carnality so if we can shove the unbelief out by letting the life of God grow in it he said and you don't do it by exhortations you can preach till you're blue in the face you can talk to somebody till you're you're tired of talking you you you can't do it by bodily exercise you do it by a sanctified oh my you know that's an outlawed word in the modern Church to live a Sanctified life consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you he said I caught some of it in a place where not long ago somewhere he was either in in a location or in a condition he came in contact with that life of the spirit of God moving in people now look at verse 11 but if the spirit this was quoted a moment ago but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Messiah Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you this is probably one of the greatest prom prises in the Book of Romans brother brandham talks about it and it is the rising of the Sun and that is Su in the title but he's not preaching about the rising of the Su in the message he's preaching about the rising of the s n paragraph 110 and if you haven't heard this message in a long time I encourage you to listen to it maybe you heard it around the what the world calls the Easter time maybe you heard it then but if you didn't hear it again because this gets Mighty rich he said that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter or we should say Resurrection proved he wasn't he wasn't only the word but he was God himself someone was debating that recently on on social media and they must have forgotten what he said because he describes God is a great big Fountain of Light rainbow colors moving through him that's what he calls God in the beginning and he said out of that went the logos which was the word so the word went out from that great big Fountain of pulsating light and so that's why the prophet tells us here he wasn't only the word but he was God God himself so it wasn't just the word that found a body the Bible tells us in him this is important to add this in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so he's not Christ is not just the word made flesh he's also the fullness of almighty God living in a body of Flesh oh thank the Lord for that he was God himself the the what the Dynamics in the word so we have the word and in the word we have some Dynamics that's Spirit life you know I think that sometimes we feel that our dedication is to the printed word but our dedication is not to the printed word it's not even so much to the magnetic recorded word our dedication is to The Living Word come on it's the Living Word that gives you eternal life he said uh the Dynamics in the word he said that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave lifeless but when that life went back into that body he it shook into life and it would rise again and and roll away the stone he goes on to say I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead brother brandom is reminding us that all of creation recorded it recognized it took not of the fact really that its creator had died but it was only the body all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again because he was not only the mechanics let me tell you something this Jesus Christ is not only the dos and the don'ts he's not only the doctrines and the man Creeds that we have sometimes accepted even around the message he's more than that he's not only the mechanics God's word he was the the Dynamics to prove it aren't you glad that because you have the mechanics you are a candidate to receive the fullness of the of the Dynamics that sets the mechanics in motion that's what happens when the spirit of God is living inside of you verse 13 for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do more mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live I I search for mortifying the message and brother bom never uses it in this particular context he uses it two times but in a different context so that makes me want to know what the word mortify means it means to make dead to put to death so let's put that in the right context if ye through the spirit Spirit make dead the Deeds of the body to put to death the Deeds of the body ye shall live but that word mortify thank you it also means to deprive of power if you will deprive your flesh thoughts your carnal mind of having any control in your life if you will do that it has no choice but to respond by dying because its life is cut off you and I Supply the strength to the flesh we do and we have the power by the spirit to cut that off and say wait a minute you're going to get in your place this flesh is not your enemy you need to understand that I hear preaching sometime that makes you uh makes it sound like your body of flesh is your enemy it's not your enemy it's God's gift to you but you and I have to have charge over it and it's easier said than done but it is our responsibility to maintain this house that he can dwell in to deprive the Flesh of power to destroy the strength thereof now remember he's talking about putting our carnal thoughts to death and the only way we can do that is by crucifying them and the only way we have power to do that is by the word for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God now I want to go to Galatians here for just a moment and we we'll take a little more time Galatians 3: 1 now I I place that in here this morning because we are to learn from everything that happened to the children of Israel the Apostle tells us that all of their experiences in the wilderness were for our admonition they were amples or examples to us and so here is something that and and then we know as New Testament Believers that we can learn from the experiences of the early church these stories are there for a reason now this is the Apostle he is standing and he is sending a message of Truth to the church in galatia and he says to the the Believers in galatia he's not talking to the regular citizens he's writing to the Believers and he says oh foolish Galatians that's rough enough what would you thought if IID had come up here my first words would have been oh you foolish neopians what what if I said who put you in witchcraft that's what that's what the Apostle said he said oh foolish Galatians who has cast the spell over you who has Bewitched you and listen at this this is what what really drives home a serious point in my life personally oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth because before whose eyes Jesus Christ ha been evidently set forth crucified among you now let's go on this only would I learn of you received ye the spirit is a question received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith go back do you understand the question he's saying to those who have walked in the law of Moses in the church in galatia now they have accept Yeshua Jesus as the Messiah and he's asking them the question did you receive the spirit of Life the spirit of Truth by following the works of the law or by the quickening of Faith by the hearing of the word it's a big question because there was a tendency among those Believers to start pulling themselves back under what made them comfortable because the spirit way the leadership of the spirit was a new thing in their life and they felt like perhaps it didn't have enough structure in it you see we have a tendency to desire rules oh yes we rebel against them but we want them in place one of the things that I is can can quickly go arai in the behavior of a child that you're rearing is a child is designed by nature to need borders and parameters and limits and a child who understands the loving support of a parent who wants to protect him or her by boundaries a child who's raised in that kind of environment even the Bible tells us will Thrive but a child who's left to its own wits with no kind of restrictions allowed to play with everything allowed to touch everything allowed to destroy everything will not Thrive because they grow up not knowing what is Right completely and what is wrong completely so we by Nature even as we grow we have a desire for someone to define the boundaries for us so here the Galatians were beginning to exper experience of freedom in the spirit oh there's nothing like being free in the spirit to live your life as a holy ghost filled believer but the church in galatia found that it began to miss the restrictions and the boundaries and they began to try to pull themselves back into all of the regulations and some of those regulations could not possibly be ad appeared to in the hour they were living because we know that somewhere in there animal sacrifice ceased and the temple ceased to function and and so there are some Commandments that could not be carried out just like there are some today that cannot be carried out in the absence of the temple and yet they were trying to to kind of try to pull those regulations in upon the new found Freedom that the church was experiencing and I hope you don't miss understand me when I'm saying it this way and the and Paul began to say hey there's a problem something is taken spell over your life and he said this only what I learn of you receive ye by the spirit excuse me received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith and let's go on and see what the rest of it says are you so foolish can you imagine starting off my service by saying you you foolish neopians what in the world is wrong with you what kind of spell have you fallen under this morning it'd be kind of hard to back the preacher hello it wouldn't matter how much I said help me help me help me you you'd get your feelings a little out of whack I know you wouldn't mine would be too if someone was saying it to me but this was a necessary message and I want you to hear what he said it's so simple that a lot of people GL over it he said are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh what a question have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of the faith of faith we know the answer it's by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness did you know the simple fact that Abraham believed God made a deposit in his grace account God added righteousness to AB Abraham simply because he heard the word and believed it did you know there is righteousness added to your account there is Grace added to your account and you may be out of your need for Grace but I need his grace every single day of my life and I need more Grace Living now than I did years past we're living in the most wicked hour the world has ever known and if anybody needed Grace and righteousness we do as a little bride of Jesus Christ and did you know how that keeps getting added to our account because we keep taking God at his word I want to read verse two and three in the Amplified he said let me ask you this one question did you receive the Holy Spirit as the result of obeying the law and doing its works or was it by hearing the message of the gospel and believing it a lot of people hear it only a few are willing to obey it was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith I think sometimes we as Believers need to be asked the question do you believe this message because there was a cloud do you believe this message because there was a a supernatural light in Houston do you believe this message because uh there was a vision of a bridge you believe this or do you believe it because he brought to us the pure unadulterated Gospel of the word come on he brought us simple Faith preachers we as preachers have a tendency to complicate the Simplicity of this message oh yes it kind of keeps stringing the people along I've notice that we preachers have a tendency to to kind of bait the people and kind of try to uh you know pull them along into something and and we talk about Mysteries have you ever set through a sermon where someone was talking about even your pastor talking about Mysteries and you were more confused when you left the building and then the enemy moves in and says you're not a Believer I want you to know that that may not be the truth it may be that we as men of Flesh have a tendency to complicate the Simplicity of the gospel and that that's why you've got to supplement your pastor's preaching uh and I hate to put it that way because I don't want to put one as more important than the other but but if I did I would lean on the message as being the most important but I'm encouraging you that hearing your pastor is not enough you've got to add to that the Simplicity of the message of the hour and let that truth get in you so that when you come to church and you hear some of that you recognize it and it rings in your heart and it gets driven deeper into the recesses of your faith and you quit living a life by feeling amen and and only choosing to live it by by faith it's necessary he goes on to say are you so foolish and so senseless oh my well I've seen you pretty mad brother Shelly you you you have said some rough things just make note if I ever come and say you silly senseless bunch of foolish people I've either really been with God or I've really Moved In the Flesh and have nothing else to say but I'm going to try my best not to call you foolish senseless or silly uhoh that did remind me of a word that somebody got you silly boy but anyway moving right along are you so foolish so senseless and so silly having begun your new life spiritually with the Holy Spirit are you now reaching Perfection by dependence on the Flesh on the law on the keeping of a ritual you know sometimes people say we we don't have communion enough uh well that's because we're wanting to teach people that communion is not to be a ritual it's to be a reminder real communion cannot take place one Sunday a month or once a quarter or as the Church of Christ every week they take Bread and Wine that's not what real communion is real communion is your fellowship with him so we're not just working on drinking a cup and eating a piece of bread and washing one another's feet we're working on having daily fellowship with him so that when we do go through the the the beauty of of a of a of the Lord's Supper The Last Supper the communion when we do go through the the beauty of that ceremony it means way more to us because we realize that it's more than Bread and Wine it's an impartation of life and strength and healing and we can have that as often as we come to his table if you believe that say amen amen let me paraphrase this verse before we go to a quotation and and it's simply this did you think for one minute that you could finish in the flesh what was started in the spirit you know a church that's born by the spirit of Christ a church that comes about by a spiritual inspiration or Vision cannot be propped up by the works of the flesh by having more programs by having more Vacation Bible schools by having more Sunday School classes by doing doing more churchy things by having Packa pews and all of the different festivals and things that the modern church is so involved in how many of you know you can't promote In the Flesh what was started in the spirit if you're going to finish something you've got to finish it like it was started we're here because of the holy spirit's leadership and now we've got to depend on that not less and less and less we've got to depend on it more and more and more and more Holiness is not something we can legislate no sir no it's not the keeping of the rules or the wearing of a uniform and I'm one of the most conservative among you I see things often that I don't understand in God's people I don't understand why God's people want to to to wear some of the things they wear and do some of the things they they do I don't understand it I don't understand why any married woman would want to squeeze herself into something that wasn't her size it must be about a number I encourage you to ignore the number and live Godly I I could go on and on you know me and you know my pet peeves but those things observing those things and practic iing those things don't finish us spiritually they they set us apart and they they testify of our dedication but it's only by the leadership of the holy spirit that we come to completion the only way we're going to manifest full adoption is to keep listening to the Holy Ghost he'll never lead you off the word he'll always lead you back to the word every single time if you believe that amen amen now this is a this is a lengthy one are you ready maybe one more we might even close we probably won't but we might there's always the possibility paragraph 176 I added this one this morning it's a little longer but I want to get it in here and then we'll try to to give you just a little uh earlier checkout and every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in well if I have the Bible why do I even need a message why do I even need the leadership of a prophet why do I even need a five-fold Ministry because the reality is that every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying there in seed form you see all of God's thoughts are not contained in that book that's right that's hard to hear sometimes but remember what the Bible said if all the works of Jesus were written in a book The World itself could not contain the volumes so God is constantly thinking if you think that God quit thinking that's a lot of thinking if you think you know what I'm going to finish this thought because I happen to know that you're going to understand me if you think that God quit thinking in 1965 or or if you think that God quit thinking uh after the early church passed from the scene you're very mistaken he is constantly thinking sir aren't you glad to know in your heart that in some of those thoughts he still thinks about us we're not only a part of the original thoughts of God we're in his thoughts maybe we could say daily all the time he's thinking about us aren't you glad so the the written word that we have and even the message of the hour that has that has certainly uh developed the seed and caused much more understanding to come yet that those books recorded there from Genesis to Revelation it's only a portion of the thoughts that God has had so you've got to understand then that if receiv received into the human being the the seed of God's thoughts and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible that's what brings the thing to pass now to simplify that just a moment it it requires a spiritual inspiration to fall in your life on that seed of God's word to Quicken it to life and that's called a revelation and if you're under the impression that only prophets can receive Revelation or only pastors can receive Revelation you you've not understood the message very well God wants you to have Revelation he wants to fall he wants that button of life in you to bring that word that's laying in seed form in you to Quicken that and cause that begin to grow and push out all the unbelief okay he said and spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible that's what brings the thing to pass he said see what I mean how powerful could the church be here hear this how powerful could the church be the Bible said let this mind be in you this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that's powerful that works in the positive and it works in the negative it even works carnally as a man thinks in his mind because this word heart here is not the blood pump this word heart here in the Bible is the seed of the emotions which would be the mind so let this this mind that was in Christ be in you because as a man thinketh in his heart or mind so is he he said now your thoughts if they become expression just a few more minutes he said like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a a thought so God in the creation created the world by his thought first then spoke it and the thought expressed the thought became material and he's asking the congregation see what I mean he said now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light that said let there be trees and there was trees and if that same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say Amen Let There be no cancer and it would be gone now a lot of us find this hard to believe because we have loved ones who have died with cancer and I want you to understand you cannot let that grief and loss cause you to believe that God is not still a Healer that he's still that he's not still a miracle worker and that he cannot banish cancer from your body he absolutely can and he will but he does it by the same spirit that said let there be light that same spirit that lives in you he said and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and what it would be so are you still with me he said see it's your thought Jesus said verily you said that was Jesus that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain be moved pucked up and cast in into the sea and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you'll have whatever things thou sayest is that right you shall have it not me you this is brother brandom said not me you you shall have it what power has been given I want to hear you say that to the not just to the pastor not just to the prophet not just to the fivefold ministry not just to an elder or a deacon or a trust to the church that now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a hold this is huge I I got to slow down just a second because this is big before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a hole and becomes what a word expressed a thought excuse me a thought expressed your heart and your mind is so and filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become let me tell you something if your thoughts are his thoughts you're never in total anguish you're just not a nervous Rick when you find yourself and I'm a nervous person by nature and I know my limits and my family doesn't always know my limits but I know my limits and when I'm peopled out these may be the most wonderful people in all the world but when my nerves get bad I I I serve people better by being absent so I know what it means to be nervous I know what it means to F despair just like a lot of you know you understand it but I also know that I have to even though I was sort of made that way I have to have charge over that and I can't just Let It Go like a wild horse it'll take me to depression it'll take me to a prescription it'll take me to a hospital with locks on the door and pads on the wall it's my responsibility as a Believer even though I was made to be a sensitive and nervous person it's my responsibility as a Believer to to to to harness that so that it serves me God didn't do it to me because he doesn't love me he made me that way because he loves me and really it's a gift if I take charge over that I can actually use that to turn my faith loose because if you become more sensitive to troubles and trials you also have a tendency to to be more sensitive to the Supernatural and to the spiritual brother brandom explained to us this when he called himself a nervous person and he said uh also that he was prone to complexes he had a tendency to build complexes hello so you're in good company folks you're in good company he had to harness those thoughts you and I have to take authority over those thoughts and we have to push them into submission to the word to the blood to the name of Jesus Christ we have to take our nervousness if that's how we were created and we have to use it to make us have better contact with the other side and there are many believers who can have that kind of an experience simply because they learn to put a harness on their on their nervousness and they and they began to learn how to use that to serve Faith instead of fear and we must do it we as humans in this last hour are probably mostly all um prone to complexes of one kind or another we have inferiority complexes and we have you know all these issues that we have to deal with in fact I found a great comfort in knowing that brother brandham struggled that way and God gave him Victory and God is no respector of persons and he may not take all of that from you because he may have placed some of it there for his glory but you've got to learn to use that to utilize that so that it takes you back to faith and not to panic I'll give you a very carnal simple example that I've used before honey which one of it which one of the children got hurt in the in the yard and come up on the porch and they were they were bleeding and it was either Benjamin or I mean Joshua was always hurting himself but this time it was Benjamin he was the first and boy you you really do Panic then when the first one comes and he hurt himself out in the yard and I guess what I did I'm a dad and I'm a nervous person and I didn't go to Faith immediately oh I would going to pray for him don't worry about it I knew I had to pray for him after I panicked we got to put that in Reverse we got to switch the order of that and maybe if we pray in faith we don't even have to panic but I I just exclaimed out loud I'm standing on the porch and I said oh you we're never Stacy we are never going to let him play in theard start again isin't that the dumbest thing you've ever heard in your life she just looked at me like you've got to be kidding in that moment the only thing I could do is is is just Proclaim we're going to we're going to bubble wrap him and keep him in in locked inside so that he never gets hurt again how many of you know how absolutely ignorant that sounds that's not the way life works but that's how I work I have a tendency to to jump to some conclusion like that and the minute it comes out of my mouth I know how stupid it sounds but what we have to learn to do is is hopefully pull that down before we express it if you don't want to get laughed at you better control that before it comes out of your lips we're built that way but we have to learn to control that and we have to rather go immediately to Faith so not only is God going to help you with the blood that's gushing out of your body he's going to protect you in the future and we're going to do our part but it's up to God ultimately to keep us all safe come on and if we live so cautiously that we find ourselves in fear we will Miss so much of life that God has set aside for us do you believe that he said oh my how God see your heart and your mind is so filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts let's go on why don't we have the musicians to come there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh I want to live locked in that place that my decisions are based on the inspiration of the spirit and not panic he said oh my let's go on what kind of a people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your I'm I got to look around I'm not sure you're listening you know the original title of these notes was a lot rougher than how I I cleaned it up and I called it real Christians forget their feelings but after reading all the quotes I won't get to them this morning but after reading all the things that the prophet said about feelings I originally called this real Christians don't have feelings I've already given you Grace this morning and I've said we forget our feelings but if you add all these quotations together you'll come away with the sense that we must not entertain them for more than an nanosecond because if we do they'll control us you know we we set people up we ask people all the time how are you feeling how are you feeling so do you really want the answer I hope you do because there's some people if you ever ask them that you better pull up a chair cuz they've got more ailments my granny used to say this she said they've got more ailments than Carter has pills that was a manufacturer of medication at one time and they'll just spill that that's not really what you wanted to know is it you didn't really want to know every ingrown toenail and every come on you didn't really want to know that you know the Jews really have a better concept of how to greet one another they use the same word for hello that they use for goodbye they just say shalom when you say it one time as a greeting it means how is your your peace it's a question how is your peace and you can answer one of two ways you but most people their first response is beset and in Hebrew beset means in order so how are your feelings uh brother Ellas and your answer would be they're in order that really is not saying that he don't have some awful feelings it just means I'm taking God at his word and I'm putting them by his grace in order so that my feelings serve me instead of me serving my feelings do you understand and then when saying goodbye they usually say it double shalom shalom which really means may God double your peace as you go forward now we ought to be a little more careful by putting so much emphasis on how somebody feels because the prophet simply said it this way what do feelings matter when someone says I don't feel like it he said what does that have to do with anything it it's not about our feeling it's about our faith how is your faith somebody say beset her it's in order it's in order because it's a gift to you yes sir now you don't use your own mind your own thoughts and you this is the this is the kicker you don't use your own opinions that's hard some of us are no ad alls I'm a tendency to be that way and and I have an opinion about everything but you've got to come like I do into a place where we let the Holy Spirit direct the situation instead of our own mind and our own thoughts and our own opinion because God has something I could go a little deeper but I'm going to spare you this morning save it for another time he said but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you if God's spirit is expressing itself through you God's spirit never panics never panics it never despairs God's spirit always leads us to truth in every situation let me tell you something no matter what situation you find yourself in God has already prepared a way out and a solution to that problem if we can learn to trust him in that moment he said but the Holy Spirit has you so built into your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be that's that's that question is too big to answer isn't it he said what kind of a people would we be if this morning if this brandom Tabernacle was so filled with the presence of God when you didn't even use your own mind I mean I'm going to give you the obvious example your mind says you better take it easy this morning you've just had surgery that's what your mind says your mind's not always wrong sometimes your mind will tell you the truth that's our thoughts it's my thoughts it's your thoughts but how many of you know that sometimes the spirit has a different mind and he says you've so honored me by your sacrifice that I'm going to bless you with an experience that'll hold on you'll hold on to it and it'll hold on to you a lot longer than that recovery let me tell you something I've been around long enough and I've told you multiple times that I've seen people who found themselves Le yielding to the leadership ship of the spirit doing Supernatural things things that defy the laws of nature because God was in it the one thing I want to advise you in this house and I have for years is if it's the spirit of God you'll be protected you'll be kept you're not going to bring harm to yourself you're not going to bring harm to anybody else if you yield to the spirit of God I I will tell you if you're not in the spirit and somebody is it might be a good idea to move cuz I was a little boy sitting on the front Pew in front of my grandmother she was a big woman and she'd get in the spirit and she'd sling her hands and I'm sitting on the Pew in front of her and more than once she put me out on the floor NOS First Once I could get up from the shock of being put out on the floor as a little boy in the front of the church I'd crawl back up on the Pew and I'd look at my granny like my goodness you knocked me in the floor and she'd look down and smile and she'd say you'll be all right you just need to be in the spirit don't even use your own mind your own thoughts you're so in tune so so filled with the presence of God he said didn't even have no ultimate of your own now that is a strange word especially in this context it means the Last Stand or the Final Chapter when I read that I I I pondered on I thought where did Brother brandham get that word and why did he use it here it's not a common word I wasn't 100% sure it was a word until I looked it up then I had to play a video to see how to say it and I may not have pronounced it right and I'm and I go back and I read this in context he said you don't have your own mind you don't use your own thoughts you don't even have you don't even have your last chapter figured out or your final stand because here's the reality your story what you're going through right now may not turn out like you planned forgive me for using this example again but sister Flo take it up with her because she told me on the phone this week don't you apologize for talking about your family and don't you apologize for talking about your granddaughter everybody else talks about their family you can talk about yours and you said if if they didn't like it they could come see you so I'm hiding behind sister Flo today and and showing you this and and this was what was really so powerful about Jenna's decision to to to to start at home to have the baby at home she said but now I'm not going to be crushed I'm going to do whatever I need to do whatever I have to do I want to have a healthy baby see but I'm sure that in our minds we expected it all to go like the like the Final Chapter that we had imagined The Last Stand would be may take a long time but eventually on the other side of this there's going to be a baby well there was we were right about something but what we didn't know is something that God knew God knows what we don't know and he knew that there there had to be a miracle one way or the other see sister Sharon brought a lot of clarity to me personally when she said and I'm giving away the punchline when she said to me don't you know that if God would have wanted to he could have untangled that cord that was wrapped around that baby's neck not once not twice but three times don't you know that God could have untangled that cord he could but then all of you would have wondered why did it have to be this way when labor was so long and so intense and even made worse by drugs you began to wonder why Lord so much suffering and then when the doctor stands there and says to you somebody was looking out for you all today and and he wanted to bring the news not only to Benjamin and Jenna he asked for permission to come out and speak to the family and the emotion of hearing that kind of an announcement when he says the right call was made he gave honor to the Midwife that said it's time to transfer to the hospital he gave honor to the mom and dad who made the final decision it's okay we've got to go ahead and just let it play out we don't really control the ultimate or the ultim ultimate is that close Timothy we don't control the final stand or the last chapter and you know what we don't have to because the one we put our hope and our trust in knows the end from the beginning and that's where we got to pull our opinion out it ain't easy but we got to do it we got to pull our own thoughts out and we've got to say I still trust you I've got to close there's a song I like to sing I haven't sung it in years I certainly won't try this morning I used to sing it with the trio it was written by a Jesus named preacher whose name was Reverend McFall he's deceased now and I think at least one of his sons maybe both of his sons are gone his daughter is still a part of the of the worship team at POA the Pentecostals of of Alexandria she has a dynamic voice their daughter maybe their son and daughter-in-law I think it was their son and daughter-in-law she had gone into labor I think is the story is right and was on her way to the hospital when they were suddenly struck by a drunk driver the dad the mom and the unborn child lost their lives I can't imagine that kind of pain can you brother McFall a preacher of the of the Jesus name message all over the country was forced with the decision I I I I I can either blame God or I can trust him I may not know the answer here but I know I'll know it in eternity and he chose to trust God and he wrote the song charity see if you can pull the words up I still trust you and let me read that to this congregation this morning it'll be a whole lot more pleasant than me trying to sing it I know they're there somewhere I feel like they are I could probably find it in a book or if you pull it up on your phone I'll read it to the to the people but is the first verse I've seen the righteous forsaken give us just a moment forgive me yeah yeah yeah I see the righteous man suffer pain yeah that's okay and it looks like I've seen the righteous man suffer pain and it looks like the wicked would go free listen and in my frustration that just didn't seem right to me now put that in context a Godly son and daughter-in-law and an innocent little baby taken out by a drunk driver and he writes these words I've seen the righteous man suffer pain and I and it looked like the wicked would go free and in my frustration it just didn't seem right to me I ask you for Sunshine but you sent rain I cried for healing but I only got pain but I know your love will see me through Lord I still trust you the chorus I still Trust You Lord I still Trust You Lord I know you're able to guide me through this old dry Barren land and when I don't know which way to turn or go I still Trust You Lord does that speak to anybody else I still Trust You Lord so let me hold to your hand I trust you for you've been so faithful to me and you said in your word that you would never leave nor forsake me Lo I'll go with you unto the end your blood has cleansed me from all my guilt and sin your promise I know I can hold on to oh Lord I love I love love trusting you now you put those words in context and you'll see a man whose heart is broken whose emotions are arai whose mind is tormented with wise but he made a choice do I give up on God do I let bitterness consume me or do I do what I've preached to others to do do I just put my trust in you Lord even when I don't understand it is there anybody here today that has something in your heart in your life in your situation in your past that you just don't understand the wise and it torments your mind and eats at you emotionally if if you're here and and there's something that you can't quite get over I want to remind you that if you'll put your trust in the Lord he will roll you over the tide he'll bring you forward and through he could have taken you over he could have taken you around but it sounds like he chose to bring you through when I find myself myself in a crisis of faith and my peace is Disturbed it's in that particular moment that I have to pull my thoughts and opinions and feelings aside and I have to choose to put my hope and my trust in the Lord for he sees us through everything when my mind is reminded of running with my mother as a small boy from an abusive husband who had beat my mom to the point of almost being unconscious and I remember hiding with her in the bushes of the apartment where we lived and she was breathing so heavily from her pain and from her haste of getting me away from him and escaping herself she was breathing so heavy and my heart as a child was saying my mind wanted her to be quiet because I knew she was going to give our hiding spot away and he found us but Grace had already moved on the scene and the anger was gone and we went into that other repeated cycle of Shame and guilt those thoughts tormented me for so long but now when I remember my heart is filled with such gratitude and such Thanksgiving that God had a plan for us all along and in that hour my mother didn't know the Lord but she would come to know him and that was his grace and his Mercy at the time it certainly made no no sense would you stand with me when your mind uh goes back and you remember some of your stuff and your emotions are kicked in and renewed remember whose child you are remember that you have a papa who loves you and who has chosen the best for you and you've got to trust him you've got to trust him that it's all going to work out for his glory you've got to remember that all things do not originate with him but he allows things to mold us to shape us to advance us to a higher Faith to a deeper conviction if you're here and you struggle that way right where you are are if there's something that still plagues you and and you can almost feel the Panic that tries to come back there's nothing to be ashamed of Right Where You Are why don't you just lift up your hands and let me agree with you that God will heal that some of you have known abuse let me believe today that God will help you heal from that it wasn't good but it is working out somehow for your good because you're the called of the Lord father in the name of Jesus all over this building and around the streaming congregation I pray right now for those who carry trauma not only in their mind but even in the cells of their body because medically and scientifically we know that even our cells can absorb and carry trauma that will trouble us many years later I pray right now that the Peace Speaker would draw near to every person that has that kind of a need right now and that you would whisper peace to Frid emotions and cells burdened down with the weight of trauma I ask that you would be Jehovah Rafa right now and that you would release healing that you would release healing to every heart and to every mind Lord I know that one moment in your presence can not only help us in the moment but it can strengthen us for the journey ahead and in a moment we're going to worship you and we're going to lift up your name again and your presence is here with us may we obsorb may we draw in may we breathe in the presence of the Lord uh until everything that we carry that still causes us grief and stress until all of that is ministered to by the Sweet Holy Ghost it's our desire Lord to live a free life and not be weighted down by what your blood is already dealt with so today I ask for a release I ask you to release each one of us into the freedom that your word has promised for us I ask you Lord to so fill us with forgiveness and Victory that our future is no longer dictated by our past only you can do it I give you praise I give you glory sweet Jesus Sweet [Music] Jesus

a mommy who loves you and who has so many gifts in her life she's one of you're one of a kind and I don't mean that in a way that sometimes it's used you know and you've got a daddy that just believes God and steps all over whoever gets in the away cuz he takes God at his word you've got two sets of grandparents and aunties and uncles and cousins and you've got a pastor who is Pastor slat Pap who's going to love you care for you father we thank you for Isaiah River he came at such a perfect time your promise to this family and Lord I don't have to tell you all the the details and all the things that could have been and were in our minds and our hearts at that time but every single time you came through you came through you protected our sister when there were many possibilities because of what she had already experienced that could have certainly paralyzed them with fear but they kept jumping back to Faith and you came through more than one time the doctors were seemingly quite concern but each and every time you prevailed and we want to thank you and today I I I feel so blessed to hold up before you Isaiah River Hodges I ask you Lord to watch over him and keep him every day of his life that as soon as he is old enough that he will know that you love him and that you sent him for such a time as this yes we come against darkness in the name of Jesus Christ and we claim him as a seed of God and because of that we pray that from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he will be protected in every way from any harm from any sickness we declare him healthy and whole and blessed and that he will be all that you have created him to be Lord bless this family they see him as a gift and they will have already and will continue to do everything within their power to protect him and to raise and rear him in the fear of the Lord knowing your word and your truth and I ask you to strengthen them in the weary Times May this little life never feel like a burden may they always press through the tiredness to give him everything he needs Lord even in those days that he can talk back and he cannot do what he's told may he be guidable and lead and moldable in your hand and we give you so much thanks for his little life now Lord you didn't give him to me you gave him to his mom and dad and so I can bless him I can pray over him I can carry him in my heart but only they can truly give him back to you Lord do receive him today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen will you be able to do double duty brother God strengthen your arms oh there are no words your promises are Eternal oh Lord I give them back to you yes yes we do it was not by my own Works Lord but by you thank you for being ever so faithful yes time and time again even when we were at our worst you knew that this was your son that you were going to give him to us yes you may have said that you were going to give me a son but it is just another manifested seed for you yes and that he will learn and grow to know you and not by my words or his mom's or his families but by Revelation through you Lord thank you thank you Jesus yes they just are not enough words thank you thank you Jesus in the name name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you're able turn around let everybody see this family let's give thanks to God for Isaiah River Hodes praise the Lord praise the Lord praise

sees what was wrong with your pastor you can say he works for a living I'm just so thankful to be able to I love every every time I get to do that because I do recognize that every baby that God gives us is a miracle doesn't matter whether it's as smooth everything is smooth or whether it's Rocky the life is a gift from God Mom and Daddy provide the physical part but it takes a living God to put life into that little child and to give him to a family and to give them to a community that will love him and ch cherish them all Tuesday night at 7:00 we will be here to worship God and hear his word let me just say this as a final uh announcement and that is remember next Saturday night and Sunday morning June 1st and 2nd will be our fellowship weekend and I assume that there will be Saints coming from other places and I've been a little busy the last few days and I haven't really kept up with who is coming our way but sometimes we think it'll just be us and and we get we get uh surprised and and we get happy every time because the Lord puts it on somebody's heart and and they come and I believe they will this time as well let's believe for a real breakthrough this coming weekend wouldn't that be wonderful if God has his way it'll be a breakthrough and I would ask you just as a little little courtesy to the moms and dads that have with them a brand new babies 3 days and 6 days old that you uh look and love and and hold back your kisses that's hard to do I know it's hard to do but because they're brand new we want their we want their immune system to be able to develop and strengthen and when you come to see the baby well you can you know touch the blanket or whatever perhaps I don't know what the parents will will let you buy with that's up to them but don't just assume by taking it if they offer it to you well then you love it and do something but if not just realize that they just want to protect these little babies for a little while and let them get their strength back and I can tell you this the moms and dads that have these little recent deliveries it blesses them both I've watched I've watched both families it blesses them that you love their babies and that you and that you rejoice with them it's a real blessing it means something to a mom and to a dad and all of you who have prepared food and we be doing that God will bless you you are you're doing a real service to these families and I know that God will bless you for it don't forget the prayer request as you go father we thank you for every gift that you have given us our hearts are full and even as we began to sing our thanks to you your presence surged Among Us and I I don't I don't think there's a one of us that takes that for granted it's Sovereign and we're grateful for it as we leave here today I pray we can take a a deposit with us something that you have done in us or for us something we have heard something that we experienced that will bring strength and health to us this week it's all in your name and For Your Glory we ask these blessings in the name that is above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said
