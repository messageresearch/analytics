[35:38] are not slack concerning your promises.

[36:17] Lord keeps his promises.
[36:20] Hallelujah. Do you have a need that
[36:22] you'd like us to remember just by the
[36:24] lifting of the hand as we're getting
[36:26] ready to pray today? All over the
[36:28] building, there are needs. The Lord sees
[36:30] the needs that you have. Even the ones
[36:33] that you didn't raise your hand, the
[36:34] Lord sees your need. Out across that
[36:37] camera, God sees your need. He knows
[36:39] best how to meet that need. I have a
[36:42] list. I'll try to hurry. We had a a
[36:45] phone call last evening from Sister
[36:48] Jennifer Wartz. Brother Bobby really
[36:52] needs our prayers today,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; not tomorrow.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, we'll pray tomorrow. But
[36:57] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[36:58] &gt;&gt; I wanted to stress the emphasis of
[37:00] praying particularly strong for him
[37:02] today.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; He needs a miracle. His body is growing
[37:05] weak and he needs strength that only
[37:08] comes from the Lord. Let's continue
[37:10] every day to pray for Sister Williams
[37:13] that God will completely give her
[37:15] strength to press through. She's been in
[37:17] wonderful spirits this week and we're
[37:19] thanking God for that. But she stands in
[37:22] need of a miracle. Sister Alfreda
[37:24] reached out and she's been able to uh
[37:27] change her ticket sort of at the last
[37:29] minute, come home a little early for to
[37:31] be with us for communion, but she has
[37:34] asked that we would pray. I'm sure
[37:35] they're streaming. Sister Lydia, her
[37:38] sister. I I uh I think it's a little
[37:41] rude, Sister Lydia, to tell people's
[37:44] age, especially a lady, but I think it's
[37:46] quite a milestone. And on October the
[37:49] 1st, Sister Lydia Whitmer will be 90
[37:51] years old.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; And uh God has been so good to her.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; So good.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And Sister Adena also stands in needs of
[37:59] need of prayer. She's north of that
[38:00] number. And uh brother uh Bernie has
[38:04] been real good to keep me posted along
[38:06] the way of her condition. She is a saint
[38:10] and she's a precious child of God. She
[38:12] needs the strength of the Lord. We are
[38:15] so thankful for two new uh members of
[38:19] the New Hope Revival Ministry family.
[38:23] Brother Luke and Sister Megan have had
[38:25] their beautiful twins.
[38:28] Adasa is the girl and Isaac is the boy.
[38:32] Uh uh one was six pounds. Uh
[38:37] &gt;&gt; um
[38:38] &gt;&gt; the the girl was six.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; The girl was six pounds and Isaac was
[38:42] six and 6.5.
[38:45] They're concerned about him somewhat
[38:47] because they think he may have swallowed
[38:49] some amniotic uh fluid and he is uh in
[38:53] the uh the Niku ward. uh with some
[38:58] assistance for his breathing. His lungs
[39:01] are not all the way there yet, but I
[39:04] tell you, I I felt like God broke
[39:06] through 4:00 this morning. I felt like
[39:09] God broke through in prayer. I believe I
[39:12] believe that this is going to turn very
[39:15] quickly.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; I believe the enemy is a liar
[39:18] &gt;&gt; and I believe this is going to turn very
[39:19] quickly and God's going to raise up
[39:22] those precious. I mean, you know, that's
[39:24] pretty outstanding that they are 6 and
[39:27] 6.5 lbs and and early. God's good. The
[39:30] babies were not in in uh someone asked,
[39:33] "No, the babies were not in any uh sort
[39:36] of risk, but it was taking a toll on
[39:38] Sister Megan's body, and she was getting
[39:40] in a in a situation uh where they
[39:43] thought it was probably time to come in
[39:45] and and help things along." Brother
[39:47] Michael said that Sister Crystalin is
[39:49] not well in Adelaide and Lydia. they
[39:51] could use our prayers. A little maybe
[39:53] fever coming in and out and sinus
[39:55] infection. Brother Truman and Sister
[39:57] Martha are making a long quick trip all
[40:00] the way to Missouri and back in a very
[40:02] short few hours. Uh and we want to cover
[40:06] them in prayer this week. I want you to
[40:08] ask the Lord for his help and strength,
[40:11] deliverance. Uh raise them up, Zach and
[40:15] Michaela and Carter.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Uh I've prayed for them and I
[40:18] know you have every day this week
[40:19] believing God to move in their lives.
[40:22] And we heard today from brother and
[40:24] sister Ryder that they're uh going to
[40:27] make it indeed for camp meeting coming
[40:29] next Sunday. So we want to pray that the
[40:31] Lord will uh certainly give them
[40:34] traveling mercies as well. He's got it
[40:36] all in his great big capable hands.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes.
[40:41] Let's take these needs to the Lord.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Lots to pray about.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Lots to pray about. But I know God is
[40:48] able to accomplish every bit of it by
[40:51] his grace.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; He is able
[41:00] more
[41:01] than able
[41:05] to accomplish what concerns me today.
[41:11] He is able,
[41:15] more
[41:16] than able
[41:20] to handle anything that comes my way. He
[41:27] is able
[41:30] more than able
[41:35] to do much more than I could ever dream.
[41:42] He is able
[41:45] more
[41:46] than able
[41:50] to make me what he wants me to be.
[41:55] Brother Daniel, will you come? He is
[41:58] able,
[42:00] more
[42:02] than able
[42:05] to accomplish what concerns me today.
[42:12] He is able,
[42:15] more
[42:17] than able
[42:20] to handle anything that comes my way.
[42:27] He is able
[42:31] more than able
[42:36] to do much more than I could ever dream.
[42:42] He is able
[42:46] more
[42:48] than a
[42:50] God is more than able
[42:53] &gt;&gt; what he wants me to be.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, we testify you're more
[43:01] than able, God. There's no enemy you've
[43:05] ever faced that you did not overcome.
[43:09] There's no plan that you've not made
[43:11] that won't be accomplished. Lord,
[43:14] the list of the names and the things
[43:16] that were read before you today, Lord, I
[43:18] hold in my hand
[43:20] my weak mind. Sometimes I can't even
[43:23] grasp it all, God. But there's nothing
[43:25] that you can't handle.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; You've been meeting us week in and week
[43:30] out, Lord. You've been the your presence
[43:33] on the campground has been so rich and
[43:35] it's been so sweet.
[43:38] And this week, Lord, you gave us rain
[43:40] and the grass is green and it's reaching
[43:42] for what you sent.
[43:45] And God, we're reaching today because we
[43:47] know there's only one that can make a
[43:49] way for us. There's only one true
[43:52] provider. There's only one overcomer and
[43:55] it's you, oh God.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; So help our weaknesses, Lord. Help us to
[44:00] not put expectations on you that would
[44:03] limit you, Lord. May would the walls
[44:05] come down, may the boxes be torn apart,
[44:08] oh God. And may we expect the
[44:10] unexpectable this coming days and weeks,
[44:13] Lord. May the miracles pour out, oh God.
[44:17] May the slle gates be open. May you pour
[44:20] on us, oh God. For you're more
[44:24] than able, oh God.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; You're more than able, oh God.
[44:31] Breathe life into those that are weak
[44:33] today, Lord. May they feel your
[44:35] presence. May the holy hush of angels
[44:37] wings. Fill their rooms, Lord. May they
[44:39] know that the host of heaven is near.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, will you speak peace?
[44:50] When the enemy begins to speak, Lord,
[44:52] would you just but hold up your hand
[44:53] though that he'll shut his mouth.
[44:56] May the eargates be closed to the words
[44:59] of the enemy. May we not see anything
[45:02] that will allow doubt in our life. But
[45:04] oh God, may we be vigilant in your
[45:06] presence that we will lay hold of the
[45:08] promises of the word of God that pertain
[45:10] to us. And may we testify, I am an
[45:14] overcomer.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you're doing in this
[45:22] body, Lord.
[45:24] Thank you for what you've done in your
[45:26] bride.
[45:27] Thank you for truth, Lord. Thank you for
[45:30] eyes sav. Thank you for ear sav. Thank
[45:33] you for a mind to understand. Thank you
[45:35] for a heart that is willing. Oh God,
[45:39] we surrender all to you and we look to
[45:42] you. We look to no man, oh God. We don't
[45:45] trust as David or one of the psalmists
[45:48] wrote, Lord. We don't trust in chariots
[45:51] and horses. We don't trust in our own
[45:53] strength, oh God. We trust in the name
[45:56] of our God.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:00] We stand fast in you today and we say
[46:02] thank you that we can come before you.
[46:06] Thank you for the price you paid at
[46:08] Calvary.
[46:10] Thank you for the stripes you bore.
[46:15] Our war is over. Oh God,
[46:19] we surrender to you, Lord.
[46:22] Oh, continue to do what you're doing,
[46:26] Lord.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; We ask it in the lovely name of our
[46:30] savior Yeshua, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[46:40] Oh, praise the Lord.
[46:44] Praise the Lord.
[46:48] Glory, glory to the name of the Lord.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today,
[47:00] precious.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful privilege it is for us
[47:05] to be in the house of the Lord, gathered
[47:08] with saints of God who, like precious
[47:12] faith, want to worship with all their
[47:14] heart.
[47:15] Jacob, sure good to see you today. This
[47:18] young lady here with you. God bless you.
[47:20] We're glad that you're here. May the
[47:22] Lord bless you and speak to your heart
[47:24] while you're here. Jonathan, it's good
[47:27] to see you, buddy. And God bless you.
[47:29] We're glad that you're here today.
[47:36] Sister Dorothy, it's always good to have
[47:38] you in the house of the Lord with us.
[47:39] God bless you today.
[47:44] Every one of you home folk, we're so
[47:46] glad that you're in the house of the
[47:47] Lord and so thankful that the Lord has
[47:49] strengthened you this week. Brother Kate
[47:52] is going to slip over to the piano.
[47:53] We're going to continue to worship the
[47:55] Lord as we give of our tithe and
[47:57] offering, giving for the work of the
[48:00] Lord. God is so faithful. He has blessed
[48:02] us. He has provided for us and he's
[48:05] provided for what we have need of on
[48:08] this uh campground and in this ministry.
[48:12] And uh just a bit of housekeeping. They
[48:14] tell me, I have not seen it, but they
[48:16] tell me that somewhere back there there
[48:18] is a list of of uh things that need to
[48:22] be done inside of the church building as
[48:24] far as cleaning, getting ready for camp
[48:26] meeting. We're just uh uh slightly over
[48:29] a week until camp meeting starts. And so
[48:32] we want the the building to be clean and
[48:36] presentable for all of those that are
[48:38] coming in. The that we just want it to
[48:40] be clean for the Lord.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; We want to make sure that it's the best
[48:45] for him.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And uh Brother Daniel mentioned to me
[48:49] that he would like to have a a group of
[48:52] guys to clean the ditch line just before
[48:54] it's done. Yeah. But they'll throw some
[48:57] more out before it's over with. So,
[48:58] we'll we'll go over it again. But the
[49:01] reason I was going to say that is
[49:02] because for about one hour on Saturday
[49:05] morning, if I could have a group of guys
[49:08] that we could clean up a little bit uh
[49:11] under the uh tabernacle side there where
[49:14] there's so much stuff, if we can just
[49:16] get some of it moved kind of out of the
[49:18] way so it doesn't look so sloppy as
[49:20] we're driving down there. It'll just
[49:22] take a little bit of time, not a whole
[49:23] lot of time. and and we're in
[49:26] expectation of what God is is doing and
[49:30] what he's going to do.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; And we're in such expectation that we
[49:35] are not planning for it to be over when
[49:38] camp meeting is over.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And so when camp meeting is over, we're
[49:43] going to start doing some deconstruction
[49:47] in anticipation of expansion down there.
[49:52] We want to be ready for whatever God
[49:55] wants to do. And however he wants to do
[49:58] it, when he wants to do it, we want to
[50:00] be ready.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; So, we want to we want to put our our
[50:05] hand to the plow, so to speak. But, uh,
[50:08] this coming Saturday for just about I
[50:10] think we could do it in an hour and we
[50:12] can clean that some of that stuff up
[50:14] down there just to make it look a little
[50:16] better for camp meeting. And so, uh,
[50:19] with that said, let's receive the tithe
[50:21] and the offering. We want to give as
[50:24] unto the Lord. Brother Michael, could I
[50:27] call on you and brother Ellias today to
[50:29] go to the people for the tithe and the
[50:31] offering? As our brother is is singing,
[50:34] we're worshiping with him in our hearts
[50:36] preparing for the preaching of the word.
[50:39] I believe the Lord has something he
[50:40] wants to say to us today. Amen. That's
[50:43] why we came. God bless you as you give
[50:45] to the Lord.
[50:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.

[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm good, not because I'm
[1:02:12] great, and not because I'm strong.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And I held on
[1:02:20] till the storm was over.
[1:02:24] I don't claim to be a hero. And I don't
[1:02:29] have all the answers, but I held on
[1:02:35] till the storm was over.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Bless my Lord.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; It's not because I'm good and not
[1:02:42] because I'm great, but just because he's
[1:02:46] strong. I just held on.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Holding on to Jesus.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. I just held on.
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You're good, master. You're good.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I just held on.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:03:10] you, Lord. We say again that when we
[1:03:13] can't hold on to you, we're thankful,
[1:03:16] Lord, that you can hold on to us.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Father, may we make up our mind?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; It's late. It's very late, very late in
[1:03:25] the hour.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Not not not the time today, but but the
[1:03:30] end times are upon us.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And we're coming into the last of the
[1:03:34] last and we want to be ready to meet the
[1:03:37] Lord. 99 and a half 99 and a half will
[1:03:42] not do.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; It's 100%.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It's giving God everything. It's
[1:03:48] pursuing him with your whole heart. Yes.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish people would listen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I wish they would listen to wisdom. I
[1:03:57] wish they would listen to advice. Lord
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; so they don't have to learn the hard
[1:04:02] way.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; 99 and a half won't do.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; You've got to give him everything.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't he worth? Doesn't he deserve it?
[1:04:10] Isn't he worthy?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:15] The word of God, his word is life to us
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; and it must take preeminence in our
[1:04:22] lives.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Not just on Sunday morning,
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Tuesday night, but every day.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; His word. Lord,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; his word. It's more vital, more
[1:04:32] important than a hunting video or a
[1:04:34] racing video or a video game.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; People stay on them all night long on a
[1:04:40] Saturday night,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; come to church and sleep through the
[1:04:43] service.
[1:04:45] That's just not That's just not 100%, is
[1:04:49] it?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; No. No, no. We've got to give him
[1:04:52] everything.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And he's ready. He's ready.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's here this morning.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; We invited him here.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe God's hearing
[1:05:01] and answering prayer?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord another hand clap of
[1:05:05] praise. Worthy.
[1:05:09] Worthy.
[1:05:11] Hallelujah.
[1:05:16] God does not draw us so that we can
[1:05:19] spend our life in some denominational
[1:05:21] system.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He delivers us so that we can serve him
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; and believe his word.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the only overcoming only way
[1:05:31] to overcome is to embrace the fullness
[1:05:33] of God's word. Not a piece of it or a
[1:05:36] portion of it. It's not joining the
[1:05:38] church. The right hand of fellowship
[1:05:40] doesn't bring you in and the right
[1:05:42] Buddha fellowship can't kick you out.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the church of the
[1:05:47] firstborn.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You're born into it by the spirit. Isn't
[1:05:50] that right?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; By water,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; by baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; and by blood,
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; his precious lifegiving blood. Wasn't
[1:06:00] this wonderful this morning? All this
[1:06:02] worship. Let's thank God for these
[1:06:05] musicians.
[1:06:10] Hallelujah.
[1:06:11] Turn in your Bible while you're standing
[1:06:13] to Leviticus chapter 16 this morning.
[1:06:16] And I know that with the spirit of God
[1:06:18] moving like that, it's might be a little
[1:06:21] hard to for you to settle to the word,
[1:06:23] but let's do it because that's why we're
[1:06:25] here. And uh I I feel him and I know
[1:06:28] he's doing something good and deep and
[1:06:30] wonderful and we give him the praise.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Uh the all the best that you and I can
[1:06:36] do is just yield to him.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; If you know anyone who needs a hotel for
[1:06:40] camp meeting, October the 1st is the
[1:06:43] absolute deadline for the discounted
[1:06:46] rates. and they're already uh you you
[1:06:49] already have to kind of move around a
[1:06:51] little bit to get uh to get what you're
[1:06:53] looking for and but they're still
[1:06:55] available until October the 1st. If if
[1:06:58] you hear of this week someone coming in
[1:07:01] just for the banquet, October the 1st is
[1:07:03] the deadline for the for the catering,
[1:07:06] we have to let them know. We can't
[1:07:08] expect them to, you know, just come on a
[1:07:11] loose number. And so we're working
[1:07:13] toward that. All the work that's gone on
[1:07:15] around here has been absolutely
[1:07:17] incredible. The campground looks better
[1:07:19] than it's looked in many, many years. An
[1:07:22] old friend of mine stopped by this week.
[1:07:24] Hadn't been here in a long time on the
[1:07:26] property. He said, "This place is
[1:07:28] shining. It looks absolutely beautiful."
[1:07:31] Thank you, every one of you, for what
[1:07:33] you've done. We believe God has a great
[1:07:36] great plan. Camp meeting is going to be
[1:07:39] a a Moab. It's going to be a divine
[1:07:41] appointment. Let's believe that he will
[1:07:43] move among us in outstanding ways.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Leviticus chapter 16, uh,
[1:07:52] beginning in verse 29. And this shall be
[1:07:57] a statute forever unto you. I don't know
[1:08:01] what that says to you, but I'll tell you
[1:08:03] what it says to me. Uh there will never
[1:08:06] be a time that there will not be
[1:08:09] reflection on what God is about to say.
[1:08:13] When I read that this is a everlasting
[1:08:17] statute or uh uh something along those
[1:08:21] lines, I know that God is about to
[1:08:24] reveal even in Old Testament. He's about
[1:08:26] to reveal a pattern that's going to go
[1:08:29] with us through type and shadow, through
[1:08:32] reality and antityype. and it's going to
[1:08:35] go all the way through even into
[1:08:37] millennium and eternity with us. Now,
[1:08:39] that is a pretty important aspect of our
[1:08:41] faith. Would you agree?
[1:08:43] This shall be a statute forever unto
[1:08:46] you, that in the seventh month, that's
[1:08:48] where we are on the Hebrew calendar
[1:08:50] right now, on the 10th day of the month,
[1:08:54] ye shall afflict your souls, and do no
[1:08:57] work at all, whether it be one of your
[1:08:59] own country or a stranger that
[1:09:01] sojourneth among you.
[1:09:04] For on that day shall the priest make an
[1:09:07] atonement for you to cleanse you that
[1:09:12] you may be clean from all of your sins
[1:09:16] before the Lord. It shall be a Sabbath
[1:09:19] of rest unto you and you shall afflict
[1:09:21] your soul by a statute for for how long?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Forever. It didn't say until grace. It
[1:09:28] says forever.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I believe God knows what he's saying.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Don't you? Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And the priest whom he shall anoint, and
[1:09:37] whom he shall consecrate to minister in
[1:09:40] the priest's office, in his
[1:09:42] father'sstead, shall make the atonement,
[1:09:44] and shall put on the linen clothes, even
[1:09:47] the holy garments.
[1:09:49] He shall make an atonement for the holy
[1:09:52] sanctuary. That means even the house,
[1:09:56] even the tent has to be sanctified,
[1:10:00] dedicated, anointed, cleansed, set
[1:10:04] apart. When we pray for God to move
[1:10:07] among us, we pray not only for lives and
[1:10:10] for breathing individuals, but we pray
[1:10:13] for the room. We pray for the building.
[1:10:15] We pray for the grounds.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And we say, Lord, let every part of it
[1:10:20] be sanctified
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; and set apart holy unto the Lord.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; This again, this holiness unto the Lord
[1:10:28] goes with us not only through
[1:10:30] millennium, but all the way even into
[1:10:32] eternity. He shall make an atonement for
[1:10:34] the holy sanctuary. He shall make an
[1:10:36] atonement for the tabernacle of the
[1:10:38] congregation and for the altar. He's
[1:10:42] going to offer blood on behalf of the
[1:10:45] altar.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; The altar is not lost. It's not a It's
[1:10:50] not an offering of redemption. It's an
[1:10:52] offering of dedication.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; It's an offering of setting something
[1:10:56] apart under the service of the Lord. How
[1:10:59] many of you want to be dedicated? Yes.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I want to be dedicated to the service of
[1:11:03] the Lord
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; set apart unto him
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; and the altar. For the altar he shall
[1:11:10] make an atonement for the priests
[1:11:13] and for all
[1:11:15] the people
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; of the congregation.
[1:11:18] And this shall be an everlasting statute
[1:11:21] unto you to make an atonement for the
[1:11:23] children of Israel for all their sins
[1:11:26] once a year. and he did as the Lord
[1:11:29] commanded Moses. I know you're standing,
[1:11:32] but I want you to turn quickly to the
[1:11:34] New Testament and then we'll have a
[1:11:36] quick prayer. Hebrews 9 verses 6 and 7.
[1:11:41] Now when these things were thus
[1:11:44] ordained,
[1:11:47] the priest went always
[1:11:50] into the first tabernacle
[1:11:54] accomp accomplishing the service of God.
[1:11:58] That is from the congregation, the
[1:12:01] tabernacle of the congregation, the
[1:12:02] outer court into the holy place.
[1:12:06] But unto or into the second went which
[1:12:11] is the holy of holies or the most holy
[1:12:13] place. But into the second went the high
[1:12:15] priest alone.
[1:12:18] Alone. Say that with me. Alone.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Alone.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Once every year, not without blood,
[1:12:24] which he offered for himself.
[1:12:27] And that's first. And for the errors,
[1:12:31] for the transgressions of the people.
[1:12:35] Can you see that?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we're we're blessed. We're
[1:12:40] blessed today
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; because God set an order in the old
[1:12:44] covenant. He fulfilled
[1:12:46] in reality that order in the new
[1:12:49] covenant. And today, as we walk in the
[1:12:52] outer skirts of the kingdom, we're
[1:12:54] coming into kingdom. And we can see the
[1:12:58] kingdom. It's so close that by eyes of
[1:13:01] faith and spirit, we can see the
[1:13:03] kingdom. We're nearly there. I'm not
[1:13:06] talking about heaven.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a new government,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; a new spiritual order,
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; and we're closer than we've ever been
[1:13:14] before. There is no time for playing
[1:13:17] around.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hear the warning of the Lord.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; There's no time for playing around.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Are you mad? I'm not mad at all. The
[1:13:25] zeal of the Lord's house once again has
[1:13:27] consumed me.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; The most important thing in my life
[1:13:31] today is serving the king. and making
[1:13:34] forward movement into the kingdom. I
[1:13:37] don't care about much else.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Of course, people, family, loved ones,
[1:13:42] saints. Yes, we're we're deeply
[1:13:45] connected. It's part of the Kingdom
[1:13:47] March, but we have to get a goal, a
[1:13:50] vision, something in front of our eyes
[1:13:53] that we can look to in the spirit
[1:13:55] because what you look to in the spirit
[1:13:58] is what you become in in in reality.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; You understand? We're not gazing any
[1:14:04] longer through a dark glass.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; We're not looking at Jesus anymore
[1:14:09] through the lattice.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; But the bridegroom has stepped out from
[1:14:13] behind the lattice.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; And the and the mirror is clear.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror. I know you're
[1:14:19] standing.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror expecting to see
[1:14:23] our sin. Uh-huh.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror expecting to see
[1:14:28] where we had aired from the from the
[1:14:31] instruction of God.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; But because of the unveiling, because of
[1:14:36] the apocalypsis, sir,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; because Jesus now stands in full view,
[1:14:41] the word has been revealed.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; And because of that, when we went to the
[1:14:46] mirror expecting to see how far short we
[1:14:49] were, we saw another image.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We saw something else in the
[1:14:54] mirror. We saw his perfection.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We saw his blessed face.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And we realized our only hope was to
[1:15:01] look unto that, look to that, look unto
[1:15:03] that until we become that.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; And uh so that the hour of seeing our
[1:15:10] transgression in the mirror, that's
[1:15:12] finished.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; And now we're seeing perfection there.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Not ours. His
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; his not our righteousness,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; his
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; not our perfect his
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; not our worthiness
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; his.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; If he cared enough to show up in your
[1:15:31] mirror,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'm using all the terminologies of New
[1:15:36] Testament.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; If he cared enough to show up in your
[1:15:39] mirror, you belong to him. And if you'll
[1:15:43] spend enough time looking into that
[1:15:45] great mirror, seeing the perfe
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; seeing the perfection of Christ,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; you'll feel the change.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; It's upon us. Father, we cannot thank
[1:15:55] you enough. We don't have enough words
[1:15:58] in our vocabulary. Perhaps there's not
[1:16:00] even enough words in the English
[1:16:02] language to thank you for the day and
[1:16:04] hour in which we're living. Lord, if we
[1:16:07] were only focused on what's happening
[1:16:10] out there, we would see that planet
[1:16:12] Earth is facing the darkest days of her
[1:16:15] existence. If we only looked outside of
[1:16:18] this building to see our nation, we
[1:16:20] would see that our nation is in the
[1:16:22] darkest hour in a and moving very
[1:16:25] quickly into total chaos and insanity.
[1:16:29] But we're not focused out there. We're
[1:16:32] focused in here. We're focused on the
[1:16:35] word. We're focused on the unveiling uh
[1:16:38] uh this great plan of redemption, the
[1:16:42] masterpiece,
[1:16:44] the real masterpiece.
[1:16:46] The logos became flesh.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And in that flesh, God was
[1:16:54] revealed. The entirety of who he is was
[1:16:58] revealed. It was manifested in the body
[1:17:02] word, the body flesh of our Lord Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ. We're here today to to hear and
[1:17:07] to be changed. We're here today to look
[1:17:10] unto and be changed. I take authority
[1:17:13] only in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:16] Christ. Power and authority of the word
[1:17:19] and in his precious blood over every
[1:17:21] distracting spirit. And we just command
[1:17:24] you to bow. We we're not trying to cause
[1:17:27] you to bow to human flesh. We're
[1:17:29] commanding you to bow to the authority
[1:17:32] of the word of God, the authority of the
[1:17:35] name of Jesus, the authority of his
[1:17:38] precious blood. And we call right now
[1:17:41] that every spirit that has been uh re
[1:17:44] regenerated by your Holy Spirit, we call
[1:17:47] that spirit to come forward in the
[1:17:49] precious name of Jesus Christ and
[1:17:52] receive daily bread right now, right
[1:17:54] here. and leave here strengthened. And
[1:17:56] we'll give all the glory, the honor, and
[1:17:58] the praise where it belongs,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; not to man, but unto thee, precious
[1:18:04] Yeshua, our salvation. In the name of
[1:18:07] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the
[1:18:09] saint and don't you come with no pitiful
[1:18:11] amen. And the saints of God said,
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. Thank you
[1:18:17] for for giving that honor to the word of
[1:18:20] God. I I believe I believe this word is
[1:18:23] is worthy of that little bit of honor
[1:18:26] standing up just a few minutes a and
[1:18:28] it's just a way of just saluting the
[1:18:30] fact that we not only have the living
[1:18:32] word among us which is the most
[1:18:33] important the reality of the life of
[1:18:36] Jesus Christ living in the individual
[1:18:38] believer is one of the greatest things
[1:18:40] that we could ever talk about and
[1:18:41] experience but it's also a great
[1:18:43] blessing to the bride in this last day
[1:18:45] to have the written form of the word
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad to have some words to
[1:18:49] read on a page
[1:18:51] and to be able to underline them and
[1:18:53] highlight them and draw errors to them
[1:18:55] and and reread them and memorize them
[1:18:58] and and commit them to memory as I said
[1:19:01] and meditate on them. My God has been
[1:19:03] good to us. He has made a way for you
[1:19:06] and I to get out of Satan's Eden.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is pulling herself
[1:19:11] through the last little hold of
[1:19:14] Leodysia. Just the last one. Just the
[1:19:17] last one. The only hold Leodysia has on
[1:19:20] you would be in that mind, will and
[1:19:22] emotion realm and flesh realm. But
[1:19:24] you're pulling unto Christ. And the more
[1:19:27] we pull unto him, the less hold that the
[1:19:30] spirit of the age of Leodysia can have
[1:19:32] on any of us.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And the kingdom starts pulling us on. Uh
[1:19:37] as brother as the Lefontaine wrote, I
[1:19:40] feel the pull.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, I feel the pull.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I feel the pull.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; What is the pull? It's a kingdom pull.
[1:19:46] Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; It's a pull to take us out of the of the
[1:19:49] closing hours of the spirit of the age,
[1:19:52] Leodysia, and to place us in kingdom.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus talks about this kingdom. And
[1:19:59] he's been building it a long time. And
[1:20:01] it's not built with brick and mortar.
[1:20:03] It's not built with 2x4s and hammers.
[1:20:06] It's built a holy habitation. It's a
[1:20:10] It's built with lively stones. It's
[1:20:12] built with those things that have been
[1:20:15] resuscitated and resurrected by the
[1:20:18] spirit of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Once we were dead. Once we were dead.
[1:20:22] Once we had no hope. Once we had no
[1:20:24] power against sin.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Sin ruled. Sin reigned in
[1:20:30] us.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; We didn't have time to think about the
[1:20:33] world. All we knew is that sin was
[1:20:35] ruling in us. But thanks be to God.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. He made the way.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; He not only made the way, he became the
[1:20:44] way.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Let's look to Hebrews chapter 10. We
[1:20:48] were just in chapter nine. We're going
[1:20:51] now to Hebrews chapter 10. Wednesday
[1:20:53] evening uh of this coming week as the
[1:20:56] sun goes down. Then we are indeed
[1:20:59] looking at the 10th day of the month of
[1:21:03] Tish which in in Judaism is called Yam
[1:21:06] Kapour. In the Bible it's the atonement.
[1:21:10] And you know, we have a lot to be
[1:21:12] thankful for because uh to the church,
[1:21:16] to to the nominal Christian, atonement
[1:21:18] is salvation.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; It's it's about all that that
[1:21:22] denominational Christianity can grasp.
[1:21:25] But for the bride, atonement is more
[1:21:28] than just salvation.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Atonement is redemption.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And atonement is more than just
[1:21:34] redemption.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Wait a minute. It's
[1:21:37] getting bigger as we go." It sure is. As
[1:21:40] I have taught you and preached to you
[1:21:42] for years, it is at onement.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; A t o n e m n t. Atonement is at
[1:21:52] onement. Meaning that he has not only
[1:21:55] made a way to save you and I from the
[1:21:57] clutches of sin and death and hell, but
[1:22:02] he has provided a way to take us all the
[1:22:05] way back. This is redemption. all the
[1:22:07] way back to the original thoughts that
[1:22:09] God had about you before we messed up
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; his original plan.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And that's redemption. But there's
[1:22:17] something more than that. There's
[1:22:19] another step in this bridal paradigm.
[1:22:21] And that is he has made a way through
[1:22:24] his own divine atonement to make you and
[1:22:27] I come into a place of union and
[1:22:30] agreement with him. a bond of
[1:22:33] relationship that is so strong that no
[1:22:36] devil in hell, not even the prince of
[1:22:38] devils, has the ability to take you out
[1:22:42] of that place of union and oneness.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; It begins as a state of mind. It begins
[1:22:50] as a determined thought process. It
[1:22:53] begins, as the old-timer used to say,
[1:22:55] I've made up my mind. It's just that
[1:22:58] simple. I've made up my mind. And then
[1:23:01] when you continue to rehearse the
[1:23:04] promises of God concerning these things,
[1:23:07] faith begins to bud.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And when faith begins to bud, you begin
[1:23:12] to believe. I mean, you really start
[1:23:14] believing this is my inheritance.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; And the next thing that comes is you
[1:23:19] begin to speak it.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; It's not until you confess it. It's not
[1:23:25] until you speak it that it can even
[1:23:27] become a full reality in your life.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; It'll line you up, brother.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; It'll line you up.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; At onement will line you up.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; To be one with the word means totally
[1:23:40] surrendered.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; That means holiness.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; That means turning your back on the fads
[1:23:47] and the fashions of this old world.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And making up your mind. You
[1:23:53] better be careful. I'm telling you, you
[1:23:54] better be careful in this hour because
[1:23:56] there are a lot of folks that ain't
[1:23:58] going to make that decision. There's a
[1:24:00] lot of folks that aren't going to go all
[1:24:01] the way.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of folks that are just
[1:24:04] going to play around in the baby pool of
[1:24:06] religion and some kind of church annity.
[1:24:09] But there are those who are not going to
[1:24:10] stop until they're one with him.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; The potential is there. The way in is
[1:24:16] there.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And and what we're waiting on now is
[1:24:20] just maturity to come. And it won't fall
[1:24:23] on us like ripe cherries.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; No sire. Heaven.
[1:24:29] What am I going to say next? Suffereth
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; violence.
[1:24:36] I've heard people try to play with that
[1:24:38] verse and make it a lot weaker than it
[1:24:41] really is.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; They're so afraid in this hour that
[1:24:45] somebody's going to take that the wrong
[1:24:46] way. They do.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; The cult world does. The o cult may.
[1:24:51] some some uh you know watered down
[1:24:53] versions of Christianity, they may take
[1:24:55] that as though they think you're
[1:24:56] physically going to fight your way. This
[1:24:58] is not a physical fight.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; This is not physical violence.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; This is determination and a madeup mind
[1:25:06] using the weapons that God's given us to
[1:25:08] push back the devil.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Heaven suffereth violence
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; and the violent
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; and the violent
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; take it
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; by force
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; by force. Somebody said, "What in the
[1:25:22] world does that mean?" Jesus said, "I
[1:25:23] give you the kingdom." He absolutely
[1:25:25] did. But standing between you and your
[1:25:28] inheritance of the kingdom is the same
[1:25:31] old devil.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; The same old devil that's hindered you
[1:25:36] every step of the way.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; He will not lay down and play dead while
[1:25:39] you become one with Christ. He's got one
[1:25:42] last hurrah aimed right at you.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, that'll put
[1:25:47] fear in your heart." It shouldn't.
[1:25:49] Didn't God bring you through the last
[1:25:50] time? Didn't he bring you through the
[1:25:52] last time? Didn't he bring you through
[1:25:53] the last time?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Have you got any reason to believe he'll
[1:25:57] fail you in the last battle of it?
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; No, sir. No, Siri. I want you to know
[1:26:03] he's abundantly able.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Greater is he
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; that is in you.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Than he that's in that old element out
[1:26:13] there. Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether it's talking
[1:26:15] about the Kronos or whether it's talking
[1:26:17] about the system or whether it's talking
[1:26:19] about the It doesn't matter. Doesn't
[1:26:20] matter
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; because there's a greater one. There's a
[1:26:22] creator.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Anybody here?
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; There's a creator living on on the
[1:26:27] inside.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. This settles it.
[1:26:30] This settles it. For for a believer, the
[1:26:34] day of atonement has come to a reality.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; But it's not finished.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; It's something that we remember.
[1:26:43] It is an everlasting statute.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; It's something that every time we make
[1:26:50] this this cycle around the the Hebrew
[1:26:54] calendar, every year we come back to
[1:26:56] that and we rehearse it all over again.
[1:26:59] Why do you think God kept telling them
[1:27:01] in the older covenant and in the new
[1:27:03] covenant if you watch carefully that we
[1:27:06] should remember these things and
[1:27:07] memorialize these things and and become
[1:27:10] familiar with these things and remind
[1:27:12] oursel of these things because there's
[1:27:13] an enemy out there that wants you to
[1:27:15] have spiritual amnesia.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; There's a devil out there that wants you
[1:27:19] to forget what atonement is doing. Not
[1:27:22] just what it has done,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; but what it's doing.
[1:27:26] Somebody realize that the work of God in
[1:27:29] the last day has an ing on the end of
[1:27:31] it.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I know there are many brethren out there
[1:27:33] who believe the period has come. I'm
[1:27:36] telling you, there's no period on who he
[1:27:38] is.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; There's an ing just keeps on. He's still
[1:27:41] purifying. He's still sanctifying.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; He's still washing by the water of the
[1:27:47] word. He's still covering unbelief with
[1:27:50] his precious blood.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Hebrews 10:19. Having
[1:27:54] therefore, brethren,
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; boldness, I
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; I only heard two or three of you.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Let's do it again. Having therefore,
[1:28:02] brethren,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; boldness.
[1:28:05] Well, it's not in my nature
[1:28:09] to be bold.
[1:28:11] I'm more of a kitty cat, you know,
[1:28:13] instead of a lion. Well, I want you to
[1:28:15] know, like the songwriter said, you got
[1:28:17] a lion in you.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You need to quit feeding the kitty cat.
[1:28:25] Mhm.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Spiritually and maybe literally too.
[1:28:28] Those stinking things.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Mobile homes and cats don't go along.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; They don't agree.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You don't want to keep
[1:28:39] feeding that kitty cat
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; that's inside of you. You want to You
[1:28:43] want to feed the bigger one,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; the lion? Are you a believer?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Are you washed in the blood? Sanctified
[1:28:49] by the wash of the water of the word.
[1:28:50] You filled with the Holy Ghost. Then
[1:28:52] you've got the lion of the tribe of
[1:28:53] Judah inside of you. A
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; and you may not have heard this in a
[1:28:57] long time, but Revelation tells us that
[1:28:59] there is one who has prevailed.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Weep no more, John.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; You've cried enough.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; John. John. You know, we sound like
[1:29:10] John.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; We sound like John sometime. We approach
[1:29:14] prayer like beggars.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Let me preach just a little bit.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Like whiny little beggars.
[1:29:22] Oh Lord, please.
[1:29:25] Hello.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Are you offending them? I I hope
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; cuz sometimes the only way to get
[1:29:30] anybody to listen is to get them good
[1:29:31] and mad.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Offend them and then let them listen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, I need you. We would just beg
[1:29:39] you, Lord, please.
[1:29:42] Do you think that's where we ought to be
[1:29:43] in this hour?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I I mean, I know repentance is broken.
[1:29:47] We've got to be broken. We've got to be
[1:29:49] humble. I I get it. Don't you
[1:29:51] understand? 50 long years. I ought to
[1:29:53] have it. I ought to know some of that by
[1:29:55] now. Uh uh surely I understand the whole
[1:30:00] approaching humbly and so forth. But I
[1:30:03] also understand that the word has been
[1:30:05] revealed
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; and it didn't come to make you smart.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It came to give you a revelation
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; that'll cause you to step on the devil
[1:30:14] instead of laying down and letting him
[1:30:16] walk all over you.
[1:30:18] Hallelujah.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Greater is he.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Greater is he.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to finish it. Just
[1:30:24] say, "Greater is he."
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Greater is he.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And you got it. You got it. Having
[1:30:27] therefore, brethren, boldness.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's not disrespect.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; That's not God is not telling us to to
[1:30:37] be, you know, hotty. That's right.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; He's not telling us to walk where uh
[1:30:43] where with hobnailed shoes where angels
[1:30:46] fear to trod.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Uh as God revealed to me some years ago
[1:30:51] long about 2007, uh I had an experience
[1:30:55] on September the 20th of that year, I
[1:30:58] had an experience in intercessory prayer
[1:31:00] where I I I saw Leviticus 16 unfolding
[1:31:07] before me. I saw the changing of the
[1:31:10] garment and the washing in the labor. I
[1:31:13] saw in the spirit the slaying of the
[1:31:17] bulock for the priest and his house. I I
[1:31:21] saw the goats. I saw the goats slayed. I
[1:31:24] saw for the Lord's goat. I saw uh as a
[1:31:28] uh that one that represents the
[1:31:31] wilderness and that one which represents
[1:31:33] darkness. I saw all that unfolding. Uh
[1:31:36] somewhere along the sequence of those
[1:31:38] events, I drew closer in the realm of
[1:31:41] the spirit and I was I I could have
[1:31:45] fallen off the balcony where I was
[1:31:47] sitting. I was wide awake. It was in the
[1:31:48] middle of the day. I could have fallen
[1:31:50] off the balcony because when I drew
[1:31:52] close, I saw my face
[1:31:55] and I said, "Lord, what in the world
[1:31:57] does this mean? You're the great high
[1:32:00] priest." A and why is it that in this
[1:32:03] experience I drew near and I saw myself.
[1:32:06] He said I'm going to reveal to you the
[1:32:08] priesthood of the believer. And in order
[1:32:12] to do that, I want to show you that
[1:32:14] there is a protocol that must be
[1:32:17] followed to enter into the holy.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You you can't just storm into the Holy
[1:32:27] of Holies
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; with mud on your shoes.
[1:32:31] Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; With dirt on your feet,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; with with dirt in your heart,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; with crud in your mind.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now. In fact, we understand
[1:32:43] about this day of atonement uh that
[1:32:45] somewhere along the way they started uh
[1:32:48] this tradition that they would keep the
[1:32:50] high priest up all night long.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't get any passes the next day.
[1:32:56] He had to work just as hard as he always
[1:32:58] had to work on the day of atonement. But
[1:33:00] he stayed up all night so that he
[1:33:02] wouldn't sleep. Why do you think they
[1:33:03] wouldn't let him sleep? Because he
[1:33:05] wouldn't be completely responsible for
[1:33:07] some kind of dream that he might would
[1:33:10] have in the night that would defile him.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Did you know you dream something filthy?
[1:33:17] You need his sanctifying power
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; to cleanse and cut that off of your
[1:33:22] life.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do I do?" You go to
[1:33:25] the word.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; How are we sanctified? By the word.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; How are we cleansed? By the word.
[1:33:31] Washing of the water of the word. Come
[1:33:33] on. That's how we do it. So, if you
[1:33:36] dream some filthy dream, if you people
[1:33:38] that have hung out for so long in
[1:33:40] pornography looking at those uh women
[1:33:43] with their with their big fat ruby red
[1:33:46] lips and and all that kind of garbage
[1:33:48] that this world likes to dangle in front
[1:33:51] of men because it knows that men receive
[1:33:55] their their their uh engine uh revs up
[1:33:59] visually. Uh-huh.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; This is not normally how a woman is is
[1:34:05] revved up, but a man is revved up
[1:34:07] visually. So, the world has been slick
[1:34:10] and sly and it tries to put such garbage
[1:34:13] out there. We we you know, I said
[1:34:16] before, there used to be a day that you
[1:34:18] had to go in a sleazy place and buy the
[1:34:20] garbage, the smut, or you had to be bold
[1:34:23] enough to go into a 7-Eleven and ask for
[1:34:26] what was behind the the cover there. You
[1:34:29] know, they kept it. But no more the
[1:34:31] enemy. I remember how the old-timers
[1:34:34] preached against the television because
[1:34:36] they said, "You don't even have to go
[1:34:37] down to the movie hall, the movie house
[1:34:39] to see filth anymore. You that TV is
[1:34:42] going to bring it right into your They
[1:34:43] didn't know the fullness of what they
[1:34:45] were talking about. I sure did.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; They did not know the fullness of what
[1:34:50] they're talking about where we're living
[1:34:51] in such an hour that everything the
[1:34:53] world produces has to have at least one
[1:34:56] gay couple.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Has to have at least one lesbian couple.
[1:34:59] Hello.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; It's got to have something like that
[1:35:02] just just so it can appeal to all
[1:35:05] audiences. I wonder what the old-timers
[1:35:07] would have thought looking ahead 40
[1:35:08] years. I wonder what brother Brandon
[1:35:10] would have thought as I mentioned
[1:35:12] recently. So concerned about the pedal
[1:35:14] pushers that that I love uh Suzie wore,
[1:35:17] Lucy wore. So concerned about that. I
[1:35:20] wonder what he'd think about the hour
[1:35:21] we're living in today. And pornography
[1:35:23] has moved in the same direction that you
[1:35:25] no longer have to go find the fil. It'll
[1:35:28] come right on you.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It'll come right to you
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; and it will defile you. Yes, sir.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. If it
[1:35:35] enters in the eye gate, it becomes a
[1:35:37] photograph. Yes, Lord.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; In the real estate of your brain,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; this is this is brain science.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; It's like taking a picture.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Your brain takes a picture of that
[1:35:48] image. And the enemy knows at whatever
[1:35:50] time he wants to, he can pull that up
[1:35:52] out of the recesses and the dendrites of
[1:35:55] your brain and he can put that image
[1:35:57] right before you, take you right back to
[1:35:59] that place.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; And then you're going to walk in here on
[1:36:04] Sunday and play the piano. Or you're
[1:36:06] going to walk in here and lead the
[1:36:07] singing. Are you going to walk in here
[1:36:08] and play the drums? Are you going to
[1:36:10] walk in here and act like you've got the
[1:36:12] victory and you're just one big holy,
[1:36:14] you know, set free somebody uh without
[1:36:17] making any preparation to enter into the
[1:36:19] holy? It is not so.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; If you think it is, you fooled yourself.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And if you think that nobody knows, you
[1:36:27] fooled yourself.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; The one who knows, the one who matters
[1:36:31] the most
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; is the one who knows it all. There is a
[1:36:36] protocol. I'm preaching now. There is a
[1:36:38] protocol
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; to enter into the holy.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; The saddest part of all of this is it's
[1:36:45] done. The price is paid. The blood is
[1:36:47] there.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And if we don't utilize and appropriate,
[1:36:52] if we don't take the power and authority
[1:36:54] of that blood and appropriate it in
[1:36:57] every area of our life, it's not his
[1:36:59] fault.
[1:37:03] It's not even the preacher's fault.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know how people love that. It's
[1:37:08] our own fault.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; It's It's available.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; I I wish somebody would try to come in
[1:37:14] here and tell me that the blood is no
[1:37:16] longer crying out on the mercy seat. I
[1:37:18] wish they would.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; I dealt with that thing 25 years ago,
[1:37:22] and I'm willing, willing, and ready to
[1:37:25] deal with that thing today. If the blood
[1:37:27] is still not crying out on your behalf,
[1:37:29] you're lost.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You're in serious trouble.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; It's crying out. All you have to do is
[1:37:40] access it. All you have to do is
[1:37:41] appropriate it. What does that mean? It
[1:37:43] means use it.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Apply it where it needs to be applied.
[1:37:48] Oh, I I see brother. Maybe he wasn't the
[1:37:52] greatest singer in all the world, but he
[1:37:54] had one song he could get out and get it
[1:37:56] out. Good.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Rusty Goodman's song. Paint my mind
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; with Calvar's blood.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Paint my mind. Say it with me. Paint my
[1:38:09] mind. You've got to do that before you
[1:38:12] come into the presence of the Lord
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; individually
[1:38:17] and most especially corporately.
[1:38:22] Because when you corporately gather with
[1:38:24] all that filth hanging on your life,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; you affect the atmosphere.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Your struggle becomes contagious.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Your confusion becomes contagious.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; A confusing spirit starts operating
[1:38:40] among us. And we don't even know why
[1:38:42] we're confused.
[1:38:44] our thoughts become all boggled up and
[1:38:46] our and we can hardly, you know, even
[1:38:48] express ourselves in worship or in
[1:38:51] prayer or or or in leadership to know
[1:38:54] what even to do next. Folks, there's an
[1:38:56] answer for that. There's a remedy for
[1:38:58] that. You don't have to be that kind of
[1:39:00] a of an influence negatively on
[1:39:04] corporate gathering.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; You can follow the protocol
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; to enter into the holy. That's why we
[1:39:13] need to remember the day of atonement.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to remember it every
[1:39:16] year
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; because we need to remember the ways
[1:39:19] been made. The price has been paid.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You don't have to come in like a coward.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; You can now come in boldly.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; If you're willing to follow the
[1:39:30] spiritual protocol,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; you stop at the labor.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And you don't worry about washing
[1:39:37] anybody else.
[1:39:39] You wash yourself first.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; The labor, the holy labor, eventually it
[1:39:48] was lined with broken mirrors
[1:39:51] and it had a reflective a a reflective
[1:39:55] surface so that the priest is looking
[1:39:57] in. He sees a reflection, but it's a
[1:40:00] broken reflection because the mirror is
[1:40:03] pieces pieces of glass, pieces of
[1:40:06] reflective glass down in the water, but
[1:40:08] it's enough that he's able to see if he
[1:40:12] needs to scrub a a little dirt off of
[1:40:15] his forehead. This holy labor is part of
[1:40:18] the protocol of Leviticus 16 to enter
[1:40:21] into the holy. Don't look at me like you
[1:40:23] don't know what I'm talking about
[1:40:25] because most of you do. And I'd say even
[1:40:27] visitors have some kind of concept that
[1:40:30] this Old Testament is vitally important
[1:40:33] for us to get a foundation in what God
[1:40:36] taught us there to understand the
[1:40:38] privilege. The privilege of remembering
[1:40:41] these things when we need to remember
[1:40:44] them most.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; The blood has been offered. Somebody say
[1:40:49] once and for all.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; But you can't stomp around as brother
[1:40:53] Brandham said with hobnailed shoes.
[1:40:56] where angels fear to try.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; That was a part of the experience that I
[1:41:01] had way back then. I heard brother
[1:41:02] Brandham's voice in that experience.
[1:41:04] Didn't see him, but I heard his voice as
[1:41:06] clearly as I've ever heard it on tape in
[1:41:08] my life. And I've been listening to it a
[1:41:10] long time now. I think he's has a pretty
[1:41:12] recognizable and distinguished voice.
[1:41:14] Wouldn't you say? I heard that voice
[1:41:16] come ringing out over that experience.
[1:41:19] It was ringing out over the priest as he
[1:41:22] was going through as I was being
[1:41:24] prepared and going through these steps.
[1:41:26] And I heard him say, first of all, the
[1:41:28] voice uh said uh that there's a protocol
[1:41:32] to enter in the holy. And then I heard
[1:41:33] brother Brandham's voice come in. And
[1:41:35] his voice said, because fools will walk
[1:41:39] with hobnail shoes where angels fear to
[1:41:41] trod. Let me tell you something. And
[1:41:43] this security that we have as a believer
[1:41:45] is not the kind of security that fixes
[1:41:48] it so that we can come and worship God
[1:41:50] with dirty hands and a messed up mind
[1:41:52] and a perverted heart. That's not the
[1:41:55] kind of price that's been paid for us.
[1:41:57] The price that's been paid for us is
[1:41:59] it's available. It's free. It's done
[1:42:02] once and for all. All we have to do is
[1:42:04] take a moment of our life and go back
[1:42:07] and agree.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Listen now. We just come back and agree
[1:42:11] with what he's already done.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; You you you mean it's as simple as
[1:42:15] saying, "Lord, forgive me and have mercy
[1:42:17] on me according to the word. It's that
[1:42:19] simple." But it's a powerful thing to be
[1:42:22] able to understand why it's that simple.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Because what he does, let me tell you
[1:42:27] something. If you don't know this about
[1:42:29] him, what he does, he does well.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; He does right.
[1:42:36] the old system. It it took year after
[1:42:39] year after year after year. Uh it took
[1:42:42] multiplied millions of of animals slain.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; The blood could have filled up I don't
[1:42:49] know I don't know an ocean perhaps. It
[1:42:51] could have filled up a river perhaps. I
[1:42:53] don't know how much blood it would have
[1:42:54] been but it would have been a lot of
[1:42:56] blood. But here comes one
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; walking right into the Holy of Holies.
[1:43:02] Not with borrowed blood, not with animal
[1:43:04] blood, but God's own blood.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Blood that God created for the full
[1:43:09] redemption of mankind. He just walks in
[1:43:11] and just sprinkles it right there.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Seven times, putting it right there
[1:43:18] where it belongs, on the mercy seat. You
[1:43:21] may believe that it's not crying out,
[1:43:22] but I hear it.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I hear it sometime.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; I hear it sometime. Just like Cain heard
[1:43:31] it, he heard blood talk.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; He heard the blood of the brother that
[1:43:37] he murdered talk.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; His blood crith out to me from the
[1:43:40] ground. Well, I want you to know the
[1:43:42] believers got a blood talking to him,
[1:43:44] talking to her, crying out to him,
[1:43:46] crying out to her. It's not the blood of
[1:43:48] Abel.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Oh no, Sar. Even though Abel was a
[1:43:53] prophet, the Bible said, and his blood
[1:43:54] prophesied of another kind of blood, of
[1:43:57] another hour.
[1:43:59] But I want you to know and not the first
[1:44:01] Adam but rather the last Adam.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; The blood cries out. The blood of Jesus
[1:44:06] Christ. The blood that God created
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; for the full deliverance of mankind. It
[1:44:11] cries out.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Hear it.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You can do it. Go forward.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Possess it.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Apply it. Appropriate it. Don't waste
[1:44:24] it.
[1:44:26] Don't devalue it.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Get your help. Get your deliverance.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; You can't keep going in.
[1:44:40] The reality is
[1:44:43] many are not going in.
[1:44:47] Somebody said, "But I feel." It's not I
[1:44:49] feel.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; It's not I feel.
[1:44:53] Because you can be in that place and not
[1:44:54] feel a thing. It's not about what you
[1:44:57] feel. Thank God for feelings. I want you
[1:45:00] to know I appreciate feelings. I'm a
[1:45:02] feeler. I like feelings. I love to feel
[1:45:05] his presence. Sister Flo, I love to feel
[1:45:07] the shakana glory, the cavode of God. I
[1:45:09] love to know that we've touched a place
[1:45:11] in our worship that's brought him riding
[1:45:14] in here on wings. I I tell you, he he
[1:45:16] rushed in here. That presence of the
[1:45:19] Lord, that presence that goes before his
[1:45:21] face, it came rushing in here today,
[1:45:24] accomplishing more in just a few seconds
[1:45:27] of time that we can accomplish all day
[1:45:29] with our religious existences. Come on.
[1:45:31] Come on. Come on. Come on. I love that.
[1:45:34] But I want you to know it takes more
[1:45:36] than just a human reaction to his
[1:45:39] presence or what we would call a
[1:45:41] feeling. our goosebumps.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Our hair stands up on our arms. That
[1:45:47] little tingle that sometimes I get on
[1:45:49] the back of my neck when his presence
[1:45:51] comes. Oh, I love that. I wouldn't trade
[1:45:54] that. I wouldn't trade that for the for
[1:45:57] a fifth of any any any beverage.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't trade that for a hit on any
[1:46:05] kind of substance.
[1:46:06] I wouldn't trade that for for a dime bag
[1:46:10] or a hundred dime bags of grass or pot
[1:46:13] or marijuana or whatever you call it.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; There's nothing. There's nothing. There
[1:46:21] is no imitation. There is no counterfeit
[1:46:24] that even comes close
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; to what it feels like when the presence
[1:46:29] of the Lord surges through you. Flesh,
[1:46:32] soul, and spirit.
[1:46:35] I tell you, it's life.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; It'll be like it'll you you it'll it'll
[1:46:39] make you feel like like the writers of
[1:46:41] the old I can run through a truth
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; leap over a wall.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm not talking about a feeling. I'm
[1:46:50] talking about an assurance
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; that my sin debt is paid
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; and that all I have to do is come boldly
[1:46:58] into the presence of the Lord. Ask him
[1:47:00] to wash me again with the water of the
[1:47:02] word. Let me get ready to go in. I'm
[1:47:04] invited in. I'm called in. I'm not
[1:47:08] disqualified from coming in by anything
[1:47:10] that I've done. I'm only asked to follow
[1:47:14] a little protocol.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Cleanse your thoughts. Father, would you
[1:47:19] have mercy on me? My I I woke up and I I
[1:47:23] realized that in the night a dream had
[1:47:25] come, a lustful thought had come, some
[1:47:27] old image had come to haunt me. I'm
[1:47:29] asking you to come today and cleanse me
[1:47:32] by the washing of the water of the word.
[1:47:34] May I never act upon that kind of a
[1:47:36] thing again. May my deliverance be so
[1:47:39] powerful, so overwhelming, so perfect
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; that I never find myself falling back
[1:47:45] into that again.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You don't draw back and say, "I I can't
[1:47:49] go in. I can't go in. I'm not worthy to
[1:47:51] go in." No. You just make a little
[1:47:53] protocol. You just wash a little bit in
[1:47:55] the labor. Yeah.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; As a minister, as someone who leads, as
[1:48:00] someone who plays a role, let me tell
[1:48:02] you something. When you stand on this
[1:48:04] rostrm, do you know what the rostroom
[1:48:06] is? I just felt old.
[1:48:09] Rostrm.
[1:48:13] I remember the old-timers, too. You
[1:48:15] know, I cover my jowls up, but the
[1:48:18] old-timers, you know, they had them them
[1:48:20] hanging down, you know, the skin give
[1:48:23] way and it just started hanging down
[1:48:25] under their neck and their cheeks got
[1:48:26] really jiggly and they would preach on
[1:48:29] sin and they'd say debauchery
[1:48:34] and people's eyes would get big and the
[1:48:35] kids were terrified and nobody knew what
[1:48:38] debauchery was. I hope you know what a
[1:48:41] rostroom is. when you prop yourself up
[1:48:45] here, when you walk up on this plate, we
[1:48:48] we don't have a temple.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; We don't have a tabernacle.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; We We don't have a building that we say
[1:48:54] God dwells there and we have to go there
[1:48:57] to visit him.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; We bring him.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; We bring him with us when we come.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't mean there's not a
[1:49:04] residual. I spend a lot of time in this
[1:49:07] place by myself, doors locked, and I can
[1:49:10] tell you right now, doesn't matter
[1:49:13] whether it's 10:00 in the morning or
[1:49:14] 9:00 at night, there is a residual.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I feel it many times. Many times I walk
[1:49:22] through here to the to the printer or I
[1:49:24] walk through here to the file room or I
[1:49:26] have spiles uh there in the front. I
[1:49:29] just walk through here and his presence
[1:49:31] comes. I feel him. I'm thankful to feel
[1:49:35] him. But the reality is he doesn't
[1:49:37] dwell. He doesn't He doesn't live
[1:49:39] forever in a building made with men's
[1:49:41] hands. He's looking for a body of flesh.
[1:49:44] He's always wanted to live in a body of
[1:49:46] flesh. He did in Christ. He does in his
[1:49:49] bride. You need to remember that. Yes,
[1:49:51] sir.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; He lives in you.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; We bring his presence here. But if we
[1:49:56] were going to set something apart, if we
[1:49:59] were going to take a a sanctuary as a we
[1:50:02] build them today and we were going to
[1:50:04] say, I mean, it's holy everywhere.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Uh it's holy at the back door.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It's holy at the front door.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; This place is dedicated. It's not your
[1:50:14] place to eat.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; It's not your place to play games on
[1:50:20] your phone.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; And it's not your place to sleep.
[1:50:25] got a bed to do that in.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Some of you need a new pillow. Some of
[1:50:30] you need an old mammy to tell you to go
[1:50:32] to bed.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; We we we're grown and and like children.
[1:50:40] We need an old mammy to tell us go to
[1:50:43] bed. You're going to the house of God
[1:50:44] tomorrow and you ought to be your best
[1:50:46] when you get there.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:50] But if we were going to say, brother
[1:50:52] Brandham said, this this desk here, he
[1:50:55] said these things, describing this as a
[1:50:58] holy place,
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; he said, no man has any right to stand
[1:51:04] behind this desk
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; unless he has had a taste
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; of the original mana.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; I'm far from an angel.
[1:51:16] I want you to understand. But he
[1:51:18] described as the scripture does the the
[1:51:21] man who stands here with the word of the
[1:51:23] Lord on your behalf is an angel to the
[1:51:26] church.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean with with wings and halos,
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; play harps, and I certainly don't wear
[1:51:33] diapers yet.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; It means a messenger.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; And it means a messenger to your heart.
[1:51:42] And we not only need a messenger to our
[1:51:44] heart, but but we need we need one more
[1:51:47] often than we realize sometimes.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, he talks to us as individuals. Yes,
[1:51:52] he talks to us from his word. But God
[1:51:55] said the bride will never come. She will
[1:51:57] not be able to come to a place where she
[1:52:00] can be in unity of faith
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; without a five-fold ministry.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Each person filling the role that God
[1:52:07] has given them to fill. building
[1:52:08] building building building a corporate
[1:52:10] body of Christ. But this this is this is
[1:52:13] sort of a this is sort of a a place of
[1:52:15] reverence and it's sort of a place
[1:52:17] that's set aside as a holy place. And
[1:52:20] and I would to God that you would think
[1:52:22] about how you how you walk up here and
[1:52:26] how you walk down from here. But I would
[1:52:28] also wish that you would think about how
[1:52:30] you come in those glass doors out there
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; because as I said, I I I don't have a
[1:52:37] real revelation of a concept that says
[1:52:40] this is more holy. You know, the left
[1:52:42] side's more holy than the right side.
[1:52:43] No, no, it's not about that at all.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; It's about why we're here.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And I can understand I can understand if
[1:52:51] you had to throw yourself at the altar
[1:52:53] every time you fall and fail and beg God
[1:52:55] to save you. I can understand why you'd
[1:52:58] get tired and just wouldn't have have
[1:52:59] the strength and to make the effort
[1:53:01] sometime. But that's not what he
[1:53:02] requires.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; If you've done that, if you've made your
[1:53:06] peace with him and the blood has washed
[1:53:08] your life,
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; it's done. It's finished for what the
[1:53:12] blood of lambs and bulls could not
[1:53:14] accomplish under the opaces of the
[1:53:16] instruction and the law. He came a blood
[1:53:20] sacrifice. He came a spotless lamb.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It is finished."
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; So, it's not that you have to come and
[1:53:31] beg your way back to God.
[1:53:34] You just have to come and follow a
[1:53:35] little protocol.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And we ought to remember that. Not just
[1:53:38] on the day of atonement, but there's
[1:53:40] just a little protocol. You wash your
[1:53:43] hands, don't you? I was running late
[1:53:45] this morning, not because I wasn't up. I
[1:53:47] got up at 5:55 this morning. Went in and
[1:53:50] got my shower. prayed in the shower. Uh
[1:53:53] I was awake at 4. So somewhere between
[1:53:56] 4:30 or 4:45 and 5:55 I must have dozed
[1:54:01] back off to sleep because it was at 4:00
[1:54:04] that I felt a breakthrough for those
[1:54:06] little twins, particularly for Isaac.
[1:54:09] But I dozed back off and I really didn't
[1:54:11] want to get up at 5:55. But I had my
[1:54:14] alarm set for 6:30 and I didn't want it
[1:54:16] to go off if I could possibly help it.
[1:54:18] And and I said, "Lord," when I dozed
[1:54:20] back off, I remember praying now, "Lord,
[1:54:22] don't let me oversleep. Let me let me
[1:54:24] get up. I want to finish doing some
[1:54:25] things." And at 5:55, it was like
[1:54:28] somebody opened my eyelids for me. I
[1:54:31] boy.
[1:54:33] And I reached over and got 5:55.
[1:54:37] But I was still running a little bit
[1:54:38] late getting here this morning because I
[1:54:40] was still putting something together.
[1:54:44] And as we walked out the door, Mama Dear
[1:54:46] was in the yard. Joshua had already gone
[1:54:48] out with the case and mama dear was in
[1:54:51] the yard and she was hungry. And when I
[1:54:52] mean in the yard, I mean in the yard.
[1:54:54] She was standing between right in front
[1:54:56] of my vehicle and uh I saw a few little
[1:55:00] kernels of corn from the last time down
[1:55:02] in the down in the um and Jacob, you're
[1:55:06] not invited to come to my house to visit
[1:55:08] me for for any cause or reason because
[1:55:11] my dear tame
[1:55:13] and you touch them and we're going to
[1:55:15] put you on the wall.
[1:55:18] I'll tell you that because Joshua
[1:55:19] threatens all the time. It wouldn't take
[1:55:22] much of a sportsman.
[1:55:26] That's about the kind of sportsman I am.
[1:55:28] I'd have to do it like that if I ever
[1:55:29] did. And I don't have any intention of
[1:55:31] doing that. I don't have to. As long as
[1:55:32] you share with me, I don't need to do
[1:55:33] it. But anyway,
[1:55:36] I'm down there trying to dig a kernel of
[1:55:37] corn out of the out of the uh the
[1:55:40] railroad tie there to get because she's
[1:55:42] hungry. I could tell she's hungry. She
[1:55:44] wasn't going nowhere. Mariah went back
[1:55:46] in the house. She was going with she got
[1:55:48] corn and brought it out and and put it
[1:55:50] there. And she is nuzzling us until
[1:55:54] until we feed her. And uh so by the time
[1:55:58] I got here,
[1:56:00] uh I was already a little bit flustered
[1:56:03] and I knew that there was much that had
[1:56:05] to be done. But I always take a moment
[1:56:09] in my heart, in my mind, in my thoughts.
[1:56:12] I always take a moment before I come
[1:56:15] through that door or before I come
[1:56:17] through that door and I say in my heart,
[1:56:19] Lord, thank you for this place.
[1:56:22] You've given us a beautiful place to
[1:56:23] come and worship you. We can we can cool
[1:56:27] it in the summer and heat it in the
[1:56:29] winter. And I don't want to take it for
[1:56:30] granted. And Lord, if there's anything
[1:56:33] in my heart, in my mind, in my life that
[1:56:36] that would prevent me from entering in
[1:56:39] to the to the holiness of God, would you
[1:56:42] help me now? Would you show it to me?
[1:56:43] Would you cleanse me? Would you you you
[1:56:45] don't mean to tell me, "Oh, yes. I've
[1:56:48] sat in the vehicle on a Monday morning
[1:56:50] and prayed until I knew my heart was
[1:56:52] right, my attitude was right."
[1:56:55] Not because I think this is a holy
[1:56:58] building in the sense that he didn't
[1:57:00] ride over with me. He rode over with me.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; But we should somehow keep some kind of
[1:57:07] differentiation,
[1:57:10] some kind of imaginary line
[1:57:14] between the world out there and this
[1:57:17] atmosphere in here.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; And I'll just be honest with you. I
[1:57:22] don't want you living on this property.
[1:57:24] I don't even want you visiting on this
[1:57:26] property. If you can't somehow keep in
[1:57:30] your mind and in your heart going
[1:57:32] forward that this is a place that God
[1:57:35] has set aside
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; for us
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; and for others who have yet to come
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; to manifest his glory. as brother Greley
[1:57:45] and I are standing in the room there and
[1:57:47] we're planning we're planning uh just
[1:57:50] talk just we we just started sharing in
[1:57:52] the few minutes that we had uh of our
[1:57:55] ideas for the future and what we believe
[1:57:58] God is doing. I believe with all my
[1:58:00] heart that we're reaching a place where
[1:58:02] we're going to outgrow some things
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; and we have to be willing. We have to be
[1:58:07] willing to be fluid. We have to be
[1:58:09] willing to be bendable. We have to be
[1:58:11] willing. We But we have to be willing to
[1:58:13] honor
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; and respect what God has already given.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; If I can't trust you to be stewards over
[1:58:23] what I've provided, it's almost like I
[1:58:25] can hear him say sometime, "If I can't
[1:58:27] trust you to steward what I've already
[1:58:28] done, what makes you think
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; that I would want to keep giving?"
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Wow.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So somehow on this day of atonement as
[1:58:40] we enter into this season, we're we're
[1:58:43] not lost and undone without God and
[1:58:46] we're begging for a blood sacrifice.
[1:58:48] It's done.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; But I will tell you that that doesn't
[1:58:52] mean we don't need the blood.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; We still need the power of the blood. We
[1:58:57] still need to appropriate the
[1:58:59] deliverance
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; that the blood has afforded and made
[1:59:02] possible in our lives. And that's why I
[1:59:04] saw the saints one time underneath a
[1:59:07] fresh blood bath in the spirit as ever
[1:59:11] climbing Mount Zion. And I I I hesitated
[1:59:14] to tell it because brother Brandon makes
[1:59:15] this statement about not seeing blood in
[1:59:17] the vision. Well, I don't know. I can't
[1:59:19] answer to it. First of all, I can't find
[1:59:22] that in the scripture. Second of all, I
[1:59:24] can't answer it. I don't know why it
[1:59:26] came that way. All I have to do is say I
[1:59:29] have to tell you how it came. But I saw
[1:59:31] this. It wasn't gory. wasn't gross.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; It didn't make me queasy.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; It lifted me.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; God
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; that there was such an hour that defeat
[1:59:44] had prevailed
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; and sin had ruled
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; and laziness had overtaken
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; secrecy.
[1:59:54] Secrecy.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Digging ditches to try to cover up. Not
[2:00:00] literally skeletons,
[2:00:03] but spiritually.
[2:00:05] And for me to think that God would pass
[2:00:08] by and say, "I want to douse you
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; one more time in the lifegiving,
[2:00:16] penetrating,
[2:00:17] delivering
[2:00:19] blood of the lamb."
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; And I saw it. And I tell you what, I
[2:00:24] need it. I need it. I always need it. We
[2:00:28] get dirty by the residual of contact.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; We go in filthy places, which I don't
[2:00:34] mean honky tons and juke joints. I don't
[2:00:37] I don't find myself there very often.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; But even Walmart,
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; the restaurant,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; there's so much filth around us.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; And just the very presence of God that's
[2:00:52] with us stirs up the enemy everywhere we
[2:00:54] go.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. And we need to go with light
[2:00:58] and we need to go with love and we need
[2:01:00] to go with hope and we need to go with
[2:01:02] power.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; And I want somebody to come and say, "I
[2:01:04] don't know who you are."
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; But I know I felt something change when
[2:01:08] you walked in the room.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Can you tell me who you are?
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Can you tell me who you're related to?
[2:01:15] Can you tell me why you feel so familiar
[2:01:17] to me? And as far as I know, I've never
[2:01:19] seen you before. How many of you want
[2:01:21] that kind of an opportunity?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Do you? Yes, Lord.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Then you're going to have to prepare
[2:01:27] yourself.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; There's a protocol for entering into the
[2:01:30] holy.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Thank God I got some time. Now, let's go
[2:01:36] quickly to the basis of fellowship 1961.
[2:01:40] And while you're getting ready, while
[2:01:41] they're finding that, well, that was
[2:01:43] very quick. Thank you. Before I could
[2:01:45] even get there, we talked last week
[2:01:47] about Yamuro, which is the which is the
[2:01:50] feast of trumpets in the Bible. And
[2:01:53] there are three great trumps to Israel
[2:01:55] mentioned all through the scripture old
[2:01:57] and new testament. One is the trumpet
[2:01:59] that sound on Mount Si to announce that
[2:02:02] God's instruction had come down to
[2:02:04] Moses. Powerful. It represented the
[2:02:06] voice of God.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; The people
[2:02:11] the people if you if you go through some
[2:02:13] of that they said now second time around
[2:02:16] Moses you you go up and let him talk to
[2:02:18] you. You come down. Tell us
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; the the voice the sound of the voice of
[2:02:23] God from the top of Mount Si struck such
[2:02:26] a fear and an awe and a reverence in
[2:02:28] their heart
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; that they said let the prophet go up and
[2:02:32] hear him.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; We just soon hear the prophet.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; You understand the concept?
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; The voice of God seemed so large, so
[2:02:40] loud, so holy, so powerful. They were
[2:02:42] afraid that the ve voice, the very voice
[2:02:45] itself would consume them in their
[2:02:46] rebellion.
[2:02:48] And then the and then the next trump
[2:02:50] that's called the first trump. And then
[2:02:52] the next trump is the one that we talked
[2:02:53] about last week, feast of trumpets. And
[2:02:56] that's the one that's going to sound at
[2:02:58] rapture time.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; We know that because the prophet
[2:03:01] verifies for us that even though the
[2:03:03] rapture is a process, there will be a
[2:03:06] blast.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; And that blast will wake up the dead.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; The blast will be a voice and we don't
[2:03:14] have to go back to that because we
[2:03:15] understand it. Then the last trump is
[2:03:17] the great trump. And it's the one that
[2:03:19] calls an end to the day of atonement.
[2:03:24] The day has passed. The work is done.
[2:03:27] The price is paid. And for another year,
[2:03:30] Israel believes that she has received a
[2:03:33] covering, a seal. You and I know
[2:03:35] something more than that.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; We know that there's no expiration.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; There's no expiration on what he's done
[2:03:44] for you. Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do the same thing next
[2:03:48] year at this time.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; You can fellowship what he's already
[2:03:52] done for you anytime you want to.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; But you've got to do it with a protocol
[2:03:56] and with faith.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Faith. Faith makes the difference. Do
[2:03:59] you believe that?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; So the great trump is the one blown on
[2:04:02] Yamapour or the day of to of atonement.
[2:04:05] And we know that that will come. That
[2:04:07] will be the blast that sounds according
[2:04:09] to Zachchariah's prophecy at the second
[2:04:11] coming. And it will speak of the of the
[2:04:16] redemption of national Israel.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; It will be the second coming where where
[2:04:22] we could really call it the third coming
[2:04:24] because he comes the first time to
[2:04:26] redeem his bride. He comes the second
[2:04:27] time to catch away his bride. He comes
[2:04:30] the next time at the end of the great
[2:04:31] tribulation with
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; with his bride.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation 19 tells us he rides on a
[2:04:39] white horse. He that is faithful and
[2:04:41] true. and the armies of heaven come with
[2:04:43] him. You don't really believe that, do
[2:04:45] you? Aren't you pretty sure that's all
[2:04:47] symbolic?
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, just go ahead and think that.
[2:04:56] I can't hardly wait to see you ride one
[2:04:58] right down through eternity
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; so I can wave over at your horses.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; It's not all a symbol.
[2:05:10] many, many, many, many symbols,
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; but it's not all a symbol.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; They're coming, the armies of heaven
[2:05:17] coming with him on white horses to
[2:05:19] execute the final judgment of God on
[2:05:21] this earth to call national Israel to
[2:05:24] her day of salvation. Zechariah tells us
[2:05:27] that those Jews who see him there, what
[2:05:29] are these scars in your hand? This time
[2:05:31] in the rapture, he doesn't put his foot
[2:05:32] on the ground. In the rapture, he
[2:05:34] doesn't touch down. In the rapture, he
[2:05:35] appears in the air. But in the second
[2:05:38] coming, his foot touches the top of the
[2:05:40] Mount of Olives. An earthquake happens
[2:05:42] and the and the mountain opens up. The
[2:05:44] Bible tells us that splits right down
[2:05:46] the middle. It opens up and the Jews
[2:05:48] standing there. Well, I'll tell you,
[2:05:49] there are plenty of Jews there.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; In fact, thousands of them are buried
[2:05:55] right there,
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; right on the Mount of Olives.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; There's so many buried there. And
[2:06:00] they've been buried there so long that
[2:06:02] some of their crypts have slid off into
[2:06:04] the valley.
[2:06:07] And it's a premium piece of real estate.
[2:06:10] Cost a lot of money to have your dead
[2:06:12] bones buried there. Why do you think
[2:06:15] that would be so important? Because they
[2:06:16] believe Judaism believes that when the
[2:06:19] Messiah comes that he's coming to the
[2:06:22] Mount of Olives.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; God is so sneaky.
[2:06:26] Jehovah Gyra. Jehovah Shalom.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Jehovah sneaky.
[2:06:34] He sets it up. They know exactly where
[2:06:38] he's going to appear.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; No missing him this time.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; He comes in the clouds of glory.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; And just as soon as the Jewish people
[2:06:46] can get over the fact that there's
[2:06:48] Gentiles on them horses, too.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; They'll look and see his hands
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; and they'll say, "What are these scars?
[2:06:56] Oh my god, this breaks me. It It both
[2:06:59] thrills me and cracks me open at the
[2:07:02] same time. What are these scars?
[2:07:04] He'll say, "Oh, this is that that I
[2:07:06] received in the household of my
[2:07:08] friends."
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:12] And their eyes open. Scripture says, "So
[2:07:15] the veil is removed."
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; So you know that third trumpet, that
[2:07:19] that great trump, that yamapour trump,
[2:07:22] that day of atonement trump, it's the
[2:07:24] one that opens the eyes. It's the one
[2:07:26] that removes the veil.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; It's the ones that they look and see. Oh
[2:07:30] no. Oh no. This is the one that our
[2:07:33] fathers murdered. This is the one that
[2:07:35] our fathers murdered. This is the one
[2:07:37] our fathers rejected. Oh, have mercy on
[2:07:40] us. Oh, have mercy on us. This is the
[2:07:44] one.
[2:07:45] His blood is upon the generations
[2:07:49] because they rejected him. But he has
[2:07:51] come one more time and made himself
[2:07:53] known to us.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; And scripture says all Israel will be
[2:07:56] saved. Praise God.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Because they could have received him the
[2:08:00] first time had God at his mercy not
[2:08:02] blinded their eyes. According to the
[2:08:04] Apostle Paul in the book of Romans,
[2:08:06] blinded their eyes that they couldn't
[2:08:08] see exactly who he was in the beginning
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; so that you and I could have an
[2:08:12] opportunity.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't God good? Isn't God good?
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm on it. I'm on a roll here. I
[2:08:19] got to stop now. But uh uh just one
[2:08:21] o'clock. I I hope uh I hope that you
[2:08:24] know that we we we don't we don't go
[2:08:26] home at one. Now then once a year the
[2:08:29] high priest oh my had to be dressed in a
[2:08:32] certain way. He he had to be anointed a
[2:08:34] certain way. He had to be anointed with
[2:08:36] the perfume of the rose of Sharon. They
[2:08:40] put it upon Aaron's beard. And remember
[2:08:42] it wasn't just rose of Sharon. All those
[2:08:44] beautiful ingredients that made up that
[2:08:46] holy anointing oil. They put it on on
[2:08:49] Aaron's beard and it run. They parted on
[2:08:52] his head, if we were looking right at
[2:08:54] the scripture, and it ran down his beard
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; and it ran all the way down, the
[2:08:58] scripture said, to the hem of his
[2:09:00] garment
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; and and just slipped off of his feet.
[2:09:04] Come on. I'm telling you, that's a lot
[2:09:05] of oil, isn't it?
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; They put it way down to the hems of his
[2:09:08] garment. He had to have a certain made
[2:09:11] clothes, everything. The ephod had to be
[2:09:14] made just right. The breastplate had to
[2:09:15] be made just right. The miter had to be
[2:09:17] made just right. Come on. behind the
[2:09:20] breastplate, the pocket for the Urim and
[2:09:22] Thimim, it had to be just right.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Everything about him.
[2:09:28] And brother, if you go through Leviticus
[2:09:30] 16, this man, this poor man, he scrubbed
[2:09:32] his body. He he bathed himself so many
[2:09:35] times on on the day of atonement and
[2:09:37] changed clothes so many times on the day
[2:09:39] of atonement. Nobody was taking a
[2:09:41] chance. Right.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; What I love is that the high priest wore
[2:09:46] the royal robes of his priesthood every
[2:09:49] day of the year.
[2:09:52] But on the day of atonement, he didn't
[2:09:53] wear them all day.
[2:09:56] Because when he entered into that holy
[2:09:57] place with the blood of the bulock and
[2:09:59] the blood of the Lord's goat, he had to
[2:10:02] take off the holy, the beautiful, the
[2:10:04] royal, everything that was so fancy and
[2:10:07] woven and and royal and and priestly
[2:10:10] looking. And he went in with just a
[2:10:11] simple ephod
[2:10:13] like a little garment without a hymn
[2:10:16] like your Lord would have wore.
[2:10:19] We know that when the scripture says
[2:10:21] they touch the hem of his garment, they
[2:10:23] didn't touch the hymn
[2:10:25] because they didn't hem the ends of
[2:10:27] their garments in those days, not the
[2:10:29] simple and common men. They just cut
[2:10:32] them. They just cut them out of cloth,
[2:10:34] cut a hole, put them on, cinched them
[2:10:37] with a sash. But what that was was it
[2:10:40] was the it was the zit seat that hung
[2:10:43] down from his from his uh talit.
[2:10:47] And someone said I I I I I understand
[2:10:50] the prophet said that that Jesus was not
[2:10:52] a Jew folks. He worshiped as a Jew.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; He was born and raised in a Jewish home
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; and he worshiped as a Jew. You can't say
[2:11:03] anything other than that. He didn't have
[2:11:06] the blood of a Jew in him.
[2:11:09] because he didn't carry Joseph's blood.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; But he worshiped as one.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; And so when that little woman with the
[2:11:18] issue of blood, she grabbed a hold of
[2:11:20] the holy and sacred name of God.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; The knots and the threads and the twist
[2:11:27] and she put her hand on that and the
[2:11:29] virtue that was in him.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Not in the zit. But the virtue that was
[2:11:34] in him went out of him
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; because she grabbed a hold of the holy
[2:11:38] name of God. And you know when she did
[2:11:40] that, she was acknowledging that his
[2:11:43] name is above my disease. His name is
[2:11:46] above my marriage problems. His name is
[2:11:49] above my addictions. His name is above
[2:11:52] come on.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; I'm down here on my face reaching up to
[2:11:57] grab a sacred thing.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; But even that wasn't enough. It was the
[2:12:02] virtue that was in him that reached out
[2:12:04] and touched him. And so when that high
[2:12:07] priest would go in behind that veil, he
[2:12:09] had to go in with a very simple garment.
[2:12:11] Just a humble little garment. When he
[2:12:14] offered that blood, he couldn't go in
[2:12:15] there looking like he was the king of
[2:12:17] priests.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; He had to go in there looking simple and
[2:12:21] humble. He had to be simple. He had to
[2:12:24] be humble because the lamb was
[2:12:28] because the lamb was. Oh, folks.
[2:12:32] like a lamb, like a sheep led to the
[2:12:34] slaughter, and yet he uttered not a
[2:12:37] sound,
[2:12:38] meek and mild. That's the That's the
[2:12:41] Jesus the church is going to be looking
[2:12:43] for. And that Jesus isn't making another
[2:12:46] appearance.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; He's not coming the next time as a meek
[2:12:50] and a lowly little lamb.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; He's not coming the next time as a
[2:12:53] little humble baby in a manger. The next
[2:12:55] time he comes, he's coming as a lion of
[2:12:57] the tribe of Judah.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:00] He's coming to put an end.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; He'll stop the war of He'll stop the
[2:13:05] battle of Armageddon and all the evil
[2:13:06] and dark forces fighting that which is
[2:13:08] righteous, holy, and light. He'll put an
[2:13:11] end to all of that.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be so I want to be so carnal
[2:13:18] in this moment that I would say he's
[2:13:20] going to come to to do some kicking and
[2:13:22] some name taking, but I won't be that
[2:13:24] carnal.
[2:13:26] He's coming to do away with that thing
[2:13:29] that has has plagued the earth, the
[2:13:32] darkness.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; The Essenes saw it. The Essenes uh
[2:13:38] camped down there. John the Baptist
[2:13:41] among them and camped down there looking
[2:13:44] over from Kuman looking over the Dead
[2:13:46] Sea studying studying the scrolls,
[2:13:50] studying the end of days.
[2:13:53] And they looked there and they saw this
[2:13:56] great battle between darkness and light.
[2:13:59] And they described it to the best of
[2:14:01] their ability. And one day it'll be a
[2:14:03] physical reality.
[2:14:06] Oh my. And when it does, he's comes to
[2:14:08] put an end to it.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the the death of
[2:14:13] that battle will be so great that the
[2:14:15] blood will run to the horse's bridal.
[2:14:17] And the terror of those days just before
[2:14:20] Messiah comes, just before he brings his
[2:14:22] redeemed bride back with him, just
[2:14:24] before the terror of those days, those
[2:14:27] last three and a half years of great
[2:14:28] tribulation, the time of Jacob's sorrow,
[2:14:30] will be so bad that men will run to the
[2:14:33] mountains and cry to the rocks,
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; fall on us, and hide us from the face of
[2:14:38] the wrath of great God. Let me tell you
[2:14:40] something.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they'll seek death.
[2:14:46] I wasn't even a teenager when the Lord
[2:14:48] took me in the spirit by vision and
[2:14:50] showed me a glimpse of the end days. And
[2:14:52] I saw in before my eyes, I saw a man
[2:14:55] with what looked like a big machete.
[2:14:58] And he took that trying to cut off his
[2:15:01] own head.
[2:15:04] It was so razor sharp that it was enough
[2:15:06] to probably do the job had he had the
[2:15:09] force. But I watched it like in slow
[2:15:11] motion. I don't want to scare anybody. I
[2:15:13] don't plan to be around.
[2:15:15] But I saw it as he went through with
[2:15:17] with quite a bit of force. I could see
[2:15:19] as he as he initiated, but it was almost
[2:15:22] like slow motion. And I saw as it passed
[2:15:25] through, just one little trickle of
[2:15:27] blood, just one little trickle of blood
[2:15:29] came out this side as I watched that
[2:15:31] that sharp swordlike machete pass all
[2:15:35] the way through. And I saw his struggle
[2:15:39] to get it right through the bone
[2:15:42] and come out the other side. And when he
[2:15:44] did,
[2:15:45] it was already healed.
[2:15:49] He was seeking death. I didn't
[2:15:51] understand. Didn't even know the
[2:15:52] scripture said such a thing when I saw
[2:15:54] it. But the Bible said that they will
[2:15:56] seek death and death will flee from
[2:15:58] them.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; They're looking for a way out because
[2:16:02] they rejected the way out.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; It's a serious hour.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make reservations for
[2:16:09] that event.
[2:16:11] God's calling you to something higher
[2:16:12] than that.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; I feel some of you.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; I feel some of you. He goes on, they put
[2:16:20] in Aaron's beard. Had to have a certain
[2:16:21] made clothing and on the end of his
[2:16:22] garment had a bail and a pomegranate.
[2:16:24] Bail and a pomegranate. He had to walk a
[2:16:26] certain way to make that thing holy,
[2:16:28] holy, holy unto the Lord. The bell would
[2:16:31] ring, tingling, tingling, tingling,
[2:16:33] dingling. And every time it rang, the
[2:16:36] sound that it made was saying, "Holy,
[2:16:39] holy, holy unto the Lord." Do you think
[2:16:43] that God is going to require the high
[2:16:46] priest of a of of a of a inferior
[2:16:50] covenant?
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; My
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; to enter into the presence without
[2:16:56] holiness.
[2:16:58] I if if if he required holiness under
[2:17:01] that inferior covenant,
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; what kind of a sound do you think this
[2:17:07] little bride is going to have to be
[2:17:09] releasing when she steps into the
[2:17:11] fullness of the kingdom of a higher
[2:17:14] superior way?
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; She's going to have to release and say,
[2:17:19] "Holy, holy, holy, holy unto the Lord.
[2:17:23] Holy unto the Lord. Holy unto the Lord.
[2:17:26] Holy unto the Lord." You sisters are
[2:17:27] going to have to cover up. Holy, holy,
[2:17:29] holy, holy unto the Lord.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; You brothers are going to have to
[2:17:36] consider your thought process getting
[2:17:38] over here. Holy, holy, holy unto the
[2:17:41] Lord.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; It's got to be your song.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; The reality is we could do everything
[2:17:47] just right and not be holy enough, but
[2:17:49] we're wearing his holiness. Amen.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; But our unrighteousness, our slack,
[2:17:55] loose living
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; is like watering down
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; and trampling again under our feet the
[2:18:04] precious blood
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; of the sacrifice
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; when we refuse to make a little
[2:18:09] protocol. Father, sanctify my thoughts.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Help me look above the humanity of my
[2:18:18] brother. Help me look above the humanity
[2:18:22] of my sister and let me see them as the
[2:18:26] holy and the chosen and the royal and
[2:18:30] the redeemed seed of the Lord.
[2:18:33] Those who carry the very monogene of the
[2:18:36] DNA of Almighty God.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful stuff.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; You are carrying the seed, not a seed.
[2:18:46] You are carrying the seed. Yes, the
[2:18:50] Greek word is sperma, but the context is
[2:18:53] not what a man can produce.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; It's only what almighty God can produce.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; And you're carrying the gene seat of God
[2:19:02] as one called to walk out this life of
[2:19:05] purity in the bride.
[2:19:08] Everything you need to overcome.
[2:19:11] We make it look weak.
[2:19:14] We make it look like a salesman pitch
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; when we refuse to utilize
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; what God has provided for us.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; I don't think you heard me.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; When we continue to bicker among
[2:19:28] ourselves,
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; making up I tell you what what disturbs
[2:19:35] me more than anything else in this hour
[2:19:36] is the lack of integrity among people.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Make up stories. They don't have to have
[2:19:43] gossip. They don't have to have somebody
[2:19:45] tell them a story and they're going to
[2:19:46] repeat it. No, no, no, no. If there's
[2:19:48] not enough juice, not enough tea, they
[2:19:50] call it
[2:19:52] not enough
[2:19:54] what what else do they call it? God.
[2:19:57] Well, that's just kind of wore out, you
[2:19:59] know, but that that's right. It is. If
[2:20:03] there's not enough of that, if there's
[2:20:04] not enough of that, they'll just make
[2:20:06] something up.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; They'll just embellish a situation.
[2:20:12] They they they'll just do anything and
[2:20:13] say anything to try to uh water down
[2:20:16] someone's influence,
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; causing others to cast away confidence
[2:20:20] in somebody. Folks, let me tell you
[2:20:22] something. When you live that kind of a
[2:20:24] life and claim to be a part of this
[2:20:25] bride and part of this truth and this
[2:20:28] message and you live that kind of life
[2:20:30] on a consistent basis, dressing up your
[2:20:32] stories, changing details to make you
[2:20:34] look better and everybody else look
[2:20:36] rotten.
[2:20:41] It's lowering the standard
[2:20:44] and it's causing others to look and see.
[2:20:46] They don't have any victory. They they
[2:20:48] can't even overcome their own thoughts.
[2:20:51] I'm telling you, there's a bride coming
[2:20:53] out of this process.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; You don't want to stand in her way.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get in her way. I'm
[2:21:04] going to close in a little bit soon. Not
[2:21:06] too long. Holy, holy, holy. What's he
[2:21:09] doing? He's approaching the shikan the
[2:21:11] shakana glory. The shikina glory. The
[2:21:14] real fellowship.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; He said, you see, he had to make a
[2:21:19] noise. The only way the congregation
[2:21:20] could tell he wasn't dead, one day a
[2:21:22] year, day of atonement, the day we're
[2:21:24] talking about,
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; 10th day of tisher on the on the Hebrew
[2:21:28] calendar, the only way they could tell
[2:21:30] he wasn't dead is they'd hear that
[2:21:32] noise. I tell you when church lets off
[2:21:34] its noise
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; there's something happens
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; he said right assures the world because
[2:21:40] everywhere the shakana glory is
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; there is noise
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus had the noisiest revival meeting
[2:21:50] that anybody ever had in the history of
[2:21:52] mankind
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; because wherever he went noise followed
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; wherever that glory is sir
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; well I'm an introvert hurt. You know,
[2:22:03] that makes me disgusted
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; to hear people say such a foolish thing.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Really, that is so foolish.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; If you to spend as much time reading the
[2:22:16] Bible as you did trying to learn that
[2:22:18] you was an introvert,
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; did you know what the word said?
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Old
[2:22:27] things
[2:22:32] And
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; let me just go ahead and tell you this.
[2:22:33] Don't make an enemy of one.
[2:22:37] Don't make an enemy of an introvert
[2:22:39] because if you do, you'll know there's
[2:22:40] no such thing.
[2:22:45] They hide behind a title that someone
[2:22:47] passed to them from a book they read
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; and they use it as an excuse because
[2:22:52] they said, you know, I'm an introvert. I
[2:22:53] don't like controversy. I don't like
[2:22:55] what what you mean to say is you don't
[2:22:56] really have a backbone
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; unless you're doing it under the covers.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; All things are passed away.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Anybody awake?
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Behold, all
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; I'm green. I'm red. I'm purple. I'm
[2:23:14] yellow.
[2:23:16] I'm an introvert. I'm an extrovert. I'm
[2:23:18] an in between.
[2:23:22] It sounds to me like what the world
[2:23:24] says. I'm binary.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; I'm gender undefinable.
[2:23:30] What?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Take a look and you'll see.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; You may have forgotten, but God didn't
[2:23:38] forget.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; He knows how he made you.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you let anybody's psychology
[2:23:44] define you. Don't you let anybody's
[2:23:47] label define you. Don't you let
[2:23:50] somebody's book define you. Old things
[2:23:53] have passed away. Behold,
[2:23:56] all things have become new. You're not
[2:23:59] an introvert. You're not upside down or
[2:24:02] all around or any other kind of thing if
[2:24:04] you're in him. You're a new creature.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; And you can be everything God said you
[2:24:09] were to be
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; if you'll yield.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; If you'll yield.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, said, "Watch that man that's
[2:24:17] anointed." Aaron went in packing the
[2:24:19] blood before him. Holy, holy, holy,
[2:24:21] holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Them
[2:24:23] bells chiming out,
[2:24:25] anointed going into the holy. How the
[2:24:27] congregation used to admire that man.
[2:24:29] How he went in there one day and left
[2:24:31] his old staff that he had in his hand.
[2:24:32] And when he went back again, the staff
[2:24:34] that was dead, nothing but an old stick.
[2:24:36] It had come to life, bloomed and had
[2:24:38] blossoms on it. Listen, it was budding
[2:24:40] almonds
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; laying in the presence of If If If that
[2:24:45] Old Branch can come alive, blossom,
[2:24:48] bloom, and bear almonds
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; in the presence of the Lord, what do you
[2:24:52] think an old an old sailor like you
[2:24:56] some old citizen like you? What do you
[2:24:59] think God could do out of you
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; if you just lay a little while?
[2:25:06] Not in a feeling,
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; in a presence.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; I'm moving ahead and I'll uh close in a
[2:25:13] bit, but uh maybe speak a little more on
[2:25:17] it uh Tuesday night. But I marvel at the
[2:25:22] process
[2:25:25] that he had to go through
[2:25:28] all of the steps. And I want to give you
[2:25:32] just a few of them to keep in your mind.
[2:25:34] Leviticus chapter 16 verse 4. The first
[2:25:37] step of preparing the high priest for
[2:25:40] the day of atonement was to wash in the
[2:25:42] holy labor. We've talked about it, but
[2:25:43] let me give it to you in the scripture.
[2:25:44] Write it down maybe. Uh Leviticus 16:4.
[2:25:47] He shall put on the holy linen coat
[2:25:49] which is the ifad and he shall have the
[2:25:51] linen breaches upon his flesh and shall
[2:25:53] be girded with a linen girdle. Now you
[2:25:56] can say anything you want to but God
[2:25:58] required those linen breaches under his
[2:26:02] tunic as if odd. The scripture said so
[2:26:06] because in that tabernacle that that
[2:26:09] altar that was out in the in the in the
[2:26:11] congregation out there in that outer
[2:26:13] court, that altar was high and it had a
[2:26:18] ramp going up to it. And the scripture
[2:26:20] said those breaches were there to cover
[2:26:23] the nakedness of his thigh.
[2:26:27] Now, if God is concerned about a man's
[2:26:30] thigh going up to offer sacrifices,
[2:26:34] and then don't tell me today that he
[2:26:36] doesn't care how naked and stripped off
[2:26:39] people get out in the world.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; That thigh, this is not a woman, this is
[2:26:53] a man. He's doing holy business. And men
[2:26:58] and women who are on holy business,
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; they're not to be exposing their thigh,
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; whether it's in a tight pair of
[2:27:07] britches.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; You ain't all skinny.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; You need to buy you some beefy jeans.
[2:27:25] or whether it is some stripped off way.
[2:27:29] There's a protocol
[2:27:31] for entering into the holy.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; 50 years I've preached it. I don't think
[2:27:36] I'll stop now.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; He shall put on the holy linen coat, and
[2:27:40] he shall have the linen breaches upon
[2:27:42] his flesh, and shall be girded with a
[2:27:44] linen girdle, and with a linen maider
[2:27:46] shall he be attired. These are the holy
[2:27:48] garments. Therefore shall he wash his
[2:27:50] flesh in water. and so put them on. This
[2:27:53] is the requirement in the outer court.
[2:27:56] He has to wash himself first.
[2:28:00] Then he puts on linen garments,
[2:28:04] special garments. We just read simple
[2:28:07] garments. And when we read that, I tell
[2:28:10] you, every time when I read that, I
[2:28:12] think of Philippians 2:7 where the Bible
[2:28:15] said, "But made himself of," this is
[2:28:17] Jesus, "made himself of no reputation
[2:28:19] and took upon him the form of a servant
[2:28:22] and was made in the likeness of men."
[2:28:24] Here he is down on his knees washing the
[2:28:27] dirty feet of those who are called to
[2:28:30] serve his purpose. That's right.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Master washing servant.
[2:28:37] Servant washing master. Because the
[2:28:40] reality is flesh is flesh.
[2:28:46] Flesh is flesh.
[2:28:50] There's a protocol.
[2:28:53] And then we hear in in this maybe this
[2:28:57] be it. Revelation chapter 4. This is not
[2:29:00] the scripture. This is a quotation. Let
[2:29:01] me get it here now. Paragraph 218.
[2:29:04] Notice as they entered in musicians, I
[2:29:06] know. Come on. Would you come?
[2:29:09] Musicians. Now, notice as they entered
[2:29:11] in, the congregation could come there.
[2:29:14] The priest could stand here, but the
[2:29:16] high priest could go in there. Holy of
[2:29:18] holies once a year taking the blood with
[2:29:20] him. He had to be dressed a certain way,
[2:29:22] a certain garment. Had to have a bell
[2:29:23] and a pomegranate one to another, one to
[2:29:25] one another. And when he walked, he had
[2:29:27] to walk a certain way. And it played
[2:29:28] holy, holy unto the Lord just like he
[2:29:30] said in the other. He was approaching
[2:29:32] God and he was having the blood of the
[2:29:35] covenant in his hand. He has killed a
[2:29:37] bulock. He has sanctified first his own
[2:29:40] family, himself, his own family. Now he
[2:29:44] goes in behind that veil and he offers
[2:29:47] that blood first on the altar.
[2:29:50] Then he goes and gets the blood of the
[2:29:53] Lord's goat that's been killed. And he
[2:29:55] brings that blood in. He does the same
[2:29:58] way. He sprinkles it the same way on the
[2:30:00] altar. And then he sanctifies the
[2:30:02] entirety of the sanctuary with that
[2:30:04] blood. It's a process. Brother Brandham
[2:30:07] understood that there was a process
[2:30:08] involved here. He has in his hands the
[2:30:11] blood. Listen, before he can do that,
[2:30:13] before he can even go in with the blood,
[2:30:16] he's got to fill up the space with a
[2:30:19] cloud of incense.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Because redemption has to have an
[2:30:25] atmosphere.
[2:30:28] Deliverance has an atmosphere.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; He's clean. He's been up all night. He's
[2:30:36] washed his clothes. He's got blood in
[2:30:38] his hand. And still, it was a
[2:30:41] requirement that he take cos of fire off
[2:30:44] the altar, place them in the holy
[2:30:46] sensor, and place some of that
[2:30:51] holy resin
[2:30:54] on that sensor.
[2:30:56] and it begins to let off that incense.
[2:30:59] Oh my, what a wonderful amazing aroma.
[2:31:02] And it produces a cloud
[2:31:05] so that when he goes in, he goes in an
[2:31:07] atmosphere. And and we know we know that
[2:31:10] that incense represents both the prayers
[2:31:12] and the praise of the saints. That kind
[2:31:15] of a prayer and a praise creates an
[2:31:18] atmosphere for the glory of God to come
[2:31:20] down on that mercy seat between those
[2:31:23] cherry beams and receive that blood that
[2:31:26] is sprinkled. I'm telling you, you it's
[2:31:28] part of the protocol.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; You don't just stomp into the presence
[2:31:32] of the Lord. You go in with praise.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; You got to get down.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; There was no split
[2:31:41] in the veil,
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:31:43] It wasn't a gate. It wasn't a door. It
[2:31:47] was a veil.
[2:31:49] Now, there is extra biblical writings of
[2:31:52] of Jew of Jewish sages who say that
[2:31:57] there was a period of time that the high
[2:32:00] priest stood on one side of that veil
[2:32:02] and the next thing they knew he was on
[2:32:04] the other side.
[2:32:06] And they have no explanation for how he
[2:32:08] got through. Somebody said,
[2:32:11] liberable.
[2:32:12] You don't know if you can believe such a
[2:32:14] thing as that or not? Do you believe it
[2:32:15] when the Bible said that Jesus walked
[2:32:17] through the wall?
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that in his resurrected
[2:32:23] body when he appeared to the apostles,
[2:32:24] he didn't use a door?
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; He just appeared among them.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; He just showed up in the room.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; If God can do that, do you really have a
[2:32:32] problem believing that the that God
[2:32:34] could take a high priest on one side of
[2:32:36] the veil and put him on the other side?
[2:32:38] Please folks, don't become skeptics in
[2:32:40] this last hour.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; If there's ever been an hour to embrace
[2:32:44] the supernatural workings of a
[2:32:46] supernatural God because you're a
[2:32:48] supernatural people,
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; this is the hour to do that.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; And if you're sitting under something
[2:32:55] that won't allow you to embrace that,
[2:32:57] you're sitting under the wrong thing.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; He's a supernatural God. He said, "I'm
[2:33:02] going to have a supernatural people
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to deal with them in a
[2:33:05] supernatural way." Wise.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; Then how'd he get in the rest of the
[2:33:10] time? Under.
[2:33:14] Under. This is the high priest only one
[2:33:18] at a time.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; And how did he get into the holy of
[2:33:22] holies? He's got a sensor in one hand.
[2:33:25] A
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; and a bowl of blood in the other hand.
[2:33:31] I don't know if he had to get down on
[2:33:33] his knees and put one put one down
[2:33:38] while he while he got his arm up under
[2:33:40] the veil.
[2:33:44] I'm not sure if he held one in one hand,
[2:33:46] one other, and used his nose like a
[2:33:48] porpus
[2:33:51] to lift that veil up,
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; but I know he was stripped of his royal.
[2:33:56] He didn't even have the golden miter on
[2:33:58] his head. He just had a linen miter
[2:34:01] which was like a sweat rag tied around
[2:34:04] the top of his head, but it still said
[2:34:05] holiness unto the Lord, but it didn't
[2:34:08] have the gold. Didn't have the crown
[2:34:10] that went with it. So, he's got a what
[2:34:13] looks like a sweat rag on his head and a
[2:34:15] very simple servant's garment. He's got
[2:34:17] incense. He got blood. I don't know how
[2:34:19] he's doing all these different things.
[2:34:20] We don't we don't know. We weren't
[2:34:21] there. But I know this. He had to get
[2:34:23] his low
[2:34:28] Somebody said, "Don't you expect the
[2:34:30] priest? Don't you expect the priest
[2:34:32] helped him get in?" I tell you what,
[2:34:33] they were probably afraid
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; to look into the holiness that was
[2:34:38] behind that veil, knowing that only one
[2:34:42] was ordained to go in.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; So, the point is this.
[2:34:47] If you want to go up,
[2:34:50] you got to go down first.
[2:34:52] Yes.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; The way up is not up.
[2:34:57] The way up is down.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; You heard brother Brandham talk about
[2:35:03] it, didn't you?
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; In the priest of way the man walked up.
[2:35:06] Oh, hearty, you know,
[2:35:09] come down a little different. If he'd
[2:35:10] have went up like he come down
[2:35:14] that high priest, he had to get pretty
[2:35:16] low right down on the dirt. Someone told
[2:35:19] me this week I had to humble myself and
[2:35:21] be on my face before the Lord. That
[2:35:23] won't hurt any of us.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't hear you.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Get a low. Get as low as you can. He'll
[2:35:30] lift you. He'll lift you. He won't leave
[2:35:32] you there. He won't leave you there.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; He'll raise you up. He is the glory and
[2:35:37] the lifter of my hands.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you exalt yourself,
[2:35:45] you'll find yourself on the bottom.
[2:35:47] That's right.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; But if he exalts you,
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; If he raises you up,
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; if he lifts you up, that's what he was
[2:35:55] doing today.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord fell there.
[2:35:58] Jacob, different ones. That's him. He's
[2:36:00] coming to say, "I want I don't want you
[2:36:02] down there all along. I don't want you
[2:36:04] to stay down there. I want to lift you
[2:36:07] up. I want to give you a little hope.
[2:36:10] God, we got to go." He said, he said he
[2:36:13] went in
[2:36:18] 220 anointed with certain perfumes. His
[2:36:22] clothes made holy ghost fil registered
[2:36:25] hands made his clothes rose of sharon
[2:36:27] anointing all poured on his head ran all
[2:36:29] down his beard down over his place royal
[2:36:31] perfume of pomegranate the bail taking
[2:36:33] the blood of an innocent lamb and he
[2:36:35] dared to approach that veil outside he'd
[2:36:38] die right there where he was standing.
[2:36:39] So he had to go walk in a certain way.
[2:36:41] Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. I tell
[2:36:44] you, we we don't have to we don't have
[2:36:45] to speculate. It was a trembling.
[2:36:50] It wasn't some performance.
[2:36:53] It wasn't some waltz.
[2:36:56] It wasn't some three steps forward and
[2:36:58] two steps back. He was the very essence
[2:37:01] of who he was was responding to the
[2:37:04] divine presence of almighty God behind
[2:37:06] that veil. And when his body began to
[2:37:09] tremble first from the inside out, those
[2:37:11] bells begin to jingle.
[2:37:14] And when those bells began to cry, holy,
[2:37:16] holy, holy unto the Lord, it wasn't him.
[2:37:20] It was something else. It was his
[2:37:23] reverence. It was his It was his
[2:37:24] dedication to humility,
[2:37:28] encountering the living God. It's
[2:37:31] powerful. He'd die right there. He said,
[2:37:33] "Taking the blood of innocent lamb, he
[2:37:35] dared to approach that veil outside.
[2:37:37] He'd die right there where he was
[2:37:38] standing." So he had to go walk in a
[2:37:40] certain way approaching God. And he went
[2:37:42] there and offered the blood on the mercy
[2:37:43] seat once a year. Say it. Once a year.
[2:37:46] And while he was in there, he's
[2:37:47] privileged to see the sheck glory. When
[2:37:50] the pillar of fire, the amber light that
[2:37:52] came down,
[2:37:56] greenish yellow,
[2:38:00] amber light,
[2:38:03] not reddish orange. It's not fire, it's
[2:38:07] amber.
[2:38:09] Led the children of Israel out of
[2:38:12] Israel. He even smoked up the temple
[2:38:15] so no one could see. The glory of the
[2:38:17] Lord fell till it was all smoked up. He
[2:38:19] came in himself, went in behind the
[2:38:21] veil, settled down on the mercy seat in
[2:38:23] the holiest of holies. Didn't he say,
[2:38:24] didn't God say, didn't God Almighty say,
[2:38:27] "I'll meet you in there
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; between the wings of a cherry beam."
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[2:38:37] Oh, how the congregation must have
[2:38:39] envied him.
[2:38:43] It was really nothing to envy.
[2:38:48] It ought moments. Him, let him go.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus died, listen, come on,
[2:38:54] don't go to bed yet.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; The temple ve
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; not because a priest tore it.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It didn't It didn't rip from
[2:39:04] the bottom up.
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible's clear. from the top down
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; because something higher, something
[2:39:10] holier, something above,
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; something that was not humanity
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; rip ripped that veil. The veil that that
[2:39:18] God himself instituted, the veil that
[2:39:20] God designed, the veil that God told him
[2:39:22] to put there, but when a better way was
[2:39:24] made,
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; not only high priest, but look at that.
[2:39:30] Look at that. Whosoever will can have
[2:39:33] that same anointing of the sheckchana
[2:39:35] glory and walk a holy life. Don't miss
[2:39:37] that. Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord and
[2:39:40] approach in the very presence of God
[2:39:42] through the blood of Jesus Christ before
[2:39:45] him. And the saints said,
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; "Let's go.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for one tiny little place.
[2:40:02] I know you're numb.
[2:40:04] I don't feel my legs anymore, so I must
[2:40:06] be numb, too.
[2:40:09] I know they're there somewhere.
[2:40:12] I wanted just to read one little tiny.
[2:40:14] It's real small, but I don't see it. If
[2:40:17] it's not the will of the Lord, it'll
[2:40:19] keep.
[2:40:23] Hallelujah.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's life to me.
[2:40:31] Well, I don't see it. It's just one
[2:40:33] little tiny thing.
[2:40:38] Just a sweet little quotation
[2:40:45] between the wings of the cherry.
[2:40:51] I will meet you there. Oh, here it is.
[2:40:56] Right in my face.
[2:40:58] calling Jesus on the scene.
[2:41:01] But when the blood cell was broke, I
[2:41:03] want you to know what he did. No more
[2:41:06] lambs, no more goats, no more bulocks
[2:41:09] had to die. But when the blood cell was
[2:41:11] broke in Jesus Christ, I want somebody
[2:41:14] to tell me what was released.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; It wasn't goat life.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't lamb life.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; It wasn't bullet life.
[2:41:25] God,
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; deity,
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; eternity
[2:41:32] was released.
[2:41:34] Now, wouldn't you want some of that to
[2:41:36] fall on you?
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; Change you forever more. He was God. The
[2:41:40] blood wasn't Jewish. That blood wasn't
[2:41:42] Gentile. That was a creative blood cell,
[2:41:44] God himself. And now through that blood
[2:41:46] making a propitiation for our sin,
[2:41:48] cleanses a believer, takes all of his
[2:41:50] sins away from him as if he Amen.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; Is that what it says?
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Let's check it. Never had sin.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Justification, isn't it? Justified.
[2:42:05] Never. Justified never sin.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; Read it on. Go on. God puts them in the
[2:42:11] sea of where?
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you go fishing.
[2:42:16] Don't you go trying to dig them up.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; Not on me. Not on you. Not on your
[2:42:21] neighbor. And the same God that was upon
[2:42:25] Oh, that old song just came ringing in
[2:42:27] my ear. What sins
[2:42:31] are you talking about?
[2:42:34] I don't remember them anymore
[2:42:39] from the book of life. They've all been
[2:42:43] torn out. I don't remember them anymore.
[2:42:49] What sins are you talking about? I don't
[2:42:55] remember them anymore
[2:42:59] from the book of life. They've all been
[2:43:04] torn out. I don't remember them anymore.
[2:43:09] One more time. When the devil says you
[2:43:11] sin, what sins are you talking about? I
[2:43:17] don't remember them anymore
[2:43:20] [Music]
[2:43:22] from the book of life. They've all been
[2:43:27] torn out. I don't remember them anymore.
[2:43:32] One more time. Oh, what sins?
[2:43:38] [Music]
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, you sound good.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; You sound good.
[2:43:46] Look,
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; they've all been torn out. I don't
[2:43:53] remember them anymore.
[2:43:57] Hallelujah.
[2:44:00] Clap your hands for Jesus.
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:14] Oh, isn't he good? We're done.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; We're done.
[2:44:21] This week, we went down to the storage
[2:44:24] and and dug out the pulpit and the
[2:44:28] altar.
[2:44:30] Both of them at least 90 years old.
[2:44:35] It was the pulpit and the altar from the
[2:44:39] old Bellwood Assembly of God Church in
[2:44:40] Columbus. The altar bench is the altar
[2:44:44] bench that my grandmother knelt at in
[2:44:47] the Bellwood church and received the
[2:44:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1949.
[2:44:52] And the pull pit was also the pull pit.
[2:44:55] She she was offered the altar and it
[2:44:59] became the altar in in the church on
[2:45:01] Hamilton Road and the pullpit became the
[2:45:05] pullpit and it was that pullpit that my
[2:45:08] Bible was laying on before I just young
[2:45:13] and and uh the fire the cos of fire were
[2:45:16] laid on that altar by little sister
[2:45:18] Cotney on the on the Bible on the pull
[2:45:21] pit and I hadn't seen that pullpit in a
[2:45:24] long time. In fact, we didn't think we
[2:45:25] were going to see it because it was
[2:45:28] under a mountain of empty boxes,
[2:45:31] but they found it and Brother Truman is
[2:45:34] tightening it up and fixing it up so
[2:45:36] that we can use that as the podium for
[2:45:38] the banquet.
[2:45:40] And I said to Brother Truman, I now if I
[2:45:43] could just have the old-timers
[2:45:46] back to stand behind it that I remember
[2:45:49] standing behind it. When it come time
[2:45:52] for choir, they didn't have no robes.
[2:45:56] They didn't have no trained voices. They
[2:45:59] didn't even have a practice.
[2:46:01] The choir was everybody,
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't stay at their seat.
[2:46:07] That wasn't right. This is how I was
[2:46:09] raised. They said, "We're going to call
[2:46:11] the choir." And I know visitors was
[2:46:14] looking for the robe.
[2:46:17] And everybody just got up out of their
[2:46:18] seat and started walking over behind the
[2:46:20] piano.
[2:46:22] And there'd be 15, sometimes four or
[2:46:24] five, but 15, 20, 25. There'd still be
[2:46:27] lots, you know, some that wouldn't go
[2:46:29] and they and that was the choir. And
[2:46:31] they would sing them old songs and mean
[2:46:35] it.
[2:46:36] Mean it. Never saw folks sleeping.
[2:46:40] Ne never saw folks on their phones. Of
[2:46:43] course not. Disengaged or looking for
[2:46:47] something else, reading a novel or
[2:46:48] whatever. folks were so glad to be in
[2:46:51] the presence of the Lord because times
[2:46:53] were pretty hard
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; and these were hardworking people in the
[2:46:56] mill and they they they needed hope.
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, you reminded me, I have
[2:47:04] to be honest, when you joined in on that
[2:47:05] song, it took me way back because I
[2:47:08] thought I heard somebody sing it like
[2:47:09] they meant it. I thought I heard
[2:47:12] somebody here today sing it like they
[2:47:13] meant it.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; What sins?
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. You're standing in his
[2:47:20] presence waiting on the book to be
[2:47:21] opened and your page to be read and he's
[2:47:24] just
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; it's not here.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; It's not here. And finally, he looks
[2:47:29] down at you and he says, "What sins are
[2:47:30] you talking about? I don't remember them
[2:47:32] anymore. They're not even written here.
[2:47:34] They're gone. It is as though you never
[2:47:37] sinned." That's the grace of of
[2:47:39] justification.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; I want to sing this chorus. I know that
[2:47:43] you've got plenty to sing with him, but
[2:47:45] I want to sing one more chorus while I
[2:47:48] can before I sit down. Help me. When he
[2:47:52] sees
[2:47:54] me,
[2:47:55] he sees the blood of the lamb.
[2:48:01] He sees me
[2:48:04] as worthy
[2:48:06] and not as I am.
[2:48:12] He views me
[2:48:14] in garments
[2:48:16] made white
[2:48:19] as the snow.
[2:48:21] For the lamb of God is worthy
[2:48:26] and he washed me this high. Let's go up
[2:48:31] and sing just when he sees
[2:48:36] me. He sees the blood of the lamb.
[2:48:42] Oh, he sees me
[2:48:45] as worthy
[2:48:48] and not as
[2:48:51] I am.
[2:48:53] He views me
[2:48:56] and garments
[2:48:58] made white
[2:49:00] as the snow.
[2:49:03] For the lamb of God is worthy.
[2:49:08] And he washed me. This I know.
[2:49:14] Just a little bit.
[2:49:16] Looking down through
[2:49:19] the ages.
[2:49:21] God beheld
[2:49:23] the dying soul.
[2:49:26] Sin had brought separation,
[2:49:31] and never more
[2:49:34] could man behold.
[2:49:37] There must come
[2:49:40] a lamb,
[2:49:42] one whose blood alone redeems,
[2:49:47] bringing gifts to
[2:49:50] the father
[2:49:52] of the souls made white and clean. And
[2:49:57] when he sees,
[2:50:01] he sees the blood
[2:50:08] He sees me
[2:50:13] and not as I really am.
[2:50:18] Oh, he views me.
[2:50:24] Maywe
[2:50:25] [Music]
[2:50:27] has the snow
[2:50:29] for the lamb
[2:50:31] of God is worthy.
[2:50:34] And he washed me. This I know.
[2:50:40] Give me the verse. So he left that holy
[2:50:45] city,
[2:50:47] traveling on
[2:50:50] to the cross just to bridge the gul to
[2:50:55] glory.
[2:50:57] He came to rescue
[2:51:00] all the lost.
[2:51:02] By his blood, he entered into
[2:51:07] the throne room
[2:51:12] and on the mercy seat. He placed
[2:51:17] salvation.
[2:51:19] Well, glory.
[2:51:22] And when he see
[2:51:25] [Music]
[2:51:26] he see of the blood of the lamb.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; You see me views me as worthy
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; and not as I am.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; And not as I am.
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; He views me.
[2:51:43] &gt;&gt; He views me
[2:51:45] in garments
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; made white. made white
[2:51:50] as the snow for the lamb.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; For the lamb of God is worthy.
[2:51:57] And he wash me. This I know. And when he
[2:52:03] sees
[2:52:06] me,
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; he sees the blood.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; He sees the blood of the lamb.
[2:52:13] He sees me
[2:52:16] as worthy
[2:52:18] and not as I am.
[2:52:23] He views me in garments
[2:52:28] made white
[2:52:30] as the snow.
[2:52:33] For the lamb
[2:52:35] of God is worthy
[2:52:38] and he washed me. This I know.
[2:52:46] [Music]
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; I saw the Lord
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; seated on his throne.
[2:53:11] And he was clothed in glory,
[2:53:15] [Music]
[2:53:19] exalted
[2:53:21] high.
[2:53:26] And the train of his robe,
[2:53:33] it filled the temple.
[2:53:38] Oh,
[2:53:40] and the angels
[2:53:43] circled around him
[2:53:49] and cry
[2:53:56] that you
[2:54:00] are
[2:54:01] holy.
[2:54:04] [Music]
[2:54:06] Oh,
[2:54:07] so
[2:54:09] holy.
[2:54:12] Oh, you
[2:54:15] are you are holy
[2:54:19] Lord
[2:54:20] of all.
[2:54:26] And
[2:54:28] you
[2:54:30] are
[2:54:32] holy.
[2:54:35] Oh,
[2:54:39] holy.
[2:54:42] Oh, you
[2:54:45] are you are holy,
[2:54:48] Lord of all.
[2:54:52] [Music]
[2:54:55] For woe
[2:54:57] is me,
[2:55:02] for I'm unclean.
[2:55:09] For my eyes have seen
[2:55:16] the holy
[2:55:18] king.
[2:55:19] [Music]
[2:55:22] But then he cleansed my lips
[2:55:28] [Music]
[2:55:29] right before my eyes
[2:55:36] in the pillar show.
[2:55:43] As the angels
[2:55:46] cry,
[2:55:48] "Holy is the lamb.
[2:55:52] You
[2:55:53] are
[2:55:56] [Music]
[2:55:58] oh so holo.
[2:56:00] [Music]
[2:56:02] Oh,
[2:56:05] you
[2:56:07] are. You are holy
[2:56:11] Lord of all.
[2:56:17] Oh,
[2:56:19] you
[2:56:21] are you are holy
[2:56:26] and holy.
[2:56:28] [Music]
[2:56:32] Oh, you
[2:56:35] are
[2:56:36] the holy
[2:56:38] Lord of all.
[2:56:42] [Music]
[2:56:45] For woe is me.
[2:56:51] For I'm unclean.
[2:56:58] For my eyes have seen
[2:57:04] the holy king.
[2:57:11] But then he cleans my lips
[2:57:17] right before my eyes.
[2:57:24] And then the pillars show
[2:57:30] and the angels
[2:57:33] cry.
[2:57:36] Holy are you lamb.
[2:57:39] You
[2:57:41] are
[2:57:42] holy.
[2:57:46] Oh
[2:57:49] holy.
[2:57:52] Oh, you
[2:57:54] are you are holy
[2:57:57] Lord of all.
[2:58:05] And you
[2:58:08] are
[2:58:10] holy,
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; oh so
[2:58:17] holy,
[2:58:20] holy. You
[2:58:22] are you are holy
[2:58:26] Lord of all.
[2:58:31] Lord, as we stand in your presence
[2:58:34] today,
[2:58:35] our hearts are full with the revelation
[2:58:39] of what you have accomplished on our
[2:58:42] behalf.
[2:58:44] And we are not here today to push the
[2:58:46] limit. We're here, Lord, to hang our
[2:58:49] head down, to lay down, to be humble
[2:58:52] before you, and to say, Lord,
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; it's up to you. It's on you to lift us.
[2:58:57] It's on you to help us. Yes, Lord.
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; We just want to get as low as we
[2:59:01] possibly can
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; so that you the way down, the way up is
[2:59:05] to go down.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we thank you for the holiness
[2:59:09] and for the awe of God and the
[2:59:11] reverential fear of the Lord that fills
[2:59:14] our lives. We just want to say it's you.
[2:59:18] You paid the price. You had the plan.
[2:59:22] Your grace is sufficient. And you are
[2:59:26] holy.
[2:59:28] Somebody tell him again, you are holy.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, you
[2:59:34] are
[2:59:37] [Music]
[2:59:39] [Laughter]
[2:59:42] so
[2:59:44] holy.
[2:59:47] You
[2:59:49] are
[2:59:51] holy
[2:59:53] Lord
[2:59:54] of all.
[2:59:58] And Isaiah said, "For woe is me."
[3:00:05] [Music]
[3:00:06] &gt;&gt; For Ian,
[3:00:09] [Music]
[3:00:12] &gt;&gt; my lips,
[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; for my eyes have seen.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; Cleanse them today, Lord. Lay the altar,
[3:00:21] the whole
[3:00:23] &gt;&gt; on our lips like you did for Isaiah.
[3:00:27] But then he claims my limbs.
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; Woe here and woe there.
[3:00:34] &gt;&gt; Right before my eyes.
[3:00:44] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that should be the most
[3:00:46] grateful. As the angels
[3:00:50] cry,
[3:00:53] holy is the lamb.
[3:00:56] You
[3:00:58] are
[3:01:00] holy.
[3:01:07] Holy,
[3:01:10] you
[3:01:12] are
[3:01:14] holy
[3:01:15] Lord of all.
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:21] Lord, prepare our hearts.
[3:01:24] We're getting ready even today for a
[3:01:27] divine appointment with you in the
[3:01:29] coming week. And we want you to remind
[3:01:33] us, Lord. And may we find grace to
[3:01:36] remind ourselves of what you have
[3:01:38] accomplished on our behalf and that all
[3:01:42] we have to do is just find a little
[3:01:44] protocol.
[3:01:46] &gt;&gt; Make sure that all the dead cats are off
[3:01:49] the line and that everything is right
[3:01:52] between us and you and that we're not
[3:01:55] carrying any offense
[3:01:58] &gt;&gt; in our heart toward any brother,
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; toward any sister.
[3:02:03] You've called us Lord to gather next
[3:02:07] week in the evening for communion and
[3:02:12] it's been some time and
[3:02:15] we want it to be a very thoughtful and
[3:02:19] sacred moment. We don't want to wait
[3:02:22] till the last minute to to make sure
[3:02:25] that all is well.
[3:02:28] So I pray Lord today that if there's any
[3:02:32] odd in my heart or if there is anything
[3:02:34] I'm holding against someone illegally,
[3:02:38] I pray Lord that you will show me and
[3:02:40] give me grace to settle that this week
[3:02:44] as I prepare my heart to come. And
[3:02:47] though we are not a people who believe
[3:02:48] that the bread becomes the body or that
[3:02:50] the wine becomes the blood,
[3:02:53] we are taught that it is the closest
[3:02:55] example and symbol that we have on the
[3:02:58] earth of those two holy things, your
[3:03:01] your broken body and your precious
[3:03:04] blood. So when we consume them, we
[3:03:07] consume them with the hope that the
[3:03:09] healing that lays within them will
[3:03:12] somehow flood our lives.
[3:03:16] bringing physical healing to the body
[3:03:19] and a spiritual release to the heaviness
[3:03:23] of the heart and the mind. Lord, we love
[3:03:25] you supremely above all things today and
[3:03:28] we thank you for what your presence has
[3:03:30] accomplished and we just want to leave
[3:03:32] here today giving you thanks, much
[3:03:35] thanks, many thanks, heartfelt thanks
[3:03:41] for your goodness and for your mercy and
[3:03:44] for your holiness. Lord, we pray one for
[3:03:46] another even now. Would you agree with
[3:03:49] me right now for the ones beside you,
[3:03:51] Lord? And those streaming this service
[3:03:53] right now, we stand together, our faith
[3:03:56] unified together,
[3:03:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; believing, Lord, Lord,
[3:04:01] &gt;&gt; that you will bring healing and release
[3:04:04] and freedom not only to those standing
[3:04:07] in this room, but to those who are
[3:04:09] joined with us even now by faith and by
[3:04:12] internet connection. Lord, you can do
[3:04:16] it. There is no distance in prayer and
[3:04:19] there is no restraint to the to the
[3:04:22] going forth of your healing and your
[3:04:24] deliverance. We have so much to praise
[3:04:27] you for.
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; We have so much to thank you for. You've
[3:04:31] been so good. You've been so good.
[3:04:34] Hasn't he been good?
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; Would you just stretch your hands to him
[3:04:37] one more time and tell him, Lord, I
[3:04:40] thank you that you are my atonement. I
[3:04:42] thank you that you are sufficient. I
[3:04:45] thank you that the price that you paid
[3:04:47] is enough. It is enough. It is enough.
[3:04:51] You're not asking me to pay another
[3:04:52] price except to surrender, except to
[3:04:56] surrender. Except to come before your
[3:04:58] holiness
[3:04:59] with a mindfulness
[3:05:02] that sometimes I need another bloodbath.
[3:05:05] I need another sanctifying portion for
[3:05:07] my mind and for my thoughts. And you've
[3:05:11] provided that today in the atonement.
[3:05:13] And we want to give you praise. You
[3:05:17] are

[3:08:53] our eyes to you, Lord. It was just a
[3:08:55] type and a shadow of a day that the very

[3:12:56] you listening?
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:12:59] I asked Luke if there was anything that
[3:13:02] he wanted me to share and he said all
[3:13:04] the labs have come back good and they've
[3:13:07] been weaning his oxygen down and they
[3:13:10] had upped it after they put the lines in
[3:13:12] but have been bringing it down every 30
[3:13:14] minutes. He's at a 52 but they're about
[3:13:17] to lord again because he is tolerating
[3:13:20] it really well. Let's praise the Lord.
[3:13:31] Jesus, we praise you.

[3:13:57] bin of things. Uh, somebody drag it out
[3:14:00] from under that table there in the

[3:14:14] see what I like in it and I'm going to
[3:14:15] take it home myself
[3:14:17] or put it in the garbage bin. and we're
[3:14:20] not going to keep it rentree anymore.
[3:14:24] Take your stuff. Don't you strut past it
[3:14:27] and say, "I know I don't have nothing."
[3:14:29] Cuz I've had to see people humbly come
[3:14:31] back when we discovered their name
[3:14:33] written on it.
