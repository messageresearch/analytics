there right then how many of you know if you leave it to grow it'll grow it won't die on its own you have to take the grubbing hoe of the word and cut out every little part of the root make sure you don't leave any in there or it'll Sprout again he said then Satan will do his best to get among you see don't you let that happen some slick tongue fella might come along and try to take you away from it you think they could talk Moses out of the presence of God where he had stood there and seen it no sir no do you hear what he's talking about don't ever let anybody talk you out of the presence of Goden you hold on to that yes he said we don't take from it or add to it just keep keep it the way the Lord said we don't want no denomination we don't want no organizations we don't want no malice we don't want no Strife we want God and he is the word we want to serve the Lord in humility we want to love without dissimulation in the message enticing Spirits brother ad him said in paragraph 161 Jesus in his prayer said father I sanctify myself Jesus becomes Sanctified to the church he could have gotten married but he didn't do it he becomes Sanctified that means set apart he said sanctify them Father through the truth Thy word is the truth do you believe that he said now let's lay aside every weight he said you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk oh God he said lay it there now lay it there now watch this watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away I wonder who might lay your temper on the altar of God today and let his fire fall Among Us and lick it up consume it so that it troubles you no more I I wonder who here might talk when they ought to be quiet and you'd like to lay that on the altar today and let the fire of God come and take it away he said watch the love of God the fiery love of God lick it up I like that he said watch all that old selfishness the way you've been talking to your wife we don't want to rush we want it to soak in among us the way you've been talking to your husband I noticed a few more sisters Amen on the other but I I I heard sister Beth she got hers in on your husband part she got she's not the only one that ought to do it you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor I I I gave you a chance to amen while you could cuz now it's getting rough you say well I've been talking to my husband right I've been talking to my wife right I treat my neighbor right oh that's Grand but wait he didn't stop there he said the way you've talked about the people in the church lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of God will come down and take it right away and listen and divine love Divine love will burn in its place I read that this morning because I believe every one of us would desire that in our lives that we could lay it on the altar today and divine love the fiery love of God come and burn out the chaff and let Divine love come and occupy the space where this other stuff has been he goes on to say you've got sickness lay it on the altar Lord here it is create in me a clean Spirit create in me a healing power see what God will do God will do it this morning I don't know about you but I like that I want us to go to Romans chapter 5 uh Elias just walk right up here and get that microphone for me would would you I I've got a lot of reading to do and it's not that I am too good to do all the reading but it kind of takes my voice and my breath to do it all and you do so well so be ready therefore being justified by faith this is Romans 5 verse 1- 11 we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ listen carefully by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also that means we praise we enter into the spirit we enter into his presence even in the midst of tribulations are you with me knowing that tribulation worketh patience so those of you who feel that it is really Christian to pray for patience please understand that you are praying for tribulation because the and you know what that's one thing you don't have to pray for that's right sir cuz you're going to get it anyhow what we need to pray is that the tribulation we're going through will accomplish everything that God has allowed it for so that it doesn't become way wasted trouble or wasted tribulation but so that it really works something in us including patience and that's one thing you're going to need if you serve the Lord you're going to need patience because he'll say soon and it'll be 700 years so you want patience and patience experience and experience hope every bit of it has a purpose and hope maketh not ashamed now listen because the love of God is shed abroad multiplied that's what the word means multiplied in our hearts the love of God is Multiplied in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us now I want you to know many many times in the message of the hour brother brandom is connecting the Holy Ghost with Divine love that's right and here the scripture is connecting the two because the love of God is shed abroad it is Multiplied in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so if we need more love we need more Holy Ghost amen amen yes did you know if we pray for more faith we're praying for more love brother Bram said so we're praying for more love did you know we're also praying for more faith because faith and love work by the holy spirit so here the Holy Ghost has multiplied the love of God in our hearts which is a gift it is a gift we can't earn it we can't create it we can't manufacture it we can't work it up so if we want to have more love of God in our lives we've got to have more Holy Ghost for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly they that are whole need not a physician he died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet per adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God committ ended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died us for us are you following that much more than being now Justified how by the washing of his blood we shall be saved from wrath not through good works through him not through our own righteousness but through inherited righteousness we have I I I I dreamed all through the night last night so many different dreams and in one of the different dreams one of the different sequences in a dream I was talking to some brethren about the Holy Ghost and I was talking to them about pressing all the way in until you have all of the manifestations of the holy spirit in your life and I told those Brethren including speaking in tongues it has a place I said it still has a place and I was saying that to those Brethren and then I began to talk to some others about the Divine exchange and I said do you see the Divine Exchange he gave us his life in exchange for ours who believes you got the best end of the bargain there and then he takes our effort a a a as an exchange for his righteousness he said even the best you can do is filthy rags and it leaves the tables full of vomit but I'm not going to leave you naked Hallelujah I'm not going to leave you in unrighteousness I'm going to take what little bit you've got and I'm going to dress you in the righteousness of my word hallelujah so that you will be acceptable in my sight all of this works by the Holy Ghost all of this works by love much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath not not apart from him but through him for when for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life we are reconciled to God by his death we are not saved by death we are saved by his life it is the grace that God has given us he said and not only so but also joy in God how many of you know what it means to to Joy in God to rejoice in him yes yes somebody said well I just want to be very reverent well I appreciate reverence whenever I can see it I appreciate that but there's a time to Joy in the Lord there's a time to Rejoice he said rejoice and again I say unto you it's not enough to Rejoice once he said now come back and do it all over again because you're going to need that joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement do you believe you have in a message called healing line 53 he said listen here's a lovely thing as you serve one another I'm just going to I'm know I am am going to take my time I'm not going to rush I want you to hear it he said as you serve one another you're serving God see the love of God is in every Christian heart and be kind I want you to say that with me be kind to one another forgive one another Well I'm going to forgive him when he ask you know what that's not real forgiveness that's a manufactured imitation if somebody has to ask you to forgive them before you produce any forgiveness you're just you're just kind of coming up with something and and and I don't I want you to know we don't need something we can just make up on our own we need the grace of God to be present in our lives and we need to forgive before we're asked but because we don't want anything to encumber us or to wait us down as we run toward the prize forgive one another he said if you don't see the scriptures just alike I wish everybody who claims to believe this message could hear this quotation and do something about it this morning because there are too many divisions among all of those who believe they have the whole truth if you don't see the scripture just aik or you don't see the seven seal just alike or you don't see the Thunders just alike or you're not sure how many Souls you have well you believe anyhow and pray for the other person and just love one another you'll find there's even if your guitar player stand up love the other churches even if they do specials different than you do even if they run and you don't run and they dance and you don't dance and even if you happen to hear you're streaming their service and you hear just a little bit of tongue talking instead of getting so worked up and and passing your your clips and reels around to one another and and making fun of each other brother brandom said pray for the other person and just love one another he said you'll find their 's no greater evidence of a Christian in the world than love in 1 John chapter 4: 19 said we love him because he first loved us we wouldn't even have love in our hearts toward him had he not loved us first we can't seek God unless he's seeking us first in the message thou knowest all things I'm doing this a little quickly I I don't want to get too fast but but I want to get a lot of this out this morning so uh I don't want you to feel cheated that you're being read too a lot it's good the scriptures good these quotations are good and we need them this morning in the message thou knowest all things he said you must believe the whole thing laid in faith Jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but already but already passed from death into life do you believe that he said Do you believe that's the truth there it lays there isn't nothing else that you can do only believe and if you believe then them little immoral things will just drop off like that he said as you believe you become love love is not what we do love is who we become and love is God and you begin to wh yourself don't say love is just like God love isn't just like God God God is love love is God and you begin to to do what to wind yourself into Christ he said in these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves didn't you just read this recently past I did guess what I'm reading it again there's just no desire to do it the worshipper having Purge has no more conscious or desire of sin see the worshipper once purged he said see what I mean now I want us to go to Matthew Chapter 5 I want to read three or four verses to you verse 43 through 46 I can't give it to you in red letter but I want you to know that every bit of what I'm about to read are the words of Jesus Christ the Bible in itself is inspired but these are these are the words words right out of the lips of the master he said ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you read for me elas but I say unto you love your enemies love your enemies go ahead bless them that curse you bless them that Cur curse you do good to them that hate you do good and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you I I want you to know that's easy to read that's easy to repeat that might be easy to memorize but it's going to take some Grace to do it pray for them who despitefully use you sir pray for them who persecute you pray for your enemy love them bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you read on brother that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust get another verse for if you love them which love you if you love them that love you what reward have ye what have you done what do you think you've done if you love somebody who loves you that's easy to do isn't it yes sir what did Jesus say Do not even the publicans the same the the publicans the religious on the religious they they do the same they love those that love them Jesus said I'm going to have some people that don't just love those who love them they're going to love those that hate them I want you to know that takes God in the message influence read that one for me will you Ellas paragraph 109 influence New York New York reverence reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother sister and love one another with Undying Love undying love you say well I just I I I just can't well just stay here a little longer and then you will like people too uhoh ohoh this is where I struggle I'm going to be transparent did you know I love people I don't like there's quite a few come on now I need some water on brother brother brandom said you're not evidently he's telling us you're not going to get by with that you just stay in this presence until you begin to like the people too boy we're going to have to have some more worship Services I'm going to have to get in that presence more read on Ellas you'll love those who doesn't love you that's really a good sign of Christianity when you can from your heart from your heart love those who does not love you love the unlovable do what love the unlovable now I want you to read for me Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 85 through 87 let's see what he said there cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love divine love that's a goo yes the noun is agapo the verb is agape that's God's love divine love brother brandham sometimes referred to it as Divine love multiple times he called it Divine love a few times he called it perfect love he called it Divine love many more times than he called it perfect love perfect love is simply mature love yes and in order for us to have mature love we're going to have to have God's love because it's grown up yes God's love is grown up you hear what I'm saying God's love doesn't behave like a child when I was a child you understand that's the love chapter right when I was a child love perfect love divine love is grownup love read on Elias to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another that's right read on this will all man know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together stay right together the enemy will try to divide you as a family of God brother brandom said stay right together read on brother if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life I you you you got to read that again because if I read that right it's telling me that a root of bitterness in my life can affect the other brother read on go back and read it again paragraph 86 if the brother you think you think he's a little wrong or the sisters say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness don't let me have the root of bitterness spring up that's good read on cuz it'll affect him him it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life right out of my life the prophet is telling us that if we carry a root of bitter Bess towards somebody a brother or a sister it will affect them but it'll take the Christ right out of us somebody said I sure do uh uh love that person in the Lord they like to add that in the Lord but I'd like to give that person a real piece of my mind well I want to tell you some of us are running short we've given so much of our mind to everybody else that we're running a little bit short so we better hold on to our pieces of Mind hello and we better ask the Lord to help us to get every root of bitterness out of us because it will affect the other person and it'll cause Christ to move right out of our life if you really saw it church if I could really see this as serious as he presented it there's no way in the world we would let a week go by with something in our life toward one another that's right because nobody wants Christ to move out of their life if you understood that just that can cause Christ to move out of your life you'd want to make that right wouldn't you read on brother that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you jealousy is cruler than the grave jealousy will destroy a church you comparing your life to somebody else well he gets by with such and such and such but I better not do I wouldn't dare get by she gets by look at what they do look at what he wears look at what she wears and you let that jealousy begin to build up in your heart you become critical toward your brother or your sister Christ starts moving out of your life and that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred it just starts boiling in you how many of you know that's just boiling a Boiling Pot of acid read on brother that will just do what it'll take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll drive the Holy Spirit right out of the Tabernacle it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that all right now read the next paragraph 87 you just wax that much closer together draw up the take the Buckle as the brother testified that's Brother Cleveland that he's talking about that's the brother who witnessed the message to me he had the the experience with the Lord concerning the belt buckle remember and brother brandham pointed it out in a testimony service and showed him that that belt buckle appears on the on the photograph where the lies grow you've seen that picture and that's what he's referring to back in this in this take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision go ahead just that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow love anybody here not a southerner and you need me to help you with this vernacular love one another anyhow everybody got that talk nice talk nice about one another come on right brother read on brother ellias you're making it hard on us say nice things about one another and then God will bless you you want how many of you want to be blessed think of something good somebody said I'd have to lie no every human being on the planet has something something somebody said well that person's late all the time I can't think of nothing good to say about that person what you ought to say is well that person is gets preached on and I don't so I want to thank the Lord for that person CU they keep the heat off of me hello there's all always something nice something kind something good you may have to say like I do that person keeps me on my prayer bones they make sure I always stay prayed through find something kind and what will God do he'll bless you now uh Matthew Chapter 5 same chapter verse 47 and 48 in red letter and if you salute your brethren only why what do you more than others do not even the Publican Soul if you salute your brethren only if you only go and greet those who you get along with you're do doing no different than the Sadducees and the Pharisees you're doing nothing more than the publicans you're doing nothing more than the religious you you've got to be willing to salute not only your brethren those you click with those you get along with you've also got to greet salute those that you don't right now I I I want you to look at that word salute just a moment I think I I gave it to him it's asomi and it means to treat with affection did you know you can always say God bless you the random says one of the most powerful things you can say to somebody God bless you to treat with affection to engage in hospitable recognition of another with varying degrees of intimacy to greet to welcome to pay respects to greet with kindness everybody deserves a handshake sir even if you know somebody's working against you it's in your favor it's in your good to try to greet that person anyway right and brother it can cost you something but you've got to be willing to do it anyway now I want to read the next verse of Matthew 548 he said be ye therefore what did we say perfect means in the Greek mature be ye therefore mature perfect complete even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you you can have mature love and not salute everybody that should be saluted in in first John chap 2 verse 10 and 11 I don't want this to be so dry I I hope you're with me first John 2: 10 and 11 he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knowe not whether he goeth because that Darkness hath blinded his eyes in from that time brother elas read paragraph 27 we must love we must love divinely love one another then you don't see your brother's mistakes okay oh okay you want to know whether or not you're exercising Divine love what do you think about when you think about that brother didn't I just try to do this with you couple weeks ago what's the first thing that comes to your mind his mistake his shortcoming his failure or do you think of something he gets right we must divinely love one another then you don't see your brother's mistake you do everything within your power to look over your brother's mistake and to see see him for who he really is God's child in the making that's right he hasn't allowed perhaps tribulation to work enough patience in his life but it's coming yes sir so you make sure you treat him right because God loves him so much that he's going to perfect him and so we must treat him as God would treat him worthy valuable if he does make a mistake read brother ellias what we what we should do if he does make a mistake you never you look over the top of you look right over the top of it and do what you love him anyhow love him anyhow see that's it that's it love those that love you then does not the sinner the same thing right but love those who doesn't love you that's what shows the spirit of God is in you yes yes yes cuz he loved you when you were his enemies think about it think about it think about it it and he loved you yes and that spirit's in you yes it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend when that Holy Spirit is in you it'll make you love your enemy just the same way you would love your friend read the prophet Elisha to us please and now here is one point that I wish to stress on for a few moments that is concerning Believers hooking themselves up with unbelievers belie Believers partnering hooking themsel up with unbelievers doesn't why it doesn't work it doesn't work can everybody hear what the prophet is saying it doesn't work for believers to be hooked up with unbelievers if the first thing you think of is marriage then that's great but remember it's way more than just marriage this is any kind of partnership this is any kind of Covenant that we make with unbelievers it's a dangerous thing to do God isn't pleased with it he goes on to say God has said come out from among the unbelief that's right see you can't associate night and day together come on neither can you associate belief and unbelief together and when you find unbelief it's accompanied by hatred this is the problem this is why they have an international day of hate because unbelief is present and where unbelief is you can expect hatred to show up read on if you find faith if you find Faith it's accompanied by Love For Love creates faith I I want you to hear that love creates Faith all right brother and without and without faith why you can't have love so if you want more faith you yield yourself to more love if you need more love if you then you yield yourself to Faith because they begat one another they bring forth and manifest one another can we have a few more quotations here do you now believe paragraph 27 now there's two different kinds of love there's human love which in Greek word is a F love and then agapo love the is the high love the high love of divine love or Divine that's good now you take the F love when we have that love a mother for her baby will drive her right straight to a flaming fire to save that baby's life right it will make a man for his sweetheart lay down his life anytime see what I mean it's that's just human love right I believe somewhere in the Bible it said could a mother forget her little suckling babe right said you may but I can never forget you yes for you're engraved on the palms of my hand yes so how could God ever forsake us or anything as long as he loves us like that all right now just continue in where Pentecost failed paragraph 62 he goes back to those two kind of Love read that right out for us love God is love he that loveth is of god Divine love not affectionate love there's two different kinds of love now we know we get into this here free love and all kinds of stuff called love but that's not Divine love that's a mockery of the devil yes you know that right there's two different loves there's a love called fileo F love right and there is a love called agapa love that's right a fileo love the Greek word means the love like I would have for you as a fellow or my wife for you have for your wife a fileo love now that love if you'd catch a you'd be jealous of her listen if you catch a man insulting her you'd kill the man for it that's fileo love that's strong love love but agaba love would make you pray for his lost soul I think that's a great example I think brother brandom has really touched the best example of the contrast between the two loves that that Earthly love would make you almost be willing to kill a man because he insulted your wife but Divine love would provoke you to pray for that man's lost soul how many of you understand why we need that agapo love he said that's a difference that's where people don't understand read on see it ain't some kind of an effectual worked up mental condition it's absolutely genuine holy spirit of God that binds our hearts together in Christian fellowship and love that's love and holy spirit together again keep reading this is the message why paragraph 21 see God show showed me that in my own heart wasn't right because I was trying to condemn her and not looking at what I come from to now you'll remember this story I'm not going into all the details but remember brother brandom is coming into this place there's a lot of things going on there are Law Enforcement Officers there doing like they really ought not to be doing here is a woman sitting at a table brother brandom has something that comes on him to judge that woman remember and and said God showed me in my own heart wasn't right because I was trying to condemn her and not looking at what I come from to we should never lose sight of where we were when he found us and we ought to remember that the same God who delivered us out of the hell hole is able to deliver somebody else be willing to fight in the spirit in prayer and believe God brother brandham was really convicted here and God showed him his own heart read on brother elas so we can always remember look back to the pits where we was HED from that's right things will look a lots different see we don't want to condemn no one love everybody yes whenever you lose that real genuine love that's in your heart You' you've lost everything you've lost everything when you've lost that genuine love that's in your heart just don't never forget that that when you lose love it's all gone if you're here this morning and you recognize that your love for the Brethren or your love for the Lost has left you you don't have to leave here today Loveless you pray like we started with and let the fiery love of God come down on the Altar and lick up everything that's in us that not to be there and then let Divine love come and sit in that place this is how God has made a way for us do you believe that and I need you to get one more I know this is a lot of reading here but but I want you to get the way to have Fellowship for me paragraph 33 there's where it is tonight God has to give it then love produces a fellowship now when God said back then there the day that sin had separated that Divine love God told Adam and Eve not to eat these certain fruits and they did and sin brought separation right and sin by separation brought hatred malice Strife Envy is that right yes what happened they separated from Divine love Adam and Eve were separated from Divine love yes sir Now read on and when you separate from Divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistakes no more are we in that place Church where we cannot Overlook our brother's failures or our sister's shortcomings anymore if we are then we have separated ourself from Divine love read on brother you got to ball him out for it yeah that's right mhm you can't Overlook sister mistakes no more because you've got away from that Divine part that love part but if you really love the Lord Jesus yes if sister or brother does something to you oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it I know what you meant yes you did mean to do that come on that's the opposite here is if a brother or sister does something wrong to you in your heart you say why they didn't they didn't set out to do that that wasn't in their heart come on that's not what they meant to do that's the kind of love that Christ had yes it is Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing how many of you want that kind of love in your heart this morning are you still with me let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 beginning in verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers we call that a five-fold Ministry it's important you see in in this hour of uh of popularity for press play and Obey we can't ignore this part of the word the perfecting of the Saints doesn't come just by press play and Obey it comes by by a Ministry of Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists somebody said well that's talking about brother Brandon I'm not even putting brother brandom in the five-fold ministry you can if you want to he wasn't a five-fold prophet you please understand that's not where he fits and that's that's why it says with an S Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists and why is that five-fold Ministry sometimes referred to as the Ascension gifts because the Bible said when he ascended he that had descended he now ascends and what does he do he gives gifts unto men and that's part of this five-fold ministry and what is their purpose for the maturing say it with me for the maturing for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ now this whole concept of everybody listing to the same tape at the same time all over the world in the comfort of their home when there's a $3 million Church sitting there there's something wrong with that there's something wrong with that concept concept because Perfection doesn't come through isolation perfecting comes when we get together forsake not the assembling of yourselves together we need to be together so that we can knock the rough edges off so there's something wrong with a headquarters that now says you stay home you listen to the same tape we'll get up in the middle of the night on the other side of the world so that we can hear the tape at the same time and maybe one day we'll gather again yesterday they send out an email that says we're just waiting on the messenger to come and say there he is I believe the messenger has already said there he is pointing us to Christ so in my understanding here we don't stand a chance at being perfected by the fivefold ministry if we isolate ourselves in our homes it's a spirit it's the same spirit that that brought covid to us that tried to shut the churches down to keep us apart sir people Marvel they Marvel people are absolutely shocked when they find out that we just kept right on because we understood it's no longer an issue of Health it's an issue of control it's not the government's control that we're concerned about it's that Antichrist spirit and if there is a spirit that can keep us out from under the influence of a real genuine fivefold Ministry then the church cannot be perfected so God has given us Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what what reason for the perfecting of the Saints for the work listen folks nitty-gritty you need nitty-gritty we need a pastor we need Apostles we need evangelist we need that five-fold Ministry who'll bring it right up to 2024 see it's not I Love Lucy that we got to stay away from in this hour it's much worse than that if your only concept of Filth on television is Lucy you're living in another [Music] generation you see the Rapture is overdue but because it's overdue doesn't mean we get slack we cannot we need the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying the building up of what the body of Christ till how long how long will there be a five-fold Ministry till we all somebody say all what does all mean you think all means all till we all come the bride till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto and that's not a bunch of perfect men coming together to worship unto a perfect man that's Jesus Christ amen he is the stature of the perfect man we're we're raising up to that unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ I want to read that verse again till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ until we are matured Perfection is not without mistake that's not even what it means here it's not meaning without mistake you may make mistakes it means maturity we're coming to maturity the things that hurt our feelings the things that hurt our feelings in the past don't hurt our feelings anymore because we're becoming unoffendable we realize God will have to take care of that God will have to deal with that well I didn't get my thank you I didn't get recognized I didn't get a candy bar see we're coming to maturity and it's not an easy climb it's only by his grace that we can climb as long as you pet people's feelings hello come on as long as you massage people's feelings and call that love you'll remain stagnant come on brother Venom's preaching away he said what is that that Spirit over here is calling out to that Spirit over there the devil want sympathy the devil wants somebody to feel sorry for him you get under that Spirit folks well I'm just overworked well I'm just over stressed well I'm just really going through a hard time I'm really in a battle I want you to point your finger to somebody in in this house that's not overworked I want you to find here for me somebody that's not stressed would you show me somebody that hadn't fought the devil all week to get back to church today then you are not the only one and it is not sympathy you need it's Deliverance you need to be free from that Spirit that'll tell you that everybody is against you and everybody hates you and you ought to just eat worms no you ought to run to God and become undefendable I don't go to church to be recognized I go to church to serve God come on woo let me get back to the notes a mature man a perfect man let's look at what that word perfect there means here's what it means so if you see anything in this that indicates without mistake or without Humanity then I'll adjust what I'm saying but it doesn't mean that at all it means a full age it means brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult a full age mature now the kind of love that we've got to press into is the mature kind the kind that is not fickle the kind that is not Prejudice the kind that doesn't impede us it propels us it advances us are you with me this morning in the message is this the end of the uh uh is this the sign of the end sir is what they're calling it now in 62 he said you remember the P pyramid message he said it's the Capstone yes what did it do the Holy Spirit kept off the individual and seal it when we added to our faith righteousness godliness and faith and so forth brother Bam's not pulling up the virtues here but he's giving us some examples and he said and kept adding to it till we got seven things when you read the stature of a perfect man or you listen to brother Ram or you go to Peter and read it for yourself it's not like you stand in line to get a a a portion of all of these things the holy spirit said to us years ago it's a birth you're not standing in line with a cup hoping the Lord will give you more godliness you're going to have to be birthed from virtue to Virtue it's a climbing Expedition we're moving up into the stature of the fullness of Christ the stature of the perfect man and in order to do that it's a squeeze yes now anybody in this room that's ever given birth or ever watch to birth will tell you there is no Deliverance there is no birth without a squeeze it's a contraction and when this little bride is contracted is squeezed from one of these virtues to the next to the next to the next to the next it's still not enough because we come up to the top and we're still missing something right we have godliness and then brotherly kindness and we are still missing something and so brother brandham wrote on the on the diagram Holy Spirit we've got to have the Holy Spirit to come and cap us to get ready to receive the headstone yes the holy spirit is in the Gap the holy spirit is wrote at the top and then comes the headstone or the Capstone and the Capstone is Love The Headstone is perfect love the top of of the pyramid it's kept with Divine love you can't demonstrate the fullness of mature love divine love perfect love until you have moved from one virtue up to the next virtue to the next virtue to the next virtue if these virtues I won't stay on this long is it'll get quieter quiet if these virtues are the Thunders like so many people preach they were supposed to produce more in us than they have produced thus far sir sir somebody's missing something somewhere because we've had the perfect word and the bride is still immature we're going to need more of the Holy Ghost we're going to need more of the grace of God if brother Brandon put Holy Ghost right up there at the top then that means we haven't moved past the Holy Ghost now what we have moved past is trying to speak in tongues that's what he said it's a direct quote we're no longer trying to speak in tonu we're not trying to exercise the gifts we have now come to a place where God can exercise whatever he wants to exercise in us for the edification of the body of Christ so it's no longer a a striving or a human effort to try to make some Pentecostal sensation it's more than that we're now Reaching Forward for the final baptism of the Holy Ghost which is one that doesn't come with emotion or feeling it comes with perfection in completion and it's not coming that seal of the Holy Ghost is not coming until the conductor opens up and inspects the car you hear what he said there's a manifest there's an invoice on the train car and everything that's on there add to your faith virtue come on it's all written there on the on on the Manifest it's all written there on the invoice and if that conductor comes along and sees something missing he will not seal the cart once he seals that car and writes the destination on the seal it can't be open anymore until it reaches its destination so there is something yet the bride is reaching for we sing we're sealed We Believe believe that we're sealed we testify that we're sealed but we cannot have the fullness of the seal if something's missing on the Manifest so we're asking the Lord whatever it takes I know it sounds like a foolish prayer but it's the only prayer I can think of that's going to get us where we need to be whatever it takes Lord to move me from Faith to Virtue yes whatever it takes Lord to move me up into that kindness to move me through that godliness where brother brandom said it's just like God so that the Holy Ghost can come sit on top of this little bride and call the Capstone and here it comes Hallelujah here it comes Zechariah prophesied here it comes not with shouts of Grace Church AG Grace is not going to put this Bride In The Rapture the grace that God extended to the church ages is not enough to get this little bride out of here it's going to take bride Grace it's going to take zachariah's double Grace the Capstone comes with shouts of Grace Grace which is perfecting Grace it's completion Grace Hallelujah and if you don't need extra Grace yet hang on right how many of you find yourself after all of these years of serving the lord needing more Grace today than you've ever needed I need more Grace today than I've Ever Needed in my life just to keep me pressing in keep me pushing in Hallelujah I I I I've got to praise folks I've got to praise when I don't feel like praising yes so you can send out an SOS I'm dying I'm sinking I'm going under I need help or you can make up your mind I'm not doing any of that I don't intend to go down I don't intend to fail I don't intend to quit I don't intend to give up I'm not turning around I'm holding on I'm pressing through I'm going to win this thing not by my own strength but but by his grace let your test brother BR said don't ever have a negative testimony I can't hardly hold my head up don't you have that kind of a testimony you are not going through anything but that which is common to man in the end time amen you're fighting a battle yes you are and I don't want to Discount your battle but I want to tell you the devil who tells you you're the only one is dying to you this little bride from from from Africa to Europe to the Asia to the Philippines to the United States to South America to Canada wherever she is she's fighting the same battle it's the greatest battle that has ever been fought it's in the Battlefield of the Mind and you can win you can shut the liar down come on you can shut the liar down not by woing not by woing by testifying of his grace in your life I'm making this thing come on I'm not falling down I'm coming up he goes on we added to our faith righteousness godliness faith and so forth and kept adding this is the last quote is this the sign of the end time till we got we kept adding to it till we got seven things you see that and the seventh one was love which is God don't forget he wrote Holy Ghost that's right that Gap there that ceiling of the Holy Ghost got to have him got to have him we've got to have him we have one baptism we have many refilling of the Holy Ghost that brings us up through the stature of a perfect man to that hour of the ceiling somebody said well I I hear them talking about we're already sealed sing it testify it tell it somebody said that's a lie it's not a lie we're not talking about uh uh uh what it looks like what it smells like what it sounds like we're speaking Faith well I know I've been sealed till the day of redemption what are you singing when you sing it's already done it's already done what are you doing when you saying I'm already healed are you saying you have no symptoms left no you're saying the word said I'm Healed when you sing with brother RDL when you sing my family is sealed what are you singing they're all saved baptized in Jesus name filled with the Holy Ghost and going to church every Sunday no because that's not the reality you're singing about you're singing by faith my family is sealed they may look back slid to you but God said they're sealed come on you're talking faith brother bandam said you just leave this perline saying I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed say it till you believe it didn't say wait on it to manifest to say it he said say it till you believe it and guess what happens when we believe it it manifests so we've got to come through these seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him come with the holy spirit amen now in the message adoption number four paragraph 101 I said oh Lord that's what I'm here at the church for trying to set the church in order telling you brother sister there's only one thing that can enter that yes that's perfect love that's the kind of church order that we need to be crying out for yes not three songs and turn off the lights while people are worshiping come on he said I've come here to set the church in order telling you brother sister there's only one thing that can enter that that's perfect love brother Billy Paul is leaving north Alabama brother Arnon West has died the father to brother Benny West he has come for the funeral he's standing on the porch of sister West granny West's home the family is gathered there the sons and the daughter are gathered there on the porch brother Billy Paul is leaving the home after the funeral in fellowship and he's looking up at them and he says oh I wish that I could tell you oh I wish that I could tell you but I promised my dad that I would never speak it to a soul he said but I'll tell you what it had to do with it had to do with perfect love that's all he said here is brother brandham telling us the only thing that can enter that is perfect love mature love yes mature love if you want to read how mature love manifest you start reading in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 that's right the kind of love that's described there is more than husband wife love right I know the church has tried to teach that uh as as fileo love but I want you to know the love that is described there is beyond human capacity that's the truth it's perfect love it's mature love he said not because you're loyal to the brandom Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or the Baptist Church notice how he puts all the churches in in the same category yeah he said them's all right you should be but oh friends not because you spoke with tongues amen danced in the spirit amen because you've cast out Devils or move mountains with faith amen he said that's all right for that's all right but still unless that real perfect love that mature love is in there amen that's the the only thing that can stay there he said that was where perfect love was and that's the only thing that'll let you in there that's the only thing that can stay there it's the only thing that was there oh my listen what he said this is adoption number four he said it's an adoption adoption yes what comes what happens what takes place when we start manifesting mature Love full adoption right potentially we're there but we have some climbing yet to do yes sir he said God before the foundation of the world do I have a little more time yes sir he said now let's hurry up let's get this one chapter through anyhow if possible in the next 10 minutes to whom we also have obtained an inheritance we inherit what eternal life being predestinated how does everybody understand that did you call on God and he's trying to get through the verses here God called on you some people say oh I just sought God and sought God you did not no man ever sought God it's God seeking man Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first see it's the nature of man to do what run from God and you say now paragraph 103 he said that's what bothers me though to preach to you people don't remain on in the same condition you've been going in change now hear me as I say it thus sayith the Lord I've never called myself this I'm not but you call me your Prophet or a Prophet the world believes that the world millions and millions and millions of people I spoke directly and indirectly to 10 or 12 million people or more directly speaking I've seen tens of thousands of visions and signs and wonders and not one of them ever failed and that's right he's foretold me things that's never failed to happen just exactly I'll bring any man to try for that that's right I don't claim to be a prophet but you listen to me thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there right when he went beyond the curtain of time there was no physical sensation in the love that was displayed he said those sisters could embrace R me and there was no physical sensation it wasn't love like we have loved in the earth it was a Divine love it was a Godly love Which is higher and Superior to all other forms of love are you leaving me are you still here he said no matter what money how much religious demonstration how many Good Deeds you done or whatever you done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take what perfect love so whatever you do somebody hear me whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you who hate you he said I I just said this morning I was my whole makeup is Grace a lot of people say now you scratch my back I'll scratch yours yeah you do something for me I'll do something for you he said that's not Grace Grace is your if your back is itching I'll scratch it anyhow whether you scratch mine or not slap me on the face and say my back needs itching or needs scratch it I'll scratch it see that's it do something I don't believe in works I believe that works is love works is the manifestation that Grace has taken place I don't live true to my wife because I believe she divorced me if I didn't I live true to her because I love her now I want you to look at first John with me just a moment before we close first first John chap 4 where we have been recently verse 17 and 18 we're revisiting this in closing here in is our love made perfect made mature that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love amen but perfect love mature love casteth out fear amen because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love to short places to read in the rejected King he said and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost he's beyond the curtain of time now he saw those people are all these Broms remember we can't read it all this morning these are those who believed your message there was love those sisters came it's interesting how he describes the men they looked a little odd he talks about their hair being a little out of the ordinary he talks about the beauty of the sisters they're in the prime of their life their hair is not pinned up it's hanging down their backs they're all in the Prime of their life he said the voice spoke and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it this is where he got that understanding and Revelation he said I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there I want you to read the rest the jeal there was no oh I wished I had a husband like she does you got the one you chose oh I wish my wife was more like his wife you don't have a uh this is not Walmart they don't have a return counter some of these places is so good you don't even have to have your receipt right they'll just exchange for you can't take your wife up there to The Exchange counter and say I'd like to trade her in on a newer model you chose her they do it they do it they do it even around this message they do it even after marriage and divorce has been preached they still do it they still divorce and remarry right around this message yes they ignore what he said God have mercy on you if you ever do it again and the pastors stand right up and Mar Rhythm nobody quits going to the camp meetings nobody quits supporting the preachers nobody come on they're just I mean they're still in the top 10 they forgotten what he said don't you think that the Lord knew the longer and longer and longer the Rapture carried the looser and looser and looser it would get but not that real bride on she recognizes what's happening around her and she wants to draw up as close to him as she possibly can she doesn't want to go back to the paganism she wants to run to the word she doesn't want to take a chance and gamble with her soul she runs to Christ she runs to him there was no jealousy no comparison there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never end there could never enter in there morality never make you feel old mortality excuse me could never make you feel old they could not cry I love this imagine and losing your leaky head no more weeping and mourning just one Joy adoption number four same message where we just were I'm reading again thus sayth the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter what money how many religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds musicians are coming no matter how many Deeds Good Deeds you've done or whatever You' done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you brother brandom said I'm going to let you in on a little secret he said that's how I control wild animals that's right because when when perfect love is projected Sovereign divine grace takes over he talked to us about the man I'll I'll share this with you refresh your memory another time all that was just to get us to where we're going going to go [Music] soon you talked about that man you know they blast all over the Internet well he told it different one place he told it one one town in one situation another place he told it other listen listen folks of all the gifts that brother brandham had in his ministry he did not have the gift of perfect Rec call let's just settle that this morning and until we had the computer and we had all the had it all in our the table and had it all in our hand we didn't even know for years people didn't even know that these things were told differently when I first came to the message they stood the old General stood up the ones that were with brother brandham stood up and they said I heard him tell a story a hundred times and he never told it different uh the the H hundredth time and we now know that wasn't the truth that wasn't the truth he was a human being he was a man he forgot things that has nothing to do with the ministry it has Absol in fact to me it's the most encouraging thing uh what they what they use to Discount and to throw the prophet away and to throw the message away is one of the reasons I want to cling to it even more because it proves to me that God used broken men human come on imperfect vessels and that lets me know I have a chance to be used in some capacity for God and you have a chance to be used so whether it was the man from Windsor or whether he was the man from tinbu two I don't care all I know is brother brandham had an opportunity to speak his immediate death and instead he put him at his feet and he lays over the man's shoes and brother brandham said you don't cast out Devils with a bad Spirit he said you do it with with love you do it with Divine love and he said it was because of that love that that man was laid right across my he talks about the bull he talks about the Hornets he talks about the mother possum he said I'm let you in on a little cig that's how I've controlled those wild animals Divine love a Christian Mystic of a of another generation suar sing had a rock that he used to go out to pray on and leopards would come lay down at his feet and he would stroke the leopard while he talked to God he must have learned something he must have learned something brother Braham said it was divine love it was the projection of divine love that caused those animals to to to change their nature for a moment and the enemy a man this wild Raging Bull these Hornets that could have stung him and took his life instead he just blesses them right back into their right back into their nest now listen if Divine love can do that what could it do in a little church like this it'd make your enemies be at peace with you it make you pray with the most sincerity you've ever prayed for one another you've never prayed for anybody with that much sincerity as you would if God should fill us today with that Divine love you will be tested would you like for me to tell you the times I've been tested since I've been preaching this well that'd be too transparent wouldn't it I'll only tell you one I got an inbox from a minister doesn't preach this message but I've known him a long time and he said I would love to record your song I want to ask your permission and in my mind I saw the things he had stolen the things that he had taken and the folks he had destroyed and I said 'lord I'm not there yet I was tested and I failed the test the first thing I thought of was not any good that he might have done the first thing I thought of was his rotten Humanity the people that he had defrauded even went to prison for it now I prayed until I I prayed until I ate I started out angry with myself and that don't change anything I prayed through that until my heart was melted for him and his lack of understanding and when I prayed to that point that I could love him like Christ loved him took me two days I wished I could have tell you it took me 20 minutes it took me two days and I wrote him back and I said of course you don't owe me anything you record it and do anything you want to with it God gave it to me it doesn't belong it it doesn't belong to me it it's his just go right ahead and all the joy I'm being honest the joy that flooded my heart oh thought what does it matter it doesn't even matter I I I'm too near home right my granny used to play the Gibson guitar and overo overum it singing I'm too near too near home with my Lord I'm too near home Heaven's reward I'm not return into sin I've made my vow I I I had such Joy come into my heart and I thought Lord the next time I meet I meet a test like that please don't don't allow it to take me two days remind me remind me of the benefit of divine love remind me of the benefit of letting my love mature in You Remind Me Lord provoke me whatever I need shake me remind me jerk me around if that's what I need so that I can come to love because without it seems to me like you can have all the revelation of the word and not have that love and miss it let's stand so God will help you with the enemy's test he will test you God will help you if you let him give me that key Sister Laura I'm going to have Benjamin to come and Lead worship but let me sing a little of that Granny song Too near home I'm too near too near home with my Lord too near home Heaven's reward I am not returning to sin I have made my life now there
