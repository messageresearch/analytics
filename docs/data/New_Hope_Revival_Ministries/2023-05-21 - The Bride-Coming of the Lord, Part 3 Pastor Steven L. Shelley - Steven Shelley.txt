[Applause] [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] you are living [Music] in the most quiet world you're ever going to live in mention of the weeping and wailing grinding of teeth yes if you make it to eternal life if you make it to our Heavenly home and into our future home you will find that it is a loud place to be because it's not just four in 20 elders but it's a host of uh of innumerable angels and innumerable redeemed of all the church ages Hallelujah bowing before [Applause] lamb the lamb [Applause] oh why not get ready why not get ready over here it it means it means that we have to get out of ourselves and this is why we struggle so because we we have a mode that kicks in from the soul from the mind and the will and the emotions there is a mode that kicks in for self-preservation and we want to protect ourselves and the issue is control if you're among a people who won't praise him who can't find their place of Praise it's because they're being controlled it's a control issue and and and people are so afraid of losing control because like sister and a son it's hard to say [Music] it's hard to say what'll happen when Jesus gets a hold of you you may stand there like a saint and just glistening tears running down your me you may kneel down like Havens Carter you heard the first podcast you may kneel down like Havens Carter my grandmother's neighbor and you may receive the Holy Ghost with your hands my granny said she looked like an angel the light was glistening on her tears and just gentle tongues was coming out of her mouth and my granny said I want it like that I want to encounter Jesus just like that oh but it didn't happen it must run in my family to be loud and exuberant she she said it didn't happen to her that way when she got it she ran and skipped and jumped and hollered and howled and and spoke in tongues and did everything but bounce off the walls that doesn't mean that either one of those experiences is more right than the other it just means it's hard to tell what'll happen when Jesus gets a hold of you so you see people who are controlled have control issues and they don't want to lose control so they're really afraid to step out into the spirit to see what might really happen if they encountered a living God but I'll tell you this if you encounter a living God I don't know whether you'll you'll howl or cry or shout or quiet reverence I don't know what you want you but I can guarantee you this you'll never be the same I want you to give him one more Roar of Praise before you sit down one more [Music] holy holy [Music] holy in my shout I want you to know why I'm shouting if I run I want you to know why I'm running [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my life has been changed praise God you may be seated just a moment he's he is here he's here let's don't let him slip from us let's hold him here let's hold his presence here until the last amen and then when we leave let's take him with us let's don't leave him here let's take him with us because we're going to need him because the day after Sunday is you're going to need him on a Monday and anymore you need him on a Tuesday and a Wednesday and a Thursday you know you you just well to get prepared you have a breakthrough service like we had here Tuesday night you better buckle up you better just buckle up and expect that the backlash of hell is going to be against you all week long we saw it from Wednesday morning until this morning same kind of pushing back from Darkness so what do we do we do do we come in here afraid we're going to disturb the enemy I better I better behave because if if I if I get a little Rowdy then the Devil he's going to come fighting me all week he is anyway so you might as well get the strength you need to do something about it and we are strengthened in the presence of the Lord I'm seeing something in the spirit right now all over this room just movement just activity and movement in the realm of the spirit and what that tells me is if you will call him to you he'll come he'll come to you just a real fluttering and movement in the spirit realm all over our heads today and if you have a need just put that need out right now put that need before him Lord here I am waiting on you I need your healing touch I need your deliverance touch I needs touch in my nerves I need a touch in my body whatever you have need of you just keep presenting it to him as his spirit moves over this place hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus he's with us yes thank you Ben for doing a wonderful job in worship this morning and leading Us in and putting your all into it it makes such a difference when somebody puts their all in we appreciate it thank you for thank you David for getting here uh early and playing and you know it trickles down and appreciate it so much knowing you've got a little baby and and we're we're so excited um they're they're not here this morning they've got to watch the little baby carefully of course and we understand that but what if I told you that that the little bit the the the my family has just tormented me I'm a southerner and I speak old southern English and I say things all the time the kids say what does that even mean and they say it just like that what's it even mean it makes me mad enough to want to whoop them but uh and and I've been calling her the least one and they think that is just like more than more than non-politically correct we would say that in in in my day and it means the smallest of the two that's so much better than calling her the runt that's what I told them it doesn't mean she's any least in love or looks or or potential or destiny it just means of the two she weighs the last the least I'm going to educate some of you Yankees that worship with us I'm going to help you I was going to give you a report here if I can find it I've had dozens of texts since yesterday let me see I'm still still still scanning I want to give you the I want to give you the the report both both twins sweet little babies are home and as of yesterday or excuse me as of uh the the pediatric appointment on Friday Lydia it weighs four pounds and one ounce thank God for that and uh Adelaide is taking off she weighs six pounds [Music] so let's give God praise for both babies being home with Mom and Daddy on the campground [Music] and I thought it was just so appropriate that all this work that has gone on Josh has worked so hard and to make these roads so nice I rode down to the bottom of the hill didn't get muddy didn't scrape or scrub I made the circle down at the bottom and and just thanked God for the beautiful work that's been done and I thought wasn't that wonderful that that was being done as Michael and Crystal and are coming home with their with their baby that they had had to uh to leave there in the NICU for some time and it's just wonderful what God is doing and he deserves the highest praise today is brother Billy and sister Laurel's wedding anniversary they were married in 1994 how many years does that make it 29 years I want us to thank God for 29 years for them today happy anniversary [Applause] I guess you all were one of the very first weddings that we had in the church 29 years ago and Emily was the first baby born in the church and now look what has happened and look what is happening and I think before before too many decades we'll have some more weddings and some more babies and we're growing this is our idea of spiritual growth we just want every predestinated seed of God to be expressed in the Earth the faster we get them here and get them to the age of accountability the faster we can get out of here isn't that the truth I'm not making a Doctrine I'm just thanking God for new babies uh Tuesday of this week is Sister Laurel's birthday that's all we'll say about that happy birthday I'm not a dummy it's next year that we'll have something to say that's an even one then we'll leave the odd ones out but we wish you a very happy birthday happy birthday Bernie hammermeister God bless you streaming I hope his birthday is on Wednesday of this week as some of you say who in the world is brother Bernie that's sister alfreda's nephew and its sister Judith's first cousin that sister adina's son and uh sister Lydia's nephew it's from the Whitmire family and his Pastor uh his brother is a pastor there in Edmonton brother Ed hammermeister brother Bernie's been with us a long time and we love him and we miss him and we send him a happy birthday on Friday night of this week at seven o'clock we're going to have a very special time of worship uh we're we're going to Worship the Lord uh for a good amount of time I don't know how long and then we're going to go into very designated prayer over some prayer points that we will give on Friday night at seven o'clock how can we invite you to be here you won't have to come and just try to figure out what to pray about we will give some very designated points of prayer and I think you'll find it a very very blessed service because the Lord has called it when he calls us to church then we know he's going to show up and it's going to be a blessing and one other announcement and that is on on uh excuse me June 3rd and 4th we're going to have our weekend meetings of Fellowship here I was speaking to brother Elam Fisher on the phone last night and he plans to be with us and some more of the Amish Brethren plan to be with us for that weekend and uh I don't know if you all remember brother Levi who was here or not his wife was the sister who was in the wheelchair how many of you remember when they were with us he's coming and bringing some folks with him uh they're in another different place a slightly different place in Indiana and while he was here he told me that they were going to be building a church and they wanted me to come and dedicate it when it was ready and we found out that last weekend the the Brethren who come and fellowship with us often they went over and helped start raising up the church and there's another church in Ohio of wonderful former Amish people who have all been baptized recently and quite a number of them and have accepted the message of the hour and was talking to brother Elam about it last night and he said we've waited on this for years and years this is the promised breakthrough and God is doing things among the Amish bringing them out of a system and into a truth that will absolutely transform them I believe that with all my heart there's a transforming power in this message of Truth so we're excited about what God is doing there and we want you to continue to pray for them let's thank God for the musicians and the worship leaders and let them go down [Applause] we're going to the word today uh it's very nice to to finally meet Brother David here on the on the front we've had some conversation been on the phone and texting together and he's old friends for a lot of these Saints from from out that way uh Elias I think you you all were did someone tell me you were in his wedding or something

we got to have church amen but welcome to you brother let's stand let's go to the word let's hear what the Lord has to say one more order of business and that is to welcome all of those who are streaming the service uh we we greet the Saints in Kentucky brother Byler his own God bless you brother and uh sister Dora who is here a little more local and could could somebody help me Hawk would you mind to come here just a moment did you have to put your shoes on you all can be turning in your Bible to first Thessalonians chapter four I want you to look at that and tell me what to do differently do I need to uh you see it only lets me see a few of the comments and and I can't get it to I can't figure out what's causing that and I've gotten in trouble a few times not greeting all the people so just do that always expand it sometimes when I do that this right here is very very squatty and won't let me won't let me see thank you so much I guess it just needed your touch wait a minute come here it's not doing it I thought that was a little too easy look it's only showing four the same four it was showing don't we have a patient congregation not one amen let me double check and see if I can get more than four or send me a screenshot of what you can get so I can greet these people praise the Lord from let me let me greet the ones I can see here uh an old friend of mine brother Chuck from North Carolina God bless you Kenya is watching seal Alabama England uh here's another one from the UK God bless you uh there are so many on here our brothers and sisters in Indiana the Netherlands twice another Indiana Ontario Canada and it goes on we just want to take a minute to let them know we appreciate them being a part of our service God bless every one of you wherever you are watching from and we only know if people type it in so if you want us to know where you're from type it in first Thessalonians chapter 4. of verse 15 16 and 17 Again for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first let's do that verse again for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord how many of you believe the reality of that how many of you believe it's in progress now we're not just looking putting this off in the future we're actually believing that it has started a whole generation ago the Lord's coming has already started and we're waiting on the culmination of that coming is that right then let's go to Revelation 10 while you're still standing and get a little bit of a review because we took off for Mother's Day weekend and we and we spoke about the women of God in our midst and so I want to make sure that you remember where we are in this series we could read the whole chapter of Revelation 10 but I'm going to skip down just a little I'm going to start in verse 1 and we'll see where we go and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud uh and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book I want you you to describe the book I want you to give me that next word and he had in his hand a little book open because Revelation 5 tells us that from the midst of the throne there came a lamb and the lamb opened the seals is that right he took the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne and he opened the book amen that wasn't brother Branham that wasn't any other Prophet that lamb was Jesus and this Mighty angel of Revelation 10 1 that's not brother Branham that's not any other wonderful servant of the Lord that's him that's Jesus Christ John saw him as an angel with a rainbow about his head which makes him the angel of the Covenant and we know that to be the angel of the Lord and brother Branham talked about the angel of the Lord and that is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ the book that was once closed it was once sealed has now been opened and it is in the hand of the Lord Jesus he himself brings the message of the open book he comes down with the open book in his hand and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried what happens seven Thunders uttered their voices verse 4 and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things I I like this because it right in the middle of the apocalypsis right in the middle of the unveiling of Jesus Christ the revealing of all the mystery we have this instruction that seems so contrary to what's going on this is a season of opening things up the whole book of the Revelation is a season of opening things up and making them known and in the middle of a season of making things known by Revelation a voice says Ah don't let that go anywhere don't write that down brother Branham tells us about those sunders they're not even written in the book where did he get that idea right there they're not even written down right them not and and he goes on I guess I should just read it since you're already standing and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up His Hands to Heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and as I always mention one translation says that there should be no more delay if you've got a pen why don't you write that write in your Bible or on your notes if you're if you don't write right in I pass your pen to somebody I think it would be so important for you to know that it is not the ending of time as we would interpret it's the ending of delay what it what it's saying to us is things are now kicking in they're not coming to an abrupt end as we hear preached all around us but delay that has held all of these things back is what's coming to an end and now the program of God will spin full force until all these things are fulfilled all these things must be revealed and they must be fulfilled and so time time no longer is telling us no more delay I I wish somebody I know you're standing if you need to sit please do I wish somebody would prophesy with me right now did you know you are you are a Sin from God and did you know when you speak the word as a word send from God what you declare it's not just a declaration it becomes a prophecy if you and I should prophesy together today no more delay how about let's doing it together one two three no more delay we're calling an end to that which has held us that which has delayed us that which has retired that's not the word I want to use handicapped us it has held us back we are ready to see that moved out of the way we're ready to see time moving in our favor instead of out of our favor all right I'm getting excited here and you're see what happens when you still stand it gets me excited but you've got to be seated why don't you just go ahead God bless you may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word be seated time should be no more that there will be delay no longer that there will be delay no longer no more delay but in the day of The Voice God is jealous over that voice it's his voice it's his voice it's his voice that spoke through Paul it's his voice that spoke through all of the other seven Church age Messengers all seven of them it was not their voice but it was the voice of God using their voice you believe that don't you not everything they said but when they were speaking under inspiration as brother random explains to us then that wasn't them talking anymore I love those moments that brother Branham got so caught up in the inspiration of what was happening that he'd say that wasn't me he recognized that something had taken over and was speaking through him come on now I want you to know the bride has a voice remember remember that Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed amen he comes he comes in the fullness of his word he comes in Bride form then he comes in bridegroom form it's the same Christ it's the same word anybody with me it's the same Christ it's the same word he comes first in the revealing of his word we call that word form you want to write it down go ahead he comes the next time in his bride that is what we call the bride form coming of the Lord and the next time is him coming himself in bridegroom form in the air to receive us as we just read in first Thessalonians not a mystical thing after all it's been revealed to us by the Holy Spirit how many of you are thankful for the message of the hour I'm so thankful for it because we as I have mentioned to you before we were taught that it all happens in a batting of an eye I grew up in Pentecost and in Holiness and their idea of the coming Rapture was that it would all happen in the batting of an eye in the blinking of an eye look it's all over with not understanding but only the culmination of the coming the consummation of the coming is in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the rest of it is a process of coming he he's still coming he's still coming because he comes in word form he comes in Bride form and then he comes himself in bridegroom form isn't that powerful what do we connect that to we connect that to where brother Branham said that he comes the first time to do what help me Jesus comes the first time to do what to redeem he comes the first time to redeem his bride he comes the next time to do what to receive his bride you better write this down he comes the first time to redeem his bride he comes the second time to receive his bride he comes the third time with his bride now you can find that all through the message of the hour in fact we have quotes coming up on that somewhere in this series but not for today so this is great that God has preserved The Voice because when some people read that they say well that ended in 1965 because the mouthpiece was taken from off the scene but notice it didn't say the voice of the prophet it doesn't say the vessel that God is going to use for this Angel to speak through it just says but in the days of The Voice and how many of you know that we're living in an hour where the voice is recorded and we can hear the voice so I'd like for you to know that we are still in the days of the voice anybody with me we're still in the days of the voice I like it when brother Branham kind of talks about that he he tells us that if such an instrument could be invented that you would be able to tap into the atmosphere because he said the sound waves are still moving around the Earth yes he said around and uh those sound waves are still moving around and he said if we could if we could find the right instrument to tap into that he said we could hear today the preaching of Noah so the voice of Noah is still out there somewhere is that right and that's why that little bride is coming forth in the with the sound the voice of the sound of many Waters because it's not just one voice it's a five-fold Ministry voice and it's it's echoing and all of those voices are coming together in fact as we looked at and we'll look at again they formed the voice of the archangel brother Branham didn't tell us that the voice of the Archangel is the voice of an archangel like Michael or Gabriel he speaks about that voice as being a mini-membered bride as being a voice with many facets to it like the voice of many Waters it's like a Babbling Brook how many of you love the sound of the Rushing Water and the fivefold ministry is a part of the Bride coming of Christ the fivefold ministry has a responsibility to do in the bride coming of Christ and that's the hour that we're living in right now and that voice begins to culminate that's what the word said that voice begins to culminate and prepare a people now we're not living in the in the days of the live Ministry of brother Adam but we're still living in the days of The Voice because his voice is still sounding we can still go and feast and I do on a weekly basis we Feast on the word that has been preserved for this day and I encourage you to do that and don't spend all your time in the church age book go back and hear the voice because there's something in that voice that transforms wait a minute amen Pastor thank you for that good advice you're welcome I want you to hear what I'm saying but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished now this has been interpreted by our Brethren is finished but that's not what it says it says it should be this gives indication that there may be some things that try to stand in the way that doesn't mean that God won't have his way let me tell you something God's going to have his way I want you to look at your neighbor don't be embarrassed your breath doesn't smell too bad look at your neighbor and and say to them God always makes a way he's going to make a way if something should be finished that is not yet totally finished God's going to make a way he's going to make a way you need to hear this for the rest of the study he's going to make a way it says it should be finished and I don't want to cause any more controversy than I already do every time I open my mouth but I want to call your attention to the singularity of the word mystery now brother Branham rarely said mystery he most often said Mysteries because he was quoting it from memory no big deal here but then he takes that servants the prophets and he depluralizes both servants and prophet and he often says in the days of the voice the mysteries of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servant the prophet now I am a person who believes that that can make a world of difference when we go to apply the word anybody with me you see it's not just in hearing it and understanding it now I've got to take what I hear and I got to figure out how to apply it to the hour I'm living in amen and since we don't see the finality of all things we have to say there's something yet in that mystery of God that has not yet been completely made known now I believe a portion of that is what I have just quoted to you a moment ago that that the mystery of God is revealed in Christ Christ is the mystery of God and I believe that a portion of the rest of that that the mystery of Christ is revealed in the bride or the bride is the revealing of the mystery of Christ I think that's a key to see this mystery finished let me see if you heard what I'm saying I think that this is a part it's you being able to identify your position in this equation you see there's no doubt in my mind that brother Branham helped us to see clearly that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new but now I want to ask you who are you who are you brother Branham asked us at the end of his ministry several times from scripture what house will you build me right what are the last messages what house will you build me so now Christ is looking for a place to live now the church at large teaches that Christ comes to live in US that that's not a great great Revelation there but what is great and what is powerful and what is missing in this hour is he doesn't just come to live in us to make us feel warm and fuzzy he comes to live in us because he wants to burst out of us doing the same things that he did while he was on planet Earth and so he wants to he wants to raise the Dead he wants to heal the sick he wants to manifest Deliverance through his bride and that is a fully adopted bride that's coming to maturity right and when she stands in the fullness of her maturity what will you have you will have a mystery of God completely finished a process from the logos remember how he talks about that Fountain of Light that bubbling Fountain of color and he said are you with me and he said out of that Fountain of Light Came to logos so that's the beginning of the mystery right there you see there was a time when God was not God somebody said God is eternal he's Eternal in spirit but not Eternal in office because in order for him to be God in office there has to be something created or something that can recognize who he is and worship him so in the very beginning it was just spirit and light God eternal you you can say father you can say the eternal spirit of the father but in order to manifest that he was the eternal spirit of the father he had to birth something he had to create something do you understand where I'm going so the mystery of God started before the foundation of the world and the Mystery of God will be finished at the end of the laodicean church age [Music] it took all of the old Covenant it took on Church ages for this mystery of God to be finished Paul was a part of it Arrhenius and Martin Luther and Wesley these men were all apart in finishing the mystery of God and one of these days it's going to be finished in you and it's not going to be you anymore but it's going to be he who is who has possessed you see the whole concept of demon possession is an enter type for something that's great and real and that is a people that are fully possessed by God you see that Old Demon is what he always is an imitator an impersonator and he tries to control people with evil but there's going to be a fully adopted manifested bride she will come forth in the last of the last days she will have the saith the Lord and without the saith the Lord Brother random said she will keep her peace she won't speak without no saith the Lord because she's going to be so fully surrendered to him why how do we get to that place how will we ever get to that place we're we're processing it now I'm getting ahead of myself we're processing it now because remember when we did the series some years ago we got all the way down to this amazing verse and I want you to go there with me for just a moment I want you to go all the way down to verse 9. well wait a minute we better read verse eight and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said why don't you all read it for me would you let me get my breath go and [Music] thank you now now who is to come and take the book who is to go and take the little book out of the hand of Jesus Christ who is the person who's supposed to do that who is that being spoken to John the prophet tells us that John is a type of what the bride so did you know that means that in John in Revelation chapter 4 when the when the spirit of the Lord says to John come up higher let me read that I'm getting a little bit of help I'm I can preach in a minute I'm getting a little help here after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up come up hither higher and I will show thee things which must be here after that was John if John is a type of the Bride you and I will not see the finishing of the mystery until we recognize that the bride is receiving the same upward call it's called the ascended life you want to make people jealous I don't really want to make them jealous but you want to see people turn jealous you just start living a higher life that could mean a lot of things but you know what I'm saying this morning you just start getting up above the the pig pen that you've been living in and the first thing somebody will say oh he's all religious all of a sudden but the world doesn't even know what religion is they don't even understand what religion is if they did they'd know that I hate it as much as anybody religion is vile it's reality and relationship it's Revelation that we're after not religion come on now so anybody that tries to to yield to the trumpet call and get up a little bit higher than those living around them they're going to get the Joseph experience they're going to be sold into slavery by their brethren they're going to be left for the wild animals to devour but don't you worry because remember what we said a few moments ago God Will Make A Way from the pit to the Palace from the slave block to the prime minister to a little forgotten forsaken ignored bride to a people with thus saith the Lord in their mouth speaking to the storm talking to the cancer [Applause] not begging God to move it not crying remember the bride's Destiny is not to cry forever we cry now [Music] I wished I was sitting Where You Are because I'd be getting happy let me have a little water God's got something for us we've got something to shout about now but you ain't seen nothing yet if you folks don't hurry up and get caught up with this Shout I don't know what in the world you're going to do when the real shout moves among us when the real shout of the king is heard in the camp walls come down come on now principalities bow you don't have to go looking for a demon to talk to when you have thus saith the Lord you don't have to go finding a devil under a rock when you have the say of the Lord you just move forth in his authority the devil has to get out of your way oh yes oh yes I know him and the devil said I know him and he don't speak like he used to speak and he don't move like he used to move something has happened in him I'm just going to give him the right away here I'm going to yield and let him get right remember that the whole purpose of the enemy according to the prophet the whole purpose of Satan is to be a tool just a tool remember the Bible said that God created evil a hard time but he's straight from the word he created it why would a loving God create something like evil because it serves his purpose in getting God to man his purpose his intention in the beginning was that God become man that God come down and live in a body of Flesh so that the redeemed of Adam's Fallen race the sons of man could come up and yield and build yield and build a house so the preaching of a barely getting by experience it's not going to perfect a bride and sharpen her in this hour the preaching of just you're just always easy what you are you're never going to be able to get above that you'll always struggle with the same thing you've been struggling with now you'll just have to come to accept that as the reality that's not the reality of the Bible that's not the reality of a Jesus encounter Bartimaeus didn't stay the same help me amen the widow woman son of name he didn't stay the same [Music] [Applause] let's go through the New Testament and realize that anybody who has an encounter with Jesus they are changed and we are not preaching about just encountering Jesus we're preaching about building him a house [Music] that he can come and live in now so this is the Angel speaking to John and he says and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey anybody still with me sweet as honey now you see this is a process this is a process I can't get to that just yet I'd like to but I can't get to that just yet let me share something with you in in the first phase of the coming of the Lord he's coming with a shout is that right and that's the word coming it's true isn't it that's the revealing of the word that's the finishing of the mystery of God that's the third seal where bro the prophet said the bride has never had a Revival yet isn't that what he said third seal halfway through the bride has never had a Revival yet because it's going to take the mystery the revelation of those seven unknown Thunders that's what he calls them there isn't it so at least at that time he himself at that moment didn't know what they were are we right to say that this is all a part of the Bride coming of Christ and I want you to see what that looks like in the message it is the rising of the Sun paragraph 94 you're ready to study this in the time we have left we got to move but I want you to see this God bless you that are joining us in the Cape of South Africa so many other places thank you for being with us paragraph 94 ask Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was how about you read it he was that slept he was the first resurrection he was the first fruits in the resurrection now if we were to count from the Feast of firstfruits which happens around our Easter time or the end of our Passover feast of unleavened bread if we were to count 50 days and we must because 50 days after the resurrection of Christ brings us to shavot and shovel is Pentecost and when we come together next Friday night we will be praying during the Feast of Shabbat we will be praying during the biblical season of what we have come to call Pentecost penty being 50 in the Greek and the reason why that's so significant is because we are we just passed the 40th Day and the 40th Day what happened what happened the 40th Day after the Resurrection on the Feast of first fruits what happened on the 40th Day he ascended from the Mount of Olives into heaven on the 40th Day so we've just about passed that it was just a few days ago that we would have hit the 40th Day and now it's 10-day count to chevote it's 10-day count to Pentecost this helps us to place ourselves in the word don't you like to find your place in the book oh I'd like to find my place in the book and so he was raised as the firstborn of many Brethren the first fruits of those that slept and then 40 days later he ascended into heaven and he told them uh when he left to watch and pray some glorious things are going to happen he basically said I'll meet you in a few days in the upper room I'm paraphrasing Arna but that's basically what he said you going to meet together and I'm going to show up in your midst and I'm going to endure you I'm going to imbibe you with power from on high you are going to get your first charge your first electrical charge of my glory and when you get the initial charge you're never going to be satisfied until you have more you're going to want to move from glory to glory you're going to want to move from Faith to Faith you're going to want to move from strength to strength because I have got up as the first fruits of them that sleep now watch what brother Branham goes on to say in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll be there'll have to be a Sheaf waved again in the last days now someone challenged me one time I know you can't imagine someone challenged me one time over a comma and I want you to know that it's not encouraged to interpret scripture by punctuation kind of a dangerous thing to do so when we don't know as in Revelation 10 where he pluralized the single and singularized the plural you go back to the original and you try to determine the word that was used in the beginning and it's not always enough and I have heard for our sermons preached from the message on the placing of a comma you can't always trust the placing of a comma in the King James version of the Bible you may not always be able to build a Doctrine on the placing of a comma in the message of the hour because there's something you need to know about brother Branham I don't know anybody else like this his sentences I think we call them run-on sentences because they run on and on and on and on and on and on and on how would you like to be the comma putter how would you like to be the one that had to decide where the comma goes you know there is an incentives an interesting example of this in the scripture if you're still with me uh the Bible said when the enemy cometh in like a flood he the spirit will raise up a standard against him can someone give me the address of that Isaiah what Isaiah 59 and what verse do we know all right let's look and see anybody still here praise God Isaiah 53 19 59 59 19 good sister Beverly that was from singing days they sung her and brother skip or sung the Bible 59 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun period now watch this this is how this is how the King James translators uh grammarized and punctuated this verse when the enemy shall come in like a flood comma the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him how many of you think that's amazing I love it has anybody ever seen the enemy come in like a flood let me see your hand play along class help your aging teacher would you help me know you're still there how many have never seen the enemy come in like a flood in your neighbor's life have you ever seen him come in like a flood in your life so none of us have a problem believing that the enemy can come in like a flood right this verse goes on to say the spirit when the enemy does come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up her standard against him does that comfort you aren't you comforted to know that when the enemy floods your life the spirit of the Lord will raise up a flag against him that's the word give me one let me see how many demons I can disturb give me a flag praise God that's the word that's the word the word standard there means a banner or a flag now it doesn't seem quite as powerful to think about it that way until you realize who's raising a flag against the devil when God raises a flag against the enemy he has no choice but to retreat don't that bless you to know that God is waving a flag in your enemy's face now how does that fit in with the message of the hour well how many of you remember I've told you about granddaddy words brother Bobby are you watching today sometimes he does it was his grandfather brother Donovan Wertz dad who had this dream experience that brother Branham tells about in the message of the hour and it's the experience with the Devil and it come like his lies and his accusations and as the enemy began to speak against granddaddy words in this dream experience he starts getting littler Papa Works granddaddy word he starts getting smaller and the enemy starts getting bigger Every Lie of the enemy shrunk him and magnified the enemy does anybody believe that's a Dream from the Lord I do because that's my life somebody told my life story this is how it works in our everyday life every time we take the enemy's lie in accusation it shrinks us and it gives him more Authority remember he's just a tool in the hand of God to perfect the Saints and so if you take if you take authority over the tool and so this thing turned around and I don't have it in front of me I don't think I do that that I could read it to you quickly I'll just do a quick search here on my amazing notes the problem is it brings up it brings up book for boo anybody could find that I don't want to take the time but I'm I think maybe so oh here we go no I have pulled here the the quote for brother Bobby's dad brother Donovan getting his healing and brother Branham prayed for him and and I hear and I say uh that I do know Granddaddy's name now I'd forgotten it William words I've got that but I don't see a a particular quotation here could we could we see if we could find that charity from God commissioning Moses night I got so many things going at one time I'll never remember where I am thank you sister Beverly paragraph 27 does that help at all now remember take it believe it put your faith and turn it loose Yonder with God and the Holy Ghost will come upon you he promised it then brother the devil looked like a little bitty fellow see when he began to take the authority of faith and turn it against the enemy speak the word of God the Holy Ghost come upon then brother the devil looked like a little bitty fellow he began to shrink as that Faith begin to say boo devil boo devil boo devil that's all he had to say why because the authority wasn't in his words The Authority was in his life The Authority was who lived in his shoe leather so it didn't matter if he formed the words just right a simple Blue Devil shrunk him down a man was telling me the other night that he said he had a dream and said he dreamed the devil was a little bitty Old Devil got after him and he said the devil said boo and he jumped back and every time he jumped back the devil got bigger he jumped back he jumped back he jumped back and the devil got bigger and bigger all the time and after a while he knowed he had to fight the devil so the only thing he had to do then he said he'd just reach over and got the Bible and he kept backing back he said he made a hit at him and the devil started getting littler [Music] is that too silly for some of you theologians isn't that good [Music] he just began to take new Devil he said he made a hit at him and the devil started getting littler going down said he knowed he had to fight him sometime brother every time he hollers Boo and you jump back he'll just keep getting bigger oh this is deeper than a whole lot of people realize he'll just keep getting bigger but when you take God's word and stand there and say the saith the Lord it's written he will what he will take his fly he will get littler look up there and say well looky here what kind of condition are you in I'm looking at this I'm looking to what he said amen God had promised David got this little sling picked up five Stone put one in the slingshot oh Goliath looked over to him and said well what am I a dog look what's coming to fight me he didn't understand what it was all about how many of you know it only took I'll I'll finish it I guess he said why today he cursed him in the name of his gods and he said why today I'll give your flesh to the birds David said you meet me as a Philistine in the name of a Philistine with an arm and a spear but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel and this day God will give me this day God will give you into my hands isn't that what he said now back to Isaiah if you'll pull that verse up I remembered so nobody has a problem believing that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard raise up a flag raise up a banner against him so if you should ever use that if you ever wave your little flag you just remember you're just doing what the Lord has to do sometime to push the enemy back out of your life don't hit anybody in the face with it and don't get between us and the camera that happens sometime during worship in the in the the precious streamers will rot in and say I love the worship but please ask them not to stand here because then it blocks them from being able to see what's going on in the worship and remember they're on the other end just gasping grasping to try to get a little piece of the service and they want to feel as connected as they possibly can but you get off in the corner somewhere if you need to and you show the enemy what he's about to have to swallow if he doesn't get out of your life with his flood right so I believe that just like it's written and I wouldn't try to change it for nothing in the world but that is not how it reads in the original when you start breaking those words down and you follow the the the parts of speech in Hebrew you find out that that's not where the if you're going to put a comma at all that's not really where the comma should go and when you get that in your heart I tell you it'll make you jump a little higher than you've been jumping because if we place that just like it ought to be here is how it would read when the enemy shall come in comma hello [Applause] when the enemy shall come in comma like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him won't you come like you promised Lord won't you come like a flood and push back the enemy [Applause] there it is in the word so when we get to this quote in the bride coming of Christ I've had people challenge me there and it is the rising of the sun because the comma is where it is and they say well that's not talking about uh uh the bride coming it's just the kind of the way the comma is but I believe it is he said in the bride they place a comma there paragraph 94. it is the rising of the Sun in the bride comma coming of Christ I believe we can leave that comma out all together in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a chief waved again in the last days oh my that's a prophet coming to maternity but it's more than that in the last of the last days it's a people Christ is the mystery of God revealed the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed so it actually goes from one to a multiplication you said Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waived over the people oh that's what the word coming did and the word coming produces the bride coming so that's where we are being waived over the People by the same signs how will we know how will we know that the word is with that prophet by the same signs and wonders that they did back then and by his desire to stay in the word how will we know that a bride has come forth by the same signs and wonders that identified Christ in his first coming he will identify himself and his people in his last coming it's a multiplication it's not shrinking it's a multiplication put one seed in the ground you get a harvest you don't put one in get one out how many of you know you'd lose a lot of of a vision and a lot of energy for for Farming if you put one seed in and got one ear of corn out no no no you put one in knowing that you're going to get a stock and on that stock is going to be multiple years and on each year it's going to be a multiplication of seed that's bride somebody say that's bride that's bride now go go down to does God change his mind and we're going to come to a close shortly this morning there is always a Collision because they run right head on into each other and Israel here what I want to represent it as a spiritual church and Moab is a natural church just the church what we call Church natural and and we're all sure that there is a church and there is a bride coming out of that church we know that is true and they Clash here and we notice when they Clash here it comes under something that I would like to speak a moment on as soon as they clashed and one seen what the other one was doing there was a great impersonation one of the other wait a minute I want you to get that that is Church impersonating bribed and unfortunately some of the Bride impersonating the church no wonder brother Branham had to scream get back in line little bride because they tried to take the Church of the message the worship where the work where the Bride Comes To Worship and they try to make that look more and more like a Seeker sensitive or Seeker friendly denominational church so what you've got is you've got the church impersonating the bride and unfortunately a portion of the Bride trying to impersonate the church it will never work it's going to cause a bigger Clash than what we originally expected there was a great impersonation one of the other now paragraph 20 and that's where we find it today that we do get too much impersonations and when you do that you're always in trouble you cannot live the other fellow's life we cannot impersonate something we must be just what we are so if your church we expect you to manifest Church entity and if your bride you are expected to manifest Bridal life amen and that's what we find it today now he said you must have never if this fellow does something because he does it you think you have to do it too or you have to too you don't do that watch you're an individual to God and we mustn't try here we need to listen we mustn't try to impersonate one another so there's an impersonation of church to bride you've got some bride members get out of line and they try to impersonate church and then you've got people in The Bride that will sometimes fall victim to impersonating one another brother Branham taught us you want to make sure you get the genuine Holy Spirit you don't get your pastor spirit you don't have to shout like I shout you don't have to move like I move dress like I dress you don't have to wear a bolo tie because brother Branham did if you like boots and want to wear boots wear boots but don't wear them because he did you don't have to cover up your bald head because he did you can just be you don't try to impersonate the prophet don't try to impersonate one another don't try to impersonate another church let God do for you what you need and then be who God made you to be now that doesn't mean that you don't have a sense of responsibility to live by the standard of the church you are very obligated you are obligated by the word and by the message of the hour to honor and respect the standard of Holiness that is set in the local Sovereign Church can I have a few more amens from somebody that didn't amen earlier one more time one two three yes so don't think that you've got your individuality gives you a license to have your own standard of living and own way of of producing holiness you've got to respect the house where God has placed you so let's get at it now in the message the token I'm almost done paragraph 90 the first thing they've got to to thoroughly identify that the hour was at hand was a prophet with a message Moses came down with a message the word of God was with Moses we believe that don't we the next thing Moses had to be identified and he was identified how by a pillar of fire that identified his work that God had sent him and Moses had the word of God even to create things and to bring them upon the earth and the token that God gave them by the blood was the identification or the Assurance rather that they would be passed over in the time of death there has to be a token is that right the same thing has happened today same thing the word of God has been brought to us amen the pillar of fire is Among Us amen identifying Jesus Christ raised from the dead the same yesterday today and forever and the Assurance of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Upon Our Hearts putting our love to God The Exodus is on again Israel coming out as I said is a type like the church coming out or the bride coming out of the church the bride will be the remnant will be the little group the selected the predestinated if you believe that's amen and it's not because who she is it's because she is him it's not because of who she is it's because she is him it's because she carries his life and the last one for you that are awake three kinds of believers paragraph 97. that's the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit into that bride that'll take her from the Earth read it in a rapturing Grace God promised it don't care how many science and how many astronauts they signed up and everything else and how many million miles they can see I don't care nothing about that there is a Heaven There is a literal Jesus Christ there there that will come in a body form to that's that's the that's the bridegroom coming in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said so that's what believers why don't you try telling your neighbor that sometime that's just what Believers believe I don't know yeah the young man that came here one time that grew up in a Southern Baptist School and he used to add a verse to the song uh what what is that song I've got the oh I've got the peace that passes understanding down in my heart I've got the Blessed how's that love of my blessed her oh I have the wonderful love of my Blessed Redeemer way down in the depths of my heart he said he used to sing a verse that said I have the belief of the Believers it baffles the Baptist way down in the depths of my heart because he grew up in a Baptist School and they were always telling him there was nothing to the Holy Ghost and he'd try to help him the best way he could but it was never enough so he just added a verse to the song I have the belief of the Believers that baffles the Baptist way down in the depths of my heart that's not slinging at anybody that's just what Believers believe are there any believers here yes so I wanted to close with this there's three phases of this eating of the book we won't have time to talk about them in depth but I just want to leave them with you in summary so that we can get to them Tuesday night if there's anything I know about that eating this word is it starts off in the mouth very very sweet but once it gets down to the belly what are we talking about we're talking about Revelation 10 10. and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was what bitter it's during the word coming of Christ that that Revelation becomes so sweet in our mouth when you first came to the message of the hour out of your denominational Traditions you just loved this truth those of you who came from other some of you were raised in the God help you you were raised in the message but some of you came from other things let me see your hand if you came from other Pentecostals or denominations of some kind or Catholic or some some Catholic some Presbyterian some Lutheran some heathen we always want to get the denomination of heathen in brother Shane ought to held up his hand that was my church I was at the church of the Heathen you know a lot of Truth in that you know we we some of us was in church on Sunday and was living like a heathen the rest of the time too but but when you begin to eat something by when I heard that the Rapture was not just a bam and all the Lord it it thrilled me when I could see the breaking down of the phases of rapture that it was the Lord coming first in a shout and then in a voice and then in a trumpet it it it it was it was like a a five-course meal so sweet to understand the godhead to to to never have to fear missing the Rapture again that set me free I've told you so many times as the musicians are preparing to come on I've told you so many times that as a child we would have these amazing services like we had here Tuesday night where uh seems like a kangaroo anointing got on us here Tuesday night and there were people jumping up and down and praising the Lord and you you might have caught that on the stream somebody might have caught that in they might have thought my that's a bunch of out of order I know some of you never read my text on Friday because it was too long you you you you you had to scroll through Facebook and Instagram you didn't have time to read a good long text like that so I'll just take your time now that I've got you lock the doors Joshua you're going out to lock the door good thank you let me read this you know that's what's the matter with the church today it don't get in the spirit enough and then he gives us a reason why we don't get in the spirit enough we're too much in ourselves my if you'll just get out of yourself long enough you say well you know our church is we have a regular routine brother bam said all who cares about your routine amen if you you don't have to pull it up because everybody's got it on their phones unless they deleted it let me ask you in your uh in in your uh knockoff phones you people that have those knockoff phones did the text all come in one or did you have to expand it hello no worry brother God bless you I'm just in that kind of mood did you have to expand it or did it all come in one did you have to click on it to make it bigger so it is in one text but is it all there or do you have to click on it to make it uh wonderful you see I work so hard to bring this down to 1600 characters because it says you're not guaranteed for it to go through on a on an Android if it's more than is there sixteen hundred eighteen hundred it'll send me a warning message every time and I just thought I'm tired of all this work for these knockoff phones so I run a test with sister Joyce and it worked on hers and I said then it ought to work on everybody's so let me read it to you now my if you'll just get out of yourself long enough you say well you know our church we have a regular routine who cares about your routine I wish you'd get out of the routine long enough to get saved anyhow amen you think your preacher's heart he said get saved get out of the routine we don't care about the routine get in the spirit then you can see things done did you all hear what brother Greely said about running he said you may take over and you may not feel anything right then I wish you all to preach a message on that sometime because people around this message are always waiting on something to move them and I'll praise the Lord when I get moved to praise the lord we bring a sacrifice of praise we praise him not because we feel anything we praise him because he's worthy and look what happens when you start praising him you start feeling him you know that thing that gets on you that says run you ought to run you ought to run you ought to run you know that thing that gets on you may not feel anything but that that you feel there's a little something an urge or a call or a pull or a thought that comes to your mind you know God can speak to you in your own thoughts sometime oh yes and you step out in faith and God blesses that so many people said well I would dance before the Lord if he moved on me to do so well I want you to know it doesn't always come in that order sometimes we bring God a sacrifice of praise sometimes we dance before the Lord because we read the Psalms and it says dance it may not look like much I've never danced for in the world in my life I don't know them moves I can tell some of you used to dance for the devil God has redeemed some of your moves but I didn't have none I never danced like that so it may not look like much but I'm not trying to look like anything I just read where the Bible said praise the Lord in the dance [Applause] I didn't read where it said wait till I come on you and squeeze you until you cannot refuse to dance it just said praise the Lord in the dance so sometimes people are standing on the on the shore on the bank waiting to feel something and never do where if they just do what the psalm says the Psalms will tell you how to praise the Lord you don't get to choose how you pray he tells us how to pray just obey the word you'll be all right my I wish you'd get out of that routine we don't care about the routine get in the spirit then you can see things done he said an old Prophet one time got all stirred up because somebody came to him it wasn't right for him to come he kind of got his righteous indignation up and you know what he did before the Spirit come on him he had to go sing some good spiritual songs then he got in the spirit I I got a hush but I used to hear them say oh yes sure they're dancing now they got worked up by the music you stopped the music and let's see what they do we're not playing with these things you can run experiments in your place we're not running any experiments here because I'm not dancing because there's music come on [Music] I'm going to read it just like he said it he said before the Spirit come on him he had to go sing some good spiritual songs then he got in the spirit and he began to see things he saw some Visions I tell you brother hey life will look a lot different when the church gets in the spirit that's right he said and gets out of itself and that routine you're in amen paragraph 37 lay aside those weights you got to find out the ladies Aid Society has got their dinner next week and what you got to do people get so worked up in the most carnal little thing you need examples lay aside those things give time to old-fashioned heartfelt pouring out of the Lord Jesus Christ until the Holy Ghost pours down upon your souls you'll get beside yourself what I thought we wasn't supposed to get beside ourselves but the man said you will get beside yourself maybe you can get with Jesus if you get away from yourself once amen he said you can't be yourself be with yourself and Jesus you find out you're the biggest enemy you got isn't that the truth if I can get William Branham out of the way Jesus can have a wonderful time but you've got to get him out of the way you believe brother Branham struggled oh he sure did so then you start see they started throwing light-footed feeling wonderful why they were following the pillar of fire god going before them and when he cut away through the Red Sea and she walked up and when they got on the other side and got back to Earth again their feet on the ground they look around after the spirit went off of them and they seen what had happened they got excited they got so excited till Moses raised up his hands and began to sing in the spirit a song that had never been written see and Miriam his sister the prophetess really a woman could prophesy could carry an office of a prophetess oh my that was the celebrity of the crowd amen she got so excited she grabbed a tambourine and began to beat the tambourine and dance notice brother Brennan said after the Spirit came off of them he said after the Spirit came off of them they weren't dancing because the spirit was making them they were dancing because when they got out from under the spirit they recognized what God had done while they were in the spirit that gave them more reason to dance and the daughters of Israel followed her up and down the banks beating the tambourine and dancing Hallelujah he said if that ain't an old-fashioned Pentecostal camp meeting I'd never seen one in my life brother if this is the latter rain that must have been the former Reign hallelujah what is it the same Holy Ghost same Pillar of Fire same Redeemer walking in light moving on what a Time a lot of time it's one thing to eat that word and it be sweet in your mouth but the Perfection of the Bride is not coming because the word was sweet in your mouth the Perfection of the Bride starts coming once it gets down into the innermost being and starts turning you sick because it's asking you for something that word is requiring something a total surrender from unbelief a total deliverance from unbelief are you ready Bill a total deliverance from unbelief and when that starts getting down in there and it starts changing the way you celebrate your holidays and the way you dress and the way you live your everyday life it starts getting bitter in the belly but it is necessary for this word to transition from the sweetness of your mouth to the bitterness of your belly because the last of Revelation 10 gives you your commission we see brother branham's commission we see the commission Angel the Covenant we see what John had to do in Revelation 10 but there's something you and I will have to do prophesy again prophesy again and you can't let something come up that hasn't gone in so John experienced that when he started eating that book it tasted like honeycomb then he swallowed it see as long as you just make yourself a friend of the message Guilty By Association only it'll just be sweet to you you sell out and start living it cover up your nakedness when you're in the world you start making some changes in your life and what was sweet in the beginning they'll get down there in your belly and start costing you something and you'll feel like you need to be sick and then you'll want to spit up you'll want to let that out that's turning around you just ask some of them that's been sick and they'll tell you you don't want to leave that down in there you want to get rid of it and that's exactly what God had in mind I'll give them a message that's so sweet that they'll want to chew it and once they chew it it'll get down their belly it'll start costing them something they'll go through a period of time it'll look like to the world that they're just laying in the sun ripening and nothing really much is going on because the world won't be able to see what's taking place on the inside but in that very last of the last days that which has been churning on the inside of them will start coming out and they will prophesy again to many kindreds many tongues many people come on that's when the message will do what the prophet said it will sweep through Asia coming out of the West Coast it'll sweep through Asia Korea Japan and all the way back to the city of Jerusalem where it started this move of God started on the day of Pentecost travel out in Jerusalem the cycle is not complete until it comes home that's what he said and that mean it had to go it had to move all the way you must go west it had to go all the way the West how many of you know when you leave the coast of California and you start moving it's not long before you're moving you just continue to move on you start moving through the east he said it circles the globe and he said it has to come through Asia which is a nation that's just now beginning to wake up a continent just now waking up the the message just now striking Japan after all of these years I told you many years ago about a man who came here and wrote a check for a hundred thousand dollars and asked me to relocate with my family and take the message to Japan and he would not only give me that offering but pay for all of my expenses and it was not the will of the Lord but it expressed his desire for God to do something in Japan and when it got time for God to begin to do something in Japan look what he did he sent two little ladies here from Japan to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and now they tell me there's more than one group but I'm in contact with the one group where sister emiko is and where sister fousey and Koya are that little group is growing and God is blessing them and expanding but it's just the infancy it's just the beginning and Korea that has had a mighty Prayer Revival has not had a great outpouring yet of the message of the hour but he allowed seeds to be planted in the early 90s I was in Korea and we saw the seed beds of Revival beginning to form and so there is yet to be that Asia Awakening but it's coming and when it's finished its way through those Asian continents and countries what is it do it goes right back to the city where it all started God anointing two Prophets to take that message to the Jewish people the bride slipping out of here oh my let's stand we're nearer home we're nearer home than we were yesterday somebody give God a praise with me would you ready [Applause] let's just wait a minute and worship him a minute and see what the Lord will do before we go Hallelujah my mind to Calvary let's come and worship him where Jesus blessed and die for me I see his word his hands his feet [Music] My Savior all that cursory his body bound and drenched in tears they laid him down out enjoy says to the entrancy by heavy storms [Music] oh praise the name of

up your hand and let those around you see your hand up and because we're going to gather in just a moment and pray for these that have a hand up are you all looking around to see who has a hand why

right now ask the Lord to meet their need meet them at the point of their need just begin to release whatever the spirit of the Lord would give you for that person in prayer and let's see what God will do as we continue to sing that for another moment or two we'll soon be able to dismiss [Music] [Music] right now you are Jesus Christ yesterday and today and forever Lord I'm asking you to meet
