[0:00] no matter what a mess you made no matter
[0:03] how we really really really got off
[0:06] course
[0:08] he can redeem every year
[0:11] [Music]
[0:17] you better and I we better be busy
[0:20] finding out what the Lord has in our
[0:22] book
[0:23] come on and doing what he has we don't
[0:27] have time to pick up somebody else's
[0:29] dream or burden or Vision or thought we
[0:32] better just pick up and find out what
[0:34] the Lord has already written about us
[0:37] you knew every decision before I ever
[0:40] made it
[0:42] the consequences of every decision you
[0:45] knew the years that I would sometimes
[0:46] waste spinning my wheels because I had
[0:50] made a bad choice and I had sought to do
[0:52] my own will and not your will I want you
[0:55] to know today every bit of that can be
[0:57] redeemed I want to say that very
[0:59] carefully again you are not just a
[1:03] church member out there somewhere you
[1:05] were a part of the elected predestinated
[1:08] seed of Jesus Christ and because of that
[1:11] nothing about you nothing concerning you
[1:15] is unredeemable he can redeem every
[1:18] thought that he ever had toward you no
[1:22] matter what a mess I made no matter what
[1:25] a mess you made no matter how we really
[1:29] really really got off course he can
[1:33] redeem every year
[1:35] he can redeem every month he can redeem
[1:38] every hour
[1:39] to see every child of God has a book
[1:41] written about him or her God saw us in
[1:44] our fleshly form in the earth before we
[1:47] ever existed he saw our days he saw it
[1:51] all including our choices and decisions
[1:53] he knew then about our abilities our
[1:57] strengths he knew our gifts even then
[2:00] before the foundation of the world these
[2:04] thoughts were then recorded in the
[2:05] Heavenly record the death and Kingdom
[2:08] Purpose for each of Our Lives was
[2:11] written long before we were ever born
[2:15] not just the number of them
[2:17] but he saw the activities in them and he
[2:20] saw what we would accomplish in our
[2:23] lives our individual book is a written
[2:26] record of all which God planned for us
[2:29] and the kingdom impact that he has
[2:31] destined for each of Our Lives there's a
[2:35] battle going on and the battle is to get
[2:37] whatever is in the book about your life
[2:41] to manifest here on the Earth
[2:45] want to say it again there's a battle
[2:47] going on and that battle is to get
[2:49] everything written of you in God's book
[2:51] to come to pass at your destiny that's
[2:55] his plan that's his will
[2:58] are battling to get that to come to pass
[2:59] here on the earth and let me tell you
[3:01] something the way we battle for our
[3:03] destiny is not with guns
[3:07] the way we battle for our destiny is
[3:09] with tears it's with prayer it's with
[3:13] fasting it's with seeking the Lord even
[3:17] our Lord Jesus Christ 100 God 100 man
[3:20] was still on the earth and every day of
[3:23] his life here on the earth he was living
[3:26] out the volume of the book that had been
[3:29] written about him that's powerful it
[3:31] speaks of the sovereignty of God it
[3:34] speaks of the obedience to the
[3:35] commission and it speaks to every battle
[3:38] that our Lord went through the Bible
[3:39] said though he were a son yet learned he
[3:42] obedience what by the things he suffered
[3:45] and though he was tempted in all like
[3:47] manner as we are what did the Bible say
[3:49] about his overcoming power yet without
[3:52] sin so even our Lord
[3:56] was restrained to a life and a Ministry
[4:03] that had already been written in a book
[4:07] about him
[4:09] because Jesus was a hundred percent man
[4:12] he had a will
[4:15] how do we know that Gethsemane
[4:18] not my will nevertheless
[4:22] if at all possible let this cup pass
[4:24] from me nevertheless what did he say not
[4:28] my will
[4:31] so just because you have a book written
[4:33] about your life doesn't mean you don't
[4:35] have a will
[4:37] and it doesn't mean that there will not
[4:39] be times many times
[4:42] that your will and his will will be in
[4:46] conflict
[4:47] and it is in that moment that we must
[4:50] learn to quickly throw ourselves on the
[4:54] mercy of The Rock
[4:57] because whosoever followeth upon the
[4:59] rock shall be what
[5:01] broken but whosoever the rock shall fall
[5:04] upon shall be crushed to powder
[5:08] so it's better for you to say oh god
[5:10] I've been striving for my will throw
[5:13] yourself on the rock
[5:16] you will but your will be done
