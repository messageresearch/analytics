[0:01] But the Lord knows
[0:04] I can't live on
[0:07] the mountain.
[0:10] Not always.
[0:12] And so he picked out
[0:15] a valley
[0:18] for me.
[0:23] That's when he leads me
[0:26] beside
[0:29] still waters.
[0:32] Sing it with me.
[0:35] Somewhere
[0:37] in the valley
[0:40] below.
[0:45] And then he draws me
[0:49] aside
[0:51] to be tested
[0:54] and tried.
[0:56] But in the valley
[0:59] he restoreth
[1:03] my soul.
[1:08] And then he leads me
[1:11] beside
[1:14] still waters.
[1:17] [Music]
[1:20] Somewhere
[1:22] in the valley
[1:25] below,
[1:29] Jesus
[1:31] draws me
[1:34] aside
[1:36] to be tested,
[1:38] tested and tried. But it's in that
[1:42] valley.
[1:44] He restoreth
[1:47] my soul.
[1:51] Maybe you've been here. It's dark
[1:55] as a dungeon
[1:58] and the sun som
[2:01] shines.
[2:04] And when I'm there, I question, Lord,
[2:07] why must this be?
[2:14] Oh, but then he tells me
[2:18] there is strength through your sorrow.
[2:25] And there's victory
[2:29] in trials
[2:32] for me.
[2:34] And I want to thank you, Lord. Oh, he
[2:37] leads me
[2:40] beside
[2:42] still waters.
[2:45] [Music]
[2:48] And it's somewhere
[2:51] in the valley
[2:54] below.
[2:58] But that's when he draws me
[3:02] aside
[3:04] to be tested
[3:07] and tried.
[3:09] God in the valley,
[3:13] he restoreth
[3:16] my soul.
[3:18] First verse again.
[3:22] When I'm low
[3:24] in spirit,
[3:26] that's when I cry, Lord, lift me up.
[3:32] I really want to
[3:36] go higher
[3:38] with thee.
[3:40] [Music]
[3:44] But the Lord knows that I can't always
[3:48] live on a mountain.
[3:51] [Music]
[3:53] So he picks out he picks it out a valley
[4:00] for me. As long as the Lord's picking
[4:04] it, I'll be all right. And he leads me
[4:08] beside
[4:11] still waters.
[4:16] And it's somewhere
[4:19] in the valley
[4:22] below.
[4:26] And that's when he draws me
[4:30] aside
[4:32] to be tested
[4:35] and tried.
[4:37] But in the valley
[4:40] he restoreth
[4:44] my soul.
[4:46] Sing that line with me. Jesus
[4:50] draws me
[4:52] aside
[4:54] to be tested
[4:57] and tried.
[4:59] But it's in the valley.
[5:02] He restoreth
[5:06] my soul.
[5:09] I
[5:11] was sinking
[5:14] deep
[5:16] in sin.
[5:19] Far from the peaceful
[5:23] shore. Sing it just like that. Wrong
[5:25] tempo. very
[5:28] deeply
[5:30] stained within, sinking to rise, sinking
[5:35] to rise no more.
[5:41] But the master I hear you of the sea
[5:48] heard my despairing
[5:51] cry
[5:53] from the waters and from the waters
[5:59] lifted
[6:00] me now safe
[6:04] am
[6:06] I. Now pick it up and let's sing. It was
[6:09] love
[6:11] lifted me.
[6:15] Love
[6:17] lifted me
[6:22] when
[6:23] nothing else could help. His love
[6:30] lifted me.
[6:33] Oh, love
[6:36] lifted me.
[6:40] Love
[6:42] lifted me when nothing else could help.
[6:47] When
[6:48] nothing else could help.
[6:53] Love
[6:55] lifted
[6:57] me. One more time. Help me. Love
[7:02] lifted me. Where would you be without
[7:05] his love? Love
[7:08] lifted me
[7:11] when nothing else when
[7:14] nothing else could help. His love
[7:20] lifted me.
[7:23] Oh
[7:25] love
[7:27] lifted me.
[7:30] [Music]
[7:31] Love
[7:33] lifted me. Thank you, Lord. When nothing
[7:40] else could have
[7:43] love
[7:45] [Applause]
[7:47] lifted
[7:50] me.
[7:53] If you're thankful for love, give the
[7:54] Lord Jesus.
[7:58] [Applause]
