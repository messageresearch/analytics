TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you you [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and I want to say what a joy and a privilege it is to be able to come to you in the mighty name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ he is the same yesterday today and forever he's doing great and mighty things among his people here in the end time and I considered a great privilege to be a part of God's kingdom his economy what he's doing what he desires to do in the earth I invite you to contact our ministry all of the contact information is given to you on the screen we would love to hear from you we'd love to join with you in faith over any prayer requests that you might have if you have a praise report something that the Lord is done in your life a great testimony we'd love to hear that as well we'd love to be a service to you in any way that we can we take prayer serious and we take prayer requests serious and we pray over them each and every one and I just believe that there's such a season of open heavens I I really feel the favor of God on on what we're doing what what we're seeing happening right now it just feels like the blessing and the favor of god that's being poured out in many places around the world I'm thankful for the gospel channel I'm thankful for angel TV I'm thankful for God allowing these networks to be out there to stream also over the Internet all the different ways that God is using to get his word out to the hungry people everywhere many don't know the Lord and this program goes into places where I might not ever be able to go physically but by the grace of God and by this technology we're able to beam it right down and I believe we get the reports we hear from people in all kinds of places God is doing something and we are just thankful for that and it's all over I mean things are happening in so many different places around the world and I'm just believing God for more now we've been studying and I want to get right back in to the study so let's look to God's Word today okay in John chapter 20 we are going to read as we went off the air I was going to read more I didn't have time I used up my time so i just read verse 22 we're talking about exercising the senses of the Spirit where we're believing that we read him the scripture that when Adam took on the sin of Eve also in the Garden of Eden the Bible said if you take of this fruit you're going to die we know that Adams body didn't die his soul didn't die but something in Adam died what was it it was his spirit life he lost his ability to function in the spirit realm he lost that communion that oneness with God his creator now we know that God was not going to let it always be that way so he had a plan a plan of redemption he came down walked in an earthly body of course first he gave the law he gave the law he gave the prophets he gave the the teachings the commandments and he called people into that kind of a fellowship the requiring of the blood of goats and bulls and lambs and then ultimately in the fullness of time God Almighty stepped down into the earth in a human body in the form of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ and he paid the price for my salvation and for your salvation and then by by the Holy Spirit this act of regeneration that we go through when we accept the Lord Jesus when we accept his forgiveness we accept his life and when he breathes into us there is a resurrection of our spirit life the spirit life that Adam had in the beginning but that was lost because of the fall now we're reading here in John chapter 20 the Lord Jesus has been crucified he has died he has raised from the dead and now he's already appeared to Mary and now let's let's pick up the story in verse 19 John 20 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you Shalom Shalom and when he had so sad he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord when they recognized that this was the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you Shalom as my father hath sent me even so send I you as I have been sent I am now sending you and verse 22 is a powerful verse of scripture and when he had said this he breathed on them now that makes me want to just stop right there and pray Lord breathed on us breathe on your people release upon the earth the breath of the Living God and awaken the spirit man and the spirit life so that we as your children may be able to function again on both are in both the earthly realm and in the heavenly realm the spirit realm there's a whole dimension out there that we should be functioning in as spirit filled believers the realm of dreams and visions and visitations around where there is great angelic activity going on so many things are happening in the realm of the Spirit that you and I are supposed to be fully functioning in moving in and out of that realm as easy as we move in and out of the earthly realm that's where we're supposed to be we need something don't we need this resurrection life we need this breath of God breathed on us and when he has said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost are the Holy Spirit who so ever since you remit verse 23 they are emitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained now this is talking about by receiving the Holy Ghost by receiving the Holy Spirit you receive authority he gave unto them power he said Terry here in Jerusalem until you be endued with power power and authority to conduct the business of the father now this has happened if you're born again of the spirit of Jesus Christ then your spirit man has been resurrected and so you stand before your Creator today spirit soul and body the problem is our soul has been well exercised in fact it's been over stimulated because it's very easy for our soul to receive from this earthly environment and we talked about it we did a whole study and I I'm not going to bore you by going into all of that again but we talked about the doorways into the soul of man the the memory the imagination the conscious the affection and the reasonings all of these ways that the that the I want to say that the enemy but not just the enemy access is our soul but our soul is accessed through these doorways and the soul is very stimulated very entertained very carnal a lot of times although we've taught that the soul is not your enemy the way that you want to put things back into proper balance in your life is to exercise your spirit and the only way to exercise your spirit is to is to is to turn loose I know I said that three times didn't I I'm stuttering you just forgive me and let's move on okay the way to to come into that place is to lean into the things that God is trying to say to us and do for us in this hour try this go to bed tonight and before you go to sleep pray and say Lord Jesus I ask you to sanctify my dream life sanctify it I don't want evil dreams I don't want carnal dreams I don't want lustful dreams but I ask that you sanctify my mind and my thoughts and my dreams and that you speak to me in my dreams somebody said well that sounds like the New Age know it sounds like the Bible God has been speaking to man all through the scripture in dreams the enemy certainly likes to access us through dreams but God wants to speak to you through dreams and the more we learn to walk in our dual functionality functioning in the earthly realm functioning in the spirit realm then we're going to see our dreams speaking more directly to us God speaking more directly to us through our dreams I believe in vision I believe in open eye vision I believe the Lord can through your open I he can show you direction he can show you future events he can show you your destiny I believe in in in I I'm stuttering again I am so passionate about this subject that I have a hard time getting it out because I believe there's an invitation that's going out all over the world right now an invitation and God is saying don't you want to walk with me in communion like Adam don't you want me to come and have fellowship with you in the cool of the day don't you want to know and be constantly aware of my presence you're lying you know where most of us function today is we sometimes feel the spirit we sometimes feel the anointing we are sometimes aware of the presence of god but i believe that god wants us walking in something a whole lot more powerful than that i believe he wants us walking in a state of constant connection with the holy spirit this is what we're trying to create or stir up fertilize a hunger in you for because i believe it is so available and rarely accessed especially in our part my part of the world in the North American part of the world I think that many times in other parts of the world people walk in deeper places in the spirit I believe that's changing and and I believe it's going to change even more but the invitation is going out the door is open and God saying to you like he said to John come up I want to speak to you listen when we're walking in the realm of the Spirit even the word of God becomes new it becomes new because our soul is not getting everything and interpreting everything and sucking up everything but our spirit starts feeding on the word and the Holy Spirit starts taking the word quickening it making it alive I mean have you ever read a scripture over and over and over again and that's good yes that's good uh-huh that's good but then all of a sudden you read that same scripture at a time in your life when you need to hear God and it's like a light bulb goes off or a big spotlight comes down on a particular scripture and it's just made alive and quicker than you that's what we're talking about that's what we're talking about we're talking about the fullness and really that's like Jesus breathing on you and calling your spirit man to attention giving your spirit man full functionality again I believe that's where we're coming to when we repent of our sins and we invite and accept the Lord Jesus Christ to be our personal Savior we become born again like we read about in John where Nicodemus came and we read that we started off this series you must be born again born of the water and born of the Spirit when we are born again that part of us that has never fully functioned because of the fall our spirit man it comes to attention it is renewed it is resurrected and God says okay I'm going to have a connection with you that other people in the world don't have that's why the new age is so popular that's why witchcraft is so popular in all kinds of other forms of mysticism and so forth that are not biblically based it's because people are trying to contact the heavenly realm or the spirit realm and God's given you the ability to do that is a born-again believer and we're we're turning our faith loose in this hour and we're saying God we want your word we're in love with your word but we want it made alive and we want to hear from heaven and we won't clear direction and when we're walking in the mall or the market of the store and there's someone with a need we want the Spirit of God to quicken us and say now's the time we want to lay hands on somebody on the street corner and say be healed in the name of Jesus Christ and we not only want to do that we want God to honor it and we want to see them get up and this is happening in in token places all over the world but I believe there's a revival coming for the Bride of Christ where people wear where churches where ministries where young people especially particularly are going to be awakened in their spirit man and start walking in this place of oneness which will release to us a whole new realm of authority I'm telling you authority and if you want to read that again look at verse 22 and 23 of John chapter 20 and see if that doesn't sound like some mighty powerful authority that Jesus released when he breathed on them so when we're born again that which Adam lost is restored in us and our spirit life is quickened and it begins to function on some level within us thank God for that John chapter 3 verse 6 and 7 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit jesus said Marvel not that I say unto you you must be born again but it is there's a process of maturity there's a process of spiritual growth and our spirit has to be exercised we have to learn how to exercise the senses of our spirit man making us more aware of the spirit realm we're very aware of the earthly realm but we want to become more aware of the spirit realm I know I'm just often saying things over and over again during this teaching but I want to say it so many different ways that you receive it and that you lean into it and that you pray about it until God makes it alive like first Peter chapter 2 verse 2 says as newborn babes and that's what we are when we're born again we're just like little babies learning to live learning to function learning to trust the Lord we still deal with our temper we still deal with our passions we still deal with things as newborn babes but we are sincerely desiring the milk of the word because by the milk of the word we grow we learn we mature and I preached to you I've taught right on this program that we have a word of promise from the Lord that there's going to be a release of accelerated maturity one has taken some 30 years to learn in the spirit learning hard knocks learning by suffering learning by obedience I believe there's going to be a new generation of champions raised up in this hour that are going to receive this maturity very quickly very suddenly as a release of an anointing for that and so by teaching on this we're making preparation we're trying to prepare God a landing pad a place where he can come and manifest his promises in US and through us as spiritual baby this restored part of our being our spirit must now be developed we're born again so we we got back what Adam lost in the garden but in baby form and so we want to keep eating the word we want to keep leaning into the things of the Spirit soaking in the presence of God worshipping the Lord fasting because missing meals and and and being careful about our words you know there's different forms of fasting we've always the first form of fasting we think about is denying our self food I believe this is very very important part of crucifying the old nature of growing up spiritually but there's other types of fasting that we can walk in as well periods of time where we say I'm going to watch my words like I've never watched them before I'm going to be very careful about negative words and critical words and I'm going to release life because we know that we hold life and death the power of life and death in our tongue and I'm going to be very careful there are times of fasting where we might say I'm going to turn off the television I'm not going to watch anything that is not spiritually edifying I'm going to be very careful about the music that I listen to and even the company I keep i'm going to set aside some time to draw near to the Lord all of these spiritual disciplines are very important ways of exercising the sensitivity of our spirits so that we can hear from the Lord sometimes we hear from everybody but the Lord because he's speaking in a still small voice everybody else is screaming at us so we have to learn to shut out these loud voices sometime entertainment all the different things addictions and things the enemy uses to get us caught up we've got to learn to shut that off and draw away with the Lord and I just encourage you i believe i'm speaking to somebody very specifically today God is calling you to a life of a season especially a season in your life of just drawing aside and hearing from the Lord and I believe you'll come out of it if you're faithful and if you're obedient I believe you'll come out of it much stronger than you entered into it in fact it just works that way it just absolutely happens that way then we gain a new consciousness when we're born again we start gaining a new consciousness of these two realms how they operate within our being unfortunately there's not been enough teaching in the body of Christ and the soul and the spirit has these words have been interchanged even in in the in the Bible you have to look sometime in the original language to see which is being spoken about it may say spirit but the the original word is speaking more of the soul life it may say so but the original word is speaking more the spirit life so it's been very interchangeable and it has kind of blurred the line to such an extent that we have become a little bit out of balance with a big soul the soul is well nourished well well challenged well satisfied and our spirit man is just shrinking away and we've got to see that stopped we've got to see that change we've got to call for transformation we've got to just speak life over our own spirit there is great research we don't have time to go into the depth of it I don't even know if I understand the fullness of the research but there's great research that has been done a concerning the effect of words a Japanese scientist for one has done a lot of research over the power of words on water the crystals that form in water and words negative words spoken over the water and then analyzing the water even writing negative words on papers and taping it to the glass where there's water and then examining the water and seeing that none is forming but by speaking words of affirmation in life they have analyzed the water and has seen these beautiful crystal formations forming almost changing the chemical balance of the water and and it was done by words and you say well that sounds a little bit out there well the Bible tells us that I quoted the scripture moment ago we hold the power of life and death in the tongue and I just pray that God will help me and I can help you by teaching and and that the Lord will help you by a spirit that we just become extra sensitive to the words of a life that we speak over one another especially when you're speaking directly to one another that you you just take some thought and speak some words of affirmation and life over someone because the spirit needs to be strengthened anyway when we start gaining a new consciousness of these two realms that operate within us the soul realm which is the earthly realm and the spirit realm which is the heavenly realm now I want to close with an interesting scripture in first Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 49 it says and as we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly see dual functionality we have been a clear reflection of the earthly realm now God is saying also I want you to be able to reflect the heavenly realm the character of Jesus his attributes and by walking in his authority that is the oneness that is the union that we are reaching for and looking for it's easy for us to relate to the earthly realm and to function in the earthly which is the place of our natural environment and life but that's not all of who you are your true identity is not defined by only the earthly realm you see you are spirit and so and so your life there's life inside of you when you're born again you are carrying a part of the eternal life of God in your human spirit just as Adam hey just as Adam was carrying in himself a part of the breath of God the breads the lives of God he God breathed into him and Adam was carrying a part of God the spirit part of Adam was of the same essence as the Living God you as a born-again believer are carrying in you a part of the very essence of God it's that resurrection life the Bible said if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwelling you it shall also quicken your mortal body if that same spirit because of the Holy Spirit living in you quickening your human spirit bringing you back to that place of wholeness no wonder there's so much dysfunction in the world no wonder there's so much dysfunction in families because we're only functioning in part of our true identity the earthly part the human part the fleshly part even the soulish part and God is saying I'm going to have a people I mean it's clear in the scripture I'm going to have a people who don't just live in the earthly in the carnal I'm going to have a people that function fully completely holy the very God of peace the scripture said the very God of peace sanctify you wholly wh 0 ll Y holy complete Lee sanctify you purify you set you apart as a complete being spirit soul and body are you beginning to get it or am i confusing you more I pray you're beginning to get it I feel the anointing I feel that the Spirit of God is is having us to go slow I believe he's having us to repeat things not because you are not capable of catching it no no but because this is how the Spirit teaches us line upon line precept upon precept and remember that there are people watching these programs of all kinds of different levels of spirituality and scriptural understanding and I've asked the Lord I mean I don't have to be somebody I don't have to be some dynamic television preacher I think you can look at me and say I'm not after that but I have asked the Lord Lord I'm willing if it has to sound so simple you know if it's unpolished if I do stud around spin around a little bit it doesn't matter to me what matters to me is that you let me speak to whoever you've placed out there for me to speak into their life and let them get something from what I'm saying based on their level of understanding and let us never be satisfied with where we are spiritually let us all be reaching for more calling for more well my time is gone and I have to pray father right now in the name of Jesus we release the anointing of the Holy Spirit to prepare a bride that will function in complete wholeness spirit soul and body in the wonderful name of Yeshua we pray thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again bye-bye for today [Music] you [Music] you you
