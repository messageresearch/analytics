[19:34] hands. Oh, for now salvation flows for
[19:39] every man.

[21:45] sin? It's nothing but the blood, Lord.
[21:50] It's nothing but your
[21:52] blood. And what can make me whole? All I

[30:35] Hallelujah. We want to go to prayer
[30:37] today and take our needs to the
[30:40] Lord. All across the congregation, I
[30:43] know that your needs are probably many.
[30:45] You just want to make it known by the
[30:47] lifting up of the hand all across the
[30:50] building. The Lord sees those needs out
[30:52] across the stream. The Lord sees the
[30:55] need that uh you have. He knows what
[30:58] your needs are. Let's hold up Sister Ge
[31:01] and Sister Terry to the Lord this
[31:03] morning. And also Gwen and maybe Isaiah,
[31:07] too, not feeling well at home uh with a
[31:10] fever. Let's pray for them. All right.
[31:13] We want to hold these needs up to the
[31:15] Lord. We know that the Lord is well able
[31:17] to handle every one of them. Let's just
[31:20] go to prayer today. Heavenly Father, we
[31:23] just want to say thank you.
[31:26] You are God and you change not.
[31:31] You are above every
[31:33] God. And we thank you that we can come
[31:36] to you with boldness because of the
[31:39] blood of Jesus Christ. it it's not by
[31:42] our merits. It's not by our goodness.
[31:45] It's nothing that we can bring to you.
[31:49] But we come because the perfect lamb has
[31:52] been offered on our behalf. And Lord, I
[31:54] just am thankful for that today. So we
[31:58] come bringing our needs to you and we
[32:00] ask you to minister to every one of
[32:03] them. The hands that were raised, you
[32:05] see the need behind that hand. Whether
[32:08] it would be a healing or depression or a
[32:11] financial need, whatever it is, Lord, I
[32:14] thank you that you are well able to
[32:17] handle it out across the stream. I am
[32:20] asking you, Lord, to minister to the
[32:22] needs all across the world. Whatever the
[32:25] needs are, we know that there are people
[32:28] that stream this service that we don't
[32:30] know, but Father, we're asking you to
[32:32] meet their needs. whe whether they have
[32:35] a physical need or a spiritual need. I
[32:39] thank you that because of the living
[32:42] word, it can change
[32:45] situations. It can change
[32:48] circumstances. It can change us on the
[32:51] inside till that our circumstances no
[32:55] longer look as bad as they once looked.
[32:57] I thank you for that today, Lord. Do it
[33:00] across the stream. Do it in this house.
[33:03] I ask you, oh Lord, do what we cannot do
[33:07] for ourselves. Be El Shadai to us today.
[33:11] I ask you, Father, that you would
[33:14] minister through our pastor. Let his
[33:16] body be strong as he delivers the word.
[33:19] Let his voice be strong. And I pray the
[33:22] heavy anointing of the Holy Ghost to
[33:25] rest upon each one of us and him as he
[33:27] would deliver the word. May our ears be
[33:30] tuned to heaven's
[33:33] frequency. We bless you, Lord. Let every
[33:36] part of this service bring honor to your
[33:39] name. No man lifted up, but may you be
[33:43] lifted up. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:46] Christ, we declare these things and we
[33:49] thank you for them. In the name of Jesus
[33:52] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[33:56] Hallelujah.
[33:57] Hallelujah. Give him another
[34:00] praise.
[34:02] Hallelujah. For it
[34:06] reaches to the
[34:10] highest
[34:14] mountain and it
[34:17] flows to the
[34:20] lowest
[34:25] valley. The blood that gives me
[34:30] strength from
[34:33] day to
[34:35] day. It will
[34:39] never
[34:41] lose its
[34:45] [Music]
[34:47] power. Oh hallelujah. Give him another
[34:50] praise.
[34:54] Hallelujah.

[35:09] he?
[35:10] I know it. Amen. You may have your seats
[35:14] today. We're glad to have you in the
[35:17] house of the Lord. We are blessed to be
[35:19] here gathered together. Sister Flo, I'm
[35:22] glad to see you looking strong today
[35:25] back with us. Praise
[35:30] God. This friend of of Axels, we're glad
[35:34] that you're in the house of the Lord
[35:36] with us
[35:38] [Applause]
[35:41] today. Sister Trish, I believe I heard
[35:44] this was your niece. Is that correct?
[35:47] Cousin. All right. We're glad that she's
[35:49] here with us today.
[35:56] Oh, how blessed we are. Just blessed to
[35:59] be called a child of God. We're going to
[36:03] receive the tithe and the offering.
[36:04] We're glad that Joshua and Stephen are
[36:07] back this weekend. We're glad that the
[36:09] Lord saw fit for them to be able to be
[36:14] here. I see Sarah back there. I assume
[36:17] she has Wyatt with her. We're glad.
[36:19] Yeah, there he
[36:22] is. Clapping his hands with
[36:25] us. We're going to ask brother Cade to
[36:29] move over to the piano and give us a
[36:31] song. We're going to receive the tithe
[36:33] and offering. We're going to continue
[36:34] worshiping the Lord. This is the first
[36:37] Sunday of the month. And uh you know the
[36:40] Lord has just blessed us to be able to
[36:43] to be able to move and live and have our
[36:47] being to have sustenance to be able to
[36:51] uh pay a light bill and a water bill and
[36:54] have food on the table and clothes on
[36:56] our back. It's just because of him and
[36:59] we honor him with bringing our tithe to
[37:02] him which belongs to him and offering
[37:05] therewith. It's just a wonderful thing.
[37:08] We continue to believe the Lord that his
[37:12] work in Jerusalem is accomplished
[37:14] through us. Whatever part we have to
[37:16] play, we're praying over them. Uh many
[37:20] things happening in that nation every
[37:22] day. Uh those of you that may not have
[37:25] seen it, uh the the the Houthis sent a
[37:29] missile to uh Israel and their
[37:32] interception system for whatever reason
[37:34] didn't work and it landed very close to
[37:37] the Bengurian airport and it has the
[37:40] people shaken up more than usual when we
[37:43] just are praying and believing for the
[37:45] peace of Jerusalem and all of Israel,
[37:48] believing that God's purposes are
[37:50] accomplished in that land, but we're
[37:52] giving our tithe and our offering to the
[37:54] Lord, believing that every purpose that
[37:56] he has for us as a congregation that we
[37:59] accomplish and fulfill that. Brother
[38:02] Ellias, can I call on you and brother
[38:03] Austin Hodes, we're going to let these
[38:05] brothers come to you to give of your
[38:08] tithe and offering as brother Cade sings
[38:10] and leads us on to the preaching of the
[38:17] word.
[38:18] [Music]
[38:35] His heart was
[38:37] broken, mine was mened.
[38:41] [Music]
[38:43] He became sin. Now I am clean.
[38:51] The cross he carried bore my burden.
[38:56] [Music]
[38:59] The nails that held him set me
[39:04] free. His life for mine.
[39:09] his life for
[39:13] mine. How could it
[39:17] ever
[39:20] be that he would
[39:24] die? God's son would
[39:29] die to
[39:31] save a wrench like me.
[39:37] What love divine he gave his
[39:41] life for
[39:46] mine. His scars of
[39:48] suffering brought me
[39:50] [Music]
[39:53] healing. He spilled his blood to free my
[40:01] soul. His crown of thorns made me
[40:09] royalty. His sorrow gave me joy
[40:15] untold. His life were
[40:19] mine. His life were mine.
[40:25] How could it
[40:28] ever
[40:30] be that he would
[40:34] die? God's son would
[40:38] die to save a wretch like
[40:45] me. What love divine. He gave his
[40:50] life for mine.
[40:54] He was despised and rejected, stripped
[40:58] of his garments and
[41:01] oppressed. I am love and
[41:05] accepted and I wear a robe of
[41:10] [Music]
[41:11] rightuousness. His life for
[41:15] mine. His life for mine.
[41:21] Oh, how could it
[41:24] ever
[41:27] be that he would
[41:30] die? God's son would
[41:35] die to save a wrench like
[41:42] me. What love divine? He gave his
[41:46] life for
[41:49] mine. His life for
[41:53] mine. His life for
[41:57] mine. Tell me, how could it
[42:01] ever
[42:04] be that he would
[42:08] die? God's son would
[42:12] die to save a wretch like me.
[42:19] He was love divine. He gave his
[42:24] life for
[42:26] mine. And you are God
[42:29] alone. From before time
[42:33] began. You are on your
[42:37] throne. And you are God alone.
[42:42] And right
[42:44] now in the good times and
[42:47] [Music]

[43:32] began, you were on your throne.
[43:37] For you are God
[43:40] alone. And right now in the good times
[43:45] and
[43:47] bad, you are on your
[43:50] throne. Oh, you are God
[43:54] alone. You are God alone.
[43:59] [Music]
[44:06] Yes. Yes. Amen.
[44:09] Oh, aren't you thankful that he's God?
[44:12] He is God. He is God. He does not
[44:15] change.
[44:18] Oh, we praise you, Lord.
[44:21] We praise you. Hallelujah.
[44:24] Oh, aren't you thankful? Amen. Amen.
[44:27] Just a heart of thanksgiving to him. I I
[44:30] feel it today. a heart of thanksgiving
[44:32] for what he has done
[44:35] that he would take somebody out of the
[44:38] muck of
[44:39] sin. Raise him up. Chosen, chosen,
[44:43] chosen and elected. Oh, I thank you,
[44:46] Lord. Would you stand with us?
[44:49] Hallelujah. As we get ready to go to the
[44:52] word today,
[44:54] we worship you, Lord. We worship you. We
[44:58] worship you. Be flat. Thou art
[45:03] worthy.
[45:05] Thou art
[45:09] worthy.

[45:38] Gloryy and
[45:41] honor and
[45:45] power. For thou
[45:49] hast
[45:51] created, hast all
[45:54] things created.
[45:56] [Music]
[45:58] Thou hast
[46:02] created all
[46:08] things, and for thy
[46:13] pleasure they
[46:15] are
[46:18] created.
[46:20] Thou
[46:23] art. Would you engage and get your heart
[46:26] ready to hear the word Jesus? Oh,
[46:31] thou art
[46:34] worthy.
[46:36] Thou art worthy.
[46:40] [Music]
[46:42] Thou art

[46:50] Lord,
[46:52] to receive
[46:56] glory.
[46:58] Gloryy and

[47:16] created, hast all
[47:19] things created.
[47:22] Thou hast created. Thou hast created.
[47:28] All things
[47:32] and for thy pleasure and
[47:35] for Thank you. I needed another minute.
[47:38] Sorry.
[47:40] They are created.
[47:43] Oh
[47:45] [Applause]
[47:48] thou Lord. Just sing that part again
[47:51] right there. Would you?
[47:53] For thou
[47:56] hast created
[47:59] has all
[48:01] things created.
[48:05] Thou
[48:07] hast
[48:08] created all
[48:15] things and
[48:17] for thy
[48:20] pleasure they are they are
[48:25] created. Oh
[48:27] thou thou art
[48:30] worthy, oh
[48:33] Lord. Let's just tag it. And for thy

[48:42] pleasure they are. Woo.
[48:47] Because he liked it.
[48:50] Thou art
[48:54] worthy. Oh
[48:57] [Music]
[49:00] Lord. You're going to laugh. You're
[49:03] going to laugh at me, but have you ever
[49:06] looked at a
[49:07] giraffe and
[49:09] wondered why was the giraffe I love to
[49:13] see giraffes. I've seen them in the
[49:15] natural. But have you ever looked at one
[49:17] and wondered
[49:18] why was it made like
[49:21] that? Mostly neck. I guess I'm jealous.
[49:24] I don't have a neck, so I must be
[49:27] jealous of the giraffe. Or or a
[49:29] rhinoceros. I've seen them in person in
[49:32] the in the in the u game
[49:35] park and it looks like a an armored
[49:40] tank on short fat stubby legs. But don't
[49:45] you let it fool you. It can move. Did
[49:49] you know more people are killed by a
[49:51] hippopotamus than a lion? Right?
[49:55] Who would who would have designed
[49:58] something that looks like a
[49:59] hippopotamus? And why did he do it? You
[50:03] probably don't think of silly things
[50:04] like that, but I have the answer. Yes,
[50:06] sir. I have the answer. For his
[50:09] pleasure. Absolutely. All things were
[50:12] created for his pleasure. It pleased him
[50:16] to give the giraffe that big old long
[50:19] neck. And it pleased him to make that
[50:21] rhinoceros look like all horn and
[50:24] armored tank. It pleased him. It pleased
[50:27] him to make you. That's right.
[50:30] You were created for his pleasure.
[50:33] Hallelujah.
[50:34] You were born to serve his purpose. You
[50:37] weren't here to serve your own agenda.
[50:40] He created you to serve his. Amen. If
[50:43] you will stay engaged, I'll ask you to
[50:46] be seated just a moment, but but stay
[50:48] with me and your attention if you
[50:51] possibly
[50:52] can. I love his presence.
[50:55] I love his presence. I love him. And
[50:58] when you love him, you love to be where
[51:00] he is. And he doesn't just dwell at
[51:03] church. He lives in his people. This was
[51:07] his desire from the beginning. It only
[51:10] took 6,000 years to get it to where he
[51:13] could restore it all the way back to his
[51:16] original intention. We're 6,000 years in
[51:20] God's plan, give or take a little bit.
[51:23] And now he has found a people that he
[51:26] chose to live in, dwell in, that his
[51:30] word would become flesh in them. What a
[51:34] divine mystery. How ought we to live
[51:37] because we have this truth. We ought to
[51:40] live different than those around us. Not
[51:42] with bride pride, but with humility and
[51:46] gr gratitude and thanksgiving. I tell
[51:49] him every day, not that he needs to be
[51:51] reminded, but I tell him every day,
[51:53] you're sovereign God. You don't need my
[51:57] permission. You don't need President
[51:59] Trump's permission. You don't need
[52:01] Putin's permission. You're a sovereign
[52:03] God. Just come on and do what you desire
[52:06] to do and don't let me get in your way.
[52:10] Let me be in the move but not in your
[52:12] way. Do you feel that way? Wouldn't you
[52:15] like for God to use you more? Wouldn't
[52:18] you like to be available to him more and
[52:23] more and more? Greetings to you and uh
[52:26] to those who are streaming this service.
[52:29] Uh, we don't always know where you're
[52:32] from unless you tell us. But I saw we
[52:34] have saints in in Norway, in the
[52:37] Netherlands, in South Africa. Believers
[52:41] are gathered with us in Indiana, in
[52:44] Uganda,
[52:46] uh, West Africa. Praise God. Arkansas,
[52:51] uh, I'm just looking at those who
[52:52] mentioned their place. I'm thanking God
[52:56] for that. That's on YouTube. And then
[52:58] over here, Australia, wow, you're a long
[53:02] way away. South Africa, just across the
[53:06] river there. And and it goes on. Thank
[53:10] you for joining us this morning. I feel
[53:13] like God is here. His presence is with
[53:16] us. I wanted to thank you, and I didn't
[53:18] do it Tuesday night because I wanted to
[53:20] do it when more of you were here, but I
[53:23] want to thank you from the bottom of my
[53:25] heart for the for the lunch, a picnic,
[53:28] lunch, uh, whatever you would call it. I
[53:30] did, some people said a party. Well, it
[53:33] wasn't really a party. Uh, it was just a
[53:36] a lunchon. How about that? Uh, I didn't
[53:39] wear a hat. You have to wear a hat if
[53:41] it's a party, I think. But anyway, uh
[53:44] the food was better than it usually is
[53:46] and it's usually mighty good, but there
[53:48] was there are those times that
[53:52] everything hits the spot. And Sunday,
[53:55] everything hit the spot. And people ask
[53:59] me, "What what are your favorite things
[54:00] that people cook?" I said, "Well, you
[54:02] can look at me and tell I like most all
[54:04] of it, but I do have some favorites.
[54:07] It's not a It's not a It's not a church
[54:09] gathering without Sister Jeffrey's deled
[54:12] eggs, but I call them angled eggs
[54:14] because I deal with enough devils in
[54:17] prayer. I don't need
[54:20] to. And Mimi's Mexican casserole. I got
[54:24] to have them. I've got to have Sister
[54:26] Alfreda Sauerkraut. And well, anyway, it
[54:29] goes on and Sister Laurel's cake. and uh
[54:34] she knows the way to to uh personalize
[54:37] it. It don't even need my name on it.
[54:39] Long as it has Butterfingers on it,
[54:40] everybody knows it's
[54:42] mine. Thank you all so much. Every card.
[54:46] Um I've always read every card. You can
[54:49] ask my wife. I've kept every
[54:53] card. I have them filed by
[54:56] year. You ever change your mind about
[54:58] me, I'm going to get yours out and read
[55:00] it to you. remind you what you used to
[55:03] think about
[55:04] me. But uh it just seemed like they
[55:07] meant so much. They they're you know I I
[55:11] know what it is. I'm
[55:13] getting you know what you know we don't
[55:15] have to finish the
[55:17] sentence. And everything means more. It
[55:20] just does. And uh Josiah handed me his
[55:24] and I read it and I cried and and then I
[55:26] read the next one and I cried and and I
[55:28] just said maybe I ought not to do this
[55:30] right
[55:31] now anyway. But it was a real real sweet
[55:34] blessing. I'm I was still getting cards
[55:36] and presents today. That's all
[55:39] right. It's only been two weeks since my
[55:41] birthday. That's all right. Keith,
[55:43] that's great. Anyway, I wanted to thank
[55:46] every one of you. I truly did. Uh you
[55:49] made it very special. I had so many
[55:51] texts and and uh and just all kinds of
[55:54] greetings. Thank you. Uh really I
[55:56] appreciate it. Uh this Tuesday, May the
[55:59] 6th, is Brother Eddie and Sister Janet
[56:03] Miller's wedding anniversary. And and I
[56:06] didn't write down how many, but I can I
[56:09] can look here real quick if you'll give
[56:11] me just a second. I I didn't write down
[56:13] how many, but they have been married a
[56:16] bunch of them. I mean, a bunch of years.
[56:20] Uh, this coming this coming uh
[56:24] Tuesday. I'm so sorry if you're in a
[56:28] hurry. Well, I don't know what to tell
[56:33] you.
[56:34] 53 53 years they've been married and we
[56:39] want to send a happy anniversary
[56:40] greeting to them today. Many miles from
[56:43] us, but we love them.
[56:46] [Applause]
[56:50] The next day is Wednesday, of course,
[56:53] May the 7th. And that is the day uh that
[56:56] uh there are there's a little maybe a
[56:59] little controversy over what day, but
[57:00] it's uh it's certainly the time to
[57:02] remember. How about that? But May the
[57:04] 7th every year, we remember that brother
[57:07] Brandham received his commissioning. Uh
[57:10] maybe it was in a cave, maybe it was in
[57:12] a cabin. Uh but nonetheless, it
[57:16] happened. He was commissioned. The proof
[57:18] of the commissioning was the fruit of
[57:21] the ministry.
[57:25] I might not know exactly the day or the
[57:26] hour, and there may be arguments over
[57:28] the
[57:29] location, but the reality is he was
[57:32] commissioned. How do you know that?
[57:33] Because I'm part of the fruit
[57:36] and I know that God certainly sent him.
[57:39] That's also a very good friend of mine
[57:41] has a birthday that day. Brother Wilson
[57:43] Henry, I'm going to spare him uh the
[57:46] number. I'm not going to tell anybody
[57:48] the number, but I I'll just tell you it
[57:50] is uh it's up there. And uh he has been
[57:55] an encouragement to me more over the
[57:57] last few years than ever before. And I
[58:00] appreciate that encouragement so much.
[58:03] And he not only sends me amens and text,
[58:06] but he also will look back through his
[58:09] notes. He has a long life of preaching
[58:12] and he looks back through his notes and
[58:14] shares nuggets to go along with mine.
[58:16] And I treasure them and I appreciate him
[58:19] and also sister Marlene and if they're
[58:22] streaming this morning, uh, I pray that
[58:25] you have a very blessed birthday.
[58:27] Brother Henry, God bless you so much.
[58:30] Thursday, May the 8th. Brother Brandham
[58:32] had that great experience in 1960 of
[58:35] going beyond the curtain of time. I'm
[58:37] looking forward to that. I'm looking
[58:39] forward to stepping there myself. That's
[58:42] also Jacob's birthday, sister uh Flo.
[58:45] So, we'll pray for Jacob uh that God
[58:47] will always have his way in his life.
[58:50] And then Saturday is Sarah's birthday.
[58:52] And she must have come at this time so
[58:56] that I would be able to announce her
[58:58] birthday.
[58:59] She made a long trip just to have a
[59:01] birthday greeting. But uh happy birthday
[59:03] to her uh on
[59:07] Saturday. And one more. I'm I'm sending
[59:10] some birthday love all the way to Japan.
[59:14] That's a long way from here. Saturday
[59:16] also, Sister Emiko's birthday. The first
[59:19] sister that we first Japanese sister
[59:22] that I ever baptized in the name of the
[59:24] Lord Jesus Christ. Did you baptize
[59:26] others? Yes, I have. I've baptized quite
[59:29] a few I I think uh over 20 in in uh in
[59:33] Israel and uh that were from Japan. Many
[59:36] from from Singapore, many from Taiwan,
[59:39] but quite a few from Japan. But she was
[59:42] the first. And uh when you get a when
[59:45] you are a person living on the other
[59:47] side of the world in Japan and you get a
[59:49] revelation that you've not had the
[59:50] proper baptism, you get on an airplane
[59:52] and fly all the way to Alabama or
[59:54] Georgia to be baptized. you know, you've
[59:57] had a revelation
[59:59] and I send her lots of love and respect
[1:00:01] and honor. Uh, Sister Emo, God is good.
[1:00:05] I'm going to preach about three and a
[1:00:07] half hours today.
[1:00:12] No, maybe not. I just thought I'd say
[1:00:15] that for the visitors. I thought I but I
[1:00:18] forgot to look at the young man here to
[1:00:19] see if he was he going to pass out. Are
[1:00:21] you going to pass out if I preach that
[1:00:22] long? Listen, they tell me a good movie
[1:00:24] is three hours long.
[1:00:26] Uh, so if that's the case, then I have
[1:00:29] at least three hours to play with. I've
[1:00:31] been wrestling with the Lord, but I
[1:00:32] think I'm going to obey him. Sister, uh,
[1:00:35] Laurel, you you come back to the piano.
[1:00:37] Not that brother Kate is not very
[1:00:39] capable, but uh, he has a lot hanging in
[1:00:43] the balance. If he messes
[1:00:53] up, he might be single the rest of his
[1:00:56] life if
[1:00:59] he did throw the clay
[1:01:03] away. I don't know why Sister Laura
[1:01:05] looks so nervous because she has nothing
[1:01:08] to
[1:01:10] lose. Do you think you think Beth, what
[1:01:14] key is it? Uh, he didn't throw the clay
[1:01:17] away. Is it E
[1:01:18] flat? F. Is that where you
[1:01:22] are? Let's try
[1:01:24] it.
[1:01:26] Empty and
[1:01:29] broken. I came back to him. Tiffany,
[1:01:34] this is for you. a
[1:01:37] vessel
[1:01:40] unworthy and so
[1:01:42] scarred by sin. Oh, but he did
[1:01:47] not
[1:01:49] despair. He just started
[1:01:53] over
[1:01:55] again. And I bless the
[1:02:00] day he didn't throw the clay away.
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:08] over and
[1:02:11] over. He molds
[1:02:14] me and makes
[1:02:17] me
[1:02:19] into his
[1:02:22] likeness. He
[1:02:24] fashions the
[1:02:26] clay. Oh, a
[1:02:30] vessel of honor.
[1:02:34] I
[1:02:35] am
[1:02:37] today. And it's all because
[1:02:42] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:50] away. Now he
[1:02:53] is the
[1:02:56] potter and I'm just the clay.
[1:03:02] all
[1:03:03] molded in his
[1:03:06] image. He really wants
[1:03:09] me to
[1:03:11] stay. But when I
[1:03:14] stumble and when I fall and when my
[1:03:20] vessel
[1:03:21] breaks, oh, he just picks up all those
[1:03:26] pieces. He does not throw the clay
[1:03:33] away.
[1:03:35] Over and over. Are you singing it with
[1:03:38] me? He molds
[1:03:41] me and makes
[1:03:44] me
[1:03:46] into his
[1:03:49] likeness. He
[1:03:51] fashions the clay.
[1:03:54] Oh, a
[1:03:57] vessel of
[1:03:59] honor I
[1:04:02] am
[1:04:04] today. And it's all because
[1:04:09] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[1:04:15] away. I wanted to sing this for her.
[1:04:20] He is the
[1:04:23] potter. I
[1:04:25] am the
[1:04:28] clay and
[1:04:30] molded in his
[1:04:33] image. He really wants me to
[1:04:38] stay. But when I stumble, I do. when I
[1:04:44] fall and when my
[1:04:47] vessel breaks. Oh, he just picks up all
[1:04:52] the broken pieces. He does not throw the
[1:04:58] clay away. Let me hear you sing it with
[1:05:00] me.
[1:05:03] Over and over. I don't know how many
[1:05:06] times he molds me.
[1:05:09] He makes
[1:05:11] me
[1:05:13] into his
[1:05:16] likeness. Oh, he
[1:05:18] fashions the
[1:05:20] clay of
[1:05:24] vessel of
[1:05:27] honor I
[1:05:29] am
[1:05:31] today. And it's all because
[1:05:36] Jesus didn't
[1:05:39] throw the clay
[1:05:42] away of a
[1:05:45] soul of
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:48] honor. I
[1:05:51] am
[1:05:53] today. And it's all because
[1:05:58] Jesus didn't
[1:06:00] throw the clay
[1:06:05] away. Praise God. Aren't you glad he
[1:06:09] doesn't? He
[1:06:10] didn't. He kept us. Praise his
[1:06:15] name. Praise his
[1:06:17] name. Praise his
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:20] name. Praise his name. Amen. I came back
[1:06:24] to him, the songwriter said, broken,
[1:06:28] empty, scarred by sin. He didn't
[1:06:31] despair.
[1:06:32] He didn't say, "What am I going to do
[1:06:34] with you now?" He just started over. I
[1:06:37] don't know how many times he's had to
[1:06:39] start over on me. But I'm so thankful
[1:06:42] that his mercy endures forever. Amen.
[1:06:45] Would you give God thanks for these
[1:06:48] musicians, leading of worship, all the
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:55] Stand with me and let's go to Daniel
[1:06:58] this morning in the Old Testament,
[1:07:00] chapter
[1:07:03] 2. It's been one month since we stepped
[1:07:08] away for a little
[1:07:10] season on our
[1:07:13] series concerning the spirit of offense.
[1:07:17] I've enjoyed the
[1:07:19] break. It was getting a little heavy.
[1:07:22] And I was hoping to take one more week
[1:07:26] and uh but he
[1:07:28] won two things. I I struggled yesterday
[1:07:32] uh wanting to go in a different
[1:07:34] direction and he kept pulling me and
[1:07:36] pulling me back and then in the night he
[1:07:39] he made it clear to me. I'm so thankful
[1:07:42] to have leadership.
[1:07:45] If I had to make the own my own decision
[1:07:49] all the time, I I know I would make the
[1:07:51] wrong one. I get sometimes paralyzed by
[1:07:54] the decision-making process. Do you? So,
[1:07:58] I'm always thankful when he steps in. He
[1:08:00] stepped in and and uh I'm going to obey
[1:08:03] him. And then the other thing was I woke
[1:08:05] up this morning singing. He didn't throw
[1:08:07] the clay away. And Tiffany was on my
[1:08:09] mind and I wanted to sing it for her.
[1:08:11] And then I thought, well, the hours, you
[1:08:13] know how you do. And and then I thought
[1:08:17] we were having another special song. And
[1:08:18] I thought, well, surely we won't have
[1:08:20] three. But anyway, uh I wish that we
[1:08:23] would just obey him, all of us, the
[1:08:26] minute he nudges us. But sometimes he
[1:08:28] has to nudge again.
[1:08:30] Um sometimes he has to do a little more
[1:08:33] than nudge. Some of us need a good kick
[1:08:36] in the seat of the pants sometime, but
[1:08:38] he knows how. Daniel 2 verse 21 and 22.
[1:08:43] And he changeth the times and the
[1:08:46] seasons. He removeth kings, and setth up
[1:08:51] kings. He giveth wisdom unto the wise,
[1:08:56] and knowledge to them that know
[1:09:00] understanding. We need to discover this
[1:09:03] morning who the he is. Because it is
[1:09:06] also stated in the book of Daniel and
[1:09:09] another place in scripture that the
[1:09:11] enemy seeks to change times and seasons
[1:09:15] for the wearing out of the saints. But
[1:09:17] it's not only the antichrist spirit that
[1:09:20] wants to change times and seasons. It
[1:09:23] it's also ultimately above all in God's
[1:09:27] hands. And he's the one who says, "Your
[1:09:30] trial is expired. I'm going to give you
[1:09:32] victory over it and move you on to the
[1:09:34] next one." You know, we don't always get
[1:09:36] deliverance out of a situation when we
[1:09:38] want it. But I'm telling you, he is the
[1:09:41] victor. And as long as you've got Jesus,
[1:09:44] you've got the victor. And that means
[1:09:46] the victory is yours because he won it
[1:09:49] on your behalf. But it's God who
[1:09:52] ultimately says, "Nope, another time
[1:09:54] around the mountain." That's right.
[1:09:57] You're not going into the promise just
[1:09:58] yet. The inheritance is not yours just
[1:10:00] yet. Circle around one more time. It's
[1:10:03] he him. It's him. It's him. It's God.
[1:10:06] It's not the devil. It's him. It's God.
[1:10:08] Your creator. He's the one. He removeth
[1:10:11] kings and setth up kings. The scripture
[1:10:14] says the the heart of the king is in the
[1:10:16] hand of the Lord. Doesn't matter who the
[1:10:18] king serves. God knows how to move his
[1:10:21] heart. He's he's sovereign. But then in
[1:10:25] verse 22, it it says, "He, same God,
[1:10:29] revealth the deep and secret things. He
[1:10:34] knoweth what is in the darkness, and the
[1:10:38] light dwelleth with him. He not only
[1:10:42] knows the unfathomable riches of of
[1:10:46] revelation and truth, those things that
[1:10:49] have not yet been revealed to us, made
[1:10:51] real to us personally. There are things
[1:10:54] in the message, I know you're standing,
[1:10:56] there are things in the message that
[1:10:58] have been taught to us from the
[1:11:01] scripture. Uh, and God has faithfully
[1:11:04] through the years quickened those things
[1:11:07] to make them personal revelations. You
[1:11:10] know, I'm not a person who can live my
[1:11:12] life based only on brother Random said.
[1:11:15] Brother Brandham said, brother Brandham
[1:11:16] said I have to find and see it as he
[1:11:19] taught us. He trained us to to look for
[1:11:22] it in the scripture. And when you can
[1:11:24] dovetail that thing together, then God
[1:11:27] starts revealing it to you personally.
[1:11:30] And and the Godhead is not something you
[1:11:32] just can can see because someone says it
[1:11:35] a certain way. It's got to be made
[1:11:37] personal. I think there are people
[1:11:39] around the message who don't believe
[1:11:41] that uh that we can have that that
[1:11:44] personal individual uh quickening of
[1:11:46] truth. But if we don't, we don't have
[1:11:49] anything to fight with. You can't fight
[1:11:51] with somebody else's revelation. You can
[1:11:54] only fight with yours. It's not a hope
[1:11:56] so or a maybe so or I think so. It has
[1:11:59] to be a no. in the last hour. I asked
[1:12:03] the Lord diligently yesterday afternoon,
[1:12:06] uh, why are you bringing me back? I'd
[1:12:09] like a a few more weeks of next weekend
[1:12:12] is Mother's Day, so we will maybe try to
[1:12:14] have something for the sisters and and
[1:12:16] and why don't we just wait till after
[1:12:18] that? Lord, why are you bringing it
[1:12:20] back? Bringing me back to it for this
[1:12:23] particular Sunday. I felt like the
[1:12:25] spirit of the Lord began to minister to
[1:12:27] me that it's because he is about to send
[1:12:30] a search light. I I appreciate that
[1:12:34] because the search light of his love,
[1:12:36] the spirit's light, the light of the
[1:12:39] Holy Ghost, he's about, I feel like, to
[1:12:42] send that again, another wave of that in
[1:12:44] our lives as individuals to to search
[1:12:47] out the things. If we're carrying scars
[1:12:51] or wounds or offense that we have not
[1:12:54] yet submitted to the blood of Jesus
[1:12:57] Christ, I believe God's not quite
[1:12:59] through digging. and he began to talk to
[1:13:02] my heart. Then in the late afternoon, uh
[1:13:05] I'm going to I'm going to show uh even
[1:13:08] the deep things that that people are yet
[1:13:11] carrying. And I'm doing it for my glory,
[1:13:13] not not to embarrass anybody or or to or
[1:13:16] to condemn. May I just say this to you
[1:13:19] that God's ultimate purpose in putting
[1:13:22] his finger on your life is always
[1:13:25] redemption.
[1:13:26] It's never condemnation. It's never to
[1:13:30] judge, condemn, or cause you to feel
[1:13:32] guilty. It's to cause you to feel
[1:13:34] convicted. And when you feel convicted,
[1:13:37] guess what you do? You cry out to him.
[1:13:39] And he gets to step in and rescue you
[1:13:42] and be a redeemer of that situation.
[1:13:46] It's God who reveals the deep and secret
[1:13:48] things, the
[1:13:50] truths, and also the dark things, the
[1:13:54] things that are weighing us down, the
[1:13:57] things that we may not even be aware of.
[1:14:00] He knows what's in the darkness and the
[1:14:03] light dwelleth with him. If you believe
[1:14:05] that, say amen. Father, thank you right
[1:14:08] now that you've given us another
[1:14:10] opportunity to gather around your word.
[1:14:13] We remind the atmosphere that Satan is
[1:14:16] defeated on every hand and the blood of
[1:14:20] Jesus Christ is against him and the
[1:14:22] grace of God has redeemed his people in
[1:14:25] this last hour. We are here to to be all
[1:14:29] that you have created us to be. We don't
[1:14:31] want to be anything other than what you
[1:14:34] desire for us to be. And we want you to
[1:14:36] turn uh as the old-timers used to pray,
[1:14:40] turn the search light of your love onto
[1:14:43] my soul and search me and know me and
[1:14:47] try me and find if there be any wicked
[1:14:50] way in me. If there's any unforgiveness
[1:14:53] in us, if there's any bitterness in us
[1:14:56] yet this morning, Lord, put your finger
[1:14:59] on it. And then give us the mighty grace
[1:15:02] that we're going to need, the amazing
[1:15:04] grace that we're going to need to repent
[1:15:07] and to move past it while reconstructing
[1:15:11] our future. We're thankful that because
[1:15:13] of you, our future is not determined by
[1:15:16] our past. Our future is determined by
[1:15:19] our revelation. So reveal to us again a
[1:15:23] new aresh today who we are to be and the
[1:15:26] purpose of your dealing with us. And we
[1:15:29] ask for this help in the mighty name,
[1:15:32] the exalted name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah. And the
[1:15:37] saint said, you may be
[1:15:40] seated. Uh God
[1:15:43] knows this is this is crazy. If you if
[1:15:46] you looked at this title, it takes a
[1:15:47] half a page to get all this in because
[1:15:49] we've got several series going at one
[1:15:51] time. This is part 24. I'm just telling
[1:15:54] you this for fun. This is part 24 of
[1:15:57] Above all else. And this is part 13 of
[1:16:01] the comprehensive teaching on the spirit
[1:16:03] of offense. And this is part three of
[1:16:06] the subtle spell. Now you know why I
[1:16:08] didn't particularly want to go back to
[1:16:09] it. uh the subtle spell how manipulation
[1:16:14] and control uh will enter through a
[1:16:16] place of offense in your life. We want
[1:16:19] to be free from uh all control other
[1:16:22] than his control where he leads
[1:16:25] me. That's where I want to follow. And I
[1:16:29] believe we have Holy Ghost leadership in
[1:16:31] this hour. He lives inside. He's not
[1:16:34] controlling us from the outside in, but
[1:16:36] he's rather controlling us from the
[1:16:38] inside out. And so I would like to just
[1:16:41] call this little section here uncovered
[1:16:43] by the word exposed by the light. I want
[1:16:47] you to remember that God knows what
[1:16:49] darkness tries to hide. There's it's the
[1:16:52] very nature of darkness to try to
[1:16:54] conceal something. But God's got an
[1:16:57] answer for it because he revealth the
[1:16:59] deep and secret things as we just read
[1:17:01] in Daniel
[1:17:03] 2:22. No plot is too hidden from him. No
[1:17:06] heart is too shadowed. No motive is too
[1:17:10] deeply buried. God is not intimidated by
[1:17:14] secrecy. It is his nature to be the
[1:17:17] revealer of secret things, good and bad
[1:17:20] and ugly. In Luke chapter 8, he gave me
[1:17:24] all of these scriptures last evening to
[1:17:27] sort of introduce where we're going this
[1:17:29] morning. So bear with me. Luke chapter 8
[1:17:32] verse 16-18. No man when he had lighted
[1:17:36] a candle coverth it with a vessel or
[1:17:39] putteth it under a bed but setth it on a
[1:17:43] candlestick that they which enter in may
[1:17:46] see the light. Now I know that's just a
[1:17:48] simple analogy but I began to think of
[1:17:50] that. Uh imagine the electricity is off
[1:17:54] and the house is pitch black dark. It's
[1:17:56] amazing to me how dark a house can get
[1:17:59] when the power's off. And uh because
[1:18:02] there's not even the residual light of a
[1:18:05] of a of a modem or or uh something like
[1:18:09] that, you know, the VCR or whatever you
[1:18:12] might have uh that has a little light on
[1:18:14] it that we have air purifiers in our
[1:18:16] house and they have little lights on,
[1:18:17] but when the power is off, all those
[1:18:19] little blue lights are gone and it's
[1:18:21] dark and and it would be it would be so
[1:18:24] foolish of me, Aaron, to to say, "Well,
[1:18:27] we're going to light a candle. We've got
[1:18:30] drawers of candles for purposes like
[1:18:32] that and uh we're going to light a
[1:18:34] candle and I'm going to put it in the
[1:18:36] closet uh and and go sit in the living
[1:18:40] room. That wouldn't make a lick of sense
[1:18:43] and and you knock on the door and and
[1:18:46] it'd be dark in there and I'd say,
[1:18:47] "Well, come on in. I've got a candle in
[1:18:50] the
[1:18:51] closet." And and you would think I knew
[1:18:53] I knew he was slipping and now he's
[1:18:55] really slipped. What good does a candle
[1:18:57] in a closet do? And and and this is
[1:19:00] Jesus teaching red letter. And he said,
[1:19:02] "What man would light a candle and then
[1:19:05] and then put some kind of vessel on top,
[1:19:07] hide it under a bushel?" No. Or put it
[1:19:11] under a bed. Yeah, I've got a candle lit
[1:19:13] under my bed there. Uh so the so the
[1:19:16] dust bunnies can see their way around.
[1:19:18] No, that's not what happens. You take
[1:19:21] that candle and you light it and then
[1:19:22] you go put it in a prominent place so
[1:19:25] that it can shed maximum light.
[1:19:29] And and I'm thankful. You'd be surprised
[1:19:31] what one little skinny candle can do
[1:19:33] when it's dark. Well, God's got more
[1:19:36] than a little skinny candle. He's got a
[1:19:38] search light. And brother, when he turns
[1:19:40] it on us, we can feel the intensity of
[1:19:43] his eyes.
[1:19:46] Somebody said, I that old hymn uh that
[1:19:48] we used to sing in the red book creeps
[1:19:50] me out. Well, it don't creep me out. It
[1:19:52] encourages me. the old words, the song,
[1:19:56] uh, the words to the old song said,
[1:19:57] "There's an eye watching you."
[1:20:01] Somebody said, "That creeps me out." I
[1:20:03] said, "Well, creep out or not creep out,
[1:20:05] it's a truth. God's eye is on you.
[1:20:09] And if you have nothing to hide, you
[1:20:11] don't have to worry about his eye. The
[1:20:13] same eye that sees what's wrong in you
[1:20:16] is the same eye that watches for the
[1:20:18] fowler, for the destroyer, and gives you
[1:20:21] a warning when the enemy is coming. So
[1:20:24] where would we be without the watching
[1:20:27] eye of the Lord constantly watching over
[1:20:31] us, keeping us and also bringing things
[1:20:36] to our attention so no man hides the
[1:20:39] lie. He puts it out there in a prominent
[1:20:42] place so that they which enter in may
[1:20:45] may see the light. For nothing I want
[1:20:47] you to say nothing. The next verse
[1:20:50] nothing is
[1:20:52] secret. God
[1:20:53] knows. He know you are not hiding from
[1:20:58] him. And again that only brings a
[1:21:01] anxious feeling to you if you know
[1:21:04] you're not doing what you're supposed to
[1:21:06] do.
[1:21:08] Otherwise, you joy in the reality that
[1:21:12] he's taking care. Uh his eye is on the
[1:21:16] sparrow. Praise God. Well, I'm I'm I'm
[1:21:19] glad of that, but I'm more glad that his
[1:21:22] eye is on me, watching over me,
[1:21:26] protecting me, and also searching my
[1:21:29] motive.
[1:21:31] Because uh listen, I've told you before
[1:21:33] the word in Matthew chapter 7 where
[1:21:36] Jesus says, "Judge not that you be not
[1:21:39] judged." When we look at the root of the
[1:21:42] Greek that's used there in those verses,
[1:21:45] it tells us Jesus is telling us you are
[1:21:48] not to judge one another's motives.
[1:21:51] You can't help but see what people do. I
[1:21:54] mean, you're not blind and dumb. You see
[1:21:57] how people behave and you think, "My my,
[1:21:59] they need some help. My, they need the
[1:22:01] altar. My, they need some of that prayed
[1:22:04] off of them." But but and and and we
[1:22:07] can't help that. But what we can help is
[1:22:09] when we start saying, "I know why he
[1:22:12] really did that. I know why she really
[1:22:14] did that." Then you're judging motives.
[1:22:17] And there's only one one who is uh
[1:22:20] prepared and qualified and righteous
[1:22:22] enough to jud judge another man's
[1:22:25] intention or another man's motive and
[1:22:28] that is the Lord Jesus Christ. And he
[1:22:30] does that in this hour by the power of
[1:22:33] the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost inside
[1:22:35] of us. And how many of you know that
[1:22:38] little pinch? You know the little prick
[1:22:40] of the Lord. If you don't feel that,
[1:22:43] you're you're in trouble. You're cold.
[1:22:46] You're indifferent. You You're backslid.
[1:22:49] If you no longer feel the prick of the
[1:22:52] convicting of the Lord, something is out
[1:22:54] of sort. Something is out of order. If
[1:22:58] you can watch things you shouldn't watch
[1:23:00] and repeat things you shouldn't repeat,
[1:23:03] something's out of order. If you don't
[1:23:05] feel that little prick, it's not
[1:23:07] condemnation.
[1:23:09] It's it's his love that says, "Step up.
[1:23:14] You don't have to live below your
[1:23:16] privileges. My grace is sufficient for
[1:23:19] every trial. My grace is sufficient to
[1:23:22] get you through even the thorn in the
[1:23:24] flesh. The the lingering nagging thing
[1:23:27] that is put there to keep you from
[1:23:28] getting too much bride pride. And God
[1:23:31] said, "My grace will be sufficient for
[1:23:33] you even in that moment when you
[1:23:36] recognize that what you've been asking
[1:23:38] God to take away, he ain't." I said
[1:23:41] ain't on purpose.
[1:23:43] You begin to recognize some things
[1:23:45] aren't going to be taken away. They're
[1:23:47] there to limit and to help us.
[1:23:54] Even brother Brandham said, "God puts
[1:23:56] things on people sometime to judge them,
[1:23:58] to deal with their heart, to speak to
[1:24:01] them." And he said, "Uh, far be it from
[1:24:04] me to jump up and try to pray that off
[1:24:06] of them if God has put put it on them."
[1:24:09] We need to be able to recognize that
[1:24:11] there are certain things that God has
[1:24:13] placed on our life not to cause us to
[1:24:15] feel less than or condemned, but to give
[1:24:18] us something to reach for, to pull
[1:24:20] ourselves up a little bit higher. He's
[1:24:23] not going to do it all for us. He
[1:24:24] already has.
[1:24:28] He already has. If Brother Brooks was
[1:24:31] here, we'd get him to sing, "What more
[1:24:32] can he do? He's already made the way.
[1:24:36] He's already paved the way. He's already
[1:24:40] opened up the word. He's already made
[1:24:42] available to us everything we need to
[1:24:45] overcome everything that the enemy I
[1:24:48] tell you, I still believe. I still
[1:24:50] believe in total deliverance. I still
[1:24:53] believe that we serve a God who's able
[1:24:56] to give us total deliverance from
[1:24:58] anything and everything that weighs us
[1:25:01] down. I believe it. I believe it. Now
[1:25:05] sometime we try to hide it under the bed
[1:25:07] or we try to stick it in the back of the
[1:25:09] drawer or we try to close it put it
[1:25:11] behind a locked door. But I want you to
[1:25:13] know there's nothing in secret. Verse 17
[1:25:16] that shall not be made manifest neither
[1:25:19] anything hid that shall not be known and
[1:25:23] come abroad. Verse 18 he said take heed
[1:25:26] therefore how you hear.
[1:25:31] Not just what you hear, how you hear.
[1:25:34] that that can mean so much. I've
[1:25:36] preached whole sermons on take heed how
[1:25:38] you hear. Uh you want to make sure that
[1:25:40] you hear it the way he's saying it, the
[1:25:44] way he's intending for you to hear it
[1:25:47] because otherwise it can put you in a
[1:25:49] tail spin of condemnation and
[1:25:52] hopelessness. But if you hear how if you
[1:25:56] hear it how he sends it, how he intends
[1:25:59] for you to hear it, it will only bring
[1:26:01] you to your knees. You'll humble
[1:26:03] yourself and you'll say, "Lord, I've
[1:26:05] done all I know to do. Do the best you
[1:26:07] can. I've done all I can. I've done the
[1:26:10] best I can. It doesn't seem yet to be
[1:26:12] enough. I need you, Lord. I need you."
[1:26:15] And you know, I believe he's waiting to
[1:26:16] hear that from all of us again and again
[1:26:18] and again. Can anybody squeeze out an
[1:26:21] amen? And then he gave me another place
[1:26:24] to read in Luke
[1:26:27] 12 verse 1 through3.
[1:26:30] And I want you to know, light doesn't
[1:26:31] hide things. The word exposes hypocrisy.
[1:26:36] Amen. Don't be surprised when the light
[1:26:38] reveals what's been lurking in the
[1:26:40] shadows. That's his job. He's doing it
[1:26:43] not because he hates you, despises you,
[1:26:45] wants to see you uh humiliated and fail.
[1:26:48] No, he wants to see you free from that.
[1:26:51] Totally free from that. Luke 12. In the
[1:26:56] meantime, when they were gathered
[1:26:58] together, an innumerable multitude of
[1:27:00] people, in so much that they trod upon
[1:27:02] one another, he began to say unto his
[1:27:04] disciples, first of all, beware of the
[1:27:07] leaven of the Pharisees. And then he
[1:27:10] defines the leaven of the Pharisees. And
[1:27:12] he says, which is hypocrisy.
[1:27:16] Now, let me tell you, hypocrisy is
[1:27:20] saying one thing.
[1:27:23] It'll get a little quiet here. I didn't
[1:27:25] call you
[1:27:26] one. You don't have to get quiet. No
[1:27:32] need. Pardon me. It's saying one thing
[1:27:35] and doing
[1:27:36] another. It's telling me to do one
[1:27:38] thing. I I live a certain and you live
[1:27:40] another
[1:27:42] way. It's pretending to be something
[1:27:45] that you're not. Jesus said that
[1:27:47] Pharisee spirit. Brother Brandham talked
[1:27:49] about the Pharisee
[1:27:51] spirit. That's a hard spirit.
[1:27:54] Uh because it is a religious spirit.
[1:27:57] It's a spirit that believes it truly
[1:27:59] believes that it's more righteous than
[1:28:01] anybody around. Amen. My my skirt is a
[1:28:05] little longer than anybody else's. My my
[1:28:07] this is that. I I don't I don't even
[1:28:10] have a I don't even have a Netflix
[1:28:13] registration. Well, good for you. But
[1:28:15] that doesn't make you any more
[1:28:16] sanctified than anybody else. That's not
[1:28:20] what it takes. It takes way more than
[1:28:23] that. For the bride, it is always
[1:28:26] matters of the heart.
[1:28:30] We hear brother Brandham preaching
[1:28:32] against things and if we're not careful,
[1:28:36] we will misunderstand the representation
[1:28:40] of those things. He preached against
[1:28:43] first and foremost the
[1:28:46] spirit behind something.
[1:28:50] He showed us things that we weren't
[1:28:52] hearing in the in the Pentecostal
[1:28:54] church. He showed us that there's a
[1:28:56] spirit behind just about everything.
[1:28:59] And and you've got to recognize that
[1:29:02] some things are rooted in rebellion.
[1:29:05] Although they're not what you would call
[1:29:07] rebellious natures or or rebellious
[1:29:09] behaviors, but that's where their root
[1:29:11] is found. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:29:15] uh from the scripture he talks about uh
[1:29:18] that that hour where people would be
[1:29:21] given to a strong delusion uh because
[1:29:24] they did not like to retain God in their
[1:29:27] knowledge and they're giving over to
[1:29:29] this place of having a repbate mind. Men
[1:29:32] burning in passion for men and women
[1:29:34] burning in passion for women. He is he
[1:29:37] took that and began to give us the root
[1:29:40] of the spirit of perversion. It's pride.
[1:29:45] It's pride. And if you don't believe
[1:29:46] that, all you have to do is wait till
[1:29:48] June and you'll hear it again and again
[1:29:51] and again and again and again. This is
[1:29:52] pride month because the root of
[1:29:55] perversion is pride. It so it's a heart
[1:30:00] issue. And when we discover the thing
[1:30:02] behind it, then we can have deliverance
[1:30:04] from the from the root cause, from the
[1:30:07] heart issue. And brother, when that
[1:30:10] happens, there's no more pleasure.
[1:30:12] There's no more there's no more
[1:30:14] satisfaction in in the rebellious
[1:30:17] behavior or in the perverted act.
[1:30:19] There's no more pleasure there because
[1:30:22] we realize that the root of it is gone.
[1:30:24] So what's the use? I mean, this is how
[1:30:27] it works. It has to work that way. It's
[1:30:30] not just stopping the behavior. It's
[1:30:33] dealing with the issue. Why is that
[1:30:36] there? and what can I do about it?
[1:30:39] Aren't you glad? All it takes is for God
[1:30:41] to turn the light of his church love on
[1:30:44] us and then he gives grace
[1:30:48] to do something about it. This is what
[1:30:51] he don't he he just has a real hard time
[1:30:53] with
[1:30:54] this. He's not a roller coaster God. He
[1:30:58] would rather you start slow and be
[1:30:59] steady
[1:31:02] than to run fast and get weary before
[1:31:05] you make the first curve. Right. Amen.
[1:31:09] Amen. He goes
[1:31:11] on this leaven of the Pharisees which is
[1:31:14] hypocrisy. For there's nothing covered
[1:31:16] that shall not be revealed, neither hid
[1:31:18] that shall not be known. Therefore,
[1:31:20] whatsoever you have spoken in
[1:31:23] darkness, you better hear this, shall be
[1:31:26] heard in the light, and that which you
[1:31:28] have spoken in the ear in
[1:31:31] closets shall be proclaimed upon the
[1:31:34] housetops.
[1:31:37] I'm telling you folks, hypocrisy has a
[1:31:39] countdown.
[1:31:43] The days that God lets his own people
[1:31:45] get by with that, saying one thing and
[1:31:47] doing another, those days are numbered.
[1:31:50] I'm telling you, he's going to have a
[1:31:51] victorious people. I I know that when
[1:31:55] you think about your own struggle, it
[1:31:57] seems so small and you feel so defeated,
[1:31:59] but you you need not because he's going
[1:32:01] to have a people that reign above it
[1:32:03] all. He's going to have a people that
[1:32:05] overcome every bit of that because the
[1:32:09] provision is already made for us.
[1:32:11] There's only one thing missing. We don't
[1:32:13] have enough of the revelation of who we
[1:32:15] are. That's right. Once we get it, he
[1:32:18] said it. Once you get that, I don't mean
[1:32:21] a surface revelation. But when you get a
[1:32:25] knowing of a knowing of a knowing, I
[1:32:28] mean it's all you see is who you are in
[1:32:31] him. When you get to that place, when I
[1:32:34] get to that place, there's nothing else
[1:32:37] can hold us back because we use the
[1:32:40] authority of who we are in him and we
[1:32:43] deal with things that need to be dealt
[1:32:45] with. May God give us grace not to give
[1:32:49] up until we approach that hour. Now, I
[1:32:52] know what they're preaching out there.
[1:32:53] It's all over. It's all done. It's all
[1:32:55] finished. And we're just waiting in the
[1:32:57] presence of the sun to get ripe. Well,
[1:33:00] I'll tell you something. It depends on
[1:33:02] how much water you had in you in the
[1:33:04] beginning.
[1:33:06] If you had too much water in you in the
[1:33:08] beginning, the sun will ha and the
[1:33:11] waiting in the sun will have an opposite
[1:33:13] effect. That's right. You'll rot.
[1:33:19] You've got to have the right amount of
[1:33:21] moisture in in the whatever in the
[1:33:24] pumpkin or whatever it is, sweet potato
[1:33:26] or whatever it is, so that while it's
[1:33:28] laying out ripening in the sun, it's not
[1:33:31] laying out rotting in the sun.
[1:33:35] A lot of people are rotting in the sun
[1:33:37] because they put everything behind us
[1:33:39] and they talk as though we're not even
[1:33:41] in a battle.
[1:33:43] But the last I heard him say is this is
[1:33:46] not a picnic, brother.
[1:33:48] This is a battlefield.
[1:33:51] And he even identified for us what the
[1:33:53] last battle was going to be.
[1:33:56] Where it was going to be fought. Isn't
[1:33:59] this where your battles are? Hello. All
[1:34:02] of them. All of them boil down to
[1:34:05] thoughts. All of them boil down to the
[1:34:07] battlefield of the mind. God give us
[1:34:09] grace. Let us catch a deeper glimpse of
[1:34:12] who we are because of who you are.
[1:34:14] Because of who he is, who that makes us,
[1:34:17] what he's done already in us and for us
[1:34:21] and through us. Gives us the faith to
[1:34:24] believe that there's nothing that he
[1:34:26] can't give us overcoming power over.
[1:34:28] Hypocrisy has a countdown. It's time to
[1:34:31] to to be honest with
[1:34:33] yourself and honest before the Lord and
[1:34:37] tell him, "I'm just not what I have
[1:34:40] thought I am, but I am depending on you
[1:34:44] and you called me." See, you better know
[1:34:46] he called you. You better understand
[1:34:49] that he saw you and he called you. He
[1:34:52] saw you and he chose you. And he didn't
[1:34:55] choose you because he intended to lose
[1:34:57] you. He chose you because he intends to
[1:35:00] finish you.
[1:35:02] Just a minute. Amen, brother.
[1:35:06] Because he is not just the author of our
[1:35:09] faith. But he is also the
[1:35:13] Is there anybody in this house that
[1:35:15] believes that God is a big enough God to
[1:35:17] finish what he started?
[1:35:20] Please don't live like you think he
[1:35:22] forgot you. No. No. No. No. You may have
[1:35:25] walked away from him, but he didn't walk
[1:35:27] away from you. He's waiting and ready to
[1:35:30] finish what he started.
[1:35:32] He doesn't only want you to have faith
[1:35:34] to start the race. He wants you to have
[1:35:36] completion faith, finishing faith,
[1:35:38] perfection faith. And the only way we're
[1:35:41] going to operate in the perfect faith is
[1:35:42] to operate in the perfect love. And it's
[1:35:45] coming.
[1:35:47] Now, I understand if you hear every
[1:35:49] Sunday that it's all behind us.
[1:35:52] No wonder you folks, no wonder folks get
[1:35:54] so discouraged and have to go to from
[1:35:56] meeting to meeting to meeting to meeting
[1:35:58] to meeting to meeting to meeting to hear
[1:36:00] the same preacher preach the same
[1:36:02] message.
[1:36:03] They're having to be reminded over and
[1:36:05] over and over and over again that it's
[1:36:07] all finished and done.
[1:36:11] There may be a reason for that. There
[1:36:13] may be a few things that we haven't seen
[1:36:15] in fullness yet. Amen. Right.
[1:36:21] There might have been another part of
[1:36:22] that Roman candle.
[1:36:26] There might have been some finishing
[1:36:27] faith promise for the end time.
[1:36:30] Hallelujah. Well, what's the holdup? Me?
[1:36:34] What's the hold up? You. We've got to
[1:36:36] deal with the issues of the heart. The
[1:36:39] issues of the heart are the battles of
[1:36:40] the mind. Same thing. I said the issues
[1:36:43] of the heart are the battles of the
[1:36:45] mind. And this is what we have to deal
[1:36:47] with. If you're still nurturing and
[1:36:50] nursing an offense that someone gave you
[1:36:53] yesterday,
[1:36:57] you're running late.
[1:37:00] What are you preaching this morning? The
[1:37:02] word.
[1:37:04] If somebody hurt your feelings yesterday
[1:37:06] and you have already uh uh reminded
[1:37:09] yourself of that and you stowed over it
[1:37:11] and woke up this morning thinking about
[1:37:14] it and came to church with that on your
[1:37:16] mind, what somebody said, what they did,
[1:37:19] well, how they looked,
[1:37:22] you're already defeating your own self.
[1:37:26] You are sabotaging your own victory.
[1:37:31] Well, well, do you think we ought to
[1:37:33] just be carefree? That's not what I
[1:37:35] said. But we are supposed to do this.
[1:37:38] Casting all
[1:37:42] Do you think God cares that you're hurt?
[1:37:45] He most certainly does.
[1:37:50] He may look at us sometime and think
[1:37:52] you're you're you're sure you sure are a
[1:37:54] big marshmallow.
[1:37:56] You you you you you do live a little bit
[1:37:59] like a hot house plant.
[1:38:03] He may look at us sometime like we
[1:38:05] certainly ought to be a little tougher
[1:38:06] than that by now, but he cares about our
[1:38:09] hurts and he cares about our wounds. And
[1:38:12] that's why he tells us again today,
[1:38:14] casting, are you with me? Casting all of
[1:38:18] your cares
[1:38:19] on me. He said, why?
[1:38:23] Because I want to be in your business.
[1:38:26] Yes, that's exactly what he's saying. I
[1:38:30] want to be in your business. I want to
[1:38:32] know what you're suffering with. I want
[1:38:34] to understand how you feel. You see, we
[1:38:37] do not Hebrews said we do not have a
[1:38:40] high priest that cannot be touched with
[1:38:43] the feeling of our infirmities. You see,
[1:38:45] Jesus has dealt with that woman, too.
[1:38:48] The one that hurt your feelings.
[1:38:51] He knows her. He knows that too often
[1:38:56] she talks before she thinks.
[1:39:01] God knows that
[1:39:03] man, that one in your family that keeps
[1:39:05] stepping all over you. God knows he has
[1:39:08] to deal with him, too. And he cares that
[1:39:11] you've been wounded. And he cares that
[1:39:13] you've shed a tear. And he cares that
[1:39:15] you feel like you've lost a little
[1:39:16] blood. But he tells you what to do. And
[1:39:19] it's up to you to do it. Right. Casting
[1:39:22] all your cares. I'm preaching this
[1:39:23] morning. Casting all your cares on me,
[1:39:27] for I care for you. Get rid of it.
[1:39:32] Get it over on me.
[1:39:35] It's overwhelming to you. It overpowers
[1:39:38] you. It seems at times to overcome you.
[1:39:40] I guarantee you it won't overpower him.
[1:39:43] I guarantee you it won't overwhelm him.
[1:39:46] I guarantee you he can handle it.
[1:39:50] But he wants you to get it off of you as
[1:39:52] fast as you possibly can. Today's
[1:39:55] another day.
[1:39:57] Yes, sir. You ought not to lick them
[1:39:59] twice. You licked your wounds yesterday,
[1:40:02] you ought not to lick them today. It's
[1:40:03] another day.
[1:40:06] You You must live in a bubble. Oh, no. I
[1:40:09] don't live in a bubble. I see and hear
[1:40:12] and observe and discern more than most
[1:40:14] people around me.
[1:40:16] I know a lot of things that are never
[1:40:18] told to me simply because I I've been
[1:40:20] listening to him a long long time. I can
[1:40:23] sense and feel and sometime I miss
[1:40:25] things often I have. I'm not saying I'm
[1:40:27] not trying to say I'm big somebody. I'm
[1:40:29] just telling you that I I understand uh
[1:40:33] I get I get feelings too. Right. I I see
[1:40:38] things, hear things that make me feel a
[1:40:41] little hurt, a little tender,
[1:40:44] that remind me of things I want to
[1:40:46] forget. You ever been there? But I lick
[1:40:50] my wounds yesterday.
[1:40:56] And I moved on.
[1:40:59] I've pressed on. There's a prize hanging
[1:41:02] out there at the end of this race. Amen.
[1:41:05] Yes. Yes, sir. Oh, I'm fixing. I I just
[1:41:09] think I want to bless my critics.
[1:41:12] I think I'm going to give them some.
[1:41:13] Sometimes we ought to just give our
[1:41:15] little critics nuggets to
[1:41:20] criticize. Seems like for years now,
[1:41:25] journalism
[1:41:26] has won the
[1:41:29] day. All you know is fake news.
[1:41:33] It gets faker as it goes along. They
[1:41:36] they don't tell the truth. They don't
[1:41:38] tell the truth about what's going on in
[1:41:39] Israel.
[1:41:42] Our little friend in Israel who's
[1:41:43] constantly reporting and helping us all
[1:41:46] to keep up with what's going on over
[1:41:48] there. He mentioned this. He started off
[1:41:50] with a little report. I'm sure it
[1:41:52] shocked a lot of people as they woke up
[1:41:54] this morning. A little news report that
[1:41:55] said a ballistic missile has hit uh JFK
[1:41:58] or whatever airport was. I don't
[1:42:00] remember which one he chose. a ballistic
[1:42:02] missile has and the in the United States
[1:42:04] and we're waiting to hear how the United
[1:42:06] States is going to respond because now
[1:42:08] they have crossed over into our
[1:42:10] territory and shot at one of our
[1:42:12] airports and he said, "Oh no, I meant
[1:42:15] Benurian airport." You get the point?
[1:42:19] If it was if it was JFK,
[1:42:24] they'd be scrambling fighter planes.
[1:42:28] Even our nation sleeps while Israel is
[1:42:32] losing.
[1:42:34] Come on. And it seems like they
[1:42:38] lie. You You've got these nutcases
[1:42:41] standing up on top of the college uh uh
[1:42:44] statues, you know, screaming free
[1:42:47] Palestine. They they don't even know
[1:42:48] where it is. They couldn't even put
[1:42:50] their finger on it. the gossip strip on
[1:42:53] a map
[1:42:56] and you ask them free them from what?
[1:42:58] Well, well well I well well
[1:43:04] well seems like journalism
[1:43:07] uh it molds and shapes the thoughts of a
[1:43:11] woke society.
[1:43:16] But I want you to know journalism lost.
[1:43:20] I'm going to give my critics something.
[1:43:22] Guess what? Guess what horse won the uh
[1:43:27] Kentucky Derby. No, I wasn't there. And
[1:43:29] no, I don't drink mint
[1:43:31] jeulips or wear fruit in my
[1:43:35] hat, but I have watched that a time or
[1:43:38] two through the years to see or have
[1:43:41] read who
[1:43:42] won. I have watched it. Uhhuh. God
[1:43:46] talked to me through silly things like
[1:43:48] that.
[1:43:50] And I thought as as I only learned
[1:43:54] yesterday morning who was involved.
[1:43:58] Didn't even know. Hadn't followed it.
[1:44:00] I'm not a big sports fan of any kind.
[1:44:04] But and I didn't know till yesterday
[1:44:07] afternoon when Luke or Nathan was
[1:44:09] talking and they told me that every
[1:44:11] horse, now this got me
[1:44:13] moving, that every horse that was
[1:44:16] running in the Kentucky Derby yesterday
[1:44:18] was a direct descendant of
[1:44:23] Secretariat. Every one of
[1:44:25] them. And it can be proven. And I went
[1:44:29] and did the research on one and and and
[1:44:32] found out exactly how in fact the horse
[1:44:36] that did win was related to secretariat
[1:44:39] by his mother and his
[1:44:42] father. Interesting. But far enough
[1:44:45] along that there was no clashing of the
[1:44:48] of the
[1:44:50] genetics. And you know how we have felt
[1:44:53] about secretariat when the scripture
[1:44:55] talks about I will run in the ways of
[1:44:58] thy commandments for thou hast enlarged
[1:45:02] my
[1:45:03] heart. Here comes this horse winning
[1:45:07] triple crown coming from nothing to
[1:45:09] everything. And they find out after he
[1:45:12] dies, they do an autopsy and he had a
[1:45:14] heart so grossly
[1:45:17] enlarged that the doctors stand and they
[1:45:19] say that's like a
[1:45:23] motor and nobody put that in there but a
[1:45:25] creator.
[1:45:27] It's not a genetic anomaly. It was
[1:45:30] something that that that a creator did.
[1:45:33] Why? Same reason why he gave the giraffe
[1:45:36] a crazy long neck. It pleased his heart
[1:45:39] to give that champion a champion's
[1:45:42] heart.
[1:45:44] So I said, as I learned who was running
[1:45:46] the race, I said, "Oh Lord, I'm tired of
[1:45:48] journalism winning the day and fake news
[1:45:51] and false reports swaying the attitudes
[1:45:54] of the people. I'd like to see
[1:45:56] something." And I begin to skim the
[1:45:58] line, the list. I said, "Mhm. Some of
[1:46:02] them are just foolish names, silly." Oh,
[1:46:05] there's one I can relate to.
[1:46:07] Sovereignty.
[1:46:09] I said, I found one I can relate to.
[1:46:12] Sovereignty.
[1:46:13] And indeed, sovereignty won the day. So
[1:46:17] for me, not for you, I'm not preaching
[1:46:18] this is some doctrine, but for me, I
[1:46:20] said instead of journalism ruling uh the
[1:46:24] day, sovereignty is going to rule the
[1:46:26] day. And I know the sovereign Lord. I
[1:46:28] know who he is. And I know that he has a
[1:46:32] plan. And I know that Satan can't stop
[1:46:35] the sovereign will and the sovereign
[1:46:38] mind of God from coming to pass in your
[1:46:41] life. Not just mine, your will. Your
[1:46:44] life. God has a will. God has a plan for
[1:46:48] you. And it's not to leave you in
[1:46:51] hypocrisy.
[1:46:52] It's to get you out of that mess. And
[1:46:54] the leaven of the fair. Are you there?
[1:46:57] And one more. Well, actually, there's
[1:47:00] two more. And I And I hadn't preached a
[1:47:02] sermon yet. This is the
[1:47:03] introduction. 1 Corinthians 4:5 and 6.
[1:47:06] Therefore, judge nothing before the
[1:47:08] time. Oh, this is big. I could really
[1:47:12] preach
[1:47:13] this. We we're we're impatient sometime.
[1:47:17] And we want to pull things out of God's
[1:47:19] allotted season with our grumbling or
[1:47:22] with our faith. Sometime our faith even.
[1:47:24] But but the scriptur is clear. judge
[1:47:27] nothing before the time until the Lord
[1:47:29] come, who both will bring to light the
[1:47:31] hidden things of darkness, and will make
[1:47:33] manifest the counselss of the
[1:47:36] hearts. And then shall every man have
[1:47:39] praise of
[1:47:40] God. There's things you'll never be able
[1:47:42] to sort out or figure out or judge them
[1:47:45] properly with half the story, but you
[1:47:49] leave it to God. He knows the ins, the
[1:47:51] outs, the ups, the downs.
[1:47:54] He knows everything exposed and
[1:47:55] everything hidden. He knows it all. So
[1:47:57] you leave everything in its proper time
[1:47:59] and season. He said, "And these things,
[1:48:02] brethren, I have in a figure transferred
[1:48:04] to myself and to Apollos for your
[1:48:06] sakes." And if you look at that in the
[1:48:08] original language, it says, "This is why
[1:48:10] we have set this example before you,
[1:48:13] that you might learn in us, not to think
[1:48:16] of men above that which is written, that
[1:48:19] no one of you be puffed
[1:48:22] up, for one against another."
[1:48:27] The ground is level
[1:48:30] at the foot of the cross. We have all
[1:48:33] been sinners.
[1:48:37] I notice they sometimes still sing the
[1:48:39] song around us, uh, I I am a sinner
[1:48:42] saved by grace. Brother Brandham said,
[1:48:45] "That's
[1:48:48] impossible." They sing it, but he said
[1:48:50] that's impossible to be a sinner and to
[1:48:52] be saved by grace at the same time. You
[1:48:55] was a sinner. You might say you were a
[1:48:58] sinner, but now you've been saved by
[1:49:00] grace. Does that mean you never fall?
[1:49:02] No. It doesn't mean you never fall.
[1:49:04] Doesn't mean you never fail. That's
[1:49:05] right. Doesn't mean you don't ever need
[1:49:07] his grace again. I need his grace every
[1:49:10] single day of my life. But what it means
[1:49:13] is I'm not a sinner anymore. I'm not in
[1:49:16] a place of willful sin anymore. I'm not
[1:49:18] in a place of intentional unbelief
[1:49:21] anymore. I know better. I know what the
[1:49:24] word has said and I know what I don't
[1:49:26] see. God knows how to uncover it. If
[1:49:28] you're still here
[1:49:30] about 46 minutes into this, if you're
[1:49:33] still here, say amen. Amen.
[1:49:35] God even judges what I can't see.
[1:49:40] He deals according to what he sees. And
[1:49:42] he alone reveals the motives of the
[1:49:44] heart. Now, here's the last scripture to
[1:49:47] introduce this as we go on. Hebrews
[1:49:49] 4:1-16 said, "Let us labor therefore,"
[1:49:52] I'm not going to talk about that. I love
[1:49:53] to talk about this verse, but I won't.
[1:49:55] Let us labor therefore to enter into
[1:49:58] that rest, lest any man fall after the
[1:50:02] same example of unbelief, speaking about
[1:50:06] the children of Israel. For the word of
[1:50:08] God
[1:50:09] is, you all say it, quick, powerful, and
[1:50:14] sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing
[1:50:17] even to the dividing of
[1:50:20] sunder of mind, will, and
[1:50:23] emotion and spirit, soul, and
[1:50:29] spirit. If you listen
[1:50:32] carefully to what the prophet tells
[1:50:35] us, he says
[1:50:37] that that spirit in
[1:50:41] you existed before
[1:50:45] you because that spirit I know that they
[1:50:50] do teach it a little different now but
[1:50:52] that is what he said.
[1:50:55] uh because that spirit came from
[1:50:58] God. Other times he would say that it
[1:51:01] was the soul that came from God. So we
[1:51:05] go back and see what the scripture said.
[1:51:07] And the scripture tells us that we are
[1:51:10] made up of body, soul, and spirit.
[1:51:13] There's the answer. The bi Bible tells
[1:51:16] us in the book of Genesis that that he
[1:51:18] created a body of the dirt.
[1:51:21] In fact, the name
[1:51:24] Adam is a Hebrew word for red dirt. Red
[1:51:28] earth. So from the red earth of
[1:51:31] Alabama, we got a lot of it. Amen. God
[1:51:35] made Adam and named him red dirt. He's
[1:51:37] the red dirt
[1:51:38] man. And uh then it says that God did
[1:51:42] what? He
[1:51:45] breathed ruach
[1:51:48] spirit into
[1:51:50] Adam. And when God breathed into Adam
[1:51:53] the ruach, the breath of life, the ha of
[1:51:59] God, that's the very thing that changed
[1:52:02] Abram to
[1:52:04] Abraham. It was the It is the breath of
[1:52:07] God, the high that breathed life into
[1:52:11] him. and said God breathed breath into
[1:52:14] the nostrils of Adam and he
[1:52:19] became a living soul. So you tell me
[1:52:22] which was which part was before Adam? It
[1:52:26] was the breath. It was the spirit. And
[1:52:29] brother Bram tells us that it was the
[1:52:31] spirit that existed before. And now our
[1:52:35] spirit that we were born with was
[1:52:37] different than the one Adam received
[1:52:39] because our human spirit had fallen.
[1:52:43] So we already had judgment on our spirit
[1:52:46] by the time we were born. That's what
[1:52:48] the scripture said. Because we were born
[1:52:50] in sin shapen in iniquity like David.
[1:52:54] That's what the scripture tells us. We
[1:52:56] had to have a regeneration. We had to
[1:52:58] have a resurrection in our spirit. And
[1:53:02] there's only one thing that can
[1:53:03] regenerate a fallen human spirit and
[1:53:05] that's the eternal spirit life of
[1:53:08] almighty God. The prophet tells us it's
[1:53:10] Zoe.
[1:53:12] That is life that never passes. It can
[1:53:14] never pass away. And he taught us that
[1:53:16] the only way we can live forever, the
[1:53:19] only way that we can have eternal life
[1:53:21] is to have Zoe life living inside of us.
[1:53:23] If you believe that, say amen.
[1:53:25] Otherwise, the scripture tells us the
[1:53:27] soul that sinnth
[1:53:29] it's the life of God in you that makes
[1:53:31] you an eternal soul. Praise God. The
[1:53:34] word works. We just take it right back
[1:53:37] to what the scripture said. And my does
[1:53:40] it ever unlock for us because of this
[1:53:43] message. Thank you, Lord, for sending
[1:53:45] this message. Let us labor therefore to
[1:53:48] enter. For the word of God is quick and
[1:53:50] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:53:52] sword, piercing even to the dividing of
[1:53:54] sunder. Because sometimes we don't know
[1:53:57] what is soul life and what is spirit
[1:53:59] life. Soul is mind, will and emotion. Is
[1:54:05] that coming from my mind? Is that coming
[1:54:07] from my will? Is that coming from my
[1:54:10] emotion? Or is that coming from the Holy
[1:54:12] Ghost in me? The life of God. And
[1:54:15] sometimes we we just aren't quite sure
[1:54:18] in our human condition. We're not quite
[1:54:20] sure. Is this me talking to me or or is
[1:54:24] this the Holy Ghost in my in my fallen
[1:54:26] human spirit now made alive with
[1:54:29] anastasis resurrected alive? Is that God
[1:54:32] in me talking to me? And so there's only
[1:54:35] one way to know the difference. Only one
[1:54:38] way. And here is the way. For the word
[1:54:42] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:54:46] than any two-edged sword, piercing even
[1:54:48] to the dividing of sunder of the will of
[1:54:51] the emotion, the will of the mind, the
[1:54:53] will of the soul and of the spirit. The
[1:54:56] word of God will help us discern if we
[1:54:58] go back to that word, go back to the
[1:55:00] word, go back to the Bible. It is a new
[1:55:03] book. It is not the book of our Sunday
[1:55:05] school. It's not the Bible of our Sunday
[1:55:07] school as children. It's not the Bible
[1:55:09] that we held in our hand under the
[1:55:11] devotionals of of of children in all
[1:55:14] kinds of denominational places. And I
[1:55:16] it's a it's a different Bible. Somebody
[1:55:18] said, "What in the world do you mean by
[1:55:19] that?" Because the Holy Ghost of God has
[1:55:22] unlocked it for you and I. That's what
[1:55:25] the opening of the word has done. It it
[1:55:28] it's the same King James version that we
[1:55:30] hold in our hand, but we look at it
[1:55:32] differently and we discern it
[1:55:33] differently and we understand it
[1:55:35] differently because God has sent a
[1:55:37] message to tie together all the loose
[1:55:40] ends.
[1:55:43] So really we can see the only way to
[1:55:45] know what's of the will, the human will,
[1:55:48] what's of the human emotion and what is
[1:55:50] of spirit truth is let that word of God
[1:55:53] come and settle the issue.
[1:55:57] And that means if you can't find it in
[1:55:59] the book, if you can't find it in the
[1:56:02] Bible, you might just leave it where it
[1:56:04] is on the
[1:56:05] shelf until you can find it in the word.
[1:56:09] It doesn't mean it's not there. It means
[1:56:12] you've not yet been able to place it
[1:56:13] there. You've not been able to find
[1:56:15] exactly where that fits the word. Uh uh
[1:56:18] but you you're not going to be able to
[1:56:20] do that on a once a week kind of thing
[1:56:22] with him. It's going to have to be a
[1:56:24] daily learning and discerning this word.
[1:56:28] No wonder he told us read our Bible
[1:56:29] every day. I want to say that again
[1:56:32] before you go to start going to sleep in
[1:56:34] here. Uh I want to say that again. He
[1:56:36] told us that we should read our Bible
[1:56:38] every day. Is that so we're robots? No.
[1:56:43] It's so that we can be overcoming
[1:56:45] Christians.
[1:56:47] This word of God is a discerner like
[1:56:49] that and searches out some pretty deep
[1:56:52] things in us. I'm so thankful. Neither
[1:56:54] is there any creature that is not
[1:56:56] manifest in his sight. But all things
[1:56:58] are naked and open under the eyes of him
[1:57:01] with whom we have to do. 1253. I'm all
[1:57:04] right.
[1:57:06] Seeing then that we have a
[1:57:11] great high priest. Yes. Praise God.
[1:57:17] Praise God. That is passed into the
[1:57:22] heavens.
[1:57:24] Jesus the son of God. Let us hold
[1:57:28] fast our profession. He said the prophet
[1:57:32] told us profession and confession same
[1:57:35] thing. What we profess is what we
[1:57:38] confess. And we better be careful what
[1:57:41] we confess because that's what God is
[1:57:44] obligated to.
[1:57:47] That means we we better be careful what
[1:57:49] we say because God has obligated
[1:57:51] himself to what we say.
[1:57:55] That's what he taught us. You've heard
[1:57:57] the sermons, haven't you? He said that's
[1:57:59] what goes out. That's what that's what
[1:58:01] rings in the heavens. Now, that is part
[1:58:04] of learning who you are. When you start
[1:58:06] getting a deeper revelation of who you
[1:58:08] are, you're going to be a little more
[1:58:09] careful of what comes out of your big
[1:58:10] old mouth.
[1:58:13] Cuz you understand there's a high priest
[1:58:14] up there serving you.
[1:58:17] Praise
[1:58:18] God. He serves us. He promised he would.
[1:58:23] We have not. He goes on, "Let us hold
[1:58:25] fast our profession. For we have not an
[1:58:28] high priest which cannot be touched with
[1:58:30] the feeling of our infirmities, but
[1:58:31] within all points." Let's say all
[1:58:33] points. All points. All points tempted
[1:58:36] like as we are.
[1:58:39] Brother Brandham said that's everything.
[1:58:41] Alcohol, everything. He named them. Name
[1:58:43] some things. He told him, don't you
[1:58:45] think that's not all? It's all all means
[1:58:47] all here. He was tempted yet without
[1:58:49] sin. If he had not been tempted by
[1:58:51] everything that could possibly tempt
[1:58:53] you, he could not have been the high
[1:58:55] priest that God intended for him to be.
[1:58:58] So, he had to be tempted in all manner
[1:59:00] yet without sin. And because of
[1:59:03] that, because he was tempted and
[1:59:07] overcame without sin, because of that,
[1:59:12] let us
[1:59:16] therefore, it's one on top of the other.
[1:59:19] Let us therefore come how?
[1:59:23] Embarrassed,
[1:59:24] ashamed. We would we would come
[1:59:27] embarrassed if we came with our own
[1:59:29] merits. if all we had to present was us
[1:59:32] in our fallen nature. But that's not
[1:59:35] what we come with. We come boldly unto
[1:59:38] the throne of grace with the lamb, with
[1:59:41] the blood of the lamb, with the
[1:59:43] sacrifice, with the offering of the
[1:59:45] lamb. It's not the It's not the
[1:59:47] worshipper that is received or rejected.
[1:59:50] It's the offering that's received or
[1:59:52] rejected. So if you come with the works
[1:59:54] of your flesh, if you come with a
[1:59:56] product of your loins like Abraham tried
[1:59:59] to do when he was helping God out,
[2:00:03] God made him a promise. And Abraham or
[2:00:07] Yes. had an idea.
[2:00:10] It was an idea, not a
[2:00:13] revelation. It wasn't from the same God
[2:00:15] who talked to him. This was from his own
[2:00:18] mind, will, and emotion. And it sounds
[2:00:20] just like a man. He said, "Well, I think
[2:00:23] I've got a way to figure this out." He
[2:00:25] said, "I'll just go in unto my maid
[2:00:27] here, your maid, Hagar, and she will
[2:00:30] have a son, and God will then re receive
[2:00:33] that son, and he will be the heir of the
[2:00:35] promise. He'll be the one that receives
[2:00:37] the
[2:00:38] inheritance." Sarah was all for it until
[2:00:41] she wasn't.
[2:00:45] All for it until she wasn't. Oh, I could
[2:00:48] say some
[2:00:50] things, but I
[2:00:53] understand because all of a sudden the
[2:00:55] step got
[2:00:58] fixed. You know the step that Sarah had
[2:01:01] been asking Abraham to fix for months
[2:01:04] and Abraham, I'll get to it, honey. I'll
[2:01:06] get to it. I'll get to it, sweetheart.
[2:01:07] I'll get to it next week. Next week.
[2:01:08] Next time I have a day off. I'll get to
[2:01:10] it. I'll get to it. I'll get to it.
[2:01:12] Well, all of a sudden when Hagar started
[2:01:14] swelling up and she was going to have to
[2:01:16] go up and in and out of that place,
[2:01:17] Abraham got the
[2:01:19] hammer. Aren't you adding to the word?
[2:01:22] Well, I don't mean to be. I'm giving you
[2:01:24] food for thought. And now all of a
[2:01:26] sudden, the step gets
[2:01:28] fixed. And you know those favorite
[2:01:30] things, those favorite spices that we
[2:01:32] like on our on our goat? Well, we've
[2:01:34] been out of them for a while. and Sarah
[2:01:36] had been saying to Abraham, "Sometime
[2:01:37] when those merchants come through here,
[2:01:39] wish you trade a little bit of this we
[2:01:41] don't need and get us some of that
[2:01:43] beautiful saffron that comes out of the
[2:01:45] orient." And Abraham said, "Well, I'll
[2:01:47] do just that." And one merchant came by
[2:01:48] and the next merchant came by and the
[2:01:50] next merchant came by and Sarah never
[2:01:52] even heard. Abraham asked if they had
[2:01:54] this beautiful saffron. But all of a
[2:01:57] sudden, one day they're all sitting
[2:01:59] around the fire and Hagar says, "You
[2:02:01] know, I've just been having a taste.
[2:02:03] I've been having a craving for that
[2:02:05] flavor of that beautiful saffron that we
[2:02:08] had one time that came to us from the
[2:02:10] Orient. I I wished I could. And the next
[2:02:12] thing you know, the next merchant comes
[2:02:14] by and Abraham's standing at the road
[2:02:16] waving him down, buying the
[2:02:18] saffron because he saw something
[2:02:22] growing. It was his seed. It was a
[2:02:25] product of his mind, his idea and his
[2:02:29] loins. And you see be but let me tell
[2:02:31] you something. And there came a time
[2:02:32] that that child was born. Sarah got
[2:02:35] pretty miffed. She went along with it.
[2:02:38] Now, she didn't go along with it. The
[2:02:40] baby's born. Everything's okay until
[2:02:42] Isaac is being celebrated one
[2:02:45] day. And there stands Hagar and Ishmael
[2:02:49] and there's a little mocking going on.
[2:02:52] Brother, that's when Sarah went into
[2:02:54] mama bear mode. She come flying down
[2:02:58] through there and she said, "Let me tell
[2:02:59] you something right now. That woman is
[2:03:02] not going to mock.
[2:03:05] I'm not going to let her stand in the
[2:03:06] back of the crowd with that boy of hers
[2:03:09] and yours and mock. You're going to have
[2:03:13] to drive her away. And that's exactly
[2:03:14] what Abraham had to do. And I'm telling
[2:03:16] you something, it was very easy for
[2:03:18] Sarah to say, "Let him go." But it was
[2:03:21] very hard for Abraham to say, "Let him
[2:03:22] go." Anybody following me? So, let me
[2:03:25] tell you something. And what Abraham did
[2:03:27] by taking his own son up on that
[2:03:29] mountain, he'd already won a victory in
[2:03:32] the other situation. Now he's going, it
[2:03:34] was big. What God was requiring of him
[2:03:37] was big. When your when your mistakes
[2:03:41] start raising up to mock your miracles,
[2:03:45] right? That's when you finally decide.
[2:03:48] Why didn't you decide to do something
[2:03:50] about it until now?
[2:03:54] because it seemed like a good idea when
[2:03:56] you're thinking with your head and with
[2:03:59] other
[2:04:00] things. But when you begin to see the
[2:04:03] reality of the mocking and the carrying
[2:04:05] on and the strife that goes on between
[2:04:07] the flesh and the spirit, then you start
[2:04:09] all of a sudden deciding, I've got to
[2:04:11] deal with it. When your mistakes start
[2:04:13] mocking your miracles, that's when you
[2:04:15] realize, I have got to do something
[2:04:17] about my problem. And that's what I'm
[2:04:18] preaching on today. And it doesn't
[2:04:21] matter to me whether it's something
[2:04:23] connected to lust or whether it's
[2:04:25] connect something connected to jealousy
[2:04:27] or whether it's something connected to
[2:04:28] bitterness or whether it's something
[2:04:30] connected to this one thing or the
[2:04:32] other. I can almost show you through the
[2:04:34] scripture that every bit of it goes back
[2:04:36] to the root of offense.
[2:04:41] You let something or somebody offend
[2:04:45] you and you nursed it longer than we
[2:04:48] should have.
[2:04:50] and it began to grow into something
[2:04:52] else. And the only way we're going to
[2:04:54] get total victory of everything else
[2:04:56] that's haunting us is to go back to the
[2:04:59] root of the problem and let Jesus do
[2:05:02] something about it.
[2:05:05] Well, I won't feel good enough. I won't
[2:05:06] feel free from that until I see the
[2:05:09] person who did me wrong suffering. Well,
[2:05:12] brother, let me tell you
[2:05:14] something. That'll never work.
[2:05:18] The Bible said, "Vengeance is mine."
[2:05:22] When we start looking at one another and
[2:05:24] start thinking, "I wished he'd get." I
[2:05:26] mean, believers do it. Woo! I've heard
[2:05:28] it.
[2:05:30] Blood brothers do it. Blood sisters can
[2:05:32] do it. Church family can do it to one
[2:05:35] another. I'll be glad when I finally see
[2:05:37] him beginning to get what he deserves
[2:05:40] for what he did. Something's bad wrong.
[2:05:43] We ought to be pulling for one another
[2:05:45] now. Amen. Anybody here?
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:50] We ought to be pulling for one another,
[2:05:52] not against one another.
[2:05:55] That word of God is a discerner of the
[2:05:57] thoughts and intents of the heart. Let
[2:05:59] me tell you, it cuts deeper than what we
[2:06:00] want to admit.
[2:06:02] And we are laid open before a merciful
[2:06:05] high priest in this hour. All things are
[2:06:07] naked and open under the eyes of him
[2:06:09] with whom we have to do. The same light
[2:06:12] that exposes sin. It's the same light
[2:06:15] that invites us to the throne of grace.
[2:06:18] The difference is when you recognize you
[2:06:21] are his.
[2:06:23] When you know who you belong to. Now let
[2:06:26] me have a few more minutes.
[2:06:29] Now all of that being said, this was the
[2:06:31] answer. That was the answer. Lord, why
[2:06:34] are you taking us back to to this series
[2:06:37] on on the heart and on the spirit of
[2:06:40] offense? And he gave me every one of
[2:06:42] those scriptures. And and that was the
[2:06:44] reason why because it is his good
[2:06:47] pleasure to deal with every part of who
[2:06:51] we are so that he has preeminence
[2:06:56] for our tomorrow.
[2:06:58] I I want that. I told you last Sunday I
[2:07:02] mean it. I want to fall in love. I want
[2:07:05] to spend every day of the rest of my
[2:07:07] life falling in love with Jesus
[2:07:11] more and more and more. I want to love
[2:07:14] him until I love him more than anything
[2:07:16] else or anybody else,
[2:07:22] any hobby, any habit, any family,
[2:07:25] I want to love him until I love him more
[2:07:28] than anything else. And in order to do
[2:07:31] that, I've got to make room for him in
[2:07:33] my own heart. And I'm going to have to
[2:07:35] forgive. I'm going to have to forgive
[2:07:36] family
[2:07:37] members. We are We're going to have to
[2:07:40] forgive one another living in the same
[2:07:42] house. We're going to have to forgive
[2:07:43] church folks and church hurts and
[2:07:47] wounds because there's a spell that's
[2:07:49] got a hold of people in this hour. And I
[2:07:52] I uh one month ago I I talked to you
[2:07:55] about it. Galatians 3:1. Look at it with
[2:07:57] me just quickly. I I'll take a few more
[2:08:00] minutes.
[2:08:01] He said, 'Oh foolish
[2:08:03] Galatians, who hath bewitched you that
[2:08:07] ye should not obey the truth before
[2:08:09] whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
[2:08:11] evidently set forth crucified among you.
[2:08:15] We look at that word bewitched. It means
[2:08:18] exactly what you think it would. It it
[2:08:20] means under the influence. Uh the word
[2:08:22] in the Greek is baso and it means to
[2:08:25] bring evil on one by feigning praise or
[2:08:30] an evil eye to charm to
[2:08:34] bewitch. It means to use like curious
[2:08:40] arts. The word translated here bewitch
[2:08:43] signifies affecting the eyes or spoiling
[2:08:46] the sight. So the apostle is saying to
[2:08:50] the church at Galatia, somebody has
[2:08:53] rendered you blind.
[2:08:55] You have fallen under the spell of not
[2:08:59] being able to discern properly your own
[2:09:02] situation. It is as though you have
[2:09:05] fallen under the spell of a witch. This
[2:09:08] is what Paul is saying. It's big. It's
[2:09:11] pretty serious. He said, "So that men
[2:09:15] cannot discern an obvious object in a
[2:09:18] due
[2:09:20] position." I I stand
[2:09:23] amazed. I do when I see sometimes what
[2:09:28] parents give their children to play
[2:09:31] with. Right?
[2:09:35] I look at them sometime and I think I I
[2:09:37] I once wrestled something that looked
[2:09:40] like that in the spirit all night
[2:09:44] long. You think I'm
[2:09:46] crazy? And there Hollywood has hatched
[2:09:50] it. Yeah. And kids want to watch it and
[2:09:53] they want to hold it and they want to
[2:09:55] play it. I wonder sometime if we are not
[2:09:58] a bit bewitched.
[2:10:00] I wonder if something hasn't affected
[2:10:02] our sight sometime. We don't want to be
[2:10:05] paranoid and we don't want to be
[2:10:07] somebody that looks for a demon under
[2:10:09] every rock, but we want to be a a sharp
[2:10:13] people because the word of God is sharp,
[2:10:17] quick, powerful, and we want to be able
[2:10:19] to recognize. Now, was I a little over
[2:10:23] the top?
[2:10:25] Probably. I I probably was.
[2:10:29] Benjamin played us a clip one time of a
[2:10:32] Christian
[2:10:33] comedian who was telling about all the
[2:10:35] words that he wasn't allowed to say as a
[2:10:37] kid. And my kids were laughing and they
[2:10:40] were having the best time because
[2:10:42] everything that he was told not to say,
[2:10:44] they weren't allowed to
[2:10:46] say. There's just certain things that
[2:10:50] once you understand what they mean and
[2:10:52] what they're connected to, you would
[2:10:54] want to separate yourself from. I would
[2:10:59] think. I would think so. And so, was I a
[2:11:03] little over the top? I probably was. Our
[2:11:05] girls, when they were little, they
[2:11:06] didn't play with Barbie
[2:11:09] dolls. There was a reason for it. I did
[2:11:13] not want them to think that
[2:11:15] Barbie is the model
[2:11:19] for the average American woman.
[2:11:24] Because those Barbie days last about 18
[2:11:27] months, 24 months. A woman will rise to
[2:11:32] the top of the fashion industry and the
[2:11:34] modeling industry and she's the perfect
[2:11:36] tan or the perfect seven or whatever.
[2:11:38] They they they kind of fluctuate with
[2:11:40] the numbers and so forth. And the world
[2:11:42] looks at them and all little girls who
[2:11:44] have a little pudgy because they're they
[2:11:46] haven't uh hit hit enough through
[2:11:49] puberty or or haven't learned to to deal
[2:11:52] with those kinds of things in a in a
[2:11:53] maybe better diet or a little more
[2:11:55] exercise. They look and they see that
[2:11:57] and they think I'll never be I'll never
[2:11:59] be enough. I'll never measure up. I'll
[2:12:01] never be able to to look like that or to
[2:12:04] be be like that. And we can say to them
[2:12:06] all day long, why would you want to? And
[2:12:08] it doesn't solve the problem if we keep
[2:12:10] setting those things up before them as
[2:12:13] an example
[2:12:15] of what average women should be. Hello.
[2:12:20] And finally, they've got they've got a
[2:12:22] Barbie with darker skin and they've got
[2:12:24] a an Asian Barbie and they've got a
[2:12:26] Barbie in a wheelchair.
[2:12:29] Finally, why don't you make a Barbie
[2:12:31] that's had four babies?
[2:12:37] See, so I might have been a little over
[2:12:40] the top, but I wonder sometime what has
[2:12:43] affected people's spiritual eyesight
[2:12:46] that they can't see the spirit
[2:12:50] behind certain things.
[2:12:54] And we won't even talk about Disney.
[2:13:04] But they're finding out
[2:13:06] there's certain things that don't need
[2:13:08] to be rewritten and made modern and made
[2:13:10] woke. They just
[2:13:13] fail. Certain things just leave them as
[2:13:15] they are. Oh my. Who hath seduced you?
[2:13:19] Who hath so corrupted your understanding
[2:13:22] that your actions are as unaccountable
[2:13:24] as the effects of witchcraft?
[2:13:27] The word rendered hath been evidently
[2:13:30] set be set forth properly to write
[2:13:33] before and then to announce beforehand
[2:13:36] in writing or to announce by posting up
[2:13:38] on a tablet. The apostle Paul is not
[2:13:41] saying that the church in Galatia was
[2:13:44] visited by witches. He's saying that
[2:13:46] they have become bewitched. They have
[2:13:49] allowed something to cloud their
[2:13:51] perception, their discernment. They've
[2:13:54] disrupted their obedience. It has
[2:13:56] obscured their vision of the cross. This
[2:13:59] is not fantasy. It's witchcraft through
[2:14:02] offense,
[2:14:04] pride. Can you read the rest?
[2:14:07] And soish manipulation. I'm not going to
[2:14:11] let you leave here without knowing a
[2:14:14] little of what that looks
[2:14:15] like. In 1st Samuel chapter 15 verse 23,
[2:14:19] for rebellion is as the sin of
[2:14:23] witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[2:14:25] iniquity and idolatry.
[2:14:28] It's all right to be steadfast.
[2:14:33] But there's a difference in being
[2:14:35] steadfast and obstinate.
[2:14:37] There's a difference in being steadfast
[2:14:39] and argumentative.
[2:14:41] There's a difference in being steadfast
[2:14:42] and always having to exercise and usurp
[2:14:46] your authority. Flaunt it.
[2:14:50] I'm deeply concerned about a
[2:14:52] relationship between a man and his wife
[2:14:55] if he has to constantly remind her I'm
[2:14:58] the
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:05] man. Why are you Why are you going back
[2:15:08] into it? because he says it matters. He
[2:15:11] said, "I'm going to turn some light on
[2:15:14] things and I'm doing that so that those
[2:15:18] things can be extracted from our heart
[2:15:21] and we can get the the the deliverance,
[2:15:25] the total deliverance that the message
[2:15:27] is promised through the scripture over
[2:15:29] everything. I want it.
[2:15:37] I don't just want it for
[2:15:40] myself. I want it for
[2:15:42] you. I woke up this morning with some of
[2:15:45] you my
[2:15:47] mind. I want your deliverance. I want
[2:15:50] your victory. I want to see you
[2:15:54] above your struggle.
[2:15:59] In order to do that, we've got to we've
[2:16:01] got to see some things extracted.
[2:16:04] We can't extract what we don't see, what
[2:16:07] we don't
[2:16:07] recognize. We can't perform ask God to
[2:16:10] come and perform surgery if we don't
[2:16:12] know what to what needs to be taken. Of
[2:16:15] course, we say, "Lord, take out of me,
[2:16:17] whatever." But what I find in that
[2:16:18] prayer is if if he takes something out
[2:16:21] of us and we don't even know what it is,
[2:16:23] how do we know when it creeps back in?
[2:16:26] So God, I don't want you just to help me
[2:16:28] get out get it out of me. I want you to
[2:16:30] show me where it is, where it started,
[2:16:33] and how I can make sure that I never let
[2:16:35] that thing live in me again.
[2:16:38] Rebellion doesn't always shout
[2:16:40] rebellion. If a man has to keep saying
[2:16:42] to his wives, I'm the man. I'm the
[2:16:46] husband.
[2:16:52] There's been a lack of communication
[2:16:54] already
[2:16:58] because he was
[2:16:59] there, she was there, they heard, they
[2:17:02] heard what the preacher
[2:17:04] said. They've read what the scripture
[2:17:07] said. There's something wrong with
[2:17:09] somebody who has to keep reminding their
[2:17:11] companion. A wife should never have to
[2:17:14] say to a husband, "Hey, you're the
[2:17:15] husband. You're the head of the house.
[2:17:17] Why don't you head the house?
[2:17:24] Somebody help me.
[2:17:28] We ought to know and do what you're
[2:17:30] going to do when the children raise up
[2:17:32] and say, "I'm I'm ready for you to be my
[2:17:33] mama now. Daddy, I'm ready for you to be
[2:17:36] a daddy now."
[2:17:39] Well, that'd be rough. That'd be hard to
[2:17:41] swallow. Come on. That'd be really
[2:17:45] something to have to deal with. So, we
[2:17:47] find that offended hearts
[2:17:50] are fertile ground for this kind of
[2:17:53] witchcraft to operate in us. And here's
[2:17:56] the three here three different ways.
[2:17:59] Manipulation, which is emotional
[2:18:01] control, domination, which is relational
[2:18:04] control, and intimidation, which is
[2:18:07] spiritual control. And all of these
[2:18:09] things are rooted in offense. These are
[2:18:11] the three pillars of witchcraft, how it
[2:18:14] operates. This is not about black magic.
[2:18:16] This is not about Ouija boards. This is
[2:18:18] not about spells. This is about the
[2:18:21] other kind of witchcraft that the Bible
[2:18:23] talks about, the bewitching kind. The
[2:18:25] kind that affects our discernment, the
[2:18:27] kind that affects our spiritual
[2:18:29] eyesight. And these things show up not
[2:18:32] just in the occult, but in the church,
[2:18:34] in homes, in marriages, and in pullpits.
[2:18:39] And we have to be aware of it. I want
[2:18:42] you to show them here. We're we're
[2:18:44] nearly done for today. I want you to
[2:18:46] show them the the little chart that we
[2:18:48] ended with one month ago. The demonic
[2:18:51] progression. I want you to see how
[2:18:53] things operate. Look, we could never
[2:18:56] ever yield to
[2:18:59] offense if we didn't already have a
[2:19:03] measure of pride operating in us. Now, I
[2:19:07] know that is offensive. I know that
[2:19:10] there's something in me, something in
[2:19:12] you that wants to say,
[2:19:15] "Hey, I I'm the one
[2:19:17] offended." And now you're blaming me
[2:19:20] because I'm the one offended.
[2:19:23] But the reality is, in order for you to
[2:19:27] have an offense, to take on an
[2:19:31] offense, you have to think of yourself
[2:19:35] more highly
[2:19:37] than you should
[2:19:40] because Jesus said you're going to see
[2:19:43] offense.
[2:19:45] Jesus promised it. Red letter. Don't you
[2:19:48] think that you're going to escape
[2:19:49] offense? Offense is going to come. He
[2:19:52] said, Right? Just don't be the one who
[2:19:55] brings it. He said it would be better, a
[2:19:58] paraphrase, but he said be better then
[2:20:00] for a millstone to be tied about your
[2:20:02] neck and you cast into the depths of the
[2:20:04] sea than to hinder one of my little
[2:20:05] ones. He said never offense is coming,
[2:20:09] but don't you be the one doing the
[2:20:11] offending.
[2:20:13] You understand? So you start thinking,
[2:20:15] you know, well, I mean, I deserve better
[2:20:17] treatment than that. I I I mean, I do. I
[2:20:19] I I
[2:20:20] I do. I I ought not to be talked to that
[2:20:23] way. I ought not to be treated that way.
[2:20:26] There's nothing wrong with the truth of
[2:20:28] that statement. You shouldn't have to be
[2:20:30] mistreated. But the reality is it's
[2:20:34] life. Oh, don't get too quiet. It's just
[2:20:38] life. Iron sharpeneth iron. You put hot,
[2:20:43] hungry,
[2:20:45] tired, weary
[2:20:47] people in
[2:20:50] life
[2:20:51] together. It don't matter how much
[2:20:53] square footage they have in the
[2:20:57] house. You You're going to offend.
[2:20:59] You're going to say the wrong thing.
[2:21:00] You're going to say something you wish
[2:21:02] you hadn't said. We ought to be more and
[2:21:04] more careful about it. But it's going to
[2:21:07] happen. And it's only pride that causes
[2:21:11] us to carry over
[2:21:18] tomorrow what somebody said to
[2:21:21] us or how they treated us. Are you
[2:21:25] here
[2:21:27] today? It's that little bit of pride.
[2:21:29] It's self-preservation.
[2:21:32] I don't want you to think that it's
[2:21:34] evil. But I want you to understand that
[2:21:37] if you if you didn't have that little
[2:21:39] bit of I've been wronged and I and I
[2:21:42] ought not to be wronged, it's the same
[2:21:44] kind of spirit that tells you you
[2:21:46] deserve the whole chocolate cake because
[2:21:49] you've been through some troubles this
[2:21:51] week.
[2:21:55] It's the same devil that told me this
[2:21:57] week, I I for all the trouble I've been
[2:22:00] through, I ought to eat the whole
[2:22:01] strawberry cobbler. Nobody else likes it
[2:22:03] in my house
[2:22:04] anyway. But I couldn't do such a thing.
[2:22:08] That's self sabotage.
[2:22:12] Look, I did. I'll be honest with you.
[2:22:14] I'm I'm showing you my little pride. I
[2:22:17] thought this has been a week.
[2:22:21] Can't everybody just simmer down just a
[2:22:24] little? Can't you just simmer just a
[2:22:27] tad? And and you know, but it's our
[2:22:30] pride that makes us feel that way. And
[2:22:33] when we have that residual pride, then
[2:22:37] we have probably experienced along the
[2:22:41] way rejection.
[2:22:43] Is there anybody here? Don't raise your
[2:22:45] hand. Is there anybody here that's never
[2:22:46] felt the sting of rejection?
[2:22:50] It started in grammar school for some of
[2:22:53] us. Do you love me? Check yes or
[2:22:59] no. And I'm I'm hurrying. I'm hurrying.
[2:23:03] And some little old dark darkheaded
[2:23:06] doeyed girl said, "No."
[2:23:15] I don't know how I did it, but I had a
[2:23:17] girlfriend in kindergarten, so I didn't
[2:23:19] get rejected in
[2:23:21] kindergarten. Her name was
[2:23:26] Gracie. It didn't go very far. She
[2:23:29] forgot me by the first
[2:23:32] grade. But everybody has experienced
[2:23:35] some rejection. It hurts. It stings.
[2:23:39] We don't like it. How many of you know,
[2:23:41] don't raise your hand. We don't like it.
[2:23:46] Let let me show you how it manifests
[2:23:47] that we don't like rejection. You let
[2:23:50] somebody come along and ignore the fact
[2:23:53] that you're standing in the
[2:23:55] line and step ahead of
[2:23:58] you without saying, "Are you in the
[2:24:01] line?" And you start
[2:24:06] coughing,
[2:24:11] sneezing, huffing. Let me let me show
[2:24:13] you
[2:24:14] [Music]
[2:24:17] you and talking to your young. I guess
[2:24:20] we're
[2:24:24] invisible. And the little child is said,
[2:24:27] "Sh, mama,
[2:24:29] [Music]
[2:24:30] please, daddy, please." And you're
[2:24:33] saying, "I I guess I guess it just ain't
[2:24:35] our
[2:24:36] day. Don't matter how long we've been
[2:24:38] standing here." Look folks, that is you
[2:24:41] are registering the fact that you have
[2:24:44] dealt with rejection. You didn't quite
[2:24:47] get over it
[2:24:50] and now you take everything as a
[2:24:53] personal attack.
[2:24:56] This is how we do in life. I'm not
[2:24:58] throwing this on you. This is us. This
[2:25:02] is how our mind, our brain, our emotions
[2:25:05] process life.
[2:25:10] And th this is proof in the pudding
[2:25:12] right
[2:25:13] there. Maybe they didn't see you. Maybe
[2:25:17] they didn't know where the line
[2:25:19] formed. It's
[2:25:22] possible. And and and did you did you
[2:25:25] think to notice that you have bought out
[2:25:28] the
[2:25:29] store? You've got two buggies full.
[2:25:35] You look like the dugger mama going
[2:25:37] through
[2:25:38] Walmart holding on to two carts and that
[2:25:42] one that stepped in front of you has got
[2:25:44] one gallon of blue
[2:25:47] bell. You ought to give anybody that
[2:25:49] likes blue bell a
[2:25:55] pass. But there's something.
[2:26:01] Don't go to
[2:26:04] Israel. You You won't survive one day in
[2:26:07] the real world. If you're on a tour, you
[2:26:09] might get by, but you'll never survive
[2:26:11] one day in the real world. When we were
[2:26:13] conducting business and things like that
[2:26:14] there, oh my goodness, they'll put their
[2:26:17] sandals in the in the line, take their
[2:26:19] shoes off their stinky feet and put
[2:26:21] their sandals in the line and go sit
[2:26:23] down. You better not step over that
[2:26:25] sandal. That sandal represents a
[2:26:30] person. You've not been to town unless
[2:26:33] you have been
[2:26:36] elbowed, bumped,
[2:26:38] knocked, spit
[2:26:41] on. They get really upset. Why? Because
[2:26:48] rejection is all they've ever known.
[2:26:52] It's not all been dealt with. That's why
[2:26:55] so much of the Israeli society is
[2:26:57] secular. It's because they struggle with
[2:26:59] all of those emotions and it's holding
[2:27:02] them back from accepting the only thing
[2:27:04] that can offer them
[2:27:06] hope. You and I have experienced
[2:27:09] measures of rejection from parents from
[2:27:11] generations before us on our job, our
[2:27:14] school
[2:27:16] life, our work
[2:27:18] life. And now we see everything as a
[2:27:21] personal assault and we catch offense
[2:27:26] like fly
[2:27:28] paper. And the problem with someone
[2:27:30] dealing with the residual of pride a
[2:27:34] spirit of rejection and now you add to
[2:27:37] that
[2:27:38] offense. The problem with that is then
[2:27:41] we become the magnet
[2:27:45] and we draw it. We act
[2:27:49] so can I use a virgin? Can I say
[2:27:54] quir? We act so
[2:28:00] quir, so strange, so odd, so
[2:28:05] awkward. We we we we walk in a room and
[2:28:09] we just know that somebody's going to
[2:28:10] reject
[2:28:11] us. So we walk in like we
[2:28:15] are need a straight
[2:28:18] jacket and so everybody in the room
[2:28:20] pulls back.
[2:28:23] Oh my I don't know what to
[2:28:26] say. Sometimes the devil tells you they
[2:28:29] don't like you, they don't love you,
[2:28:30] they hate you. And and if you could
[2:28:32] that's what the devil is saying to you.
[2:28:34] if you could hear what the devil is
[2:28:35] saying to
[2:28:37] them. If you say anything, you're going
[2:28:39] to say the wrong thing cuz you know how
[2:28:41] easily offended she is. So you better be
[2:28:43] careful what you say.
[2:28:46] So he works on both ends of the line.
[2:28:50] And and and here's the reality. You know
[2:28:51] how to fix that? We awkward ones ought
[2:28:55] to walk into a room and hug somebody.
[2:28:58] How y'all doing?
[2:29:02] It it can shift the atmosphere of
[2:29:05] awkwardness
[2:29:08] just by making up your mind. You know,
[2:29:10] it don't really matter to me if
[2:29:11] everybody here in this affair wants me
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:17] here. I I was
[2:29:21] invited. Let's just use a little
[2:29:23] birthday party or something like
[2:29:27] that. Uh, you
[2:29:30] know, I I somebody might look around
[2:29:33] say, "What in the world are you doing
[2:29:34] here?" I mean, this don't happen. If it
[2:29:36] if it if it did, well, I would be quick
[2:29:39] to tell
[2:29:41] them. Why are you
[2:29:43] here? I was invited. Were you invited?
[2:29:46] Well, then that's why we're
[2:29:49] here. Settled it.
[2:29:52] Or I I might just say, you know, it's
[2:29:55] like the Lord. He created things for his
[2:29:56] pleasure. I'm here cuz I thought I might
[2:29:59] want to be and I just said I'm
[2:30:03] coming. Then there's no there's no
[2:30:06] offense. He didn't mean that. She didn't
[2:30:08] mean that. It didn't come out right.
[2:30:14] That's not what they meant. I've talked
[2:30:15] to to you about people missing church
[2:30:17] and you meeting them at the door. Where
[2:30:20] have you
[2:30:22] been? You think that makes anybody want
[2:30:24] to be at church?
[2:30:27] Where have you? I've been wondering
[2:30:29] where you
[2:30:30] was. I'm almost
[2:30:33] done. About time you showed up. That's
[2:30:37] how Brother Tmaine I love him. God rest
[2:30:40] his weary soul. That's how he met people
[2:30:42] at the front
[2:30:45] door. You ought to be a little bit like
[2:30:47] my mother. She'd say, "Ken, if you say
[2:30:49] that to me again, I'm going to slap you
[2:30:50] right here in the
[2:30:53] church. Back up.
[2:30:56] I don't have to ask you for permission
[2:30:57] to miss a service.
[2:31:00] Well, you'll diffuse it. He didn't mean
[2:31:04] I can't believe you had the nerve to
[2:31:06] show up. He meant my It's good to see
[2:31:09] you.
[2:31:11] We've been wondering if you was okay.
[2:31:13] It's But he didn't say that. Do you
[2:31:15] understand? We don't always say what we
[2:31:18] mean because we don't know what to say.
[2:31:22] It comes out crazy. Sister Flo, sometime
[2:31:25] I want to get my words back and chew
[2:31:27] them up and swallow them. But you can't
[2:31:30] always do it.
[2:31:33] I have to go back around some. And maybe
[2:31:34] that did I didn't I don't know if that
[2:31:36] come out like a minute or not. Have you
[2:31:39] ever had to do that? So if if we can
[2:31:42] just understand that every one of us uh
[2:31:46] is in this family of God because he
[2:31:48] called us and there's no pride in it
[2:31:51] that would make us feel like we're
[2:31:53] better than anybody else. And and if you
[2:31:55] think you don't deserve to be hurt, then
[2:31:57] you raise yourself up above the human
[2:31:59] race. Cuz everybody gets it. And
[2:32:02] everybody faces a little rejection along
[2:32:04] the way. And I will admit that some have
[2:32:07] way more of it than others, but this is
[2:32:12] not a contest to see who can carry the
[2:32:14] most rejection.
[2:32:18] And then you let that offense and you
[2:32:20] start drawing it. And you know, I've my
[2:32:23] mother I meant I mean, as she got a
[2:32:25] little older and her mind started
[2:32:27] playing tricks on her and all, things
[2:32:29] would offend her and and she you you
[2:32:31] could not talk her out of it.
[2:32:36] her fears lessened and her offenses were
[2:32:39] worse as as Alzheimer's began to settle
[2:32:43] in. But you're not there yet and I'm not
[2:32:46] there yet. By the grace of God, I don't
[2:32:48] want to be and don't have to be and
[2:32:50] neither do you. But this is just how it
[2:32:53] works sometime. But but there are people
[2:32:55] who wouldn't say back to brother Tmaine,
[2:33:00] uh, you know, none of your business.
[2:33:03] What do you write in a
[2:33:09] book to you people that don't know how
[2:33:12] to make
[2:33:13] friends? Somebody would say things like
[2:33:15] this. One one one time mother had a
[2:33:18] purse and it was a
[2:33:23] lot. It It had big big circles on it and
[2:33:28] they were kind of iridescent. It was a
[2:33:31] lot, but it wasn't smart to meet her at
[2:33:35] the door and say, "My, that is a strange
[2:33:37] looking
[2:33:40] purse." Especially if you don't have
[2:33:42] much fashion sense and you've proven it
[2:33:44] through the
[2:33:46] years. These are always the most verbal
[2:33:49] ones. The ones who tell us we don't
[2:33:54] match. Watch them.
[2:34:00] said, "My, you sure do have that sort of
[2:34:02] a strange looking purse or gaudy or
[2:34:04] whatever the word was." That was
[2:34:06] mother's favorite word was
[2:34:08] gaudy. And that might hurt your feelings
[2:34:11] and you put that purse up and never wear
[2:34:12] it again, but not her. She said, "Well,
[2:34:15] good. I didn't buy it for
[2:34:18] you, and now I know I won't have to give
[2:34:20] it to you cuz you don't like it." So, it
[2:34:23] didn't bother
[2:34:25] her. But there are people in this church
[2:34:28] that if somebody met you at the door and
[2:34:30] said,
[2:34:30] "Woo, I know where you've been shopping
[2:34:34] lately. You You'd be offended." So, you
[2:34:37] got to make up your mind.
[2:34:39] I know. I know this is a We're
[2:34:43] laughing. But I know I know I've been
[2:34:46] around people all my life, haven't you?
[2:34:50] And I know us.
[2:34:52] And and you don't always know who can
[2:34:54] handle it and who can't. And everybody's
[2:34:57] not always going to be like my mother,
[2:34:59] just aggressive back and say things like
[2:35:02] that. They're they're not. That was her
[2:35:05] rejection. That was what she had gone
[2:35:08] through in life. That was how she had
[2:35:10] responded to problems that made her
[2:35:13] tough and made her make up her mind. Uh
[2:35:16] you can only make me feel that way if I
[2:35:18] let you. That's right.
[2:35:20] We ought to have a redeemed version of
[2:35:22] that. I'm going to church. I'm going to
[2:35:24] serve the Lord. I'm going to live my
[2:35:25] life. I'm going to do the best I can.
[2:35:28] And if you don't like me, brother,
[2:35:30] that's your problem.
[2:35:34] Don't have an ugly spirit. Don't do it
[2:35:36] with bitterness. Don't do it with
[2:35:38] ugliness. But make up your mind
[2:35:42] that you're not going to let that
[2:35:43] offense turn to bitterness. Amen.
[2:35:48] Everybody couldn't have her. She was
[2:35:49] just one.
[2:35:54] Everybody couldn't have
[2:35:56] her. Who's her? Any any
[2:35:59] female. We only have so many young
[2:36:02] eligible girls through the years and so
[2:36:04] many young eligible boys. And everybody
[2:36:07] couldn't have him. I I know that there
[2:36:09] are some who would like to bring him
[2:36:11] back and give him to me, but I don't
[2:36:12] want him either, you know. You wanted
[2:36:15] him
[2:36:17] then, but there's always the one that
[2:36:20] everybody wanted and but only one could
[2:36:22] have.
[2:36:25] And stand up, shake it off, move on.
[2:36:29] God's got you. God's got you. Amen.
[2:36:32] God's got you.
[2:36:35] The way I see some people behaving, I
[2:36:37] wouldn't chase you either. If I was a
[2:36:38] single
[2:36:41] man, I got all the trouble I need. Do
[2:36:44] you understand what I'm saying? Do you
[2:36:46] know where I'm coming from? Did you ever
[2:36:48] think about the fact that you may be
[2:36:50] putting off
[2:36:51] something? You don't have to. You can
[2:36:53] heal. You can heal. I know the healer.
[2:36:56] Oh, I know the great physician. I know
[2:36:59] the one who has the bomb. Who is the
[2:37:03] bomb of Gilead? He cares. He loves you.
[2:37:08] So, so here's here. Oh
[2:37:12] my. So, then offense starts moving into
[2:37:15] bitterness, which which always uh moves
[2:37:18] into unforgiveness. Bitterness and
[2:37:20] unforgiveness are twins. They work
[2:37:22] together. I'm not going to forgive. I'm
[2:37:24] never going to forget. I'm never going
[2:37:26] to forgive. And the next thing you know,
[2:37:28] that spirit starts moving into control.
[2:37:32] I'm going to start trying to control the
[2:37:34] situations around me so that I don't
[2:37:37] feel the rejection and the offense. Come
[2:37:40] on now. And when that thing starts
[2:37:42] moving through witchcraft like that,
[2:37:45] seducing, then jealousy and envy and
[2:37:48] accusation takes over and the and the
[2:37:50] final step is isolation and
[2:37:53] division. Nobody loves me. Everybody
[2:37:56] hates me. I'm going to just sit at home
[2:37:58] and eat worms.
[2:38:01] They hate me over
[2:38:03] there. I I hate the devil. I hate how he
[2:38:07] makes people
[2:38:08] feel. So, uh, as a last thought just
[2:38:12] before the the musicians come, I I want
[2:38:15] to just hit one because I want you to
[2:38:17] see where we're going. And if if if you
[2:38:19] don't, I want to talk just a moment
[2:38:21] about the six phases of
[2:38:24] manipulation in relationships. It could
[2:38:27] be any
[2:38:28] relationship. Manipulation is a
[2:38:31] spirit. It wears many
[2:38:34] faces. I want you to see the list of
[2:38:36] them. Number one, guilt
[2:38:38] tripping. That's how people manipulate
[2:38:40] other people many times is through
[2:38:43] trying to place them under
[2:38:46] guilt. And that that guilt is to control
[2:38:49] you. It only works if you let
[2:38:53] it. My sins are gone.
[2:38:57] My past is in my past. You can't guilt
[2:39:01] me into
[2:39:03] submission. Jesus has forgiven me. This
[2:39:06] is what you have to remind yourself.
[2:39:09] Number two, the silent
[2:39:11] treatment. See how silent it
[2:39:14] gets. That's because some of us
[2:39:16] recognize one of our
[2:39:18] tools. This is how we manipulate a
[2:39:21] situation by pouting. This is how your
[2:39:24] parents did it before you. This is how
[2:39:26] you're doing it now. This is how your
[2:39:28] children will do it if you don't get a
[2:39:29] hold of yourself. This is how they will
[2:39:31] treat their spouses. How you treat your
[2:39:33] wife has a profound effect on how your
[2:39:36] children will will treat their spouse.
[2:39:39] And it goes on and on and on and on. God
[2:39:42] help us all. Amen. God help us all. The
[2:39:46] silent treatment is is uh less than
[2:39:49] kindergarten.
[2:39:54] Well, if I say anything, I'm going to be
[2:39:56] mad. Well, you need a little more
[2:39:57] self-control, Mr. Sister, Mr. Sister,
[2:40:00] whoever. But, but ignoring people and
[2:40:03] freezing them out, you really think
[2:40:05] you're fixing
[2:40:08] something. That's usually about the time
[2:40:10] a man says, "And I'm the man of the
[2:40:12] house. I'm the husband and you're the
[2:40:14] wife, and you got to do what I say while
[2:40:17] I freeze you out.
[2:40:20] You better have plenty of time to listen
[2:40:21] to me, but I don't have much time to
[2:40:23] listen to you. Number
[2:40:25] three, false
[2:40:29] humility, martyr complex. Wait till you
[2:40:32] hear it. Reverse psychology. These are
[2:40:36] ways of manipulation. Making you think
[2:40:38] it's your
[2:40:39] idea. You ever felt that?
[2:40:42] presenting something as though this is
[2:40:44] your idea when in reality this is what
[2:40:47] I'm going to I'm going to pretty well
[2:40:48] insist on you doing, but I want you to
[2:40:51] think that you thought of
[2:40:53] it. So, I'll just kind of back out and
[2:40:56] let you think you come up with the
[2:40:58] idea. And then number five,
[2:41:01] triangulation. And that is always trying
[2:41:04] to get somebody on board and using
[2:41:06] someone else's
[2:41:08] name to prove your point. Woo. That's
[2:41:13] going to be a rough one. And I just want
[2:41:15] you to know next Sunday, the Lord
[2:41:16] willing, we're going to preach a
[2:41:18] wonderful message to mothers. And it
[2:41:19] ain't going to be about triangulation.
[2:41:21] So, please come.
[2:41:25] But before this thing's over, we're
[2:41:26] going to hit triangulation.
[2:41:30] And everybody in here has done it.
[2:41:34] And for a lot of you, this is what it
[2:41:36] sounded like. Well, pastor
[2:41:41] said, "Well, brother Shelley said when I
[2:41:44] run it by him, this is what he said.
[2:41:47] Don't triangulate
[2:41:49] me. Don't pull me in. Come on. Don't
[2:41:53] pull me into your case. I'm not in your
[2:41:56] courtroom. Leave me out.
[2:41:59] This is between you and she. She and he.
[2:42:04] You and them. Mom and dad, kids, do not
[2:42:08] say to your parents for fear of your
[2:42:11] life. Brother Shelley said, I knew this
[2:42:15] would be one obvious way. Can I get a
[2:42:17] little more personal though?
[2:42:20] It's when we start saying everybody feel
[2:42:22] this is not just me. Everybody feels
[2:42:24] this way about you. I need you to know
[2:42:26] everybody feels this way. Don't you see
[2:42:27] the way they look at you? They don't
[2:42:30] really like you.
[2:42:36] And they're doing that. It's a It's a
[2:42:37] form of manipulation. They don't really
[2:42:40] like you. They're just using
[2:42:43] you. What for your
[2:42:47] salad? You don't think nobody else can
[2:42:50] make a
[2:42:51] salad? Oh, it's good in here today. I
[2:42:55] apologize to you who brought
[2:42:59] visitors. Don't be that way. Don't drag
[2:43:02] somebody in. Don't use somebody else's
[2:43:05] name. Don't make it sound like everybody
[2:43:07] is agreeing with you and this poor
[2:43:10] person that you're belittling is the
[2:43:12] only one that everybody's against. Don't
[2:43:15] do that, brother, sister. It's
[2:43:17] witchcraft. I'm telling you, it's not
[2:43:19] how the bride will operate in these last
[2:43:21] days. We got to get a hold of ourselves.
[2:43:29] Well, I was talking to sister so and so
[2:43:30] and she she said I was
[2:43:32] right. And you know how pastor feels
[2:43:35] about her. He's got a lot of confidence
[2:43:37] in
[2:43:40] her. And then the
[2:43:42] worst is number six, spiritual
[2:43:44] manipulation. And that's the kind that
[2:43:46] operates in the pull pit. It's the kind
[2:43:48] that operates in a
[2:43:50] home when a father tries to use or a
[2:43:53] husband tries to use spiritual
[2:43:55] manipulative technique. I can show you
[2:43:57] how what it sounds like at some
[2:43:59] point. Making everyone feel like no one
[2:44:02] is re is revelated or no one is as
[2:44:05] spiritual or no one is as holy or no one
[2:44:08] knows the message as much, no one read
[2:44:11] the Bible as much as as as
[2:44:13] me. making everybody else feel like, you
[2:44:16] know,
[2:44:18] just kindergarteners in the faith and
[2:44:21] then using that to try to manipulate and
[2:44:23] get your way or your will. Folks, that
[2:44:25] is serious
[2:44:27] witchcraft. And it goes on. Now, let me
[2:44:31] give you this in closing. Musicians
[2:44:32] start moving this way. It's 1:41. Not
[2:44:34] too
[2:44:35] late. It's quiet because you was hoping
[2:44:38] that I was
[2:44:40] done. But I want to show you just the
[2:44:42] beginning of one of them. Guilt
[2:44:45] tripping. This is placing a guilt trip
[2:44:47] on
[2:44:48] somebody. It's This is how it operates.
[2:44:52] Stay stay with me just a moment so I
[2:44:55] don't have to do this over and over
[2:44:56] again. It's used to shift the focus off
[2:45:00] the issue at hand and onto the
[2:45:03] manipulator sacrifices, efforts, or
[2:45:07] pain. You don't know what I've been
[2:45:09] through.
[2:45:12] You don't know the sacrifices I've made
[2:45:14] for
[2:45:17] you. So the least that you can do is do
[2:45:20] what I tell
[2:45:22] you. That's leverage. It's emotional
[2:45:24] leverage. It's illegal in the kingdom.
[2:45:28] The one confronting the wrong suddenly
[2:45:30] feels like the offender. It often
[2:45:33] masquerades as selflessness, but it's
[2:45:35] driven by
[2:45:37] self-pity and the need to control the
[2:45:41] outcome.
[2:45:45] I'm always open to someone's uh gifted
[2:45:48] idea of how we will sit at the table or
[2:45:51] how we will uh make our journey over if
[2:45:54] we need another vehicle or if someone
[2:45:56] can come up with a better plan of who
[2:45:58] goes with who and who sits with who and
[2:46:00] how it works out that those things
[2:46:02] confuse me and I'm not interested in
[2:46:04] laying all that out
[2:46:06] anyway. But I have watched people use
[2:46:09] things like
[2:46:11] that, manipulating who rides with who,
[2:46:14] who goes with who, what time we go, what
[2:46:17] we do first, where we eat, and do it in
[2:46:20] such a way. And somebody say, "What's
[2:46:21] wrong? What's wrong with that?" The
[2:46:22] problem is if we do it over things that
[2:46:25] don't matter, it's a sign that we've got
[2:46:28] a problem of needing to control every
[2:46:33] situation.
[2:46:37] I don't know where I want to go, but I
[2:46:39] don't want to go
[2:46:42] there. It masquerades as some I have no
[2:46:46] opinion. But the reality is I have an
[2:46:49] opinion about everything and I'm trying
[2:46:51] to make sure that you listen to me. You
[2:46:54] you think you do you get it? And so this
[2:46:57] type of manipulation seeks to use
[2:46:59] emotional debt and obligation. Do you
[2:47:02] remember when I was there for
[2:47:07] you? Do you remember how I reached out
[2:47:10] to you when you were in trouble? This is
[2:47:12] how it works. Rather than
[2:47:15] communicating needs
[2:47:18] openly, it frames the conversation in
[2:47:21] such a way that the other party feels
[2:47:22] guilty for not giving, helping or
[2:47:25] submitting.
[2:47:27] This creates an emotional obligation
[2:47:30] instead of free
[2:47:31] will. It bypasses direct communication
[2:47:35] and pressures others into
[2:47:38] compliance. The spirit behind it feeds
[2:47:40] on
[2:47:43] sympathy. But all that sympathy does is
[2:47:46] just empower the manipulator to gain
[2:47:51] more leverage.
[2:47:57] If you look around this room and you see
[2:47:59] that you have gone through
[2:48:04] friends, one right after
[2:48:07] another, and you don't understand why
[2:48:09] people dislike you so much, I'm just
[2:48:12] asking you to consider the possibility
[2:48:14] that it's because you can't just be.
[2:48:20] If you can't control, you can't just
[2:48:24] be. And so anyone who will not be
[2:48:27] controlled by you, you push out of your
[2:48:29] life or you push them over the
[2:48:33] edge until they have to tell you, "Look,
[2:48:35] I'm it's no longer safe for us to be
[2:48:37] together all the time. You're pushing me
[2:48:39] to places that I don't want to go."
[2:48:41] Look, folks, sometime we have to draw
[2:48:42] some boundaries.
[2:48:44] I hope you hear me. We don't have to be
[2:48:48] rude, but you don't have to call the
[2:48:50] pastor in every time you need to say to
[2:48:52] somebody, "I just think that we need a
[2:48:54] little distance in our relationship
[2:48:56] because it's getting a little
[2:48:58] uncomfortable. I need to be able to turn
[2:49:00] around without you being up under me. I
[2:49:02] need to be able to do a certain thing
[2:49:05] without you controlling every situation
[2:49:08] and using it for your agenda."
[2:49:14] what you're preaching, pastor, has the
[2:49:16] potential of blowing the church up.
[2:49:19] Well, what I'm praying is that is if any
[2:49:22] of this is going on among us, I'm
[2:49:24] praying that we will cry out to the Lord
[2:49:27] that we will see ourselves instead of
[2:49:29] just see. I know you're sitting there
[2:49:31] thinking, "Well, I know who that could
[2:49:32] apply to." If that's the case, you're
[2:49:35] missing it. You're supposed to be
[2:49:37] sitting here this morning saying, "Lord,
[2:49:38] is any of this for me?"
[2:49:41] Instead of being like the disciples, who
[2:49:43] who is it? Is it him? Is it her? Is it
[2:49:46] the other? You need to be the one say,
[2:49:47] "Is it I? Am I the one that has
[2:49:50] manipulated people with my opinion?"
[2:49:57] Somebody said, "How could you leave a
[2:49:58] service like this and have the victory?"
[2:50:00] Because I'm telling you, he is the
[2:50:02] remedy.
[2:50:04] This word is the answer. Let's stand.
[2:50:10] Let me just give you a few of the common
[2:50:12] phrases while you stretch. Stretch. Go
[2:50:14] ahead. Stretch. Deep
[2:50:16] stretches. You can put your hands up.
[2:50:18] Stretch. Twist your back. Whatever you
[2:50:21] need to do. These are phrases you'll
[2:50:24] hear in a relationship where
[2:50:25] manipulation and control is being uh uh
[2:50:28] used after all I've done for you.
[2:50:35] something like, "Do you know where you
[2:50:37] were when I met
[2:50:40] you? Do you know the mess you were in
[2:50:43] when do you know how bad you needed me
[2:50:46] when I come
[2:50:50] along? I must not be important to you
[2:50:55] anymore. I sacrifice so much and this is
[2:50:58] how you treat
[2:51:00] me. I guess everything I do just goes
[2:51:03] unnoticed.
[2:51:07] I'm always the one
[2:51:09] given. What do I get in
[2:51:14] return? You might have looked at some of
[2:51:16] these statements in the past as a cry
[2:51:18] for
[2:51:20] help. But what it often is is a need to
[2:51:25] control.
[2:51:29] If I can cause you to feel guilty enough
[2:51:33] for the times I did right on your on
[2:51:35] your
[2:51:36] behalf, you might look
[2:51:39] over the
[2:51:42] abuse, the verbal
[2:51:44] abuse that I'm giving you
[2:51:49] now. We didn't know growing up what
[2:51:52] narcissism
[2:51:54] was. And now we we we know more about
[2:51:57] it. We read more about it. We see more
[2:51:59] about it and we realize that every one
[2:52:02] of us have been affected along our our
[2:52:04] life with with narcissistic behavior
[2:52:07] started in our parents for some of us
[2:52:09] and has followed us from boss man to
[2:52:12] pastor to what to whatever else.
[2:52:16] And the reality is the the person
[2:52:18] operating in that kind of control as a
[2:52:21] narcissist will can do just about
[2:52:24] anything and then turn around and
[2:52:26] convince you you're the one that did the
[2:52:30] wrong and you will come to the place
[2:52:32] where you don't know. You don't know.
[2:52:35] You'll enter into a relationship like
[2:52:38] that knowing who you are and knowing
[2:52:40] what you're capable of and knowing that
[2:52:43] you have worth. I might not be as
[2:52:45] valuable as as so- and so, but I know
[2:52:47] I'm I matter to somebody. And the next
[2:52:50] thing you know, you will be so
[2:52:52] manipulated by narcissistic behavior, by
[2:52:55] not really remembering who you are in
[2:52:58] Christ. You see, even in abusive
[2:53:00] situations, you've got to remind
[2:53:02] yourself over and over again, I am I am
[2:53:06] what Jesus says I am. I am what the word
[2:53:11] says I am. That's right. You are not the
[2:53:14] dictionary of who I am. God's word is.
[2:53:19] And many of us have entered into
[2:53:20] relationships like that with confidence
[2:53:23] in knowing who we are. And before it's
[2:53:26] over. You may be
[2:53:30] right. You might be the only one that
[2:53:32] would have
[2:53:34] me. You're probably right. No one else
[2:53:38] would be attracted to me. You're
[2:53:39] probably right.
[2:53:42] I tell you that makes me mad
[2:53:44] enough that I'd like to knock the
[2:53:47] devil's block off because that's how he
[2:53:50] operates. Not just in the world, not
[2:53:53] just in the Somebody said, "But I want
[2:53:55] you to preach the message, folks."
[2:53:57] Brother Brandham might not have kneedeed
[2:53:59] all the terms. He might not have had a
[2:54:01] 2025 vocabulary, but he laid the
[2:54:05] groundwork for a message just like this.
[2:54:09] Amen. He laid the groundwork. I can show
[2:54:12] you that. He laid the groundwork. He
[2:54:16] told us where the battle would be. He
[2:54:18] showed us the only way out of the
[2:54:20] battle.
[2:54:21] And and and again, terms change and
[2:54:24] vocabulary changes. But I don't find
[2:54:26] this contrary to the message that he
[2:54:29] preached. And I certainly don't find it
[2:54:30] contrary to the word. And what I find it
[2:54:33] is it's just God turning the search
[2:54:35] light on us. Because if you recognize
[2:54:38] yourself as a control freak to your own
[2:54:41] family, surely before the Lord, you're
[2:54:44] going to want to ask God to help you. If
[2:54:46] you're a child of God, you're going to
[2:54:48] want to say, "Lord, I don't like that
[2:54:51] description. That is ugly. I don't want
[2:54:54] to be that. I don't want to say that. I
[2:54:56] don't want to operate like that. I want
[2:54:59] to nurture and love and and and help and
[2:55:02] encourage and strengthen
[2:55:07] I don't want to
[2:55:08] abuse. Anybody still
[2:55:16] here? Lord, I thank
[2:55:20] you that you're the
[2:55:23] answer. Anger is not the
[2:55:26] answer. Making up our mind, we're not
[2:55:29] taking it anymore in anger, that's not
[2:55:32] the answer.
[2:55:34] The only answer I know is to invite Sar
[2:55:36] Shalom, the Prince of Peace, to come in
[2:55:39] and move on our
[2:55:41] behalf. Lord, we just reach our faith
[2:55:44] toward you in this house before we go
[2:55:46] today. I've kept these people so long,
[2:55:48] I've worn them out, but I'm calling on
[2:55:50] you to help me in my in my human fraily.
[2:55:53] I'm asking you, Lord, to let somebody
[2:55:55] see hope, not despair, not hopelessness,
[2:55:59] not I'm in a situation that I have no
[2:56:01] control over at all. Not that it'll
[2:56:04] never be any better, but let somebody
[2:56:06] make up their mind.
[2:56:08] I'm going to I'm going to be, it might
[2:56:11] not be overnight, but I'm going to be
[2:56:12] who God said I am.
[2:56:15] I'm not going to live under such
[2:56:17] rejection that I I'm determined that
[2:56:19] everybody uh uh hates me and nobody
[2:56:21] wants me around and I'm I'm not invited.
[2:56:24] I'm not I'm not uh uh you know, I'm so
[2:56:27] uncomfortable when I'm around. I I want
[2:56:29] the Lord to just so dress you in his
[2:56:32] word that that that you don't move in
[2:56:34] pride, but you do move in the confidence
[2:56:36] of the Lord and the courage of the Lord.
[2:56:39] Hallelujah. And if the enemy tells you
[2:56:41] you're you're you're just all of that,
[2:56:43] all the preacher talked about, that's
[2:56:44] who you are, and and you just don't
[2:56:46] hardly stand a chance, you just need to
[2:56:48] tell the
[2:56:49] enemy that I may not be what I ought to
[2:56:52] be or what I want to be, but I can tell
[2:56:54] you this. I'm not what I was. I'm not
[2:56:58] what I used to be. And I have come this
[2:57:01] far by faith and by the grace of
[2:57:04] Almighty God.
[2:57:07] Grace covers it all.
[2:57:09] Grace makes it possible for the blood to
[2:57:19] redeem. I've had people say to, "Brother
[2:57:22] Shelley, I just I just I've just I just
[2:57:25] uh I just couldn't get a good woman.
[2:57:27] I've just had I've just had too many bad
[2:57:30] women. I I just wasn't able to live with
[2:57:33] any of them."
[2:57:35] And and that may be the shop talk around
[2:57:38] the around this stuff, you know, where
[2:57:41] the man can and the woman can't and all
[2:57:43] that kind of stuff that people get
[2:57:45] twisted up
[2:57:46] in. Use that for an excuse. But you know
[2:57:48] what? I've had to tell a person or two.
[2:57:50] I've got some names in my mind, but I'll
[2:57:52] swallow them. I've had to tell a person
[2:57:54] or two. Have you ever thought about the
[2:57:55] fact you may be the problem?
[2:57:59] Because I'm looking here. You're
[2:58:00] describing to me three different women
[2:58:02] with three different
[2:58:03] ways. And there's only one common
[2:58:05] denominator in all these three
[2:58:07] relationships. It's
[2:58:08] you. Maybe you're the
[2:58:11] one. And you know, some people get mad
[2:58:13] and some people say, "Well, well,
[2:58:18] I well, I never looked at it like
[2:58:22] that." But it is
[2:58:25] possible. Some relationships were never
[2:58:28] meant to be.
[2:58:30] And you'll have to cut your losses and
[2:58:31] realize
[2:58:34] that you weren't called to be a friend
[2:58:36] to every person. You're called to be
[2:58:39] friendly, to show yourself friendly, to
[2:58:41] love the ones that you can love, to to
[2:58:43] help the ones that you can help. The the
[2:58:46] whole world is not riding on your
[2:58:47] shoulder. The hardest lesson that a
[2:58:50] preacher has to learn in his life is
[2:58:51] there are certain people I may love
[2:58:53] them, but it doesn't mean I can help
[2:58:55] them. uh and you start praying for God
[2:58:57] to raise up somebody who can. Do you
[2:59:00] take it personal? Yes, of course you do
[2:59:01] at first. And do you feel insufficient?
[2:59:04] And do you feel like you're a failure?
[2:59:05] Of course you do at first. But then you
[2:59:07] have to realize if you think you can
[2:59:10] help everybody and fix everybody, you're
[2:59:12] operating in pride, not in humility. The
[2:59:15] goal is to get them to somebody who can
[2:59:17] help them. I know the answer, folks.
[2:59:19] It's Jesus. I know the answer for the
[2:59:22] struggles in your marriage. It's Jesus.
[2:59:24] I know the answer to the struggles with
[2:59:26] your children and the little rebellion
[2:59:28] that operates in them. It's Jesus. I
[2:59:31] know the problem. I know how to fix the
[2:59:33] problem between you and sister soandso
[2:59:35] and you and brother so and so. It's
[2:59:36] Jesus. It's just surrendering. It's
[2:59:39] getting out from under the spirit of
[2:59:41] Leodysia that demands its rights. And
[2:59:43] it's coming under a spirit of humility
[2:59:45] that says if I can just be humble, God
[2:59:49] can fix things. If I get out of the way,
[2:59:53] he can move on my behalf. Search me, oh
[2:59:56] God,
[2:59:58] today. Search us
[3:00:00] today. Sometimes, Lord, when we see our
[3:00:03] shortcomings, we feel like we're not
[3:00:06] worthy to worship you. And yet, you say
[3:00:08] to
[3:00:09] us, I inhabit the praises of my people.
[3:00:12] Was that just the perfect people? No,
[3:00:15] it's your
[3:00:16] people. We stand here today as the
[3:00:19] people of God. And before we leave this
[3:00:21] house, we're going to lift up the name
[3:00:23] of Jesus. We're going to worship God
[3:00:25] before we go. Uh even though I have
[3:00:28] taken a lot of time, let's come and do
[3:00:30] it. If you have to slip out, we
[3:00:32] certainly
[3:00:33] understand this isn't the normal
[3:00:39] church. Let's give it praise. Let's
[3:00:42] thank you for bringing us this far.
[3:00:45] Let's believe the God who started this
[3:00:47] work in us is big enough to finish it.
[3:00:49] If you believe that, say amen. Amen. I
[3:00:53] saw the Lord.
[3:00:59] Seated on his
[3:01:05] throne, he was clothed in glory,
[3:01:11] [Music]
[3:01:15] exalted
[3:01:19] high. And the train of his
[3:01:27] robe, it filled the temple.
[3:01:34] Glory. And the
[3:01:36] angels circled around him,
[3:01:40] Jesus
[3:01:43] and cry.
[3:01:50] Oh,
[3:01:51] you
[3:01:53] are
[3:01:57] holy.
[3:01:59] Oh,
[3:02:00] so

[3:02:09] holy, Lord of all.

[3:02:35] you are you are
[3:02:38] holy,
[3:02:40] Lord of
[3:02:45] all. For wo is me.
[3:02:54] For
[3:02:55] I'm
[3:02:57] [Music]
[3:02:59] unclean and for my
[3:03:02] eyes have
[3:03:06] seen the holy
[3:03:13] king. But then he cleansed my lips
[3:03:21] right before my
[3:03:27] eyes and the pillars
[3:03:34] shook as the
[3:03:37] angels
[3:03:39] cried. Holy is the
[3:03:43] lamb
[3:03:45] you are. You are
[3:03:49] holy. Oh
[3:03:54] so
[3:03:56] holy. Oh
[3:03:59] you are. You are holy.
[3:04:04] Holy Lord of
[3:04:09] all.
[3:04:11] Oh
[3:04:13] you are you are
[3:04:18] holy. Oh
[3:04:22] so holy.
[3:04:26] Oh,
[3:04:28] you are you are
[3:04:31] holy Lord of
[3:04:38] all for woe is
[3:04:45] me for
[3:04:52] Ian for my eyes
[3:04:55] have
[3:04:59] seen the holy king.
[3:05:05] Hallelujah. But then he cleans my
[3:05:10] [Applause]
[3:05:12] lips right before my eyes.
[3:05:21] And the pillars
[3:05:26] show as the
[3:05:29] angels
[3:05:32] cry. Holy is the
[3:05:36] lamb.
[3:05:38] You are You are
[3:05:42] holy. Oh
