who really need encouragement who need help and neither one of them are ashamed to pray or embarrassed to pray and they just start pray praying for people in the hallways in the rooms wherever they are and God is using them and it humbles my heart to see the the spirit that they're carrying and the attitude that they have and the faith that they're demonstrating and uh when we prayed this morning that's what we prayed is that God would continue to do that but we would like to see him whole and they were perhaps going to do an MRI to check to see if there was anything else going on but we give God the praise for being with him this week and for letting him have Clarity and that's an awful thing it's a fearful thing when you're going through so much else so we thank God that they're with us and they're streaming this morning brother Steve Martell is out of the hospital and uh I haven't heard the verdict about his toes but at one time they were thinking about uh having to take off

the world we are blessed I think those are the ones that have mentioned where they're from and I'm just glad to have them a part of this service this morning Romans chapter 8 verse 26 and 27 we are going to speak this morning on the spirit of Supplication and you might call it the spirit of intercession because this is the same kind of operation in prayer supplication and intercession likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God how many of you know that is is effective prayer when the spirit of God is praying through you it is effective prayer I don't want to go any further before I say I know you're standing I am as well I don't want to go any further before I mention this that can be in English the spirit of God can pray through you in your native tongue with understanding the Bible said or it can be in an unknown language a language or a tongue of the spirit that you did not learn there are those who have spoken in other tongues of men that they have never learned I have been in the room when that happen supernaturally God communicated with a different people Group by speaking to them in their own language unlearned by the speaker but there are also tongues of angels and Heavenly languages that we have not come to know but the spirit may use them and may utilize them in intercession and supplication and the truth is we are not ashamed this is a talking in tongu zone that's right we believe and someone said I wouldn't want to go back to that I never left it so I'm saying this to all of my fellow brothers and sisters who follow the ministry of brother brandom I don't have to go back to Pentecost as an experience I never left that experience and I don't have to go back to speaking in tongues because I never stopped speaking in tongues we found the order of the word the word of God gives us an order doesn't he now Zechariah 12 and verse 10 and then you may have your seats Zechariah 12 and10 prophecy and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness or grief for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn Lord we come to you today so thankful so grateful my heart nearly explodes when I think about what the Holy Ghost has been in my life and I look across this room and I know that there are those standing here today that wouldn't be alive they wouldn't be breathing breath on this side of the curtain of time had it not been for the power of the Holy Ghost in their life so Lord we want want to emphasize today the Holy Ghost and how he operates in The Believer Lord we believe it's necessary it's not optional to have that experience it completes and finishes the new birth so around this room young and old we want to thank you for filling us for baptizing us with both the Holy Ghost and the fire of God that burns out the chest thank you for the convicting power of the Holy Ghost in our life and we thank you for how he operates in various offices and administrations to bring us into the stature of the perfect man our Lord Jesus Christ now Lord I ask that we would have ears to hear your word that you would stand against every W of the enemy for we know that there are thousands times 10 thousands of demon spirits who oppose the preaching of the revealed word and particularly that truth that was loosed under those seals and so today we're asking you Lord to stand up in this house in our midst and drive back that opposing force that that would desire and seek to hinder others from hearing and Discerning truth we are being trans formed day by day minute by minute by the truth of your word we give all the glory all the honor all the praise to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is Yeshua our Messiah we say amen amen amen amen you may be seated we are a blessed people come on now I need your help a little bit this morning we are a blessed people to have what we have what the blood has done for us could and should never be underestimated we could stand on our feet and praise him the duration of this day our hands in the air our mouths open with praise and never praise him sufficiently for what it means to us we are bumping into people all the time that have no hope no idea no answers come on miserable wretched broken families with no hope and we pray that God would use us that our lives would shine that it would count for him but we are so thankful oh my now let's slow down just a moment and I want to show you these things on the screen for you that have been making notes we are on the sixth Office of the Holy Holy Ghost I have said almost every time that I don't know if that is the right word to use maybe Administration would be a right word or it's a little more than just the working of the spirit because if we should talk about all the ways the spirit works the list would almost be endless at least it would go beyond my understanding and knowledge but it seems to me like there are at least seven specific Ministries our offices of the Holy Ghost in the life of the believer we're not just talking about his work in the earth we're talking about his work in the bride in his people and so I would like to not take a lot of time for review but I have asked them to take my notes that I gave them this morning and put it on the board for you to check up on your notes so that you would have all seven of these offices are administrations of the spirit written down so do we have that now the first four we've covered those because we're on the sixth the first four number one was the spirit of life if you need the scriptures that go along with the spirit of Life we'll be happy to provide them for you but we also point you to our app you can download the app if you haven't even those of you who are streaming this service in other nations you can download the app you can find a particular sermon in a series and you can find the the scriptures will be there the the quotations from the message of the hour will be there and you can do your own study you can study it out and let God speak to your heart personally and individually but uh this is just a brief uh naming of them again so that we can can talk today about the spirit of Supplication number one was the spirit of life he creates or recreates God's Divine Life in us how many of you remember that you are living a life that is not of this world you have graduated to a new kind of life and we are no longer our own and this is not just mortal life that we are living this is or this is not ordinary life it is out of the ordinary life not natural life but Supernatural Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are infused with the very Life of Christ so that means that the very spirit that was in the Lord Jesus brother random told us so many times all that was in the father he emptied that into the son no wonder Jesus could say when you've seen me you've seen the father you had because all that was in the father father was now residing in him the son I didn't just make that up how many of you know that's red letter that's red letter if you've got red letters in your Bible it just says it when you've seen me you've seen the father and yet he says I can do nothing on my own unless I see him or hear him then I am Duty bound to keep my peace so there was something moving on the inside of him and it had to be this way he had to come both as God and man the Divine Life had to condescend to a natural life so that you and I could be reconciled to a great God what a plan are you with me then look this way there's nobody in here more interesting than I am right now cuz I'm bringing you God's word number two the spirit of Truth the Spirit of Truth oh my this is one of the things that we can get so disturbed about when we see the world around us falling into darker and darker error knowing that even you and I have been on such a journey shedding things along the way that were not of Truth we all had training we all had teaching we don't Proclaim to have or understand or know all the truth yet but the truth is being revealed it's being revealed by the Holy Ghost and so I appreciate the office that he holds in our lives as the spirit of Truth he is bringing us to a more perfect revelation of God one of the things that the prophet talked about that I love so much is he talks about God being so expansive so big so multifaceted so multi-dimensional that he would be still continuing to reveal himself throughout all eternity that blows my mind when we see him we will know him for we will be like him and yet there will still be more about him that we will have revealed to us throughout all eternity like peeling the layers of an onion you will know yes you will know and you will understand it better by and by and all of these different things but wouldn't that be something to be in eternity you're not worried anymore once you step into that realm you're not worried about what you didn't understand that's right you know you can make a list of questions you want to ask him oh I can't wait to get there to ask I just want you to know that when you get there your list ain't going with you you won't even worry about why what will matter when you see him but what an eternity to think about Brother Richard is the possibility of sitting at his feet and one day him looking down and saying Richard Stephen do you remember when you didn't understand such and such here's the reason why oh it wasn't worrying you or troubling you you were at peace with him in eternity but he remembered and he said I wanted to show you something I wanted you to see now what all of that was about somebody said I just can't imagine that I can't really imagine it either but I believe that there's a God that we serve that is so big that we couldn't possibly register it all at one time so he just keeps on revealing even the revelation of Jesus Christ is so big we can't get it all at one time even the truths that were found beneath those seven seals are so big that we can't perceive it all at one time so God just keeps on revealing himself as the spirit Spirit of life as the spirit of Truth number three we talked about the spirit of adoption and that Spirit of adoption is transforming us from little immature babies yes little crying whining selfish you all can preach I was get to pouting I had my mama look down at me and say Stephen Shelly I could walk to town on those lips anybody know what that means I was pouting and I pooched my lips out so far pouting like a little brat and she'd say I could walk to town on those on those lips she said you get over here I'm going to pinch you under the arm boy my mama knew how to set me straight in a hurry that hurt more than a than a paddle on my leg because she didn't have much Mercy when she was twisting I I've looked at her many times said Mama I think you're taking a plug right out of my arm she said I hope I might she said I might I might I don't ever want to have to have this conversation again we all can be pouty when we're immature somebody didn't Shake our hands somebody didn't speak to us somebody didn't acknowledge us somebody didn't brag on our children you know one thing and then another and it gets even diff more difficult than that in a close-nit community because we're just constantly stepping on one another not intentionally but it's near impossible to know what you're thinking at all times why you would kill a pastor if all he had to do was spend his time trying to figure out what you were thinking so that I wouldn't step on you you understand this can be a very vicious cycle and if you're a person who believes the whole universe revolves around you I want you to know that Authority doesn't leave your door right in your home the whole world may revolve around you but once you step out of that home Brothers amen once you step out of that home you will quickly find that the whole world doesn't revolve around you there's a whole world going on out there and they don't even know sometime even Brothers and Sisters in Christ we don't even know sometimes when people are offended that's right I was reading Paul's note this morning uh on Facebook before I ever got out of bed about 6:00 and I was rejoicing with him for the victory that that he has made in making himself Desiring to be more healthy what a wonderful thing and in that worthy to be to be celebrated and to be mentioned and you that are neighbors you know he has you know he's telling the truth not only because of losing weight but because you've seen him putting in the work but did you know sometimes people will get offended at someone celebrating a victory that they worked really hard to get and not even recognize that the celebration is not to bring attention to oneself it's to inspire somebody else now I know Paul enough to know that when he what he said he said because he wanted to inspire me and he wanted to inspire you to do the same thing how many of you know that's what brothers and sisters do for each other but there'll be people offended by such as that there'll be people that'll say things like why you're calling me fat see we we are being moved from something little like that to something a whole lot more mature than that this is not the only church age that's had to deal with the immaturity of the believer it started in the first church age the Ephesian Church age where Paul was the Apostle come on now and he was constantly having to talk to the people about how they behaved among themselves the attitude that They Carried when they got into public meeting the way they were treating one another the way they esteemed one another amen the way they compromised with each other Spirits instead of calling each other out to Deliverance he had a lot to say about it but I want you to know that something has happened in this last Church age there is a power and an authority that is available to you and I as a Believer that's even more potent than it was in the first church age because we are the generation that has to overcome there has to be a people in the last of the last days that go all the way back to the beginning and say this is what we must possess as children of the Lord Jesus Christ we must have the healing virtue among us we must be able to cast out devils in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we must see Miracles and signs and wonders as the Bible has promised and no generation has been better positioned to inherit those things than this one because Jesus is no longer hiding himself behind the lattice he's no longer clothing himself in any kind of religious expression but he has now stepped out from behind the veil Hallelujah and if you want to find where he is he's coming up out of the Wilderness that's where he is you heard what brother Shaw said where is he he's coming up out of the Wilderness and guess what I see when I see him I see a little bride walking out of that Wilderness with him by the grace of God she smells just like he smells his anointing and his fragrance is upon her who is this that I see come coming out of the Wilderness hallelujah it's the Bride of Jesus Christ leaning her head on her beloved listening to his heartbeat Desiring to do his Works Hallelujah yes and all hell is against that truth all hell is against that Revelation now you can let somebody keep you back you can let somebody hold you back if you want to but I'm telling you you'll have nobody to blame on the Reckoning day but yourself it's up to you and I to say no one I think the old church may have had more victory over that than we did because they said if Mama don't go you know I had to sing that for a long time and mean it if Mama don't go if Daddy don't go if brother don't go and sister don't go and neighbor don't don't go I can't let it hinder me I got my eyes on the prize you may still be under a denominational spirit and you may think the prize is a mansion or a gold Street or a pearly gate but I want you to know that's not the goal the goal is Jesus Christ he's the goal to have him to be found in him that's the goal that's what we're pressing toward we're pressing toward a high calling and that High Calling is to be found in the image and the character of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah we're not going to walk barefooted we're not going to walk in a robe we're not going to conduct ourselves like they did in second temple period That's not we're what we're talking about we're talking about IR relevant people not because they have fashioned themselves after the the making of this old world but because they have held to a truth let me tell you something Jesus is more relevant than anything I know he is not outdated or oldfashioned or Antiquated he is the same yesterday today and forever he lives and he is just as able to move among us today as he was in the book of Acts as he was in the Ephesian Church age or any of the other Church Ages come on now do you believe that this Spirit of adoption is calling us into a higher way yes into an ascended life oh yes one that is not so influenced by the howling winds around us or someone's harsh look but we're Rising above that with our eyes on Jesus oh can you see him can you see the Lord I see him in his word I hear him in the messages that I listen to I see him and hear him when I open my bible I see the Lord there when I look at my brothers and sisters here this morning I see Jesus I know that he's with us you know that's something to dance about that's something to celebrate don't despise my praise or I may get worse than I already am I Want To Praise Him with everything that's within me because I know there's Victory every time we break through our feeling and we break through our physical ailments I'm not going to show you I don't want you to see it's none of your business I'm not going to show you my elbow because anybody who's seen it has said I don't I can't forget it charity but haulk I don't know how many others that saw my elbow they said I'll never I'll never unsee that because for several weeks it's been so swollen and so much fluid in it it doesn't really hurt me that much but it's so ugly I look like a old man sister Sandy looking at my elbow this one looks good and this one looks like an old person somewhere sitting in an a old aged home and when I started to praise the Lord this morning it was pinching a little bit and a pain kind of R radiated down my shoulder I want you to know I have no intention of not giving him praise I have no intention of not lifting up my hand and praising the Lord you know that the enemy will whispered you know you people know get in your knees your the enemy will whis say you're going to make it worse you really suffer now I tell you I don't believe it I don't believe it and you don't have to believe it you make up your mind to give God praise I feel victory in this house Hallelujah I feel Victory I'm standing on that Victory I pray it reaches down right now into that hospital room where our brother is laying I pray the victory of the Holy Ghost will move for him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord God manifest who you are manifest who you are Hallelujah just above Nan manifest who you are so we this Spirit of adoption Works patiently in US anybody thankful for the patience I'm so thankful I don't know about you but sometimes I hear the spirit of the Lord saying to my heart didn't we go over this didn't we already go over this haven't we already walked through this need I remind you again and I say yes papa I just blame it on anything I said yes Lord yes papa I'm one of those that sometimes looking for their phone while it's in his hand I I'm one of those that can forget a lot of things I have I've forgotten a lot of things and so I need to be reminded because these things are a lot more important than where my phone is or whose birthday I missed these things are lifechanging what the spirit of God desires to teach us in this hour we need patience we need him to be patient with us and he is and this Spirit of adoption is working in us until we can be Paul the sons of knowledge and I don't think that is in any way referring to head knowledge is it it's referring to knowing him in in Intimacy in a personal relationship and in capital letters they're mature sons and this is a people who are being made mature spiritually but I want you to know that maturity is not limited to the spirit and soul of man to the mind and the will and the emotions of man but it will also Al transfer into the way we live our lives so we've got to quit pouting we got to quit marching out of here like little babies when somebody's got on our feelings run to get in our vehicle so we don't have to speak to somebody we're going to have to grow up above that kind of behavior God's holy ghost is in Us by the spirit of adoption working patiently in us until we can be called the sons of knowledge the sons of intimacy the mature sons of God number four thank you ladies you've done a great job the spirit of Holiness it causes our relationship to grow into the realization and revelation of his Holiness woo his Holiness you all got a minute good I want to read you on something it'll take me just a minute I got to read the right one when I'm gone I I y'all can just delete all that's in the cloud just delete it all you can delete all 400,000 of the pictures that I have there and that's not even all my per just delete them all nobody will care after that but when I find something I like I have to take a picture of it or write it down or something so I can remember it I know you're not that way I can tell by the way you're looking at me but I'm that way and this is what one of my friends posted this week on social media and you might have seen it and just about the time I think Lord I just don't have time to keep up with that anyway and there's so much preaching against it and I don't want to be guilty of doing something I shouldn't do just about the time I do that someone reaches out and says says now that you are streaming your services live and on the internet without my life is transformed my questions are answered and so I say no I'm not going to turn loose of social media just yet I'm going to try my best to keep it in its place and I encourage you to do the same thing but here one of my friends posted this in order to believe the lie this is going to be a you know some people don't believe security like I do you cannot believe in the sovereignty of God and not understand that there is security to the believer and you're not going to go out of here and live like the devil if you've really been born again you may slip you may slide you may have some issues but I want you to know the old fear of the old church system no longer resides in the heart of the believer we we don't live this life because of fear we're not walking different and talking different and dressing different because we're afraid that's right we're doing it as an offering of Thanksgiving to God for what he has accomplished on our behalf are you with me but someone put this little uh slogan up it says in order to believe the lie that you can lose your salvation you must first believe the lie that you have earned your salvation now you may not think that's good but I think that's good I think that's good because all the fear that tries to torment somebody I'm going to if I'm losing this I'm losing that or I'm going to miss the Rapture I'm going to all of this fear that will paralyze you it won't listen fear has never produced conviction true fear fear will never produce genuine conviction fear usually releases condemnation but when you get to a place to see what God has done for you on your behalf then your heart can't thank him enough and your life wants to follow and you want to glorify him and honor him can you say Amen the final three I don't mean to Rattle on so the final three we've talked about the spirit of Life the spirit of Truth the spirit of adoption the spirit of Holiness and now we're mentioning the spirit of Grace that's the last one that we covered it governs the attitudes and actions of the believer who has learned to walk in dependence not independent but in dependence on the Holy Spirit you can't earn it you don't deserve it without the Holy Spirit every one of us are going to fall right on our Noggin head we are never going to be successful living in a higher Place living a spirit-led life if we don't learn to depend I mean depend on the Holy Ghost the problem with my Pentecostal background is there was too much emphasis on a Feeling there's nothing wrong with feeling I'm not ashamed to feel the presence of the Lord but a feeling can come and go you can feel something and not be changed by something but we're not emphasizing just how you feel whether you're you're getting a hair to stand up on your arm or a goosebump or something like that this the Holy Ghost has come to do a whole lot more than just talk in a tongue or make you feel accelerated or exhilarated this Holy Ghost has come to lead us and to guide us and to govern our lives and draw us closer and closer to the manifestation of the sons of God if you're with me you could squeeze out an amen this Grace governs the attitudes and actions of the believer who has learned to walk in dependence on the Holy Spirit how many of you are depending on the Holy Ghost oh for years they've come against us and said you mean to tell me you believe that somebody has to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to go in the Rapture and by the way I do believe that by the way I do believe that but here's my response to that I don't see how in the world you can go to Walmart talk about going to heaven without the Holy Ghost why the CRA iest place in all the world Walmart is crazier than a juke joint I'm being honest with you that's one of the craziest places that I have ever been and we have to go yes people have to go I don't have to go but people have to go I go maybe twice a year why you don't want to be a lot yes with all my heart I want to be a light but I have to be prayed up oh yeah because Insanity swirls around us in this old world people have lost all sense of respect and all sense of dignity come on now they don't care how they look they might just be walking around in their underwear yes they don't have to worry about security nobody's going to say anything to them about that and somebody said and I want you to know you would never understand unless you knew the the hideousness of what goes on in public places like that in the hour that we're living in right now because people are so sick they are so oppressed they are in such trouble so you pray up when you go it used to be that the the mothers used to say to me brother Shel if I've got more than two children and I take them to Walmart in the buggy it disturbs everybody in the store cuz they everybody's looking and pointing and carrying on because I've got more than two kids and that's not the norm well I want you to know you got to worry about a whole lot more than that in this hour because people have got a whole lot more things than that on their mind we need to be prayed up we need to send our families out prayed up come on now we need to pray over them when they go out and we need to pray over them when they come back because this is a critical and serious hour we're living in we are thankful for the grace of God to govern and Lead our gu our attitudes and our actions to help us to walk in dependence on the Holy Spirit and we are being led by the Lord and when he wants you into that environment you go prayed up with the whole armor of God on and you go and be ready to do what God would have you to do number two this is the one we're going to begin to look at today and then we'll finish up after camp meeting time the spirit of Supplication the spirit of Supplication are because the word intercession in Hebrew and Greek is so similar to the meaning of the word supplication I feel like we can easily use those two and even exchanging if we need to the spirit of Supplication or the spirit of intercession it executes the office of prayer that's in the life of the believer now I want you to know Holy Ghost prayer is powerful prayer the power that we have is not just power in prayer cuz we're not the only people who pray to a deity it's not just the Avenue of prayer that gives us the power but it's knowing who we're praying to and it's even allowing the Holy Ghost to pray in us and through us that makes the prayer of the believer so effective in this hour I believe in being specific in our prayer but I also believe believe in knowing from the very beginning that what you want more than anything else in all the world is for his kingdom to come and his will to be done on Earth as it is in heaven my charismatic friends would wear me into the ground praying against every fire and every storm and every volcano and every wind that blows and I don't listen brother sister I can't live that kind of Life chasing down on everything that's going on in nature come on the charismatics are somehow caught up in this idea I got to speak to this and shake my stick at that and deal with it I believe I believe that when God gives you an assignment to pray against something like that you better do it and God will honor it but if you don't have the mind of the spirit concerning a certain thing especially when it might be the judgments of God poured out upon a nation that has forsaken a living God somebody said what about innocent people I want you to know there's never been a time that judgment didn't fall that innocent people were not caught up in that kind it rains on the just and the unjust but my prayer is God be merciful and I don't ever have to worry about him answering that prayer that's right he's merciful and when people you know get get on one tangent or another here's the answer here's the answer this week I've had requests to pray against forest fires to pray against a hurricane forming in the Gulf people write out brother Shelly I know you believe in the authority of prayer would you please pray my response has to be thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven naam said God is a god of the Whirlwind I will I want you to know sometimes he uses wind and storms sometimes he uses rain sometimes he uses the elements he created the earth I know the enemy is the prince of the power of the air but anytime God wants to use what he created he has power and authority to do so he is talking I want to say to this church before we we we uh move on or finish up or whatever we do I want to say again to this church God is speaking in 2021 God is speaking somebody said the devil is howling and the Heathen are raging you are absolutely right but I want you also to know that even though the devil is howling and the Heathen are raging God is still speaking to his people and he's leading them and directing them and breaking through in their life because that's who he is it don't always look like a earth shattering Revival when God moves and speaks but I want you to know more is shifted in his voice than we can see with a natural eye God is speaking oh he is so the spirit of Supplication executes the office of prayer governing the communication between our spirit and God it's a two-way communication between him him and his sons he's called us to this it's not just us talking to him in the Spirit but it's him talking to us by the spirit how many of you know that's what communication is prayer is not a one-way Street and if you pray and say amen and jump up and you don't give God a chance to talk to your heart or to make something real to you you're missing out on the very benefit and the Very privilege of prayer maybe you've understood the responsibility of prayer but you've never understood the the great benefit of prayer the benefit of prayer is it pushes all the stuff out of you that needs to get out you are laying yourself before the Lord in humility and in honesty knowing you may lie to everybody around you but you don't lie to the Holy Ghost he already knows the truth so you just very transparently lay out who you are and what your needs are hang around a moment hang around a moment and see if God won't Quicken something to you how many of you know if you've prayed in the spirit when you get up from prayer or when you move away from prayer you are changed somebody said I didn't feel any better you didn't pray in the spirit you really going to say something like that yes I am if you have approached the Living God with sincerity and faith and you didn't feel better in the depth of who you are you didn't pray in the spirit because when we pray in the spirit when we know not let's look at that again real quick Ro Romans uh let's go back and look at our reference that we had just a moment ago Romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth I don't want to get ahead of myself but I will that word helpeth in the Greek 4878 listen to what it means it means to to join with this is the Holy Ghost joining with you in your weakness I I'm not making this up that word infirmity one of the meanings of that word infirmity is weakness in fact it refers specifically to an ailment that deprives someone of enjoying what they would like to [Music] do I'm reading that right out of the Lexicon so your infirmity it's not just your sickness your infirmity may be anything that hinders you from enjoying the benefit of who you are as a born again Holy Ghost filed child of God it might be a root of bitterness it might be a spirit of unforgiveness it may not be a physical mality something else trying to hinder you so look at what the Holy Ghost does he comes along side of us it says uh he joins in to take hold with us at the side to take a share in the Holy Ghost is taking a share in your weakness yes he's taking part of the load of your infirmity he is standing right beside you to help you get through the trial and the struggle woo I know that's so simple I don't know why it excites me so maybe that's CZ I spend a whole lot of my life praying and I need help prayer will wear you out yes prayer will wear you out why don't somebody just be real pray will wear you out sometimes I sit behind a preacher and pray and I am almost as exhausted when I get home as if I would have preached the sermon a few Sundays ago when I led the worship I went home and laid down the rest of the day because you're in a battle it is a battle when you try to do something for the kingdom of God it is a battle and it takes a physical effect on the body and prayer will wear you out body it'll wear you out mentally if you try to win the battle by yourself you'll shrink in defeat every time but if you'll allow the Holy Ghost to pray through you whether in English with understanding or whether in a tongue that you have never learned or whether in a groan or a grunt yes you say wait a minute brother Shel I can show it to you yes or a sigh oh Lord knows I do not like sighing it wears me out to be around people who sigh all the time this isn't a sighing in the natural like we have a tendency to do because we didn't suck enough oxygen this is sighing in the spirit this is have you ever been praying you run out of wind you run out of energy you run out of words let me tell you something children of God as intercessors as those who approach God in supplication we cannot lose if we learn to pray in the spirit likewise the spirit also helpeth I'm not through with the definition he joins in to help to take hold of with at the side to take a share in generally to Aid or assist to give assistance with full initiative to become closly identified with this is the spirit of almighty God that lives inside of the overcoming believer that desires to become closely identified with your weaknesses with your infirmities with your needs he's not hanging you out there somewhere to dry watching you squirm when you get in a mess he's raising up if you yield to him he's raising up I feel the holy ghost telling me to tell somebody in this church your answer will be found if you will pray in the spirit thank you Lord you are spinning your wheels in prayer because you are praying it your way thank you when we refuse to discern the mind of the spirit and we continue to pray out of our [Music] opinion or out of an old Paradigm or an old mindset prayer becomes a Geral wheel no wonder people give up on prayer no wonder you can't call people to a prayer meeting because they give out esteem praying for things that they don't even need to be praying about I listen to people's prayer requests and I think you must think now this going to sound a little rough so just buckle up and I'm loving you and I think you must think that's all anybody has time to do is pray over 11 dozen different thoughts concerning that one prayer need I I get prayer I get people send me directives with 13 ways to pray for their loved one in the hospital and I just want to say I don't because I understand unless the spirit teaches you differently you don't know better but I just want to say sometime do you want me to pray in the spirit or do you want me to pray on what you figure out is going to be the best solution come on I'm being honest I know some of you getting your feelings hurt because you asked me for prayer don't worry honey when you ask me for prayer I let the Holy Spirit do the praying because like you I have learned that he knows best [Applause] pray they put him on this drug if you have asked me to do that please forgive me for being so bold no no you really want me to pray you want us to believe that we're a book of Acts people who have all power and authority by the Holy Ghost and then you're telling me what drug you want them on oh it's going to get real quiet come on Josh help me I need some help from somebody here you see if that is your mentality you still believe that life is held in the hands of men and women I can't do that I can't do that folks you pray that way you pray that God will take them off of one drug and put them on another drug and hook them up to this and take them off of that and do the other the only prayer that I have prayed like that is I have asked the Lord to bring every one of these that we've been praying for quickly to a place where they can get off that ventilator because I know the longer they're on that ventilator the less likely they are to come off of it I am not a doctor but that is the opinion of Medical Science so I have honestly prayed that Lord whatever you need to do in that body you restore that body you heal that body you deliver in that poty so they can get off of that but I haven't prayed Lord let them uh decide to give them Ivermectin or hydroxy chloroquin or give them more Z or zinc or C or any of that kind of stuff let me tell you something if you've got time to pray like that go right ahead but the spirit of Supplication and intercession is living inside of you by the power of the Holy Ghost and if you let the Holy Ghost pray he will always pray the mind of the spirit let me say one more time I'm not just talking about praying in tongues I'll show you right in the Bible the Bible says I will pray in the spirit I will pray with understanding I will sing in the spirit I will sing with understanding it's all in the spirit it's all in the spirit you may know exactly what you're asking God you may not know a word you said what sounds to you like a grunt a groan and a sigh what sounds to you like a few loose syllables I tell you what it is it's God praying In You by the Holy Ghost somebody said you think you know what he's saying yeah I think I do sometime you know what he's saying sometime thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven Jesus wasn't just wasting A good sermon to preach on the Lord's Prayer and by the way that prayer doesn't belong to the Lord that was a gift the lord gave you that prayer that's your prayer that's not the Lord's prayer that is your prayer that is my prayer and it was given to us as an example of how we should approach him you will never go wrong by spending time acknowledging the might and the Splendor and the sovereignty and the awesomeness and the hallowed of a living God oh you'll never go wrong approaching him as your papa you'll never go wrong calling on him as your ABA as your papa as your father he is that and he has placed in you as a belie you sound like you're mad I'm sorry it's that old style I'm sorry I can't hardly help it people will sometimes ask do you really have to yell like that do you have to spit like that no if I was more talented in the natural I could just stand up here and present my lecture and it would have the same effect but since I don't have all that skill I have to depend on unction and inspiration and I have to depend on that anointing to come and sometimes I feel as dry as a board and sometimes I feel him coming so fast I can't get it all out fast enough come on and I can't judge that by whether you amen or not cuz we have some of the most fickle amen amers around here of any church I've ever been in involved with you'll come in here one service and amen and act like you've got the Victory and you're going to stand by the word and you're going to support your pastor and then you'll have three services where you won't even [Music] smile what a man ought to do what what we going to do we're going to keep on doing what we know to do we're going to keep on knocking on the door we're going to keep pushing back the forces of Darkness until deliver reaches every Pew until it reaches every family until it reaches every life because that's what we're after to see total Deliverance in every person that we love in every person that we know we want to see total Deliverance what some people call Freedom is not Freedom at all I want I want this kind of Freedom that Jesus said I want to make you I want to create you freedom I I want to place you in such a state of Liberty in such a state of freedom that nothing the enemy tries to rip you up and tie you up in tangle you up in will have any effect on you at all because you'll answer every accusation with the word of the Lord in your mouth how we how do we do that by the spirit so so please my my my uncle is in trouble he has such and such would you pray for him I want you to know something brother sister most of the time we can take that right there to God let the Holy Ghost present the need say thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven God knows every nurse listen you got to remember this God knows every doctor every nurse and every drug he knows them all he looks at most of it like sorceries anyway but I'm telling you right now he knows it all it is it he knows you don't have to tell him which one to do there's an old I tell you there's an evil oppressive spirit in this nation that wants to keep help away from people who need help that's what disturbs us that's what gets our goat but I want you to know God knows how to bypass he knows how to bypass every red tape uh uh bureaucracy politics in medical oh he knows how to bypass every bit of that by the Holy Spirit he does likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities that word infirmities is weakness and it refers to en ailment that deprives someone of enjoying what they would like to do so here comes the Holy Spirit to stand right beside you and to pray with you and to carry the burden and the infirmity and the weakness with you you are never alone I'm telling you today you are never alone when Jesus is on board when the Holy Ghost is in your life you are never alone no matter how dark or how dire the need is now we would much rather see uh people just close their eyes and go home when God is ready for them but I want you to know we don't get to choose the details there are some things that we have control over and there are some things that we don't have control over but we must understand that God is [Music] good he does not make a mistake he's talking can I say again and the time I have left he is talking when he takes somebody from this Earth he is talking when he spares somebody and leaves them here when it looks like they were going to leave this earth he is talking we don't always want to hear what he has to say but he is talking can I go ahead and break the rest of this verse down he said likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we we know not what we should pray for as we ought have you ever been there I'm so sorry to admit that I have been there more times than I would want to name there have been times that I have been on the phone praying for Brother Steve Curry and sister Anita and words just absolutely just fail me in the natural I'm honest we're so used to being able to tell God what to do there you go that's right and then all all of a sudden we get in a situation where we don't feel like we can tell him what to do or how to do and we don't hardly know what to pray yes this is what a lot of prayer is there's a lot of people that spend their entire prior life which isn't much telling God it's not about telling God it's about spread spreading your petition now when God speaks to your heart and the Holy Spirit touches God he may give you some things to decree and to declare and to announce and to prophesy and to Proclaim are you with me and you need to do that with every fiber of your being but don't do that as though you're directing God CU he knows already is there really anything you can tell him in a detail of something you know well I wish you could have heard what they said when nobody was listening I overheard the doctor say so and so and Lord I got to tell you about it don't you know the Lord heard don't you know the Lord heard let me tell you something prayer could be revolutionary for all of us we could pray the most powerful corporate prayers of any group of people on the face of the Earth if we could get some of this in our spirit when we start down this road there's too many people that say I think that's kind of making lie to prayer I think that you're so wrong you're so wrong you keep on doing it your way that is up to you but I'm telling you what the word says the word says if we will let the spirit that's why I am not going to apologize to any of you and I'm not going to apologize to message Believers around the world if you happen to tune into a service and you hear us praying for somebody in tongues I'm not going to apologize to you just want you to know that because I know there's a time when we don't know what to pray I wished I always knew what to say and what to pray but I don't always yet know what the spirit's mind is when we don't know he comes and stands beside us helping us with our weakness and with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit what's that next word itself you become a vessel yeah now I don't want you to look at this as though the Holy Ghost is doing all the praying and you're doing nothing that's not why God gave you the Holy Ghost he didn't come to do the praying for you he came to do the praying with you brother ski that's right with you that's what helpeth our infirmities means he wants to pray with you he wants you to cooperate with him in prayer are not our will for we know not what we should pray for as we ought thank you for those of you who are still with me but the spirit itself maketh intercession same word we could almost say right there supplication for us yes that word intercession means on behalf of to turn to to appeal to to intercede in the behalf of someone to plead for someone to follow someone interesting words that wasn't just Bible definitions from a Bible dictionary that was words from the Lexicon telling us what the real word intercession there means it means making an appeal laying a petition and he does that itself the spirit itself does that for us because we can't do it by ourself with groanings yes with groanings which cannot be uttered groanings that word groanings in the Greek means an involuntary expression of great concern or stress a sigh or a groan an involuntary expression of great concern turn or stress a sigh or a groan how many of you have ever had news fall on your life so D urgent so urgent so serious that all you could do was say oh God somebody said that's not a very effective prayer it is if the spirit is groaning there are times that all we can do is say Jesus I don't mean using his name like a curse word or taking his name in vain as some some slang I mean in when the when the when when you see the car leaving the road or you see a deer heading your way or you see tragedy about to fall or you're own 250 which is becoming one one of the most dangerous roads in our community because you often meet people on your side of the road and they don't even seem to know I wish somebody tell those dump trucks coming out of Sedona that they are going to have to stay in their Lane when they turn or wait until the oncoming traffic turns they don't they turn right out in front of your lane and if you're not expecting them to pull out you don't know they're pulling out they will meet you many many times on your side of the road lay down on the horn perhaps and look at you like you've lost your mind and your attitude is probably I would have yielded to you if I had known you were coming out if I have just know you were I'm not here to hinder what you're doing I just want to pass there's so much danger like that and maybe you see something like that happening and you don't have time to say now Lord what would you have me to do my granny said to me when she was leaving the Revival that I was preaching in montavo Alabama and she was coming through Montgomery and there was a whole lot going on in her life there was a whole lot going on in my life I was pastoring a church in South Carolina I'd been called down to an Assembly of God Church in monavala where we had had a glorious Revival some 10 years before and they had invited us and I told them you know we're no longer Assembly of God we're preaching a a strong Holiness message and but they invited us anyway and Grant came to the meeting and some of you met some of the folks that came out of that Revival I hear from some of them from time to time doing great things for the kingdom of God and I'm so happy that they came to the Lord in those meetings I wish they were with us I wish some of them would have come all the way with us but I'm so thankful that they're in better condition than they were in those days and Granny left and she drove that big old Lincoln Town Car through Montgomery and she was coming along that road there where the airport is on one side of the road and there was a car coming down her Road granny was already sick but we didn't know what was wrong and she was pushing through anyway she didn't go to doctors and so all we knew to do was pray and uh she saw a car coming there was nowhere to go there was a car in the other lane there was a car coming in the other uh two lanes it was a four lane there there's a little section I think where it's a four lane and she said I I only had enough time to say Lord I'm ready because she said the first thought that came to my mind was I'll never get slowed down I'll never get out of the way I don't know whether they're ready to meet you or not I know that I'm ready to go and she jerked the wheel and when she did she flipped the car in a ditch that runs along there hit a covert flipped flipped again she was a large woman it threw her out of the windshield and sat her down this is the odd thing that nobody can quite understand sat her down propped up against the passenger side we don't know if she crawled there or if the Lord put her there we don't know how it happened but she was sitting down with her back propped up against the uh passenger I'm not passenger I said passenger I meant driver driver side door she was driving alone she went out the windshield and yet when when they got there she was sitting up and had her purse which is so odd cuz the first thing my grandy did when she got in the vehicle was throw that purse in the back seat and you better not be sitting there or it would take you out cuz that purse was more like a suitcase I'll tell you that right now I mean a big one it had Pockets Galore but anyway I know of course I'd have to tote it sometimes she'd say my shoulder's hurting so bad I'd say I guess it is she'd say you're going to have to tote this a little while I said I just can't hardly do it yes you are she said I didn't have time to do anything but she said the first thought was I don't know if that person is ready to meet the Lord or not that person listen now that person didn't even stop there's no doubt in my mind they saw what happened be almost Unthinkable that that could happen happened to them not know it maybe so but they kept right on going when the do when the when the ambulance got there it had taken the flesh from her forehead and peeled it down and there was a piece of skin and flesh of her forehead about that size flapped down over her ey one eye and nose and most of the other eye and the do the the um EMT said ma'am we're going to have to put you in an ambulance she said no I don't I don't want to go to the hospital she said I don't want to go to the hospital she said I don't I try not to go to doctor she said I put my hope and my trust in the Lord and she said I try not to go to doctor he said well I sure do appreciate that ma'am but he said this time I think we're going to have to get a little help let the Lord get a little help and she said no he don't need any help but maybe I do she said would you do me a favor and he said yes ma'am she said call my grandson I'll give you his number he's holding in a Revival a couple hours up here from monavala he will pray for me and God will heal me and I won't need the ambulance she said I he he said ma'am I just can't I can call but he said how about we get you in the ambulance and we call on the way and I let your grandson pray for you and that's what they did now I want you to know something when you're in a situ I hope you never get in a situation like that but when you're in a situation and you don't know how to pray and what to pray isn't it good to know that the spirit of God in you knows the best way she just said I the only thought that come to me was I don't know if they're ready to meet the Lord and I pulled out of their way almost to her death but you know what the Lord wasn't ready for her she had three about three more years of life that he wanted her to live here on this Earth and there's no way in the world he was going to let her be taken out one minute before his plan was finished and God did heal her in a miraculous way they told her they told her one day that she had about seven places in her ribs that were broke and they felt sure that she had broke vertebrae and by the next day she lay there in that hospital I think it was Mar St Margaret or something like that Margaret's in in Montgomery and she lay there in that hospital and I was there when when they walked in and they said there are no broke ribs there are no broke vertebrae she said we did find something on the lung when we were x-raying and we want to check that out and that did end up being something pretty bad but she something she would have not known about had she not she give God praise she said Lord I want to thank you at least I know what's going on and I put my life in your hand when we don't know how to pray when we don't have time to form the words when we don't even know what to ask God to do in your own life haven't you ever been in a fix where you didn't even know what would help you I don't I know that I have a need but I don't even know what my need is I don't even know what it would take to help me but oh I feel him I feel him I feel him I feel him oh thank you Lord for the spirit of Supplication thank you for the intercession of the Holy Ghost pleading on our behalf it might be English words of wisdom it might be God directing your words it might be syllables coming out of your mouth of a language you never learned it might be a groaning sound uh it could be an involuntary expression of great concern or stress that's what the word groan there is but the spirit itself maketh intercession fors with groanings with s sounds which cannot be uttered and that word uttered is more like the word articulated it means spoken with understanding it means impossible to be expressed in ordinary words too deep to be expressed in language it can be groanings and tears and cries and sigh and even Grunts and other expressions of our heart and our spirit in prayer that are taken by the Holy Spirit and made into effectual intercession Before the Throne of God oh I want to read that to you again it's referring to groanings and tears and cries and sigh and even Grunts and other expressions of our heart and Spirits in prayer that are taken by the Holy Spirit and made formed into effectual inter ession Before the Throne of God oh what a holy ghost we have that he could take my groan or my sigh or my sound or syllables in a language that I have never learned and the Holy Ghost can form all of that that sounds like confusion to the Natural ear he can form all of that into intercession into supplication lay it right before the Throne of God and see God move are you with me yes we need to go I'm so thankful for this the Apostle Paul here isn't just talking about speaking in tongues or in an unknown language he was also referring to tears and groanings and cries and size this can include tongues I'm not ashamed of tongues and tongues is prayer and praise both prayer and praise in syllables and sounds that the speaker doesn't understand but it's made effective by the Holy Spirit coming alongside of us and helping us to pray the mind of the spirit when we don't even know our own mind the Holy Ghost in us and it goes on to say in verse 27 and searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God that word searcheth there means to diligently examine to seek to investigate the spirit of Supplication In You by the Holy Ghost investigates examines the heart to know what is the mind that word know is to perceive receive mentally seeing seeing that becomes knowing understanding and comprehension look at that he searcheth the hearts and the minds of the spirit because he maketh intercession he searcheth the hearts and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the Mind sees it understands it comprehends what is the mind that word word mind means the inner perspective the way of thinking the purpose the the innermost personal understanding this is what the Holy Spirit does he knows the perspective of God he knows the plan of God when we pray in English we pray according to what we know or if we just pray in the natural we pray according to what we know but we don't know it all I can't know five minutes into the future unless the Holy Spirit catches me up to know I don't even know what's going to happen next unless he should reveal it to me but when you pray in the spirit the spirit sees from eternity to Eternity he doesn't just see the end of this problem are you with me he didn't just see a solution for this situation he sees eternity he sees everything in order he knows exactly what the future is going to look like aren't we blessed yes aren't we blessed to have a holy ghost like this oh yes we are I'm not nearly done with this but I want to give you just a few quotations before we go I've got a lot more that I need to give you I want to talk to you about what kind of a person you are you see man is a spirit you are a spirit who has a soul that Soul connects you with the environment through your mind and your will and your emotions and you live in a body that is physical flesh you are not a soul you are not a body you are a spirit that has a soul and that lives in a body you were created in the image of God and God is a spirit he was not a soul he was not a body he was a spirit and you're created in that image image and you're placed here in this Earth with the ability through your soul to contact your Earthly and natural environment because in that soul is where the mind and the will and the emotions and the senses begin to operate again I know this will be different from some of our friends who follow the message of the hour it doesn't matter to me if you'll just exchange those words you can go right back to how you see it but I have no choice but to see it like Thessalonians says in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 let's look at that just a moment 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God I'm sorry I gave you that a little out of order and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ when we understand that we are a spirit who has a soul that lives in a body we'll understand the effectiveness and the power of praying in the spirit it takes us back to our original existence you are a not a body first you were we're not Mormon I think sometimes I know Believers I think they're really Mormon in their in their idea because they preach pretty much the pre-existence of souls Adam was not first a soul God created for him a body in the earth realm and then he breathed into him Spirit he breathed into him and because God breathed into him it he had to have something to be able to function between spirit and body and so God gave him a soul a mind a will and emotions and all these things function in such a beautiful way you didn't pre-exist as a soul you didn't pre-exist as a body your spirit is the first thing about you you may believe that that was formed on the day you were born but I don't believe that I believe if we could age our spirit our spirit would be the oldest thing about us where were you when the morning Stars worship before the throne I don't know what it looked like but all I know is God had you on his mind before the world was ever formed he created you a body in your mother's womb so that he could place that little spirit in it and it would become a living Soul there's something about understanding how we were created that helps us to understand how we're supposed to function in prayer because prayer again is not a one-way street it's two ways of communication my spirit communicating with his Spirit his Spirit communicating with my spirit it's Spirit fellowship and before we leave this world God's going to have a little bride down here who communicate one with another Spirit to Spirit instead of all the other ways we contact one another there is an invisible Union there is a Oneness that's that's coming it's in us but it has not had its total reality and function even though so many people would like to say it has but when that functions it places such a brotherly kindness in us which by the way is above godliness it places such a fraternal affection in US brother brandham refers to it often as perfect love without perfect love we can't have a body change is anybody with me and perfect love is not something that we can manufacture that's right not in our condition on this planet perfect love is only something we can be birthed into and if you know anything about birth you will understand it comes with a squeeze I don't mean to be you know too blunt but it comes with quite a contraction and there's going to be quite a contraction quite a squeeze that pushes us into that place where perfect love abounds it's going to take it for the Rapture it's going to take it for a body change we're going to have to have it I believe the more we pray in the spirit the more we allow the spirit of God to saturate Our Lives the closer we get to that moment that we can fully yield to his perfect love the love that he has for you and I is perfect may God give us the same expression let me just share one thing with you here a couple couple quotations one is from the message believing God you still here 1952 still the truth he said so therefore that's the reason said the prayer of faith shall save the sick an individual's prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much oh if you only knew that in your hand Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes I want you to read that next word anybody believe it I'd say that that's the only thing that can change everything it's prayer to a sovereign merciful yet powerful God he said it even changes everything it'll change the mind of God now you have to put that in Balance there's a balance here that's important to understand here's what brother brandham tells us in that message changes everything just lost my train of thought just a moment Hallelujah I'll just keep reading then it'll change the mind of God it did do it after death was pronounced to a man he prayed God told the prophet go back and tell him I heard him see there prayer hold on I was going to say the message that brother brandom preached does God change his mind he talks about God does not change his mind concerning his word if it's the word and the will of God by the word it will not be changed but but there are certain things that we understand that prayer is so effective that it can change timing there you go it didn't change the fact that eventually Hezekiah died but it gave him an extension on his life that's the power of praying in the mind of God in the will of God in the spirit of God you understand in the in the message let's do one one or two more in the message do you now believe he said prayer is the most powerful weapon was ever put in the hand of mankind the prayer faith shall save the sick do you believe that in the message expectation of 61 prayer is the key that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God did you know that it did do it one time and he goes on no that's the end of that one let's go to the next one expectations 61 a few days later he said so we believe that prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the care of a human being you know prayer one time changed the mind of God did you know that he said it sure did Hezekiah was told by Isaiah the prophet that he was going to die on that bed and Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly and asked the Lord for 15 more years of life and God sent the prophet right back and said I've heard and he was spared for the time see when God had already announced his death but he spared him because that he prayed oh my so if prayer is that powerful what can it do by we don't realize how great it is I'm telling you when you pray in the spirit it can change everything let's stand let's stand today let's have the musicians to come back I think we barely scratched the surface but I I don't want us to uh get to a place where we can't follow along anymore and I'm wearing you out and I don't want to do that I'm so thankful that God has given us the wonderful wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost I'm thankful that prayer is such a powerful weapon but when we pray in the spirit when the spirit of Supplication when the spirit of intercession moves through the Believer by the Holy Ghost I tell you it's the most powerful weapon on the earth aren't you kind of a excited to think that God has placed that powerful of a weapon in your life how many of you feel excited that God has placed that in you I don't feel your excitement right yet but how many of you are glad God placed that right on the inside of you hallelujah thank you for it I want to sing power in prayer sing this with me in worship we're going to Worship the Lord As we sing this and then Ben you can lead us in a worship song but I like this song so much I don't know what key there's power in prayer power to spare and all that you ever need is waiting right there just a few words little child's Faith then it's good by despair oh there's power so much power there's power in prayer oh there's power in prayer power to spare and all that you'll ever need is waiting right there oh just a few words with little child's Faith it's goodbye despair oh there's power so much power there's power in prayer give me a verse would you a bed holds a body that is pero with pain and the doctors have tried but all hope is in vain oh but wait there's someone praying in the midst of the gloom and all at once that great physician he steps into the room how many of you have known him to do it there's power in prayer there's power to spare and and all that you will ever need is waiting right there there's just a few words with little child's faith and it's goodbye despair oh there's power so much power there's power in prayer somewhere somebody is praying tonight for a loved one who has wandered away from the light oh and Faith reaches heaven and God isw and forever is changed in one moment of prayer oh there's power yes there's [Music] power it's waiting right there oh just a few words little child's Faith it's Goodbye despare Oh there's power so much power there's power in prayer Lord we thank you we thank you for giving us prayer it's an Avenue it's a vehicle that you have chosen you speak about the foolishness of preaching and to so many out there prayer seems like foolishness but to the believer it's a gift it causes us to focus our faith on the only one who holds the supply there is not a need in this room or Beyond too big too serious too desperate for the Living God Lord I'm so thankful that you've given us away especially by the spirit of Supplication and intercession that we just open up our hearts and let the spirit of God lead us and direct us in our prayer praying through US sometimes in English sometimes with groanings that cannot be uttered with understanding but when we're finished we know that you've heard and we walk away with expectation this is who you are Lord in a world that's so dark and desperate I am so thankful that you have given us prayer it's the greatest stress relever it's the great greatest anxiety Buster that anybody could have is the grace to be able to lay all of your burdens and all of your cares on the Lord and Lord this is what you have invited us to do and we pray praise you we praise you for the gift lead us Ben lead us in something worshipful this morning let's seal this moment in by thanking God for every good thing that he does in our lives praise the Lord

like for God to do something for you personally and yet there are others coming some from our local community and some driving along ways to get here we want the Lord to just anoint every part of it

God bless [Music] you you may slip back toward your seat just another announcement or two and we're gone we know that we've gone a little over you can be seated just a moment if you like and you've been standing now so [Music] long I don't know who to thank I know that Nathan for sure had a lot to do with it who are you pointing to Luke was he behind a lot of it thank you so much Luke yic and whoever else helped I was so happy it meant so much to me I wasn't here yesterday I didn't know what had been done I think I saw I think I saw where Nathan was clipping or mowing or something we were concerned about the weather the mud the rain the I don't know how they did what they did in the days that they did it but did you all notice when you came on how nice it looked the sign at the front is washed cleaned and shiny and ready I want to thank every one of you so much thank you so much I know that it wasn't easy to get it done in the time that you had to do it but I know that God will bless you for it I know you did it as unto the Lord we are expecting God to move Among Us in Great and Mighty ways now I spoke with brother Elum this week and he is unable to give me a definite number and I told him that we will be flexible the best we can be because we're so delighted to have so many of them coming to worship with us they may not all be here uh at the the same time or come at the same time but by the weekend by probably Friday Saturday Sunday they will all be here and he went down the list of how many couples and how many uh young married young unmarried teenager so to speak and then children and the best number that we can come up with is between 22 and 30 now that's just going to be wonderful amen we need that extra support and we're expecting the Lord to do now we don't have uh lodging arranged for them just yet but we know that some have said I could take two ladies or I could take two young girls or I could do um they would be so happy to be in homes this is their way of doing things but they understand our situation we have a lot of men who are working during the day and not a lot of extra room in their homes EX Etc and so we have been able to uh put them in uh hotel rooms the time the two times that they have visited and the Lord has made the way and I want to present to you that uh some of them we will have to do the same it's kind of hard to book rooms because we don't know what day which ones will come and how many there will be and how many rooms we'll need on any particular night but I'm expecting to get a final report from him on on Tuesday and hopefully that will give us enough time if not and we're at the last minute unable they're kind of holding some rooms if at the last minute that doesn't work out will you just bring some empty seats in your car uh Tuesday I mean Wednesday and Thursday and Friday night and we may just send some folks home with you on pallets sounded like I was really preaching hard didn't it how that's how quiet it gets when I'm really dealing with something no I mean we were going to we're going to have to make a way and God Will Make A Way don't don't worry about that if you can help in any way uh then please let us know what you can do and if you can't do anything physically you can give extra in the offering so that the the bills are met and we can provide food for them and uh we we're just blessed this is for me fulfillment of a longtime dream God gave me a vision two visions and a dream many years ago concerning a Ministry uh to Amish people and I saw these people on the video first and when they were out in Tucson I met them in Tucson first and they're just our precious brothers and sisters they have a heart for the plain people they have a heart for those that they are uh in fellow fellowship with and related to all over the United States and God is using them they're going out they're ministering in other groups things are taking place I want us to be a part of that we had not had them in our service until last camp meeting that was the first time I have to honestly say I expected them to come in and be rather quiet but I was surely wrong because one or two of those Brothers danced until they could hardly stand up and you know that was just right for me that just that settled everything for me we've had the the last group that came on the van we had them in our home eating and we had the most wonderful Fellowship oh my wonderful Fellowship so uh and there will be others we have some friends coming from Tucson and different places so anything you can do if you can't do anything physic basically provide a meal or home then just continue to sew real big into the offering so that when camp meeting is over there are no extra expenses left on us because we have other obligations I believe the Lord is going to do great things amen so uh be as hospitable to visitors as you possibly can love them get to know them ask them who they are you don't have to interview them about Seven Seals and things like that but just welcome them and tell them how how glad we are to have them with us Sunday let's bring a real big picnic and let's have lunch together on the grounds and fellowship H if we have to have a not have to like it's a chore if there's a need to have another baptism then we can get that taken care of as well uh next Sunday afternoon but uh pray pray pray there will be no service here Tuesday night but we will come Wednesday night at 7:00 there will be no service the following Tuesday night so we are off for two Tuesday nights but we are here Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday does anyone have a question wonderful then all hearts and minds are clear is that right are you clear Zachary you're clear mhm want to make sure you know what uh God has been so good to Elizabeth and Zachary and he blessed them with t Talia and uh she can be a challenge but she has got a way that will abs absolutely melt your heart I think it is spiritual but in the natural Papa I think it has something to do with those curls we have had many people including sweetheart wasn't it the Amish people too that said something about tally one of the brothers said I don't know who that little girl was but there's something very very special about her we're so thankful for her and then uh Zach and Liz gave us something that we wanted for so long and that was a baby boy because we were beginning to be very concerned about all the baby girls with no baby boys to Mary we were getting very concerned about it and God gave them uh a pretty special one when he gave them Ezekiel Joseph that's right isn't it and so we went away with them just a few weeks after the baby was born and it was the best time away I think that I have ever had because I sat under a tent listened to the waves and had a brand new baby boy asleep on my chest every day we were gone and something about that kind of made me feel you know connected to him and I love it when he pulls away from somebody else to come to me and he does all the time just want you to know now we have to open our hearts a little bigger because we are expecting well I'm not particularly but because Elizabeth and Zachary are expecting another baby let's congratulate [Music] them wonderful thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven how many of you just agree it must be God's will for another boy Papa and me we're on this thing we're agreeing we they're going to love that child regardless and we are too aren't we happy for them you are dismissed we've prayed we've sung we've worshiped we've heard the word we've made announcements and now we are going to dismiss you in the wonderful name of the Lord God bless you listen camp meeting is an important time don't stay home don't stay home and stream that's not right get here even if it's hard even if you're a minute or two late late come on and let's add everything we've got to the services amen God bless you as you as you leave let's just sing God is so good as the people are going out and do your fellowshipping out in the vestibule please but go in his name God is so good God is so good oh God is so good he's so good to me I love him so and I I love him so I I love him so oh I love him so [Music] he [Music]
