[1:02:14] like
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:28] it doesn't take very long to figure
[1:02:32] out why that Elisha called for a
[1:02:38] Minstrel when he was irritated and
[1:02:41] agitated because of a couple of kings
[1:02:44] that came before him that he really
[1:02:45] didn't want to talk
[1:02:48] to but they needed a word from the Lord
[1:02:51] and his Spirit was already agitated
[1:02:54] because of who was standing in front of
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:57] but when the atmosphere got
[1:03:03] right true you don't think the piano
[1:03:06] makes a
[1:03:07] difference you don't think the drums
[1:03:09] make a
[1:03:12] difference the bass
[1:03:15] guitar your
[1:03:17] voice changes the frequency of the
[1:03:21] atmosphere lifts you up into a realm
[1:03:24] that you did not know
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:39] the right
[1:03:41] song with the right
[1:03:44] words with the right
[1:03:47] Melody with the correct
[1:03:51] singer changes the atmosphere
[1:03:57] and it can lift
[1:04:03] you if you let it change your
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:10] atmosphere there can be 120 people
[1:04:13] sitting in this
[1:04:16] room and a hundred of them look like
[1:04:20] that they've been caught up because they
[1:04:23] allowed their atmosphere
[1:04:26] to be
[1:04:28] changed and 20 it looks like that they
[1:04:31] lost their best
[1:04:33] friend because they didn't allow it to
[1:04:35] change their
[1:04:37] atmosphere they didn't press in they
[1:04:40] didn't allow the Lord to let the
[1:04:44] atmosphere around them
[1:04:48] change because they wanted to hold on to
[1:04:51] what they had
[1:04:56] but we can have the
[1:04:59] change that we need in our
[1:05:02] lives but it is Our
[1:05:05] obligation to allow the spirit of God to
[1:05:10] water the

[1:21:14] that right happy birthday sister Teresa
[1:21:17] God bless
[1:21:22] you I have to be hon honest I didn't get
[1:21:25] my birthdays together today I I glanced
[1:21:28] on the phone just a moment ago I didn't
[1:21:31] write them all down it's on me I was
[1:21:33] slack I had some other things going on
[1:21:35] in my mind this morning and I didn't get
[1:21:37] that done uh if you have a birthday this
[1:21:39] week let me see your hand anybody else I
[1:21:43] didn't see too much when I glanced on
[1:21:45] the calendar does anybody know of
[1:21:48] somebody uh brother and sister West uh
[1:21:52] their wedding anniversary is this week
[1:21:55] and is it I don't know if it's Tuesday
[1:21:57] or Wednesday it's the 7th and today's
[1:22:00] what the 5th so today is a six so that'd
[1:22:03] be tomorrow I know that brother West is
[1:22:06] not here but I know that that day is a
[1:22:08] is a special day and a hard day so I
[1:22:11] want you to know we're going to be
[1:22:12] praying for you when I think when when I
[1:22:16] hear this uh total
[1:22:18] announced weekly I I can see him I see
[1:22:23] him he's so so vivid in my mind's eye
[1:22:27] that
[1:22:28] grin that real smile that he would have
[1:22:31] he would be through the moon to know
[1:22:35] that we were almost
[1:22:38] finished I remember when he said to me
[1:22:41] finally he said brother shell I don't
[1:22:42] want to let you down in any
[1:22:44] way but he said I'm getting old now and
[1:22:48] he said I think you might ought to get
[1:22:50] somebody else to sign on the loan with
[1:22:52] you this time he said you don't ever
[1:22:54] know
[1:22:56] you just don't ever know when it when it
[1:22:58] would be and that was hard that was so
[1:23:02] hard for me because he went with me in
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:07] beginning and signed my credit was
[1:23:11] nothing I didn't have any credit much
[1:23:14] and I had way more debt than I had
[1:23:18] income and uh it all really hung on him
[1:23:21] my name was on there but it was years
[1:23:24] before I had anything they could have
[1:23:27] took but he was uh
[1:23:30] so sure that this was God's church and
[1:23:34] this was God's Will and that it was
[1:23:38] going to be what God had intended it to
[1:23:40] be that he hung everything he owned on
[1:23:43] this
[1:23:44] property and God made a way and we were
[1:23:48] able to
[1:23:50] continue I just know that he would be
[1:23:52] happy and I want I want us to always
[1:23:54] always remember those years of faithful
[1:23:57] service that he gave us and the burden
[1:23:59] that he carried and uh you know he could
[1:24:02] be corrective at times but we needed
[1:24:05] correction he could also be one of the
[1:24:08] funniest men that ever
[1:24:10] lived I don't know if he was
[1:24:12] particularly funny or if it was just fun
[1:24:14] laughing at him I I I don't know if it
[1:24:16] was his jokes or just the way he did his
[1:24:20] his way but we give him honor I want to
[1:24:23] honor him today and every time sister
[1:24:25] West is able to come it it touches me in
[1:24:29] such a deep place because they have been
[1:24:32] so
[1:24:33] faithful let's give thanks today for
[1:24:35] brother and sister
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:46] West well I didn't mean to get quite so
[1:24:49] carried
[1:24:51] away uh let's see
[1:24:54] 66
[1:24:55] 6768 so this would have been 68 years
[1:25:00] I've got I think I've got it right I
[1:25:02] think this would have been 68 years of
[1:25:04] marriage I tell you what that's a lot of
[1:25:07] years and that's worth mentioning
[1:25:10] Jonathan come you didn't know it but I
[1:25:12] want you to play for me and sing with me
[1:25:14] this song we had more songs this morning
[1:25:17] than we could get in but we haven't
[1:25:19] heard from you and if you would rather
[1:25:21] sing one by yourself you certainly can
[1:25:26] but I'll make it sound a whole lot
[1:25:28] better if you let me add it
[1:25:33] too what are we just going to have a
[1:25:35] sing Oh

[1:25:49] do
[1:25:51] you you want to give sister West to Mike

[1:34:24] celebrating your granddad's 90th
[1:34:27] birthday and he's an old soldier of this
[1:34:31] message and uh when we told the story
[1:34:34] when when Jenna's parents were here some
[1:34:37] years back but in that tape where
[1:34:40] brother brandham saw the pillar of fire
[1:34:43] and there was a wall if you know
[1:34:45] anything about the Tabernacle the window
[1:34:48] into the nursery was on the other side
[1:34:49] of the wall so he wasn't looking through
[1:34:52] a window he was looking through a wall
[1:34:54] in the spirit and he said I just saw
[1:34:57] that Pillar of Fire moving into the
[1:35:00] nursery there and it's hanging over a
[1:35:03] woman's head uh uh and he called her did
[1:35:08] he call her by her husband's name he
[1:35:10] didn't say he didn't say oh no he said
[1:35:12] Mrs Ivonne West is that what he said I I
[1:35:15] couldn't remember if he said Mrs David
[1:35:17] West meaning the wife of but it was Mrs
[1:35:20] Ivon West and I was telling brother Tim
[1:35:25] uh Siler Jenna's dad that story when
[1:35:28] they came here to visit and he got all
[1:35:31] excited and he said I got to call my
[1:35:33] mother in the morning because he said
[1:35:35] I've heard this story my whole life and
[1:35:37] he called his mother and came in here
[1:35:39] that Sunday morning and told us he said
[1:35:41] I've heard that my mother was in the
[1:35:43] nursery and she was standing next to
[1:35:46] Sister Ivon West and she felt that
[1:35:49] presence when it come over her head
[1:35:54] what a small
[1:35:56] world and uh so brother Siler was on his
[1:35:59] way to amarilla when the when the
[1:36:02] highway patrolman stopped him when they
[1:36:04] heard that brother brandom had passed or
[1:36:06] had been in the accident he was he got
[1:36:08] in the car and started driving straight
[1:36:10] he said I don't know what I was going to
[1:36:12] do but I was going to get there one way
[1:36:13] or the other and he started driving
[1:36:15] straight to amarilla and the highway
[1:36:18] patrolman stopped him and said there's a
[1:36:20] call on the radio from your wife and
[1:36:23] they were able he was able to get in
[1:36:24] touch with him and tell him that brother
[1:36:26] brandom had passed away and and when he
[1:36:29] describes that moment of not knowing
[1:36:31] what the future holds I'm so glad
[1:36:34] tonight that we're not hanging on one
[1:36:36] man anymore we don't have to worry you
[1:36:39] don't have to worry if something should
[1:36:42] happen to me you don't have anything to
[1:36:44] worry about you've got the one with you
[1:36:47] that'll take you
[1:36:48] all the way he never leaves his children
[1:36:53] without something to help them and lead
[1:36:55] them and direct them but but he said he
[1:36:57] just he said I just could hardly drive
[1:36:59] through the tears because we just didn't
[1:37:01] know well it must have turned out all
[1:37:04] right he's 90 years old and still
[1:37:06] talking of the testimonies of what God
[1:37:08] did so that's where they are would you
[1:37:10] give thanks for our
[1:37:13] musicians for the worship

[1:37:25] them I miss my son I miss my
[1:37:27] daughter-in-law uh but we didn't miss a

[1:37:34] mighty way today and these special songs
[1:37:37] that were sung and it just just so

[1:37:50] let's go this morning back to Hebrews if
[1:37:53] if you will and uh may God give us some
[1:37:56] time in his word today and uh we have
[1:38:00] the doors of the sanctuary closed
[1:38:03] because someone is cooking uh in a crock
[1:38:06] pot or something in the in the blue room
[1:38:09] there and uh whoever it is they're like
[1:38:11] me they like onions oh they must really
[1:38:13] love onions because that smell begin to
[1:38:16] permeate through the sanctuary so they
[1:38:19] uh in the back there so they close the
[1:38:21] doors one of these days
[1:38:24] however God chooses to make it happen
[1:38:27] one of these days we're going to have a
[1:38:29] nice place where they can bring their
[1:38:31] stuff and sit it out on a counter in a
[1:38:33] fellowship hall and we won't have to
[1:38:36] blow the circuits here heating up all
[1:38:38] the food in crockpots down the hall I
[1:38:41] come in last night there's crockpots all
[1:38:43] the way down the hall in the back and
[1:38:45] one of these days the Lord will surely
[1:38:47] bless us but we couldn't even consider
[1:38:49] that with all that hanging on us but God
[1:38:52] is certainly getting that out of the way
[1:38:54] there's a vision that yet has to be
[1:38:56] completed and God is counting on us to
[1:38:59] do it so there there's a there's a
[1:39:01] bright future if he terries and one day
[1:39:04] it'll be more comfortable no more tents
[1:39:07] no more stepping through the grass and
[1:39:09] stumbling on the uneven ground and and
[1:39:12] sweating like mules like we had to
[1:39:14] yesterday one day God Will Make A Way I
[1:39:17] believe that Hebrews chapter 4 beginning
[1:39:20] in verse
[1:39:21] 11 let US
[1:39:25] Labor therefore to enter into that
[1:39:32] rest lest any man
[1:39:35] fall after the same example of
[1:39:40] unbelief for the word of God is
[1:39:44] quick and powerful and
[1:39:48] sharper than any two-edged
[1:39:52] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:39:56] aunder of Soul and Spirit and of the
[1:40:01] joints and Marrow and is a
[1:40:05] discerner of the thoughts and
[1:40:09] intense of the heart do you believe that
[1:40:14] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:40:16] his word you may be seated come on David
[1:40:19] and take your position
[1:40:28] David is going to read that for you in
[1:40:30] the Amplified again I want you to get it
[1:40:33] I want you to remember it he's going to
[1:40:36] read it
[1:40:37] again uh in the Amplified and he is
[1:40:40] going to uh pause and he's going to do
[1:40:44] it with great
[1:40:47] enthusiasm I meant to say that we want
[1:40:50] to we want to make sure that there's not
[1:40:52] a lot of gathering we I don't like to
[1:40:54] close those doors because when we do
[1:40:57] there's more Gathering that goes on out
[1:40:59] in the in the vestibule and uh I don't
[1:41:01] want that I don't want there to be a lot
[1:41:03] of gathering going on out there and so
[1:41:06] uh I'm going to ask some of the brothers
[1:41:07] to kind of keep an eye on that if you're
[1:41:10] out there the couch is not a place for
[1:41:12] you to sit unless you're deathly ill and
[1:41:15] I don't know if that's where I'd want to
[1:41:16] be if I was deathly ill I think I'd want
[1:41:18] to be in here where the atmosphere was
[1:41:21] just right okay David
[1:41:24] uh Hebrews 4: 11 and 12 in the Amplified
[1:41:27] come on let us therefore be zealous and
[1:41:31] exert ourselves and strive diligently to
[1:41:34] enter that rest of God to know and
[1:41:38] experience it for ourselves yes that no
[1:41:42] one may fall or perish by the same kind
[1:41:45] of unbelief and Disobedience into which
[1:41:49] those in the wilderness
[1:41:50] fail now you know that is serious isn't
[1:41:53] it next verse for the word that God
[1:41:57] speaks is alive and full of power making
[1:42:00] it active operative hello energizing and
[1:42:05] effective making it what active
[1:42:10] operative energizing and
[1:42:13] effective it is sharper than any two Ed
[1:42:17] sword penetrating to the dividing line
[1:42:20] of the Breath of Life Soul and the
[1:42:23] Immortal spirit and of joints and Marrow
[1:42:27] of the deepest parts of our nature
[1:42:30] exposing exposing and sifting sifting
[1:42:34] and analyzing analyzing and judging and
[1:42:37] judging the very thoughts and purposes
[1:42:41] of the heart now now what are we talking
[1:42:44] about we're talking about the word of
[1:42:47] God it has the ability to do all of
[1:42:50] those things now now d Avid I want us to
[1:42:54] go back to where we were last night when
[1:42:55] we left off and I want you to read
[1:42:59] Genesis 3 verses 1
[1:43:07] through3 now the serpent was more subtle
[1:43:11] than any beast of the field which the
[1:43:13] Lord God had made right that's right and
[1:43:15] he said unto the woman yay hath God said
[1:43:19] ye shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:43:22] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:43:24] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:43:27] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[1:43:30] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:43:32] garden God hath said ye shall not e eat
[1:43:36] of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye
[1:43:40] die is that all of it now read four and
[1:43:44] five for
[1:43:45] us and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:43:48] ye shall not surely die for God doth
[1:43:51] know that in the day ye eat thereof then
[1:43:54] your eyes shall be open and ye shall be
[1:43:56] as Gods knowing good and evil how many
[1:43:58] of you can quickly recognize that
[1:44:01] twisting of God's word so we discovered
[1:44:05] last night that the serpent sowed a seed
[1:44:09] of resentment into Eve by lying to her
[1:44:14] about God's motives if the enemy can
[1:44:17] cause you and I to doubt the motive of
[1:44:20] God why would he allow such thing is
[1:44:23] that if we begin to doubt and judge his
[1:44:27] purpose and his motive and try to figure
[1:44:29] it out then we cut ourselves off from
[1:44:32] fellowship with him this word that the
[1:44:36] serpent sowed it it incited Eve's
[1:44:40] emotions now I want you to know that we
[1:44:42] teach that there was a physical act that
[1:44:48] followed but I want you to know it
[1:44:51] wasn't a physical act and then the
[1:44:53] sewing of a seed of
[1:44:55] discrepancy it was a mental thing before
[1:44:58] it became a physical thing it was an
[1:45:01] emotional thing before it came became a
[1:45:03] physical
[1:45:04] thing and uh that is what we should
[1:45:10] emphasize because we know that that
[1:45:13] physical thing is not likely to repeat
[1:45:16] itself but the enemy continues to seow
[1:45:20] his seed of discrepancy which can be
[1:45:23] resentment or unforgiveness or twisting
[1:45:27] the word just a little bit to suit our
[1:45:29] own needs he continues to do that I
[1:45:32] would not I wouldn't just say on a
[1:45:34] regular basis I would say on a daily
[1:45:37] basis he desires to insert that so I
[1:45:40] think that sometimes followers of this
[1:45:43] ministry and message have really done a
[1:45:47] a disservice to the truth that God has
[1:45:50] revealed to us by constantly harping on
[1:45:53] the physical
[1:45:55] act I am not denying a physical
[1:45:58] transaction took place not denying it at
[1:46:01] all it's the only explanation that we
[1:46:04] have why it had to be
[1:46:07] blood it had to be blood why did it have
[1:46:10] to be blood because it was an exchange
[1:46:12] of blood that started the whole
[1:46:15] fall and so it had to be blood to redeem
[1:46:18] us back to our original state the only
[1:46:22] only reason the only explanation that we
[1:46:25] can have scripturally for the fact that
[1:46:27] it had to be blood was to be able to
[1:46:29] look there and see that there was a
[1:46:31] physical transaction or a physical
[1:46:33] contact that took place there in the
[1:46:35] garden and and message people they just
[1:46:38] love it I don't know why they love it
[1:46:40] they're Billboards you know the voice of
[1:46:43] God was was selling these Billboards and
[1:46:45] bumpers Dicker you think I'm going to
[1:46:47] put a bumper sticker on the back of my
[1:46:49] car that advertises Original Sin
[1:46:54] do you really think that's how we're
[1:46:55] going to reach the
[1:46:57] lost by blowing their
[1:47:00] minds don't you think that God has given
[1:47:03] us a truth and it's precious and I want
[1:47:05] to tell you something it's
[1:47:07] right you're way too late to give me
[1:47:10] your
[1:47:11] version just so you know you're way too
[1:47:14] late to give me your version they've
[1:47:17] tried it in this church before and I
[1:47:19] don't buy
[1:47:20] it I know what happened there
[1:47:23] but I'm not going to put a bumper
[1:47:25] sticker on there and I don't have to go
[1:47:26] around telling people all the time that
[1:47:28] it wasn't an apple it wasn't an apple
[1:47:30] because that's a one-time deal it's
[1:47:34] important to know because by knowing
[1:47:36] that we understand the
[1:47:38] bloodline and it reveals to us the trail
[1:47:42] of the serpent that goes all the way
[1:47:44] through the scripture to the hour that
[1:47:45] we're living in today but what we need
[1:47:48] to be aware of is not that physical act
[1:47:51] what we need to be aware of aware of is
[1:47:54] how the enemy is constantly trying to
[1:47:56] inject
[1:47:57] us you know that's what a snake does he
[1:48:01] likes to stick his fangs in you and
[1:48:05] empty come on that Venom that's why they
[1:48:10] tell me I'm not a snake expert and and
[1:48:12] he's not here Brother David but the
[1:48:14] brother is maybe he can tell us
[1:48:15] something about it I don't know a whole
[1:48:17] lot about it I'm not going to study
[1:48:20] it I'm not going to study it and I'm not
[1:48:22] going live with them in my house I can
[1:48:24] tell you that right now you're better
[1:48:25] people than I am much better if they're
[1:48:28] in there I don't know
[1:48:32] it and you better hope they don't show
[1:48:35] up cuz if they do I ain't going to find
[1:48:38] out I'm not going to interview it and
[1:48:39] ask it what kind it is I can tell you
[1:48:42] what kind it's going to be when we get
[1:48:44] through with it
[1:48:47] dead every one of them remind me of the
[1:48:51] garden I can't help myself they'll tell
[1:48:54] you I go wild on
[1:48:58] them I've had my own kid say it's dad
[1:49:03] daddy all the Revenge of the Fall just
[1:49:06] gets on me
[1:49:08] somehow I'm going to finish it it it
[1:49:12] they tell me that a baby a baby snake it
[1:49:16] can be more dangerous than a big one
[1:49:18] because that little baby hadn't learned
[1:49:20] how not to insert and and get rid of
[1:49:22] everything it has it just gives you the
[1:49:24] full load of Venom a and that's just
[1:49:27] like that load down devil he he waits
[1:49:31] until somebody gets
[1:49:34] weak he waits till somebody has broken
[1:49:37] fellowship with the
[1:49:39] body and then he comes in with a with a
[1:49:42] full
[1:49:43] load ain't that right of his Venom and
[1:49:47] he doesn't turn you loose until you have
[1:49:50] swallowed his lies so that's why we have
[1:49:53] to constantly be vigilant and we have to
[1:49:56] Be watchful and we have to be prayed
[1:49:58] through and we have to stay in the
[1:50:01] atmosphere that brother gy was talking
[1:50:03] about today so that our emotions don't
[1:50:06] lead us away from the word they will if
[1:50:09] you've got unsanctified emotions and all
[1:50:11] of us do they will always lead us away
[1:50:15] from the word and we have to watch that
[1:50:17] I mean we have to watch that and so that
[1:50:21] that once once the serpent now remember
[1:50:24] that was Satan who entered into a beast
[1:50:26] that had already been created and uh it
[1:50:29] didn't slide around on his belly we we
[1:50:32] don't find it acting like that at all we
[1:50:34] find out that it was made very similar
[1:50:36] to a man evidently so much so that the
[1:50:40] seeds could be mixed which means
[1:50:43] genetically there had to be a tremendous
[1:50:45] amount of similarity there but what we
[1:50:47] saw after the fall was a curse of God
[1:50:50] come on that that Beast because because
[1:50:52] it had yielded itself to Satan and when
[1:50:55] God cursed it he said you're going to
[1:50:57] eat dust
[1:50:59] forever you you're going to be on your
[1:51:01] belly forever and ever and ever which
[1:51:03] leads me to believe it walked upright
[1:51:05] until that curse took place and if
[1:51:08] you've ever
[1:51:09] believed that Eve you that little
[1:51:11] picture in your children's Bible come on
[1:51:13] now yeah of Eve standing there talking
[1:51:16] to a rattlesnake in a tree I have never
[1:51:19] met the woman yet
[1:51:24] I know one thing I
[1:51:26] ain't you will never find me leaned up
[1:51:29] against a tree naked first of
[1:51:32] all and second of
[1:51:37] all did I just say
[1:51:44] that you're never going to
[1:51:47] find you're never going to find me
[1:51:49] propped up against a tree talking to a
[1:51:51] rattlesnake
[1:51:54] no wonder they try to sell that to
[1:51:56] Children only a child would believe
[1:51:58] something so simple much more than that
[1:52:02] on an attractive creature you ever seen
[1:52:04] an attractive
[1:52:05] rattlesnake an attractive creature so
[1:52:08] much so that that Eve decided I'm going
[1:52:11] to have a conversation with this
[1:52:13] Beast
[1:52:15] amen and what he did was he appealed to
[1:52:18] her human
[1:52:20] emotion and uh it caused her to be
[1:52:24] poisoned with
[1:52:26] distrust of her Creator I want to tell
[1:52:29] you one of the most important things
[1:52:31] that you can cultivate in your
[1:52:32] relationship with God is
[1:52:35] trust sir I'm already
[1:52:38] preaching if we can learn to trust him
[1:52:40] and folks has he ever given us a reason
[1:52:42] not to trust him then why in our human
[1:52:45] element do we struggle so to believe
[1:52:47] that he always has our best in mind he
[1:52:49] constantly has our best in mind whether
[1:52:52] it looks like it or not you ready David
[1:52:55] Genesis 3:
[1:52:58] 6 and when the woman saw that the tree
[1:53:02] was good for food and that it was
[1:53:04] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:53:07] desired to make one wise she took of the
[1:53:10] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[1:53:13] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[1:53:16] you see the serpent began his assault on
[1:53:19] the human Mind by injecting it with that
[1:53:22] out Satan gained his way in by touching
[1:53:27] the carnality of Eve by using her
[1:53:30] Earthly nature to do so he inserted the
[1:53:34] seed of discrepancy and he then had a
[1:53:37] Channel with which to give her knowledge
[1:53:40] obtained in an illegal way and the fruit
[1:53:44] which was the price to pay of that
[1:53:46] excess was death I want you to know that
[1:53:48] was the most expensive exchange that had
[1:53:51] ever taken place
[1:53:52] because by believing that lie and
[1:53:55] yielding her mind and body to that lie
[1:54:00] death entered into the picture we know
[1:54:03] that it death was not a part of God's
[1:54:05] original plan for Adam and Eve are you
[1:54:08] with me that was not how it was to be
[1:54:10] but he allowed this because by allowing
[1:54:15] this to transpire he would be able to
[1:54:17] come and redeem All
[1:54:20] Mankind and so it was a part part of the
[1:54:23] Redemption plan but originally Adam was
[1:54:25] made the prophet even tells us that Adam
[1:54:29] was made to never die but because this
[1:54:32] seed of discrepancy was injected death
[1:54:36] gained access to the sons of God now he
[1:54:40] would always have something in her from
[1:54:43] that moment on there would always be a
[1:54:46] representation of that lie that Eve
[1:54:49] carried around in her and see she didn't
[1:54:52] know full Redemption like you do did you
[1:54:55] are you with me did you know that full
[1:54:58] Redemption is possible today so that
[1:55:01] when Satan comes to try to find an
[1:55:03] access point in your life there is none
[1:55:06] that's right how many of you want to
[1:55:08] live under the fullness of
[1:55:10] redemption we're not living there fully
[1:55:13] like we need to because all the enemy
[1:55:15] has to do is March up and we and he
[1:55:17] knows the place he knows our weakness he
[1:55:21] knows our V vulnerability he knows where
[1:55:24] we doubt he knows where we struggle he
[1:55:27] knows what emotion to play on you know
[1:55:30] our Lord I love this verse it's in John
[1:55:33] 14:30 David's going to read it for us
[1:55:36] John 14:30 this is red letter Jesus
[1:55:39] talking Hereafter I will not talk much
[1:55:43] with you for the prince of this world
[1:55:45] cometh and ha nothing in me this is
[1:55:48] Jesus telling them I'm I'm not going to
[1:55:50] be doing as much talking and teaching as
[1:55:53] I have done in the past because that
[1:55:56] Prince of death the prince of this world
[1:56:00] is coming and when he comes he's not
[1:56:03] going to find anything in me that he can
[1:56:07] use this is Jesus talking he's not going
[1:56:11] to find any access point I'm shutting
[1:56:14] myself in and I'm going to make sure
[1:56:17] that there's no way listen you and I
[1:56:19] ought to rejoice when we read that verse
[1:56:22] of scripture we really ought to shout
[1:56:25] because if the enemy could have come in
[1:56:27] and placed a seed of discrepancy in our
[1:56:29] Lord we would have been in trouble but
[1:56:33] Jesus had confidence in the word that he
[1:56:36] was and he knew that Satan was coming
[1:56:39] and he knew that when Satan got there it
[1:56:41] wasn't going to be man to meet him it
[1:56:43] was going to be God the word to meet him
[1:56:46] and the word will shut down the devil
[1:56:49] any time of the day the word will shut
[1:56:52] down the devil even in the Midnight Hour
[1:56:56] anytime anywhere under any condition the
[1:56:59] word will shut down the LIE of the devil
[1:57:03] if you believe that say Amen so Satan
[1:57:06] failed in his temptation of Jesus you
[1:57:09] see that whole Temptation scenario that
[1:57:12] we read about in the Bible was Satan's
[1:57:15] attempt to leave a little hook in the
[1:57:19] Lord because he knew the day was coming
[1:57:21] that he was coming for his
[1:57:24] body and he was hoping that when he
[1:57:26] approached him in the last hours of his
[1:57:28] life that there would be a little hook
[1:57:30] remaining in there you go back and read
[1:57:33] that story this week and you'll find the
[1:57:35] areas that Satan was using to try to
[1:57:38] appeal to the Lord and try to tempt him
[1:57:40] to do this or to do that or to do the
[1:57:42] other and you'll find the remedy that
[1:57:44] our Lord used every time Satan it is
[1:57:47] written it is written it is written it
[1:57:50] is written
[1:57:52] even he referred people back to the
[1:57:53] physical
[1:57:54] word it is
[1:57:56] written it is written it is written and
[1:58:00] it worked and it worked so well it so
[1:58:03] shut Satan down that when he did come to
[1:58:07] him just hours before his death there
[1:58:09] was no hook there was no emotional place
[1:58:13] that he could put his finger that would
[1:58:15] distract our Lord not even in the
[1:58:17] greatest moment of his suffering if you
[1:58:19] don't know that Satan showed up in the
[1:58:21] garden of Gethsemane you ought to know
[1:58:23] it you ought to know that he was there
[1:58:26] when our Lord was in his deepest Agony
[1:58:29] you need to know that he was along with
[1:58:30] his father plus one you need to know
[1:58:33] that Satan was standing there in that
[1:58:35] Garden watching over him in his Humanity
[1:58:38] watching over him in his physical
[1:58:40] suffering you can rest assure that Satan
[1:58:42] saw those great drops of Blood The Sweat
[1:58:45] that appeared like great drops of blood
[1:58:47] you can rest assure that Satan heard his
[1:58:50] communion he heard him when and he said
[1:58:53] if at all possible let this cup pass
[1:58:55] from me but every time the Lord
[1:58:58] strengthened him every time the word
[1:59:00] strengthened him every time the angels
[1:59:03] ministered to him he was able to shut
[1:59:05] the enemy down so that Satan could say
[1:59:07] nothing we have no record that Satan
[1:59:10] even got a word
[1:59:11] out because there was nothing to put his
[1:59:14] finger on I believe God's going to have
[1:59:16] a bride he has a bride now I believe
[1:59:19] he's going to have a bride in these last
[1:59:21] days that will be so shut
[1:59:24] off we've gotten victory over our soul
[1:59:27] life we've gotten victory over our mind
[1:59:29] and our will and our emotion are we
[1:59:32] there yet no but we're marching in that
[1:59:36] direction so that nothing the enemy uses
[1:59:39] against us
[1:59:42] emotionally no rejection
[1:59:45] issue no jealousy issue come on now come
[1:59:50] on now
[1:59:52] no mistrust
[1:59:54] issue no human
[1:59:56] emotion no doubting God's motive none of
[2:00:00] that is going to be able to penetrate us
[2:00:02] all right uh uh now David is going to
[2:00:04] read Genesis
[2:00:07] 3:8 wait a minute before you do that
[2:00:10] David let me let me finish reading my
[2:00:14] note Satan failed in his temptation of
[2:00:18] Jesus to put any seeds of discrepancy or
[2:00:21] any negative thoughts toward his father
[2:00:23] in him but Jesus Took nothing the devil
[2:00:26] offered he could not be separated from
[2:00:29] the Heavenly you see that's union
[2:00:32] nothing that happened in the Earthly was
[2:00:35] successful in separating our Lord From
[2:00:38] The Heavenly I want to say that again
[2:00:40] it's PR profound enough for you to hear
[2:00:42] again nothing that the enemy was able to
[2:00:45] do was successful in separating our Lord
[2:00:48] From The Heavenly part of who he was
[2:00:51] that little bride's going to shine like
[2:00:52] that she's going to shine like that and
[2:00:55] nothing that happens around us or
[2:00:57] nothing happens to us is going to be
[2:01:00] able to separate us from that Heavenly
[2:01:02] part of who we are that eternal spirit
[2:01:04] of God that lives inside of us you see
[2:01:06] the devil knows that if he can accuse
[2:01:08] your father to
[2:01:12] you and you entertain those thoughts
[2:01:15] that he is not always good that he is
[2:01:18] not always kind that God is not always
[2:01:21] fair that he will be able to separate
[2:01:24] you from your heavenly father and he
[2:01:26] will tether you to the Earthly realm
[2:01:30] your carnality will weigh you down and
[2:01:32] you'll never be able to move in the
[2:01:33] realm of the spirit because you'll be so
[2:01:36] heavy with the Flesh and so heavy with
[2:01:38] carnality and so heavy with human
[2:01:40] emotion so Satan is constantly moving
[2:01:43] around in your life trying to do
[2:01:45] something say something orchestrate
[2:01:47] something stir up something that would
[2:01:50] cause you to think now is God really
[2:01:53] good is he really is he really fair and
[2:01:56] the word is is fair is is a is a
[2:01:59] inappropriate word for God because the
[2:02:01] Bible tells us he's just right and the
[2:02:04] enemy would approach you to try to
[2:02:05] convince you that he is not just but I'm
[2:02:08] telling you he is
[2:02:09] just he is caring he is allog together
[2:02:13] good he is kind and he loves you and in
[2:02:17] that moment when you begin to doubt
[2:02:19] God's motive toward you you are tethered
[2:02:21] to the carnal you are Tethered to the
[2:02:24] Earthly okay David Genesis 3:8 punch
[2:02:26] your neighbor everybody elbow him get
[2:02:28] them get them get them get
[2:02:30] them David and they heard the voice of
[2:02:34] the Lord God Walking In The Garden in
[2:02:37] the cool of the day and Adam and his
[2:02:39] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[2:02:42] the Lord God amongst the Trees of the
[2:02:44] garden day after day after day after day
[2:02:48] Adam and Eve had had fellowship with the
[2:02:51] Creator
[2:02:52] in the cool of the evening he came down
[2:02:55] and walked among them so much so that
[2:02:59] Adam was familiar with the sound of his
[2:03:02] coming he heard him when he came into
[2:03:05] the realm he sensed him when he came
[2:03:08] into the realm and that day that's why
[2:03:10] the Bible says it this way he heard the
[2:03:13] voice of the Lord God
[2:03:15] walking a voice doesn't walk right but
[2:03:20] Adam was so familiar with with the sound
[2:03:22] of his coming that when he began to come
[2:03:25] in when the father began to come in Adam
[2:03:27] sensed that the voice was about to speak
[2:03:30] to him and what did the Bible tell us
[2:03:32] they hid themselves they ran and got in
[2:03:36] the bush and hid themselves why do you
[2:03:38] think they did that well first of all
[2:03:40] they had now realized they were naked
[2:03:43] did you know they always were
[2:03:47] yes did you know they were always they
[2:03:50] were created that way that's how you
[2:03:53] came that's how Adam came created no
[2:03:57] shame remember they didn't know there
[2:03:58] was anything they didn't know there was
[2:04:00] any evil they didn't know there was
[2:04:03] anything but good until that moment and
[2:04:06] when they did that Glory light the glory
[2:04:10] of God the cavod that heavy presence of
[2:04:12] God that had covered them like light
[2:04:15] they were really we could say that they
[2:04:17] were wrapped in light and when that fall
[2:04:21] happened that light begin to pull away
[2:04:23] from them and they begin to look at one
[2:04:25] another and they begin to realize all of
[2:04:27] a sudden hey we're naked and he has come
[2:04:30] down to see about us and so we better
[2:04:32] hide why do you think they would have
[2:04:34] done such a thing as that because they
[2:04:36] thought he came to do them
[2:04:40] harm you all going to help me Preach
[2:04:43] Today if you don't I'm going to sit down
[2:04:45] and play last night's tape and make you
[2:04:47] hear it all
[2:04:49] again I am
[2:04:52] cuz we got to go somewhere and I can't
[2:04:55] drag you all the way we're we're just
[2:04:58] laying the foundation for where we're
[2:04:59] going to go over the next few services
[2:05:01] so you don't want to miss some of this
[2:05:03] because you're going to find some
[2:05:04] personal application in this you know I
[2:05:07] think sometime we we get this thought in
[2:05:09] our mind that that God is out to get
[2:05:12] us well I could ask for hands how many
[2:05:15] I'm not but how many have ever felt that
[2:05:17] way at some dark point in your life God
[2:05:19] just out to get me and you you got to
[2:05:22] get that out he is not out to get you
[2:05:24] he's out to get
[2:05:25] you he wants you to be fully his he came
[2:05:29] to help Adam he came to help Eve he
[2:05:32] didn't come to get them he come to get
[2:05:35] him he came to embrace them God didn't
[2:05:39] mean Adam harm God came to help God was
[2:05:42] not hiding from Adam it was it was Adam
[2:05:45] who was hiding from God and God is the
[2:05:48] one who called out Adam didn't say where
[2:05:50] are you Lord but God said where are you
[2:05:53] Adam God came seeking man in the message
[2:05:57] the calling of
[2:05:59] Abraham paragraph 17 brother random said
[2:06:03] do you know why you're a Christian
[2:06:06] because God called you just a minute
[2:06:09] amen you never did seek God at any time
[2:06:13] no sir it's God seeking you no man at
[2:06:17] any time has ever sought God God sought
[2:06:21] man that's the very thing he was doing
[2:06:23] that day in the garden God was seeking
[2:06:26] man not to harm him but to help him
[2:06:30] Hallelujah God sought man no man can
[2:06:33] come to me said Jesus except my father
[2:06:36] draw him first now I want you to listen
[2:06:38] to this the very strain from the Garden
[2:06:41] of Eden instead of the Fallen sinner
[2:06:45] trying to find God it was God trying to
[2:06:49] find the Fallen sinner Hallelujah and I
[2:06:53] want you all to read the next phrase
[2:06:55] because it's
[2:06:58] precious he's still at that job he is
[2:07:01] still looking to seek and to save that
[2:07:04] which is lost and so Adam really had
[2:07:07] nothing to fear David read for us
[2:07:10] Genesis 3:21 you know this very well
[2:07:13] I've preached this hundreds of times
[2:07:15] unto Adam also and to his wife did the
[2:07:19] Lord God make coats of skin and clothe
[2:07:22] them I I think this is I love this this
[2:07:26] was a nugget that I always took to the
[2:07:28] conferences when I would go and preach
[2:07:29] among the Pentecostals and the
[2:07:31] charismatics and you would think that
[2:07:34] that that somebody would have known that
[2:07:35] all along but you'd be surprised the
[2:07:38] pastors that would line up and say I've
[2:07:40] been studying the Bible my whole life
[2:07:42] and I never saw it that way you'd be
[2:07:45] surprised how blessed we are around this
[2:07:47] message to know the things that we know
[2:07:50] and to have heard the things that we
[2:07:52] have heard and they just say I never
[2:07:54] heard of that I I never had any and and
[2:07:56] then they begin to ask
[2:07:59] questions that's when it got tough cuz
[2:08:03] then there was some things you had to
[2:08:04] explain a little bit you know it it
[2:08:06] appears that Adam and Eve took some
[2:08:08] leaves down and and tried to sew them up
[2:08:11] and cover their
[2:08:12] nakedness a a and you know that won't
[2:08:16] work they just covered you know the
[2:08:18] little little little parts of their body
[2:08:21] little parts of their body you know uh
[2:08:25] they I I always thought that was a
[2:08:26] little fascinating that we don't read
[2:08:28] that they covered their
[2:08:31] mouth because that wasn't the
[2:08:34] sin
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:36] hello that wasn't what was causing them
[2:08:39] the trouble it was the other parts and
[2:08:42] they tried to cover that up but that
[2:08:44] wasn't really enough it's not enough
[2:08:46] today a bikini will never do the job
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:54] I I've seen more cotton in an aspirin
[2:08:56] bottle than some people wear out out in
[2:08:59] public can you say Amen you see people
[2:09:02] sometime dress these women dressed in oh
[2:09:04] it's a dress I know you I know that's
[2:09:06] what they call it but it don't look
[2:09:08] looks more like a tube to me it doesn't
[2:09:10] look like a dress and like a we've been
[2:09:12] told sometimes you look and you can't
[2:09:14] tell where they're on the inside
[2:09:16] fighting to get out or on the outside
[2:09:17] fighting to get in because there's as
[2:09:19] much on the outside as there is on the
[2:09:21] inside everybody been there and if it
[2:09:24] was an apple that opened people's eyes
[2:09:26] and kept them to see they were naked
[2:09:28] brother brandom said let's pass the
[2:09:30] apples how many of you believe if that
[2:09:32] had any effect on people we ought to
[2:09:34] pass them out because sometimes people
[2:09:37] seem to have no shame in these
[2:09:39] days hallelujah you know it's the truth
[2:09:43] but this verse is so
[2:09:46] precious because I can see God at a
[2:09:49] sewing machine
[2:09:53] amen it's
[2:09:56] figurative he he didn't have a sewing
[2:09:58] machine so he must have had needle and
[2:10:01] thread because it says he made coats of
[2:10:08] skins there had to be
[2:10:12] armholes they had to be made in such a
[2:10:14] way they would cover their body and God
[2:10:17] himself made coats of skin what do you
[2:10:20] think he did snap his fingers and and
[2:10:22] and fur furry skins appeared in his
[2:10:26] hands this is the part that used to get
[2:10:28] those preachers that say I never thought
[2:10:29] of that in all my life I never
[2:10:31] questioned where the Skins come from but
[2:10:34] I told them where the Skins come from
[2:10:36] God had to get them from something
[2:10:38] living come on now he had to find some
[2:10:40] animals there that had enough skin that
[2:10:43] could do the job and God himself
[2:10:47] ripped don't tell Peter y
[2:10:53] God ripped the skin right off of those
[2:10:56] animals shedding
[2:10:58] blood shedding
[2:11:00] blood there it is blood had to be shed a
[2:11:05] sacrifice had to be made a little animal
[2:11:08] had to give his life and shed his blood
[2:11:10] to cover what man had done there it is
[2:11:14] there it is in seed form God made them
[2:11:18] coats of skin and God clothed them that
[2:11:23] day amen he showed them how and the
[2:11:28] importance of covering up their
[2:11:30] nakedness he didn't come to destroy them
[2:11:34] he came to clothe them he came to cover
[2:11:37] their nakedness I want to read a quote
[2:11:40] here from the cruelty of sin and the
[2:11:43] penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our
[2:11:46] lives my that's a long title the cruelty
[2:11:50] of sin and the penalty that it cost to
[2:11:52] rid Sin from our lives David I'm going
[2:11:55] to get you to read the first paragraph
[2:11:57] which is 91 and let me have a have a sip
[2:12:00] of this and then I'll take over and then
[2:12:03] here is God's blueprint to Glory study
[2:12:06] it out there it is it's blood sprinkled
[2:12:10] all the way
[2:12:11] amen you can't lose the track if you
[2:12:14] follow the blood amen that's excellent
[2:12:17] excellent now you can see see just keep
[2:12:21] keep right with the blood and you'll be
[2:12:22] all right for there's a bloody footprint
[2:12:25] every step of the way hallelujah
[2:12:27] hallelujah
[2:12:30] hallelujah now notice how God back there
[2:12:34] before he could do it now he could stand
[2:12:37] or even they could stand to receive he
[2:12:39] would kill them right now he had to
[2:12:41] because he is Sovereign he has to keep
[2:12:44] his word he said the day you eat thereof
[2:12:48] that day you die that settled it forever
[2:12:53] then I can see him back there when he
[2:12:56] killed these sheep you say were they
[2:12:58] sheep brother brandom I believe it he
[2:13:00] said he was the lamb that was slain from
[2:13:04] the foundation of the world so he tells
[2:13:07] us that even the the the animal that
[2:13:09] gave its life was a
[2:13:11] type that's powerful isn't it all right
[2:13:14] let's go on and it was a sheep skin take
[2:13:17] it and throwed them back in the bushes
[2:13:20] and told them wrap up in these and come
[2:13:23] out and to
[2:13:24] receive and and I can see Adam and Eve
[2:13:27] pull these old bloody Flappy skins
[2:13:30] around them could you imagine a lovely
[2:13:34] beautiful body of those two perfect
[2:13:36] human beings now wrapped in bloody sheep
[2:13:39] skin I can see them stand out there God
[2:13:43] said Adam because you listen to your
[2:13:46] wife instead of me then I took you out
[2:13:49] of the dust and D D you'll return
[2:13:53] remember he couldn't die in the garden
[2:13:55] he had to get out of the garden before
[2:13:57] he could die paragraph 96 and Eve
[2:14:00] because you listened to the serpent
[2:14:02] instead of me you brought life took life
[2:14:06] out of the world you'll have to bring
[2:14:08] life into the world I'll multiply your
[2:14:12] Sorrows your desire shall be to your
[2:14:15] husband and so forth and then he said
[2:14:19] then to serpent because you did this we
[2:14:23] walked up he wasn't a reptile he was a
[2:14:25] beast walked up more subtle than all the
[2:14:28] beasts of the field bear me record that
[2:14:31] scripture walked up like a man and he
[2:14:34] had deceived her and he said and because
[2:14:37] you did this off comes your legs and on
[2:14:40] your belly you'll go all the days of
[2:14:43] your life and dust shall be your
[2:14:47] meat they're about to be exiled
[2:14:51] God has covered their sin he he has
[2:14:55] given them a covering he is about to
[2:14:58] drive them out of the garden into Exile
[2:15:01] David is going to read Genesis 3 and
[2:15:04] verse
[2:15:06] 24 so he drove out the man and placed at
[2:15:10] the east of the Garden of Eden Cherry
[2:15:12] beam and a flaming sword which turned
[2:15:15] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[2:15:18] life would you mind if I ask you to read
[2:15:20] it all again
[2:15:21] so he drove out the man he drove out the
[2:15:24] man and he placed at the east of the
[2:15:27] Garden of Eden cherub beams yes and a
[2:15:29] flaming sword which turned every way to
[2:15:32] keep the way of the Tree of Life come on
[2:15:38] now nothing's going to sneak up on that
[2:15:41] sword you see he's turning every way
[2:15:45] that flaming sword is there and not only
[2:15:48] is there a flaming sword there but there
[2:15:50] are Chari beams there and you Church
[2:15:53] might remember I took you through the
[2:15:54] teaching on cherub beams anybody
[2:15:56] remember one time when we were doing the
[2:15:57] whole series on Genesis when we taught
[2:16:00] the first eight or 10 chapters of the
[2:16:02] Book of Genesis we got really down in
[2:16:04] there didn't we we found out that Garden
[2:16:06] was something else we found out that
[2:16:08] there were jewels in that Garden that
[2:16:11] grew up out of the earth a a and it
[2:16:13] sparkled that that place sparkled with
[2:16:16] the glory of God right out of the word I
[2:16:18] tell you it was a beautiful place and
[2:16:20] such a sad thing to know that Adam and
[2:16:23] Eve had to be driven out of that and
[2:16:26] what was that sword therefore David what
[2:16:29] was it for to do what what does that
[2:16:30] last phrase say to keep to keep the way
[2:16:34] of the Tree of Life to keep the way of
[2:16:38] the Tree of Life to guard the way to
[2:16:41] protect the way to keep the way it's the
[2:16:45] same word that was used when Adam was
[2:16:47] given instruction to keep that Garden to
[2:16:50] tend that Garden to take care of that
[2:16:53] Garden it comes from the same Hebrew
[2:16:55] word there so it was going to require
[2:16:57] some effort of the Cher beam it was
[2:16:59] going to require some effort of that
[2:17:01] turning flaming sword to make sure that
[2:17:04] the weight of the tree of life was
[2:17:05] protected the tree of life was meant to
[2:17:08] fully connect two Realms together it was
[2:17:10] a symbol of the joining together of the
[2:17:13] Heavenly realm with the Earthly realm it
[2:17:15] stretched into the air from the earth
[2:17:18] Between Heaven and Earth ready to unite
[2:17:21] the two together in mankind I want you
[2:17:24] to read uh Genesis I want we're going to
[2:17:27] do 22 23 and 24 from chapter 3 and we're
[2:17:32] going to do it in in the translation of
[2:17:35] baret now beet is the Hebrew uh word for
[2:17:40] Genesis and and and our dear friend of
[2:17:44] blessed memory uh Rabbi David fredman
[2:17:47] who spoke here from this pull pit on
[2:17:50] more than one occas cion uh has now gone
[2:17:53] to be with the Lord he did a a marvelous
[2:17:57] translation of the Book of Genesis from
[2:17:59] the original Hebrew and we have that and
[2:18:02] David is going to read these three
[2:18:04] verses in his translation of
[2:18:07] baret the Lord God said the man is like
[2:18:11] one of us knowing good from Evil so in
[2:18:15] order that he doesn't try to take
[2:18:17] anything from the Tree of Life and eat
[2:18:20] it then then live forever live forever
[2:18:23] with a fallen
[2:18:27] Spirit you see his Spirit
[2:18:31] fell oh the
[2:18:34] agony oh the sad sad sad
[2:18:38] Destiny of living forever in a body with
[2:18:43] a fallen
[2:18:44] Spirit separated from your creator if
[2:18:48] Adam would have gone up a a and and
[2:18:50] partook of the of the tree of life he
[2:18:53] would have lived forever but with a
[2:18:54] fallen spirit so God had to have another
[2:18:58] way he had to get him far enough away
[2:19:01] from it because eventually God was going
[2:19:04] to turn every man's heart toward the
[2:19:06] tree amen and Adam would find the same
[2:19:09] forgiveness that everybody else was
[2:19:10] going to find so I love the way that is
[2:19:13] translated David I'm sorry but read 22
[2:19:16] again the Lord God said the man is like
[2:19:19] one of us now The Reason Why Us is used
[2:19:22] is because the Hebrew word is
[2:19:25] Elohim and the word Elohim means uh the
[2:19:29] all existing or self-existing one but in
[2:19:34] Hebrew it is a plural word and it
[2:19:37] doesn't mean a plurality of
[2:19:41] persons it doesn't mean an EXT listen
[2:19:43] carefully now it doesn't mean an
[2:19:46] external
[2:19:47] conference it's not three people sitting
[2:19:50] at a table let us make man in our image
[2:19:53] it's an internal
[2:19:55] conference can you see that it's it's
[2:19:58] God the Eternal Spirit of the
[2:20:01] father having a conference with
[2:20:04] himself and the Hebrew word Elohim
[2:20:08] expresses the wholeness of God while
[2:20:11] also expressing the multifaceted nature
[2:20:15] of God he is father he is son he is Holy
[2:20:19] Ghost he is healer he is savior he is
[2:20:22] deliverer Hallelujah he's many
[2:20:24] attributes the prophet tells us but all
[2:20:27] in one eternal spirit and so don't let
[2:20:30] that us throw you this was this was a a
[2:20:33] conference that took place within that
[2:20:37] essence of the eternal spirit of God and
[2:20:40] that's powerful to note the the the man
[2:20:43] is like one of us why go on David
[2:20:46] knowing good from Evil he now knows good
[2:20:49] from evil until that
[2:20:52] moment until that moment they didn't
[2:20:54] know good from Evil they only knew good
[2:20:57] oh does does that appeal to
[2:21:00] anybody H how many how many have ever
[2:21:03] thought about it take just a moment I
[2:21:05] want you to think of all the bad you you
[2:21:07] receive in a
[2:21:10] day all the bad
[2:21:13] news you you work with people who have
[2:21:16] always got bad bad bad always got
[2:21:20] something something bad always got an
[2:21:21] ugly word always got a dirty
[2:21:24] joke always got something negative you
[2:21:28] you just live in such a Negative world
[2:21:30] right now can you imagine an hour when
[2:21:33] that whole evil is
[2:21:36] ripped every bit every bit of that is
[2:21:38] separated from us and all that we live
[2:21:41] in is the knowledge of God oh my my my
[2:21:44] my my the prophet prophesied of the Old
[2:21:47] Testament about a time when the
[2:21:49] knowledge of the glory of the Lord would
[2:21:50] fill the Earth the land and the Sea
[2:21:52] won't that be a marvelous day that
[2:21:54] everyone who's left in existence is
[2:21:56] going to know they're going to know and
[2:21:58] discern the glory of God powerful read
[2:22:01] on David so in order that he doesn't try
[2:22:05] to take anything from the Tree of Life
[2:22:08] and eat it then Live
[2:22:10] Forever The Lord God exiled him exiled
[2:22:14] him from the garden of delight remember
[2:22:18] that's what Eden means go ahead
[2:22:21] so that he would Farm the very ground
[2:22:23] from which he was created now Adam is
[2:22:26] going to have to till the soil and farm
[2:22:29] the ground the very dirt the very ground
[2:22:32] from which he was created don't you like
[2:22:34] the way that's worded next verse and so
[2:22:38] he expelled the man expelled him then
[2:22:42] winged beings were stationed in front of
[2:22:45] the garden of delight along with the
[2:22:47] rotating flaming sword that guarded the
[2:22:50] way to the Tree of Life does anybody
[2:22:52] have a question now is there something
[2:22:54] predominantly floating around in your
[2:22:56] mind as you hear this language is
[2:22:58] anybody with me enough that you've got a
[2:23:01] question does it seem to me like
[2:23:03] somebody's missing from this
[2:23:08] talk Eve is is
[2:23:11] missing we've got two verses here that
[2:23:14] talk about the man being driven from the
[2:23:16] garden what of Eve
[2:23:20] I don't read anything about
[2:23:25] Eve the key is in the earlier verses of
[2:23:28] these of these scriptures where where
[2:23:30] God talks about in the beginning he he
[2:23:32] made them as
[2:23:35] one a and the Bible tells us in the New
[2:23:38] Testament as we mentioned last night
[2:23:40] that Adam was not deceived but Eve is
[2:23:41] the one taken in the transgression and
[2:23:44] what did Adam do he stepped
[2:23:46] up he stepped up a and he actually
[2:23:49] shielded her her he actually said I take
[2:23:54] full
[2:23:56] responsibility for her sin when he
[2:23:59] participated in the same act that caused
[2:24:01] her to fall you know he could have he
[2:24:04] could have divorced
[2:24:07] her he could have said you're dirty now
[2:24:09] help help me now I'm going to try to do
[2:24:11] this delicately he could have said
[2:24:13] you're dirty
[2:24:16] now you you you want you've two timed
[2:24:19] meuh
[2:24:21] think about it a minute you're no longer
[2:24:23] just pure to
[2:24:25] me you you you you've two timed me and
[2:24:29] now I don't want to ever look at you
[2:24:31] again but Hallelujah he didn't do that
[2:24:35] because Adam the perfect man created in
[2:24:37] the image and likeness of God he stepped
[2:24:40] up on Eve's
[2:24:42] behalf woo how many times could God have
[2:24:46] divorced us how many times could he have
[2:24:49] driven us into Exile oh but how many of
[2:24:53] you are thankful for the last Adam no
[2:24:55] wonder Paul said the last Adam he came
[2:24:57] along Hallelujah and stood between
[2:25:02] sin and our life he stood between hell
[2:25:06] and judgment and our life and so what
[2:25:10] you will find out is that in that moment
[2:25:12] of Exile when God was driving them out
[2:25:14] of the garden God had so accepted the
[2:25:18] substitutionary work of Adam
[2:25:21] Adam that he looked at him as
[2:25:23] one and when it says he expelled the man
[2:25:26] he expelled Eve as well but this
[2:25:29] language in Hebrew is telling us that
[2:25:32] now Adam has taken on Eve has has has
[2:25:35] technically let's say spiritually she
[2:25:38] has become a part of Adam again not
[2:25:41] physically not physically she's still
[2:25:43] walking there but there was a union that
[2:25:46] was introduced in that moment that's
[2:25:48] actually more profound than the fact
[2:25:50] that Adam was created with even side
[2:25:52] this is actually a little bit more
[2:25:54] profound because this is how God looks
[2:25:56] at a husband and wife they are not
[2:25:58] physically
[2:25:59] one they're physically two individuals
[2:26:02] but when God looks at them he sees them
[2:26:05] in a
[2:26:06] union that's so holy because it mimics
[2:26:09] his Union with his bride this is very
[2:26:12] powerful language here it didn't say and
[2:26:15] he expelled the man and Eve or man and
[2:26:18] the woman yeah but it simply refers to
[2:26:21] the man being driven out because the man
[2:26:24] had taken on that work of substitution
[2:26:27] it was now his responsibility to make
[2:26:30] sure that Eve got back to the
[2:26:34] Creator it's a husband's
[2:26:37] responsibility to bring his wife to
[2:26:40] Christ and then let her be one with
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:46] Christ it's our
[2:26:48] responsibility to bring bring her back
[2:26:51] and say she's
[2:26:53] yours it's powerful it speaks to us of
[2:26:57] where we are that that word
[2:27:00] drove that shows up in that verse the
[2:27:03] phrase about being drove out it comes
[2:27:07] from a word that actually mean it's
[2:27:09] garash in Hebrew and it actually means
[2:27:11] divorce do I have that uh Austin did I
[2:27:15] leave that in the notes for you to put
[2:27:16] up or did I delete that out I thought I
[2:27:19] put up the Hebrew word there after that
[2:27:21] I thought I left it in there I didn't
[2:27:23] all right let me read it to you I made
[2:27:25] the mistake of taking it out the the
[2:27:27] word drove out or the phrase they drove
[2:27:30] them out it comes from a A Primitive
[2:27:33] Hebrew word that means to especially to
[2:27:36] expatriate or
[2:27:38] divorce it means to Cast Away to drive
[2:27:42] away to put away it is the same word
[2:27:45] used later in the Old Testament to
[2:27:48] describe the word divorce
[2:27:50] so there was a divorce taking place and
[2:27:54] Adam and Eve were driven out of that
[2:27:56] place of delight I'm telling you it's
[2:27:59] the sweetest place when we really begin
[2:28:02] to understand Eden we understand that
[2:28:05] for someone to say we're going back to
[2:28:07] Eden is still a very appropriate thing
[2:28:09] to say we're going to a new Heaven and a
[2:28:11] new Earth one day but I want you to know
[2:28:13] Eden was such a perfect example of the
[2:28:16] kingdom and where we're headed to can
[2:28:18] anybody accept that we we are in Exile
[2:28:21] even now we have been exiled from
[2:28:23] Paradise we have been exiled from that
[2:28:26] presence of God to come down and talk to
[2:28:29] him like like a man would talk to his
[2:28:31] friend our soul and our bodies created
[2:28:34] for the garden of delight you were
[2:28:37] created for that place you were created
[2:28:40] for that Eternal peace the passion and
[2:28:43] frustration of mankind is that he tasted
[2:28:46] of the fruit of the garden and he Longs
[2:28:49] ever more after it Adam was never
[2:28:52] satisfied he never was fully at home
[2:28:56] because he knew there was a place over
[2:28:58] there there was something over there now
[2:29:00] you may not understand this but you came
[2:29:02] from
[2:29:04] God we're not of that Mormon Doctrine
[2:29:07] the pre-existence of souls we don't
[2:29:09] believe that we existed as a soul but we
[2:29:12] do believe that we existed in the
[2:29:14] presence of God and I want you to know
[2:29:16] there's a long how could you have such a
[2:29:18] long how could you sing I've never been
[2:29:20] this homesick for before about a place
[2:29:23] you've never been well see you were
[2:29:28] there in eternity past you were there
[2:29:32] you were in his mind oh and sometimes I
[2:29:35] mean this this has happened to me
[2:29:36] multiple times through the years when
[2:29:38] that presence
[2:29:40] comes it feels so familiar at times it's
[2:29:45] almost like what the world says is deja
[2:29:47] vu it's like oh this presence is so fam
[2:29:50] familiar or to be this near to God for
[2:29:52] him to come down and be this near to us
[2:29:55] it feels so familiar you know what I
[2:29:56] believe I believe we're receiving memory
[2:29:58] I believe God is releasing memory to us
[2:30:01] of what it was like to be with him in
[2:30:02] the beginning if you were in his mind if
[2:30:06] you were in his thought then you were in
[2:30:08] his head so to speak and sometimes that
[2:30:11] presence comes and it feels so familiar
[2:30:13] and sometimes you look around the world
[2:30:15] you were born here it's all you've ever
[2:30:17] really known in the natural isn't it but
[2:30:19] how many of you would have to confess
[2:30:21] that sometimes you grow very
[2:30:27] detached this world is not my
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:34] home what about this one one of my
[2:30:36] favorite ones I don't want to get
[2:30:40] adjusted to this world to this
[2:30:44] world I've got a home that's so much
[2:30:47] better I'm going to go there sooner or
[2:30:50] later I don't want to get adjusted to
[2:30:53] this world sing it with me I don't want
[2:30:56] to get
[2:30:58] adjusted to this
[2:31:01] world to this
[2:31:03] world I've got a home that's so much
[2:31:06] better I'm going to go there sooner or
[2:31:09] later I don't want to get adjusted to
[2:31:13] this
[2:31:15] world
[2:31:17] Hallelujah I'm going to read one more
[2:31:19] Passage and I'm going to
[2:31:20] close I'm really tired this morning and
[2:31:24] uh I don't seem to be able to get the
[2:31:26] groove and I don't want to make you sit
[2:31:29] through it and but I want to leave this
[2:31:31] with you so so you can get at least a a
[2:31:34] glimpse of where we're going it's from
[2:31:36] the same message the cruelty of sin and
[2:31:38] the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from
[2:31:41] our lives it's paragraph
[2:31:44] 103 he said how I would like to deal
[2:31:47] there just a little bit in Eden would
[2:31:49] you me musicians come for me please
[2:31:52] notice when they were driven from the
[2:31:55] garden because of
[2:31:58] transgression all the blessings cut off
[2:32:02] because of
[2:32:04] transgression and I think tonight that's
[2:32:07] what's the matter with the church all
[2:32:10] the blessings are being cut off because
[2:32:12] of transgression there there you are
[2:32:16] driven from the Garden of Eden now I
[2:32:19] want you to notice here come when Cain
[2:32:22] and Abel the two sons of Adam and Eve
[2:32:24] came forward to make an
[2:32:27] offering I
[2:32:29] believe the great
[2:32:31] cherubim was at the East side of the
[2:32:33] gate and that sword whirling back and
[2:32:36] forth guarded that gate there that
[2:32:40] entered into Eden now I want you to read
[2:32:43] notice this next next place right here
[2:32:45] it's beautiful to me notice fire
[2:32:50] the Holy Spirit fire guarding the
[2:32:58] gate that fire is important you you tell
[2:33:02] me the Holy Ghost is not important you
[2:33:04] tell me the fire of God is not important
[2:33:06] I'm telling you it's very
[2:33:08] important it's it it reveals the way it
[2:33:12] not only protected the way and kept the
[2:33:14] way it reveals the way the way to the
[2:33:16] tree of life is revealed in the fire of
[2:33:18] God the Holy Spirit Fire come we need
[2:33:22] your fire today the Holy Spirit fire
[2:33:26] guarding the gate and then paragraph 107
[2:33:28] and today that's what guards the gate
[2:33:34] listen if you're scared of the Holy
[2:33:37] Ghost and Fire you'll never get
[2:33:41] in
[2:33:44] fiery fiery the sword of God
[2:33:48] fiery go God is a consuming fire
[2:33:52] watching that tree guarding that tree of
[2:33:56] life if you're afraid of Holy Ghost Fire
[2:33:59] you'll never approach the
[2:34:00] tree because there's something stands
[2:34:03] between you and the tree and that's the
[2:34:04] fire of God so you're going to have to
[2:34:07] be willing to walk into it hear me now
[2:34:10] if the fire is standing between you and
[2:34:12] the way to get to the tree of life
[2:34:14] you're going to have to be willing to
[2:34:15] walk through the fire didn't we sing
[2:34:18] that this morning with the in the
[2:34:23] fire God is not going to leave you he
[2:34:26] shows up in the
[2:34:28] fire you don't have to be afraid of
[2:34:31] getting to the tree because there's fire
[2:34:33] between you and the tree because the
[2:34:36] sword that was positioned there to keep
[2:34:39] man out until the appropriate time that
[2:34:42] same sword is the word of God and if you
[2:34:45] will realize this revealed message from
[2:34:48] the word the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:34:50] is the sword that's pushing us into the
[2:34:53] tree so what kept us from the tree until
[2:34:56] it was time to get to
[2:34:58] him is now the very thing that's pushing
[2:35:00] Us in so let's say the sword that kept
[2:35:04] us
[2:35:06] out is now the sword that's driving us
[2:35:09] in the word that kept us out because it
[2:35:12] was a veiled
[2:35:14] mystery we couldn't understand it so we
[2:35:18] could never get in trying to follow it
[2:35:20] but God sent the Holy Ghost and he sent
[2:35:23] the message of the hour and now we
[2:35:25] understand the word and we realize this
[2:35:28] Revelation didn't come to keep us
[2:35:32] out this Revelation actually came to
[2:35:35] make us one with the Tree of
[2:35:41] Life who is M Jesus
[2:35:44] Christ somebody said brother gree this
[2:35:46] said me who is M is Jesus Christ
[2:35:51] she's part of the tree of
[2:35:53] life isn't she she's part of the tree of
[2:35:56] life how how did that happen because
[2:35:58] because she has to go through the fire
[2:36:00] to get to
[2:36:04] him you see there was a vision one time
[2:36:07] that helped us God sent a vision to this
[2:36:10] body that helped us one time there there
[2:36:12] was some there was some changes that
[2:36:14] went on I'm not going to go too deep cuz
[2:36:16] I'm closing now and maybe you could find
[2:36:18] something nice to play
[2:36:20] but uh to help me close and I don't feel
[2:36:24] defeated I just feel like we've done
[2:36:26] what we need to do today and we'll we'll
[2:36:29] we'll gather again we're going to have
[2:36:31] Fellowship I worked pretty hard last
[2:36:33] night and I'm happy I I'll be honest
[2:36:36] with you I was happy when we finished
[2:36:39] singing I could have gone then we'd been
[2:36:42] with God we've been with him today we
[2:36:45] were with him last night he's been so
[2:36:47] good but there was a change of order as
[2:36:50] some of you will remember and sister
[2:36:53] Alfreda is not here for you to go ask
[2:36:54] after the service so you'll have to try
[2:36:57] to figure it out yourself but there was
[2:37:00] a change of order that took place in the
[2:37:03] in the Dove and the
[2:37:06] eagle you see there was a there was a
[2:37:09] there was a brown Eagle in a vision that
[2:37:13] came and that to us it symbolized the
[2:37:17] prophet that wore a hat
[2:37:20] it's going to sound a little mysterious
[2:37:21] here because that's how the vision came
[2:37:24] a a and behind that brown Eagle came a a
[2:37:28] white
[2:37:29] dove does anybody remember that so in
[2:37:32] that Vision a brown Eagle came and then
[2:37:35] a White Dove came and then the next
[2:37:38] time the White Dove came first and it
[2:37:42] was leading
[2:37:43] something something was following that
[2:37:45] white dove now I want you to know that I
[2:37:48] believe that one of the very most
[2:37:52] important things that God sent this
[2:37:56] message to do was to get you and I to
[2:38:00] the true baptism of the Holy
[2:38:05] Ghost I know I know I
[2:38:08] know I know that the the most emphasis
[2:38:11] is on the
[2:38:12] Mysteries and that's because they don't
[2:38:14] know how to put the singular on the they
[2:38:17] know how to make the singular plural and
[2:38:19] the plural singular they they missed
[2:38:21] some things in there I want you to know
[2:38:24] I understand that the third pull was the
[2:38:25] revealing of the mystery I understand
[2:38:27] that a lot of that was already done and
[2:38:30] accomplished in our day but I want you
[2:38:33] to know that there's a lot of Truth in
[2:38:35] this message that sets the baptism of
[2:38:37] the holy ghost in a scriptural place and
[2:38:40] brother Brandon wasn't against emotion
[2:38:42] but he didn't want anybody thinking that
[2:38:45] because they had emotion that's a human
[2:38:47] reaction anybody can have Emo I without
[2:38:50] the Holy Ghost you can get caught up in
[2:38:52] the
[2:38:53] music and not have the Holy Ghost and so
[2:38:56] one of the things I appreciate the most
[2:38:58] about this message is how we are we are
[2:39:01] taught and how we can receive an
[2:39:04] understanding of the importance of
[2:39:06] having our own experience with God and
[2:39:08] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:10] for ourselves you've got to have the
[2:39:12] Holy Ghost you've got to have the Holy
[2:39:15] Ghost and you've got to have a no so not
[2:39:17] just on your flesh not just in your
[2:39:19] emotion but you've got to know that your
[2:39:21] human Spirit has been regenerated by his
[2:39:24] breath are you with me by his Holy
[2:39:27] Spirit and when we get that when we get
[2:39:30] that genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:32] there's so much that comes with it it's
[2:39:35] that authority to speak the
[2:39:38] word it's that authority to see the
[2:39:41] creative word of God operating Among Us
[2:39:43] Again
[2:39:44] Hallelujah and so I'm I'm I'm looking
[2:39:47] for uh this I'm rejoicing in what we see
[2:39:50] God doing because I believe it's just
[2:39:53] the white dove
[2:39:54] again the last time he came following
[2:39:57] the brown Eagle but this time he comes
[2:39:59] leading the way for something else and
[2:40:01] that's not another
[2:40:02] Prophet that's for the sons of God he's
[2:40:06] leading the sons of God forward that's
[2:40:08] what the dove is doing now Hallelujah
[2:40:11] that's why some of you are enjoying the
[2:40:13] Holy Ghost like you haven't in a long
[2:40:14] long time because God's getting us ready
[2:40:17] this word is about to come alive in us
[2:40:20] and when it does we've got a lot of work
[2:40:22] to do before we get out of here but it's
[2:40:24] going to be Supernatural work how many
[2:40:26] of you ready for that you you can stand
[2:40:30] with me if you will I'm going to ask Ben
[2:40:32] to come and lead us in worship and I
[2:40:34] don't want us to walk out of here solemn
[2:40:37] I want us to enter into this worship now
[2:40:39] I want us to enter into it with
[2:40:41] everything that we've got and I want us
[2:40:42] to thank God that he's been so faithful
[2:40:45] to help us along the
[2:40:47] way thank you
