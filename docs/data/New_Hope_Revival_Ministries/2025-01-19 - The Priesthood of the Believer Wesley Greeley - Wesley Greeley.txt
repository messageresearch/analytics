Description:
This message by Wesley Greeley explores the believer’s identity as the temple of the Holy Ghost and the responsibility of maintaining spiritual integrity. Drawing from Old Testament tabernacle imagery, it emphasizes the priestly calling, the need for daily consecration, and the process of spiritual refinement. The sermon challenges believers to move beyond the outer court, embrace holiness, and fully yield to God’s presence in the Holy of Holies.

our our love to pour out our love on him because he's worthy of it if you have your Bibles today would you turn with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 uh thank you to all the musicians so thankful for every one of you you are a blessing to us we are thankful to the Lord for each of [Applause] you each one that's cross trained and can do more than one job we're thankful for that it's uh a big blessing to us here in this house to have so many capable musicians 1 Corinthians chapter 3 lest I should forget as far as I know standing here right this moment unless snow mageddon comes through there will be a service here on Tuesday night we seem to be right on the line of whatever is going through uh if you paid attention the last time uh that with the severe weather went through we were on the southernmost point of it and it seems this time we're on the Norther most point of it and who knows what we'll get some apps say that we're going to get 1 to three Ines others show it's just rain in about 38 degrees time will tell so uh we'll try to get the word out if for some reason we cannot be here on Tuesday night I want to thank the Lord today those of you that may not be paying attention to it there were three hostages released today into the hands of the Israelis we're grateful to the Lord for that we want to see all of them returned and we're believing the Lord for that they don't know how many of them are still alive but they have released three females today and they seem to be uh good uh however that looks they're alive and they're being returned to Israel and we're thankful for that um it's it's sad to see that there have to be hundreds of of ter terrorist release for one Israeli life uh it's it's it's hard to watch but I'm glad to know Sovereign God I'm glad to know that he is in control of it and we are just going to keep praying and we're going to keep calling the plans of Heaven into the Earth that's what the bride is is destined for that's what she's called for is to continue to call the plans of of Heaven into the Earth to see all of the plans of Heaven carried out in the earth in the end time 1 Corinthians chapter 3 while you're standing verses 16 and 17 probably familiar to you know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are all right so then uh let's just flip over to 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9- 20 then we'll pray and let you have your seat 1 Corinthians 6:9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God all things are lawful unto me but not all things but all things are not expedient or profitable all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any meet for the belly the belly for Meats but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body and God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up Us by his own power know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an Harlot God forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an Harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods let's pray before you're seated today heavenly father I want to thank you for your love and your grace I want to thank you for all the kindness that you show to us on a daily basis Lord we're not deserving of it but I thank you that you still show us Mercy I thank you that you are here today we've presented ourselves for your service now Lord we have had a time of worship and we're looking now to your word and asking you that you would speak to us from your word God let us gain uh knowledge and nuggets from it that will help us in our journey from here forward you see all of the needs among the body and those that are watching by way of stream and I'm asking you that God you would speak to us from your word hide your servant hide all of his inabilities Lord may you speak forth from these lips of clay and may you get the glory and all the honor for for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats today we've been hearing preaching over the last weeks and months and we want to uh just read a scripture here into the record that we heard uh not long ago from our pastor in John Chapter 2 ver 17- 22 and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up then answered the Jews and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up then said the Jews 46 years was this temple in building and will you rear it up in three days but he spake of the Temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said now brother Shelly has been teaching us over the course of weeks and months about guarding our heart and that the Zeal of the Lord's house or the Zeal of the house of the Lord hath eaten me up uh he's been addressing the the Inner Man things that go on in the sole realm of of this human that we are uh we once again we understand that we are Spirit soul and body and uh that God has redeemed our spirit to himself we carry a measure of the spirit of God within us we already know that we're going to receive a new body this body we're going to lay down and it's going to go back to ashes and we get a new body I don't know exactly what that will look like I don't know how to describe it in in in English language all I know is that I'm expecting a new body uh this one is failing me and and yours is failing you but we're thankful that we have this body to be able to uh get around the earth God put us on the earth for a reason and he gave us a human body to uh he didn't send us here as an angel he didn't send us here as a ghost he didn't send us here as as just a spirit he sent us here as a human being being and when he sent us he sent us with a human being as a human being he didn't send us as a robot he sent us here with a mind a will and with emotions and he sent us here so that we could demonstrate our love for him and he had already provided a way for us to get back to him he did not send us here and when our Earthly days were over that was it he sent us here for a purpose to demonstrate to the world that there is somebody who is not going to just survive in the end time but someone who is going to thrive someone who is going to overcome every Spirit of this age they're going to overcome all of the uh antagonists that are out there trying to get you to flub up some of you that have lived a long time in the world there are those who have watched you through the years and they're just waiting for you to mess up well I'm calling by the spirit of God today that you are not going to mess up but you are going to overcome you're going to show the world that the Holy Ghost is able to get inside of a person and able to give them the grace to overcome in Satan's Eden even when everybody is sitting around waiting for you to mess up there is the possibility but I'm glad today for the grace of God that I don't have to be steeped in man's religion until that when I mess up all of the sudden all the good that God has brought me through and two I don't have to throw it to the wind and say I'm messed up I must be going to hell I must not be saved I don't have to live under that bondage and you don't have to live under that Bond bondage when God saved you he didn't save you to lose you he saved you to take you all the way through and that is the plan that he has for your life to take you all the way through so when the Lord saves you and he baptizes you in the Holy Ghost you walk in Christian baptism the baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've repented of your sins you have become the candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he doesn't just stop with the initial baptism but he continues to give us fillings day by day by day so we're looking at the Temple of the Holy Ghost when when Jesus told them the Zeal of thine house ha eaten me up and then he told them you can destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it back up because that they were so human- minded they were so with what they could see they did not realize he wasn't talking about a building he was talking about his own self in three days destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it back up and he was speaking concerning his body now we know that we are a part of the body of the Lord and and we've just read that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost or what don't you know that you are that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and so we are as humans we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and uh we have been instructed that we need to take care of the Temple as with a four-walled structure there is maintenance that has to be done otherwise things begin to fall into disrepair those of us who have watched things through the years and and have had some experience uh I've had an I've had experiences with vehicles and watching homes and if they are not used and they are not kept in repair they end up falling apart if a vehicle sits idle for a long time the seals begin to dry rot and then when it is moved they begin to leak fluid a home that is I I don't really understand because uh it seems to me like that if a roof is roof is a roof but it seems that you can watch homes that are not lived in and they begin to Decay well it seemed you know just logically to me if it's got a good shingle roof on it and nobody's living in there or if somebody's living in there it doesn't seem that that shingle roof is going to deteriorate at any different level of speed than it would if somebody did live in there but but it seems as though if nobody lives in a home it starts decaying just starts decaying start decaying and there's there's no maintenance to it there there's no upkeep that has been done to it and so there is necessity to to upkeep the house the building the four walls uh there was a necessity to upkeep the temple there was a necessity to to look out for things and so that is what I would like to try to address today and I I would like for us to go to the Psalms and read Psalm 27 this is a familiar Psalm the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host should encamp against me my heart should not fear though War should rise against me in this I will be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou s seek my face my heart said unto thee thy fa face oh Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy ways oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses uh I'm reading it again are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord now I want to go back to verse four because David is expressing who he knows the Lord is and he's expressing the thought that he had enemies all around him but he knew that there was a place that he could feel safe and that was in verse four one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple as I was reading this a several several weeks ago the word inquire jumped out at me because when we we have in other translations this word is spelled i n qu i r e to inquire about something and this is just really it's a different spelling of the word inquir and it means to seek or to consider or to look for or to reflect but as I continued to read definitions down underneath there was a definition that caused me to think about what God has been speaking to us over the course of weeks and months and and this word can also mean to plow or to break forth and figuratively to inspect or to care for or to seek out and it can also mean to cleave or to open now when we think about cleaving something those of you that are old enough to know what a meat cleaver looks like like when meat is cleaved is that correct cleaved or clave CL when you cleave meat you cut it it is a very sharp object that goes through the meat and opens it up just the same as when a plow goes into the Earth to open up the Earth to turn the soil over farming is different these days than when I was a child but I as a child I can remember in the springtime when the farmers would begin preparing the fields for uh planting the seed they would pull out the three bottom or five bottom plows some of them had larger than that and these plows would would cut down into the Earth and would flip the soil over and in so so doing the last one would leave a ditch in the earth and when they came back to do another set of plowing the tractor tire would go in that ditch in the earth so that they could follow a straight run but the O the the idea was that they were plowing into the Earth to cause the soil to be turned over because they were preparing the soil to receive nutrients and to receive seed and so when I'm looking at this scripture in Psalm 27 when David said he was going to inquire in his Temple my mind be to think about how that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and how that God has come and he is doing the inquiring on the Temple and he is causing us to do the same thing and we are allowing him to come with the meat cleaver or with the plow to plow deep into our Inner Man into our soul realm to lay things open it is his desire to lay them open before us not because he wants to inflict another injury on us but he's calling us he wants us to be so fully dedicated to him that we are carriers of the glory so then you start thinking about the Temple of Herod the Temple of Solomon on back to the Tabernacle of David the Tabernacle in the wilderness the one that God instructed Moses to set up and God instructed Moses in in Exodus 25 he said speak to the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart you shall take the offering so there is the start of it God is calling for an offering but he's asking for it willingly wants us to be willing he doesn't want to he he doesn't want to force it perhaps sometime in your journey you have felt forced you ought to thank the Lord that he would in your stubbornness in your Rebellion whatever word you want to use that he would be so gracious to you that he would though he may have had to use a little extra Force he got you where he needed to get you all right so the Lord has speaking to Moses verse three this is the offering which you shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and Ram's skin dyed red and Badger skin them wood oil for the light spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense onx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and the breastplate and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of the instruments thereof even so shall you make it so God wanted to dwell among his people when he asked Moses to build a tab Tabernacle that plan was not just one that Moses thought up all by himself that plan was one that he got in the mountain when he spent time with the Lord and he was taken up into Heavenly places and he brought the pattern from the from Heaven he brought it into the Earth and he he didn't do it all by himself he had help in getting there were there were men who were skilled Craftsmen there were women who spun the the the the cloth there were helps of all kinds to help to bring about this uh Tabernacle in the wilderness so that it was patterned after the pattern that Moses saw in the heavens because God wanted to dwell among his people and he doesn't only want to dwell among them it is God's whole desire to dwell in them there are many Christians even today who are satisfied for God to dwell with them you see the signs on the cars that say God is my co-pilot there's a whole lot of people that God is their co-pilot and really God wants to put us in the back seat and he wants to be the pilot of this ship he's the one that wants to run this this vessel but yet we have of times been in such a place where that we did not allow him to be pilot and we only wanted him to be God With Us God get me through this God get me through that and it was always God on the peripheral and it was you know as as long as things are going good you know God is with me but that's all that they have allowed for him to be it's God with what God is really Desiring is for us to be vessels that carry him wherever we go he's not following us he's in Us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this baptism of the Holy Ghost is not just a once and done this is a holy ghost that is continually being in uh put into us being were re refilled and refilled and refilled because that was the design that he had because as I said A week or so ago we could not have handled it all at one time we would explode there sometimes the Holy Ghost comes in such measures and we don't know what to do with ourselves and that's just a foretaste of what he really wants to do and if he put in us the full measure we would explode we would not know what to do so he gave us a foreshadowing of his plan now again man being Spirit soul and body or if we reverse them by Body Soul and Spirit we're we're we're going to look at the Tabernacle today and we're going to just try to get a sense of how that God really desires to Tabernacle inside of us or to be for our vessel to be his Temple remembering Psalm 26 74 we're inquiring in his Temple we're going to plow into it we're going to let the meat cleaver come we're going to let him open it up that's what we've really been doing over the past weeks and months as the spirit of God has been talking to us about uh things on in the soul realm whether they be anger or bitterness or Envy or Strife or jealousies whatever ever these things are that we may deal with and uh there are sometimes that we feel like that we have the victory over them and there are other times that they smack us upside the head and we're dealing with them all all over again be simply because God is still doing the plowing he's still looking on the inside of us and so when when God designed a a he allowed Moses to bring the design of the tabernacle into the Earth it was the it was a pattern of things that he saw in the heavens and we see first of all in the in the courtyard there is the the altar of the burnt offering and we can find this in Leviticus chap 6 so in the burnt offering that this is where that they brought the sacrif Rices for the priests to be able to sacrifice on behalf of the people now sometimes we forget that the priests also were human the priests fought the same battles as all the rest of the population the priests were just as human as the rest of the population and and they did not spent 365 days working in the temple they went by courses and so they had the opportunity to go to their homes to be with their wives and their children they had the opportunity to to No Doubt plant uh and and sew and whatever although the people brought to them uh of of of the first fruits of their crops and flocks and so forth so that they didn't they could be in the service of of the Lord they did not have to plant a garden uh but they had the opportunity to go home and and they had to deal with unruly children they had to deal with the door falling off the hinge they had to deal with life and even though these men were a part of the tribe of Levi they had been called by God to be a part of uh uh the temple and the the workings of the the Tabernacle they were intricately involved in in the the workings of the Tabernacle they were still men some of them were softspoken some of them had high tempers some of them no doubt were were skinny some were Hefty some tall some short they were just as human as the rest of the crowd but they were called and so the scripture tells us that there were times that the priests would come and before that they could offer an offering for the people they had to offer an offering for themselves because they also had heart issues and they wanted to make sure that they were offering the right offering to the Lord before they went in to do the service of the Lord but I I for whatever reason I've this thought has never crossed my mind that I remember thinking about the work that these priests had anybody in here ever worked on a farm I know Joshua River has you've worked on a farm anybody ever had an unruly Beast that you had to deal with these priests were dealing with animals and for whatever reason I've never thought what if the animal got away what if he just started running through the courtyard now what if he went toward the Tabernacle what if he just what if he just went wild before he got to the Altar and this priest had to run after it and try to get it under control and bring it back to make sure that it was a worthy specimen to Slit it throat not shoot it with a gun to Slit its throat and catch its blood because the blood had to be poured out in a certain way some of the blood was sprinkled some of the blood was poured out and then this Beast had to be cut apart the fat went a certain way the the the the the meat of it was laid on the on the coals of fire and all of the while this priest a human being No Doubt with blood all over him trying to put a beast on this altar either for himself or for someone who brought it to be sacrificed on their behalf half so the priest had to offer this sacrifice on the altar of burnt offerings this being the first of a stage that we as a human would go through after Jesus Christ paid the price at Calvary no longer did we have to bring a beast whether it be a lamb or a Ram or a bulock or a pigeon no longer was that necessary now God wanted the human and then he didn't want you to crawl up on a literal altar that was burning with hot coals that you would physically be consumed but he wanted you to lay Across The Altar and present yourself to him and say Lord here I am I present myself to you I have nothing to bring except the perfect lamb just yourself to lay across the altar Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service so you begin by offering yourself this is so Elemental for most of us but let's get something out of it today just laying ourself Across The Altar and saying Lord here I am you said that I you wanted me to present my body as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God now friends we already know we already know that we can't get holy enough we can't make up ourselves good enough but in this sense we are presenting ourselves as holy we're presenting ourselves as set apart I am no longer of this world with all of its confusion I have been called to present my body as a Living Sacrifice holy set apart different than everybody else set apart holy because he wants me set apart be ye holy for I am Holy see we get all tied up in this word holy and we we have in past attempted to get good enough for God and you never will never you will never get good enough for God in and of yourself that's why he presented to you a lamb without spot or wrinkle or blemish it was the perfect lamb because he knew you couldn't do it yourself and all he's asking is that you present yourself on the altar of burnt offering on the altar of sacrifice giving to him everything that you are and everything that you ever will be saying God I'm yours I I just belong to you now this is real easy to say in the right atmosphere when everybody around you is doing the same thing it's so easy to say Here I Am Lord when you leave this building and you meet old friends or you encounter a situation at work that is that is just horrible and the the world has this tendency to encourage us to take our rights we live in leod deia the age of people's rights everybody wants their rights even we in this church want our American rights we want what belongs to us we don't want the IRS coming and checking out what we get give and what we receive we want our rights we want to possess a gun we want to possess what belongs to us we don't want the EPA telling us that we can't build on a piece of land because it's got some special frog on it you know we want our rights these are all things that Humanity deals with including believers and all of this is is our journey in life that God has put before us every individual has their own situations that they're dealing with or on a daily basis because God knows what you are made of and he knows the right place to plow so when he starts plowing the first thing that we're we're inquiring of his Temple and this is the temple we're not we're we're we're allowing the Tabernacle in the wilderness to be a pattern for us because God was not looking to dwell in in four walls he was not looking even to dwell permanently in those curtains he wasn't looking to dwell in a box behind a curtain he's looking to dwell in a human vessel one that he could fully take control of and he demonstrated it to us by by stepping uh out of glory and taking on a phys physical human body and coming into the Earth taking on the nature and the form of a man and walking this journey for three and a half for 33 and a half years to demonstrate that it was possible though he was tempted in every way as we are yet without sin he was demonstrating that it could be done no matter how deep the plow went that could be a human that would overcome everything that the enemy threw at them so the first thing is to present yourself on the altar now between the altar the burnt offering and the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation the scripture tells us that there was a Labor uh a bowl a labor for washing it's my understanding that this labor that they took the looking glasses of the women and melted it down and and made this labor so that not only were you washing you also had Looking Glass to be able to make sure perhaps that all the blood was off of you before you went in to do the duties inside the Tabernacle of the congregation and and we are in this same position after we have laid oursel on the altar we go for baptism ISM remember we're after we've repented we're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins in Ephesians chapter 5 we read in verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word now why does he do this that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so in the in the older Covenant a typical person who was not a a priest was only allowed to come so far then only the priests were allowed to progress and so uh they they couldn't come any farther the the the humanity at large could not come any further than the courtyard of the Tabernacle of the congregation but we have been made see the enemy wants to keep you out he wants to keep you from your full manifestation in the end time and so he does everything that he can to disqualify you but I would like to remind him today that we have been made Kings and Priests unto our God now wait a minute kings were not allowed into the Tabernacle only the priests were we can read in Scripture about kings that were that were uh that that tried to go in they tried to usurp the authority of a priests and it didn't end well for them yet God we have been told in the scripture we have been made Kings and Priests unto our God that is why that we cannot live under a levitical priesthood but we have been called under a MDC priesthood we have been called as Kings and Priests we have the ability uh we have we have been given authority to to conduct business and we have also been granted the access into the holy of holies also in First Peter chapter 2 verse one wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a Lively Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious you also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so you as royal priesthood are privileged now not only to be in the outer court but you have been invited into the holy place so we proceed into the holy place and it is a privilege as a priest to enter into this place into the Tabernacle where the where there is the altar of incense the table of showbread and the Seven Branch Candlestick so the altar of incense we want to look at because this is all a part of what God is is is is using to plow into to to to look into our lives because he wants us to be totally surrendered to him totally yielded to him fully capable of carrying out the Priestly work and not having Upon Our conscience all the stuff that has kept us out in previous times so we look to Exodus chapter 30 where the Lord told Moses make an altar of burnt incense of sham wood Thou shalt make it and he gives the size of it in verses 2 and three tells how to Overlay it in the gold rings and how that these staves uh that are going to go through these rings are made of the same wood that the altar is made of and they're to be overlaid with gold and he said that it was to be put before the veil verse six you're going to put it before the veil that is by the Ark of the testimony before the mercy seat that is over the testimony where I will meet with you and Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn incense thereon and when Aaron lights the lamps at even he shall burn incense upon it a Perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your Generations you shall offer no strange incense thereon nor burnt sacrifice nor meat offering neither shall you pour out drink offerings thereon and Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements once in a year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your Generations it is most holy unto the Lord so now we're inside of the Tabernacle we're speaking of the altar of incense we see from the scripture that at the altar of incense the priest was to bring in incense something uh something that was of a sweet SM smell if I may put it in more modern terms to those of you who use essential oils in your homes and you burn or or most of the time it's put in water and and comes out in a vapor uh it was not so there with with um with the altar of incense because there was a burner it actually burnt and it created a smell and a smoke now what was happening this this this incense that was to be used in the Tabernacle was also holy or set apart it was not an oil that you could take home with you the priests were not permitted to take it home with them and and and uh anoint all of their house and and have a burner in their house to make their house smell lovely like the Tabernacle it was a set aart oil that was only to be used in the Tabernacle see God separates his stuff he doesn't want it to be common with all the rest of your life he wants to be he wants it to be set apart holy for his use that's why we dress the way that we dress that's why that we conduct ourselves the way we conduct ourselves because we are not commoners preacher are you calling the rest of the world commoners I'm saying that they have not yet recognized if they are ever going to be that they're set apart holy unto the Lord I'm just letting the world know I've been set apart holy unto the Lord and I'm going to act different I'm going to dress different I'm going to talk different I'm going to sing different I'm going to play different music I'm not going to have all the same things as the rest of the world but when God called them to offer this incense on the altar of incense it was to create atmosphere it was to create an atmosphere inside of the Tabernacle or inside of the Holy place because God was there there he was present and he had it positioned in front of the veil that led into the holy of holies and he wanted that uh he wanted that the smoke of that and the smell of that the Bible tells us that it was a sweet smelling saver that was offered up on this uh altar of incense now I want to also point out that he was to put the altar of incense when he came into the Tabernacle in the morning to trim the Wicks of the manora and to add oil back to the bowls that the Wicks were down in and then the Bible says that he came again with that incense in the evening when he came to light the holy manora in the evening time now that was once in the morning once in the evening that was daily the Bible also says that when Aaron was to go in I I'm I'm going to make an assumption here I've not fully read and understood but it says that he was to take the blood that he was going to take into the holy of Hol that he was going to anoint the horns of the altar of the altar of incense once a year just as he was going to take the blood into the holiest place so we recognize that this is a smell to create an atmosphere we read David said in Psalm 141:2 let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice we read in Revelation 5:8 when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb Hing every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints also in chapter 8 of The Book of Revelation another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of All Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand now this sweet smelling incense we read there in Psalm 141 that David is saying let my prayer be let it be set forth before thee as incense so when we crawl out of bed in the morning our incense will not so not smell so sweet if it is our wish list for the day when we wake up in the morning we want our prayer to be a praise that is lifted up to the Lord I Thank You Lord that you have kept me uh through the night and you have awakened me to see the dawn of another day and my lips will praise you and sing forth your praise today and begin our day then in such a manner that it's an incense that rises up to him as a sweet smelling saver we're in the Tabernacle we as a priest are offering our incense unto the Lord and if all we ever do is complain before the Lord or offer of up to him all of our wish list or all of our prayer lists there's a time for that but we want when we come in the morning we want it to be a sweet smelling Savor unto him a praise lifted up to him a joyful attitude lifted up unto him because he has given us the grace for another day to start out he has brought us through the night he let us see another day and there are all kinds of things that God has done for you whether it be that moment or something he did yesterday you can thank him for and create a sweet smelling saver you can create the incense in your home or wherever you're at you can create the sweet sell smelling saber to create the atmosphere to start your day and then in the evening David said the lifting of my hands as the evening sacrifice you remember that when the priest in the book of Exodus it states Aaron went in but you as a priest have been honored to be able to go into the Tabernacle to offer unto the Lord sweet smelling Savor this incense on the altar of incense because you have been privileged to do that and he not only is is uh he not only required it in the older Covenant in the morning but he also required it in the evening time and you and I can be have this same blessing of offering to God the sweet smelling Sav in the morning time and in the evening time and all day long because we have been granted a privilege to come into this Tabernacle this holy place and offer to him this sweet smelling Savor all of the time he don't want our leftovers he wants our best so then after we recognize the the auar of incense then we see that the seven Branch candlestick or the manora is there we can read about it in Leviticus 24 command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light to cause the lamps to burn continually without the veil of the testimony in the Tabernacle of the congregation shall Aaron order it from the evening to the morning before the Lord continually it shall be a statute forever he shall order the lamps upon the pure Candlestick before the Lord continually now once again the this this lampstand the Candlestick the candleabra the manora whatever word you want to use whatever makes you comfortable this Candlestick that was in the uh in the uh Tabernacle it represents the light of God we can read about to uh in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 when John turned and he saw the seven Branch Candlestick and he saw the the Lord Jesus standing right in the middle of that Candlestick and he describes what he saw and we know that this is a representation of of the Lord Jesus Christ who is the light of the world um now the the priest was to again go in the morning trim the Wicks replace the oil and in the evening time go back and light the the Wicks once again it uh it it's been written by people smarter than me sages along the way it has been written that the shamash or the servant candle the the one that was above the rest of them that it burned continually I don't know I wasn't there it's sounds like something that God would do that's who he is uh as as as from a human standpoint I don't know how they could trim the wick with the fire still burning I suppose that is possible I don't know but that was the job of the priest was to trim the Wicks every morning trim the Wicks why were the Wicks trimmed when when if if if you've ever messed with a Lantern you find out that when a wick gets to a certain condition it starts being Smoky and this is again about atmosphere it's about conditions of of the inside God didn't want his his his atmosphere to be Smoky from a wick that was that was not trimmed you see uh he is the source of all of our light and it would be just like almighty God to let the shamash burn all of the time because he doesn't need pruned God doesn't need pruned I do but he doesn't and he told us in the New Testament he he he said on one hand he was the light of the world but he also said that we were the light of the world and he doesn't want our Wicks to be uh causing there to be a smoky flame he wants it to be a clear bright flame uh shining out so that people can see that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday and today and forever he wants us to see he wants us to see when the light is burning he wants us to be able to see there's much darkness in the world but he wants us to see there is much to provoke you to anger but he wants you to see as he plows deep into the temple he's inquiring into the temple your temple if anger is something that triggers you he wants you to have light to be able to see when he opens it up he doesn't continue to make you walk in dark Darkness he shines the light of the word onto that place so that you can see maybe what the triggers are what what the what is the root cause of it why that it is there and how that you by the blood of Jesus Christ can get rid of it you can let it be washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't have to remain there friends once again this is things the these are things that we have been hearing over the past weeks and months and I'm just uh I'm just coming to you again today to let you know God ain't done he doesn't want you to forget just because brother Shelly's not he doesn't want you to forget that you got to deal with those offense of those offenses in your life you got to deal with those roots of bitterness in your life he's cutting deep and he wants the light of the word to shine on it he wants you to be able to take the word of God Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my pathway he wants you to be able to take the word and let it illuminate whatever your Vice might be whatever those inner workings are that cause you such a struggle from day to day and let the word of God deal with them yeah let the word of God deal with them let the word work mightily in you you've got to cooperate the word's been there all along the word has been there for years it's been right in these pages that we've carried around under our arms since we was a child some of us it's right there but so often we didn't know what to do with it do you know that our adversary has made us scared to use this he made us scared to use it because that we were angry or because we were bitter or because we were jealous or because we were offended he made us afraid to use the word but friends the word is the only thing that's going to bring us out where the spirit and Truth are mixed together working in our lives that is what is going to bring us the victory that's what is that's what's going to bring us the overcoming portion in the end time and the Lord was is letting the manora be bright he's he's as Priests of our own Temple we want to make sure that the Wicks are trimmed properly and on time we want to make sure that the balls are full of oil we don't want to run out of oil and we want to make sure that they're lit at the proper time and we want the flame to be bright because he wants us to see then he brings us to the table of showbread or the bread of the presence Leviticus 24: 5-9 it talks about how they take fine flour and bake 12 cakes uh thereof two10 deals shall be one cake and you shall set them in two rows six on one row upon the pure table before the Lord and you're going to put Franken pure Franken in sense upon each row that it may be on the bread for Memorial even an offering made by fire unto the Lord now the altar of incense was once in the morning once in the evening the manora was trimmed in the morning lit in the evening the table of showbread was changed out every Sabbath every seventh day the bread was made fresh and brought in and replaced the previous week's bread and then the priests were given the opportunity to eat that bread that was taken up so there's nothing wrong with day old bread every seventh day this bread was made aresh and put on the table of showbread this was the duty of the priest and you and I have been uh we have been honored by the Lord that he would tell us that we uh were privileged to eat of the bread of life in and you remember when he was in the wilderness Jesus was in the wilderness and he was fighting the enemy and the enemy came to him and said you know if you're really who you say you are why don't you you know you're hungry why don't you take these stones and make them into bread well Jesus turned around to him and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God when Jesus said it is written it was Deuteronomy 8:3 he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man live he was wanting to demonstrate to us that there's more to life than feeding our face more than three meals a day Divine Fellowship is what he is Desiring Divine making the Lord Jesus he is the bread of life and he wants to be he wants us to consume the bread of life or the word of God he wants us to consume it and you know all our troubles they're they they're what gets our attention troubles get our attention the enemy came along and he recognized that the immediate trouble of the Lord Jesus was that he was hungry and so he worked on that immediate imediate struggle at that moment the hunger the physical hunger of the Lord Jesus and he said if you are really who you say you are why don't you say to these rocks be bread but Jesus knew that there was something more important than feeding the Natural Body and that was to feed the inner man to feed the spirit and this is all represented in these loaves that are at the table of showbread the they also called bread of the presence we need to do more than feed our face all the time friends we need to be feeded feeding on the living bread on the Living Word on the bread of his presence we need to be feeding on his presence fellowship with the Lord Jesus is more important than natural bread Psalm 34:8 oh taste and see the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusts in him John 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world if I could encourage any of us young and old if I could do anything for you I would encourage you get in the word get in the word many times we go throughout the day and many folks listen to music brings soothing to people some people's makeup is just that they listen to music may God grant you the grace to listen to the right kind of music but if I were to ask someone quote me a scripture could you do it young people if I asked you to quote me a scripture could you do it a lot of you no doubt could quote me the lyrics to a song but you couldn't quote a scripture and then I asked are the lyrics of the song that you're listening to sound Doctrine because there are many songs out there that are not sound Doctrine they're beautiful lyrics and they are full of words that rhyme real well together but they're not sound Doctrine and that is why I encourage you today get in the word take the Bible get you a Bible brother Shelly is has has said this before get you a Bible don't just rely on this get you a paper Bible I know that some of you struggle to read from a paper Bible or a paper book I have struggle reading from this but get a Bible something that the words are written on paper and start reading and start memorizing and underlining and repeating back to yourself and if you have a hard time with that all over YouTube there are Alexander scorby or others that are reading the scripture but don't just listen to it get get the Bible and while you're listening read along and let the word become a part of who you are Let It Be Your Daily Bread because if Man live and cannot live by bread alone three meals a day are not going to sustain you they may sustain your natural body but they're not going to sustain your Inner Man and we're allowing the Holy Ghost to do the plowing we're allowing him to open up we're becoming vulnerable in his presence because he has invited us as priests into his presence now friends he doesn't want us to just stop with the outer Court he doesn't want us to just stop with the inner Court we have been made priests unto our God Kings and Priests and he's inviting us to come farther than that you see in the Old Testament in the Book of Ezekiel the priests got tired of their work and that's the temptation of us as priests we get weary with work we get weary with what God is doing on the inside of us us we get weary of keeping the manora trimmed and the oil filled we get weary of replacing the bread we get weary of looking into the word we get weary of bringing fresh incense in the morning and fresh incense in the evening we get tired of it and that's what was happening in the old Covenant in the Old Testament in the Book of Ezekiel the priests had grown weary with their calling oh friends we cannot afford to get weary in our calling be not weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not and we're being called further than just the holy place but these priests the angel of the Lord came came to Ezekiel and he said I want to show you something and Ezekiel said I saw a hand the likeness of a hand come out of the midst of the pillar of cloud and grab me by the hair of my head and lift me up and he says I got something I want to show to you Ezekiel and he carried him by the spirit and he took him to different places in the in the Tabernacle or the temple whatever it was at that time he took them to different places because he wanted Ezekiel to to see what the priests were doing instead of attending to their duties as a priest they were bowing before Idols women were weeping for tamuz they were sitting with their faces toward the East worshiping the sun oh friends we can't allow any of these things to grab a hold of us and become one of one like those priests where that we're tired of what the Lord has called us to do we've got to get back to the business of a priest the priest of our own Tabernacle the priest of our own Temple we can't allow the enemy to take us down a road where we get tired of what we've been called to do so God keeps presenting to us putting the search light on it making sure that the word is being put in its proper place because he doesn't want us to take on the doctrine of devils he doesn't want us to give heed to seducing Spirits as first Timothy says because the spirit already was speaking in the time of Timothy that in the latter times there would be some that would depart from the faith there would be some who would give heed to seducing Devils there would be some that would give heed to doctrines of devils but we have been called as a royal priesthood that we cannot afford to allow any of this to be transpiring in our lives as the musicians are coming today I would like to read Hebrews chapter 10 verse 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and a living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh the veil of his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the prophetic of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is this Gathering is for a purpose someone to do away with the Gathering Together together but we instructed not to forsake gathering together but we're going to exhort one another and so much more as we see the day approaching we know that this has been given to us uh this this this priesthood has been given to us uh to attend to this Tabernacle there is currently no Temple there is currently no Tabernacle yet the Lord Jesus said he desired to Tabernacle in men and he doesn't just want us in the outer Court offering sacrifice day after day after day after day after day after day constantly feeling bloody because we're so beat down Jesus Christ offered the Supreme sacrifice once and for all and when he did it he made it that he made accessible for us that we could lay down our lives as a Living Sacrifice yes we do daily offer to him ourselves but we keep Covenant with him and and we're not we're not blatant Sinners every day of our life we do mess up but we're not blatant Sinners every day I hope you're not I hope you don't start out your day to commit sin that's who we were that's what we were but that's not who we are now we are called by almighty God to live in this present day in this present age as Overcomers and he's invited us into the holy of holies we're not shut out as they were in the older Covenant but because of the New and Living Way the Lord Jesus Christ we have been called into the holy of holies he desires that we deal with all the stuff in the middle court the soul realm making sure that everything is pruned the way it's supposed to be everything is the Wicks are cut the way they're supposed to be the word is in its proper place the incense is in its proper place but he's calling us into the holy of holies and the scripture talks about when all of the work of the Tabernacle was finished that Moses looked on it and it was all finished and it the scripture states that when man had done all that he could do Moses Aaron the priests bezo all of his helpers when man had done all that he could do then God came down in the pillar of a cloud and the glory settled down around the Tabernacle and I liken this to me to you where that we are cooperating with the Holy Spirit there has been a pattern that has been sent into the Earth for us for this Tabernacle and when me when man when man has done all that he can do there's only so much I can do only so much you can do I don't have the ability to physically get inside of my life with a pair of tweezers and find the little speck of bitterness that's still there and pluck it out if you had that ability if I had that ability for my own self I would be foolish not to do it but I as a priest have been given a way into the holy of holies and I've got to follow the pattern and that pattern involves bringing the the incense in the morning and bringing the incense in the evening part of that is trimming the Wicks to make sure that the light shines brightly so that it can expose things that are in my life that need to be dealt with and again I can't take a pair of tweezers and pluck it out but I can agree with the Holy Spirit to say Lord your light and your word have shined on it and exposed it and I see it and I want you to know that I stand Here willing today to let you pluck it out now most most of us have lived long enough to know that it's some of those things don't disappear as once and done that would be lovely that would be fantastic that we would never have to deal with it again but there are some things in us that we have to let the Holy Spirit deal with over and over and over and over and over again but there is coming a time where that we will cooperate to the fullest extent and the Holy Spirit will remove it from our life friends I am I'm expecting that we are going to see the Promise fulfilled that the bride is going to walk in her maturity in the end time she's going to walk in maturity and there's only so much that I can do and we've had prophetic word through the ears here that when you've done all that you can when you've climbed as as high as you can climb and we at times thought we had gone as far as we could go but then the Holy Spirit came with the search light once again he came with another word once again and said no you really haven't that's right you're trying to wimp out on me you're trying to make this a little easier for yourself but friends there's going to come a time when I have yielded as far as I can yield and I've climbed as far as I can climb climb and that flying eagle anointing is going to grab a hold of me and it's going to Bear me to the top I'm depending on the Flying Eagle anointing it is not a perched eagle it is not a eagle down in the valley molting it is a flying eagle anointing that is for the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time that's going to Bear her up to the top and I am cooperating with the holy spirit all the way through because I am going to be in the holy of holies I'm going to uh let the Holy Spirit have his full sway in me and I when I've gone as far when man has done all that he could do Moses did all that he could do he presented it to the Lord and the Lord came down with a pillar of cloud and the glory came down till the ministers could not Minister because of the glory that was in Solomon's Temple remember and but the glory of the Lord came down when man has done all that he can do we're still cooperating we're still working on this this Soul realm but take courage friends and be not weary in well doing for you shall reap you shall reap in due season if you faint not don't be like the priest in Ezekiel don't get tired of what God has called you to do you keep working you keep agreeing with the spirit keep allowing him to do what he's doing doing let the light of God continue to get on the inside and do what he wants to do let the word work let the word work let the word work and the only way the word can work is if you are in the word all right get in the word because the word still works and it's working mightily in me would you stand with us today father I ask you now that you take these words that you laid on my heart I ask you to take them and let them be what you have desired them to be in the individuals Lord It's striking people differently throughout this congregation I can see that it is striking differently but Lord I believe that your word works exactly the way it needs to when we allow it to work in us and so I am just simply asking let this word do its perfect work what has been spoken today let it work in the Believers hearts and Minds oh Jesus a royal priesthood holy set apart Lord you didn't come to condemn the world you came that they could be saved and Lord I Thank you that I was I was a part of the world and
