[4:22] Happy
[4:30] birthday.
[4:42] Another
[4:55] way.
[5:24] At lasting did my Savior bleed and did
[5:30] my sovereign die.
[5:33] Would he devote that sacred head for
[5:38] such a worm as I?
[5:42] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[5:45] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[5:48] rolled away.
[5:50] It was there by faith. I received my
[5:54] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[5:59] has for crimes that I have done. He
[6:04] groaned upon the tree.
[6:08] Amazingly,
[6:10] grace unknown and love beyond the green.
[6:16] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[6:19] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[6:23] rolled away.
[6:25] It was there by faith I received my
[6:29] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[6:34] Well might the sun in darkness hide and
[6:38] shut his glories in
[6:42] when Christ the mighty maker died for
[6:47] man the creatures sin. At the cross, at
[6:52] the cross where I first saw the light
[6:55] and the burden of my heart rolled away.
[7:00] It was there by faith I receive my
[7:03] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[7:08] Thus might I hide my blushing face while
[7:13] Calary's cross appears.
[7:17] all my heart in thankfulness
[7:21] and melt my eyes to tears.
[7:25] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[7:29] saw light and burdened up my heart away.
[7:34] It was there by faith I received my
[7:38] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[7:43] Alas, did my savior bleed? And did my
[7:49] sovereign die.
[7:51] Would he devote that s
[7:56] for such a one? Hallelujah.
[7:59] Oh, at the cross. At the cross where I
[8:02] first saw the light and the burden of my
[8:06] heart away.
[8:08] It was there by faith. I received my
[8:12] sight and now I am happy all the days.
[8:17] Was it for crimes that I have done? He
[8:22] grown up on the tree.
[8:26] Amazing.
[8:28] Grace unknown and love beyond me.
[8:34] Oh, at the cross. At the cross where I
[8:37] first saw light and the burning of my
[8:40] heart was roll away.
[8:43] It was there by faith I received my
[8:46] sight. And now I am happy all the days.
[8:50] In the course again at the cross, at the
[8:53] cross where I first saw the light and
[8:56] the burden of my heart was thrown away.
[9:00] It was there by faith I received my
[9:03] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[9:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[26:14] where Jesus bled
[26:19] and died for me.
[26:23] I see his womb,
[26:26] &gt;&gt; his hands, his feet.
[26:30] My savior.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[26:34] &gt;&gt; that cursed tree.

[33:16] Hallelujah.
[33:18] I love
[33:20] you Lord
[33:25] and I lift

[33:36] you.
[33:38] Oh my soul. Hallelujah.
[33:43] Rejoice.
[33:47] Take joy
[33:49] my king
[33:54] in
[33:55] what you hear.
[34:01] Let it be a sweet, sweet
[34:07] sound
[34:09] in your ear.
[34:18] I love you, Lord.
[34:25] And I lift
[34:28] my voice
[34:33] to worship
[34:38] you.
[34:40] Oh my soul,
[34:45] rejoice.
[34:48] Take joy, my king,
[34:55] in
[34:57] what you hear.
[35:02] And let it be a sweet,
[35:06] sweet
[35:08] sound
[35:10] in your ear. Take joy, my king.
[35:16] Oh,
[35:18] take joy,
[35:21] my king,
[35:25] in
[35:27] what you hear.
[35:33] Let it be a sweet,
[35:37] sweet
[35:38] sound
[35:41] in your ear.
[35:50] Would you lift up a clap of praise to
[35:52] him who is worthy?
[35:55] Worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb.
[36:00] How we bless you Jesus. We give you
[36:03] praise for you are worthy, worthy,
[36:06] worthy.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:14] He is worthy of all praise and
[36:16] adoration.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; And as we go to prayer today,
[36:21] he is worthy of our praise no matter
[36:24] what our need is.
[36:29] He said with thanksgiving made your make
[36:32] your requests known unto him.
[36:35] That's what we do today.
[36:38] We thank him for who he is and what he's
[36:41] doing. Do you have a need by the lifting
[36:43] of the hand today all over the house
[36:45] there are needs out across the stream.
[36:48] We know there are many needs. where
[36:50] we're remembering brother Daniel and
[36:52] sister Anna in Arkansas packing up
[36:55] brother Eddie and sister Janet Miller
[36:57] getting ready to move this way. We pray
[36:59] for all of them asking the Lord to
[37:01] strengthen them keeping them sound in
[37:03] body and in their minds as all of this
[37:06] transition is happening. We pray for
[37:08] them. Sister Sharon's mother is uh still
[37:13] quite unstable up and down. Oxygen up
[37:17] and down, heart rate up and down, blood
[37:19] pressure up and down. And they both need
[37:24] our prayers today. It's a lot.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; And Sister Sharon can't leave her when
[37:28] she's in that kind of a condition
[37:31] because she's dizzy and she she could
[37:33] easily fall. And at her age and her
[37:35] condition, she doesn't need a broke
[37:37] bone. Ask the Lord to move. Sister Flo,
[37:41] I assume, is still fighting to get
[37:44] better. We want to hold her up to the
[37:46] Lord in prayer. Sister Rebecca Shephard
[37:49] reached out to say she wasn't feeling
[37:50] well.
[37:52] The Yoviches are still in a battle, I
[37:54] guess, to get over all of their
[37:56] sickness. And there are several others
[37:58] that we want to remember to the Lord in
[38:00] prayer. And Sister Anna Christine had a
[38:03] couple of requests for family members.
[38:06] One is an aunt who fell yesterday and
[38:10] recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and
[38:14] fractures to eight eight to 10 ribs
[38:18] and uh those fractures that's horrible.
[38:20] those fractures punctured her lungs.
[38:23] Supposed to have surgery today. A
[38:26] believer, let's pray the Lord to
[38:28] undertake. And and then a request for a
[38:30] brother uh Caleb who was from brother
[38:34] David Morse's church who had an accident
[38:36] yesterday. Thrown from the car
[38:39] &gt;&gt; and it landed on him,
[38:41] &gt;&gt; fractured his pelvis and his punctured
[38:44] his bladder waiting on surgery.
[38:47] Same hospital that Iran is in. That
[38:49] touches my heart. The enemy is out to
[38:52] destroy. But he is a defeated foe.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; He's defeated.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Remember all of those needs that have
[38:58] come in and I have an unspoken request
[39:01] concerning Jerusalem that I'd like for
[39:03] the Lord to give me a complete and total
[39:05] answer about.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of worrying over it. I want
[39:09] his peace and I want I want his answers.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; I think that's all of mine I can
[39:15] remember. Brother Paul Drown needs our
[39:19] prayers. He's fighting a battle,
[39:21] believing God. He was back in the
[39:23] hospital at some point. I don't know for
[39:25] sure if he's there today or not, but he
[39:27] really needs a miracle.
[39:30] Our God is a miracle working God.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Gabriel's sister needs our prayers
[39:38] today. She needs a miracle.
[39:41] Sister Elizabeth
[39:46] Our God is well able
[39:50] to do much more than we could ever
[39:53] dream.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Back in July,
[40:02] we had heard about a young man
[40:05] who is the son of someone that goes to
[40:07] daddy's church.
[40:13] and I saw him at a funeral.
[40:16] He looked all well.
[40:19] This was back in July, but it was just
[40:21] two weeks ago that we heard the
[40:23] testimony.
[40:26] 56 years old, massive stroke,
[40:32] brain bleed.
[40:36] According to the testimony, the doctor
[40:38] that took the clot off of his brain
[40:43] said it was the biggest one that he had
[40:46] ever removed successfully.
[40:49] But still, the side of his mouth was
[40:52] drooped, his arm useless.
[40:57] His
[41:00] dad was in the hospital room
[41:04] feeding him stuff dribbling out of his
[41:08] mouth.
[41:13] Looked out the window,
[41:17] said, "Oh,
[41:19] brother and sister Gley are coming in."
[41:23] That would be my mom and dad.
[41:29] It was at that moment
[41:32] according to his testimony he said
[41:35] everything is going to be all right.
[41:40] Later
[41:41] would tell it was at that moment that he
[41:45] was saved
[41:47] but 10 days later
[41:50] he went back to work.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; No signs of the stroke.
[41:56] a miracle that God had performed.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Our Lord is still the same
[42:04] &gt;&gt; healing Jesus.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and
[42:09] forever.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; We don't know all of the ways of our
[42:13] Lord, but his ways are perfect. And we
[42:17] trust him. No matter what things look
[42:20] like, we trust him because he holds us
[42:23] in his hand.
[42:25] And that's who we look to to today as
[42:28] we're getting ready to go to prayer.
[42:30] Would you sing this course? I cast all
[42:33] of my cares upon you. I lay all of my
[42:36] burdens down at your feet. Brother R.J.,
[42:40] will you get ready to come and pray,
[42:41] please? I cast
[42:45] all my cares
[42:47] upon you.
[42:53] I lay
[42:56] all of my burdens
[43:00] down at your feet.
[43:05] Anytime
[43:08] I don't know
[43:10] just what to do,
[43:15] I cast
[43:17] all my cares upon you. Sing again,
[43:22] please.
[43:24] Oh, I cast
[43:27] all my cares upon you.
[43:35] I lay
[43:37] all of my burdens
[43:40] down at your feet.
[43:45] Anytime.
[43:48] I don't know
[43:50] what
[43:52] to do.
[43:55] I cast
[43:57] all my cares upon you.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I feel very often we find
[44:10] ourselves
[44:12] in the words of that song where we say,
[44:14] "I don't know what to do.
[44:18] And I thank you, Lord, that we don't
[44:20] need to know what to do.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; That's for sure.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Because we serve a father, a God, a
[44:28] risen Lord,
[44:30] &gt;&gt; that is mindful of every need. I thank
[44:33] you, oh God, that you are a high priest,
[44:37] that you ascended on high and then you
[44:41] sat down
[44:44] because the sin question has been
[44:46] answered
[44:47] &gt;&gt; with finality, Lord, because of your
[44:50] blood and the price that you paid.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; And so we come to you today, Lord, as
[44:56] your children.
[44:58] And we do have we we we do, Lord. We're
[45:00] in need and we depend upon you, oh God.
[45:06] And so for every question, Lord, that we
[45:09] carry in our hearts, every need that we
[45:12] have in our lives, we look to you, oh
[45:14] God, as the source, as our provision,
[45:17] and as our provider. Lord, I ask that
[45:20] you would come today and that you would
[45:23] minister to every need and to every
[45:25] heart.
[45:27] Lord that we would be open to receive of
[45:30] your life and your light. Oh God. Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Lord I pray for brother Shelley today.
[45:36] Lord for the need that we have in
[45:38] Jerusalem. Lord I ask for divine clarity
[45:42] to come for strategy. Lord maybe it's
[45:46] not the whole path but the next step. I
[45:48] ask oh God that it would be illuminated
[45:51] that it would be so clear oh God and
[45:53] that we would take it and move in faith.
[45:57] Lord we pray for our sister Flo that you
[46:00] would minister in her body today brother
[46:02] Drown that you would minister your life
[46:05] and your healing. Oh God
[46:08] provision for for healing has been made
[46:11] in the atonement and we lay claim on it
[46:14] today
[46:15] &gt;&gt; in the name of Yeshua the Messiah. Oh
[46:18] God,
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that every lie in our lives
[46:22] would be exposed by your truth.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, that light would have preeminence
[46:28] in this house and in our lives.
[46:33] And we just pray today, Father, that
[46:36] whatever your purpose is for today, for
[46:38] this service, for this moment, that it
[46:41] would be manifested in our lives. Give
[46:44] us ears to hear. Give us hearts to
[46:46] receive, oh God,
[46:49] and come and be praised and glorified.
[46:52] You said, "If I be lifted up, I will
[46:55] draw all men unto me today." And Lord,
[46:57] just draw our hearts and our minds and
[47:00] our lives to you.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; We give you permission, oh God, to have
[47:06] your will in this place. Be glorified,
[47:09] Lord, in the name of Yeshua, the
[47:11] Messiah. We pray. Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise you Lord.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; We give you praise Lord for you are
[47:19] good.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[47:26] To God be glory. Great things he is
[47:30] doing. You may have your seats today.
[47:34] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[47:36] to have you gathered with us. Great is
[47:39] the Lord and greatly to be praised in
[47:43] the mountain of the Lord in the city of
[47:46] his holiness. We're we're we're grateful
[47:49] that we have breath today to be able to
[47:52] praise the Lord.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; We're very glad to have in the service
[47:59] today, Brother Gabriel Tawari and his
[48:02] wife, Sister Rebecca, and their five
[48:04] boys.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, there is five there.
[48:13] Brother Hawk has gone to Ann Arbor where
[48:16] brother Gabriel pastors. He's been there
[48:18] uh several times to minister there for
[48:21] brother Gabriel and the congregation in
[48:23] their outreach ministry that they have.
[48:26] And I'm going to ask brother Gabriel if
[48:28] he'll come and greet the church. And
[48:30] perhaps he and his family have a song
[48:32] they'd like to share with us today, a
[48:34] testimony. Come, brother Gabriel. We're
[48:35] glad that you and your family are in the
[48:37] house of the Lord with us today.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Uh God bless you.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; We bring uh greetings from the Little
[48:57] Flock Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The
[49:00] there's uh certainly many of them who
[49:02] have streamed the service here and our
[49:05] last uh meeting of brother Shelley was
[49:08] probably over 20 uh years ago. I'll I'll
[49:12] tell my uh my memory my last memory of
[49:14] him after service. Brother Wes was
[49:17] trying to convince me to tell it right
[49:18] now, but I'll tell
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Good.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; U but it's it's it's such a such a
[49:26] blessing uh to to uh be here. It's it's
[49:30] been on our heart for nearly a decade to
[49:32] come and and visit and we've been
[49:35] praying about it for for a long time and
[49:37] and the Lord opened a door. So, we are
[49:39] so happy uh to be here and worship uh
[49:42] with with all of you and just enjoy the
[49:44] word uh this this morning. Maybe I could
[49:47] read a scripture. And we we've we've had
[49:51] uh un unfortunately our our entire
[49:53] church got hit with this sickness that's
[49:55] going around and uh we we had hoped to
[49:58] prepare a song but we we may we may try
[50:00] to do something anyhow um if we can get
[50:03] enough breath to sing but I'm going to
[50:05] read from uh St. John chapter 15 two
[50:08] verses and uh then I'll
[50:12] uh call my family up and introduce them
[50:17] to you. This is uh John chapter 15 and
[50:21] verse 8. And it says, "Herein is my
[50:23] father glorified
[50:25] that you bear
[50:27] much fruit."
[50:30] &gt;&gt; So shall you be my disciples.
[50:33] And maybe we could jump down to verse
[50:36] 16. You have not chosen me, but I have
[50:39] chosen you
[50:41] &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should go and
[50:43] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[50:46] should remain. Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; That whatsoever you shall ask of the
[50:50] father in my name, he may give it to
[50:53] you. And these are precious scriptures
[50:56] uh to me. Few years ago, I I wrote a
[50:59] song kind of uh along the theme in uh
[51:02] John 15. And it always encourages me
[51:05] whenever I come to the Lord that it
[51:07] wasn't my idea to come to him, but it
[51:09] was his idea that that I come to him.
[51:12] And
[51:13] &gt;&gt; and it's not God's idea that we be poor,
[51:15] but it's God's idea that we we be
[51:17] fruitful
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and he gets glory. And you know,
[51:20] sometimes
[51:22] we we look up at the at the sunrise or
[51:24] the sunset or the earth and we admire
[51:27] the beauty of the Lord and we see the
[51:28] glory in that. But the the the way he
[51:31] wanted to get the most glory was in his
[51:33] church.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And uh and I I still have trouble
[51:37] wrapping my mind around it because it's
[51:38] so humbling that he would he would want
[51:40] that. Uh but the the song we're going to
[51:42] sing maybe family could could uh come
[51:44] up. I'll I'll say the words before I
[51:46] sing it just in case I lose my breath.
[51:49] We've been we were trying to sing at
[51:50] brother Hawk's house the other night and
[51:52] I I could get a few words out and start
[51:54] uh coughing but we trust it'll be
[51:55] better. But the the song the words of
[51:57] the song say, "I am yours, O Lord. I
[52:00] belong to you."
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, I belong to you. You have bought
[52:05] me with your precious blood. My life is
[52:08] not my own. So use me for your glory and
[52:13] overflow
[52:14] so all men may know
[52:17] &gt;&gt; the living God is alive in me.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Christ is alive in me. The second verse
[52:23] says so let me heir abide in you and you
[52:27] abide in me and let your words abide in
[52:30] me and open up my heart to ask according
[52:34] to your will.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. and glorify and glorify the father
[52:39] in the fruit I bear as your joy becomes
[52:44] my own.
[52:46] And then there's a a little bridge where
[52:48] it gets a little the the tempo changes a
[52:50] bit and it says, "So glorify yourself.
[52:52] Glorify yourself. Glorify yourself in me
[52:56] and open up my heart to ask within your
[52:59] will. Glorify yourself in me." And so,
[53:04] um, I'll introduce my family quickly.
[53:06] This is my lovely wife, uh, Rebecca. Uh,
[53:09] this is my oldest, Amen. And then we
[53:12] have Isaiah and Timothy
[53:15] and Abel. And let's let's let's go. So,
[53:18] we're not hiding behind the pulpit.
[53:21] All right. And this this this is Adam,
[53:23] Michael. All right. Okay.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, so um what should should I Is
[53:32] there a microphone at the at the piano?
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So we can Yeah, you can
[53:39] if if you catch the word I I wish I
[53:41] would have got the words um up there so
[53:43] that you could have uh sung it with me,
[53:45] but if you catch the words while we're
[53:46] singing it, please please uh join along.
[53:48] This I I wrote wrote the song to be sung
[53:52] as kind of like a hymn congregational.
[53:55] So that was that was the idea.
[54:09] Some of you met sister's parents,
[54:11] brother and sister. They were here once.
[54:36] I know you share with me share with me
[54:38] all day.
[55:26] I am yours, oh Lord. I belong to you
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Lord. I belong to you.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; You have bought me with your preious
[55:46] blood. My life is not my own.
[55:53] So use me for your glory
[56:00] and overflow
[56:03] and overflow.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; How does it go after that? Lost
[56:08] &gt;&gt; the guy.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; No, that's not it. I forgot my own song.
[56:13] Let me start it over.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; I am yours, O Lord. I belong to you.
[56:23] Lord, I belong to you.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; You have bought me with your preious
[56:34] blood. My life is not my own.
[56:42] So use me for your gloryy
[56:48] and overflow
[56:51] so all men may know the living God is
[56:57] alive in me.
[57:00] Christ is alive in me.
[57:06] Oh, let me air abide
[57:11] in you and you abide in me.
[57:19] And let your works abide in me.
[57:25] and open up my heart
[57:31] to ask according
[57:35] to your will. And glorify
[57:41] and glorify
[57:43] the father in the fruit I bear. As your
[57:51] joy becomes
[57:53] my own.
[57:57] So glorify yourself.
[58:02] Glorify yourself.
[58:05] Glorify yourself in me.
[58:11] And open up my heart to ask within your
[58:16] will.
[58:18] Glorify yourself in me. That part's
[58:22] easy. You can sing it with me. So
[58:25] glorify yourself.
[58:28] Glorify yourself.
[58:31] Glorify yourself in me.
[58:37] And open up my heart to ask within your
[58:42] will.
[58:44] Glorify yourself in me.
[58:50] I am yours, oh Lord. I belong to you,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Lord. I belong to you.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; You have bought me with your preious
[59:10] blood. My life is not my own.
[59:18] So use me for your glory
[59:25] and overflow
[59:28] so all men may know the living
[59:34] God is alive in me.
[59:40] Christ is alive
[59:44] in me.
[59:49] Praise God.
[1:00:00] Beautiful.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you
[1:00:22] for that beautiful song that the Lord
[1:00:26] gave to you that we could worship
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; him.
[1:00:30] It's what the Lord wants it. He wants to
[1:00:33] be glorified through us.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] Well, it is 2026.
[1:00:41] You write a check, you have to learn to
[1:00:44] write a new number on it. Young people
[1:00:47] don't know much about writing checks
[1:00:49] these days. Everything is digital. I
[1:00:53] still live in the Ice Age. I mean,
[1:00:56] um,
[1:00:58] I'm an old guy that still writes checks
[1:01:03] and I got the first one right and I got
[1:01:06] the second one right and that's all I've
[1:01:07] written. So, so far so good.
[1:01:11] But it is a new year, 2026.
[1:01:15] Jesus Christ is still alive as much as
[1:01:18] he was in 2025 and even more so to the
[1:01:22] bride of Jesus Christ because she is
[1:01:25] pressing on to the higher calling in
[1:01:28] Christ Jesus knowing that he is
[1:01:31] perfecting the elect lady
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; in this end time getting her ready for
[1:01:37] that catching away. We have had a
[1:01:40] mindset in time past that we were just
[1:01:44] going to be sucked out of here and
[1:01:48] that it wouldn't matter what condition
[1:01:50] we were in nearly. But the Lord is
[1:01:53] revealing to us that he's bringing an
[1:01:55] elect lady to her perfection
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; to get her to that point where that
[1:02:01] there is that catching away where that
[1:02:04] the dead in Christ shall rise first and
[1:02:06] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:02:09] be caught up with them and those of us
[1:02:11] that are left here are being made
[1:02:14] perfect in the image of Jesus Christ. We
[1:02:17] cannot do it in and of oursel but
[1:02:20] precept upon precept
[1:02:23] gradually gradually gradually suddenly
[1:02:26] that is the way the word is working in
[1:02:28] our lives and we're here today for
[1:02:30] another installment of the word of God.
[1:02:34] Before we do we're going to receive the
[1:02:36] tithe and the offering. I'm going to ask
[1:02:38] brother Ias and brother Austin Yantis to
[1:02:41] uh come to you for the tithe and
[1:02:43] offering today. Give as giving unto the
[1:02:45] Lord. The Lord is working mightily and
[1:02:48] we want to remain a part of what he is
[1:02:51] doing, what he has called us to, staying
[1:02:54] in our lane, not trying to do somebody
[1:02:56] else's job, but we're trying to fulfill
[1:02:59] the commission that the Lord gave to us.
[1:03:01] And as we give to the Lord, we give to
[1:03:04] him and we bless you in the name of the
[1:03:07] Lord. Would you sing this song as we're
[1:03:10] uh giving to the Lord and as we're
[1:03:12] preparing our heart for the preaching of
[1:03:14] the word today?
[1:03:18] I'm not on
[1:03:21] an ego trip. I'm nothing
[1:03:26] on my own.
[1:03:30] I make mistakes and often slip.
[1:03:36] Just common flesh and bone.
[1:03:42] But I'll prove someday
[1:03:45] just what I say. I'm of a special kind.
[1:03:54] When he was on the cross,
[1:04:00] I was on his mind.
[1:04:05] Yes, he knew
[1:04:08] me.
[1:04:11] Yet he loved
[1:04:14] me.
[1:04:19] He whose glory makes the heaven shine.
[1:04:30] so unworthy
[1:04:36] of such mercy.
[1:04:43] Oh, when he was on the cross,
[1:04:51] I was on his mind.
[1:05:01] The look of love was on his face. The
[1:05:07] thorns were on his head.
[1:05:13] The blood was on that scarlet robe. It
[1:05:20] stained it crimson red.
[1:05:25] Though his eyes were on the crowd that
[1:05:31] day, he looked ahead
[1:05:35] in time.
[1:05:38] When he
[1:05:41] was on the cross,
[1:05:46] I was on. Will you stand with us? Yes,
[1:05:51] he knew
[1:05:54] me.
[1:05:57] Yet he loved
[1:06:00] me.
[1:06:05] He whose glory
[1:06:09] makes the heaven shine.
[1:06:17] So unworthy.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. of such mercy.
[1:06:29] Yet when he was on the cross,
[1:06:37] I
[1:06:39] was on. Sing again. Oh, he knew
[1:06:45] me.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; He knew me.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; He knew me. Yet he loves
[1:06:52] you.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; He whose glory makes
[1:07:02] the heaven shine.
[1:07:08] I was so unworthy.
[1:07:14] Yes. of such mercy.
[1:07:21] Yet when he
[1:07:25] was on the cross,
[1:07:30] I was on his mind. Sing just a little
[1:07:35] more.
[1:07:36] The look of love
[1:07:39] was on his face, and the thorns
[1:07:44] were on his head.
[1:07:48] And the blood was on that old scarlet
[1:07:53] robe. It was stained a crimson red.
[1:08:01] And though his eyes were on the crowd
[1:08:06] that day, he looked ahead
[1:08:11] in time.
[1:08:14] For when he was on the cross,
[1:08:20] he had his little bride
[1:08:24] on his mind. For he knew me.
[1:08:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:08:32] Yet
[1:08:35] he loved me.
[1:08:37] I don't know how. I don't know how he
[1:08:40] could
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; his glory makes
[1:08:46] the heaven shine.
[1:08:53] Oh,
[1:08:57] so unworthy
[1:08:59] of
[1:09:01] such mercy.
[1:09:07] Yet when he was on the cross
[1:09:20] yet when he was on the cross,
[1:09:28] I was on
[1:09:31] his mine.
[1:09:36] And
[1:09:37] he walks
[1:09:40] with me. And he talks
[1:09:46] with me.
[1:09:48] And he tells
[1:09:51] me I am his own.
[1:09:58] And the joy
[1:10:02] We share
[1:10:04] as we tear
[1:10:08] there
[1:10:10] none other
[1:10:13] has ever.
[1:10:16] Thank him one more time that he walks
[1:10:18] with you and he walks
[1:10:23] with me and he talks
[1:10:31] And he tells
[1:10:34] me
[1:10:36] I am his own.
[1:10:41] And the joy
[1:10:45] we share
[1:10:47] as we tear
[1:10:51] there.
[1:10:53] Another
[1:10:56] as ever
[1:10:58] known.
[1:11:01] Can we give the Lord another hand clap
[1:11:04] of praise? He's worthy of them all.
[1:11:07] Bless his name. Bless his wonderful,
[1:11:11] holy name. Thank you for your presence,
[1:11:15] Lord. Thank you for your wonderful love
[1:11:18] to us today. Thank you for every
[1:11:21] blessing.
[1:11:22] We praise you. You may be seated for
[1:11:25] just a moment. It's wonderful to see you
[1:11:28] in the house of the Lord today. I can't
[1:11:31] say that many of you seem chipper, but
[1:11:33] you're here and that's a blessing. And
[1:11:37] uh maybe you will press into something
[1:11:40] before you leave and you'll perk up a
[1:11:42] little bit.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; That's your first warning.
[1:11:49] We we have so much to be motivated about
[1:11:54] the goodness of God. Uh one year behind
[1:11:59] us and a and a fresh spanking brand new
[1:12:02] one ahead of us. And as brother Gley so
[1:12:05] beautifully said, Jesus is Lord. He's
[1:12:08] Lord over here just like he was Lord
[1:12:10] over there.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praises. And
[1:12:14] uh this too shall pass and the church
[1:12:17] will be full again. all this sickness
[1:12:19] will be over and we'll see our our folks
[1:12:21] again. Some have been out. Uh I didn't
[1:12:24] mention Sister Megan Kino, but she
[1:12:26] reached out. She's still not feeling
[1:12:28] well. And several others, but they're
[1:12:30] they're pressing on and we know where
[1:12:32] our healing is. And some are just being
[1:12:35] particularly kind to us because they
[1:12:37] know uh how things are easily
[1:12:41] transmitted
[1:12:42] uh through a church of a a little family
[1:12:45] church like this where we're close to
[1:12:47] one another. Uh I want to uh give God
[1:12:50] praise for a beautiful tribute to Sister
[1:12:53] Williams on Tuesday evening. The
[1:12:56] presence of the Lord was here. Thank you
[1:12:58] for being here. We had a wonderful
[1:12:59] number here and a wonderful meal
[1:13:02] afterwards and all of you folks who
[1:13:05] without complaint cooked amazing meal
[1:13:09] and and brought it and served the family
[1:13:12] and it was just it was wonderful. It was
[1:13:15] what I desired that it would be a
[1:13:17] fitting tribute for a life well-lived
[1:13:20] among us. And uh I'm just thankful that
[1:13:23] she's safely home and I'm looking
[1:13:26] forward to a a a glad reunion on on on
[1:13:31] the sunny banks of sweet deliverance.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to it.
[1:13:38] I I wouldn't care if it was sooner
[1:13:41] rather than later. I am so thankful for
[1:13:45] it's more than a promise to us. It's a
[1:13:47] reality.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; That realm is real. It's more real than
[1:13:51] the one we're walking in this morning.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I assure you of that. Uh we want to give
[1:13:56] God praise for uh all that was
[1:13:59] accomplished then uh for that evening.
[1:14:01] And we're glad to be gathered in the
[1:14:03] house of the Lord again today.
[1:14:06] No need to uh have a meeting to say
[1:14:10] goodbye to the old year and uh and hello
[1:14:13] to the new year. this uh is just about
[1:14:16] as uh rooted in in pagan things like
[1:14:20] like some of the other celebrations that
[1:14:22] people love. God doesn't keep the pope's
[1:14:25] calendar.
[1:14:28] Uh he doesn't he doesn't keep the pope's
[1:14:30] calendar. He made his own. He created
[1:14:32] his own and he moves by that. And we're
[1:14:36] thankful that we have some
[1:14:37] understanding, not all, but we have some
[1:14:40] understanding of the times and the
[1:14:42] seasons of the Lord and that they they
[1:14:44] move by God's design and not by not by
[1:14:49] the Catholic system. Very thankful for
[1:14:52] that. Today is Joshua Rivers's birthday.
[1:14:55] Where is he? Is he out? No, he's up in
[1:14:57] the sound booth. Today is Joshua
[1:15:00] Rivers's birthday and I'm very happy to
[1:15:02] be in the house of God with him today.
[1:15:05] and wish him a very happy birthday. I
[1:15:07] appreciate all of his help.
[1:15:14] He's very kind and very helpful to me
[1:15:16] and I appreciate it very much many many
[1:15:18] many times behind the scenes and I'm
[1:15:21] very thankful for that. Uh we want to uh
[1:15:25] also uh mention that today is Miss
[1:15:29] Wanda's birthday and many of us have uh
[1:15:32] loved her as a sweet and dear friend
[1:15:34] through the years. And I mention it
[1:15:36] because for many years Joshua and Miss
[1:15:39] Wanda celebrated their birthdays
[1:15:41] together and we had a wonderful time.
[1:15:44] And so if if she crosses your mind uh
[1:15:47] today or in the future, lift her up to
[1:15:49] the Lord. Uh that God's perfect plan
[1:15:52] always be accomplished in her life. She
[1:15:54] has been a sweet friend to Stacy and I
[1:15:56] and a and a real sweet encouragement
[1:15:58] through the years. TW 25 years ago
[1:16:02] today, I was carried in the spirit and
[1:16:06] saw a beautiful white eagle dropping a
[1:16:10] pyramid, a capstone into the water. And
[1:16:14] I watched the waters roll back,
[1:16:18] disintegrating the bank, and I saw the
[1:16:22] goodness of God and the promise of of a
[1:16:25] better day, a brighter day for this
[1:16:27] little bride. I still believe it 25
[1:16:30] years later. I I know that it hasn't
[1:16:33] completed, but it's it's coming. And may
[1:16:36] we walk through 2025
[1:16:40] behind us, 2026 now ahead of us. May we
[1:16:43] walk through it believing God for for
[1:16:45] Zachariah's grace. Grace, we need it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; We need it. We need grace. Grace to keep
[1:16:52] moving forward. Uh can you say amen?
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And we missed some birthdays last week.
[1:16:58] I always have them wrote down, but
[1:17:00] sometimes we're directed and we get up
[1:17:02] here and our thoughts are already on
[1:17:04] something else and we we forget to
[1:17:06] mention it. So, I'm just going to
[1:17:07] pretend like uh these are current.
[1:17:11] They're no longer current. But we have
[1:17:14] brother Brent and Sister Trish back uh
[1:17:16] from uh Tucson. They were gone about
[1:17:18] what two months it seemed like. Not to
[1:17:21] them, but to us. And they had a 10year
[1:17:24] anniversary while they were gone. I
[1:17:26] think they'll make it 10 years. So,
[1:17:29] we'll say happy anniversary to them. We
[1:17:32] enjoy their friendship and the
[1:17:34] fellowship that we have with them. Uh,
[1:17:36] also Zachary's birthday was Tuesday and
[1:17:39] we didn't mention it in the service on
[1:17:42] Tuesday night being a memorial, but
[1:17:44] we're thankful for him. Uh, I still can
[1:17:48] see him uh little baby in a carrier uh
[1:17:53] in the parking lot of Brother Baker's
[1:17:55] church in Tucson. And uh Sister Alita
[1:18:00] showing him off to me in the in the back
[1:18:02] of the church outside. And now uh he's a
[1:18:06] big boy, all grown up. Not as big as he
[1:18:10] was though, but he's all grown up and
[1:18:13] he's got amazing family of his own. And
[1:18:18] I I'm glad to mention his birthday. And
[1:18:20] Sister Wagner,
[1:18:22] uh, Guju's
[1:18:24] sister Judith's mom had an 88th birthday
[1:18:28] this week behind us, and we thank God
[1:18:31] for her life. And then Hawk, he slipped
[1:18:34] in with the birthday, and he is
[1:18:37] certainly getting old. I
[1:18:40] he used to be young and and now I'm old
[1:18:45] like the scripture says. But anyway, uh
[1:18:47] I love him. I'm so thankful for him.
[1:18:50] Tiffany had a birthday. I don't see her
[1:18:51] this morning, but she had a birthday
[1:18:53] yesterday. And Sophia had a birthday. Is
[1:18:57] that right? Sophia's birthday. And she
[1:19:00] turned three, four.
[1:19:03] My goodness. I don't know how this
[1:19:04] happens. Did I miss somebody? Did I miss
[1:19:08] somebody this coming week? Praise the
[1:19:10] Lord. All that stuff is over. Thank God.
[1:19:13] We're done with that. Amen.
[1:19:15] Is there anything else
[1:19:19] we're looking forward to? We don't know
[1:19:21] what our February meeting will look
[1:19:23] like, but we're already looking forward
[1:19:24] to that. And appreciate that beautiful
[1:19:27] reel that they released this week. And
[1:19:29] boy, doesn't it just make you want to
[1:19:31] praise the Lord? One little brother was
[1:19:34] concerned about the fact that that
[1:19:36] wasn't a hymn. Well,
[1:19:42] I love hymns. Let me say it again. I do
[1:19:45] believe in hymns. I love hymns. Hymns
[1:19:49] are wonderful.
[1:19:50] I grew up with the Redback himnil and I
[1:19:53] don't think they write songs like that
[1:19:55] anymore. They're all amazing. But I
[1:19:58] would like to tell my dear message
[1:20:00] friends around the world that
[1:20:02] inspiration didn't stop with Fanny
[1:20:04] Crosby.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He's still inspiring songs today.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And they don't all have to sound like
[1:20:11] 50s either. They can they don't have to.
[1:20:14] My That's my preference. Everybody knows
[1:20:17] what I like.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; But we don't come to bring what we like.
[1:20:22] We come to to bring what brings him
[1:20:24] glory,
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; brings him praise and honor, and it's
[1:20:28] going to sound a little different, but
[1:20:30] if we sing it unto the Lord with all of
[1:20:32] our hearts, somebody say, "Well, you do
[1:20:34] you know who wrote that?" No, I don't
[1:20:36] always know who wrote it, but I know if
[1:20:39] it resonates with my spirit, and I know
[1:20:41] if it lines up with the word
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; that I know.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And if it's that, then I know that it
[1:20:47] brings honor and glory to the Lord.
[1:20:50] We're blessed this morning. We're just
[1:20:52] blessed to be his children.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And uh there's a lot of uncertainty
[1:20:57] around us, but God is certain,
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; never changes,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; never fails. And have I told you that
[1:21:05] I'll be so glad when my grandbaby gets
[1:21:08] home from Washington State?
[1:21:11] I need her bad.
[1:21:14] And she's coming home Tuesday night. And
[1:21:17] if brother Gabriel will preach a long
[1:21:19] time, then I uh I'll still be awake and
[1:21:21] alert when she gets home on Tuesday
[1:21:23] night late. Thank you, musicians. I I
[1:21:27] want to sing, but I better not.
[1:21:30] God bless you all.
[1:21:33] Let's stand again. Brother Gabriel, it
[1:21:36] is wonderful to have you and your family
[1:21:38] with us. The song was a blessing. The
[1:21:41] fellowship that we had last night was a
[1:21:43] blessing to me. And uh I I I came home
[1:21:47] refreshed. Uh just I don't I don't get
[1:21:51] out too much on a Saturday, but I I'm
[1:21:54] certainly glad that I did. Um there are
[1:21:58] times that
[1:22:00] we can be in a setting like that and we
[1:22:02] feel drained. And there are other times
[1:22:05] we leave a a meeting like that, a little
[1:22:07] fellowship, and we realize that we're
[1:22:10] not drained. In fact, we've gained
[1:22:12] virtue somehow. Ain't that wonderful?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; That's how it ought to be when we're
[1:22:17] with God's people. Now, if you talk
[1:22:19] about football all the time, like some
[1:22:21] of you do, you're not going to leave
[1:22:23] with virtue.
[1:22:26] If you talk about disc golf and all the
[1:22:29] other things that turn some of you folks
[1:22:31] on and make you talk about them all the
[1:22:34] time, you're not going to leave with
[1:22:35] anything extra to get you through. But
[1:22:39] if you'll spend just a little time
[1:22:40] talking about the promises of God and
[1:22:43] his faithfulness to you through the
[1:22:45] years, you'll leave with more than you
[1:22:48] had when you went in.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Because there's something about getting
[1:22:52] those licks of fire together.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry, but you just don't get
[1:22:56] the same portion streaming a service
[1:22:59] that you do when you're there. Thank God
[1:23:01] for streaming. In fact, we have people
[1:23:03] all over. God bless saints in Arkansas.
[1:23:06] That's Miller's there getting ready to
[1:23:08] pack getting packed up and ready to
[1:23:10] come. And love to the saints in southern
[1:23:14] Norway uh today. And uh those brother
[1:23:18] Gossman and and family in Indiana. And
[1:23:22] uh of course I don't know some of these
[1:23:24] handles here. I can't always tell by the
[1:23:27] handle who who they are. Brother Howard
[1:23:29] and uh brother Terrell Howard uh I I
[1:23:32] knew him many years ago. an old friend
[1:23:35] watching in Columbus and other other
[1:23:38] places around the world. Uh I'm thankful
[1:23:41] for those folks and I'm glad that we can
[1:23:44] have a part of their lives. But I think
[1:23:46] they would agree there's nothing like
[1:23:48] being in the in the corporate setting
[1:23:51] where where more than an individual
[1:23:53] anointing is distributed. But the the
[1:23:55] gathering together of the licks of fire,
[1:23:57] like brother Brandham told us, you bring
[1:23:59] all those licks together. My something
[1:24:02] is bound to happen if we come with faith
[1:24:05] believing. Is that right?
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles this
[1:24:10] morning back to the book of Judges.
[1:24:14] It is 12:20
[1:24:16] for the clock watchers. It's about your
[1:24:20] nap time, isn't it? And um we're going
[1:24:23] to go on anyway. I believe God has
[1:24:26] something for us. And I want to go to
[1:24:29] Judges chapter 16.
[1:24:32] And I I think we will
[1:24:36] I I I
[1:24:38] think we'll go back to verse 16. And it
[1:24:41] came to pass when she pressed him daily
[1:24:45] with her words,
[1:24:47] and urged him, so that his soul was
[1:24:50] vexed unto death, that he told her all
[1:24:54] his heart, and said unto her, There hath
[1:24:58] not come a razor upon mine head. For I
[1:25:00] have been a Nazerite unto God from my
[1:25:02] mother's womb. If I be shaven, then my
[1:25:05] strength will go from me, and I shall
[1:25:08] become weak and be like any other man.
[1:25:12] And when Delilah saw,
[1:25:15] and we know this uh this Delilah, her
[1:25:18] name means to weaken, to impoverish, to
[1:25:21] drain. And when Delilah saw that he had
[1:25:25] told her all his heart, she sent and
[1:25:28] called for the lords of the Philistines,
[1:25:30] saying, "Come up this once, for he hath
[1:25:33] showed me all his heart." And then the
[1:25:35] Lord of the Philistines came up unto
[1:25:37] her, and brought money in their hand,
[1:25:39] and she made him sleep upon her knees,
[1:25:42] and she called for a man, and she caused
[1:25:45] him to shave off the seven locks of his
[1:25:48] head, and she began to afflict him, and
[1:25:52] his strength went from him. That's a
[1:25:58] pretty serious thing that was taking
[1:26:00] place in Samson's being. Would you say
[1:26:04] amen?
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And then in verse 20, and she said, "The
[1:26:09] Philistines be upon thee, Samson, and he
[1:26:12] awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will
[1:26:14] go out as at other times before, and do
[1:26:18] what? Shake myself." And he wised not
[1:26:23] that the Lord was departed from him. I
[1:26:27] think that's one of the saddest
[1:26:29] sentences
[1:26:31] and and maybe in the Bible. There's a
[1:26:34] few others that seem to rank up there as
[1:26:37] well.
[1:26:39] I know that he deserved this moment of
[1:26:43] nothingness because of his compromise.
[1:26:46] But my heart's tender toward the servant
[1:26:49] of the Lord. It breaks my heart to think
[1:26:52] that what he had depended on, he so
[1:26:55] casually forfeited
[1:26:58] and then recognized the vacuum of it
[1:27:01] when it was gone and he wished not. Oh,
[1:27:05] he wished not that the spirit of the
[1:27:07] Lord had departed. In in order for that
[1:27:10] to happen, somebody has to wake up and
[1:27:12] realize that he has left. The saddest
[1:27:17] tragedy of churches today is the Lord
[1:27:20] has taken his spirit back and nobody
[1:27:23] seems to notice
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; because they continue in their program
[1:27:28] and going through the motions without
[1:27:31] spirit life. It'll never last. It'll
[1:27:35] never produce life. It'll never bring
[1:27:37] deliverance without the spirit of the
[1:27:40] Lord. It's just motion. It's just
[1:27:42] movement. But it's not spirit movement.
[1:27:45] It's carnal movement and it will never
[1:27:48] work. In fact, as in the case of
[1:27:50] Abraham, what is produced with the loins
[1:27:54] of the mind
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; will bring something forth to mock, not
[1:28:00] to make, but to mock what God desires to
[1:28:04] do. We call every spirit like that down
[1:28:07] in the authority of Jesus Christ. And we
[1:28:10] declare today that the truth of God's
[1:28:14] word will prevail. And we cry out in
[1:28:18] spirit right now to a sleeping bride
[1:28:22] across this nation and through the
[1:28:24] world. Wake up, oh sleeper. Wake up. For
[1:28:28] this is the day of your redemption. This
[1:28:32] is the hour that he would desire not to
[1:28:36] visit you but to occupy you, to change
[1:28:39] you and manifest who he is in you. And
[1:28:43] we just stand against every lying,
[1:28:46] distracting demon of hell that has come
[1:28:49] to woo the the sleep upon the servants
[1:28:55] of the Lord who lay like comeos in the
[1:29:01] lap of Delilah.
[1:29:03] We call for generals to wake up and
[1:29:06] soldiers to wake up. Men of God to wake
[1:29:10] up now. You have slept enough. It's time
[1:29:15] to be alert and to be on the wall. For
[1:29:19] this is the hour that we have waited
[1:29:22] for. The final subduing of every demon
[1:29:27] power that has marched against the
[1:29:29] little bride of Jesus Christ. It's time
[1:29:32] to take our place. It's time to take our
[1:29:35] authority. That which he has invested in
[1:29:39] us. Lord, we thank you that you have not
[1:29:42] left us here to occupy alone, to fight
[1:29:45] alone, but you are in us, not just with
[1:29:49] us, but in us, and you're fighting
[1:29:52] through us if we would so take our
[1:29:55] stand. Lord, even in this house right
[1:29:59] now, we call for sleepers to wake up
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; and hear the voice of the spirit.
[1:30:08] You're not rapture ready and the rapture
[1:30:12] is upon us. Wake up. Wake up. Recognize
[1:30:18] the hour.
[1:30:21] This is our prayer, Lord. This is our
[1:30:24] decree.
[1:30:25] This is what we believe is needed and
[1:30:28] necessary. And we ask for your grace to
[1:30:31] finish it. In the precious name of the
[1:30:34] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the
[1:30:37] saint said,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this morning. He's
[1:30:41] here and we ought to welcome him."
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot to say
[1:30:49] in the message once more. New York, New
[1:30:52] York, paragraph 117, Brother Brandham
[1:30:55] said, "What caused it?
[1:30:58] What was the cause of Samson's fall? He
[1:31:01] let a woman lure him away from the
[1:31:05] promise of God." What is our excuse?
[1:31:08] What has lured us away from the promise
[1:31:10] of God? He said, "That's exactly. We all
[1:31:13] know that he had seven locks." This is
[1:31:15] paragraph 117.
[1:31:19] He had seven locks and he was born. His
[1:31:22] birth path, his birth path was to be a
[1:31:26] what? An oddfellow.
[1:31:29] That's not the lodge. Oddfellow's lodge.
[1:31:34] That's God's nuts.
[1:31:37] You understand? The odd ones. Are you
[1:31:40] embarrassed of us or are you one of us?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "It's all right
[1:31:45] to be one. It's all right to be a nut.
[1:31:48] As long as you're threaded to the right
[1:31:51] bolt." How many of you know who the
[1:31:53] right bolt is?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; His name is Jesus Christ. I want to be
[1:31:57] locked down on him. Don't you?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again.
[1:32:02] And I'm going to give you an opportunity
[1:32:04] to say amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; I want to be locked on to him.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Not just Sunday morning,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; not just Tuesday night, but I want to be
[1:32:12] locked on to him every day. Every day,
[1:32:15] every hour. I don't ever know when he's
[1:32:18] coming.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I don't ever know when he's coming.
[1:32:23] Sometimes he comes on the way to work,
[1:32:27] uh, over to the church. He He comes
[1:32:32] without invitation.
[1:32:35] I want my heart to be ready to receive
[1:32:37] him
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; and I want to hear him
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; sometimes at my desk,
[1:32:43] sometimes in the shower. Don't think
[1:32:45] about it.
[1:32:47] He He comes and I I don't want to be so
[1:32:51] busy with anything or anybody
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; that that I can't welcome him because he
[1:32:56] doesn't come just to come. He comes to
[1:32:59] bring something.
[1:33:01] He's here this morning to bring
[1:33:03] something. How many of you need
[1:33:04] something?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know what I
[1:33:07] need." That's not necessary. You don't
[1:33:10] even have to know what you need. All you
[1:33:13] have to do is get in.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; If the angel of the Lord is troubling
[1:33:17] the water, all you have to do is get in
[1:33:19] the water because he already knows what
[1:33:22] you need. If you need healing, he's got
[1:33:23] it.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; If you need direction, he's got it. If
[1:33:26] you need understanding, he's got it.
[1:33:28] Just get in the water.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And in order to do that, you got to be
[1:33:32] awake.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's grievious to me that some
[1:33:37] folks would uh use this time for for for
[1:33:41] sleep
[1:33:43] when this is a time to be your most
[1:33:45] alert
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; because God has something for us.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; I know that. Not because I'm here. Oh,
[1:33:52] no sir. But because he is. Are you are
[1:33:56] you are you here? That's the question.
[1:33:58] Let's be together. He said, uh, you
[1:34:01] know, uh, he let this woman lure him
[1:34:09] until she shaved
[1:34:13] his
[1:34:15] oddness off.
[1:34:17] The thing that distinguished him from
[1:34:20] all others was his perpetual Nazerite
[1:34:23] vow.
[1:34:24] And the prophet is telling us that these
[1:34:27] seven locks of hair symbolized more than
[1:34:30] just a Nazerite vow. It symbolized that
[1:34:34] which sets him apart from all the others
[1:34:37] around.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what has happened in the
[1:34:41] religious uh religious realm, the church
[1:34:44] realm. That's what's happened. Pentecost
[1:34:47] has allowed the the world, the enemy to
[1:34:51] shave off any oddness.
[1:34:54] any peculiarity that the church used to
[1:34:57] carry because they wanted to be
[1:34:59] politically correct and they wanted to
[1:35:01] be user friendly and seeker friendly and
[1:35:04] the thing that used to set us apart. The
[1:35:07] prayer meeting, the gifts of the spirit
[1:35:10] in operation, the wailing and calling
[1:35:12] out on the Lord, those things have been
[1:35:15] shaved off because they make some people
[1:35:18] uncomfortable.
[1:35:20] And this is what happened. And there was
[1:35:22] no there was no distinction anymore. He
[1:35:26] had laid his head in her lap and that
[1:35:29] which distinguished him from others was
[1:35:32] shaved off. And he said, and that's the
[1:35:34] same thing that's happened to the
[1:35:36] church. And and I want to be real plain
[1:35:38] with you today. I I don't think that it
[1:35:42] would be um you know just
[1:35:47] or fair to just point out there at the
[1:35:51] mistakes that other movements have made
[1:35:54] and other churches have made. I I think
[1:35:57] we have to keep updating if we're going
[1:35:59] to be here another few years. I think we
[1:36:02] we have to keep updating and making sure
[1:36:05] that we're keeping up with what the
[1:36:07] spirit of the Lord desires to do. And
[1:36:10] the reality is we're almost in need of
[1:36:12] another exodus.
[1:36:16] and and uh I think I already made it,
[1:36:20] you know, because we we're called out to
[1:36:23] be called out and and then we we love
[1:36:27] where we are and then we find out that
[1:36:29] the same thing that has happened where
[1:36:33] we were is now happening where we are.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And we need somehow to be called out
[1:36:38] again. This doesn't necessarily mean
[1:36:41] geographically, does it? It just means
[1:36:44] to another realm, to another place, to
[1:36:47] another high spot, following again the
[1:36:50] the marching orders of the King of Kings
[1:36:54] and the Lord of Lords, desiring not to
[1:36:58] fit. There was a tremendous pressure uh
[1:37:02] upon us for many years to fit a system.
[1:37:05] And I'm thankful it was even in my own
[1:37:08] family. I could feel the pressure
[1:37:10] because the young people out there
[1:37:14] didn't understand. We were mocked for so
[1:37:16] many different things. They mocked us
[1:37:19] because our young couples didn't kiss at
[1:37:21] the altar. They mocked us because we
[1:37:24] didn't exchange wedding bands in the
[1:37:26] ceremony. They mocked us because we have
[1:37:29] a a Torah scroll in the church. It's all
[1:37:33] right to have icons, idols, and
[1:37:35] pictures, but don't dare have the first
[1:37:38] five books of the Bible on display. And
[1:37:40] they mocked us for this, and they heard
[1:37:43] somebody prophesy, and they mocked us
[1:37:45] for that. And somebody had a vision, and
[1:37:48] they mock you for that. And someone
[1:37:50] dreamed a dream, and they mock you for
[1:37:51] that. And you feel pressure to fit.
[1:37:56] That's what's happened around the world.
[1:37:59] A pressure has come to fit. But there's
[1:38:03] something on the inside of the inside
[1:38:07] that that rises up in us and says the
[1:38:10] box isn't big enough. Amen. You You
[1:38:14] can't box the anointing in. You can't
[1:38:17] box the Holy Ghost and fire in. You've
[1:38:21] got to let him have his way.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not in it.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is he. There's only one
[1:38:29] eternal spirit of God.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; And he manifested as we understand in
[1:38:34] different ways, but he's now in us.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And he now desires to talk in us, not
[1:38:39] only to us, but in us and through us.
[1:38:43] And he desires to move us uh to a higher
[1:38:47] place of faith because there's a there's
[1:38:50] a work that must be finished. There is
[1:38:53] yet an end time evangelism that must be
[1:38:57] finished. He preached it. You know, it
[1:39:00] must be finished. I I this week I was
[1:39:02] listening to some of the things that
[1:39:04] Brother Brandham said uh about the
[1:39:07] future of the message and what his
[1:39:11] vision was. He even used that term, what
[1:39:14] my vision is to move this thing to the
[1:39:17] nations of the world. And and I'm
[1:39:19] thinking as I read this, here we are
[1:39:23] nearly 60 years later and this has not
[1:39:26] happened. There's not been a training
[1:39:28] place. There's not been much training.
[1:39:32] There hasn't been much understanding on
[1:39:34] on how the spirit of God desires to work
[1:39:38] in an end time bride. There hasn't been
[1:39:41] a lot why he said we we we'll we should
[1:39:43] get together and sit down and talk about
[1:39:45] these things. Well, I've been to some
[1:39:48] efforts uh of that. I've been to some
[1:39:50] carnal uh you know um settings where
[1:39:54] where that seemed to be the purpose, but
[1:39:56] it became just an argument over quotes.
[1:39:59] And how many of you know that doesn't
[1:40:00] produce life? Arguing over scripture
[1:40:03] doesn't produce life. Arguing over
[1:40:05] anything doesn't produce life. But so
[1:40:08] many things that brother Brandham said
[1:40:10] he hoped to see, he wanted to see, he
[1:40:12] longed to see in the furtherance of this
[1:40:15] message, we recognize that it has never
[1:40:17] happened. Some can just chalk it up and
[1:40:20] say, "Well, it didn't happen that way."
[1:40:21] But there's a few of us that read it and
[1:40:23] we catch it and we say, "Lord, if this
[1:40:26] was something you put on his heart, then
[1:40:28] it must yet be." And and if it must yet
[1:40:32] be, we ought to be praying that it come
[1:40:34] to pass. We ought to be praying that it
[1:40:37] move among us. We ought to be praying
[1:40:39] that a final generation of people could
[1:40:41] be prepared as a remnant from the bride
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; because she'll not be bound by any kind
[1:40:50] of denominational system. She'll be
[1:40:52] totally free to worship God according to
[1:40:54] scripture. Do you believe that?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; And she will have thus sayaeth the Lord
[1:40:59] or she will keep still.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I want that. I believe that. I'm looking
[1:41:06] for that. And this was a part of the
[1:41:10] multiplication
[1:41:12] and the distribution
[1:41:14] of this message that the prophet longed
[1:41:16] for. Not a people who would cross every
[1:41:22] uh every tea and dot every eye and call
[1:41:25] it all thus sayeth the Lord, but a
[1:41:28] people that would do as he instructed us
[1:41:32] to do. take it to the word and once you
[1:41:35] see it placed in the word of God, you've
[1:41:38] got a foundation to stand on that all of
[1:41:41] hell cannot move you.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; How many of you know if you're standing
[1:41:45] on the word, not even hell can move you.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; But we need a revelation. We need a
[1:41:51] quickening, an individual personal
[1:41:54] quickening. Uh many have believed that
[1:41:57] because brother Brandham, they've
[1:41:58] recognized brother Brandham, they see
[1:42:00] the ministry of brother Brandham that
[1:42:02] they're going to get a free pass to
[1:42:03] rapture. But that is not the way the
[1:42:06] Bible teaches it.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to require the same life that
[1:42:10] was in Jesus Christ. The magnet draws
[1:42:13] the same life.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You understand? The deep calleth to the
[1:42:17] deep. The magnet only pulls the same
[1:42:20] life that was in Christ. How many of you
[1:42:22] want to be so full of the same life that
[1:42:25] was in Jesus Christ that all of your old
[1:42:29] paradigms crumble
[1:42:32] and you surrender? It's not about more
[1:42:35] effort. It's not even about more uh
[1:42:37] discipline. It's not even about more
[1:42:40] Bible reading, although we must read the
[1:42:42] Bible. And brother Brandon said, "One of
[1:42:44] the things we could never do too much is
[1:42:46] pray." But people get in this religious
[1:42:49] struggle
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; to pray more, to read more. And what
[1:42:54] comes out of that is usually just flesh.
[1:42:59] But if we could surrender and use the
[1:43:01] time that we can capture as quality time
[1:43:06] to be still, to hear his heartbeat,
[1:43:11] you you think you know. I think I know
[1:43:13] what God needs to do for my family. You
[1:43:15] think you need you know what God needs
[1:43:17] to do for your family. The reality is
[1:43:20] unless God shows us we don't have a
[1:43:21] clue.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; But waiting on him can reveal the
[1:43:26] answers.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; And agreeing with him
[1:43:29] can bring results.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't even want to tell you what
[1:43:33] to do.
[1:43:35] I I'm tired of trying to figure out what
[1:43:37] needs to be done in each of their lives.
[1:43:40] I just want what you want for them. Does
[1:43:43] anybody see the value of discovering the
[1:43:45] vision of the Lord?
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; The desire of the Lord for your family.
[1:43:50] Oh, folks, this is uh this is this is
[1:43:53] the hour to catch it. This is the hour.
[1:43:55] There's no doubt about it. Now, I've got
[1:43:57] to move on.
[1:43:59] You see, you're born a peculiar people,
[1:44:01] a holy nation, a royal priesthood. But
[1:44:03] what happened? You've let the world
[1:44:05] shave off your peculiarness
[1:44:08] until you have become
[1:44:11] you you you had to have a denomination
[1:44:14] just like they had. You you had to
[1:44:15] outshine the Baptists, the Methodists,
[1:44:17] and now the Assemblies trying to
[1:44:19] outshine the United. The United Head
[1:44:22] figured out, didn't he?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; It comes a little closer these days.
[1:44:31] the church of God out this and oh my and
[1:44:34] on and on 30 or 40 different
[1:44:36] denominations like the dog returning to
[1:44:39] its vomit the same thing he said notice
[1:44:42] the same thing has been done as it was
[1:44:43] then let Jezebel the mother of harlots
[1:44:46] Revelation 17 remember she was called a
[1:44:48] he said that's an immoral woman a
[1:44:50] woman always represents the church the
[1:44:53] church always represented by a woman
[1:44:56] because Christ one he is coming after
[1:44:59] he's coming after a bride. And she was
[1:45:02] this woman, the mother of harlots, an
[1:45:04] immoral woman. It couldn't have been a
[1:45:06] man. She claims that she is a mother of
[1:45:08] all churches. And she is. And we
[1:45:11] understand what system he's preaching
[1:45:13] about. And what made her a It's
[1:45:16] because she committed spiritual
[1:45:17] fornication. She adopted creeds.
[1:45:21] Oh my, those rotten denominations out
[1:45:24] there.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; What about the creeds that we adopt in
[1:45:28] here? That's right.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Are they also rotten?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; If they're not on the word, they are.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; She adopted creeds instead of her
[1:45:37] husband's word. Instead of becoming a
[1:45:40] rule, true mate to her husband, she took
[1:45:42] another book of creeds. Oh my, could we
[1:45:46] ever have a lot of fun with that? Notice
[1:45:48] now what Delilah did to Samson. She kept
[1:45:51] wooing him. I watched this wooing over
[1:45:54] the past 30 years. I understand it now.
[1:45:57] I didn't understand it then.
[1:46:00] Paragraph 122. The old path of Pentecost
[1:46:03] wanted to stay with the word and they
[1:46:06] adopted pagan ideas through Constantine.
[1:46:10] As Ahab married Jezebel and brought in
[1:46:12] idolatry in Israel, so did the church
[1:46:15] marry into Romanism
[1:46:18] and bring in idolatry right straight
[1:46:21] back in the church again.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Now look out verse 123. Paragraph 123 is
[1:46:26] a little rough here. Now you've got a
[1:46:28] little bunch of harlots
[1:46:30] on the same principles and look what's
[1:46:32] taking place now. Mother is wooing and
[1:46:35] again she's going to shave all your
[1:46:37] rights away from you. God help that.
[1:46:39] We'll never give it up.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; It's the word. It's the word.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; It's the word or death.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; The council of churches putting
[1:46:51] themselves together and uniting in
[1:46:52] fellowship around Rome. Exactly what the
[1:46:54] Bible said it would do. You could preach
[1:46:57] that in any church associated with the
[1:46:59] ministry of brother Brandham around the
[1:47:01] world. You could quote that and you
[1:47:03] could preach that, but you couldn't go
[1:47:05] any farther than that and be likable.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; But the reality is if it's so out there,
[1:47:12] it can also be so in here.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; I can't perhaps change what's out there,
[1:47:18] but I have some say, some factor in what
[1:47:23] goes on in here. Don't you? You do, too.
[1:47:26] And we must never find ourselves in the
[1:47:29] comfort of a system. Whether it's a
[1:47:32] Catholic system or a Pentecostal system
[1:47:35] or a message system, we should never be
[1:47:38] comfortable in any kind of system or
[1:47:41] program other than the program of the
[1:47:44] mind of God, the program of the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost. Anybody with me?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Good. I'm going to keep reading
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; once more. 1963.
[1:47:55] And now Samson, paragraph 47. And now
[1:47:58] Samson thinks of the great victories
[1:48:00] that he had won.
[1:48:02] Oh, the church has many victories behind
[1:48:06] us. The bride church, the message
[1:48:09] church, we have many victories behind
[1:48:12] us. God has been good to us. No doubt it
[1:48:17] come to his mind of how that when he was
[1:48:20] a little boy that God had vindicated
[1:48:24] him. This one was from today
[1:48:28] that God had vindicated him. Told his
[1:48:31] mother how she must do not drink strong
[1:48:36] drinks to watch what she ate. That she
[1:48:40] was bringing forth a Nazerite.
[1:48:43] How she combed his hair. I I wanted to
[1:48:45] read this one because of the picture.
[1:48:49] She combed his hair
[1:48:53] and told him, "Son,
[1:48:55] listen. Through these locks,
[1:49:00] it's a covenant
[1:49:02] with God
[1:49:04] that your strength will lay in there."
[1:49:07] How many of you can see a mother?
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; She was told to eat only clean food.
[1:49:14] that she was also to stay away from the
[1:49:16] things that would defile a Nazerite.
[1:49:18] Though herself she was not under the vow
[1:49:20] of a Nazerite, but she was told because
[1:49:23] of what she was carrying, she should
[1:49:25] separate herself. And so she is combing
[1:49:28] the hair of her son and she is reminding
[1:49:32] him through these locks, you have a
[1:49:35] covenant with God that your strength
[1:49:38] will lay in there. Don't never give it
[1:49:40] away.
[1:49:42] Amen.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; It reminds me of Sister Green telling us
[1:49:45] a story standing in the back of the
[1:49:48] German Center in Tucson.
[1:49:52] Brother Brham is at the back door
[1:49:54] greeting a few people that are left in
[1:49:55] the in the in the hall as the service
[1:49:59] has been long dismissed. And brother and
[1:50:01] sister Green's daughter Janet was
[1:50:03] standing there. And Sister Green said,
[1:50:06] "Steve, her braid was that thick, going
[1:50:10] down her back is just a young girl." She
[1:50:12] said, "You couldn't get your fingers
[1:50:14] around it." And she said, "Brother
[1:50:15] Brandham was standing there. Nobody
[1:50:18] thought anything was on his mind." And
[1:50:20] all of a sudden, he turned to Janet and
[1:50:22] he took the ponytail at the top of her
[1:50:25] head and ran his hand all the way down
[1:50:29] the ponytail and looked her right in the
[1:50:31] eye and said, "Don't ever cut that off.
[1:50:36] Don't ever do anything with that. Just
[1:50:37] leave it like that.
[1:50:40] And Sister Green would cry every time
[1:50:46] because she did.
[1:50:49] When I hear this, I I think of that
[1:50:51] warning.
[1:50:54] Oh my.
[1:50:56] And it happens even around us.
[1:51:00] mother's combing the hair and she says
[1:51:04] you you've got to watch it. It's a
[1:51:06] covenant with God. Don't never give it
[1:51:08] away. Don't never give away your secret.
[1:51:10] Don't never surrender it. Whatever you
[1:51:13] do, Samson, son, stay with it.
[1:51:18] You ought to be telling your family. You
[1:51:20] ought to be telling your children. You
[1:51:22] ought to be telling those you have
[1:51:23] influence over. Stay with this word.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; See it for what it is. Stay with this
[1:51:30] word. You don't want to turn loose of
[1:51:33] your way out of here.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; And it is not our way out. It reveals
[1:51:37] our way out.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; You know, Samson didn't personally cut
[1:51:41] his hair, but he allowed himself to be
[1:51:43] put in a place, a position where it
[1:51:46] could be cut. The Nazerite vow required
[1:51:50] protection
[1:51:51] of one's consecration
[1:51:54] and one's commitment.
[1:51:56] He cries out when he realizes he's
[1:52:00] awakened by Delilah's scream and he
[1:52:03] says, "I'll just do what I always have
[1:52:05] done." And he just shakes himself and
[1:52:08] the spirit of the Lord was not there. He
[1:52:11] got the shake right, but the spirit of
[1:52:14] the Lord was not there because the
[1:52:16] spirit of the Lord moves in covenant
[1:52:18] agreement.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And you you break covenant with God, you
[1:52:22] can't expect the same results. There are
[1:52:25] things that we do by by a church
[1:52:27] tradition.
[1:52:29] Uh, and that's all right as long as it's
[1:52:32] not something that disols the word of
[1:52:36] God.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; But if you're counting on a church
[1:52:39] tradition to bring the glory,
[1:52:42] you'll never never be satisfied because
[1:52:45] you can't do the same thing you've
[1:52:47] always done expecting different results.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; If you want more, you've got to do a
[1:52:52] little more. And that doesn't mean
[1:52:53] strive.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; You see, we have to we have to always
[1:52:58] come back with this balance because we
[1:53:00] you tell religious-minded people to do
[1:53:02] more and what do they do? They work
[1:53:04] harder.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; That only produces sweat. It only
[1:53:09] produces perspiration. What I'm talking
[1:53:12] about is is inspiration.
[1:53:14] And it doesn't mean working more. It
[1:53:17] means resting in a promise and
[1:53:21] surrendering more. And if I understand
[1:53:24] surrender starts by doing nothing, you
[1:53:26] just say, "Here I am.
[1:53:29] Ready, speak, Lord. Your servant
[1:53:32] heareth."
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; What could happen if daddies in this
[1:53:36] place would get up on a Monday morning
[1:53:38] and throw their hands up in the air and
[1:53:40] say, "Speak, Lord.
[1:53:43] Use me at work today and use me when I
[1:53:46] come home for my family tonight. Use me
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; for your purposes.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; I want us to look at this phrase in
[1:53:55] Hebrew. He shook himself. That's a
[1:53:58] Hebrew word, na. And it means to shake
[1:54:01] out, to sweep or to overflow, to shake
[1:54:05] off, to shake violently, to shake
[1:54:08] oneself free of encumbrance, to toss
[1:54:12] off, to shake loose, to snap off as in
[1:54:16] the breaking of a rope or a chain. It's
[1:54:19] the same root word that's used for a
[1:54:22] lion shaking his prey.
[1:54:25] It's the same root word that's used for
[1:54:28] an ox shaking off a yoke of burden. It's
[1:54:33] the same root word in Hebrew as a
[1:54:36] warrior shaking off fear or physical
[1:54:40] shackles. In Samson's mind, he said,
[1:54:43] "I'll do what I've always done. I will
[1:54:45] violently shake my body and supernatural
[1:54:49] strength will be upon me." But it
[1:54:51] doesn't happen this time. He should have
[1:54:54] known it wouldn't happen because from
[1:54:57] the time his mother was combing out his
[1:54:59] hair, he understood this is a covenant
[1:55:01] vow
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; and the blessing and favor and benefit
[1:55:04] only come when the covenant is honored.
[1:55:08] Does anybody understand that we can't do
[1:55:10] our own thing and expect God to bless us
[1:55:13] anyhow? He might. I've seen him do it,
[1:55:18] but he may not. to walk in the favor and
[1:55:21] the blessing of the Lord is to keep
[1:55:23] covenant with him. And it's easier than
[1:55:25] what we have been told because it's by
[1:55:28] relationship that we keep it. It's just
[1:55:31] by staying connected. I think brother I
[1:55:33] think pastor Gabriel sung it right right
[1:55:36] from the word. It's about abiding in him
[1:55:39] and his word abiding in you. That
[1:55:41] doesn't sound like work to me.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; It sounds like surrendering. I I'm I'm
[1:55:47] going to do what you require, Lord. what
[1:55:49] you would have me do above my own
[1:55:52] desire. So it's really not about
[1:55:55] laboring. It's about surrendering.
[1:55:59] He wished not. He did not know at first
[1:56:03] is what this means in Hebrew. It's load.
[1:56:07] He had no awareness. He had no
[1:56:10] discernment. He did not perceive any
[1:56:14] change
[1:56:15] until he shook himself.
[1:56:18] Samson had lost all spiritual
[1:56:20] perception. The Hebrew word that's used
[1:56:24] here is used in other places for
[1:56:27] numbness.
[1:56:28] So it's not that he didn't have any
[1:56:31] sensation.
[1:56:34] He actually had what sounds like a
[1:56:39] numbness.
[1:56:40] It does come with a tingle.
[1:56:43] Your foot ever gone to sleep, your arm
[1:56:45] ever gone to sleep, your hand ever gone.
[1:56:47] It's it's not like you don't feel
[1:56:48] anything.
[1:56:51] There is something there. There is some
[1:56:55] small sensation there, but certainly not
[1:56:58] what he expected.
[1:57:00] A man who was once used to having divine
[1:57:03] eruptions of the spirit of the Lord now
[1:57:06] feels very little, if anything at all.
[1:57:10] That's what makes this such a tragic
[1:57:11] statement.
[1:57:13] Because the Lord was departed.
[1:57:16] Oh Lord, he wishs not that the Lord was
[1:57:21] departed from him.
[1:57:25] David Stern's translation, the complete
[1:57:27] Jewish Bible. But he didn't know that
[1:57:30] Adoni
[1:57:33] had left him.
[1:57:36] It's bad enough that the Lord leaves,
[1:57:40] but it's worse than that, that the Lord
[1:57:42] leaves and nobody knows he's gone.
[1:57:47] Is that is that not a tragedy?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they keep praying and they
[1:57:52] keep singing and they keep quoting
[1:57:56] and they don't even know
[1:58:00] that the Lord has left. When it when it
[1:58:03] when it uh struck Samson, it didn't
[1:58:06] strike him only in the flesh. It struck
[1:58:09] him at the inner core of his being. And
[1:58:12] this word Lord Adoni, this is the divine
[1:58:14] name of God. This is Yode Vave. This is
[1:58:17] the divine name of God that's here. And
[1:58:20] this was the Almighty. The Almighty had
[1:58:24] left him.
[1:58:28] You look at that in the Hebrew, it's
[1:58:30] it's it's uh sar, which is
[1:58:34] the same root that's used for for
[1:58:37] prince.
[1:58:39] Sar shalom is the prince of peace. But
[1:58:42] when Sar is used in this context, it
[1:58:45] means he has removed, he has turned
[1:58:48] aside, he has withdrawn, he has
[1:58:50] departed, he has stepped away, he has
[1:58:53] turned his face from his servant.
[1:59:01] What a tragedy.
[1:59:03] God's presence leaves the camp. His
[1:59:05] favor is withdrawn. his glory moves
[1:59:08] away. And this word is also used a
[1:59:12] couple of times in the Old Testament
[1:59:13] when a covering of protection or a hedge
[1:59:17] has been removed.
[1:59:19] It's the same word. It's like it's like
[1:59:22] what happened to Job when God removed a
[1:59:25] part of the hedge that was protecting
[1:59:27] Job. It was as the Lord was turning his
[1:59:30] face away from Job. But how many of you
[1:59:32] know he didn't forget his covenant with
[1:59:35] Job and he didn't forget his covenant
[1:59:38] with Samson.
[1:59:40] He didn't forget the promises that he
[1:59:42] had made to Samson. And he didn't forget
[1:59:44] that he had chosen Samson to begin the
[1:59:47] deliverance of the of the children of
[1:59:50] Israel from the 40 years of bondage and
[1:59:54] oppression underneath the Philistines.
[1:59:57] It was God himself who had delivered his
[2:00:00] own children into the hands of the
[2:00:02] Philistines. And it was God himself who
[2:00:04] chose Samson to begin the deliverance.
[2:00:06] And even though Samson compromised once,
[2:00:08] twice, three times, and the spirit of
[2:00:11] the Lord eventually had to leave him
[2:00:13] standing there
[2:00:15] defenseless
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; because remember he was an ordinary man
[2:00:20] until the spirit of the Lord fell on
[2:00:22] him.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; He wasn't uh he wasn't Schwarzenegger.
[2:00:25] He wasn't Tony Atlas. He wasn't some
[2:00:28] musclebound godlike man. He was just an
[2:00:31] ordinary uh you know, brother Brandham
[2:00:32] loved to call him a
[2:00:35] until the spirit of the Lord moved on
[2:00:36] him. So now you take that away from him
[2:00:38] and he's not going to deliver himself.
[2:00:42] He's certainly not going to be able to
[2:00:43] deliver
[2:00:46] the children of Israel.
[2:00:48] How tragic this seems.
[2:00:51] It would be hopeless if it wasn't for
[2:00:54] covenant.
[2:00:57] It'd be hopeless.
[2:00:59] But here's what you need to know if you
[2:01:01] don't already know. God is not a man
[2:01:03] that he should lie,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; neither the son of man that he would
[2:01:06] have need to repent. If God said it,
[2:01:09] it's settled.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; It's settled. A and I know they like to
[2:01:15] say, "If God said it, I believe it, and
[2:01:17] that settles it." That only applies
[2:01:20] to you personally
[2:01:22] because if God said it, it's going to
[2:01:24] happen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; With you or without you,
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; God will find somebody. Let me tell you,
[2:01:32] you know, Mr. Thank you so much. God
[2:01:35] will find somebody.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; If he said it, it's settled. My word is
[2:01:41] forever settled in heaven. Look folk,
[2:01:43] this is really uh you know, I know
[2:01:45] there's some a little discouraging thing
[2:01:47] to think about here as a servant of the
[2:01:49] Lord left alone, but there's a lot of
[2:01:51] hope in this because God makes a
[2:01:54] promise.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; he doesn't break it.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Our our unbelief may delay it.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Our absence from the center of his will
[2:02:08] may delay it, but it will not prevent
[2:02:10] it. If God said it, it is so. There will
[2:02:14] be sons.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; With father's authority,
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; we owe sons.
[2:02:22] Not just the technon, not just the
[2:02:24] toddler, but mature.
[2:02:29] Look, you know, I think most of us feel
[2:02:32] like we are mature,
[2:02:36] but I got a camera on you.
[2:02:41] And I can sit in my office and watch how
[2:02:43] you behave when you come in here, you
[2:02:45] know,
[2:02:47] and I see people, not today,
[2:02:51] but sometimes I see people fussing and
[2:02:54] fuming over a seat, throwing things.
[2:03:01] I didn't know you wanted to be here that
[2:03:02] bad
[2:03:04] because you show up sometime and you're
[2:03:06] not here.
[2:03:08] But I see it.
[2:03:13] Brother Gley and I got accused of being
[2:03:14] communist one time because we had a
[2:03:16] camera
[2:03:21] by precious sister
[2:03:26] big brothers watching you.
[2:03:29] So be careful how you think you're
[2:03:31] mature
[2:03:33] because mature people don't have to have
[2:03:36] the same seat
[2:03:38] every time. And mature people sometimes
[2:03:41] have to sit by stinky people, but they
[2:03:43] don't get all out of shape.
[2:03:50] And you may not want to sit by someone
[2:03:52] with body order, but maybe they don't
[2:03:54] want to sit by you with that cheap
[2:03:56] perfume you wear.
[2:03:59] It's so full of chemicals it'll give
[2:04:01] anybody a headache.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; We We That's not maturity. Maturity
[2:04:08] says, "I don't even have to have a
[2:04:10] chair. Just get me in the presence.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Just let me get under the the
[2:04:17] inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; I'll sit on my fist and lean back on my
[2:04:23] thumb if that's what I have to do. But
[2:04:25] I've got to be in the presence of the
[2:04:28] Lord. We're not there yet. We're not
[2:04:31] desperate enough yet.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And it's going to require some of that
[2:04:37] desperation to move us into that place
[2:04:39] of maturity
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; where all that matters is getting him,
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; holding on to him and not letting him
[2:04:50] go. I'll be honest with you, he doesn't
[2:04:52] want to go. Right.
[2:04:55] He doesn't want to leave.
[2:04:58] He doesn't want to.
[2:05:01] But like uh like so many other
[2:05:06] situations,
[2:05:08] he wants to be wanted.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? The God of creation
[2:05:15] wants to be wanted.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; It's something we don't understand about
[2:05:22] Almighty God.
[2:05:24] uh we we can see it in Adam, but we
[2:05:28] can't necessarily see it in his creator.
[2:05:30] But you've got to understand the whole
[2:05:32] reason why there was an Adam.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; It's because God wanted to be wanted.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be wanted. He wanted to be
[2:05:41] worshiped, but not by robots
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; without a will. Right?
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be worshiped by those who
[2:05:49] had a will and who chose to worship him
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; because they loved him above all.
[2:05:56] Anybody here?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; So, we're in this place where we've, you
[2:06:03] know, and I say we because I don't think
[2:06:05] it's fair to always say they, they.
[2:06:09] And when I say we, you know whether or
[2:06:11] not you're guilty. I know whether or not
[2:06:13] I'm guilty. But it's just better to say
[2:06:15] we, isn't it?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Because some of us we
[2:06:20] are guilty.
[2:06:24] But this is where we are in the message
[2:06:26] pursuming.
[2:06:28] You see, Samson was just beginning to
[2:06:31] realize that that divine covering
[2:06:34] had lifted from him. And that's exactly
[2:06:38] where the church world, this is what
[2:06:39] brother Brandon was preaching in the 50s
[2:06:41] and 60s. He said, "The church world is
[2:06:43] in the position where Samson was." Now,
[2:06:45] I can say that today. I can preach it,
[2:06:47] brother. Believe me. I can preach that
[2:06:50] because I believe that if it was if the
[2:06:53] church was in Samson's broken condition
[2:06:56] without the spirit of God in the 50s,
[2:06:59] it's more so today than it ever was.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; But again, that's just pointing fingers
[2:07:04] out there. What I'd like to say today is
[2:07:07] the sad shame is that many of us who
[2:07:11] know better and who have better and who
[2:07:14] claim better, I think we throw around
[2:07:17] the word the phrase that we have the
[2:07:19] perfect word. We we have the perfection.
[2:07:23] Someone told me this week that there are
[2:07:26] just many things we don't need anymore,
[2:07:29] including the Old Testament, because we
[2:07:31] have the perfect word.
[2:07:34] You know
[2:07:36] the symptoms
[2:07:38] of having the perfect word. I know it's
[2:07:41] I know symptoms is being used here a
[2:07:43] little odd but I like to say instead of
[2:07:46] the fruit the symptoms that somebody has
[2:07:49] the perfect word is is maturity
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; I it it's not um argumentativeness
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; or or or obstinate
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; or stubborn will
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; or narcissistic tendency
[2:08:11] The church is full of narcissists.
[2:08:14] The pull pit,
[2:08:16] too.
[2:08:18] We need a shaking.
[2:08:21] And in order to shake and get the right
[2:08:23] results, we've got to get in covenant.
[2:08:26] Is that right?
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; I know we're moving slow. It's good for
[2:08:29] us. So good for us. In 134 of the
[2:08:32] message pursuming, he said, "Need we
[2:08:34] more." We need more holiness. That's not
[2:08:39] more rules.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; It's not more legislated holiness.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; It's more overflowing holiness.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; You see, holiness is a byproduct. It's a
[2:08:54] fruit
[2:08:57] of being occupied,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; chosen,
[2:09:02] set apart by that which is holy.
[2:09:06] All bushes were the same until that day
[2:09:11] that God Almighty crawled in that bush.
[2:09:15] That bush wasn't holy before.
[2:09:18] That bush wasn't different before. But
[2:09:20] you put the holiness of Almighty God on
[2:09:24] a frog and he becomes a holy frog.
[2:09:28] It doesn't matter what it is. If you put
[2:09:31] the holiness of God on it and in it, it
[2:09:34] becomes holy. That's what makes you
[2:09:36] holy. It's not your uniform.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's not your adherence to the rule.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; It's the fact that holiness has come to
[2:09:46] live, to dwell, to abide in you. And I'm
[2:09:50] with brother Brand. I'm here 100%. We
[2:09:52] need more holiness. We need more
[2:09:54] surrender. We need more laying down of
[2:09:58] our will so that the holy fire can come.
[2:10:02] We need to be cleaned up.
[2:10:05] Uh he got it kind of personal here. I
[2:10:07] hear somebody helping me back there.
[2:10:08] That's good.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Our churches.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Let's say it that way today. Our
[2:10:14] churches need more holiness.
[2:10:17] not not more Revlon and Max Factor, but
[2:10:20] they need more holiness because those
[2:10:24] things that we have called holiness,
[2:10:27] they do they do they are the fruit. They
[2:10:31] are the testimony.
[2:10:33] They are the outward amen to what God is
[2:10:36] doing on the inside.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; And when you find yourself going back to
[2:10:40] pick up the things that you once laid
[2:10:41] down in his name, it's simply because
[2:10:44] the fire is lifting. I I don't I have no
[2:10:47] problem saying that you can sit down and
[2:10:49] put before your eyes something you used
[2:10:51] to couldn't put before your eyes. It's a
[2:10:53] testimony that the fire is lifting
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; and only you can have it back, get it
[2:10:57] back, call it back, prepare to have it
[2:10:59] back. It's only us.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; He said Samson went down there and lived
[2:11:04] with this prostitute and then he she
[2:11:06] finally told him to do this and I
[2:11:08] finally got by with it and I think it'll
[2:11:11] be all right.
[2:11:13] I presume he's with me. Woo.
[2:11:19] Just because he's on the front stoop
[2:11:20] knocking on the door don't mean he lives
[2:11:22] in your house.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; He said, uh, I I presume he's with me.
[2:11:29] But when he got up, this came out in the
[2:11:31] Friday text, but when he got up and
[2:11:33] shook himself, he found out the power
[2:11:35] was gone. That his power was gone. He
[2:11:40] said, 'I think today, brother, when we
[2:11:41] look around upon our churches, the way
[2:11:42] they're going, it's time to our churches
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; shake ourselves. I believe it. I believe
[2:11:50] it.
[2:11:52] I believe it. Shake ourselves. That's
[2:11:55] right.
[2:11:56] I think today, brethren, when we look
[2:11:58] around, it's time to shake oursel.
[2:12:01] Something's wrong. We're presuming that
[2:12:03] we're running all right. We're presuming
[2:12:06] that we're doing fine.
[2:12:09] Awakening Jesus 183. I think of Samson.
[2:12:12] He found a man with plenty of strength
[2:12:15] to God. Plenty of strength. And Samson
[2:12:17] dedicated his strength to God, but he
[2:12:19] wouldn't give his heart. He gave that to
[2:12:21] Delilah.
[2:12:23] Ouch. Oh my.
[2:12:27] It's like young people who come and say,
[2:12:28] "Pastor, what do you think about maybe I
[2:12:31] have a relationship with so and so?"
[2:12:35] When the reality is you've already given
[2:12:37] your heart away. Why do you need any
[2:12:39] help now? Why do you even care what
[2:12:41] anybody else thinks when you give your
[2:12:44] heart away, brother, sister? You're
[2:12:46] you're pushing an agenda.
[2:12:49] You ought to hold on to your heart until
[2:12:51] you know what is the mind of God.
[2:12:58] Let me look around and find the
[2:12:59] sleepers.
[2:13:00] Sometimes I get sometimes people text me
[2:13:03] pictures.
[2:13:08] Interesting, isn't it?
[2:13:10] I have a whole collection on my phone.
[2:13:15] There's nothing like encouraging a
[2:13:16] pastor
[2:13:19] by sending a text of asleep. I expect
[2:13:21] it.
[2:13:23] Don't disappoint me.
[2:13:27] I'm not a big church age book quarter,
[2:13:29] but I like this.
[2:13:32] Dr. Vale got it right this time. He
[2:13:36] said, "God used an Abraham. He lied.
[2:13:41] He used a Moses. He rebelled.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; A Jonah, he disobeyed.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; A Samson, he sinned. A David, he
[2:13:48] murdered.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; He also used a Joshua and a Joseph. And
[2:13:53] those with severe
[2:13:56] Blemishes far outnumbered those whose
[2:14:00] histories seem to be perfect. All were
[2:14:06] all were
[2:14:08] and are
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; woo.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, we Samsons have a chance
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; because the covenant is not broken.
[2:14:19] That's right.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; He'll use us.
[2:14:24] He allows us to be broken
[2:14:27] so that he can use us. Seport I'm going
[2:14:30] to read a lot. Sorry. It's just today.
[2:14:32] It just happened to be today. Paragraph
[2:14:34] 79 just once more. Samson knew one. And
[2:14:38] I won't read them all. I've got a couple
[2:14:40] of more sermons in this little series
[2:14:42] and I won't ever read them all. It's 100
[2:14:46] pages. 100 pages of quotations where
[2:14:49] brother Brandham is speaking about
[2:14:51] Samson. I find that he had more to say
[2:14:53] about the story of Samson than perhaps
[2:14:55] any other story in the Bible. There
[2:14:57] there's something. It's like in theology
[2:15:00] when you when you look at the first
[2:15:01] mention and the last mention and the and
[2:15:04] you look at the uh frequency of mention
[2:15:09] and it kind of gives you this idea that
[2:15:11] there was something in this story that
[2:15:13] we need to hold on to even in 2026.
[2:15:16] There's something applicable
[2:15:19] to us in this hour. He said Samson knew
[2:15:22] one thing and I wonder if the church
[2:15:24] realizes it today. He knew that his
[2:15:28] oh his backslidden condition
[2:15:32] couldn't
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; I need brother Daniel today
[2:15:41] could couldn't meet the challenge of the
[2:15:46] man I'll just do brother Daniel
[2:15:52] I need it every now and Again,
[2:15:57] the backsliding condition couldn't meet
[2:15:59] the challenge of the hour. And I know
[2:16:00] today that the backsliding condition of
[2:16:02] the church can't meet the challenge of
[2:16:04] the hour. And it's going to be worse. He
[2:16:06] said, "The Bible said, "As Janice and
[2:16:08] Jambage with Moses, so will they. Men of
[2:16:10] reprobate mind concerning the faith,
[2:16:12] they can almost impersonate it."
[2:16:14] Exactly. I find that around the message
[2:16:16] of the hour, they've been so afraid of
[2:16:18] impersonators
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; and imitators
[2:16:23] that they've labeled anybody with
[2:16:25] anything, any uncction, any gift, any
[2:16:29] life. They must be a Janice and a
[2:16:32] Jambre.
[2:16:34] I wouldn't want us to become that
[2:16:36] skeptical. Moses went down with his
[2:16:38] command from God with a stick in his
[2:16:40] hand. And God said, "Do the sign before
[2:16:42] them. And if they won't listen to that,
[2:16:44] do this sign before them. If they won't
[2:16:46] listen to that, then I'll be with you.
[2:16:47] I'll take care of the rest of it."
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; That's where we are. God's taking care
[2:16:51] of the rest of it.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Well, Moses went down with his first
[2:16:54] sign. And as soon as he performed his
[2:16:56] first sign, there were impersonators
[2:16:58] everywhere doing the same thing. But
[2:16:59] Moses never fussed about it. He just
[2:17:01] stood still. For he knew that it was God
[2:17:04] that sent him. We're going to have that
[2:17:07] repeat again
[2:17:09] in the last days. And our backsliden
[2:17:13] state, listen folks, and our backsliden
[2:17:16] state now will not meet the challenge of
[2:17:22] the hour. Right.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; 2025 was a challenge,
[2:17:27] but 2026
[2:17:29] is also it's another challenge because
[2:17:33] as we get closer,
[2:17:36] the challenge will morph.
[2:17:39] It will multiply. It will change. And
[2:17:41] there has to be a bride that can keep
[2:17:43] up. The word is the same. The word is
[2:17:47] the same. It doesn't change.
[2:17:50] But there are things that we have to
[2:17:52] keep up with as the challenge changes to
[2:17:56] always be able to meet the challenge of
[2:17:59] the spirit of the hour, the spirit of
[2:18:01] the age. We've got to be not stagnant.
[2:18:04] We've got to be free flowing. We've got
[2:18:05] to be free. We have to have liberty.
[2:18:09] There must be liberty. Somebody say
[2:18:11] liberty. There must be liberty
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; to meet the challenge of the hour.
[2:18:16] He said, "There's more Pentecostals in
[2:18:18] the world today than there ever was more
[2:18:21] Pentecostal believers." That's right.
[2:18:25] And I used this at the beginning of this
[2:18:27] series, but I couldn't let today go by
[2:18:29] without using it again. Paragraph 125 of
[2:18:32] Just Once More Lord Shreport. Same
[2:18:34] message. Listen.
[2:18:36] Destroy
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; your enemy
[2:18:42] before
[2:18:45] you. He'll do it. He said, "Bring back
[2:18:48] the oldfashioned meetings and the thing
[2:18:51] and oh, leave Delilah alone. Leave the
[2:18:53] world alone." The thing that woos you
[2:18:55] off into little things that you
[2:18:57] shouldn't
[2:18:59] and little things troubles comes up in
[2:19:01] the church and you won't stand
[2:19:03] correction because you don't have to.
[2:19:05] You can drop off to another church and
[2:19:09] things like that. In the early days when
[2:19:12] a man didn't cope up with the word of
[2:19:13] God.
[2:19:17] Oh, I don't like to read that. Somebody
[2:19:18] said because it brings fear. If it's the
[2:19:20] fear of the Lord, bring it on because we
[2:19:23] need some fear of the Lord. The
[2:19:25] Pentecostal and charismatic church has
[2:19:27] certainly taken the fear of the Lord out
[2:19:29] of the people. But you must not be those
[2:19:31] who lose their reverential fear and awe
[2:19:35] of Almighty God. And look at what
[2:19:37] brother Brandham says. He's almost
[2:19:38] cursing here. If you listen to our
[2:19:41] preachers, he said, "Bring us back
[2:19:45] to Pentecost."
[2:19:50] One of my famous, infamous sermons in
[2:19:53] the 90s was uh Pentecost is not a swear
[2:19:55] word
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; because they just they just had a way of
[2:20:00] saying Pentecost.
[2:20:03] We were Pentecostals
[2:20:07] like it was cancer.
[2:20:10] Uhhuh.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I'm standing
[2:20:15] strong today
[2:20:17] because the experience that I had back
[2:20:21] then
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; was genuine.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Didn't you need a message? I did. Some
[2:20:27] don't. I did. Didn't you need a pro? I
[2:20:30] did need a prophet. I needed help. But I
[2:20:35] had an experience with God. And Jesus
[2:20:39] says it best. When he, the Spirit of
[2:20:42] truth, has come, he'll lead you.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; He'll guide you. He'll direct you to
[2:20:49] what? All truth. He's still doing that.
[2:20:53] And then Judges 16:21, let me see what
[2:20:56] time it is. Oh yes, it's early.
[2:21:00] But the Philistines took him and put out
[2:21:02] his eyes
[2:21:04] and brought him down to Gaza and bound
[2:21:06] him with feathers of brass. And he did
[2:21:08] grind in the prison house. Somebody say,
[2:21:10] "Poor Samson."
[2:21:12] Say it again.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Poor Samson.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Poor us."
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Poor me. Because if we're not careful,
[2:21:19] the same devil, the same enemy, the same
[2:21:22] the same agenda
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; that that took Samson's sight
[2:21:28] would take
[2:21:30] gladly take the sight of the end time
[2:21:33] church.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; If the enemy could blind you to the
[2:21:36] reality of the hour you're living in, he
[2:21:39] would do it without hesitation.
[2:21:42] If he could convince you that the spirit
[2:21:44] of God is no longer revealing himself to
[2:21:46] individuals, he would do it in an
[2:21:48] instant. If the devil could somehow
[2:21:51] convince you that the Holy Ghost and the
[2:21:53] and the administration of the gifts of
[2:21:55] the spirit was not for today, he if he
[2:21:58] could convince you of that, he would do
[2:22:00] it in a heartbeat
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; because he knows that if we take the
[2:22:04] spirit away from the truth,
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; we have a halfbaked cake
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "They who worship
[2:22:13] me, there's coming a tower that those
[2:22:15] who worship me must worship me with both
[2:22:18] sides of the take
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; spirit
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; and truth.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; But here's my hope. We're moving into
[2:22:30] hope. It's verse 22. How be it, can you
[2:22:35] read it all together just like sweet
[2:22:37] little church folks? How be it the hair
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah?
[2:22:48] Hallelujah. You know why I got up this
[2:22:51] morning? Because the hair begins to grow
[2:22:55] again.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Because the hopelessness
[2:23:00] of the old is leaving me
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; and the hope of the new is returning.
[2:23:09] Because we know by the law of creation
[2:23:13] in most cases look around in not all
[2:23:18] cases but in most cases you shave it
[2:23:22] off.
[2:23:26] Let me hear you.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; It grows back.
[2:23:32] It's growing back.
[2:23:35] It's coming back.
[2:23:38] Why? Because God is a covenant keeper.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; He's not just a covenant maker. He's a
[2:23:44] covenant keeper.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Hair is growing back. Glory be to God.
[2:23:54] It began to grow. Somebody say began to
[2:23:58] grow again.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is not a mistake. This this is
[2:24:02] careful wording.
[2:24:06] He doesn't have seven locks.
[2:24:09] hanging down his back.
[2:24:13] But he's got some stubble coming.
[2:24:18] That's the only thing that's
[2:24:20] likable about shaving
[2:24:23] hair is because that that's a when it
[2:24:25] gets real short like like this. This is
[2:24:27] short hair, folks, for you that don't
[2:24:30] know. This is short hair.
[2:24:33] And when it you you can do you catch
[2:24:36] yourself. I'm weird.
[2:24:39] I catch myself, oh yeah, that feels nice
[2:24:41] when it's short like that.
[2:24:45] I was getting my haircut the other day
[2:24:47] and there was a woman's a relative of
[2:24:50] the girl who cuts my hair was sitting
[2:24:52] there. She's just come through horrible
[2:24:54] rounds of chemotherapy
[2:24:57] and her hair is growing back and it's
[2:24:59] only about that long, but it is full and
[2:25:02] it is thick.
[2:25:04] And she said, "Aren't you a pastor?" And
[2:25:07] I said, "Yes." She said, "I thought I
[2:25:09] remembered you. I thought I remembered
[2:25:11] that you were." And she said, "Look what
[2:25:13] the Lord has done." She said, "In the
[2:25:16] throws of that
[2:25:18] losing my hair," she said, "I didn't
[2:25:20] want I didn't have strength to hold my
[2:25:22] head up,
[2:25:24] but she said, "I'm getting my strength
[2:25:26] back. I'm getting my hair back."
[2:25:31] And Lord, to me it was just, you know,
[2:25:34] barely fuzz. But to her,
[2:25:37] after not having any, she looked in the
[2:25:40] mirror and and it was like long
[2:25:42] beautiful locks to her. Do you
[2:25:43] understand the concept?
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; So it it's not that Samson woke up one
[2:25:48] morning and had seven braids hanging
[2:25:50] down his back.
[2:25:53] It's that he woke up one morning and his
[2:25:55] hair on his head had began to grow
[2:26:00] again. I wish that we were at seven lock
[2:26:03] stage. I wish we were back to where we
[2:26:07] had full capacity, power, and authority.
[2:26:10] But the reality is after this long
[2:26:14] battle, we are just now beginning to
[2:26:17] wake up to the reality that God is a
[2:26:20] covenant keeping God. He hasn't thrown
[2:26:23] his little bride away. He hasn't forgot
[2:26:25] his promise to this end time overcoming
[2:26:28] army of people. We have laid our head in
[2:26:32] Delilah's lap. And we have become
[2:26:34] powerless. But the God of covenant said,
[2:26:37] "Come back. Don't compare yourself with
[2:26:41] what other message churches are doing.
[2:26:43] You come back and find my will for where
[2:26:47] I put you and your hair will begin to
[2:26:51] grow again.
[2:26:53] This is uh it's Hebrew Vel
[2:27:01] ro which is head like the head of the
[2:27:05] year
[2:27:07] leta
[2:27:09] and and it's but the hair of his head
[2:27:12] began to grow again. The word vel
[2:27:16] appears
[2:27:17] in this verse and it's got a lot of
[2:27:21] meaning.
[2:27:23] He has been imprisoned.
[2:27:26] His eyes poked out and he is
[2:27:31] turning out the grain like a o ax, a
[2:27:34] beast, a burden. Can you imagine this
[2:27:36] mighty warrior? This champion is now
[2:27:40] tethered
[2:27:41] to a grinding stone
[2:27:44] and he's making his circles like the
[2:27:47] like the like the bear in the shuffle.
[2:27:51] He's making his circles like Johnny
[2:27:53] Crow. Brother Brandham
[2:27:56] talked about Johnny Crow
[2:27:59] with a string on his foot. Yes. And
[2:28:04] Samson just going around and around and
[2:28:05] around bald-headed, blinded,
[2:28:08] embarrassed.
[2:28:10] Brother Bram said, "What a pity. What a
[2:28:12] shame. What an embarrassment."
[2:28:16] But his hair,
[2:28:20] some little kid
[2:28:22] had gone by to watch him. This great
[2:28:25] champion of the enemy nation of Israel,
[2:28:29] some little boy had gone by and struck
[2:28:32] up a friendship with him and and and
[2:28:35] told him one day said, "Hey, hey, you
[2:28:38] big uh brute,
[2:28:41] your hair is beginning to grow again."
[2:28:45] Oh, is it?
[2:28:47] Yes, it is.
[2:28:49] And it gave him hope.
[2:28:53] It gave him energy. It gave him
[2:28:55] strength. It gave him something to keep
[2:28:58] pushing.
[2:29:00] I'm going to keep grinding here and
[2:29:02] pushing here while it grows.
[2:29:06] This is not a casual began to grow. This
[2:29:09] is a very purposeful choice of words in
[2:29:12] Hebrew.
[2:29:14] This word means to begin again, to
[2:29:17] restart, to renew, to reinitiate,
[2:29:21] to resume after an interruption and to
[2:29:25] enter into a new phase. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:29:30] This is not a casual began. You see, the
[2:29:32] moment God begins again, even while the
[2:29:35] enemy thinks the story is finished, God
[2:29:37] was already initiating renewal even
[2:29:40] before Samson renewed his covenant. The
[2:29:44] outward sign was growing while the
[2:29:46] inward surrender was forming. Hello,
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; did you hear that?
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; The outward sign was growing while the
[2:29:54] inward surrender was forming. And the
[2:29:57] reason why this matters,
[2:30:00] the text does not say his hair grew, his
[2:30:03] hair returned, his strength was back to
[2:30:05] normal. It all came rushing back.
[2:30:08] Specifically, the scripture says his
[2:30:10] hair began. Say with me, began to grow
[2:30:13] again. All it takes is renewing the
[2:30:16] covenant. All it takes is saying, "Lord,
[2:30:19] won't you help me again one more time?
[2:30:21] won't you pass by and help me get back
[2:30:24] to where I once was. Restoration started
[2:30:27] before deliverance. Renewal began before
[2:30:29] victory. Consecration returned before
[2:30:32] power.
[2:30:34] This is a turning point word.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; His hair began to grow again.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at your neighbor. I
[2:30:44] mean it.
[2:30:50] Even if they have bad breath, I want you
[2:30:53] to look at your neighbor and say, "It's
[2:30:54] time for a comeback."
[2:30:58] And now do it again. Say it again. Mean
[2:31:01] it. Say it like you mean it this time.
[2:31:03] It's time
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; for a comeback.
[2:31:11] This uh season didn't catch God by
[2:31:13] surprise. That's right.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; For quite some time, it looked as if
[2:31:17] Samson would just rot.
[2:31:20] in some Philistine jail.
[2:31:22] But God still has the power in reserve
[2:31:25] for those who are willing to be part of
[2:31:28] a comeback.
[2:31:30] Samson's eyes were gone. His freedom was
[2:31:34] gone. His position was gone. His
[2:31:37] reputation was gone.
[2:31:40] But his hair began to grow again. God
[2:31:43] had already begun something again. The
[2:31:45] Philistines thought the story was over.
[2:31:48] Hallelujah.
[2:31:49] The defactors and critics of this
[2:31:51] message and those who are uh dutifully
[2:31:54] with great determination picking the the
[2:31:57] life of brother Brandham apart bone by
[2:32:00] bone by bone as if that had anything to
[2:32:02] do with the truth.
[2:32:09] You ought heard what he said. He said,
[2:32:11] "Don't pay any attention to me.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the messenger." This is
[2:32:17] what he said. You should have listened.
[2:32:19] Don't look at the messenger.
[2:32:23] I make thousands of mistakes every day.
[2:32:25] That was a mistake to say that. That's
[2:32:27] an exaggeration.
[2:32:30] Hello.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; Nobody makes thousands of mistakes every
[2:32:33] day. But brother Bham said, I make
[2:32:35] thousands of mistakes every day. That
[2:32:36] was a mistake. So that proved the point
[2:32:38] right there. Don't look at me. He said,
[2:32:41] "You look to the message
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; because the message is not the doctrine
[2:32:45] of William Brandom.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; The message is the revelation of Jesus
[2:32:49] Christ." And if you want don't know
[2:32:51] where it's found, it's not only found in
[2:32:53] Revelation chapter 10. It's found in
[2:32:56] Genesis to Revelation
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; from one amen to the last. Amen.
[2:33:03] All of it is a revelation
[2:33:07] is the revelation of Jesus Christ. And
[2:33:10] the messenger becomes more irrelevant
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; as the message becomes more real.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hear you. I already hear you.
[2:33:22] I hear them.
[2:33:24] They all stream.
[2:33:26] They'll have something to preach
[2:33:28] Wednesday night.
[2:33:30] I'm good for something. I'm giving him
[2:33:32] fodder to use.
[2:33:36] You shouldn't say that he blessed God.
[2:33:39] He means more to me today than he ever
[2:33:42] did. More to me today than the first
[2:33:45] tape I ever heard. You think that's the
[2:33:47] goal, but that's not the goal.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; You think that gives you a trophy in the
[2:33:53] Hall of Faith, but it gives you no such
[2:33:55] thing because you didn't hear what John
[2:33:58] the Baptist said. If he's still meaning
[2:34:01] more and more and the emphasis is
[2:34:03] becoming more and more on the messenger,
[2:34:05] you're missing what he said. It's the
[2:34:08] message that must become more and more
[2:34:10] real to us as the days go by because
[2:34:14] it's not the revelation of a messenger.
[2:34:16] It's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:34:19] What did he say? I must
[2:34:30] You think that offends brother Brandham
[2:34:33] if he should hear it? Oh,
[2:34:36] he says, "Get them, boys.
[2:34:40] Tell them. Tell them just like it is."
[2:34:44] Cuz until they can see Jesus,
[2:34:47] all they'll see is mistakes.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. But if you one time, if
[2:34:51] you one time stare into the eyes of
[2:34:54] perfection,
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; if you ever see the beauty of the Lord,
[2:34:59] you'll never be satisfied
[2:35:02] with a picture of a cloud
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; or the picture of a pillar of fire.
[2:35:09] Oh, it's these are beautiful things.
[2:35:12] Don't don't misunderstand.
[2:35:14] But that's not the goal.
[2:35:17] The goal is to get him in. You and him
[2:35:20] and and he and you.
[2:35:24] It's huge.
[2:35:26] It's close because her hair, his hair, I
[2:35:29] say her, the church, there's little
[2:35:30] bride remnant. It's not It's Listen,
[2:35:32] listen. I I got some bad news for you. I
[2:35:36] need to go ahead and get it out. Let's
[2:35:37] see. Do I have time? I do.
[2:35:42] Everybody who goes to a spoken word
[2:35:45] tabernacle or a word of life tabernacle
[2:35:48] or a end time message of the hour
[2:35:51] tabernacle, everyone who goes to a
[2:35:54] church is identified with the ministry
[2:35:55] of William Brandham, they won't all make
[2:35:57] it.
[2:36:02] That's right, brother.
[2:36:04] because he said every church.
[2:36:10] Oh, in the 90s I didn't believe it about
[2:36:12] this church,
[2:36:15] but in the 2020s I'm sure. No, I didn't
[2:36:18] fall. I'm going to be okay. I'm all
[2:36:21] right. Just a little emotional. I didn't
[2:36:24] believe it in the beginning because I I
[2:36:26] tell you, all I could see was him moving
[2:36:31] and changing people's lives.
[2:36:35] You could have never convinced me in
[2:36:37] those days that there was a makeeliever
[2:36:40] among us
[2:36:42] and certainly not an unbeliever.
[2:36:45] But as the years go by and I see so many
[2:36:48] attracted to different things, I realize
[2:36:51] that in every church he was absolutely
[2:36:53] right. Oh, we pastors don't maybe we
[2:36:55] still don't want to think about it, but
[2:36:57] it's the reality
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; because you can sit week after week
[2:37:01] after week and hear the same truth
[2:37:04] and not be born again and not be changed
[2:37:07] by it and not grow with it and not
[2:37:09] recognize that we are now a generation
[2:37:13] past
[2:37:15] the rapture.
[2:37:18] He told us way back when that the
[2:37:21] rapture was overdue. If you think the
[2:37:23] rapture was overdue in ' 64, what do you
[2:37:25] think it is today?
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; It's another generation past due. I
[2:37:30] don't think the word I don't think we're
[2:37:31] waiting on the word to get perfect. I
[2:37:33] think the word was perfect before the
[2:37:34] messenger.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; The church doctrine wasn't, but the word
[2:37:39] was.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; We didn't understand it all, but it was
[2:37:41] perfect. Never has been anything but.
[2:37:48] Now we're a whole generation removed and
[2:37:51] we're we're having to admit through
[2:37:55] uh clenched teeth that we're still here.
[2:38:00] We're still here. There's been no
[2:38:01] rapture.
[2:38:03] We're way past 77
[2:38:07] and there's still not enough perfect
[2:38:10] love
[2:38:14] to bring the bridegroom back.
[2:38:17] But the hair is growing. You hear me?
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; God's keeping his promise. Be careful
[2:38:23] what you look at. Be careful what you
[2:38:25] make your focus. Don't let it be your
[2:38:27] pastor. God will let him stumble. Keep
[2:38:30] your eye on him. Keep your eye on Jesus.
[2:38:32] Keep your Oh, folks,
[2:38:37] he's all together lovely.
[2:38:42] Let's see. 95 2005 2015 2025 is that 30
[2:38:47] years
[2:38:50] February the 19th
[2:38:52] of of 2025 was 30 years ago. So this
[2:38:56] this was a word of the Lord that came in
[2:38:58] February the 19th of 1990. 30 years ago
[2:39:03] God spoke in the house and said, "My
[2:39:07] children, listen. this night.
[2:39:11] Knowest thou not the hour?
[2:39:15] How is it, my children, that many walk
[2:39:18] and know not the hour that they walk in?
[2:39:20] Yay, the Lord thy God would say, the
[2:39:22] darkest hour is upon thee. The slippery
[2:39:26] pit has been dug before you, says the
[2:39:30] Lord. And the enemy, your adversary, the
[2:39:34] adversary of your soul, has come to
[2:39:37] steal you away. But I, the Lord, would
[2:39:40] say unto thee, my church, I will send my
[2:39:43] angel, saith the Lord, he will guide you
[2:39:47] around the edges of the treacherous pit.
[2:39:50] He will not suffer you to fall in the
[2:39:53] trap that Satan has laid for you, says
[2:39:56] the Lord. But he will put his arm under
[2:39:59] you and lift you,
[2:40:03] and if need be, he will carry you upon
[2:40:06] his shoulders across
[2:40:09] until you've reached the other side of
[2:40:11] safety. Oh my children,
[2:40:15] I would that you were hot or cold or
[2:40:18] lukewarm I will spew out of my mouth.
[2:40:22] Be not lazy. Do not be adjusted to this
[2:40:25] world, but cry after me.
[2:40:29] And even as the little deer panteth
[2:40:32] after the water, I desire that your
[2:40:35] inner man would cry and pant and long
[2:40:41] after me. For I have ways
[2:40:45] that you know not of.
[2:40:48] And I have things that you know not of.
[2:40:50] And I have meat for you to eat that you
[2:40:54] know not of. and spiritual drink.
[2:40:58] I the Lord would say, recognize this
[2:41:01] hour and recognize that I have called
[2:41:04] you to stand in this hour and watch and
[2:41:09] pray.
[2:41:11] Be alert and awake.
[2:41:14] Listen,
[2:41:16] for the enemy is upon thee, and the
[2:41:19] Philistines
[2:41:21] are upon thee, says the Lord. But oh, if
[2:41:26] you will refrain and refuse to lay your
[2:41:29] head in the lap of a Jezebel, I will
[2:41:34] bring you forth.
[2:41:36] He who does not compromise. I will bring
[2:41:38] you forth from the trap of Delilah, says
[2:41:42] God.
[2:41:43] I will cause your hair to grow back,
[2:41:47] says the Lord. And what I have done
[2:41:50] before
[2:41:52] I will do again,
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; says the Lord, for I am not a man that I
[2:41:58] should change, neither that I would
[2:42:00] repent, but I am forever more the same.
[2:42:04] Shake thyself, oh Samson. Shake thyself,
[2:42:09] oh Samson, for I will cause your hair to
[2:42:13] grow again.
[2:42:16] Thus saith the Lord.
[2:42:19] 30 years ago,
[2:42:22] you couldn't possibly believe
[2:42:25] that that's still on the horizon. Oh
[2:42:28] yes,
[2:42:29] it's right on the horizon.
[2:42:33] It's so close we can almost smell it if
[2:42:36] we weren't sleeping.
[2:42:40] And then 23, verse 23, I'm I'm nearly
[2:42:43] done.
[2:42:46] You got all evening
[2:42:49] to check the scores and do everything
[2:42:51] you need to do before work on Monday.
[2:42:55] Then the Lord of the Philistines
[2:42:56] gathered them together for to offer a
[2:42:58] great sacrifice unto day gone their God
[2:43:00] and to rejoice for they said, "Our God
[2:43:04] hath delivered." Listen, I'm telling you
[2:43:05] what you want to get God stirred.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Just start mocking like this.
[2:43:14] They didn't know what they were doing.
[2:43:16] H our God, little G,
[2:43:20] part fish.
[2:43:24] I think if I'm going to give something
[2:43:26] my attention, it's going to be a little
[2:43:27] higher up the chain than a fish. God
[2:43:31] had delivered. Our God had delivered
[2:43:33] Samson, our enemy, into our hand. And
[2:43:36] when the people saw him, they praised
[2:43:38] their God, for they said, "Oh, our God
[2:43:42] hath delivered into our hands our enemy
[2:43:46] and the destroyer of our country which
[2:43:49] slew many of us." And it came to pass
[2:43:53] while their hearts when their hearts
[2:43:55] were merry that they said, "Call for
[2:43:57] Samson uh that he may make a sport."
[2:44:02] For they said him.
[2:44:05] They set him
[2:44:07] between the pillars.
[2:44:10] Bad move.
[2:44:13] Bad bad bad
[2:44:16] move.
[2:44:19] Be careful what you mock.
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; And so in in in uh one of my favorite
[2:44:26] messages,
[2:44:28] the rejected king, Shiakaco, Ohio,
[2:44:32] you should hear it.
[2:44:34] It doesn't sound like the order of
[2:44:36] message churches today. You should hear
[2:44:39] it. Screaming.
[2:44:42] People screaming.
[2:44:44] Oh little lambs, I'm coming after you.
[2:44:47] He said in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:44:49] Christ.
[2:44:51] In paragraph 82, oh yes, they wanted
[2:44:53] this king. And when they got the king,
[2:44:55] then the enemy began to put the eyes of
[2:44:57] the people out. And then they couldn't
[2:44:59] see where they were going. That's the
[2:45:01] problem. Nobody can see where they're
[2:45:02] going. right into denominational
[2:45:04] bondage.
[2:45:07] And they love this quote where brother
[2:45:09] Brandham said, "There'll never be a
[2:45:10] denomination
[2:45:12] formed or built around this."
[2:45:16] They love it.
[2:45:18] They just don't know how to define this.
[2:45:24] This is the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:45:26] You'll never be able to build a
[2:45:28] denomination around the revelation of
[2:45:30] Jesus Christ. But you can build it
[2:45:33] around books and tapes
[2:45:38] and stories and testimonies and signs
[2:45:41] and wonders and icons. Because if you're
[2:45:45] one of those who's still running around
[2:45:46] the stop sign
[2:45:49] but paying no attention to what the
[2:45:50] voice of the sign is,
[2:45:53] this is so common. It happened all
[2:45:55] through church history.
[2:45:58] God sends a sign and people get excited
[2:46:00] about the sign and they're jumping up
[2:46:01] and down and screaming about the sign
[2:46:04] and they don't hear the voice because
[2:46:06] the prophet said, "Every time God sends
[2:46:08] a sign, there's a voice that follows
[2:46:11] that sign."
[2:46:13] And it was the voice.
[2:46:16] And then you've got the Jeffersonville
[2:46:17] cult
[2:46:19] who uh all they talk about is the voice.
[2:46:26] They're so fascinated with the voice
[2:46:28] that they have to say that it's all thus
[2:46:30] sayeth the Lord.
[2:46:33] And this is contrary to reality
[2:46:37] because you can't preach two sides of
[2:46:39] the same truth and it both be thus
[2:46:41] sayeth the Lord. It never was intended
[2:46:44] to be that way.
[2:46:49] I heard them
[2:46:51] in the weekly dispatch. You know, we get
[2:46:53] this weekly letter from headquarters
[2:46:56] still.
[2:46:58] I have to read it to keep up with the
[2:47:00] silliness of what they say.
[2:47:03] It makes me want to puke.
[2:47:06] It gets vile and vile as the weeks go
[2:47:09] by.
[2:47:11] It's everything I said it would be about
[2:47:13] 35 years ago. It's now upon us.
[2:47:17] And it's very serious business
[2:47:20] because if you can't discern between the
[2:47:22] servant and the god
[2:47:25] who got in the servant
[2:47:29] and they use this story of Moses just
[2:47:32] recently
[2:47:34] and they forgot something big
[2:47:37] in the life of Moses. When you compare
[2:47:39] brother Brandham to Moses, you better be
[2:47:42] careful not to forget
[2:47:45] that Moses didn't get to go in
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; because he disobeyed. And we can we can
[2:47:55] dress it up and say he made a mistake.
[2:47:58] But he disobeyed
[2:48:01] because prophets are not perfect.
[2:48:06] They don't like to say it, but he said
[2:48:08] it. Brother Bren said it himself.
[2:48:11] They're not perfect.
[2:48:14] He said, "You'll see. They're not
[2:48:16] perfect, but the word, the word is
[2:48:18] perfect. The absolute is perfect."
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; You must. You're still here.
[2:48:28] The first thing the devil does when he
[2:48:29] can get a servant of God, he blinds him
[2:48:32] to the fact that he's lost.
[2:48:35] He said that's the first thing uh the
[2:48:37] enemy done. When they got Samson,
[2:48:39] another judge, they put his eyes out
[2:48:41] where he couldn't see where he was
[2:48:42] going. As soon as the enemy of the
[2:48:45] Philistines came in upon Israel, they
[2:48:47] put their right eye out so they couldn't
[2:48:48] see good where they were going. When the
[2:48:51] enemy comes into a church, he puts their
[2:48:54] eyes out
[2:48:56] to the real facts that the Holy Spirit
[2:48:59] is the one who rules and governs the
[2:49:01] church. All discipline is brought.
[2:49:07] Want to try it again? All discipline is
[2:49:10] brought.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. Oh, I wish I could say
[2:49:16] the words that would make it go home to
[2:49:18] the right place. see that it would never
[2:49:21] leave that it would cinch in there. God
[2:49:25] gave the Holy Spirit, not a pope, not a
[2:49:29] potentate, not the son of a prophet. God
[2:49:33] gave the Holy Spirit to rule and govern
[2:49:37] the church.
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; Third Exodus, God deals with an
[2:49:42] individual, not with groups,
[2:49:44] with individuals. Samson dropping way
[2:49:47] down. Samson gave him great power. God
[2:49:51] gave him great power, but he sold it out
[2:49:55] to a woman and was blinded.
[2:49:59] New York, New York. I've got to get this
[2:50:00] one in. So why should we have to stand
[2:50:03] in the presence of some heathen god and
[2:50:05] take a defeat?
[2:50:07] We stand again like Samson, spiritually
[2:50:10] stripped, morally broken our churches.
[2:50:12] What has happened? They used to be
[2:50:13] honorable men and women and today it's
[2:50:15] terrible. Now let's just look a few
[2:50:17] minutes at some thoughts that passed up
[2:50:19] upon us
[2:50:21] upon this. So there stood Samson, pardon
[2:50:23] me. Here he is again today again
[2:50:25] stripped morally, spiritually. And it's
[2:50:28] also a symbol of a fallen nation. But
[2:50:30] we're speaking of the church because
[2:50:31] Samson was God's servant supposed to be.
[2:50:34] And the church is supposed to be God's
[2:50:36] servant on the and let me say the
[2:50:38] message church is supposed to be God's
[2:50:41] servant. in the earth. Many great
[2:50:44] warriors standing there sober up for a
[2:50:46] moment as the liquors run off their
[2:50:50] probably their armors and breastplates
[2:50:51] their arms around their pretty jeweled
[2:50:53] queens and they look out upon their many
[2:50:56] of them looking at this site
[2:50:58] a little boy
[2:51:00] holding this big bulk of a man and no
[2:51:02] eyeballs in his sockets. They'd been
[2:51:05] burned out. That's what the enemy does.
[2:51:07] The first thing when he gets a hold of
[2:51:09] you, he does like he did to Samson. You
[2:51:10] shut your eyes off from the light of the
[2:51:12] gospel. Now he cannot see. His eyes are
[2:51:14] gone. Long has the church lost its
[2:51:17] spiritual sight that Jesus Christ is the
[2:51:19] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[2:51:21] every promise is true. Still here.
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; And as they stand there now, no eyes are
[2:51:25] ridiculous sight, a disgrace among
[2:51:27] standing beneath the fish god, a captive
[2:51:29] of the very nation that God raised him
[2:51:31] up to destroy. Now I'm going to come
[2:51:33] home just a minute and here is our
[2:51:35] Pentecostal people 50 years ago left
[2:51:37] that muk of denomination. And I'm going
[2:51:40] to just bring it right up to the day.
[2:51:42] I've been known to do that a time or
[2:51:43] two. And here we are in the message
[2:51:45] church. Left our denominational systems
[2:51:47] 50 years ago when we heard God's servant
[2:51:50] call it. Right here we stand today.
[2:51:52] Dozens of organizations
[2:51:57] perusia.
[2:51:59] Seven thunders.
[2:52:02] Seventh seal open. Seventh seal closed.
[2:52:05] Seventh seal closed but open but not
[2:52:08] revealed.
[2:52:11] Seven thunders are the seven mysteries.
[2:52:13] No,
[2:52:16] wait a minute. There are seven seals on
[2:52:18] the back side of the book. No.
[2:52:23] Went by me in an unknown tongue. I could
[2:52:25] not make it out.
[2:52:31] Some of you are lost.
[2:52:36] These are the statements that build
[2:52:39] camps,
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; break fellowship,
[2:52:46] and they boast. We understand it all.
[2:52:50] Perfect message, perfect word. We
[2:52:51] understand it all. No, you don't.
[2:52:55] You don't. You understand the quote
[2:52:57] you've chosen to stand on, but you don't
[2:52:59] understand it all.
[2:53:01] It wasn't meant for for us to understand
[2:53:04] it all just yet.
[2:53:06] We have to get our focus right.
[2:53:09] Amen.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; The very thing that God listen the very
[2:53:13] thing that God called us out to defeat
[2:53:15] it has
[2:53:17] defeated us. What do you think that is?
[2:53:19] A denominational spirit.
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; If one goes to this denomination has a
[2:53:23] meeting, rest of them won't don't want
[2:53:24] to cooperate. Just now and then you
[2:53:26] can't find one. The denomination has
[2:53:28] always been a curse in the sight of God.
[2:53:30] It never was. God never did. That never
[2:53:32] was his plan. Can anybody say amen?
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; And here's what I wrote. Could it also
[2:53:39] be said that even in our own ranks, we
[2:53:42] have been weakened by allowing the enemy
[2:53:46] to talk us out of our genuine experience
[2:53:50] with the Holy Ghost.
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; Emotion in worship banned. Tongues
[2:53:57] banned.
[2:53:58] Love gifts of the spirit band.
[2:54:03] It's like a big red X
[2:54:09] five-fold proon.
[2:54:12] Do I see mad? I'm not mad.
[2:54:17] Not at all. Cuz I see hair growing
[2:54:20] again.
[2:54:22] I'm just determined to call it like I
[2:54:24] see it.
[2:54:25] It almost cost me my life one time.
[2:54:28] Maybe it will this time and it'll all be
[2:54:31] over.
[2:54:32] I'm looking for Jesus.
[2:54:36] I'm looking for him. I got to get in one
[2:54:39] more. You said that before. Good. I'll
[2:54:43] say it again. Uh, love faith cometh by
[2:54:46] here. I didn't come for quotes. Sorry.
[2:54:48] So sorry.
[2:54:50] That's what we have today. How little
[2:54:52] Samson I can imagine seeing little
[2:54:55] Samson with his seven little locks
[2:54:56] hanging down. Oh, some people picture
[2:54:58] him like he had the door show like he
[2:55:00] had door shoulders like the doors back
[2:55:02] there. Great big brute of a man.
[2:55:04] Paragraph 55. Oh brother, it's not the
[2:55:08] size of the dog in the fight.
[2:55:12] It's the size of the fight
[2:55:15] that's in the dog.
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; Anybody got a fight in you?
[2:55:23] 58 and 57, excuse me. Let me see a
[2:55:26] little old cowardly church that's afraid
[2:55:28] to trust God or a family and let the
[2:55:30] spirit of God strike that family or that
[2:55:33] individual
[2:55:34] or that church. It doesn't take a whole
[2:55:36] church. Doesn't even take a whole
[2:55:38] family. If just one individual would
[2:55:41] stand, surrendered and let the Holy
[2:55:44] Ghost strike you,
[2:55:46] &gt;&gt; occupy you, take charge of you, watch
[2:55:49] what takes place, brother. I'm telling
[2:55:51] you, the skeptics fly like roaches in
[2:55:53] the summertime
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; when you begin to turn the light on.
[2:55:58] Oh, one more time. God's going to
[2:56:00] vindicate his word.
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; He's not going to vindicate William
[2:56:04] Brandom. He's going to vindicate his
[2:56:06] word one more time.
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be operating in a many
[2:56:11] membered little bride. Remnant bride.
[2:56:13] Somebody say remnant bride.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; Because you may think you're a bride and
[2:56:17] not be bride. It's not a game here. It's
[2:56:21] a real deal.
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; Cut out of the same cloth.
[2:56:29] Some used,
[2:56:31] some discarded.
[2:56:35] Somebody said, "I don't know which one I
[2:56:36] want to be."
[2:56:40] Keep following.
[2:56:42] You'll you'll decide. You'll see it
[2:56:44] clearly who you want to be.
[2:56:47] He said, "Uh, I can hear
[2:56:51] his mother say, Samson, darling.
[2:56:55] You're just an ordinary boy now, but
[2:56:58] you're a Nazerite to the Lord. The Lord
[2:57:00] before the foundation of the world has
[2:57:01] ordained you for this ministry. What is
[2:57:03] it, mama dear? You're to let them seven
[2:57:06] locks grow." And as long as God sees
[2:57:08] those seven locks, he sees his promise.
[2:57:11] They shaved them off one time, but they
[2:57:13] growed back. When old Samson stood there
[2:57:15] and seen them, he knowed God could look
[2:57:18] down and see his promise. He was under
[2:57:21] obligation to his word. Somebody say,
[2:57:23] "God is under obligation
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; to his
[2:57:28] word.
[2:57:38] not to our perceptions,
[2:57:41] our interpretations,
[2:57:43] our private understandings, but he is
[2:57:45] obligated to the wholeness of his word.
[2:57:50] I want to show you your role, but I
[2:57:52] don't I can't do it today. There's no
[2:57:54] time. But I want to show you your role.
[2:57:59] There is a remnant within a bride.
[2:58:03] There was a bride within a church. There
[2:58:06] is a remnant among those who identify
[2:58:09] themselves as bride and their
[2:58:13] responsibility in the end time must be
[2:58:15] clear.
[2:58:17] It is your responsibility to help
[2:58:23] Samson.
[2:58:26] Once upon a time, Samson was a type of a
[2:58:30] backslid denominational church system.
[2:58:34] But we're past that now.
[2:58:37] And Samson now stands as a spiritual
[2:58:39] type of a people who were called out by
[2:58:42] a word,
[2:58:44] but have grown cold,
[2:58:47] backslid, lukewarm,
[2:58:50] who have divided themselves over petty
[2:58:53] issues and formed a multitude of
[2:58:56] denominational systems.
[2:59:01] And still they're under covenant.
[2:59:04] because they were chosen from the
[2:59:07] foundation of the world to overcome.
[2:59:13] It's not their responsibility to make
[2:59:16] themselves overcome. It's God's
[2:59:18] responsibility. If he called you an
[2:59:20] overcomer, it's his responsibility to
[2:59:23] place within us what we need.
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; And he's faithful. Somebody say with me,
[2:59:29] he's faithful.
[2:59:34] We can't throw the baby out with the
[2:59:36] bathwater. Doesn't matter how they've
[2:59:38] disappointed us. Doesn't matter how we
[2:59:41] have watched things turn. It doesn't
[2:59:43] matter. We cannot be bitter.
[2:59:47] And we cannot forget them,
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; Because God didn't.
[2:59:55] God hasn't.
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; God never will.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:00] So, I want you to see with me as we
[3:00:02] close, uh, and I'll bring it a little
[3:00:06] closer in the next few services.
[3:00:10] I want you to see Samson powerless. And
[3:00:13] this time, I want you to see her, see
[3:00:16] Samson representing a people
[3:00:19] who heard a truth
[3:00:23] and who left so much behind.
[3:00:31] I know I'm a little emotional.
[3:00:38] It has been easy for some
[3:00:42] to find its flaws and walk away.
[3:00:50] But there's nowhere to go.
[3:00:57] Lord, where would we go?
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; I've been out there.
[3:01:06] Let me just a moment.
[3:01:21] Back to the assemblies, back to the
[3:01:23] church of God, back to the Jesus name.
[3:01:30] No, nothing there,
[3:01:35] knee skirts and high heel shoes and
[3:01:40] but they got long sleeves. the UPC.
[3:01:44] They're not going to show their elbows,
[3:01:45] but they'll show their knees and they'll
[3:01:48] stand on them stilts and twist around on
[3:01:51] the platforms. And I couldn't go there.
[3:01:56] There's no once this word
[3:02:00] has struck your heart,
[3:02:04] there would be nowhere else to land.
[3:02:07] So see Samson representing now a people
[3:02:11] who
[3:02:13] who denominated themselves because they
[3:02:15] got tired of waiting on the promise. And
[3:02:18] so they had to build some structures to
[3:02:20] keep things going. And in order to do
[3:02:23] that they had to attach themselves to
[3:02:25] things other than the word.
[3:02:33] And they had to fill their churches with
[3:02:35] icons and pictures and histories and the
[3:02:39] God of yesterday.
[3:02:43] But God didn't change his covenant with
[3:02:44] Samson.
[3:02:48] God allowed the enemy to come in, shave
[3:02:52] Samson's hair, took his spirit away from
[3:02:57] him,
[3:02:58] and left him blind
[3:03:01] and going in circles.
[3:03:04] But God had a plan.
[3:03:08] He had a remnant.
[3:03:10] He had a little boy
[3:03:13] who didn't know what Samson knew.
[3:03:16] He didn't know the role. And this little
[3:03:18] boy prophetically speaks of a remnant
[3:03:22] people
[3:03:24] who may not know all that they want to
[3:03:26] know and may not know all that they will
[3:03:28] eventually come to know by revelation,
[3:03:31] but they know one thing. They know how
[3:03:34] to help Samson get his arms around the
[3:03:38] pillars.
[3:03:41] His
[3:03:44] enemy put him between the pillars, but
[3:03:47] he's blind
[3:03:49] and he needed help getting his arms
[3:03:51] around the pillars.
[3:03:54] Did you know they have uncovered not too
[3:03:56] long ago, they've uncovered some of
[3:03:58] these temples in what would have been
[3:04:00] called Felistia or or or in the Gaza.
[3:04:05] And the pillars, these temples were
[3:04:07] built around two
[3:04:10] wooden pillars
[3:04:12] but with solid metal sockets
[3:04:18] 6 feet apart
[3:04:22] and and that's all the main the whole
[3:04:25] building built around. Brother Brandham
[3:04:27] calls it a upside down mushroom.
[3:04:30] I don't know exactly what that means but
[3:04:31] he says it more than once. He said they
[3:04:33] sort of built their temple and it looked
[3:04:35] like an upside down mushroom
[3:04:37] and they've just recently found them and
[3:04:39] they found the sockets of the pillars in
[3:04:41] more than one uh ruins of temples
[3:04:45] to Deegon and they were six feet apart.
[3:04:48] So we know uh through through
[3:04:50] archaeology we know that that was the
[3:04:52] structure of these particular places of
[3:04:56] uh entertainment
[3:04:58] but dedicated to the worship of a false
[3:05:01] god.
[3:05:02] six feet apart and massive pillars.
[3:05:07] So, it took a pretty pretty big stretch.
[3:05:14] Kind of when I was a boy, I had a
[3:05:16] stretch Armstrong.
[3:05:19] You could just stretch their arms
[3:05:21] forever.
[3:05:23] Some of you don't even know what that
[3:05:25] is.
[3:05:29] It took something
[3:05:31] took somebody's
[3:05:34] because this isn't one one one
[3:05:37] boy. It is in the story, but it's a
[3:05:39] type.
[3:05:41] For me, it is.
[3:05:43] And and the whole purpose of that
[3:05:46] remnant was to help
[3:05:49] the bride church Samson now
[3:05:53] position himself,
[3:05:55] get in position
[3:05:59] for the final glory.
[3:06:05] The sad thing is
[3:06:09] Samson lost his reputation.
[3:06:15] He died
[3:06:18] in the process
[3:06:21] but with greater glory.
[3:06:23] I don't want to
[3:06:26] put carnal thoughts in your mind.
[3:06:29] This isn't some kind of
[3:06:32] suicide.
[3:06:34] This is a very spiritual thing.
[3:06:38] I'm going to close as the musicians are
[3:06:40] coming by saying the remnant matters.
[3:06:44] Those who have an ear to hear matter.
[3:06:48] It doesn't matter whether you're
[3:06:50] embraced,
[3:06:52] celebrated, recognized, beloved by the
[3:06:56] others.
[3:06:57] What matters is you keep your focus on
[3:07:00] Jesus
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; and his word and his life and be
[3:07:05] available in an hour when somebody needs
[3:07:09] to know where the pillars are.
[3:07:12] &gt;&gt; The pillars are what held the whole
[3:07:14] thing up.
[3:07:17] And somebody's going to need to know
[3:07:19] where the pillars are.
[3:07:23] So you're going to have to stay with the
[3:07:25] word. I'm going to have to stay with the
[3:07:28] word because while the hair is growing
[3:07:31] out, God is getting ready to restore
[3:07:34] power
[3:07:36] to a little bride because the rapture is
[3:07:38] a reality. I believe it.
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; I believe it. But there's going to
[3:07:43] require some positioning
[3:07:46] and that is going to demand that our
[3:07:49] eyes are in the right place and our
[3:07:52] lives are built on the right place and
[3:07:55] that we carry the right spirit
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; and the right attitude toward our
[3:08:00] enemies
[3:08:02] and our fellow brethren.
[3:08:05] Because perfect love
[3:08:09] is going to be the key
[3:08:12] that brings Samson and the little boy
[3:08:17] back together.
[3:08:19] It is. It's going to be love. It's going
[3:08:21] to require love.
[3:08:23] And that means you and I have to be
[3:08:26] ready.
[3:08:28] We have to be ready for whatever God
[3:08:31] has. Let's stand.
[3:08:38] We don't have time to worry about our
[3:08:41] someone sitting in our seat.
[3:08:46] We've got to lay it all down. Lord, let
[3:08:48] our lives be laid down today.
[3:08:53] May our only agenda be yours.
[3:08:57] There's a world that's dying while we're
[3:08:59] in here trying to get it right.
[3:09:02] May we carry this great light that you
[3:09:05] have placed within your people. May we
[3:09:07] carry it outside the four walls of this
[3:09:10] building and be an inspiration to those
[3:09:13] who are groping in the darkness. We have
[3:09:15] described the condition of the church
[3:09:18] that's supposed to be alive.
[3:09:21] But but the the condition of the world
[3:09:23] around us is dark.
[3:09:26] They're depending. They're looking.
[3:09:27] They're hoping for something.
[3:09:32] We are going to be required
[3:09:35] to provide what is needed.
[3:09:39] That means it has to be hanging on the
[3:09:41] walls. It's got to be here. It's got to
[3:09:43] be with us and in us because they're
[3:09:46] going to come. And they're going to come
[3:09:49] because we've shined the light.
[3:09:52] And they're going to need deliverance.
[3:09:53] And they're going to need help. And
[3:09:55] they're going to need hope.
[3:09:59] Lord Jesus, wake us up in this hour and
[3:10:03] help us to recognize
[3:10:05] that the best is yet to come.
[3:10:09] We get tired and weary in mind and body,
[3:10:11] but Lord,
[3:10:14] we thank you for the hope
[3:10:17] and we thank you for the reviving of our
[3:10:20] inner man.
[3:10:22] Your word quickens us and challenges us.
[3:10:27] We've seen enough of the realm of flesh
[3:10:31] and we long we long to draw breath
[3:10:36] from the realm of spirit.
[3:10:40] Yours life.
[3:10:46] Your life.
[3:10:49] Oh Jesus, we reach up. Would you just
[3:10:52] reach your hand up toward him? Lord,
[3:10:55] fill me. Fill me with your life. Fill me
[3:11:00] with your life.
[3:11:02] Fill me with your life.
[3:11:05] You're a covenantkeeping God.
[3:11:09] Even when we drop the baton, you're a
[3:11:11] covenant keeping God.
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; Even when we lay our head in the lap of
[3:11:16] that, you're a covenantkeeping God.
[3:11:20] So, we're here to celebrate today, Lord,
[3:11:22] that you cannot change your word and
[3:11:26] what you've promised, you will bring to
[3:11:29] pass.
[3:11:31] &gt;&gt; And we get to be a tiny little part, oh
[3:11:33] Lord, just a tiny little part of what
[3:11:36] you're doing.
[3:11:38] &gt;&gt; Use our youth, use our elderly, use all
[3:11:40] the in between.
[3:11:42] Use us in the kingdom of our God.
[3:11:47] I wonder would you just any of you just
[3:11:49] want to come for a moment? We're doing a
[3:11:51] little different right now and you just
[3:11:52] want to come and and stand with me in
[3:11:55] the front and we we just want to say
[3:11:57] Lord if you can use anyone you can use
[3:12:00] me. I'm here today Lord making myself
[3:12:04] available again.
[3:12:06] I may not understand it all but I
[3:12:08] surrender and I say Lord you you make it
[3:12:11] clear I'll do it. You you make it plain.
[3:12:14] I'll obey. You show me the way, I'll
[3:12:16] walk in it, Lord.
[3:12:18] I I don't want uh stagnant life. I I
[3:12:22] don't want death. I want uh all that you
[3:12:25] have made available and provided for me
[3:12:28] by the word and the spirit. Revive us,
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; resuscitate us, renew us this day. Let
[3:12:36] us be rooted and grounded in the center
[3:12:39] of your word and be movable and bendable
[3:12:43] and pliable as the spirit of God would
[3:12:46] breathe over us and move over us even in
[3:12:49] this hour. Uh may we remember the word
[3:12:52] of the Lord 30 years ago. And may we may
[3:12:56] we uh hear the voice that says, "Samson,
[3:12:59] the enemy is upon you. Wake up. Wake up.
[3:13:03] This isn't the hour to be asleep
[3:13:05] spiritually. It's the hour to be alert.
[3:13:10] I I I believe that the Lord is depending
[3:13:14] on you and I and others.
[3:13:17] But you and I put ourselves in. Write
[3:13:20] yourself in. See yourself in it.
[3:13:24] And let's just humble ourselves to him
[3:13:26] for just a moment. Play something
[3:13:28] softly. And it doesn't have to be
[3:13:30] special. just just something that comes
[3:13:32] to your mind or heart and let us just
[3:13:35] talk to the Lord a minute as individuals
[3:13:38] not one doing all the praying but you
[3:13:40] also saying s I surrender Lord I know I
[3:13:43] may have surrendered last night in
[3:13:44] prayer I may have surrendered yesterday
[3:13:47] I may have said use me last week but
[3:13:49] again Lord I come today and I say
[3:13:52] whatever your will is whatever your way
[3:13:55] is cut the tether
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; that holds me in this flesh realm and
[3:14:00] Let me see with spirit eyes the mind of
[3:14:04] God for this hour. Let me catch a fresh
[3:14:07] vision of what you want to do in your
[3:14:10] people.
[3:14:12] And and and and may I stop shoveling it
[3:14:14] on to someone else. Today is the day I
[3:14:17] quit shoveling. And today is the day
[3:14:19] that I say, Lord, if you can use
[3:14:21] anybody, why don't you just start right
[3:14:22] here in me? Sisters, you the same. Don't
[3:14:27] you know your ministry matters? Don't
[3:14:29] you know your life matters to your
[3:14:32] children first and to others that you
[3:14:34] would dare to live a life in front of?
[3:14:37] Move, spirit of God. Pick me up above my
[3:14:42] habits and my and my addiction and my
[3:14:46] and my uh time thieves and let me just
[3:14:50] surrender to you. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[3:14:54] Yes. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes Lord, if
[3:14:59] you can use anyone, you can use me.
[3:15:03] And here I am to say, Lord, have your
[3:15:07] way.
[3:15:09] Put a fire in me, Lord. Like like fire
[3:15:12] in my bones.
[3:15:14] And if I would start to chill, let the
[3:15:17] fire of God rise up in me.
[3:15:23] Let the word of the Lord
[3:15:28] &gt;&gt; come rushing forth
[3:15:32] &gt;&gt; out of our lives,
[3:15:34] &gt;&gt; speaking life, not our thoughts, our
[3:15:37] opinions.
[3:15:38] &gt;&gt; But may we speak the word of the Lord
[3:15:40] into our families, into our
[3:15:43] circumstances,
[3:15:45] into our situations.
[3:15:48] Because position matters more in this
[3:15:50] hour than it has ever. Alliances and
[3:15:53] allegiances and positionings matter more
[3:15:56] in this hour than they've ever mattered
[3:15:58] before as we shape up for the final
[3:16:01] showdown. Lord, use us.
[3:16:05] Use us. Ben, get a microphone and just
[3:16:07] softly just start singing what they're
[3:16:09] playing
[3:16:12] &gt;&gt; again and again.

[3:18:58] Jesus.
[3:19:03] &gt;&gt; Sing it out.
[3:19:04] Let them hear you.
[3:19:05] &gt;&gt; I got nothing new.
[3:19:10] How could I express?
[3:19:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my gratitude.
[3:19:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my gratitude.
[3:19:21] &gt;&gt; I could sing these songs
[3:19:26] &gt;&gt; as I often do.
[3:19:32] Every song must end.
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, and you never do.
[3:19:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:19:42] &gt;&gt; So I throw up my hands and praise you

[3:27:05] Oh God, let the coal of fire settle in
[3:27:10] the inner man.
[3:27:12] Oh God, let it come forth with authority
[3:27:17] and uncction in the name of the Lord
[3:27:21] Jesus Christ
[3:27:24] may stand
[3:27:26] exactly where you have positioned him.

[3:27:36] drawing from the old and ancient well
[3:27:40] that's within him. Spirit
[3:27:43] of God,

[3:28:13] the task at hand. Revive and renew and
[3:28:18] strengthen Lord the very fiber at the
[3:28:22] very fiber and root of who she is.
[3:28:25] Jesus,
[3:28:28] let there be results. Results, Lord.
[3:28:31] That's what we want for encouragement.
[3:28:34] Just let us see the good results of the
[3:28:37] prayers, the good results of the faith.
[3:28:40] Lord, let us see the fruit.
[3:28:46] Lord, raise up a mighty standard around
[3:28:49] her life
[3:28:51] always against every arrow and against
[3:28:55] every uh target the enemy. You know, the
[3:28:59] uh the the darts of the enemy that would
[3:29:03] fly because of where they stand. May
[3:29:07] they just be drawn up into a higher
[3:29:11] place, Lord, in you where it doesn't
[3:29:13] matter. Let let any misunderstanding
[3:29:16] just fall off of them
[3:29:19] &gt;&gt; as they climb, Lord, as they climb. New
[3:29:21] heights, new places in the spirit of the
[3:29:25] Lord. Oh God,
[3:29:28] &gt;&gt; they're not afraid to dig, Lord. They've
[3:29:30] shown you that they're not afraid to
[3:29:32] dig. Now, open up the gusher. Open up
[3:29:35] the gusher, Lord. Open it up, I pray,
[3:29:38] over this sweet, precious, godly family.
[3:29:41] Open it up, Lord, and let them come into
[3:29:45] the fullness of the calling that you
[3:29:48] have placed over their lives. Give them
[3:29:51] this wicked place. Give them, give them
[3:29:54] authority,
[3:29:56] oh God, where the enemy has taken his,
[3:30:00] may they rise up with God's authority in
[3:30:03] this hour. and pull down religious
[3:30:07] strongholds
[3:30:09] and demonic powers that would like to
[3:30:13] rule and reign the atmosphere.
[3:30:16] And may they find the lost sheep, oh
[3:30:20] God. May they find them
[3:30:24] in the name of Jesus.
[3:30:34] Precious Lord,
[3:30:40] &gt;&gt; you've given them five champions.
[3:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:30:46] &gt;&gt; You could have given them pretty little
[3:30:47] girls,
[3:30:49] but you gave them five warriors.
[3:30:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, you did.
[3:30:52] &gt;&gt; Five champions. Oh, God. Use these
[3:30:55] precious young men.
[3:30:58] from the youngest to the oldest. Use
[3:31:00] them in greater ways with greater
[3:31:02] anointing.
[3:31:04] May the giftings of their lives
[3:31:06] increase. May their sincerity
[3:31:09] increase. May they learn wisdom's ways.
[3:31:16] May they not grow weary or discouraged.
[3:31:28] Oh Jesus.

[3:38:34] had to do it. Kate, come and sing
[3:38:36] something for us. We're going to worship
[3:38:37] one more to one more song before we go
[3:38:41] today.
[3:38:43] We're going to ask the Lord to come and
[3:38:44] seal over your life. Anything that he
[3:38:48] has done for you today, anything that
[3:38:50] you opened your heart and let him do, I
[3:38:53] pray that it chases you home, follows
[3:38:55] you everywhere you go
[3:38:58] until you make all the room that is
[3:39:00] needed and necessary for it to come and
[3:39:02] just take a hold of who you are. There's
[3:39:04] a beautiful spirit. I mean, a beautiful,
[3:39:07] beautiful piece in this house right now.
[3:39:10] And I think we ought to leave by
[3:39:12] worshiping him.
[3:39:14] And I I don't think we have to come and
[3:39:16] make announcements at the end. You know,
[3:39:18] when we have church, come if you feel
[3:39:21] like coming and want to be here Tuesday
[3:39:24] night, etc., etc., etc.
[3:39:27] But right now, let's just worship and
[3:39:29] and and
[3:39:31] when we're done, we we go.
[3:39:38] There's something that your voice
[3:39:39] carries, brother, that I think we have
[3:39:41] to have a little of before we leave.
[3:39:51] You need to sit your care.
