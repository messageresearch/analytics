[0:00] i form the light create darkness
[0:04] i make peace and create evil i the lord
[0:08] do all these things
[0:16] what good reason could god possibly have
[0:21] in creating darkness and evil
[0:24] [Music]
[0:25] why would he do such a thing you see we
[0:28] have grown up in a world
[0:30] in a society in an environment that is
[0:34] constantly focused on this thought
[0:37] that a good god would only allow good
[0:40] things
[0:43] to all people and when we come down to
[0:47] crisis
[0:48] and when we have to deal with stuff
[0:51] people ask the age-old question
[0:54] why do bad things happen
[0:57] to good people there's no answer
[1:00] that's going to satisfy everybody but i
[1:03] know a verse that will shut you up
[1:06] i form the light create darkness
[1:10] i make peace and create evil i the lord
[1:14] do all these things we could almost hear
[1:18] god saying at the end it's really none
[1:20] of your business
[1:22] i'm working something you can't see just
[1:25] yet
[1:26] i'm doing something bigger than you are
[1:28] i'm pulling
[1:29] something together that you know not of
[1:32] because i'm god
[1:34] he's not a god who's defeated by his
[1:36] enemy
[1:37] he's not a god who's thrown off by
[1:39] circumstances
[1:40] or decisions or votes of men he's a god
[1:43] that knows his will
[1:46] he knows what he means he means what he
[1:50] says
[1:51] it's not a perfect world our
[1:53] circumstances are not perfect but our
[1:56] god
[1:56] is perfect and he's working a work in
[2:00] us getting us ready for an
[2:03] hour that there will be such courage
[2:08] such strength that you would be able to
[2:12] look the enemy right in the eye
[2:14] and say i will not i cannot
[2:17] i must not deny my lord
[2:24] we've got to be trained
[2:28] to serve a good god and to love him
[2:31] with everything we have all capacity
[2:34] we've got to
[2:35] love him more than anything else and we
[2:37] i want you to know something
[2:39] his praises have to continually be in
[2:41] our mouth because if his praises
[2:43] are not continually be in our mouth our
[2:45] bellyaching will
[2:46] override our praise our complaining will
[2:49] override our
[2:50] praise that's why we've got to make a
[2:51] conscious effort to discipline ourselves
[2:54] to praise god in the good times and in
[2:56] the bad times
[2:57] in the times we understand his plan in
[2:59] the times we don't understand his plan
[3:02] he's still god he's still god
[3:06] and so the lord our shepherd the good
[3:10] shepherd the creator of all things
[3:13] uses our enemies our
[3:17] circumstances that are adverse
[3:20] to correct us and to keep us in line
[3:25] not because he despises us but because
[3:28] he adores
[3:30] us and we are struggling in time
[3:35] god is functioning from eternity
[3:38] and reaching into time but how many of
[3:41] you know
[3:42] there's an hour that time can no longer
[3:45] be
[3:46] measured time will be no more
[3:49] and only eternity will remain
[3:52] and in eternity what
[3:56] looks so terrible here
[3:59] in eternity looks like just another rung
[4:02] on the ladder
[4:03] to get us closer to him aren't you glad
[4:06] god doesn't listen to the emotional cry
[4:09] of man
[4:11] he listens to my heart my mind
[4:15] says i can't take another moment
[4:19] but my heart says don't turn loose of me
[4:22] lord until you have molded me
[4:25] and shaped me and made me
[4:28] the overcomer i was born to be
[4:32] my mind says oh god i can't take any
[4:35] more
[4:35] but my heart says please lord don't
[4:38] leave me alone
[4:40] stay with me don't take your hand off of
[4:45] me
[4:47] squeeze me i tell
[4:50] you the devil could not accomplish one
[4:53] single thing
[4:58] had he not been created and
[5:01] picked up and placed in service
[5:04] for his creator now you tell me if you
[5:08] think god is going to let the
[5:10] ax boast himself
[5:15] against the one who holds the axe you
[5:18] think
[5:18] god's going to let the hammer get the
[5:20] last word
[5:22] not in not in the life of israel as a
[5:25] nation
[5:26] and not in our lives as children
[5:29] of the most high god no sir
[5:33] he is not going to allow your enemy to
[5:36] have the final boast
[5:39] you are bought with a price
[5:43] it's the truth it's the truth
[5:56] you
