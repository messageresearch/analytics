[40:36] Tennessee friends of mine for over 30
[40:39] years sister Shirley has been suffering

[40:48] pain got so bad the other night that
[40:50] they rushed her to the hospital and they
[40:52] have found some spots and
[40:56] blockages and they believe that it's
[40:59] ugly stuff but they don't have the final
[41:03] analysis yet it's very it's very serious
[41:06] it's very very
[41:08] urgent it's blocking it's there's a
[41:11] blockage there and they're not sure if
[41:14] it's a tumor or malignancy or what it is
[41:18] and then they found some other
[41:20] spots the doctor used the word
[41:23] aggressive without telling them for sure
[41:26] without the Bible biopsy that the family
[41:29] is is really shattered and they are

[42:01] woman has been through more emotionally
[42:05] than most people I know would you ask
[42:07] the Lord to give her complete and total
[42:10] victory over whatever it is if that is
[42:13] his will she would only want his perfect
[42:17] will I know that forgive me for
[42:20] interrupting
[42:22] brother I I'm going to interrupt myself
[42:25] this morning I the heavenly father just
[42:27] so precious to meet with us this morning
[42:29] yes few weeks ago in our darkest hour I
[42:32] caught someone praying in a specific way
[42:35] and I kind of watched God adjust his
[42:39] train because the way this person was
[42:42] praying and I want to challenge you like
[42:45] Ruth of old like her mother-in-law told
[42:48] her now Ruth when you go into Boaz you
[42:50] pull that skirt
[42:52] down you get in there have the courage
[42:55] this morning as we ask in faith grab
[42:58] hold of his train this
[43:01] morning and allow the word of God what
[43:03] did he say he healed us with his word do
[43:05] you want his word this morning there's
[43:07] nothing else that we desire this morning
[43:09] but the word of God it's the same
[43:12] yesterday today and forever it cannot
[43:14] fail us
[43:19] [Music]
[43:21] Church cannot fail this
[43:24] morning Oh Lord You're Lord this morning
[43:27] morning there's no God like our God this
[43:30] morning why the world worships in some
[43:33] false Pagan form today we come to the
[43:37] Christ of Calvary that did not just die
[43:41] but he rose again and that life he sent
[43:44] back on his Saints and he said if your
[43:47] heart condemns you not ask what you
[43:52] will here we are today Lord we pour out
[43:55] our petitions there are many
[43:57] oh God we're asking you to perform your
[44:00] word once again as we lay under the
[44:03] train of your glory today Lord would you
[44:07] cover us and allow us to become the
[44:10] manifested word of God for the day an
[44:13] hour we live in

[44:45] come into your glory as if we were
[44:47] Sanctified enough we don't come into
[44:49] your presence as if we were glorified oh
[44:52] God the glory that we are is
[44:55] you it's just you
[44:58] will you wash over us will you put a
[44:59] glow in our heart will you put a spring
[45:02] in our step a smile on our face that the
[45:05] world would desire to know what we've
[45:08] come in contact
[45:10] with oh so many things to distract so
[45:13] many things to dissuade but oh God I am

[46:29] me for I'm a man of unclean
[46:32] lips I'm
[46:34] undone but when he got in the presence
[46:37] of the
[46:38] Lord his terminology changed his voice
[46:42] his his words
[46:44] changed after he got in the presence of
[46:46] the Lord he heard the voice of the Lord
[46:49] said who will go for
[46:52] me but because he'd been in the presence
[46:55] of the Lord it was no longer woe is

[59:05] [Applause]
[59:10] hallelujah
[59:12] hallelujah you may be seated a moment
[59:16] there is an unusual
[59:18] atmosphere on the platform
[59:21] today I don't know if you're feeling it
[59:24] or not but there's something
[59:27] unusual that's happening on the platform
[59:29] I feel it in a in a I know that I don't
[59:33] have to run all these
[59:34] disclaimers but we don't we don't live
[59:38] by feeling I know all of
[59:40] that this isn't my first
[59:43] service but I know when there is
[59:46] something
[59:47] shifting so I wasn't surprised at what
[59:49] brother Daniel was sharing and he
[59:52] couldn't have helped himself just this
[59:55] is what I want you to understand there
[59:57] was such an inspiration that was flowing
[59:59] on the platform during worship that I I
[1:00:03] was
[1:00:04] preaching the entire time there were
[1:00:07] just there was an inspiration that came
[1:00:10] on every
[1:00:12] line that that that God connected it in
[1:00:15] my heart in my mind to something that is
[1:00:19] real and Rich and and I've learned that
[1:00:22] when that happens just speak it you you
[1:00:26] don't have to you don't have to do it
[1:00:28] loudly to disturb any but speak it out
[1:00:31] get it out of your mouth because there's
[1:00:35] such power uh he told us that there's
[1:00:40] power in the words the words that come
[1:00:44] out of our mouth they're they're both
[1:00:47] death and life that's in the tongue and
[1:00:51] I'm so thankful for for that inspiration
[1:00:55] I I feel it here and I don't know what
[1:00:58] will happen next but thank you for being
[1:01:02] along for the
[1:01:03] ride I appreciate it I I was standing
[1:01:06] there first giving thanks to God for a
[1:01:11] people like you who do not have to be
[1:01:15] prompted who do not have to be led by a
[1:01:18] cheerleader a praise leader saying won't
[1:01:21] you praise the Lord won't you lift your
[1:01:23] hand won't you say Amen won't you
[1:01:25] glorify the Lord why don't you get in
[1:01:27] here because you understand you
[1:01:32] understand what happens when we step
[1:01:36] from our comfort zone you know I I I
[1:01:40] you're quiet that's okay but but I don't
[1:01:42] accept all those excuses that we can
[1:01:45] make when we get in our flesh and our
[1:01:47] carnality we start saying things like
[1:01:50] well I'm an
[1:01:52] introvert you know you've been filling
[1:01:54] out too many questions questiones to
[1:01:56] figure out who you are you need to take
[1:01:59] a look in the
[1:02:03] book this will take you don't have to
[1:02:05] know what color you are on somebody's
[1:02:07] scale or what your letter is or what
[1:02:10] your personality type is we're not
[1:02:13] looking for our
[1:02:15] horoscopes you want to know who you are
[1:02:17] take a look just take a little trip
[1:02:19] through this book and let God Quicken to
[1:02:23] your heart the reality that this is you
[1:02:26] this is your story this isn't just his
[1:02:29] story this is your
[1:02:32] story and and I'm just so thankful for
[1:02:36] uh you this morning very very thankful
[1:02:39] for every one of you I can also feel the
[1:02:43] streamers and I know that there are some
[1:02:45] on the other end of this connection who
[1:02:48] are not sitting there with hands
[1:02:50] folded uh in some kind of sacred hush
[1:02:55] but I know that on the other end there
[1:02:57] are hands lifted up there are uh shouts
[1:03:00] of Praise there are tears there is joy
[1:03:04] and I can feel it when when uh you can
[1:03:07] too if you if you would think about it
[1:03:09] we can feel when people are connecting
[1:03:12] uh on a level of Faith it's important to
[1:03:15] put your faith in if you want something
[1:03:19] out you want something out of the
[1:03:21] service then you put something in I
[1:03:24] don't mean the offering place I mean
[1:03:26] your praise I mean your effort well I I
[1:03:29] I'm just bashful well I'm just shy look
[1:03:31] folks I don't see how you could possibly
[1:03:33] be so bashful that you could lift your
[1:03:36] hand you know we'll even let you do it
[1:03:38] Methodist
[1:03:40] style you know I think at times that's
[1:03:43] all right I'm just so I'll be honest
[1:03:46] with you one time my shoulder started
[1:03:47] freezing up and I'm so thankful that
[1:03:50] mine will still go over my head till I
[1:03:52] like to put it there as often as I can I
[1:03:56] would that men everywhere would lift up
[1:03:58] holy hands without wrath and without
[1:04:03] doubt there's there's not hatred in my
[1:04:06] heart toward anybody this morning and I
[1:04:09] don't doubt that he's exactly who he
[1:04:11] says he is so it doesn't mean that I am
[1:04:15] perfect it doesn't mean that I've got it
[1:04:16] all figured out it means that under
[1:04:19] those two circumstances I am invited by
[1:04:22] the New Testament to lift my hands and
[1:04:25] pray praise the Lord if you're mad at
[1:04:28] somebody
[1:04:30] repent I led a repentance prayer in my
[1:04:33] office this morning you you repent say
[1:04:37] Lord forgive me I don't want to be mad
[1:04:39] at anybody I don't want to have one
[1:04:41] scratch of ought against anybody you can
[1:04:44] get that taken care of in less than 30
[1:04:46] seconds because you're not an
[1:04:49] orphan you're a Son of
[1:04:52] God and so all you have to do is say
[1:04:55] father I I am so sorry I really have let
[1:04:58] something enter into my heart and it
[1:05:00] started as a grain of sand and now I
[1:05:03] feel that it is becoming a a larger more
[1:05:07] like a cocko bur and it's it's agitating
[1:05:10] me and it's affecting my worship so Lord
[1:05:13] would you help me to get my eyes off of
[1:05:16] whatever this is that has been sent my
[1:05:19] way as a distraction and let me look to
[1:05:22] you Lord and see you in in Who You Are
[1:05:26] and remind me of who I am and and that
[1:05:29] took more than 30 seconds but you don't
[1:05:30] have to do all that you just say Lord
[1:05:32] help me forgive me have mercy on me well
[1:05:35] well I don't want to raise my hands
[1:05:37] because I I uh my wife you know I raised
[1:05:40] my voice you shouldn't do that but you
[1:05:43] just repent to God to her and lift up
[1:05:45] your hands well well I I just sass my
[1:05:49] husband or I did this or my kids or all
[1:05:52] you have to do is say Lord please have
[1:05:54] mercy I don't want this to be a repeated
[1:05:56] Behavior I don't want to keep losing it
[1:05:59] I don't want to keep losing my cool have
[1:06:01] mercy on me but I am here today to come
[1:06:04] into that presence and the only way to
[1:06:07] do it is to make my way in so I've got
[1:06:09] to move these things out of the way I
[1:06:11] want to say one more thing before we
[1:06:13] before we move on and I was just blessed
[1:06:17] by what brother gley shared about Isaiah
[1:06:20] and God showed me something along those
[1:06:23] lines many many years ago when you you
[1:06:25] look at Isaiah 6 where brother gley was
[1:06:29] talking under the inspiration from that
[1:06:32] song If if you will look at uh Isaiah 4
[1:06:37] I'm not going to give a reference for
[1:06:38] her to to to particularly pull up but if
[1:06:42] you would look at Isaiah 4 and excuse me
[1:06:46] Isaiah
[1:06:47] 5 uh I don't know how many times I've
[1:06:50] underlined it uh in verse 8 in verse 11
[1:06:55] in verse 18 in verse 20 in verse 21 in
[1:07:00] verse
[1:07:01] 22 I have underline this prophet Isaiah
[1:07:07] prophesying and each one of those times
[1:07:09] he says woe unto them now that's what a
[1:07:12] prophet's called to do to prophesy a
[1:07:15] warning woe unto them woe unto them woe
[1:07:17] unto them woe unto them you can't be
[1:07:19] offended in him he was doing his job he
[1:07:23] was doing what God had birthed him to do
[1:07:27] and and he was saying woe to you if you
[1:07:30] if you in fact in verse 20 he said woe
[1:07:32] unto them that call evil good and good
[1:07:36] evil that put Darkness for light and
[1:07:40] light for darkness that put bitter for
[1:07:43] sweet and Sweet for bitter 21 woe unto
[1:07:48] them that are wise in their own eyes and
[1:07:51] prudent in their own sight they think a
[1:07:55] little more themselves than they ought
[1:07:57] and verse 22 wo unto them that are
[1:07:59] Mighty to drink wine and Men of strength
[1:08:02] to mingle strong drink it it that's just
[1:08:06] three of the instances but I want you to
[1:08:09] know in uh chapter 6 as brother gy
[1:08:13] called it out and as we sung it in
[1:08:15] Isaiah 61 it says in the year that King
[1:08:18] oziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a
[1:08:21] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:08:25] filled the
[1:08:27] temple and his
[1:08:30] response now he was doing his job in
[1:08:33] chapter five woe unto them he was
[1:08:35] warning them giving them the counsel of
[1:08:37] the Lord amen are you
[1:08:39] listening but once he encountered this
[1:08:44] tangible glory of the Lord that shook
[1:08:47] the pillars of the house and shook him
[1:08:51] out of this tremendous grief of losing
[1:08:55] his
[1:08:57] mentor now there were a lot of things
[1:08:59] about Uzziah that that couldn't be
[1:09:01] admired but there were some things that
[1:09:04] he could be respected for and we learned
[1:09:06] that Isaiah had great respect for King
[1:09:10] Uzziah and he had he had his countenance
[1:09:13] had fallen because a friend or a mentor
[1:09:16] had died he's just prophesied woe unto
[1:09:19] them what and now the Lord comes it's
[1:09:23] powerful I I I don't want you e it when
[1:09:25] you get home but these seraphim begin to
[1:09:28] come in crying one to another holy holy
[1:09:31] holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[1:09:33] earth is full of his glory verse four
[1:09:36] and the post of the door moved at the
[1:09:39] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:09:42] was filled with that's not cigarette
[1:09:46] smoke that that's not smoke from the
[1:09:48] forest fire that's holy smoke that's the
[1:09:52] glory of the Lord in a tangible way can
[1:09:55] do that now he
[1:09:59] can and he doesn't need the smoke
[1:10:02] machine he can do it a and the post of
[1:10:05] the door move and then listen look at
[1:10:07] verse five he spent the whole chapter uh
[1:10:10] five woe unto them but look at five of
[1:10:14] of chapter six then said
[1:10:19] I woe is
[1:10:22] me for I am
[1:10:24] undone because I am a man of unclean
[1:10:27] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[1:10:29] people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[1:10:32] have seen the king the Lord of hosts one
[1:10:36] Glimpse through the revelation of his
[1:10:39] word one glimpse of his Beauty his
[1:10:42] majesty his Holiness his authority and
[1:10:45] you will recognize that you don't have
[1:10:48] much time unless it's your assignment as
[1:10:50] a prophet you don't have much time to
[1:10:52] Woe anybody else
[1:10:57] you don't have much time to critique
[1:10:59] anybody else whoo under the he was doing
[1:11:01] his job folks I'm not I'm not
[1:11:04] criticizing him he was doing what God
[1:11:06] called him to do but when he saw the
[1:11:09] Lord ride in on pillars of smoke and
[1:11:13] shake the very Foundation post of the of
[1:11:16] the house of the Lord and his train is
[1:11:18] filling the temple and the Lord is
[1:11:20] sitting on the throne he he then said
[1:11:23] the next thing out of his lips was not
[1:11:25] of this filthy people that you've called
[1:11:27] me to it was my own lips are filthy my
[1:11:31] own lips are unclean and I've been sent
[1:11:34] to a people that have unclean lips so
[1:11:36] Lord you better start with me how many
[1:11:39] of you think we ought to just take the
[1:11:40] attitude of Isaiah today before we go
[1:11:43] home and we ought to say Lord just start

[1:15:19] um I just got that
[1:15:21] in but it was in love wasn't a sledg
[1:15:24] hand
[1:15:26] just a little Mallet tapping but uh
[1:15:30] we're doing that
[1:15:31] because for some the younger ones are

[1:15:36] Hour they tell me they're going to uh
[1:15:38] we're going to have a time of worship at

[1:15:52] be uh we will be Gathering between 6:00
[1:15:56] and 6:30 we say that because there will
[1:15:58] be setup involved and it would be
[1:16:01] wonderful if we could start the meal at
[1:16:03] 6:30 but if that doesn't happen uh it's
[1:16:05] important that you get here as close to
[1:16:07] 6:30 as possible so that we can can
[1:16:10] start eating and getting that out of the
[1:16:12] way and uh we're going to have a
[1:16:14] wonderful time it seems like it's been

[1:22:04] light would you just give God praise
[1:22:07] there was a little misunderstanding or
[1:22:09] miscommunication this morning about
[1:22:11] music and uh Benjamin then reached out
[1:22:15] and and some of you people had no power
[1:22:18] how many of you were without power in
[1:22:19] the night wow the campground was without
[1:22:22] power several hours and so it just
[1:22:25] didn't work out and and uh Benjamin just
[1:22:28] turned to Kate and said well you you're
[1:22:31] on and I'm so thankful that he was both
[1:22:34] willing and anointed to do so let's
[1:22:36] thank God for all the musicians they're
[1:22:38] just
[1:22:39] givers they just give and give and give
[1:22:42] and
[1:22:45] give and they're talented and blessed
[1:22:49] and we pray for their uh gifts that they
[1:22:52] will increase and be magnified
[1:22:55] and
[1:22:56] anointed because the anointing is what
[1:22:59] makes the difference do you believe that
[1:23:01] this morning would you turn in your
[1:23:04] Bibles I I've I've got so many notes
[1:23:08] here um would you turn in in fact I
[1:23:12] don't even have exactly everything I
[1:23:15] thought I had but would you turn to John
[1:23:18] you're going to have to forgive me
[1:23:19] because I really had a time this
[1:23:22] morning I just um I knew what the Lord
[1:23:26] had laid on my heart for this service
[1:23:28] but then
[1:23:30] I almost second guessed myself and and I
[1:23:34] was almost running well I was running a
[1:23:36] little bit late to even get
[1:23:38] here um because of that but it's all is
[1:23:42] good and we're here and we're here for a
[1:23:45] reason you believe that let's let's just
[1:23:48] go to John chap 10 beginning in verse
[1:23:51] one I I want to I want to call this
[1:23:54] message today Jesus's sermon at the
[1:23:58] Feast of
[1:23:59] dedication it is such a powerful chapter
[1:24:04] a and it would take us more than one
[1:24:07] service to break down this
[1:24:09] sermon you know I was reading this week
[1:24:13] where brother brandham and maybe might
[1:24:14] even be in one of the quotes I share
[1:24:16] with you this morning he's talking about
[1:24:19] the ministry of Our Lord only being
[1:24:22] three and a half years right I'm telling
[1:24:26] you that's a successful Ministry isn't
[1:24:28] it we've got so much that has been
[1:24:32] recorded about his Earthly Ministry and
[1:24:36] in the realm of time it only lasted
[1:24:39] three and a half years the Bible also
[1:24:43] tells us that that the
[1:24:45] world the world could not contain the
[1:24:49] Scrolls if everything that he did in his
[1:24:53] ministry was
[1:24:55] recorded now I mean to tell you what
[1:24:58] that says to me is his ministry was not
[1:25:01] only shifting things on the Earth but
[1:25:05] also all the way to the third heaven
[1:25:08] things were being moved around there's
[1:25:11] no telling what kind of confusion was
[1:25:15] caused in the second heaven where the
[1:25:18] enemy puts his throne and where his imps
[1:25:21] like us to dwell the prince of the power
[1:25:23] of the air the scripture tells us and so
[1:25:27] in order to record everything that was
[1:25:30] happening in Earth in second heaven
[1:25:33] third heaven all the way into the throne
[1:25:35] room of God the the the world wouldn't
[1:25:38] be big enough the LI there wouldn't be a
[1:25:40] library big enough to
[1:25:42] contain uh we're blessed to have four
[1:25:45] gospels aren't we we're blessed to have
[1:25:47] them and when we look at John chapter 10
[1:25:51] it's so rich that we could never get to
[1:25:55] it all this morning but I want to focus
[1:25:57] on the fact that it took place during a
[1:26:02] very special time in Israel I know
[1:26:05] you're standing but let me just give you
[1:26:08] the context here for just a moment and
[1:26:10] that is there are approximately 400
[1:26:14] years between the Old Testament the
[1:26:17] older Covenant and the New Testament
[1:26:20] what we would call the newer Covenant
[1:26:23] which is not a repl replacement of the
[1:26:25] old it is a fulfillment it's a
[1:26:28] fulfillment of the old and we're
[1:26:30] thankful for that he didn't come to
[1:26:32] destroy the instruction he came to fill
[1:26:35] it up I want you to know he did and more
[1:26:38] he filled it up everything the prophets
[1:26:41] of the old Covenant wrote about him he
[1:26:43] was that he did that he manifested that
[1:26:47] can you say Amen am so we're blessed by
[1:26:50] that but there was a
[1:26:52] 400e period of History uh between the
[1:26:57] Testaments and it was during that time
[1:27:01] uh that the the
[1:27:03] Army uh that we read about not in
[1:27:06] scripture but in history because again
[1:27:09] it was between the Testaments we read if
[1:27:12] you have ever looked at the book of
[1:27:14] mccabes let me say
[1:27:16] quickly to all
[1:27:19] critics I'm not in any way saying that
[1:27:22] it's inspired but brother brandham also
[1:27:25] quoted at times from
[1:27:27] Josephus who was a Jewish historian
[1:27:30] considered to be a traitor by the Jews
[1:27:33] because he reported some things
[1:27:35] concerning the ministry of Jesus and the
[1:27:38] early Apostles in a positive way so the
[1:27:41] Jews called him a traitor but we quote
[1:27:44] him because he wrote some things from a
[1:27:47] historical standpoint not
[1:27:50] inspired brother green one of my mentors
[1:27:53] that God used used in my life he enjoyed
[1:27:56] reading also for pleasure for for
[1:27:58] instruction some of those discarded uh
[1:28:02] books not giving them inspiration to the
[1:28:05] same level in any way of the scripture
[1:28:07] but but feeling like that there was
[1:28:10] perhaps something to glean that would
[1:28:13] help perhaps even make the scripture
[1:28:16] richer because it comes from a different
[1:28:19] perspective but lines up with the book
[1:28:21] did you follow that
[1:28:23] explanation so if you're looking at the
[1:28:25] book of mccabes or others they cover
[1:28:27] this period of time between the two
[1:28:30] Testaments and they tell us of what what
[1:28:33] we understand this great occupation of
[1:28:36] the Greek armies and uh the seusd armies
[1:28:40] and the destruction that They carried
[1:28:43] out in in Israel and the Jews were
[1:28:46] forbidden to circumcise their own babies
[1:28:49] I I'm going to tell you something when
[1:28:51] the government moves in and tells you
[1:28:53] you can't circumcise your own children
[1:28:55] you can't read your own scripture you
[1:28:58] can't worship the way that the the your
[1:29:00] your scripture tells you to worship uh I
[1:29:03] I've got a little bit of a problem with
[1:29:04] that we come to the New Testament where
[1:29:07] the apostles said we ought to obey God
[1:29:10] rather than man amen he tells us Render
[1:29:13] unto Caesar all that is Caesar's and
[1:29:15] unto God all that is God's and as much
[1:29:17] as lith possible with all of us we want
[1:29:20] to we want to we want to live in
[1:29:22] Holiness and we want to treat every body
[1:29:24] just as good as we can but sometimes we
[1:29:26] must stand for the word and so this
[1:29:30] family of the of the macbes we call them
[1:29:33] uh they they were just sick and tired of
[1:29:35] being sick and tired they wanted to
[1:29:38] worship God the god of Israel the way
[1:29:41] that they were commanded to worship Him
[1:29:43] and they were sick and tired of these
[1:29:45] generals coming one Army after another
[1:29:47] taking their freedom away from them and
[1:29:49] they said die if we must but we're going
[1:29:52] to stand up
[1:29:54] and God stood with them history records
[1:29:58] that God stood with them in such a
[1:30:02] profound way that they were able to
[1:30:05] drive back this whole Army the sald Army
[1:30:08] was turned backwards under its great
[1:30:11] General and they even as you hear me say
[1:30:14] often they even used elephants in
[1:30:18] Warfare but God let this little family
[1:30:21] and some rag tag uh tag along
[1:30:24] to push back the darkness for a period
[1:30:27] of time to to tear down the idols that
[1:30:31] had been built in the Holy Temple uh the
[1:30:34] the the uh statue that had been raised
[1:30:36] to Zeus or Jupiter depending on whether
[1:30:38] you're looking at Roman or Greek history
[1:30:41] tear it down and cleanse the altar that
[1:30:44] had been desecrated with with a hog a
[1:30:46] pig had been killed on the holy Altar
[1:30:50] and uh they scrubed that away and they
[1:30:54] rededicated the temple and it became a
[1:30:56] minor Feast not one of the Feast of
[1:30:59] Jehovah of the older Covenant but it
[1:31:02] became a minor Feast among the Jewish
[1:31:04] people the only reason why it means so
[1:31:06] much to me two reasons one is that in
[1:31:09] John 10 we find Our Lord in the temple
[1:31:12] during that time and we learn that if
[1:31:16] the scripture mentions the time he was
[1:31:18] there because all Jews were commanded to
[1:31:20] be there at least three times a year if
[1:31:22] the scripture mentions said he was there
[1:31:24] at a time other than the than the
[1:31:26] festivals that were commanded that a
[1:31:28] Hebrew man present himself there's a
[1:31:31] reason for it being mentioned we find
[1:31:33] that all the way through both
[1:31:36] covenants uh I love that because we
[1:31:39] weren't there and we don't know what
[1:31:40] time it was and most of the time we're
[1:31:42] reading the gospels we don't know what
[1:31:44] time of the year it was but if it tells
[1:31:47] us it tells us for a reason and I want
[1:31:50] to stand against paganism and and I want
[1:31:53] to stand against defilement and the
[1:31:56] mixture that comes with with that with
[1:31:59] that stuff can you imagine putting an
[1:32:01] idol right up in the house of God it's
[1:32:05] it's a serious crime a and so I think it
[1:32:08] will help us to see the the setting the
[1:32:12] time frame and what was being
[1:32:15] commemorated when Jesus preached one of
[1:32:17] the greatest sermon some people debate
[1:32:19] and they say the Beatitudes was the
[1:32:21] greatest sermon or The Sermon on the
[1:32:23] Mount but I think John 10 is one of the
[1:32:26] greatest sermons that he preached
[1:32:27] because this was the day that he decided
[1:32:32] by inspiration to tell the world who he
[1:32:34] really
[1:32:35] was he'd been hiding his true
[1:32:38] identity until this moment and In This
[1:32:41] Moment he wanted to let all all the
[1:32:44] truth out there and it really cost him
[1:32:47] something didn't it it did so John 10
[1:32:51] verse one verily verily I say unto you
[1:32:55] he that entereth not by the door into
[1:32:58] the Sheepfold but climbeth up some other
[1:33:02] way the same is a thief and a robber and
[1:33:07] that's that's just really good
[1:33:09] instruction would I ever like to preach
[1:33:11] about that but but he that enter
[1:33:14] entereth in by the door is The Shepherd
[1:33:19] of the sheep to him the porter openeth
[1:33:23] and the sheep hear his voice and he
[1:33:28] calleth this is red letter and he
[1:33:31] calleth his own
[1:33:33] Sheep by name he knows my name I want
[1:33:36] you to look at somebody and say He Knows
[1:33:38] My
[1:33:39] Name he knows my name and he leadth them
[1:33:43] out praise God and when he putteth forth
[1:33:47] his own sheep he goeth before them if
[1:33:49] he's sending them out of the fold he
[1:33:52] goes before them
[1:33:54] leading them Hallelujah and the Sheep do
[1:33:58] what for
[1:34:00] they know his voice and a stranger will
[1:34:05] they not follow there's something about
[1:34:08] that stranger's voice but they will flee
[1:34:12] from him for they know not the voice of
[1:34:16] strangers may God add his Blessing to
[1:34:18] the reading of his word I see that you
[1:34:20] need your seat and you may have it God
[1:34:22] bless you thank you thank you for your
[1:34:24] patience to stand for my introductory
[1:34:29] sermonette verse 6 this Parable spake
[1:34:32] Jesus unto them uh but this is commonly
[1:34:36] the case they
[1:34:39] understood
[1:34:41] not come with me they understood not
[1:34:45] what things they were which he spake
[1:34:48] unto them so he's talking and they're
[1:34:51] hearing or they're listening but they're
[1:34:54] not understanding they're not Discerning
[1:34:57] it's like talking to a brick
[1:34:59] wall anybody ever experience that in
[1:35:02] your family life or your work life or
[1:35:04] your you realize that they're hearing
[1:35:07] the audible sound of your voice but
[1:35:10] there is no discernment no understanding
[1:35:13] in what you are saying to them and Jesus
[1:35:16] found this to be the case often in his
[1:35:18] three and a half years of Earthly
[1:35:20] Ministry and it's very sad because even
[1:35:23] today it's that way a bit then said
[1:35:26] Jesus unto them again verily verily I
[1:35:31] say unto you I am the door of the
[1:35:36] sheep all that ever came before me are
[1:35:40] thieves and robbers but the Sheep did
[1:35:42] not hear them if you understand anything
[1:35:45] about the second temple period you will
[1:35:48] know that many Heroes were rising up
[1:35:51] among the rebels the zealots and were
[1:35:56] declaring themselves to be the Messiah
[1:35:59] one by the name of
[1:36:01] Barba and there were many others who who
[1:36:05] uh wanted to draw a following and they
[1:36:08] wanted to lead the the people in a
[1:36:11] revolution that would have most likely
[1:36:13] ended in their in their Annihilation so
[1:36:17] God wouldn't let that happen do you
[1:36:19] understand uh the real Messiah was on
[1:36:22] his way and the scripture tells us that
[1:36:25] that something is going to be done the
[1:36:27] prophet of the Old Testament something
[1:36:29] is going to be done that's never been
[1:36:31] done before I'm going to do something
[1:36:34] that's never happened in the earth
[1:36:35] before a
[1:36:37] virgin not just a young Maiden but a
[1:36:41] young untouched Maiden is going to Bear
[1:36:45] a child think of this and he's going to
[1:36:49] be called Yeshua Jesus for for he will
[1:36:54] bring Salvation to his people it will be
[1:36:59] misunderstood but it will come it will
[1:37:02] happen at the right time at the right
[1:37:05] moment under the right conditions and
[1:37:08] the New Testament tells us in the
[1:37:11] fullness of
[1:37:13] times when time had filled up and the
[1:37:16] Earth could not go on any longer without
[1:37:20] a messiah without a savior showing up
[1:37:24] he was not going to allow the city of
[1:37:28] Jerusalem to continuously be trampled
[1:37:31] underfoot by its enemies uh keeping back
[1:37:35] the Messiah if you study a little bit
[1:37:37] about history here you'll find out that
[1:37:40] many of those who came and occupied the
[1:37:42] land of Israel did it because they had
[1:37:45] been warned that a messiah was going to
[1:37:48] come and set the Jewish people free and
[1:37:51] they thought if we go and occupy the
[1:37:53] land and persecute the Jews uh then we
[1:37:57] will keep the Messiah from coming it's
[1:37:59] much like today when you go to Israel
[1:38:02] and you you see the Eastern Gate how
[1:38:05] many of you know what I'm talking about
[1:38:07] the Eastern Gate of the Temple Mount and
[1:38:10] the Bible said that Messiah will come
[1:38:13] through that gate and so the Palestinian
[1:38:17] people the Muslims particularly they
[1:38:20] said well we know that a Jew will not
[1:38:22] pass a especially a A levite or a rabbi
[1:38:25] a holy man will not pass through a
[1:38:28] graveyard it's forbidden in their law
[1:38:31] the law of scripture so what we'll do is
[1:38:33] we'll bury our
[1:38:35] dead right in
[1:38:37] front of of the mountain so that he will
[1:38:41] not come through that I want you to know
[1:38:44] folks there has been no military General
[1:38:48] alive there has been no no people no
[1:38:52] religious people of any kind kind that
[1:38:54] have the power to keep Messiah back when
[1:38:57] the times are
[1:38:59] full and it it was so then and it's so
[1:39:03] now when Rapture time is here it'll be
[1:39:07] here whether you're ready or not it's
[1:39:10] here now we're in the process of rapture
[1:39:13] now we're already experiencing a portion
[1:39:17] of that Rapture now and and when that
[1:39:20] final culmination comes in a in a
[1:39:23] twinkle of an eye you won't be able to
[1:39:25] hold it back and he's not going to wait
[1:39:27] on you to be ready amen you understand
[1:39:31] he's just coming and you you better be
[1:39:33] ready and then when the second coming
[1:39:35] comes and he puts his foot on the Mount
[1:39:37] of Olives not one person or some uh
[1:39:42] campaign or whatever else is going to
[1:39:45] move that out of the timing of the lord
[1:39:48] I want you to know it is imperative I
[1:39:50] wish you'd help me it's imper erative
[1:39:54] for us to know not only the truth for
[1:39:58] the bride but to know the season the
[1:40:01] timing of the Bride the timing of the
[1:40:04] promises of God and we as a people have
[1:40:08] often missed our
[1:40:10] season the Bible talks about how they
[1:40:13] missed their day of what their day of
[1:40:18] visitation I have preached to you that
[1:40:20] if you plant the wrong seed the right
[1:40:22] seed excuse me you plant the right seed
[1:40:25] in the wrong season you won't get the
[1:40:28] right
[1:40:29] Harvest certain things you plan in the
[1:40:32] cold weather Fall going into winter
[1:40:35] certain things you plan after the Tha
[1:40:37] right it's not only important to have
[1:40:39] the right seed of truth it's important
[1:40:42] what you do with it and in what season
[1:40:45] there's a season to sew there's a season
[1:40:48] to reap there's a season to grieve
[1:40:51] there's a season to dance
[1:40:54] Ecclesiastes tells us for everything
[1:40:56] there is a season I want to be one of
[1:40:59] those who moves in the discernment of
[1:41:02] the Lord to know what season we're in
[1:41:06] and what we must do about the season
[1:41:09] that we're in there's a time to be
[1:41:12] passive hello there's a time to be
[1:41:16] active time to be quiet and wait and
[1:41:19] rest and there's a time to war that's
[1:41:23] right amen sir there's a few Hills that
[1:41:25] I'm willing to die on for truth amen
[1:41:29] there's a few things that are you know
[1:41:31] they don't really matter here or there
[1:41:33] it's uh uh it it's uh up for you know
[1:41:37] personal conviction or interpretation
[1:41:39] but there are a few Hills that I'm
[1:41:42] willing to give my life for I didn't
[1:41:44] just get in this yesterday and I
[1:41:47] certainly didn't get in it for a
[1:41:49] paycheck I want you to understand that
[1:41:52] because I did it when there was very
[1:41:54] little of that so it has nothing to do
[1:41:58] with the compensation that comes with it
[1:42:00] I was marked to do what I'm doing amen I
[1:42:04] have failed many many times at it but
[1:42:08] I'm thankful for as brother gy said the
[1:42:12] endurance you're still here here we are
[1:42:15] 2024 still going
[1:42:18] on started this ministry in 1975
[1:42:23] and still going on by the grace of God
[1:42:26] not because of man's favor but because
[1:42:29] of the favor of the Lord and you have
[1:42:31] fought your battles because you also
[1:42:33] have a Ministry whether it's pull pit or
[1:42:36] not and you have fought your battles to
[1:42:39] get to where you are don't give up now
[1:42:42] don't compromise now don't look for
[1:42:46] loopholes now don't look for a way to
[1:42:49] get out now stand your ground is anybody
[1:42:55] here stand your ground so Jesus is
[1:43:00] talking about uh you better hear my
[1:43:03] voice I'm The Shepherd of the sheep I'm
[1:43:07] the Good Shepherd and remember in The
[1:43:10] Sermon on the Mount I believe it is he
[1:43:12] says some are going to tell you that the
[1:43:14] Lord is coming over here and some are
[1:43:16] going to say he's coming over there go
[1:43:18] out to meet him he said don't listen to
[1:43:21] what they say there they're they're here
[1:43:24] to deceive you you listen for the voice
[1:43:27] of the Good
[1:43:29] Shepherd listen to his voice it's his
[1:43:35] voice pastors and other uh officers of
[1:43:39] the fivefold ministry they're under
[1:43:43] underlings they are subservient they
[1:43:46] must be submitted to the great Shepherd
[1:43:50] we we like to call a pastor a shepherd
[1:43:53] because the scripture indicates that
[1:43:54] that's part of his role but remember
[1:43:57] he's just serving under the great
[1:44:00] Shepherd you need to listen for the
[1:44:02] great Shepherd's voice in the voice of
[1:44:05] your
[1:44:08] Shepherd you need to listen to the
[1:44:10] pastor of pastors see if you can hear
[1:44:13] his voice in what you're hearing this
[1:44:15] morning if you can't then I I I I I pray
[1:44:19] for us both we both need to be
[1:44:21] remembered this morning then
[1:44:23] he goes on therefore doth my father
[1:44:26] verse 17 love me because I laid down my
[1:44:29] life that I may take it again 10:17
[1:44:34] that's right no man taketh it from me so
[1:44:38] don't you be guilty of saying that Jesus
[1:44:42] was
[1:44:43] murdered it would be impossible to
[1:44:46] murder the
[1:44:48] Creator he died because he surrendered
[1:44:51] to death nobody took his life he laid it
[1:44:56] down as an offering for
[1:44:59] Jason for an April that's right right
[1:45:02] brother for a
[1:45:05] Rebecca for an
[1:45:07] elas he laid it down as an offering as a
[1:45:11] sacrifice he said I have power to lay it
[1:45:14] down and I have power as we learn I have
[1:45:16] power to take it up again and he did on
[1:45:19] the third day this commandment have I
[1:45:22] received of my father verse
[1:45:24] 19 uh there was a division therefore
[1:45:27] again among the Jews for these sayings
[1:45:29] they're already finding fault with what
[1:45:32] he's saying and many of them said he
[1:45:34] hath a devil wow and is
[1:45:37] mad why hear ye him now let me just stay
[1:45:40] right there just a moment please this
[1:45:43] was their
[1:45:45] discernment these are religious men
[1:45:48] these aren't just Devils these are
[1:45:49] religious men men who knew the law men
[1:45:53] who knew the
[1:45:55] quotes and this was their discernment
[1:45:58] not just some Fly by Night opinion they
[1:46:01] got together they put their thinking
[1:46:03] caps on and they put their heads
[1:46:05] together and they came up with this
[1:46:07] corporate discernment this is a devil
[1:46:10] here he's here to cause trouble in the
[1:46:12] temple he's mad which means out of his
[1:46:15] head with a mental
[1:46:17] illness why do you even listen to him
[1:46:20] now they are saying this not on
[1:46:24] Facebook not on
[1:46:26] Instagram like this week they're saying
[1:46:29] that in the
[1:46:31] temple you're going to find out in a
[1:46:33] minute they're in the temple saying
[1:46:37] this and it'd be like you jumping
[1:46:41] up and interrupting the preacher I don't
[1:46:44] advise
[1:46:47] it and and and pulling a service uh
[1:46:51] distractingly
[1:46:53] on away
[1:46:54] from Brother bam tells us that even the
[1:46:57] gifts shouldn't interrupt the preaching
[1:47:00] right right he said the spirit of the
[1:47:02] Prophet is subject unto the prophet if
[1:47:04] you've got a word from the Lord you can
[1:47:05] hold it just as good as you can give
[1:47:09] it and sometimes it really is the best
[1:47:13] way you'd be surprised how many words I
[1:47:16] have heard from him that I just took
[1:47:19] right back to
[1:47:20] him and I said Lord this is what you
[1:47:23] showed me for so and so I'm bringing
[1:47:25] this back to you because I'm not sure
[1:47:28] how to deliver this so I will lay it at
[1:47:31] your feet and if I know anything about
[1:47:33] you I know you know how to get this
[1:47:35] message across I'm trusting you you've
[1:47:38] let me have this assignment to pray it
[1:47:41] through maybe not to deliver it but to
[1:47:44] pray it through many times intercessors
[1:47:47] receive assignments for prayer and we're
[1:47:50] accomplishing more in prayer sometime
[1:47:53] than we are putting ourselves out there
[1:47:55] can anybody understand what I'm saying
[1:47:58] this was their
[1:47:59] discernment this man has a devil he's
[1:48:02] out of his head he needs a
[1:48:05] psychiatrist this was their religious
[1:48:08] spiritual
[1:48:10] discernment they couldn't be any further
[1:48:12] from the truth could they why are you
[1:48:14] listening to him they said others said
[1:48:17] these are not the words of him that hath
[1:48:19] a devil can a devil Open the Eyes eyes
[1:48:22] of the blind so theirs was not the only
[1:48:26] discernment there were others in the
[1:48:28] crowd that said wait a minute there's
[1:48:29] something here I know his words feel a
[1:48:32] little uh
[1:48:34] divisive they don't seem like the the
[1:48:36] Orthodox opinion they seem a little edgy
[1:48:41] but then he turns and gives sight to the
[1:48:44] blind so we should at least hear him out
[1:48:49] and then we read uh sister charity in
[1:48:52] vers
[1:48:53] 22 and it was at
[1:48:57] Jerusalem let's pause there a moment we
[1:49:00] know
[1:49:02] where we know where it happened in the
[1:49:06] city unlike any other
[1:49:10] city on the face of the Earth the only
[1:49:14] city that God's word has said is an
[1:49:17] eternal City and many have tested that
[1:49:21] by trying to destroy it to the ground
[1:49:24] in fact the old city is higher than the
[1:49:27] valleys around it simply because
[1:49:30] civilization after civilization has has
[1:49:33] destroy been destroyed there and they
[1:49:35] just keep building and building and
[1:49:37] building and building on top on top on
[1:49:39] top and so many have tried to annihilate
[1:49:43] it to utterly wipe it out but God has
[1:49:48] not allowed it because it is a type of
[1:49:51] the bridal
[1:49:53] City it's a type of you and I
[1:49:56] spiritually it sits on Zion's Hill are
[1:50:00] you listening to me it sits on Zion's
[1:50:02] seel of which you and I are a type we're
[1:50:05] a partial fulfillment of God's word to
[1:50:09] Zion and he tells us prophetically that
[1:50:12] out of
[1:50:15] Zion not just a city but a people will
[1:50:19] come a final word
[1:50:23] of
[1:50:24] Deliverance that will break every Yol
[1:50:27] and every Fetter that stands in its way
[1:50:31] how many of you want to get under a Word
[1:50:33] of Deliverance like that you want to be
[1:50:35] free from everything that binds you
[1:50:37] impedes you slows you down hinders you
[1:50:40] in any way at all amen don't let it get
[1:50:43] cold too cold in here for the folks I
[1:50:45] sweat regardless so adjust for them if
[1:50:49] you need
[1:50:50] to so we know know that it was at
[1:50:53] Jerusalem when brother brandham is
[1:50:54] preaching the the
[1:50:57] crucifixion he talks about uh and I I
[1:51:01] might not get this just right brother gy
[1:51:03] or brother Daniel you could help me but
[1:51:06] he's talking
[1:51:07] about yes there they
[1:51:11] crucified there in a city the most holy
[1:51:16] city they the most religious men so it
[1:51:21] matters where these things happen
[1:51:24] so we are told that this sermon took
[1:51:27] place in the city of
[1:51:29] Jerusalem in the Feast of the
[1:51:33] dedication we don't find that when we
[1:51:35] look at the Old Testament because as
[1:51:37] I've told you before it happened in the
[1:51:40] middle
[1:51:42] period
[1:51:43] intertestamental period it's called 400
[1:51:46] years
[1:51:47] between and when these Jews
[1:51:53] decided we're going to take back what is
[1:51:56] ours and they tore down that Pagan Idol
[1:52:01] I cannot imagine raising up this Jupiter
[1:52:06] this
[1:52:09] Zeus in the Holy
[1:52:12] Temple if you were here Tuesday night
[1:52:15] you learned from the
[1:52:17] scripture that God doesn't like mixture
[1:52:21] in worship
[1:52:23] I I mentioned to the church here many
[1:52:25] things are
[1:52:27] pagan in the sense that they had an
[1:52:29] origin in some other Society or
[1:52:34] civilization one that did not recognize
[1:52:37] Jehovah as God it doesn't mean
[1:52:40] particularly that everything like that
[1:52:42] is evil because as I told you I've been
[1:52:45] told multiple times that even the neck
[1:52:47] tie and the
[1:52:49] suit is from a pagan uh time period did
[1:52:53] and that we should you know I said oh
[1:52:56] brother if you really want to push that
[1:52:58] one I'm ready to believe that
[1:53:00] Doctrine who wants to put this harness
[1:53:03] on your neck anyway to present yourself
[1:53:05] it's just a uh it's not comfortable most
[1:53:08] of the time for me but we do it it's not
[1:53:11] that we must refrain from everything
[1:53:15] that may have its origin somewhere in a
[1:53:17] society or civilization that didn't
[1:53:19] honor God as God but we're not to take
[1:53:23] those things and make them a
[1:53:27] part of our
[1:53:30] worship of our religious faith our true
[1:53:33] faith God doesn't want us mixing things
[1:53:36] that are used to worship false gods in
[1:53:39] our worship of the one true Living God
[1:53:42] the thing you need to know about what we
[1:53:44] call Hanukkah or the Feast of dedication
[1:53:47] is they were worshiping the only true
[1:53:51] Living God whether you call him Jehovah
[1:53:54] or Yahweh or yah or
[1:53:57] Y or whatever God right whether you
[1:54:01] spell it G O D or gyen D because the
[1:54:06] religious Jews believe that it's not
[1:54:08] even proper to put to put God on paper
[1:54:12] that's right because he's too holy
[1:54:14] that's right and his name should be
[1:54:17] reverenced and Sanctified and revered
[1:54:20] whatever you call him you need to know
[1:54:23] that they were worshiping that one true
[1:54:25] Living God and they were so angry at
[1:54:29] what the woke Society of the
[1:54:31] intertestamental period had accomplished
[1:54:34] that they said we're not only going to
[1:54:36] whip
[1:54:37] you and defeat you on the hills of Judea
[1:54:41] but we're going to go back to our Temple
[1:54:44] fight our way back Wade through
[1:54:47] hell
[1:54:49] blood whatever comes against us
[1:54:54] elepants
[1:54:55] arrows
[1:54:58] catapults
[1:55:00] Spears but we're going all the way to
[1:55:02] the Holy Hill we're going in the temple
[1:55:06] and we're going to set things back in
[1:55:08] order and we're going to cleanse the the
[1:55:11] altar of God because you pagans have
[1:55:17] offered pigs blood and uncer animal
[1:55:23] one of the filthiest animals there are
[1:55:25] according to
[1:55:27] scripture you've offered his blood on
[1:55:30] the altar of Jehovah God the one true
[1:55:33] Living God we're going to scrub it up
[1:55:34] we're going to get it out we're going to
[1:55:36] get the stench
[1:55:39] on of swine out and the armies of
[1:55:45] swine we're taking down that
[1:55:48] big statue that you've erected in the
[1:55:51] Holy place
[1:55:53] we're going to turn the manora up right
[1:55:57] we're going to light it again we're
[1:56:00] going to let the light of the
[1:56:03] truth Shine from the Holy Hill of Zion
[1:56:09] again come
[1:56:11] on and we don't care what you think
[1:56:13] about it so get out of our way these are
[1:56:17] champions they're
[1:56:20] Patriots like many Pat rots raised up in
[1:56:23] this nation
[1:56:25] recently to say enough is
[1:56:28] enough we're done with W
[1:56:31] Society we're done with all of this
[1:56:34] tolerance we're done with a dozen
[1:56:38] genders on we're we're tired of this
[1:56:42] mess we're going to stand up for what's
[1:56:45] right many said we're going to cross
[1:56:47] political
[1:56:49] lines we're going to offend our family
[1:56:52] amilies we're going to stand against
[1:56:55] popular
[1:56:56] current we're going to be called
[1:56:58] ignorant
[1:57:00] Hillbillies but we're tired of this
[1:57:04] compromise let me tell you something
[1:57:07] it's like when Jesus a few weeks ago the
[1:57:09] lord gave me that word how he turned
[1:57:12] over the temple he turned over the
[1:57:14] tables in the
[1:57:15] temple and he did it because the
[1:57:18] scripture said he was
[1:57:20] consumed with a zeal
[1:57:22] of the Lord's
[1:57:24] House I believe that's some of what the
[1:57:27] macbes got under a Zeal to see something
[1:57:32] clean something holy something
[1:57:37] pure without a
[1:57:40] compromise and they fought for it and
[1:57:43] Jesus could have been anywhere this is
[1:57:46] the point I want you to hear he could
[1:57:48] have been anywhere he could have been in
[1:57:49] the gal the Galilee
[1:57:52] he could have been in Nazareth visiting
[1:57:54] his family he could have been out on the
[1:57:58] beach near cesaria or modern natana or
[1:58:04] Tel or
[1:58:05] Jaffa on the
[1:58:07] coast he could have been in the
[1:58:10] sand he he could have been in the Dead
[1:58:13] Sea closer to Jericho he could have even
[1:58:17] branched all the way down into the
[1:58:19] netive there are many places in Israel
[1:58:23] that he could have been rightfully so
[1:58:25] during the Feast of the dedication
[1:58:27] because it was not a commanded Festival
[1:58:30] it was not a time that the male Jewish
[1:58:33] men were were commanded to appear in
[1:58:35] Jerusalem at the temple but the Bible
[1:58:38] tells us specifically that this was a
[1:58:40] particular time that he chose to be
[1:58:44] there to say that he that it had nothing
[1:58:48] to do with what we now call Hanukkah in
[1:58:50] the Feast of dedication is is absolutely
[1:58:55] ignorance of course it had something to
[1:58:58] do with it at least he knew there would
[1:59:01] be somebody there to preach to because
[1:59:04] many had come to the city to celebrate
[1:59:07] this cleansing and rededication of the
[1:59:11] temple he also knew that he was going to
[1:59:13] present himself as the light of the
[1:59:15] world and one of the themes of the Feast
[1:59:19] of dedication was and is
[1:59:22] light Let it shine let your little light
[1:59:28] shine we've been lighting the candles
[1:59:30] this week and singing to Elana he's the
[1:59:34] light of the world she likes
[1:59:37] singing and but she really prefers over
[1:59:42] he's a lot of the world she really
[1:59:44] prefers This Little Light of
[1:59:48] Mine I'm going to let it shine it will
[1:59:51] take on a new meaning to you when you
[1:59:55] see your little
[1:59:58] grandbaby or your
[2:00:01] child eyes light up when you're singing
[2:00:06] not only is he the light of the world
[2:00:09] Jesus gave me this light and I'm going
[2:00:13] to let It Shine Jesus gave me this light
[2:00:18] and I'm going to let it shine folks
[2:00:21] that's the reason reason you were
[2:00:24] born you were born to get the light from
[2:00:28] him and to reflect
[2:00:30] it brother bam said the world wants
[2:00:35] mixers the church is looking for mixers
[2:00:39] for
[2:00:40] blenders the modern church is looking
[2:00:42] for
[2:00:45] chameleons who will land on a brown Limb
[2:00:48] and turn
[2:00:50] brown or a red brick and turn red but
[2:00:55] God is looking for a people who will
[2:00:58] stand on the
[2:01:00] word with a backbone like a
[2:01:04] solog with a determination of a salmon
[2:01:08] not to go with the flow like a jellyfish
[2:01:11] I'm going to stand on the
[2:01:14] word now to all of these people who say
[2:01:18] it didn't matter Christmas doesn't
[2:01:20] matter and it didn't the celebration of
[2:01:22] it doesn't matter would you also say
[2:01:26] that the godhead doesn't
[2:01:29] matter because many people say that
[2:01:32] right in fact in this modern Church
[2:01:34] World many have gone as far as to say
[2:01:36] Doctrine doesn't matter can you imagine
[2:01:40] saying in church anity
[2:01:45] truth yeah I feel passion sure I do
[2:01:48] truth doesn't matter somebody let me to
[2:01:52] matters I hear them say I read their
[2:01:55] articles sometime it doesn't matter how
[2:01:57] many persons you see in the godhead it
[2:02:00] can be however you see it well that
[2:02:03] doesn't make much sense to me you don't
[2:02:07] create the reality of God you may be
[2:02:11] duplicating a god you may be producing a
[2:02:14] God who fits your church doctrine but
[2:02:17] you're not changing the unchangeable god
[2:02:21] come on he is
[2:02:24] one am he always was one he will always
[2:02:28] he's one
[2:02:30] today he'll always be
[2:02:33] one
[2:02:34] amen somebody said you don't believe in
[2:02:37] the three I actually do I believe in
[2:02:40] three and more that's right I believe
[2:02:42] there are more offices and
[2:02:46] manifestations and administrations of
[2:02:49] who God is he's not just father Son and
[2:02:52] Holy Ghost he's a lawyer he's a
[2:02:54] counselor he's a great physician he's my
[2:02:58] best
[2:02:59] friend he's lily of the valley he's
[2:03:02] bright and Morning Star he's wonderful
[2:03:06] he's the Mighty
[2:03:09] God and yes he is the Everlasting father
[2:03:13] he's all of that and so much more and
[2:03:18] yet he humbled himself a God so big that
[2:03:21] planet Earth could not contain him and
[2:03:24] yet he humbled himself to come in flesh
[2:03:27] the Flesh of one
[2:03:29] man my my my and now he's humbled
[2:03:32] himself to come and live in
[2:03:35] you and in me somebody ought to squeeze
[2:03:38] an amen well I've got to hurry I I mean
[2:03:41] this my notes aren't helping me too much
[2:03:43] that's good because they they just
[2:03:46] seemed to confuse me this morning I
[2:03:48] didn't know how I would get to all of it
[2:03:50] so let me just do this is under
[2:03:52] inspiration so it was at Jerusalem it
[2:03:55] was during the Feast of the dedication
[2:03:58] and it
[2:03:59] was now listen anybody living in the
[2:04:04] Earth at that time would have
[2:04:08] known that the Feast of
[2:04:11] dedication took
[2:04:13] place in
[2:04:16] winter so this was not recorded for only
[2:04:20] those who were there
[2:04:22] right it was recorded for you and
[2:04:25] I because there are those who say well
[2:04:29] uh how do I know that Hanukkah wasn't
[2:04:31] adjusted and the Feast of dedication
[2:04:34] wasn't adjusted uh until uh close to the
[2:04:37] winter uh Equinox just like Christmas
[2:04:41] which would make it as Pagan as
[2:04:43] Christmas we know that because the
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:49] scripture the scripture is silent about
[2:04:53] what month he was
[2:04:56] born but the scripture is clear here in
[2:04:58] John 10 we know that it was the Feast of
[2:05:02] dedication he was in the temple we know
[2:05:04] because it tells us he was at Solomon's
[2:05:07] colonade and we know that it was in the
[2:05:12] season of
[2:05:14] winter now I don't know about you but I
[2:05:16] learned a little bit in high school
[2:05:18] starting about the ninth grade in
[2:05:20] literature uh about a
[2:05:23] setting a setting is important in a book
[2:05:26] it's important in a play it's important
[2:05:29] even in a
[2:05:30] poem and the author if he cares enough
[2:05:33] to tell you where it took place who was
[2:05:37] there what it looked like how it went
[2:05:40] down what happened for this is important
[2:05:43] stuff so if the Bible recorded that he
[2:05:47] was there in winter in Jerusalem at the
[2:05:49] temple for the Feast of dedication it
[2:05:52] must mean that he did not believe that
[2:05:56] this was a pagan uh
[2:06:00] event if you're trying to tell me that
[2:06:03] you believe that he would have been
[2:06:05] there to celebrate something
[2:06:10] Pagan and that the Holy Spirit would
[2:06:13] have preserved this verse for you and I
[2:06:16] to know where it was and what season so
[2:06:20] that we could remember a pagan event I'm
[2:06:23] so sorry you'll never be able to
[2:06:26] convince me of that he knew exactly what
[2:06:29] it was commemorating it was in fact
[2:06:31] commemorating everything that he was
[2:06:33] most passionate
[2:06:37] about
[2:06:38] light
[2:06:40] life amen the destruction of evil he
[2:06:44] came he
[2:06:45] came to destroy the works of the Dark of
[2:06:48] the devil didn't the scripture say he
[2:06:50] came to destroy destroy those Works he
[2:06:53] came to raise up something higher he
[2:06:56] came to tear down the error and the LIE
[2:06:59] oh there's so many principles just do a
[2:07:01] little search just do a little search
[2:07:02] what are the Christian principles
[2:07:04] represented in the in the in the
[2:07:06] Festival of Hanukkah or the Feast of
[2:07:07] dedication and and and you will find a
[2:07:10] list that go all the way through the
[2:07:12] scripture of the
[2:07:14] themes that speak to us to our hearts as
[2:07:18] modern Believers though we are not Jews
[2:07:22] We are following a book of the Jews a
[2:07:26] book that was given to them
[2:07:28] first the Bible doesn't say that Jews
[2:07:31] are grafted into the Gentile
[2:07:36] Vine Romans 11 tells us that the
[2:07:39] Gentiles are the branches that are
[2:07:42] grafted in that's to the root that's of
[2:07:47] the Jews it doesn't mean everything
[2:07:49] modern Jews do today is right or
[2:07:51] everything that they celebrate or
[2:07:53] everything that they work with because
[2:07:55] they've got their own little sex and
[2:07:56] things out there too doesn't mean that
[2:07:58] but what it means is the the Hebrew
[2:08:02] scripture we are grafted
[2:08:05] in oh you want to make people
[2:08:14] mad they've mentioned my
[2:08:18] teeth they've mentioned my ti
[2:08:23] they've mentioned gravy on my tie which
[2:08:27] was not the case I think that was to say
[2:08:29] I was fat what was the other one Zach
[2:08:32] what was the one you sent teeth someone
[2:08:34] sent something else they've mentioned
[2:08:37] everything that could be me what a sad
[2:08:40] old
[2:08:41] man I'm I he must be the life of the
[2:08:48] party what we need to do is get him a
[2:08:51] Christmas present it'll fix
[2:08:55] everything I I I'll do what I did
[2:08:57] Tuesday night I'll refuse it I'll say no
[2:09:00] no no give that to someone who would
[2:09:01] appreciate it I don't celebrate
[2:09:03] Christmas so I'm not I'm I just wouldn't
[2:09:06] feel right I know brother brandom I know
[2:09:09] that he received it in in a in a sweet
[2:09:11] spirit and he should have and I and I
[2:09:14] get that and most of the time I might
[2:09:15] would do the same but there are just
[2:09:18] certain times that you you feel tested
[2:09:21] right brother Daniel it reminded me when
[2:09:24] I left here it reminded me of the time I
[2:09:27] don't know who of you were with us but
[2:09:29] it reminded me of the time I was in
[2:09:31] England
[2:09:32] preaching and a a a woman possessed of a
[2:09:35] demon Spirit tore up the service she'd
[2:09:38] come flying over the the the heads of
[2:09:42] the people it seemed to Lunge for the
[2:09:44] Altar for
[2:09:46] me had they told me that she had just
[2:09:49] tried to stab the pastor recently I I
[2:09:53] probably would have stood on the other
[2:09:54] side of the pool
[2:09:55] pit but nobody told me that we prayed
[2:09:58] for that little woman and wrestled with
[2:10:00] that thing until the Lord finally
[2:10:02] released authority over it I happened to
[2:10:05] remember that sister yordis was there
[2:10:07] brother Eric Norman was there uh brother
[2:10:10] Frank Christensen was there and
[2:10:14] others and the Lord delivered that woman
[2:10:17] that
[2:10:19] night and I appreciated what God did and
[2:10:23] she praised the Lord she
[2:10:26] rejoiced she had the most wonderful time
[2:10:28] she knew more about the message than
[2:10:30] most folks did too much it's dangerous
[2:10:33] to know too much without the holy
[2:10:35] spirit
[2:10:37] amen and so we just had a a wonderful
[2:10:41] meeting and as we went to leave that
[2:10:43] evening she was standing on the
[2:10:44] doorsteps at the church telling everyone
[2:10:46] goodbye and she had what they call in
[2:10:48] England a suite in her mouth it was a
[2:10:51] piece of hard
[2:10:54] candy and she was familiar with the
[2:10:57] statement that brother Bram made when
[2:10:59] that perfect love you know when that's
[2:11:01] demonstrated Among Us that it make you
[2:11:02] want to chew one another's chewing
[2:11:07] gum what he means is all that
[2:11:14] yuckiness don't laugh too hard I mean
[2:11:18] it's kind of funny but but it's kind of
[2:11:20] true to
[2:11:22] too because we got so many
[2:11:25] iys I I don't mean
[2:11:28] germs I mean these icky things you know
[2:11:30] that kind of make us uh uh you know
[2:11:33] repel Us in some way he said by that he
[2:11:36] didn't tell us to do
[2:11:38] it they told one time that I had
[2:11:41] preached that and that I had suggested
[2:11:45] that perhaps we make it a third
[2:11:46] ordinance of the
[2:11:48] church chewing one another's chewing gun
[2:11:52] I I never said anything like that you
[2:11:54] don't have to say it for someone to say
[2:11:56] you said it are you with
[2:11:58] me but I like the principle because I'd
[2:12:02] like to be to a place where I could love
[2:12:09] you in spite of all the ickiness that
[2:12:12] might be between
[2:12:17] us when my little granddaughter has a
[2:12:20] little snot on her no
[2:12:22] I don't run for a
[2:12:25] hanky I don't like Snot do you you're
[2:12:29] looking at me funny like you just deal
[2:12:30] with snot all the time I don't like it
[2:12:34] mucus does that sound better for you
[2:12:36] that are a little mucus that
[2:12:39] sounds
[2:12:41] horrible sometime the the scientific
[2:12:43] term is worse than the
[2:12:46] nickname many
[2:12:48] examples uh I don't go grab a
[2:12:51] handkerchief if I don't have time or a
[2:12:54] Kleenex I just use my finger many times
[2:12:57] I've just used my finger I did it for my
[2:13:00] own children you have too some of you
[2:13:04] then I go wipe it off wash it off but
[2:13:07] you don't think to that's so disgusting
[2:13:11] that I because you I love her amen the
[2:13:15] few times I changed her diaper I did it
[2:13:18] with joy
[2:13:22] even though I think I got one of the
[2:13:23] first colossal
[2:13:27] ones I did it with joy because I loved
[2:13:31] her and did you get it on your hands I
[2:13:35] did I can't believe you're telling that
[2:13:37] in the pull pit I
[2:13:39] am it's more interesting than some
[2:13:41] things I hear on streams I'll tell you
[2:13:43] that right now
[2:13:47] amen you just go wash it off of course
[2:13:50] you may say oh
[2:13:51] I don't you know I don't like that I'm
[2:13:53] not going to wear it all
[2:13:55] day but you love that one so much this
[2:13:58] is what he was saying uh when love when
[2:14:01] that perfect love strikes
[2:14:04] us we we could be in the trenches
[2:14:08] together working through one another's
[2:14:13] sweat one another's
[2:14:16] blood and we're so in this thing that we
[2:14:19] don't get dis gusted by that I get it
[2:14:23] don't you this little woman knew that
[2:14:26] quote very well and I don't know why I
[2:14:27] think I know it must have been a test I
[2:14:29] felt
[2:14:30] tested and I knew in that moment that I
[2:14:33] had to pass the
[2:14:35] test she said brother Shelly would you
[2:14:38] like to have my
[2:14:40] sweet and she took it out of her mouth
[2:14:52] it was like someone paused the movie of
[2:14:54] my
[2:14:56] life while I considered this she would
[2:14:59] say no I I I don't need a site I'm
[2:15:02] thinking no and if I needed one I would
[2:15:05] take one out of the wrapper for myself
[2:15:07] but something
[2:15:10] said you've got to do
[2:15:15] it so I
[2:15:19] just her eyes got about that big and she
[2:15:23] turned and mumbled off I didn't think
[2:15:25] you would do it I don't know why the
[2:15:29] test was
[2:15:31] necessary I don't even remember if I
[2:15:33] finished it
[2:15:36] all but in that moment I did something
[2:15:39] that I thought was pretty disgusting
[2:15:41] because I felt tested so if I feel
[2:15:43] tested I felt a little
[2:15:46] tested if you think that people get bent
[2:15:49] out of shape like that
[2:15:51] what if you were to tell them not only
[2:15:53] do you have things like that wrong
[2:15:55] you've got the godhead
[2:15:58] wrong and if the godhead is wrong in
[2:16:00] your theology nearly the whole thing is
[2:16:03] out of cater
[2:16:04] amen it matters the
[2:16:08] baptism it matters who you marry come on
[2:16:12] it matters if you're married to the name
[2:16:14] or married to the titles it
[2:16:17] matters and look folks these mcab said
[2:16:20] this matters to us we can go worship
[2:16:24] somewhere else but God said this is the
[2:16:27] hill where we are to worship Our God and
[2:16:31] this is the place that he has chosen to
[2:16:34] put his name and you have put Zeus and
[2:16:38] Jupiter in his place so today we risk
[2:16:42] our
[2:16:43] lives and they did and when it came time
[2:16:47] to turn the manora upright no didn't
[2:16:51] have nine
[2:16:52] branches and someone many times people
[2:16:55] have questioned well why in the world
[2:16:57] would you use a perverted manora because
[2:16:59] the god ordained manora has seven
[2:17:02] branches well first of all it's
[2:17:05] forbidden it's
[2:17:07] forbidden for you to make a copy or a
[2:17:13] duplicate of that manora of seven
[2:17:15] branches and we have them as Christian
[2:17:18] Believers we're not living under that
[2:17:20] kind of
[2:17:21] of a law but it's forbidden to do that
[2:17:24] it was to be made only by those who were
[2:17:26] chosen to make them for the Holy Temple
[2:17:29] and the the pattern was to never be
[2:17:32] copied the reason why the the Ancients
[2:17:37] decided to make one here with these nine
[2:17:39] was to
[2:17:41] commemorate these eight days because and
[2:17:44] someone said that's not recorded in the
[2:17:46] scripture in fact some people believe
[2:17:48] it's not even in history well just let
[2:17:50] me tell you that in the talmud it is
[2:17:53] recorded 600 years after it happened it
[2:17:56] may not have happened exactly like this
[2:17:58] there are many things that we
[2:18:00] recite and use that may not have
[2:18:03] happened exactly is there anybody in
[2:18:06] here that celebrates 4th of
[2:18:09] July have you ever found that in the
[2:18:11] Bible no sir did you ever read in the
[2:18:14] scripture where fireworks are
[2:18:19] pagan did you know that if you trace the
[2:18:22] roots of those fireworks you would find
[2:18:25] that they were also used like that by
[2:18:27] pagans then what's the difference in the
[2:18:30] Fourth of July we're celebrating America
[2:18:33] freedom and the country that we live in
[2:18:35] and some people have a problem with that
[2:18:37] then go live somewhere
[2:18:40] else and we're not making it a religious
[2:18:45] Festival so we're not mixing that in our
[2:18:49] worship we do it as families or
[2:18:52] Community as a as a church family we
[2:18:55] might have a picnic or something like
[2:18:57] that but we're not doing that for
[2:18:59] worship it's when we put
[2:19:02] worship we combine our worship with
[2:19:05] these Pagan elements that God says I
[2:19:08] don't want any part of that and if you
[2:19:10] don't believe it just go back to Tuesday
[2:19:12] night's sermon I showed you right in the
[2:19:13] word he said I don't want any I don't
[2:19:15] want anything to do with that very clear
[2:19:17] very very clear now so this uh monora
[2:19:21] was turned over they put it up it wasn't
[2:19:23] candles it was oil right and they only
[2:19:26] found we want to we want to finish off
[2:19:28] this rededication and reconsecration of
[2:19:31] the of the temple and we want to light
[2:19:33] the
[2:19:34] manora and they could only find one
[2:19:36] little pot of
[2:19:37] oil and it would take days some people
[2:19:40] believe approximately seven to eight
[2:19:43] days to to make more
[2:19:47] consecrated oil from the first press
[2:19:51] because as Jonathan could tell you
[2:19:53] living in the land at some point the the
[2:19:56] oil for the temple couldn't be the
[2:19:58] cooking oil all from the olive but they
[2:20:01] didn't use the cooking oil in the temple
[2:20:05] they didn't use the burning oil same
[2:20:08] Olive but a different press you press
[2:20:12] the olives once and that first press is
[2:20:15] the purest oil not much meat in it not
[2:20:19] much pop in it no chance of pit in it do
[2:20:23] you understand holy then prayed over
[2:20:25] consecrated dedicated and only that oil
[2:20:28] could be used to light the temple they
[2:20:30] would take those same olives and press
[2:20:32] them again are you here you listen press
[2:20:34] them again and use them for other things
[2:20:37] cooking and then eventually burning in
[2:20:39] little lamps you'll find one of those
[2:20:41] out in the in the cabinet there on the
[2:20:43] right as you go out you'll find an
[2:20:45] original lamp from the second temple
[2:20:47] period just this little clay little clay
[2:20:49] vessel that they would pour oil in and
[2:20:51] lay a wick in it and light it that's not
[2:20:53] the same oil that would burn so they had
[2:20:55] to have a particular kind of of
[2:20:57] consecrated oil and it would have taken
[2:21:00] days to get that through and find the
[2:21:02] priesthood and get all of this in order
[2:21:04] these men didn't didn't even think they
[2:21:06] they were just trying to remember all
[2:21:07] they could remember they weren't priests
[2:21:09] they were trying to remember everything
[2:21:10] they could remember about how it ought
[2:21:11] to be done they were so
[2:21:17] passionate maybe they weren't even
[2:21:19] supposed to be doing it
[2:21:21] but they did it with such a passion that
[2:21:24] it's
[2:21:25] recorded and
[2:21:27] became something to commemorate year
[2:21:30] after year after year interesting so
[2:21:33] they take this oil as the talmud records
[2:21:36] you can read it it's in certain track
[2:21:38] date I can give you the track date the
[2:21:39] paragraph and the
[2:21:41] verse and one little pot somebody said
[2:21:45] well I Google that and Google says it
[2:21:47] didn't even happen well folks it's just
[2:21:49] like this Google will tell you that
[2:21:51] brother Brandon was a false prophet if
[2:21:53] you choose to believe that you'll miss
[2:21:56] the
[2:22:01] truth if you do a lot of digging on
[2:22:03] Google you'll find out that we used to
[2:22:05] have a a place a a time here on the
[2:22:09] campground uh where we all were forced
[2:22:13] to wear uh sackcloth and Ashes and we
[2:22:16] passed them out and we threw them over
[2:22:18] people's faces and we and uh we called
[2:22:22] the road uh uh the whole Campground was
[2:22:24] called ezekiel's wheel and we did this
[2:22:27] and we did that and we did the other
[2:22:29] which is some false report that someone
[2:22:31] made up along the way made a podcast and
[2:22:34] posted it many many years ago and
[2:22:36] nothing could be any further from the
[2:22:39] reality the campground has always been
[2:22:42] called from the first day Eagle's refuge
[2:22:45] and I have only
[2:22:46] said in in reference when we made that
[2:22:50] loop I said why that reminds me of
[2:22:52] ezekiel's
[2:22:54] wheel but someone who passed through
[2:22:57] here remembers because they were a
[2:23:00] little child now they're grown and have
[2:23:01] denied and left the faith and now that's
[2:23:04] their memory that's their memory so they
[2:23:06] post
[2:23:07] it it's out there you can find anything
[2:23:10] you want to
[2:23:12] find you can't believe everything you
[2:23:14] hear there's a couple preachers calling
[2:23:17] themselves apolog apologists and they
[2:23:21] are working hard to prove that there's
[2:23:24] that Christmas has absolutely nothing to
[2:23:25] do with any Pagan history whatsoever and
[2:23:28] so people quote them as though they're
[2:23:30] they're experts and the people there are
[2:23:32] people there who tell you that Hislop
[2:23:33] who wrote Two Babylons was an
[2:23:35] outstanding man and there will be others
[2:23:37] who tell you he made up history as he
[2:23:39] went along you can read anything you
[2:23:42] want or you need the Holy
[2:23:46] Ghost you can't believe everything you
[2:23:49] read or hear
[2:23:50] you need the Holy
[2:23:53] Ghost you've got to have him I choose to
[2:23:57] believe because it's easier for me to
[2:23:59] believe the supernatural than to
[2:24:01] discount it that's where my faith lies I
[2:24:04] really believe that they lit the manora
[2:24:08] I've got a clo 120 oh no I've got a l
[2:24:11] time they lit that manura with one
[2:24:13] little pot of oil that wouldn't have
[2:24:14] even burned through a whole day
[2:24:16] probably and they believe they teach
[2:24:18] they said it's recorded in in the
[2:24:21] written history of the oral law that it
[2:24:24] burned miraculously for eight
[2:24:27] nights the one thing that they have
[2:24:29] maintained about that that particular
[2:24:33] style of the hukum the manora is we want
[2:24:37] you to put the ninth candle higher than
[2:24:39] the others because this represents the
[2:24:42] shamash the
[2:24:44] servant and if you read Isaiah
[2:24:47] 535 you'll find that he is prophetic
[2:24:50] Ally the suffering servant and it's one
[2:24:52] of the reasons why the Jews Brother
[2:24:54] David man missed them missed him in the
[2:24:56] beginning because they had this
[2:24:58] mentality from the rabbis that he was
[2:25:00] going to come as conquering King
[2:25:03] first but the scriptures are clear he
[2:25:06] comes first as a suffering servant
[2:25:08] wasn't he one didn't he suffer didn't he
[2:25:12] serve didn't he stoop down and wash the
[2:25:14] disciples feet and then he's coming both
[2:25:17] are
[2:25:19] right go tell somebody both are right he
[2:25:23] is the suffering servant and he is the
[2:25:26] king of kings the lion of the tribe of
[2:25:31] Judah he is the reigning Lord hallelujah
[2:25:35] bless his
[2:25:37] name they would have missed him and they
[2:25:40] did and their eyes were blinded and we
[2:25:42] know the story and we know God's promise
[2:25:44] and Covenant but they they record that
[2:25:47] miraculously it burns so we commemorate
[2:25:50] not just the rededication of the temple
[2:25:53] but we are commemorating what it
[2:25:55] represents to us in this world when the
[2:25:59] governments can come and
[2:26:01] say you can't
[2:26:06] gather you might have the The Big C or
[2:26:11] CV the big
[2:26:13] virus and you can't gather and
[2:26:18] worship and only 10 at a time can come
[2:26:21] and this was just a trial
[2:26:24] run the random talks about a real
[2:26:26] squeeze
[2:26:27] coming come on and all of us most all of
[2:26:31] us if we live very long we're going to
[2:26:33] be faced at some point in our life with
[2:26:36] the
[2:26:36] decision whether we can
[2:26:42] stand and some won't even worship with
[2:26:44] us
[2:26:45] now because we didn't bow to every
[2:26:49] mandate
[2:26:52] what will it be the next time there's
[2:26:55] got to be some people somewhere who say
[2:26:58] I'm going to give Caesar everything that
[2:27:00] is his until he keeps
[2:27:02] me from giving God what is
[2:27:05] God's and then I'm going to listen to
[2:27:08] God oh I Think Jesus knew exactly what
[2:27:11] he was doing being there in the
[2:27:12] scripture recording it I think he's
[2:27:14] actually talking to us about the last
[2:27:16] day there's so much there's so much here
[2:27:20] but I have to get to this before I
[2:27:22] close and Jesus walked in the temple in
[2:27:26] Solomon's porch then came the Jews round
[2:27:29] about him and said unto him how long
[2:27:32] Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be
[2:27:34] the Christ the Messiah the anointed one
[2:27:37] tell
[2:27:38] us do you ever just want to say go ahead
[2:27:41] and tell me you got anybody in your life
[2:27:44] that'll just talk to you in
[2:27:46] riddles and you just want to scream goe
[2:27:50] head and suck it to me tell me like it
[2:27:53] is let's don't Tiptoe Through the Tulips
[2:27:57] they said we want you to tell us plainly
[2:27:59] and Jesus answered them verse 25 I told
[2:28:02] you and you believe not the works that I
[2:28:05] do in my father's name they bear witness
[2:28:08] of me but ye believe not because you're
[2:28:11] not of my sheep as I said unto you my
[2:28:14] sheep hear my voice and I know them and
[2:28:16] they follow me that's right he insulted
[2:28:19] them properly
[2:28:20] and he said and I give unto them eternal
[2:28:22] life and they shall never perish neither
[2:28:25] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[2:28:28] did I just yell I did my Father which
[2:28:32] gave them me is greater than all and no
[2:28:34] man is able to pluck them out of my
[2:28:36] father's hand so you'll never be able to
[2:28:39] get them out of mine either he's telling
[2:28:41] us and then verse
[2:28:49] 30 read it for me would you again I and
[2:28:52] my father are I and my
[2:28:57] father are
[2:28:59] one and he moves on there's more we we
[2:29:03] could we could read it all there's
[2:29:05] more but he moves on because he's
[2:29:08] finally given them what they were after
[2:29:10] if you're him tell
[2:29:12] us and he said I and my father are
[2:29:16] one and what did the Catholic church do
[2:29:19] they read that
[2:29:21] and they
[2:29:22] said we've got to make three out of one
[2:29:26] Jesus said two make one in this verse so
[2:29:31] three must surely make
[2:29:35] one and the nyine Creed was born the
[2:29:39] Apostles Creed was born and the
[2:29:41] trinitarian doctrine was born and the
[2:29:43] false baptism was born come on yes and
[2:29:47] all he said was I and my father are
[2:29:50] not three not four not five not a dozen
[2:29:52] not half a dozen
[2:29:54] one this rededication of the temple
[2:29:57] symbolized restoring God's rightful
[2:29:59] worship Jesus claims aligns with this by
[2:30:03] presenting himself as the ultimate
[2:30:05] revelation of God he's telling them
[2:30:08] God's with you the father's with you his
[2:30:10] Unity with the father underscores the
[2:30:12] enduring presence of God which is
[2:30:15] celebrated in the Feast of dedication
[2:30:18] Colossians 1:15 17 let me read this
[2:30:21] quickly I'll take another 10 15 minutes
[2:30:23] and we'll go who is the image who is the
[2:30:26] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[2:30:29] of every creature for by him were all
[2:30:31] things created that are in heaven that
[2:30:33] are in Earth visible and invisible
[2:30:35] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[2:30:37] principalities or Powers all things were
[2:30:39] created by Him and what and he is before
[2:30:42] all
[2:30:45] things and by him
[2:30:50] well I thought that was the father that
[2:30:51] said let there be
[2:30:54] light all things all things he is before
[2:30:59] all things and by him
[2:31:02] Jesus
[2:31:04] Messiah all things consist Hebrews 1 1-3
[2:31:09] God who at suy times and in diverse
[2:31:12] manner spake in time pass under the
[2:31:14] fathers by the
[2:31:15] prophets uh hath in these last days
[2:31:18] spoken to us by his son whom he hath
[2:31:20] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[2:31:23] also he made the worlds through the son
[2:31:27] he made the worlds who being the
[2:31:30] brightness of his glory and
[2:31:33] the the express image of his person and
[2:31:37] upholding All Things by the word of his
[2:31:40] power when he had by himself purged our
[2:31:47] sins by himself
[2:31:50] purged our sins what did he
[2:31:53] do he sat down on the right hand of the
[2:31:56] Majesty on high he didn't sit down by
[2:31:59] another
[2:32:01] person he sat
[2:32:04] down on the right hand of the Majesty on
[2:32:08] high there's so much here we can't get
[2:32:11] it all but in John 14 he goes back to to
[2:32:15] refer to take this a little bit further
[2:32:18] in verse 10 and 11 and he said believest
[2:32:20] thou not that I am in the father and the
[2:32:22] father in me the words that I speak unto
[2:32:25] you I speak not of myself but the father
[2:32:27] that dwelleth in me he doeth The
[2:32:30] Works believe me that I am in the father
[2:32:33] and the father in me or else believe me
[2:32:35] for the very Works sake now again we're
[2:32:39] preaching to the choir because this is
[2:32:41] the Revelation that most of you have
[2:32:43] received please understand that the
[2:32:47] average Joe Christian
[2:32:50] doesn't see what you
[2:32:54] see and that's why they sing the
[2:32:58] doxology praise God from whom all
[2:33:01] blessings flow Praise Him All Creatures
[2:33:03] here below Praise Him above ye Heavenly
[2:33:04] Host praise father son
[2:33:09] and and you can do that very
[2:33:12] quickly by praising
[2:33:15] Jesus because he said I'm in the father
[2:33:17] and the father's in me folks that's a
[2:33:19] reation and that's a big enough
[2:33:21] Revelation that you ought to be able to
[2:33:23] whip a bunch of devils with that one
[2:33:26] alone and when did Jesus choose to
[2:33:30] identify
[2:33:32] himself now I want to say this again
[2:33:34] I've told you this many times as we come
[2:33:38] to an end here for a
[2:33:40] moment in the Time of Our Lord the
[2:33:42] second temple period the rabbis were not
[2:33:46] teaching the people that Messiah would
[2:33:50] be
[2:33:52] God they were teaching them that he
[2:33:55] would represent God as a mighty
[2:34:01] General that's why some even
[2:34:06] initially thought that Titus the general
[2:34:10] who came to destroy the city might
[2:34:12] possibly be the
[2:34:14] Messiah because he came with a Greek I
[2:34:17] mean a a gentile
[2:34:20] because they were looking for one who
[2:34:21] would boast of his strength his military
[2:34:23] might and power they weren't looking for
[2:34:26] one who would so humble himself that he
[2:34:28] would come as a little
[2:34:30] baby I don't know if you're catching
[2:34:32] these things in this season or not but
[2:34:35] the church at
[2:34:37] large and citizens at large would rather
[2:34:42] keep him for ever a
[2:34:46] baby it's a principle that brother
[2:34:48] brandom outlined for a very clearly he
[2:34:50] said they've got him back in the
[2:34:53] manger that statement alone ruffled many
[2:34:57] feathers as that went out of this place
[2:34:59] last
[2:35:01] week they've got him back in the manger
[2:35:04] they they see him as a little baby
[2:35:05] somebody said what what are you denying
[2:35:08] the Incarnation of of God in in oh no no
[2:35:12] one teaches God in flesh any stronger
[2:35:14] than we do by this revelation of the
[2:35:17] message but what we really really Pine
[2:35:21] over and weep over is the fact that
[2:35:24] people are more comfortable with a
[2:35:26] little baby innocent who needs his
[2:35:28] diaper
[2:35:30] changed than a than a Jesus who can
[2:35:34] judge the
[2:35:35] nations with a rod of iron the scripture
[2:35:38] said he's commanding every man
[2:35:41] everywhere to repent now he's not crying
[2:35:44] there with a little sniffle like a baby
[2:35:46] he he's he's he's about to Roar
[2:35:51] from the Holy Hill the lion of the tribe
[2:35:54] of Judah does anybody see this and when
[2:35:58] Jesus
[2:35:59] Jesus again a few more moments here when
[2:36:03] Jesus was ready to reveal who he really
[2:36:06] was and answered this probing question
[2:36:09] he did it teaching from
[2:36:13] Solomon's colonate porch
[2:36:17] Portico in the temple at the Feast of
[2:36:21] dedication there's a
[2:36:24] reason who being in the brightness of
[2:36:26] his glory and the express image of his
[2:36:28] person brother brandom tells us in the
[2:36:30] message why it had to be
[2:36:32] shepherd shepherd is
[2:36:35] plural he had started a new creation
[2:36:39] what was
[2:36:40] it a creation of
[2:36:43] himself God was made flesh and dwelt
[2:36:46] Among Us that's the Bible said in the
[2:36:49] beginning of the creation of God
[2:36:53] powerful God was created in human form
[2:36:57] in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt does
[2:37:00] anybody believe that here wave your hand
[2:37:02] if you see that he built his Tabernacle
[2:37:06] of Flesh and Bones and lived in that
[2:37:09] Tabernacle God
[2:37:12] Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a
[2:37:16] house to live in it so he could
[2:37:20] reflect his word to his subjects through
[2:37:24] that wow you know what God is to me this
[2:37:28] is one of the most profound
[2:37:32] statements brother bandham actually
[2:37:34] calls it one of the greatest Mysteries
[2:37:37] revealed that Jehovah of the Old
[2:37:40] Testament is Jesus of the new we take it
[2:37:43] for granted every one of us in this room
[2:37:45] who believe that we take that for
[2:37:46] granted because we hear it 11 dozen
[2:37:48] different ways
[2:37:50] every month right we hear it when we
[2:37:52] listen to brother we hear it when we
[2:37:54] listen to our pastor we hear when we
[2:37:55] listen to Brother G we hear it and hear
[2:37:56] it and hear it and we take it for
[2:37:58] granted but I don't ever want to
[2:38:01] lose the value of such a revelation
[2:38:05] because it places the scripture properly
[2:38:07] it's in its right place we know who he
[2:38:09] is you can't worship Him in
[2:38:13] spirit and in
[2:38:15] truth if you don't know who he is so
[2:38:19] brother makes this statement at the end
[2:38:20] of this quote it's so so simple so
[2:38:23] profound yet so powerful that the
[2:38:26] leading theologians of our day miss it
[2:38:29] he said you know what God
[2:38:31] is when you see
[2:38:36] Christ we wouldn't have known that had
[2:38:39] Jesus not answered the
[2:38:41] question by saying
[2:38:44] I and my
[2:38:46] father are one
[2:38:50] in the message the unveiling of
[2:38:54] God let me give you one
[2:38:57] more maybe two more and
[2:39:00] close the word manifested or revealed in
[2:39:03] that Revelation in there then what does
[2:39:07] that put
[2:39:09] me oh this is
[2:39:11] good I nearly nearly shouted when I read
[2:39:16] this if he is that at
[2:39:21] shakina or Shak
[2:39:25] glory and he is isn't he the cavod the
[2:39:28] heavy presence of God if he is that if
[2:39:31] Jesus is the personification of the
[2:39:33] pillar of fire if he is the fleshed out
[2:39:36] body that the pillar of fire dwells in
[2:39:39] that's what he said by the way then he
[2:39:42] is that because he referred to that
[2:39:44] Pillar of Fire as a manifestation of the
[2:39:48] shakina that unveiling of God 64 they do
[2:39:51] you real good to listen to that one
[2:39:52] again it's powerful it's a good one many
[2:39:56] of them all of them are good all of them
[2:39:57] are good many of them do well with this
[2:40:00] subject but this is one of one of the
[2:40:02] one of the best of the best if that
[2:40:05] Pillar of Fire was another dimension or
[2:40:08] another manifestation of the shika Glory
[2:40:11] that dwelt in the holy of holies in the
[2:40:14] Tabernacle and then the temple and now
[2:40:16] brother brandham said where does that
[2:40:18] put me if he is that shik Glory if he's
[2:40:21] that glory in a body of Flesh he said
[2:40:24] I'm part of
[2:40:28] it
[2:40:29] woo where are we looking for the shika
[2:40:32] Glory well I'll tell you where showing
[2:40:34] up it's going to show up in the
[2:40:39] bride it's showing up in the
[2:40:43] body it is he said I'm part of it amen
[2:40:47] oh amen that's right the word it self
[2:40:50] revealed it reveals itself think he said
[2:40:54] the mysteries of God made known to us in
[2:40:56] this day by the same Heavenly messenger
[2:40:59] that was made known to them in them days
[2:41:02] notice and he's calling the pillar of
[2:41:04] fire the Heavenly messenger the same
[2:41:07] Pillar of Fire that sent Moses the same
[2:41:09] Pillar of Fire that was on Moses that
[2:41:11] wrote the Bible the same Pillar of Fire
[2:41:14] that Paul met on his road down to
[2:41:17] Damascus and now we hear in our day that
[2:41:20] we are a part of that
[2:41:23] fire we are a part of that
[2:41:26] she that
[2:41:29] shikina well I'll have to skip a lot or
[2:41:32] I will lose you all but I'll do one more
[2:41:36] calling Jesus on the
[2:41:39] scene I I I could go
[2:41:43] on 3 hours and never hit these
[2:41:48] notes no no I won't I could feel
[2:41:51] you 10 I should I just should to see who
[2:41:54] I ought to just sometimes see who the
[2:41:56] last man standing would
[2:41:58] be just preach till the last one's
[2:42:02] here you may think I'm
[2:42:05] being prideful
[2:42:08] but I want you to know they might take a
[2:42:10] nap every now and again but I know
[2:42:12] there's some that would never never
[2:42:14] leave they'd sit right here to the last
[2:42:17] again they might doze in and out
[2:42:20] out as they sometimes
[2:42:24] can remember in flesh oh people have
[2:42:29] such a struggle with this in flesh he
[2:42:32] was just a
[2:42:34] man but in
[2:42:38] spirit he was
[2:42:40] God but a man in flesh therefore his
[2:42:45] body was a human
[2:42:47] being that was subject to
[2:42:50] Temptations think about it subject to
[2:42:52] sickness just read it just the same as
[2:42:56] ours as he had to put on be a man a
[2:43:00] human brother brandom tells us in many
[2:43:03] sermons it's enor it's it's the changing
[2:43:05] of a mask same God same actor but he's
[2:43:09] changing scenes and as he changes scenes
[2:43:12] he changes his
[2:43:14] mask and then he was God in the spirit
[2:43:19] watch this one he said I am my father
[2:43:22] are one my father dwelleth in me we
[2:43:25] mentioned this on on in one of the last
[2:43:28] two
[2:43:29] Services when John baptized him on the
[2:43:32] River Jordan we see God descending from
[2:43:34] heaven like a dove and the voice saying
[2:43:38] this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[2:43:41] pleased to dwell he God dwelt in Christ
[2:43:47] and in him was the fullness of the
[2:43:50] godhead John 1
[2:43:52] bodily God expressing himself through
[2:43:55] Jesus and Jesus was the Vindication of
[2:44:00] God God the Father
[2:44:02] listen God the Father this is so good
[2:44:07] God the father in the
[2:44:10] form of the Holy Spirit was in a pillar
[2:44:16] of
[2:44:17] fire so what was the pillar of fire God
[2:44:20] the father in the form of Holy
[2:44:24] Spirit and that no one could touch
[2:44:27] around him he was holy no sin offering
[2:44:30] was made just a potential offering now
[2:44:33] that same Pillar of Fire the
[2:44:38] fatherhood came
[2:44:40] down and was made God
[2:44:43] oh in
[2:44:46] sunship why do I even need to know this
[2:44:51] because you are called to be an Express
[2:44:55] image of what he
[2:44:59] was came down was made God in sunship he
[2:45:03] dwelt in a pillar of fire here in the
[2:45:05] shakina glory here he dwelt in a body
[2:45:08] which was his son that he created and
[2:45:10] made in the form of man so that made him
[2:45:13] the Son of God second Adam the scripture
[2:45:16] identifies him as the last Adam now now
[2:45:19] he had to come through the womb of a
[2:45:20] woman not like
[2:45:23] Adam a woman had to be involved in this
[2:45:25] birthing process it was ordained it was
[2:45:29] God's Will and way Adam didn't come from
[2:45:32] the womb of a woman but Jesus our
[2:45:35] Messiah had to come from the womb of a
[2:45:37] woman because that's what he had to
[2:45:40] condemn the birth of a human being by a
[2:45:42] woman that's what had to be judged he
[2:45:44] said see so he had to come that way now
[2:45:46] that's God the son the same God
[2:45:49] and now he through the offering that
[2:45:51] body without sin he
[2:45:54] made a human
[2:45:57] offering I tell
[2:45:59] you that is so
[2:46:02] rich we will
[2:46:04] stop once I read two
[2:46:07] verses Isaiah 9 6 and 7 this is where
[2:46:12] we'll pick up Tuesday night for unto
[2:46:15] us aren't you excited that he came as a

[2:47:51] Peace of the increase of his government
[2:47:53] in peace there shall be no end this is
[2:47:56] prophetic upon the throne of David and
[2:47:58] upon his kingdom to order it and to
[2:48:00] establish it with judgment and with
[2:48:01] Justice from henceforth even forever the
[2:48:04] Zeal of the
[2:48:06] Lord man won't have to make this happen
[2:48:09] The Passion of The Lord of hosts will
[2:48:11] perform this how many of you know he did
[2:48:16] it was fulfilled he fulfilled fed the
[2:48:19] prophecies aren't you glad so it's all
[2:48:23] right if you pause every now and then to
[2:48:28] remember that God
[2:48:31] Almighty crawled into the
[2:48:34] womb of a virgin Maiden whose name was
[2:48:39] Miriam we call her in English
[2:48:43] Mary that little baby didn't have two
[2:48:46] fathers and the Bible clearly tells
[2:48:48] tells us that she
[2:48:51] conceived when she was
[2:48:55] overshadowed by the Holy
[2:48:57] Ghost so we know that his
[2:49:01] conception was by the Holy Ghost which
[2:49:04] helps us to understand the Father the
[2:49:08] Holy Ghost and the son Are The Same
[2:49:11] Spirit different
[2:49:14] offices he was God 100 100% the prophet
[2:49:20] told
[2:49:21] us there are some church advancements
[2:49:24] out there and some will call him God and
[2:49:28] some will go as far as to say he was 50%
[2:49:30] God and 50%
[2:49:33] man if that were the case he would only
[2:49:35] be half good to
[2:49:38] us because we needed both parts yes we
[2:49:42] needed a
[2:49:43] man who could be
[2:49:46] touched with the feeling of our
[2:49:48] infirmities who could be tempted in all
[2:49:51] manner as we are yet without sin and we
[2:49:54] needed a God who could create perfect
[2:49:58] blood not provided by Mary nor Joseph
[2:50:02] but provided by the eternal spirit of
[2:50:04] God oh how precious that blood is come
[2:50:08] on so if you pause every now and again
[2:50:10] to remember that beautiful Incarnation
[2:50:12] how how God became man 100% of each
[2:50:16] living in one little body it's a
[2:50:19] powerful and beautiful thing to remember
[2:50:22] but it can't stand
[2:50:25] alone and if you can only recognize him
[2:50:28] as a baby in a manger and not recognize
[2:50:31] him as the Fulfillment of the suffering
[2:50:34] servant who was crucified who suffered
[2:50:40] who shed his
[2:50:42] blood and when you who know to do
[2:50:45] good and you do it not the scripture
[2:50:49] said you're operating in sin or unbelief
[2:50:53] and once you have come hear me now if
[2:50:55] you didn't hear anything else hear this
[2:50:58] once you have come to the knowledge of
[2:50:59] the truth to continue or to go back to
[2:51:03] your unbelief the scripture said you
[2:51:08] trample list the
[2:51:11] blood does anybody know how
[2:51:14] holy that blood is
[2:51:20] there there is everything in it
[2:51:22] everything is in it and yet if you were
[2:51:25] to go to Jerusalem and go underneath the
[2:51:28] Temple Mount and
[2:51:32] scrape a a a
[2:51:35] remnant of that
[2:51:38] blood that dry
[2:51:41] chemistry could do nothing for
[2:51:44] you it's the
[2:51:46] life the blood cell had to Die the blood
[2:51:50] cell had to break
[2:51:52] open so that the life that was in the
[2:51:55] blood cell could fall on your head now
[2:51:57] tell me that's not precious it's the
[2:51:59] most valuable commodity in the entire
[2:52:02] history of all mankind and and and
[2:52:07] Beyond it's the most valuable thing and
[2:52:10] then for you to know to do
[2:52:14] good and do it
[2:52:16] not once you've come to the knowledge of
[2:52:18] the truth you're stepping on that
[2:52:20] precious blood that valuable and costly
[2:52:25] blood and you trample it and continue on
[2:52:29] choosing your own
[2:52:32] way there comes an end there comes a
[2:52:36] time when as part of him you can go no
[2:52:40] farther and I need to tell you that
[2:52:42] we're reaching that that period very
[2:52:45] very quickly I believe all that the
[2:52:48] father has given him will come I don't
[2:52:52] care how many times you've had a false
[2:52:54] start how many times you've backslid how
[2:52:56] many times you've changed your mind how
[2:52:58] many times you've Fallen back into your
[2:53:00] habits and
[2:53:02] vices there will come a time if you're a
[2:53:05] part of him that you'll turn your back
[2:53:08] on that go that junk for the last time
[2:53:13] and you'll only be able to do that you
[2:53:15] will only be able to do that by a re re
[2:53:19] ation of who he
[2:53:21] is so if we studied 11 dozen different
[2:53:24] ways that's all right because it's by
[2:53:27] that Revelation the brother Ram the
[2:53:29] greatest Revel Jehovah of the old Jesus
[2:53:31] of the new the value of that blood the
[2:53:34] price of redemption paid for you and I
[2:53:36] and for us to to decide that we're going
[2:53:39] to we're going to fall into a lifestyle
[2:53:41] of cheating and lying and uh drinking
[2:53:45] and sneaking around and lying to our
[2:53:48] parents and whatever else young people
[2:53:50] do these days
[2:53:53] and go back to the vice of the internet
[2:53:58] and get get swallowed
[2:54:01] up by all the
[2:54:03] offerings and and and the and the the
[2:54:06] Glitters the shiny
[2:54:09] shinies to do that when you've known the
[2:54:12] truth is dangerous it's a dangerous game
[2:54:16] to play and the only hope that you have
[2:54:19] is knowing that if you were ever in
[2:54:25] him he can't be
[2:54:27] complete without
[2:54:29] you so he's going to as Benjamin sings
[2:54:33] leads us sometime he's going to tear
[2:54:35] down what he's going to kick down
[2:54:38] every he's coming after you what's it
[2:54:42] say sh every shadow he will light
[2:54:46] up every Mountain he will climb up
[2:54:50] coming after
[2:54:53] you there's
[2:54:57] not a chain that he won't
[2:55:01] break there's not an ocean he wouldn't
[2:55:04] swim though you'd make your bed in hell
[2:55:07] itself though you took the wings of a
[2:55:09] dove the morning and and tried to fly
[2:55:12] away he'd find you amen because he can't
[2:55:15] be complete without you now why don't
[2:55:17] you settle it today amen why don't you
[2:55:19] end this Rat Race today you streaming
[2:55:22] this service uh along with you sitting
[2:55:24] here today why don't you end this Rat
[2:55:26] Race why don't you make up your mind
[2:55:29] today he's not going to have to chase me
[2:55:31] anywhere cuz I'm about to turn and run
[2:55:33] toward him I've spent long time running
[2:55:37] away from him but today I'm making up my
[2:55:40] mind that if he loved me that much to go
[2:55:43] to that great
[2:55:45] extent suffer the way he did
[2:55:49] for me the least that I can do is an
[2:55:52] about face and instead of running from
[2:55:55] him run to him how many of you believe
[2:55:57] there are great benefits let's stand by
[2:55:59] running to him instead of away from
[2:56:04] him so whether you choose in your
[2:56:08] devotional life or in your home or
[2:56:11] family to celebrate the Feast of
[2:56:13] dedication in Hanukkah is 100% as it
[2:56:16] always has been totally
[2:56:18] up to
[2:56:19] you but it is not up to
[2:56:23] you what to do with this
[2:56:28] truth it's not a
[2:56:32] a cafeteria style
[2:56:35] Arrangement you can't pick and
[2:56:38] choose this Revelation is
[2:56:41] transformative and once it strikes your
[2:56:44] heart you can never be
[2:56:46] satisfied in the conf confinements of
[2:56:49] denominational system
[2:56:51] again and I have to be honest with you
[2:56:54] everything loses its
[2:56:56] shine but
[2:56:59] him the
[2:57:03] whiskey the
[2:57:07] nicotine the immodest dress the lewd
[2:57:15] living once you come to that place
[2:57:21] frivolous sexuality without
[2:57:25] commitment even that loses its
[2:57:28] Shimmer come on once you've really
[2:57:31] feasted on the revelation of who he is
[2:57:35] we're humans and we have these
[2:57:37] Temptations and we have these things
[2:57:39] that come against us but the scripture
[2:57:41] said with every
[2:57:44] Temptation he will make a way of Escape
[2:57:46] doesn't he do it he will if you let him
[2:57:49] if you have to reduce yourself to this
[2:57:51] simple simple little exercise that
[2:57:53] brother brandham talked about in his day
[2:57:56] can you imagine in his day he was
[2:57:58] talking about the the loudness and
[2:58:00] immodesty of women in the 50s and 60s he
[2:58:03] was standing on his head over Lucille
[2:58:12] Ball he was she was wearing hot pants
[2:58:15] and and he absolutely couldn't take it
[2:58:18] and a cigarette in her mouth he
[2:58:20] absolutely could not take it what would
[2:58:23] he
[2:58:24] think about the hour we're living in now
[2:58:27] come
[2:58:28] on and he said when I am going down the
[2:58:31] road a child of God a servant of God a
[2:58:33] prophet of God and and I see these kind
[2:58:37] of things these women dress the way they
[2:58:39] dress he said I I've got this little
[2:58:42] cross hanging here on my rearview
[2:58:45] mirror and he said I make sure that
[2:58:48] instead of gazing another time or taking
[2:58:50] extra I turn my eyes to the
[2:58:55] cross it seems to me like a man filled
[2:58:58] with the Holy Ghost in This Hour with
[2:59:01] the revelation of the word we have
[2:59:02] should be able to do that without
[2:59:04] without a little cross hanging there but
[2:59:06] if you if you find that that becomes a
[2:59:09] help to you get you
[2:59:11] one and if that one that big don't get
[2:59:14] the job done get you a big one
[2:59:18] let everybody think what a fanatic you
[2:59:20] are but make up your mind I'm not taking
[2:59:23] a second
[2:59:24] look I'm going to see the beauty of
[2:59:27] Calvary I'm going to see the
[2:59:30] beauty in
[2:59:33] Christ in Christ
[2:59:35] alone his
[2:59:39] Beauty his
[2:59:42] value nothing is more valuable than a
[2:59:46] real relationship with him
[2:59:49] God help us
[2:59:50] today we stand in your
[2:59:54] house as we do week after
[2:59:58] week oh Jesus I I
[3:00:02] repent for the times that I would let
[3:00:05] this truth become
[3:00:08] common I I
[3:00:11] uh I want to be moved by it I want to be
[3:00:18] led by it I want to be corrected by it I
[3:00:21] want to be transformed by
[3:00:24] it I don't want to have only once a week
[3:00:27] or twice a week an encounter with it I I
[3:00:30] want to eat it and sleep it and breathe
[3:00:33] it and drink
[3:00:35] it lay down with it and get up with it
[3:00:39] stand with it and sit with it I
[3:00:42] want to digest
[3:00:45] it until all of who I I
[3:00:52] am
[3:00:55] bows I want you sitting on the
[3:00:58] throne of my
[3:01:01] life as we prepare to enter into another
[3:01:04] year on the Gregorian calendar I I
[3:01:08] desire today Lord in your presence to
[3:01:10] tear down every Jupiter every Zeus yes I
[3:01:15] desire to take a toothbrush if that's
[3:01:17] what it takes and scrub the altar of my
[3:01:21] heart until there's nothing defiling and
[3:01:24] nothing like this world and no gray no
[3:01:30] compromise on my hands and knees if
[3:01:32] that's what it
[3:01:33] takes and I not alone in this house
[3:01:38] Lord your bride is here today and across
[3:01:41] the world tuning in and we we say to you
[3:01:45] oh God we want every Idol torn down
[3:01:48] yes and we want to cleanse and
[3:01:52] rededicate because now it's not a house

[3:01:59] many membered House of
[3:02:05] Flesh we want you to shine in us and
[3:02:08] through
[3:02:10] US Lord as we enter now into a moment of
[3:02:13] worship let it be that we ascend

[3:02:22] Benjamin chooses to sing may we may we
[3:02:25] force ourselves to make them
[3:02:28] uncommon may we make up our mind today
