TRANSCRIPT
========================================
even when you can't see me even when you can't feel me even when it's only every now and again that you feel the tug on the other end of the line but you'll know he's there because his word said so I may not be able to walk on water but I can walk on a word as long as it comes from him if he said come then he's going to take care of me if I sink he's going to catch me if I drown he's going to revive me I'm not going to worry about it turns out I'm just going to know that in the end he's I am Hallelujah he's still able and I'm going to step out I I I I've got a word I've got a word I've got a word nobody has a word like this little bride that we can stand on not just when things are good but when they're hellish when hounds of hell are against you when your family's falling apart when your children are backslid and running after the world when your body is failing you that's the hour to step out on the word so if we're feeling disconnected and sometimes we do this is not to to condemn you or to judge you or even to blame you but who else are we going to blame if we can't blame him because he said I'll always be with you I'll go with you even to the end of the world we know he he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us then if we're disconnected who hung up who ghosted who who forgot to stay connected to the vine he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you and and that means there there that if is there it's that small little word that says you've got to do this there is a prerequisite there is a requirement in this hour and even though the book is opened and even though the revelation we have from God is Rich there's still the possibility that in the midst of all of this revelation we hang up or we somehow disconnect ourselves from fellowship with him listen church God is not just about relationship he's also about fellowship and if you don't believe that just remember he came down in the cool of the evening he was already Papa he was already God to Adam and to Eve but now he wanted to be in fellowship with them it's a reason why the God above us became a god with us and eventually a God in us because he was looking for fellowship and so when we replace him with all of the other pretties in life and with all of the other distractions in life then it's really us who pushes him to the back of the closet it's it's really us who says I don't have time to read today I don't have time to pray today well I want you to know if you don't read every day if you don't pray every day if you don't hear even a small portion of the word every day it won't take a week to be disconnected I want you to know that it's just as easy to reconnect he's as close as a mention of his name he's as close as the opening of his word you just have to focus on him you have to turn your attention away from all the other things in life that grab us in this hour and you have to set aside time for him your time with him is more important than the time with your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your husband or your wife or your siblings come on it's more important than your Christmas meal fellowship with him abiding in him and him abiding in you
