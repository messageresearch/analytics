[58:07] [Music]
[58:11] there
[58:14] oh I'm so glad I know that my name is
[58:20] there you can be seated just a moment
[58:23] we're we're not just talking about
[58:26] uh the sinner's
[58:28] prayer there's nothing wrong with that
[58:31] that's how we all start but we're not
[58:33] singing about the sinner's prayer
[58:36] tonight uh that's all it takes the Bible
[58:39] said whosoever calleth upon the name of
[58:41] the Lord shall be saved that's what the
[58:44] word said we're not talking about that
[58:48] when we sing I'm redeemed we're talking
[58:50] about being carried all the way back to
[58:54] the original thoughts of God concerning
[58:58] our lives that's more that's more you
[59:02] have to be his in the first place to be
[59:06] redeemed I'm glad I know that my name
[59:09] was written down not in the altar the
[59:12] night I prayed but before the
[59:14] foundations of the world were ever
[59:17] laid my name was there somebody said
[59:21] well then you didn't have a choice or I
[59:24] had a choice and I made my choice but he
[59:28] chose
[59:32] first that's just what the scripture
[59:34] said he saw my choice and by his for
[59:39] knowledge he predestined he
[59:41] predetermined that I would belong to him
[59:44] therefore I don't just find Salvation by
[59:47] the sinner's prayer by Redemption I'm
[59:50] carried all the way back whatever God
[59:53] saw that I was going to finish on this
[59:55] Earth I will will
[59:56] finish whatever God saw you doing at the
[59:59] end of your you're going to make it all
[1:00:01] the way you're going all the way to the
[1:00:04] end of your race some of us may meet it
[1:00:07] earlier than others you're not going out
[1:00:10] of here one second before the Lord has
[1:00:13] determined you to go I will not preach
[1:00:17] about a God who has created an enemy
[1:00:20] more powerful than
[1:00:22] himself I didn't give my life for that
[1:00:26] I have given my life to declare a
[1:00:29] sovereign God who never makes a mistake
[1:00:33] now the devil would like to maim us he
[1:00:35] would like to distract us he would like
[1:00:38] to us he would like to burden us
[1:00:41] but I want you to know there's there is
[1:00:43] a people on the Earth that he cannot
[1:00:47] kill so when you hear I'm gone don't you
[1:00:50] go telling somebody the devil cut his
[1:00:53] life short especially when I'm not that
[1:00:56] wouldn't make sense would it but don't
[1:00:59] you be telling that you say he finished
[1:01:02] the
[1:01:03] course and the Lord took him I hear
[1:01:07] message you know quote unquote let me do
[1:01:09] the air what do they call that air
[1:01:11] quotation mark let me do air
[1:01:14] quotes whatever that means that was a
[1:01:17] little stiff
[1:01:21] anyway uh you know I I hear them talk
[1:01:24] about if it would have if if he would
[1:01:26] have just had a better
[1:01:28] doctor if it just wouldn't have been in
[1:01:30] that hospital if they just hadn't to
[1:01:33] misdiagnosed him in the first place oh
[1:01:36] that's not the that's not what I'm on
[1:01:38] that's not the journey I'm running after
[1:01:41] I know that we our our minds try to find
[1:01:44] a way to justify what we're walking
[1:01:45] through but we can't leave the
[1:01:48] word we've got to stay on that word how
[1:01:52] many of you were blessed last night
[1:01:54] didn't we hear from the
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:02] Lord Brother I don't know what people
[1:02:04] were expecting brother Joe but but maybe
[1:02:08] not
[1:02:09] much you know why I'm saying that
[1:02:13] because so many people said I was so
[1:02:16] surprised I I don't know why anybody was
[1:02:20] surprised but we were so
[1:02:23] blessed and I don't think that's because
[1:02:26] they had low expectation I think they
[1:02:27] were thinking about it being the first
[1:02:30] night you know so you got to wait you
[1:02:32] you mean you got to do trial runs for
[1:02:34] two or three nights before you get in
[1:02:36] there and
[1:02:38] here oh lord of Mercy you know uh we
[1:02:43] used to have two
[1:02:44] weeks anybody
[1:02:47] remember we used to have two weeks of
[1:02:49] camp
[1:02:50] meeting Sunday to Sunday to
[1:02:53] Sunday why this new generation this
[1:02:56] Young Generation you wouldn't
[1:02:59] last by the middle of the second week
[1:03:02] we'd be hauling you in in a
[1:03:04] wheelbarrow we would in the heat in the
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:11] sawdust I was carried out a time or two
[1:03:14] myself but oh what fun it was I'm so
[1:03:18] glad it's more concentrated now and we
[1:03:21] can start off the first night like we
[1:03:24] did last night my God is good give him a
[1:03:29] [Applause]
[1:03:31] praise
[1:03:38] Hallelujah nobody turned in a song and
[1:03:42] that's usually because everybody waits
[1:03:44] until the meeting's almost over and then
[1:03:47] it sometimes people want to choose the
[1:03:49] night you sing don't wait if you've got
[1:03:53] a song The Lord's laid on your heart
[1:03:55] don't come tell us when you're going to
[1:03:56] sing it tell us you've got a song on
[1:03:59] your heart and let's trust that the Lord
[1:04:02] will get it in the right slot but if you
[1:04:04] all wait till the to Saturday or
[1:04:07] Sunday we might not have time but I'm
[1:04:10] glad you didn't turn in one
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:15] tonight I was
[1:04:17] standing on a
[1:04:22] mountain I was looking toward toward the
[1:04:28] sky when I saw a
[1:04:32] storm
[1:04:35] approaching and I feared that I would
[1:04:42] die I saw God's
[1:04:46] creatures run and
[1:04:49] seek a better
[1:04:52] place to hide
[1:04:56] I heard the Thunder
[1:04:59] roll down in my
[1:05:02] soul then I
[1:05:05] bowed my
[1:05:08] head and
[1:05:15] cried now the clouds were
[1:05:19] moving
[1:05:22] faster and there was lightning for
[1:05:26] flashing
[1:05:28] bright oh and the clouds were so dark
[1:05:33] they hid the light of the sun and it
[1:05:37] seemed that it was
[1:05:42] night oh but all at once there was a
[1:05:48] feeling like I'd never had before
[1:05:56] and up above that storm you should have
[1:06:01] heard me sing God had given
[1:06:06] me
[1:06:07] he

[1:06:33] Old Valley no sir you were born to soar

[1:06:41] sky don't let your
[1:06:43] trials bring you
[1:06:47] down or drive your spirit low to the
[1:06:53] ground just mount up with

[1:19:39] home this week it has been such a
[1:19:42] blessing you know when you go and you
[1:19:46] you stay in in
[1:19:48] hotels I I understand more and more why
[1:19:51] brother brandom many times would have to
[1:19:54] go and change hotels they would say I
[1:19:57] can't stay here cuz there's spirits that
[1:20:00] that are staying in those places but
[1:20:02] whenever you can enter into a
[1:20:04] home you can enter into a home and you
[1:20:06] feel the presence of
[1:20:08] God that's right you you know you don't
[1:20:11] have to have your guard
[1:20:13] up it's just like whenever I listen to
[1:20:15] the message I don't have to put my guard
[1:20:17] up you go in your vehicle and you turn a
[1:20:20] radio on and you're just flipping
[1:20:21] through radio stations you better be
[1:20:22] careful right come on cuz you got to
[1:20:25] guard what's coming into your
[1:20:27] ears but if you can sit down and I have
[1:20:30] this little thumb drive that I put in my
[1:20:32] truck and I leave it in my truck soon as
[1:20:34] I fire my truck up guess what there's a
[1:20:36] prophet's voice that's speaking to me I
[1:20:39] don't have to guard it right because I
[1:20:41] know whatever comes through there is
[1:20:43] going to be edifying to me and I don't
[1:20:46] have to guard it like I I don't want to
[1:20:47] keep you standing standing for too long
[1:20:50] thank you so much for the music this
[1:20:52] evening God bless the musicians let's
[1:20:54] let's give them a a praise offering
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:07] tonight I'm telling you I've told you
[1:21:10] before you don't know how blessed you
[1:21:14] are you you just maybe you do but I
[1:21:17] think many people don't realize how
[1:21:20] blessed you are and and how how intrical
[1:21:24] it is to a service for the musicians the
[1:21:28] ministry of Music it it's exactly what
[1:21:31] it is a Ministry of
[1:21:33] Music look throughout the
[1:21:36] scriptures whenever different ones when
[1:21:39] when David was struggling or when
[1:21:41] different ones were struggling and they
[1:21:43] needed to break through the spirits that
[1:21:45] was B binding them up did they call for
[1:21:48] a
[1:21:48] preacher did they call for the prophet
[1:21:51] no what did they call for men a prophet
[1:21:55] called for a Minstrel
[1:21:57] right because it's through the music
[1:22:00] that breaks those bonds it opens up our
[1:22:05] ability to enter into his presence so we
[1:22:09] we we're not giving them praise we're
[1:22:12] not we're not trying to we're just
[1:22:13] thanking God that he's allowed them to

[1:25:24] that that partway through the race that
[1:25:25] you lay the Baton
[1:25:27] down what what good is it to finish
[1:25:30] finish the race at that point right

[1:27:26] down the street with herself all carried
[1:27:28] out like
[1:27:29] that and men's clothes on come on now
[1:27:34] that's what it looks like to God yes sir
[1:27:36] yes it's an Abomination what he saying
[1:27:40] something that's filthy and stinking
[1:27:43] before
[1:27:45] God
[1:27:46] yet she'll go to church on
[1:27:49] Sunday and decorate up yes sir
[1:27:54] they'll go a man down there and drink
[1:27:57] and cheat and love money and cheat his
[1:28:01] neighbor and everything else to get a
[1:28:03] little extra money and do these things
[1:28:06] and
[1:28:07] Gamble and
[1:28:09] smoke and
[1:28:11] drink and
[1:28:13] lie then goes to church and
[1:28:18] testify Brown says
[1:28:20] Abomination
[1:28:22] filthiness he said that's the
[1:28:24] intellectual
[1:28:28] church that's the intellectual church
[1:28:30] and a lot of churches today want you to
[1:28:33] become an intellectual Church they want
[1:28:36] to do away with signs and wonders they
[1:28:40] want they want to do away with the
[1:28:42] actual power of God and they want you to
[1:28:45] keep it all up in your mind and say as
[1:28:47] long as I can say that I believe it and
[1:28:50] I've read it and I go to this church or
[1:28:52] I go to that church or I've got this on
[1:28:54] my wall or I'm wearing this type of tie
[1:28:56] or I've got this type of belt buckle or
[1:28:58] any of those type of things that I'm
[1:29:00] okay well that's intellectual
[1:29:03] thinking that stinks before God it it
[1:29:07] does not equate to a life
[1:29:10] lived it does not equate to Having the
[1:29:12] Holy Spirit dwelling within you all it
[1:29:16] means that you that you've heard
[1:29:17] somebody say something and you've
[1:29:20] chosen to follow that path but it does
[1:29:23] not mean that you have the Holy Spirit
[1:29:25] living you if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:29:27] dwelling inside of you there will be
[1:29:30] demonstrations of his power that comes
[1:29:33] forth from your life tonight it's not
[1:29:36] just going to be words on paper no sir
[1:29:39] it has to come off of the pages of this
[1:29:42] book and it has to live and dwell within
[1:29:45] you and then it has to produce his life
[1:29:48] not your
[1:29:50] life it does not it don't even need to
[1:29:53] produce the life of William bradam it
[1:29:55] needs to produce the Life of
[1:30:00] Christ for too many years and I've been
[1:30:04] around for almost as long as brother
[1:30:06] Steve not quite he's a bit older than I
[1:30:10] am but for too many
[1:30:13] years I heard brother Brandon brother
[1:30:16] Brandon brother Brandon brother God sent
[1:30:17] a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a
[1:30:19] prophet God sent a prophet that's
[1:30:20] wonderful wonderful I love that God sent
[1:30:23] a prophet
[1:30:25] I believe it 100% that he sent a prophet
[1:30:28] tell me what he said and how that's
[1:30:31] going to get me closer to
[1:30:33] Christ that's what I need to
[1:30:36] know if he brings me a message all I
[1:30:39] need to know is how is that message
[1:30:42] going to explain this in Greater
[1:30:45] detail and let my life draw closer to
[1:30:49] Christ and become like him if we fa if
[1:30:53] we fail to become like Christ we will
[1:30:57] not make it I don't care that you can
[1:30:59] quote all 1200 and however many sermons
[1:31:02] that that he preached that doesn't
[1:31:04] matter you can sit here and quote every
[1:31:07] single scripture out of the Bible right
[1:31:10] if it's just left on
[1:31:12] pages it does not mean
[1:31:16] anything it must be a life
[1:31:21] lived not your life lived no it must be
[1:31:25] his life
[1:31:28] lived praise the Lord
[1:31:33] hallelujah whatever you when you when
[1:31:36] when you look at the word
[1:31:40] Temple when we were reading in the in
[1:31:42] the the scriptures there in Corinthians
[1:31:44] and it's talking about us being a temple
[1:31:47] yes sir the Greek word that was used
[1:31:51] there is n
[1:31:54] naos is a dwelling of God n a oos naos
[1:31:59] if I pronounced it correctly I believe I
[1:32:00] am um it's a dwelling of God is the
[1:32:03] inner part of a temple right is
[1:32:06] referring
[1:32:08] to the holy of
[1:32:11] Hol so he's equating in Corinthians he's
[1:32:15] equ equating your life my life to now be
[1:32:21] the holy of holies it's not just the
[1:32:25] temple in it the the the outer
[1:32:28] Court not the inner
[1:32:32] Court there's a place for the outer
[1:32:34] Court there's a place for the inner
[1:32:37] court but he is referencing that our
[1:32:40] body is to be the
[1:32:42] no it is to be the holy of
[1:32:46] holies do you I don't know how many I I
[1:32:49] know brother Steve has has studied many
[1:32:52] times on on the on the holy of holies
[1:32:55] and I'm sure that he's discussed it with
[1:32:57] many of you but you ever stop and
[1:32:59] consider that if your
[1:33:02] body is now equated to the holy of
[1:33:07] holies
[1:33:09] sir does not it make us look at oursel
[1:33:13] and
[1:33:14] say I need to clean myself
[1:33:18] up it certainly
[1:33:21] should there was only one that would go
[1:33:24] into the holy of
[1:33:26] holies one time a year I believe you you
[1:33:29] just celebrate yam Kapur if I I'm not y
[1:33:32] yam ker the day of
[1:33:34] atonement that was just this past
[1:33:37] weekend I
[1:33:39] believe that was signifying the one
[1:33:43] time that the priest would go in behind
[1:33:47] the veil that's right to the holy of
[1:33:51] holies everything had to be in order
[1:33:53] order yes right
[1:33:56] everything everything about His Garment
[1:33:59] everything about his life it had to be
[1:34:02] completely clean Sanctified for him to
[1:34:06] enter in to the holy of holies and come
[1:34:10] out alive
[1:34:14] amen but yet we live our life so
[1:34:19] haphazardly to us we go in and out of
[1:34:22] places that we should
[1:34:24] never ever subject oursel
[1:34:29] to because we are supposed to be the
[1:34:33] naos the holy of holies our body is to
[1:34:38] be that Temple that level that's what he
[1:34:40] equated us to and yet we treat it so
[1:34:43] haphazard we we allow so many things to
[1:34:46] come into our eyes that's right we allow
[1:34:50] so many things to enter into our ears
[1:34:54] and those things are
[1:34:56] defiling the
[1:34:58] temple go back and read what he says if
[1:35:01] you defile the temple right him will God
[1:35:04] destroy
[1:35:05] exactly come on Sir so it behooves us
[1:35:10] tonight to pay attention that's it to
[1:35:13] our life pay attention to what we are
[1:35:17] bringing in through our the inlets of
[1:35:20] our eyes our ears the conversations that
[1:35:23] we that we have the places that we go
[1:35:25] Ste the truth we are supposed to be the
[1:35:29] temple of God but I don't think we're
[1:35:31] acting like it most of the time come on
[1:35:33] now help us now I I told you this this
[1:35:36] morning it was it was emotional for me
[1:35:38] to to to sit down and I was I was
[1:35:41] reading over the scriptures and God was
[1:35:43] dealing with me and he's like boy good
[1:35:45] pre thank you there's days that your
[1:35:49] temple is not as clean as it needs to be
[1:35:57] it ain't as clean as it needs to
[1:35:59] be and how do we think that we we sat
[1:36:03] here and we let all this trash in our
[1:36:06] lives in our homes and then we say that
[1:36:11] we're inviting God to
[1:36:13] come and take residence
[1:36:16] there I I can tell you from experience
[1:36:20] in my own natural home my
[1:36:24] house if I get a call from somebody and
[1:36:27] says hey we're going to come over we're
[1:36:31] 5 minutes down the road you know what
[1:36:32] happens usually we become
[1:36:36] frantic you're like somebody cling that
[1:36:39] up somebody move that somebody put that
[1:36:40] back somebody you you become in a in a
[1:36:43] frantic pace of I don't want them to
[1:36:45] enter into my natural house and it be in
[1:36:52] disarray but we come to
[1:36:56] church with trash in our life hatred in
[1:37:00] our heart bitterness grudges all types
[1:37:05] of
[1:37:06] malice and we say feel my cup
[1:37:11] Lord feel my cup
[1:37:13] Lord and he looks down and he
[1:37:16] says not in that
[1:37:19] condition not in that condition
[1:37:23] you're going to have to be
[1:37:26] Sanctified you're going to have to be
[1:37:28] scoured
[1:37:29] out before he comes in places himself he
[1:37:33] says I have to take your spirit out of
[1:37:36] you and then I've got to take another
[1:37:39] spirit in place it in you for my spirit
[1:37:42] to then have communion and dwell within
[1:37:45] you that's the word that's what he says
[1:37:48] that's that's how it works he's got to
[1:37:49] do
[1:37:50] that I have no worry in my notes but
[1:37:53] that's all right I I've got I've got
[1:37:55] something with me I didn't know when I
[1:37:58] might do this
[1:38:00] but and I'm not sure if this will make
[1:38:03] sense or not and y'all don't have a big
[1:38:06] area
[1:38:08] to these are glass I hope they don't
[1:38:13] fall
[1:38:14] stay I'm not promoting McDonald's it's
[1:38:17] the only clear that's that's it
[1:38:21] is but you'll see why
[1:38:24] it works out that this is
[1:38:33] here I like
[1:38:36] visuals visuals sometimes help with
[1:38:39] things now I don't know how many are you
[1:38:42] are old enough to have went to
[1:38:46] restaurant sit down restaurants whenever
[1:38:48] you used to go for
[1:38:50] breakfast I whenever I was a a 13 years
[1:38:53] old my first job was working for a
[1:38:55] little restaurant in town um called the
[1:38:57] home food shop they had a uh they were
[1:39:00] they were famous in our town for their
[1:39:02] breakfast and every you know whenever I
[1:39:04] was working there I would notice brother
[1:39:07] Steve that whenever all the tables were
[1:39:10] set so they came people would come
[1:39:12] through the line order their food pick
[1:39:14] up their food and they go down go to the
[1:39:16] table but the table was already set with
[1:39:18] the silverware the napkin and a coffee
[1:39:21] cup had a little plate on there and um
[1:39:24] this was the position that the cup was
[1:39:28] when you sat down at the
[1:39:32] table now they would come around you'd
[1:39:34] be sitting there
[1:39:36] eating and the waitresses or the waiters
[1:39:38] would come
[1:39:39] around with a pot of coffee in their
[1:39:42] hand now at this restaurant particularly
[1:39:45] that I worked at they did not ask you if
[1:39:48] you wanted
[1:39:51] coffee if you wanted coffee
[1:39:55] when you got to the table you turned the
[1:39:58] cup upright that signified to them as
[1:40:02] they would come
[1:40:03] through I want
[1:40:05] coffee they didn't ask they just they
[1:40:08] were they were busy because it was a
[1:40:09] very busy place people coming and going
[1:40:11] they didn't take the time do you want
[1:40:13] coffee but you knew and everybody that
[1:40:15] went there knew if I wanted coffee I had
[1:40:17] to take my cup from this
[1:40:19] position and I had to turn it to here I
[1:40:22] hear you now if that cup stayed right
[1:40:25] there they wouldn't stop and talk to
[1:40:28] you they wouldn't stop and say are you
[1:40:31] sure that you don't want some don't want
[1:40:34] coffee cuz I want to give you some
[1:40:37] coffee we made coffee we've made it all
[1:40:39] morning I really want to fill your cup
[1:40:43] with coffee sir they would never go to
[1:40:45] your table and turn your cup upright
[1:40:50] themselves they're not going to touch
[1:40:52] your cup
[1:40:55] they were not going to change the
[1:40:57] position that your cup was
[1:41:00] in what they would do is if they noticed
[1:41:03] that your cup looked like this and the
[1:41:06] person sitting beside you's cup looked
[1:41:07] like that they would come to you fill it
[1:41:12] up this person they didn't even speak to
[1:41:15] this church come on because they left
[1:41:18] themsel I'm sorry they left their
[1:41:21] Cup in a position
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:25] signified I don't want to be filled
[1:41:32] up even want
[1:41:34] it that's how they spoke they spoke just
[1:41:38] because of the position of the cup no
[1:41:41] conversation had to be
[1:41:43] given people come
[1:41:45] in and this is the way they live their
[1:41:48] life
[1:41:50] exactly and wonder why and they'll be
[1:41:52] sitting beside side a person that's
[1:41:54] right
[1:41:57] here and they'll be
[1:41:59] like what's the big deal I mean why I
[1:42:03] mean why why won't they come and talk to
[1:42:05] me why why don't they come and I mean
[1:42:07] I'm I'm in church
[1:42:10] too I came to the same
[1:42:13] restaurant I sat down at the same
[1:42:18] table but this person's cup got
[1:42:21] filled and this person 's cup got
[1:42:25] bypassed and all they had to
[1:42:28] do was change their
[1:42:33] position it's all they had to do change
[1:42:37] their position to allow themselves to
[1:42:40] become
[1:42:42] full see but then you go I have to move
[1:42:46] this because I don't want to
[1:42:48] fall and then there's
[1:42:51] those that sit in a restant like this
[1:42:53] I'm sry sitting at church restaurant
[1:42:56] yeah we're talking about restaurants
[1:42:57] right using a restaurant analogy not I'm
[1:43:00] not trying to say they sit in church
[1:43:02] like this but you have some that that
[1:43:04] that go to a
[1:43:05] restaurant
[1:43:07] and they
[1:43:09] had
[1:43:12] drink the cup was
[1:43:18] full and then all of a sudden over time
[1:43:23] it ran out exactly
[1:43:26] right will
[1:43:29] and they they
[1:43:33] say I want to be like that
[1:43:36] person I used to have the holy ghost in
[1:43:40] my
[1:43:40] life I was full at one
[1:43:45] time and so then you say well I'd be
[1:43:49] happy to give you some
[1:43:50] more and they sit in this condition can
[1:43:52] y'all see yes
[1:43:55] sir oh somebody saw it that's right
[1:43:59] there's a lid on it sir you got your Li
[1:44:02] and they come in and they sit there and
[1:44:05] they say fill me up Lord fill me up Lord
[1:44:10] but they keep the lid on and then the
[1:44:13] Holy Spirit comes comes through and the
[1:44:15] Holy Spirit says you know maybe you're
[1:44:18] struggling so I I I want to fill you up
[1:44:22] and and and it it
[1:44:24] starts trying
[1:44:32] to I'm not just making a fool of myself
[1:44:35] you might think I am but I am preaching
[1:44:37] right now you sure
[1:44:39] are the Holy Spirit wants to fill you
[1:44:44] up he wants to make you completely
[1:44:48] whole but the life that we live many
[1:44:51] times we walk into church and we've
[1:44:53] closed oursel off at one
[1:44:57] time we had
[1:45:00] oil you remember the the the five wise
[1:45:04] and the five
[1:45:06] foolish somewhere in my notes I'm I'm so
[1:45:08] off of my notes right now it doesn't
[1:45:13] matter see the the the the five
[1:45:16] wise they had oil in their vessels and
[1:45:21] they had addition oil at extra
[1:45:25] oil the five
[1:45:27] foolish
[1:45:30] didn't whenever whenever the call come
[1:45:33] they said give us of your
[1:45:36] oil CU they they didn't want to they
[1:45:39] didn't want to be without light they
[1:45:40] wanted to have they wanted they had a
[1:45:42] desire and at one time that mean they
[1:45:45] were all virgins they were all pure they
[1:45:47] had all been
[1:45:49] Sanctified that's what it when it talks
[1:45:51] about the the the Virg it's talks it's
[1:45:54] describing to us they were all virgins
[1:45:57] they were all
[1:46:00] Sanctified but they did not have a
[1:46:02] continual refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:05] of the oil that continued to flow that
[1:46:08] continually flowed it has to you can't
[1:46:12] go through life saying I was filled with
[1:46:16] the Holy Ghost 42 years
[1:46:18] ago I
[1:46:21] remember and I'm still living off of
[1:46:23] that experience exactly it has to be a
[1:46:27] continual refilling of the baptism of
[1:46:31] the holy spirit it's not just a oneand
[1:46:36] done you know they they say you could if
[1:46:39] you sat there long enough you could just
[1:46:40] continually refill this cup you could
[1:46:42] take your lid
[1:46:44] [Applause]
[1:46:46] off you know and if if you're in a
[1:46:48] restaurant that that has given you you
[1:46:50] some of the restaurants especially after
[1:46:53] uh 2020 they they gave you all tog go
[1:46:56] cups they didn't give you glasses and
[1:46:58] all that they they started doing all to
[1:47:00] go cups and they would put a lid on it
[1:47:02] and they would have a straw in it and
[1:47:03] they would bring it out to you and that
[1:47:05] was your drink to signify to
[1:47:08] them that you wanted more
[1:47:13] drink you had to take a lid
[1:47:16] off I would take it off and I would set
[1:47:18] it to the side again they were not going
[1:47:21] to touch your cup
[1:47:26] it's not up to Brother Steve to come
[1:47:28] into your life and take your top off of
[1:47:31] your life and say please let me feel you
[1:47:36] more he comes brother Wesley comes
[1:47:39] brother Joe comes these other ministers
[1:47:41] come to bring the Holy Spirit of the
[1:47:44] word to come and pour into your life and
[1:47:48] people come in here and they do this
[1:47:50] right here
[1:47:53] and all it does then it gets you wet on
[1:47:54] the
[1:47:57] outside you feel a
[1:47:59] shiver I felt the Holy
[1:48:02] Spirit that's great on the outside but
[1:48:05] it ain't doing you as much good as it
[1:48:07] would if you would allow it to fill up
[1:48:11] your
[1:48:12] vessel because then if your vessel is
[1:48:15] full then you can go and you can pour it
[1:48:18] out to somebody else and then say Lord
[1:48:21] fill me up again and I can share it with
[1:48:24] somebody else and I can keep allowing
[1:48:26] him to fill my life and I can pour it
[1:48:29] out and I can help somebody
[1:48:33] else Romans chap 12 verse 1 if I don't
[1:48:38] get started we're not even going to get
[1:48:40] anywhere get started I thought you was
[1:48:42] started well I'm getting ready to start
[1:48:45] I beseech you therefore
[1:48:47] bre by the mercies of God that you
[1:48:50] present your bodies a Living
[1:48:53] Sacrifice holy holy acceptable unto God
[1:48:59] which is
[1:49:01] your reasonable
[1:49:04] service it's the least you could do
[1:49:06] right it's the least the least you can
[1:49:09] do people will make that comment that it
[1:49:12] was the least I could do well that's the
[1:49:13] least we can do is that we can present
[1:49:16] our bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:49:20] acceptable unto God
[1:49:24] 1955 uh the message beginning and ending
[1:49:26] of the Gentile dispensation brother Ram
[1:49:29] says after his death Bel shazar his
[1:49:32] grandson succeeded him and then he was
[1:49:36] more wicked than King
[1:49:38] Nebuchadnezzar and one night yeah they
[1:49:41] had a great big party they called all
[1:49:43] their magistrates and all the officers
[1:49:45] in for a great big Jamboree and while
[1:49:48] they were having this Jamboree they went
[1:49:51] and called out and took the vessels the
[1:49:53] holy vessels of God just to make fun of
[1:49:57] God and drink wine to their gods a toast
[1:50:02] out of the vessels of the
[1:50:06] Lord Bram says now a man is permitted to
[1:50:09] travel so far listen but there is a
[1:50:13] separating line between life and death
[1:50:19] you must never cross that see
[1:50:23] you can go on with your little
[1:50:25] foolishness for a while but you better
[1:50:28] know better know where the line is he
[1:50:32] says did the Lord ever check you on
[1:50:38] anything I can say yes Lord he's checked
[1:50:41] me on many
[1:50:43] things he does all of us pull the check
[1:50:47] reins say that's far enough
[1:50:51] now I'm so thankful he does
[1:50:54] that I'm cuz if he didn't and we were
[1:50:57] left to our own
[1:51:00] demise we would continue right on going
[1:51:03] the direction that we were going but he
[1:51:05] checks you and said that's far
[1:51:08] enough then you better watch what you're
[1:51:11] doing from then on if you're stepping
[1:51:14] across that
[1:51:16] line I don't ever want to cross that
[1:51:19] separating line I don't want to get any
[1:51:22] anywhere near that separating line I
[1:51:26] want him to check me 50 mil from it I
[1:51:29] want him to hold me back and say hey
[1:51:33] stop check
[1:51:35] yourself see are you lining up with the
[1:51:38] word or
[1:51:41] not because if we're not lining up the
[1:51:43] word lining up with the word we're going
[1:51:46] to be a complete failure complete
[1:51:48] failure right right see they they were
[1:51:51] misusing the vessels of God
[1:51:54] that that was the time that that the
[1:51:56] Lord came down and with his finger he
[1:51:59] wrote and I don't know if I pronounced
[1:52:01] it right many many tearson somewhere in
[1:52:04] that it was saying Thou Art weighed in
[1:52:07] the balance and found wanting anybody
[1:52:11] ever looked at the balance scales that's
[1:52:13] what it's talking about you you you come
[1:52:15] up a bit short you know they they were
[1:52:18] being judged their life was not leveling
[1:52:21] out against the balance of of God's word
[1:52:24] we must be careful that we are not found
[1:52:27] guilty of misusing right the ve this
[1:52:31] vessel of
[1:52:34] God if we're not careful we will misuse
[1:52:38] his vessel we'll use it for sport we'll
[1:52:42] use it for things that we want to do
[1:52:45] whenever he's telling us that's not what
[1:52:46] I've called you to do with your vessel
[1:52:49] I've called you to live a Sanctified and
[1:52:51] a holy life that is given 100% fully
[1:52:57] over to him that's his desire for us he
[1:53:02] we we got to get all this out of our
[1:53:04] head that that this is more important
[1:53:07] the things of this world is more
[1:53:08] important to me I I want to become this
[1:53:10] you have these aspirations I want to
[1:53:12] become this someday and I want to do
[1:53:13] this someday why does any of that matter
[1:53:16] whenever you're talking about
[1:53:19] eternity it doesn't mean anything lay
[1:53:22] all those things aside and allow his
[1:53:26] will that's the one of the hardest
[1:53:29] statements you'll ever make there's four
[1:53:32] words thy will be
[1:53:37] done four of the hardest words that you
[1:53:40] will ever say Jesus himself had to say
[1:53:44] those
[1:53:46] words see some people say that that he
[1:53:49] you know he he wasn't he he wasn't man
[1:53:51] he was he was all God he was all God he
[1:53:54] was all man
[1:53:56] too and that flesh body that was created
[1:54:00] to be a sacrifice had a will of its
[1:54:03] own just like your
[1:54:06] body has a will of its own right right
[1:54:11] Paul said I have to mortify the
[1:54:13] flesh I I have to bring myself under
[1:54:18] subjection to this word every single
[1:54:24] day every moment of every day if I don't
[1:54:29] then it becomes
[1:54:32] trashy if I don't keep it under
[1:54:35] subjection to that my life gets filled
[1:54:37] up with the trash of this world and God
[1:54:40] will not dwell in an unclean
[1:54:43] vessel he won't he won't do it he can't
[1:54:47] he cannot dwell what Concord does he
[1:54:50] have with bow he cannot dwell
[1:54:53] in an
[1:54:54] unclean vessel he refuses to do that so
[1:55:00] we have to we must clean our life up
[1:55:05] allow him to take full preeminence
[1:55:09] that's right that's right full
[1:55:12] preeminence in our body i i as as I was
[1:55:16] relating to to brother Joe last night
[1:55:18] talking about running the race and
[1:55:19] finishing the race and I I was thinking
[1:55:21] about the the the the five wise the five
[1:55:24] foolish what good was it for them the
[1:55:26] five foolish they ran that race they got
[1:55:30] there waiting for the
[1:55:33] bridegroom only to
[1:55:35] realize they failed one of the most
[1:55:37] important things they did not have
[1:55:40] enough oil that's right they did not
[1:55:43] have what it took they did not have the
[1:55:46] full baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling
[1:55:50] within them and if you're here tonight
[1:55:52] and you don't know that you have the
[1:55:54] fullness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:55:57] Ghost living and dwelling inside of you
[1:55:59] don't
[1:56:01] leave don't
[1:56:04] leave sir you don't want to get to the
[1:56:07] end of the race and him tell like he did
[1:56:10] oh I got to find it I got to find it oh
[1:56:13] my my my my my my my um y'all forgive me
[1:56:17] but I got to I got to find it
[1:56:23] oh my maybe I've got
[1:56:28] it Hallelujah y'all forgive me it just
[1:56:31] it just offended us yet
[1:56:35] okay he used the word yet I'm not trying
[1:56:39] to offend anybody um but I don't want to
[1:56:41] offend the Holy Spirit at
[1:56:43] all
[1:56:45] um oh my I probably could I can't I
[1:56:49] can't search it that fast um
[1:56:53] oh it it was it somebody help me with
[1:56:56] the scriptures where it's dealing with
[1:56:57] the five wise the five foolish MTH
[1:57:00] Matthew 25 it was right where
[1:57:04] my it's right here right where this
[1:57:09] was afterward this is verse 11 I'm not
[1:57:12] sure if I gave oh did I give that oh
[1:57:16] wow I can't find it in my notes
[1:57:19] afterward came also the other virgin
[1:57:21] saying Lord Lord Lord open to
[1:57:24] us see they were
[1:57:28] Sanctified they were cleaned up they had
[1:57:31] a lamp that's
[1:57:34] right they're like what's what's
[1:57:36] different between them and us but he
[1:57:39] answered and
[1:57:40] said
[1:57:42] verily I say unto
[1:57:45] you I know you
[1:57:50] not do you really want to run the
[1:57:53] race to come to the end of the race to
[1:57:57] hear him say I know you
[1:58:01] not see that's you getting to the end of
[1:58:04] the race and you didn't have the Baton
[1:58:06] in your hand you're
[1:58:08] disqualified because you did not have
[1:58:11] the Holy Spirit dwelling in its fullness
[1:58:14] within
[1:58:16] you you dropped it along the way
[1:58:21] somewhere and he says you did run
[1:58:24] well who did hinder you I heard it for
[1:58:28] many years you did run well what they
[1:58:31] said who and then they some people say
[1:58:33] what did hinder you it's not a
[1:58:36] what it's a
[1:58:40] who many times the
[1:58:42] who is
[1:58:44] [Applause]
[1:58:46] you the who is me that gets in the way
[1:58:49] that's what hinders me is this flesh man
[1:58:53] that I'm dwelling inside of at the
[1:58:56] moment but
[1:58:58] see this is not my
[1:59:02] home you see this flesh that they call
[1:59:05] Dwayne Jackson but this is not
[1:59:10] me can I show you a picture of
[1:59:17] me that's a picture of
[1:59:20] me because I have
[1:59:22] representation dwelling inside of me
[1:59:26] that was placed there by him that's
[1:59:29] right that's who I really am if my
[1:59:33] theophany could step down and you see my
[1:59:36] theophany that's who I really am brother
[1:59:40] brandham would say in one place that I
[1:59:41] don't have none of this in the notes he
[1:59:42] would say that we you know we stepped we
[1:59:44] came out we came from arthop and we're
[1:59:46] going back to
[1:59:49] it so I was already there right
[1:59:52] I was already there before the
[1:59:54] foundation of the world I was already
[1:59:58] there amen I've got to find find where I
[2:00:02] was at that's
[2:00:05] okay Matthew chap 23:
[2:00:09] 25 through
[2:00:11] 28
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:19] wo
[2:00:20] whoo unto you scribes and
[2:00:27] Pharisees teachers
[2:00:31] evangelist
[2:00:34] pastors
[2:00:36] Apostles wo to
[2:00:39] us and that does not take you out of
[2:00:42] that equation as
[2:00:44] well for you make clean the
[2:00:48] outside of the cup
[2:00:52] and of the platter I don't have a
[2:00:53] platter with me but within they are
[2:00:57] full of extortion in
[2:01:01] excess Thou blind
[2:01:04] Pharisee cleanse first that which is
[2:01:08] within the cup and platter that the
[2:01:11] outside of them may be clean
[2:01:15] also inside out
[2:01:18] inside
[2:01:20] out let's be
[2:01:22] concerned about the
[2:01:24] inside and as you clean the inside guess
[2:01:28] what the water is also going to cleanse
[2:01:31] that
[2:01:33] outside
[2:01:35] sometimes we look at
[2:01:38] people and we don't we we think that
[2:01:40] their outside is too
[2:01:43] dirty but we don't stop and think that
[2:01:49] God is taking the water of his word
[2:01:52] yes sir when they're sitting in
[2:01:54] church and he's dealing with the inside
[2:01:58] of their life that's right it starts and
[2:02:01] he's cleaning them out word by word by
[2:02:06] word as it goes forth the washing of the
[2:02:09] water of the word is cleaning them
[2:02:14] out give them
[2:02:19] time give them a moment because you'll
[2:02:22] start witnessing as the inside is being
[2:02:26] cleaned oh yes yes sir that
[2:02:29] outside is going to express what what
[2:02:33] was on the
[2:02:35] inside because if that Holy Spirit it
[2:02:39] continually fills them up guess what
[2:02:42] there's only a certain place I don't
[2:02:43] want to do it cuz I don't want to make a
[2:02:44] mess but there's only so much if I was
[2:02:47] to start pouring this bottle of water
[2:02:48] into this cup there's only so much that
[2:02:51] it can hold inside it becomes super
[2:02:54] saturated and it'll actually create a
[2:02:56] little bubble on the top but if I
[2:02:57] continue to pour it guess where it
[2:02:59] goes over the
[2:03:02] edge so just allow them to sit and let
[2:03:07] that water keep pouring in
[2:03:09] them don't go to them and say you you
[2:03:12] don't fit in here because you're doing
[2:03:14] this and you're and I can see this and I
[2:03:16] can see this about your life no poor if
[2:03:20] you've got the holy spirit in you come
[2:03:23] on give him the word David said my cup
[2:03:28] runs runneth
[2:03:32] over and if you if I can get next to
[2:03:35] somebody whose cup is
[2:03:37] full and they get under that anointing
[2:03:39] and I'm under that anointing and that
[2:03:41] cup is running over guess what that Holy
[2:03:44] Spirit that they're feeling that
[2:03:46] anointing that water of the the the word
[2:03:49] is going to Splash out on me it's going
[2:03:51] to Splash Cas out on you but you've got
[2:03:53] to be in that
[2:03:55] presence and you can't come
[2:03:59] in and sit down on the
[2:04:03] preacher you come in like that you ain't
[2:04:06] going out with nothing you may come in
[2:04:09] Oh My My
[2:04:14] My I've got to find it
[2:04:19] now you know I don't know if a put about
[2:04:22] the whest
[2:04:26] seers 27 see I didn't even have that I
[2:04:31] do I do have that see I've got it in my
[2:04:34] notes and I just completely forgot about
[2:04:36] it woe unto you scribes and
[2:04:39] Pharisees
[2:04:43] Hypocrites for ye are liked unto Whited
[2:04:48] seers which indeed appear be
[2:04:52] beautiful
[2:04:56] outward man that cup is
[2:05:00] beautiful they dress
[2:05:02] right they act
[2:05:05] right they know
[2:05:09] quotes they have a cloud on their belt
[2:05:16] buckle if you got a cloud on your belt
[2:05:18] buckle that's it's okay
[2:05:26] which indeed appear beautiful
[2:05:29] outward but are
[2:05:32] within
[2:05:35] full full means there's no room for
[2:05:38] nothing
[2:05:41] else ain't no room for nothing
[2:05:44] else no more draps can run in you ever
[2:05:48] heard that that's a southern saying not
[2:05:51] a drap ran in not a drap ran out that's
[2:05:54] I'm back in the hills of North Carolina
[2:05:56] that's how we talk up there they're full
[2:05:58] of dead men's bones and of
[2:06:02] all
[2:06:04] uncleanness even so ye
[2:06:08] outwardly appear righteous unto
[2:06:13] men I'm
[2:06:15] clean I'm clean you can't put a finger
[2:06:18] on my
[2:06:19] life you you I I live my life clean I I
[2:06:24] don't sin like you other people sin you
[2:06:28] don't you can't put a finger on my life
[2:06:31] but see
[2:06:33] inside it's full of
[2:06:36] uncleanness they've dressed it up on the
[2:06:38] outside they act the part of a Christian
[2:06:41] they act the part of a message believer
[2:06:43] they've learned the lingo they've
[2:06:46] learned cliches to say this to say that
[2:06:49] when they're around this person when
[2:06:50] they're around that person but when they
[2:06:52] are by themselves come on come on now
[2:06:57] when they are by themselves yes
[2:07:00] sir they they're letting all sorts of
[2:07:04] things in their
[2:07:07] home I don't even I don't have my iPhone
[2:07:09] with me it's one of the most evil things
[2:07:11] that we have is access to technology the
[2:07:16] way we have
[2:07:18] nowadays it is so quick of an Inlet for
[2:07:22] Satan to come into your into your
[2:07:26] car into your home and if we are not
[2:07:30] careful we'll allow our Temple our no to
[2:07:34] become
[2:07:36] dirty and guess what that Dove
[2:07:39] does he sets off on a limb somewhere and
[2:07:43] says whenever I see that it's clean then
[2:07:47] I'll go back and I'll take up dwelling
[2:07:50] again but he is not going to dwell in an
[2:07:55] unclean
[2:07:58] vessel message revelation of Jesus
[2:08:00] Christ I hope I'm not tiring you out the
[2:08:03] vessel that Sanctified on the altar is
[2:08:07] ready for service service but not in
[2:08:12] service it's ready for service how many
[2:08:15] do canning anybody can vegetables or
[2:08:19] fruits or okay
[2:08:24] when if you're going to can some green
[2:08:26] beans let's say that we used to can
[2:08:28] green beans and tomatoes okra and those
[2:08:30] type
[2:08:32] things at what point do you choose to
[2:08:35] clean the jars and to
[2:08:40] sanctify to scour them out what time do
[2:08:43] you what at what place what time do you
[2:08:46] do
[2:08:47] that you do it before but you do it
[2:08:49] right before
[2:08:53] yeah you don't put your your your you
[2:08:56] don't boil the water and get your jars
[2:08:58] all clean and say well next
[2:09:02] season I'm going to put I'm going to use
[2:09:04] them again no now you do clean them
[2:09:07] after you use them and you store them
[2:09:10] away but when it's time for them to be
[2:09:12] used
[2:09:14] again you get them
[2:09:18] out and you sanctify that vessel
[2:09:23] and then you
[2:09:26] immediately fill
[2:09:28] it and then you seal
[2:09:33] it it's not it's not I'm going to get it
[2:09:36] cleaned up and I'm going to let it sit
[2:09:37] on the
[2:09:39] shelf for two weeks no that wasn't how
[2:09:42] it worked at our
[2:09:44] house we're in there working with the
[2:09:46] green beans and we're snapping and we're
[2:09:47] washing green beans and Mom's like
[2:09:49] somebody needs to go put the put the the
[2:09:51] glass jars in the dishwasher so we can
[2:09:54] we can scour them out and we can make
[2:09:56] sure they're perfectly clean and then
[2:09:58] when we got them out we would take and
[2:10:00] we would wipe them take the top and we
[2:10:03] would make sure before you put that lid
[2:10:06] that little seal lid on there you made
[2:10:09] sure that there was no imperfections of
[2:10:12] that top of that glass cuz you know what
[2:10:16] if there was any imperfections if there
[2:10:18] was
[2:10:19] anything to prevent vent whenever for it
[2:10:23] setting on there properly it would not
[2:10:25] seal properly sometimes it would not
[2:10:27] seal at all other times you would think
[2:10:30] that it was
[2:10:33] sealed it looked like it was
[2:10:36] sealed but then you would go to open it
[2:10:39] up 6 months later and you
[2:10:43] realize it's
[2:10:45] ruined because there was just a little
[2:10:47] bit of sand or a little bit of something
[2:10:49] in between the glass jar and that seal
[2:10:53] that was sitting there and you did all
[2:10:55] that work and you were expecting I'm
[2:10:56] going to open up that can of green beans
[2:10:58] and I'm going to put it and we're going
[2:10:59] to have green beans for supper tonight
[2:11:02] and then you realize it was ruined
[2:11:04] because you did not fully get it
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:12] clean just the
[2:11:14] slightest the smallest there there was a
[2:11:17] statement that brother Brown made one
[2:11:18] time he said that if we doubt
[2:11:22] a single word of this written
[2:11:27] word if you doubt a single
[2:11:31] word it unarm
[2:11:33] you now why would you go into a battle
[2:11:39] unarmed doubting one single
[2:11:43] word one single imperfection in our life
[2:11:48] prevents the ceiling to take place
[2:11:52] we he said that he showed brother Perry
[2:11:55] green he just made the slightest mark
[2:11:58] one scratch of alt against
[2:12:01] someone we have to it we have to be
[2:12:05] completely
[2:12:09] clean can I tell you can I tell you a
[2:12:12] little story um out of out of the
[2:12:14] scripture and somehow I got to we try to
[2:12:16] wind this up but it ain't going to be
[2:12:18] right yet
[2:12:21] see y'all are so easy to preach to and
[2:12:23] so I'm going to blame it on y'all
[2:12:26] um I'm skipping some things though I
[2:12:28] have to um 2 Kings chapter
[2:12:32] 4 verses
[2:12:34] 1-7 and this is um this this is an
[2:12:37] interesting story to me and this is
[2:12:39] where I I I I got my um my title of of
[2:12:44] my sermon what came out of these
[2:12:46] scriptures here now there cried a
[2:12:47] certain woman of the wives of the sons
[2:12:49] of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy
[2:12:51] servant my husband is dead all right and
[2:12:54] thou knowest that thy servant did fear
[2:12:57] the lord and the Creditor is come to
[2:12:59] take unto him my two sons to be bondmen
[2:13:04] and Elisha said unto her what shall I do
[2:13:06] for
[2:13:08] thee it was that was her husband's boss
[2:13:11] you know that's the way I relate it I I
[2:13:14] look at it that way that was her
[2:13:15] husband's boss and I've had people come
[2:13:17] to me before whenever something happened
[2:13:19] to to one of my employes boys their
[2:13:21] spouse would come and say such and such
[2:13:23] such and such and what are you going to
[2:13:24] do how are you going to help me I I I
[2:13:26] need help that's what she was expressing
[2:13:29] and and uh tell me what hast thou Elisha
[2:13:32] said unto her what shall I do for thee
[2:13:35] tell me what hast thou in the
[2:13:40] house and she said thine
[2:13:42] handmaiden hath not anything in the
[2:13:46] house save a pot of
[2:13:49] oil pot of oil
[2:13:51] I looked up that word pot I like to look
[2:13:55] up words and and look at them a little
[2:13:58] deeper cuz I always in my mind I would
[2:14:00] Envision a pot I mean I cook in a pot so
[2:14:03] I'm thinking a pot well the the actual
[2:14:07] word that is used there is um aluk aluk
[2:14:12] it's um it's supposed to be a a flask a
[2:14:16] flask of oil um and I meant to ask you
[2:14:20] earlier if you had a flask like a flask
[2:14:22] of oil but I I know you had you had it
[2:14:25] one time but I think I don't see it up
[2:14:27] here but so it for you to understand
[2:14:31] being that he was a
[2:14:32] priest that would have been something
[2:14:34] very common to them to have a small
[2:14:38] flask of oil like anointing oil is what
[2:14:41] they would have they would have had it
[2:14:42] could have been used for different
[2:14:44] things but it was in your mind you might
[2:14:46] have been thinking like I was it's a big
[2:14:48] pot I got a big pot sitting over in a
[2:14:50] corner with a bunch of oil in it that
[2:14:52] wasn't what it was it was just something
[2:14:53] very small something minuscule something
[2:14:56] that was very common to them all then he
[2:14:59] said go borrow thee vessels abroad of
[2:15:04] all thy neighbors even empty vessels
[2:15:08] borrow not a few and when thou art come
[2:15:11] in Thou shalt shut the door upon thee
[2:15:14] and upon thy sons and shalt pour out all
[2:15:16] right into all these
[2:15:18] vessels and thou shalt set aside that
[2:15:22] which is
[2:15:24] full so she questioned him and said how
[2:15:27] in the world is this going to
[2:15:31] happen cuse this all I
[2:15:35] have is just this little small
[2:15:39] flask why in the world would you want me
[2:15:41] to go and
[2:15:42] borrow
[2:15:44] vessels a lot of vessels empty
[2:15:49] vessels how's this going to work no that
[2:15:52] wasn't what she
[2:15:54] did she
[2:15:56] accepted what the man of God told
[2:15:59] her and she went from him and shut the
[2:16:03] door upon her and upon her sons who
[2:16:05] brought the vessels to her and
[2:16:08] she poured
[2:16:10] out and she poured out and she poured
[2:16:15] out and she poured
[2:16:17] out and it came to pass
[2:16:21] when all the vessels were full she had
[2:16:25] vessel upon vessel upon vessel I I just
[2:16:27] think in my mind how did she convince
[2:16:29] the
[2:16:32] neighbors to give up these
[2:16:35] vessels I mean neighbors are nosy
[2:16:41] sometimes and I'm sure they're thinking
[2:16:46] we know she ain't got no money
[2:16:51] creditors are calling her every single
[2:16:54] day and she can't afford to pay them and
[2:16:58] now they're going to come and take what
[2:17:00] the only thing she has left of any value
[2:17:03] is her sons they're going to take that
[2:17:05] so why is she asking to
[2:17:09] borrow our vessels what's she going to
[2:17:12] is she going to Pond them off is she
[2:17:14] going to go try to sell these I mean
[2:17:16] think think through it I mean these are
[2:17:18] these are things that happen in her life
[2:17:21] these people knew her husband died they
[2:17:25] they saw the life that she was having to
[2:17:27] live and maybe she was having to scale
[2:17:28] back and she was barely getting by and
[2:17:30] and everything was leaving her house
[2:17:32] because she had no money she had no
[2:17:35] income she had no way to provide
[2:17:37] anything more and now she's asking her
[2:17:40] sons to go out to all the her neighbors
[2:17:43] and
[2:17:44] say we need to borrow a vessel why I
[2:17:48] can't tell you I just need to borrow a
[2:17:51] vessel you you got an empty one you and
[2:17:54] and it it couldn't be one that was
[2:17:56] cracked it had to be a good vessel you
[2:17:59] know couldn't have the imperfections in
[2:18:01] it it it had to be a proper vessel but
[2:18:04] she still did not know how it was going
[2:18:06] to
[2:18:07] work it came to pass when the vessels
[2:18:10] were
[2:18:11] full that she said unto her
[2:18:14] son bring me another one bring me
[2:18:17] another vessel bring me yet a
[2:18:19] vessel and he said unto her there is not
[2:18:22] a vessel
[2:18:23] more and the oil
[2:18:27] stayed so as long as there was a
[2:18:30] vessel
[2:18:32] available the oil continued to
[2:18:39] flow continued to flow as long as there
[2:18:42] was an available
[2:18:46] vessel that was in the right position
[2:18:51] to allow the Holy Spirit that's what the
[2:18:54] oil represents the Holy Spirit to allow
[2:18:58] it to become
[2:19:00] full she did not
[2:19:03] understand what the messenger told her
[2:19:06] how it was going to work she and she
[2:19:08] didn't stop at least in what I read she
[2:19:10] never stopped and questioned him exactly
[2:19:13] how is this all going to work but she
[2:19:18] obeyed IM she obey
[2:19:23] then she came and told them and of God
[2:19:26] and he
[2:19:27] said go sell the oil and pay thy debt
[2:19:32] and live thou and thy Children of the
[2:19:36] rest see it was enough it it it God
[2:19:39] provided enough as long as there was a
[2:19:42] vessel for him to fill he filled it and
[2:19:45] whenever all the vessels was full see
[2:19:47] the problem wasn't with the miracle
[2:19:51] the miracle was
[2:19:52] there that was the oil the miracle was
[2:19:56] in The Obedience of what she was told to
[2:19:59] do and she followed through with what
[2:20:01] she was told to do but all that Miracle
[2:20:04] needed was a vessel to be poured
[2:20:08] into and all he is asking for
[2:20:12] tonight is a vessel a temple that he can
[2:20:16] dwell in he's told us that we are the na
[2:20:21] we are the holy of holies but he
[2:20:25] refuses to dwell in an unclean vessel we
[2:20:31] must allow the word of God to come in
[2:20:34] and cleanse us of all
[2:20:37] impurities to come in and sanctify Our
[2:20:41] Lives to allow him to indwell yes sir
[2:20:46] because he is not going to cohabitate
[2:20:48] with sin
[2:20:51] he refuses to cohabitate with sin and
[2:20:55] the things of this world but so easily
[2:20:58] are we convinced by the world that
[2:21:01] that's what we need to take in and we
[2:21:04] need to allow that into our lives no
[2:21:08] push back against that fleshly
[2:21:12] desire and open up our heart and our
[2:21:15] life to allow him to fully fill us
[2:21:19] completely and to make our vessels
[2:21:23] full it don't need to be partially full
[2:21:27] it needs to be completely
[2:21:30] full praise the
[2:21:34] Lord oh
[2:21:36] my there was a I was reading is it okay
[2:21:40] to
[2:21:42] Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon had this made
[2:21:45] this comment and I I found it
[2:21:48] intriguing he said I believe
[2:21:51] that you and I in the matter of
[2:21:54] spiritual blessings from God have more
[2:21:57] to do with the measurement of our
[2:22:00] mercies than we
[2:22:03] think we make our blessings
[2:22:08] little we make our blessings
[2:22:11] little because our
[2:22:13] prayers are
[2:22:15] little see if if she had went out and
[2:22:18] told her sons just
[2:22:21] I don't really understand why he's
[2:22:22] asking us to do this but you know just
[2:22:24] just go to our our favorite neighbors
[2:22:27] next door and and see if they have a
[2:22:30] vessel and if they would have come back
[2:22:32] and had only one
[2:22:35] vessel he would have filled that one
[2:22:38] vessel because he was there to fill it
[2:22:41] the miracle was there the promise was
[2:22:44] given to fill that vessel however many
[2:22:48] vessels they brought was going to be
[2:22:49] full they did not fully understand that
[2:22:53] but they had received a promise and they
[2:22:55] moved on it and I don't know it doesn't
[2:22:56] tell me how many vessels they actually
[2:22:58] went but it was enough because they were
[2:23:00] they were able to to use that sell that
[2:23:03] oil and take care of themselves going
[2:23:05] forward so it's enough if you open your
[2:23:09] vessel up to him
[2:23:11] tonight he will f
[2:23:13] it and it's not a one-time feeling right
[2:23:18] he will continually
[2:23:20] poor himself every time you come and you
[2:23:24] open yourself up to him and you say
[2:23:26] Lord fill my
[2:23:28] cup fill my cup see you can't come in
[2:23:32] and say
[2:23:33] Lord fill my cup all
[2:23:38] right you can't you can't do
[2:23:41] that this is a
[2:23:43] cup when you when you lift your hands up
[2:23:46] to him and you say
[2:23:48] father I need you to f
[2:23:51] my
[2:23:52] cup make my vessel full tonight I don't
[2:23:57] want it to be halfway no I hate going to
[2:24:00] a restaurant and they come in and they
[2:24:02] hand me my cup of drink on and it comes
[2:24:06] out to me it looks like
[2:24:07] that F her up like I paid you for a full
[2:24:14] glass I would appreciate that you feel
[2:24:19] it and we're more concerned with a
[2:24:21] natural drink when we go to a restaurant
[2:24:24] of making sure our cup is full and then
[2:24:27] we We complain if it takes the waitress
[2:24:30] too long or the waiter too long wait
[2:24:32] person maybe that's what you're supposed
[2:24:33] to say nowadays I don't know um the if
[2:24:36] it takes them too long to come back and
[2:24:38] fill your
[2:24:40] cup yes sir but we'll go week after week
[2:24:45] after week after week after month after
[2:24:50] year
[2:24:51] with an empty vessel coming into church
[2:24:55] and we come in and we sit down with our
[2:24:57] lid
[2:25:01] on I really wish that he would preach
[2:25:03] something that that I would that I liked
[2:25:06] and if he'd preach something that that
[2:25:08] you know that I really liked I would I
[2:25:11] might take my lid off and allow allow
[2:25:13] that to come
[2:25:15] in it's too late
[2:25:17] then too late then see the thing is is
[2:25:21] when we come in we don't we don't have
[2:25:22] that choice we don't make that choice
[2:25:24] the choice is his you go out to a
[2:25:26] restaurant they say do you want Coke do
[2:25:28] you want Pepsi do you want um Sprite
[2:25:30] what do you want to drink and and we we
[2:25:32] tell them I want this and then we don't
[2:25:34] have that today I asked for ginger ale
[2:25:37] sorry we don't have ginger ale well I
[2:25:39] didn't just get up and
[2:25:41] leave I said well what do you have you
[2:25:44] have Sprite we have Sprite I'll take
[2:25:47] Sprite but see people come in church and
[2:25:50] just because the preacher is not
[2:25:51] preaching their pet
[2:25:53] [Applause]
[2:25:55] Doctrine he's not preaching exactly what
[2:25:58] they want to hear they shut themselves
[2:26:01] off and they'll say eh I'm not that
[2:26:04] thirsty I'm just going to put that off
[2:26:06] to the
[2:26:07] side maybe next week I'll come back and
[2:26:10] see if he's if he's talking about
[2:26:12] something I really want to
[2:26:15] hear that's not how it
[2:26:18] works all we supposed to do is come in
[2:26:22] and take our cup and say
[2:26:25] Lord you know what I have need
[2:26:29] of come on now see the thing is is I
[2:26:32] don't know what I have need
[2:26:33] [Music]
[2:26:35] of I have conceived ideas of what I
[2:26:39] think that I
[2:26:41] need and he comes in and says no that's
[2:26:44] not exactly what you need today today
[2:26:47] you need scouring out on right now next
[2:26:51] week he may come in he may pour the put
[2:26:54] put a bomb of Gilead on you and and and
[2:26:57] just clean everything up and and make
[2:26:58] you feel good but this morning or this
[2:27:01] evening he may say no you need to be
[2:27:06] Sanctified you've been out in the world
[2:27:09] this week you've allowed too much trash
[2:27:11] into your mind and into your home and
[2:27:14] into your life and what I've got to do
[2:27:16] this Sunday morning is I've got to scour
[2:27:18] you out
[2:27:21] to get you clean so then I can refill
[2:27:27] you again I'm not saying that that you
[2:27:31] get the Holy Ghost one you get the Holy
[2:27:33] Ghost and you don't need any more of
[2:27:36] him no no
[2:27:38] no because it has to
[2:27:41] continually flow it must be a continual
[2:27:46] refilling in your body
[2:27:50] my my
[2:27:52] my Mercy sakes y'all
[2:27:55] are y'all are so wonderful to to to
[2:27:58] preach
[2:27:59] to I I I wrote this note down this
[2:28:03] morning I sitting at the table I said we
[2:28:06] can't live in the Quagmire of sin during
[2:28:10] the
[2:28:11] week and plan on being in Heavenly
[2:28:15] places on Sunday
[2:28:17] morning amen and then we go back back to
[2:28:20] a Godless
[2:28:22] home and expect God to be able to move
[2:28:25] in our
[2:28:26] lives it
[2:28:28] matters what's in your
[2:28:31] [Music]
[2:28:33] house I'm not the pastor but it matters
[2:28:36] what's in your
[2:28:42] house if she had not had that flask of
[2:28:48] oil yes sir
[2:28:50] it was probably left to the side she was
[2:28:53] thinking it was
[2:28:54] insignificant everybody has it
[2:28:56] everybody's got that everybody has that
[2:28:58] that small I mean because he was a he
[2:29:00] was a priest so why why is that nobody
[2:29:02] wants it no I can't sell it because
[2:29:05] everybody has it it's common
[2:29:07] place but it was that oil that the
[2:29:11] miracle came through to continually fill
[2:29:15] up every vessel that was placed before
[2:29:19] it the House of Prayer for many people
[2:29:21] think that you're referring to this
[2:29:25] place House of Prayer starts at
[2:29:29] home it has to start at
[2:29:31] home but I think too often we we've
[2:29:34] considered just the church building as a
[2:29:37] House of Prayer but it has to be your
[2:29:40] house your personal home is where it
[2:29:42] must start when you ever notice when
[2:29:44] Noah got off the ark the very first
[2:29:46] thing he did was build an altar right he
[2:29:49] didn't even have a
[2:29:51] house but it showed me where his
[2:29:54] priorities were it was more important to
[2:29:57] him to have a place to meet God and to
[2:30:01] hear from him and to worship him and
[2:30:04] offer his praise and his adoration that
[2:30:07] was more important to him than a natural
[2:30:10] dwelling place to live in so what are
[2:30:13] your priority priorities
[2:30:15] [Music]
[2:30:17] today have we prepared our
[2:30:20] Temple have we emptied out our vessels
[2:30:23] of the worldly things so that the oil of
[2:30:26] the Holy Spirit can be poured into
[2:30:30] US it
[2:30:32] matters what's in your
[2:30:34] house it matters how we take care of
[2:30:39] this
[2:30:40] vessel you know I had a I had a
[2:30:42] situation a couple years ago I'm going
[2:30:44] to try to try to close um in in just a
[2:30:47] moment um by can share this little story
[2:30:51] with
[2:30:53] you had a situation at our house uh a
[2:30:56] couple years back or so that um on
[2:31:00] everybody knows what the sopit is on the
[2:31:02] house and you have a sopit vent that
[2:31:04] usually is for the exit air from a
[2:31:07] bathroom vent um at least this one was
[2:31:10] from that um so a sofit vent had fallen
[2:31:16] off you over the years it dry rotted and
[2:31:19] it it fell fell off of it and uh and I
[2:31:22] noticed that it was it was off and I
[2:31:25] really didn't pay a whole lot of
[2:31:26] attention to it I just notice there was
[2:31:28] a hole up there like the the tube still
[2:31:31] there it's still it's still exhausting
[2:31:35] out from the house so I didn't think
[2:31:38] nothing of it time went on I would see
[2:31:42] it I'd be outside I'd look up kind of
[2:31:44] looks ugly I probably should fix that
[2:31:47] sometime and then I go get busy doing
[2:31:50] something else completely forget about
[2:31:51] it some time went by and we had went off
[2:31:54] on on um well before before that um some
[2:31:57] time went by and and one day we I get a
[2:32:00] phone call from My Wife and she's
[2:32:03] like I hear something when I'm in the
[2:32:06] restroom I I hear some
[2:32:09] noise and um I was
[2:32:12] like why she said it sounds like it's
[2:32:14] coming from the ceiling area and um I
[2:32:18] said well
[2:32:20] well what what it could be I mean and
[2:32:22] then um the next day I get I think the
[2:32:26] next day or two I get a phone call she
[2:32:28] said I hear birds I hear like a bird
[2:32:32] chirping when I'm I'm in in our bathroom
[2:32:35] I'm
[2:32:37] like how are you hearing birds chirping
[2:32:40] in our
[2:32:44] bathroom so you know I'm going through
[2:32:46] my day and I'm
[2:32:48] like you know what
[2:32:50] that vent is gone I wonder if a bird has
[2:32:55] gotten up inside that and created a
[2:32:59] nest well they
[2:33:01] had and I was like well that's kind of
[2:33:04] neat you
[2:33:07] know neat to have hear the birds
[2:33:10] chirping and I'm like I really should
[2:33:13] get up there but I hate to
[2:33:15] disturb their
[2:33:17] nest I'm like I really need to get up
[2:33:20] there and take care of
[2:33:22] that but I
[2:33:24] didn't and um time went
[2:33:27] on and um we had went off this months
[2:33:32] later I was not taking care of my temple
[2:33:35] that's what I'm trying to get
[2:33:37] at so I I we'd went off on vacation and
[2:33:40] we we came back we've been gone for
[2:33:43] about a week or so we come back in and
[2:33:46] um you know if you've been on a long
[2:33:48] drive one of the first things that you
[2:33:50] typically need to do is is use the
[2:33:52] facilities whenever you get home and um
[2:33:56] so you go into the master restroom and
[2:34:00] um realize that
[2:34:03] there's looked like somebody had went in
[2:34:06] while we were gone and took black pepper
[2:34:09] and shook black pepper out over top of
[2:34:11] the toilet area and the floor and I'm
[2:34:14] like what in the
[2:34:17] world is this so I go get a bright
[2:34:23] flashlight and I go in there and I shine
[2:34:26] this
[2:34:27] flashlight really
[2:34:29] bright and it's
[2:34:31] like that's not black
[2:34:34] pepper looks like some type of
[2:34:37] bug so I have a friend of mine who is an
[2:34:40] exterminator I give him a call and I
[2:34:41] describe to him he said you've got bird

[3:31:35] together like
[3:31:37] this and be just saturated in his
[3:31:41] presence do you know how many places
[3:31:43] people would be afraid of the Deacons
[3:31:47] no you don't you don't have a clue some
[3:31:48] of you don't have an
[3:31:50] idea there are many people sitting in
[3:31:53] here this is only church you've ever
[3:31:55] known but I want you to know there are
[3:31:57] other places out there we are blessed
[3:32:00] tonight it has nothing to do with any of
[3:32:03] us but we're blessed
[3:32:05] tonight we'd have been dismissed a long
[3:32:08] time ago in a lot of places but it's
[3:32:11] just one I just trust the Holy Ghost I
[3:32:14] always have
[3:32:16] from the first visitation from the first
[3:32:19] time the spirit of the Lord met me at 18
[3:32:21] months old I've trusted him I just know
[3:32:25] that he knows and you know what else I
[3:32:27] trust his
[3:32:29] people I just believe that in an
[3:32:32] atmosphere like this we become
[3:32:35] ministers those of us who have no
[3:32:37] preaching calling we become
[3:32:40] ministers sisters become ministers can
[3:32:43] you imagine that
[3:32:46] that God would flow through a beautiful
[3:32:50] woman of God strengthen the faith of
[3:32:54] another beautiful woman of God it is in
[3:32:57] order in this
[3:32:59] house and it's so precious to him I'm so
[3:33:04] brother I'm so
[3:33:07] thankful I got
[3:33:09] it how many of you got
[3:33:14] it I actually got it in the first uh few
[3:33:20] minutes but the spirit of the Lord just
[3:33:22] wasn't
[3:33:23] done some of us are hard hard we we've
[3:33:26] never been fast
[3:33:27] Learners and so brother has preached it
[3:33:30] tonight the enough scripture to back up
[3:33:33] everything he said enough visual to see
[3:33:37] it and then the presence of God come and
[3:33:40] say Amen by my melting hearts and
[3:33:43] touching
[3:33:44] lives filling and
[3:33:46] refilling brother brandham said there's
[3:33:49] one baptism of the Holy Ghost one
[3:33:52] filling but many
[3:33:57] refilling we ought to have three or four
[3:33:59] a
[3:34:00] [Music]
