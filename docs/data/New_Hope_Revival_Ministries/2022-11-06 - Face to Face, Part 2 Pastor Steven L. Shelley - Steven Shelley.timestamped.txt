[39:42] we want to remember Sister Annie
[39:43] barcliffe today she's been battling
[39:46] sickness some of this stuff that's been
[39:48] going around and out of work for several
[39:51] days and she requested that we would
[39:52] pray for her
[39:54] Elisha is either still sick or sick
[39:57] again he has a fever we want to hold
[40:00] hold him up to the Lord in prayer that
[40:03] God will undertake for him yes Lord I
[40:06] have a friend
[40:08] who's a pastor
[40:09] who has the most unusual
[40:12] circumstances going on in his church
[40:15] right now and I promise that I wouldn't
[40:18] tell it out but they've got to have a
[40:22] breakthrough they've got to have a
[40:23] miracle and it has become legal and
[40:28] such a battle it's really witchcraft
[40:31] yeah yeah I want the Lord to do
[40:33] something yes Lord
[40:35] seems like the more we've prayed this
[40:37] week the worse it gets which is so
[40:40] understandable to me
[40:42] because the enemy is losing his hold yes
[40:45] I want to believe that God will give
[40:48] them the victory that they so deserve
[40:50] and need and would you pray for every
[40:53] person that was touched in the meetings
[40:54] in North Carolina last weekend we've had
[40:57] beautiful testimonies thank you Lord one
[41:01] from a from a dear sister who had
[41:04] carried something 35 years her feet
[41:08] crippled by it spiritually and in the
[41:11] service No Hands even laid on her just
[41:14] by the word going forth she has
[41:16] testified to several all week that it
[41:19] was gone it has Hallelujah never to
[41:22] harass her anymore
[41:24] pray for each one of those that God will
[41:26] continue to to move in their lives and

[56:19] in the Precious Blood of the land
[56:26] giving praise
[56:29] all the blood
[56:33] thank you
[56:35] thank you wonderful Jesus for your blood
[56:39] you may be seated this morning it's
[56:42] wonderful to be in the house of God
[56:45] it's wonderful to feel his presence
[56:48] and to know that he is here
[56:50] and uh we're just thankful to be home
[56:53] and to be safe and we got home and we
[56:57] streamed the service here Tuesday night
[56:59] on our way and we were very blessed I
[57:02] haven't gone back to see Sunday service
[57:04] yet I caught a little of it but I'm
[57:06] looking forward to it I know it was also
[57:08] a blessing Tuesday night was outstanding
[57:12] it wasn't just an ordinary Tuesday night
[57:14] service but you were hearing from the
[57:17] Lord it was really really timely and uh
[57:21] we're thanking God for that so if you
[57:24] didn't get a chance to hear it it's on
[57:25] the app and it's in your hand it's in
[57:28] your purse it's in your pocket wherever
[57:30] you carry your phone around your neck or
[57:32] whatever you do I think some people
[57:35] don't carry their phones I think some
[57:37] people don't ever look at their phones
[57:40] I don't in fact know why some people
[57:42] have phones
[57:44] do you
[57:45] it's certainly not so that we can get in
[57:47] touch with them I can tell you that
[57:49] right now
[57:50] on occasion I do lay mine down uh it's
[57:54] important to do that from time to time
[57:56] so your hand doesn't grow like that
[57:58] but I try to get back to him as quickly
[58:01] as I can I check my phone three times at
[58:04] least three times a night in the middle
[58:06] of the night to make sure that someone
[58:08] has not reached out in need and if
[58:11] someone says pray for me I do
[58:13] I do it's important that we carry one
[58:17] another in hours like we're living in
[58:19] right now this is a critical hour
[58:22] and we're facing some things and we need
[58:25] to be in prayer for the election maybe
[58:27] you feel like Alabama's not that
[58:30] important and you're right in the fact
[58:31] that we are not by any means a swing
[58:34] state but uh most of our election is
[58:37] pretty pretty secure but uh our nation
[58:40] we need God to move
[58:43] and I don't have any candidates to
[58:46] endorse all I know is what the Holy
[58:48] Ghost said he spoke clearly to my heart
[58:51] some years ago and he said if you're
[58:53] going to vote vote for the things that
[58:56] are closer to the heart of God
[58:58] so I said well what are those things and
[59:01] he spoke to me concerning the sanctity
[59:03] of life that's to protect The Unborn in
[59:06] the womb he spoke to me about the
[59:09] sanctity of marriage that's marriage
[59:11] between one man and one woman for life
[59:15] and then he spoke to me about a love for
[59:18] Israel and God loves Israel I want you
[59:21] to know he loves Israel he loves the
[59:23] Jewish people and it's important that we
[59:26] align ourselves with those principles is
[59:29] that all that matters no
[59:31] there are other things that matter but
[59:34] God said if you're voting you're going
[59:36] to vote vote for the things that are
[59:38] nearer and dearer to my heart so that's
[59:40] what the rest we leave in God's hands
[59:42] and if you are registered to vote then I
[59:46] think you should exercise that right one
[59:48] of the reasons why I feel that it's
[59:50] important and I know there'll be many
[59:52] critics who watch this stream who
[59:54] believe that Christians should have
[59:55] nothing at all to do with politics I
[59:58] think that's quite narrow-minded to be
[1:00:00] honest with you I really do and having
[1:00:03] spent some time in Nations where people
[1:00:05] don't have uh the the freedom to express
[1:00:09] themselves
[1:00:10] then I am so thankful that you and I
[1:00:13] have at least one vote and uh we have a
[1:00:17] whole lot more than that on our knees
[1:00:20] we can shift a lot of things in prayer
[1:00:22] so we want to be praying this week for
[1:00:25] the election uh I want to mention a few
[1:00:28] things too you want to just say how
[1:00:30] wonderful the time together was in North
[1:00:33] Carolina we would have left to have had
[1:00:35] all of you there with us but we were
[1:00:38] thrilled that many were able to come and
[1:00:42] I didn't do a lot of recruiting Because
[1:00:45] I have a burden for what's happening
[1:00:48] here and I wanted the service here to be
[1:00:50] blessed but everyone who went was a
[1:00:53] special blessing to me and as a pastor
[1:00:56] it's a wonderful feeling to look out and
[1:00:58] see familiar faces your own folks amen
[1:01:01] and smiling and pulling and they were
[1:01:04] used sister Anita was greatly used to
[1:01:06] sing in every service that she was there
[1:01:09] and God ministered and he moved and for
[1:01:13] me it was like a family reunion and I
[1:01:16] and I can't even tell you how I got so
[1:01:19] overwhelmed when I when I got there to
[1:01:22] the church I got so overwhelmed I had to
[1:01:24] go hide in the office because my
[1:01:26] emotions got so excited and so stirred
[1:01:29] to see people that I hadn't seen some in
[1:01:32] in 30 years some in 20 25 years uh
[1:01:37] particularly you all know that in in
[1:01:40] Holiness when I was many years ago in
[1:01:43] the Holiness movement
[1:01:44] there was a couple who meant a lot to me
[1:01:47] Jeff and Amanda rooksager and I had no
[1:01:51] idea that she even knew the meetings
[1:01:53] existed much less that she was going to
[1:01:55] be there the first night and when she
[1:01:58] got out of the of the car it was a real
[1:02:01] surprise and so many more and we
[1:02:04] appreciated it and of course Sister
[1:02:07] Evelyn was so faithful and and we
[1:02:09] appreciated that as well we had a couple
[1:02:12] uh what what are the names of the young
[1:02:14] couple from Indiana
[1:02:15] Lavina Levina and David and Levina uh so
[1:02:22] our one of our Couples from the former
[1:02:25] Amish group they came and were with us
[1:02:27] and uh even brother brother Daniels
[1:02:31] longtime friend uh Lisa and her husband
[1:02:35] and family were there and God was there
[1:02:38] most of all his presence was real
[1:02:42] they're hungry people everywhere uh
[1:02:45] tired of church ready to experience God
[1:02:49] when they come together like you've had
[1:02:51] the privilege of experiencing him here
[1:02:53] this morning that's him
[1:02:55] he was moving among us we have so much
[1:02:59] to be thankful for and then uh tomorrow
[1:03:02] is the birthday of a friend of mine I
[1:03:05] have not mentioned him too much we are
[1:03:07] Facebook friends but we've had
[1:03:10] communication together his name is
[1:03:12] brother Eric Arnold he's in France
[1:03:15] serving the lord with his wife and
[1:03:17] children there and I was so blessed on
[1:03:21] Friday night an elderly couple came up
[1:03:23] after the service and introduced
[1:03:25] themselves to me as his parents who live
[1:03:29] not too far from the church so it was
[1:03:32] really wonderful his mother said to me I
[1:03:35] don't quite understand the connection
[1:03:36] between you and Eric but she said I'm
[1:03:39] just so glad that we got to be here and
[1:03:41] I think we were probably a little more
[1:03:44] traditional than than maybe what they
[1:03:47] would be used to but they were so
[1:03:49] supportive and came back the next night
[1:03:52] and uh Eric when you hear this uh Monday
[1:03:56] November the 7th is your birthday so I'm
[1:03:59] going to wish you a happy birthday since
[1:04:01] I'm talking about your precious parents
[1:04:03] uh and then Friday of this coming week
[1:04:06] is a day that we have celebrated around
[1:04:09] here a long time because so many so many
[1:04:12] people celebrated special days on
[1:04:15] Veterans Day November the 11th that was
[1:04:17] brother tremaine's birthday that was the
[1:04:20] tremaine's wedding anniversary which
[1:04:22] would be over way over 70 years now that
[1:04:25] they would have been married sister
[1:04:26] Hoyer turns 102.
[1:04:30] on Friday 102.
[1:04:35] that's getting on up there
[1:04:37] and we send our love to them she is
[1:04:40] certainly not as healthy as she has been
[1:04:42] in most of her life but uh there is some
[1:04:46] reason why the Lord has left her here
[1:04:48] brother Hoyer left us many years ago so
[1:04:52] let's pray for sister Hoyer this week
[1:04:54] that God's perfect will be done in her
[1:04:56] body and her life and then Amelia where
[1:04:59] is Millie uh hold up your hands so
[1:05:02] everybody can see you she has a birthday
[1:05:05] she's definitely not going to turn 102.
[1:05:09] how old is Amelia going to be
[1:05:12] seven
[1:05:13] that's a great age
[1:05:15] and uh God bless and happy birthday to
[1:05:19] Millie
[1:05:24] and Jonathan Hollis who was here during
[1:05:27] our camp meeting who means so much to us
[1:05:29] his birthday is on Friday as well on
[1:05:32] Veterans Day so if you get a chance to
[1:05:34] greet him on social media do that he
[1:05:37] texted last night to say that he was
[1:05:40] invited by Brother Elam Fisher to come
[1:05:43] up and and go to service with them it's
[1:05:45] about an hour and a half from where
[1:05:46] Jonathan lives and he'll be back down
[1:05:49] here in a few weeks to be with us so he
[1:05:51] was going to go to church with them

[1:16:49] you you don't have to wait till until
[1:16:51] the third Thursday of the month
[1:16:54] to be thankful
[1:16:56] we've got to be living this life of
[1:16:59] thanks living instead of just
[1:17:01] Thanksgiving right it's a life
[1:17:03] and we have so much to be thankful for
[1:17:06] let's go to the word Exodus 33 and 10
[1:17:10] and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar
[1:17:14] stand at the Tabernacle door and all the
[1:17:17] people rose up and worshiped every man
[1:17:22] in his tent door and the Lord spake unto
[1:17:26] Moses face to face as a man speaketh
[1:17:30] unto his friend and he turned again into
[1:17:34] the camp but his servant Joshua the son
[1:17:37] of noon a young man departed not out of
[1:17:42] the Tabernacle
[1:17:44] verse 12 and Moses said unto the Lord
[1:17:47] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[1:17:50] people and thou Hast not let me know
[1:17:53] whom thou Wilt sin with me yet thou Hast
[1:17:58] said I Know Thee by name
[1:18:01] and thou has also found Grace in my
[1:18:05] sight now therefore I pray thee if I
[1:18:10] have found Grace in thy sight show me
[1:18:14] now thy way
[1:18:17] that I may Know Thee
[1:18:21] that I may find Grace in thy sight
[1:18:25] and consider that this nation is thy
[1:18:29] people
[1:18:32] and he said
[1:18:34] my presence
[1:18:37] shall go with thee
[1:18:39] and I will do what
[1:18:43] I will give thee rest Moses is waiting
[1:18:47] on the name
[1:18:50] of a companion
[1:18:52] who will go with him
[1:18:54] leading the children of Israel forward
[1:18:57] he said you say you know my name
[1:19:00] and yet you have not revealed to me yet
[1:19:02] who will go with me
[1:19:04] and this was God's answer
[1:19:06] my presence
[1:19:09] shall go with thee
[1:19:11] and wherever the presence of God is the
[1:19:13] person
[1:19:14] of God shows up
[1:19:17] I will go with thee my presence shall go
[1:19:20] with thee and I will give thee rest
[1:19:23] and listen to what Moses said
[1:19:26] and he said unto him next verse
[1:19:30] excuse me and he said unto him If thy
[1:19:33] presence go not with me
[1:19:36] carry us not up hence
[1:19:40] before you're seated I want to call your
[1:19:43] attention to verse 13.
[1:19:47] again
[1:19:49] now therefore I pray thee
[1:19:52] if I have found Grace in thy sight
[1:19:55] show me now
[1:19:58] thy way
[1:20:01] that I may Know Thee
[1:20:04] that I may find Grace in thy sight
[1:20:08] and consider that this nation is thy
[1:20:10] people may God add his Blessing to the
[1:20:12] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:20:14] today
[1:20:18] show me now thy way
[1:20:21] that I may
[1:20:24] Know Thee I want to say to you body of
[1:20:27] Christ
[1:20:28] that it is not enough to know the will
[1:20:31] of God
[1:20:33] we want to know the will of God without
[1:20:36] knowing the will of God we wonder
[1:20:39] aimlessly
[1:20:40] directionless
[1:20:42] we we have a tendency to go in circles
[1:20:44] in fact
[1:20:46] because we don't like to go too far
[1:20:48] beyond our comfort zone
[1:20:51] you want to help me
[1:20:52] we we like to stay in our familiar
[1:20:55] circumstances so sometimes like Johnny
[1:20:58] Crowe
[1:20:59] we just go in circles
[1:21:02] or or like the 12-foot Shuffle we just
[1:21:06] go back and forth and back and forth and
[1:21:07] back and forth and if someone says
[1:21:09] something to it without moving I'm
[1:21:11] moving
[1:21:11] I'm moving I'm moving yeah yeah you're
[1:21:15] moving
[1:21:16] you're not stationary but you're not
[1:21:19] going anywhere either you're moving
[1:21:22] but you're not going anywhere
[1:21:24] you're just going back and forth perhaps
[1:21:27] circling around your comfort zone so I
[1:21:31] want to say to the church today it's not
[1:21:34] enough to know the will of God I think
[1:21:36] that sometimes our attitude is the
[1:21:39] highest
[1:21:41] is to know the will of God
[1:21:43] if I can know God's will for my life
[1:21:46] then I have really achieved something
[1:21:49] well I want you to know that until we
[1:21:51] know the way of God
[1:21:53] and until we are able to understand the
[1:21:56] ways of God it does us very little good
[1:21:59] to know the will of God
[1:22:01] because you can know the will of God and
[1:22:04] not understand the ways of God and Miss
[1:22:07] what you know
[1:22:08] you may know that it is God's will for
[1:22:11] you to go to a particular place but if
[1:22:14] you don't know the way of God
[1:22:16] you won't know how to get there in God's
[1:22:18] will
[1:22:19] you understand and and how do we learn
[1:22:23] the way of God how do we learn the ways
[1:22:25] of God
[1:22:26] we look to the word
[1:22:28] if we want to know where God is we look
[1:22:31] to the word if we want to know where God
[1:22:34] has been
[1:22:35] we look to the word if we want to know
[1:22:38] where God is going
[1:22:41] we look to the word so that old dusty
[1:22:44] Bible sitting on the coffee table in
[1:22:46] your house it's time now to use it for
[1:22:50] more than a decoration
[1:22:52] it's time now to use it as a road map
[1:22:57] because God's holy word and printed form
[1:22:59] has been preserved for us as a road map
[1:23:04] it not only reveals to us the answer to
[1:23:07] every question in life
[1:23:09] it not only reveals to us the will of
[1:23:13] God for our lives but it also reveals
[1:23:16] the way of God
[1:23:17] Moses said I want to know your way
[1:23:23] that I may know you
[1:23:26] you see it's not enough to know what God
[1:23:28] has done
[1:23:30] you've got to examine what he's done to
[1:23:33] begin to try to discover his heart
[1:23:36] you may not always always know the wise
[1:23:40] but the more you learn about the way of
[1:23:43] God
[1:23:43] the way that God moves the way that God
[1:23:46] thinks the way that God functions the
[1:23:49] more you learn about the way of God the
[1:23:53] easier it becomes
[1:23:55] to get you into the will of God because
[1:23:58] you're not walking around with hobnailed
[1:24:01] shoes like fools
[1:24:04] Where Angels Fear to trod one of the
[1:24:08] things we need to discover about the way
[1:24:11] of God is how to reverence him
[1:24:16] we've got to discover how to reverence
[1:24:18] God
[1:24:21] you know the prophet tells us how to to
[1:24:24] understand how to reverence God
[1:24:28] he gives us a road map he said you've
[1:24:31] got to learn to reverence the men of God
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:36] I'm not preaching about me I'm preaching
[1:24:38] about you
[1:24:39] because I consider this room to be
[1:24:42] filled
[1:24:43] with men and women of God
[1:24:46] the word the phrase man of God is not
[1:24:49] just the pulpit
[1:24:51] it's the Servants of Jesus Christ if we
[1:24:55] are serving him we are men and women of
[1:24:57] God and we must learn to to honor one
[1:25:01] another
[1:25:02] so that we can learn to reverence God if
[1:25:06] you can't honor the one that God sins
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] then you'll miss God altogether
[1:25:14] yes I'm not preaching on on respecting
[1:25:18] your pastor
[1:25:20] it's a good message it ought to be
[1:25:22] preached from time to time I'm talking
[1:25:25] about learning to honor and respect one
[1:25:26] another
[1:25:28] you see I don't want you to be beholden
[1:25:30] to one another
[1:25:34] I don't want you to be obligated to one
[1:25:36] another
[1:25:37] I want you to learn to walk with each
[1:25:40] other on the same course
[1:25:42] because you've understood the will of
[1:25:45] God and you're discovering the way of
[1:25:47] God
[1:25:48] I'll tell you God's way is not like
[1:25:50] man's way
[1:25:53] you know God just gives and gives and
[1:25:55] gives and gives and gives and gives
[1:25:57] and he never makes us feel guilty
[1:26:03] for what he's given to us
[1:26:05] have you ever had God hold anything over
[1:26:07] your head that he did for you
[1:26:12] I wonder how many times God has watched
[1:26:15] you and I walk away from his Blessing
[1:26:18] to go do our own thing
[1:26:20] could have snatched us back I wish
[1:26:23] somebody would help me preach today I'm
[1:26:25] going to preach anyway
[1:26:27] but I wish you'd help me a little bit
[1:26:28] let's share the labor
[1:26:31] isn't that a good way to do it let's
[1:26:33] cooperate God could have snatched us
[1:26:36] back he could have took the sucker right
[1:26:39] out of her hand
[1:26:41] he's the one that put it in there he
[1:26:43] could have took the lollipop back
[1:26:45] he could have said you no longer deserve
[1:26:47] that but how many of you know God that's
[1:26:49] just not who God is
[1:26:52] God doesn't want you walking with him
[1:26:55] because you feel obligated walking with
[1:26:57] him
[1:26:58] he wants you moving with him because you
[1:27:00] love him
[1:27:02] and because you wouldn't dare walk with
[1:27:04] anybody else
[1:27:05] come on
[1:27:10] this is not you'll learn to love him
[1:27:13] you know they used to say that in the
[1:27:15] early days of fixed marriages
[1:27:17] and I honestly believe some of you would
[1:27:19] be very well off in good shape to let me
[1:27:22] fix yours
[1:27:29] because some folks ain't doing so good
[1:27:31] by themselves
[1:27:33] they need a little help picking
[1:27:36] you'll get a rotten fish to start with
[1:27:38] you're going to end up with a rotten
[1:27:40] fish
[1:27:41] you better get the right one to start
[1:27:42] with
[1:27:43] you better start with the right one so
[1:27:45] you can finish up with the right one
[1:27:49] you know some old boy will make you
[1:27:50] think he's the only one there is
[1:27:53] some gal will make you think she's the
[1:27:55] only chance you got
[1:27:58] the fish God's Great Big ocean is full
[1:28:01] of fish
[1:28:02] you don't need but one
[1:28:05] and that's not the one you want that's
[1:28:06] the one God wants for you
[1:28:09] and once you know that
[1:28:12] let me just ask you this get my little
[1:28:14] something in here now
[1:28:16] once you know that what else you need to
[1:28:19] know
[1:28:20] um
[1:28:21] well we're getting to know each other
[1:28:24] once you've already discovered God's
[1:28:26] will
[1:28:29] then you're just trying to discover his
[1:28:31] timing
[1:28:34] because the more you know about somebody
[1:28:35] the more you maybe talked right out of
[1:28:38] it
[1:28:42] sometimes it takes some rough Edge
[1:28:44] knocking around to get us where we can
[1:28:47] howl getting two walk together
[1:28:50] except they be agreed
[1:28:52] I want you to know I wouldn't begin to
[1:28:54] consider someone that didn't have the
[1:28:56] faith that I have
[1:28:57] I wouldn't begin to consider someone in
[1:28:59] this hour that didn't believe the
[1:29:01] message of the hour
[1:29:02] and able to recognize the servant that
[1:29:04] God sent in this day because the one
[1:29:07] thing I know about this message is the
[1:29:09] prophet tells us that the bride will
[1:29:12] know the message
[1:29:14] for her day and in one place he said
[1:29:16] that's part of the proof that she has
[1:29:18] received the Holy Ghost now I know we
[1:29:21] all have to come in contact with it
[1:29:24] that's the grace of God to us we have to
[1:29:27] come in contact with it and we don't all
[1:29:29] come in early and we don't all hear it
[1:29:31] early
[1:29:32] but it's important that we hear it
[1:29:35] and if you think God is Raising you up
[1:29:37] to correct that message
[1:29:43] you are way too late
[1:29:46] producing nothing
[1:29:48] that compares with that
[1:29:50] you see God has given us a great
[1:29:52] understanding of his word is that all
[1:29:56] truth no
[1:29:58] there's some truth that's not there
[1:30:03] what do you mean by that that that's
[1:30:05] what he said I'm just telling you what
[1:30:07] he said
[1:30:08] you see there's truth out there that we
[1:30:10] may not have yet come into in our life
[1:30:12] it's there it's Lee's in the message in
[1:30:15] seed form it lays in the word in seed
[1:30:17] form we just have to come to the place
[1:30:19] in our life where we can receive it
[1:30:22] and if somebody has a hungry and a
[1:30:25] sincere heart before God God desires to
[1:30:28] reveal to them the truth
[1:30:31] and the truth is not to take us back
[1:30:33] under the law the truth is to fill us
[1:30:36] with God's grace help us to appreciate
[1:30:39] all the things that get us to this place
[1:30:43] and I believe in memorials
[1:30:46] I believe in memorials
[1:30:48] I believe in memorials
[1:30:50] I believe in giving memorials and
[1:30:52] raising memorials and marking memorials
[1:30:55] I believe in remembering things that God
[1:30:58] has done for us along the way I believe
[1:31:01] in remembering the Feast of Jehovah
[1:31:03] because that helps us to understand how
[1:31:06] he did and why he did what we know he
[1:31:09] has done by coming in word form in in
[1:31:12] flesh form rather the word in flesh form
[1:31:15] and paying a price it's in the typology
[1:31:18] of the older Covenant that we are able
[1:31:21] to see the reality of what the Holy
[1:31:24] Ghost has done for us it was not enough
[1:31:27] for God to be above us I think I said
[1:31:29] this the last time we were together that
[1:31:31] was good but that wasn't enough it
[1:31:33] wasn't even enough for God to be with us
[1:31:36] in Yeshua in Jesus Emmanuel God With Us
[1:31:40] we needed God
[1:31:46] who would want to go back to God above
[1:31:49] who would want to just go back to God
[1:31:51] you know like like we've said here many
[1:31:53] times before people say oh I just wish
[1:31:55] Jesus would walk in that door
[1:31:58] and I'd tell him something or I'd ask
[1:32:00] him something or he would do something
[1:32:01] for me no
[1:32:03] you missed him
[1:32:06] he already walked in that door this
[1:32:08] morning
[1:32:09] sat down on your pew
[1:32:12] he's now living in his people
[1:32:14] brother random told us if Jesus were to
[1:32:16] walk in here in some form and walk up
[1:32:19] and down the aisle he couldn't do
[1:32:21] anything else for you that he hadn't
[1:32:22] already done
[1:32:24] isn't that good to know because the
[1:32:26] responsibility is no longer on him
[1:32:29] it's on you to sit there as the word
[1:32:31] Goes Forth
[1:32:33] and to reach up like that little elderly
[1:32:35] sister did and said hey
[1:32:38] 35 years my feet have been crippled
[1:32:43] because somebody dropped me
[1:32:47] but I hear the wire
[1:32:50] and it's made up my mind for me
[1:32:57] whoa Hallelujah
[1:33:02] that's who God is
[1:33:04] he wants us to hunger not only for his
[1:33:08] hand
[1:33:10] what he will do for us
[1:33:12] but he wants us to be hungry for who he
[1:33:15] is
[1:33:16] and in order to know who he is we have
[1:33:18] to look at his ways
[1:33:21] and we don't just look at what he has
[1:33:23] done we look at what he is doing and we
[1:33:25] look forward to what he is going to do
[1:33:27] Moses was bold I got to hurry because
[1:33:29] this was what we covered the last time
[1:33:31] we were together Moses was very bold he
[1:33:33] had that kind of relationship with God
[1:33:36] Moses told God that he didn't he did not
[1:33:39] know the angel that he wanted to sin to
[1:33:42] lead them
[1:33:43] God said I'm going to send my angel
[1:33:45] before you Moses said that's nice I
[1:33:47] don't know him
[1:33:49] that's pretty bold
[1:33:51] if you don't mind I'd like a little more
[1:33:53] than just the angel to come I'm looking
[1:33:56] for something else Lord you know my name
[1:33:58] and my desire is to know you more
[1:34:01] and I want you to lead the way for us
[1:34:05] and he actually went one step further
[1:34:07] or just leave us where we are
[1:34:11] it's not more about church we need to
[1:34:14] know
[1:34:16] not not more about how to do Church
[1:34:19] that's not what we need
[1:34:21] we need to know more about him
[1:34:24] and when I'm talking about knowing him
[1:34:25] I'm not talking about head knowledge
[1:34:29] I'm talking about lay your head on his
[1:34:31] chest kind of Revelation
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:34] there you discovered his heartbeat there
[1:34:36] you learn his ways anybody with me good
[1:34:40] many years later the Apostle Paul
[1:34:42] expressed the same desire to know him in
[1:34:45] Philippians 3 8-10 in the Amplified and
[1:34:49] yes I read it when we were together but
[1:34:51] I'm going to read it again and I'm going
[1:34:53] to try to read it without a lot of
[1:34:54] comment that's going to be hard
[1:34:56] yes furthermore I count everything as
[1:35:00] loss compared to the possession of the
[1:35:03] Priceless privilege the overwhelming
[1:35:06] preciousness the surpassing worth and
[1:35:10] supreme advantage of knowing Christ
[1:35:13] Jesus my Lord and of this is powerful
[1:35:17] and of progressively becoming
[1:35:22] somebody say progressively
[1:35:25] you don't know all of him today you're
[1:35:27] going to know
[1:35:30] right
[1:35:31] how many of you have served the Lord 50
[1:35:33] years or more hold up your hand
[1:35:40] to know about him
[1:35:42] it's the progression of knowing it's the
[1:35:46] it's the revealing it's the unveiling
[1:35:49] it's the peeling off are you with me
[1:35:52] it's the peeling off of every layer that
[1:35:55] helps us it's watching him and every one
[1:35:58] of a life situations how he moves
[1:36:02] he doesn't always come when we want him
[1:36:06] he doesn't always come the first time we
[1:36:08] call him
[1:36:09] but he hears us
[1:36:11] and he's never late
[1:36:13] he's always right on time I want you to
[1:36:16] consider a time in your life that you
[1:36:18] prayed and you prayed and you prayed and
[1:36:20] it didn't look like God was hearing you
[1:36:22] and then all of a sudden it shifted
[1:36:25] and you were able to look back and say
[1:36:27] hey God was with me all along I wasn't
[1:36:30] by myself he was with me all along this
[1:36:34] is part of the discovery this is part of
[1:36:37] progressively becoming more deeply and
[1:36:40] intimately acquainted with him of
[1:36:44] perceiving and recognizing and
[1:36:48] understanding him more fully and clearly
[1:36:51] for his sake I have lost everything and
[1:36:55] consider it all to be mere rubbish
[1:36:56] refuse drags in order that I may win
[1:37:00] gain Christ the anointed one and I and
[1:37:04] that I may actually be found and known
[1:37:08] as in him
[1:37:11] to be found
[1:37:14] in him
[1:37:16] you want to know where I where I'm
[1:37:18] hiding I want to hide in him
[1:37:21] if you miss me I want you to be able to
[1:37:24] find me in him
[1:37:26] it's powerful
[1:37:28] not having any self-achieved
[1:37:30] righteousness that can be called my own
[1:37:33] based on my obedience to the Law's
[1:37:35] demands ritualistic uprightness and
[1:37:38] supposed right standing with God thus
[1:37:41] acquired
[1:37:42] but processing excuse me but possessing
[1:37:46] that genuine righteousness which comes
[1:37:50] through faith in Christ the anointed one
[1:37:54] the truly right standing with God which
[1:37:57] comes from God by what
[1:38:01] by Saving faith for my determined
[1:38:04] purpose is
[1:38:06] that I may know him
[1:38:10] that I may become progressively more
[1:38:12] deeply and intimately acquainted with
[1:38:15] him
[1:38:16] perceiving and recognizing and
[1:38:18] understanding the wonders of his person
[1:38:21] more strongly and more clearly and that
[1:38:23] I may in that same way come to know the
[1:38:26] power
[1:38:27] outflowing from his what
[1:38:31] from his resurrection which it exerts
[1:38:34] over Believers and that I may so share
[1:38:36] his sufferings as to be continually
[1:38:39] transformed in spirit into his likeness
[1:38:42] even to his death in The Hope in the
[1:38:46] hope now traditionally the church
[1:38:50] has looked at this fellowshipping with
[1:38:54] his suffering
[1:38:55] as though we must suffer
[1:38:58] to be like him
[1:39:01] and suffering is a part of this life
[1:39:05] we're going to suffer our character is
[1:39:08] being honed we are being shaped to him
[1:39:12] but I want you to know that your
[1:39:14] suffering is not even Worthy
[1:39:18] to begin to be compared with his
[1:39:22] so I heard people casually saying things
[1:39:25] that aren't really biblical in Doctrine
[1:39:27] or at least an understanding of the word
[1:39:29] you know oh I'm just suffering I'm just
[1:39:31] suffering for Jesus I'm just under so
[1:39:34] much persecution uh God is really having
[1:39:37] to do all this you know and and I'm just
[1:39:41] hurting like he heard and and going
[1:39:43] through so much so that one day I can be
[1:39:46] what I'm supposed to be folks I want you
[1:39:50] to know that suffering alone and
[1:39:53] hardship alone and sickness alone and
[1:39:56] grief alone won't make you like him
[1:40:01] it's only when you begin to understand
[1:40:04] that when he suffered
[1:40:08] when he suffered
[1:40:10] you were in him
[1:40:13] you came here by Grace having already
[1:40:17] experienced
[1:40:19] the reality
[1:40:22] of suffering with Christ
[1:40:24] before you ever went through a trouble
[1:40:26] before you ever had a problem help me
[1:40:30] now before you ever had loss or grieve
[1:40:33] for a bad marriage or whatever it was
[1:40:36] you had already experienced something
[1:40:40] in a greater dimension
[1:40:42] than the one you're now walking in
[1:40:45] because the Bible says that when he
[1:40:47] suffered we suffered not only with him
[1:40:52] we suffered
[1:40:54] in him
[1:40:58] and when he died
[1:41:01] we were in him
[1:41:04] that's what the word says this is New
[1:41:06] Testament now
[1:41:07] oh yes it's the book it's the book
[1:41:10] and when we died in him when he died we
[1:41:14] died in him
[1:41:18] so I've already suffered with Christ
[1:41:21] I may have some more hardships down here
[1:41:24] but you can't judge a man by his
[1:41:26] hardship
[1:41:28] because hardship can make you bitter
[1:41:30] understanding your fellowship with his
[1:41:33] suffering can make you better
[1:41:35] understanding that you've never suffered
[1:41:38] alone
[1:41:39] anything you've suffered you suffered
[1:41:41] connected to Christ
[1:41:43] you were fellowshipping with him in his
[1:41:45] suffering and therefore everything he
[1:41:48] obtained
[1:41:51] is my inheritance
[1:41:53] anybody with me
[1:41:59] that's why if somebody gets a little
[1:42:01] something wrong along the way they're
[1:42:04] not lost
[1:42:09] because they already died in Christ
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:12] and the Holy Spirit is among us to pull
[1:42:15] us back
[1:42:16] to say wait a minute you've got to
[1:42:18] correct your course that's not how
[1:42:19] Christian that's not how a child of God
[1:42:21] lives
[1:42:23] that's not how a child of God speaks
[1:42:25] that's not how a child of God treats one
[1:42:27] another
[1:42:28] you see I came to a place in my life one
[1:42:31] time where I greatly resented my
[1:42:33] mother's dependence
[1:42:35] on me
[1:42:37] I know it sounds awful
[1:42:40] I know it sounds terrible
[1:42:42] but it's my testimony
[1:42:45] you can't take it away from me
[1:42:47] I won't try to change your testimony
[1:42:51] but everybody likes to be appreciated
[1:42:58] you know because of that I taught my
[1:43:01] children something
[1:43:02] because of this struggle that I had for
[1:43:06] years
[1:43:07] with feeling like my own mother was
[1:43:09] taking advantage of me in life I'll
[1:43:12] explain it in a minute I see some of you
[1:43:14] already looking at me like I'm you know
[1:43:16] the worst of the worst
[1:43:19] that's all right
[1:43:22] we've all got our stuff
[1:43:26] just the best with me
[1:43:29] we've all got our stuff
[1:43:31] and the truth of Truth
[1:43:34] so but because of that I taught my
[1:43:36] children to thank to be thankful
[1:43:40] and when they get up from the table I
[1:43:42] taught them to say thank you
[1:43:46] my obligation it's my obligation while
[1:43:49] they're little and in our home to
[1:43:50] provide a meal
[1:43:52] but we didn't just give them grub
[1:43:55] we tried to give them what they wanted
[1:43:58] we tried to give them something nice
[1:43:59] when we had when we had steak
[1:44:03] they had steak or we didn't have steak
[1:44:07] it's real simple you don't have to live
[1:44:10] by that
[1:44:11] there was never a time that I could
[1:44:13] afford a steak for my wife and I but
[1:44:16] wouldn't wouldn't buy it for the
[1:44:17] children
[1:44:19] if if we couldn't afford it we all ate
[1:44:21] hamburger right see but if they got it
[1:44:24] whatever they got I wanted them to be
[1:44:26] thankful
[1:44:27] and I wanted them to express it I know
[1:44:29] it's not only in words
[1:44:31] my wife thanks me
[1:44:34] I didn't make her
[1:44:36] but my wife because it's been the
[1:44:38] atmosphere of our home my wife says
[1:44:41] thank you for dinner honey if we're out
[1:44:43] to eat
[1:44:44] she's my wife
[1:44:47] I'm not gonna let her starve
[1:44:49] I want her to eat well but it really
[1:44:53] means something to me
[1:44:56] when my wife says thank you for dinner
[1:45:00] it means because everybody wants to be
[1:45:05] appreciated
[1:45:07] I loved doing for my mother because she
[1:45:10] went without
[1:45:12] and she suffered
[1:45:14] on my behalf
[1:45:16] and I told you those stories
[1:45:19] she I I went to a yuppie school and I
[1:45:24] didn't have what a lot of other kids in
[1:45:27] my school had but my mother wanted to
[1:45:30] make sure that I had something to
[1:45:33] represent
[1:45:34] what was going on and so I may not have
[1:45:38] had two shirts with an alligator on it
[1:45:44] but I was going to have one
[1:45:47] my mama was going to make sure
[1:45:50] I know some of you think that's just
[1:45:52] silliness
[1:45:53] but my mother was going to make sure all
[1:45:57] my classmates had one for every day
[1:46:00] but I was going to have at least one
[1:46:03] and when the swoosh come
[1:46:06] foreign
[1:46:09] see all you folks running around
[1:46:11] thinking the swoosh is new
[1:46:15] it's old
[1:46:17] we was wearing Nike
[1:46:21] before you was born
[1:46:26] and I may have had schoolmates that had
[1:46:28] a pair of every color
[1:46:31] and I didn't and I didn't feel bad but
[1:46:35] my mama was going to make sure
[1:46:37] that she did without
[1:46:41] so that I could have one pair
[1:46:43] and so I I enjoyed
[1:46:46] in life being able to give my mother
[1:46:49] things that she would not be able to
[1:46:51] afford
[1:46:52] and my mother from the time I married
[1:46:55] well wait no way before then
[1:46:57] from the time I pastored at 17. from 17
[1:47:01] on my mother never had to pay a utility
[1:47:04] bill
[1:47:04] from the time I was 17 forward my mother
[1:47:08] never had to pay her own utility bill I
[1:47:10] paid them for her and I did it with joy
[1:47:14] and I enjoyed doing it until I didn't
[1:47:20] one day thank you brother somebody
[1:47:22] understands me one day
[1:47:25] a little bitterness got in my heart
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:33] a little bitterness got my heart
[1:47:37] my mother had a lot of shoes and she had
[1:47:40] a lot of nice clothes and she had a lot
[1:47:43] of nice things and she spent a lot of
[1:47:45] money on nice things and she was able to
[1:47:47] do that because I was paying her bills
[1:47:50] and I was thankful to do it my mama was
[1:47:53] still working by the way
[1:47:55] for most of that time
[1:47:58] until I didn't
[1:48:00] something got in my heart
[1:48:03] I don't know where it started
[1:48:06] I don't know how I let it get there
[1:48:09] because I'm being one thousand percent
[1:48:11] sincere when I tell you it was a real
[1:48:13] joy and pleasure to do it many many many
[1:48:15] many many many times until one day it
[1:48:18] wasn't
[1:48:19] and I hated the way I felt
[1:48:23] I was ashamed of the way I felt
[1:48:26] I was ashamed for anybody to know how I
[1:48:29] felt
[1:48:30] and I just prayed Lord help me I don't
[1:48:33] want to have that in my heart I want to
[1:48:36] I want to continue to have joy and and
[1:48:40] to be thankful that you have let me have
[1:48:42] my mother and to help give her back some
[1:48:45] of the things that she provided for me
[1:48:47] so I struggled and I prayed and I
[1:48:50] struggled and I prayed and I struggled
[1:48:52] and I prayed and I kept it pushed down
[1:48:54] until one day
[1:48:59] a Sunday morning
[1:49:01] it tried to overwhelm me
[1:49:05] I don't remember the circumstances of
[1:49:07] why but we were having communion that
[1:49:10] night
[1:49:15] and I knew that that bitterness in my
[1:49:17] heart and that deep resentment in my
[1:49:19] heart well were you pastoring of course
[1:49:21] I was pastoring I've been doing that
[1:49:24] since I was 17.
[1:49:25] were you still preach of course I was
[1:49:28] preaching I wish we lived in a world
[1:49:30] that if I didn't feel like doing it I
[1:49:32] didn't have to do it
[1:49:36] but once you accept the responsibility
[1:49:38] you don't get to check out because you
[1:49:40] don't feel Worthy
[1:49:43] or because you don't feel like doing it
[1:49:46] or feel like coming
[1:49:48] you just you just have to do it you you
[1:49:51] just make up your mind and you do it so
[1:49:53] I couldn't I couldn't res step aside
[1:49:56] while I got it all worked out I had to
[1:49:58] go there knowing
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:00] that I was sharing the struggles
[1:50:03] that as others were struggling I was
[1:50:05] also struggling but you know what God
[1:50:08] met me oh
[1:50:10] after that service everybody went to
[1:50:13] lunch I didn't go to lunch I went back
[1:50:15] up into the church to pray and I stayed
[1:50:17] there all afternoon and I said Lord I
[1:50:20] got to get this out of my heart and I
[1:50:22] knew that I had to ask my mother to
[1:50:23] forgive me and I knew that was going to
[1:50:26] hurt her
[1:50:31] I knew it was going to hurt her
[1:50:33] I knew it had never really occurred to
[1:50:36] her
[1:50:36] because I had never treated her any
[1:50:39] different
[1:50:40] I just kept doing what I had always done
[1:50:44] I didn't let her know what was eating at
[1:50:46] me
[1:50:48] it took all afternoon for me to pray
[1:50:50] through and touch God but when the
[1:50:52] victory came it came
[1:50:55] it was a Deliverance it was a mighty
[1:50:59] Deliverance because I needed it
[1:51:03] where is Joshua
[1:51:05] come and drive this off honey do
[1:51:07] something to help me I think I've I've
[1:51:09] over sweated it or something you hear it
[1:51:11] making a rattling sound
[1:51:14] when God delivered me he delivered me
[1:51:18] and I said Lord you're going to have to
[1:51:20] give me Grace to talk to my mother
[1:51:23] because I don't want to hurt her
[1:51:25] and you know I don't want to take more
[1:51:27] time on that hurry honey
[1:51:29] uh here's one
[1:51:33] I just don't think I can get to the
[1:51:35] connection
[1:51:36] praise the Lord
[1:51:39] God is so good
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:58] foreign
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:25] me isn't he good in the good all I want
[1:52:30] to say about that is when it came time
[1:52:32] before the service to start and I had to
[1:52:35] talk to my mother about what was in my
[1:52:37] heart she was so gracious
[1:52:40] the spirit of the Lord was still present
[1:52:42] because of all the praying through
[1:52:45] and I was able to apologize to my mother
[1:52:47] for carrying that and she was able to
[1:52:50] apologize to me
[1:52:52] for taking it for granted
[1:52:55] she never saw it
[1:52:58] all I needed was
[1:53:00] every six months or so
[1:53:03] a thank you
[1:53:04] you know honey thank you for what you do
[1:53:06] for me
[1:53:07] thank you that you paid the bills you
[1:53:09] didn't have to do that thank you that
[1:53:11] was all I needed but she didn't realize
[1:53:12] I needed it
[1:53:15] so she couldn't give me what I needed
[1:53:18] because she didn't really know what I
[1:53:19] needed
[1:53:20] anybody following me
[1:53:23] you may think that's so small and so
[1:53:25] silly but I want you to know the enemy
[1:53:27] was going to use something that small to
[1:53:29] Sidetrack me
[1:53:31] I knew I wasn't going to take communion
[1:53:33] with that in my life I knew that once
[1:53:35] God shined the Highlight on that that I
[1:53:37] had to do something to get that right
[1:53:39] and to get it under the blood
[1:53:41] because I didn't want to carry that
[1:53:43] forward in life I want you to know this
[1:53:46] is an hour that God's spotlight
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:51] is shining around us
[1:53:54] and God desires to highlight things in
[1:53:58] our heart
[1:53:59] he desires to highlight things in our
[1:54:02] life that's keeping us from fully
[1:54:05] abiding in Christ and fellowshipping
[1:54:09] with both the suffering and the blessing
[1:54:11] and understanding who we really are to
[1:54:14] be in this hour so if God brings
[1:54:17] something to your life to your mind to
[1:54:19] Your Heart by the Holy Spirit I beg you
[1:54:22] to go before the Lord I beg you to spend
[1:54:25] time with him and I'm a testimony that
[1:54:28] no matter how big or small he knows how
[1:54:30] to go down to Grub the very root of it
[1:54:33] and to get it out of your life
[1:54:36] The Cry of the remnant bride in this
[1:54:40] hour is we want to know you
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:45] you have to help me
[1:54:47] we want to know you
[1:54:49] we want to enter into more intimate
[1:54:52] fellowship with you
[1:54:55] more than power
[1:54:57] more than signs more than wonders more
[1:55:02] than Miracles we're running after him
[1:55:10] Hallelujah
[1:55:49] foreign
[1:56:03] good
[1:56:06] thank you honey
[1:56:08] thank you praise the Lord
[1:56:10] praise the Lord
[1:56:14] we want to fully understand the finished
[1:56:17] work that he has accomplished not only
[1:56:20] for us but what he has accomplished in
[1:56:23] US
[1:56:24] so that our striving and our soulish
[1:56:27] efforts can cease
[1:56:30] Moses experienced an encounter
[1:56:33] fellowship with God face to face
[1:56:37] the face of God speaks of his spirit
[1:56:40] this would mean the spirit of Moses
[1:56:42] having deep fellowship with the spirit
[1:56:45] of God how many of you want to
[1:56:47] understand that how many of you want to
[1:56:50] practice that in your life
[1:56:52] it means drawing string I need more
[1:56:54] volume
[1:56:55] here drawing strength and life directly
[1:56:59] from his source is a part of the bridal
[1:57:02] paradigm
[1:57:03] he doesn't just call you his bride so
[1:57:06] that he can put you on display
[1:57:08] he calls you his bride because he wants
[1:57:11] you to gain your strength and your
[1:57:14] sustenance from him he wants you to be
[1:57:17] connected to the Vine
[1:57:19] down a little he wants you to be
[1:57:21] connected to the vine he is the vine we
[1:57:24] are the branches you understand that in
[1:57:27] Genesis 1 the connection is made between
[1:57:30] the face of God and the God and the
[1:57:33] spirit of God moving on the water
[1:57:37] when we read that his Spirit was moving
[1:57:40] upon the Water the actual English says
[1:57:42] upon the what the face of the deep
[1:57:46] when we read in Revelation 17 and verse
[1:57:49] 15 we read that water speaks of
[1:57:53] multitudes of people
[1:57:56] it even speaks of Fellowship among those
[1:57:59] people
[1:58:01] and we read in second Corinthians
[1:58:03] Chapter 3 Verse 18 if you'll put that up
[1:58:06] there we're going to we're going to make
[1:58:08] some progress here in just a minute
[1:58:10] we're going to push back in but we all
[1:58:13] with open face
[1:58:15] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:58:20] Lord
[1:58:21] are changed into the same image
[1:58:24] how
[1:58:27] every time you come into the presence of
[1:58:30] God you touch his glory
[1:58:32] every time you touch his glory you grow
[1:58:36] I said every time you touch his glory
[1:58:39] you grow I said every time you touch his
[1:58:42] glory you grow when we come into His
[1:58:46] presence we grow we are being changed
[1:58:50] from glory to glory we don't come here
[1:58:53] to worship to see one another
[1:58:55] we're not here to see what somebody else
[1:58:57] is doing what kind of a manifestation
[1:59:00] somebody else has we're here to put our
[1:59:04] eyes on the Lord to gaze upon him with
[1:59:07] open face beholding as in a glass the
[1:59:10] glory of the Lord that we might be
[1:59:13] changed into the same image
[1:59:16] by touching the glory
[1:59:18] from glory to glory he's changing me
[1:59:22] even as by the spirit of the Lord as we
[1:59:27] begin to enter as his bride into that
[1:59:30] kind of Union that Moses was crying out
[1:59:33] for we are changed into his image
[1:59:37] not by what we hear
[1:59:42] but by what we see
[1:59:47] somebody said what do you mean doesn't
[1:59:48] the word change us yes
[1:59:50] the demonstration
[1:59:54] not the printed page
[1:59:56] it's the Living Word that changes us
[1:59:59] when you and I can get in the presence
[2:00:02] of the Lord and we begin to see the
[2:00:04] living word among us and we start
[2:00:07] ignoring one another's shortcomings and
[2:00:10] faults and failures and mistakes and
[2:00:12] bumps and hardships and whatever else
[2:00:15] we've been through as a body when we get
[2:00:18] to a place that only we can see the Lord
[2:00:20] we're not looking at each other we're
[2:00:23] not worried about someone being a little
[2:00:24] louder than someone else or someone
[2:00:26] doing a little differently than someone
[2:00:28] else we're not here to look at each
[2:00:30] other
[2:00:32] we're here to look upon the Lord
[2:00:34] somebody said isn't that isn't that
[2:00:36] difficult to do not when he shows up he
[2:00:39] was here this morning all we have to do
[2:00:42] is make a choice I'm not going to look
[2:00:43] at others I'm not going to look at my
[2:00:46] circumstances I'm not going to look at
[2:00:49] how hard it was to get here this morning
[2:00:51] I'm going to see the Lord because the
[2:00:54] more we look to the Lord the more we're
[2:00:56] changed so it's by seeing the lord it's
[2:01:00] by seeing the Living Word it's by seeing
[2:01:03] the manifestation of his presence
[2:01:05] that we are changed it's by touching his
[2:01:09] glory that we are changed
[2:01:12] with open face
[2:01:15] I've been feeling in my spirit for a
[2:01:17] long time at what we need
[2:01:22] more than anything else
[2:01:24] more than a new revelation
[2:01:27] is a better understanding
[2:01:30] of what God has already revealed
[2:01:34] a deeper revelation of what has already
[2:01:37] been accomplished on our behalf perhaps
[2:01:41] it will deliver somebody from the gerbil
[2:01:43] wheel of performance
[2:01:45] perhaps it will cause somebody to
[2:01:47] realize it's not by our carnal striving
[2:01:49] that we become like him it's not
[2:01:52] actually by doing that we become like
[2:01:54] him it's by waiting
[2:01:58] it's by waiting they that what they that
[2:02:03] is the same word that's used for making
[2:02:05] rope I told you that some time ago that
[2:02:08] word wait in Hebrew similar to the word
[2:02:11] that's used for weight in in Greek in
[2:02:14] the New Testament when it says and she
[2:02:16] arose and waited on them it doesn't mean
[2:02:19] she did nothing it means that she served
[2:02:21] their needs that's the New Testament
[2:02:23] that's Greek in Hebrew the word that's
[2:02:26] used for weight on the Lord is the same
[2:02:28] word that's used for making rope it
[2:02:31] means The Taking of of many small
[2:02:34] strands
[2:02:36] and binding them together
[2:02:39] so when Isaiah prophesied they that wait
[2:02:42] upon the Lord he was saying those who
[2:02:45] bind
[2:02:46] themselves to the Lord
[2:02:52] those who hold on to the Lord no matter
[2:02:55] what's going on in life
[2:02:58] no matter what's going on in
[2:02:59] circumstances those who hold on with
[2:03:03] everything they've got
[2:03:05] we might say it like the world says it
[2:03:07] sometime those who who feel like they're
[2:03:10] losing so they tie a knot on the rope
[2:03:12] and hold on to the knot
[2:03:16] let circumstances of Life cause you to
[2:03:19] be separated from the only one who can
[2:03:21] guide you through them
[2:03:23] don't let it break your fellowship with
[2:03:26] the word
[2:03:27] don't let it break your fellowship with
[2:03:29] the glory
[2:03:31] we need the glory we need the presence
[2:03:35] of the Lord
[2:03:36] to be changed
[2:03:38] all of our worship is not Warfare
[2:03:46] every song is not to be about Warfare
[2:03:49] I believe in Warfare oh believe me you
[2:03:51] don't have a choice but to believe
[2:03:53] if you're attached to this word you
[2:03:54] don't have a choice but to believe it
[2:03:56] it's your everyday reality
[2:03:58] when I got to North Carolina I dreamed
[2:04:01] all night long the first night one dream
[2:04:03] after another about witchcraft all night
[2:04:05] long all night long and the Lord was
[2:04:07] dealing with me about a stronghold of
[2:04:10] Witchcraft in the area and it didn't
[2:04:12] start with the dark arts and it didn't
[2:04:14] start with the new age it actually
[2:04:16] started with rebellion in the hearts of
[2:04:19] church people
[2:04:22] it just started with rebellion in the
[2:04:24] hearts of church people you know the
[2:04:25] Bible Likens that Rebellion
[2:04:29] that lack of obedience
[2:04:31] to Witchcraft an idolatry the Lord
[2:04:34] showed me that that's how it started but
[2:04:36] because it had been a stronghold in the
[2:04:37] area it had caused a gathering of those
[2:04:40] kinds of things into that into that
[2:04:43] place I didn't know where the church was
[2:04:45] and so I didn't even address it until
[2:04:47] Sunday morning but God did some pretty
[2:04:49] amazing things but on Saturday night as
[2:04:52] we were leaving the church
[2:04:54] we I first I reached out to one of the
[2:04:57] brothers and I said brother are you
[2:04:58] aware of a lot of Witchcraft or
[2:05:01] something like this in this area
[2:05:04] and he said well no not not what really
[2:05:06] comes to mind and another thing really
[2:05:08] comes to mind then he wrote back and he
[2:05:09] said well there is a woman that they've
[2:05:11] called to which who who practices these
[2:05:13] kinds of things but I think she may be
[2:05:14] dead now
[2:05:16] then he wrote back a few minutes later
[2:05:17] and he said well there is a a witchcraft
[2:05:20] New Age store just a few doors down from
[2:05:22] where I live I said okay well that that
[2:05:24] might be a connection
[2:05:26] when we left when we left the church on
[2:05:29] Saturday night to go down and have some
[2:05:31] food and fellowship with the church
[2:05:33] people we had to drive right through
[2:05:35] downtown Morganton to get there
[2:05:37] and in order to do that we had to drive
[2:05:39] down where parties were taking place on
[2:05:41] the downtown Square for Halloween
[2:05:45] so there's a man standing out there on
[2:05:46] the corner breathing fire swallowing
[2:05:49] fire with a big crowd around then we go
[2:05:51] down here and there's some kind of rock
[2:05:53] concert going on and they're twisting
[2:05:55] and gyrating and doing all kinds of
[2:05:57] things Sunday morning when I mentioned
[2:06:00] that kind of a spirit in the area
[2:06:01] there's a sister who comes there and she
[2:06:03] said you're mighty right brother Shelley
[2:06:05] you don't know how right you are she
[2:06:08] said Monday night Halloween night every
[2:06:11] year every year the witches come
[2:06:13] together in Morganton and dance in the
[2:06:16] street
[2:06:18] she said they block off the roads and
[2:06:20] the witches come from everywhere and and
[2:06:22] there's a one time a year that they're
[2:06:24] parading and proud of of their of their
[2:06:27] Curious Arts
[2:06:28] now I tell you something if you don't
[2:06:30] think that shifts an atmosphere in a
[2:06:32] region
[2:06:33] and so we prayed about that all night
[2:06:37] long one dream I had I was standing in a
[2:06:39] windowsill standing looking at her
[2:06:41] windowsill and someone had had this row
[2:06:44] of statutes statues idle looking things
[2:06:47] and uh crystals and and Stones hanging
[2:06:51] down hanging down in the window and
[2:06:54] these little statues lined up across the
[2:06:56] the aisle and the spirit of the Lord
[2:06:59] says to me see what you can do
[2:07:04] so I began to pray against the
[2:07:06] Witchcraft that was attached to those
[2:07:08] crazy looking things in the window and
[2:07:10] every one of them at the same time laid
[2:07:12] down
[2:07:13] on the windowsill
[2:07:16] and and the Lord said I'm giving you
[2:07:18] authority over that so that that makes
[2:07:20] you want to pray
[2:07:21] and I prayed a little longer and they
[2:07:23] begin to roll back and forth
[2:07:26] under the under the inspiration of that
[2:07:28] prayer never dream dream After Dream
[2:07:31] After Dream it just went on all night
[2:07:33] long
[2:07:33] on on Saturday night I dreamed all night
[2:07:37] long about eagles
[2:07:39] if every dream the first night was about
[2:07:42] witchcraft ever dreamed the last night
[2:07:45] was about eagles
[2:07:47] I saw a storm of eagles
[2:07:51] the spirit of the Lord took me here to
[2:07:53] the parking lot of this church I'm
[2:07:56] standing in the parking lot and I hear a
[2:08:00] voice calling for a perfect Eagle storm
[2:08:06] I said well I've heard about a perfect
[2:08:08] storm I know about a perfect storm but I
[2:08:10] don't know what a perfect Eagle storm is
[2:08:13] but you know I began to learn
[2:08:16] because the spirit of the Lord began to
[2:08:18] blow and the wind was blowing Eagles
[2:08:24] he was blowing Eagles from every kind of
[2:08:26] Direction
[2:08:28] Gathering them up over the top of the
[2:08:30] parking lot I I saw golden eagles I saw
[2:08:34] bald eagles I saw some Eagles uh species
[2:08:37] I didn't recognize and I even saw
[2:08:40] several Snow White Eagles
[2:08:44] in in the storm and it was a perfect
[2:08:46] storm the wind blowing in all four
[2:08:49] directions blowing Eagles remember what
[2:08:51] God Said over this place in the
[2:08:52] beginning he took us to Matthew where
[2:08:54] the carcass is
[2:08:56] where the carcass is there will the
[2:08:59] Eagles be gathered together
[2:09:00] and God was gathering them up in the air
[2:09:03] way up in the air they were blowing in
[2:09:05] from all four directions and when they
[2:09:07] got over the campground they began to
[2:09:09] turn together rotate together and it
[2:09:12] formed a perfect Eagle storm
[2:09:15] and is that perfect storm like a tornado
[2:09:18] begin to blow around I watched it as it
[2:09:20] began to lower itself bringing those
[2:09:22] Eagles right down onto them well what
[2:09:24] does that mean well I don't know what it
[2:09:26] means
[2:09:28] I don't know every detail of what it
[2:09:30] means but I know what we've been told
[2:09:32] we'll be the anointing that gets the
[2:09:34] ride through this last hour it's a
[2:09:36] flying eagle anointing Revelation it's
[2:09:39] the anointing of a flying eagle
[2:09:41] I know what a perfect storm is in the
[2:09:43] natural and I tell you that's what we
[2:09:45] need to meet The Perfect Storm we need a
[2:09:48] storm of Overcomers we need some
[2:09:50] Overcomers to blow around us amen and
[2:09:54] you know what I believe we're talking to
[2:09:56] some this morning
[2:09:57] I believe there's others
[2:10:00] I believe bone is about the fine bone
[2:10:02] hear him hear him I believe bone is
[2:10:05] about to find bone
[2:10:06] I believe God's about to gather some
[2:10:08] bones together in the graveyard I
[2:10:11] believe God's about to raise up a mighty
[2:10:13] Army on his feet
[2:10:14] that just a few hours before was nothing
[2:10:16] in the world but a bunch of bleached out
[2:10:18] dry bones
[2:10:19] son of man to that do you believe do you
[2:10:21] believe do you believe that these bones
[2:10:24] can live again Lord thou knowest Lord
[2:10:26] thou know it Lord send a perfect Eagle
[2:10:28] storm
[2:10:30] blow them in blow them to the Refuge
[2:10:35] blow them as you said you would
[2:10:38] give us Grace to be able to to nurse
[2:10:40] them
[2:10:41] to nurse them when they come
[2:10:44] I said Lord we can't be overwhelmed
[2:10:47] you've got to be in your timing
[2:10:49] because you've got to be able to help
[2:10:50] the wounded
[2:10:55] those those moping molting Eagles those
[2:10:58] Eagles that are forgotten how to fly God
[2:11:00] said they won't have to fly on their own
[2:11:03] I'll just gather a perfect storm
[2:11:05] and draw them myself
[2:11:07] all they'll have to do is yield to the
[2:11:09] wind oh there's a whole lot in that
[2:11:11] is anybody hearing me
[2:11:13] so I've been feeling that more than
[2:11:15] needing a new revelation we need a
[2:11:17] deeper understanding
[2:11:19] we need a deeper understanding of what
[2:11:21] God's already done on our behalf to
[2:11:24] finally begin to see once and for all
[2:11:25] all that he has completed for us a few
[2:11:29] more minutes if you give them to me
[2:11:31] second Corinthians 3 13 and 14 and not
[2:11:35] as Moses which put a veil over his face
[2:11:38] that the children of Israel could not
[2:11:40] steadfastly look to the end of that
[2:11:43] which is abolished
[2:11:45] but their minds were blinded
[2:11:47] you ought to hear this
[2:11:50] I wish the whole Messianic world could
[2:11:52] hear this I wish they could read these
[2:11:54] verses for themselves they might not be
[2:11:57] so divided and full of hatred toward one
[2:11:59] another if they could catch this they've
[2:12:02] gone the way of the denominational
[2:12:03] churches if they could just hear what
[2:12:05] the word of the Lord is saying here
[2:12:07] he said not as Moses which put a veil
[2:12:10] over his face that the children of
[2:12:12] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[2:12:14] end of that which is abolished but their
[2:12:18] minds were blinded for until this day
[2:12:21] remaineth the same Veil untaken away in
[2:12:23] the reading of the Old Testament which
[2:12:25] Veil which Veil which Veil
[2:12:28] is what
[2:12:30] the veil can be removed
[2:12:34] God's going to remove that veil of
[2:12:36] national blindness one of these days
[2:12:37] Israel is going to see her Messiah for
[2:12:40] who he is if you believe that same man
[2:12:42] and the word of the prophet of ultra
[2:12:44] will be fulfilled all of Israel he said
[2:12:46] all of Israel
[2:12:48] shall be saved that is the promise of
[2:12:51] the word so it's not missionaries we
[2:12:53] need it's getting us along to where we
[2:12:55] need to be so that God can do what he
[2:12:57] said he wanted to do
[2:12:59] he said in second Corinthians 3 16
[2:13:01] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[2:13:04] Lord
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:07] the veil shall be taken away
[2:13:09] everything that is separated Israel from
[2:13:12] their Messiah will one day be turned
[2:13:14] away
[2:13:16] it'll one day be torn down every Veil
[2:13:19] that has tried to separate you from an
[2:13:22] intimate Walk With Jesus Christ that
[2:13:24] same veil has to come
[2:13:26] it has to come down
[2:13:28] the only way it'll come down is for us
[2:13:30] to turn to the Lord
[2:13:32] just like the Jewish people just like
[2:13:34] National Israel it's when we turn to the
[2:13:37] Lord
[2:13:38] it's when we Rend our hearts
[2:13:41] and not our garments
[2:13:43] it's when we renew our Union with him
[2:13:46] that we can come to that place
[2:13:48] is anybody with me
[2:13:51] oh there's so much
[2:13:53] let me see got a few more minutes
[2:13:57] I want to get to something but
[2:13:59] I don't know if we can or not
[2:14:01] I
[2:14:04] Exodus 34.
[2:14:07] 29 and 30.
[2:14:10] and it came to pass
[2:14:13] when Moses came down from Mount Sinai
[2:14:16] where the two tables of testimony in
[2:14:18] Moses hand
[2:14:20] when he came down from the mount
[2:14:22] that Moses wished not that the skin of
[2:14:24] his face Shone while he talked with him
[2:14:27] and when Aaron and all the children of
[2:14:29] Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his
[2:14:32] face shone
[2:14:34] and they were afraid to come nigh him
[2:14:36] there had been a Transfiguration take
[2:14:39] place
[2:14:40] verse 33 until Moses had done speaking
[2:14:43] with him he put a veil on his face
[2:14:46] but when Moses went in before the Lord
[2:14:48] to speak with him he did what
[2:14:51] he took the veil off
[2:14:53] nothing nothing needs to be there
[2:14:58] nothing that will separate you from
[2:15:00] intimate face-to-face fellowship with
[2:15:02] the spirit of God nothing needs to
[2:15:05] remain he took the veil off until he
[2:15:07] came out and he came out and spoke unto
[2:15:09] the children of Israel that which he was
[2:15:12] commanded there needed to be a
[2:15:14] separation
[2:15:16] there needed to be something in that
[2:15:18] hour so that the people could look
[2:15:20] Beyond The Vessel
[2:15:22] they didn't need to see The Shining face
[2:15:25] of Moses they needed to see the living
[2:15:26] reality of God Almighty who was working
[2:15:29] in and through Moses you cannot put your
[2:15:32] eyes on the vessel you've got to get
[2:15:35] your eyes on the God who called him or
[2:15:37] her amen you've got to get your eyes on
[2:15:40] God Moses saw Glory the glory was a
[2:15:43] manifestation of God's love and mercy
[2:15:46] what Moses endeared the people feared
[2:15:49] their flesh separated them from being
[2:15:53] able to fellowship with that Glory
[2:15:55] sometimes today people feel the Holy
[2:15:57] Ghost and they get afraid if he touches
[2:16:00] you if the spirit of God touches you
[2:16:02] he's simply reaching out to you in love
[2:16:04] he would never hurt you the Holy Ghost
[2:16:07] would never make a fool of you
[2:16:10] Lord Rim the Veil
[2:16:13] Lord we're in the veil that seeks to
[2:16:16] separate us
[2:16:17] from having intimate fellowship with you
[2:16:19] are you with me
[2:16:21] what would God be able to do if we could
[2:16:23] keep our flesh down
[2:16:25] if we could keep our flesh from being a
[2:16:27] hindrance to the will of his spirit
[2:16:29] Israel was afraid but Mercy was behind
[2:16:31] that Veil Remember The Mercy Seat
[2:16:35] 25 years ago this month
[2:16:39] when my wife walked up the aisle of the
[2:16:42] church in Columbus
[2:16:43] she wore a veil
[2:16:47] her beauty was concealed
[2:16:50] the people were afraid of what they
[2:16:52] heard
[2:16:53] but Moses saw love he saw love
[2:16:56] manifested he saw love demonstrated
[2:17:00] When Stacy and I were married and she
[2:17:02] came down that aisle with her face
[2:17:04] covered by a veil but when we made our
[2:17:07] vows one to another
[2:17:10] her veil was lifted
[2:17:13] and I could see her with open face
[2:17:15] we made sure in the ceremony that her
[2:17:18] face was not veiled when we made our
[2:17:21] vows one to another
[2:17:23] because that is a moment that I needed
[2:17:25] to be able to look in her eyes and she
[2:17:27] needed to be able to look into my eyes
[2:17:28] and there didn't need to be any lace
[2:17:30] between us
[2:17:32] there didn't need to be any Veil between
[2:17:33] us I'm telling you there doesn't need to
[2:17:36] be a veil between you and the bridegroom
[2:17:38] in this hour and as I read to you a few
[2:17:40] weeks ago the spirit of the Lord said I
[2:17:43] am sending an anointing that will remove
[2:17:45] the final veils that separate my people
[2:17:48] from my presence I don't know about you
[2:17:50] but I'm signing up for that right now I
[2:17:53] don't want anything to stand between me
[2:17:55] and his presence
[2:17:56] when we made our vows one to another her
[2:17:59] veil was lifted and I could see her with
[2:18:02] open face
[2:18:04] I didn't kiss my wife in front of the
[2:18:06] church because we were we were teaching
[2:18:08] that a kiss should that that there
[2:18:10] should be no kisses until marriage
[2:18:13] and so I didn't want our kiss like that
[2:18:15] to be in front of the whole wide world
[2:18:18] we we made up for it later understand
[2:18:22] but what did what do you think that
[2:18:24] would have been if I would have tried to
[2:18:25] kiss her through that Veil
[2:18:31] that would be like washing your feet
[2:18:33] with your socks on
[2:18:37] who washes their feet leaves their socks
[2:18:39] on who's going to kiss their wife behind
[2:18:41] the veil
[2:18:43] we're not Muslim
[2:18:46] if you want to come into that kind of
[2:18:48] intimacy with Christ so that you can say
[2:18:51] like me like Moses said I want to know
[2:18:53] your way
[2:18:55] I want to know your way
[2:18:58] I don't want to go anywhere unless you
[2:19:00] go with us
[2:19:01] or maybe you're like Paul oh that I may
[2:19:04] know him
[2:19:06] that I may begin to understand what it
[2:19:09] means that I have already suffered with
[2:19:11] Christ
[2:19:13] if we don't understand that then our
[2:19:15] suffering now is wasted
[2:19:18] because we look to that as though it
[2:19:20] buys us something in the Kingdom your
[2:19:22] suffering does it buy you something in
[2:19:24] the Kingdom his suffering it's what
[2:19:27] broke loose all that the enemy had
[2:19:31] damned up
[2:19:32] anybody with me
[2:19:34] I want you to know Jesus removed that
[2:19:36] Veil
[2:19:38] that separated you from him
[2:19:40] the word has come and now we're not
[2:19:43] looking at the Lord through the lattice
[2:19:44] anymore
[2:19:46] it's springtime
[2:19:48] a turtle dove is cooing
[2:19:51] the Lord is in plain view
[2:19:54] that's why we needed the revelation of
[2:19:56] Jesus Christ anybody with me that's why
[2:19:58] we needed the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:20:00] the church had looked at Christ for so
[2:20:02] many years behind the lattice
[2:20:04] behind the veil we needed an unveiling
[2:20:07] we need an apocalypsis we needed God to
[2:20:11] let us see who he really is
[2:20:13] a veil gone nothing to separate us
[2:20:16] nothing to stand between us
[2:20:19] and the word tells us
[2:20:21] that this was demonstrated in Mark
[2:20:23] chapter 15 if you want to look there
[2:20:27] in Mark chapter 15.
[2:20:29] verse 37 and 38 in Jesus cried
[2:20:33] with a loud voice
[2:20:35] he gave up the ghost
[2:20:37] it means your spirit left him
[2:20:40] and the veil of the Temple
[2:20:45] was written in Twain
[2:20:51] from the top
[2:20:53] all the way to the bottom
[2:20:55] the veil that had kept man from having
[2:20:58] free access
[2:21:01] Zechariah 3.
[2:21:04] full access
[2:21:07] unhindered access
[2:21:09] oh Church we're we're not beginning to
[2:21:12] live
[2:21:13] where we're called to live
[2:21:15] is that discouraging
[2:21:19] we we haven't we haven't begun to live
[2:21:22] where we're called to live
[2:21:24] well what do we do give up no we press
[2:21:26] harder
[2:21:28] we dig out all the roots of bitterness
[2:21:30] if there's any resentment I don't care
[2:21:33] who it's stored I got up here and told
[2:21:35] you my own testimony not because I was
[2:21:37] proud of it not at all but because I
[2:21:40] wanted you to know that any of us none
[2:21:42] of us are immune the enemy constantly
[2:21:45] wants something to root in US
[2:21:47] brother random said you got to take that
[2:21:49] grubhole out and you've got to Grub that
[2:21:52] thing out by the root you can't ignore
[2:21:54] it how many of you know you can't ignore
[2:21:57] these things
[2:21:58] bitterness can't be ignored jealousy
[2:22:01] can't be ignored resentment can be
[2:22:04] ignored a religious devil can't be
[2:22:07] ignored
[2:22:09] you've got to Grub it out it's got to be
[2:22:12] dealt with
[2:22:13] Jesus removed the Veil
[2:22:16] from top to bottom
[2:22:20] history tells us if you would have
[2:22:22] hooked up several yoke of oxen
[2:22:24] to both sides of that Veil you couldn't
[2:22:26] have ripped it apart with a rope
[2:22:29] it was so thick and intricately woven
[2:22:31] together there was no way that an
[2:22:34] earthquake or any other natural disaster
[2:22:37] would have had the effect of tearing
[2:22:39] that Veil from the top to bottom I know
[2:22:41] what happened and you do too the
[2:22:43] almighty hands of God came
[2:22:45] and he tore that Veil like a sheet of
[2:22:48] paper
[2:22:48] from top to bottom not from not man
[2:22:50] doing not man giving us access God
[2:22:53] giving us access and then he said come
[2:22:55] in come in the veil is gone
[2:22:58] can I have paragraph 69 and I'm going to
[2:23:01] close in just a moment I know I've
[2:23:02] struggled with you this morning please
[2:23:04] forgive me
[2:23:08] paragraph 69 this is Brother Branham
[2:23:10] serving communion father
[2:23:12] as we take this communion as we call it
[2:23:14] communion it is in remembrance of you
[2:23:16] and when this little beaten wafer
[2:23:19] touches our tongues and goes into our
[2:23:22] mouth
[2:23:23] may we recognize
[2:23:26] that he was bruised and mashed
[2:23:29] torn for our sins
[2:23:32] somebody read that next line and that
[2:23:42] there are so many types here
[2:23:45] his body was a veil of Flesh the
[2:23:48] scripture said so his body had to be
[2:23:50] torn not only did the veil of the temple
[2:23:53] have to be torn to expose religion
[2:23:57] but the veil of his body had to be torn
[2:24:00] so that the God that was in him could
[2:24:02] now become a part of who we are and that
[2:24:04] Veil that hid him from us now he's in us
[2:24:09] if you believe that same man now he's in
[2:24:12] us the Holy Spirit
[2:24:15] in the message desperations paragraph
[2:24:18] 189 for the random said I hold kosher
[2:24:20] bread wrinkled and broken representing
[2:24:22] the body of Jesus Christ
[2:24:24] through this Riven Veil
[2:24:29] we have
[2:24:36] you get to go where only the high priest
[2:24:38] could go
[2:24:39] he only could go one day a year you can
[2:24:42] go
[2:24:43] 365 days a year 24 hours a day because
[2:24:48] the veil is Riven
[2:24:50] because your death is in him because
[2:24:53] your suffering is in him because he paid
[2:24:57] the price with you in him
[2:25:01] brother man who said it's faith by
[2:25:04] identification
[2:25:09] I heard brother random say you've heard
[2:25:11] us preach this for years you hear him
[2:25:12] cry out he said I was with Paul Revere
[2:25:17] he wasn't with Paul Revere in the
[2:25:20] natural
[2:25:21] he was with Paul Revere
[2:25:24] Revere in the vacation
[2:25:25] he said I'm an American
[2:25:28] I was with Washington when he crossed
[2:25:31] the chili Delaware he wasn't with him in
[2:25:33] body
[2:25:34] he was with him by identification
[2:25:37] when Paul said I died in Christ
[2:25:43] he died in him by identification
[2:25:48] and we Fellowship that Truth by faith
[2:25:52] we now have access to the holy of holies
[2:25:55] in the last quotation while the
[2:25:57] musicians are coming why are people so
[2:25:59] tossed about
[2:26:01] good question
[2:26:04] why are people so tossed about
[2:26:10] why do the smallest things Shake people
[2:26:12] off
[2:26:17] why do we get so bewildered about the
[2:26:20] smallest things
[2:26:22] why do we let little things get us so
[2:26:25] thrown off
[2:26:27] he said into this holy Place follow me
[2:26:30] and this is the end
[2:26:32] into this holy Place Aaron went once a
[2:26:35] year
[2:26:36] the congregation watched him he was
[2:26:39] dressed right he had to be anointed
[2:26:42] right he had to walk right blessed be
[2:26:45] the Lord dressed right walked right
[2:26:47] anointed right
[2:26:49] he had Bell and a pomegranate on His
[2:26:51] Garment and as he walked they played
[2:26:53] holy holy holy unto the Lord with every
[2:26:57] little Ringling
[2:26:59] it was screaming out holy holy holy unto
[2:27:02] the Lord he taken before him a charger
[2:27:04] of blood the blood of the Lamb the blood
[2:27:07] of the atonement and he was anointed
[2:27:08] with the Rose of Sharon
[2:27:11] the anointing ran off his beards
[2:27:14] come to the hymns
[2:27:16] of his skirt
[2:27:18] and he was walking into the inner courts
[2:27:20] in the presence of God listen
[2:27:22] and when he went behind there the veil
[2:27:25] fell behind him
[2:27:28] he was shut out was he shut out
[2:27:32] or was he shut in
[2:27:34] both
[2:27:38] he was both shut out
[2:27:40] and shut in
[2:27:43] he was hid from the outer world
[2:27:48] out
[2:27:50] praise be to God
[2:27:53] there is a hiding place
[2:27:56] Abiding Place that we can walk in the
[2:27:59] presence of God
[2:28:01] and be hid from the things of this world
[2:28:03] you don't hear them no more
[2:28:06] I want you to listen
[2:28:08] do you know how I can say this to this
[2:28:12] church do you know how I can in good
[2:28:15] conscience say to this church we haven't
[2:28:17] even began to live in that place
[2:28:20] because I know your testimony is similar
[2:28:22] to mine very few of us can testify today
[2:28:25] that we're living in the soundproof
[2:28:27] place
[2:28:30] very few of us could testify in honesty
[2:28:33] and say by faith we are there I want to
[2:28:35] tell you by faith I'm behind the veil by
[2:28:37] faith I'm in Heavenly places right now
[2:28:39] seated with Christ Jesus by faith I'm in
[2:28:42] a soundproof room
[2:28:43] I'm in a soundproof World by faith
[2:28:46] but very few of us can testify of this
[2:28:48] in reality that means there's something
[2:28:50] else to get a hold of
[2:28:52] he said there is a hiding place Abiding
[2:28:54] Place that we can walk in the presence
[2:28:55] of God and be hid from the things of
[2:28:57] this world you don't hear them no more
[2:29:01] it's sound proof Hallelujah sound proof
[2:29:05] the world is on the outside
[2:29:08] gasping and looking
[2:29:11] but you're on the inside
[2:29:13] in the presence of the Eternal
[2:29:15] everlasting God I'm closing
[2:29:21] I don't want to put you on the spot
[2:29:24] but I'd like to see those who are not
[2:29:26] who are who have no doubt that you
[2:29:29] worshiped this morning in the presence
[2:29:31] of the Lord I'd like for you to raise
[2:29:33] your hand
[2:29:34] I want to put you on the spot
[2:29:36] now look there's a church full of people
[2:29:38] who said I don't have any doubt
[2:29:40] I was in the presence of the Lord when I
[2:29:43] was worshiping him you really believe
[2:29:44] that you believe that Aaron it's a good
[2:29:46] name
[2:29:47] you believe that
[2:29:50] then here's who you were standing with
[2:29:53] in the presence of the Eternal
[2:29:56] everlasting God
[2:29:58] eating from this manna
[2:30:01] that will last for spans of years
[2:30:04] hundreds of years original manna
[2:30:08] the kind that Moses got abide of
[2:30:11] the kind that they had on the day of
[2:30:13] Pentecost
[2:30:14] say manna
[2:30:16] same spiritual food eating from this
[2:30:19] manna that will last for spans of years
[2:30:20] hundreds of years it never contaminated
[2:30:23] never did it give out
[2:30:26] and a man that once walks into God
[2:30:31] foreign
[2:30:40] slip of the tongue
[2:30:42] but for me an inspiration
[2:30:45] a man that once walks into God
[2:30:49] oh that I may know him
[2:30:52] oh that I may know his ways
[2:30:55] and a man that once walks into God and
[2:30:59] the veil drops behind him shutting off
[2:31:02] the things of the world
[2:31:05] he's in the presence of God eating the
[2:31:09] manna
[2:31:12] do you know what you had for breakfast
[2:31:13] this morning
[2:31:14] when you were entering into the presence
[2:31:16] of the Lord no it wasn't biscuits and
[2:31:19] gravy
[2:31:21] when you were worshiping and in the
[2:31:22] presence of the Eternal everlasting God
[2:31:25] you were eating something that comes
[2:31:27] from another realm another dimension
[2:31:31] it's the show bread
[2:31:34] it's the bread of his presence that's
[2:31:37] what it symbolizes when you come into
[2:31:40] the holy place from the outer court for
[2:31:42] the table of show bread was that was
[2:31:45] bread that represented his face
[2:31:48] it represented his presence
[2:31:51] when you are standing in the presence of
[2:31:54] the Eternal God he is giving you a taste
[2:31:58] of that presence bread
[2:32:01] you are tasting man huh that can never
[2:32:05] be contaminated
[2:32:07] because it's living reality not a
[2:32:09] printed page it's the living reality
[2:32:12] it's the evidence of the word
[2:32:15] it's spirit
[2:32:16] to Spirit Fellowship
[2:32:21] now let me just stop with this a moment
[2:32:23] because somebody started listening
[2:32:27] we rarely fellowship with one another
[2:32:31] on a spirit level
[2:32:34] most of my friends in the message would
[2:32:36] say in the soul
[2:32:38] but I say in the spirit
[2:32:41] and here's the reason why because the
[2:32:44] soulish realm is mined will and emotions
[2:32:48] most of our fellowship takes place in
[2:32:51] the flesh
[2:32:53] physical contact
[2:32:56] and in the soulish realm
[2:32:58] mine will and emotions
[2:33:02] we decide with our mind David
[2:33:05] whether we're going to fellowship or not
[2:33:07] well I think I'm gonna go home take a
[2:33:08] nap miss Fellowship this afternoon
[2:33:11] or I think I'm going to go over here and
[2:33:13] and and and I need some things at
[2:33:15] Walmart God be with you
[2:33:19] or I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna miss
[2:33:21] I'm not in a good mood I'm going I'm not
[2:33:23] going to have any fellowship with the
[2:33:24] folks today go do such and such I got
[2:33:26] this plan I got that we make it we make
[2:33:28] that up in our mind
[2:33:30] it's an act of our will
[2:33:32] we don't want to we don't we don't feel
[2:33:34] like it we don't we feel like it we do
[2:33:37] so we meet it with our mind and with our
[2:33:39] will we make a decision
[2:33:41] that's not Spirit Fellowship
[2:33:44] that soul Soul Realm
[2:33:48] and then that last part that big part of
[2:33:50] who we are emotions
[2:33:56] that's a big part
[2:33:58] we don't like what somebody says we get
[2:34:01] emotional
[2:34:04] we don't like what somebody does on the
[2:34:06] volleyball court
[2:34:09] back to that yeah
[2:34:11] we get emotional
[2:34:13] some people even get mad and go home
[2:34:16] emotional that's not Fellowship
[2:34:19] don't you go home and call that
[2:34:20] Fellowship
[2:34:21] that's not the kind of Fellowship we're
[2:34:23] talking about
[2:34:25] that'll never be enough
[2:34:28] I know there are people who want to be
[2:34:29] with somebody all the time I'm not that
[2:34:31] person
[2:34:35] I don't want to be with people all the
[2:34:36] time
[2:34:37] I love people
[2:34:39] but I don't be people all the time
[2:34:41] I like I like family time
[2:34:45] because you know what I realize
[2:34:47] I realize that if I carry a church full
[2:34:50] of people with me and I lose my own
[2:34:52] family
[2:34:58] I'm no success
[2:35:02] you understand
[2:35:03] so I like family time too
[2:35:07] and I like quiet time me time do what I
[2:35:09] want to do time which these days usually
[2:35:11] consists of sitting in a chair at one
[2:35:13] time it was gardening
[2:35:15] but now it's usually just sitting
[2:35:17] and we need that sometime
[2:35:20] we can be together and not be
[2:35:22] fellowshipping with one another on the
[2:35:23] kind of level I'm preaching about
[2:35:26] because if our emotions are still
[2:35:28] kicking in this is just one level of
[2:35:30] Fellowship but did you know there's a
[2:35:32] higher Fellowship
[2:35:35] do you know where that took place
[2:35:36] already today in this altar
[2:35:40] you were never more intimately connected
[2:35:44] with the one next to you
[2:35:46] than you were when you were standing
[2:35:47] here in the presence of the Lord if you
[2:35:49] indeed had shut off your emotions if you
[2:35:52] indeed had stopped looking around to see
[2:35:53] what somebody else was doing
[2:35:57] there is a fellowship in the spirit
[2:36:00] realm that takes place and it doesn't
[2:36:01] only have to take place during the
[2:36:03] worship time in the service it can take
[2:36:05] place when we're together
[2:36:09] sitting around the table
[2:36:11] you don't always have to be talking
[2:36:13] about the Lord to be having that kind of
[2:36:16] Fellowship it's on a deeper level
[2:36:19] it's not just the words coming out of
[2:36:21] your mouth it's just the Oneness
[2:36:23] you hear me sometimes saying when people
[2:36:25] come up here at the end of the service I
[2:36:27] say come closer come closer come fill in
[2:36:30] the reason I do that is because I don't
[2:36:33] want people to have to stand way up that
[2:36:35] aisle when there's plenty of room up
[2:36:37] here
[2:36:39] there's something about being close to
[2:36:42] one another I know we've come through
[2:36:44] flus and Coronas and all kinds of stuff
[2:36:47] but there's something about being close
[2:36:49] to one another in his presence
[2:36:52] it makes us feel connected
[2:36:55] it makes us feel one together
[2:36:58] and I want you to know you gain more
[2:37:01] strength
[2:37:02] from that moment
[2:37:04] than you do from the lunch that we're
[2:37:06] going to eat after a while
[2:37:08] it's the nourishing of the spirit man
[2:37:15] you are there to fellowship with God but
[2:37:19] what happens when my spirit is connected
[2:37:21] to him and your spirit is connected to
[2:37:23] him it pulls us into a Oneness
[2:37:27] whoa and then if you laugh louder than
[2:37:30] me I don't even notice I don't even care
[2:37:33] if you jump around a little more than I
[2:37:35] do or you do sing a little out longer
[2:37:37] louder I shut all that out
[2:37:40] because I'm so happy that you have
[2:37:42] connected with your creator I'm so happy
[2:37:45] that your spirit has connected with his
[2:37:48] so what we have to keep doing is
[2:37:49] checking our spirit to make sure that
[2:37:52] we've no longer shifted
[2:37:55] into some other kind of connection but
[2:37:57] we are ever just giving it just just
[2:38:03] and a man that once walks into God and
[2:38:06] the veil drops behind him shutting off
[2:38:08] the things of the world he's in the
[2:38:10] presence of God eating the manna
[2:38:14] no wonder 12 o'clock nine o'clock later
[2:38:17] or anything he is living in the presence
[2:38:19] of the king
[2:38:20] [Music]
[2:38:22] doesn't matter doesn't matter
[2:38:24] long it's been doesn't matter how much
[2:38:27] time has expired he's living in the
[2:38:29] presence of the king no wonder every day
[2:38:31] is fine for him he knows where he is at
[2:38:36] he has found the secret place he has
[2:38:39] went behind the veil wait a minute what
[2:38:41] about that day that you wake up and your
[2:38:44] emotions are in a tether and your texts
[2:38:46] are going crazy and you're you're
[2:38:47] running all you gotta do is remember
[2:38:50] you found the place
[2:38:52] you've got to get back there
[2:38:55] you will have your peace Disturbed
[2:38:58] life will not out of that place but once
[2:39:02] you learn how to get there
[2:39:04] you can go again and again and again and
[2:39:08] again and again you don't have to be in
[2:39:10] church you can do it in your automobile
[2:39:13] you can pull over the side of the road
[2:39:15] and find the secret place
[2:39:18] he has went behind the veil the doors is
[2:39:21] closed
[2:39:22] behind him
[2:39:25] he don't see nothing of the world
[2:39:27] them doors was made sound proof by
[2:39:31] sheepskin and goat skin and this is made
[2:39:33] sound proof by the baptism of the holy
[2:39:36] spirit that high
[2:39:39] [Music]
[2:39:41] you mean it's not about tongue talking
[2:39:43] and jumping pews it's really about more
[2:39:45] than that it sure is it's about hiding a
[2:39:48] man in Christ
[2:39:50] yeah
[2:39:51] and there he becomes you read it
[2:39:55] and he walks daily before him in this
[2:39:57] manner oh thank you Jesus last paragraph

[2:48:32] [Music]
[2:48:34] what could have been
[2:48:37] what should have been

[2:48:49] satisfy
[2:48:51] every longing in our heart
[2:48:54] every desire that we have
[2:48:57] is satisfied
[2:48:59] in our relationship with you
[2:49:02] and you become the only thing
[2:49:05] that we need
[2:49:07] [Music]
[2:49:08] and so Lord for all the emptiness right
[2:49:11] now that's represented in this room I'm
[2:49:13] asking you to pour in
[2:49:16] every time we've tried to figure it out
[2:49:19] and come up with a plan
[2:49:20] to survive
[2:49:22] when you didn't call us to be survivors
[2:49:25] you called us to be Overcomers
[2:49:28] every time we've let the flesh choose
[2:49:31] our way instead of lingering in your
[2:49:34] presence to discover your way every bit
[2:49:37] of that has left us with an emptiness
[2:49:40] and tonight today we stand before you
[2:49:42] Desiring to be whole
[2:49:47] oh Lord
[2:49:53] like brother Greeley told us recently
[2:49:56] our cry like John's cry
[2:49:58] [Music]
[2:50:00] I must decrease
[2:50:03] he must increase
[2:50:07] now Lord I'm asking you to pour Who You
[2:50:10] Are
[2:50:11] into those empty places
[2:50:14] in every heart in every life right now
[2:50:17] and I prophesy and decree wholeness
[2:50:22] I declare that we will not move forward
[2:50:25] as a broken people
[2:50:27] and an empty people
[2:50:30] but I decree that we will move forward
[2:50:32] in wholeness because we found our place

[3:05:25] another just now before we go

[3:05:58] brother I love you
[3:05:59] [Music]
[3:06:04] by this shall all men know
[3:06:07] that we have passed from Death unto life
[3:06:10] because of our love for one another
[3:06:12] [Music]
[3:06:14] because of our love for the brethren
[3:06:16] [Music]
[3:06:19] how can we love a God we haven't seen
[3:06:21] [Music]
[3:06:23] when we can't love a people that God
[3:06:25] gives us to love
[3:06:28] [Music]
[3:06:37] in the message from that time
[3:06:40] this came out Friday portion of this
[3:06:44] today we got the wrong conception of
[3:06:47] power
[3:06:48] power is overcoming
[3:06:51] returning good for evil that's real
[3:06:54] power
[3:06:56] that can love your enemy
[3:06:58] do good to those that do evil to you
[3:07:00] that's real power
[3:07:03] that's God's power yes
[3:07:05] Maniacs can break chains but it takes a
[3:07:08] real man to return good for evil from
[3:07:12] his heart not because of religious duty
[3:07:15] but from his heart brother Graham said
[3:07:18] that's what real power is
[3:07:20] being able to love those who have
[3:07:22] mistreated you and taken advantage of
[3:07:24] you may God help every one of us to pass
[3:07:27] this test
[3:07:28] I don't think sometimes we really
[3:07:30] understand the depth of love
[3:07:32] and what it really means to love him
[3:07:35] and to love one another but may God help
[3:07:37] us to do that it's not always easy
[3:07:39] there's no promise that it will be
[3:07:42] some folks are just a little more
[3:07:45] difficult to love than others
[3:07:47] but God places those in our life oh yes
[3:07:50] you've got some don't look at me
[3:07:53] [Music]
[3:07:55] unless I maybe you're looking at me
[3:07:57] because I'm the one
[3:07:59] that's harder for you to love maybe
[3:08:01] that's what it was about you were
[3:08:03] looking mighty strain I just can't
[3:08:05] hardly believe that all of us don't have
[3:08:07] one
[3:08:09] at least one and God put that one there
[3:08:12] [Music]
[3:08:14] God puts them there
[3:08:17] because you and I to overcome
[3:08:19] and be a love one another do you believe
[3:08:21] that
[3:08:22] oh Hallelujah did you miss somebody when
[3:08:24] you were given your love if you did make
[3:08:26] up for it now
[3:08:29] [Music]

[3:09:46] and we ask o God that as our faith
[3:09:49] reaches up to take a hold of every
[3:09:50] promise
[3:09:51] that it will come to manifestation and
[3:09:54] fruition in our lives and we'll give you
[3:09:57] glory and honor and praise bless our
[3:09:59] fellowship together today
[3:10:02] may it not all take place
[3:10:05] in just the realm of the flesh or the
[3:10:07] emotions
[3:10:08] but may we be able to touch one another
[3:10:12] somehow
[3:10:13] in that realm of Holy Spirit
[3:10:17] your spirit that has regenerated ours
[3:10:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[3:10:24] pray amen
[3:10:26] let me just say as you get ready to go
[3:10:28] that we will bring our food back and
[3:10:31] have Fellowship together we have a
[3:10:33] spring day
[3:10:34] in the middle of November
[3:10:37] we have a spring day to enjoy today
[3:10:40] two weeks from this Sunday we're going
[3:10:43] to be taking a risk
[3:10:46] next Sunday it's going to be quite cool
[3:10:48] I'm not sure what we'll do
[3:10:50] it could even be cooler two weeks from
[3:10:52] today but on November the 20th
[3:10:56] I want us before we take the tent down
[3:10:58] on November the 20th Sunday November the
[3:11:02] 20th I want us to have a lunch together
[3:11:04] a Thanksgiving lunch
[3:11:07] and we will
[3:11:09] celebrate that day together because
[3:11:11] Benny will be leaving to go out of town
[3:11:13] for the holiday
[3:11:15] brother Branham said that Thanksgiving
[3:11:17] is the only real American holiday and in
[3:11:20] one place he said the Christian holiday
[3:11:23] it's it's not just about a day
[3:11:26] but it's a day that we can remember
[3:11:29] if I had my choice I would like to have
[3:11:32] Thanksgiving dinner with all of you on
[3:11:34] Thursday
[3:11:36] but we have families you have
[3:11:38] obligations and we can't do that but we
[3:11:42] can do it Sunday
[3:11:43] so you may need a blanket
[3:11:46] you may need your wool coats that you
[3:11:49] buy and don't wear
[3:11:54] there's I doubt there's anybody maybe a
[3:11:56] small child that's outgrown that we
[3:11:58] might have to get a warm coat for but I
[3:12:00] think most of us have more coats hanging
[3:12:02] in the closet than we'll ever wear in in
[3:12:05] Alabama
[3:12:06] so you may need to get you one out
[3:12:08] because it could be cooler I I would
[3:12:11] dare say it will be cooler than it will
[3:12:13] be today but on November the 20th
[3:12:17] my wife will put a put a group together
[3:12:19] on Facebook for that I know some of you
[3:12:22] aren't on Facebook but we don't have any
[3:12:24] way of getting in touch with everybody
[3:12:26] over everything if you can't connect
[3:12:28] with us that way then you'll just have
[3:12:30] to be told to pass the word around let
[3:12:33] the information get out that's the best
[3:12:35] we can do
[3:12:36] we're just uh we just have lots of other
[3:12:40] things to think about so please help us
[3:12:42] get the word out but she will put
[3:12:44] together so that we can for sure focus
[3:12:47] on Thanksgiving dishes that particular
[3:12:50] lunch and make it just a real special
[3:12:52] time we're going to decorate the tables
[3:12:55] and we're going to make it just a real a
[3:12:57] real special time of remember I've
[3:12:59] wanted to do this for so long and it's
[3:13:01] been years
[3:13:02] since we've been able to do it one day
[3:13:04] in the near future may we have a warm
[3:13:07] comfortable cool place that we can
[3:13:10] Fellowship together in a building
[3:13:12] somewhere may God grant that for us but
[3:13:14] if he will help us and he will cause the
[3:13:18] weather to be mild a little bit possible

[3:14:04] seeking
[3:14:06] your face
[3:14:08] touching
[3:14:10] your grace
[3:14:13] in the cleft of The Rock
[3:14:17] [Music]
[3:14:21] presence
[3:14:24] presence
[3:14:26] [Music]
[3:14:31] that's where I belong
[3:14:36] [Music]
