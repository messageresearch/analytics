[0:00] but there is an alloted portion of word
[0:04] for every age now we know that there was
[0:08] an allotted portion of the word for the
[0:10] last age we're sure of that and for what
[0:13] God did a generation ago there was
[0:16] certainly a portion of word laid aside
[0:20] for that age that was the closing
[0:23] Twilight hours of leod deia and now we
[0:27] are beginning to stretch ourselves out
[0:30] of the church ages toward the Millennium
[0:33] can you say Amen we we know we know
[0:35] we're still encumbered by church anity
[0:38] we know that we are still weed down by
[0:41] the lukewarmness of leod deia but there
[0:45] is something that happens to the
[0:47] believer when he or she begins to Feast
[0:50] on the word there is a a
[0:53] stimulation that Revelation brings that
[0:56] causes him or her to take a bite out of
[1:00] the age to
[1:01] come and and what a privilege it is to
[1:05] live over here still in Satan's Eden so
[1:09] to speak and be able to reach Beyond the
[1:13] Veil into Millennial Authority and take
[1:16] a
[1:17] bite oh hallelujah it's like the grapes
[1:22] that were brought back on the poles out
[1:24] of the land of promise Those Grapes of
[1:27] eshcol they were able to get get a
[1:30] sampling of what it was about to be like
[1:34] when they took the promised land and so
[1:37] the richness of this word of the hour
[1:40] the richness of what God does Even in
[1:43] our age in our generation in our time is
[1:47] he takes that which is yet to come to
[1:50] full reality he brings it back toward us
[1:54] we reach toward
[1:56] it we're not exactly pulling it in to
[2:00] time but we are we are reaching toward
[2:03] it we're meeting somewhere and it causes
[2:06] a stimulation that that brother brandom
[2:09] said it's none other than the
[2:10] Fulfillment of the scripture we are made
[2:13] to sit together in Heavenly places in
[2:17] Christ Jesus we never physically have to
[2:20] leave the house we never physically have
[2:23] to leave this realm but spiritually
[2:26] we're lifted up into the word and it
[2:29] feeds us us and it strengthens us and it
[2:33] sustains us it quickens us so there was
[2:37] a great portion of the word that was
[2:40] laid aside for the last Church age but
[2:44] even in the lap over even in the
[2:46] stretching period God will emphasize for
[2:50] us today certain aspects of the word
[2:55] that was laid up for the last age it's
[2:58] all the word it's it's all right it's
[3:01] all good it's all helpful beneficial all
[3:06] true but he'll come by the anointing
[3:10] that's why we need an encounter with the
[3:13] anointing we need the the original logos
[3:16] among us we need that inspiration that
[3:20] will take a portion of that word laid up
[3:23] for every age bring it right into us
[3:28] right into us even this morning if
[3:30] you've got a heart to believe if you've
[3:32] got faith to receive it he'll bring the
[3:34] word right here to you today he'll
[3:37] update that word in your heart it'll no
[3:41] longer just be something you've heard it
[3:43] will become a part of you it'll digest
[3:46] in your inner being and you'll not walk
[3:48] out of here knowing a revelation you'll
[3:51] walk out of here being a
[3:53] revelation a revelation is not just a
[3:56] knowledge that we gain a revelation is a
[3:59] trans
[4:00] in who we are a revelation will
[4:03] transform us from the struggles of Leo
[4:07] deia from the battles of the pest house
[4:11] from the Mind Battle of Satan into a
[4:14] kingdom that says I know what the word
[4:18] said and the word is talking about me
[4:22] when you and I can get to a place where
[4:25] we realize that when we read the book
[4:29] we're reading in our story we're reading
[4:32] what is sent to us it's for us and when
[4:38] we eat that word that word becomes a
[4:41] part of who we are and then we begin to
[4:44] be like even like Christ in the
[4:47] sense in the sense that the word was
[4:49] fleshing out the word was becoming flesh
