Description:
"But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day." (Deuteronomy 4:4 KJV)

The sermon addresses the critical importance of maintaining steadfast spiritual fellowship with Christ through His Word, warning against the danger of spiritual drift that can occur even among committed believers. The central theme emphasizes the necessity of "cleaving" to God's Word rather than allowing truth to drift by or falling away from foundational principles.

lick of fire and now we're here tonight gathered in his name you may be seated again just a moment you must be getting tired of being up and down but we're just kind of like that around here I realize that sometimes our worship can be a little off-putting it can kind of you know take people back a little bit but I want you to know that uh no one is putting in any pressure on any visitor to worship like we do but neither are we going to let your presence here keep us from worshiping like we always do right you see a lot of the people who are worshiping tonight were never born into a system they were born in Freedom and it makes a difference does it makes a difference when when you your Exodus was from sin and you didn't have to go through Church systems to get to where you are it makes a difference and so we we can apologize for freedom freedom and liberty is what we were promised he didn't die just to make us stoic Christians he he died to give us freedom not freedom to sin freedom to worship Him and freedom to live a different life aren't you glad for that tonight I I uh am just blessed I'm so blessed uh I'm so blessed that I can't even hardly think of of the pleasantries and and the preliminaries that I should be saying now brother gy is the associate pastor and he's away this weekend because of the death of his brother-in-law and he Delights in being able to call each one's name you know I think he'd be baffled tonight I I I don't think he'd could go all the way around the room brother but but he he really knows even the children's name and I don't know your name and you may have told me but it doesn't matter I know you're my brothers and sisters in Christ I know you've come because you wanted to Worship the Lord you certainly didn't come to see us if you did you'll be terribly disappointed we're none of us are much to look at but I'll tell you he is everything am and uh it doesn't sound too much like a man but I have to say it anyway to me he's so beautiful he's all together lovely I've never seen anything more beautiful than Jes Jesus and he's alive and he's well he's the same yesterday and today and forever don't you believe that with all my heart I do so just know that we're glad that you're here brother John it's so good to see you I do know your name and you brought a bunch of folks with you and we're so thankful for that so thankful

that there's nothing here that I want except more of him and one of these days we're stepping out of here oh I believe that don't you well I wasn't going to sing but I am I'm I am because uh I've

don't believe they're all to be drums in in church well I want you to know uh I kind of believe they they're they're they're real good to keep me on beat brother brandom said if you want to have a Revival just get you a drum and start beating on it and telling everybody about about the Lord I'm not trying to justify anything I'm just telling you that the world has has hijacked a lot of things stolen a lot of things and they belong to Jesus and they can be Sanctified and we want to use whatever we have uh even that internet that can be so vile and so worldly we want to use it to advance the purposes of the kingdom of God in every way that we can we want to do that would you turn this evening uh to Revelation chapter 3 beginning in verse 13 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and I would like to preach a couple hours on the beginning of the creation of God but not tonight I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot three times three times he says the differentiation cold or hot I'd rather you be cold or hot I'd rather you be cold or hot but because you're lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth that's not a dribble because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of help me and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked it sounds like he's talking about the drgs of the world but he's not at all he's talking about the last Church age he's talking about the last Church system he's talking about the age that you and I are pulling out of we're living in a lap over between leod DEA and the bride age but this is where we have come from some of us have come from this it's our story Rich increase with Goods have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art Rich wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich there is a richness that has nothing to do with this world's economy amen we started off tonight by singing I'm rich in faith and hope and love let me tell you something that's the riches of this bride that's our inheritance as him Hope and Faith and love and the the move of God uh I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and uh anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see is there anybody here tonight thankful for the isav I'm thankful for the grease I'm thankful that God has anointed our eyes as many as I love you see love is not just acceptance as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be be what zealous it means to have passion to be zealous therefore and repent in Hebrews let's catch a few verses there before we're seated chapter 2 veres 1-3 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall I want you to to read the next word to me now we we how shall we not how shall they come on not how shall they how shall we escape if we neglect so great so great salvation I read to you just a moment ago about they and now I'm reading to you about we how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him Jesus we are here tonight to lift up your name and the Saints are here they have sacrificed to be here they have come with their own Finance the gas and their automobile and the food they they would bring and and and need all all the things that are involved some of them are sort of camping out there may not even be enough beds to go around but Lord they they didn't come to hear me they didn't come to see us they didn't come just to Mark Alabama off their list of states they've come to encounter you and your word to to see you in living reality and I I need you tonight Lord because I'm just a man and I I can get in the way way just as uh like I can get out of the way so I ask you tonight to help me be moved out of the way let me catch the frequency of another dimension another realm and let me minister to this people in a way that would not wear them out but that it would somehow speak to their lives and in this we will give you all the thanks you're the worthy one and all the praise it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated we don't want to freeze the people out so if you see that they're getting cold then you can make the adjustments I don't want to start off with an offense and trouble anybody but I would like to read those verses for just a moment from the Amplified version and I'm doing that because tonight I don't have the time to break down every word I like to know what the word means I like to know not only what it means in Modern English but I like to know what it meant in the original language that it was written I'm not trying to be intellectual because you you can't put that on so you'll certainly see that I'm not intellectual but I want to be accurate and I want to be thorough and I want this word to not be misinterpreted or misplaced in any way way we can take sometimes a word of Old English this Bible that we have we're thankful for it it is the word of God preserved for us it's not full of holes it's not full of contradictions it's not full of mistakes but there are time I thought you would say Amen but there are times that we can misunderstand the word because it means something different today than it did under the reign of King James so I'd like to just uh break that down it would be wonderful to be able to do that but time wouldn't allow it so let me read uh just a moment these three verses since all this is true we ought to pay much closer attention I'm Hebrews 213 I hope I I may not be honey that's my daughter I don't want you to think I'm calling some random Mr honey although we are in the South and we do that sometime let me just read it since all this is true it's beginning in verse one I may not have given it to you that way we ought to pay much closer attention than ever to the truths that we have heard lest in any way we listen we drift past them you see that word slip uh that is used there in the King James it means to flow past when we think of the word slip we think of a misstep and we think of a a slippery path I don't know about you Northern people but but we Southern folks we just really went through something down here we had white stuff falling out of the sky and we had ice on our roads and uh it was almost like waking up in a foreign country or something to us and it was so slippery that it shut down the interstate can you imagine that we don't have enough sand trucks and all the things that you folk have and the interstate was closed down because there were so many wrecks and so many accidents that had taken place so when we think of the word slip we think of something slippery but this is not slippery the word is airm Foundation nothing slippery about it and the enemy is The Great Deceiver and the great Seducer and he would like to uh certainly to make us step off of that Foundation but it's not by because it's slippery because the word actually means to flow past to Glide by to drift away to fall off or to end up in Decline so the amp ified did very well when it said less than any way we drift past them what is them the things which we have heard we can't fall back from them we can't decline from them and we can't drift past them we can't drift away from them we've got to make sure that our feet remain on the foundation of the ABS absolute word of God the Holy Scripture amen are you going to help me tonight it's going to be a long evening if you don't help a little bit I'm talking about the Bible I'm talking about Genesis to Revelation I don't want to throw you off and cause you to misunderstand I'm not talking about your pastor sermons I'm not even talking about brother brandham sermons I'm talking about Genesis to revelation I'm talking about his absolute the prophet kept telling us what his absolute was it was the Scripture it was Genesis to Revelation he even said more than one time if if I say something that you can't find in that Bible in that scripture he said don't you believe it that's what he amen get quiet I I didn't give them the quotes but I've got them right here if you need them I have them don't take my word for it he said amen go back to the absolute and there's a lot of preaching that goes on in this old world around even the ranks of the message of the hour that we just couldn't really take it back to the word so it's not our job it's not our commission it's not our ministry to point out all those things but it is our ministry to stay on the word lest we fall off of it lest we drift past it you understand what I'm saying we've got an anchor we have an anchor so he said for for If the message given through Angels the law spoken to Moses was authentic and proved sure and every violation and Disobedience received an appropriate just and adequate penalty how shall amen how shall we escape there's a whole lot of preaching that goes on about out there but every now now and then we need some word about in here how shall how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation if we let it drift by or we drift by it or fall off of it because the word slip can actually mean to fall off of it if we fall off the word what do we have left if we go out on a limb with some idea or some Doctrine or some interpretation that doesn't have its foundation in the scripture and we fall off the foundation we will be no better off than those who are living under their Leo Dean Spirit you see we not only have to overcome the spirit of the age but we have to overcome the temptation to yield ourselves to fanaticism amen Amen brother bandam preaching about Martin Luther he said you know that was one of the great things about Martin Luther there weren't a whole lot of great things about Martin Luther that's right he received one great Revelation that changed a lot of things but he struggled if you have ever read the writings of Martin Luther he he struggled uh almost to the end of his life with what he had done so yes it was a revelation that got bigger than him he was a messenger sent to bring it and it rolled like a snowball into the great Reformation but he personally continued to struggle with some of the reality that God is not nearly as interested in our works and our doings and our religious trappings as he is the Inner Man because if we get the inner man right if our heart is right if we can if we can win the victory over our mind over our will and over our emotions you see there's a great battle going on the greatest battle ever fought and it's not going on out there it's going on in here how shall we escape if we neglect and refuse to pay attention to such great a Salvation as is now offered to us letting it drift past us forever for it was declared at first by the Lord himself and it was confirmed to us and proved to be real and genuine by those who personally heard him speak how many of you know they were eyewitnesses they saw they heard and they told and God has preserved that for this day you need to understand that by elevating the word we're not putting anybody down you you don't have to put somebody down to elevate the word when you elevate the word who are you lifting up you're lifting up Jesus Christ John the Baptist said I must decrease that he might increase therefore anybody coming in the same SP spirit and power that John the Baptist operated in which was not his own anointing but it was a portion of the same kind of anointing that fell on Elijah of the Old Testament amen and therefore anybody coming under that kind of inspiration would have to live in the same vein in the same realm and that realm says I must decrease oh my you're going to make me work tonight aren't you I must get very small so that the one I'm come to introduce you to can get very large you understand what I'm saying don't you you can respect all the gifts of God we should respect The Messengers that God sent to us one to a church age how many one one to a church age we should respect the five-fold ministry because she is alive and we well there are still to this day Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists those things are not over you see this message the prophet said is a restoration message some people have made it a subtraction message we're taking away from oh no this message was the one promis to restore to put back to place again what the enemy had taken away this is not just to take us back to the day of Pentecost it's to take us all the way back to the Garden of Eden all the way back to the authority that belonged to Adam in the beginning and so we need more than just a Pentecost but we need some of that because you see we've been in that Exodus so long that we no longer look at Pentecost like a denomination or like a movement to us it means nothing but an experience and without that original [Music] Mana without that real Holy Ghost baptism you're going to fall off the Bible you're going to fall off the word you're going to find yourself drifting in life's sea and it doesn't have to be the influence of others because sometimes the battle that's right that's right you don't have to have another voice from the outside coming in you've got one on the inside sometime that's contrary he said so you you've got those two dogs well I'm Holy Ghost fi there's only one in me well I I I want you to know I don't understand that because the Apostle Paul the church age messenger the very first one that God sent to the Ephesian Church age he said in my innermost being not out there can I get out of this harness just a little bit he he he oh somebody said take it off why didn't you say that sooner he said in my innermost being there is a Warfare I want to do that which I would and when I when I when I desire and set out to do that which I would something else there's another War there's another in influence in my members that's trying to lead me so you don't just have to fall under the influence of someone else I think that some of you of course have come from systems that believe that if you cut off the world and its influence that everything would be all right but what we have failed to understand is the last battle it's not a battle from out there to inhere it's not an influence from the systems that we've been delivered from although some fall victim to that but the great battle the last one that the bride is winning yes she's winning we're winning in 2025 is a mind battle you see it's the lie in here it's the one you tell yourself it's the one the enemy Whispers to you from the inside out and if we neglect so great salvation if we let anything slip that has been delivered to us that has its foundation in the word we're the ones that are going to pay the price we're going to lose more than just a few folks we're going to lose more than we could even place value on or calculate this little bride is still I I I I want you to understand that even though the word of God has been made known we're not yet in the picnic this is still a war zone because all of hell is turned on this little bride You Know The Enemy he is so jealous of you Satan is so jealous of you because you are already in the mind of of God you are already what he wanted to be you already have authority that he wanted to have you already know his end and he knows his end and he knows that he cannot pluck you and I out of the hand of the bridegroom King the one who redeemed us with an Incorruptible price the price of his own blood he knows that he can't change your election he can't even make you not a son so so therefore it's not your relationship with God that the enemy can have any influence over it's your fellowship I said it's your fellowship I said it's your fellowship that the enemy would like to mess up because if he can break your fellowship with your father with your papa if he can break your fellowship with your creator if he can cause you to fall off or let truth drift by you while you're standing still if he can cause you to lift your anchor come on get distracted by the things that are said on the Internet or distracted by family members who think you've surely lost your mind if he can cause us to to get distracted in this hour he knows he can paralyze us he can't change our Eternal destination he can't take us out of Eternity with Christ but he can distract us and disuade us and cause us to stand still when the pillar of fire moves on you don't want to be standing still while the pillar of fire is leading the Bri forward and and where would he lead us Beyond where we already are let me tell you what the New Testament says let us go on let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundations of baptisms Etc amen you ought to know that the only Christian baptism by now is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know that by now if you don't then there's got to be somebody to tell you what the word says but this little bride can only be hung in in understanding a godhead or understanding uh an end time event or or or something along that line we've got to win this battle here we've got to get bitterness out of the way and jealousies out of the way and resentments out of the way and and offense is out of the way we've got to do some gardening by the help of the Holy Ghost we've got to do some holding on and we've got to do some turning loose I said we've got to do some holding on and we've got to do some turning loose because there's a move on there's a move on let me tell you there is a move on for the little bride of Jesus Christ the ones who are allowing Jesus to get bigger the word to get bigger those who are turning their eyes to the scripture with the understanding that God has brought to us in this day there's no doubt about it this ministry that God has sent has caused the Bible to become a new book that's but yet we cannot make it say something that it doesn't say I don't know where my Amen Corner is tonight but I'm going to assume that you know I'm telling you the truth just the same in a message right down the road here in mon Georgia in 1955 I I won't finish reading that I'll go on uh God it the message was called Fellowship through the reconciliation of the blood your fellowship with God is of Great Value and importance in this hour amen God sending a Revival Across the Nation great signs and wonders and signs appearing everywhere and healing of sick the raising of dead and everything and Men weighed right on through breaking down every red light and running through every barrier what's that word refus refusing or you say I've gone to church I'm as good as you are that's not the question here is the question have you received the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior that's the question it's not what do you think about the seals the question is have you received the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior have have you been reconciled you and I have been given a Ministry of reconciliation and we're not only to be testifying about the good things that we have seen and heard in the ministry that God sent to help prepare us we're supposed to be testifying of the goodness of the Savior who held back the water did you sing that held back the water so that you and I could escape from the the Egypt of sin then he did it again he held back the water so that we could escape from man's religion you don't want to trade one man's religion for another man's religion else we fall off the word that's right we must not do that we must not get caught up in the semantics we must not get caught up only in the signs we must hear the voice and the voice didn't point us to the signs the voice pointed us to the word and he tells us Jesus Jesus is the word and had he not told us that the Bible already did in john1 did yes he is the word he said have you been reconciled you say well I belong to the nicest Church in town that's not the idea are you born again of the spirit of God have you Fellowship have you Fellowship perfect Fellowship the things of the world dead when we are in perfect Fellowship the world and its charms are no longer tormenting us one of the ways we can know are we born of the spirit of God is how is your fellowship amen how is your prayer life are you abiding in the vine have you discovered where real life comes from the the title of this that God laid on my heart is anchored or a drift the choice to cleave or to drift away it's it's our it's our choice uh I'm going to cleave I'm going to hold on to the word I'm going to lay my head on his chest I'm going to get as close to Jesus as I possibly can I'm not going to let this world affect my fellowship I'm not going to let the arguments that go on in our ranks affect my fellowship with Christ I'm going to shed that stuff like a duck sheds water whatever they do is on them whatever I do is on me I must have fellowship with him and when I say that I don't just mean hearing the preaching I mean meeting him in the reality of who he is he is not only the word on page he is a Living Word word a moving breathing word a walking talking word a delivering word he has an answer to mental illness you may not find it on the page but you'll find it when you've encountered The Living Word he's the same yesterday today and forever he's got an answer for anxiety he has an answer for depression he has an answer for the spirit of suicide he has an answer for the spirit of offense he has an answer for family Strife a a and difficulties he has an answer for all of those wedges that the enemy has tried to place in your home and in your family the Living Word has an answer for that and you'll discover that answer as you find fellowship with him draw the the the blinds together and close the curtains and shut out the outside for just a moment or two and have fellowship with him Fellowship Divine come on now Fellowship you can study and not have Fellowship you can learn to memorize and not have Fellowship he said that's not the idea you're born perfect Fellowship the things of the world Dead Oh you said no don't condemn me well my brother some days some people don't even have a conscience he said one oldtime colored fellow after I was preaching on the street corner said preacher you know what your conscience is and and I said I have an idea sir what do you what do you think it is he said it's a little thing that sets like this and it's got four sharp and brother brandom is trying to use his accent pints which he said he was referring he meant points so some little something this was just his idea of how the conscious operated four points on it and when you do anything wrong it cuts I like to say it Pricks and he said you you you keep letting it cut it cuts a circle around there all four points you know St Ing and and he said after a while you don't [Music] even you don't even feel it at all our lack of love in this hour has produced a a hardening of heart that has caused even those sitting in the church they're conscious sometime to be seared like a hot iron and that little thing is rolling around I'm just this is just an example just someone's idea of what it would like it's rolling around in there but you don't feel the prick anymore you don't feel the point of it anymore because you have ignored it so long we ought to give the most Earnest heed we we should how shall we escape amen he said and that's right you just keep lukewarm hear him drifting away drifting away and after a while you're all the way gone he doesn't seem to just be talking to denominations he seems to be talking to all believers in a message evidence of the Resurrection he said even in our own meetings we we we've got too much to the place there's too much on Divine Healing listen listen too much on Divine Healing he said instead of healing of the Soul he said brother what we need today is a Revival of breaking up Souls on fire for God does that speak to anybody's heart instead of dragging them along Sunday after Sunday come on propping them up it's going to get quiet you know petting them you know the old man said giving them a a sugar titt you know just making sure that that the paragard goes down with a spoonful of sugar you better melt a little sugar if you're going to swallow the uh the kerosene or whatever it is that someone is is thinking you you got to I want you to know folks we're past that we gave up the sugar TTS I hope that doesn't offend you we gave up the candy coating we don't need any more candy coating we need it to come so straight so Gun Barrel straight there's nowhere to run except to the [Applause] word we need it it's the only hope if your burden is to bring people out of other systems into the reality of the full word you definitely don't want to fall into some kind of a rut where you're pulling them out of one fire and a they're just changing boxes just just a minute I'm going to have to help myself a little bit preach brother preach PR brother listen you learn did you know this this October uh uh well September but but we will kind of celebrate in October is 50 years of Ministry for me I may sound tonight like a beginner like I just got started but I want you to know I've been around this thing long enough to know that it's not another pat on the back that we need we need something so straight that as I said a moment ago we have nowhere else to run you know Dr Phil has no answers the the bookstore has no answers we know the churches out there don't have any answers and sometimes those that claim the message of the hour they don't have any answers either because they're trying to take somebody to a sermon and that is not the hope that they need no sir that will help make disciples out of them a tape can disciple it can train it can help us to understand this great book but we need deliverance we need somebody who raises up in authority and says you fou demon from the pit of Hell come out of that woman in the name of Jesus Christ and you don't want to do that in proxy you want to do that in full Authority any anybody with me yes you don't want to say in the name of the one that Paul preached about you don't want to say in the name of the one brother Brandon preached about you want to be known in that realm as well that you're a Jesus man you're a Jesus woman and because of that you have authority to speak to the mountain you have authority to speak to Darkness and it does not have you don't have to negotiate with it you speak the word that's why that Fellowship is so vital and so important important and that's why winning this mind battle is so vital and so important because we have all the authority we need right now it's just laying in us it's not more power we need we have all the power we need we just need to get all the distraction out of the way and come into perfect fellowship with him we need to understand that that you can't drag somebody else into the tent of con of con [Music] you may have had a best man at your wedding I'm going to get plain you may have had a maid of honor at your wedding and they served their purpose and they and they helped with the planning and they stood up with you but but but let me tell you something there was a time that you said goodbye Henry what did they did they throw rice or let butterflies go did you all do any of that but oh excuse me she doesn't know know me tell her I'm just a nut bubbles tiny little bubbles there came a time that the bubbles came out that was a signal the bride and groom are out of here best man you staying clean up we're going on now when Benjamin and Jenna left the left the venue where they got married in Texas there were it was already Nightfall there were sparklers I was a wreck I couldn't even enjoy it because I could just see a big long uh head of hair going up in in in Flames I even said to some of the ones around me I said hold your hair back pull it back I I wanted to say some of youve got enough uh hairspray and things like that in it you'll be like a torch when you when you throw the rice when you let the butterflies go when you when you send those tiny bubbles in the air it's a signal that you've done your part thank you for coming God bless you all who we're out of here there's nothing wrong with that that's the way it's supposed to be that's the way it's designed to be and you're not going to drag somebody along with you it's just you and the bridegroom I'm telling you in order to find that perfect Fellowship we're going to find that we can't take our pastor in with us we need a pastor we needed a prophet messenger but you can't take him in he can't go in there with you it's a place of privacy it's a place of intimacy it's a place of communion it's a place of fellowship and too many of us are missing it too many of us are missing it in our life because we're a drift we've let things come along we've pulled up our anchor we're still trying to figure out what we're going to call ourselves how we're going to classify ourselves are we going to be former Amish are we going to be Bible Believers are we going to be message folks come on brother what kind of ID ification are we going to look for we got to be something you know people ask all the time what kind of church you go to and they want you to say Assembly of God Church of God Emanuel Holiness they want you to give them some label and so we have learned to accommodate them and we start telling them well um I I follow the ministry of of of of a prophet and I and and we've lost them why don't you try to say I'm a Bible believing Christian saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire got my foot on the Rock and My Mind Is Made Up I know more now than I've ever known before by the grace of God and in the right time you can tell them all the things you know and where you found it and who bless bled you and who helped you and who revealed it all to you but I want to tell you something now sometime people say well what do you believe they say well you know I we don't believe in women wearing this and we don't believe in women wearing that and we don't believe in the women and they say oh my you're pretty hard on women huh and we don't know what to say because it's like we give all the men a free pass we've even Twisted marriage and divorce so bad into such a into such a monster that the men are given a free pass oh it's quiet let's keep it on the word let's keep it on the word they're not interested in your they're not asking you about your convictions they're not asking you about they see that's why they ask you in the first place they saw that you were different they didn't go up to the Jezebel and ask ask her where she went to church they don't care where she goes to church they've already got what she's got they touched out reached out and touched you because they saw that you were not like everybody else around you so let this be your opportunity to point them to the living reality of Christ the word and that he's no longer just a page he's no longer just a 2,000 year old savior he's now a living reality living inside of the believer she that believer is not born from down here anymore we have a new birth I've got to hurry we're born from above let's go on we need a Revival of breaking up Souls on fire for God what I mean on fire is down at the altar with tears r running down their cheeks not for 5 minutes and get up and forget it but out trying to win the Lost back to Christ again a burden on their heart I don't know who the again is referring to it could be referring to both it could be referring to the one that had never known Christ it could be referring to the Christian who had temporarily laid down the burden for souls and now they're out telling it again I want you to know the best thing that you can do to witness to somebody is live the life live the life nobody cares if you jump when you go to church just just know for sure you're going to live as high as you jump isn't that right nobody cares if you dance nobody cares if you run nobody cares if you rejoice in the Lord you have every right to praise the Lord somebody said do everything but but jump up and down don't don't do that that's like the modern church let me tell you something I've been jumping a long time way before I knew anything about what was going on in the modern church for every counterfeit you grab a hold of a live wire and let's see if you can continue to act like icicles it's a hard issue now I'm I'm going to preach now turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 3 and 4 your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of bael peor for all the men that followed by elpor the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you verse four but ye that listen but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God you are alive every one of you this day God destroyed those who followed the way of balum who followed the influence of balum to whoredom and idolatry he destroyed them all but you that stayed close to the Lord you that cleaved under the Lord little bride we've got to stay right up under Papa Eagle now we can't avoid to get off too far on our own little Affair our own little journey our own little thing you got to stay right up it's close to Papa Eagle as you possibly can did you know God designed that eagle with five primary feathers on the tips of his wings that mother or father eagle has the ability to do what most birds cannot do and that is he has the ability like the joints of your wrist come on to take those five primary feathers and begin just like that cir oh I can't do both at the same time am I am I doing it am I doing it wow thank you for the clap cuz I found myself doing different ways they have the ability to rotate those five primary fingers and it creates a centrifugal force in Hebrew it's called Nasha it is a a wind that is created and what happens is when Papa or Mama Eagle are are out on test flights they've already been knocked out of the nest they've already learned to do some flight lying but they're getting a little too big for their britches sometime and they stray too far mama or Papa Eagle will just fly right over the top of them and rotate those five primary feathers creating a centrifugal force that literally pulls that little straying Eagle hear me anybody here right up under Papa's prote chest I'm telling you tonight little bride wherever you are whoever's watching this I'm telling you that we have a tendency to get a little far away from Papa sometime we need to find our place as close to his chest don't criticize John it is listen not John in the Bible or John petersheim don't criticize them because they have a desire to lay their head you know I grew up in the Holiness Church a a and there was a lot of fire then and it wasn't all smoking mirrors there was some real fire did you ever see Wildfire a lot of it but I didn't let that distract me because I knew that the real fire was also present right you just got to make sure that when you're watching the fire you're not looking at the reflection remember what brother brandom said the night the pillar of fire came down in the Tabernacle and and took what he had written on the board and and put it on the wall of the church you go back and listen to that the people scream you can hear them as they begin to react as they begin to see that image transferred on the wall do you know what brother random said I'm not quoting directly but but this is what he said you go back and listen to him say it directly he said no no no no no not there that's right he said that's just a reflection right there and he pointed them in the right direction and they could then see what the pillar of fire had done God vindicating a word but most of the people didn't see until somebody pointed it to them until he said no no no that's the reflection look there there it is they were excited about the reflection that was not nearly as clear and they thought they were looking at the real until he told them no no no there it is look there he said that's how we do he helped us understand don't get distracted by by the reflection you find the real that's right don't be satisfied with a painted fire when you can meet the real wand [Applause] yeah cleave let's look at the word cleave but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day I'm hurrying this is me hurrying the word is cleave it's Hebrews in the strongs uh 1695 in English we would say debec it's a clinging to be United you that cleaved unto the Lord your God you that claimed you clung until you were United it means to hold to to hold fast to cling to to touch to cause to stick to you who got stuck not fly on the fly paper not Mouse in the glue trap but you as a sincere hearted believer you were spending so much time with Christ The Living Word because you need to invite him into your Bible reading you need to invite him into your prayer time did you know you can be sitting there and reading the book about him and missing the fact that he wants to be there with you his divine presence real you you may think the only time you can feel the presence and the quickening of the Lord is when you get in a corporate Atmos spere I want to tell you that's not my most genuine moment I'm not here today still standing after all of these years because of what I had experienced in the church that's it's because he has met me in the prayer closet he has met me with my Bible in my lap he has met me when I was hearing the prophet on the tape you can't leave out fellows [Music] ship intimacy with Christ the preachers get together and we argue over interpretations whose book is it and are they open or not open and are they all revealed or not revealed are they all fulfilled some fulfilled and not all fulfilled did Christ fulfill the Passover with his birth or with his death I could give you a list of aund more things that I've been in meetings with preachers and we found lots of things to argue with but there's one thing that we never hardly ever experienced was the reality of fellowship with the Living Word because as soon as you start squabbling I'm sorry I I'm sorry that somehow I picked the wrong message for tonight something you just can't relate to perhaps but I've never SE the only time I ever saw it is one time at the old church in Columbus we were having a little business meeting I I I think they're just about of the devil oh it brings out something in people sometime have you ever flown on an airplane lately you know and and those little agents that help you you you would think that some of them are some of them are so kind and so humble but you would think that some of them trained under Hitler you give them a little authority and oh my how they you you you give people a little authority sometime when you're talking about business and people will show you a spirit you didn't even know they were capable of and we had a little argument one time in the back of the church years ago before I was married a lifetime ago and it was over how many telephone lines we were we were subscribing to because in those days we were hooking up families and churches on the telephone hookup and some only had a a a a a thought of of of what we had to have and I've always been a bit of a Visionary and I've always believed that it was better to have a little more than you need then not enough when you need it so we were really having a time you know what I should have done I should have just ordered the lines and paid the bill but we wanted people to feel apart and and you've never heard it must have went on an hour and we didn't let the kids or the teenagers come in to theit I'm so glad they didn't see and hear all of that but when we finally ended and we we had to go through the sanctuary to leave what we didn't know was a prayer meeting had been going on in the sanctuary and the young people had called on the Lord and he had come to to their rescue and they were fellowshipping with him all over the room some laid out under the power of God some encountered enough of him they had gone into another language some were rejoicing and some were weeping and some were had stammering lips and oh my how do the adults who were fighting how do they walk through that untouched we couldn't you see your kids your grandkids in the spirit in prayer and what do you do you get right down beside him and pray through yourself and it turned in an argument in the back turned into a Revival in the front we need a little of [Applause] that we need a little of that again we're slipping some of us are drifting some of us have let problems cause us to lift our anchor just a little bit from the F solid foundation some of us have picked up the spirit of a Critic hear me Lord shake your neighbor just kindly gently wake them up wake them up they we're not here tonight to sleep I tell you what when I'm done in just a few minutes and we're down there eating dinner sleep then you have my permission to sleep then not now we're not in the Amish church tonight where most everybody sleeps we're not there no no no no no no we're awake tonight because we want to make sure that we haven't fallen off the rock we want to make sure that we haven't let some argument or some distraction or some misunderstanding come on now we want to make sure that we haven't got caught up in the politics and missing out on our fellowship you know I'm just deser just sensing I should say I'm just sensing in my spirit that somebody here tonight has fallen under a little bit of that Spirit of a Critic not not particularly here you've got plenty to criticize here but I mean something you just kind of brought along with you and maybe you're sort of looking for the perfect environment and you're looking for Perfect People well well I want you to know you're never going to find that like that because if a church is nearly perfect and you join it you're going to affect the track record you need to get listen this is the key to overcoming in the end time some of you have heard me say this many many many times number one three keys three keys three important powerful steps to overcome number one keep your eyes on Jesus and off of people number two keep your eyes on Jesus and off of people number three keep your eyes on Jesus and off of people I I believe it I really believe it brother I really believe that we slip off because we've got our eyes on somebody else don't get them on your pastor don't get them on the Deacon don't get them on the neighbor don't get them on the prophet get them on Jesus see how many times you can tell somebody Jesus said Jesus said Jesus said don't be just a parrot be somebody who's had an encounter who's had Fellowship not once in your lifetime once a day twice a day three times a day there's a bride who's been called to walk in the spirit to keep her head I got to close I want to be stuck to this word yes sir like a glue like an adhesive the rest of that definition to cause to stick to like an adhesive to be stuck together oh God stick us to you let us be so stuck to you w excuse me Glory I want to be so stuck to him I want everybody to know that I have been stuck to him that means where I go he's there watching over he hears what I say he knows what I think because he's with me you you've got a choice will will you will you make up your mind to stay anchored or will you drift in Ruth chapter 1 ver14 I didn't give that to them but I I thought I would bring it in because this has uh this has a thought that God gave me so many years ago that has certainly stayed with me and some other people there was a time of making a decision will we will we stay in Moab or will we go back to the land of of Bethlehem the the land of children's bread and there were two daughter-in-laws both of them widows now Naomi the Mother-in-law Ruth Ruth and orpa the daughter-in-laws they both loved Naomi they both loved their mother-in-law that isn't that a wonderful thing to love your motherin-law God help us all we should do that they really love Naomi and it came Time to Say Goodbye and they lifted up their voice and wept again and Ora kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth but Ruth clave unto her hear me it's easy to kiss and leave it's harder to stick around it's harder to say no no no no no your people will be my people it is wherever thou lodgest I will Lodge wherever you lay down I will lay down whatever you eat I will eat come on I'm not just going to kiss you and tell you how much you meant to me I'm going to be where you are withs soever thou goest I will go come on now you're God how powerful your God your God these are moabites women your God a pagan woman a gentile woman you might call her a trinitarian on now one who didn't know the god of Israel except the God she had seen in Naomi and Naomi was nearly backslid living over there in a Strange Land but she knew that Naomi had connection to something that was realer than what she had connection to and so Ruth said no no no I'm not going to kiss you and turn back if I never have a husband if I never have a church home I'm not in any way going to say goodbye I'm going where you go I'm going to be so close to you you'll step on me if you turn around because I when you get restored to your inheritance and she wasn't looking for the natural she was looking for the spiritual I'm going to be right there I'm not just going to kiss and leave I'm not going to kiss and turn back I'm going to stick to You Like Glue who in this house is going to make up your mind tonight to stick to the word to stick to Jesus Christ Like Glue nothing is going to I I don't mean that you're backslid I don't mean that you have have rejected the Lord I don't mean that you're not born again I don't mean that you don't walk in the truth of the I don't mean that but if we neglect if the righteous are scarcely barely are you here yes sir hardly saved where will the Sinner and ungodly appear Moses is speaking in Deuteronomy 3 and I'm going to say a few more things in Deuteronomy 4: 3 and 4 it's Moses talking they've come out of Egypt they've got a lot ahead of them and he said your eyes have seen what the Lord did down there because of ba peor for all the men that followed bael peor the Lord thy God that destroyed them from among you but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day well I want to know what happened in B peor and I don't have much time left tonight to talk about it but I'm not leaving just yet I want to give you just a little bit in Numbers 22 23 24 three chapters read it balum a prophet a real Prophet a genuine Prophet who got his eyes off of the God who called him and got his eyes on the paycheck he got his eyes on the paycheck and he was hired by by a moabit king bailo and bailo tried multiple times to get balum to curse Israel and and balum tried for the money but God wouldn't let him and God forced him ha God forced him to prophesy good he must have been deeply concerned about his paycheck and however when the cursing failed balam advised Moab and Midian to corrupt Israel both the tribe of the moabites and the tribe of the midianites to come in and corrupt Israel from within notice that phrase from within not not outside influence but get right in among them infiltrate their camps become like them uh uh make yourself friendly until they invite you to stay a while hospitality is a good idea but you ought to know what you're doing on when you keep moabites around when you keep midianites around right balam's Council LED Israel into idolatry and fornication at bpor numbers 31:16 I think you have it let's see how quick we can go behold these caused the children of Israel through the Council of balum to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague not on moabites not on midianites but the plague fell where on the congregation of the Lord balam instructed baac to use women and idolatry as a trap for Israel leading to the events that took place in b El pure Revelation 2:14 red letter Jesus talking he said but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of bam right who taught bailo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed to unto idols and to commit fornication all manner of sexual sins pornography self-gratification all the things that are taking people captive right in the church house come on so even without a television even without a computer even without a telephone the devil is still the devil the Israelites listen this ultimately cost balam his life God's going to deal let me tell you he doesn't need you to bring the Justice it's not your job amen it's his job despite being a prophet who heard from God balam chose the path of compromise and deception for personal gain his actions led to the deaths of 24,000 Israelites and eventually he himself was killed when Israel defeated Midian in numbers 318 I won't take time to read it the Israelites were camped at Chaim they were seduced into idolatry and immorality by the moabit and midianite women they ended up listen they laid down with a heathen and got up worshiping a false god I'd like to preach that for two hours you can't lay down with the world you cannot lay your head in Delilah's lap and still hope that the spirit of God is going to stay with you these men laid down with the these horish women of median and Moab and the next thing you know the scripture said they were worshiping the god they were worshiping their gods the false god of bael right in pure that provoke the Lord to anger brother bandam says in 65 does God ever change his mind about his word do I have 10 15 minutes good and here we find out that balam went down there and he began to teach the people and he had an error and he run in the way of balam how that he did he and taught bailo and the children of Israel committed adultery now the Bible said they committed fornication brother vom said they committed adultery what are you doing you're trying to point out somebody's Miss oh no no no no you see they were married to God oh yeah so their sexual sin with one another was fornication that's right but the biggest sin was not the sexual act that they committed the biggest sin was that they had already sold their heart to another God and they were stepping out on their bridegroom it's right it's absolutely right he said uh the children of Israel committed adultery he goes on and a plague struck the nation of Israel the people and thousands of them died in one day 24,000 and while they were all there before the altar of God praying still religious still going through the motions still doing churchy things just a minute I'm going to help myself Amen brother Amen brother that's exactly right they they were they weren't out in The Honky Tonks and the hell holes of the world why they were standing now at this moment 24,000 of their loved ones have dropped dead they're they're thinking that maybe we've made a big mistake but not all of them because in the midst of an hour that they should have all been on their faces before the altar of the Lord uh look what happened they were all there before the altar of the Lord praying here com an Israel it man with a minonite woman he took her right into his tent brother the random types that to uh to to spiritual things and and he said a denominational woman and went into the tent you hang around that stuff long enough even you who have been free from it you hang around it long enough your wife will want to do like their wives somebody said but there's a great Revival there there's a great Revival there there's a move of God there there's something going on there be careful because you hang around it too much your children don't want to do what their children are doing is that okay to say it's too late he said went in there with a denominational woman and went into the tent let's go on and the priest son walked over there the grandson of Aaron Phineas phas in Hebrew not Eli's son Phineas another Phineas the grandson of Aaron the first high priest he said and the priest son walked over there and took a javelin and killed them both and that stayed listen that stayed God's Wrath before you take out your Javelin you need to know that we're not living in that dispensation that's right God doesn't need you to get Vengeance for his nameen be not deceived God is Not mocked for that which a man shall so he shall vengeance is mine amen sayeth the Lord but God was so moved by the passion God was so sick and tired of sick and tired Israelites come on God was so tired of lukewarm Israelites that when he finally saw one with a backbone he said that's enough stop the plague come on you ought to be that one not the one that listen the scripture is pretty pretty graphic the javel and went right through them both the scriptures clear to even tell us it went came out of the woman's belly skewed them right there in the tent and immediately God stopped the plague that is not what God is calling you to do he's not calling you to execute Vengeance in his name however he is asking you to be cons consumed with the Zeal of the Lord to be consumed with the Zeal of the Lord's House where is his house not this building don't let that be your passion only I believe in church I believe in being faithful I believe in keeping this place as nice as we possibly can I believe in that but my passion is not for this brick and mortar building no my passion is for the house of the Lord in you and I we're the temple know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and and you destroy that and God will take care of you that's what the word said oh help us now help us now killed them both but what happened balam he succeeded in weakening Israel I don't uh pretend to know it all I have heard enough and seen enough to know that there's been a lot of weakening among those who once stood in the strength of the word and called Jesus on the scene there's been an even a weakening in this body let me uh show the house to the house there's been a weakening Among Us our passion for fellowship with him is not what it has been you thought it was quite a minute ago watch it now and it it disturbs me greatly because I have observed firsthand what happens if one generation Falls away from the faith of their parents amen the next generation is more likely to fall even farther away and farther away and farther away if you people some of you precious people that have come out of various places we all came out of something if you've come out of various places I know it was not in your heart to find the world you came out because you found greater truth and that's that makes you a Bible believer I'm telling you that proves you're a Bible believer it proves you were more than a church member a church member will stay with its church until it sinks a church member will stand back and watch their Church die on the vine and won't leave because Granny is buried in the backyard oh I'm coming down you've stirred me now I'm coming to you right granny is in the backyard five generations of people sitting in a dead church because they gave granny a grave I've seen it I've seen it well I couldn't leave there I couldn't come out of there because they gave my granny a grave get her yeah come on you go get you a permit and get her and take her somewhere else if that's the only way you can get out of dead cold formal religion Joseph said don't you dare leave my bones over here when you go in take me with you can you imagine what they look like this bunch of Israelites with camels and donkeys andp and and and Egyptian mummies plant me in the land of my promise plant me don't let anything hold you back and that's why you're where you are that's why you've moved where you've moved into spiritually is because there was nothing so precious to hold you in truth that was for another hour or another stage in your life and we have no we shouldn't spend our the rest of our life criticizing where we came from we should thank God that he led us down that way let me tell you something some of us are tougher people stronger committed people because we went through so much Church stuff we sat under Bishops and denominational systems and prejudices and yeah it ought to made us stronger not weaker yes so here's a a breakdown uh quickly again Israel God's people his chosen people his elected were lured into these relationships with these Pagan women until God sent a plague among them 24,000 people died and it would have continued it would have continued on until it nearly took them all had it not been for one man that said enough is enough is enough is enough is enough here we are trying to get back to God here we are standing before the altar of the Lord just hoping that he will move among us again and what are you doing you're in the tent with a horish woman from a Pagan religion instead of coming to the meeting where you might would have gotten a little help what are you doing you're in the tent having your pleasure and he said no more I I would really preach this but I know that some of you have a tendency to go overboard and so I don't want to be guilty of putting a javelin in your hand I don't want you to think you can win this thing by physical amen the violent taking it by force is not a physical violence it's a desperation and a determination that says you're not getting my promise you're not getting my Heritage you're not getting my inheritance I'll wrestle you down you foul Spirit of hell I'll kick you right where you need to be you won't you will not be able to pull me out of that I'm not going to slip away I'm not going to are you here yes I'm going to put my anchor down well we're closing in a moment let me just give you this one quickly honey Follow Me Oh Lord just once more hot springs did you know the Roman Catholic Church was first the Pentecostal Church it taken it 2,000 years to get in the condition it's got today so when you hear the Catholics say we're the original Church brother brandom was a proponent of that idea he said you could say that the original Catholic I don't know that we could say Roman but the original Catholic was the first church the Roman system kicked in much later and it took 2,000 years to get it in the condition that it's in today but now brother bram's not preaching in a Catholic Church he's preaching where Believers are hearing a fresh men message and what does he go on to say I'm closing eventually he said if this Pentecostal organization what if we left off the word Pentecostal would that be tampering with the word what if we just said for for instance if this organization keeps on another 50 Years it'll be worse we've already got our icons we've already got our pictures and we've already got all of the little things that we love so dearly in another 50 years I hate to think what some folk would end up to be there's got to be a bride she's here there's got to be a bride there is a way back if you have let things drift by you if you have raised your anchor just a little bit let me tell you something leaven it only takes a smidgen do you know what that means some people say a smidge it only takes a smidge to get the whole lump leavened it it only takes a smidge of compromise and I'm not talking about compromise from man-made rules I'm talking about compromise from Biblical Holiness that's what we've got to be standing on biblical Holiness women like women and men like men we've got to stand on that because that's what the word says and we've got to be careful that the distinctions are so noticeable and so evident that there is no no room for for speculation and we've got to make sure that there's not enough compromise mixed in with it that the next generation will fall farther from the mark because if we're drifting what of our children what of our grandchildren if Jesus terries and I'm going to close with this musicians are coming true sign that's overlooked he said whatever you do don't you forget my words let this anchor God take an iron pin and engrave it in your heart that you won't forget it don't forget it thus sayeth the Lord I'm not here to tell you tonight about thus saith the Lord it's going to sink through the to the bottom of the ocean that's another one and I'm not here to tell you tonight any other thus sayith the Lord not tonight but this one he said this is thus sayeth the Lord return to God would you just gently look at your neighbor and just say it's thus sayith the Lord return to God with all your hearts yes return to God with all your hearts whatever you do return to God with all your heart if you are drifting if you realize that some troubles came some pressures came some in influences came and you you didn't you didn't take up anchor you know the difference you just lifted it a little brother as soon as that anchor comes off solid solid contact you're at the mercy of the Waves you're at the mercy of the element oh Jesus oh Jesus I wanted to preach something to encourage your heart I wanted to preach something especially you firsttime visitors I wanted to make you so happy that you would just smile like a a mule eating briers but he wouldn't give it to me that way we can we can all kiss we can all you know do the religious thing and say oh I love the Lord but are you glued to him are you cleaving to him are you clinging to him do do you do you rondevo with him every other week or every Sunday or twice a week and then you don't have anything to do with him the rest of the time if that is the case I want you to know you're drifting come on that's right come on somebody needs to tell you I it may not make me your friend or popular but I need to tell you that if you're only meeting him at the Gathering Place if that's the only time you have fellowship with Christ is when you get in the presence of other Saints you're living low way Beneath Your Privilege he's an everyday God I cannot live today I tell him every day I can't live today without your presence I don't have to dance all the time I don't have to shout all the time I don't have to talk in tongues all the time but I need to know that somewhere on the other end of my kite stream yes even when I can't see him and even when I can't hear him I need to know by the tug how many of you have ever felt that tug you got down on your knees to pray you could feel the tug on the other end of the line you you you you heard a message you said I'm going to hear a whole message I'm going to hear part of a message and you sit down and you say Lord speak to me listen we should always do it every time you open the Bible you ought to talk to the one who give you the word the author of the book you ought to say Lord come and make this real to me today I don't want to just read words I don't want to just recite words from a page I don't want to just quote something with with no life attachment I I know that my my answer is is to abide in the life of the vine and I want you to come and break this with me I want you to come and Quicken my heart with the reality of your words let your words of life oh yes Lord oh yes Lord Jesus Oh yes Lord Jesus you're either anchored or you're a drift when people leave a old-fashioned gospel preaching group they make the ugliest Sinners they make the most awful looking Sinners a woman that's never painted doesn't know how thank God she doesn't even know how and so when she gets free she calls it she doesn't know how to keep anything in moderation she she ends up like a clown that's not Freedom that's sinking you're sinking you're sinking you're either anchored or drifting your confidence the Bible says casting not away your confidence we're supposed to trust and have confidence in in our ministers and in our leaders and of course we are but if your confidence is only in flesh you may catch us on a bad day because we have them sometime I I've I've sat beneath the Juniper just like every other preacher Mondays are the wor worst you hear like a mocking sometime of everything you preached the day before it's like a cackling of the enemy in your ear why did you say it that way h no one was listening anyway every one of us have had that juniper tree moment we we've had the the the gourd Vine moment thank you Lord Jesus every time you send a worm to crack me on the head with a gourd and said now get out from under the shade of this thing this place of depression and prostration and get out there and do what you were called to do what you were born to do some of your living I know you I know you look Godly I know you're precious I know you love the Lord I'm talking to New Hope as well as anyone else I know that you're precious people people you're you're you're you're the cream of the crop but if you're not anchored you're drifting you need to search again for the light of that or Lighthouse you young people especially I'm telling you I know you're always preached that I know young people really really sometime become a Target I want you to know our hope is in you our confidence is in you we are depending on you to stand for truth you are the generation bombarded by the discrepancies and the lies and the mockings of this whole world and and you you're following a dead man and all the things you must fall in love with Jesus so that if you ever discover that your Prophet was a man Elijah was a man subject unto like passions as we are and yet he prayed that it wouldn't rain and guess what it didn't rain if you ever discover that your Elijah was a man you want to know that you are so deeply rooted in your fellowship with Christ your anchor has hit the solid rock your anchor is not on the church age book your anchor is on the living reality of the word you saw Jesus some of you in a way you've never seen him before because he was raised from the pages of history and made a living reality again he healed the sick rais the dead and he wants to do it through us you see there's a promise for the little end time bride maybe you're not holding on to it anymore but there's a little girl in Ohio who is there's a little girl that says didn't you say didn't you say that go are we drifting or are we anchored every one of us who were here and heard brother John give that testimony of his little daughter none of us have ever been able to forget it it shamed us all everyone really if you think about it her faith stronger than ours I'm sure she has faced as a child many moments of discouragement and disappointment that it hasn't been that it's not what but listen she's counting on us and we're counting on her we've got to stay with everything we've got anchored on this rock because God said he would send that last move just one last move for the bride for the bride not a public show not for the church at large Not For The World At Large his elect one more quick powerful work spoken word Authority that's creative ananas and safiras all around he said it he said it now many of our folk have decided that it's all happened and we we've missed it somehow there's been you know one Miracle out of a thousand cases and and and that must have been all there was but I I'm not in that boat I'm sorry I need to tell you I'm not in that boat I happen to believe that when this little bride goes out of here yes there'll be a quick short work with her it'll bring hard cases in it'll cause some backsliding lukewarm people perhaps to get stirred but why don't you stir your your down let's stand my boat of Life sails on a troubl sea whenever there's a wind in my sail but then an unexpected storm derive me sorry from the heights when the breeze turns in to a gale oh I know the master of the [Music] wind I know the maker of the [Music] rain he can come the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the wind verse one again sing this with me my vot of Life sails on a troubled sea whenever there's a wind in my S but I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into a gale let me hear you sing Oh do you know him I know the master of the wind I know I know the maker [Music] oh he can calm the storm I know I know the master of the [Music] wind sometimes I soar like an eagle to the sky among the Peaks my soul can can be found but an unexpected storm may drive me from the heights it may bring me low but it cannot bring me down do you know the master I know I know the master I know the master I know the the maker of the rain he can calm the storm Cal and make the sunshine oh I know the master before we pray sing that verse again sometimes I soar like an eagle to the sky and among the Peaks my soul can be found but an unexpected [Music] storm it may drive me from the Heights OH it may bring me low but it cannot bring me down because I know the master I know the M of the Wind I know the maker I know the [Music] woo he can calm the storm make the [Music] sun I know know would you sing it again with conviction do you know him I know I know the master I'm swimming back toward [Music] him I've let some things drift by [Music] me I've let my fellowship get a little affected but I'm calling on the master tonight I'm calling on the master tonight Lord everything I I let slip by me while I was in some kind of a stuper every message that I was too numb to hear every every move of the spirit that I just couldn't participate in because of where I was mentally I I want to recapture I want to drop my anchor I I've got caught up maybe you're you're caught up family drama Church politics even something has pushed your boat a little off course you don't have to spend all night you're not lost you're just in need to stop the drifting and let your anchor drop I I I wish that somebody tonight would make up your mind I'm putting the anchor back on the Rock I'm not going to let a fence drift me I'm not going to let what people think about me drift me I'm going to find the Solid Ground again I'm going to stand on the word and watch God keep his promise in my life if you're here tonight and you'd say I've just gotten a little off course somehow in my faith I'm not contending like I was once contending I i' I've gotten a little satisfied just just just slightly a little bit out of sorts and I want to be anchored I want my anchor to grip the solid rock of the word like the song we talk about sometimes in times like these if you feel that way I don't want to persuade Ade you this is not a denominational altar call but if you feel that way tonight I wish you'd just come and join those of us who are here to worship I wish you'd just get out of your seat if you feel comfortable doing so no no no even if you don't feel comfortable what what am I talking about this isn't your living room you you feel comfortable in your living [Music] room if if you feel the need just to say to him with you're coming I I I'm going to drop it I'm going to drop my anchor just a little little harder tonight I'm going to find the course I'm going to ask the Lord's Mercy the some of you have let some things slip back that you once cast off and you've let them slip back into your life and Cloud your judgment and affect your fellowship with him no matter what it is he knows how to calm that storm he knows how to break the spirit that's trying to affect your fellowship if you believe that say Amen let's call on him together right now I can't pray for you but I'll pray with you father we are gathered here tonight with a determination to stand firm on your word word we don't want to be thermometers that only reflect the condition of those around us we want you to help us to be thermostats we want to be so in tune with you so fiery with passion for your word that we affect the atmosphere around us let them see Jesus in us let others who are weary and who are struggling and who are oppressed in their mind let them see his light in me and let it cause them to swim their way back to safety Lord we lay before you every decision that we have made that has a ected our our anchor and we ask you to give us Grace tonight to correct our path to correct our course give us spiritually The Passion of Phineas the Zeal of the Lord there is a plague in the world but there is a plague in the house of the Lord and and one man and one woman sold out one who will go beyond Lord that's all it takes one who cries out one who will not let the sun go down without fellowshipping with you and communing with you one who will refuse to go two or three days without connecting they would never go one or two days days without water or one or two days without food and yet so many of us can live a half a week and never open the Bible never hear the message of the hour never even call on your name God help us tonight we don't want to be bound by structures of religion and and be and some sort of forced Behavior but we want to be filled with such a passion and love for you that we want to spend time with you that we're not doing it because we have to we're doing it because we want to help us loose this house and those who have chosen to worship with us tonight loose us break feathers and yolks as we stand in your presence we're not asking for some physical demonstration we're asking you to reach down in our lives Lord and reset us re-calibrate us tonight let a passion that once burn burn again let a Zeal that once consumed us let it consume us
