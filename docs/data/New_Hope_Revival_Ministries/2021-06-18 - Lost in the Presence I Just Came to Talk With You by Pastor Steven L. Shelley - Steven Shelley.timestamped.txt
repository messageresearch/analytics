[0:09] if i
[0:09] told you i've seen something
[0:14] that nobody else could see
[0:21] and if i told you that the angels
[0:27] have been talking
[0:33] would you merely think me foolish
[0:37] that my senses i had lost
[0:44] no i'm just lost in the presence
[0:49] of the sweet holy ghost
[0:52] i'm just lost in the presence

[1:35] if you're scared of my salvation
[1:39] then you'd better not get close cause
[1:42] i'm just
[1:43] lost in the presence of the sweet
[1:47] holy ghost i'm just lost
[1:51] in the presence of the sweet
[1:54] holy ghost and he's drawing me closer
[2:00] to the one i love the most
[2:08] [Music]
[2:19] now if you think i'm out of order
[2:22] cause i can't stay in my seat
[2:26] and if you think it's just blasphemy
[2:29] cause there's dancing in my feet
[2:32] well i can hardly hear you
[2:35] [Music]
[2:48] in the
[2:54] [Music]
[3:02] is
[3:08] [Music]
[3:16] in the presence of the sweet
[3:19] holy ghost
