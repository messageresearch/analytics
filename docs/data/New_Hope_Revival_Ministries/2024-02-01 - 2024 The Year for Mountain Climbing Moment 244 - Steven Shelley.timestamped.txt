[0:00] on December the 22nd of last year I had
[0:03] an experience with the Lord in the night
[0:07] and in that experience I was told that
[0:10] this was a year 2024 on the Gregorian
[0:14] calendar a year for mountain climbing
[0:17] well I like that it's not always
[0:21] positive what we hear sometimes it's a
[0:22] little bit you know brace yourself but
[0:25] but I think mountain climbing sounds
[0:27] good are you with me and then the voice
[0:30] spoke and said be very
[0:34] surefooted you got to know where you're
[0:36] standing somebody help me you've got to
[0:38] know what you're standing on every now
[0:41] and again you better check the
[0:43] foundation make sure you're still
[0:45] standing on the word it's not OP pinion
[0:48] that we're going to stand on in this
[0:49] hour come on it's not the doctrines of
[0:52] men but we're going to stand on the
[0:54] whole revelation of Jesus Christ did you
[0:57] know that Genesis to revelation is the
[1:00] revelation of Jesus Christ he's revealed
[1:03] in Genesis just like he is in the book
[1:05] of the Revelation he is there and he's
[1:08] not just a historical god of the book
[1:11] but he's a living reality in the heart
[1:13] of the believer in this hour I ask a
[1:16] question in this experience how will we
[1:19] remain
[1:21] surefooted I need some help how do we do
[1:24] that and I heard five statements being
[1:27] made and in those statements I heard
[1:30] them in the voice of the person who had
[1:33] spoke these things into my life the
[1:37] first voice I heard was a mentor of mine
[1:40] a man that I respected very much who has
[1:43] gone to be with the Lord so many years
[1:45] ago now and he was speaking back
[1:49] something that had been poured into his
[1:51] life and the phrase was whatever you do
[1:55] keep your balance in the scriptures I
[1:58] don't know any better at VI than that we
[2:01] can't get off on some tangent somewhere
[2:04] we've got to bring the balance amen and
[2:07] and if it's in the book it's true are
[2:09] you with me if it's in the Bible it's
[2:11] true but you don't want to build a big
[2:14] Doctrine on an isolated few words you
[2:17] want to run it through the continuity of
[2:20] the Bible come on now you want to run it
[2:23] all the way through as the old preacher
[2:25] said from kiver to kiver that's from
[2:27] cover to cover and when you do that
[2:30] you've got a Doctrine to stand on Amen
[2:34] and and sometimes we make too many
[2:36] assumptions by what we read you don't
[2:38] have to make any assumptions from
[2:40] scripture when he the spirit has come he
[2:44] will lead you and guide you when the
[2:47] spirit of Truth has showed up in your
[2:50] life he will help you to make your way
[2:53] through traditions on but I have a
[2:57] mandate and you have a mandate in this
[3:00] hour keep your balance in the word in
[3:04] the scriptures then the second thing I
[3:06] heard was a from a great man of God who
[3:09] had one of the most impactful Ministries
[3:12] that this nation and around the world
[3:14] really has ever seen and that was a a
[3:16] healing evangelist I believe more than a
[3:19] healing evangelist but a prophet and uh
[3:21] his name was brother brandham and I
[3:24] heard the voice of brother brandom
[3:25] because his ministry has spoken to me so
[3:28] much through the years I heard his voice
[3:31] very clearly saying whatever you do stay
[3:35] in the middle of the road that's the
[3:37] highest point that's right if the road
[3:40] is made properly it's higher in the
[3:42] middle and it it it Slants slightly
[3:45] toward the edges so that all the debris
[3:48] Will Will just sort of come floating
[3:50] down when a good rain like we've had
[3:52] lately just washes not I tell you to
[3:55] wash a gully right down your driveway
[3:57] won't it the kind of rain that we been
[3:59] having and then the third voice happened
[4:02] to be a woman that had some influence in
[4:04] my life and and as I've told you before
[4:07] God sent me many years ago and said I
[4:11] will give you a word for her and I will
[4:13] give her a word for you you do believe
[4:15] in Prophecy don't you we are still
[4:17] living in the New
[4:19] Testament and uh so her name was Ruth
[4:22] Hein some of you may have heard of
[4:24] sister Ruth I've quoted her many times
[4:27] and uh she she was a missionary and uh
[4:31] she did a tremendous work in the nations
[4:33] of the world she was the third voice
[4:35] that I heard in this experience and if
[4:38] you've ever heard her voice you'll never
[4:40] forget it she had one of the most unique
[4:43] voices that I've ever heard in my life
[4:46] and uh she she spoke in this in this
[4:50] experience something that I had actually
[4:52] heard her say and had read in a book uh
[4:56] the first book I ever read that that she
[4:58] wrote and and and it's part of how God
[5:03] is helping us to remain surefooted in
[5:05] this area praise and worship is a very
[5:09] important part of keeping our balance of
[5:12] staying in the middle of the road and of
[5:14] keeping the channel of Revelation open
[5:16] between Papa and our hearts do you
[5:19] understand uh so she simply said
[5:23] praise until the spirit of worship
[5:26] comes worship until the glory gory comes
[5:31] and then do what stand Glory stand in
[5:34] the
[5:39] glory
