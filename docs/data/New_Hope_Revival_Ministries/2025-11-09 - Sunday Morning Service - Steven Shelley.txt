Blessed be the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is no other name &gt;&gt; but the name Lord Jesus Christ. Let him be exalted. &gt;&gt; As we go to prayer today, we know that there is salvation in no other name but the name the Lord Jesus Christ. It is through and by him that we have healing for our physical bodies. And I'm so thankful that it just doesn't it's not just for our physical body, but it can be for our mind, our will, our emotions, everything that we are going through. By that name, there is healing and deliverance and help. Do you have a need you'd just like to make known by the lifting of the hand? We want to remember brother Austin and sister Anna. Their children are both sick today. We want to remember them to the Lord. Ask the Lord to minister health into their bodies. &gt;&gt; Always remember to no matter what's going on that's always hold her up. Believe that God will give her victory through every situation. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there are many requests that have come in uh while we were gone. So many people said, "Remember me. Remember me." We might not be able to recall all their names at one time, but God saw everyone. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he does. Because if if someone has enough faith to ask you to remember, then their faith is in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I know he's able. &gt;&gt; Yes. Also remembering Sister Lydia, Sister Alfreda. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother and Sister Wgner. Remembering them to the Lord. Sister Judith, will you sing this course as we're getting ready to pray and take these needs to our papa? &gt;&gt; Remember David and Ashley's little ones, too. That Lord will give them a complete victory. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Any other sickness through the body given for &gt;&gt; total deliverance. &gt;&gt; Sing this course with us today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come Holy [singing] Spirit. &gt;&gt; I need you. [singing] Come sweet [music] spirit I pray. [singing] Come in [music] your strength and your power. [singing] Come [singing] in thine [music] own gentle way. Brother Daniel, will you come and pray today? Come, [singing] Holy [music] Spirit. I need thee. Come, [singing] [music] sweet spirit, I pray. Come [singing] in thy strength [music] and thy power. Come in thine own. Oh Lord, as we approach you this morning once again, it's so easy for us to see so many things that we have to be thankful for today. The greatest thing, Lord, is that you come by and you spend time with us, Lord. That you would take up your abode with us and that you would dwell within your people, Lord, desiring that you would move on the behalf of the needs of your body. All the requests that were turned in, Lord, not just for the physical well-being, Lord, but the mental well-being, the soul, our souls. Lord, we need you to minister healing. We don't want to be like we were though Lord. We want to be what you want us to be. We desire today to hear the word of God in clarity. We ask you to come with great uncction, with power, Lord. We know your word has authority and that not one word of it spoken can return to you void. And we're asking Lord that today as we sit under the hearing of the word that our lives would be transformed. That we would mature in you Lord. We would be adults Lord God. We don't want to stay forever on the sincere milk alone, Lord. But we want the meat of the word. We want to know all of you, oh God. We want to hear everything that you have for us. We want nothing to be left undone or hidden. Oh God, we believe you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that there's nothing that you can't do. There's no power that you're not above. So we surrender our will to yours. We surrender all our will. We ask that it be done in earth. Oh, in this flesh, oh God, in this dirt that I'm made of. May it be done in this earth as it is in heaven. Your will. And we'll glorify you for what [music] you're doing. We'll testify, Lord. We'll keep our globes polished so that the light of you can be seen by the world. and we'll give you all the praise as we ask it in the name above all names, Yeshua Hamashiach, our Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; We give you the praise. Hallelujah. You may have your seats today. We're so happy to see the number back up today to see you in the house of the Lord. We're happy to welcome the newlyweds, Brother Steven, Sister Lydia, back to the service [applause] after being married last week. Brother Gary and Sister Donna, we're glad that you're doing better and that you're able to be in the service today. God bless you both. Michael and Crystalin and the babies doing better. We're glad that they're back in the house of the Lord. [applause] All that were sick, if I pass over you, I'm sorry. I'm glad you're here. &gt;&gt; This friend that sister Rebecca has with her, Hyong, I believe is her name. We're glad that you're here today. God bless you. [applause] I hope I got that right. We're glad that you're here. We're glad for every one of you. Those of you that are watching by way of stream, we're glad that you're in the house uh in the house of the Lord at your house by by watching this service being a part of us and what the Lord is doing here. We're just blessed to have our pastor home and very blessed to know that the Lord touched his body and that he is feeling strong in the Lord today that he'll be able to preach to us. [applause] Thankful for it. Praise the Lord. We want to receive the tithe and offering. We want to give to the Lord. He has blessed us. He has provided for us. Uh Brother IAS, I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm going to ask you and brother Austin to go to the people today to give let them give to the Lord. Sing this course. How great is our God? How great is his word? He's the greatest one that was ever heard. &gt;&gt; As we're receiving the tithe and the offering, how great is our God? [singing] [music] How great is his word? He's the greatest one [music and singing] that ever was heard. He rolled back the water of the mighty Red Sea. And he said, "I will lead you. Put [music] your trust in me." How great is our [music] God. How great is his word? [music] He's the greatest one that ever was heard. He rolled back the water of the mighty Red Sea. [music and singing] And he said, "I will lead you. Put your trust in me." How great is our [music] God? How great is his name? [music] [singing] He's the greatest one. Forever the same. Forever the same. [music and singing] He rolled back the water [music] of the mighty Red Sea [singing] and he [music] said, "I will lead you. Put your trust in me [music] once again. How great is our God? [singing and music] How great is his word? He's the [music] greatest one that ever was heard. He rolled back the water [music] of the mighty Red Sea and he said, "I will lead [singing] [music] you. Put your trust in me." [singing] Oh, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. You may have your seats. Once again, I would like to give two public service announcements. &gt;&gt; We've got cold weather coming in. Not so much tonight as tomorrow night. Make sure you undo all of your hoses. I don't know that it'll be cold enough to let a faucet drip, but it'd be wise to undo your hoses. And as you feel led, let your faucet drip. Put some heat on. It's going to be cold down into the 20s. So, that's the first public service announcement because we don't like to fix water pipes. Uh the other one is I felt very sad on behalf of Brother Jerry this week when I found out that he's been with us for quite some time and he just found out about the table app. And so many times you will hear us reading quotations from brother Brandham. And those of you that may be new among us and don't realize on your phone there is an app that you can get to listen to any and all of Brother Brandham's messages. And it's called the table app. And I don't suggest you search any farther than that. But uh because you'll find all kinds of garbage. But the table app will allow you to listen to all of Brother Brandham's sermons. And if you wish to, you can follow along because they're all transcribed and it will allow you to read the sermon with it if you are so able to do. But I I just wanted to make that uh announcement to those that may not have been aware because you don't have to go to YouTube. We have some of them uh on the our app, but not all of them. And a lot of the older ones from the 50s may not be on our app, but you can get all of them on the table app. And it makes it so convenient to be able to listen in that manner. And so with that, we're turning our hearts toward the preaching of the word. I believe that the Lord wants to speak to us today. He has something for us. Something that will help us in our journey. Would you stand with us? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Let's have Jacob. I know he hasn't practiced and we didn't warn him or anything. Let's have him come and sing a song before we go to the word. &gt;&gt; All right. [laughter] You're on the spot. This is your Like I said, I didn't get to practice and uh I had COVID last week and uh still trying to get rid of that. So, y'all pray for me, but I believe he'll give me the strength to get through it. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Well, get up. I get up. I get up in Jesus name. The Lord is calling daily for those who would be saved. Well, don't go down defeated when your victory's here to claim. So get up, get up or get up in Jesus name. [music] In that city called beautiful, there laid out in the street, a poor and lonely beggar who was crippled in his feet. As John and Peter passed him, [music] they saw his need was bad. They had no gold or silver, but they gave him what they had. So get up, get up, get up in Jesus name. The Lord is calling daily for those who would be saved. Well, don't go down defeated cuz your victory is here to claim. I get up. Get up. I get up in Jesus name. [music] In this world that we live in, there's evil everywhere. The body gets discouraged and overcome with fear. Well, God needs his some soldiers to take out of him and take back the power that John and Peter used. So get up. I get up. I get up in Jesus name. The Lord is calling daily to those who would be saved. Well, don't go down defeated when your victory is here to claim. I get up, get up. I get up in Jesus name. Well, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up in Jesus name. The Lord is calling daily to those who would BE SAVED. WELL, DON'T go down defeated when your victory is here to claim. So get up, get up, get up in Jesus [music] name. World that we live in, there's evil everywhere. My body gets discouraged and overcome with fear. What God needs is some soldiers to get out of your pews and take back the power that John and Peter used. So get up. Get up. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; Get up in Jesus name. Now the Lord is calling daily to those who [music] would be saved. Don't go down defeated when your victory is here to claim or get up. Get up. [music] Get up. &gt;&gt; I get up in Jesus name. [music] I get up &gt;&gt; get up. Get up. &gt;&gt; Get up. I get up in Jesus name. [music] [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You You passed You passed the audition. Wasn't that lovely? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You can do that again. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. It's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Really enjoyed that. &gt;&gt; Uh Jacob has come a long way from the little boy that he was to be a a grown boy. That's all I'm willing to say just yet. We don't want them. We don't want anything beyond that. You need to work on my mic up there, somebody. Okay. But anyway, we're very glad to see you in the house of the Lord. And I can't express to you enough how thankful I am for your prayers. Very, very thankful. They'll keep working on it till they get it. The Lord really touched me. You know, sometimes we begin to get over something gradually, &gt;&gt; and we we're thankful, &gt;&gt; but there are times when the Lord moves. I mean, he really moves to heal. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's still a healer? &gt;&gt; I I believe all healing comes from the Lord. &gt;&gt; And um I had one of those moments on Thursday. &gt;&gt; Took a while, but it it shifted so quickly. that I knew the Lord had moved for me and I appreciate it so much. Uh and he gave me strength. I had been so weak and uh he gave me strength and I want him to receive all the glory &gt;&gt; because I didn't have any medicine. I would have taken anything I could have if id had it. But the Lord did it. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate your prayers for all of us while we traveled. We're very happy to be back. But we really enjoyed ourselves in Indiana. &gt;&gt; Indiana is a beautiful place. Uh I personally wouldn't perhaps desire to live there, but I sure do love looking at the beauty of it. The farm country, the beauty of the trees this time of year. It is the goodness of God that lets us see these things. Yes. &gt;&gt; When I walked into the church there uh among the former Amish brothers and sisters on Friday evening for the rehearsal and I saw the beauty of the place, the surrounding of the place, the out outside, the neighborhood so to speak, where it was, the beauty was inspirational. But when I went inside and saw this church that has been raised up for the glory of God, &gt;&gt; knowing that they have met many times in homes and barns and wherever else that they could meet and if you know about the Amish faith itself, you know they don't have church buildings and they go from house to house and they bring the benches with them and they push the furniture back and they have church uh in homes and So the fact that God has brought them so far and then turned around and blessed them not only with a comfortable place but with a beautiful place, &gt;&gt; I couldn't keep the tears back. They just they formed and I just said over and over to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; And uh they're some of the most wonderful and precious people I have ever known. And we appreciated our time with them. And Pastor Isaac is an outstanding brother and his family, they are precious. We love to hear you sing here on Sunday when you lift your voices and it just echoes through this room. But I'll tell you, I think last Sunday uh they they had us beat. the the volume of the singing was so loud, so full, so many people participating that it just almost lifted you off the floorise. &gt;&gt; And uh Josh, you must have felt some of that or been because you sent me some of it. He he he caught some of it, captured just tiny little clips of it. I was uh standing on the front row with Pastor Isaac and his family and his little children and they were singing. Oh my. I I thought I thought the window would crack and it was so amazing that I just watched them. I just couldn't help it because they were singing with their whole being. Praise God. &gt;&gt; They were making a joyful sound. It wasn't a noise to me. It was a joyful sound unto the Lord from the littlest one to the biggest. And I just turned around and I looked out over that wonderful crowd of people. Not only the local congregation, but those that had gathered for the great celebration of Brother Steven and Sister Lydia. and so many different faiths represented. But everyone worshiping the Lord in a similar manner. He's worthy. &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful for the family of God in Cookamo, Indiana. Brother Dewey Moss, who we should remember his wife, Sister Minnie, to the Lord. She's in the hospital. She is not well. He was actually able to be in the service with us last Thursday night. Uh, a packed little house. And I I just won't take the time this morning to tell you some of the things that the Lord did. You don't always know in a service what God is doing, but when you begin to hear later, it was so wonderful to be in church with Jonathan's two sisters and and it felt warm. It felt beautiful. It felt healing. It felt right. And you would have to know our story and we ain't telling it to know what a miracle it was. And and they said, "Can we get our picture with you?" I said, "Are you kidding?" Absolutely. And and it's just a miracle what God can do &gt;&gt; and how he can bring things together. I I want to serve him every day more and more. I want to love him more than I've ever loved him before. I want to be used more than I've ever been used in these last days. &gt;&gt; I know that brother Gley did a fine job. I haven't heard all the services, but I know that he did a fine job. You were wellfed. You were protected. You were kept good. &gt;&gt; And I thank you for that. Your faithful service. [applause] I didn't have to worry. And we're just grateful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Let's thank the Lord for these musicians, the leading of the service. Can we stand for the reading of the word today? I want to read you again from Mark chap 16 verses 15- 18. These are mostly red letters and uh it indicates to us that these are the words of our Lord and the words of our Lord should be exalted and held in preeminence above all else. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Jesus should get the highest praise. &gt;&gt; He should be the most the most often name on our lips. &gt;&gt; We should sit down and talk about him. We should get up and talk about him, walk talking about him, eat talking about him, because he's worthy to be talked about. &gt;&gt; I don't know everything there is to know about him, but I love what I know &gt;&gt; and I want to know him more. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen and really mean it? &gt;&gt; I want to know him more. I know this. I know he hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I know the same God that gave mana in the wilderness, he's alive today. The same God who parted the Red Sea, he's alive today. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; If he ever did it once, he can absolutely do it again if he chooses to. &gt;&gt; I am not a secessionist. I don't believe that he has lost his power. &gt;&gt; I believe he can do today anything we have the faith to believe him to do. &gt;&gt; I I I'm thankful that he opened blinded eyes. I believe he still has the power to do so. You you ought to be amen and big loud. &gt;&gt; He still has the power to do so. &gt;&gt; If he ever healed one marriage, and I know he has, he can still heal a marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's ever supernaturally provided for for your financial need or anybody else's need, just made a way where there was no way, he can still do that. If he can put the tax coin in the mouth of the fish &gt;&gt; and then allow the disciples to catch the right fish &gt;&gt; with the right coin &gt;&gt; to pay the right bill, &gt;&gt; the right amount, he could still do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can. &gt;&gt; Uh nothing wrong with working for your money. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But even that sometimes is not enough. &gt;&gt; And he can stretch. Mark chapter 16 and verse 15. Let me say before we forget that next Sunday we will after the morning service we will gather at the fellowship hall for a celebration of thanksgiving and we will have a meal either later today or tomorrow. My wife will put out the the list and you can sign up for what you want to bring. And we were supposed to do it this Sunday, but so many things happened with the funeral in Minnesota one week, the wedding in Indiana the next week. We just didn't get it put together in time. We wanted to have a little space between because we knew you do a lot of Thanksgiving celebrations and you might be tired of that kind of food. Too bad. Next Sunday we will celebrate together. &gt;&gt; Uh someone said, "Well, you could just skip it." Well, there's a lot of things we can skip. We can skip your birthday &gt;&gt; and mine, but we're not going to miss giving God thanks. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the good news, &gt;&gt; the gospel, &gt;&gt; that Jesus is alive &gt;&gt; to every creature." every creature. Notice the word, he that believeth and is baptized. This isn't the apostles talking or the church leadership talking. &gt;&gt; This is our Lord. &gt;&gt; You have to act on your belief. You must do something to act to obey what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We look at the ABCs of the faith. accept Christ. That's the A. B is believe. &gt;&gt; And C is what? &gt;&gt; Confess him. &gt;&gt; You've got to do something here in cooperation, in participation. Not that that is what saves you. His blood, his grace saves us. But we accept it by doing it. &gt;&gt; Did you follow me? &gt;&gt; And so he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. But he that believeth not shall be damned. Doesn't matter how many times he's baptized. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't believe, then these signs and these signs among others &gt;&gt; shall follow them &gt;&gt; that believe. &gt;&gt; The secession movement says, well, [snorts] yes, he did this in the formation of the early church, but he he doesn't do it again. And this is another dispensation. This is another uh a time of church history. The administration is different. I don't believe that &gt;&gt; to me. He's Hebrews 13:8 &gt;&gt; the same yesterday and today and forever. And these signs shall follow them that believe &gt;&gt; in my name. &gt;&gt; In my name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah. &gt;&gt; In my name shall they cast out devils. Anybody know that there are devils that need to go? &gt;&gt; They shall speak &gt;&gt; with new tongues. They will sometimes speak a language that they have never been taught. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it might be a known language to other men. And the scripture said sometimes it might be the tongues of angels, &gt;&gt; heavenly languages, &gt;&gt; but one of the signs of believing and being baptized and being saved as a believer is that in my name, he said, they'll cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick &gt;&gt; and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not recognize the sovereignty of God here, but the sovereignty of God is shining in Mark chapter 16. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you take up a serpent, it says they shall. But if you should take up a serpent like the apostle did, &gt;&gt; God has the power and authority that you might just shake that viper off. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture said. And uh I don't think we should be tempting or testing or you know I know in Appalachia there were those who drank a little strict nine and put their hand on the fire and took up a rattlesnake. Oh no no no no. Being a holy roller myself I know what it means to be accused of these things but I've never been guilty. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if I had if I should be in a situation where I had to protect someone else or something else, wouldn't you want to believe for the faith to grab that serpent and throw it away? &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "This sounds too supernatural." There you go. &gt;&gt; There you go. We serve a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; They shall take up sallall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick &gt;&gt; and they shall recover. Has anybody ever seen in your Christian life any of these signs performed in your life or someone else's life? I have. &gt;&gt; I have. &gt;&gt; I've seen with my own eyes cancerous tumors fall off, &gt;&gt; broken bones mended. &gt;&gt; Come on, God. &gt;&gt; I've seen what God can do. Unstoppping deaf ears. &gt;&gt; Amen. These things, the signs and wonders and miracles are not to be the emphasis. When you make them the emphasis, then it is as though you are somehow reducing the main thing. &gt;&gt; The main thing is the gift of salvation &gt;&gt; through the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we thank you that you do not change. &gt;&gt; And although your seasons and times and church ages may change, you are ever more the same. And yes, we have prayed for those who you chose to take, but we always have taken the opportunity to remind others and ourselves that you're still a healer. &gt;&gt; I've watched you snatch men and women from the very jaws of death. &gt;&gt; And I know that you are ever more able to do the same. And every time you redeem a sinner and bring them out of a life of bondage, that is a miracle. &gt;&gt; That is a sign. That is a wonder. When you break addiction, when you heal a marriage, when you deliver those who are crippled with anxiety, these are demonstrations of who you are. &gt;&gt; Come to us today. expand our understanding as you reveal and make yourself known to us and we will glorify you. We will exalt you. We will lift you up because you have told us that in the lifting there is a drawing. &gt;&gt; The context is the cross. If I be lifted up, &gt;&gt; but the reality is even beyond 2,000 years ago. Yes. &gt;&gt; In this hour, if men will lift your name and give your word preeminence, &gt;&gt; there's a drawing power. &gt;&gt; There's a pull that takes place that draws us up into who you are. Oh Lord, thank you. Help us in this time in the name above every name. Bashim Adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated." In Mark 16, two more verses 19 and 20. So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, this helps us to find the context. The context is the same context here is the same as Acts chapter 1. This is the ascension. This is our Lord's going up into that other realm. His earthly work in a corporal body finished for that moment. It says after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was what? received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God, which is the right hand of power and authority, the invisible spirit of the eternal the eternal spirit, the father manifestation of who God is. And he doesn't have a human form. When he chose a human form, he was the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Is that what the scripture said? You're very familiar with John 1. &gt;&gt; So he's sitting now at the right hand of power and authority. And they went forth, these who heard the sermon of the Lord. They went forth. And what did they do? They obeyed what he told them. &gt;&gt; They preached where? &gt;&gt; Everywhere. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. Grocery store. &gt;&gt; I guess that would have been the shook the market. the the the tent makers business wherever they were, they preached the good news, the gospel that Jesus Christ has the power to change lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To deliver the oppressed, the Luke 4 commission, which is the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, the spirit of the Lord is upon me. Amen. And this day, he said, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. It's fleshed out the promise of one who would come and set captives free, give sight to the blind, open prison doors, bring healing to the bruised and the afflicted. This was the prophecy of Isaiah. And our Lord is standing there that day reading as was his turn to read. H he's reading the very prophecy of himself &gt;&gt; by God's design. &gt;&gt; And when he finished, he's supposed to go and sit down and be extremely quiet &gt;&gt; because there will be another reading to follow in second temple period synagogue worship. But instead, as he goes back to sit down, he speaks out and he says, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. What Isaiah prophesied 700 years before has now become a fleshed out, &gt;&gt; a fleshed out reality." That promise is walking around. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. among you today. That's a what a powerful thing for him to say. &gt;&gt; And they began to marvel. Is this Joseph's son? Isn't this one of the hometown boys? &gt;&gt; Well, something has happened to him. &gt;&gt; There's an authority in his words. &gt;&gt; I guess there is. &gt;&gt; This was who he was. &gt;&gt; The word made flesh, &gt;&gt; dwelling among men. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they preached with the Lord doing what? &gt;&gt; Confirm. &gt;&gt; The Lord was working with them. &gt;&gt; I I thought the Lord was just caught up into heaven. &gt;&gt; Did Didn't it say he was received up into heaven? And now it says those apostles, they went out and they began to preach the good news of the gospel. And somehow there was cooperation. from another dimension. &gt;&gt; Jesus, who had been received up into the heavens, now positioned at the right hand of power and authority, was somehow working with his representatives on the earth. He was working with them. &gt;&gt; How many of you would find that a privilege &gt;&gt; to be working with the Lord? WELL, THE APOSTLE PAUL tells us in more than one epistle that that's exactly what we must do. &gt;&gt; We are to participate with him in the works of redemption. &gt;&gt; He has given us a ministry of what? Reconciliation. &gt;&gt; And he has called us to be co-articipants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With him in the works of redemption. Oh my. And though we don't see him in the physical body that he dwelt among men in, we know he's here. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; How How can you say such a thing? Because he lives in us. &gt;&gt; What is this? Who is this living? It's him. It's his spirit. It's his life now living in us. And the Lord was working with them as they went forth and preached everywhere the gospel. And guess what else he did? &gt;&gt; He was confirming the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what the word amen means? &gt;&gt; It means so be it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Every time you hear a promise and you say or uh think, but you you can't help the preacher, encourage the preacher by thinking amen. &gt;&gt; But you can encourage the preacher by saying an amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the power of agreement. &gt;&gt; When you say amen to the word, you're not only saying that is the truth, you're saying something else. &gt;&gt; You're saying that's my truth. &gt;&gt; I have heard it. I have believed it. &gt;&gt; I have received it as my truth. This is not just information to me. It has been quickened. It has been given life. &gt;&gt; And I believe it. It's now a part of who I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; That very life of God. The the apostle said the life that we now live, it's not the natural life that we received through the birth of our mother. That's not the life that a believer is living anymore. &gt;&gt; You you may not understand that your life source has changed. But when you become a new creature in Christ, your life source changes &gt;&gt; and you are no longer living the natural life that you once lived courtesy of your mother, your father, and the gift of God, his breath. &gt;&gt; You're now living another life. The life that I now live is not my own. He said, &gt;&gt; but it is the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It is his life. It is his spirit. It is his quickening power &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; now living in us. &gt;&gt; So he's not only working with us and we're working with him. Somebody said, "No, no, no. This was only to the original 12." You know how I know that's not true? Because they were already dropping off. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some already had to be replaced. That's why they were gathered together in Acts chapter 1 in the upper room. &gt;&gt; They were gathered there to conduct the business of the kingdom which was very small at the time. &gt;&gt; And there were some disciples that had to be replaced. &gt;&gt; So now if it was only to the original apostles and now there are at least two that need to be repositioned and that would happen many times down the way. Uh and and and so are you saying then that only the original or are you saying only the successors of the original can have this? Or would you believe that the scripture is careful to tell us that if we accept this truth and believe it &gt;&gt; and act on it, &gt;&gt; we can also receive the same authority. &gt;&gt; So there was no ceasing. I want you to know there was no ceasing of God's power and ability. He doesn't diminish. &gt;&gt; He doesn't diminish. He's steady. He's rock solid. &gt;&gt; He's faithful. Somebody say faithful. &gt;&gt; Faithful. &gt;&gt; Has there ever been a time that he was not faithful? Never. &gt;&gt; Because he is he is the word. &gt;&gt; So he is dedicated to the fulfillment &gt;&gt; of who he is. not what he is, &gt;&gt; but who he is. &gt;&gt; You'll laugh at me when I tell you that I I I spent several hours on Friday uh working on one word. I I was captured by the misplacement of a what that should have been a who. I I went home and I wanted to I I I I love Friday dinner with my family, those who who got to be with us and but I was still under the influence. Have you ever been in a moment of studying God's word that you find yourself under an inspiration? Something otherworldly. &gt;&gt; That's how it's supposed to be. Oh yes, for preachers. No, for believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; A and I don't have it every time I read or every time I study, &gt;&gt; but when he comes in a particular way to to put a little more Isav, &gt;&gt; a little more isav in my eyes that I could see a little brighter and a little clearer. And uh I've told you about these floaters. How many of you have ever dealt with floaters in your eyes? Well, I I'm tired of mine. I'm ready for them to go. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm tired of swatting what's not there. &gt;&gt; And they're constantly moving because your eyes constantly moving. And said, "Well, hold your head steady." Well, that don't mean your eye will stay steady. &gt;&gt; Come on. So, when when your your eyes, you know, when that happens to me and I realize it's a floater, I will find myself doing like this. Well, that doesn't change the floater. But somehow it helps you to feel a little better and sometimes you notice it less when when when your vision is is dim. When you first wake up in the morning, maybe you're not seeing quite as clear as you will when you wash your face real good. That's still a good idea. &gt;&gt; Uh and you're and and and here's another one. When when you're when you're trying to read something in fine print without your glasses and your eyes are wearing out a little and and you're trying to adjust your head to see it better, instead of putting your glasses on, you put your glasses on, say, "Wow, there are words on that page." When God puts a little of that is sav &gt;&gt; spiritually in our eye &gt;&gt; and we say it's more than just a blur to me now. &gt;&gt; It's getting clearer all the time. &gt;&gt; And we can only be transformed by what's clear to us. &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's this theme around the movement that says, you know, just believe it anyway. Believe it anyway. Well, you can try that. &gt;&gt; You can try that. But I want you to know that that kind of belief, a blind belief will be tested &gt;&gt; and tested &gt;&gt; and tested. &gt;&gt; But once it becomes a reality, a living revelation to you, are you telling me that God has obligated himself to make his word a living revelation or reality to me as an individual, a non-pastor, a non- preacher, &gt;&gt; to all of us? He wants you to see him. &gt;&gt; And the way that he reveals himself in this hour is through enlightened. Through enlightenment, &gt;&gt; enlightenment. &gt;&gt; When the word becomes all of a sudden bright in your inner being. And you say, "Wait a minute." &gt;&gt; And so the Lord and I, we went round and round and round about a a what that should have been a who. And you say that couldn't possibly make a difference. I want you to just think for a moment. I'm not going to speak this today, but I want you to think for just a moment. Uh uh uh the the the it's it's a neutral it's a neutral word. What? But but who is a personal expression &gt;&gt; or whom? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. meaning not pertaining to an object but of &gt;&gt; an object. And you would be surprised how clarity can come in the understanding of the godhead when you recognize that in some situations a what could have been. Should have been. &gt;&gt; Are you going to tell me should have been? I just did. Should have been a who. [clears throat] Because what a lot of people don't know about your King James version Bible is that there are italicized words &gt;&gt; in the verse. &gt;&gt; You you can look in your Bible. I don't know if it shows up that way in the in the apps or not. I've never really looked at it that close. Does it? They say it does. There are atalicized words. And when you're looking at a literal translation of the verse, there will it won't make a whole lot of sense. Sometimes it'll be reversed. the words will be reversed. And so the translators put in it atalicized letters words that were added for clarity. Don't panic. You needed a two to o. You needed an a. You needed a who. You needed a what. You needed a that. You needed a whom. Because if you're only looking at the major words in a verse of scripture, it sometimes would really I don't think people would read it that way very often. They just say, "I just can't get through it." &gt;&gt; So, we're not in any way criticizing. This is this is a beautiful thing, &gt;&gt; but it's not so beautiful to me when you see an italicized word and by the discretion of the translator, they made it a what? when it should have been a who. And that would be determined by the subject. &gt;&gt; What are we talking about? Who are we? Are we talking ABOUT A WHAT? ARE WE talking about a table? Are we talking about a gift on the table? Or are we talking about a whom? &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, we're referring today to a who, a whom, &gt;&gt; a personal. A person, not a thing. The Holy Spirit is not a what, &gt;&gt; is not, &gt;&gt; nor is he an it, &gt;&gt; but a whom. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus is talking, it can make such a difference when you understand that that spirit didn't come as an article, as a what, as as a a an an object. It came as a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. the life he said uh that this life will be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if this same life, this same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, it shall also quicken your mortal body &gt;&gt; if it dwell in you. &gt;&gt; And that's not a what. &gt;&gt; THAT SPIRIT IS A WHO. &gt;&gt; It's a whom. YEAH, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S THE same spirit. &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said, you've seen me. You have also seen the father &gt;&gt; because he resides in me. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't think I cannot believe you have spent 15 minutes on what's and whose." And you're not even going to give us the punchline. Hold on. It'll come. &gt;&gt; But you'd be surprised the tail spin you can get in and you're thinking, "My my if just a what if just a who would have been chosen in a talis? I think it would have been a lot easier to understand that this is not another &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but the same. &gt;&gt; Anybody can get a little confused on that. You'll see that in a moment. I want to read another portion of scripture to you in Luke chap 10 and verse 19. And I know what is happening to the time. Behold, I red letter again. Behold, I give unto &gt;&gt; you. Now, is he talking only to those in hearing, in person, in presence, or is he talking about to all who hear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for as long as they shall hear, &gt;&gt; that's whosoever will. Yes. &gt;&gt; Behold, I give unto you &gt;&gt; power &gt;&gt; to tread on. Now, I like this. I'm not I'm not going to be taking them up. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; But I like to walk on them. &gt;&gt; Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions &gt;&gt; and over &gt;&gt; all the power &gt;&gt; of the enemy. And nothing, &gt;&gt; no nothing, &gt;&gt; that's what nothing is. No thing and nothing shall by &gt;&gt; any means &gt;&gt; hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't mean you won't have hurt. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you won't have pain. &gt;&gt; Brother Greley told us last week, you're you're being pressed, &gt;&gt; but for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The dye is being cast. &gt;&gt; You're being pressed into the mold. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So that you come out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, an et t. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You've got to come out an &gt;&gt; a smaller version of &gt;&gt; that's what the word says. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not new age. That's not new apostolic reformation. &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture tells us. Behold, I give unto you power. Tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing, no nothing shall by any means hurt you. &gt;&gt; The Amplified says it this way, "Behold, I have given. I have given." [clears throat] Because that really is the tense of the Greek that is used here. I have, meaning the power has been secured. &gt;&gt; I don't have to go get this power. It's already gotten. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying, "I have it &gt;&gt; and now I have given it to you. I have given you." And I love this. I love the fact that both expressions of the English word power are used here. Both meanings, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I have given you authority, &gt;&gt; which is exusia, &gt;&gt; and I have given you power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is dunamis. I've given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions and physical and mental strength and ability over all the power that the enemy possesses and nothing shall in any way harm you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, the harm that is being spoken of here is is a harm that we need to understand. And and the hurt that is here in King James is a hurt that we need to understand. We're not talking about a momentary hurt or a fleeting passing harm. &gt;&gt; We're talking about an ultimate hurt. &gt;&gt; An ultimate harm. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What in the world do you mean by that?" Jesus said, "All that the father hath given me, &gt;&gt; wish you'd help me. &gt;&gt; I have them." And he said, &gt;&gt; "All that the FATHER HAS GIVEN ME, I have them. I've inscribed them &gt;&gt; in the palm of my hand. &gt;&gt; And no man, &gt;&gt; nothing &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; shall pluck them &gt;&gt; out of my hand." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, what does the hand represent? Power and authority of God. &gt;&gt; I'm holding you. be say saying in the power and authority of God I'm holding you. Jesus is saying you're in my hand &gt;&gt; and nothing is ultimately going to be able to pull you out of my hand. There's only one thing that can separate you and our fellowship &gt;&gt; and that's an act of your will. &gt;&gt; But even that does not change relationship &gt;&gt; your your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be running in the other direction, but Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "You're mine." &gt;&gt; You may have slid in and slid out and slid in and slid out until you don't know which which way you're sliding now. In or out, &gt;&gt; up or down? Am I in? Am I out? Am I closer to the Lord than I've ever been? Am I farther away from the Lord than I've ever been? Sometimes there's so much movement in our fellowship with him that we don't know exactly where we are. But here is the key. Yes. &gt;&gt; Whether you're sliding in or whether you're sliding out, if you're in his hand, &gt;&gt; whether you've fallen and you can't get up, whether you're standing tall and straight like a cedar of Lebanon, if you're in his hand, &gt;&gt; you may find temporary hurt. You may come in contact with momentary harm &gt;&gt; but ultimately you won't be harmed. &gt;&gt; Ultimately you can't be hurt because no man, no disease, NO THING, NO CIRCUMSTANCE, NO BAD MARRIAGE, &gt;&gt; no abusive situation, &gt;&gt; Jesus can pluck you, &gt;&gt; can remove you from my will, from my hand. &gt;&gt; It's the sovereignty of God. Mark 16 reveals again the sovereignty of God. And Luke 10 reveals again the sovereignty of God. Doesn't mean if a bee uh uh uh stings you, it's not going to hurt. &gt;&gt; Boy, that'd be great. We know that by the demonstration of of mature love, perfect love, that you have some authority over some of these kinds of things. We've seen demonstrations of it in scripture. And one generation ago, &gt;&gt; hornets, &gt;&gt; sent in the other direction by demonstration of love. You don't really believe that, do you? I actually do. &gt;&gt; You're just a fanatic. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; I'd rather be registered among those who believe every bit of it. &gt;&gt; I want to believe it. I want to believe every comma. I want to believe every every jot. I want to believe every title. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every vowel mark. I want to believe it &gt;&gt; because it is the closest expression that we have of the reality of who God is is revealed in his word until it gets in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's fighting its way back to flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the ultimate goal. What house? &gt;&gt; What house will you build? Are you awake? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I think some of you are. And that's all that matters. That's enough. Let's let's let's go on. And so it doesn't mean that you're you're not going to while my wife was minding her own business some years ago and and and pulling some dead uh dead stems off some gerbra daisies in the in the garden and uh here come a caterpillar. If you've ever seen these caterpillars with a green blanket on, it looks painted. It doesn't even look real. It don't move like a real thing. And she didn't even know she had come in contact with it, but her body knew it. &gt;&gt; And she became ill in a hurry. The pain severe in a hurry. And and all of a sudden, it had come. I never heard her say one time, "God doesn't love me. The word don't work." &gt;&gt; Right. When I when I hit my toe on the end of the bed uh on my way back from the bathroom, I never get THIS THOUGHT. IF GOD JUST LOVED ME MORE, that wouldn't even hurt. The Bible said no hurt would come. This is not what he said. &gt;&gt; There's going to be trials. &gt;&gt; There's going to be beastings. &gt;&gt; Anybody here? &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE FLAT TIRES. YES, &gt;&gt; there's going to be viruses and and and uh all kinds of things that are going headaches. &gt;&gt; I would have never created one. Would you? &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME. THAT DOESN'T MEAN no harm, no hurt, no test, no trial. It means ultimately nothing, &gt;&gt; is going to be able to take you out &gt;&gt; of your relationship &gt;&gt; with redemption. Some things affect fellowship. &gt;&gt; Laying out a church will affect your fellowship. &gt;&gt; Robbing God in your tithe will affect your fellowship. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change your relationship. &gt;&gt; You've been engraved. Oh my. I remember the old time preacher, I heard it with my own ears, who was preaching one night on having your name engraved in the hand of God like the Old Testament speaks about. And it dawned on him. He he said he was had been in the service and he was a holiness preacher and he wasn't one of those modern tattoo Christians, you know, who comes to the Lord and and still wants to put all this ink on their body. But he had this. He had it in the service. He wasn't serving the Lord. He kept the best he could. It covered up and you can't always do that, but he did. and and and and he thought every time he said every time I'm dressing I remember that to me he said to me I remember what I was doing under what influence I was under &gt;&gt; when I put that anchor on my arm &gt;&gt; I wasn't sober &gt;&gt; I wasn't living a good clean circumspect upright life &gt;&gt; and every time I see that it doesn't drag me back there &gt;&gt; but it reminds me Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Would I get rid of it if I could? He said, "I would, but I I that's beyond me now to make that happen. So, I just I just cover it up." &gt;&gt; This is the same thought. &gt;&gt; He's preaching on a little longer and he talks about my name is engraved in God's hand. He said, "No matter what I do, I can't forget uh that I had another life. There was an old man that lived in me cuz I look down and I see it on my arm." But in the same manner, &gt;&gt; God can never forget me. &gt;&gt; He said, I just thought of this. He said he couldn't forget me if he wanted to. He doesn't want to, but if he wanted to, HE COULDN'T BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY engraved me. &gt;&gt; IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY time he moves his hand, he remembers me. &gt;&gt; This is metaphorically, but I'll tell you to those of us who know better, it is reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. He cannot forget us. &gt;&gt; He cannot forget the backslider. &gt;&gt; The scripture said so. &gt;&gt; So fellowship's broken but relationship remains the same. Now when we look at the word power in Luke 10:19, "Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and so forth." Would Wouldn't that sound to you like dunamis? It sounds like dynamite. &gt;&gt; That's where we get our dynamite from. The Greek word dunamis, which is explosive, strength, capability. Uh, and I'll give you a few other words to go along with it in a moment. I'm not quite ready for that, but hold it close. Uh you would think that that was power from the Greek word dunamis, but what you find out is that it's power from the Greek word exusia. And I want you to look now at the at the uh from the lexicon what exusia means because Jesus said, "Behold, I give unto you exusia." translated here as power. Authority is the meaning. I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. Authority. Somebody say authority. &gt;&gt; It means right. Having the right to act. Jurisdiction. I like that. &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm giving you jurisdiction over all the powers of the enemy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THEY MAY SERVE ANOTHER MASTER, &gt;&gt; BUT I'M giving you authority over somebody else's servant. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you power over serpents and scorpions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you jurisdiction. I'm giving you permission to act. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the ability or strength with which one is &gt;&gt; endued. &gt;&gt; Does that remind you of anything? Acts one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Try here in Jerusalem until you be &gt;&gt; endued. &gt;&gt; Endued &gt;&gt; with power from on high. I'll show you that one in a minute. &gt;&gt; Endued. One who possesses authority. The sign of regal authority. That's royal. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I like this one. This is my favorite of of all the definitions. Exercising a state of control over something by legal rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Somebody say power of attorney. &gt;&gt; Power of attorney. &gt;&gt; You can have a power of attorney. Of attorney. &gt;&gt; Power of eternity. Yes. That's right. Too. You can have power of attorney. legal rights to conduct business in the name of the person, the grtor, &gt;&gt; the one who has granted you the legal rights to act on his or her behalf. My if Jesus is saying &gt;&gt; please, please follow this. If Jesus is saying, I give unto you a state of control over something by legal rights because we know the whole universe, everything that God created is operating under a legal system. &gt;&gt; It is. It's a judicial system. &gt;&gt; It's not earth's legal system. &gt;&gt; It's not earth's judicial system. It's the legal system of the kingdom. I went through weeks of that with you. There's no doubt in my mind that there is an ancient of days. &gt;&gt; There is one who sits with a white wig. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We see him in the book of the Revelation, HAIR WHITE LIKE SNOW, the glorified Christ. We see him as the as the wigged one also as the ancient of days in the book of Daniel. And he has the THE THE THE AUTHORITY, NOT ONLY THE POWER and ability, HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE JUSTICE &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is beseech him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. request, &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; ask &gt;&gt; and it shall be &gt;&gt; a judgment, a justice, a just decision rendered from the legal system of the kingdom. And so anything that happens in earth under the jurisdiction of a legal system is some earthly imitation of something that is not based on opinion. You you you you understand that a the our legal system can can uh of course it's based on the law, but it can also be greatly influenced by the opinions and the politics and the convictions of the judge or jurors. We know that they have to act within the law, but they're given sort of a, you know, a little flow here and and uh to move and sometimes in ways that that our constitution never intended for it to be used. You can say amen or you don't have to say anything but you can rest assure &gt;&gt; that there's a higher a higher legal system &gt;&gt; a higher system of justice &gt;&gt; OH THAT'S EXECUTED BY the ancient of days &gt;&gt; and when he renders a just decision this is boy &gt;&gt; I I tell you when we were children in the Pentecostal church they called it praying through. You pray until you know that God has heard you. Well, he heard you when you started. &gt;&gt; And he knew the need before you told him. &gt;&gt; We got all that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when that burden begins to lift a little bit &gt;&gt; and faith begins to take a hold, we call that praying through. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it's more than that. When that burden begin to lift and some joy comes and some peace comes in a situation that's got you out of your mind. When you feel that, I want you to know it's because there's one above it all who has rendered &gt;&gt; a just decision &gt;&gt; on your behalf, &gt;&gt; not in any court authority, &gt;&gt; the authority of authorities, &gt;&gt; the power of all powers, &gt;&gt; king of kings and lord of lords, the chief AND ULTIMATE POTENTATE OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HE IS ALL AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; And when he says enough, &gt;&gt; sometimes he's saying, "Hold on. It's coming. &gt;&gt; That'll do." Have you ever had that sense of peace that says, "Hold on. It'll it'll change." &gt;&gt; Hold on. &gt;&gt; That'll do. But once YOU GET THAT PLACE, THAT PLACE of faith and you know that you know that you know no, you don't know how the details are going to pan out and you don't know how the circumstances are going to bring the ultimate goal into reality. But you know that you know that you know THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT 5 MINUTES AGO YOU FELT ALL ALONE AND you were carrying the weight OF THE BURDEN ALL BY [screaming] YOURSELF &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE FELT THE STRENGTH OF THE LORD AS HE AS HE PUT HIS SHOULDER UNDERNEATH YOUR LOAD, YOUR WEIGHT, YOUR burden &gt;&gt; and it be to get lighter. &gt;&gt; He did it for me Thursday. Amen. &gt;&gt; He just put his shoulder under the load. &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to carry this any longer. &gt;&gt; I died and I live again." &gt;&gt; In the atonement, which is to make us at one with him. &gt;&gt; It's union. The purpose of atonement was always more than a blood liel. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It was always more. The purpose of the offering system of the Old Testament was way more than than a blood sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It was legal. &gt;&gt; It was it was just and it was to bring us to a place where we are at union at [clears throat] onement &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Somebody said are there are there scriptures? Oh my. Are there scriptures? But she have received the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Is that a scripture? &gt;&gt; Is that a good scripture? &gt;&gt; They're all good. &gt;&gt; To have the mind of Christ to to have the discernment of Christ. &gt;&gt; To know what Christ knows &gt;&gt; and see IT THE WAY CHRIST SEES IT. &gt;&gt; Somebody said maybe a glimpse. Yes, maybe a glimpse here and maybe a glimpse there, but not always a glimpse &gt;&gt; because plain view, clear vision, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; has been promised &gt;&gt; to the believer &gt;&gt; as the last church age. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Comes to a close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Time no more. &gt;&gt; Eternity breaking forth. Okay. So then it says delegated or authorized power. So the reason why the word power was chosen here is because it can also mean power. But it's not a dynamite power, a dunamis power, an explosive power. It's a delegated or authorized power. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what that means is you could read that verse of scripture and instead of saying power, you could easily say authority &gt;&gt; and you would be coming up with remember brother Brandham said it's not a power. It's not more power we need. &gt;&gt; It's the authority to use the power that's already been given. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; shake your neighbor just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Wake up. Wake up. He ain't done yet. Not quite. It could easily read authority. Now, will you will you put up my numbers for me there? I I want to show the people. This is this is for some of you totally boring. For me, it's like I don't know. It's like liquid life in me. I don't know how to describe it. It tells us that this word exusia which is 1849 in the Strongs comes from the Greek number 1832. And those those little uh parentheses and the numbers in the parenthesis tells us exactly how many times the word exusia, delegated power, delegated authority has been translated in English in King James as the word that precedes the parenthesis. For instance, exusia appears as the word authorities in the plural seven times. It appears you would know that it's you wouldn't know that it's delegated power. You would just perhaps read it as power. But this shows us that there were times that translators said, "No, I think that uh authorities in the plural fits this context better." Seven times in the plural, 64 times in the singular, one time it was translated as the word charge, one time it was translated as the word control, two times as the word domain. So now we've already got one, two, three, four, five ways that one Greek word exusia is translated. &gt;&gt; Then we go on to freedom. Once I like that and then once the word jurisdiction and 13 little times it's translated power. So, you may be reading along and you may see that word power and you may think you've got a package of dynamite. God's handing you dynamite to do something with dunamis. But what you need to understand is God not only has the explosive power, &gt;&gt; he also has full authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To commission you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to use that explosive power. You do understand that the kingdom operates not by power, &gt;&gt; not by might, &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, &gt;&gt; by my jurisdiction, &gt;&gt; by my breath, &gt;&gt; says the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, there's something more important than power. &gt;&gt; Power is ours. He paid the price. You can you can get the beaver dam out of your way. You can you can get rid of the log jam. &gt;&gt; You can you can get things flowing again by using dunamis power. But brother, you can only do that because you have already been given exusia authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. &gt;&gt; That's what the whole spirit of adoption is about. &gt;&gt; The scripture talks about not just adoption, the spirit of adoption. Twice in the New Testament, it's by the spirit of adoption &gt;&gt; that we cry what? Papa abba papa is like saying dada my dear dad daddy papa aba it's powerful it's important and then one 13 times it says power once powers in the plural and then a right I've given you the right all exusia 11 times So altogether the word is used 102 times. If you research, some researchers will say 102, some will say 103. You you can choose which one you believe. But I I think because I looked at the last one uh and and it it didn't seem to be I couldn't find how that would would actually fit. So I'm not sure that that was exusia. The whole 102 times in the Greek the word was exusia more or less delegated authority. 88 times out of the 102 it's translated under under the umbrella of authority, the legal right, the delegated power, the delegated jurisdiction to move, to act, to believe, to obey. And only 14 times is it actually referring to power. And in those 14 times, the emphasis is not on the explosion power. The emphasis is on the administration, the delegation, &gt;&gt; the action &gt;&gt; of the power. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Does that really mean anything? Is there any re?" Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. It means something if you're studying God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, look at this. Here's the here's the paragraph you were giving me a moment ago. This this explains the difference between the two. While dunamis refers to the ability or might to perform a task, the dynamic strength to do it. Dunamis exusia is the right to use that ability [clears throat] or to command others. And that word command means to commission others to operate in such power. A common illustration which you've heard many times is a police officer, one not too far removed from a Barney F who may not be physically strong dunamis but has the exusia, the authority &gt;&gt; from the government to direct traffic and people obey. They obey the position, &gt;&gt; not the person. &gt;&gt; We respect the position whether or not we respect the person &gt;&gt; and we obey. If that person has the position of authority over us, we do what we are told as much as possibly can &gt;&gt; and that little Barney Feist steps out in the traffic, he can't even find his bullet. &gt;&gt; When he when he leaves it in the gun, he he he fires it right down his leg into the ground. All he's trying to do is pull it out. He He's a bumbling, you know, just bumbling, fumbling, &gt;&gt; but he's got a badge. &gt;&gt; They all know him and they know he's a pushover. &gt;&gt; But that badge can mean something. &gt;&gt; So, a little old police officer like that steps out and to stop traffic on Interstate 85, he'll become a hood ornament in a hurry. &gt;&gt; They'll run him over. You're not big enough to stop me. But if you know what you're if you know what you ought to know, you see that flash. &gt;&gt; He may not even have a uniform on, but if you see that flash, it means he's operating in the authority to tell you to get out of the way, to stop, to move lanes, whatever you have to do, he's there, and you better do it. &gt;&gt; So listen, folk, it's not more power. &gt;&gt; IT'S UNDERSTANDING THE AUTHORITY &gt;&gt; THAT God has given us. It makes a world of difference when we're talking about what we're talking about. Well, what are we talking about? An end time anointing. &gt;&gt; Now, look at Acts with me quickly, and I have a few more minutes. I'm going to use them. Acts 1 verse 7 and 8. And he said unto them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power." Now, you tell me. We'll go back. You tell me. It's not for you to know, &gt;&gt; not for me to know. Times or seasons which the father hath put in his own power. Is that exusia or is that dunamis? EXUSIA. EXACTLY RIGHT. ALL OF YOU get an A if you said dunamis. No. But no answer is wrong when you're brave enough to answer in a forum like this because we'll get the right answer to you if we can find it ourselves. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's in the father's authority &gt;&gt; to know these things and we know them if and when he desires to reveal them to us. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Why didn't others catch the church ages? It was only given in certain times to certain ones who needed to understand. Now it wasn't given to us originally. It was given to a messenger to a teacher or to a prophet. &gt;&gt; But it was given for us that we also would profit. &gt;&gt; This time with an F that we would get benefit that we would gain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this is Exusia. But but watch the next verse. Acts 18. Look at it with me. It says, "But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both in JERUSALEM AND IN ALL OF Judea and in Samaria and unto &gt;&gt; the uttermost part of the earth." Two times Acts 17 power. Acts 18 power. You told me that Acts 17 was Exusia. What is Acts 18 power? That's the dunamis. So, this is one of those beautiful places where we can understand the two expressions of power. You've got to have the ability, the might, the strength of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But if you don't have his authority, if you're not moving in his authority, which is ultimately his government established in the kingdom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; you will make a big old mess. &gt;&gt; Can you say, do you want to know? How many of you want to know Yiddish? Here's a Yiddish word. Bygon. You will make a big old bllygon. It means a mess, a confusing mess. you will draw attention to yourself instead of the one you're representing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It's very important that we know what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know how to wield to use the the power that's been given to us. &gt;&gt; And that we don't use it as a stumbling block. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we don't do it intentionally to become a gazing stock. &gt;&gt; If God's called you to be one, he'll make you one. But you don't have to see just how peculiar, weird, strange, odd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're already peculiar because you exclusively belong to him. &gt;&gt; You don't have to see just how &gt;&gt; I need some water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a thought of that puts my head in a polygon. You got a better word? What's the word you would use? What would you use for just a big one big Oh, I know what they say today. Hot mess. I hope that ain't ugly. If it is, I didn't know it was one big hot mess. It's a polygon. Can you give me another one instead of just looking at me like I've uh gone off on another tangent? What? A who? Oh, it's gone squirly. Gone squirly. Not a who or what. Sorry. See how important it is to hear clearly. Gone squirly. Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; I don't know, brother, but that's just gone squirly. Is that how you use it? Am I using it right? That just looks squirly to me. Is that right? Teach me, brother David, man. That's definitely not Yiddish. Give me another one that you would use. Oh, come on. You all of a sudden you are speechless. What would you use? What do you say to your family? What do YOU SAY TO YOUR children when they've destroyed the house? Disaster. You've made a dis. That's notmm &gt;&gt; a what? A kabo. Well, listen there. Kabavo. You have made a kabo. What's another one? A kafalafle. Wow. Our our our Korean sister, we're we're we're teaching her the worst. All these expressions, they can just mean anything to anybody. Kathuffle. What's another good one? A who? &gt;&gt; A tizzy. David is in back in the 50s and 60s. Oh, tweaking. I want my money. Didn't somebody promise me money? Didn't Didn't once upon a time didn't somebody say, "If I would say that in the pull pit, they'd give me money." Benjamin, weren't you in the room? Somebody offered me money. I want it. You can buy my lunch. Tweaking. Is that like tweeting or it means a mess? And you will make one &gt;&gt; if YOU TRY TO EXERCISE POWER &gt;&gt; out of your sphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. of authority, &gt;&gt; jurisdiction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe you can follow that? I think you can. &gt;&gt; So, so dunamis, look at it here. Dunamis is is the word 14:11 in Strongs and it means inherent power, might, strength, capability, power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth power. Both words power, one exusia, one dunamis. Look at this with me quickly. John 1:1, I've only got two more. John 1:11, I mean, excuse me, John 1:11. He came unto his own, and his own received him not, but as many, next verse. As many &gt;&gt; as received him, to them gave he power to become &gt;&gt; to become &gt;&gt; to become &gt;&gt; the sons of God. And not just the technon, &gt;&gt; but the wheels, fully mature, &gt;&gt; sons, he gave them power to BECOME THE SONS OF GOD. Even to them, oh, the requirements, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; are a little less than what you might have supposed. But as many as received HIM, TO THEM GAVE YOU POWER to become the sons of God, even to them. I believe on his name. Now in in John 1:12, what is the power? Is that exusia or dunamis? How many of you think that might be dunamis? Hold up your hand. Several. Beautiful. How many of you think that might be Exusia authority? Delegated authority. So more people have voted for Exusia than Dunamis. And you are 100% correct. The rest of you will need to write 100 sentences or we'll draw a circle on the wall and you can put put your nose there for the rest of this sermon. You got the wrong answer. But remember, no answer is a wrong answer &gt;&gt; in a forum like this. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's it's exusia. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's exusive. We always preach it. I hear I I've done it myself and I've heard others PREACH THIS AS THOUGH IT'S DUNAMIS. The the the inheritability to do something. AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, TO them gave he the inheritability to become the sons of God. No, the the the explosive strength to become the sons of God. No. THE AUTHORITY, &gt;&gt; THE RIGHT, &gt;&gt; THE DELEGATED RIGHT. YES. &gt;&gt; THE JURISDICTION. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, TO THEM GAVE he the legal right." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To become the sons of God, &gt;&gt; AND THEREFORE CAST OUT DEVILS, heal the sick, &gt;&gt; SPEAK WITH new tongues. &gt;&gt; Mark 16. One more. Revelation 22 and verse 14. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in, not in an illegal way, &gt;&gt; through the gates into the city. Not in a covert way, &gt;&gt; not as one who sneaks over the wall, &gt;&gt; but one who goes through the door, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the door &gt;&gt; of the sheep coat. I am the door of the fold. You're going to come here where the sheep come. You got to come through me. &gt;&gt; If you go over the wall, you're a thief. You're a hirling. You're a stranger. You have no business in the in the flock of the Lord." I mean, this is what Jesus said. red letter. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that do his commandments that they might have right to the tree of Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's no power here. There's no word power here. &gt;&gt; There's no word power here. But there is a word here. It's English right &gt;&gt; and may I that they may have right that they may have not not inheritability &gt;&gt; to the tree of life. not strength within them to the tree of life, &gt;&gt; but the legal access, &gt;&gt; the authority to go in &gt;&gt; and to partake. &gt;&gt; And this is You think this will preach all day? It I I I won't. I won't. But yes, it would preach all day long because THIS IS THE LAST bit of the Bible. And it ties in, doesn't it, with the first bit? Yeah. &gt;&gt; All the way back to Genesis &gt;&gt; in the fall, there were placed at the ga at the going in of the garden uh a flaming sword &gt;&gt; in in the hand of cherubim &gt;&gt; who turned in every direction &gt;&gt; north, south, east, and west. &gt;&gt; And they were guarding what? the way to the tree of life. Did you know that if this was New Testament Greek, the way would be the right? That's what it would be. It would be Exusia. It could be. It's not written in the New Testament, but if it were, it could easily be Exusia. It could be this angel placed here with a flaming sword to guard not the tree to guard access to the tree. &gt;&gt; Let me see who's getting it. &gt;&gt; I'm not. When I say that, I don't want you to think I think I'm so smart I got it before you. That's not it. I'm just I just want it to drop. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just won't know if it's dropped for anybody yet &gt;&gt; to guard the way, the right, the access, the authority to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Because if you have a right to the tree, &gt;&gt; if you have authority, access to the tree, &gt;&gt; nothing, &gt;&gt; no one, &gt;&gt; not even an angel. You you wouldn't even have to pause at the cherry beam &gt;&gt; because the flaming sword that was once positioned to keep you from gaining illegal access &gt;&gt; is now pointing remember it it it moves directions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if it moves 360 degrees, what will happen? I know what I said. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What will happen? It'll be right back where it started. &gt;&gt; But if it moves 180 degrees, it'll be facing the other direction. &gt;&gt; The Bible said that that cherubim and the flaming sword, they're just moving around. Somebody said, "What is the concept?" Well, it's repeated in the book of Ezekiel. When Ezekiel saw the Lord, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; And how did he see him? wheels. The wheels within the wheel. &gt;&gt; Wheel within the wheel. &gt;&gt; THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING. A FLAMING sword guarding the way, guarding legal access, guarding authority to have eternal life to live forever. I heard brother Greley, I believe it was, say in one of the services that if Adam and Eve would have slipped past, I'm paraphrasing, if they would have slipped past that guardian, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; and gained access to the tree of life, they would have lived forever. &gt;&gt; In a fallen condition, &gt;&gt; a fallen state. &gt;&gt; Their body has died. meaning that the process of death had already began in their body from the time of the fall. &gt;&gt; They were eternal as they were until the fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They would have existed forever in the condition that they were in from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Except for the fall. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; No need. This is some people will I I think I'll just do it to see &gt;&gt; to see if you'll turn up your nose. No need for clothes. They They didn't need clothes. &gt;&gt; They were covered by glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; And no one had ever thought of anybody else in any other way than a holy way. &gt;&gt; And it would have been that way for their offspring. &gt;&gt; For the offspring of Adam and Eve, it would have been the same way. They would have been given a similar body. It would have lived forever. As it was created, would it have aged? That's a good question. I think perhaps there would have been changes because it was in the realm of time and not in the realm of eternity. Although eternity was in their hearts, but it would not have ended in corruption. It would not have ended in in in in uh you know cancer. It would not have ended this way. &gt;&gt; But would there have been changes? I think perhaps even in the opice of time maybe some changes. But can you imagine having to live forever in a in a fallen condition, darkened, your spirit man bowed, broken, but you have eternal life, meaning you live forever. And so a guardian was placed &gt;&gt; turning in every direction, guarding the way to the tree of life. And then we hear in Revelation the last the last chapter the the end of the end here we hear blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right that they may have exusia that they may have access legal authority to the tree of life. Brother, if you should have legal access to the tree of life, which is a representation of the of the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he is. &gt;&gt; FULL FULL DISCLOSURE OF JESUS. FULL REVELATION OF JESUS. As we say sometime, no more through the lattice, &gt;&gt; but revealed openly, fully, completely, totally in maturity. WE NOW HAVE THE STATURE OF THE PERFECT MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Before our eyes, it's powerful. And when we take, I'm telling you, this happens. I I heard uh brother Daniel praying and he said as we sit under the hearing &gt;&gt; of the word we use the word hearing and listening reversed biblically to listen means it's registering in your ear to Hear biblically means it's registering in your spirit. &gt;&gt; How can they believe if they don't hear? How can they hear except there be a preacher? How can he preach except he be sent? And that's why we have to have an absolute. &gt;&gt; And we have it in the Holy Bible. &gt;&gt; That is our absolute. &gt;&gt; That was brother Brandham's absolute. And that better be your absolute. &gt;&gt; We had to have that. Now did we did that absolute give us all the understanding? No. That required a restoration wordise. &gt;&gt; We couldn't we couldn't follow it all but we had it as a guide &gt;&gt; as a foundation as an anchor. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so this is the the full disclosure, the full uh I I I'm I'm hearing Sister Alfreda in my mind. And I use a word on rare occasion, but when she was writing, she used it all the time. It must have been her favorite word. And sometimes I would say, we we're probably going to need we've used that word a lot. We probably should maybe find another word to place there because we've already said this word multiple times. Could anybody guess what it was who who read her writings? The thing she would put together through the years. Nope. The word consummation. And she grabbed that word and used that word and applied that word. The consummation of the ages. It could also be culmination. It could also be the crescendo, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The loudest shout. When the loudest shout comes, &gt;&gt; that's the one. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; It's the midnight cry. When the loudest shout comes forth, everything in heaven and earth &gt;&gt; come into a consummation, &gt;&gt; a culmination OF THE AGES, THE FULLNESS, THE APOSTLE CALLED IT THE FULLNESS OF TIMES. &gt;&gt; And in that moment, an end time anointing &gt;&gt; THAT HAS BEEN TYPED and shadowed all through the scripture is now made available in fullness. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that the believer can do more than believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can act on what he believes. &gt;&gt; HE CAN PUT IN ACTION WHAT he believes. &gt;&gt; HE CAN SEE RESULTS FOR WHAT he believes. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because he's willing to take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Because he's not just listening under the the listening. HE'S UNDER THE HEARING. &gt;&gt; HE'S UNDER the sound of the word. &gt;&gt; And under the sound of that word. things respond. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; All living things respond in the message kinsman redeemer will be done uh shortly. It's a relative word. Paragraph 168. Now sons and daughters, who has the most power before God? What is an angel? We were just talking about cherubim, [clears throat] but there are also saraphim and other hosts. We were singing this morning. Benjamin was leading us in a song that's called the god of angel armies. Right. &gt;&gt; That is a translation of zavut in Hebrew which is adonite zut which is the lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we translate it in English the god of angel armies. &gt;&gt; He's the one who commands. That's the god that's walking with you. &gt;&gt; That's the god who's talking with you. That's the god who's moving &gt;&gt; working with you &gt;&gt; TO CONFIRM HIS WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm about to get a little happier here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It ought to make somebody believe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It It ought to change the way you pray. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, if it be possible, if it's your will, if you get around to it, I don't mean to bother you. I don't want to trouble you, Lord. I know you're busy hanging worlds and shining moons. But if it could be possible that I could find favor in your sight, I would like for you to move, but only according to your plan. If you've got a better idea, I'm open to that. Should I go on? I dare say you've prayed that kind of a prayer. not that creative, but you've prayed that kind of a prayer this week and you could have shortened the whole thing and God would have had the same response. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have felt as good because we pray sometime for our own feeling &gt;&gt; because we're just not sure he gets it all. &gt;&gt; So, we're telling him every minute detail. Oh, he's an all- knowing God. &gt;&gt; Did you know if I would have prayed a big problem and I have just prayed, Lord, help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need your help. &gt;&gt; YOU PROMISED me &gt;&gt; that ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CALL ON your name &gt;&gt; and understanding would begin to come. &gt;&gt; Faith to believe would begin to come. Come on. I want us to understand because I still feel that sometimes even we here can give this impression that if you hold your mouth right &gt;&gt; the fish will bite better. &gt;&gt; This wives tale, you've heard that, haven't you, Jacob? You hold your mouth. I must not be holding my mouth just right because the fish just won't get on my hook. And sometimes we make prayer like the good luck charm of holding your mouth right while you're fishing to see if you can get. THAT'S NOT WHAT PRAYER IS supposed to be about. If I hold my mouth right, he'll hear me. He'll answer my prayer. That makes you a beggar, &gt;&gt; not a son. &gt;&gt; That makes you a dependent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And not a coair. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; how many co-airs are here? How many of you are co-airs? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Wait a minute. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT OR NOT." WELL, the scripture said so. &gt;&gt; We are joint hes. &gt;&gt; We are hes of the father &gt;&gt; and joint hes coairs. Joint hes with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Does that sound good to anybody? &gt;&gt; Sounds good to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it's not about holding your mouth just right and and praying right, you know, just right, doing it right. Three steps to breakthrough prayer. And and here's here's the first step. I'm going to give you the first step to breakthrough prayer. Put the book down. Delete the the real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and pray and just pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're spending more time time trying to learn how to pray a breakthrough prayer &gt;&gt; instead of praying. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; You pray enough, you're bound to get it right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; PRAYER CHANGES THINGS. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PRAYER IS NOT TO CHANGE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TO GET GOD in line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer is to help you and I get in line &gt;&gt; with what what what his will with what his will. with what his will &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; already says. &gt;&gt; You see, I can only bind in earth &gt;&gt; what has already been bound &gt;&gt; in heaven. &gt;&gt; And I can only loose on earth what has already been loosed in heaven &gt;&gt; according to the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll make a bollygon &gt;&gt; because you'll be operating explosive dunamis without the understanding and demonstration of exu of of exusia. Boy, that's a lot of words. &gt;&gt; Okay. An angel is a servant. That right? They're his servants. They're not yours. &gt;&gt; They're not your genies in a bottle. &gt;&gt; That's right. They're his servants. WHAT ARE YOU? WHAT ARE you &gt;&gt; sons and daughters? &gt;&gt; His sons and daughters. He said, "Who has the most power in heaven?" And he's not talking about dunamis. I assure you of that here. than a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel Gabriel Michael that's standing by his right side who has the most exusia the most authority power in heaven a sinner that's been saved by grace &gt;&gt; or one who has only been created as a servant HE SAID THAT SINNER, &gt;&gt; AMEN, &gt;&gt; THAT'S BEEN SAVED by grace &gt;&gt; has more authority in heaven, brother. That's the book. &gt;&gt; Because everything an angel does as a created servant. &gt;&gt; It has to come by direct command. &gt;&gt; There is no leeway to move through life led by the spirit. That angel is a created servant. if if he he can't move unless he's dispatched or commissioned to move. &gt;&gt; There's great examples of that in the Bible. One is Jacob Yakov is wrestling all night with an angel and in that wrestling match all of a sudden it has come to a halting stop and and and this messenger says what? I've got to go. The dawn is &gt;&gt; it's a new the new day is dawning here. &gt;&gt; I got to get out of here. &gt;&gt; This is not you know the thought of like a vampire who can't stand the power of the sunlight. This was a messenger servant of the Lord who receives his commission and dispatch before the throne of God. And when one one commission's in it, he knows exactly when he's supposed to be receiving another messenger commission and they can't move beyond. Even Jesus operated in that manner when he said, "I can do nothing except to be shown me of my father." &gt;&gt; But a son who has been fully adopted, he is allowed according to the scripture to make decision at times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Based on his knowledge, &gt;&gt; and his understanding &gt;&gt; of the father's will. &gt;&gt; And the more of the word that's in you, &gt;&gt; the more of his will you'll discern &gt;&gt; because you'll know him better. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if that if that uh you know stumbled you, &gt;&gt; don't let it &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham in describing the end time army, the sons of God, uh uh fully adopted and commissioned sons of God, he said they will have thus sayaeth the Lord &gt;&gt; or keep still. &gt;&gt; There's an inner there's an inner leading. You're you're not going before the throne at at 6:00 a.m. to get your commission like an angel might. You're operating in the leadership of what has taken not just not just visitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what has taken of habitation, &gt;&gt; I'm not done, but nearly. The sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. Son has more authority than a servant. Of course. OH, WE FORGET WHAT WE ARE. LISTEN, THIS IS GOOD. OH, WE FORGET WHAT WE ARE AFTER WE BECOME WHAT we are. It is right. Then we forget how we got here. If that little bride, if she could just know what she is, who she is, &gt;&gt; do you know why? Why she hasn't fully been able to grab it, to grasp it, to discern it? It's because she's putting it in the wrong order. Oh, just wait a minute. She's putting it in in the in the wrong order. You don't put the cart first and the horse behind. You put the horse first and the cart follows. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say you've been to church because you know now which comes first? The horse and then the cart follows. How many of you know you've been to church because you've heard that? Good. Glad. Praise the Lord. There's an order. You heard brother Joe say one thing that has stood with lots of people. Position is key. Position matters. &gt;&gt; We've been emphasizing these things for a long long long long time. The little little uh fallen captive daughter of Zion we were preaching about in Cookamo. The word of the Lord to her in Isaiah is get up, rise up [screaming] &gt;&gt; and sit down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says rise up and sit down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What in the WORLD IS THIS? GET OUT OF THE PLACE WHERE you are &gt;&gt; and come up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into a place of position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're nothing. I'm nothing. He that is within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's the position that we've got to get a hold of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here here is why we've got the cart leading the horse. You cannot know what you are as a son of God, who you are as a bride of Christ. You cannot know that until you have fully known him. And when the emphasis becomes more about the cart than the horse, &gt;&gt; let's say when the emphasis becomes more in in in the gospel preaching, in the teaching, in the application, when it becomes more about the bride than the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; we got to have both. We got to understand both. Correct? Amen. &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] you won't know how to be his helpmate. &gt;&gt; You and I will not know what to do to become the fullness of his helpmate if we don't know what he likes, &gt;&gt; what he loves, what he desires, what he requires. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'll I'll say this to stir the critics. Uh I'll quote a woman. Ruth Heftlin used to say when you uh she was only she said only in love one time it didn't become what she would hope that it would become because she had a call to Hong Kong and later to China and he was not ready for the mission. So it never became what she wanted it to become. But she said, "So you wonder how I can speak about these things." And I only experienced it once, but she said, "It's not really that complicated." She said, "When you love someone, you want to discover &gt;&gt; everything there is about that person that you love." And you don't have to wait till you're married to begin that process. You see, if their favorite pie is cherry, I'm telling you, I can't imagine that. I like cherry pie, but I can't imagine that. But if that's your favorite, you're entitled to that. As long as it doesn't come out of the can with that thick red goo. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because that is not cherry pie. That's cheater pie. Amen. Glad we got that under control. If that person that you love and care about, you see your bridegroom to be loves cherry pie and you didn't take time to discover that cherry was his favorite pie. Uh, is Ezekiel awake? Is Isaiah awake? Where are they? Are they asleep in the nursery? Go get them. Oh, they're right there. So, we don't know where they are. You can never tell about those kids. Are they asleep? Don't wake them up. Ezekiel, step out in the aisle there just a minute. Step out in the aisle. Everybody turn around and look at Ezekiel. No. No. Oh, that is sweetness mixed with Ezekiel, I want you to tell these people what Pap's favorite color is. Say it loud. Blue. Now, it wouldn't do any good for him to say, "Uh, pap, I bought you a tie for pap day and your favorite color." And me open it up and it'd be green. I'd say, "Ezekiel, thank you for the tie. I'll find a place to wear the green tie. But I need you to know it's not my favorite color. Blue is my favorite color. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; But I appreciate the tie. But he knows my favorite color is blue because I've recently told him it's my he and Isaiah that my favorite color was blue. And they went home and told their parents. He discovered something about pap that day that he didn't know before. &gt;&gt; And if he's smart, he can kind of use that to his advantage. &gt;&gt; Correct. Come on. &gt;&gt; If you're IF THIS PERSON YOU'RE INTERESTED IN, THEY LIKE cherry pie and and you're bringing them a peanut butter pie every week. &gt;&gt; They can hardly stand it. They're feeding the birds with it. You're not winning heart. You're not making any progress to know that person. Wouldn't you rather not waste the money on on bringing them a peanut butter pie if they don't eat peanut butter? Now, by the way, I'll eat both. And sister Ruth would say things like that when she was talk. She'd say when you care about someone, she said, "You don't just love uh who they you you watch the way they stand. You you you watch the way they they put their clothes together. You watch the way they they match things. You you you you find out their hobbies, the things that they that they like. and and and you try your best to to do something for them based on what you've learned about them. Folks, that is so simple, but it's why we keep putting the cart before the horse. &gt;&gt; Because we think we know what God is looking for in this hour because we read some words on paper or we hear some ser. But I'm telling you what, &gt;&gt; we sometimes forget that that the main thing has got to always be the main thing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I do believe that the emphasis of heaven is on the bride. &gt;&gt; But I believe that the that the emphasis of the bride, &gt;&gt; must never be on the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That produces bride pride, &gt;&gt; not exusia. &gt;&gt; Our emphasis as bride needs to be on the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, YOU'RE OH JESUS, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL TO ME. I love you in the morning when I first wake up and I love you at the noon hour &gt;&gt; and I love you in the late afternoon and I love you in the evening. Oh Jesus, you're faithful in all of your ways. &gt;&gt; My worship is not going to be BASED ON MY REACTION &gt;&gt; to who he is. &gt;&gt; My my my worship is going to be based on who he is. Oh, TO LOOK UPON HIM, HE'S ALLTOGETHER LOVELY. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS ALLTOGETHER LOVELY. SOMEBODY SAID, "As a man, I just can't call another man beautiful." You've never seen him. &gt;&gt; He's so beautiful. &gt;&gt; That handsome would never work. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "You've seen him." Every time I open the book, &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; I'm closing. Musicians are coming every time I open the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's more beautiful today than he ever was to me. Altogether lovely. We're not just looking for his outward feature. We're looking for the beauty of his heart. Yes. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe he has a heart for you? &gt;&gt; How many of you believe Jesus has a heart for you? &gt;&gt; He said, "I I I have plans for you." The Old Testament prophet, "I I have plans for you." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I I I I've got some I've got some things I want to accomplish for you and then in you. And then third phase, third anointing, third day through you. I want to do something for you. I want to do something in you. And then I want to do something through you. Let's say it again. I want to do something for you. &gt;&gt; And then I I want to do something in you. &gt;&gt; And then I want to do something through you. &gt;&gt; If you can't see that in the book, look again. It's the uh the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just paraphrased version and it's beautiful. Nothing, no one, no circumstance can dig you out of his hand. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And he didn't just do that to set you on the shelf &gt;&gt; and look at you like a trophy. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to find the people." Now, I'm going to say this carefully. I hope you follow me. In the beginning, it could be interpreted. I think it would be false. But I think that that many times the church has done this as though he thought that he could accomplish everything that he desired to accomplish through one nation of people, the the Hebrews, the Jews. The Bible is clear. God's chosen people. Like it or lump it, &gt;&gt; it's clear. And there are many people who believe as an afterthought he made a plan for the Gentiles. I happen to believe that there was ever only one plan &gt;&gt; and it was a covenant with mankind. &gt;&gt; And both Jews would believe and there would be a people called out from among the nations. He said &gt;&gt; for his name sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't think that was an afterthought. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I think it was in his mind to be a one new man &gt;&gt; as the apostle said, &gt;&gt; both Jew and Gentile. That doesn't mean that he didn't have a particular love and fondness for the Jewish people and particularly the geography of the land of Israel. &gt;&gt; That's clear. There's no other place in the world that you can stand at Elon M. You can't stand there in Colorado. You can't stand there in New Jersey. You can't stand there in the in the Rockies, not even the Canadian Rockies in B or in the beautiful places of this world. In the Alps of Switzerland, in the Himalayas of India and Nepal, there's one place and one place only that you can stand. Elon &gt;&gt; Morray &gt;&gt; and look out over the land that Abraham looked out over &gt;&gt; when God spoke to him and said, "I'm going to make of you a people." So God not only loved that people, he loved the land. &gt;&gt; But I happen to believe that as part of that covenant, he always intended to pull a people among the nations &gt;&gt; from all the continents of the world. Yes, sir. And that grace has moved as the sun moves. Starting in the east, moving west, circling the globe. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And coming all the way back to where it started, &gt;&gt; which is the east again. Isn't it amazing that you can go this is how God designed the universe. Sorry, you go west and end up east. That's what he said. Brother Brandham talked about the gospel starting in the east, moving west from Jerusalem, moving across this nation, moving back around through Asia, and the final demonstration of God's power to the nations in Asia and then back to Jerusalem. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I don't think God made a mistake. I believe it. In fact, we're doing all we know to do to help make that a reality. &gt;&gt; You can't move God in your timing, &gt;&gt; but you can make sure that when it is time, things are in place &gt;&gt; because he said they gave this message, this gospel to the Gentiles, and it will be our responsibility to return it, paraphrase, to the Jews. Amen. &gt;&gt; This time it's a one new man. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Where are we going with all this? Nowhere but up. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. You are patient people. You're beautiful people. Amazing people. And that's because you've got your eyes on the one who is. &gt;&gt; Amen. The more you look upon him, the more like him you become. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Paul said? &gt;&gt; How many of you want to be changed? &gt;&gt; Well, the scripture tells us how we're changed. From glory to glory, God, &gt;&gt; from strength to strength, &gt;&gt; from faith to faith. &gt;&gt; Meaning that it is a process. Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to say one more thing for anybody that's still mentally awake. And that is this. This is where we can get impatient. The the economy of the kingdom is not of the earth. And the timeline of the kingdom is not of the earth. &gt;&gt; It's of another realm, isn't it? The scripture tells us that it's up to the father. He's the one who holds the exusia to know the difference in times and seasons. And we're just here waiting on command, waiting on instruction, right? Waiting on leadership. Does that bother you? Does that make you feel out of control? It actually makes me feel very well to know that my heavenly father, &gt;&gt; the eternal spirit of God knows exactly. &gt;&gt; Here's what I want to say to you. One, just one more little thing. Here's how it goes. Gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually. Okay. Okay. Pep. gradually, suddenly. I don't know if there was much of an amen, but I wasn't after it. That's it. If you are a person who can only discern in suddenly, you you're going to fall off. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we better tie a rope around you because when this thing starts speeding up, you will fall right off the back of the boat. &gt;&gt; We have to understand in the fullness of scripture that God is always in process. &gt;&gt; Even his coming &gt;&gt; was a process. That's right. &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first, and then we which the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the last trump, with a last voice process. That's why some people could say we're in the process of his coming now. We are. We are always have been. &gt;&gt; It's another fullness of times moment. He came manifested in the flesh in the fullness of times moment when the when the earth was absolutely ripe and pregnant with with hope and potential of what was to come. Roads were being built like never before. Ships were being built like never before. Technology was advancing like never before on a broad scale. Why? Because God was getting things ready. Things were accelerating in the earth to receive the king &gt;&gt; the first time. &gt;&gt; Because when the gospel came, somebody was going to use those roads &gt;&gt; and somebody was going to they weren't they weren't built there for commerce only. They were built there to get the gospel to the far ends of the earth. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And there's never been a moment of technology and advancement &gt;&gt; as we have today. &gt;&gt; Both literal and artificial. &gt;&gt; This this is an amazing evil, ugly, dark. Yes. Is it dark out there? Absolutely. Or is there trouble out there? Absolutely. Is there violence, hatred, and division out there? Absolutely. And if we if we keep our mind out there and our mouth out there and we speak of that and think of that, we will be a thermosometer. &gt;&gt; A thermometer &gt;&gt; just reporting the facts. &gt;&gt; But if we'll realize that when it's very dark out there, it's very bright in here in the word, in him, in truth, &gt;&gt; then we will no longer just be the the thermometer will become a thermostat. This was the bride's call &gt;&gt; to change the atmosphere around her &gt;&gt; because we didn't get to the verse, but you know it. Jesus said something else in red letter greater works. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And scholars look at that and they say he may not particularly be talking about greater in the sense of potency because all power is all power. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But he's definitely speaking of greater in the sense of frequency &gt;&gt; and reach &gt;&gt; greater works. Not just to the places we can walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But greater works than this shall you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. because I'm going &gt;&gt; and if you'll let me go. &gt;&gt; The Bible precedent is this. If you let Elijah go, &gt;&gt; a double portion &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and Elisha company &gt;&gt; follows. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, if you'll let me go, you'll fully embrace the one who has come to save. &gt;&gt; He must He must &gt;&gt; increase. I must &gt;&gt; decrease. &gt;&gt; I said it that way on purpose because the only way that we can decrease is when we see him &gt;&gt; increasing. This is how it works. Gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually. It's a process. It's unfolding. It's an unveiling. It's a little here. It's [snorts] a little there. Line upon line, precept upon precept. Wheels turning, first guarding the way, and then giving us the right to the tree of life. Gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, suddenly, &gt;&gt; it's how God has worked from the beginning. &gt;&gt; It's how he's working now. &gt;&gt; If you can't embrace the gradual, you'll quit. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I want you to know I'm going to have I'm going to walk in the suddenly. I'm going to walk in the suddenlys of God. The promise said so. That's the breakthrough. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; that's the pushing through. Now, I've been I've been gradually getting you ready and you're still not ready. Suddenly sing. &gt;&gt; He's my son and I can talk to him that way if I need to. Let's worship. &gt;&gt; My [singing] Jesus, &gt;&gt; my savior, &gt;&gt; my savior. Lord, there is [singing] none like you. All of my days I want to praise the wonders [singing] of your mighty love. My comfort, [singing] you're my shelter, a tower [singing] of reuge and shrink. Let [singing] every breath. Let all that I am never [music] cease to worship you. Oh, shout to [music] the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. [singing] Power in majesty. Praise to the king. Mountains [music and singing] bowed down in the seas. We roll over at the sound of your name. I sing for joy at the work of your hands. Forever I love you. Forever I stand. Nothing compares [music and singing] to the promise I have in you. and my Jesus my savior. [singing and music] Lord, there is none like you and all of my [music] days. Oh, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love. You're my comfort, my shelter, a tower [singing] of reuge. Lord, let every breath Oh, let all [music] that I am. Oh, never cease to worship you. Oh, shout to [music] the Lord. All the earth, let us sing. We sing power and majesty, praise to the king. Mountains [music] bow out in the seas they roar at the sound of your name. [music] I sing for joy at the work of your hands. Forever I love you. Forever I'll stand. Oh, nothing [music] compares [singing] to the proise I have in you. Oh, [music] and shout to the Lord. All the earth, let us sing. [music] We sing power and majesty praise to the king. Mountains [music] bow out and the seas will [singing] roar at the sound of your name. I sing [music] for joy at the work of your hands. Forever I love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the proise I have. Oh, nothing [music and singing] compares to the promise I have. You know, a lot of times we we just leave it spontaneous and who would come and and and not and not make it an altar call type tradition. But I'm a little disappointed this morning because I really feel that it would be an amazing opportunity for just a few minutes. There's no service tonight. You don't meet again till Tuesday night. I feel like it would be extremely beneficial if more of you would join us here. If you can't stand for long, just come and sit close. The front rows are empty. And let's worship him with the same song for just a moment. The focus is not on your need &gt;&gt; for just a moment. If you came forward to focus on your need, that's not this opportunity. This opportunity is to come forward and focus on the one who meets all all of our needs. And you know what happens when he becomes the focus? Our needs get attended to &gt;&gt; and get ministered to. when it becomes more about us than him. Let's sing it again. Thank you. Thank every one of you. Thank you. And when you're tired, just go sit close. Sing it again, son. Let's sing to him. &gt;&gt; My Jesus, [singing] my &gt;&gt; Lord, [music] there is none like you. yourself &gt;&gt; and all of my [singing] days. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to praise your &gt;&gt; the wonders of your [singing] mighty. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether [music] it's physical or spiritual or emotional. &gt;&gt; Oh my comfort. &gt;&gt; He's big enough. &gt;&gt; You are my strength. &gt;&gt; He has enough power. Tower [music and singing] operation shake. Lord, let every breath supply. &gt;&gt; Let [music] all that I am. Let it never cease to [singing and music] shout to the Lord. All the earth let us sing power. We sing power [music] and majesty praise to the king. Mountains [music and singing] bow out in the seas they roar and at my sound of [music] your name. rising for joy [music] at the work of your hands. Forever I love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing [music] compares to the promise I have in you. and shout to the Lord [music] all the earth. &gt;&gt; Let the sound of your voice sing, &gt;&gt; be heard. Power [music] and majesty praise to you, King. Mountains [music] bow out. Seas will roar inside the [music] build of your name. your [music] house. I sing for joy and the word of God &gt;&gt; forever [music] forever. I'll stand perfect. &gt;&gt; Nothing [singing] compares to the promise I have. &gt;&gt; I want to say nothing compares. &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing [music] compares [singing] to the proise I have. There is nothing or no one that compares to the promise that we have &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; The emphasis is not on the promise. The emphasis is on the promise giver. &gt;&gt; Because our promisegiver is the promiseke keeper. The one who has promised, the one who has spoken is also the one who has both power and authority to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; So right now, Lord, according to your riches in glory, we are not here for for for some demonstration of religion. We are here to put our hand on your head. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful sacrifice you have been. What a beautiful offering you have been. And without you, separated from you, we can never find our way. But if we keep holding to your head, we know that all life flows from your head through the corporate body, the corporate Messiah. Lord, some are sick in body. You're a healer. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We believe you use doctors. We believe medicine helps. But we want to always give you the glory. &gt;&gt; And we've seen what you can do. There are many things we can do to help ourselves. But there are times when we cannot help ourselves. And you are standing ever ready to help us. If you need a healing, a help in your body, just reach your hand to him. Lord, you see every hand and you see the need. You see the need. And if someone has their hand lifted for someone else, you see that and you know that as well. And we want to say according to the word, with your stripes, &gt;&gt; we were healed. &gt;&gt; The tense is finished. &gt;&gt; We want to see the reality of it break forth &gt;&gt; in our physical form. You created every system of our body and nothing, no one, nothing can make it function in the same manner and order of the creator. So we ask you right now according to you, you said right in your word, Isaiah prophesied with with his stripes. &gt;&gt; You were w you were wounded. You were bruised for our iniquity and transgression. The chastisement, the breaking up of our peace was upon you &gt;&gt; and with your stripes, &gt;&gt; by your stripes. &gt;&gt; We're whole. &gt;&gt; So, Father, right now, we believe we come into agreement in the name of Jesus that healing will manifest and be demonstrated. [music] Several of you sisters lay hands on Sister Tiffany. I was standing there last Sunday with her and her husband as they were sharing not not such good news. But I know the one who is good news &gt;&gt; and I know the one who is able &gt;&gt; to show himself strong and mighty in her physical need. Father, in the name of Jesus, we're not making her the focus. We're making the promise giver the focus. You're the one and she desperately needs you to pass by today &gt;&gt; and execute &gt;&gt; healing. &gt;&gt; May it be actuated. May it come to reality in her life for the glory of God. May May Lord just move what needs to be moved, repair what needs to be repaired. &gt;&gt; Lead and guide and direct her in every decision. &gt;&gt; To put this battle behind her. &gt;&gt; If surgery is needed and surgery is your will, you'll go with her every step of the way. You will you will certainly guide the hand of the surgeon and protect her not only in that process but in the process of healing and recovery. We don't know exactly the circumstances of your plan but we know the outcome. &gt;&gt; The outcome is to the glory of God that your name would be exalted and sanctified and set apart and praised. So Lord, we just we get out of your way and we ask you to come and touch her now in such a way that you would receive the highest glory &gt;&gt; for what's happening in her body. She's got littles to take care of and she needs healing. She needs to be able to walk without pain and without doing more damage. You sense your word. Does anybody believe? I believe. I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe. I really believe. Lord, we ask you to go to those who are streaming this service right now who have needs in their body. It's not about being in a physical place. It's about touching you in faith. Would you reach right down across the world? I saw multiple nations represented. You're the healer. The healer in Alabama is the healer in Mosmbique, in &gt;&gt; Norway, in wherever. Yes, &gt;&gt; you're the same. Your power to heal and save and deliver remains the same as well. &gt;&gt; If you're here and you've been dealing with an increase in your perhaps anxiety or or emotional unrest, just put up your hand. Don't be ashamed. That's not who you are. That's what's happening. There's a solution. Father, I didn't even look to see all the hands because it's not that I would want to think of that again, but I know you saw &gt;&gt; and maybe the one who just could not find the courage, but chose privacy. That doesn't exclude them. You're able to do exceedingly abundantly above. It is not your will for us to live in turmoil &gt;&gt; mentally or emotionally. &gt;&gt; You said that you would keep us in perfect peace if our [music] mind was fixed state on you. &gt;&gt; So Lord, we fix our mind on you right now. And we ask that anxiety would decrease &gt;&gt; until it is no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; In every believer, &gt;&gt; especially the crippling kind, &gt;&gt; that paralyzes, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; that keeps us from reaching the fullness of your destiny plan. Those who deal with bless, depression, and and other discouragements. Lord, you're the glory and the lifter of our head. COME AND BE JESUS. COME AND BE Jesus to each one who has that need. &gt;&gt; One more little prayer assignment and that is this. If you're one of those who has bogged down, your faith has bogged down in the gradually. The Bible says, "Hope deferred maketh the heart sick." The heart is the seat of the emotions. It affects everything in the body. This is not the blood pump, but the inside of the inside. Waiting, waiting, waiting on the gradually to become the suddenlys. And if you find your faith getting sort of stalled in in in those moments, not always, but at times in the process, would you just put up your hand right now? I need something on my faith. I need uh the oil on my faith right now. Father, I have been right there. I have stood right where that individual is standing. Maybe not the same circumstance, but the same thought and feeling. Uh Lord, we're weary of waiting. We're tired of waiting. We would love to see you do it now. Now, now. Lord, I ask right now that for any person under the sound of my voice who finds their faith level, their their faith tank getting low. &gt;&gt; I I watch I've watched many times what you can do to that one measure of faith you gave us. &gt;&gt; You pour oil on it. We get in the right atmosphere &gt;&gt; and the faith that dains and dwindles increases and multiplies [music] &gt;&gt; in in exponential ways. So Lord, right now I ask that you would do that for any person who's dealing with the with the mundane of the process &gt;&gt; and the weariness of waiting. You said, "They that wait upon the Lord, which is to serve, not to do nothing. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings AS EAGLES. THEY SHALL run &gt;&gt; and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint." So, I'm asking for that for that anointing, for that blessing. I I'm going to ask you hold your hand up if that was you. Again, if you're standing near someone, you likely are. Agree with them. You don't have to even touch them. Just agree with them. Lord, I'm not only asking for help for mine. I'm asking help for him, for her. Put a put a a go. put up a new zeal, a new passion to believe you for every promise. Put a watch over our heart and to stay on [music] our lips. And when you find us speaking against the breakthroughs and the suddenies that are to come, would you convict and correct us &gt;&gt; and give us an opportunity to say it better, to express it better? &gt;&gt; We're waiting. We're [music] waiting. We're waiting. We're waiting on you. Serving you every day, believing that not one tiny part of your word, one tiny part of your promise will fall to the ground. without fruition in our lives. We're going to sing that little chorus now before we go. They that wait upon the Lord. It's pretty old, but it's mighty good. It comes right from the book. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it together. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew. They shall mount up with wings as [singing] he goes. They shall [music] run. They go from not hardly walking to running. Teach me Lord. Again, teach me Lord. Teach me Lord. Your antenna is toward him. They that wait upon the Lord shall [singing] renew. [music] encourage. Hold on. Believe has he gone. [music and singing] Oh, they shall run. [music] They shall fall. Teach [music] us Lord. Teach us Lord. Teach us Lord. One more time. They that wait, they that wait, I'm one of those serving until [music] the answer. They shall mount up [music] as eagles. [music] Never too late. They shall run [music] and not be weary. They [singing] shall walk. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord. While they [music] play that, would you greet one another? God bless you. God bless you. I'm going to pray for you. Happy to see you in the house of God. They shout with wings as he goes. [singing] They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Sorry. Don't be nervous when I can hear you but me. &gt;&gt; Oh, of course. Yes. This is biblical to do such a thing to lay it before the Lord. Dear Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh. shall renew their strength. They shall man they shall [music] run. &gt;&gt; Teach me Lord my Bible. Teach [music] me, Lord, to wait. One more time. Just a minute. If you need to go, you can certainly go. If you have to slip out Tuesday night at 7:00, but we've got a little matter we [music] want to give to the Lord. Thank you. They shall mount up. I'm not going to use it except that as he goes they shall run. [music] &gt;&gt; Teach me Lord. [music] Teach me Lord. again. If you need to go, you can. There's an enemy out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who has uh sent a letter to our brother and sister, business related, but what it really is is an attack. &gt;&gt; It is &gt;&gt; against their faith. And there's only one solution and one answer to that and that's the authority of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, if we could only tell them that and they would just forget it all. &gt;&gt; But we don't even have to. It's not about convincing the enemy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's about making sure you're fully convinced &gt;&gt; and persuaded. Was it Hezekiah who got this threatening letter, mocking letter? You know, if I were you, I just give up now. You certainly don't have the p the power, the the ability, the strength to stand against the army that we have amassed. &gt;&gt; And what did he do? &gt;&gt; He just spread it out &gt;&gt; before the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, this is good. And and basically he said, "Now God, you read it &gt;&gt; because what has been written as a threat against me and my spiritual jurisdiction is really it's really a threat against you." That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You see how faith can work? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you choose to ignore it, you're going to have to help me through every step. But I just have this feeling that if I give it to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know what? God knows how. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he did. &gt;&gt; He could have had a nervous breakdown. He could have, you know, uh he could have felt like he was in a bagon and a hopeless situation, but he he just laid it before the Lord. I was looking this morning to to the last Sunday I was here preaching to see where I stopped so I could start in the right place because I have done some preaching since I've been away. And I happened to just fast forward and I came to to one place in in that sermon that I feel like is helpful. And it was when the three Hebrew children said, "Lord, we we don't know for sure, you know, what's going to happen." Oh, king, it could be that our God will deliver us. We're not sure exactly how he's going to handle this, but we trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that he's well aable. &gt;&gt; You all believe he was able? &gt;&gt; You believe he came down? &gt;&gt; Yes. Do &gt;&gt; you believe he got in the fire with him? &gt;&gt; We're going to ask the God of heaven to get in the fire &gt;&gt; to get in the battle &gt;&gt; and and and to stand in the flame &gt;&gt; of this of this threat, and we're going to ask him to answer what we cannot answer. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, they'll do everything they know to do, but but &gt;&gt; it's going to have to be that God would answer this. He's got to move. &gt;&gt; So, I've put the Bible on the letter because the letter is not our business. He asked me to look over just a minute and I did. &gt;&gt; But that word is our authority &gt;&gt; and we're putting it on top &gt;&gt; of all those other words &gt;&gt; and we're believing now. You lay your hands on it. Those of you who can and let's believe [music] that God will move in supernatural ways. Father, I I believe this is exactly right. I believe this is exactly what you would have us to do. And if you've led us in this way for our brother and sister and family, then Lord, you must have something in mind. SO WE'RE ASKING YOU, GOD of angel armies. We're asking you, Adonite Zeot, the Lord of hosts. We're asking you to answer every jot, every tit, every exaggeration, every lie, every gouge in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, let your word settle the matter. &gt;&gt; You said that your word is forever settled &gt;&gt; and YOU SAID THAT HEAVEN and earth will pass away. but that your word will abide forever. &gt;&gt; And now, Lord, somebody might look on and say, "This is a personal thing, and you're making it a a a Bible, corporate, believing thing." That's what we have to do. &gt;&gt; That's what we have to do BECAUSE THE ENEMY WILL TOUCH EVERY one of us in a personal way. He will again and again and again and again. AND THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE DIFFERENT each time for each person. The answer will always be the same. GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN US than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Now Lord, I know enough about this situation to know that they have done nothing wrong. They have only done what they were supposed to do. And others have not kept their part. And this is somebody wanting to take advantage of every Kleenex and every Tylenol and and every pill and every throw up pan like sometimes we've seen on the hospital bill. It's overdone and it's usery. And we're believing that the Lord Jesus Christ will break the feather and the yoke and give victory. And we command fear. &gt;&gt; Fear is a human response. &gt;&gt; But we command that that fear be answered &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; by the faith &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; And we say the word, the word will rise. And we say no weapon formed against Josh and charity shall prosper &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; but that your word will accomplish what it is sent forth to accomplish in the name of Jesus Christ. So the answer is the word. &gt;&gt; Your word answers the [music] inquiry. Your word answers the accusation. Your word answers the threat. And and that's right. Your word answers the extortion in the mighty, precious, holy name of Jesus Christ. It it's just like the authorities told them, "Don't don't speak in that name. Don't operate in that name." And and you told them, "Go on and do it anyway." [music] You gave them strength to keep doing what was right. And Lord, [music] I pray that our brother will find strength to keep doing what is right and that you will answer. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and it's not too late. It's not too late. May the Araba of heaven open, the slle gates of justice open, and may [music] the Holy One, the Ancient of Days, render today a just decree. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. on behalf of our brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That says, "Lord, we don't know how. We don't know exactly in what [music] direction the hope and answer will come, but we're going to believe and we're going to praise you now. We're going to thank you now. We're going to believe you now that your word settles this thing in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Just leave it there a minute or two and let the word uh set on top of it. When the enemy cometh in uh like a flood, he the spirit will raise up a standard &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; against him. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sing with me. I believe God. Sing with me. Those of you that have chosen to remain, you're dismissed to go in the mighty name of the Lord. Hand me the little notebook somewhere and [music] let me say what's on it real quick. We're just settled in here comfortable. Uh, Tuesday is Amelia Caroline's birthday. She's turning 10. It's Jonathan Hollis's birthday. He's turning old. Uh, it's also the day that Sister Hattie Wright [music] spoke the right word. Praise God. May we say the right word today. It's also Veterans Day. Thank God for everyone who has served our nation. And then Friday uh uh November 14th, two birthdays. We have Sister Jada and Sister Jennifer Jernigan. May God bless them again and again and again on their birthday. Next [music] Sunday is our Thanksgiving meal together. Be ready for the list to come out. Let's sing this. I believe God. I believe God. Ask what you [music] will. It shall be done and obey. Believe [music] God and say, [music] "Oh, I believe God. I believe God." Ask. Oh, trust and obey. [music] Believe God and say, "I believe. I believe God." Oh, I believe God. [music] Oh, trust and obey. &gt;&gt; I believe [music] I believe God. [singing] &gt;&gt; Do you really believe him? &gt;&gt; If you do, wave your hand. &gt;&gt; I really, really, really believe God. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know that it was his idea. Doesn't matter whose idea it was, but but Joshua Yantis is one of the most private people I've ever [music] known. And it took a lot for him to walk up here and lay his business out and and draw the attention. But it's the right thing. You have done the right thing. We have done the right thing. &gt;&gt; We're a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's time for us to handle [clears throat] it like kingdom uh ambassadors, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you leave today in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus. Let's leave it a little while longer. And and let's believe God. I want to sing as as they're leaving. Uh he signed my debt. And the reason why is because as we were praying, I saw the enemy retreating. And this was a song that come to my mind. He signed my day with his redeeming blood. He ever [singing] lives to make his promise [music] good. When all the host of hell march in to make a second claim, they all [singing] march out at the mention of his name. He signed [music and singing] my dear debt with his atoning blood. He ever lives [singing] to make his promise good. When all the host of hell march in to make a second claim, they all [music] march out at the mention of his name again. He signed my debt with his atoning blood. He [singing] ever lives to make his promise good. When all the hosts of hell march in to make a second claim, they all march out at the mention of his name. again. He [music] signed my debt with his atoning blood. He ever lives to make his promise good. When all the host of hell march in to [music and singing] make a second claim, they all march out. had to mention of his name. The last time he signed my debt with his blood, he ever [music and singing] lives to make his promise good. When all the host of hell march in to make a second claim, they all [music and singing] march out at the mention of his name. They all [music and singing] march out at the mention of his name. They [music] all march out at the mention of his name. God bless you. Enjoy the rest of your day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What are all these people looking at? Huh?
