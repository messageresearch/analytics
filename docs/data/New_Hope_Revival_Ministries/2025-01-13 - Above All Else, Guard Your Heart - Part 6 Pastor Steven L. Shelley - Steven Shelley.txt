“Wherefore my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.” James 1:19

This message introduces a critical examination of how believers must guard their hearts against offense, based on Proverbs 4:23.

to remember her would you continue to pray for my brother-in-law Bob Avery needing a touch from the Lord sister Rebecca Shephard needs our prayers this morning she is battling with asthma sister Hammond sister Gert is home still today needing a touch and uh sister Rebecca has stayed with her so that sister Terry could come would you continue to remember sister Shirley y who desperately stands in need of a of a miracle a a midnight Miracle but we know that God is able we're praying for Luke Jernigan who needs God's help in a time uh in this time in his life sister Pam is recuperating from her surgery and we haven't really done so much to take care of her except to pray but let us do what we can in prayer that God will just completely let this be the end of a long ordeal that she has walked through physically and I have a card here that uh I'm not going to call the name out loud but the mail is slow I guess you know uh these days and this is with a letter it came with a letter from someone I don't know who streams our services from a long way from here in fact they stream in a place where there's no sell service and they access it through a starlink uh thank you Mr musk but uh we're thankful to have contact from them and she was to have surgery on the 9th and this I only got this out of the mailbox today it may have possibly come on the 9th we were traveling but it was a serious surgery and I want you to pray for her that God if the surgery went through that she will have a glorious recovery if not that her surgery would be well ordered of the Lord but let's pray for their spiritual needs as well yes this is their house where they receive their food it encouraged me this letter that was in this card encouraged me so much today and I wanted to bring it it's a point of contact she said I saw where you said that you had prayed you kept a card with you and prayed over that card and she said so I sent you one and and and I want you to do the same for me and I will let's believe God not only for her but for hundreds of others that she represents who we never hear from we never know they're out there but who depend on us who believe in the mission and vision of this church enough to feed from here let's pray for every one of them to be lifted up encouraged and helped in a time like this yes sing this chorus with us as we go to prayer Jes Jesus [Music] Jesus Jesus oh there's just something about that name oh Master [Applause] Savior Jesus like the fragrance after the rain brother hulke will you come and pray today please oh Jesus Jesus Jesus let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim oh Kings and kingdoms will all pass away but there something [Music] about oh Lord as we've been worshiping you Jesus we were singing that all the angels all creation and your people they cry holy to the king of kings that King came to this earth yes to redeem his peopleall to redeem the Earth that he created and you were clear to reveal to the Apostle Paul that we were United with you in your death also United with you in your resurrection and that the glory of the father was resurrected king of that body and the and the king of glory yes yes Christ Christ the hope of glory came into US amen as you're teaching us that we are united with you all that we need is right now inside of us and Lord I just pray for all of us that we can yield to that lifegiving spirit that is now inside of your people and Lord we just use the authority that you've already given yes Lord that healing would now manifest in your people in the authority of Jesus Christ yes sir that the Christ in us would come forth in resurrection power in the name of Jesus and Lord some of us Lord we know it in our mind but I'm asking right now with the anointing of the Holy Ghost that you would pour out Grace that that truth would would now become a reality in your people and for the glory of God that your people would get healed and delivered because you've already paid a costly price so we just bring all of the needs all of the needs of the streamers yes the needs in this house oh God you know all of them you're the god that is in secret you see in secret and so we just put all those things that we are hiding in our heart that is hard to put forth but Lord we just ask that you would have your way in our lives yes sir would you stir up faith in your people in the veil of unbelief may it just be wiped away in Jesus name and we may we just step forward in the destiny that you've all called us to but most of all that Christ be formed in US yes sir we just we want to just tell you Lord we love you we honor you and we just Commit This service to you in the authority of Jesus Christ amen praise God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah We Praise You Lord count it as done in the name of the Lord God bless you you may have your seats today we're glad to be in the house of the Lord and know that he is doing great things I'm glad that he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever I'm thankful for what he has done and I'm grateful for what he's going to do but I'm grateful for what he is doing right now he has purposes in all things he told us in the word all things work together for good to those who love God and to those who are the called called according to his purpose we may not understand everything about all of the ways that we go but he promised that it would all work together for good because I'm one of his called you believe you are we're going to receive the tithe and offering today to give to the work of the Lord to see that his purposes are carried out for for this body what everybody else is doing God didn't call us to that he called us here called us as part of this ministry and he gave us a Ministry mandate a vision and we want to be a part of that Vision being carried out uh we would like to know every uh every Dot and every Crossing of every tea right now but that's not the way God does he reveals himself Peace by Peace by peace he told the children of Israel if I give it to you all at one time you wouldn't be able to maintain it and that's the way it is with this good old gospel if he gave it to us all at one time we'd let some things slide along the way and there would be some amalekites that would rise up and steal what really really belongs to us and so God gives it to us in bits of Revelation along the way and he helps us to maintain it he wants us to maintain it and that's what we're trying to do we want to maintain the vision that God has given us so if if you'll get your tithe and offering ready brother Cade's going to slip over to the piano and we're going to Usher into the preaching of the word we're real glad that brother shell is here this weekend things did not work out the way we thought but God has a purpose in it he knows what he's doing and so we just yield to his purpose and believe that he has something to say through our pastor today not next week today and that's that's what we're believing for for this house for today brother elas will you come brother Austin will you Brothers go to the people today to receive the tithe and the offering give is giving unto the Lord

him so then you can take this world it's well and riches well I don't need her SP and it's my desire to live for [Music] him oh it's my desire to help someone today someone who failed oh failed to see the way oh cuz one day I was so lost but I found my way to God and it's my desire High to live for him oh if you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today then you would know oh the

praise the Lord praise the Lord Lord how many of you that is your desire is it your desire on a Monday it's my desire to live for him isn't he good you may be seated for just a moment we were not supposed to be here today but God sort of uh as brother gy was explaining he sort of changed our plans we made it all the way to Buford I don't know if you know where that is or not north of Atlanta all of Georgia is there top go is there just about any restaurant you can think of in the in the nation is there but none of them were open except one we found you'd be surprised to know that it was Olive Garden of all places all the other restaurants were closed and very few people were on the highway on Friday the roads had not been properly plowed or salted they were working on it but Atlanta is a big place we saw people slipping and sliding and we saw cars overturned some up on their sides some up on their turned over on the roof and uh it was just not a very pleasant thing but we were going to keep moving on and they called us and and and uh begin to tell us just how how bad it was and how dangerous it was and we were going to have to go over one of the highest peaks uh from Asheville I don't even know the name of that place but uh when you get to the top from Asheville going way up yeah that's right you go down into Irwin where the floods came through and uh they were saying that the top of the road had not been cleared and be very difficult to get through so anyway as defeated as we might have felt at the moment we uh had a nice lunch at Olive Garden we had a private waiter we were the only table when we sat down there were a few more that came and uh they told us what they could give us and what they couldn't give us so that was good because it busted us out of our routine what we would normally order we had to try something different and we had a great waiter and the kids were disappointed that we didn't get to make it but we'll we'll do Lord willing the weather better we'll go next weekend and we gave brother gley the option of preaching both Sundays and he is really still recovering in his voice I think and and uh didn't accept that part of the invitation but he will Minister next Sunday God is good and we want to give him praise I knew when I got home it took me all the way getting home to realize that there is a purpose there is I told my wife even uh last night there's a reason why we were to be here this weekend and God knows we're praying for all of those who are not able to be here today A lot of different sicknesses and things going on but many people are streaming and we want to greet all of you around the world world uh if you don't tell us where you're from we won't know but many people have taken the time to tell us and we see uh that South Africa is represented Indiana the Netherlands Southern Norway Morocco Arkansas UK Ghana uh I said South Africa but we can say Cape Town and and other places and we appreciate those who join with us us on a weekly basis to stream I want to mention that today is Brother Bill yon's birthday and we were going to spend it with him today he turns 81 he is uh not well and needs our prayers and the church is uh is a lot of work and we pray for his strength and we pray for his son Jason as he does the best that he can not really necessarily feeling a call to to Ministry but sort of forced into that kind of a place place he's faithful and I appreciate that very much Wednesday is brother Wagner's birthday and for you that don't know that's sister Judith or as we like to call her ju guu that's her dad and we want to wish him they're streaming today in Edmonton and we want to say to them God bless you brother Wagner we appreciate your faithfulness to the Lord through all of these years you know I've been their Pastor long distance uh for about 30 nearly 35 years that's a long time maybe not quite 35 maybe 33 34 but that's a long time and uh it's not easy to to uh be way way away from your Community of Faith but God certainly why that we were ahead of the internet you know we did it by telephone hookups so he's been faithful You' be surprised at all the great things that he has done to bless and to keep the work going so we are are thankful for him it's also brother Daniel and sister Anna Miller's anniversary on Wednesday and we is it 30 did so 30 30 years and they're streaming from somewhere in the United States I would assume today and we want to say happy anniversary to them and then Thursday is their daughter Anna Christine's birthday and she's not in here just now but uh we want to wish her a very happy birthday and I guess sister Alfreda has already noticed that then Friday the 17th I noticed is the anniversary of of going home to be with the Lord 24 years she's been in God's presence and she's cheering you and I on isn't it good to know we have a great cloud of witnesses who are the Bible tells us that they're cheering us they're rooting us on and we want to uh remember that sometimes it's discouraging along the way but we know they're waiting for us and we're going to one of these days be where they are do you you believe that let me turn my mic off just a minute [Music] [Music] I'm going to do what we don't like for folks to do sing without a a run through and and it may be terrible I mean I have a little more faith in that but I'm not sure when you find Finly make your entrance to that city of Jasper walls and bright golden Avenues as you behold all all its beauty and its Splendor remember there's just one request that I make of you look for me for I I will be there too oh I realize when you AR there'll be so much to view after you been there 10,000 years a million maybe two look for me for I will be there to softer as you go down your list of first there's no question you're going to want to see your loveed ones waiting there for you and when you feel you finally shared your story with the last one that wants to hear you tell just how you made it through we're getting through it anyway look for me then look for me for I'd like to hear it to oh oh and I realize that when you arrive there'll be so much to view so after you been there 10,000 years a million or maybe to look for me for I will be there [Music] too when you finally make your entrance to that City think about it of Jasper walls and and bright golden [Music] Avenues as you behold all its beauty and it [Music] Splendor remember theirs just one request I make of you sing it with me would you just look for me for I will be there [Music] to now I realiz when you arrive there'll be so much to view oh after you've been there 10,000 years or a million we won't know maybe two it's eternity look for me for I will be there too [Music] just look for me for I will be there [Music] too I [Music] will look for me I'll be there two how many of you have a reservation you're lot kind of quiet this morning and I probably didn't help with that but uh maybe you'll come together in a moment we'll get the word to you that's our desire would you thank these musicians and all their labor for the Lord what a gift it's not easy what they do and we're blessed to have them if you believe that say Amen let's stand for the reading of of God's word today let's turn to James chap 1 verse 19 if you will we are we are going into a series within a series so to speak we're still working on above all else because of an experience that we had in the night and it's been in our heart because the scripture tells us in Proverbs 4:23 that it is our responsibility to keep our heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and so in all of the guarding and the keeping and the spiritual discipline that we do our heart is one of the most important things that we can keep a watch over do you understand that because that heart is not the blood pump that's the seed of the emotions and we know how emotions can lead us in a direction that doesn't glorify God Amen so we need his help we want to be on top of that as much as we possibly can we're looking at some of the things that can get in the heart that can get in the mind and the will and the emotions that can not only weigh us down but they can become paradigms and structures habits and repeated Cycles in our life and uh we said recently that you know wounded people who are not healed have a tendency to wound others and we don't want that uh uh if you get around people that are bleeding guess what'll happen you'll get bled on and so it's important as overcoming Believers in this last day that we keep guard we keep watch over our heart and if we recognize paradigms or or what we sometimes refer to as death structures that cause us to repeat these same spirals going down and not up uh we want to be able to identify them and do something about them and whether you realize it or not as brother gy said we have everything we need if Christ is formed in you the hope of glory you have everything you need to overcome every situation no matter what the enemy is trying to hold you with do you believe that yes and so James tells us in chapter 1 verse 19 wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man woman too be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath the Amplified says it this way understand this my beloved Brethren let every man be quick to hear a ready listener slow to speak slow to take offense and to get angry you you're going to have to have a longer fuse in this hour you're going to have to find tougher skin in this hour because people are quite willing and ready to offend you know if you're involved in social media you understand the power of being cancelled and people can get upset with you and offended at something you say that may be absolute truth and uh if you're depending on social media for your income you can lose it overnight so somebody's going to have to have some broad shoulders in this hour I think the worst kind of an offense it seems is the kind that we receive in Christian circles in our church community in our faith community from our leaders or from our brothers and sisters and there's a tendency to hold on to it and nurse it and let it cause us to make decisions accordingly but God wants us to be free from all the weight and the baggage of yesterday if you believe that say Amen if I were to ask you how many of you are free from yesterday well there would maybe be a few hands and they would be raised mostly by faith the rest of us would realize that we're in a battle and we're going to win you know why because because the victory is won it's ours we just have to appropriate it we have to use it in in an hour like this so let me give you just a another verse here and we will uh then let you take your seat but we are to be slow to speak slow to take offense and slow to get angry and then I want you to to look at First Peter 4:8 and above all things here we hear the the same phrase above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins this word charity is agape we we're familiar Agape or agapo we know that they are cousins to one another in the Greek language and the Amplified says it like this above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins mine yours and everybody else's who will accept him by faith do you believe that forgives and disregards the offensive the offenses of others so this is not just his love for us but this is also our love for one another our unfailing love for one another covers a multitude of sins it forgives hear it and disregards the offenses of others just hard to offend a blood bought spirit filled word believing child of God now don't set out to do it because then you're making yourself an offender and you're going to answer to God for it the Bible said if we were to do this intentionally it would be better that a millstone that's bigger than some of those bobles that women wear around their neck a millstone is what you grind the the Grain on it's better that one of those were hanged around your neck and you were cast into the sea you would you would certainly swim like a Rock wouldn't you you'd go right to the bottom than to hinder or offend one of my little ones it's inevitable that we will offend one another but let it be unintentional and let us be tender and soft before the Lord that he can help us to know it and give us a strategy to make it right how many of you believe in reconciliation I do father we thank you today that your presence is here you have gathered us together for this hour for a purpose and that is that your word might speak to us and that it might become alive in us we pray that that will be the case even now that distractions will diminish and that our Focus will be upon you because it's not the written word only that we fall in love with but it's the person of the word it's you Lord Jesus Christ we ask for your help today and we give you honor and glory for all that you are doing in our lives in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we pray the Saints said amen amen you may be seated that word charity that we mention translated in the English it is the a uh it is the Agape it comes from the noun agapo it means to love with a affectionate regard to show Good Will benevolence it also means the kiss of Peace that's not the betraying kiss that's the sincere kiss that's not the kiss that uh says goodbye it's the clinging kiss it's the one that says I love you and I'm here for you and I'm going to be here for you when you need me somebody said well all I can do is pray well I wouldn't diminish that by describing it as all I can do we understand that one of the greatest things that we can do for one another brother bham said other than saying God bless you and he said there's power in that it may sound a little oldfashioned to say to one another God bless you but it's a good thing to say it means May the abundance of Heaven be upon you and I don't know anybody that couldn't use more of the favor and Grace and abundance of the Lord in your life amen but other than that one of the greatest things that we can do for one another is to pray for one another a and that's not saying I'm going to pray that's praying that's not going down and hitting the praying hands and and continuing to scroll hello come on that means really doing it and some situations require a fervency and an urgency and a calling out some situations require intercession intercessory prayer where we try to put ourselves in someone's position and say oh God move and move now do you believe God's moved by that kind of faith I absolutely do H that word charity kiss of Peace arms gift because that is some people's language of love to give or to receive something it's translated in one at least one time in the New Testament as a love feast and that goes back in um I would say more modern times but it would be to the times of John Wesley and the sanctified people they had Services of fellowship and spiritual worship and even sometimes communion and referred to them as feasts of love everyone showing one another that kind brotherly kindness and that love that is unconditional we don't know anything about that kind of love until we receive it from above amen uh that fileo love doesn't always work in the realm of that's human love and that doesn't always work in the realm of unconditional but there is a love whereby you and I have been loved that is not based on our uh reciprocation it's not based on what we give back not based on our Behavior or our track record it's simply his unconditional love for us and once you have needed it and received it and felt the impact of it it behooves us then to want to show that to somebody else you know the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 love just simply charity is the is the English translation it simply doesn't keep record it just doesn't write down every hurt it just doesn't rehearse over and over again how bad you wounded me you see this agape love covers a multitude of sins it doesn't mean that someone is off the hook it doesn't mean that there may not be repercussions it doesn't mean that there may not be restitution but it simply means I'm going to love you without regard for our Rocky past we've been through you may look around this room and see some folks that you've been through some junk with but if you can come if I can come to a place where we let the past strengthen us and not shade or diminish our love for one another then the purposes of God are actually being fulfilled in our life tribulations and trials situations where iron sharpeneth iron it's actually making us more like him the prophet tells us we're being honed in we're coming to a narrow point so that Jesus Christ The Living Capstone can come and take his rightful place place at the head of all things is he Lord of all in your life then he's got to be Lord over your heart he's got to be king over your emotions he's got to sit on the throne of your inner life and that's what we desire of him the word fervent there that is from the King James fervent charity means stretched Have You Ever Had Your Love stretched or strained this was used to describe the taught muscles of an athlete who strains to win a race I I'm around people who are it hasn't got on me in a while but I'm around people who like to work out and they like to use their muscles and and they like to stay healthy and that's an amazing thing uh but some of them haven't seemed to learn how this soreness and how these acids work and the the tearing down of the muscle building it stronger for the future and what they for instance they might go and have a good workout and come home and say I'm sore well that's not usually how it happens you may be fatigued but you're usually not sore until the muscle has some time to process the accident because sometimes we pull our muscles in ways that on a machine or with some free weights that we really don't use our muscles in everyday life so we're shocking ourselves the soreness doesn't usually kick in for up to 12 between 12 and 24 hours but the fatigue and a little bit of uneasiness can be there but my when it hits it can really hit that muscle has become taught and uh strained and stretched and if you have hamstring issues it can be like a rock and it takes some time even for that to release this fervent charity means it has to be exercised again and again and again and again and you you got to use that kind of love beyond your comfort zone Beyond just normal everyday affection love you love you we go out the door love you we know it's true we know who means it and who doesn't mean it when we hang up the phone love you we know who means it and who doesn't mean it but listen fervent charity is not just love you and out the door we're talking about be above and beyond the Daily Grind loving one another when we're just simply unlovable I wonder is there anybody in this house since we have so much quietness to think is there anybody in this house that would be willing to admit I can often be nearly unlovable particularly grumpy and grouchy and hard to get along with am I singing anybody song but fervent charity fervent love says I want to take this intense moment and have a love Feast somebody has slammed the door picture has fallen off the wall the normal reaction is a that buzzard I'm going to be nice that Buzzard let's knock the picture right off the wall but fervent charity takes an opportunity to stretch itself and instead of you stomping off meeting anger for anger offense for offense you walk into the kitchen and say I'm going to make him a pie or it's going to get very quiet or if it's the other way around I'm going to stop on the way home and bring flowers oh it's quiet you see if this is not love you oh wow there's a lot of wiggling going on on the front here this is not love you this is I love you so much that I am willing to look Beyond on your offensive Behavior even your unkindness I'm in this for the Long Haul the reality is we actually are more likely to do that with our companion than with anybody but this is not speaking specifically to husbands and wives it's talking about anybody in the family of Faith it's talking about the body of Christ and it's more than love you pray praying hands praying for you thinking about you it's going beyond the normal comfort zone it's tightening up the muscles it's biting the bullet and going Beyond not to prove a point but to manifest the nature and the character of Jesus Christ we talk about it but we have come to the hour where we're going to have to man manest it the world around us is dying for that kind of a love and how are we going to be able to stretch ourselves and love the unlovable out there if we strain so much in here love doesn't mean you agree with everything that someone says or does love doesn't mean you always constantly Overlook the offense without ever calling someone into accountability but fervent charity says in spite of regardless of yeah the Golden Rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you not as they do but as you would have them to do that's beautiful it's beautiful but it's even more than that this fervent charity is being mindful of the opportunity to love one another in spite of all the things that agitate you about that person now I know that when someone comes and and they spend an hour or two hours with us they they often talk about how much love there is in this little body but once they've been here a week let's get real once they've been here a week or two and they begin to hear the tea they're calling it now did you know that it's they call it tea once the tea is spilled and you fill everybody in on everybody else's strengths and weaknesses newcomers are already forming opinions about Old-Timers before they ever have an opportunity to get to know them for themselves and what actually happens is just repeated offenses build up and build up and build up and wounds get larger and larger and larger and when someone is already dealing with woundedness or has already dealt with great offense in their life they have a tendency to attract more of the same until the cycle is broken by the word on and so it becomes a snowball flying down the hill at break neck speed anybody want to help me but we're going to have to put our life where our words have been maybe even a little less talkie-talkie and a little more walkie Walky is going to be important in this last hour amen so as uncomfortable as it gets when we have to do some weeding in our garden the scripture says above all else diligently guard that area of your life for your thoughts flow out of that your words flow out of that your deeds and actions flow out of that even your prayers are sometimes Twisted by how you feel at the moment you know I I don't have to wonder why we're not operating in the fullness of the pro promise of the restored creative spoken word because we're not yet trusted with it some of us would be more likely to use it when someone offends us than when someone needs us this is not to put a wart on somebody's nose this isn't to dig a pit for somebody to fall in this is to help somebody get up and get out of the m that they're in it's a word that calms the storm it's a word that causes the tumor to disappear it's a word that releases conviction are you with me it's a word that brings Resurrection Life to things that are already dead that's the purpose of this creative spoken word that is not being restored it has been restored it's just not in full manifestation in the body because we might still be using it for less than what God intended it for it's not for our Vengeance it's not to get even it's to further the kingdom of God so until we can weed our garden and deal with some of our woundedness and some people think it means they have to get in need deep and Wade through all the pain of the past the reality is just let one drop just one drop of his blood let it fall on that let him reveal to you by the spirit I your past and all of the stuff attached to it that's dying right now under the impact of the blood of the Lamb what she said what he said what they did it's dying right now under the influence of the blood of the lamb and you're coming forth as brother Hawke was praying in a resurrection life that says I'm no longer that old creature hey didn't a lot of that happen when you were when you were who you were didn't a whole lot of that stuff that you carry around today didn't a lot of that happen before you became a new creation in Christ didn't a lot of that stuff go on underneath the old the old you know when I the Apostle said all things have become new old things have passed away I am not my own anymore but I've been purchased by a price Hallelujah are you a new creation in Christ then where is that old man he's to be dead and everything that's attached with him has to Die the reality is it's not automatic IC the reality is it has to be dealt with you're the only one that can deal with it you're the only one that can bring order to the chaos The Authority is in your mouth the word is in your hand it's in your mouth come on the blood of Jesus Christ is not only available to be appropriated it it it is absolutely part of the inheritance of this bride to fully appropriate the power in the and the blood of Jesus Christ there's been no other blood like that it's God's blood blood created by God for the specific purpose of redemption it doesn't look like your blood it doesn't look like my blood it's a blood that in its chemistry has no more life than than yours but in reality if you broke it down if you could get to some of it you broke it down it might look like human blood in that sense but there's a life there it's zoy life it's God's own life and if his life is there in the blood his love is there so you've not only got his life flowing through you you've got his love flowing through you and we must tear open the the roof we've got to kick down the Walls we've got to burst the dams and we've got to let that love flow out I know that everyone has these different ideas about what love looks like and it's not putting a bottle to your neighbor's mouth it's not petting them when they're wrong you see this kind of love is sometimes corrective but here's what you need to remember it's always Redemptive in fact everything God does is Redemptive did you know if he allows you into a tough situation he does it not to punish you he does it to bring Redemption to that area of your life everything we experience in Christ is Redemptive I'm going to wait till you say amen and we've got to show the same same kind of Grace to one another you see there's redemption in Revelation it's not just following the instructions it's having a revelation of what you carry some of us aren't even fully aware of what we carry when we carry the life of God but we understand that all the father was he poured into that flesh body of his son and we say he wasn't 50/50 50% God and 50% man we say from scripture he was 100% God and 100% man that's a pretty powerful combination it was that way so that he could be touch with the feelings of our infirmities and yet carry within himself something so powerful that it could save the entire world right whosoever would call on that name and repent of their sin can be a partaker of that blood salvation is through calling on the name of Jesus Christ and having his blood applied to your heart we're talking about more than salvation we're talking about Redemption and the bride you know we're receiving some of our testings and and and judging and evaluations now because we bypass as his elect we know that we bypass some of that that happens in the end not because we're looking for a great escape only in fact I don't want to go anywhere until I can fully manifest the life and character of Jesus Christ I mean that I want to be one of those that he promised would be available in the last of the last days well we can't do that if we don't guard our heart we can't do that if we don't tend our garden we can't do with that we can't do that until we deal with our nature to carry offense we got to have fervent charity and that word cover in First Peter 4 covers a multitude of sins it doesn't simply mean in this reference that it hides the sins leaving them where they were but it causes their what remission the script R said in fact that's more like it obliterates them you see the Old Testament made provision for covering the sin was there it was just covered by the blood of a lamb or a goat or whatever the the offering was but the blood that covers Us is more what the flesh could not do in that it was excuse me what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sent his own only son he came himself in the form of a son in the form of a man and gave us access to the life that was in the blood cell I want you to know the life that was in the the lamb the goat the turtle dove the the life uh that was in that blood cell would be animal life and that would fall on you and it would do you no good I don't want to be silly but it might make you you know squawk like a bird or or or or blate like a lamb but it wouldn't do you much good not under this Covenant under the old Covenant it covered sin but God knew it was underneath there but he had a way provided thank you Lord he didn't just provide a a a ram for Abraham's sacrifice but there're on the same Hill Abraham caught a vision of another animal so to speak but this one was God Almighty who would become the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world not to cover sin but to obliterate my past sin has been obliterated remitted by the life of the blood of Jesus Christ so is my present sin if there is UN any unbelief remaining in me or the attributes of unbelief they are also obliterated by the power of the life of the blood of the lamb and should unbelief creep up in my heart again while I'm trying to tend my garden and guard it diligently the same life that prevailed for my past for my present it prevails for my future that doesn't give me a license to sin it doesn't give me permission to compromise on the word but what it does give is a Redemptive hope that when I fall short his life brings the measure up do you understand Grace that's what his grace does it doesn't give us uh the ability or permission to go and do whatever we want to do but it sets us free from what we have done and what we might do should we again let unbelief go untended and unguarded if you don't pluck it up it'll multiply it's like gossip the old analogy that they used to use you know this woman she she just started criticizing and condemning her preacher and preachers are easy Target because they're just always in your face they are and so she just you know I don't know what all she said you know he preaches at us but his wife is guilty he does this but you know his children do that and and uh you know I I saw him other day and who knows what he was doing and but she had details lots and lots of details but a Revival was coming and the the same preacher asked that the people would pray and repent and make right so that the atmosphere of the church would be ready for souls to be saved so she took it to heart even though it came from the same preacher that she just simply was not fond of and she prayed through and she went to see the preacher and she said I it pains me to say this but she said I have had terrible thoughts I I sometimes wonder if this is the kind of confession God was really looking for but I've had terrible thoughts about you awful thoughts and I I've spread awful Tales unsubstantiated rumors and and and I you you said we needed to get straightened out because of an evangelist was coming and Revival was on the way and so I'm here to confess my sin and and tell you I'm sorry for the things that I've said and he said well you're forgiven that's what the word said and I I hold no grudge I didn't know you were doing that but but of course uh I hold no grudge and the blood is sufficient and the grace of God is sufficient but I do well what can I do what can I do to make it right I want to make sure that it's behind us and he said well there's one thing you can do that might help the situation and she said what was that I know you've heard the story there is something you could do you know you live in an upstairs a flat over there uh uh across the way and he Saidi have a I have an extra feather pillow in here and I'd like to send you home with that feather pillow and I'd like for you to go up to your upper uh apartment there and open up the window and and Sh rip open that pillow and shake the feathers to the wind and she said well why would I do something like that he said I've got a I've got a reason I've got a mission behind it you got homework assignment and she said well what what will I do once I've emptied it out he said then I'd like for you to go and pick up every feather wow how could I do that some would land on the roof some would land on the stoop some would land in the flower beds on the balconies of my neighbors and some would find them way their way to the street and some might get caught on a windshield wiper blade of a car passing by there would be no way I can see uh one falling on a cat or a dog and them running off and there would be no way preacher that I would be able to gather up all those feathers and he said that's exactly right and neither will you be able to go back and gather and undo and straighten out or control the damage that your criticisms and and suppositions have caused she hung her head determined as she went home to be more careful not only with her words but with her thoughts it's easy to say I'm sorry just like it's easy to say I love you and it's easy to say I'll pray but it's not always easy to carry it out amen so we need to be extremely careful in this hour with our thoughts and our words I might have shared a little piece of this the other day uh Friday a week ago in a in a text from aw toer he had some powerful words of advice about hurtful and offensive sin the sin of Gossip he used the scripture in 1 Peter 4:8 never pass anything on about anybody else that will hurt them love covers a multitudes of sin and then this is what he said the tail Bearer has no place in God's favor for too long folks the reality is we sometimes dress up vicious talk as a prayer request you you forget we're Pentecostal by experience and we don't have to know the details to pray hello when we don't know how to pray the spirit within us knows how to intercede with groanings that can't be understood is that right it may sound sometime like a moan or a groan it might be a language that you never learned but the spirit knows the need but our curiosity craves the tea am I using that right our curiosity craves the detail tell me a little bit more so I'll know how to pray you might get by with that in an Evangelical group where there is no praying in the spirit but in a place where praying in the spirit is not only allowed but encouraged you don't always have to know just like I think it was last Sunday when I mentioned that that we had faced a crisis in our family on Saturday and most people just graciously said we're praying for you some tried to guess what it was I won't I wouldn't play with your family's life like that trying to guess what was going on but if you did and it caused you to pray thank you I appreciate it every text I got my wife got praying for your family you keep coming to my mind praying for your family you know that's enough sometime because I know that when you don't know and I don't know he does and really all you have to do is Lord I come into agreement with your mind and your will if it's your will I bless it whatever it is and I ask you to exalt it and bring it to pass if it's not your will my faith says you're God's Sovereign and supreme and you know how to stop it and you don't have to be creative or directive you don't have to tell God how to do it that's witchcraft all you have to do is come into agreement as it is in heaven yes sir as it is in heaven you don't have to know he said and then he said then she said and then he did and the next thing and then it went this way and it went that way and it went the other way and all the neighbors heard it we believe the spirit knows there's always going to be somebody who loves us who's curious at least one person ask a me and they didn't ask me but at least one person asked a member of my family you know what's going on with your family I don't think they got much information in fact that's just not the way to handle yourself or somebody else's crisis let the Saints say amen amen just pray maybe we ask because we want to know what we can do here's what we can do pray like crazy men and women pray like let me let me say it this way pray like you believe it pray like you think it works hey because it does work every time even when it doesn't look like what we think it ought to look like we know that he's Sovereign we know that he doesn't make mistakes and we know that he doesn't have to kill somebody to bring them into alignment with his will we're delivered from our denominational Pentecostal mindset we no longer believe God has to bring a car wreck or a bad doctor's report to get somebody to his will he knows how to press them press us shape us mold us make us he knows how to send a fish with a big mouth and a hearty appetite to swallow us up he sent the storm he moved on the fishermen something's got to be done gave Jonah the strategy throw me overboard the Bible's just clear God had already prepared the fish not only that he swam him closer to where he needed to go anyway God knows how to do that don't you think he's got a fish waiting for the one you're praying for bring it on Lord whatever it takes we want one another to be in the perfect will of God and we want to pray without manipulation I just simply don't trust some people's prayers I wouldn't tell some people what I was going through because we don't need more manipulation amen you don't need more manipulation in your life you just need the sovereignty of God to shine his light on everything that presses you on everything everything that burdens you on everything that concerns you as it is in heaven let it be done in earth we are just Earth and vessels being made into vessels of honor and glory for the kingdom of God do you believe that the tail Bearer has no place I got to hurry the tail place has no uh uh the tail Bearer has no place in God's favor if you know something that would hinder or hurt the reputation of one of God's children you ought to bury it forever I'm quoting toer but I agree God didn't call you or me to expose our brother's weakness or our sister's weakness love covers a multitude of sin I'm there look folks there are certain things that have to be dealt with abusive situations have to be dealt with I'm not covering that up that has to be dealt with that's not what we're talking about but giving the details just so that someone's reputation is scarred so that when they make their way back to God nobody still has any use for them and holds their past against them forever what good does that serve TOS her said none bury it forever find a little garden out back a little spot somewhere and when somebody comes around with an evil story take it out and bury it and say here lies in peace the story about my brother God will take care of it he said with what judgment you judge if you want to be good if you want God to be good to you this is toer if you want God to be good to you you're going to have to be good to his children you say but that's not Grace well he said Grace get you into the kingdom of God unmerited favor but after you are seated at the father's table listen he expects to teach you some table manners I'm going to read that again Grace gets you into the kingdom of God unmar favor but when you are seated after you're seated at the father's table he expects to teach you some table manners nobody's going to throw food at my table unless is me just kidding they're just manners and we don't have manners today like we used to have we were talking about it the other day where did that come from I don't know somebody decided no elbows on the table it's not a bad idea the way people lay around now come to church and lay around go to the table and lay around slouch around I wonder sometimes how people can see to drive have you ever seen how folks Drive these days they're so slouched down I'm wondering how their knees their legs must be tied in knots to get them down that far in the seat so that they have to reach up for the steering wheel anybody seen that going on that's ill-mannered in my estimation no hats at the table we heard all kinds of things growing up no dessert till you finish your plate I grew up in a in a house my mother's family where men ate first that was the way they did it men ate first what about children that's the way we do it now but that's not the way they did it then when I was a little boy the men sat at the table first and ate and then the women came and sat with the children o ouch terrible awful and fed the children while they ate I don't know that that's right but that's the way it used to be but God will teach you manners how to treat one another if you'll use him our Lord as the great example and he won't let you eat toer un unless you obey the etiquette of the table and what is that the etiquette of the table is that you don't tell stories about the brother who is sitting at the table with you no matter what his denomination or nationality or background you simply don't talk about your brother Proverbs 10:12 hatred stirs up stries but love coverest are you with me Amplified said hatred stirs up contentions but love covers all transgressions if someone is constantly dealing Inc contentions you can know that love is not involved Redemptive nature is not operating hello sir the Bible said that's more like hatred hatred stirs up contentions all the time love covers transgressions that word stries is translated as contentions quarrels and dissension hatred stirs up quarrels and Discord and dissension all of us have unhealed Parts we're working on them hidden faults as we read in the scripture few weeks ago and Psalm 19:12 who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from Secret faults we're cleansed by confession that is looking within our hearts to uncover deeper motivations if we are honest with ourselves we may discover for example that we're angry or fearful people despite how we otherwise wish to regard ourselves would you want to wake up one morning and realize that you are an angry person what you disguise perhaps as being opinionated has a root in [Music] anger may have nothing to do with what you're angry about but that root of anger is there how would you like to wake up and recognize something like that about yourself that you're really a fearful person that a lot of your bumpy interactions with people are simply because you're operating in fear and their not and their lack of fear oh it's quiet maybe I'll take a little water their lack of fear offends you it agitates you the fact that there are people on your Pew that can face crisis as difficult as yours and come anyway and smile anyway and praise anyway can agitate your life if you're still operating in fear or anger it's exactly all I have it's all I have I only have one response stay with me a moment I only have one response I don't know what else to do how many of you facing situations you don't know what to do I only have one response I can't quit I can't lay out a church you come in here I I'm going I may be in Tennessee preaching next Sunday but what if you come in here the next Sunday and I'm not here and you ask somebody well where's the pastor well he just didn't feel like coming today he's dealing with some stuff what would you think of me you would undo it would unravel in your mind all the years of confidence that you have built up in me because you've seen me keep on ticking even after a licking all of a sudden you find out I just didn't come I'm taking a break I tell you I want to break somebody when they say that to me I'm taking a break from church church is not your problem you bring your problem which is you bring it on to church and give God an opportunity to do something with it what what if what if brother GRE got up here two weeks from now and said I'm sorry brother shelle's taking a break today he just really dealing with some stuff and just really didn't f up well isn't that what a vacation is no not for me because stuff follows me like it does you no I mean just for the sake of I'm dealing with something folks there's not anybody in this place even little Eliana who's not a year old she's dealing with something it's either hunger or wet diaper now everybody in here is dealing with something but I don't know what response we can have except that I'm going to just stretch my arms wide a't that what we were singing come on my soul don't you get shy on me I've only got one response and that is to praise the Lord when it's going good and when it's not going good what will I do I have no choice and really I'm not the only one who has no other choice you're a Believer you the first day you lick your wounds and feel sorry for yourself 12 out of the 24 hours it'll be 18 out of 24 the next day come on it's just the the way it works but if I don't act like I'm struggling people won't know that I am the reality is we're not performing we're pressing in oh somebody's got to press in fact a bunch of somebody's press toward the Mark it's a prize the prize is not being a a a a good Christian the prize is Christ he's the trophy are you with me good that was our number one if you find yourself unable to let something go for instance some pain or failure of the past remind yourself that you must do so if you want to move on with your life here's the problem some folks don't change make sure you hear this sir some folks don't change they want to be forgiven for the past while they keep repeating similar Behavior you got to deal with the root and I'll tell you what we discover the root of a lot of our stuff and why we still carry it is pride and nobody wants to jump up and say I'm filled with pride most of us feel that our pride has been crushed and crushed and crushed and crushed but the reality is we've just sort of driven it deeper can't afford for anybody to know God wants to help us if you find this to be a hopeless message you're not listening to the entirety there's so much hope in this I mean it because everything we hope for is found in trusting him focusing on how things could have been different is to be enslaved to a past that you cannot now alter the goal of scriptural repentance Tesa is to turn us back to God for life but to do this we must be willing to let go of what makes us sick that's one of the ways that we can guard our heart is through the practice of perfect love and perfect love is something that we will have to practice to cause it to bloom we have to choose it we have to choose Agape agapo we have to choose agapo until we can demonstrate it because that is the bridge to his perfect love flowing through us to somebody else the reality is love is a choice and we're faced all day long every day with reasons not to love somebody but there's something in us that constrains us can't explain it to this day there is a love in me and in you I'm sure even for someone who has betrayed you or wronged you even tried to destroy you and yet if there ever was a god-given love for that person you find it creeping up and out you find yourself thinking about them in a in a less harsh and less critical and more positive way and then you might find yourself praying for them yes because God gave you a love for them that you don't understand through the years we have been stolen from more than one time from more than one person we only called the police that I recall once and that was on a preacher who was stealing from us while we gave his homeless behind a place to sleep was that too carnal I cleaned that up for you in fact and then guess what I did I told him now get your stuff and get because I've called the police and they're on the way and you don't have long to get your stuff not mine please leave mine and and everybody else is off the campground that you took and get out of here as fast as you can the reality of what we had gone through as a family and a church family hit me some days later when my little children were playing with cars and one of the boys said to the other boy he called the name of the preacher and he said come on so and so I'm going to open the back door of the police car and you get in oh my that kind of infraction didn't just happen once it's happened multiple times but the reality is when God gives you a love for somebody I've I've worked hard to find one of those men I've been unable to find him to locate him for a couple of years now have no idea where he is but but I have a genuine desire to know how he's doing I want to know did he whip that thing did he overcome that did El Li to death did he find help and [Music] hope you just can't help it sometime when God puts a love in your heart for somebody so use it by praying constructively for that person I want to introduce in the time that we have left this morning and I know we may have a visitor or two but uh we're never offended when people have to slip out but we don't you generally Rush on Sunday morning because we don't have a Sunday night service so we take our time and maybe we should post that on the sign so that everyone would know I'm going to skip a section of what I wanted to talk about in places a little bit later in the sequence I think it would better serve the continuity of what we're going to introduce this morning we're going to do a fairly comprehensive teaching on the spirit of offense over the next few services that we're here and in order to do that I want to just really break it down and help all of us to sort of understand I've been working through this for myself because the Bible tells us great peace have they which love the law of God and nothing nothing it didn't say nothing in the law it says nothing will shall by any means offend them they somehow grow up spiritually to become unoffendable let me use this example I'm not a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural I am a skeptic when it comes to people's interpretations of the supernatural but I'm not a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural if you tell me you saw an angel I usually say praise the Lord what did he look like I hope he was near me I don't know whether you did or not but because I have and many of the people that I trust have it would be easier for me to believe that you have than to believe you would stand Toe to Toe eye to eye to me and lie that you did when you didn't do you understand so I I because I know the supernatural in the sense that I've lived it and encountered it as some of you have when somebody tells me they have certain thing in intercession or I I just say praise the Lord I don't always necessarily agree with how people interpret what they see because if you pass anything through your opinion it's mixed and who has the victory enough to lay their opinion aside when they're describing what they felt or saw or heard well we all better come to a place where we can do that because it's vitally important for the future of Supernatural leadership among us if God's going to move the way we see him move the way we believe he can move we're going to have to come to a place where we can be a people are you here who are not tainting what they see or hear with their own thoughts but I believe it if if sister Megan comes and says brother Shelly I saw a blue flash of light what is blue well blue represents a spirit of Truth and I know that truth is present when the Gospel of Jesus Christ is being preached so I don't have a problem with that I'm not going to build a Doctrine about it I might not put it in the newsletter I might not come up here and talk about it but I might if I don't it doesn't mean I don't believe it but I'm not only responsible for what I believe I'm responsible in in helping you to believe it and if I'm not sure then you see brother brandham tells us for instance with some of those prophetic utterances and things that it's not to be rep repetitious it's not to be the same thing over and over again it's not just to be the quoting of scripture which we can all look up for ourselves but it should be more prophetic in the sense it tells us what to look for and when you see this you'll know doesn't mean that God can't work in different kinds of ways but I don't want to lose the point the point is when someone says I see this I felt that or I had a dream that I don't understand I told one the other day that some of the young couples that I was near that I don't understand it was about bears and friendly Bears of which I've never really met any if I can't understand it I just leave it but I believe in the Supernatural I believe God talks in dreams I believe God talks in Visions amen I'm just not skeptical so now when we come to this realm of offense it's easier for me to believe that you are genuinely wounded and hurt when you say you are sometimes I don't understand it when people tell me what hurt them my mind says oh goodness I is that all but I just can't imagine that someone would would want to carry something if it wasn't genuinely a hindrance to them I would think You' just automatically let it roll off and what causes some people such Brokenness and wounded you and I might have kicked it off a dozen times before lunch I get hate mail just like others do I can't believe what I hear or it'll get in me so I have to toughen my hide and I have to say you have to take The Good the Bad and the Ugly if you're going to be out there you understand what I'm saying saying I would just hope and pray that you would not put a pretense on your life and carry it if it wasn't rooted in some kind of reality if it's not real kick it off and what I'm I'm saying is you can't officially be offended at what you think somebody did or what you think they might have meant by what you think they did and it's like that gossip game you don't really know what really was said because somebody tells you what was said because if that has passed through one person used to be a lot no no just one I am I am so amazed sometime how one person young people you don't have to be old to forget young people can forget the details 20 minutes from when it happened and when they tell it you wouldn't even recognize the event you were there you pass after somebody and crush them when it wasn't even the the full reality of what happened you have added your perception and your understanding and your lack of memory and you've mixed it all in and you've made a soup and you're handing it to somebody and they may end up carrying it for weeks or years so my advice in a situation like that is is it necessary is it really necessary for you to tell somebody what somebody else said about them oh you don't know the answer to that I didn't hear amens or om or NOS or I'll tell you this if it's not necessary don't do it and if it's not Redemptive if it offers no opportunity for growth or change if you have have no Solutions I don't really need to know again all the problems do you understand is it kind if the same were said about you would it hurt you and wound you and cause you to struggle these are things we need to think about as we look toward understand understanding the spirit of offense we learned in this series already that the word offense comes from a Greek word scandalon like Scandal you might have this in the notes you might not meaning a stumbling block or a trap it's actually often used listen to this it's often used to describe the place where the bait is added to the Trap I'm going to say it again CU some of you weren't listening scandalon it means a stumbling block or a trap it actually often is used to describe the place where the bait is added to the Trap so if we were talking about fishing so to speak it would be the hook if we're talking about a a trap that drops down it'd be underneath the baset so to speak you lay the bait there and you prop up the trap and or o prop open the door and when the animal goes in to grab the bait and tries to start out the Trap is sprung and the and the door is shut and the animals trapped and that place where the bait lays is the scandalon it's the offense therefore others excuse me therefore offense can often become the bait that Satan will use to pull you the believer into his captivity brother sister you and I've got to have some discernment and we've got to make up our mind I'm not taking that bait or you're not listening you've been there before you've already been hurt you've already been offended you know what's about to happen as soon as the bait is laid you recognize the familiarity of what's about to take place and you my brother sister and me my brother sister we are faced immediately with a decision do I really want my little paw to be caught in the Trap do I really want to be a skin around somebody else's neck you know where I'm going is that little piece of cheese really worth my death you see that's this scandalon that's the word it's not just a trap but it's the place where the bait is laid in the Trap and the spirit of offense is is a baited trap because we're told grap peas have they which love and nothing shall offend them and yet we get offended nearly every day of our life is there anybody in here that hasn't been offended in the last 30 days with something you heard on the news or you saw or you heard or you perceived or like Papa Paul you saw people standing in a circle at a football game and you didn't understand that it was a huddle and you thought they were talking about you so the opportunity to be offended is an Ever reoccurring sort of thing amen repetitive it comes in the same door it comes through the same vessel it's dress sometime in the same words and phrases and expressions and what we have to do is when we recognize well we're not recognizing it very well because we didn't understand it to be a baited trap but if we can understand that like unforgiveness like Envy like jealousy like other things that we struggle with in our heart when we're trying to guard it and keep it clean the enemy baites us first and then my my my when we take the bait he slams the door shut and then we become the Geral on the wheel caught oh my I could be speaking about the seventh seal I could be talking about more of the third pull but since we're still learning to love one another you know we're here in this pyramid working our way to the top and after after we have become Godly which means just like God Peter and the prophet placed above that being just like God something called brotherly kindness brotherly love it's fraternal affection when we translate it to full English from the Greek it's recognizing that we're on the same team if you fail I fail if you trip I might trip if you don't succeed none of us succeed we are responsible as keepers not only first and foremost for our own mind but we are also somewhat responsible through the obligation and yet the privilege of Brotherly kindness fraternal love we are therefore responsible for the other Marines for the other team members if they fail we might fail does does anybody understand that so once you know brother sister that you're just like God I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand if you feel you've reached the full potential of godliness the the simplest description is just like God well God was never late he was always on time hello and God was never hoty he was righteous sometimes Stern and angry even but always righteous always upright he was not scandalous he wanted modesty so much so that he even taught the priest that they should be modest when climbing up and down the altar he required linen breaches underneath their ephod so they didn't show the nakedness of their thigh when they were climbing up to do the work of the Lord so we take all of the things we know about God into consideration and we understand that we have got to come to the measure of godliness before we before we rise above it to the place of Brotherly kindness and and who among us yet could say boldly that in me there is no doubt in me there is No Malice that in me there is no guile that in me there is no unforgiveness that in me there is no offense in me there is no anger in me there is no bitterness very few if any we all know each other too well to to fool each other about that right and once we get there we've got another Ladder rung to climb we've got another another place to move to and that's brotherly kindness and affection because you can be just like God in thought and word inde deed and still learning how to relate to your fellow brother or your fellow sister and we're going to come to that because the Capstone is not going to finish the pyramid in your life coming to the stature of a perfect man the perfect man which is Jesus Christ it's not a prophet of the Old Testament or the new it's not an apostle ancient or modern it's not a prophet ancient or modern the perfect man is Lord Jesus Christ and will'll never come into the stature and the fullness of who he is until we have been birthed from one virtue to the next and that means that even after we have become Godly we still have to learn how to deal with one another you think we have to wait until we're Godly practice learning how to treat each other no no no we better get at it yesterday when you see somebody doing something wrong I mean doing something that you know how to do and they're doing it wrong would you gloat would you flash them a look of hate or or would you in tenderness say that chord is f you don't plant that like that that's not how you make that pattern is not made that way you you don't don't put the sleeve first something you know how to do are you more likely to want somebody to try and flop if you are it's Pride if we get that way it's because we have too much pride and you would think that when someone got to to my age they would be thinking about helping someone succeed instead of delighting when they fail this comes from a root of Pride you can apologize again and again but if the root of that is not dealt with you'll just repeat that behavior over and over again you can make fun of me because I don't know how to do a certain thing if I can be still long enough you can help me learn how to do a certain thing or you can be like Brother David man and just do it for [Music] me but surely Brother David you wouldn't go home to your wife and say why that Pastor of ours messed up that song this morning preach 10 minutes longer than the long EST and to beat it all he can't even fix his own faucet in the scheme of life that doesn't really matter that he says that but it reveals something your heart will tell on you my heart will tell on me I told you an example I've said this several times I don't even really want to think about it because it affected me I one time saw one of my own children struggling to get in the door of this church with armfuls of stuff that they were bringing in that didn't belong to them but they were bringing it in and I watched adults not one but several this was years ago but don't worry years ago but I was I was far enough away that I couldn't get to him in time but I watched adults pause and watch one of my children struggle to try to open the door with a key while holding all these things I watched an adult pass within three feet of them and and watch them turn and see what they were doing but rather than to take a minute to offer a hand turn their head and walk on it reveals something to me for whatever reason Envy jealousy Strife something I had done probably probably had nothing to do with what that child had done it was probably more directed toward me than them but they just watched them struggle they would have rather them dropped somebody else's stuff perhaps then to give one second five seconds let me hold that while you get the door let me take the key and get the door for you it reveals something to me I don't want to be that person I can't afford to be that person that's right I can't afford to let something that has no relativity to what I'm dealing with now has nothing to do with it I can't afford to let that shadow my reaction now because I've left a root untended undug out something UND with in my life an offense I can't take out on your children what I know you've done if I forgive you if I've turned it loose and you and me the same you forgiven me whatever the infractions were along the way if we've done that you don't want my children to pay for what I've done that you've already forgiven me of I don't want your children to pay for what I've already forgiven you of are you here I know this is far too real we need more third pool preaching right now we need more we because we haven't heard that for the last 40 years so we need to hear this is what preachers do go right back to the same thing that they keep saying over and over again the problem and the reality is no one's really getting any closer to manifesting that because nobody wants to take the time and brother brandom never called offense a spirit so how could you get up and teach a whole lesson on the spirit of offense because it's just we could call it the nature of being offended there are just certain expressions and words that weren't used but it doesn't mean that the principle is not the same and here's how we're going to identify it in the scripture off fence like the bait in a trap is harmless if we ignore it well so and so's talking about you okay they've got a good subject and go on don't take the bait I wish you'd have heard what they said don't take the bait in fact be bold and say I'm not taking the bait do it I dare you I dare you if you're going to be offensive be this kind of offensive I'm not taking the bait it may be true and it may be ugly and it may be dark but I can't afford to poison myself I'm not taking the bait just not going to do it it's harmless if we if we ignore it but it's deadly when we consume it that little that little mouse just had to have the cheese he just had to have the peanut butter you and I just had to have the tea we had to have the details we had to know what was going around what was being said about us so we lingered and we asked questions and we listened to every morsel and it poisoned us the meaning of the English word offense is annoyance or resentment brought about by a perceived insult or disregard of oneself do you know that something may not even be intended to disregard us or to insult us but because we carry this tendency and predisposition to easily be offended we make it what we perceive it to be and then punish somebody the synonyms for offense here they are I think I gave you these annoyance anger resentment indignation you've got my righteous indignation stirred I hear people say as long as it's righteous but I kind of doubt it irritation irritation is a synonym for offense we who are easily irritated I said we I led with we I started with we there may be a root exasperation when my children were growing up I didn't allow sighing I was told many years ago that sighing could be a sign of demonization so I didn't let our children go around that it really serves little purpose it's not a good breath if you're going to breathe for life that's not a good one it's more like a despairing moan don't do it have faith hold on to God Wrath displeasure disapproval dislike hard bad or ill feelings disg grtl men animosity vexation aversion opposition and enmity all of these English synonyms for offense generally it means to feel annoyed or hurt by something or from what someone said or did are you following me a spirit of offense refers to a condition where a person is sometimes trapped I hope there'll be at least one person who will recognize that you have once been there in your life and hopefully thank God you can say I'm not living in that trap anymore a spirit of offense refers to a condition where a person is sometimes trapped by hurt feelings bitterness or unforgiveness leading to relational and spiritual damage I don't want to carry a spirit of offense and the bride said let's look at Ephesians you know this well few more minutes and we're done Ephesians 611 put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places guess what honey it's not your brother brother it's not your sister not your husband not your wife not your children not your neighbor it's the enemy that wants you to be offended and hurt and wounded and become angry and bitter and unforgiving he's out to seow seeds of discrepancy in your garden he's waiting for you to leave a moment unguarded so that he can come in and cause you to perceive something that may or may not be the truth recently I've heard more than one person saying I just know everybody in the church is talking about me you flatter yourself you do it probably is not the case and you probably know that it's not the case but the enemy keeps trying to bait you right and if you think that there is truth to it maybe you would practice doing less dumb things and letting somebody spread it you don't want to carry that so that you constantly feel the scrutiny of everybody around you because then if you you carry that it doesn't matter how many people look you in the eye and say I love you sister I love you brother you'll never be able to believe them I think that's the saddest thing about carrying a spirit of offense is you're never able really to receive love from anybody because you can't trust anybody because you've been so wounded Jesus Jesus Jesus this disturbs me in my spirit when I even talk about it I don't want to be warped into this kind of creature that can't receive love I need to know he loves me at times I need to know my family loves me at times I need to know my brothers and sisters love me and if I'm carrying continuing to carry the perceived offense we've got a way to do deal with some of this stuff musicians start this way would you I didn't get very far we're not fighting flesh and blood but principalities Powers rulers of oh yeah there they go again there they go again all that talk about spiritual warfare where do they find that in the message of the hour a lot of places in fact I didn't bring them all with me this morning didn't think I'd get to them but I can boil them down into one summary by saying he told us over and over again this is not a picnic right this is a battlefield if you come thinking that you're going to have listen even a good picnic it's often spoiled by uninvited guests correct this is is a battlefield and the battle is not flesh and blood the battle is against principalities and power spiritual wickedness in high places the battle is with your accuser the battle is with a lie you'll never win a battle with a lie with another lie you'll only win a battle with a Lie by telling the truth speak the truth into that if you allow the enemy to squeeze you to that place you'll you'll you'll be the person nobody loves me and everybody hates me and everybody's out to get me you see that can lead to mental illness it not only affects and stunts our growth spiritually but it can cause us to go running madly through the woods thinking that we're being pursued the scripture said so thinking that we're being pursued when no one is pursuing us it can run us into the throws of mental illness we don't want to to go there let it go let it go brother brandom taught us and we have been taught otherwise what you do then is you you recognize that complex and you move in the opposite of it rather than that people own it and they say things like you know I'm an I wear my feelings on my sleeve for heaven's sakes don't confess that even if it's the truth of your present reality don't confess that I wear my feelings on my sleeve tuck them away say I'm going to be undefendable in this last day I have to be I can't let my mind go there see when I said about it's easier to believe in the Supernatural it should be easier for all of us to believe that he didn't mean that she didn't mean that the way I took it he didn't mean that the way I interpreted it and if we if we start judging motives that's when we offend Matthew 7 is that right Matthew 7 judge not you see that's not talking about judging with a spiritual and righteous judgment if you look at that in the original you'll find that it means judging someone's motives and you better be careful how you judge someone else's motives because your motives will be judged the same way well I know what he said but I know what he meant I'm pretty sure I know why she said that have you ever heard that I'm pretty sure I know why he did that I know what's in there I know him better than he knows his that was when a brother and I ended up unfortunately parting ways when he told me I know you better than you know yourself unless you are the Holy Spirit that's not likely to be the truth but he does he knows my ins and outs my U risings and my downfalls he knows how to talk to me he knows how to whip me he knows how to whisper and he and you the same nobody know nobody knows your children like you know them you live with them all the time God knows you brother he knows you sister he knows you he's believing the best about you but he knows whatever is he knows the reality but he chooses to know because he's an omniscient God he knows you're not going to stay in that mess he knows somebody is going to present some truth to you and you're going to make up your mind to stop taking the devil's bait so yes spiritual warfare is true and I want to close by giving you this definition spiritual war oh it's a long one I must have wrote it spiritual warfare is the believer's active engagement in the spiritual realm there's a lot of commment so I promise you I did using the authority of Christ the power of the Holy Spirit and the word of God to confront and over overcome the forces of Darkness including Satan demons and their influence over individuals circumstances and systems in order to advance God's kingdom and bring about spiritual Victory freedom and restoration the key to that definition is active engagement there's a Warfare going on and if you choose not to engage you lose you give him the victory you give the accuser the upper hand the only way it's a fair fight is if you raise up and determine to engage the Enemy by using the weapons that God has given us to not only deter him but to defeat him God's word is enough if a life is behind it to defeat the enemy in every situation don't take the bait look at your neighbor and say don't take the bait in fact let me tell you this before this day is over 25% of us or more are going to have an opportunity to be offended some of us are going to go to lunch they're going to see the way some of you ladies are dressed and they're going to judge you immediately your legalists your your your pilgrims your menites your Amish your your you certainly believe that the way you dress has brought your salvation you might even hear them Whispering you might find that the waitress is just rude for no reason simply because of what you carry that reminds her of what she doesn't they're going to stare they always do if a woman has more than two children she's a gazing stock at Walmart one sister told me years ago I'm never taking my children to Walmart again well I don't blame you who'd want to do that anyway but you don't always have an option so you load them up and you take them well people look people make comments when people see I have more than two children they make comment they call me the Duggers they ask me am I after a television show you I don't know what's going to happen sister Sandy did you cook lunch Cassandra sister Cassandra did you make lunch today are you all eating out or what are you doing oh you're going home to cook that could be your opportunity Brother David don't be offended if it's not your favorite and if he didn't particularly like what she cooks don't stomp too hard I don't know I don't know what's but in the likelihood of Life all of us are going to have an opportunity and and here's your here here is your word of advice two hours of it boil down into one minute just determine I'm not taking the bait I'm just not going to take the bait I just refuse to take the bait I'm going to keep peace I'm going to stay in Shalom I'm going to restore my joy I'm going to use the authority that I have through the blood through the word through the name to defeat the thoughts that the enemy tries to use look they're talking about you look they're they didn't invite you look there there must be a reason they must have a motive they must want to talk about your family that's why they didn't include you because if they included you they couldn't talk about you it gets darker and darker and darker doesn't it I'm I I'm not taking the bait I'm not taking the bait if the enemy tells you your wife doesn't love you you tell him he's a liar she wouldn't stayed with you if she hadn't loved you she's already been through the roughest Parts praise God hallelujah vice versa in biblical spiritual warfare several things are emphasized prayer and intercession using the word as a weapon and defense the gifts of the Spirit such as discernment intercession and deliverance and the believer's Reliance on the blood of Jesus and the armor of God in Ephesians 6 can become incredible tools to use against the enemy when he tries to bring you under the influence of a spirit of offense spiritual warfare involves engaging the enemy through God's power and authority addressing strongholds like a fence and its part partnering spirits and we're going to talk about those a little bit later in the study because the enemy never tries to overcome us with only one thing he sends twins he sends triplets he sends a host and one piggybacks compliments and operates through the other and you get lower and lower and lower in your level of Victory and praise there's so much hope in this because God has given us everything we need to defeat the enemy if we only take the time above all else to guard this part of our spiritual life I've looked through the Bible Old Testament and New Testament do you know how many instances of offense hundreds hundreds before I went to bed last night I was going through one of the [Music] Psalms where David was lamenting and he said something like this in paraphrase if it would have come from one of my enemies have you ever been there I could have handled it so much better but it came from someone that I loved so dearly someone that I had had Fellowship with in spiritual things who's been there but nonetheless he had to overcome it because he recognized that God used that enemy to set up a situation with Absalom that needed to be dealt with once and for all Joseph couldn't he have died a bitter old man for how he was treated and yet he said what you meant for against me for evil God had a plan and he saved many people because of your jealousy you offended me you thought you were putting me down in the pit of offense that I couldn't get out of and God sent strangers Gentiles to come and lift me up out of the pit and now when I walk in a room the crowd bows their knee and says hail Joseph Prince of Egypt come on and God didn't do any of that just to exalt me as a man he did it to save a nation of people so you if you hadn't to come against me the way you did can you see yourself embracing can you see yourself embracing the very on they tried to repent they're walking out of Egypt they're coming along and they tried to repent and he didn't want to talk about it he wasn't superhuman he just believed the word can you imagine trying to apologize

have loved us we stand in awe today Lord of that unfathomable love it reaches farther than we can imagine and it has delivered us sustained us time and time again we want to thank you for that love we want to thank you for loving us when we were unlovable we want to thank you for infusing our lives with that love and we thank you for the grace that you have shown When we struggle to show that love to others help us in this hour to grow up to a place where we can be conduits for your love to flow into us and through us to someone else Lord Here We Stand today you said in your word two place in the gospels that it is impossible but that offenses will come translated it says to us that it is inevitable we're going to be offended we're going to have things happen that we don't understand and that wound us emotionally but lord it's not whether or not we have offence is coming our way it's how we deal with them it's how we react to them it's whether or not we continue in them or whether we step above them and take you at your word of Grace and go forward I pray right now across this room and those streaming this service if there's anything that I have misspoken today and caused them to feel like to be hurt is not legit legitimate it's reality is what it is it's happened it's real and it will happen again but I want to leave this word that your grace is sufficient and that we can walk in forgiveness to those who have wrongfully used us are spoken maliciously against us ultimately we want to see them redeemed and set free from the anger or from the bitterness resentment or rejection that has caused them to be offensive in their words and in their behavior we want to see them healed because we want to know healing from the inside out it's not just our afflictions infirmities and maladies that we want healing from we want healing in that middle ground today so Lord we give you the middle ground of who we are mind will and emotions and we ask you to step in with this unquenchable love we ask you Lord Jesus to pour the oil of Holy Ghost upon every place where we need your healing bomb you're restoring you are rebuilding you are resurrecting us to a place of Victory to overcome in these last days soothe us and then provoke us to climb let your forgiveness heal us and then call us to a higher Place Lord we want to go would you just spread your hands before the Lord and in the depth of your heart would you just tell him I want to get above this I want to fly I want to soar I want to rise above I want to know redemption in every part of my life I want even in my soul I want to know redemption in my mind and in my will and in every emotion I don't want to be controlled by emotions I want to be able to have control over them they're God's gift to me they're not a curse you gave them to me Lord to help me have contact with with my environment and with my relationships I just pray Lord that I can Master them instead of allowing them to master me I'm asking you to go deep now in US in US Lord right now give be patient just a moment you showed such Grace in the teaching now you can show just a little Grace here go deep Lord go deep go deep in
