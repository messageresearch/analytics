[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] [Applause]
[0:04] we used to go to church and feel the
[0:07] spirit of the lord
[0:09] our needs were met when on his name we'd
[0:11] call
[0:13] in his house we'd worship him one mind
[0:16] and one accord
[0:18] and oh how the blessings they would fall
[0:22] well it seems so hard at times to get
[0:25] this whole world
[0:25] on from my eyes even little hills seems
[0:30] so
[0:30] tall but my mind goes back to calvary
[0:34] whereby jesus died for me it's not so
[0:37] hard to praise him
[0:38] after all no it's not so
[0:43] where hard to of all his stuff before he
[0:45] gave this life for all mankind
[0:48] look where he caught me bro when i think
[0:50] of all his suffering my troubles seem so
[0:53] small
[0:54] it's not so hard to praise it after all
[0:59] well we'd all enjoy the blessings when
[1:01] the lord would pour them out
[1:04] songs of praise would seem to be so
[1:06] strong
[1:08] and some brother would testify and he'd
[1:11] make you want to shout
[1:12] about how he'd been with jesus all day
[1:16] long
[1:17] now the singing of the choir seemed
[1:20] usher in the fire
[1:22] you could feel god's spirit wall to all
[1:26] the strength that i acquired though i
[1:29] come to church so tired
[1:31] i found it wasn't hard to praise it
[1:33] after all no
[1:34] no no it's not so hard to praise it
[1:38] where to think of all he's done how he
[1:41] gave this life for all mankind
[1:43] look where he brought me from when i
[1:45] think of all his suffering my troubles
[1:48] seem
[1:48] so small it's not so hard to praise it
[1:52] after all no no no no it's not so hard
[1:55] to praise him
[1:56] when i think of all he's done how he
[1:59] gave this life for all mankind
[2:01] look where he brought me from when i
[2:04] think of all his
[2:05] suffering by trouble seems so small
[2:08] it's not so hard to praise it after all
[2:12] when i think of all his suffering my
[2:15] trouble seems so small
[2:17] it's not so hard to praise it after all
