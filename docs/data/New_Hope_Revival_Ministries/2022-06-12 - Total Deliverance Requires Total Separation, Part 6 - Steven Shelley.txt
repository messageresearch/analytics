wonderful lord you may be seated just a moment god is good i want to read you a little card that came in from sister sandy man's dad and he's written here he's 84 84 years old and he wrote have your pastor read to your church family love dad so i'm gonna i'm gonna do that for him he said new hope revival ministries family i cannot tell you how wonderful it was to meet some of sandy's church family part of the joy of christ has for each other as christians is to support and pray for each other thank you so very much for the prayers your you your you have offered on my behalf and for the food and flowers the food was delicious the flower's beautiful your helping hand has been a real blessing to me i give thanks to my god always for you because of the grace god the grace of god that was given to you in christ jesus love in christ j rogers and family i just wanted to read that to you all and thank you for what you did expressing your sympathy and love we had the privilege of attending the celebration of life service for sister sandy's mom gathering i guess we should say on wednesday evening and never having the blessing of meeting her you feel a little awkward in the sense that maya wished you could wish to could have known her a little bit but we had the most wonderful opportunity to get to know her through those who loved her so much 32 years she and her husband taught a class at the church there and there were graduates of that class who testified of her love for the lord and her witness to them through the years and it was such a blessing and she decided that she would have a funeral for just the family and then a celebration of life for for friends and loved ones to gather and a meal wonderful meal was shared and she wanted no tears she wasn't there to make sure that was kept you know but that was her wish no tears just funny stories and there were some wonderful funny stories told and my favorite of all was her request that all the desserts should be chocolate you know she was thinking of everything and so they had a chocolate fountain going and it was special we were leaving that memorial coming home when the word had reached us about the sudden death of charlie and rachel collins we had an opportunity to spend time with them a few years ago at bible conference in pigeon forge tennessee and they were not yet married [Music] we had some fun together brother andrew glover was with us and brother erickson uh junior was with us and we just had some wonderful meals together and some wonderful fun and charlie and his brother abe abraham they thought it was particularly fun to race me on inner tubes in the ice and uh rachel she wasn't in for that that wasn't her kind of fun but she had the best time watching them try to beat me and me try to beat them and the look on her face they weren't married yet they only got married in in this september would have been two years but they didn't uh they weren't married yet but she looked at him with two looks one a very possessive look he is mine don't touch that was my observation and the second look was of of unbelievable admiration and after hearing her dad speak uh at the funeral i realized a little bit of why she was holding on to him so tight because her dad was not excited about the prospect of a collins for a son-in-law but he didn't get to make the choice they'd already made the choice and he honored that choice and i think he got quite used to the idea and then when we heard as brother greeley mentioned in his prayer when we heard brother collins give a word can you imagine these dads standing up at this memorial service and speaking so clearly of their faith in the lord jesus christ for those of you that don't know they were 23 and 22 years old and there was some sort of gas leak in their home and just a few minutes after re-entering their home there was an explosion and they were instantly killed and everything they owned destroyed to the car sitting in the driveway and the the debris field i saw drone footage the next morning and the debris field was blown way out into the into the field of the of the yard really behind their home and then the different things began to come in we were told that she was expecting a child and that it had not been told out to everyone just yet and coming up short of their two-year anniversary but if you could have heard brother collins when he was speaking you would have known that there are no questions to be asked because we are believers and believers believe we grieve but we don't grieve like those who have no hope we don't grieve like the world grieves and if i've ever seen a demonstration of that in my life i saw it yesterday during the memorial service for two dads to be the first to speak and to say thank you for your love and thank you for your expression and and for a dad to say god makes no mistakes he said i was very close to of the possibility of losing two of my sons because josh was on the property less than 10 minutes before and could have lost two sons no one wants to lose a family member no one no one wants to lose a child it seems against nature for a parent to survive the loss the death of a child but my faith was so strengthened and i was so glad to be a believer to believe in the sovereignty of god and uh brother branham said that there are no accidents so when we call it an accident believers don't have accidents god allows things because he sees pain he sees heartache he sees something worse down the line and he just claims what belongs to him you don't belong to your parents you don't belong to your siblings you don't belong to your spouse you belong to your papa and he's the one who calls us and so yes there was grief we grieved even in our little bit of experience with them and a little fun with them we grieved i woke up all through the night praying for their families but the truth of it is they're where i've got to be they're where i long to be their battles over their races run their struggles are finished they'll never ride another mile on the struggle bus they'll never fight another battle of the mind never be discouraged never feel insecure again never deal with inferiority again no pain no doctor's diagnosis will ever bring them down again my my they're wearing royal clothes and walking in a dimension that's more real than the one we're living in today and what a profound opportunity god gave them they there was a whole bus of of amish not former amish amish who came there to the funeral friends of the collins family they're so well known in all their different activities and their different work and if you ask those those guys what what they grew up doing they'd say a little bit of everything daddy did a little everything and the influence that was shown in the church family and the strength and brother ray erickson the pastor who is senior and uh yet he got up and preached the message and he said i'm i'm here to tell you today what charlie and rachel collins believed i like that i like the fact that we don't miss an opportunity to tell them if you need the lord and you're not walking in the faith you need to find your faith and as brother greeley mentioned today backsliders there who have known the way and who have walked away from it and they had an opportunity to hear again the good news of the gospel and so i i'm sad for those families i can't imagine we celebrated just this week five years of the car of the truck accident that could have taken our boy's life so my heart was already tender and then this then this news came and uh every parent's nightmare and you can't help but think of what they're going through but so much was settled for me when the dads could get up and say to god be the glory god doesn't make me listen folks that's the god i serve i want to have a faith like that somebody said well it's just normal to question god the believer doesn't question god when when questions come to our mind we sh we pull that down we say wait a minute you have no right to question god he never makes a mistake and he is not obligated to tell us why one of these days can you imagine strolling with him i'd like to spend some time with you in eternity uh does that make any sense what i just said does that make you i'd like to spend some time with you in eternity that's impossible i'd like to spend some eternity with you in eternity i'd like to stroll over heaven with you but i'd like to stroll over heaven with him and he's going to tell me some things and i'm going to say oh my why didn't i see it before that's why that's why that had to happen that's what you spared me from can you imagine him just pulling up a little screen and saying this this is what you could have had this is what was ahead oh we are grateful people today because we serve a great big god would you thank god for these musicians and these who give them their gifts today [Applause] i'm missing my amen corner brother daniel miller i'm missing him today he's a one-man amen corner and if that bothers you if you'll yell and holler as loud as he does you won't be bothered he is a preacher's delight he pulls it out of me and i wouldn't i wasn't happy when i heard they wouldn't get to be here today guess where they are massachusetts who would want to be in massachusetts that's a long way away but they're on a run and they'll be home this week and we send our love and greetings to them and every one of you who are streaming this service in trinidad across the nation uh here's missouri and arizona and indiana cape town south africa ghana israel india and it goes on i wish you folks would send me a flag or send me the name of your nation i can't always remember where you're from here's another one from israel god bless you for streaming in israel then i looked up here in one of the other streaming uh methods that we have and someone was streaming from egypt god bless you sister in egypt what a wonderful thing that god would let us be connected this way together any good and i i know there's all kinds of things you could be streaming so thank you for for taking time and being with us could we stand for the reading of god's word he's here with us today and i want to thank brother david for helping us with the air conditioning he's a real real servant and a real blessing the most important man i know sometime when the air conditioner is on the blink he is my hero just the day after the great loss he was over here charging and feeling and working and sister i looked out the window and saw sister sandy out there and and we just had a nice talk and it's just wonderful to serve the lord are you folks rushing me please don't yesterday they celebrated uh ariely's birthday 13 years old how can that be possible i still remember being there at her house the day she was born and uh while she was being born and i'm out in the in the kitchen grandmother comes out and says brother shelley you got to pray now there's a little complication and you've got to pray now and we all just prayed and believed that everything was going to be all right and it was only just a few minutes later that the news came from the midwife everything is fine she was a beaut one of the most beautiful babies i'd ever seen in my life and she's still one of the most beautiful girls and i'm so thankful that we had a little bit of time to celebrate her today is sister sharon's birthday although she forgot and kind of got it off a little bit and i'm thinking well i looked i didn't see it there she thought it was saturday we can get these days of the week messed up but today is her birthday and that means we get a chance to tell her happy birthday in person god bless you tomorrow sister elita and brother richard have an anniversary we say happy anniversary to them and uh on wednesday nora lamb has a birthday and uh i call her nora lamb because she's a little lamb and because nora lamb was a great chinese missionary woman and i had an opportunity to meet her one time in my life they made a movie about her life called china cry and i read the book about her life so i called nora nora lamb and her birthday is on wednesday of this week how old does she turn norah how old are you are you going to be bashful four four years old happy birthday [Applause] then it looks like michael christian has a birthday next saturday i'm not going to ask him how old he is but slightly older than four i'll tell you that right now and there may be others but i don't have them in my calendar maybe but if you'll call them out anybody call call out a birthday or anniversary i missed first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 in the amplified version of the bible i want to carry on just a little bit this morning from the message total deliverance requires total separation from unbelief this is our daily grind we are separating ourselves from all unbelief because that's what sin is sin is unbelief it's not what you do it's what you believe or fail to believe so i came from the old pentecostal church and everything was sin and so if you stop doing those things you are no longer sinning the problem with that kind of theology is you never deal with the unbelief that's in your heart so you struggle the rest of your life to believe if you can deal with unbelief in your life you will be able to step away from the attributes of sin and the attributes are unbelief of unbelief for all these things we do in themselves not sin but attributes of sin attributes of unbelief now the apostle said and may the god of peace himself sanctify you through and through king james says holy w-h-o-l-l-y separates you from profane things make you pure and holy consecrated to god and may your spirit and soul and body the tripartate man spirit soul and body be preserved sound and complete and found blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ the messiah would you mind very much if i read it again may the god of peace himself sanctify you through and through separate you from profane things make you pure and holy consecrated to god and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete and found blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ the messiah can you think of a greater prayer to pray for somebody this is a marvelous prayer it's a marvelous blessing to release that god would so sanctify you and so deliver you all of you spirit soul and body and then preserve you so that nothing could steal that deliverance from your life and that you be whole at the coming of the lord jesus christ father thank you for your word today thank you for the promise of total deliverance and we ask that you help us to prepare our lives for the full demonstration of your promise and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the exalted name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen the saints said again you may be seated and god bless you from vancouver british columbia and also from the philippines how wonderful to be preaching today in the philippines in the message how can i overcome i want you to follow this one we just read this to you last week either sunday or tuesday night i want to go through this quickly so that we can move on look temptation was for him you know that the bible said he was tempted in all points like we are don't forget these last three powerful words yet yet without sin he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted what did you think the scripture meant what did you think the bible meant when it said he was tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin well you you must have thought he was tempted not to go to sunday school to be a real holy roller to wake up on a sunday morning and roll over and go back to sleep you must have thought he was tempted not to pray as much as somebody else but the bible said he was tempted in all manner as we are so you think about your temptation you think about what the enemies tried to pull you into and then you will know that in every way that the enemy tried to tempt you he tried to tempt him whoa and none of it could pull him into unbelief why because he knew who he was somebody said because he was god no because he was god man but it was because he knew who he was he knew who he was he didn't have to go to church to find out who he was in fact when he went to the synagogue in luke chapter 4 the prophecy of isaiah was fulfilled because he recognized who he was by the reading of his own commission and mandate the spirit of the lord is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach he knew exactly who he was and when he went to sit down he left the rostrum by saying this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he knew exactly who he was he knew where he had come from he knew where he was going back to and because of that all the enemy could do was tempt him but he could not bring him into unbelief do you know what would happen in your life if you got a true and genuine revelation of who you are in christ and who christ is in you did you know that you would be able to reject every temptation that the enemy would throw in your way because you would recognize you came from god and you're going back to god and nothing that the enemy used against you would be successful brother branham said if that bride has a revelation a real revelation of who she is nothing would be able to touch her nothing would be able to stop her nothing would be able to dissuade her i dare say to that the most important thing for all of us today would be to have a revelation of who we are in christ and who christ is in us because if you recognize who he is in you you'll understand what brother greeley said this morning when he said he cannot lose his own i wonder if you're listening to me are you with me this morning i'm here to work for you i've spent all week in the word and so i'm ready but i'm here to labor for you i'm here to get this to you i can go on this has helped me this week but i want to see if i can help you he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir overcome means this is what i've got to this is what i wanted to get to because the bible tells us in the book of the revelation and under the church of laodicea write these things and to him that overcometh write these things he said it also to ephesus in fact he said it to all of the seven churches of asia minor which were not only present-day churches they were also representative of ages of church entity or church history and when we understand that we know that god sent a message to the church just like he's doing today there's a message going to the church today it's on youtube it's on google it's on the internet it's in the churches of america but that's not all i'm interested in i not only want to know what he's saying to the church but i have a personal reason to find out what he's saying to the overcomer because i have a revelation that i [Music] can you pull that up how quick are you all can you pull that clip up hawk that we shared i shared it you can find it on eagle's refuge formally uh wounded believers you can find that clip let's play it why don't i save myself why don't i save my breath why don't i let him preach it from two years ago and then we'll go on isn't he good all the time overcome i'll keep reading it although you won't be able to see it up there paragraph 105 overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks did you know that every time he comes to you with a trick if you could recognize that you would rip his success right out of his hot hands he would not be able to be successful in anything he wanted to use against you because you'd be there saying aha that's a trick aha that's the enemy trying to disturb my peace come on aha that's the enemy trying to distract me in this last hour and if you were able to do that every single time there's nothing that you wouldn't be able to overcome i want you to know overcome is not just an action overcoming is an identity i am identified as an overcomer even when my thinking is not overcoming thinking hallelujah are you all getting any closer there we go there we go right there i have arrived i can just sit back let me let me preach on video i went back and watched this myself got blessed in the house listen [Music] you don't have to make another miserable trip around the mountain you can catch yourself i can catch myself in this hour and i can say lord i don't need much more squeezing i just need a whole lot more surrender sometimes we just need to take our hands off and say god do whatever you need to do to bring me [Music] i could never pray a prayer like that you say well why is that is it because you don't trust him maybe you wonder what he's out for yeah maybe you wonder what god's motive is for putting his finger in your business i'll tell you why because you were chosen to be an overcomer i am you i am because overcoming is a calling i am cold as an overcomer i'm that i am an overcomer when i'm drowning i'm an overcomer when i'm coming up the rough side of the mountain and barely making a half an inch i'm still an the overcomer quickening power lives inside of the believer when i feel defeated i am still an overcomer when i think like a defeated man i'm still an overcomer so i need the spirit of god to draw me back [Music] into my calling but we must not resist the discipline of the lord yes and we must receive it with the right spirit one that glorifies god yes yes against all odds come on one that looses a testimony among the brethren yes among the people of god ah this has nearly destroyed me but it has not been able to steal my praise this is the most glorious testimony of the overcomer it's the testimony of paul and silas and many others through the book that when it looked like they couldn't get over it he somehow strengthened them and they embraced the good love the sweet love the seeker sensitive love and they also embraced the tough love of the lord anybody ever had to embrace the tough love of the lord let's praise god he loves us i am an overcomer my friend drew said i am he said i am i am an overcomer and you are brother you are you absolutely are now in paragraph 105 he said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he said a lot of people says there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real don't underestimate the enemy but don't fear him either he said you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you don't that sound easy it sounds so easy and yet we get spiritual amnesia when we need to know it the most when we're going through something he said you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is the enemy that the one that's in you has already overcome him can you say amen already overcome him and by his grace you are you read it for me amen why because the overcomer lives in me because my identity is with my overcomer and he lives in me and because he lives in me that makes me more than a match for the enemy somebody said i think that's a little boastful to say we're not boasting on us we're boasting on the god that lives inside of us how could a dad get up and say the things he said yesterday over the the bodies were not there because there's still an autopsy going on and an investigation going on and just a few days after losing a dear son 23 years old and yet he can stand up and speak of his faith as an overcomer because he knows who he is in god and he knows who christ is in him and he knows that nothing is going to happen in their life that god will not help him get through when you know that you're an overcomer when you recognize the enemy on all of his tricks every one of them you are an overcomer are you still with me in the message of total deliverance paragraph 53 i want to share this with you before we move move on a little bit are you still here i know i keep asking you that because i want to know it he said and the member of the church he's called to be a member of a certain group then he would not compromise if the church believes that we should not gamble then that member should never touch a deck of cards and i agree with the prophet right there he said we don't believe in drinking he should turn his head completely he shouldn't be a sipping saint he should make a total stand a total separation from unbelief and that means not twisting scripture you certainly don't have a continual stomach ailment when you hear people say i drink a little wine to relax i want to tell you something right now it's a slippery slope i don't care whether folks amen that or not it's nothing but the truth if any of you have dealt with family members who are alcoholics you have no tolerance i have no tolerance for sipping saints you've got to get all the way away from that unbelief stand away from it get away from it he said if you do not believe in gambling or smoking the member of this church should never touch such a thing and i want you to hear this sentence because this stands against a lot of people's idea god gives you can have it i want you to look at your neighbor and say you can have complete deliverance yes over what everything everything whatever the enemy tries to hold you with you can have complete and total deliverance over that because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you can have complete deliverance because god gives it he said he will do it if we'll there it is completely surrender you can't be fighting for your rights brother and completely surrendered to him at the same time you know in all of this protesting and all of this thing we went through in the last few years in our nation where everybody is fighting for their rights did you know that's the very spirit of laodicea that's part of what laodicea means it means the age of people's rights and so you've got people fighting over this we have rights we have rights we demand our rights it's a spirit of the age and it's the very opposite of what brings us to total deliverance total deliverance is requ separation and surrender is required to walk in complete and total deliverance which means we say lord i surrender all my rights and all my privileges and all the things i think i'm entitled to i surrender all of that to you now you come and have your way in my life if we will completely deliver ourselves into his hand then god can live in us christ are you there christ the hope of glory he can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way then our thoughts is this sounding good to anybody then our thoughts are his thoughts could you imagine christ smoking a cigar the reapers live right up the street from a place where they have humidors where the speakers who come through they can go and take something out of the humidor that's how far the church has fallen in this hour he said can you imagine christ smoking a cigar could you imagine drinking or playing cards christ sitting around doing that then if your spirit is part of his spirit he wants it to be upon your confession but you permit the devil to come in and take over and all the time in your heart way down deep you know you're wrong when you do those things most people know most people know and the way they combat it is to say that the teaching against it is legalism and preaching against it is religious and religion and so forth we don't fall for that kind of garbage said when one member would talk against the other member you know that's wrong it's not just smoking it's not just drinking it's not just these other things that are attributes of unbelief talking about one another it's an attribute of unbelief when there's no purpose in it when there's no healing at the end of it when there's no hope for the person when you're done he said you're commanded to pray for one another not to talk against one another but to what and if someone is down do what let's pick him up and help him they sure need it and we need to be there and available to help he said now that makes us a unified group of believers now when we don't obey that then we don't obey god we displease god and therefore our church our people cannot prosper the church cannot go on it's because we are disunified together imagine being disunified together as jesus said a little what 11 11 if the whole lump now i want you to turn in your bible if you have it they'll have it soon on the screen to revelation chapter 4 verse 1. we're still talking about total deliverance and you may remember that total deliverance or the year of the lord's favor as isaiah prophesied we mentioned it just a moment ago it is associated with a trumpet are you here a silver trumpet just like this one this was the sound this was the horn that sounded the jubilee and in that 50th year of jubilee every slave every indentured servant everyone who was slaving to pay off a debt on that 50th year at the sound of the jubilee trumpet they were free it didn't matter if there was 50 left on the debt or fifty thousand dollars left on the dead oh ain't that good but when that jubilee trumpet sounded you could drop your hole your working was over your slave was over you were free you could just walk right out of the field praising god for the sound of the jubilee trumpet now i won't associate that trumpet with the revelation 4 1 trumpet he said after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven that reminds me of many years ago when we were having a very spiritual night in our home a spiritual trespasser had showed up in our home that night and had to be dealt with in a rather harsh way before or or maybe after but i think it was before that there was a sound that went through our house and it sounded like a wind rushing through the house down the hall and out toward the living room and olivia was just a little girl then the one who was up here singing if you didn't know and she cried out and she said the door is open she's sound asleep the door is open that's part of what brought me to full attention and helped me to recognize what had invaded our home and had to be dealt with and it reminded me immediately of revelation 4 1 because that's where we've been preaching it says after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me now this trumpet it's a voice but it sounds with such authority that it is associated with the blast of a trumpet are you getting that he said a voice a trumpet i heard as it were of a trumpet talking with me you know trumpets don't talk they sound a note and it's a loud note it's a blaring note but this was a voice and a message and the message was of such authority that it sounded like a trumpet sounding so the voice is a voice of jubilee the voice of jubilee is saying to john i i've opened the door for you john and now i want you to come up hither the door is open john i want you to come up higher i want you to come up hither and i will show the things which must be hereafter how many of you know that is the rapture the total fulfillment of revelation 4 1 is the rapture resurrection that's what it is the prophet tells us that you don't read any more about the church you've just gone through the church ages in revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3 and then he tells us that the rapture is taking place here this is where it's placed in the revelation chronologically is revelation 4 1 he said you don't have any you don't have the church appearing anymore until revelation 19 so the church leaves in revelation 4 the church returns with christ in revelation 19. come on now why is that so important because jubilee and the voice of jubilee is also identified with the resurrection the dead coming back to life how many of you know there's a spiritual resurrection needed in our lives before we look for a physical did you know deliverance is a resurrection did you know death will set in spiritually in your life until you can have no victory in christ you can't overcome anything because you are in a state of spiritual death you're just a a form you are just a shell you are empty because you have allowed unbelief to so take control of your life that that almost like your nature you just pick up the things and you just participate in the thing say things and do things that you know better than doing but you're just all occupied with the things of this world you need a resurrection death is trying to set in in your spirit man come on and when that voice of resurrection sounds and when the voice of authority sounds like a trumpet and says get up here i would to god every one of us would hear that today get up here what are you doing down there worrying about all that nothing get up here where i am i want to talk to you i want to tell you some things that have not yet been made personal to you in your life with a revelation i want you to hear some things in the message the feast of trumpets paragraph 135 he says this now notice the trumpets that we're speaking of is a call together for either a feast for war for a person some sacred day or something like that notice you say for a person yeah or for the year of jubilee the announcing of the coming of freedom lord have mercy i feel like the holy ghost is trying to announce to us that the freedom that you've been looking for and the deliverance that you've been seeking is just around the corner if you can just keep holding on and quit giving in to death and start reaching for life if you could just rise up today and deal with the unbelief the residual unbelief that remains in your life if you could deal with it i've got a feeling that the announcing of the coming of freedom hallelujah is happening in our midst he said when they could go back now we could take a complete mourning on just that one thing but now getting into the trumpets he said you got the background now of the seals and the church now we're going into the trumpet the trumpet sounded and the trumpet denotes either war or a feast day or what it means is a gathering together of the people how many of you want to be gathered with the jubilee voice not a voice that binds us not a voice that keeps us in our denominational creed but a voice hold it up alias hold it up a voice that calls us back to the absolute that's the jubilee voice you've got to make it fit the word if your life will not fit the word you need a different life if your lifestyle won't line up with the absolute word of god you need another lifestyle if your habit or your hobby will not line up with the word of god you need a different one because that is our absolute he said now what it means is the gathering together the people the trumpet let's read on paul said when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound god help us who can prepare themselves for war or for peace or whatever it is how would you like to go to battle with a pitiful trumpet player one that didn't know the difference between between waking you up and putting you to sleep one that didn't know the difference between reveling taps you didn't know whether you're supposed to be waking up in the morning or going to bed or laying down in the grave what would you do if your leader did not give you a clear message one that you could follow listen the days of ambiguous messages and unclear messages it's over now the word is open somebody say amen it's no longer a sealed book to the bride of christ oh that book that was sealed in revelation chapter 5 we don't see that book again until revelation chapter 10 in revelation chapter 10 we see a mighty angel coming down from god out of heaven with a book opened in his hand what book same book you saw closed in revelation 5. when a search was made hallelujah who's worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof and a voice a one one a lion a lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed to take the book and loose the seals thereof and while they're bracing themselves in heaven for a lion to come walking out the bible said from the midst of the throne there came a lamb it's a glorious mystery the lion is a lamb because in order for you to walk in overcoming victory like the lion you have to understand that your lamb is a perfect sacrifice i want you to know there were no perfect worshipers in the tabernacle there were no perfect worshipers in the temple there's not going to be any perfect worshippers in here so you got to make sure your sacrifice is perfect you've got to make sure your offering is perfect and i want you to know jesus is how many of you know he's the lamb of glory he's the lamb of glory [Music] he's perfect let's read on paragraph 136 paul said when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare themselves for war for peace or whatever it is who knows you have to know what the trumpet sounds therefore when the trumpet sounds we see something in the earth today there is a great trouble somewhere everybody knows it everybody has become neurotic if that was true in 64 what do you think it is in 2022 you say a little something they don't like canceled you never existed well there's never been such a day they'll throw their favorite actor they used to would die for their pop singers they used to die for their stars now you just let their star say one thing they don't believe and they cancel them it says so they never existed because the world around us is getting more neurotic every day he said the whole world is a neurotical world and we know there's something wrong the pentagon everywhere we know there's something wrong yes we do he said now the only way you'll know what the trumpet sound is is to look what the sheet music says what the music sheet says hold it up again there there's the sheet music anybody with me you don't get to write that as you go along that's your absolute and if one person tries to come and tell me it don't mean that i don't care what you think it means i'm depending on the holy ghost to interpret the word we don't need man's opinions to tell us what the word means we've got the holy ghost to do that when he the spirit of truth is come he will lead you [Applause] you'll leave the rest behind you'll leave your church entity behind you'll leave your favorite preacher behind once you hear the jubilee voice calling you back to the word calling you out of slavery into sonship that's it he said that's all it's a great symphony sea and beating yes beating there's a cadence in the spirit did you hear me there's a cadence in the spirit and some people never hit it you you ought to try to catch the spirit behind the song you can sing the song and you can deliver it better than the one who wrote it as far as quality and style and and pitch and tone of voice but until you have touched the spirit of a song the inspiration that a song was written in did you know we have found out that sometimes the holy ghost will take a song to a new inspiration take it to a higher place than the composer wrote it somebody said well look what happened down there in australia what happened in the in the hill song what happened in that group so we throw all that away we throw all those songs away let me tell you something i don't have to do such a thing as that i can discern we can work through something and find out if there's something we need to get rid of or not but i want you to know the holy ghost can take a song to a higher inspiration than the one who wrote it how can that be possible because the bible said that the gift of the that the gifts are without repentance the callings and gifts of god are without repentance so there's people under a wrong anointing writing songs that god can use for his glory we just have to pull them out and redeem them [Music] somebody said i went to your church for the shell and you all sung the truth is marching on and it offended me well obviously the only reason why i did is he was on the wrong side of the war that's not what we're singing about you see well that's what it was written about i don't care what it was written about we're taking that song to a higher level mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord come on god's truth is marching on glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on if that's if that song makes you want to go re-fight the civil war you're under the wrong spirit if that song anoints you to be prejudiced against somebody because of their race you're under the wrong spirit honey this has nothing to do with black or white or yellow or polka dot or any other no sir we're talking about a higher truth so you just sing a song like that written under the under the effect of war and you get all twisted up and upset about something like that you're missing it because if i've ever told the truth i'm telling you now god's truth is marching on it doesn't stand still for anybody he doesn't stand still for any church any dogma any creed god's truth just gets higher and higher and higher as a jubilee voice says get up here get up here [Applause] it's a great symphony sea and beating like peter and the wolf how many of you have ever heard the symphony of peter the wolf what what a piece of music the composers wrote the book director must be in the same spirit of the composer when he wrote it he knew how he wanted to sound he knew how he wanted one instrument to be louder than the other boy you have that you have a hard time with that sometimes because everybody wants to be the loudest so you get a bunch of musicians together and everybody just wants to play the loudest why is it so quiet i'm not talking about our musicians but if i if they're guilty i am but i wasn't referring to them but i've i've been in groups of people we've had them here they didn't care whether you could hear the piano or not but they marched up to the sound booth to say i need more on my guitar let me tell you something you're not here to be the star of the show you're here to flow in the spirit there's times i hear the drums prophesying and there's times i want the drums to be a little more quiet than they are sometimes i hear the bass prophesying and sometimes all i hear is thump thump thump you see the the one who is directing this thing has to be in the same inspiration as the one who wrote the piece of music he has to be in the same spirit of the composer if he don't he gives the wrong beat you know i know people that are just sing a whole song in the wrong tempo i can't always do that sometimes i do it for the sake of of community but sometimes i say what i know it hurts the anointing i know i know it i know it causes people to be shocked but sometimes you say whoop that's not the right tempo let's get the right tempo here sometimes we're blaming the drum when it ain't the drum sometimes we're the ones out of the tempo uh singers can get quite out of rhythm too sometime let us say amen we're not just talking about natural here kind of we're talking natural now but i'm talking about something more spiritual than this you know we had a service not too long ago where there was something off in the music and there was a sound that was off and we had to stop the service and kind of pray a little bit to try to get back above that why because every now and then heaven's music breaks down into the earth and we begin to realize what's happening in a higher realm and a sound that's coming out of a higher dimension than the one we live in listen praise and worship is a vital in part a vital vital part very very important part to what we're doing here i know the word must take preeminence but the word must come forth in the right atmosphere and the atmosphere is not created by the word the atmosphere it's created by the anointing and the anointing is drawn in by the praise and the worship if you don't give the right the wrong beat there the whole thing gets out let's go on 140. that's what's the matter today we got too many directors i sure could sister man that'll preach right there got too many directors too many trying to take care of business instead of letting the one that's appointed to take care of the business take care of the business now just for instance when we come to a worship service the one leading the worship is in charge that means the instruments follow that lead you're not to lead worship from the guitar meaning you let the guitar lead the worship come on you decide how it ought to be i remember here some beautiful girls wanted to sing a song one time and they couldn't sing it because it wasn't the preference of a family member and so they couldn't sing the song and i'm thinking to myself would you really cheat us would you cheat us out of the gift would you cheat us out of being able to hear what we might could have heard and been blessed by because you've got a preference here and if the thing was ungodly or unworldly we didn't want it anyway but i don't think it was in the first place but if somebody can't be in control sometime they want to just put a big bushel barrel over everything just hold it all back i don't want to hold anything back i want it to fly hallelujah i want the service to fly i want every one of us to get in the spirit of the composer they say the denomination well we believe this no matter what you say the bible's right beat it out according to the sheep music right here hold it up again elias beat it out according to the sheep music right here before it then the great symphony of god's great act is playing out just right then we can see the hour and where we're standing thank you brother hallelujah now notice the trumpet is to call together the people assemble themselves together for something sometime it announced an important person are you still here sometimes it did now i want you to uh i want you to give me this day the scriptures fulfilled this is the last one in that and then we're moving on just stay with me a little longer we're still here still doing good not out of time yet the acceptable year as we all know as the bible readers was the year of jubilee that's when all slaves and prisoners as they were were taken prison and had had to give a son to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they had been in bondage or how long they are supposed to stay there when the year come of the jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free that's a good question do you want to go free are you interested in freedom are you interested in complete deliverance then you must recognize the sound of the jubilee voice you must place yourself under that inspiration come on that's what that's the quotes we read when we started this series said you've got to get under that when the year come of the jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free you're free he was no more slave but if you desired to remain a slave if you desired to remain a slave you'd have to be taken down to the temple stood by the temple post and they took an aw and bored a hole in your ear that's why my preference is i don't like these holes in women's ears i don't like that my preference i don't like that because i understand the history of where this come from goes all the way back to the bible and if somebody said no i'm not going free i love i love this master i'm just going to serve the one i've been serving that don't sound right to me i'm just going to serve the one i've been serving so then they took them down stood by the temple post they took an owl and bored a hole in your ear then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days if you studied this history of it they put a ring in there and then you have to serve that slave master the rest of your days he said what a perfect example it is of the gospel of jesus christ how is that how is that he said when it's preached the acceptable time and the time of jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how how it's far you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound out there you are free but if you turn your back upon the message and refuse to hear it notice what message the sound of the trumpet notice you're bored in the air within all that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you'll stick to church you'll have just enough religion to justify your own conscience he said you must be a slave to the system you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year would you hate to be a slave to a system if it wasn't what god was calling you to if he was calling you to a higher play come up hither and you stayed down in some kind of mishmash or some kind of mixture some kind of unclear water he said now the other part of it as i said didn't need to be answered because this coming messiah a time now is when it will bring judgment pretty powerful isn't it now i want you to go to colossians if you will i know that we're a little weary here but that's all right we'll get through it colossians chapter 2. i i could read both if if i had lots of time i would read both but since i don't i'll go to the amplified he said having canceled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note the bond with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us hostile to us this note with its regulations and decrees and demands he set aside and cleared completely out of our way by doing what [Music] king james said blotting out the handwriting of the ordinances that was against us every not just accusation guilt we weren't just accused we were guilty we were guilty of transgressing the law how many of you recognize you were you were guilty i was guilty it's not just what the enemy had accused us of it's what we were guilty of ah but when jesus came to the cross guess what he did he took every legal uh case every case brought against us and nailed it to his cross verse 15 god here's what i want you to hear this is why complete deliverance is possible this is why are you with me this is the reason why god disarmed is that what it says god disarmed the principalities and powers that were arranged against us and made oh can i have verse 15 in the king james and having spoiled principalities good old king james i needed him right now and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it you hear it now give me the amplified verse 15 if you will god disarmed the principalities and powers that were arranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them triumphing over them in him and in the cross are you here a couple of things come to mind one is a naked emperor anybody remember the story he's convinced that he has such a royal robe he does not realize that he is riding around in his birthday suit did you know that there's a word here in the original that word spoiled and he having spoiled principalities and powers did you know that word spoil means to take off to strip off to disarm to take his gun away to renounce it also means to deprive someone of their power or their rights or their possession and here is the last definition of that word spoil to expose and to make naked what jesus did at the cross stripped the enemy of all of his power and then mocked him openly by parading his nakedness around the world by the preaching of the gospel every time the gospel is preached the enemy is naked he's disarmed his power has been taken away from him hallelujah he's exposed as a fraud created by god to serve the purpose of bringing perfection to the little bride of christ the enemy a tool in the hand of god to bring a bride to maturity now i'm telling you you don't have to be afraid of the hammer the if you've got any fear let your fear be directed to the one who holds the hammer the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the lord the lord is the one who holds the hammer the hammer is the enemy and the hammer is being used in this hour to bring the body of christ into her perfection and completion we are not to mock but we are not to be fearful we are to understand now there's a second thing that comes to my mind also carnal the naked emperor that's kind of carnal but sure does make a picture here that every time somebody gets up and preaches the liberty of the gospel that the enemy is stripped naked over there in the corner i love that well let me give you one more to to make a a public show of it reminds me of the little children playing with one another and they got i got a uh uh i got a lollipop that you don't have i got the last watermelon dum-dum like it was fighting over last night i got the last watermelon dum-dum and then what does a kid say sometime i know it's a brat when he does it but what's a little kid say sometime what nanny nanny boo that's when you won't slap them but that's abuse yes it is because when i think of slap i don't think the hinder part you know so no you you don't want to just swat them right across they're if they need it there's a place god gave them some they what what is that brother very much posterior protoplasm if that baby's not crying enough said they'll just give him a little posterior protoplasm a little swat on the hind end i can almost hear it like this it said this is what he did he disarmed the principalities took the gun away from the devil stripped him naked so that all that he can really be as a bluff and then paraded him openly around the world every time the gospel is preached the enemy is exposed and it's almost like the holy ghost is just saying nanny [Music] i know you all were too religious to laugh i love it i love it because when the devil thinks that he can't lose he's already lost he has no power but what you allow him why because he was spoiled let me read it again and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it parading bragging big open public showing of just how defeated the enemy really is of course we know what the scripture said if the princes of the world would have known in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 8 if the princes of this world would have known they would have not crucified the lord of glory they did not know they were falling right into the plan of the living god and bringing life really causing us to have life that we could have never had without him are you still here good i only need a few more minutes revelation chapter 12. go to verse 7. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against excuse me yeah and the dragon fought and his angels and prevail not neither was their place found anymore in heaven let's read on and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan all one which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god and night do you understand how powerful that is now brother branham puts this in the tribulation because he wants to show that once satan is denied total access to the heavenlies he comes to the earth and he steps into that image of the beast and he manifests himself satan incarnate in in the antichrist so to speak now i i know that that is right i know that satan comes down and steps into a man just like he did judas iscariot now remember the bible tells us we just mentioned it that judas was born for such a purpose as that so so yes you can be elected but not elected and predestinated to eternal life you can have another call another election judas did judas had an election he had a calling he had a purpose but it was not to be a born born again son of god and he only manifested that when it was time to go up to the upper room and he could not receive the fullness of the holy ghost he could cast out devils and do all the other things that the disciples were doing under the same inspiration of the ministry of christ but when it came time for him to go all the way up to the upper room and receive the baptism of the holy ghost brother braham said he showed his true colors what he really did was stepped into his election and the bible said from that moment satan entered into him right and that's how he was able to go out and do what he did and he became a part of the forerunning antichrist spirit judas was a part of that forerunning antichrist spirit that's why the apostles could say in the new testament that the antichrist spirit was already in the earth because it had already manifested itself in the life of judas and even when the true genuine son of god was dying on a cross judas was down in the valley dying on a tree is that right and so i want you to know i fully embrace this and i'm going to read the quotes but i also believe that we are living in an hour now now i hope you won't misunderstand me but i believe that we are living in an hour now where satan does not have open access to the throne and sometimes when people read these quotations they believe that it is the same today as it was in the book of job and that the enemy could just walk in unannounced without an invitation he one time had open access he was once the worship leader he once led the worship in the heavenlies we read in hebrew when we look at the hebrew that his body was created for such things that even in his physical form were pipes and tablets that made music when he would walk before the throne when he would dance and move before the throne even his physical body would release music and sound through the praise of god it's part of the reason why pride was able to get a hold of his life that's why we see pride and music running together in many many situations we see that spirit of pride many times moving among music and we also see the perverted spirit many many many times moving around the music we see a lot of homosexuality and a lot of these kind of perverted things moving around music so what do we do we have to be on guard because the enemy is always trying to take what god blessed and pervert it and music is certainly created by god for his praise and glory so i think sometimes people hear what brother branham said about him being cast down they look at it as revelation 12 and they say but they that's because they think that all of the book of revelation is written in chronological order and we know it is not because sometimes we're reading what's happening in heaven and what's happening in earth simultaneously sometimes we're reading something that has already taken place in the earth but is now being spoken about in heaven or already taken place in in heaven that's now being spoken about on the earth so we have to carefully follow the sequence of the book of revelation if we're students of the word amen and so i think sometimes when people read this they they can just picture a devil that just walks in before the throne whenever he wants but i just want you to know he can only come at the bidding of the lord now if this scripture had its total interpretation in the tribulation then some very interesting language is being used here so let me read it again he said i heard a voice saying in heaven in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night what i believe is happening here is the authority is now what god has already accomplished in these things is now being appropriated in the earth and the enemy is no longer serving in the role of an accuser but he is now tabernacling himself in the body of a man in the in the uh really the tripartite demonstration of the antichrist spirit now it's a little a little complicated and we can talk about that another time now we know that the enemy is busier now in the earth than he is in the heavens so if he is bid before the throne he goes he has no choice but i don't want you to think that he's just waltzing in any time he gets an opportunity the cross settled that a lot of his power was stolen from him at the cross now one of these days he's coming out of the print not out of heaven he's coming out of the heavens how many of you know the earth's atmosphere is the first heaven the second heaven is where the enemy the prince of the power of the air has set up his throne in dominion and the third heaven is even in the dimensions of god the spiritual things the heavenlies that we talk about so this casting down is not satan being kicked out of heaven the throne that has already happened this is satan being cast down from the second heaven prince of the power of the air where he has taken up his dominion you know the prophet told us he is he's taken up his dominion there now he is kicked further he is pressed all the way into the earth in revelation 12 and that's when he steps in to personify the spirit of antichrist in a body of flesh and let me read this again and we'll talk about it a little more later but let me read it again and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now it's come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night this was his original commission this is what he was doing after he fell accusing the brethren before god now the bible tells us he's loosed in the earth doing what anybody remember what the enemy what the bible said he does now he he accused his brethren to brethren he's not talking to god about job anymore he's talking to you about your brother anybody follow that all right now let's read on just a minute i'm taking too much time and i realize it and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death now in the message the first seal i want to go there and close as i wore myself out then a paragraph 362 and 363. he said then in revelation 12 79 when satan has cast out the accuser you want to put that down because i want you to read it we haven't got time now it's close 20 or 15 to 10 see but in revelation 12 7 through 9 satan the spirit the devil which is set up there now accuser of our brethren all right the church is taken up and satan is cast down now what i'm presenting to you is the churches taken to the third heaven and as we're passing through the second heaven satan is cast down and what happens then he incarnates himself in the antichrist did you know that in all likelihood the antichrist is alive in all likelihood he's alive on planet earth right now and he doesn't even know who he is he doesn't even know what he's doing he's just as religious as the next guy because remember he's not coming as merely a political figure he's coming as a religious figure and remember the spirit is going to be so close that it could deceive the elect that's why we know it's not islam we know it's going to be a religious spirit that he comes right full of all kinds of religious trappings all kinds of blasphemies but he's coming with all kinds of religious trappings amen and even the scripture begins to identify the location because it's sitting on seven hills they tell me there's a place in colorado where where seven hills surround the valley i kind of doubt that's where the antichrist is coming from i think there's a more famous place that runs in the spirit of romanism anybody with me i think we're going to see that antichrist spirit rise up out of that holy catholic church i'm just telling what i believe the book of revelation says and and i think that that the antichrist as a man is most likely alive right now just waiting on his turn waiting on his turn to have a position not even realizing that in that hour in that moment in that time when satan is cast out of the second heaven i personally believe he does not have open access to the third heaven at this time he could only come at god's bidding i don't believe he can go in and accuse you any time he gets ready to i don't believe that somebody said well the bible clearly says he's the accuser of the brethren he absolutely is and he spent many many years doing such a thing but not because i mean the lord is not busy doing his kingdom business and all of a sudden satan come in and interrupt the plan no no don't see it that way at all he rules from the second heaven he rules from just above the earth's atmosphere and one of these days the church is going all the way the bride is going all the way the enemy is coming down out of that second heaven and when he does he's going straight into a man then satan incarnates himself in the antichrist and is called the beast then revelation 13 he sets the mark down so if you want to know when these things will begin to unfold i have to tell you although the church is adopting another belief in this hour i have to tell you that the bride is not appointed to wrath and i have to tell you that there is a way out when he calls and that's by rapture mystery you see we're in rapture now but there's coming a combination of rapture that's going to end in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and you're going out of here the process has already started unfolding but the bride is going out of here because as long as she's here satan cannot have full authority in the earth why as long as the bride is here satan cannot have full authority in the earth why because you do because you do you mean to tell me i have full authority in the earth absolutely because of he that lives inside of you the voice of god the prophet told us the voice of god is in the bride in the last days so much so that she speaks the resurrection into place if we had a little more time uh i have some of that prepared for you where he talked about how god by the power of the creative spoken word how god created things in the old testament he said and if you can see that clearly and know that was god doing it under that old covenant why do you have such a problem believing that he's doing it again today he still has power let's stand i got this in so many different directions i wouldn't even begin to know how to pull it all together now to close so guess what i'm going to do stop musicians are coming there's total deliverance available [Music] free from all of it it's coming it's coming it's coming there's a people going to grab it there's a people reaching for it there's a people pressing for it whatever the enemy is using in this hour hallelujah he's defeated [Music] you believe that same man come we want to worship the lord but i've got to wait on them now
