oh and many times in trials the weakness blurs my vision that's when my frustration gets so out of hand but it's then i am reminded that i've never been forsaken and i've never had to stand one test alone that's when i look at all the victories and the spirit arises up in me and it's the rule of the fire my weakness is [Music] and he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to [Music] and he never offered one victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time oh just remember when you're standing in that valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on cause my lord he'll show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] cause i know within myself that i would surely perish oh but if i trust the mighty hand of god he'll shield those flames again [Music] be hard to glide and he never offered one victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you're standing in that valley of decision and the adversary said just give in just hold on cause my god he'll show up and he will take you through the fire again cause he never promised that the cross would not get heavy for that hill would not be hard to and he never offered even one victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time oh just remember when you're standing in that valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on just my lord he'll show up and he will take you through the fire again oh cause he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the who would not be hard to climb he never promised victory without fighting he said help will always come in time when you're standing in the body of decision and the adversary says giving just our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again oh yes lord yes lord you promised lord oh what promises you've made i will be with you even in you i will be with you even in you until the end of the world hallelujah glory glory hallelujah hallelujah what you're scared about what you're afraid of greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world [Music] you don't have to worry about

[Music] [Music] so [Music] there has never been a people in the history of the world more prepared to fight this great fight against darkness than the little bride of jesus christ and the same god who offered the scroll to john has offered you and i the scroll and if we'll take it and eat it by faith it will transform us from the inside out if you believe that same man let's give god praise tonight oh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah you may be seated tonight no apologies i just can't bring myself to apologize for that kind of carrying on we are equipped i'm so thankful tonight can you imagine living in this evil age with no equipment can you imagine facing it totally alone but because god has offered you the open book because god has offered us the open scroll brother branham said that john is a type of the bride so what you see god saying to john he's saying to us he said you take that scroll and you eat it and it'll be bitter sweet in your mouth and what in your belly bitter in your belly why wouldn't it be sweet in your mouth and sweet in your belly if it was sweet in your belly you might just keep eating it and eating it and never doing anything with it but it gets sour once it hits the body once it gets down in there and starts going against your denominational mindset once it starts talking about granny's religion and telling you granny didn't have the godhead right and uncle uncle george wasn't baptized in the name of jesus and you got to get that and you say well it was good enough for them it's good enough for me gets a little bitter down there but i want you to know god is transforming his people from the inside out and it starts working its way somebody said that's so gross they say that's so gross to talk about i didn't write the book all i know is what jesus said jesus said i would that thou art hot or cold the lukewarm i will vomit the word spit is vomit out of my mouth and so that same principle uh is is applied in this moment when that when that word gets down there and starts stirring and a little sour in the belly it starts making its way back up and he said what did he say prophesy again you must release that word god didn't give you this feast to keep it to yourself he gave it to us to release to somebody else i'm not even looking at your faces i'm trying to kind of just glance around because i've been i really don't have to have a lot of acknowledgement tonight when i know i'm telling you the truth and i'm not going to preach brother brooks is going to preach but that kind of song will make you want to preach oh you're one of those that doesn't fight like somebody's shadowboxing you're not just beating the air when the bride of jesus christ starts taking her authority and she starts speaking that word it hits the mark every time there's no principality there's no power there's no spiritual wickedness in high places that can stand before the authority of jesus christ in his elected lady in this hour if you believe that i'll give you a chance to say amen [Music] you are so welcome here tonight i guess i should look at you now we are so glad that you are here tonight and you all didn't know i had so much family in indiana did you i have so many cousins in alabama i mean in indiana even though i'm way down here in alabama and i don't want to embarrass them brother greeley has already made mention of them but i won't ever want him to stand because one big van load come in today and i haven't had a chance to greet them so all my alabama i mean my indiana cousins stand up would you right now isn't this wonderful thank you all so much thank you so much for coming i appreciate it god bless you all god bless you we are so thankful we've enjoyed the fellowship that the lord has given us and i said to him last night you don't ever know where these folk are going to pop up because i saw them way out in in arizona the first time and then i've seen them in ohio and now some of them have been this way about three times to alabama and we're so glad to have you all here brother uh brooks brother wilson hembree's son is back there you won't miss him he's a big boy and uh i remember coming to brother hembridge church one time to hear you preach and i'm telling you do you remember brian do you remember you remember what meeting we had i believe we can have a meeting tonight like that praise god brother curry again your people wonderful thank you all for being here we want to receive an offering tonight we want to make sure that there are no expenses left unmet for the for the camp and when as brother greeley said last night when brother uh brooks leaves here we want him to leave very very very blessed we want him to know that we believe in alabama that a laborer is worthy of his hire and when we give to the work of god and the servant of god we're giving for the kingdom of god and i have known brother and sister brooks for a long long time since their children were little and i have known the life that they have lived and the character that they have lived life with you know that really means something those scandals have brought them down because they've lived as close to jesus as they possibly could how many of you appreciate somebody with a testimony like that i don't have to coerce you i don't have to beg you or plead with you because most of us in this room and i i'm sure so most of the visitors too have learned through the years that you just don't out give god and you give some time until you think there's nothing left to give and what does he do but he opens up a blessing and it comes and we have people around here that when god does that for them they don't just say well i gave and god gave that to me they say i gave and god gave that to me now let me take part of this and give back to him well what does that do but create a beautiful cycle of sowing and reaping am i offending you by talking to something that's mentioned a lot in the scripture i don't think so you know people don't realize sometime until you start marking them down or listing them but you start looking at all those scriptures where god talks about of course it's a giving of ourselves our talents our gifts and you start seeing that god has fixed that law and it always works it if you sow a good seed you're always going to reap a good harvest well anyway that's just the promise of the lord father we thank you tonight for your servant that you have sent our way we have already been blessed last night by the word and he was apologizing for taking so much time but lord it was like a full meal to us and we were clinging on every word and i pray tonight that you will anoint him and use him to minister now lord we bring our offering to you tonight we lay it at your feet would you use it and multiply it and lord would you bless the ministry of brother brooks and his precious wife the churches that he sees after and those saints that you have placed in his care and lord we pray for his children and spouses and the entire brooks family lord that they can experience a a renewing and a refreshing and a reviving oh god and protect them and keep them in this evil hour we ask you to bless the giver and let it be poured out as you have promised press down shaken together and running over and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints of god said amen austin would you come here and hold david is he in here he's out david would you come and hold a bag one on each side if

the run yes as we stand hallelujah let's turn to ii timothy ii timothy oh i praise you jesus thank you i praise you lord you know i'm a worshiper of the word hallelujah i bow before the word hallelujah and uh whatever the word says that's right it's an amen i don't have to say a but it is soul amen so i thank god for his amazing grace and uh you know out of all the ages i am so glad that god brought me in this one it's difficult and i know but you know we were built for this we were made for this and it's we're not going to barely make it we've already made it y'all understand me amen this is not a a a try an effort maybe no sir this is already done yes sir it's already done and the devil don't want us to know that you know we we've got it in our heads but we need to drop down into the heart here amen because that's where the joy bells rings amen the ninth verse it says who have saved us and called us with the holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace and i just love the way he makes his grace in there with that purpose amen which was given us in christ jesus before the world began now how are you going to lose when it was given to you before you got here hallelujah and one thing i love about god he will never take it back he cannot take it back let us pray heavenly father we come before you and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and lord jesus we thank you tonight because we come to hear from you lord thou god we're just a vessel or just a piece of clay lord i pray that there be nothing in me oh god that would hinder your utterance in the end of your move lord let your holy spirit speak through us lord and speak to your people lord god we are in a time of need we are in a time where we should be revived hallelujah on fire for you lord and so we're calling upon your name because we know who you're the only one that can set our souls of fire hallelujah and we'll cry out tonight oh lord wants more do it again once more and father we give you the praise glory and honor in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated before i get into my message i just want to thank god for the many things that you know he's shown us and uh the thing that i love about god and the word that's open uh you know it's remember i ministered a little bit on last night i let the mind of god be in you it's so important that you and i make connection hallelujah because you can't be led by the spirit without being connected you understand me god will tell you things amen that's not written once you are connected it's in the book but it's unwritten word for an example when that woman with the issue of blood she needed help from god right and there was nothing in the scrolls that said to her if you touch his garment you'll be made whole but her mind connected with god's mind right you understand what i'm saying it bypass jesus is that right the man jesus it went straight to the throne of god it touched him and then because she touched him amen the word of god came down and she went in that inspiration and she touched him of his comet and then jesus said who touched me y'all hear what i'm saying you must understand that this is the age of the mind hallelujah this is the age where intellect is flourishing in the world [Music] even to a point they think they're smarter than god but what it is is that they're they're trying to figure things out by way of science hallelujah but we are understanding by way of revelation somebody help me here because i want you to understand that when you come to a place when you connect with god you'll never have to worry about whether god can hear you or not hallelujah science will fail you and we're living in a time where science is rapid uh some of the thoughts that i wanted to say last night i'm not sure if i said them but it was like in a time even when science was in the days of noah that god had to build an ark and that ark was to save noah from the men of science hallelujah and even in this last day because of the science we're living in the same kind of condition no one lived in but on a higher scale y'all hear what i'm saying and god has already declared that he has never left himself without a witness there's somebody who knows the lord there's somebody here tonight that's not ashamed of the lord there's somebody who is a witness for the lord hallelujah no matter what the world is saying about us hallelujah and so what i'm trying to say is we may look crazy we look like oddballs hallelujah it's only because we are connected and and what the devil is afraid of is for you to understand that you've never truly been disconnected the blood of jesus christ shared at calvary was shared to show you and to give you revelation that you who were sons and daughters have always been sons and daughters hallelujah without that blood being shed we were lost in darkness but because of the blood of jesus christ we are now coming to know who we really are hallelujah now i'm looking for a revival and i'm not talking about just dancing and shouting i'm talking about really getting the trash out of my life hallelujah amen you say well what do you mean i love all of that you all know that y'all know me i tell people don't don't don't invite me if you don't want me to dance hallelujah because i can't guarantee you nothing hallelujah so when it comes to this uh revival we're talking about uh y'all know the story there was a little story there in the bible and it was during the time of solomon and and these two women were basically ill famed women and and they both had babies around the same time it was a time like this time was getting hard amen the stock market had crashed and there was no food available so what israel began to do was that they began to eat their children and hello don't you understand what i'm saying you better know that you're living in america and the people here have no morals they have no standards hallelujah and when the stock market crash and when all of these things happen and there is no food hallelujah you better watch out for yourself now some of y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but cannibalism amen has not just started it's always existed even in the time when when when when uh uh uh 70 a.d amen when when the when god had already told amen his uh people to flee the city right and we find out and i can't think of his name the devil took me but anyway he marched on israel and he literally shut them in within the walls and they began to eat the bark off the trees they began to eat their children hallelujah and god had already talked to them and prophesied when you see the armies encamped about jerusalem you need to flee leave all of your stuff hallelujah and every believer that heard that sermon escaped y'all hear what i'm saying that's why it's so important to come to church every day the church door is open because the bible said when you see that day approaching come together the lord hallelujah you'll never know what god is going to say over this pulpit on the inspiration that will keep you hallelujah you say brother brooks god don't do that anymore yes he does when we first came out of the system in colombia we had almost every gift there was prophecy we had uh discernment we had it all and every time the police was going to uh attack the area that we're getting we were going to worship in we had a prophecy don't show up there go over here hallelujah and it never never did fail the police would come to the house that we previously would worship again and would find nobody hallelujah why because god always was a step head ahead of the policeman he's the same god today hallelujah but what happened we find out that one of these women baby they died during the night hallelujah and both of them came before and she stole the other lady's baby hallelujah and she came before solomon they both did and they both were claiming amen to to to to to to to say that they were the mothers hallelujah is that right but solomon having the wisdom he told his servant go get me the sword y'all understand me go get my sword what sword was it it was the king's sword hallelujah and that king's sword was able to divide it was able to to sort out who was the real mother [Music] hallelujah and understand those those babies was like a type of revival and we find out that the woman who says hey man whatever you want to do cut him in half you could give her pardon and you can give me part but you see the bride is not like that she don't want a halfway revival hallelujah and what did that other woman says no whatever you do i've got to have a whole revival hallelujah give the baby to her and solomon said no this woman she's the real mother y'all hear what i'm saying so we're not here in this age for a halfway revival oh glory to god we're here to have a full revival so much so that we'll bring him out of heaven hallelujah that's all right you say well brother brooks i want to tell you something you and i must understand that god speaks and then a lot of times people he'll tell you something and he won't tell others and you think well you know i'm going to tell them share with them what god has shared with me and you say well look what god did for me and they said oh okay okay they don't get it it wasn't for them hallelujah and what we need to do we need to learn and then how okay somebody says well let me tell you something brother adam said it like this he said when those seven seals opened he said all those shadows and types were symbolic of christ it literally gave us a story that we didn't understand and if we take those those those those those what we call stories and let the holy spirit minister to us we'll begin to see what that was all about because it was literally speaking in code for you hallelujah god telling you a story that the devil has read all of these years and never did understand it but by revelation he's giving to you what you need to understand about your path hallelujah and your purpose hallelujah is that right oh you say well what about bastard let me just go there because we remember vasta how many y'all remember some people call it vasti but vasti was uh first the queen's wife key's wife right and she represented the pentecostal church she was rich and increased with goods hallelujah and she right now she didn't want the king anymore why because her churches got so big she was the favorite of the king y'all know that's the truth because the prophet god even told us that the pentecostal church outgrew the catholic church hallelujah so she was the favorite but when the king called hallelujah when god sent a voice she didn't want to hear the voice she wouldn't come to the voice she literally put the voice out hallelujah you hear what i'm saying thank god for vastly thank god for what she did because of because of what she did it made room for us somebody help me here you see i want you to understand you're in the word and these shadows and types are telling you exactly what god is going to do for you hallelujah and here was a no-name church not a big famous one odessa hallelujah and mordecai gave her a new name y'all hear what i'm saying hallelujah i call you no longer church but bride you hear what i'm saying and so what happened she stayed in that place where she was hardly ever recognized though she was queen you hear what i'm saying and that's the way the bride is but you wait it's coming the pressure is building things are changing hallelujah and those of you who are ashamed you won't make it but for those who know where to go hallelujah you know that god loves you you know that you have been pan-picked by god you know that you have come in a time such as this hallelujah you see your purpose and your purpose amen is to turn the hands of time and you say what do you mean where the alpha becomes the omega hallelujah it'll be the bride amen total bride amen in the form of jesus christ god what happens you heard us i'm not going to go all the way with that but nevertheless when it came to esther she knew where to go and this is where our attitude and this must be your attitude if i perish let me perish i'm going to see the king got to see him brother if i perish let me perish if my mother don't go if my father don't go if my sister don't go if my brother don't go if my deacon a preacher don't go i'm going hallelujah if it's going to cause my death i'm going hallelujah you hear what i'm saying and by that attitude with that attitude she became victorious hallelujah god didn't build a bride to be a coward i'ma say that again and we've got no reason for cowing down to the devil's wine hallelujah god has made us omnipotent is that right all powerful and and we know amen how the man of god says when two omnipotents come together when they meet something's got to happen now you know what that means we're talking about holy ghost field people we're not just talking about sanctified we're talking about two holy ghosts feel people when they get together and they connect and agree something has to happen hallelujah you hear what i'm saying by god's grace let me give you one more example remember eliza because i want you to understand that we're now in with the headship we're we're connecting with the head the virtues of christ is moving up within us and so therefore before we make a rapture jesus christ must be the complete headship of the bride of jesus christ i'm not talking by word i'm talking about by manifestation hallelujah you understand me so what happens eliza says lord when i go see rebecca when i go when i go get this woman amen for isaac says lord let it be i'll put a decree before you let it be that when i go to this place and this woman comes out lord may she give my men water to drink and my camels is that right and the prophet god said god the angel of the lord went to uh rebecca he said about a half hour before eliezer got there because god works on both ends y'all hear what i'm saying god works on both ears and that's what we must understand you are never alone amen so he works on both ends hallelujah and god rebecca sees eliza and she comes out and all eliza's asked for he said give me a drink that's all he asked for he never said the other part he never but he said it to to abraham this is what i want her to do water the camels too see but somehow through that connection with god she knew the unspoken word was given to her by the angel oh lord help us jesus so you say what do you mean this is why this is a time of consecration this is a time of dedication this is a time when your eyes must be focused on jesus y'all hear what i'm saying it must be that way in order for you to catch him what do you mean we're working with dimensions hallelujah there's a radio in here that can pick up waves that you and i can't do but it's built to pick up waves hallelujah and the bride is built to pick up waves she's built to pick up the word or the mind of god is that right that's why the bible said let this mind be in you you've got to surrender to it you must let it be in you because when you surrender to it you will catch his thought you'll know exactly what he wants you to do sometimes he tries to connect with us even when we sleep he said get up and pray and you say lord give me 10 more minutes you just missed your connection y'all hear what i'm saying you're saying why don't you go over to susie's house and i hope nobody's named susie but go over to susie house and and visit her and encourage her y'all don't hear him talk like that oh i do he'll say call up a brother he needs encouragement y'all hear what i'm saying it's when you're connected and i hate to meet god miss god's connection i hate it because he'll tell you to do something and then the devil put a distraction in your way and and you'll follow that distraction and instead of what god just told you to do oh i hate that but nevertheless we do because he's teaching us we're learning amen to hear his thoughts oh come on somebody that's what rebecca did she heard his thoughts and because she heard his thoughts amen she not only gave ellie either water but she watered the camels too and ellie isn't this you're the one you're the one you are the one he didn't look for nobody else he started pulling out the gifts man you hear what i'm saying and people say we don't need no gifts we need everything hallelujah so when he comes he'll know that his gifts that were given to us were precious in our sight oh god help us jesus we are so far off and i tell people i said you know what i get so tired of systematic worship hallelujah you go to church you know what they're going to sing you know what the preacher going to preach you know how long he's going to preach you're going to go you're going to sing a little bit more and that's it that's too systematic there was a time when those old saints of god didn't know what time they were going to get out hallelujah the power of god faith i tell you what i believe that's the perfect will anyway because one of these old days we're going to reminisce and we're going to wish we had hallelujah just like some of us when the holy spirit hit us and and you'll hear something say raise your hand and you'll look around god you just grieved him you just grieved him how many times amen you sat in your seat and the holy ghost is moving people and all of a sudden you see an image looking just like yourself running down the aisle you know what you're supposed to do catch up with him you get a vision of your theophany and you won't even move what is it you have come into that channel you come into that dimension where your spiritual man can see the things that's happening in the spiritual world and you sat right there you'll never get victory like that hallelujah god always asked y'all uh uh the things uh for you and i to do that makes no sense if you think that he's going to ask you something that's going to make sense that's not god he never does is that right he totally lies at this throw that piece of wood in the water and the axe head is going to float huh what science book he was reading dang come on somebody that's not even that's that makes no sense in physics y'all hear what i'm saying but he did he he wasn't about he it had no science book he heard that he heard the voice of the god who was who made the science hallelujah it doesn't make sense touching the hem of his garment it doesn't make sense dipping seven times in the water to cleanse leopard set they don't even have a cure for leprosy today we got the cure hallelujah because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not right hallelujah and when it comes see i'm trying to tell you a lot of times we want to we it's good to read this we supposed to read this we supposed to know this but i'm going to tell you something sometime god talk to you you can't even see it i'm going with these little examples but god has said give that brother 50 i remember when god told me that one time i said lord that's all i got he said that's all i asked for huh huh yes sir i did what he wanted me to do guess what i got 500 back no tell me god knows how to bring your increase you think you've given up something no god want to bless you but in order for him to bless you you got to give it up is that the truth help us jesus you love the lord who have saved us now i said all of those things to get to my lesson because i want you to understand that when the book when god began to open this message and open this book up to us it became a new book it became more than just a a book of history it became a book of life hallelujah and understand this by the grace of god your predestination as as a lot of people don't understand is is according to your choice hello he predestinated you because you chose him y'all understand me but a lot of times people think that you know god predestinate a bad husband and predestinate a a good wife no he doesn't you made that mistake hallelujah god didn't do that to you you did that because you weren't listening but he will allow it to work towards your god [Applause] hallelujah you hear what i'm saying god knows we need to understand what that's all about some people think if i live any kind of way praise god i'm bright no you not hallelujah you got to live this thing hallelujah you got to be a vindication of this message y'all hear what i'm saying oh my he saved us you know what i'm saying why do you think the prophet god spent all that time telling you you better be careful who who you choose hallelujah and that is the truth if you choose a mule you marry them you that's your mew hallelujah is that right you just better make sure when you want a horse you better check out the dna make sure it's a horse you hear what i'm saying now it's the truth people think that god predestinate everything hallelujah but i tell you what i love it because he said listen all things work together for the good of them that love god hallelujah because you are elected because you are chosen god will manipulate things in your life and turn it that evil and make it good hallelujah hallelujah you love the lord saved us and that's what we must understand saved means to be saved it means to be delivered from all unbelief hallelujah sin is unbelief you must is that right the bride will have perfect faith that means she will be live be delivered from all unbelief hallelujah hallelujah every time i think about mary who was uh you know uh brought jesus into the world and when he was going to turn water into wine she told those people she said whatever he said do do it hallelujah hadn't even been to pentecost yet hadn't been down there with a holy ghost fail but she saw the word she knew he was the word she understood the word and she obeyed the word and even though it was out of season because jesus said it wasn't my time yet he did it y'all hear what i'm saying he did it and sometimes we might catch him out of season but he'll still answer your prayer hallelujah we've got a we've got a wonderful i tell what i'm enjoying this thing hallelujah i have my days where you you know it's here it's here let me tell y'all something maybe you don't know it and i don't mean to be pointing it because i don't want to be some point in somebody he was pointing right at me you know my point my point is amen let me say it like this satan is a deceiver and i don't know whether i say said that what i'm going to say here or not but you know what i love fried chicken i i've been delivered now i i usually i was a i was an addict i see y'all don't think so huh yeah you can have a burger fries and everything else and you still want your fried chicken oh come on y'all like y'all don't know what i'm talking about but when you got some good fried chicken you're across town to go get it it's the truth but you know what what he would do sometime he would make me crave it you know what i'm saying you go to your favorite chicken place you're craving it you smell it it's wonderful until you get your box now you don't cross all the way over town to get this chicken and they did not prepare it right and you're disappointed anybody know what i'm talking about hallelujah so i want you to understand that i enjoyed the craving better than i did the reality y'all understand me so what i'm going to where i'm going with this is that when you crave sin you better understand the craving is going to be better than the reality and he's not going to tell you what you in for until you've done something you shouldn't be doing. he's a deceiver he did it to eve didn't he he did not tell eve what was coming her way it was afterwards she realized she had done something that she could no longer fix oh come on somebody you and i right now have we we're redeemed but we've got scars in our lives because of things we did because of a craving hey and we had no idea we had no idea the affliction that was going to be on our flesh as well as our spirit oh don't even talk about the mind because even though you're saved that devil will still bring back those wicked things that you once did hallelujah and you got to shut him down and let him know this mind belongs to god hallelujah that's the way i used to be and when he comes to me i said oh devil i got you those are not my thoughts that's yours you're not gonna give me that i don't want it those are your thoughts and not mine and when you talk to him like that he's got to go hallelujah yes lord called us uh you know i think about it i says lord i don't know how many people are going to make us rapture but i'm one of them amen since i enjoyed that song i'm going to call her sister breakthrough but you know i want you to understand by god's grace breakthroughs are wonderful when you overcome something it's wonderful hallelujah because i used to drink and when god gave me grace to overcome it it doesn't bother me anymore i'm not tempted i can literally drink a communion wine without wanting to get some bottle or something y'all understand what i'm saying when you overcome something that means god takes the very desire out of your life hallelujah and don't tell me he's not able he's more than able hallelujah is that right yes because he called he listened he took a woman a woman who had seven mary magdalene has seven spirits hallelujah is that right seven demons and each one of those demons represented the church age [Applause] is the truth every church age had to overcome a certain devil hallelujah and understanding this age you have to overcome seven of them oh god help us jesus but when you overcome it you are free hallelujah no man will ever be able to put you into bondage again because you are free and you understand your freedom hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yeah everywhere i go you know people want to really shut you down but uh you know what i'm sorry god done gay first of all god gave me a godly mother who showed me that jesus christ was real hallelujah she showed me he was alive and i went to all of these churches and i saw all the hypocrisy and i says oh god whatever you do don't make me a hypocrite if you're going to save me save me to the uttermost hallel y'all hear what i'm saying you know so i i i know what god can do let me move on by god's grace see but you see she was the one that made me know that christianity was real my daddy was a muslim i could have gone that way but i saw christ in my mom i saw miracles in my mom i saw my mom listen don't tell me she could not even read or write but she knew how to call on jesus yes and what i'm trying to say is that's why i learned this message is not intellectual hallelujah they make it intellectual but that's not it hallelujah have you received the holy ghost since you believe hallelujah hallelujah yeah you can't get rid of the holy ghost you get rid of the holy ghost you get rid of everything hallelujah you love the lord let me i'm trying to go on because i want you to understand by god's grace amen that it's impossible it's impossible for the very elect to be deceived and i'ma explain that that's not because of your intellect that's because god sent a message he sent a message that opened our understanding to who the devil is and what he was made out of and therefore we could see and then the systems that surrounds us and we don't have to worry about the mark of the beast because we know we're not a part of it and there's something that grounds us so much so that we know that we'll never submit to it oh so y'all better understand because you don't call yourself a denomination doesn't mean that you're not a system hallelujah cain was a systematic worshiper you hear what i'm saying he did it just like he thought he should do it amen and he did a good job at it but he did not have the revelation and i'm going to something and secondly he did not have the bloodline you better hear what i'm saying because really that was the thing that made him do what he did he did not have the right bloodline whoa adam no doubt was a sheep and when he produced amen abel he was a sheep he was a lamb now i'm talking about nature now hallelujah because listen before adam fell he had the mind of god he knew what what god wanted to name those animals hallelujah because if you search the scriptures god had already named them but adam caught the thought holly oh come on somebody you may have heard this before but i'm trying to bring this to you you must come into that place where you can hear the mind of god and you'll know exactly what he wants to do is that right that's what he said he said the bride of jesus christ she has thus said the lord she knows what to do with the word hallelujah not because of her intellect and because how she figures it out but because she's connected she's connected he said this day will not take you as a thief hallelujah you'll know it's not going to take you as a thief and one of the things that people don't understand is that god wants to live in you but sometimes we think god want to work work a a plan of uh where he could have a duplex god ain't no duplex it ain't god and you you've got to die and rot to yourself hallelujah you've got to die and rot to yourself in order for god to live god ain't no no body system [Music] y'all hear what i'm saying i want you to understand so you and i must understand there's work to do you say oh brother don't don't don't don't don't die down on me my point is i'm trying to bring us to a place you need to know amen you know how let me say it like this if you talk to a woman or a boy girl whoever they mean and you say you're so stupid you just stupid and you keep saying it to that child they're going to believe they're stupid they're going to start acting like they're stupid hallelujah you understand me oh you you know you you you tell a boy you're just too sissified you're just sissified eventually he's gonna start acting like a little why you're cursing him hallelujah god is not giving out curses to his bride he's giving out blessings hallelujah see that's what when we was in the denomination in the organization they gave us a mixed tree they gave us evil and good is that right but jesus came along and he said make the tree either good or evil hallelujah but you see they say oh you got to do this if you want to get to heaven you got to do this if you want to get to heaven you got to do this and they made us work hallelujah is that the truth oh it's the truth every wednesday we had a fast day i didn't feel like fasting on wednesdays but i would do it because it was the law one day i was in i was going to the university of south carolina at the time i was walking down the street to the bus stop and i saw this old faithful sister coming out the ice cream parlor on a wednesday she didn't drop dead and i feel if i got me a cone i wouldn't either hello yes sir it was a law that was unnecessary we're led by the spirit [Music] glory to god and i'm gonna tell you something those kind of laws when you're not you're not led by the spirit to do it it's a hard day don't tell me i know 12 o'clock you looking at that watch it ain't it ain't six yet right three o'clock you done going in the kitchen you fixing everything you're gonna eat getting ready that's no fast you just starving yourself that's not unto the lord you're supposed to be in a place of meditation consecration hallelujah not waiting till the six o'clock bell ring and then you go in there and you eat to your heart [Music] but that's the way the system make us do oh my god have mercy on me oh i can remember the time brother i listen and i don't know how it was done i fasted about 15 16 days i lost track you know in the pentecost today apostolic whatever you call it you didn't drink water and don't ask me how i did it i did a lot of showering so i figured maybe the water went through the skin [Laughter] kept my teeth brushed so i could you know amen that's what i think that's what happened god preserved me in my ignorance i want to get close to god that ain't it when you get close to god you believe his word take god it is what that's how you get closer to him you drive now to me and i draw now to you hallelujah y'all got me preaching all off my nose hallelujah but let me say it like this one thing about the bride of jesus christ you are a special class of people you are a different species oh somebody should have shouted you are different you are god-kind you're baptized when god gives you the holy ghost he changes your dna oh i can't hardly stand it well my mama had high blood pressure so i i must have it well you're gonna have it and you're gonna keep it because you're not denying it god will work on you through the word now i'm not talking about moving in god presumptuously i'm saying it comes by faith and revelation and when you connect with god and god tells you you healed anybody know what i'm talking about when god says you heal not the preacher not the deacon but you hear it from inside and when god said you healed that's all you need [Applause] people say are you crazy no i'm not if he's healed me i don't care what it looks like i'm healed oh help me jesus you know what i'm saying connecting with god hallelujah we was on the radio the phone today and we went into an area i couldn't even hear the brother that was you know talking long distance well that's not light with god because first of all god don't speak long distance [Music] hello god is in you hey man he said don't say i'm up into heaven and don't say i'm going to fire off he said i'm naughty even in you i'm in you hallelujah i think a lot of times people think like i said this is where we thought and you know it's the truth oh that nobody could outshout me no nobody could out dance me no no no no no it's the truth i don't think there was a song that they played or sang i went up you know and the thing about it is they got mad at me because they said you were shouting i was shouting too much but you don't know where he brought me from you see you you don't know my story you know what i mean that's what people don't understand they judge you and say well that ain't necessary maybe it may not be necessary for you maybe it's not but i'm enjoying it [Music] right absolutely absolutely you know it's like like this and one of the things you know people do and i'm going on with the word now but let me use this one more illustration you know it's like when you a baby is eating a piece of candy and and you know that baby know it's good when you see him with that candy you might as well let him eat it you know what you know what we think well he that whole piece of candy he's going to be running here and there he's going to be bouncing off the wall but that's one of his pleasures he can't he can't enjoy steaks you know he can't enjoy a lot of other things but when it comes to that little lollipop or whatever oh my goodness and listen what happens when you try to take it from him he becomes a holy roller [Laughter] right he's going to fall he's going to scream he's going to roll you're going to know even though he can't tell you one word he's crying his body language is going to tell you he did not appreciate that and you know that i know that those babies would say to themselves in their mind ye i can't hardly wait till i get bigger yeah because they knew if they had what they feel inside they would you know me you see what i'm saying and that's how it is about the joy of the lord don't come taking my joy if i want to dance let me dance if i want to shout let me shout if i want to run let me run if whatever i want to do in the name of the lord jesus christ let me do it don't bother me hallelujah i don't care if the whole church is stiff and starchy let me do it you know what i'm saying the reason why i'm saying this because you go to most message churches now they don't even dance no more what kind of stuff is that what kind of stuff evidently the book ain't open to them because when john saw the book open the bible said amen john shouted he leaped the whole heaven heard him i don't know how it happened but every dimension of heaven every dimension god had created heard john saying hey where are they you hear what i'm saying and then we come up in here with this mighty message of god and you can see god changing you how many of y'all know that i can see him changing me things that i couldn't overcome and things that i had in my life he's constantly moving out of my way hallelujah you hear what i'm saying it's not me it's christ in me the hope of glory it's not you it's christ in you some of y'all amen still trying to figure out whether you got the holy ghost what brought you here hallelujah y'all understand me what brought you here something brought you here maybe it's not the matured but you got something somewhere beginning has started hallelujah and the problem is we don't know how to feed it hallelujah you know how you feed it you worship the word hallelujah oh come on somebody you put a little spoon full of good stuff oh most baby loves applesauce or peaches some of y'all don't remember do ya but in my day we didn't have it coming in a jar we were the food processors y'all don't remember that i had to do it [Music] oh those kids would get mad if they knew we did them that way hallelujah but that was the way baby food didn't come in a job when i was little you had to process it at home then they got those little machine they start mashing it up but before they had those little machines you mash it up with your mouth [Music] oh it's nothing but the truth they came out healthier oh glory to god let me move on by god's grace so you real i'm trying to build something here because i'm just so tired of the people of god being defeated you gotta you gotta start holding on to this word with dear life you know all of these little things that we've allowed satan to dupe us in in years you gotta stop that's that's nonsense you know and you know how we say when when one of our teenagers started acting like the child boy grow up you don't have to act like that grow up and this is what god is telling us grow up paul said when i was a child i spake like a child i understood like a child hallelujah but when that which is purpose is come right you begin to think like a grown-up hallelujah i've grown up take charges oh yeah when something go wrong they see to it right that's why the kids run to their mama mama daddy daddy look look look and then you take charge well now god is saying you take charge that's not the will of god yes it is when jesus taught those disciples amen for years and when the storm came here he was laying in the boat and they were still acting like children master wake up like we do him sometime carrieth thou not that we perish you don't understand he might have been sleeping in the flesh but god never sleeps nor does he slumber in the spirit [Applause] hallelujah we've got such a oh word i let's like i told you the other night i said you know when i was saying lord let that will be done in earth and i'm doing this again so maybe he'll do it again honestly just for a moment time i thought i was raptured literally everything a power surge to me i was in a light that was just wonderful and it nobody saw it but me i don't even know how to explain it because it happened so quickly but i know it happened hallelujah i'll never be the same again i saw a holiness i can't even comprehend with my mind but i know that's where i'm going that's where he's taking me to that's where he's taking us to is that right hallelujah even the holy ghost that we've got is not like what we're going to experience in heaven hallelujah as it descends it comes through all kinds of perversion amen but when he gets to us it's just a small little part of him oh my but that small part now he's taking over he's a tree growing the tree of life growing in me growing in you hallelujah is that right you can you are a species that cannot die i you know when i get to heaven you know who i want to talk to enoch i want to talk to enoch and says what was it see because one thing for sure enoch didn't have a book he didn't have a scroll hallelujah but the bible said he walked with god what happened in his spirit he was connected with god he didn't let the world events and all of the things that going on in the world he never let that bother him he kept his mind on god and whatever god told him to do he did it so let me tell you this stuff that's going on in the world it's there to distract you it ain't our stuff oh come on it's not our stuff do you think noah was on the ark worried about the politics and the things that were going on once he was in the ark oh some of y'all i know y'all don't like what i'm saying but it's distracting you because i'm gonna tell you something if you watch that stuff evil spirits gonna jump on you and you who have never been racist you're going to become racist it's the truth you start hating people you don't even know people i'm telling you you got to stop that stuff that devil is trying to destroy your character keep your eyes focused on jesus because listen there ain't a thing you can do this is all purpose by god hallelujah for who you to get you prepared for a rapture hallelujah one morning god woke me up and told me to turn to genesis 6 he said we are now here in genesis 6 and when he did that the violence broke out in america like it's never been before and let me tell you something it's not all over this is just the beginning and you and i have no idea where it's going but i'm gonna tell you something you better be in christ hallelujah you better know god because if you don't know god you'll miss this rapture hallelujah is that the truth it's the truth i'm trying to tell listen god speaks to me and i'm telling you what he told me you got to keep and i do look at stuff but you know what when i see that thing in such a way i back off of it i back up off it because it's just it's just yeah confusion and everybody lying you say how you know it because my prophet said they're both rotten to the core [Music] and to be honest with you you can't be righteous and holy without the holy ghost let me go on by god's grace you know you love the lord listen he said god by his death and this is why i except see people we fail to see amen how we got here you know you couldn't get here without calvary you don't even hear calvary talked about much the blood of jesus christ and his dying and suffering well how people gonna get to the holy ghost or how they're gonna even be saved if they don't know what it took to bring their salvation people don't talk about the blood that was shared you hardly even hear the songs about it anymore [Music] hallelujah but you better understand that's where your salvation is because the bible said without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin hallelujah how are you gonna get rid of and get away from the blood when the book was opened the lamb came and what it when when john looked to see the voice of a lion he looked and he saw a lamb bloodied bloody lamb hallelujah as it had been slain from the foundation of the world hallelujah it's still the blood you can say it any kind of way you want to well it's the life of the blood yes it's always been the life of the blood none of us have had any kind of vows or anything with the blood of jesus it's always been the life hallelujah oh god help us here let me read this here quickly just to slow down a little bit i i'm really excited because i want you to understand who you are you're not a pushover you are a christian forget about what you used to be god has transformed you don't let the devil take your mind back to where you used to be because that's not you and if you got the holy ghost the bible said you are a new creature a new creation all things are passed away and behold all things have become new i believe that i don't care how to never come with me and try to bring me take me down memory lane you know what i'm saying he'll do it but listen i put a stop to him sometimes he'll catch you off guard and then you have to somebody said what do you do i said you shake your head because that's where he's at he's on top of your head shake him off confuse him a little bit and then when you shake your head you get focused anybody know what i'm talking about yes thoughts come in and you feel something and all of a sudden a vision break he gives you something i don't know what that is he gives you but you begin to see things you got to shake your head and say devil that's you that ain't me you know how i know it's me when it's coming from my heart you understand me when evil comes from your heart it's you when it's coming from your head that's just a battle between good and evil hallelujah the bible didn't say as a man thinketh in his head he says has a man thinketh in his heart anyway let me anyway let me let me stop before you got to understand amen that here is his death he shares his blood what he bought back his own now how many of you believe you his own i'm gonna ask that a question again because i didn't see enough hands how many people believe that you are the you are his own oh all right all right cause the devil needs to see those hands he needs to see that you know that you who you are you know so anyway you look and he said he brought back listen the spoken word seed and this is where i'm going because i want you to understand when the prophet of god was here he was an example of where god was taking us hallelujah and some of the phenomenal things that god did through him i still stand in awe but one of the things was when god told him to speak squirrels into existence now see what we must understand that the bride amen when she becomes god our god part of god however you want to say it i want to i want to say it in a way that people don't think i'm blaspheming but if a horse have a horse he's a horse the car have a car as a cow and if god have a son he's a god you understand me he's offspring he's what you are is who you are now you got to believe that you've got to believe that not with your head with your heart you see so anyway when god comes along and he takes a kentuckian like he did and began to work things within him amen and and make him something that he didn't even know he was until down the road you understand me and he god you know now that's when it gets good when god finds favor with you he didn't ask for the squirrels god came and brought the conversation up you know what i'm saying i can see how you know enoch pleased him so much and you know he's walking alone whether occasionally being god walking with enoch and then god brings up the rapture you know however it was i don't know but one thing for certain see when you walk right with god god start talking to you he fellowship because this the whole means for the blood to restore fellowship you see and so when he's fellowshipping with you he'll begin to talk with you he'll begin to say things to you nobody else can hear hallelujah and then brother said he wanted so many squirrels but the beautiful thing about it he didn't have nothing to work with greater things will you do and what happened he you know jesus had water to work with to turn to wine he had bread to multiply hallelujah you know what i'm saying he did a he did some things now i mean he he created fish right because peter said hey we've been here all night ain't no fish out there you say go back cast your net and somehow fish came where do you think they came from that same god that produced that ram in the bush over there with abraham is the same god that lives in us hallelujah i'm loving it and so you and i must understand this is the kind of a people he's looking for this is what the message came for for a people that can believe that these things are for you let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with god hallelujah you didn't do it he's doing it in you christ jesus the hope of glory in that day at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father's in me and i am in you it's not you that do the work it's christ in you doing the work it wasn't william branham it was god in him doing the work but that's the kind of people he's looking for i was thinking about my sister and she was telling me and i'm gonna let you go in just a minute but you know uh she was telling us uh the greedy was telling us about um some supernatural things that happened to her you know one where where the door uh gate opened up for him and stuff like that and i believe that i believe that i've seen god do things and you know how many times you've lost keys or something and i said lord you know where they are you can show me and sometimes he'll let them drop so you'll know he did it yeah you hear that right he do yes he does things like that and you know we're walking like it just happened no no no that was supernatural god heard your prayer so we understand my sheep heareth my voice the word and the they follow me you see you must know you know something like this you know god's sheep always here how do you hear this message how do you hear it you hear it your ears or is it that your soul something is hearing it yes you say david come here david come here boy didn't you hear me tell you to come here and you know how kids do when they stubborn they turn just the opposite way i know you hear me and if you don't come over here i'm going over there right that nice sweet voice come here now becomes a threat you understand me so but they hear you but they're not hearing you see because when you hear it you act upon it hearing an act you act upon what you hear hallelujah and i know you say well what are you saying i'm saying we are supernatural we we must stop being men and women thinking like men thinking like women we're supernatural in the image and likeness of god even the devil knows it he knew jesus was supernatural he did say hey if you be the christ turn the stone into bread he knew he could do it because of the god that was in him and god knows the devil know when you get god in you you're capable of doing whatever god wants you to do and it makes you feel like you're helpless you can't do anything hallelujah no no no no no what if the problem is when you disconnected you must make sure you become connected hallelujah you say well i don't feel like praying it ain't about your feelings hallelujah i've heard that song when you call on jesus he will answer prayer that's the truth and that's what we fail to see we fail to see we think we think that it's all natural no no we're supernatural now we're supernatural we believe the impossible huh we're abraham's seed hallelujah my sheep here is my voice right listen the prophet god said you're not a pig neither will you be a dog turned into a sheep he said that is impossible for ev every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in species so you got to understand if you are of god kind he can't make you less you can't be hybrid y'all understand me ain't nothing mixing the word cannot be broken is that why is that right the bible said who the word came to he said he called them gods and the word cannot be broken hallelujah and the word has come to you oh what i'm trying to say is that you once you realize what god has made you you become invincible you say well what do you mean brother brooks you don't even need a tambourine to get you all worked up what you need is faith to speak the word hallelujah you don't have to feel a whirlwind you don't even have to feel amen goosebump going up and down your spine you speak the word and is is that all right remember the problem of god there was a little babe mexican baby down there swollen with the cancer all over it and everything else and and and and you know he was just waiting on god waiting and the little fellow to suffer suffering suffering and and all of a sudden you know he basically said something god can't remember exactly what he said and god says no but i'm waiting on you i'm waiting on you what about the opossums she'd been there all day waiting on you to pray for i'm waiting on you if he wasn't he wouldn't rebuke those disciples he said oh gee of little faith where did you doubt laying there waiting on them [Music] when he had already given them the commission to do it he's given you the commission to do it y'all heard what i said last night and i'm going to close in just a little bit and then we must understand at the end of the day when people see you they must see jesus they were first called christians at antioch not because of the clothes they wear it was because of their behavior they act like god they talk like god they raise dead they heal the sick amend eyes of the blind was opened all of those things were given to the early christian and if we come from the same branch and if we are the same branch we must produce the same thing how are we going to do it lord how are we going to do it it seems like it's impossible no you lay in the presence of the sun these come by these things don't come by you know you just going doing whatever you want to do this come from prayers and you're laying before the presence of the lord and god coming in and anointing you hallelujah how many times you've said just not even thinking about a little simple prayer for somebody and they heal just like that right it happens why because you never thought about it it's like tying your shoes you just tie your shoe right sometimes we got to feel like oh faith got to come in such a way that i got to see this big cloud no it's in you who is faith who is faith jesus by faith the world was created faith is not just a thing it's a person [Music] and what we need to do is tap into it we're still looking all up in heaven he you know he's still there you know what i'm trying to say you can't just put him in a box but if you don't recognize him in you he said at that day you'll know that i'm in the father of the fathers in me and i am in you now if you can just chew on this like i said last night like a cow chewing his car you're going to get somewhere huh and what i'm saying is i know and i'm i hope i'm not sounding like i'm fussing because i'm not trying to fuss i'm screaming i'm yelling because i want to get penetrate something in penetrating that so you can see to the soul that god did not just make us sinners to send us to hell and god don't send nobody to hell we fight our way by way of our own choices god is real and nobody in hell will blame be able to blame god because god has it all on on film he has it all just like hollywood got you out there god got it all on film everything is captured from your very thoughts every action you made i told my daddy i said daddy i said you do not want to go before god like a sinner well i knew some of the things that my daddy had done and they were wicked things and i don't know about all the things he had done but i knew if i was him i would not want to go before god like that and one thing for certain you and i you know how we lied to our mom and our dad at times said oh no mom i didn't do it no no you can't even say that before god because not only will you see it but everybody else that's looking going to see it so you don't want that my point is you want god to wash away your sins you want all those things that you've done and you've thought that were wicked and evil you want god to clean you from all of that and on top of that you want god to fill you with the holy ghost i don't know listen i i i i tell people i've told god i said god you know what if i can't go to heaven holy i don't want to go if i go any kind of way i'm going to mess up heaven you understand me i got to be holy i got to be righteous i got to be just like because heaven won't be heaven to me without it you know what if you're a true sinner and you go to heaven you won't like it ain't nothing there for you to like hallelujah that's why we can't go to hell ain't nothing down there we like and you and i must understand we are a different breed we are but different people we are one blood by christ jesus hallelujah i don't know how he does it but i know one thing for certain amen god has done a great thing in this hour and i'm taking it brother get you know every piece of that bread every piece of that word it has he reveals it and gives it to me i'm going to eat it i'm going to digest it and i am willing to to become it i want to become what he wants me to become hallelujah you ought to get tired of going to burger king and mcdonald's that's all this world have to offer eat drink and be married that's nothing compared to what god has for you hallelujah we will spend eternity enjoying what he's got for us there will never be a boring moment there there will never be a sad note played there is no blues sung in heaven hallelujah oh my god if you can see what i see you understand this thing you do not want to miss it hallelujah you do not want to miss heaven hallelujah people say it ain't that but i know that i know that i know it's there hallelujah you say how do you know cause i got a piece of it in me hallelujah is that right and then we've had a prophet that went behind the curtain of time hallelujah he said i saw you there millions is all branham's new these are my converse hallelujah you said that couldn't have been you yeah yes it was then john saw a number that couldn't be numbered that was me too i was in there what was he doing people talking about time travel god been time traveling ever since the world began hallelujah nothing with god is by chance or by some kind of mistake god knew you was going to be here this day god knew you were going to be here and he designed a message just for you because he realized that you would be able to see it and you would be able to say hallelujah that's for me oh hallelujah amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm found was blind but now i see oh some of y'all don't forgot that song hallelujah but i'm gonna tell you something at the end of the day i know it has not been me i know it's the grace of god hallelujah i can't understand it yeah yeah how he could change a sinner like me how he could change uh change oh god oh oh he could change think about it we haven't thought about it in a while look where he's brought you from oh god look where he's brought you from you may not be what you want to be but you know you're not what you used to be hallelujah thank god thank god oh lord i don't even know where i'm living today he's protected me so many times hallelujah oh lord have mercy jesus oh lord have mercy look what god has done for us and he can't take it back that's the part i like he can't take it back once i had my children my wife and i we have eight we've got about 17 grand but let me say it like this once we had our children we couldn't take them we couldn't send them back yeah when they get teens you wish you could but they're yours and you know we always say where did they get that from your truth come on now come on come on i see my children i see me i see my sisters i see my brothers it's a family affair and you wonder how come they act like that i got one daughter she looks so much like my my younger sister she passed away but she looked so much the only is the difference is she's got a different complexion my my my younger sister was really a light yellow like skin and this one is i call it chocolate you know and she looked so much like me when she was born it scared me i'm like this is a girl but that's the way dna works you know it comes out that way and i think she look more like a mom now but you know she came out with that little afro [Laughter] yeah but you see don't you understand what i'm saying once the connection has been made and that child is conceived there's no turning back that's how it is with god once he's impregnated you with his spirit there's no turning back god doesn't have miscarriages or anything like that you understand me he that begun the good work in you is complete he's going to finish it you don't have to worry this is what gets me because you know what we're still working with the law and the law is going to condemn you every time every time you oh i didn't do this and god said i'm going to set you free you're not even in the cage anymore i've set you free hallelujah i've justified you i've sanctified you i've given the holy ghost what more can he do and you and i must understand this is a time of joy and that's what the devil can't stand it when he he's got your bills all messed up and you can still jump for joy he got relatives mistreating you and you still can jump for joy huh oh everything's going wrong but can't nobody do me like jesus [Music] huh can't nobody do me like jesus that is a real song and you and i must understand can't nobody do me like jesus oh lord i'm almost done but i want to say to you tonight i did all this writing but i'm gonna tell you tonight god loves you i don't know who's all in the house but he that god when god calls you you need to respond don't worry about how you're going to change he will change you he just needs your will he said oh god i want the holy ghost he'll give you that because let me tell you something if you want the holy ghost he gave you that desire and if he gave you that desire he's there to give it to you deep call to the deep that's the law of god that if you thirst he said if you hunger and thirst after righteousness you shall be the filled to emmaus three men walked that way as they reached their destination the two men begged the third mistake and as they talked together breaking bread and pouring wine i finally now realize the simplicity of his eye how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can't see i pray the lord please take my life i give it all to thee [Music] granted every day you commune with me oh grant that every day that's what i want you come you with me [Music] hallelujah you can have all the friends in the world but there'll never be a friend like jesus [Music] he understands you he knows you nothing you have ever done he doesn't know all about it but god is a healing god hallelujah not i know it's true probably all of us would be plum crazy if jesus hadn't come into our lives [Music] you know you've been dead somewhere or

lord we are asking that you would meet with us even through the night that you would speak to hearts and lives bring us to that greater level of surrender that the prophet talked about you've gone as far with god as you're ever going to go until you come to that place may it be lord that we step into a greater level a greater dimension of surrender so that you can take all of us and use us for your glory rest bodies i pray that the holy ghost will rise up in these precious believers to silence the voice of the accuser to shut down the attack and the assignment of the enemy and give peace where trouble and turmoil and torment has been let peace come and take that place fill that void lord when we're able to gather those of us who can tomorrow evening we're asking lord for everything
