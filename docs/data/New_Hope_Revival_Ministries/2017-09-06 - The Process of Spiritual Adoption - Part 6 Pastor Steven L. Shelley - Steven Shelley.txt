TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] you [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry welcome to the program today we're doing a study here together on the process of spiritual adoption we just want to emphasize that through the scripture that spiritual adoption is not something that takes place with one event but that it is a growing learning process it is as we read I think in the last time we were together how that a son is under tutors and governors trained and taught instructed and even tested to prove whether or not he has come to that place of maturity where he can really be trusted to conduct the business of the father and I personally believe that some exciting times are beginning right now as the body of Christ begins to hear these truths and they begin to position themselves to be elevated exalted into that place of full spiritual adoption which as we have discussed before it is a place of maturity and we have to come into a measure of maturity before we can walk in this place and I just appreciate you being here today I want to teach you some more through the scripture and I want to invite you to contact our ministry all the contact information is available for you there on the screen and it would be a delight to read your email and to respond we will join with you in prayer over any prayer requests that you have and if

rest of the contact information and we just be happy to hear from you to know that you are watching and hopefully that this program is is helping you in your spiritual journey let's look to the Word of God gather okay we're going to get right into part 6 of the process of spiritual adoption we read the last time we were together in Galatians chapter 4 and I am strongly tempted to go back and read it again and talk about it a little bit more but i think i might ought to move on let's let's do go back to Galatians 4 however but let's go down to verse 19 we stopped reading the last time we were together way up in the chapter and we didn't get all the way down to this so let's go all the way down to to Galatians 4 19 it says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ mushiya Messiah be formed in you what does that mean the Apostle is writing to the church in Galatia and if you study you'll find out that the church in Galatia was having some difficulty because many of the members of this church the Jewish believers who had received the Messiah were having a hard time balancing the Grace and the law they were really struggling with this and in fact in the in the next few verses after verse 19 the Apostle begins to talk to them about the two sons of Abraham one that was born of the free woman and one that was born of the bondwoman it's a very very interesting portion of Scripture and I invite you to read it later at your leisure and I believe you would be blessed by the instruction that Paul was giving to the church in Galatia but now he's saying i am in birth pains I'm travailing in birth in prayer in intercession for you until Christ be formed in you in the womb of your spirit let Christ before and of course anything that is formed in the womb of the Spirit is formed there for your personal benefit as a believer but it's also formed there so that you might have grace to give birth to it to bring it forth what would that mean to have Christ formed in our spiritual womb and then have the opportunity to bring Christ forth from our lives that's what ministry is all about and we are all ministers we're all called to ministry in one form or another are we all preachers no but we're all ministers God has it's a part of knowing the Lord when you when you know something as good as Jesus you've got to tell it you've got to want to help other people you can't keep it to yourself and so this is a it's sort of a measure because if we don't have enough of the Lord in us then we can kind of lock it up but I'm telling you when you come to a place that Christ is fully formed in the womb of your spirit you've got to let it out and you've got to let the good graces of God shine and you want to pray for people and you know when you're this kind of on the line just barely walking with the Lord somebody says pray for me and you say well I'll be praying for you but when you in Christ is fully formed in you and somebody says pray for me you're just ready rightly and I'll pray for you right now because you just want so desperately to bring forth that which God is planted in the womb of your spirit especially if that is Jesus Christ and it and it is and that's what adoption is it's also the reason why I chose to read that scripture is because Christ being formed in us is another aspect of what spiritual adoption and spiritual maturity is all about it is having the fullness of Christ formed in us now I think most anybody out there would like to have the power that Christ had to calm the storms too to multiply the loaves and fishes to heal the leper to raise the dead most people would desire to have the power but the Bride of Christ we are not just pursuing the power we're also pursuing the character of God the attributes of god mercy and loving-kindness and forgiveness and love and compassion and all that Christ was all that Christ was we often heard William Branham say in the past generation great man of God and we have access to eleven hundred and eighty two sermons that he preached during the time of his ministry he passed away in 1965 and we often listen to those tapes and find spiritual food in due season and I remember hearing brother branham's say many times that all that the father was he poured into Jesus the Son and all that Jesus was which is also all the father was he poured into the church body and and that is for me that is an amazing revelation to know that all that Christ is if he is fully formed in me is available to me I have access to all that Christ is let's not say was all that Christ is and that's what the world is in need of the world needs what Christ is his truth he is truth he is the spirit of truth there's something about the truth of the Messiah that sets captives free that breaks bondages and yolks in people's lives that there's something about the truth of of Jesus the Messiah that that causes demons to flee and disease trembles and shrieks away and so many powerful demonstrations are possible when Jesus is allowed to have his way and he wants to work through us he will work around us if he has to but it is his desire to work through us and I believe it's the desire of every spirit-filled believer to have the Lord Jesus Christ fully formed in us now I want to read a few scriptures I won't get probably too far in teaching on these scriptures but I want to go ahead and get them to you and then the next time we meet together we'll talk about them the reason why I'm reading them is I want to show you what I believe is part of the adoption process even in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ now some people really have a problem with that Jesus was the son of God he was Mashiach the Messiah how is it that he would have a need to be adopted well let's look at the scripture let's look at Hebrews chapter 5 verses 8 through 10 and maybe you'll see what I'm talking about Hebrews chapter 5 verses 8 through 10 though he were a son this is established he was a son of God yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered now let's compare that real quickly with Galatians for one now I say that the air as long as he as a child differ if nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all verse 2 but it's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father now we hear a real comparison not a comparison but a week we hear the same concept being spoken about in both of these scriptures not a contrast but these scriptures are companion scriptures because we see that what's happening in the natural with a natural born son was also happening with the Messiah the Son of the Living God though we were a son in the natural though he is a son though someone is the son he still needs governor and tutors to help him get to the place where he is then adopted or are celebrated by the father at the time appointed and over here we see Jesus being the son of God but learning obedience being trained in obedience and how did he get that training by the things which he suffered though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek so there was even a process of full spiritual adoption in the life of the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ now when did that start well really the process that we'll talk about in a few weeks in the Jewish faith it starts with circumcision it begins eight days old the this the first ceremony of the beginning of the process is circumcision and then some years later as as a teenager we have the the Bar Mitzvah this celebration that this child has has come to a certain place of maturity and he is now celebrated as a son of the commandments a student of the law but already having some maturity because anyone who knows about the process preceding Bar Mitzvah knows that they're studying of the laws and the commandments of God that are very very important part of the process to get to that place but then there is another celebration of maturity that takes place at about the age of 30 and some of this was borrowed from from Greek and Roman culture but it was happening in the time of Yeshua in in Second Temple Jerusalem we see that happening now excuse me Matthew chapter 3 which where we want to read now and I want to show you that the the beginning of part of this process happen when our Lord was being baptized by John the Baptist and I want to read all of the places Matthew Mark and Luke where it talks about this baptism but will only do a few verses so I hope maybe you're familiar with this Matthew chapter 3 verses 16 and 17 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water now this is a clear indication that he wasn't sprinkled because he came up out of the water which would have been more like the tradition of the day which was the Jewish mikvah the immersion this very holy sacred time of cleansing and a symbol of cleansing and so Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened upon him or unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove now there was not a dove that came and appeared over the head of the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture said it was the Spirit of God descending like a dove in the manner of a dove and lighting upon him the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased now this is a it's a beautiful type it's a beautiful type of the Father God announcing that this is my son I want you to know this is my son one of the other translations of the New Testament says this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in King James it says in whom I am well pleased but another translation says in whom I am pleased to dwell I think that's even a more accurate translation actually look at mark chapter 1 verses 10 and 11 and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased or again in whom I am pleased to dwell and then the third place that we read about the baptism of Yeshua was in Luke chapter 3 verses 21 and 22 now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was open and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him so now we've got more of a description it was a physical form like enough and descended upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved Son in the I am well pleased so three different tellings of the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ by John the Baptist but although a slight variation in the word wording but much consistency in what happened now I want you to go forward a period of time this was the beginning this was we you know we read about him in the temple and we're going to read that in another program we read about him in the temple as a young lad and and then there was not a lot written about his life until this point where he sort of came out of the like John the Baptist was called out of the wilderness to introduce the coming of the Messiah the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world and in like manner the Lord Jesus grew up and he matured in the home of his earthly father Joseph and he was taught many things as probably as The Apprentice of a carpenter and and there were some other things that were going on in his life that we don't really read about it it's not until his baptism that we really see the the beginning of his ministry the beginning of his earthly ministry now there are movies that were made that showed Jesus working miracles when he was a child and turning little clay pigeons into real pigeons and so forth and if you want to believe that then that's perfectly all right with me but I don't believe that that that that's how the early life of Jesus Christ was I do believe there were some supernatural things going on in his life I believe he had supernatural knowledge and wisdom of his father's business we see that in the scripture but I believe that it was not until this baptism this public celebration of who he was that he really started functioning in his destiny as the Messiah although all along he was the Living God made flesh but now he was coming to his his hour to his season let's look at Matthew chapter 17 verses 1 through 9 now we're going to read two or three tellings of the Mount of Transfiguration we just did three on the baptism we're going to do three on the Mount of Transfiguration I just want them in your spirit I want you to it's a good idea to make notes and to write down where these things are found Matthew chapter 17 verses 1 through 9 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was white as the light and meh old there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make here three Tabernacles one for the one for Moses and one for Elijah and while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased now we've got the same salutation from the voice of the Spirit of the Father that that came upon him during his baptism but three words are added to that salutation this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him now those three words just three little tiny words are extremely significant because whatever happened between the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua and this Mount of Transfiguration that we start reading about in Matthew 17 whatever happened during that span of time he was now in a place like many sons in Israel during that time at about the age of 30 years olds give or take a little bit it was according to the to the child to the man the young man growing up and according to the will of his earthly father this ceremony would take place where the young man would be celebrated publicly at the gate of the city i'm going to show you that in a net and in one of the future broadcast and and basically these very words would be spoken over him this is my beloved son the father would take his hands and put it on the head of his son publicly in front of witnesses at the gate of the city and basically he would say this is my beloved son i'm pleased with him here he him meaning he is now authorized to conduct business my behalf and this appears to be what was happening to our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 17 now I have to hurry to get in these other readings so that we can spend the next program teaching from them mark chapter 9 verses two through eight and after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter James and John leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves he was transfigured before them and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as know fuller on earth can wipe them and there appeared unto them Elijah and Moses and they were talking with Jesus and Peter answered and said to Jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for the one for Moses and one for Elijah almost identical to what Matthew recorded for he whisked not what to say for they were sore afraid now there's a little bit of a different explanation there because now we know why Peter made this statement because he was afraid he didn't know what to say here he is standing on the Mount of what we call now the Mount of Transfiguration some people believe that was mount a bore and others are like me who believe it was mount her moan but whether it was table or her moan it happened and it was on a mountain and and Jesus was there and Peter James and John were there and supernaturally Moses and Elijah showed up now that we've got and and Peter makes this statement and I hear people criticizing Peter misunderstanding Peter all the time and who knows what I would have said if I would have been there but mark explains some of Peters babbling a little bit and he said for he Wis not what to say he didn't know what to say what do you say in a moment like that and and it says because they were sore afraid alright and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of that cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him now mark does not record the phrase in whom I am well pleased Matthew does mark leaves that out Matthew says this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased here you him mark says this is my beloved son hear him in either case though the the additional word here you him or hear him was added to what was spoken over him at his baptism I think I've got time maybe to get in the third reference it would be very good to start off the next program being able to teach from these scriptures without reading them into the record so we'll do that real quick Luke 9 verses 28 through 36 and it came to pass about eight days after these things he took Peter James and John and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering and behold there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elijah who appeared in glory and speak of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem Luke tells us part of the conversation they were speaking to him about what was to take place in Jerusalem concerning Yeshua now that's why I thought it was so important to read all three tellings because basically the facts remain consistent but we get a little bit more information here we know a little bit about what they were talking about the other riders just say they were talking but here we find out that that one of the topics of discussion was that his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they fell asleep at some point here they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for me and one for Moses and one for Elijah not knowing when he said so again that's kind of similar to what Mark had said while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared they entered into the cloud now that is an interesting addition to the story the cloud came down overshadowed them not just him overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud all of them entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him and when the voice was passed Jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen now when we meet again we're going to talk about this process of adoption in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ father thank you for letting us be together today bring your word to living reality in our lives in this day in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Yeshua we pray amen I have to hurry thank you so much for watching the Eagles cry tune in again next time will you bye bye for now [Music] you
