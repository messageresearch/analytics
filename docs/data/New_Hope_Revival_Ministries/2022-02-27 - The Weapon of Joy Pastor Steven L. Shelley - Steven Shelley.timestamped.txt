[1:24:02] dios la bendiga is that close
[1:24:06] he's not even smiling so i don't think
[1:24:08] it's even close
[1:24:09] i thought it was close so
[1:24:12] we're very happy to have you here
[1:24:14] we're glad to see sister megan with us
[1:24:16] she had
[1:24:18] some major foot surgery this week and uh
[1:24:21] made her way to the house of god anyway
[1:24:23] may god bless her
[1:24:25] we're very happy to look up and see the
[1:24:27] minko family with us
[1:24:29] it's been a few weeks since they were
[1:24:30] able to be here i don't know for sure
[1:24:32] but i thought i saw mama with something
[1:24:34] in her arms
[1:24:36] so this is our our sweet little
[1:24:39] zion's first uh
[1:24:41] service with us and we're very happy
[1:24:43] about that and
[1:24:45] i saw
[1:24:46] sister karen while ago uh rj's mom here
[1:24:49] it was nice to see her in service with
[1:24:51] us
[1:24:53] i appreciate the presence of the lord
[1:24:56] he's here
[1:24:58] he spoke to us
[1:25:00] as we worshiped him
[1:25:03] i know that what you just heard as an
[1:25:06] exhortation from the spirit
[1:25:08] i know that's the heart of god
[1:25:11] because i could see
[1:25:12] it earlier in the service that that was
[1:25:14] his heart
[1:25:16] and he wants to speak to us in that
[1:25:18] manner
[1:25:19] we make a choice today it's our choice
[1:25:23] no one can make that choice for us not
[1:25:26] even those who love us so much
[1:25:28] no one can make that choice but us
[1:25:31] when we get tired of where we are when
[1:25:34] we get tired of living where we are and
[1:25:36] feeling what we feel and thinking what
[1:25:38] we think being what we are then we come
[1:25:42] to him we make a choice and we say lord
[1:25:44] here i am i'm your humble servant i
[1:25:47] throw myself on your mercy i cannot
[1:25:49] bring myself out of this
[1:25:52] but i know you can
[1:25:55] and i pray that you will find grace to
[1:25:57] throw yourself on his mercy today
[1:26:00] because i
[1:26:01] i believe with all my heart when i woke
[1:26:03] up this morning the lord was talking to
[1:26:05] me
[1:26:06] and i believe with all my heart
[1:26:08] that god is giving us opportunities to
[1:26:11] bring
[1:26:12] our own deliverance to pass
[1:26:14] by speaking the words of truth the truth
[1:26:16] that's been preached to us what we have
[1:26:19] heard
[1:26:20] the message that god has sent to us is
[1:26:22] making available to us deliverance
[1:26:26] i don't know if we have some
[1:26:27] preconceived idea of what deliverance
[1:26:30] looks like or how it's supposed to come
[1:26:32] but i want you to know it's absolutely
[1:26:35] biblical and according to this message
[1:26:37] that you raise up in the name of the
[1:26:39] lord and decree and declare and prophesy
[1:26:44] your own way out
[1:26:47] i heard the lord say this morning when i
[1:26:49] woke up but many have chosen
[1:26:51] to walk in bondage
[1:26:54] and you know that is not a choice that
[1:26:56] any of us should make
[1:26:59] i don't care what the circumstances are
[1:27:01] we should always want to choose to be
[1:27:03] free
[1:27:05] no matter what the price no matter what
[1:27:07] the cost
[1:27:08] and i felt like the lord was saying that
[1:27:10] because some have chosen
[1:27:12] to stay to remain in a place of bondage
[1:27:16] without the freedom that the lord has
[1:27:18] provided that your day of
[1:27:21] of getting it the easy way
[1:27:24] is coming to a close
[1:27:26] it doesn't mean that god won't bring
[1:27:28] deliverance in your life i believe he
[1:27:30] will but if you won't come the easy way
[1:27:33] the way i just described
[1:27:35] by raising up in faith and saying i know
[1:27:39] i'm not unaware of where i am
[1:27:42] i'm not unaware of the position that i'm
[1:27:44] in and i decree and declare in the name
[1:27:47] of jesus i'm coming out
[1:27:50] i'm not going to lay here any longer
[1:27:53] when i know he has paid the price
[1:27:56] i felt like i heard the lord say because
[1:27:59] some have chosen to remain in that
[1:28:01] bondage that easy way out is coming to
[1:28:04] an end for them and they will come out
[1:28:06] but they'll come out the hard way
[1:28:09] i
[1:28:10] i refuse
[1:28:11] to come out the hard way
[1:28:14] i just refuse that now when i i know the
[1:28:17] i know there was a word and it has it's
[1:28:18] totally a different word it means
[1:28:20] something totally different because thou
[1:28:22] have chosen the hard way that's the way
[1:28:24] of persecution that's the way of
[1:28:25] hardship that's not what i'm talking
[1:28:27] about
[1:28:29] i'm talking about an easy way and that
[1:28:31] you taking god at his word and just
[1:28:33] making up your noggin
[1:28:35] no more
[1:28:38] no more
[1:28:40] i can walk out of this valley
[1:28:43] i can come out of this place and i can
[1:28:44] be free and lead others or actually lead
[1:28:47] others or
[1:28:48] if you have the rock
[1:28:51] you you have the rock either way
[1:28:53] you fall on him and declare yourself
[1:28:56] i'm your humble servant and you get
[1:28:58] broken in his sight
[1:29:00] or the rock falls on you
[1:29:03] but one way or the other there's not
[1:29:05] going to be one
[1:29:06] that he had in his mind before the
[1:29:08] foundation of the world lost
[1:29:11] every one of them are coming one way or
[1:29:14] the other all the way through his bride
[1:29:17] will shine in the glory
[1:29:19] of his countenance do you believe that
[1:29:22] all right but let all
[1:29:24] those that put their trust in thee
[1:29:28] rejoice
[1:29:30] let them ever
[1:29:31] shout for joy
[1:29:34] because thou
[1:29:35] defendest
[1:29:37] them
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:39] let them also that love thy name
[1:29:44] be joyful
[1:29:47] in thee
[1:29:49] we were privileged to have the name of
[1:29:52] jesus look this way
[1:29:55] we were privileged to have the name of
[1:29:57] jesus spoken over us
[1:30:00] sung over us
[1:30:01] declared over us
[1:30:04] and we receive that like a blessing from
[1:30:06] the lord amen amen
[1:30:09] we say amen amen
[1:30:12] let them that love thy name be joyful
[1:30:17] in thee
[1:30:19] now look at the amplified
[1:30:22] it says but let all those who take
[1:30:25] refuge and put their trust
[1:30:28] in you
[1:30:30] rejoice
[1:30:31] let them ever sing and shout for joy
[1:30:36] because you make a covering over them
[1:30:40] hallelujah
[1:30:41] and do what
[1:30:43] defend them
[1:30:46] you are not defenseless against the
[1:30:48] enemy today
[1:30:49] you are being covered over and defended
[1:30:53] by the living god
[1:30:54] whoo
[1:30:56] let those also who love your name be
[1:30:58] joyful in you
[1:31:01] and would you read the last part
[1:31:09] i can't just do that yes
[1:31:13] yes
[1:31:15] yes
[1:31:17] you can
[1:31:19] for every voice it says no i can't i
[1:31:22] can't i can't there's a higher voice
[1:31:24] saying yes
[1:31:27] yes you can because it's my invitation
[1:31:30] to you
[1:31:32] joshua chapter 6
[1:31:35] i recognize that you're standing
[1:31:38] joshua chapter 6 and verse 20.
[1:31:41] you know this
[1:31:43] believe brother greeley
[1:31:45] spoke about it not too long ago
[1:31:48] i believe brother dwayne when he was
[1:31:49] here one time spoke about it
[1:31:53] so the people
[1:31:55] shouted
[1:31:57] does anybody remember why they shouted
[1:32:04] because they were told to
[1:32:11] not because they felt it
[1:32:14] not because they felt like doing it
[1:32:18] not because everything was good
[1:32:20] nothing was bad and all the problems
[1:32:22] were solved they were standing on the
[1:32:24] outside
[1:32:26] of a walled in city that god said your
[1:32:29] inheritance is on the other side of that
[1:32:31] wall
[1:32:32] a wall so big that they could hold
[1:32:34] chariot races
[1:32:36] on top of those walls i mean i want you
[1:32:39] to know that's that's not some one one
[1:32:42] concrete block wall
[1:32:44] we're talking about a massive
[1:32:47] width of walls standing there chariot
[1:32:50] races on the top of that wall everything
[1:32:53] god said is yours on the other side of
[1:32:55] that wall and god gave a strategy that
[1:32:58] sounded like nonsense
[1:33:01] march around and keep quiet march around
[1:33:04] and keep quiet march around keep quiet
[1:33:06] march around keep quiet
[1:33:08] but then on the last day
[1:33:12] so the people shouted
[1:33:14] when the priest blew
[1:33:17] with the trumpets
[1:33:18] and it came to pass when the people
[1:33:21] heard
[1:33:22] the sound of the trumpet
[1:33:26] when the people heard the sound of the
[1:33:30] trumpet and the people shouted
[1:33:36] with a puny
[1:33:39] with a great
[1:33:41] shout out
[1:33:43] hallelujah
[1:33:46] and the wall
[1:33:47] did what
[1:33:49] fell
[1:33:50] down flat
[1:33:54] the ground opened up
[1:33:57] swallowed the wall
[1:33:59] you need not think the wall toppled over
[1:34:03] because as wide as the wall was
[1:34:06] if the wall just fell over like that you
[1:34:09] would have still had to do a whole lot
[1:34:11] of climbing
[1:34:13] you would have had to find a breach to
[1:34:15] climb over and get through to get on the
[1:34:17] other side that's not what happened
[1:34:20] even many archaeologists believe that
[1:34:23] those walls were absolutely sunk
[1:34:28] right down into the earth and became
[1:34:30] powder in the sand
[1:34:34] did you know that most people agree not
[1:34:37] one
[1:34:39] physical
[1:34:40] remain
[1:34:41] has been
[1:34:42] located
[1:34:44] that those walls ever existed
[1:34:47] they have the ruins of jericho
[1:34:50] i've been to the ruins of jericho i have
[1:34:53] eaten lunch
[1:34:54] in the modern city of jericho that
[1:34:57] surrounds the old city they have found
[1:35:00] ruins that the city existed
[1:35:03] but no walls
[1:35:05] because there was such a god-given
[1:35:07] strategy i know you're standing
[1:35:10] there was such a god-given strategy for
[1:35:13] the victory
[1:35:14] and because there was a people who
[1:35:17] obeyed
[1:35:19] the word of the lord
[1:35:21] we're not asking you to sell your house
[1:35:23] and give the money to the church
[1:35:26] we're not asking you to buy me a new
[1:35:28] suit
[1:35:30] i could use one but i'm not asking you
[1:35:32] to buy it
[1:35:33] we're not asking you to do anything
[1:35:35] other than taking your opportunity to
[1:35:39] give god the praise that he deserves
[1:35:43] that's all we're asking
[1:35:45] is that you would enter into a place
[1:35:48] where you would realize and recognize
[1:35:52] the power that joy can have in your life
[1:35:57] much more than a feeling isn't it
[1:36:00] and the people shouted with uh
[1:36:03] that the wall fell down flat
[1:36:06] so that the people went up into the city
[1:36:11] every man straight before him and i want
[1:36:15] you to read the last phrase
[1:36:18] and they took
[1:36:20] the city
[1:36:22] lord jesus we are so thankful already
[1:36:26] for this presence that has been with us
[1:36:29] my what an atmosphere
[1:36:32] so many things stirring
[1:36:35] the enemy he always would like to
[1:36:38] distract us
[1:36:40] cause us to look over here look over
[1:36:42] there see what somebody else is doing
[1:36:46] see how somebody else is praising see
[1:36:49] who's got a flag see who's got to dance
[1:36:53] see what that one wants to say
[1:36:56] but lord i'm so thankful today
[1:36:59] that you have an order in the spirit
[1:37:02] and you are bringing us forth
[1:37:05] right now to receive all that you have
[1:37:08] for us
[1:37:10] and we know we're entering into the most
[1:37:12] critical part of the service and we need
[1:37:14] your help right now
[1:37:16] like we have never needed it before
[1:37:18] because we've never faced a day like
[1:37:20] this day we've never been in a moment
[1:37:23] quite like this moment before that's how
[1:37:26] your economy works
[1:37:28] and so we ask that you would come right
[1:37:31] now
[1:37:32] by the power of the holy spirit
[1:37:34] and you administer to the need in each
[1:37:36] and every individual's life and we ask
[1:37:39] this in the lovely name of our lord and
[1:37:42] savior our messiah yeshua in the name of
[1:37:45] the lord jesus christ and the saints of
[1:37:47] god said
[1:37:49] you may be seated
[1:37:51] i want to speak this morning
[1:37:53] for the first few moments
[1:37:56] on the weapon of joy
[1:38:00] we've learned some things about joy
[1:38:04] we understand that joy is more than an
[1:38:07] emotion or a feeling
[1:38:10] it is actually a gift
[1:38:13] it's a fruit of the spirit but the joy
[1:38:17] of the lord is a gift
[1:38:20] it comes from god
[1:38:22] it's our inheritance
[1:38:25] we can have it
[1:38:27] we just have to claim it
[1:38:29] once we discover that it's ours for the
[1:38:31] asking
[1:38:32] doesn't mean it's going to be automatic
[1:38:35] sometimes you got to fight your cousins
[1:38:39] your uncles and aunts
[1:38:41] your siblings or whoever else may try to
[1:38:44] come and get your portion
[1:38:46] but once you discover that you've got a
[1:38:49] portion laid up for you
[1:38:51] you want not to lay down and let anybody
[1:38:53] else take what belongs to you
[1:38:55] that's the hour we're living in right
[1:38:57] now god's going to have a people that
[1:38:59] get a little militant after his promises
[1:39:02] you're not just laying around waiting i
[1:39:04] know there are certain things that
[1:39:06] brother branham said that people really
[1:39:08] like
[1:39:10] and they really like the lazy anointing
[1:39:14] and they really like this idea that all
[1:39:17] we have to do now is just lay around in
[1:39:19] the sun
[1:39:22] and ripen
[1:39:24] and i said you know that's a
[1:39:26] that's a dangerous thing
[1:39:29] because you can also lay around and rot
[1:39:33] you don't want to do that
[1:39:34] you want to recognize that there's an
[1:39:36] enemy
[1:39:38] who is out to steal to kill to destroy
[1:39:43] he does not want you to have joy
[1:39:45] he doesn't even want you to have peace
[1:39:48] he doesn't want you to feel the love of
[1:39:50] god in your life
[1:39:52] he doesn't want you to be able to
[1:39:54] function
[1:39:56] he wants to fill you with such anxiety
[1:39:59] and fear and depression and oppression
[1:40:02] and pain and all these other things the
[1:40:05] spirit of god said woundedness
[1:40:09] and here is the thing about woundedness
[1:40:11] everybody
[1:40:13] under the sound of my voice
[1:40:16] knows what it feels like to be wounded
[1:40:21] we've all had anything from a boo-boo
[1:40:27] to a major surgery
[1:40:30] in the natural
[1:40:32] and even in the spiritual
[1:40:34] we know what it means to be gob-smacked
[1:40:41] slapped around
[1:40:43] beat up drugged through the dirt
[1:40:46] we've experienced these things
[1:40:48] but we choose as the overcoming bride of
[1:40:52] jesus christ at his invitation
[1:40:56] to come and lay all of that before him
[1:40:59] and he pours the fatness of joy all over
[1:41:01] it
[1:41:02] did you know the bible said he would
[1:41:04] fill us with the oil of gladness the oil
[1:41:06] of joy that word oil there is the fat
[1:41:10] he wants to fill us with the fat of
[1:41:13] gladness with the fat of joy
[1:41:17] he wants to pour on us
[1:41:19] everything we need to give him the
[1:41:21] praise
[1:41:23] that he rightfully deserves
[1:41:26] and joy is not about a feeling
[1:41:29] joy is about a confidence
[1:41:32] are you with me
[1:41:34] it's about a trust
[1:41:36] it's about complete trust
[1:41:38] it's about total trust it's about
[1:41:41] completely and totally trusting the lord
[1:41:44] who has called you
[1:41:46] how many of you believe he who has
[1:41:47] started a good work
[1:41:52] he who has started a good work
[1:41:54] is more than able to finish that work in
[1:41:58] your life he is both the author
[1:42:02] and the who
[1:42:04] and the finisher of our faith
[1:42:07] he's not only given to every individual
[1:42:09] in this room a seed of faith
[1:42:13] a measure of faith but he has poured his
[1:42:16] oil on that faith
[1:42:18] and the more he does the more we use it
[1:42:21] the more he anoints it the more we
[1:42:22] exercise it and and we use it and we
[1:42:25] stretch it
[1:42:27] and it becomes stronger and stronger and
[1:42:29] stronger and stronger and stronger
[1:42:32] and it's not how much faith you have
[1:42:34] it's whether or not you you choose to
[1:42:37] leave your faith in place
[1:42:40] or whether you choose to withdraw it and
[1:42:42] pull it back you've got to keep putting
[1:42:44] your faith in
[1:42:46] somebody put their faith in
[1:42:48] somebody now i don't listen i don't i've
[1:42:51] never played poker
[1:42:53] i'm not holy because of it but i have
[1:42:56] never played a game of poker in my life
[1:43:00] me and sister flo
[1:43:04] but i grew up
[1:43:06] going to sleep
[1:43:09] to the sounds of a poker game
[1:43:12] so i know a little bit about the
[1:43:14] language
[1:43:16] and i know that
[1:43:19] you're gonna look at what you got
[1:43:22] and you're gonna decide what to do about
[1:43:25] it
[1:43:28] and sometimes
[1:43:29] people will just take all their pot
[1:43:32] every bit of it and put it right out
[1:43:34] there
[1:43:36] right out in the middle and they say i'm
[1:43:37] all in
[1:43:40] fold i guess they say
[1:43:42] lay their cards down
[1:43:44] they put all their money in
[1:43:47] if you happen to be a
[1:43:49] jeopardy fan it's a true daily double
[1:43:54] you put it all in
[1:43:56] you invest it all in
[1:43:59] this is how it works
[1:44:02] but you've got to know that you know
[1:44:04] that you know that you know
[1:44:07] or you're going to lose
[1:44:09] you better know that what you're holding
[1:44:12] well i don't like using these analogies
[1:44:15] but it just come like that to my mind
[1:44:18] you got to know that yours is going to
[1:44:20] trump
[1:44:23] it's going to beat everybody else's hand
[1:44:26] you're taking a risk
[1:44:29] if you don't have the top
[1:44:31] if you don't have the best of the best
[1:44:33] you're taking a risk if you put it all
[1:44:36] in
[1:44:36] but i want you to know sometimes i just
[1:44:38] get tired of playing games
[1:44:42] this thing needs to come to an end one
[1:44:43] way or the other it's time to go to bed
[1:44:47] so to speak
[1:44:49] it's time to put it all in and either
[1:44:50] win it all back or lose it all
[1:44:53] but then it's over and we go home
[1:44:55] right
[1:44:56] it's time church
[1:44:58] to put all of our faith in
[1:45:02] every bit of our confidence in him
[1:45:06] and let's put him to the test
[1:45:09] and see again and again and again if he
[1:45:13] will not come through he always
[1:45:18] always comes through why isn't he
[1:45:20] helping me because you won't put it all
[1:45:23] in
[1:45:25] if you will invest it all in
[1:45:28] and say i'm yours
[1:45:31] sink or swim
[1:45:34] stand or fall win or lose
[1:45:38] i'm throwing my whole life
[1:45:42] on you lord
[1:45:44] it's up to you whether your servant
[1:45:46] stands or falls
[1:45:47] it's up to you whether we survive
[1:45:50] or whether we fall dead
[1:45:52] it's in your hands
[1:45:54] but we refuse to be backed into this
[1:45:56] corner any longer
[1:45:59] we choose
[1:46:00] to take you at your word
[1:46:03] so this joy is
[1:46:05] more than an emotion in fact we find out
[1:46:07] that that this shout of joy that's
[1:46:10] mentioned
[1:46:11] numerous times in the bible and i won't
[1:46:13] have time to cover them this morning
[1:46:15] don't even want to
[1:46:17] i want to do a bit of a review
[1:46:20] of a few things we've learned about joy
[1:46:24] i want to reserve a little bit of time
[1:46:26] at the end for whatever the lord has
[1:46:29] but i
[1:46:30] want you to know that
[1:46:33] joy is not just an emotion it's actually
[1:46:35] a spiritual weapon
[1:46:38] because a person who is filled with the
[1:46:41] joy of the lord is the least likely to
[1:46:44] be distracted
[1:46:47] by the threats that the enemy
[1:46:49] continuously makes
[1:46:52] so you're holding on
[1:46:54] to the joy of the lord is a strategic
[1:46:57] decision
[1:46:59] that becomes a spiritual weapon
[1:47:03] in this last warfare
[1:47:05] amen
[1:47:07] now this last warfare is
[1:47:10] help me now help me now
[1:47:12] it's right there that's where it is
[1:47:14] that's where it's fought and that's
[1:47:17] where it's won
[1:47:18] right there in the mine
[1:47:23] i read you some
[1:47:25] different thoughts about joy and
[1:47:27] webster's
[1:47:28] dictionary definition of joy and
[1:47:32] we looked over it
[1:47:34] uh
[1:47:35] theopedia
[1:47:38] and uh saw what it is i'm gonna read it
[1:47:41] now theopedia describes joy as
[1:47:45] a state of mind
[1:47:47] as an orientation of the heart i love
[1:47:50] that
[1:47:52] it is a settled state
[1:47:54] of contentment confidence
[1:47:57] and hope
[1:47:59] how many of you know we need that hope
[1:48:01] and we've got every reason to be filled
[1:48:03] with hope today every reason don't you
[1:48:05] know how how gas prices are yes
[1:48:09] but that's not moving my hope
[1:48:11] that's not changing where my hope lies
[1:48:14] it's planted firmly in the lord jesus
[1:48:16] christ
[1:48:17] we'll make it somehow
[1:48:19] we'll get about somehow
[1:48:22] joy is defined as a strong feeling of
[1:48:24] happiness a manifestation of happiness
[1:48:27] through an outward rejoicing or
[1:48:28] excitement
[1:48:30] a couple pastors well-known evangelical
[1:48:33] pastors were were asked to give a
[1:48:37] definition of joy and i don't know if
[1:48:39] their opinion is any more important than
[1:48:41] yours
[1:48:42] but i happen to run across them and
[1:48:44] they've been in my notes ever since i
[1:48:45] started this
[1:48:47] little time with you on joy and i'm not
[1:48:49] read them yet so i'm going to do that
[1:48:50] today
[1:48:52] john piper some of you know who that is
[1:48:55] he defines joy like this christian joy
[1:48:59] is a good feeling in the soul
[1:49:03] produced
[1:49:04] by the holy spirit
[1:49:06] as he causes us to see the beauty of
[1:49:10] christ in the word
[1:49:12] and in the world
[1:49:14] all right
[1:49:16] now maybe you've heard the name rick
[1:49:18] warren i'm sure you have
[1:49:20] a bit of a controversial uh figure but
[1:49:23] very well known i actually like his
[1:49:25] definition better
[1:49:27] he said joy
[1:49:29] is the settled assurance
[1:49:33] that god is in control
[1:49:37] of all the details
[1:49:39] of my life it is the quiet confidence
[1:49:44] that ultimately everything is going to
[1:49:47] be all right
[1:49:49] and the determined choice
[1:49:52] to praise god
[1:49:54] in every
[1:49:56] situation
[1:49:58] and in every circumstance can i read it
[1:50:00] again
[1:50:01] joy
[1:50:03] is the settled assurance
[1:50:05] that god is in control of all the
[1:50:07] details of my life the quiet confidence
[1:50:11] that ultimately everything is going to
[1:50:13] be all right and the determined choice
[1:50:16] to praise god
[1:50:18] in every situation
[1:50:21] and in every circumstance see it's a
[1:50:23] choice
[1:50:24] and that choice is a very important part
[1:50:26] of what joy is
[1:50:29] but i think it's even more than that
[1:50:32] i think it's a deep
[1:50:34] settled
[1:50:36] abiding
[1:50:38] a continuing
[1:50:40] in something
[1:50:42] i want to read you a couple of verses
[1:50:44] from john 15
[1:50:46] and i want to tell you that this is how
[1:50:48] you can maintain joy in a messy world
[1:50:51] in a world like we're living in right
[1:50:53] now you can continue to have the joy of
[1:50:55] the lord and the joy of god is a fruit
[1:50:57] in your life in john chapter 15 verse 4
[1:51:01] and 5
[1:51:02] he said abide in me
[1:51:05] and i in you
[1:51:08] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:51:10] itself except it abide in the vine
[1:51:14] no more can ye
[1:51:16] accept ye abide in me i am the vine
[1:51:21] and ye are the branches
[1:51:23] he that abideth in me and i in him
[1:51:28] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:51:32] i like the way the king james says this
[1:51:34] next phrase
[1:51:36] jesus is making a pretty bold statement
[1:51:39] for without me
[1:51:44] anybody hear the words of the lord red
[1:51:47] letter talking right to you this morning
[1:51:50] he's talking right to us
[1:51:51] for without me you can do nothing
[1:51:55] as soon as you think you can do it you
[1:51:57] can handle it you can get by on your own
[1:52:00] that's when you withdraw yourself from
[1:52:03] the vine
[1:52:05] you're disconnecting yourself from the
[1:52:08] only source of life hope and strength
[1:52:12] that we can have in this hour don't you
[1:52:14] dare pull that cord don't you dare
[1:52:17] unplug yourself from the source of life
[1:52:20] and strength and hope that we find in
[1:52:22] the lord jesus christ now i want to read
[1:52:24] those two verses in the amplified are
[1:52:26] you with me is it all right the goal is
[1:52:28] slow right now good dwell in me
[1:52:33] and i will dwell in you this is how you
[1:52:35] can keep the joy
[1:52:37] this is how you can keep the peace
[1:52:40] this is how you can walk in hope
[1:52:43] this is how you can get through
[1:52:45] everything you're going to face this
[1:52:46] week and the next and the next by
[1:52:49] abiding in him
[1:52:50] by dwelling in him by making the lord
[1:52:53] your habitation by making the lord your
[1:52:56] living place your dwelling place your
[1:52:58] tabernacle your temple he said dwell in
[1:53:01] me and i will dwell in you live in me
[1:53:04] and i will live in you just as no branch
[1:53:07] can bear fruit of itself without abiding
[1:53:10] in being vitally united to the vine
[1:53:14] neither can you bear fruit unless you
[1:53:16] abide
[1:53:17] in me
[1:53:19] i am the vine you are the branches
[1:53:22] whoever lives in me and i in him bears
[1:53:25] much abundant fruit however apart from
[1:53:28] me
[1:53:29] i like this parent this these brackets
[1:53:32] here
[1:53:33] cut off from vital union with me
[1:53:37] you can do huh
[1:53:40] you can do
[1:53:42] nothing
[1:53:45] there is a union
[1:53:48] there is a oneness
[1:53:50] that this word has revealed to us
[1:53:52] in this hour you can be one with him you
[1:53:57] can be one with the word and when you
[1:54:00] cut off that vital union of fellowship
[1:54:03] with him
[1:54:04] you
[1:54:05] can
[1:54:06] do nothing
[1:54:09] did you know carrying a spirit
[1:54:12] that is not christ
[1:54:14] can absolutely cut us off from our place
[1:54:18] of union
[1:54:20] with him
[1:54:21] it's happened to every one of us
[1:54:23] someone said i don't even believe that
[1:54:24] it doesn't matter whether you believe it
[1:54:25] or not it's happened to every one of us
[1:54:28] we have faced situations and
[1:54:30] circumstances in life where our where
[1:54:33] somebody's action coupled with our
[1:54:36] reaction has caused us to carry a spirit
[1:54:38] that is not christ
[1:54:42] and when we carry that and nurture that
[1:54:45] and and and pour life into that instead
[1:54:49] of into our union with christ
[1:54:52] when we hold tighter to our woundedness
[1:54:56] when we hold tighter to our our our pain
[1:55:00] than we do to our union with christ it
[1:55:02] absolutely cuts us off from the joy from
[1:55:05] the hope from the peace
[1:55:09] you see we're living in this hour among
[1:55:11] the walking dead
[1:55:13] we shop with the walking dead
[1:55:16] we we work with the walking dead
[1:55:19] true
[1:55:20] we go to church with some who are
[1:55:22] walking dead
[1:55:24] nobody has forced them into a tomb no
[1:55:27] one has forced them to live in that cold
[1:55:29] cold place
[1:55:31] but because of some circumstance or
[1:55:34] something that has happened in life they
[1:55:35] have withdrawn themselves into a into a
[1:55:38] tomb
[1:55:40] and though they walk and though they
[1:55:42] function and though they move even
[1:55:43] though they come to church sometime the
[1:55:45] hollow
[1:55:46] look in their face is a testimony that
[1:55:49] they are no longer drinking
[1:55:53] they're no longer drinking from the
[1:55:55] blood
[1:55:58] they're no longer eating flesh
[1:56:01] that's his
[1:56:02] they're no longer having communion with
[1:56:05] christ no longer abiding no longer
[1:56:08] dwelling with him you can change that
[1:56:11] you can change that today you can change
[1:56:13] that today
[1:56:14] you can change that today
[1:56:17] today you don't have to wait till
[1:56:19] tomorrow to make a change you can do
[1:56:21] that today
[1:56:22] hallelujah
[1:56:24] look at seven and eight john 15 7-8 he
[1:56:27] goes on if ye abide in me and my words
[1:56:31] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[1:56:34] and it shall be done unto you herein is
[1:56:37] my father glorified that you bear much
[1:56:40] fruit so shall ye be my disciples
[1:56:43] in the amplified it says if you live in
[1:56:45] me abide vitally united to me and my
[1:56:50] words remain in you and continue to live
[1:56:53] in your hearts ask whatever you
[1:56:57] will
[1:56:59] huh
[1:57:01] i'm waiting on you
[1:57:03] ask whatever you will and it shall be
[1:57:06] done i want out of my pit i want out of
[1:57:08] my tomb i want out of my grave i want
[1:57:12] out of my coldness i want out of the
[1:57:14] darkness i want out of this joyless life
[1:57:17] i want to find what i know is mine i
[1:57:20] want to make up my mind that no
[1:57:22] circumstance is going to keep me from my
[1:57:24] inheritance
[1:57:26] no demon of hell
[1:57:28] sometimes i've heard the laughter in
[1:57:30] hell and i want you to know it's a
[1:57:32] hideous sound
[1:57:34] it's somewhere between a crying scream
[1:57:36] and a laugh and i believe demons laugh i
[1:57:39] believe they laugh all around us at
[1:57:40] times
[1:57:42] because they convince us with their lies
[1:57:45] with the way they touch our lives they
[1:57:47] convince us not to fight for what's
[1:57:48] rightfully ours
[1:57:50] we're not talking about fighting flesh
[1:57:52] and blood and principality i mean
[1:57:54] fighting flesh and blood and personality
[1:57:56] we're talking about spiritual battles
[1:57:59] and we're talking about fighting
[1:58:00] principalities instead of personalities
[1:58:04] it's a higher warfare that's going on in
[1:58:06] this hour amen
[1:58:09] amen not only is the enemy accusing you
[1:58:12] doing all that he can to tell god how
[1:58:14] sorry you are
[1:58:15] but he's loosed among us trying to
[1:58:18] accuse one to the other he's accusing
[1:58:20] the brother to the brother and the
[1:58:22] sister to the sister he's a liar
[1:58:26] the father of all lies
[1:58:29] and it's only by a unified and agreement
[1:58:33] coming together and saying we cut you
[1:58:36] off
[1:58:40] we cut you off
[1:58:42] we serve notice on you today oh shut up
[1:58:47] i don't have to listen to your cataholin
[1:58:51] i don't have to listen to your
[1:58:54] accusation
[1:58:55] there's a joy that's mine
[1:58:59] john 15 10-11 this is the last verse is
[1:59:02] from john 15. if you keep my
[1:59:04] commandments
[1:59:05] you shall abide in my love
[1:59:08] even as i have kept my father's
[1:59:09] commandments and abide in his love
[1:59:14] these listen listen folks
[1:59:17] it's impossible
[1:59:19] to dwell in the love of jesus christ and
[1:59:21] have no joy
[1:59:26] you you can't live in his love and pout
[1:59:32] you'd be ashamed to it
[1:59:34] you'd be convicted of it
[1:59:36] the spirit of the lord
[1:59:38] would be all over you
[1:59:40] you see i'm convinced that we sing of
[1:59:43] our love for the lord but we don't
[1:59:45] really understand what it means to love
[1:59:50] him
[1:59:53] see
[1:59:54] you know i love
[1:59:56] cookies
[1:59:59] i know you're supposed to like
[2:00:01] cookies and love people but i i really
[2:00:04] am fond of cookies
[2:00:09] tell me what you love
[2:00:13] there are some people that rather have
[2:00:14] cake i'd rather have cookie than cake
[2:00:20] tell me what you love i love fried
[2:00:22] chicken
[2:00:26] i love homemade biscuit who says what
[2:00:28] they say what'd you say strawberry
[2:00:29] something
[2:00:30] what'd you say you love
[2:00:35] it's long i love berries but i love the
[2:00:37] fact that you slid the ice cream in
[2:00:39] there too now that is
[2:00:42] that girl knows
[2:00:44] if you're gonna go with that kind of
[2:00:46] healthy thought of berries you might as
[2:00:48] well slide a little something in there
[2:00:53] sweeten the berries
[2:00:54] i think we get in our mind that what
[2:00:56] we're fond of
[2:00:59] is love
[2:01:00] but how many of you know that's not
[2:01:02] really love
[2:01:04] you're not affectionate toward uh
[2:01:06] berries and ice cream
[2:01:12] i've had some pretty good moments
[2:01:15] over a good oatmeal cookie
[2:01:20] yes with raisins
[2:01:23] of course
[2:01:26] it's got to be all the way
[2:01:28] i think sometimes we say i love him
[2:01:32] like he's a flavor
[2:01:36] like i prefer chocolate over vanilla
[2:01:39] but i want you to know that's not loving
[2:01:41] christ
[2:01:43] loving him is being willing to lay down
[2:01:47] everything that we have everything that
[2:01:51] we are
[2:01:52] everything that we're fond of everything
[2:01:55] we like laying it all down and loving
[2:01:59] him
[2:02:00] really
[2:02:02] loving
[2:02:03] him
[2:02:05] and when we when we live in that place
[2:02:08] of relationship
[2:02:11] it is impossible to do it without joy
[2:02:19] you can't live in that love and rebel
[2:02:24] against what god's trying to do
[2:02:27] for you and through you and around you
[2:02:32] when you are living in the love of god
[2:02:35] you enjoy that time with him but but you
[2:02:38] don't completely cut yourself off from
[2:02:40] the rest of the body of christ because
[2:02:43] there's so much love in your heart the
[2:02:45] love you have for him the love he has
[2:02:47] for you you want to spread some of that
[2:02:49] around
[2:02:51] just like you're willing on on occasion
[2:02:53] as long as you got lots of cookies
[2:02:56] you're willing to share them
[2:02:58] when you find something you really like
[2:03:01] that you really are fond of you want to
[2:03:03] share that you want to talk about that
[2:03:05] with somebody else i'm telling you the
[2:03:07] bride of christ must have communion with
[2:03:10] him
[2:03:11] we must have won this we must have
[2:03:13] abiding we must have dwelling we must
[2:03:16] have intimacy with him
[2:03:19] it's about leaning on our beloved it's
[2:03:22] about trusting that if we can't stand on
[2:03:25] our own his
[2:03:26] shoulder remains solid
[2:03:31] unmovable unshakable
[2:03:34] by the powers around us we can lean on
[2:03:37] him
[2:03:38] we can depend on him
[2:03:41] we can find everything we need in him
[2:03:44] are you with me
[2:03:46] if you keep my commandments
[2:03:48] you shall abide in my love even as i've
[2:03:50] kept my father's commandments and abide
[2:03:52] in his love these things have i spoken
[2:03:56] unto you listen
[2:03:58] that my joy what joy the joy of the lord
[2:04:01] the joy of the lord the joy of the lord
[2:04:02] the joy of the lord
[2:04:05] that my joy
[2:04:07] might
[2:04:08] remain in you
[2:04:12] it is not the will of jesus christ for
[2:04:14] you and i to only have the joy of the
[2:04:16] lord in a set of special meetings
[2:04:21] it's not the will of the lord for us to
[2:04:23] only abide in that joy and have that joy
[2:04:26] dwelling in us when everything is going
[2:04:28] good that's not the joy of the lord the
[2:04:32] joy of the lord is what sustains us when
[2:04:34] everything's going bad
[2:04:36] the joy of the lord is what becomes a
[2:04:39] weapon
[2:04:40] when we understand that praise is not
[2:04:43] just uh standing in awe of him and
[2:04:45] lauding him as king of kings and lord of
[2:04:48] lords but praise is actually something
[2:04:51] that shifts the spiritual atmosphere
[2:04:55] around us
[2:04:56] because when the praises go up
[2:04:59] the blessings of the lord start
[2:05:02] filtering down is anybody still with us
[2:05:05] anybody still with me right now i want
[2:05:07] to hurry
[2:05:09] i want to hurry i do i really do
[2:05:11] i've told you these things that my joy
[2:05:13] in in the amplified verse 11 in the
[2:05:16] amplified i've told you these things
[2:05:18] that my joy and delight may be in you
[2:05:22] and that your joy and gladness may be a
[2:05:25] full
[2:05:26] measure
[2:05:28] filled up
[2:05:30] whoa how many of you like to have so
[2:05:32] much of the joy of the lord there's no
[2:05:33] room for it anymore
[2:05:35] you you got it all you got all the joy
[2:05:37] the lord you hold
[2:05:39] and and then you get completed by that
[2:05:42] place
[2:05:43] because you understand that you're
[2:05:44] connected and you're abiding and you're
[2:05:46] in oneness with him and then it
[2:05:47] overflows
[2:05:49] and you can't hold it back whoop
[2:05:51] that's when joy becomes a weapon
[2:05:54] that's when joy becomes a strategy
[2:05:56] to win a battle
[2:05:58] that
[2:05:59] needs to be won
[2:06:01] come on now
[2:06:03] shout
[2:06:05] when they heard the sound of the trumpet
[2:06:07] they shouted
[2:06:11] i don't know if it was a trumpet or the
[2:06:13] shouting i don't know what it was it was
[2:06:16] those sounds probably blending together
[2:06:18] in obedience to the lord that caused
[2:06:21] that wall to fall flat it just
[2:06:23] disintegrated and they didn't even have
[2:06:26] to step over it
[2:06:29] they just walked right in the strangest
[2:06:31] silliest
[2:06:33] strategy that you've ever heard for
[2:06:34] winning a battle and taking a wall city
[2:06:37] and yet it's what god chose i'm telling
[2:06:39] you if you will choose today to remain
[2:06:42] in the joy of the lord no matter what's
[2:06:44] going on in your life somebody listening
[2:06:47] if you will choose today to remain in
[2:06:49] the joy of the lord no matter what's
[2:06:50] going on in your life you will find the
[2:06:53] victory
[2:06:54] is on the other side of your shout out
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:04] whether you realize it or not
[2:07:06] the economy the economy and the kingdom
[2:07:09] of god is marching on
[2:07:14] when we take ourselves out of the church
[2:07:16] we put ourselves in and we take
[2:07:18] ourselves out we put ourselves in we
[2:07:20] take ourselves out
[2:07:22] it's like i told a married couple here
[2:07:24] one time neither one of them in church
[2:07:26] this morning
[2:07:27] i haven't seen either one of them in
[2:07:28] church in years now
[2:07:30] no one to blame but themselves
[2:07:33] and this is their what i told them one
[2:07:35] day standing down in front of the
[2:07:36] tabernacle there i said if the two of
[2:07:38] you could ever get the victory at the
[2:07:41] same time
[2:07:46] that's not impossible
[2:07:48] it's a made-up mind
[2:07:51] it simply means if if daddy could be
[2:07:54] over here crying out to god and mama
[2:07:56] over here crying out to god at the same
[2:07:59] time
[2:08:00] not getting up i feel the holy ghost
[2:08:03] not getting up until they know that they
[2:08:05] have touched the throne
[2:08:08] and go out of here with victory no
[2:08:10] matter what they face
[2:08:12] no matter what's going on in the
[2:08:13] marriage
[2:08:14] no matter what's going on with the
[2:08:16] children but with a made-up mind i'm
[2:08:18] going to abide in him i'm going to dwell
[2:08:21] in him i'm going to live in his word i'm
[2:08:24] going to rest in his word i'm going to
[2:08:26] feast on his word hallelujah
[2:08:30] i'm going to let his word encourage me
[2:08:32] and i'm going to let it thrill me and
[2:08:34] i'm going to let it correct me and i'm
[2:08:36] going to let it direct me
[2:08:39] made of mine
[2:08:41] forgiving one another
[2:08:44] forgiving one another
[2:08:46] if you all could ever get on the
[2:08:47] mountain at the same time there is no
[2:08:49] telling what you could accomplish for
[2:08:51] the lord
[2:08:53] it's easy to pick on them they're
[2:08:54] they're a great target to pick on this
[2:08:56] morning because neither one of them are
[2:08:58] in the house of god
[2:09:07] that's not just about them
[2:09:11] how many husbands and wives are here
[2:09:12] this morning
[2:09:14] how many husbands and wives are
[2:09:15] streaming this service that the absolute
[2:09:18] truth could be said should be said it's
[2:09:21] being said
[2:09:23] because i'm saying it
[2:09:25] about you this morning
[2:09:27] i don't do this often like this
[2:09:30] i'm speaking to husbands and wives under
[2:09:32] the sound of my voice i wonder what
[2:09:33] could be accomplished in your life
[2:09:36] i wonder what kind of favor you could
[2:09:38] lose
[2:09:39] on your own family
[2:09:42] it's not about that that's not all we're
[2:09:44] after it's having favor on our family
[2:09:47] the favor of god and man on our family
[2:09:49] that's not all we're after that's just a
[2:09:51] that's just a benefit that's just a
[2:09:53] fringe benefit that's just the overflow
[2:09:55] of god's goodness in our life
[2:09:57] but then every then every uh uh promise
[2:10:02] every word every call
[2:10:06] every prophetic utterance over your life
[2:10:09] and what god desired to do in you
[2:10:14] see we're living in an hour where it's
[2:10:16] easier to blame the messenger
[2:10:19] it's so much easier to blame the mailman
[2:10:22] and i'll take my part of the
[2:10:24] responsibility for every mistake that
[2:10:26] i've ever made as a pastor i take my
[2:10:29] part i'm willing i
[2:10:30] i've tried my best to be someone who
[2:10:32] could come back and say i'm i'm sorry
[2:10:35] i've not done it right i hate the way
[2:10:37] i've done it i hate that it turned out
[2:10:38] like this this is not what we want but i
[2:10:41] want you to know something the messenger
[2:10:43] the mailman he couldn't bear the whole
[2:10:45] responsibility for the promise of god
[2:10:48] that's hanging over your life not being
[2:10:50] fulfilled
[2:10:52] when you're not positioning yourself to
[2:10:54] receive what god has said
[2:10:57] i wonder what kind of dynamos would come
[2:11:00] forth in this house if husbands and
[2:11:02] wives sitting here this morning would
[2:11:05] raise up together at one time
[2:11:08] and determine we're not going to go
[2:11:10] another day not another 24-hour day
[2:11:13] living out of joint
[2:11:18] we're going to live in unity with one
[2:11:20] another both in the natural and in the
[2:11:22] spiritual
[2:11:23] we're gonna we're gonna put our our uh
[2:11:26] investment in we're gonna put it all in
[2:11:28] we're gonna put our faith all in
[2:11:31] we're going to rise that listen life is
[2:11:33] is moving on and the economy of god is
[2:11:35] moving on and the purposes of god are
[2:11:37] moving on and they didn't wait on you
[2:11:42] they're just moving on and you're not
[2:11:44] getting any younger this morning i'm not
[2:11:46] the only one that's aging
[2:11:49] you're aging
[2:11:50] too in fact the older we get the the
[2:11:54] less we have
[2:11:57] in strength and physical dexterity
[2:12:00] to do what we've been called to do
[2:12:02] it's true
[2:12:04] it doesn't mean we lay down and give up
[2:12:06] it means we just take what we got and
[2:12:08] press on
[2:12:10] but there are callings laying over lives
[2:12:12] this morning that need to be fulfilled
[2:12:16] that words that need to be in action and
[2:12:19] teams that need to be reunited
[2:12:22] i'm talking about husbands and wives but
[2:12:24] that's not the only thing that god
[2:12:26] desires to do
[2:12:30] because he once had had a a relationship
[2:12:34] like a paul and a silas or like a david
[2:12:36] and a jonathan or come on
[2:12:39] there are times that your gift and and
[2:12:42] my gift complement one another or yours
[2:12:45] and yours or god puts people together
[2:12:48] for certain seasons and purposes and
[2:12:50] plans and sometimes it expires sometimes
[2:12:53] it runs out sometimes it doesn't run out
[2:12:56] sometimes it changes in some way but
[2:12:59] never runs out come on it doesn't have
[2:13:00] to be it doesn't have to end in disaster
[2:13:04] sometimes it does
[2:13:05] because there's a word there's a plumb
[2:13:07] line that we cannot compromise on is
[2:13:10] anybody with me
[2:13:12] there's a plumb line that we can't
[2:13:13] compromise on and that's the word of god
[2:13:17] as much as we love people there's a
[2:13:19] plumb line that we can't compromise on
[2:13:22] and that's the word of god
[2:13:24] you know i don't want to hinder anybody
[2:13:26] i'll be honest this morning i don't want
[2:13:27] to be the reason why
[2:13:29] that you're hindered on your journey
[2:13:32] i want to be the reason why you got help
[2:13:35] i want to be the reason why you broke
[2:13:37] through
[2:13:38] that's why i give of myself
[2:13:41] it's because i want to be a help to you
[2:13:43] and if i can't i'll be honest i want you
[2:13:46] to go where you can get help
[2:13:49] you don't have to leave mad
[2:13:52] you don't have to leave ugly
[2:13:55] you can leave with a kind spirit you can
[2:13:57] leave with the right attitude
[2:13:59] if you have come to a place where you
[2:14:01] recognize i just will never be able to
[2:14:04] get above and get my help
[2:14:06] here it'll be hard terribly hard
[2:14:11] nobody wants to see anything like that
[2:14:13] happen but if it has come to that place
[2:14:16] you've got to run for your life
[2:14:21] if you find that this is not your refuge
[2:14:24] find your refuge
[2:14:27] it's never in a church it's always in
[2:14:30] christ
[2:14:32] but if something hinders you in this
[2:14:34] house
[2:14:35] i would not desire that you sit and die
[2:14:39] on the vine
[2:14:42] is that ugly
[2:14:44] do i seem to have a bad attitude with
[2:14:46] what i'm saying
[2:14:48] even brother greene he had an odd way of
[2:14:51] doing things at times
[2:14:53] he thought everybody ought to be at the
[2:14:55] tabernacle
[2:14:57] because that was
[2:14:59] that was his vision his commission
[2:15:01] but he realized through the years that
[2:15:05] you can't always
[2:15:07] hold people
[2:15:09] and they want to go they go
[2:15:11] and he decided i don't have to be mad at
[2:15:14] him because they go i can bless him on
[2:15:15] the way
[2:15:18] it was hurtful to him that so many would
[2:15:21] leave and he would bless them and help
[2:15:23] them as they left and then later they
[2:15:25] would say mighty awful things about him
[2:15:28] and about the tabernacle
[2:15:30] but he said i i
[2:15:32] i can't make them love me more
[2:15:35] but i've got to make sure i continue to
[2:15:37] love them and love them more
[2:15:39] and when he found out that somebody
[2:15:41] wanted to start a church
[2:15:43] in the city
[2:15:44] and he had a part in just about every
[2:15:46] church in tucson and they tell me
[2:15:48] there's almost 20.
[2:15:51] one town spread out a bit
[2:15:55] i don't know
[2:15:56] too many of them that are full
[2:15:59] but they're all doing what they believe
[2:16:00] the lord has called them to do
[2:16:02] but if they would go to him in the right
[2:16:04] way and say i feel like i'm to go on
[2:16:06] he would say we i bless you
[2:16:10] he said one condition
[2:16:12] if you go off and find that there is
[2:16:15] something better
[2:16:17] than what we have here don't forget us
[2:16:23] come back and tell us
[2:16:26] tell us what you found it may be that we
[2:16:30] need the same thing you find that's
[2:16:32] pretty good attitude
[2:16:34] and then he would say what do you need
[2:16:36] do you need a piano
[2:16:38] do you need an organ
[2:16:40] do you need pews
[2:16:42] do you need a pulpit
[2:16:44] let me provide for you what you need to
[2:16:48] go on i don't want to be the reason why
[2:16:51] you can't fulfill what god has called
[2:16:53] you to fulfill
[2:16:54] i'm telling you that this morning from
[2:16:56] the bottom of my heart i don't want to
[2:16:58] be the the reason i don't want to be the
[2:17:01] excuse
[2:17:02] that you use to stand between you and
[2:17:05] your call your commission
[2:17:08] what god has called you to do i
[2:17:10] personally believe that everybody here
[2:17:12] this morning i can't speak for streamers
[2:17:14] because i don't know who's streaming
[2:17:16] but i personally believe that every one
[2:17:18] of us can find what we need in this
[2:17:21] house
[2:17:23] because i've seen what god is doing
[2:17:26] and i've seen the eternal differences
[2:17:28] that he is making around us
[2:17:30] and i believe we can but my opinion is
[2:17:32] my opinion
[2:17:34] you've got to hear for yourself but
[2:17:37] whatever you do don't be
[2:17:40] satisfied with anything less
[2:17:44] than knowing that you are in the perfect
[2:17:49] will
[2:17:50] of god
[2:17:53] i've been in touch with several families
[2:17:55] recently several
[2:17:56] more than one
[2:17:58] who have it in their heart
[2:18:00] they would like to move here
[2:18:02] they would like to go to church here
[2:18:05] they would like to make this their
[2:18:06] church home
[2:18:08] some are boldly sharing it with others
[2:18:10] some are quietly praying about it and
[2:18:12] seeking the will of god i'm neither
[2:18:15] excited
[2:18:17] nor disappointed
[2:18:22] i stand here today i
[2:18:24] want what god
[2:18:27] wants
[2:18:28] it's easy to say
[2:18:30] but i mean it
[2:18:32] from the bottom of my life from from the
[2:18:35] depth of who i am i want what god wants
[2:18:42] but i'm tired
[2:18:44] of seeing people
[2:18:47] not receive
[2:18:49] what's spread for them
[2:18:52] the table spread
[2:18:55] the banquet prepared and god's saying
[2:18:57] come get a piece of this
[2:18:59] come taste this
[2:19:01] come and experience me and people
[2:19:03] sitting back it's hard to watch people
[2:19:06] starving to death for what can be
[2:19:09] accomplished in their lives by the
[2:19:11] presence of the lord i believe the word
[2:19:13] of god must have preeminence among us i
[2:19:15] believe it's the most important thing to
[2:19:18] feed on to live on but i also understand
[2:19:21] and value
[2:19:23] the presence of the lord
[2:19:29] we sing a song i love i love your
[2:19:33] presence
[2:19:35] someone wondered if that was a an okay
[2:19:37] song to sing because we're supposed to
[2:19:39] love the lord i get it i understand that
[2:19:41] 100
[2:19:42] but i want you to know something i have
[2:19:45] come to find that where he goes
[2:19:51] his presence
[2:19:53] goes with him
[2:19:55] and i just love oh you say what in the
[2:19:57] world do you mean haven't you ever had
[2:19:58] anybody in your life you just love being
[2:20:00] with
[2:20:03] people will criticize you
[2:20:05] they really will they'll criticize you
[2:20:07] because you have found somebody that you
[2:20:09] like being with
[2:20:11] but there are just people that you that
[2:20:13] you run into in life
[2:20:16] that you just like being with
[2:20:18] i can describe that person
[2:20:23] maybe not every detail but one is
[2:20:25] somebody i can trust
[2:20:28] somebody i can let my hair down with i
[2:20:31] don't have a bun to take out you know
[2:20:33] but somebody that you don't have to be
[2:20:37] anything
[2:20:38] but who you are
[2:20:40] you don't have to be religious
[2:20:42] you don't have to put on any kind of
[2:20:45] you're just
[2:20:46] you're just who you are
[2:20:48] you're just you're just who you are but
[2:20:51] i like to be with somebody who wants to
[2:20:53] talk about the things of the lord
[2:20:56] in the right timing
[2:20:58] in the right atmosphere what do you mean
[2:21:00] by that well i mean there's a time that
[2:21:03] you know the certain circumstances or
[2:21:05] the or the dynamic of a room or
[2:21:07] something or or you may be with people
[2:21:09] who don't really have full understanding
[2:21:11] of things you want to be careful
[2:21:12] sometimes what you lay out on the table
[2:21:15] what you say in front of others
[2:21:17] when folks are first coming into the
[2:21:19] truth
[2:21:20] you want to be wise and how you lay it
[2:21:22] out and what you say so there are times
[2:21:24] that you just can't completely talk
[2:21:26] freely the way you want to but if you
[2:21:28] can find somebody like that if you can
[2:21:30] find somebody hungry for what you're
[2:21:32] hungry for
[2:21:33] who longs for what you long for and you
[2:21:37] get in that place you just love there's
[2:21:38] nothing wrong with that folks there's
[2:21:40] nothing wrong with finding that place in
[2:21:42] your life i just want you to know it's
[2:21:44] so rare
[2:21:46] and of such value
[2:21:48] that if we don't treasure it and develop
[2:21:51] it and honor it we lose it it's so
[2:21:54] important to honor that kind of a place
[2:21:58] there's going to be others that you
[2:21:59] don't mind having fellowship with but
[2:22:01] you realize that at this point in your
[2:22:04] life you could never be
[2:22:07] fully comfortable
[2:22:09] and so you you do what you know you're
[2:22:11] supposed to do you show what you feel
[2:22:13] like you're supposed to show but you
[2:22:14] couldn't relax
[2:22:17] you you can't help that
[2:22:19] there's nothing wrong with that
[2:22:22] we are looking all of us for a place
[2:22:25] where we can just
[2:22:27] be
[2:22:29] be in his presence
[2:22:31] be in the faith
[2:22:33] walk in the truth
[2:22:34] without demand
[2:22:36] for performance
[2:22:38] how many of you just don't want to
[2:22:39] perform
[2:22:41] you don't have to struggle to keep a
[2:22:43] relationship going fight to have a
[2:22:46] friendship going you just want to trust
[2:22:48] one another and love one another and
[2:22:50] only god can do that for you but once
[2:22:52] you find that you just you light up when
[2:22:54] that person comes around
[2:22:59] i guess a relationship like that can
[2:23:01] even be misunderstood at times but you
[2:23:04] just light up
[2:23:06] when that kind of a person or that
[2:23:08] person comes around you don't have to be
[2:23:10] ashamed to love the presence of jesus
[2:23:12] christ
[2:23:14] i love his presence because i love when
[2:23:18] he comes
[2:23:19] when he comes his presence comes with
[2:23:21] him in his presence there is fullness of
[2:23:24] joy
[2:23:26] it's the desire of the lord jesus christ
[2:23:29] that his joy and delight is in us his
[2:23:32] gladness may be full measure and
[2:23:36] complete and overflowing in our life you
[2:23:40] believe that
[2:23:41] say amen
[2:23:43] now in in the in the church age book
[2:23:47] the smyrnan age
[2:23:50] brother branham makes this statement if
[2:23:52] you'll
[2:23:53] find it for me there
[2:23:55] this is part of what we have to work on
[2:23:58] doing
[2:24:02] it's just a short little
[2:24:04] paragraph there
[2:24:06] it starts off how shall i prove
[2:24:10] that's not it
[2:24:12] and how shall i prove my love to him
[2:24:15] he said and how
[2:24:17] shall i prove
[2:24:19] my love to him
[2:24:21] see we talked about really loving him
[2:24:25] how shall i prove my love to him by
[2:24:29] believing what he said
[2:24:32] and by conducting myself with joy
[2:24:39] when you choose joy you're proving your
[2:24:41] love to him
[2:24:43] when you're determined to conduct
[2:24:45] yourself with joy amidst the trials
[2:24:50] there's going to be trial there's going
[2:24:52] to be hardship there's going to be
[2:24:54] sickness there's going to be all these
[2:24:56] things
[2:24:57] but you choose
[2:25:00] i'm going to conduct myself with joy i
[2:25:03] miss the trials
[2:25:05] he said how shall i prove my love to him
[2:25:08] by believing what he said and by
[2:25:09] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[2:25:12] trials that he and his wisdom
[2:25:19] does what
[2:25:20] allows
[2:25:22] allows to come to pass
[2:25:27] you can prove your love
[2:25:29] by choosing to conduct yourself with joy
[2:25:32] come on now
[2:25:33] it's not that hard
[2:25:35] it's just something we have to do there
[2:25:38] are so many things here
[2:25:40] that i had marked
[2:25:42] to re do to go over again but i see my
[2:25:45] time is slipping away and i want to
[2:25:47] reserve some of my time so would you
[2:25:49] give me just a couple more
[2:25:51] quotes here i feel like i'd like to
[2:25:53] share them in a message why
[2:25:56] are you still here
[2:25:58] beaumont texas
[2:26:00] he said this in paragraph 41 but because
[2:26:04] that we do it
[2:26:06] that's the reason
[2:26:08] we're cursed
[2:26:12] that's the reason god's
[2:26:14] put this thing
[2:26:16] upon the church
[2:26:18] this cold and dampness
[2:26:21] we're going to other places for pleasure
[2:26:24] instead of coming to the house of the
[2:26:26] lord for pleasure
[2:26:30] i want you to know my true joy my true
[2:26:32] pleasure is found in the house of the
[2:26:34] lord
[2:26:38] i noticed that in a worship service if
[2:26:40] the worship service goes too long i can
[2:26:42] look around i start noticing people as
[2:26:44] they check out
[2:26:46] i don't even really get upset with them
[2:26:48] because i understand it's the way
[2:26:49] they've trained themselves
[2:26:52] it's what social media
[2:26:54] it's what our phones have done we've
[2:26:56] trained our brains we've shrunk our
[2:26:58] attention spans
[2:27:00] we have and we made it so easy to go
[2:27:03] from one thing to the next by the moving
[2:27:06] of the thumb
[2:27:08] and i literally know in church many many
[2:27:10] times when someone has thumb to me
[2:27:16] they've gone on to another thought
[2:27:19] they're on to something else
[2:27:22] this is the trick of the enemy
[2:27:25] when we get in that presence of the lord
[2:27:28] nothing should be able to pull us out of
[2:27:30] that place
[2:27:32] we should make up our mind i'm going to
[2:27:34] stay engaged till the last amen
[2:27:38] [Music]
[2:27:39] i am impressed with some of you who have
[2:27:42] this ability to endure you have this
[2:27:46] ability to press in
[2:27:49] all the way through and it's not just
[2:27:52] the young people in fact i find that the
[2:27:54] young people have the shortest attention
[2:27:56] spans
[2:27:58] i see even older ones they're going to
[2:28:01] be involved in the worship
[2:28:05] the position of their body may change
[2:28:09] but they never take their faith out of
[2:28:11] the deposit
[2:28:13] they stay right in there until the last
[2:28:17] hallelujah because they have learned in
[2:28:20] the trials of life the value
[2:28:24] the value of getting under his word the
[2:28:27] value of getting in his presence
[2:28:30] the value of abiding in the vine
[2:28:34] that's the reason god put this thing
[2:28:35] upon the church this cold and dampness
[2:28:38] we're going to other places for pleasure
[2:28:40] instead of coming to the house of the
[2:28:41] lord for pleasure
[2:28:43] the house of the lord
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:28:49] is the joy of the lord
[2:28:51] i want you to wake up your neighbor in
[2:28:53] love just shake a little bit just in
[2:28:55] love no one's in trouble
[2:28:56] shake them a little bit just wake them
[2:28:58] up a little bit
[2:29:00] do i have to go back to talking about
[2:29:01] ice cream and berries and cookies get
[2:29:03] everybody alert
[2:29:06] i just want to make sure you're with me
[2:29:08] because we're coming into something now
[2:29:10] getting ready to close in the time we've
[2:29:12] reserved
[2:29:17] the house of the lord is the joy of the
[2:29:19] lord
[2:29:21] when we come together in his house
[2:29:24] and that's what we're talking about
[2:29:25] that's what he's talking about when we
[2:29:27] come together in his house
[2:29:30] with his people he goes on to say the
[2:29:32] joy of the lord is the joy of his people
[2:29:37] he wants you to come to church
[2:29:40] and worship him
[2:29:42] and be happy
[2:29:49] do you need a singing fish
[2:29:56] somebody gave me a singing fish one time
[2:30:00] my wife thrown it out eventually
[2:30:04] i said what'd you throw that out for
[2:30:08] i liked it
[2:30:12] don't worry
[2:30:15] be happy
[2:30:20] we need to be reminded sometime
[2:30:26] we need to be reminded sometime don't
[2:30:28] worry
[2:30:30] be happy
[2:30:33] he wants you to come to church and
[2:30:35] worship him and be happy and satisfied
[2:30:38] giving praise and honor and glory and
[2:30:40] wisdom and mind and power to god he
[2:30:42] wants you to do that but folks you can't
[2:30:45] do that
[2:30:47] unless you realize that you're a part of
[2:30:50] a church
[2:30:53] you're where you belong
[2:30:58] and you're pulling with
[2:31:01] instead of against
[2:31:10] but i know
[2:31:12] they don't really want me
[2:31:15] well listen folks
[2:31:17] some of you have family that doesn't
[2:31:19] really want you
[2:31:24] but you keep showing up
[2:31:28] have they ever refused a birthday
[2:31:30] present from you
[2:31:34] have they ever refused a christmas
[2:31:35] present from you if you give christmas
[2:31:37] presents i don't but if you do
[2:31:40] they may not want to hang with you
[2:31:43] but you're still family
[2:31:48] and they're going to they're going to
[2:31:49] accept you on that term if nothing else
[2:31:52] so the truth is this if you know that
[2:31:55] you know that you know that you know
[2:31:58] that you belong in this house
[2:32:03] if god has shown you
[2:32:06] that this is where you belong
[2:32:09] then with all your heart
[2:32:11] you're going to do everything within
[2:32:14] your power
[2:32:15] to take us
[2:32:17] to a higher place
[2:32:19] with your presence
[2:32:21] you're not going to come in here with a
[2:32:23] pout
[2:32:25] you're not going to come in here in
[2:32:26] anger
[2:32:28] you're not going to come in here with a
[2:32:29] glare
[2:32:31] you're not going to come in here walling
[2:32:33] your eyes when the service is going on
[2:32:35] you're not going to despise who's moving
[2:32:38] who's trying
[2:32:39] who's playing the instrument who's
[2:32:41] leading the worship you're going to put
[2:32:43] your heart in
[2:32:45] you're going to encourage your family to
[2:32:47] do the same
[2:32:49] you're going to focus on him
[2:32:52] you're going to come in he wants you to
[2:32:54] come to church and worship him and be
[2:32:56] happy and satisfied giving praise and
[2:32:59] honor and glory and wisdom and might and
[2:33:02] power to god he wants you to do that
[2:33:06] and here's the key if you can't do that
[2:33:11] then you need to find
[2:33:13] your spot
[2:33:18] you do
[2:33:20] where you can do that
[2:33:22] because some of you are just not doing
[2:33:24] it here
[2:33:25] you just need to you need to make up
[2:33:28] your mind i believe i heard the lord
[2:33:30] clearly this morning
[2:33:32] and i knew exactly what the atmosphere
[2:33:35] would be like if i got around to
[2:33:37] delaying that out because that's what we
[2:33:39] deal with now
[2:33:41] we have to gauge the atmosphere and make
[2:33:44] sure that everybody's in the right frame
[2:33:46] of mind to hear the word of the lord
[2:33:49] then we have to deal with all the
[2:33:51] repercussions
[2:33:53] of delivering the word of the lord and
[2:33:55] you know what it's getting so late
[2:33:58] it's getting so late
[2:34:01] couldn't we just decide
[2:34:04] it sounds like it's getting personal in
[2:34:06] here it's all right it's all right
[2:34:08] the word of god is sharp and it's
[2:34:10] personal and it gets right down into us
[2:34:14] i love visitors but i realize that every
[2:34:16] person doesn't belong here i realize i
[2:34:19] can't help everybody
[2:34:21] i realize that sometimes things happen
[2:34:24] and we can't get above them or around
[2:34:26] them or over them and we come to an
[2:34:28] impasse
[2:34:30] and we have to make up our mind do i
[2:34:32] want to do something to help
[2:34:36] do i really want to hinder do i really
[2:34:38] want to draw attention to myself
[2:34:41] or do i want to get under the burden of
[2:34:44] the house and glorify god with the right
[2:34:47] spirit
[2:34:51] if we could do that then these little
[2:34:53] spirits would find nobody to use
[2:34:57] they would find nobody to dwell in
[2:34:59] they wouldn't be jumping from person to
[2:35:01] person through the years but they would
[2:35:04] be so shut out of this house
[2:35:06] and i'm determined by the grace of god
[2:35:09] to keep pressing in until we can come
[2:35:11] into that kind of place
[2:35:15] i want every one of us to come into that
[2:35:17] kind of a place i want every one of us
[2:35:19] to put their shoulder to the plow and
[2:35:21] let's do what god has said for us to do
[2:35:24] let's see this house built let's see
[2:35:26] this campground built and finished
[2:35:27] somebody said you say the coming of the
[2:35:29] lord is die in hand and near the door it
[2:35:31] is
[2:35:32] but i want you to know it's not going to
[2:35:34] come and it's not going to happen until
[2:35:36] everything that god has said would do
[2:35:39] would be
[2:35:42] if it was really him
[2:35:45] then he is obligated
[2:35:48] to bring it to pass
[2:35:50] with the people who will cooperate with
[2:35:52] him
[2:35:54] somebody said i don't know anything else
[2:35:56] to do here it is
[2:35:57] he wants you to come to church
[2:35:59] and worship him and be happy
[2:36:02] and satisfy if you're not satisfied you
[2:36:05] need to get
[2:36:06] satisfied giving praise and honor and
[2:36:09] glory and wisdom and mind and power to
[2:36:11] god he wants you to do that why don't
[2:36:12] you go visit
[2:36:20] why don't you go visit visit some other
[2:36:22] churches
[2:36:26] do i sound mad do i look mad won't you
[2:36:28] go visit
[2:36:29] won't you start next sunday
[2:36:34] go visit there's all kinds of churches
[2:36:38] all kinds of labors
[2:36:41] if you don't have to have the message of
[2:36:42] the hour
[2:36:43] if you don't have to have a church
[2:36:45] that's built around the ministry that
[2:36:46] god gave one generation ago
[2:36:49] then you've got plenty of choices
[2:36:52] if you want a churches built around that
[2:36:53] ministry you're going to have to drive a
[2:36:54] little bit but that's okay because
[2:36:56] brother reed does
[2:36:58] and that's all right because the mikos
[2:37:00] do
[2:37:02] and that's all right because some of us
[2:37:04] did
[2:37:06] it's all right when you make up your
[2:37:08] mind the truth the truth the truth the
[2:37:09] truth the truth
[2:37:11] how many years did brother benny west
[2:37:13] and and sister jeannette their family
[2:37:15] would say to them why in the world
[2:37:18] do you drive all the way from huntsville
[2:37:21] you pass hundreds of churches
[2:37:25] why do you feel like you why do you feel
[2:37:27] like you have to go you just know when

[2:37:55] but when i got in the presence of the
[2:37:57] lord

[2:39:33] their don't you think i know
[2:39:37] that that person no longer looks like

[2:42:15] he said there's three curtains we better
[2:42:16] remember
[2:42:19] he said we better watch these three
[2:42:20] curtains
[2:42:22] the iron curtain the bamboo curtain but
[2:42:24] it's the purple curtain
[2:42:27] that people better really watch
[2:42:30] it's instead of communism
[2:42:32] and some of these other things he said
[2:42:34] it's romanism
[2:42:38] serious
[2:42:40] churches every day i'm closing
[2:42:43] church is every day becoming more and
[2:42:44] more like a church that they they claim
[2:42:46] we've protested we've come out from
[2:42:48] under that we we're no longer walking in
[2:42:50] the in the doctrines and creeds and
[2:42:52] credences of the of the of the roman
[2:42:55] church and yet denominations are getting
[2:42:57] more and more and more and more and more
[2:42:58] and more and more like the roman church
[2:43:00] every day
[2:43:01] but you don't have to do that because
[2:43:03] you heard a message
[2:43:04] you had a clarion call you heard an
[2:43:07] eagle scream
[2:43:09] years ago
[2:43:10] that said come out of her come out of
[2:43:13] her
[2:43:15] come out of her my people
[2:43:17] do not be partakers with her inner sins
[2:43:20] you heard it you heard it
[2:43:23] anybody with me
[2:43:25] let's have the musicians
[2:43:28] hallelujah
[2:43:32] joy is a weapon
[2:43:35] it can be a spiritual
[2:43:38] weapon
[2:43:39] to see walls
[2:43:41] come down in your life why'd they shout
[2:43:45] why'd they blow the trumpets
[2:43:47] because they were told to
[2:43:50] simply because they trusted the word of
[2:43:54] the lord
[2:43:56] you need a prophet
[2:43:58] that you can have confidence in
[2:44:01] you need a pastor
[2:44:04] that you can have confidence in we need
[2:44:07] apostles
[2:44:09] that we can have confidence in teachers
[2:44:12] and evangelists
[2:44:13] that we can have confidence in
[2:44:16] amen
[2:44:17] because if we don't
[2:44:20] then we are never coming to a place of
[2:44:22] really feeling at ease
[2:44:25] and when i say at ease i mean at peace
[2:44:28] i don't mean in slackness
[2:44:31] i mean we gotta know
[2:44:33] once you know once you know
[2:44:38] you can't hardly wait
[2:44:41] to get back in that atmosphere
[2:44:45] we recognize that services are not the
[2:44:47] same
[2:44:49] some are more glorious it seems than
[2:44:51] others we need them all
[2:44:53] we need them all
[2:44:55] we need victories
[2:44:57] and we need those low solemn
[2:45:00] moments of sanctity and sacredness among
[2:45:03] us we need that we need that we need
[2:45:05] services where everyone's crying
[2:45:08] we need services where everyone's
[2:45:10] dancing every service is not the same
[2:45:12] but once you know once you know once you
[2:45:14] know once you know that you have found
[2:45:16] what your heart is looking for
[2:45:18] then you have an obligation to put
[2:45:20] everything you've got behind that
[2:45:24] it's just right
[2:45:26] and start you somebody said how in the
[2:45:28] world will i do it how will i ever fight
[2:45:29] my way out one way is to make up your
[2:45:32] mind to find the joy of the lord
[2:45:34] bubbling in your life again
[2:45:36] somebody said it seems to me like you're
[2:45:37] hanging all the joy on the motion well
[2:45:40] here's the one thing i found about joy
[2:45:42] joy needs an expression
[2:45:44] [Music]
[2:45:47] you want to explode
[2:45:49] you want to explode you want to be you
[2:45:51] want to make a mess in here you want to
[2:45:53] lock the joy up
[2:45:56] that's supposed to be funny you can
[2:45:57] smile now
[2:45:59] you want to lock it up you want to hold
[2:46:01] it back
[2:46:02] [Applause]
[2:46:03] you want to quench the spirit
[2:46:06] or do you want to let the spirit of god
[2:46:08] move in you and through you and
[2:46:12] joy is not a luxury
[2:46:15] joy of the lord is not optional
[2:46:18] somebody said well sometimes you have
[2:46:19] the joy and sometimes you don't we're
[2:46:21] not talking about your feeling we're
[2:46:22] talking about the joy of the lord
[2:46:24] the joy of the lord don't come and go
[2:46:26] the joy of the lord abides as long as
[2:46:28] you're abiding in him the joy of the
[2:46:30] lord is abiding in you joy is a
[2:46:34] continual demonstration
[2:46:36] of our full and complete trust
[2:46:40] in the lord jesus christ
[2:46:47] i was supposed to be
[2:46:49] further over here
[2:46:52] and i wanted to talk about getting your
[2:46:54] joy back
[2:46:56] but i'll say that for another time
[2:46:59] the last thing i'm going to share with
[2:47:00] you is from a message possessing all
[2:47:02] things
[2:47:03] paragraph
[2:47:04] 100.
[2:47:06] someone is talking to brother branham
[2:47:08] they said brother branham i wish i had
[2:47:09] joy
[2:47:10] you can have it
[2:47:14] you can have it
[2:47:16] you're just letting satan rob you
[2:47:19] from the privileges that christ died for
[2:47:23] now i tell you i read this to you a few
[2:47:25] weeks ago
[2:47:26] i'm reading it to you again and it stirs
[2:47:28] the same human emotion in me that it
[2:47:30] stirred the first time i read it it
[2:47:31] makes me mad
[2:47:33] it makes me mad it makes me mad at the
[2:47:35] devil
[2:47:37] to think that he can sneak into your
[2:47:40] life and rob you of the privileges that
[2:47:42] he didn't do anything to get to you
[2:47:45] what a
[2:47:46] thief
[2:47:48] what a dirty rotten lowdown accuser
[2:47:51] destroyer
[2:47:54] a thief
[2:47:56] rob you from the privileges that christ
[2:47:58] died for he said i'm an heir to it it's
[2:48:01] all mine everything he died for belongs
[2:48:04] to me belongs to you we're his children
[2:48:07] we're heirs of it
[2:48:09] everything that he died for would you
[2:48:13] stand with me everything he died for his
[2:48:15] mind would you say that everything he
[2:48:18] died for is mine
[2:48:21] say it again everything he died for
[2:48:25] is mind
[2:48:28] his mind
[2:48:31] it's mine
[2:48:33] it's mine we're ready to worship
[2:48:35] it's mine
[2:48:38] it's mine
[2:48:40] now what would it be what will it be
[2:48:42] folks
[2:48:44] what will it be
[2:48:47] are you willing to fight for your joy
[2:48:49] are you willing to fight for your peace
[2:48:52] are you willing to press your way in
[2:48:56] until you come to a place of faith where
[2:48:58] you say to the enemy no more
[2:49:02] no more
[2:49:04] no more
[2:49:12] there's a gift of intercession
[2:49:15] in your life
[2:49:16] that gets damned up
[2:49:19] it doesn't mind
[2:49:21] it does in every intercessor's life the
[2:49:23] enemy comes
[2:49:25] to dam up that intercession sometimes
[2:49:28] i'm not just talking about woodward in
[2:49:30] our prayer life
[2:49:31] because i find it's much easier to pray
[2:49:33] and intercede when i'm by myself
[2:49:36] than in the house of the lord
[2:49:38] but i look back there some some of the
[2:49:40] things that was moving and i saw it
[2:49:42] jennifer and i saw
[2:49:44] a bearabeth and i thought about the
[2:49:46] times
[2:49:49] in their younger years
[2:49:51] when god would move so mightily on them
[2:49:54] i thought of angela
[2:49:57] how god would move so mighty all these
[2:49:59] thoughts this morning since i've been
[2:50:00] here god would move so mightily on them
[2:50:03] and they would intercede and travail and
[2:50:06] god would honor that he would honor that
[2:50:08] and the atmosphere would shift and
[2:50:13] life happens
[2:50:16] stuff comes along and
[2:50:18] maybe we still can find victory at home
[2:50:21] maybe we still are pressing in to these
[2:50:23] places of intercession when we're away
[2:50:26] but how many of you know there are gifts
[2:50:28] for us
[2:50:29] and there are gifts for the body
[2:50:33] and god wants you to bring your gift
[2:50:34] with you when you come
[2:50:36] and he wants you to hold it out to him
[2:50:39] every sunday morning 10 minutes until
[2:50:41] church time we meet in the back to pray
[2:50:45] and every sunday we pray whatever's in
[2:50:47] our hearts but every sunday we say at
[2:50:49] least this
[2:50:51] lord every gift
[2:50:54] in this room you gave it
[2:50:56] and now we bring them back to you
[2:50:59] [Music]
[2:51:01] every time i say that i think of the
[2:51:03] accident and i think of when brother
[2:51:05] billy paul got to the car wreck and he
[2:51:07] said to brother branham daddy speak the
[2:51:09] word
[2:51:12] brother branham turned his head
[2:51:14] because he knew that the gift that god
[2:51:16] had given him was not his own
[2:51:19] it was a gift for the people
[2:51:22] most of the gifts that we carry in our
[2:51:23] life are gifts that we can bring into
[2:51:26] his presence and say lord use it's not
[2:51:29] really mine it it's mine because you
[2:51:31] released it to me but it's not mine to
[2:51:33] use however i want to use it it's mine
[2:51:36] to be used in the service of the lord so
[2:51:38] we pray over the musicians
[2:51:41] and the singers and those who have a
[2:51:43] part oh god use these gifts
[2:51:48] pour your oil on them
[2:51:56] the bible tells us that these prophetic
[2:51:58] things and things that god does in our
[2:52:00] life this way are not for private
[2:52:02] interpretation
[2:52:05] they're to be used for the benefit
[2:52:07] and the growth of the body of christ
[2:52:10] so if you recognize this morning that
[2:52:12] there is a gifting in your life that is
[2:52:15] not being not being exercised in the
[2:52:17] presence of the lord when he begins to
[2:52:19] move now we can't all prophesy at the
[2:52:21] same time
[2:52:23] we can't all speak out at the same time
[2:52:26] we can't all draw the attention in our
[2:52:28] direction at the same time there has to
[2:52:30] be an order
[2:52:33] when you're standing here and you know
[2:52:35] that you've got something fresh
[2:52:38] not the same thing that you say over and
[2:52:41] over and over again
[2:52:42] but you've got something fresh
[2:52:44] the lord is moving on you and you want
[2:52:46] to release that you need to do that
[2:52:51] because that moment can't be regained
[2:52:55] it can't be captured again
[2:52:59] if you feel like the lord is telling you
[2:53:00] to go and pray for someone i don't care
[2:53:03] if they reject you
[2:53:06] i don't care if they get stiff as a
[2:53:09] board
[2:53:11] and will not allow the spirit of god to
[2:53:14] begin to break and crack that shell they
[2:53:16] live under you obey the lord
[2:53:19] then it's off of you
[2:53:23] you have no more responsibility in that
[2:53:26] except to keep praying that god's
[2:53:28] perfect will would be done in that
[2:53:30] precious life
[2:53:31] but don't you go out of here dejected
[2:53:34] you go out of here knowing that god has
[2:53:36] a sovereign time and a sovereign way he
[2:53:39] will not force you against your will not
[2:53:42] yet in this hour
[2:53:45] not yet in this hour
[2:53:47] but i feel that the hour is coming
[2:53:50] when if we reject the easy way out
[2:53:52] we'll come out the hard way but we're
[2:53:55] coming out
[2:53:56] we're coming out because he loves us and
[2:53:59] he's going to bring us out
[2:54:01] don't you be damned up i know i know
[2:54:03] that sometimes the enemy will work on
[2:54:06] your mind and don't you do that you just
[2:54:08] make up your mind
[2:54:10] let me tell you something praising the
[2:54:11] lord and and being an example to others
[2:54:14] in praise that's a gift
[2:54:20] when some of you press your way up here
[2:54:24] there's a determination about your
[2:54:25] movement
[2:54:27] that lets me know you're not doing it to
[2:54:28] be seen
[2:54:31] you're not doing it to be seen
[2:54:33] you're doing it to draw up under his
[2:54:34] hand to get right up under his presence
[2:54:37] and i tell you it breathes life into an
[2:54:40] atmosphere
[2:54:41] and when there's a distracted atmosphere
[2:54:44] just sometimes that unified movement and
[2:54:46] everyone kind of moving together
[2:54:48] in the spirit one mind one accord this
[2:54:51] is why i'm preaching the way i'm
[2:54:53] preaching today is the power of coming
[2:54:55] together
[2:54:56] with a vision and a goal to see the
[2:54:59] atmosphere raised to the highest
[2:55:01] possible
[2:55:02] level so that jesus can walk among us
[2:55:05] and do anything and everything that he
[2:55:07] wants us to do wants to do among us kill
[2:55:09] every cancer cell and deliver every
[2:55:12] person
[2:55:13] this is what we're after
[2:55:15] we're not here for entertaining
[2:55:18] now let god use you because you're a
[2:55:20] part of his plan
[2:55:22] you're a part of his program
[2:55:24] let's worship the lord this morning none
[2:55:26] of this has gone the way i planned and
[2:55:29] i'm just going to say bless his name

[3:08:32] [Music]
[3:08:46] victory
[3:08:49] [Music]
[3:08:56] i want you to listen very carefully
[3:08:59] we have a sweet little baby to dedicate
[3:09:01] this morning and
[3:09:04] i was trying to
[3:09:06] reserve time for something else as well
[3:09:10] i want you to bow your head just a
[3:09:12] moment
[3:09:17] i felt like when i woke up this morning
[3:09:19] i was supposed to offer prayer
[3:09:23] and that's the reason i wanted to save
[3:09:25] my strength
[3:09:27] i didn't quite
[3:09:29] succeed
[3:09:30] [Music]
[3:09:32] i don't want to pray
[3:09:34] for those of you that we pray for every
[3:09:36] week
[3:09:37] and i don't want you to be offended at
[3:09:38] my saying that
[3:09:40] [Music]
[3:09:42] i want to reserve the strength that i
[3:09:45] have
[3:09:48] for someone that may be here today and
[3:09:50] you may say in your mind i
[3:09:52] must
[3:09:56] break out of my tomb
[3:09:58] [Music]
[3:10:01] i feel quite boxed in
[3:10:05] and i'm desperate
[3:10:08] to be free
[3:10:10] and i'm so willing
[3:10:12] to lay aside everything else
[3:10:17] to get that freedom
[3:10:19] to find that release
[3:10:22] that relief
[3:10:25] and i want to be prayed for this morning
[3:10:28] if you just slip up your hand
[3:10:37] is there anyone else
[3:10:43] all right i want those of you who raised
[3:10:45] your hand to step forward
[3:10:48] those of you who didn't step back just a
[3:10:49] little bit
[3:10:52] i love every one of you i do
[3:10:56] and i want to pray for you and if i get
[3:10:58] an energy if the anointing falls and i
[3:11:00] find strength in my body i'll do it
[3:11:07] [Music]
[3:11:10] this has been a
[3:11:11] very unusual week i had
[3:11:14] some sort of reaction to the anesthesia
[3:11:18] and i've been fighting my way back i'm
[3:11:20] so thankful for the grace of god
[3:11:23] his strength here this morning
[3:11:26] that's one two three four brother david
[3:11:29] five six brother reid is six one two
[3:11:31] three four five six
[3:11:33] are there
[3:11:35] i want to others who you are now
[3:11:39] all right
[3:11:42] i want this body to gather around these
[3:11:45] because
[3:11:46] the way it was laid in my heart
[3:11:48] god would meet he will meet these
[3:11:53] you may not see any physical
[3:11:55] reaction i don't know what what will
[3:11:58] happen what you'll see
[3:12:00] but i just felt like in my heart this
[3:12:02] morning when i woke up that i would make
[3:12:04] a call like that and that god would meet
[3:12:06] these
[3:12:07] in a profound way and i believe he can
[3:12:09] meet you
[3:12:10] this is not to put it in my hands
[3:12:14] he can meet you you don't need me
[3:12:16] for that
[3:12:18] so if i sounded like i thought you did
[3:12:21] pardon me forgive me that was not what i
[3:12:23] meant
[3:12:26] but when i woke up this morning he was
[3:12:27] talking to me about the easy way and the
[3:12:30] hard way
[3:12:33] and i believe
[3:12:34] there are those who are being given a
[3:12:37] choice a chance an opportunity you can
[3:12:39] have deliverance the easy way and that's
[3:12:41] come and be prayed for and believe god
[3:12:43] with all your heart or you can have it
[3:12:45] the hard way and i'm telling you church
[3:12:47] somebody ought to listen
[3:12:51] somebody ought to listen
[3:12:53] somebody said i just don't believe god
[3:12:55] works that way it doesn't matter what
[3:12:56] you
[3:12:57] that doesn't matter read the book
[3:12:59] [Music]
[3:13:01] read the bible
[3:13:06] he does
[3:13:08] he has a god
[3:13:09] ordained
[3:13:11] way
[3:13:13] if you don't come that way you're gonna
[3:13:15] come
[3:13:17] but it's not always pleasant
[3:13:19] and you see he sees the heart we know
[3:13:22] impart we think in part we see in part
[3:13:25] but he knows the heart
[3:13:29] god took me back this morning as i was
[3:13:31] laying there in bed to a time in 1997
[3:13:34] when this church had a terrible split
[3:13:39] my nerves were bad and i thought i was
[3:13:41] losing my mind
[3:13:43] and brother greeley
[3:13:46] was so faithful and
[3:13:48] so instrumental
[3:13:52] god powerfully used him in that
[3:13:55] dark period
[3:13:57] there was a spirit that come against the
[3:13:59] body
[3:14:01] and it started on a woman
[3:14:03] [Music]
[3:14:06] happened to be somebody i deeply cared
[3:14:08] about and deeply loved
[3:14:11] she couldn't seem to help herself
[3:14:14] it just started tormenting her because
[3:14:17] she realized that as the church was
[3:14:19] growing
[3:14:21] she was losing some control some
[3:14:24] influence
[3:14:28] it was such a sad thing
[3:14:33] her son said to me one day i'm going to
[3:14:35] tell you exactly because
[3:14:37] he knew how god had been dealing with my
[3:14:39] heart
[3:14:41] he said i'm going to tell you exactly
[3:14:42] how this is going to play out
[3:14:46] that spirit that's on her
[3:14:48] if she doesn't get help
[3:14:51] it's not going to be satisfied until it
[3:14:54] gets my daddy stirred up
[3:14:57] and when it gets my daddy stirred up
[3:14:59] that's it
[3:15:02] if she can get the help she needs
[3:15:05] we might see an end to this
[3:15:08] but if she doesn't get out from under
[3:15:10] that thing while there's a ch an
[3:15:12] opportunity it'll get on him and that'll
[3:15:13] be the end of it he'll do everything he
[3:15:15] can to destroy i've seen this happen
[3:15:19] and that blew my mind
[3:15:22] i couldn't even imagine that that was
[3:15:24] possible
[3:15:27] but that young man was right
[3:15:30] that's exactly how that thing did
[3:15:33] she couldn't get out from under it she
[3:15:35] was offered prayer it only strengthened
[3:15:38] her stand
[3:15:40] it made her feel more justified
[3:15:44] instead of more humble
[3:15:46] precious woman
[3:15:49] and it didn't stop until it got him all
[3:15:52] stirred up
[3:15:53] and there was no stopping it then it was
[3:15:55] like a a snowball out of control
[3:15:59] no amount of praying or crying or
[3:16:00] carrying on that anybody did could stop
[3:16:03] that from unfolding and god spoke and he
[3:16:05] said didn't i tell you
[3:16:07] that the waters of separation would flow
[3:16:09] through this place and that i would do i
[3:16:11] would use it for my glory
[3:16:15] no no none of us who lived it would ever
[3:16:17] want to go back to a time like that but
[3:16:20] for some reason as i woke up this
[3:16:22] morning and god was speaking to me about
[3:16:23] the easy way and the more difficult way
[3:16:26] this is what came in my mind
[3:16:30] i watched how spirits operate and how
[3:16:32] they move from person to person and how
[3:16:34] they flow and
[3:16:36] and i i i just wish that everybody could
[3:16:39] see and discern
[3:16:41] but it's obvious that it's just not
[3:16:43] everybody's gift
[3:16:45] but i know that god
[3:16:48] can deliver
[3:16:52] he is a deliverer
[3:16:54] and he doesn't just want to take the
[3:16:56] surface off he wants to go right down to
[3:16:59] the root
[3:17:01] so that it's dug out
[3:17:04] and there's total freedom
[3:17:07] total freedom
[3:17:10] and so i knew this morning that i was to
[3:17:13] offer prayer for the desperate
[3:17:15] and that may have nothing to do with
[3:17:17] what i just said
[3:17:19] for for most of them
[3:17:22] but that was the reason why i offered
[3:17:24] prayer this way
[3:17:25] i want you to join with me now and i
[3:17:27] know it's late i just you know it
[3:17:28] doesn't matter
[3:17:30] it just doesn't matter at this point
[3:17:31] doesn't matter
[3:17:33] what matters to me is that those who
[3:17:35] have come
[3:17:36] making up their mind i'm in a tomb and i
[3:17:38] want to get out of the tomb i want them
[3:17:40] to be ministered to don't you i want
[3:17:42] them to be ministered to so i want the
[3:17:44] body to come and stand behind them
[3:17:45] brothers behind brothers and sisters
[3:17:47] upon sisters
[3:17:49] round sisters
[3:17:52] we're going to worship we're going to go
[3:17:53] right back into that song
[3:17:55] i don't know what these needs are i
[3:17:57] don't even want to stop to hear them
[3:17:59] it's not important for you to tell me
[3:18:01] what your tomb looks like
[3:18:02] but it is important that you let jesus
[3:18:04] bring you out of it amen
[3:18:06] you let him bring you out of it
[3:18:10] now i'm going to pray first for these
[3:18:12] six that came
[3:18:13] and we'll see what the lord will do
[3:18:15] remember you don't have to have my
[3:18:17] prayers
[3:18:19] it's not about that it's about you
[3:18:21] reaching out and touching him right now

[3:58:00] children here with the sweetest spirits
[3:58:06] i'm so thankful
[3:58:08] i know arielle is a
[3:58:10] little bit i don't think she's quiet
[3:58:12] when she's with her friends but
[3:58:14] you can say something turned she'll
[3:58:16] blush a little bit
[3:58:17] but i'm so thankful that the lord
[3:58:19] touched her i just looked up and she was
[3:58:21] singing
[3:58:22] she was just singing
[3:58:24] that's what it takes some time
[3:58:27] you just enter
[3:58:28] in and if these little babies in the
[3:58:32] arms if they live long enough and we're
[3:58:34] we're here long enough on this earth
[3:58:36] they'll all experience that same touch
[3:58:38] of his presence aren't we blessed
[3:58:41] to be able to show our children that
[3:58:43] there's a way to experience god
[3:58:45] it is by faith it's not by feeling
[3:58:48] but oh how wonderful it is to feel his
[3:58:51] presence
[3:58:52] god has been so good with all that has
[3:58:54] gone on the pandemic and
[3:58:57] all the changes in our world
[3:59:00] he has blessed rj and miss emily
[3:59:04] with a beautiful baby girl
[3:59:06] to go along with the handsome
[3:59:09] boy that god gave him
[3:59:12] a couple years back now
[3:59:15] we're going to
[3:59:16] pray over
[3:59:18] sophia
[3:59:20] we're going to have her dad to dedicate
[3:59:22] her back to the lord
[3:59:24] and we're gonna have the family to come
[3:59:26] now and i'm
[3:59:27] i'm kind of a wet mess but
[3:59:30] nobody cares
[3:59:31] i wish that was a little more put
[3:59:33] together for you
[3:59:33] [Music]
[3:59:38] all i've only been close to her
[3:59:41] once or twice since she was born to be
[3:59:43] able to see her
[3:59:46] i got to hold her
[3:59:49] she's just precious
[3:59:51] you know why because she's from god
[3:59:55] mom and daddy come together and they
[3:59:59] do their part and
[4:00:01] a little body is formed and
[4:00:04] but only jesus only god
[4:00:06] decides the inner spirit
[4:00:10] that goes into that little baby
[4:00:13] there's something that god gives them
[4:00:15] that we couldn't give them if we wanted
[4:00:17] to
[4:00:19] we just believe that god will
[4:00:21] unfold his perfect plan for her life
[4:00:25] he didn't just make her beautiful
[4:00:28] he put gifts in her
[4:00:32] merkava
[4:00:34] are you all going to say merkava or
[4:00:36] merkava
[4:00:39] i know that it's uh
[4:00:40] it's a hebrew word that can mean
[4:00:43] wheel
[4:00:45] it also means throne
[4:00:48] it's it's a descriptive hebrew word for
[4:00:50] the throne of god
[4:00:52] but i'm going to say a very non-feminine
[4:00:55] thing
[4:00:56] a very masculine thing
[4:00:58] the most success the most successful
[4:01:01] tanks
[4:01:03] in the israeli army
[4:01:05] are
[4:01:07] merkavas
[4:01:09] uh
[4:01:12] they were
[4:01:13] specially designed
[4:01:16] to be able to roll over anything
[4:01:21] they built this amazing tank and
[4:01:24] it was vulnerable on the bottom
[4:01:27] so they had to keep redesigning and
[4:01:28] redesigning and redesigning until they
[4:01:30] could come up with one
[4:01:32] that couldn't be penetrated
[4:01:34] from the top or the sides or the bottom
[4:01:38] so when i see her that's what i'm going
[4:01:40] to think
[4:01:41] i'm going to think of how the lord is
[4:01:43] fortifying her and protecting her
[4:01:48] she's already come through a little
[4:01:50] bout of sickness that could have been
[4:01:51] serious
[4:01:53] god's grace
[4:01:57] marvelous grace
[4:02:00] she came through it like a little
[4:02:02] champion
[4:02:04] aren't we blessed to have a part in this
[4:02:06] today
[4:02:10] is it all right if i hold her i don't
[4:02:12] even have a sniffle right now
[4:02:14] [Music]
[4:02:16] oh my
[4:02:18] oh my no more complaints about
[4:02:21] how light you felt
[4:02:23] you've been eating good now you feel
[4:02:25] about right
[4:02:27] you feel about right
[4:02:31] would you reach your hands toward this

[4:02:46] she is certainly a gift to them and a
[4:02:48] product

[4:02:54] but it was you who created her formed
[4:02:57] her in her mother's womb
[4:02:59] and it was you who allowed a spirit to
[4:03:03] enter into her little life
[4:03:06] the breath of god is what made her a
[4:03:08] living soul
[4:03:10] and lord you ordained and chose a name
[4:03:13] for her a gracious name
[4:03:17] an appropriate name

[4:03:23] she is strengthened
[4:03:25] she has an appointment at the throne

[4:03:32] blessing to fall upon her

[4:03:48] that there would be nothing of that that

[4:03:53] long-term effect
[4:03:56] that it would all be so far removed from
[4:03:59] her in the name of jesus that it would
[4:04:01] be as though she she never walked
[4:04:02] through it

[4:12:16] father i thank you so much
[4:12:19] for nathan and shoshanna
[4:12:22] they're a very important part of our
[4:12:24] lives and a part of this church and
[4:12:27] nathan has been for such a long time and
[4:12:30] you blessed him with the wife that you
[4:12:32] had made for him
[4:12:35] and you blessed her with a husband that
[4:12:37] you had made for her
[4:12:39] and we get to be a part of it
[4:12:42] we saw the pain in their life we saw the
[4:12:45] loss
[4:12:46] we saw the grief
[4:12:48] and now lord we have seen the joy
[4:12:52] like everything you you do there are
[4:12:55] complications along the way and
[4:12:58] these physical bodies sometimes have a
[4:13:00] hard time keeping up with the perfect
[4:13:02] plan of god
[4:13:04] there's so much working against the body
[4:13:06] in this hour physically
[4:13:08] but i thank you that you have brought
[4:13:10] our sister this far
[4:13:12] by the grace of god
[4:13:16] grace
[4:13:17] marvelous
[4:13:19] amazing grace
[4:13:21] we lay our hands over her now knowing
[4:13:24] that when you created this body
[4:13:28] you created it to give birth
[4:13:31] you made it thus it's a miracle
[4:13:34] it's your design
[4:13:37] it's not without pain it's not without
[4:13:40] complication
[4:13:42] she's known a lot of that
[4:13:44] but god you saw all of this
[4:13:47] from the very beginning
[4:13:49] you have not brought her this far to
[4:13:50] leave her now
[4:13:52] and she needs you more now lord in these
[4:13:54] last days
[4:13:56] even then she has to this point
[4:13:59] i ask you for the presence of god to be
[4:14:02] upon her now
[4:14:05] to shadow her over overshadow her
[4:14:09] wrap her surround her
[4:14:12] spiritually oh god breathe breath and
[4:14:15] life
[4:14:16] hope and strength
[4:14:19] and physically god

[4:14:25] her feet every cell
[4:14:27] every system every organ

[4:14:34] healing virtue of the lamb
[4:14:37] we thank you god for your divine
[4:14:40] presence that will be there when this
[4:14:41] little baby comes
[4:14:44] that it'll come with grace that you will
[4:14:46] be with the midwife and those who will
[4:14:48] assist you'll be with dad and you'll be
[4:14:51] with all the family members anxiously

[4:15:13] perfect healing and
[4:15:14] lots of that grace
[4:15:17] be on nathan lord
[4:15:19] i think it's the hardest thing that dad
[4:15:22] has to go through is knowing there's not
[4:15:24] much
[4:15:25] that he can do
[4:15:27] to see your wife going through that
[4:15:30] and love her so much and wish you could
[4:15:32] take it and wish you could bear it wish
[4:15:35] there was something else you could do
[4:15:38] lord just cover him in that moment
[4:15:41] let his complete faith and confidence be
[4:15:43] in you
[4:15:44] give him great wisdom lord and
[4:15:47] walking out the beauty of this thing
[4:15:50] we're all going to dance
[4:15:52] we're all going to rejoice
[4:15:54] when your perfect plan has unfolded in
[4:15:56] this little baby's life
[4:15:58] for the glory of god for the glory of
[4:16:00] god every detail yes having the midwife
[4:16:04] ready at the right time and knowing when
[4:16:06] to call and all those things
[4:16:08] that can stress you out

[4:16:11] give it to god in peace may she walk in
[4:16:14] perfect peace
[4:16:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ yes
