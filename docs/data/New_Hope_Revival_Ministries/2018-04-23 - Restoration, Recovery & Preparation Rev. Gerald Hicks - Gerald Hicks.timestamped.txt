[1:53] and I'm so very happy to have brother
[1:56] Gerald Hicks
[1:57] in our last time together he shared his
[2:01] wonderful testimony I'm telling you it
[2:05] I just felt emotional from the beginning
[2:07] to the end and I had heard bits and
[2:10] pieces of it personally but to hear him
[2:14] share it again was such a blessing to me
[2:16] to be reminded of the faithfulness of
[2:19] God and to be reminded how that God
[2:22] works through all of our circumstances
[2:26] he is working a beautiful work in our
[2:29] lives to bring us into the fullness of
[2:32] our destiny his calling upon our lives
[2:35] and I know that many of you were
[2:37] encouraged by the testimony and we just
[2:40] want to say to brother Hicks welcome
[2:42] again we're very glad to have you on the
[2:44] program today
[2:45] pastor Shelly I'm so honored to be here
[2:47] today I'm very excited about what God is
[2:50] doing in this present hour you know we
[2:53] talked about your life and your family
[2:56] and your beginnings but we didn't take
[2:59] an opportunity in the last program to
[3:01] mention your wife and children will you
[3:03] tell us a little bit about your
[3:04] Emily yes I am very honored to have a
[3:08] lovely wife of 25 years 25 years and the
[3:11] Lord has blessed us with two beautiful
[3:14] children we have a nineteen or excuse me
[3:17] we have a 22 year old daughter her name
[3:20] is Katie Katie and we have a 20 year old
[3:23] son and his name is Cal of course my
[3:26] wife's name is Annette and she is the
[3:29] love of my life and of the Lord has
[3:32] blessed us and been so kind to us all
[3:34] through the years I don't think I've
[3:36] ever asked you how you omit how did you
[3:38] meet your wife well we met at church of
[3:40] course what better place to find a wife
[3:43] that's right and we we met at church I
[3:47] was preaching revival in the church
[3:49] where she was attending and I just knew
[3:53] from the moment that I saw her that she
[3:55] was the one the Lord had for me and did
[3:58] she have a similar feeling well I'm not
[4:00] sure if she's got that similar feeling
[4:02] at that moment but I was certainly able
[4:05] to convince all very good that that's a
[4:07] fair answer to a personal question
[4:10] really wasn't it you know you were
[4:12] ministering in our church last night and
[4:14] it was so powerful we had just gotten
[4:17] back from a trip about 30 minutes before
[4:19] the service so I was physically worn out
[4:21] but by the time the service was over I
[4:24] was so lifted up and so encouraged and
[4:26] so reminded I like how how God confirms
[4:30] you know we hear the word layer upon
[4:33] layer and and then God sends a word of
[4:36] confirmation and I love the time before
[4:39] when you were here some of the things
[4:41] you brought were things that we had just
[4:43] been speaking in the church and you know
[4:45] that's a pastors delight and an
[4:47] evangelist comes along and strengthens
[4:49] and then you took us to another level
[4:51] and and I appreciated it so much you
[4:54] told us about an experience that you had
[4:57] had in prayer where the weighty glory of
[5:00] the Lord had come upon you and I'd like
[5:02] for you to share that and then you also
[5:05] shared with us three points that were
[5:07] given to you related to that experience
[5:10] and I mean I know that really that
[5:13] that sermon could have it could have
[5:16] been a series I mean you could have
[5:18] carried that for weeks and weeks stayed
[5:20] right on own subject just expanded it
[5:22] and expanded it because it was so full
[5:25] of truth would you share that experience
[5:27] with us I mean I know it's supernatural
[5:30] but we have some people out there who'd
[5:33] and who believe in the supernatural so
[5:34] just take your liberty and and share
[5:37] that if you will and then we want to
[5:38] know the three points and how that
[5:40] relates to where we are in 2018
[5:42] absolutely it was just it was just
[5:46] before Thanksgiving last year I was in a
[5:49] tent revival in Florida and one morning
[5:53] I had been talking to the Lord I had
[5:56] just been feeling after the Lord you
[5:58] might say and I had stepped up under the
[6:00] tent and I had just decided that I was
[6:03] going to spend some time in the presence
[6:06] of the Lord and as I began to walk back
[6:09] and forth across the tent just just
[6:12] talking to the Lord and feeling after
[6:14] him it was early in the morning it was
[6:16] very still outside the curtains were
[6:19] down no one knew that I was under the
[6:21] tent and after being there just a few
[6:25] moments there was a wind that literally
[6:28] blew up underneath the tent and as that
[6:32] wind blew up under the tent immediately
[6:34] there was a very weighty presence of God
[6:39] that came into the tent and it just
[6:42] settled down upon me in such a way that
[6:44] the presence of the Lord just started
[6:46] pressing me toward the ground and as I
[6:50] was I was there in that weighty presence
[6:53] of God the Lord spoke in my ear and the
[6:57] voice of the Lord said the heavens are
[7:00] now open my mind
[7:02] above this tent Wow the heavens are now
[7:04] open above this tent and so I certainly
[7:08] received that from the Lord and as
[7:11] affirmation of receiving that I
[7:14] immediately began to release with my
[7:17] mouth words of faith in me and words of
[7:21] deliverance into the atmosphere I just
[7:24] began to use the words
[7:26] mouth to speak faith and speak
[7:28] deliverance into the atmosphere not just
[7:32] concerning that tent revival but
[7:34] concerning the lives of everyone around
[7:37] and not just for that time but for a
[7:40] future time as well right and so as I
[7:44] began to to just just think about that
[7:48] experience I began to see the miraculous
[7:51] start to unfold almost immediately in
[7:54] just a few few moments the presence of
[7:58] the God of the Lord again was so real
[8:00] that night in the service we witnessed a
[8:03] miraculous healing grace all throughout
[8:06] that meeting from that service to the
[8:09] very end of the meeting every night
[8:11] there was something miraculous that
[8:13] would take place and even from that time
[8:17] to present I have witnessed numerous
[8:20] miracles and I certainly feel like that
[8:23] it is a result of the heavens being
[8:26] opened of Krays God there have been
[8:28] times when we served that I worshiped
[8:31] and we labored under a closed heaven
[8:34] right and yes we do see God move even
[8:37] when the heaven is closed but how much
[8:39] greater we see God move when the heavens
[8:42] are open absolutely praise God and so it
[8:44] is that the Lord just just began to make
[8:48] that even more and more real to me and
[8:50] so when the meeting closed and I made my
[8:53] way back home to Arkansas I went into my
[8:56] prayer room and as I was there in my
[8:59] prayer room seeking the Lord and again
[9:02] just spending time with God it was there
[9:06] in another season of prayer that the
[9:08] voice of the Lord would speak to me
[9:09] again and this time he said to me that
[9:13] as the old year was coming to a close
[9:15] and the new year was now upon us that
[9:19] the church was turning the corner into
[9:21] the third day well and as he spoke that
[9:24] to me he said that it was going to be a
[9:26] time of restoration a time of recovery
[9:30] and a time of preparation and so for
[9:35] quite some time I just stayed in the
[9:36] presence of God and I tried to
[9:39] Zorba's actly what God was saying not
[9:43] just for that moment but also for the
[9:46] days and the weeks and the months that
[9:49] lie ahead should God Terry and I
[9:52] certainly believe that as we closed out
[9:55] 2017 and we entered into 2018 I have
[9:59] certainly been able to witness
[10:02] restoration recovery and preparation on
[10:06] many levels for many different people in
[10:09] the kingdom of God that's very
[10:11] interesting will you take us to your
[10:13] text
[10:14] can we just read a little portion of
[10:15] that scripture that you read to us from
[10:18] was it second Samuel absolutely all
[10:20] right let's look at that just a moment
[10:22] because I think the I think the way you
[10:24] took those three phrases and related
[10:27] them to the verse of scripture was very
[10:29] very powerful and I believe the people
[10:31] would appreciate hearing that absolutely
[10:33] it's a beautiful passage it's in 1st
[10:36] Samuel or Samuel chapter number 30 a
[10:40] beautiful Old Testament story and the
[10:44] scripture said verse number 1 and it
[10:45] came to pass when David and his men were
[10:48] come to Ziklag
[10:49] on the third day mmm that the Amalekites
[10:52] had invaded the south and zig leg and
[10:56] smitten zig leg and burned it with fire
[10:59] now I have read this particular passage
[11:02] on a number of different times through
[11:04] the years I've read it in a casual way
[11:07] just reading the word of the Lord right
[11:10] I've also pulled from this other other
[11:14] messages and used this particular story
[11:17] in times past but never have I noticed
[11:21] until this experience that the scripture
[11:24] said that he came to zig lag on the
[11:27] third day now we understand that the
[11:30] third day would represent resurrection
[11:32] right we would understand that that's
[11:34] new life we would understand that up you
[11:37] know that's just simply saying that
[11:39] there is going to be a resurrection
[11:41] there is going to be a coming forth yes
[11:43] yes you might say and so I certainly
[11:46] believe that we are in an hour when the
[11:49] church is truly coming forth
[11:52] Alleluia god I believe that
[11:53] we certainly are arriving at a moment
[11:56] when we are going to experience a
[11:58] resurrection in the spirit realm that
[12:01] we've never experienced before Ray's
[12:03] gone I believe there are some gifts I
[12:05] believe there are some callings I
[12:07] believe there are some experiences that
[12:10] are going to be resurrected in the
[12:11] hearts and lives and the spirits of
[12:14] individuals I believe they're Upendra
[12:16] that are listening to us right now man
[12:18] who have gifts and callings that are
[12:21] lying dormant in their life and now that
[12:24] the heaven is opened these things are
[12:26] going to literally be resurrected in
[12:28] them and I believe that God has
[12:30] strategic voices such as yours that's
[12:33] going to literally call these gifts
[12:35] forth I mean that's gonna literally call
[12:38] these experiences forth in our hearts
[12:41] and lives hallelujah that is so powerful
[12:43] so powerful Reed own brother
[12:46] and so the scripture said and had taken
[12:48] the women captive that were therein and
[12:51] slew not any either great or small but
[12:54] carried them away and went on their way
[12:56] so David and his men came to the city
[12:59] verse 3 and behold it was burned with
[13:02] fire and their wives and their sons and
[13:06] their daughters were taken captive
[13:08] notice verse 4 then David and the people
[13:12] that were with him lifted up their voice
[13:16] and wept until they had no more power to
[13:21] weep how many people listening to our
[13:25] voice today yes have been in that same
[13:28] situation I wonder who it is mm-hmm that
[13:32] might possibly be there right now right
[13:34] that they've wept until there's no more
[13:37] strength to weep right how many people
[13:40] are there right now that they've shed
[13:42] tears until until there are no more
[13:44] tears to be shed they've prayed until
[13:47] they feel like there's no more prayers
[13:49] to be prayed there's no more words to be
[13:52] said how many times as servants of God
[13:55] we exhaust ourselves in the spirit yes
[13:59] trying to feel after God pouring ourself
[14:02] out to the Lord until we feel like
[14:04] there's no
[14:05] than laugh he-man and David was there
[14:07] David's men were there they were grieved
[14:10] and the reason they were grieved was not
[14:13] because they believed or they were
[14:16] weeping not because they believed that
[14:18] God was going to miraculously give them
[14:21] back or return to them or adventure
[14:25] weeping because they believed that their
[14:28] wives and children were missing and
[14:31] presumed dead they were weeping because
[14:33] everything they loved everything that
[14:36] was important to them was now destroyed
[14:39] by the city they called their own was
[14:42] now the smoldering ruins of what used to
[14:46] be how many people look at their life
[14:49] and that's exactly the way they feel yes
[14:51] sir that it's the smoldering ruins of
[14:54] what used to be and what do they do they
[14:57] lift up their voice and weep right they
[15:00] weep in disappointment they weep because
[15:03] of despair they weep because the pain
[15:06] seems to be unbearable however God does
[15:10] not want us to weep because of pain and
[15:13] despair and because the situation is
[15:16] devastating but understand God wants to
[15:19] bring about restoration he wants to
[15:22] bring about true recovery in our hearts
[15:25] and in our lives somehow David
[15:28] understood that as dark as this
[15:31] situation may be right now the God that
[15:34] I serve is thing and the same God that
[15:38] delivered me out of the mouth of the
[15:40] lion yes and the same God that delivered
[15:42] me out of the pall of the bear the same
[15:45] God that delivered the uncircumcised
[15:47] Philistine giant they called a champion
[15:51] huh into my hand is the same God it's
[15:55] gonna make away is this very unfortunate
[15:58] situation
[15:59] amen amen so David had hope absolutely
[16:02] absolutely and the thing is David truly
[16:05] wanted the men around him to have as
[16:08] much hope as he however at this
[16:11] particular time they were so overcome by
[16:13] the present plight of Ziklag
[16:16] and the absence of their wives and
[16:19] children and the fact that everything
[16:22] they loved was now destroyed their anger
[16:25] became displaced and after they grieved
[16:28] they became angry and they pointed their
[16:31] finger at their leader the one they
[16:33] should have loved the most because David
[16:36] loved them more than anyone else loved
[16:39] them oh yes he invested in them when no
[16:42] one else wanted to invest I am right he
[16:44] wrapped his arms around them he embraced
[16:47] them he invited them into his inner
[16:50] circle when everyone else wanted to
[16:52] discard them except and throw them away
[16:54] and now rather than rallying around
[16:58] David rather than holding his hands up
[17:01] and saying as difficult and as horrible
[17:04] as this is we're gonna get through it
[17:06] together they wanted to stone him Wow
[17:09] they wanted to stone him but the Bible
[17:12] lets us know that David did something
[17:14] that was amazing the scripture tells us
[17:17] as David was greatly distressed verse
[17:20] number 6 for the people spake of stoning
[17:23] him because all the soul of the people
[17:26] was grieved right every man for his sons
[17:30] and for his daughters but David notice
[17:34] he encouraged himself in the Lord his
[17:38] God no preacher encouraged him no
[17:41] preacher to encourage him no friend to
[17:44] pat him on the back no comrade to call
[17:46] him and tell him everything's gonna be
[17:49] all right David had to reach deep within
[17:51] Alleluia and he had to pull from the
[17:53] resources of his own soul and rezoned
[17:56] and encouraged himself in the Lord
[17:59] somebody said how could David do that
[18:01] just exactly what did he do and perhaps
[18:04] maybe it is they've come you need to
[18:07] encourage yourself in the law and one of
[18:09] the ways that we can do that another
[18:12] writer in the New Testament would say I
[18:14] think myself happy hmm
[18:17] hallelujah I believe myself happy see at
[18:20] the end of the day it's right our life
[18:23] is always going to travel in the
[18:26] direction of our thoughts Alleva
[18:28] praise God that's why it's
[18:30] very important as Christians as children
[18:34] of God as servants of God that we always
[18:37] keep our thought life as positive and as
[18:41] hopeful as possible so true David look
[18:44] beyond what his physical eyes saw at
[18:48] that very moment and he began to think
[18:51] about a God who had been faithful to him
[18:54] over and over time and again he began to
[18:58] think about a God who had always come
[19:01] through a gob that had always been there
[19:03] for him no matter how difficult it might
[19:07] have been and as he started thinking
[19:09] about that encouragement started coming
[19:12] to him perhaps it is that David thought
[19:15] about how God delivered him out of the
[19:18] mouth of a hungry lion perhaps it is
[19:21] that he remembered how he felt when God
[19:24] delivered him out of the pall of an
[19:26] angry bear or maybe it is that David
[19:29] remembered how he felt when he stopped
[19:32] at the bottom of that Valley by that
[19:35] brook he picked up five smooth stones
[19:37] somebody asked me one time said why did
[19:40] he pick up five smooth stones I heard
[19:43] one preacher say that those five stones
[19:46] represented the letters in the name of
[19:48] Jesus and that sounds wonderful Jes us
[19:52] and Jay is just he is expect as
[19:56] something you is unusually and it's a
[20:00] supernatural every time we mentioned the
[20:03] name Jesus alone we just expect
[20:06] something unusually supernatural to
[20:10] happen that's every time we call on the
[20:13] name Jesus man we just expect something
[20:18] unusually supernatural to happen praise
[20:21] another preacher said well those five
[20:24] stones represent f AI th faith that
[20:28] sounds wonderful and still yet another
[20:31] man said they represent grac
[20:35] and that's wonderful does it get any
[20:37] better than the name Jesus doesn't get
[20:40] any better than faith in God doesn't get
[20:43] any better than living under the grace
[20:45] or the unmerited favor of an Almighty
[20:48] God
[20:49] doesn't get any better than that but I
[20:51] still heard another man say that David
[20:54] picked up five smooth stones because he
[20:58] heard somewhere along the way that
[21:00] Goliath had four other brothers and he
[21:03] wanted to be prepared for them all so am
[21:05] i and all of that sounds great and
[21:08] somebody asked me preacher what do you
[21:11] think it meant well I just simply think
[21:14] that David picked up five smooth stones
[21:16] because that's all his pelts could hold
[21:19] okay all right and so he picked up five
[21:22] stones he crossed that brook when he
[21:26] started up that hillside how he must
[21:28] have felt as Goliath began to Harold
[21:32] come one insult after another
[21:35] finally Goliath is so angry he said I
[21:39] cannot believe that saw the man he is
[21:43] that he would send a mere boy out to do
[21:47] a man's job and Goliath said today I'm
[21:51] gonna pull your head off of your
[21:53] shoulders I'm gonna feed your scrawny
[21:55] carcass to the fowl of the air and you
[21:59] would think that David would be
[22:00] intimidated understand that David was
[22:03] not like his brothers he was not a man
[22:06] of war he was a he was a shepherd he was
[22:09] abiding in the field with his father
[22:12] sheep when word came to him right - just
[22:15] take provision and inquire concerning
[22:18] the battle however when he arrived at
[22:21] the battlefield all of the dreams that
[22:25] he had in his mind all of the thoughts
[22:27] that he had of the grandeur and the
[22:30] splendor of an of a battle was dashed
[22:34] because instead of seeing brave valiant
[22:38] men standing with glistening armor and
[22:41] holding shinies shields and swords in
[22:45] their hands he found a bun
[22:47] of grumbling men nests huddled around
[22:49] campfires and all they could talk about
[22:52] was a Philistine giant my my they were
[22:55] fearful and they were afraid and David
[22:58] went from one campfire to another trying
[23:01] to figure out just exactly what is going
[23:05] on what has gone wrong you are the
[23:09] bravest you are the strongest you are
[23:12] the best that our beloved Israel has
[23:15] what in the world is wrong have you men
[23:19] not forgotten is there not a cause oh my
[23:25] what might happen in the kingdom of God
[23:27] if somebody could rise up in this last
[23:31] hour in which we live and understand is
[23:35] there not yes yes yes and so it is David
[23:40] began to reflect on that and as he
[23:44] starts up that hillside Goliath says I'm
[23:48] gonna pull your head off your shoulders
[23:49] I'm gonna feed your scrawny carcass to
[23:53] the fowl of the air and David without
[23:55] any fear said you come to me with a
[23:58] sword with a spear and a shield but he
[24:01] said I come to you in the name of the
[24:04] Lord hallelujah the writer said the name
[24:07] of the Lord is a strong and the
[24:10] righteous run into it and they are safe
[24:13] David must have been thinking about this
[24:16] as he was sitting in the smoldering
[24:20] ruins of sick leg he must have
[24:22] remembered how it worked yes when he put
[24:25] that one stone in that Shepherd sling as
[24:29] it began to as it began the circle high
[24:33] above his head he released the stone but
[24:36] it was the hand of an Almighty God the
[24:40] same God that created heaven earth and
[24:43] all of the fullness thereof guided that
[24:46] stone into the forehead of Goliath of
[24:49] David felt the earth tremble beneath his
[24:53] feet as Goliath fell to the ground of
[24:57] how he must have
[24:59] what he must have been thinking of when
[25:01] he went over took goliaths own sword cut
[25:05] his head off and now sitting in the
[25:08] smoldering ruins of his beloved sick leg
[25:11] he remembers hearing the voice he
[25:15] remembers hearing the sound of the
[25:18] ladies singing saw has killed his
[25:21] thousands of but David his ten thousand
[25:25] and all of a sudden where he was weeping
[25:28] where he was fearful where he was afraid
[25:31] where he was uncertain just a little
[25:35] while before because of unfortunate
[25:38] circumstances and situations of now
[25:41] david has squared his shoulders back
[25:44] he's got his head held up and he says I
[25:47] feel like I can run through troop and by
[25:50] my god leave over a wall praise God
[25:54] that's real encouraging yourself in the
[25:56] Lord
[25:57] absolutely I'm many many times we have
[26:01] to reach that place we do that we just
[26:04] think about what God has done for us in
[26:08] the past and it reminds me of that
[26:10] beautiful passage in the book of
[26:13] Revelation that the testimony of Jesus
[26:16] mm-hmm is this the spirit of prophecy
[26:20] yes sir did you know there's many that
[26:23] do not quite understand the full
[26:26] application of that passage but a
[26:29] testimony is something that has already
[26:32] taken place okay prophecy often was
[26:36] something that's going to take place in
[26:39] the future and so one of the beautiful
[26:42] applications of that verse is that what
[26:46] God has done is proof and evidence that
[26:51] he will do it again
[26:53] hallelujah praise because the testimony
[26:56] of Jesus is heals the spirit of prophecy
[26:58] if somebody can testify eyes of the
[27:03] blind have been open right that the ears
[27:05] of the Deaf have been unstopped lesser
[27:08] that the lame have walked up that the
[27:10] dead have been raised to life again
[27:13] those testimonies are also prophecies
[27:17] that he will do it again I am so
[27:22] thankful that today we are not serving a
[27:25] God who used to be a mom or a god who
[27:28] was or a God who might be but we are
[27:32] serving a God who is one of the most
[27:35] beautiful things of about the testimony
[27:38] of Moses of is the fact that he said who
[27:42] shall I say sent me and God said you
[27:47] tell Pharaoh I am since you I am what I
[27:52] am bread when you're hungry I am water
[27:55] when you're thirsty I am strength when
[27:57] you're weak I am a light when you're in
[28:00] darkness I am a way when there seems to
[28:02] be no way I'm a husband to the widow I'm
[28:06] a father to the orphan I'm a doctor in
[28:09] the sick room God the ears of my
[28:12] anything and everything that we ever
[28:15] need him to be exactly exactly I am I am
[28:20] that covers a lot absolutely and so it
[28:23] is that as David thought about these
[28:26] things he naturally encouraged himself
[28:30] to the point that he decided I want to I
[28:33] want to pray I want to inquire after the
[28:36] Lord concerning what is going to go on
[28:39] and the scripture tells us in verse 7
[28:42] and David said to a buyeth or the priest
[28:44] a hymn elack's son
[28:46] I pray thee bring me hither the ephod
[28:50] and a by authorial further the ephod to
[28:53] David and David inquired at the Lord
[28:56] saying
[28:57] shall I pursue after this true man
[29:03] shall I overtake them and he answered
[29:07] him pursue for thou shalt surely
[29:10] overtake them and without fail recover
[29:14] Oh
[29:16] notice that David pointedly asks God two
[29:22] questions number one he wanted to know
[29:25] shall I pursue after this troop and
[29:29] number two if you do want me to pursue
[29:33] am I going to be able to overtake them
[29:36] right and here's the beautiful thing
[29:39] that I would like to point out that when
[29:41] David inquired at the Lord the response
[29:46] of God did not come moments later it did
[29:51] not come minutes or hours or days or
[29:55] weeks or months or years right right
[29:59] sometimes we inquire of the Lord and we
[30:03] inquire of him over and over time and
[30:06] again and in some cases we're still
[30:10] waiting on a response yes however David
[30:14] inquired at the Lord and the response of
[30:18] God was immediate
[30:20] why was the response of God immediate
[30:23] because the heaven was open you
[30:26] understand that once the heaven opens of
[30:29] we can inquire at the Lord and the
[30:32] response many times will be an immediate
[30:36] response of God immediately said pursue
[30:40] for thou shalt surely overtake them Don
[30:45] could have stopped that could have been
[30:47] the end of the situation or that could
[30:49] have been the end of the subject because
[30:51] David only wanted to know number one
[30:54] shall I pursue after them and number two
[30:58] shall i overtake them however because
[31:02] the heaven was open God said not only am
[31:05] I going to answer both questions but I'm
[31:09] gonna go one step farther he said David
[31:12] yes I want you to pursue yes
[31:16] I am going to enable you I'm going to
[31:19] empower you I'm going to allow you to be
[31:23] able to overtake them
[31:25] however third of all I'm gonna also give
[31:29] you the ability to get back or to
[31:34] recover everything that has been lost
[31:37] yes sir oh my my how important that is
[31:42] today yes not only to know that number
[31:45] one God did want David to pursue right
[31:48] I've thought about it even earlier today
[31:51] I cannot find one place anywhere in all
[31:55] of our entire holy scripture where God
[31:58] said that as a Christian as a believer
[32:01] we are supposed to be spending our life
[32:05] running from the death no sir it's not
[32:08] in here however I remember back in the
[32:10] 1980s hearing somebody to testify one
[32:14] night in the middle of a service how
[32:17] difficult and how hard it was and how
[32:19] how terribly difficult and taxing it was
[32:23] because the devil had been after them
[32:27] all day long fact is I remember very
[32:30] well this particular person asking the
[32:34] church and the minister especially would
[32:36] you please pray for me because the devil
[32:40] has been riding my back all day long and
[32:44] I just don't know if I'm gonna be able
[32:47] to make it or not and I remember as a
[32:50] young man thinking in my own mind this
[32:54] is not the way it's supposed to see
[32:57] somehow I began to realize that if we
[33:01] take the saddle off yeah devil might not
[33:04] ride us so you know there
[33:06] amen there's not one place in all of the
[33:09] scripture where God says as his children
[33:13] as his beloved as his bride as a royal
[33:18] priesthood as a holy nation as a
[33:20] peculiar people that we are supposed to
[33:24] be running from our adversary fact iou's
[33:27] of our adversary is supposed to be
[33:30] running from us absolutely man it is
[33:32] high time for somebody somewhere to
[33:36] stand a sir realize exactly who they are
[33:40] but more importantly than who they are
[33:43] we need to realize who's we are and then
[33:47] because when we realize who's we are we
[33:50] can begin to understand that we have not
[33:54] only Authority but we also have power
[33:58] amen over all of the power of the enemy
[34:01] amen and we are not supposed to be
[34:03] running from the enemy but the enemy is
[34:06] literally supposed to be running from us
[34:09] amen that is why God said yes I want you
[34:13] to pursue I don't want you to spend the
[34:17] rest of your life running from an
[34:19] adversary but I want you to pursue that
[34:22] adversary and not only are you going to
[34:25] pursue but yes I'm going to enable you
[34:28] and allow you to overtake that adversary
[34:31] and once you overtake them I'm going to
[34:35] allow you to recover everything that has
[34:39] been taken Wow absolutely that's
[34:42] incredible I don't remember how you said
[34:44] you got the three words how did those
[34:46] three words come to you as I was as I
[34:48] was praying and meditating in the
[34:51] presence of the Lord just about God
[34:54] saying that the heaven was now open the
[34:57] Lord said that this new year 2018 was
[35:01] going to be a year of restoration it was
[35:04] going to be a year of recovery and it
[35:07] was going to be a year of preparation
[35:09] and see restoration right really truly
[35:13] involves the spiritual man okay talk
[35:16] absolutely what God was trying to say to
[35:19] not just for me but for the people of
[35:22] God everywhere that have an ear to hear
[35:25] right remember we must have an area in
[35:28] order to be able to hear what the Spirit
[35:30] is saying to the church and restoration
[35:34] truly involves the act of moving from
[35:40] fellowship back to relationship see we
[35:45] have moved from the realm of
[35:48] relationship Adam and Eve had true
[35:51] relationship in the garden but because
[35:55] of the fall they moved from relationship
[35:59] inside of the garden to fellowship
[36:02] outside of the garden and did you know
[36:05] God is saying now what I truly want to
[36:08] do is I want my bride I want my people I
[36:12] want my church to move from fellow she
[36:15] okay outside of the garden back to
[36:19] relationships which is inside of the
[36:21] garden air-sea fellowship is in the
[36:24] living room but relationship is behind
[36:28] closed doors fellowship is with everyone
[36:31] around joint but relationship is when
[36:34] you become one with the one who created
[36:37] you I really like to say it like this
[36:40] that we move from fellowship to
[36:43] relationship when we finally decide to
[36:47] get out of the supper-room and move back
[36:50] into the upper room I pray Scotty man we
[36:53] get out of the supper room and we decide
[36:56] to move back into the Upper Room why is
[36:59] that because when we fellowship
[37:02] sometimes we don't understand the
[37:05] importance of not just word but spirit
[37:09] yes also sometimes we get just word and
[37:13] when we have just word the Bible tells
[37:16] us that the letter alone does what it
[37:18] kills in that right here letter alone
[37:21] killeth amen but the Spirit does what
[37:24] the Spirit gives life amen did you know
[37:28] that sometimes when we have just the
[37:30] word
[37:31] we dry up oh yeah and we see many that's
[37:35] on that extreme and then you go to the
[37:38] other extreme and you see those who have
[37:41] spirit alone and me and when you have
[37:43] spirit alone there's no foundation
[37:46] there's no substance there's no root and
[37:49] with the Spirit alone
[37:51] you blow up isn't that right it is but
[37:54] Oh Matt when you marry the word and the
[37:58] spirit when they join together and
[38:01] become one you don't dry up and you
[38:04] don't blow up but praise God you grow
[38:07] amen and that is exactly what he wants
[38:11] us to do that's what he wants to restore
[38:13] to the body of Christ yes sir he wants
[38:16] to restore relationship because it's
[38:19] relationship that enables us and allows
[38:22] us to grow up and that's the spirit man
[38:26] Wow but God said I'm not only concerned
[38:29] about the spiritual side of you God said
[38:32] I'm also concerned about the natural
[38:35] side of you I believe that I want to I
[38:37] want to enable you and allow you to
[38:40] recover I want to give back to you the
[38:45] physical things that you have lost them
[38:49] I mean because the thief comes in to do
[38:51] what to kill to steal and to destroy
[38:56] however jesus said I am come that you
[39:00] might have one life and have it more
[39:03] abundantly and so he truly cares about
[39:07] not only the spiritual satisfying he can
[39:10] he cares about the natural side Jesus
[39:13] himself says but seek ye first the
[39:17] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[39:20] all these things shall be added unto you
[39:24] yes I remember when the light finally
[39:27] turned on and I began to understand that
[39:30] if I will put God first he delights in
[39:35] adding all of these other things to me
[39:38] grace
[39:38] I'm a father and you're a father and you
[39:41] know what we delight yes yes giving our
[39:44] children your natural things that they
[39:48] won't or desire how much more our
[39:51] heavenly father the lights and desires
[39:55] to give us the things in this life that
[39:58] we enjoy when we put him first man when
[40:02] we put him first
[40:03] all he really wants us to do is just
[40:06] allow him to be number one allow him to
[40:10] have preeminence in our life and when he
[40:13] has preeminence when he is first and we
[40:15] put him first and we seek after his kids
[40:19] yes he said I'm just going to naturally
[40:21] allow all of these other things to be
[40:25] added unto you he said David if you
[40:28] pursue not only am I gonna allow you to
[40:32] overtake your enemy but once you
[40:35] overtake them I'm going to allow yes sir
[40:38] to recover all of the physical things
[40:41] yes Lord that have been lost remember
[40:44] that God that gave to job in the end
[40:48] twice as much as he had in the beginning
[40:51] remember in the beginning he lost what
[40:54] seven thousand sheep three thousand
[40:57] camel five hundred yoke of oxen five
[41:00] hundred donkeys he lost a household of
[41:03] male and female servants in their item
[41:07] of course he did and imagine the enemy
[41:10] thought now that he's lost all of that
[41:13] he's gonna quit he's gonna give up he's
[41:16] gonna turn back he's gonna walk away but
[41:19] you know what job did not quit job did
[41:22] not turn back Joe did not walk away no
[41:25] sir
[41:26] he thought it can't get much darker than
[41:28] this however the last the last surviving
[41:32] servant would come and say job your
[41:35] seven sons and three daughters were
[41:38] feasting in the house of the eldest
[41:41] brother when a wind came smote the four
[41:44] corners of the house it fell in it was
[41:47] so
[41:48] sudden that not one of your children
[41:51] were able to escape job I hate to bear
[41:55] to you the bad news however all 10 of
[41:59] your children are now dead can you
[42:02] imagine what a dark day that must have
[42:05] been I don't want to imagine that you
[42:07] know I could not imagine the grief of
[42:10] losing one child much less all of my
[42:13] children right at one time you would
[42:16] think that job would quit yes sir you
[42:18] would think that he would throw in the
[42:20] towel you would think that he would
[42:22] become angry and charge God bitterly
[42:26] however we remember exactly what he did
[42:29] the Bible said that he shaved his head
[42:31] he went his mantle off' and he fell down
[42:36] on the ground and he did what he didn't
[42:39] complain he wasn't angry he wasn't upset
[42:43] he didn't wrestle or struggle with the
[42:46] question why he didn't say god this is
[42:49] not fair the Bible said he worship
[42:53] worship he worshiped saying naked came I
[42:56] into this world and naked shall I return
[43:00] thither he said the LORD hath given and
[43:03] the LORD hath taken away but blessed be
[43:07] the name of the Lord the recovery always
[43:12] comes in the life of a believer when we
[43:16] decide
[43:17] regardless of what we've lost like
[43:19] regardless of how painful and how dark
[43:23] and how devastating us might be I'm
[43:26] still gonna give my praise to the God
[43:30] that created worthy I'm still gonna lift
[43:33] up mine eyes in that what David said
[43:36] under the hills of from whence cometh my
[43:39] help because my help comes from where
[43:42] the Lord who made heaven and earth
[43:46] remember today help never comes o when
[43:50] your head is hung down up looking at the
[43:53] ground of help always comes when we live
[44:01] no matter how dark it is no matter how
[44:05] bad you may feel lift your eyes up to
[44:09] the heavens because help is on the way
[44:13] Amen recovery is on the way
[44:16] for the people of God yes recovery is on
[44:19] the way for the bride of crime and
[44:21] somebody said why is recovery not only
[44:26] of natural things and restoration
[44:30] restoring a relationship as far as the
[44:34] spiritual man is concerned why is that
[44:36] so vitally important because restoring
[44:40] relationship and recovering the natural
[44:44] things in this life that we have lost is
[44:46] going to prepare us to be empowered and
[44:51] positioned for the mighty last move to
[44:56] the last stage I'm I'm and that is
[44:59] exactly what we are in store for I mind
[45:01] that was the third word the third
[45:03] promise for 2018 what's preparation
[45:05] preparation and see God is preparing us
[45:10] jesus said these works shall you do and
[45:15] greater works than these hallelujah
[45:20] praise the Lord hallelujah that's and so
[45:24] it is that what God was trying to say to
[45:27] me as an individual not just for my
[45:31] personal ministry but also for all of
[45:33] the people of God all around the globe
[45:37] that number one he desires to restore
[45:41] our relationship yes you do he desires
[45:45] for us to move from the outside of the
[45:49] garden the fellowship back to the inside
[45:52] of the garden which is relationship he
[45:55] desires for us to you know get out of
[45:59] the courtyard and get out of the holy
[46:01] place and move into the most holy place
[46:04] because that's where the presence of God
[46:07] that's where the weighty presence
[46:10] that's where the life-changing presence
[46:12] is at see when we move from fellowship
[46:16] to relationship we no longer have that
[46:20] testimony that every once in a great
[46:22] while we are stirred you know we go to
[46:26] church and a word stirs us when you're a
[46:29] testimony and it stirs us a song may
[46:32] stir us but oh my when we move from
[46:35] fellowship to relationship we are no
[46:39] longer stirred but we are changed and
[46:42] you know what the people of God are
[46:44] desperately seeking and waiting for the
[46:47] change to come on mama and so
[46:50] restoration is gonna bring that recover
[46:53] it is going to assist that and be a
[46:56] product of that restoration when we
[46:58] recover natural things that's just
[47:01] that's just an expression that's just
[47:04] proof that's just evidence that we have
[47:07] experienced restoration on the inside
[47:11] and this is going to prepare us what
[47:15] it's gonna do is it's gonna position us
[47:17] amen so that we can be empowered to
[47:21] reach this world unlike ever before wow
[47:24] what a wonderful word what a wonderful
[47:27] promise and all of that ties right back
[47:30] into the open heaven
[47:31] absolutely mm-hmm so it wasn't just for
[47:34] the tenth meeting we're not in our it
[47:35] was it was a prophetic released word
[47:38] absolutely absolutely and it is amazing
[47:42] again we have been seen evidence of this
[47:45] in all of our meetings since it just
[47:48] seems like that up every meeting that
[47:51] we've had from that time just seems to
[47:54] be getting greater and greater more and
[47:57] more powerful and we just keep seeing
[47:59] more and more miraculous things unfold
[48:02] and our hearts are filled with great
[48:07] expectancy in my mind we are filled with
[48:09] great expectancy it just reminds me so
[48:13] much of how Peter and John were leaving
[48:17] the Upper Room they were on their way to
[48:19] the temple for prayer and as they were
[48:22] passing
[48:23] through that beautiful gate there was
[48:25] that lame man less they're begging arms
[48:29] right and as they started to pass
[48:31] through that gate Peter and John look at
[48:34] the lame man and they said fasten your
[48:38] eyes upon us no doubt from a carnal
[48:42] standpoint the lame men must have
[48:45] thought these two men
[48:47] I feel really generous today and they
[48:51] are just about to bless me in a way like
[48:54] I've never been blessed he was thinking
[48:57] in a monetary way however he must have
[49:01] been suddenly disappointed when Peter
[49:05] would say silver and gold have I none
[49:09] but what I want to point out is before
[49:11] he said that the Bible said that the
[49:14] lame men did what the lame man fastened
[49:18] his eyes upon him the Bible said that
[49:20] the lame man looked up expecting to
[49:25] receive something from them
[49:28] hallelujah mine did you know in order
[49:30] for us to receive restoration in order
[49:34] for us to receive recovery good in order
[49:37] for us to walk in preparation in order
[49:41] for us to be positioned and empowered by
[49:44] the presence of God that we must be
[49:48] expecting to receive something from him
[49:52] mama the Bible said that the lame man
[49:55] looked up expecting to receive something
[49:59] from them and I think that in this hour
[50:03] there is a tremendous expectancy that is
[50:08] beginning to fill the atmosphere I
[50:11] really feel that I feel there's a
[50:13] tremendous expectancy that's just
[50:16] beginning to feel the atmosphere and
[50:18] people are expecting things that they've
[50:22] never seen with their eyes or heard with
[50:25] their ears after all what did he say I
[50:28] has not seen ear has not heard neither
[50:31] has it entered into the heart of man the
[50:33] things that God has
[50:36] paired for them do what who love you man
[50:41] sometimes we get so wrapped up in the
[50:44] basic survival of life that we forget we
[50:49] are serving a God who is able to do what
[50:53] exceedingly abundantly above anything
[50:57] that we could ask or think in this our
[51:02] God is filling the hearts of men with an
[51:06] expectancy for exceedingly abundantly
[51:12] hallelujah and so it is that when the
[51:15] lame man looked up expecting he was
[51:18] expecting silver and gold he was
[51:22] expecting a few coins in the bottom of a
[51:26] cup right right however Peter said
[51:29] silver and gold have I none I kind of
[51:34] like to say it like this no doubt Peter
[51:37] may have looked over at John and said
[51:39] you have revelation and I've got
[51:42] demonstration amen did you know in this
[51:45] hour of expectancy we need a marriage of
[51:48] of Revelation yes and demonstration on
[51:52] why because the Apostle Paul said I do
[51:55] not come to you with the enticing words
[51:58] of man's wisdom but in the power and the
[52:03] demonstration of the Holy Ghost story
[52:06] yes we need revelations are unlike ever
[52:09] before do we need ears to be able to
[52:12] hear the revelation of God like never
[52:15] before but at the same time to validate
[52:19] the revelation we need demonstration sir
[52:23] how long has it been since we were an
[52:27] eyewitness to real genuine Heaven Sent
[52:32] biblical demonstration of God's power
[52:36] and presence and so it is he said silver
[52:40] and gold have
[52:42] none but such as health now please
[52:49] notice at this moment how critical it is
[52:53] the reason in a lot of places that we
[52:57] are not seeing demonstration is because
[53:01] people don't have anything and when you
[53:04] don't have anything you cannot
[53:06] demonstrate any things right
[53:08] you cannot give if you have not first
[53:12] received a man no doubt jay-bez said
[53:16] bless me why because he understood how
[53:20] can I bless others unless I have first
[53:24] been blessed myself right how can I give
[53:28] to others unless I have first received
[53:32] something myself how can I demonstrate
[53:35] the miraculous how can I demonstrate the
[53:39] power and the presence of Almighty God
[53:42] if I have not been somewhere and
[53:45] received first myself oh my and so it is
[53:50] the lane men had no idea Peter and John
[53:53] had just walked out of the upper room
[53:56] Peter had just delivered the very first
[54:01] spirit-filled message to the church when
[54:05] he stood on the steps of of that upper
[54:08] room and declared this is that that was
[54:12] spoken by the Prophet Joe ala in the
[54:14] last days of hallelujah and so it is now
[54:18] he sells silver and gold have I none but
[54:23] such as I have give I under this in the
[54:29] name of Jesus Christ rise to your head
[54:33] and walk notice the Apostle Peter did
[54:36] not wait on the lame man to jump up and
[54:40] walk he did not wait for the lame man to
[54:43] embrace this and then act upon it the
[54:47] Bible said that he took the lame man by
[54:49] the hand
[54:50] and pulled him to his feet and
[54:53] immediately the lame man received
[54:55] strength of in his feet and his ankle
[54:59] bones and he went running and he went
[55:02] leaping and he went praising God into
[55:06] the temple imagine what they must have
[55:10] thought when this lame man came bursting
[55:13] into the temple shouting and worshipping
[55:17] and praising the Lord no doubt they
[55:21] quickly surrounded him and said look if
[55:25] you're gonna stay in here you're gonna
[55:27] have to sit down and you're gonna have
[55:29] to be quiet and you're gonna have to
[55:32] hold your peace of because of you are
[55:35] not allowed to do that's not temple
[55:39] protocol at this moment amen
[55:42] that's not temple protocol at this
[55:45] moment however I've got a real good
[55:47] feeling that the lame man must've looked
[55:50] at those surrounding him and said don't
[55:53] you recognize Who I am and as much as
[55:57] you would like for me to sit down and as
[56:00] much as you would like for me to be
[56:01] quiet and as much as you would like for
[56:04] me to hold my peace I've got a real good
[56:06] feeling that Lane man must have said
[56:10] that I can't sit on there because I just
[56:13] got up I've got a real good feeling
[56:15] there's some people up in God's church
[56:18] that are just about to declare I can't
[56:22] sit down because I just got up
[56:25] imagine that balloon man was exactly
[56:29] like another lame man who went to church
[56:33] with his back on a bed but after one
[56:37] touch up he went home with a beard on
[56:40] his back
[56:41] I'm telling you
[56:43] miraculous Amman can unfold the
[56:46] demonstration of God's power can
[56:49] overtake you in one brief moment of if
[56:52] you will just simply a look up expecting
[56:57] to receive something from here Wow
[57:01] surely you must be expecting after
[57:04] hearing a word from the Lord like that
