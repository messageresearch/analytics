doesn't matter what you're going through he's above it all doesn't matter how you feel he's above it all God is good all the time amen well well well the back row is almost full back there that is brother Jeff o om million and sister dla om million it's been 10 years 10 years since we've seen them that is Sister Betty o million's grandson and uh his beautiful wife dla he doesn't mind me saying that and how many children now three and one on the way we are so good so glad it's so good to see you all again God bless [Applause] you um Jeff would it be all right if we let uh sister dla just say something is that okay with you as her as her husband take the mic back there she she's never had an opportunity to give a little portion of her testimony but I heard her give it in another church and I don't want to put her on the spot too much but this is their 10-e anniversary of visiting it's been so long where do you all live now we live in Cambridge Ontario in Canada in Ontario for a while you were traveling around a little bit though weren't you in a bus or something uh yes so when Noah was born a couple of months after after we moved into an RV and we rented our home because our desire was to live out in the country and so we drove our RV to brother Dale loff's Farm he's a pastor and he's also a beef cattle farmer So within about a month of us being there the RV flooded oh and we moved into his office with the newborn so wow um we did try for quite a few years to to find a place to live we tried renting we tried to buy several homes and everything kept falling apart um so we saw that God was closing a lot of doors at that time in that area so anyway it led us back to Hamilton altario which is close to Cambridge um we ended up living with Jeff's parents for a while we ended up renting another home in Hamilton eventually we moved back in to the original home in Cambridge uh just a about 4 months before we had our second son so and what's interesting is what's L us here is that we now have our house up for sale that's in Cambridge so we feel the Lord leading us again uh to move out to the country we found our dream home so because we cleaned the home and staged it we thought it would be best to go somewhere for about a week while they show the house is it can be challenging with little ones to continually uh keep the house for so we Jeff said you know what dma why don't we go to Alabama and I said that would be the most precious gift to me because 10 years ago yesterday I was saved in this church um I grew up in a Muslim home and my entire family is Muslim and 10 years ago God started giving me visions of going to church praise the Lord and around that time um Betty oilon my husband's grandmother was is very ill and he said dla would like us to go to Alabama to for you to meet her before she passes and at the time we had no children and so we did a road trip out here with our German Shepherd and we arrived Saturday evening at the McGregor's house and they said tomorrow we're going to church and you're more than welcome to come however if you'd rather go to the flea market there's a great flea market you can check out too whatever is you know whatever you prefer and so that night I told Jeff I'm like I would love to go to church and he his jaw nearly hit the floor but uh we came here and I think right at the beginning I said you know I knew there was a God but I didn't have a name for him and I said God you know you just you have your way I I felt uncomfortable because I never been in a church and the worship started I didn't know what to do but the third song in was How Great Thou Art and wow when that started playing God just he took a hold of my heart and I said how do I know this song and I just started singing for my soul and I remember that a few weeks ago my friend's grandmother died and they handed out these song books to everybody there and they had us sing How Great Thou Art because she was a Christian and my mom even had the book in her hands and she was sitting right beside me so from that moment God had my heart and wow I knew I was going to be baptized and so I spoke to my parents about it and on October 14th of 2014 was when I was baptized in his name God praise I've never looked back and now I'm blessed with this beautiful family serving him and I'm so happy to be here praise the Lord how wonderful God bless you praise the [Music] Lord what a wonderful surprise we're very glad to have this young brother with us also God bless you you're welcome and I don't know if you could hear Ben it almost sounded like he was mumbling you were you probably it could have been the muffling muffled uh speaker but uh today you know brother Brent and sister Trish have visited us several times but now the real adventure begins they get to experience what some of you experienced when you started this way a long time ago there's just something about Alabama that can be very difficult and uh you have to break through it and you have to uh you need a lot of prayer and a lot of lifting up and of course we didn't tell them all that till they got here but we are very happy to have them and Joseph here for their first official Sunday and they're looking for a permanent place to live and sister Trish has a job and brother Brent will have one eventually but right now he's got a job uh taking care of Joseph and going back to get their stuff and so we want to uh join Ben and and making sure that you all know what we're announcing they they have officially landed and we're very very happy to have them this morning very happy very [Applause] [Music] blessed it's been many years since we welcomed someone from Tucson here and we're very very thankful that God has done that he's just a good god he's just a big woman wonderful amazing father isn't he Amen Let let's stand uh I feel a little a little emotional uh hearing that testimony in person for the first time I'm so thankful that God's grace and mercy Knows No Boundaries doesn't matter how you're raised you know I loved what she said I knew there was a God I just didn't know what his name was you know that's powerful to me it's powerful aren't you glad that you know by Revelation that Jehovah of the old is Jesus Christ of the new that's his name we sometimes call him God but that's not his name he has a name and for us today his name is Yeshua hamashiach Yeshua the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ uh sister Laurel what key would we do a verse and chorus of how great thou are the end and sings my soul my saor God to thee how great thou are sing it out how great thou are then sings my soul Oh My Savior God to thee yes Lord woo How Great Thou Art how great thou softly oh Lord my God when I in aome Wonder consider all all the world thy hands have made I see the stars and I hear The Rolling Thunder thy power throughout oh yes the universe displayed then sings my soul then sings my soul my S your God to thee How Great Thou [Music] Art how great thou oh yes Jesus then sings my soul my S your God to thee How Great Thou Art oh yes how great thou soft on the music so you can sing these words when Christ shall come with shout of acclamation and take me home what Joy shall fill my heart then I I shall bow woo in Humble eyes adoration oh what a day and there Proclaim my God how great thou sing it like an Anthem then sings my soul my savior God to thee isn't it great isn't he great today how great [Music] thou How Great Thou Art precious Lord then sings my soul my savior God Jes to thee How Great Thou Art how great thou he's great he's great today he's high and lifted up today he's wonderful and worthy to he oh precious Jesus precious Lord I'm so thankful to know him not just know about him but to know him in the power of his resurrection he lives I want you to tell your neighbor Jesus lives and if anyone ever ask you how you know you tell them because he lives in me how how how could you have someone living in your house and not know it I know that he's real because I know where he lives he lives in me well would you thank God for these musicians [Applause] incredible incredible gift every one of them let's get our Bibles this morning and uh while you are getting ready there's a whole lot to say quickly want to thank every one of you who were here yesterday I tried to get around to most of you who didn't know brother Anthony to to thank you for making the extra effort to come uh their their many of their friends there was a couple here from Birmingham there was a lady who drove from Montgomery uh to be here and they were blessed there was one of the gentlemen who said I'm a Nazarene too but you sang my favorite song so I felt right at home and we just appreciated the presence of the Lord that came and I know it was a sacrifice for you to come and it's awkward and not necessarily knowing someone but you really made it a very special uh Memorial and it meant a lot to Sister Cindy as I said earlier and we appreciate you for doing that so much and we look forward to being able to see more of her in the in the near future she's got a lot to navigate but we know that God is going to strengthen her all the way through amen Ben got off work at Kia drove straight here to be able to lead a couple of songs for us and we appreciate that uh Jesse what time did you get in from Missouri 10:30 this morning you drove all night if you sleep I'm going to hurt you just so you know but but I am deeply impressed by your dedication you told me when you left you wanted to be here Sunday morning Drove all night home from Missouri now what he was doing off in Missouri who who knows I think there's a girl there or something I don't know but you know let me tell you something Jesse is really blessed because he he got his eye on a girl and that family's been trying to move here for years all of a sudden brother Truman had a dream and he brought the dream to me and I wouldn't touch it I said no no no no you know what that means you don't need me to tell you and the next thing you know they're selling their place they've got a place here they're on the way so God must really love you Jessie he brings your girl all the way from Missouri right to your neighborhood is't that something God is good he's good okay quickly tomorrow Josiah and Jennifer who who are already have a baby here uh tomorrow is their oneyear anniversary and we want to wish them a very happy anniversary God bless Josiah and Jennifer they didn't waste any time they're getting started on their family and why not amen Tuesday is Charity Grace's birthday I could say so much honey because it's one of those even numbers but I'm just going to leave it at that it had to come eventually let's celebrate Charity's birthday with her tell her how much we love her appreciate her we don't get to see Wesley Miller very often but it's his family that's moving here and his birthday's on Thursday we want to pray for Wesley that he'll always do what God has called him to do and that God will be with him and Ben who was leading the service today his birthday is on Friday I think he turns 33 is that right my my I remember when you people were young and little Nia she's not here today but my sweet Nia turns 8 on Friday so let's hold her up to the Lord my dear friend sister Jennifer W she might be might be streaming this morning or they may see this I hope they do next Saturday is her birthday and uh just just remember this next week is would be Anthony and Cindy's uh 43rd wedding anniversary and and the Lord took him just a little shy of that 43rd year but we want to pray especially for her during that time and there are several other birthdays next week and and uh I won't I won't take time I'm doing that because I won't be here next Sunday but guess what I've got good news the Holy Ghost will be here he's he won't be on vacation I'm going to be on vacation but the Holy Ghost will not be on holiday he will be here amen and I'll be back the following week we Colossians chapter 3 beginning in verse 5 through 10 mortify that means ultimately kill Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is idolatry for which thing sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which he also walked sometime these are from the original notes when ye lived in them but now ye also put off all these anger anybody get angry wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth watch your mouth lie not one to to another that's important tell the truth even if it hurts you're God's kids now you've got to live like God's children now we have to seeing that you put that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man praise God which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him I want to read that in the Amplified and if you'll remain standing we'll ask the Lord to bless our time in a moment so killed deaden deprive of power the evil desire lurking in your members that's your base nature that's the adamic nature that's the sinful nature when brother Brandon was preaching on that he drew two hearts on the board he said I'm not an artist I'll read that to you later he said I'm not an artist but he he drew two hearts on the board in one he put a little bird a little dove in one he put a snake and he talked about about that being the nature of the inner man and he said if that serpent is there hasn't been run off then you're going to have all these works of the flesh present once you get rid of him once you mortify that sinful nature there's another nature that comes and lives inside of you it's not your life anymore you're now bought with a price and the life that you now live the Apostle said is the life of Jesus Christ is that right so killed deaden deprive of power the evil desire lurking in your members those animal impulses and all that is Earthly in you that is employed in sin sexual vice impurity sensual appetites Unholy desires and all greed and covetousness for that is idolatry the deifying the deifying of self and other created things instead of God that's what idolatry is did you know it's not doesn't have to be your your your companion or your automobile or your job that you make an idol out of sometimes we make ourselves the idol right and we take better self better care of ourselves than we do the things of God and the apostles said this was going on in the first church age how much more could we expect that it be happening around us in the last Church age but how many of you know God got a remedy for that snake in your heart he's got another life all together that he's pouring into his sons it is on account of these very sins that the holy anger of God is ever coming upon the sons of Disobedience those who are obstinately you know what that word obstinate about don't you stubbornness obstinately opposed to the Divine will you were born with something that is obstinately opposed to the Divine will of God and you're the only person that can kill that thing you're the only person that can crucify that thing your husband can't do it for you your wife can't do it for you your preacher can't do it for you a prophet can't do it for you you're the one who has to put that old man to death amen but as soon as you do guess what you've got a new man you've got a new life that comes rushing in among whom you also once walk don't forget those of us who have been delivered from the nature of sin sometimes we get a little bride Pride going on and we need to remember that in one moment we could fall beneath the load of all that junk it's only by the grace of the master that we keep walking upright amen it's not our goodness so we also were living in and addicted to such practices there's just no doubt about that and have clothed yourselves now praise God but now put away and rid yourselves completely of all these things anger rage bad feeling toward others you've never had that have you curses and

you for being with us there are all kinds of things reaching for your attention and you somehow made it a point to be with us today and and we're we're very grateful for that we are coming to an end soon of a series where we were talking about uh this this Frozen love because iniquity shall abound the Bible said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold it shall become Frozen and you know if something had life in it and it's frozen uh quite often then it's paralyzed it can't it can't move it can't produce and we don't want that to be the case with our love we want to be passionately in love with Jesus Christ we don't want a head knowledge come on now we want a heart knowledge and it's not about religion because religion is vile religion is vile religion is stuffy but relationship is is your destiny if you're a part of the bride of Christ you're not called to a religious order you're called to a close and passionate relationship with Jesus Christ amen so don't settle for anything else it's not about just keeping a set of rules or standards it's about falling in love with him and when you fall in love with him you're going to love other people you're particularly going to love those who are of the household of faith the Bible said but your love is not going to be uh uh limited only to people who have tasted what you've tasted you're going to love a world that's lost and broken and dying and going to hell and you're going to want to tell them the truth and you're going to want to do it in love you're not going to want to do it with legalism or with religious talk you're going to want to do it with your life how many of you know your life is your biggest testimony amen the way you live in front of other people and and you better be careful because some people know you and you don't know them we a few weeks ago I I mean you know I don't post every problem I have uh for prayer because I ask you to pray for us I hope you do but we have problems too you know we have septic tank problems and air conditioning problems and uh automobile problems sometime few weeks ago went to put something in the refrigerator and it had died I don't mean it was on the blink I mean it was graveyard dead and uh you know so we go and uh the girl who cuts my hair she said well I go to Daniel and I used to go to Daniel years ago um but somehow the big box stores sometime make it easier and we just started popping in there but we went to Daniel and walked in the door and met met a lady that used to visit the church years ago and had a nice reunion with her and here come a Salesman walking over and and uh we don't have a lot of time for small talk we tell him we're in a hurry we got the whole family we've got the whole family with us we we we moved in there like The Brady Bunch or something and he looked at us kind of funny like do you have to have the you know everybody when you're refrigerator is an important piece of furniture how many of you know that's what keeps the grocery School ask Brother David his one out just a few days ago they know what it's like and so we we start negotiating and we we're looking at two different models and one of them is it's Swanky I mean to tell you it'll run it it's almost as though it will leave the house and go to the grocery store fill itself and come back I said I think that's a little more refrigerator than we need need but my wife you know my wife you know wives she said well what's the difference in the price oh just $1,000 I said no no no no no no no no no how many of you remember when refrigerators big ones didn't cost that much less be the difference so what's the diff no difference what's the difference in the motor no difference what's the difference in the in in the you know the power all all is it going to cool the yeah going to cool the same these are just bells and whistles and the reality is he said to us you're going to get 8 to 10 years on it I saidou kidding me he said ' no we don't promise anybody it doesn't matter how much you pay for it if you get 8 to 10 years out of a refrigerator you're doing good you know I I wasn't happy I I'm so glad I didn't act ugly I'm glad I didn't stop my foot because after we've negotiated the price and we go in and we sit down to try to uh to uh come up with the money you know they do want the money and we're in there figuring out what card to put it on and the man says well I guess I'll tell you now I I know you I know you're a pastor I know some people in your church and so forth you know I was so glad that I was nice you don't ever know you want to live your life for Christ uh on a Monday just like you would any other day of the week because people are watching you and people know you whether you know them or not so we want to shine like the stars for Jesus Christ amen we have made our way through some of the behaviors of familiar spirits that's what we've been working on together especially those familiar spirits that like to operate through through an ancestrial line uh which the Bible we don't have to go back and ground all this we've grounded it already in the word these Spirits like to hang around families and they like to attack generations and they like to move from one generation to the next with their with their ugliness and we just believe that according to the word of God we don't have to be under that curse generation after generation the blood of Jesus is sufficient the name of Jes Jesus is sufficient the word of God is sufficient come on to use against the enemy and to break that curse so we have made our way down to to uh some of the last characteristics and the last time we were together you were you were blessed to have a guest speaker two services in a row so we're coming back to this this morning and we made our way to selfish ambition I'd like for you to put the definition of selfish ambition up one more time and let's look at that together how many of you are with me this morning selfish ambition focusing on one's own self personal wants and desires while trying to get ahead of others sounds like a little competition sounds like a little emulation going on come on wanting to get ahead of the Joneses you know amen someone gets a new vehicle I got to get a new vehicle whether I can afford it or not do you understand that's not the way you make purchases folks because you do have to pay for them eventually right manipulating others while focusing on what we can gain and profit stepping on others to get ahead you ever known anyone like that have you ever been anyone like that selfish is not selfishness is not just about how we act it's actually more than that it can also be what we don't do like leaving the mess oh I can tell you're ready for me to be on vacation like leaving the mess for someone else to clean up I I often say stepping over the piece of trash you know the older we get it gets a little harder to touch the floor so think about us would you you young whipper snappers think about us when you see something pick it up well I don't know what to do with it put it in your pocket throw it away later you know don't don't be that person that that sweeps their side of the porch and leaves the other neighbor's side unswept or or or cleans the snow off thank God we don't have to deal with a lot of that but I saw that picture where two apartments side by side and one set of steps and and and one three foot section is clear and the other three foot section just three feet it's not and and and it you be almost just as easy with a little sacrifice to do something for someone else don't let your love become so Frozen that you can't make a little sacrifice for somebody else so sometimes leaving the mess for someone else to clean up it's just an indication that something selfish is going on it also comes across in our words when we speak our mind it's that giving a piece of our mind away I gave him a piece of my mind I gave her a piece of my mind that's why some of us are running short because we've given so much of it away without considering the effect our words might have on others or could you read that for me my eyes are a little blurry or when we I know you're thinking about me but it's actually my job to talk a lot today it's the other talk it's that it's that running off at the mouth sometimes we expose our heart because we can't shut up oh wait wait just Amen brother you know we expose our heart by talking too much God help us this is not just about me making it all the way to the end I don't want to get there and be by myself I want us to go together how many of you want to journey together with God's people you you don't want to get ahead and leave others behind come go with us let God do a mighty work in your life today if there's any selfishness operating in you I know I know that he knows how if you'll just lay your heart on the operating table today he knows how to Grub it out he knows how to dig it out selfishness is an attitude issue for example you may let others have their way but inside you become resentful and bitter no it doesn't matter you go ahead there's only there's only one order left of fries and I'm going to let you have that order of fries but inside I'm going to resent it and uh I'm going to think about you every time I see you I'm going to think about the fact that you took the last order even though I offered it to you do you know there's a lot of people like that they'll say it doesn't matter I'm preaching they'll say it doesn't matter but it does matter don't lie if it matters you know um I have a precious daughter-in-law I have two amazing daughters and I have a precious daughter-in-law and a few weeks ago they wanted to have Burgers on Sunday look folks I know some of you have grown up eating hamburgers on Sunday but that doesn't appeal to me a hamburger is another day of the week food not a Sunday food uh I don't get a lot of Sunday food on Sunday anymore but Sunday is for fried chicken and uh mashed potatoes and and a boatload of gravy not Burgers somebody said well burgers are cheaper well I don't know where you're buying them but they're not as cheap as they once were I'm sorry I know Nathan I know some of you grew up on good burgers but I I just so I went I I went I wasn't happy but I went and we went to Five Guys well I'm I'm not a five guy fan I'll just be honest with you I'm not I've never been satisfied with my burger there but but that Sunday it was amazing do you know why I got my daughter-in-law's burger she knows how to order order them I just found out the burgers are amazing you just have to know what to put on them to make them amazing and I took one bite and I said uhoh this is not mine I think this is Jenna's and Jenna said you go right ahead and I I said well let me have at least one more B she said no no I'm serious you have it well I just took a risk that she would eventually be resentful and I ate it and it was amazing and from now on she's going to have to order my burger I know that's just a silly little thing but you'd be surprised in families how things like that can someone says can I have this last piece of chicken and everybody says oh yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead and then an argument happens later way later months later and somebody say you always get the best you always take the last you took that last piece of chicken yeah but you said it didn't matter how many of you know these things can oh I see some folks with me now I do I see some folks relating to my story it'll build up in you you don't want that let me tell you something when you learn to give it when you learn to let it go when you learn to let somebody else have it you get free there is a freedom that comes from not having to have it I had a first cousin who would pour us a glass of chocolate milk and then stand under the light to see which one was the fullest not to give it to me but to take it for himself I just let him have it in a childlike way I could have fussed I should have fussed but I just let him have it and and you know what looking back at his life that was probably the only pleasure that he had was taking the biggest glass of chocolate milk because his life has been a disaster since he was just a kid I learned it doesn't matter two sips less I know it's silly talk this morning but two sips less isn't going to starve you letting somebody else have the last piece is not going to starve you if you'll just make up your mind you're going to do it without bitterness you're going to do it without resentment I'm just not going to fight over something that doesn't matter well you're just talking to children aren't you I am overgrown ones cuz we were all toddlers once and some times we hold on to the silliest of things and you may think it's all just silliness but it can be rooted in something that plagued your parents and their parents and you don't want that selfishness is an attitude issue when you don't get what we want or when others get the credit some people get all the thank yous some people get all the appreciation some people get really bragged on while other people don't seem to get the kind of attention or the kind of recognition that they need and the quicker that you're able to let that go assuming hoping that it wasn't intentional when you start letting your mind tell you that it was on purpose purpose well I know him and I know her and I know how they operate when you start letting your mind tell you it was on purpose you're the one that's going to pay the price we want every bit of that root to be dealt with by the power of the Holy Spirit I don't want that in my life the English language has many words for selfishness bearing witness to how Universal human selfishness is a person might be arrogant self-serv serving self-absorbed self-centered boastful vain bigheaded self-possessed self-important self-focused conceited hauy proud preoccupied with self an egomaniac narcissistic self-indulgent ostentatious or presumptuous each of these words has a different Nuance but they all refer to someone who is always putting thems first and we read Isaiah 14 12-14 and we learned that this was something that was was formed in the heart of Lucifer he was more beautiful than all the other created beings he was so intricately and beautifully designed that the the very shape and form and anatomy of his body was created if you look at the word in the Hebrew it it's it teaches that somehow I don't know how this looked I don't know what it looked like but but the word tells us that somehow he had pipes in his body I don't know how that work well you got pipes in yours too you've got an esophagus you've got arteries and capillaries and veins and but evidently uh Lucifer this anointed cherub that before the throne even his body released musical sound that brought glory and honor to God and he got to looking at his own Beauty he saw his reflection in the throne and he started telling himself how beautiful he was how ugly everybody else was and the next thing you know he said I'm going to put my Throne up there above God's Throne come on that selfish ambition it's what led him to that great civil war that took place in the Realms of the spirit where he was able to persuade a great portion of the angels to follow him instead of the reality of their creator he's still doing that today he's still filling people with conceit he's making egomaniacs out of people he's plaguing even the body of Christ with narcissistic behavior where people think the whole church should revolve around them or the whole family should revolve around them even the whole world should revolve around them and all of it goes back to Satan's ambition and we don't want anything to do with that let the Saints say Amen James chapter 3 verse 14- 16 in the Amplified said but if you have bitter jealousy envy and contention rival rivalry rivalry let me look around and see uh who's here I I want to want to notice if there are people here who fall victim to rivalry always trying to outdo one another you know that is a painful path to choose it's an expensive path too always trying to have the best pair of tenis ues always trying to be the best better than someone else at oh let's just let's just pull something out of there volleyball disc golf always always trying to outdo always taking advantage to tell someone who's not as good how worthless how sorry what junk they are you're trash you're you're no good no wonder you don't like it you're lousy at it I I don't know but you've got to remember this everybody doesn't get that kind of humor we we don't all have the the same sense of humor I'm going to preach today all day in fact all day I told Olivia this and she said oh Dad please I said well look honey I'm not we're we don't have Sunday night we I'm not going to be here Tuesday night not going to be here Sunday not going to be here next Tuesday so let's see that's Tuesday is an hour and next Tuesday is an hour and two hours on Sunday that's four extra hours I should have tomorrow to get my point across she said oh Dad please love you honey I'm not going to do that but I want you to hear me well somebody said well I do that because you know Joe doesn't care Joe doesn't care he's not like oh sorry there is a Joe here Joseph um give me a name that nobody has around here Fred no Fred's here any Fred streaming you know that old Fred he don't care people pick on him he thinks it's all funny he loves Trash Talk he doesn't care he knows I'm only kidding we need to remember that sometimes people tell us they don't care and they pretend like they don't care but when they're alone it's like turning on a recording they're able to replay the conversation and every insult hello every insult is replaced play in their mind and what they shook off and pretended not to let bother them earlier they go to bed with it they wake up the next morning with it and if they're under a particular kind of spirit they see it when they look at themselves it begins to change their confidence and you're just having a good time folks I want you to know in the family of God In The Fellowship of faith we should be careful what we say to one another somebody said but you know Fred and I have a relationship like that well you do until you don't it doesn't hurt until it does it doesn't matter until it does matter come on brother so I just advise you to you know clean out your mouth as Believers as Brothers and Sisters in Christ I I just encourage you to say positive things as much as possible about one another even if you have to be creative it's so good to be able to say an attaboy to somebody on occasion what Improvement what Improvement you know you're really giving it a good shot and uh older siblings teach younger siblings to talk like that and it looks innocent Until It's Not Innocent you do that in front of your children your children are going to smack talk and trash talk and they're going to do it before they're old enough and mature enough to handle the consequences and they're going to think they can talk to me like that now it's quiet and I'm not going to promise you that I'm going to kiss them and tell them it don't matter right cuz sometimes it does they're going to find an older person and and and they're not mature enough to understand what's appropriate and what's not appropriate and they're going to make a mess and you may never know it but there's a preacher somewhere a pastor somewhere who has to try to fix things and that's what I'm doing this morning in love I'm not referring to anyone in particular I'm referring to everyone in particular this is a part of a selfish ambition that has to die it's got to die today we don't want it we don't want our children to carry it amen but if you have bitter jealousy envy and contention rivalry selfish ambition in your hearts do not Pride yourselves on it and thus be in defiance of and false to the truth this superficial wisdom is not such as comes down from above but it is Earthly it's it's unspiritual it's Beast like it's more animall likee than it is Godlike even devilish it's like demons it's certainly not God demoniacal for wherever there is jealousy envy and contention rivalry and selfish ambition there will also be oh confusion confusion on showing respects conf confusion in so many ways unrest disharmony rebellion and all sorts of evil and vile practices you see if your children particularly hear you trash talking somebody then in another scenario when that person has to perhaps get onto your children in a public setting that that's that's on you because the lack of respect that the child showed to that person could be a produ of your disrespect to that person we want to teach respect and not disrespect I know that you really you know don't find this to be deep Doctrine this morning but I hope it's practical enough you can take some of it home with you when you leave for wherever there's jealousy and envy and contention and rival it it goes on 1 Corinthians 10:24 let no one then seek his own good and advantage Ag and profit but rather each one of the other let him seek the welfare of his neor his neighbor this is just how God wants his kids living are you with me in the message the anointed ones at the end time paragraph 285 brother brandham is preaching away and he said not that we disagree with you brother to be different many of you here might be trinitarian preachers we don't want to be angry with you we love you if we didn't if I didn't believe that I'd never leave this church till I got down there on my knees and said God make me right brother bam is talking about the the possibility the ability to love one another even if you bitterly disagree with someone else we we're supposed to be able to embrace one another uh uh you know and and and turn and go and and and not compromise our faith but not treat someone bitterly because they don't agree with us brother benam said I don't want that arrogant selfish Spirit mixed up with mine I want my spirit to be pure and clean Brotherly Love holy with the Holy Spirit now if someone does anything wrong to me what did he say even when it's not all right it's all right even when it doesn't feel all right it's all right you know what the word said Vengeance belongeth to the Lord he said it's mine I will repay you find a way to love them anyhow you find a way to do something nice for them as brother Derek preached to us last Sunday melt them when you do kindness to someone who has wronged you it's like heaping coals of fire on their head and and brother Derek field said you know we always think that's like burning them up setting them on fire watching them burn but he said the real root of that is to is to melt them and and how many of you have ever had somebody turn around and do something very nice for you speak to you very kind when you were arrogant I know that in order to shake your head you'd have to admit that you were being arrogant but sometimes we are and controlling and someone turns around and they say something so sweet and your your face starts heating up because you know you didn't deserve that I love doing it it's fun it's actually very very fun try your best to practice it sometime when you've got one of those waitresses that woke up on the wrong side of the bed and she comes over and she what do you want engage her in such a a lovely way you know oh my this day couldn't get any worse for you could it h it's got to get better everything's going to be all right you must be under tremendous amount of pressure and and I'm going to give you a good tip I'm going to brighten up your day is it easy to do that no because we want good customer service but sometimes people are just in a mess and they don't need you to be crabby they need us to be kind they need us to offer them a a a the the the grace to make it a better day somebody said how does this apply to church it's it's the very nature and character of Jesus Christ to want to show love to somebody brother B said I don't want that arrogant selfish Spirit mixed up with mine I want my spirit to be pure and clean Brotherly Love holy I told you I didn't want lettuce on this why don't you just take it off so easy now if some holy with the Holy Spirit now if someone does anything wrong to me that's all right it's all right and though I might have the right to get back at them I don't want that in my life you know I I don't want to put words in brother bram's mouth but I hear him describing this as a burden it's a burden to need to get back at someone it's a burden you and I don't need to carry we just don't need to be weighted down with Revenge oh I want to have love he said I want to be ready to correct with love we're not talking about compr Rising truth with love that absolutely answers out yonder for it do you follow that and I have another one questions and answers number four a person ask a question question 389 when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this so should he should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth now someone is trying to find a reason for the person behaving with this complex and it can be a lot of things it can be middle child syndrome they call it but just because you're a middle child doesn't mean you have to have a chip on your shoulder so don't buy into everything you read so the question is something happened maybe to cause this in his early youth brother brandham tells us how to handle it I want you to watch this take exactly the opposite we call that moving in the opposite Spirit if someone treat you wrong don't treat them wrong back treat them right if you find yourself being stingy no one wants to hear this there's only one way to get rid of stinginess you have to give yourself out the only way to get out of that mess is give yourself out just give till it hurts and do it every time you feel something stingy yes you're moving in the opposite Spirit when you feel like you you deserve to be angry choose to be at rest when you feel like the person who mistreats you is celebrated and no one notices how mistreated you are when you feel yourself like that find somebody on popular or standing in the edges of life in the back of the crowd and pour love on them accept them show them that you prefer their company and you want to bless them and you want to be a part of their lives instead of lamenting over the fact that somebody doesn't want you in their life if you stay in that place it will bitter you it won't better you it'll make bitter and you'll run your mouth you'll run your mouth well they don't treat my kids like they treat everybody else's kids then you make it a point not to let that thing eat at you do something nice for somebody else's [Music] children don't let the enemy overwhelm you with any bit ESS or resentment not in this hour just say Lord I'm giving you my children I want you to love them and deal with them and draw them to you I'm tired of blaming other people for the children I raised oh my it's getting tied in here move in the opposite Spirit take exactly the opposite he said if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you got the other way don't let that thing get a hold of you if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got now you'll say Amen you wouldn't amen me while ago but now the prophet said it so you can really let out a big old hearty amen you give yourself out of that stingy place just go the vice versa he says that's the way to overcome anything it's an antidote when you feel angry choose Joy when you when you feel jealous choose not to feel jealous what's the opposite of jealousy wanting everybody to be blessed and prosper well praise the Lord that's the antidote he said you know my old southern mother used to say hair off the dog back is good for the bite I have to confess to you folks I have no idea what that means but I think it means something like moving the opposite Spirit maybe it's something like what's good for the Goosey is good for the gander I don't know really but I love the fact that brother brandham thought that everyone was going to understand that expression I don't know for sure that I get it but anyway it's the truth I'm going to just amen it cuz I got a feeling he knew what it meant and it went right along with the sermon okay in a message called I have heard but now I see treport he said it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and object Ives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence we've got to have confidence I want this to be to the honor and glory of God this is like brother brandom's expression getting the dead cats off the line you don't have to do a bunch of repenting when you need to call on the Lord you want your heart to be right he said then faith has a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine Faith from God he said that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that's right how many of you are looking for healing from your past you're you you don't want to blame your childhood you want to be healed from it you don't want to be handicapped from where you've been you want to be heal healed from it so that you can keep moving forward might get you emotional but it won't get you healed are you good for a few more minutes good that's that's it's 1257 um I want you to look at Proverbs with me just a moment I can't spend a lot of time here but I want to spend a few minutes here Proverbs 14:30 a sound heart heart is the life of the flesh but Envy the rottenness of the bones I don't know about you but I don't want any rotten in rot in my bones it doesn't sound Pleasant you don't want anything rotten as your core you want something beautiful something holy I spent a lot of time on this verse I told you this last Sunday I think or last maybe Sunday was a week ago Tuesday night or whenever it was last time I ministered I spent eight hours breaking down biblically the difference between envy and jealousy and and I'm not going to go very far into the study not now we may at another time but I want to hit just a few of the highlights because we often use those words synonymously as though they mean the same thing and they're very very similar you awake Jesse good they're cousins to each other but there is biblically enough difference in those words that it might help you to understand which one is trying to take a hold of you if you look at Proverbs 14:30 that we just read the word sound there I find it to be a King James word that may or may not be easily understood so let's look at what that word means in the Hebrew the word sound in the Hebrew comes from from a a word that is mar marpe which is a healing cure Health but it boils down to calmness and gentleness how many of you'd like to live a calmer life anybody would anybody like to be more gentle yes I think a lot of us would so to have a sound heart is to have a calm heart it's to have a gentle heart or A Gentle Spirit now biblically most of the time when the word in English is heart it's not referring to the blood pump most of the time in English when it says the word heart it's actually referring to the mind which is the seed of the emotions biblically the heart is the seat or the seedbed of the emotions but that's the mind not the pump the mind so to have a calm sound let me say it this way to have a sound heart is to have a Calm Mind wouldn't you like to have such a settledness in your mind in your heart that you were not easily flustrated that's a good word not easily flustrated when you come into an environment that is chaotic wouldn't it be wonderful to have so much calmness in your mind so much gentleness in your heart that no matter what was going on around you you were able just to navigate it quietly and confidently not losing your peace not losing your temper not losing your joy not getting red in the face not sending your blood pressure through the roof but just calmly oh come on husbands I'm preaching to us wives too just so calm and gentle in your heart one of the ways to make sure that your heart is well your mind is well is to is to deal with those issues that bring us out of peace and into chaos and the writer here says Envy in in Hebrew it's Cana and it means ardor or Zeal or anger rivalry and it can mean in some verses of scripture jealousy but there is a difference if you look at that in the Amplified you find a better use of those Hebrew words let's glance at it a calm and undisturbed mind and heart are the life and health of the body body I mean that's spiritual and it's also not somebody said what do you mean well science now tells us that as our mind goes our body goes the Bible already tried to tell us that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth talks and whatever we say is what we become that's what the Bible tells tells us and and we know that's not just spiritually it's also physically if our mind is consumed with worry and Chaos it affects the systems of our body our nervous system can cause our organs to to deteriorate a nervous mind can cause a a breakdown in the organs of our body and a chaotic mind and a chaotic heart can actually destroy brain cells and if you're like me you want to hold on to everyone you got you don't want to lose any and stress and worry and anxiety and resentment and rivalry and H all of this pressure that we get under it causes us to lose what we need to have a sound mind into our Elder years I know that doctors will tell you that it's absolutely normal to lose a portion of cognitive skill as you age and I agree but I also want you to know that you don't have to accept that as your destiny you can believe what Bible what the scripture says I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind whose heart is stayed is fixed on me God said one of the benefits of keeping your mind on me is I'll help you to have calmness I'll help you to have wholeness I'll I'll help you to to live in a place of of Peace instead of worry and anxiety folks we need that every one of us need that the calm and undisturbed mind and heart are the life and the health of the body but Envy jealousy and wrath are like rottenness of the bones the reason why the writer chose the bones is because the bones are the foundation of the whole body and if you have something like osteoporosis and your bones start being brittle and you start losing your bone mass then the rest of the body starts sort of caving because it's the foundation that holds everything together and so the writer is saying if you keep your mind and your heart calm and undisturbed and you don't let envy and jealousy Rule and reign in your life your foundation will remain strong and rottenness will not start working on the root of Who You Are does anybody sound think that sounds pretty good I don't want any rottenness working in me amen although many people consider envy and jealousy synonymous they actually have distinct meanings and I want to show you just a a very brief difference in the two words because if any of this has room in your life I want you to let the Holy Spirit get it out today not Tuesday not next Sunday I want you to let the Holy Spirit I want to let the Holy Spirit get this out of me today right now I want this thing to come to an end amen so let's look at Envy first Envy is the longing or painful feeling to have what someone else has whether it be attributes or possessions now Envy is never a positive word jealousy is a word that biblically has a redeemable meaning right because you can be jealous for the things of God passionate because the root word that's used to translate uh jealousy is actually the word that says Zeal so you can be zealous for God jealous for the things of God but Envy is not a redeemable word So when you say I envy her long hair that's not redeemable you may not mean any harm by it you may be trying to compliment her and here's how you do that let me show you how you do that you say oh my your hair is so beautiful I just wanted to tell you your hair is so beautiful you don't say I envy your hair because Envy is never a word that means something positive it's always negative so when you say Envy I envy your hair you're saying I really wished I had it and you don't you didn't somebody said well when I say that I always say I wouldn't want to take yours but I would like to have some just like it why don't you just say I really like your hair your hair is beautiful then you keep your heart out of it you're guarding your heart by not wishing you had it when it belongs to someone else is anybody with me Jesse are you with me he's very alert Steven's helping him probably but he's very alert Envy is the distress or resentment we feel when others have I'm going to need some water what we have not I got a hole in my shoe and someone else has a new pair every week you don't want that in your heart so here's what you say I really like those shoes if you do don't lie don't say anything some people will never pay compliment to anybody else but go home and tell their husband no one said a word about my new Drive finally get a new dress and nobody says anything about it well are you a person who compliments other people oh I'm preaching now are you someone who compliments other people some people think the only form of complimenting is to emulate and say they go out and copy instead of telling you I love your dress they just go buy one like it now I want you to know when you're modest there's only so many dresses available and it's bound to happen that someone's going to have the same outfit but I wouldn't do it on purpose if I were you I wouldn't I I wouldn't want to especially if I hadn't have said to my friend you you look beautiful in that I've even heard people be so complimentary to say you you look beautiful in that dress and and and I have a wedding in in Ohio and and would you mind very much if I bought a dress just like that and War to the wedding in Ohio and and you're supposed to say why that would be wonderful I I I think I think that'd be a great idea and then when you get in the car you're supposed to say that again to your family and not something else can you believe the nerve of that woman oh this is just silly preaching this morning mm you see the Holy Ghost goes home with you he knows how you tell somebody it don't matter in five minutes later it matters you don't want that in your heart you you know it wouldn't hurt any of us to be more complimentary toward one another and mean it flatter is sin to to say something uh flattering about someone uh pay someone a compliment that you don't mean that's flattery just shut up but if you mean it if you can sincerely say it it's a blessing to hear let me tell you something there there there are most people in this room can say that there has been a time in your life that it really meant something to you when someone said you've you've you've lost some weight you got to be careful with that one you got to be very delicate with that one but but it's just a nice thing sometime when you have starved yourself and someone says my you've lost a little weight haven't you instead of instead of across the room going you know the only people that resent when someone else is losing weight it's when they're not ain't that the truth we should compliment one another and mean it from our heart it's what brothers and sisters Sisters in Christ do you you families ought to practice it it it's just it's just right it's just right and it helps keep Envy out of your life when you celebrate other people's victories it helps keep Envy out of your life oh brother would you show me your new vehicle I'd like to have a look at it I'm so God bless I'm so glad God blessed you with that you needed a safe vehicle for your family that's I'm just helping you learn I'm just giving you some crib notes just write them down and read them off the card when you don't know what to say to somebody instead of letting the enemy won't he do it you you're looking at me like I'm the only sinner in the room but we struggle like this sometime and and it's not it's not the will of God Envy is the distress or resentment we feel when others have what we have not envy is Envy feels like oh I want that you can have it if you learn to celebrate somebody else it's a key yes James tells us we read it earlier but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work that word that is translated envying there is actually the word that's used for jealous so in some of the places the word is translated synonymously but there is a difference and here it is jealousy if you're jealous if you're envious you want what somebody else has if you're jealous you feel threatened protective or fearful of losing one's position or situation to someone else in en is wanting what somebody else has jealousy is feeling overly protective of what you have because you perceive that someone else wants to get it do you see how these things can work pretty close together how many of you see the difference I don't want to move forward until you can Envy is wanting what somebody else has jealousy is when you feel threatened somebody wants your wife brother that'll make anybody jealous well not anybody because some people might actually be wanting to give their wife away but that would make most people feel quite threatened to feel jealous means to feel threatened insecure or protective of something you already have especially in a romantic sense you you you've got to come to a place in in a relationship where you understand that as a as a young lady that every every young lady out there is not your competition there's at least one person for everybody it seems and you're going to have to understand that people can have friends and sometimes they're of the same gender and of course there's lots of protective measures that have to be put in place so that so that there is nothing to worry about if you're going to have a friendship with someone of the opposite uh gender you're going to have to be very careful especially as a married person or as a spoken for person you you'll have to put some some boundaries in place but it's possible and it's doable and if you only want him sometime why do you let it bother you that somebody else wants him am I doing okay let's go on wouldn't you hate for this to be your first Sunday in Alabama jealousy feels like back off I just wanted you to know what jealousy feels like back off this one's [Music] mine that's okay if she is that's okay if he is but don't you assume anything hello jealousy is also very closely tied to a feeling here's the root don't throw anything at me this is the root it's closely tied to a feeling of being less than we don't feel threatened if we feel confident but when we don't feel confident in our relationship or in ourself then we feel threatened by who whoever trolls whoever Trends whoever moves around the Bible is so clear and I'll show you this sometime the Bible is so clear you'd be surprised how many times the word jealousy appears how many times the word envy appears and it almost always appears in the context of Christian Life is't that crazy the Bible has little to say about Sinners being envious or or ungodly men being jealous the Bible mainly talks about Believers Christians spirit filled folk dealing with Envy I want what you got I recently heard a pastor introduce an evangelist a speaker in his church and he did it so factiously that I sensed there was something deeper going on he sings better than I do he preaches better than I do come on preach for us it was just kind of the attitude we've all probably said I've said before you know this this brother's the whole package he preaches and sings Come on but to but to come across sarcastic factious it's usually because there is something there why didn't he just say let me introduce you to a newer model than I because that's really what he's going through he thought that it would be a appropriate to sort of belittle to remind everybody how important he is you know the one thing I hear about brother brandom never having the opportunity to meet him I remember calling Brother Cleveland up on the phone one night late and I said Brother Cleveland promise me one thing what is that brother Shelly I want you to take me to a service where brother brandham is I don't have to have a conversation I just want to be in the room with him and I sure would love to shake his hand and he said brother Shelly I'm so sorry to tell you but brother brandham died in 1965 three years before I was born I had no idea I'd never heard the name until I heard the sermon I I remember that feeling I I remember what that felt like how disappointed I was sometimes people will take a sense of of of uh being funny and they mean something more and you sense that they do and they're covering up for their own hurt or their own woundedness and that's a great opportunity for you and I to cover that situation with a lot of Grace and with a lot of love are you with me I'm going to back off of I was going in a direction I'm going to pull back so that we can close jealousy is a sense of dread or suspicion we feel when what we have what we have might be taken away there's such a thing as God L jealousy but the Bible never speaks of Envy in a good light if you recognize that someone is envious or jealous of you it's not a good feeling if that feels good to you there's probably something else going on in your life that needs a checkup no one wants to live their life tiptoeing around fragile envious jealous people why don't we teach our children that for instance every family just doesn't have the same thing in life it just doesn't happen that way but it's not good to be envious or jealous it's good to be thankful to be grateful to be blessed by what God has given us and I Clos the last message I preached with this statement that a lot of people have have struggled with but the reality is that many times God will give you what he can trust you with so if we work on our character then God can often trust us with more for instance in the Bible we have aen aen must have thought a lot of himself because he thought the rules didn't apply to him aen yielded to selfishness and concern only for me and mine as long as as I get the nice trip as long as I have the Babylonian wedge of silver in my tent for rainy days as long as as I get the filet it doesn't matter how I get it as long as I can keep up hirs I want you to know that is a devil that has to be dealt with achen was concerned about me and mine with no concern for others with similar needs and opportunities didn't think about other families I'll take it all when no one's looking achen was self-promoting and here's the thing about someone who promotes themselves they never do it by just building up who they are the only way they can build up who they are is to pull everybody else down aen was self-promoting and possessive without regard for Direct ctions given by the leadership he was a loner with little accountability he paid dearly for his selfishness and here's the key when God helps you out of selfishness and he will he will he will he can and he will don't ever cover it up don't ever try to make it less than it was because in order to do that you'll have to lie and the truth is supposed to come out of our mouths as Believers remember sometime when we're bragging about what we have had or what we have known remember that sometimes it was at other people's expense and we should be a little careful how we build it up without telling the whole story because somebody knows the whole story somebody knows the whole story the whole picture don't get under the burden of selfish ambition let God do the work let him exalt let him lift up in the modern Church everybody has to have a title they put it on their business card Apostle so and so Prophet so and so uh intercessor so and so you you you don't have to have a title just yield to God let God have his way in your life and if you're to be promoted guess what he knows how to promote us I want to I want to get ready to have the musicians to come before I do I want to read a a couple three four paragraphs from the future home in paragraph 88 brother bam said you can't repent for what Adam done you never done it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what you done you follow that may not be perfect English but you got it didn't you the old nature is still there when somebody has to constantly tell you how much money they make the old nature must still be there it must make them feel good to flaunt to brag don't let that be who you are brother vam said let me take this board just a minute and he draws an illustration on the Blackboard here is a human heart he said now I'm a long ways from being an artist here's the human heart and here's the human heart he puts two there now this one over here has a snake in it he said that's sin here he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has a life well this one here the one with the snake he has malice hatred Envy that's what's causing it this fellow here what's he talking about the snake the old nature the sinful nature well this one over here has love joy longsuffering that's what does it down here the dove the presence of the Holy Spirit how many of you know we need more oh yes oh yes we need more the Holy Spirit we need more of the Holy Ghost in our life can I hear you say Amen Jesse can I hear your amen Jesse good had to call him twice now when you are asked or you're forgiven of your sins you've only done this taken that away and he erases but the thing that oh excuse me he didn't eras yet but the thing that made you do it is still there let me start over now when you are asked or you are forgiven of your sin you've only done this taken that away the attributes but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there notice then you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins notice then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind find an order woo for Holiness I like the way that's expressed to think right I want to think right Lord sanctification is a p compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service I like it he said then the next comes the baptism of the fire and holy ghost that God might dwell dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin it erases the serpent it puts the Holy Ghost Inside the gentle Dove then we bring forth the same life that this did the dove because that's in us how many of you understood the simple uh way that brother brandom explained that in this message you may you may get rid of some things but it's the nature it's the root of that thing you've got to go right down to the root of it and you've got to choose to keep moving in the opposite spirit I will not be envious of what God blesses somebody else [Music] with I I I refuse you you've got to get determined you may even have have to get a little mad I am determined when I pray I don't want to limit God's blessing in your life I want it to come to you in abundance somebody said why because you get a little portion of it no because it's what brothers desire for one another it's what sisters desire for one another is to see you Paul said to to G I would that thou wouldest prosper and be in good health even as your soul prospers I want to see you prospering from the inside out amen if you've got a new newer iPhone than I do I'm glad you figgled away to get it maybe you found a payment plan that's how I've always paid for my phones still do maybe you found a payment plan I'm not going to be jealous of that in fact the truth is you get it first and then all the bugs will start getting worked out of it I'll get mine a little later don't you let somebody said you know there's no adult in this church is jealous over a phone don't be so sure the devil's so dumb he'll stir dumb things up in children of God sir come on be careful how you want what somebody else has sir it's a dangerous thing to get a hold of it's a dangerous thing to get in your life well is that a is that a new uh is that a new um iMac I I i' like sure would like to have one of those myself you know folks sometimes we ought to just keep our heart on what God has given us and be blessed root it out root it out grub it out are you still with me musicians are coming the lamb and the dove the person that would impersonate something is the most miserable person that I know of isn't it much better just to be yourself then you don't have to lie to your wife you you don't have to lie to your children you don't have to lie on your job he said like Congressman Upshaw used to say don't try to be nothing that you hate he said well that's pretty good don't try to be nothing that you are not just be yourself and then if you want to be a Christian just ask Christ he'll take your own nature out he'll put a new nature in then you don't have to impersonate anything it's just your normal life that you're living Christianity is not a put on it's an overflow of what's happening in the inside and as long as you've got malice and envy and strife all these things of the world then you know Christ isn't there there's one thing you and I need to remember and that is the Dove and the snake never live in the same place the snake has to go for the for the dove to live now the dove will light he'll temporarily park in your life brother brandom taught us that that the Holy Ghost baptism you you can have the Holy Ghost on your flesh and not on the inside of the inside we want him to come from the inside of the inside which I preach biblically is the spirit many friends preach that biblically it's the soul but the soul biblically is that part of you that stands between flesh and spirit that's where the mind and the will and the emotions are how many of you know you want the Holy Spirit to come and regenerate the Fallen nature of your inner man and you want him to start winging his way outward Holy Ghost Dove get in my mind get in my will get in my emotions you don't just want him on your flesh you want him to come from the inside out and so he might light the dove May light on you but you don't want him just to sit on your shoulder you don't want him just to temporarily and occasionally affect you emotionally you want him to come from the inside of who you are the seed of who you are and work his way out so that the serpent can no longer live in the control tower of your life the Bible said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's not even in you see cuz the life of God isn't in you the life is in there it just produces itself it just lives its way out ain't that good we need that don't we in closing last one I I I give you my word the uncertain sound one paragraph and yet the man somewhere down in him somewhere in him if he could only let that as I Illustrated like a button remember I read this to you a few months back it's like a button when a man is saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make him quit doing what's wrong now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that little button like just a little portion of the light and power of God guess what'll happen it'll keep expanding it'll keep growing and growing and growing and growing and guess what what it does it crowds out unbelief it pushes out the envy you start finding out that somebody's going to get a new house and your heart starts leaping and you say thank you Jesus I assume my brother and sister are tithe payers and God's just keeping his promise to open the windows of heaven and pour them out a blessing and when you can get to that place that's that little button of Light and Power in you beginning to grow and push out all the rest of the go and you don't do it by by its exhortations of bodily exercise you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you I caught some of it in a place where where not long ago and he goes on to talk about some other things how many of you believe you've at least got a little button of light in you you've repented let's stand you've repented you've called on the Lord and he's brought you somebody said a mighty long way how many of you have come a mighty long way since you've been journeying for Jesus and how did you get here folks you got here by the grace of God and how are we going to get to the rest of it by the grace of God how are we going to get to the place where we have no Envy in us and no jealousy in us one of the ways to overcome jealousy is just start thanking God for what's in your life Lord thank you for my wife Lord thank you for my children Lord thank you for so that if someone comes nosing around you don't have to be afraid they not going anywhere and if you've got Envy going on and you just start let me tell you just start praising him for what he has given you that's right go back and remember a time when the refrigerator was almost empty and now the refrigerator goes out brother uh David we have to go run around trying to find you had an extra one to grab and bring home we we grabbed we have a freezer and a refrigerator still in the house but they were full so we had to start getting ice chest together because we had a part of a freezer in the fridge to go out and we and and I said look at this stuff we had five four or five big ice chests refrigerator full a freezer full and we're panicking because refrigerator goes out I remember a time that I could open that refrigerator door sometime in my life and and there was no no real uh dilemma over what to cook or what to eat or what to fix it was real simple you just went to the cabinet and opened the can cuz there wasn't but three it's eeny meeny miny mo and now something like that happens and we we've got more food than we know what to do with have to start giving food away so that it doesn't spoil focus on that focus on how God has brought you through focus on the fact that if you weren't always able to buy something new for your children that somebody thought enough of you to pass something to you not out of pity but out of just Brotherly Love why why take I tell my family all the time why take any and please please if you work for Goodwill please don't be mad at me if you're watching this or if you work for the thrift store but I tell my family all the time why take it to the thrift store find out if there's somebody in the church that can use it and if they turn their nose up at it offer it to somebody else I I got a I got a a new uh cup I go with a cup all the time I carry it with me just about everywhere I go if I come to your house I usually bring my own cup not because I think you don't wash your dishes but I just keep my water cup with me all the time and mine leaked it leaked because it's not made to to walk around with it like this yes it's supposed to stay UPR right so I found me one while I was gone that you just turn a little valve and it locks and you can turn it upside down my wife don't have to mop the floor when I leave to come to church anymore my wife bought we I bought her a new one too and she said I'm throwing that thing away because it leaks if you don't hold it up right it leaks and and and and I said I'm not going to throw mine away I'm going to find somebody that don't have one and I'm going to tell them you got to hold it up it's a straw and boy my kids they got on to their mother they said what do you mean throw that away let's find somebody that doesn't have one and give it to them that's because it ought to be a part of who we are to think about one another amen wow that's incredible preaching I think that in itself earn ear me a vacation right there Lord help us we are humble before you Lord Jesus we are absolutely nothing without you nothing on our on our best behavior we fall short of the glory of God but there is a light a button of light and power that you placed inside of us and as we near the end it's growing it's growing it's growing it's expanding and it's pushing out unbelief and it's helping us deal with envy and jealousy it's helping us deal with iniquity it's helping us be be whole and be clean and be well and be sound before your presence oh God it's helping us not to be in competition with Brothers but to prefer one another in love and oh God it's throwing out our cold love and we come to you right now and ask that you would give us more grace and more grace to Grub out the very root the very bitterness that likes to grow by the power of the Holy Spirit today Lord let us dig that out by the root and cast it from our lives once and for all fill us with with brotherly kindness fill us with perfected love mature love where mature love is where perfect love is fear cannot exist where the dove has taken possession the serpent cannot live so we surrender more of who we are to the character of the dove Lord help us would you just stretch your hand toward him just a moment Lord help me I can't perform I can't strive and get there but I can yield and so I just yield to you right now come Holy Spirit Come spirit of God and Rule and reign in my life Jesus Jesus Ben come and lead us in a
