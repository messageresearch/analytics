Description:
In this powerful sermon, Bro. Duane Jackson calls believers to holiness and readiness as vessels for the Holy Spirit. Drawing from 1 Corinthians and 2 Kings, he emphasizes that we are the temple of God, and He cannot dwell in an unclean vessel. Using vivid analogies, Bro. Jackson urges the congregation to continually position themselves for a fresh filling of the Holy Spirit, allowing God to cleanse and use them for His glory.

an opportunity to give unto the Lord tonight with an offering unto the Lord for the expenses of this meeting give as giving unto the Lord they wanted me to tell you that uh I apparently made it sound like that there was no parking down below there and that they saw too many of our uh seniors walking last night but there are plenty of parking spaces down there so you do not have to walk down the hill and then back up the hill and it's a little bit chillier tonight so you may want to just drive your vehicle down there if you are classified as a senior or a visitor the visitors are welcome to do that too some of us home younger folks will walk down uh I don't know if I am in that category anymore but I'll still walk down younger [Laughter] how you feel well I'm only [Laughter] [Laughter] 25 so Ian and jubel we're gonna let these two young men stand in the same spots that brother Jonathan and brother ellias were standing last night each with an offering bag will give you opportunity to give as giving unto the Lord let's just pray and ask the Lord to bless your giving father I thank you for this group of people that are here tonight and Lord even the ones out over the stream that give we just want to bless them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all that is given may it be multiplied for the purposes of the kingdom of God that we can bless your servants and that we can see that all the needs of this camp meeting or met we give you honor and glory and praise because we know you are our provider and it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen the Lord bless you as you come and give to the Lord tonight this is an old hymn I love to sing because I am redeemed I glad to know tonight that I've been redeemed by the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that's right sweet is the song I'm singing today I'm redeemed I'm redeemed trouble and sorrow have vanished away I have been I have been redeemed oh I'm redeemed by love divine Oh Glory Glory Christ is never my all to him him I now resign I have been I have been redeemed great is my joy as onward I go I'm redeemed I'm redeemed all the way home word my Praises shall flow I have been I have

anybody here tonight redeemed you know that your name is [Music] there oh I'm so glad I know that my name is there you can be seated just a moment we're we're not just talking about uh the sinner's prayer there's nothing wrong with that that's how we all start but we're not singing about the sinner's prayer tonight uh that's all it takes the Bible said whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved that's what the word said we're not talking about that when we sing I'm redeemed we're talking about being carried all the way back to the original thoughts of God concerning our lives that's more that's more you have to be his in the first place to be redeemed I'm glad I know that my name was written down not in the altar the night I prayed but before the foundations of the world were ever laid my name was there somebody said well then you didn't have a choice or I had a choice and I made my choice but he chose first that's just what the scripture said he saw my choice and by his for knowledge he predestined he predetermined that I would belong to him therefore I don't just find Salvation by the sinner's prayer by Redemption I'm carried all the way back whatever God saw that I was going to finish on this Earth I will will finish whatever God saw you doing at the end of your you're going to make it all the way you're going all the way to the end of your race some of us may meet it earlier than others you're not going out of here one second before the Lord has determined you to go I will not preach about a God who has created an enemy more powerful than himself I didn't give my life for that I have given my life to declare a sovereign God who never makes a mistake now the devil would like to maim us he would like to distract us he would like to us he would like to burden us but I want you to know there's there is a people on the Earth that he cannot kill so when you hear I'm gone don't you go telling somebody the devil cut his life short especially when I'm not that wouldn't make sense would it but don't you be telling that you say he finished the course and the Lord took him I hear message you know quote unquote let me do the air what do they call that air quotation mark let me do air quotes whatever that means that was a little stiff anyway uh you know I I hear them talk about if it would have if if he would have just had a better doctor if it just wouldn't have been in that hospital if they just hadn't to misdiagnosed him in the first place oh that's not the that's not what I'm on that's not the journey I'm running after I know that we our our minds try to find a way to justify what we're walking through but we can't leave the word we've got to stay on that word how many of you were blessed last night didn't we hear from the [Applause] Lord Brother I don't know what people were expecting brother Joe but but maybe not much you know why I'm saying that because so many people said I was so surprised I I don't know why anybody was surprised but we were so blessed and I don't think that's because they had low expectation I think they were thinking about it being the first night you know so you got to wait you you mean you got to do trial runs for two or three nights before you get in there and here oh lord of Mercy you know uh we used to have two weeks anybody remember we used to have two weeks of camp meeting Sunday to Sunday to Sunday why this new generation this Young Generation you wouldn't last by the middle of the second week we'd be hauling you in in a wheelbarrow we would in the heat in the [Music] sawdust I was carried out a time or two myself but oh what fun it was I'm so glad it's more concentrated now and we can start off the first night like we did last night my God is good give him a [Applause] praise Hallelujah nobody turned in a song and that's usually because everybody waits until the meeting's almost over and then it sometimes people want to choose the night you sing don't wait if you've got a song The Lord's laid on your heart don't come tell us when you're going to sing it tell us you've got a song on your heart and let's trust that the Lord will get it in the right slot but if you all wait till the to Saturday or Sunday we might not have time but I'm glad you didn't turn in one [Music] tonight I was standing on a mountain I was looking toward toward the sky when I saw a storm approaching and I feared that I would die I saw God's creatures run and seek a better place to hide I heard the Thunder roll down in my soul then I bowed my head and cried now the clouds were moving faster and there was lightning for flashing bright oh and the clouds were so dark they hid the light of the sun and it seemed that it was night oh but all at once there was a feeling like I'd never had before and up above that storm you should have heard me sing God had given me he go wings now let's pick it up and sing it all together so spread your wings little e and fly oh you weren't born to Peck around in an Old Valley no sir you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirit low to the ground just mount up with wings little e go and fly maybe

that we are able to do that this evening we can't do it in our own power that's right but we can do it through his power this evening oh my it's so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight yes sir just to to feel his presence I told I told Brother Steve I've just been kind of emotional today I woke up this morning early and was sitting down at the table to to study and just a wave of the Holy Spirit just just just met me right there at the table this morning I was sitting there crying and and just rejoicing and repenting and asking God to to move me out of the way I have no Des desire for him to use my ability because I have none but if he can use my vessel tonight right that's my only desire and that needs to be every one of our desire this evening for us to move out of the way that he can come and and use our vessel amen and if we'll allow him to do that marvelous things marvelous things will take place in this service tonight um I don't mean to keep you standing long but um brother Steve thank you for the invitation to come and and um uh I I'm very humbled to uh to stand before the The Blood Bought purchase of of God that's it and I I'm so thankful to have this opportunity um I as I've told you before I don't bring anything new I I was brother Joe I was so blessed last night in the service and and just just having that that anointing that was in this place last night and and I I I I told my wife as I sat down there and sat down to edabit I said how do you follow that I mean but it's the same holy spirit it's the same Holy Spirit I I I'm not brother Joe I'm not brother Steve and you all know me by now but um uh you know I I can't bring things the way they bring it but I just want to get out of the way tonight let him speak it's not me speaking it wasn't brother Joe speaking last night it was the Holy Spirit that came down and spoke to us and and also I want to say sister Sharon thank you so much for allowing us to to stay in your home this week it has been such a blessing you know when you go and you you stay in in hotels I I understand more and more why brother brandom many times would have to go and change hotels they would say I can't stay here cuz there's spirits that that are staying in those places but whenever you can enter into a home you can enter into a home and you feel the presence of God that's right you you know you don't have to have your guard up it's just like whenever I listen to the message I don't have to put my guard up you go in your vehicle and you turn a radio on and you're just flipping through radio stations you better be careful right come on cuz you got to guard what's coming into your ears but if you can sit down and I have this little thumb drive that I put in my truck and I leave it in my truck soon as I fire my truck up guess what there's a prophet's voice that's speaking to me I don't have to guard it right because I know whatever comes through there is going to be edifying to me and I don't have to guard it like I I don't want to keep you standing standing for too long thank you so much for the music this evening God bless the musicians let's let's give them a a praise offering [Music] [Applause] tonight I'm telling you I've told you before you don't know how blessed you are you you just maybe you do but I think many people don't realize how blessed you are and and how how intrical it is to a service for the musicians the ministry of Music it it's exactly what it is a Ministry of Music look throughout the scriptures whenever different ones when when David was struggling or when different ones were struggling and they needed to break through the spirits that was B binding them up did they call for a preacher did they call for the prophet no what did they call for men a prophet called for a Minstrel right because it's through the music that breaks those bonds it opens up our ability to enter into his presence so we we we're not giving them praise we're not we're not trying to we're just thanking God that he's allowed them to yields to him this evening I would ask you if you would to turn with me tonight to the book of First Corinthians chapter 3 and um I'd like to read for you um verses 16 and 17 and if you'd be okay could we just could we just take a moment to to approach the author before we Minister his word Heavenly Father oh God I feel your presence tonight Lord I have felt you near me all day name God I ask that you would anoint my mouth do it tonight Jesus Lord let it not be my words that are spoken but God as you did the prophet Moses that you placed your words in his mouth sir I ask you tonight God would you come down one more time oh Lord let me move out of the way and let you place your words in my mouth that I may just deliver what you would have said to your children tonight in Jesus name we pray and we thank you for it amen amen I would say forgive me but I'm not going to say forgive me amen First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 16 and 17 it says know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy Holy which Temple ye are which Temple ye are the temple is to be holy is to be kept holy amen you may have your seats this evening I chose not to to sing a song because I didn't want to take up more more of my time so um sometimes um as brother brandham said it takes me a while to get started and then a a longer time to find where to stop so um we just we just want to say what God would have have said as our brother last night was was ministering and and talking about finishing the race right and and and my mind was going to what the Lord was was drawing me to and and this morning just just dwelling on it even more and I I I want to I want to speak to you this evening on make the vessels full Oh Yes sounds good to me make the vessels full you know what what good would it be to to have continued to run that race he was referring to carrying the Baton you're trying to pass it one to another that that partway through the race that you lay the Baton down what what good is it to finish finish the race at that point right because you you got there at the end at the finish line and became empty-handed right you know I I was thinking over that and maybe it'll it'll it'll come to you a little bit more through I I I also want to read out of 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 16 through 18 and I don't think I have all those verses written down down but um I can did I say 16 or 14 14 I'm sorry I did want to start with 14 as you get older you uh you forget what you told people and um I had sent my notes to um sister charity and so she has them better than I do um which is wonderful um starting with verse 14 be ye not une equally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with bile tell us or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel verse 16 in what agreement hath the temple of God we just said are ye are the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people I I I was reading in in the message 1959 um what was the Holy Ghost given for and I I came across this just just the other day it said brother R said and and I thought when I see a woman walk down the street with herself all carried out like that and men's clothes on come on now that's what it looks like to God yes sir yes it's an Abomination what he saying something that's filthy and stinking before God yet she'll go to church on Sunday and decorate up yes sir they'll go a man down there and drink and cheat and love money and cheat his neighbor and everything else to get a little extra money and do these things and Gamble and smoke and drink and lie then goes to church and testify Brown says Abomination filthiness he said that's the intellectual church that's the intellectual church and a lot of churches today want you to become an intellectual Church they want to do away with signs and wonders they want they want to do away with the actual power of God and they want you to keep it all up in your mind and say as long as I can say that I believe it and I've read it and I go to this church or I go to that church or I've got this on my wall or I'm wearing this type of tie or I've got this type of belt buckle or any of those type of things that I'm okay well that's intellectual thinking that stinks before God it it does not equate to a life lived it does not equate to Having the Holy Spirit dwelling within you all it means that you that you've heard somebody say something and you've chosen to follow that path but it does not mean that you have the Holy Spirit living you if you have the Holy Spirit dwelling inside of you there will be demonstrations of his power that comes forth from your life tonight it's not just going to be words on paper no sir it has to come off of the pages of this book and it has to live and dwell within you and then it has to produce his life not your life it does not it don't even need to produce the life of William bradam it needs to produce the Life of Christ for too many years and I've been around for almost as long as brother Steve not quite he's a bit older than I am but for too many years I heard brother Brandon brother Brandon brother Brandon brother God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet that's wonderful wonderful I love that God sent a prophet I believe it 100% that he sent a prophet tell me what he said and how that's going to get me closer to Christ that's what I need to know if he brings me a message all I need to know is how is that message going to explain this in Greater detail and let my life draw closer to Christ and become like him if we fa if we fail to become like Christ we will not make it I don't care that you can quote all 1200 and however many sermons that that he preached that doesn't matter you can sit here and quote every single scripture out of the Bible right if it's just left on pages it does not mean anything it must be a life lived not your life lived no it must be his life lived praise the Lord hallelujah whatever you when you when when you look at the word Temple when we were reading in the in the the scriptures there in Corinthians and it's talking about us being a temple yes sir the Greek word that was used there is n naos is a dwelling of God n a oos naos if I pronounced it correctly I believe I am um it's a dwelling of God is the inner part of a temple right is referring to the holy of Hol so he's equating in Corinthians he's equ equating your life my life to now be the holy of holies it's not just the temple in it the the the outer Court not the inner Court there's a place for the outer Court there's a place for the inner court but he is referencing that our body is to be the no it is to be the holy of holies do you I don't know how many I I know brother Steve has has studied many times on on the on the holy of holies and I'm sure that he's discussed it with many of you but you ever stop and consider that if your body is now equated to the holy of holies sir does not it make us look at oursel and say I need to clean myself up it certainly should there was only one that would go into the holy of holies one time a year I believe you you just celebrate yam Kapur if I I'm not y yam ker the day of atonement that was just this past weekend I believe that was signifying the one time that the priest would go in behind the veil that's right to the holy of holies everything had to be in order order yes right everything everything about His Garment everything about his life it had to be completely clean Sanctified for him to enter in to the holy of holies and come out alive amen but yet we live our life so haphazardly to us we go in and out of places that we should never ever subject oursel to because we are supposed to be the naos the holy of holies our body is to be that Temple that level that's what he equated us to and yet we treat it so haphazard we we allow so many things to come into our eyes that's right we allow so many things to enter into our ears and those things are defiling the temple go back and read what he says if you defile the temple right him will God destroy exactly come on Sir so it behooves us tonight to pay attention that's it to our life pay attention to what we are bringing in through our the inlets of our eyes our ears the conversations that we that we have the places that we go Ste the truth we are supposed to be the temple of God but I don't think we're acting like it most of the time come on now help us now I I told you this this morning it was it was emotional for me to to to sit down and I was I was reading over the scriptures and God was dealing with me and he's like boy good pre thank you there's days that your temple is not as clean as it needs to be it ain't as clean as it needs to be and how do we think that we we sat here and we let all this trash in our lives in our homes and then we say that we're inviting God to come and take residence there I I can tell you from experience in my own natural home my house if I get a call from somebody and says hey we're going to come over we're 5 minutes down the road you know what happens usually we become frantic you're like somebody cling that up somebody move that somebody put that back somebody you you become in a in a frantic pace of I don't want them to enter into my natural house and it be in disarray but we come to church with trash in our life hatred in our heart bitterness grudges all types of malice and we say feel my cup Lord feel my cup Lord and he looks down and he says not in that condition not in that condition you're going to have to be Sanctified you're going to have to be scoured out before he comes in places himself he says I have to take your spirit out of you and then I've got to take another spirit in place it in you for my spirit to then have communion and dwell within you that's the word that's what he says that's that's how it works he's got to do that I have no worry in my notes but that's all right I I've got I've got something with me I didn't know when I might do this but and I'm not sure if this will make sense or not and y'all don't have a big area to these are glass I hope they don't fall stay I'm not promoting McDonald's it's the only clear that's that's it is but you'll see why it works out that this is here I like visuals visuals sometimes help with things now I don't know how many are you are old enough to have went to restaurant sit down restaurants whenever you used to go for breakfast I whenever I was a a 13 years old my first job was working for a little restaurant in town um called the home food shop they had a uh they were they were famous in our town for their breakfast and every you know whenever I was working there I would notice brother Steve that whenever all the tables were set so they came people would come through the line order their food pick up their food and they go down go to the table but the table was already set with the silverware the napkin and a coffee cup had a little plate on there and um this was the position that the cup was when you sat down at the table now they would come around you'd be sitting there eating and the waitresses or the waiters would come around with a pot of coffee in their hand now at this restaurant particularly that I worked at they did not ask you if you wanted coffee if you wanted coffee when you got to the table you turned the cup upright that signified to them as they would come through I want coffee they didn't ask they just they were they were busy because it was a very busy place people coming and going they didn't take the time do you want coffee but you knew and everybody that went there knew if I wanted coffee I had to take my cup from this position and I had to turn it to here I hear you now if that cup stayed right there they wouldn't stop and talk to you they wouldn't stop and say are you sure that you don't want some don't want coffee cuz I want to give you some coffee we made coffee we've made it all morning I really want to fill your cup with coffee sir they would never go to your table and turn your cup upright themselves they're not going to touch your cup they were not going to change the position that your cup was in what they would do is if they noticed that your cup looked like this and the person sitting beside you's cup looked like that they would come to you fill it up this person they didn't even speak to this church come on because they left themsel I'm sorry they left their Cup in a position that signified I don't want to be filled up even want it that's how they spoke they spoke just because of the position of the cup no conversation had to be given people come in and this is the way they live their life exactly and wonder why and they'll be sitting beside side a person that's right here and they'll be like what's the big deal I mean why I mean why why won't they come and talk to me why why don't they come and I mean I'm I'm in church too I came to the same restaurant I sat down at the same table but this person's cup got filled and this person 's cup got bypassed and all they had to do was change their position it's all they had to do change their position to allow themselves to become full see but then you go I have to move this because I don't want to fall and then there's those that sit in a restant like this I'm sry sitting at church restaurant yeah we're talking about restaurants right using a restaurant analogy not I'm not trying to say they sit in church like this but you have some that that that go to a restaurant and they had drink the cup was full and then all of a sudden over time it ran out exactly right will and they they say I want to be like that person I used to have the holy ghost in my life I was full at one time and so then you say well I'd be happy to give you some more and they sit in this condition can y'all see yes sir oh somebody saw it that's right there's a lid on it sir you got your Li and they come in and they sit there and they say fill me up Lord fill me up Lord but they keep the lid on and then the Holy Spirit comes comes through and the Holy Spirit says you know maybe you're struggling so I I I want to fill you up and and and it it starts trying to I'm not just making a fool of myself you might think I am but I am preaching right now you sure are the Holy Spirit wants to fill you up he wants to make you completely whole but the life that we live many times we walk into church and we've closed oursel off at one time we had oil you remember the the the five wise and the five foolish somewhere in my notes I'm I'm so off of my notes right now it doesn't matter see the the the the five wise they had oil in their vessels and they had addition oil at extra oil the five foolish didn't whenever whenever the call come they said give us of your oil CU they they didn't want to they didn't want to be without light they wanted to have they wanted they had a desire and at one time that mean they were all virgins they were all pure they had all been Sanctified that's what it when it talks about the the the Virg it's talks it's describing to us they were all virgins they were all Sanctified but they did not have a continual refilling of the Holy Spirit of the oil that continued to flow that continually flowed it has to you can't go through life saying I was filled with the Holy Ghost 42 years ago I remember and I'm still living off of that experience exactly it has to be a continual refilling of the baptism of the holy spirit it's not just a oneand done you know they they say you could if you sat there long enough you could just continually refill this cup you could take your lid [Applause] off you know and if if you're in a restaurant that that has given you you some of the restaurants especially after uh 2020 they they gave you all tog go cups they didn't give you glasses and all that they they started doing all to go cups and they would put a lid on it and they would have a straw in it and they would bring it out to you and that was your drink to signify to them that you wanted more drink you had to take a lid off I would take it off and I would set it to the side again they were not going to touch your cup it's not up to Brother Steve to come into your life and take your top off of your life and say please let me feel you more he comes brother Wesley comes brother Joe comes these other ministers come to bring the Holy Spirit of the word to come and pour into your life and people come in here and they do this right here and all it does then it gets you wet on the outside you feel a shiver I felt the Holy Spirit that's great on the outside but it ain't doing you as much good as it would if you would allow it to fill up your vessel because then if your vessel is full then you can go and you can pour it out to somebody else and then say Lord fill me up again and I can share it with somebody else and I can keep allowing him to fill my life and I can pour it out and I can help somebody else Romans chap 12 verse 1 if I don't get started we're not even going to get anywhere get started I thought you was started well I'm getting ready to start I beseech you therefore bre by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service it's the least you could do right it's the least the least you can do people will make that comment that it was the least I could do well that's the least we can do is that we can present our bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God 1955 uh the message beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation brother Ram says after his death Bel shazar his grandson succeeded him and then he was more wicked than King Nebuchadnezzar and one night yeah they had a great big party they called all their magistrates and all the officers in for a great big Jamboree and while they were having this Jamboree they went and called out and took the vessels the holy vessels of God just to make fun of God and drink wine to their gods a toast out of the vessels of the Lord Bram says now a man is permitted to travel so far listen but there is a separating line between life and death you must never cross that see you can go on with your little foolishness for a while but you better know better know where the line is he says did the Lord ever check you on anything I can say yes Lord he's checked me on many things he does all of us pull the check reins say that's far enough now I'm so thankful he does that I'm cuz if he didn't and we were left to our own demise we would continue right on going the direction that we were going but he checks you and said that's far enough then you better watch what you're doing from then on if you're stepping across that line I don't ever want to cross that separating line I don't want to get any anywhere near that separating line I want him to check me 50 mil from it I want him to hold me back and say hey stop check yourself see are you lining up with the word or not because if we're not lining up the word lining up with the word we're going to be a complete failure complete failure right right see they they were misusing the vessels of God that that was the time that that the Lord came down and with his finger he wrote and I don't know if I pronounced it right many many tearson somewhere in that it was saying Thou Art weighed in the balance and found wanting anybody ever looked at the balance scales that's what it's talking about you you you come up a bit short you know they they were being judged their life was not leveling out against the balance of of God's word we must be careful that we are not found guilty of misusing right the ve this vessel of God if we're not careful we will misuse his vessel we'll use it for sport we'll use it for things that we want to do whenever he's telling us that's not what I've called you to do with your vessel I've called you to live a Sanctified and a holy life that is given 100% fully over to him that's his desire for us he we we got to get all this out of our head that that this is more important the things of this world is more important to me I I want to become this you have these aspirations I want to become this someday and I want to do this someday why does any of that matter whenever you're talking about eternity it doesn't mean anything lay all those things aside and allow his will that's the one of the hardest statements you'll ever make there's four words thy will be done four of the hardest words that you will ever say Jesus himself had to say those words see some people say that that he you know he he wasn't he he wasn't man he was he was all God he was all God he was all man too and that flesh body that was created to be a sacrifice had a will of its own just like your body has a will of its own right right Paul said I have to mortify the flesh I I have to bring myself under subjection to this word every single day every moment of every day if I don't then it becomes trashy if I don't keep it under subjection to that my life gets filled up with the trash of this world and God will not dwell in an unclean vessel he won't he won't do it he can't he cannot dwell what Concord does he have with bow he cannot dwell in an unclean vessel he refuses to do that so we have to we must clean our life up allow him to take full preeminence that's right that's right full preeminence in our body i i as as I was relating to to brother Joe last night talking about running the race and finishing the race and I I was thinking about the the the the five wise the five foolish what good was it for them the five foolish they ran that race they got there waiting for the bridegroom only to realize they failed one of the most important things they did not have enough oil that's right they did not have what it took they did not have the full baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling within them and if you're here tonight and you don't know that you have the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost living and dwelling inside of you don't leave don't leave sir you don't want to get to the end of the race and him tell like he did oh I got to find it I got to find it oh my my my my my my my um y'all forgive me but I got to I got to find it oh my maybe I've got it Hallelujah y'all forgive me it just it just offended us yet okay he used the word yet I'm not trying to offend anybody um but I don't want to offend the Holy Spirit at all um oh my I probably could I can't I can't search it that fast um oh it it was it somebody help me with the scriptures where it's dealing with the five wise the five foolish MTH Matthew 25 it was right where my it's right here right where this was afterward this is verse 11 I'm not sure if I gave oh did I give that oh wow I can't find it in my notes afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord Lord open to us see they were Sanctified they were cleaned up they had a lamp that's right they're like what's what's different between them and us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not do you really want to run the race to come to the end of the race to hear him say I know you not see that's you getting to the end of the race and you didn't have the Baton in your hand you're disqualified because you did not have the Holy Spirit dwelling in its fullness within you you dropped it along the way somewhere and he says you did run well who did hinder you I heard it for many years you did run well what they said who and then they some people say what did hinder you it's not a what it's a who many times the who is [Applause] you the who is me that gets in the way that's what hinders me is this flesh man that I'm dwelling inside of at the moment but see this is not my home you see this flesh that they call Dwayne Jackson but this is not me can I show you a picture of me that's a picture of me because I have representation dwelling inside of me that was placed there by him that's right that's who I really am if my theophany could step down and you see my theophany that's who I really am brother brandham would say in one place that I don't have none of this in the notes he would say that we you know we stepped we came out we came from arthop and we're going back to it so I was already there right I was already there before the foundation of the world I was already there amen I've got to find find where I was at that's okay Matthew chap 23: 25 through 28 [Applause] wo whoo unto you scribes and Pharisees teachers evangelist pastors Apostles wo to us and that does not take you out of that equation as well for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter I don't have a platter with me but within they are full of extortion in excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also inside out inside out let's be concerned about the inside and as you clean the inside guess what the water is also going to cleanse that outside sometimes we look at people and we don't we we think that their outside is too dirty but we don't stop and think that God is taking the water of his word yes sir when they're sitting in church and he's dealing with the inside of their life that's right it starts and he's cleaning them out word by word by word as it goes forth the washing of the water of the word is cleaning them out give them time give them a moment because you'll start witnessing as the inside is being cleaned oh yes yes sir that outside is going to express what what was on the inside because if that Holy Spirit it continually fills them up guess what there's only a certain place I don't want to do it cuz I don't want to make a mess but there's only so much if I was to start pouring this bottle of water into this cup there's only so much that it can hold inside it becomes super saturated and it'll actually create a little bubble on the top but if I continue to pour it guess where it goes over the edge so just allow them to sit and let that water keep pouring in them don't go to them and say you you don't fit in here because you're doing this and you're and I can see this and I can see this about your life no poor if you've got the holy spirit in you come on give him the word David said my cup runs runneth over and if you if I can get next to somebody whose cup is full and they get under that anointing and I'm under that anointing and that cup is running over guess what that Holy Spirit that they're feeling that anointing that water of the the the word is going to Splash out on me it's going to Splash Cas out on you but you've got to be in that presence and you can't come in and sit down on the preacher you come in like that you ain't going out with nothing you may come in Oh My My My I've got to find it now you know I don't know if a put about the whest seers 27 see I didn't even have that I do I do have that see I've got it in my notes and I just completely forgot about it woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are liked unto Whited seers which indeed appear be beautiful outward man that cup is beautiful they dress right they act right they know quotes they have a cloud on their belt buckle if you got a cloud on your belt buckle that's it's okay which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full full means there's no room for nothing else ain't no room for nothing else no more draps can run in you ever heard that that's a southern saying not a drap ran in not a drap ran out that's I'm back in the hills of North Carolina that's how we talk up there they're full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so ye outwardly appear righteous unto men I'm clean I'm clean you can't put a finger on my life you you I I live my life clean I I don't sin like you other people sin you don't you can't put a finger on my life but see inside it's full of uncleanness they've dressed it up on the outside they act the part of a Christian they act the part of a message believer they've learned the lingo they've learned cliches to say this to say that when they're around this person when they're around that person but when they are by themselves come on come on now when they are by themselves yes sir they they're letting all sorts of things in their home I don't even I don't have my iPhone with me it's one of the most evil things that we have is access to technology the way we have nowadays it is so quick of an Inlet for Satan to come into your into your car into your home and if we are not careful we'll allow our Temple our no to become dirty and guess what that Dove does he sets off on a limb somewhere and says whenever I see that it's clean then I'll go back and I'll take up dwelling again but he is not going to dwell in an unclean vessel message revelation of Jesus Christ I hope I'm not tiring you out the vessel that Sanctified on the altar is ready for service service but not in service it's ready for service how many do canning anybody can vegetables or fruits or okay when if you're going to can some green beans let's say that we used to can green beans and tomatoes okra and those type things at what point do you choose to clean the jars and to sanctify to scour them out what time do you what at what place what time do you do that you do it before but you do it right before yeah you don't put your your your you don't boil the water and get your jars all clean and say well next season I'm going to put I'm going to use them again no now you do clean them after you use them and you store them away but when it's time for them to be used again you get them out and you sanctify that vessel and then you immediately fill it and then you seal it it's not it's not I'm going to get it cleaned up and I'm going to let it sit on the shelf for two weeks no that wasn't how it worked at our house we're in there working with the green beans and we're snapping and we're washing green beans and Mom's like somebody needs to go put the put the the glass jars in the dishwasher so we can we can scour them out and we can make sure they're perfectly clean and then when we got them out we would take and we would wipe them take the top and we would make sure before you put that lid that little seal lid on there you made sure that there was no imperfections of that top of that glass cuz you know what if there was any imperfections if there was anything to prevent vent whenever for it setting on there properly it would not seal properly sometimes it would not seal at all other times you would think that it was sealed it looked like it was sealed but then you would go to open it up 6 months later and you realize it's ruined because there was just a little bit of sand or a little bit of something in between the glass jar and that seal that was sitting there and you did all that work and you were expecting I'm going to open up that can of green beans and I'm going to put it and we're going to have green beans for supper tonight and then you realize it was ruined because you did not fully get it [Music] clean just the slightest the smallest there there was a statement that brother Brown made one time he said that if we doubt a single word of this written word if you doubt a single word it unarm you now why would you go into a battle unarmed doubting one single word one single imperfection in our life prevents the ceiling to take place we he said that he showed brother Perry green he just made the slightest mark one scratch of alt against someone we have to it we have to be completely clean can I tell you can I tell you a little story um out of out of the scripture and somehow I got to we try to wind this up but it ain't going to be right yet see y'all are so easy to preach to and so I'm going to blame it on y'all um I'm skipping some things though I have to um 2 Kings chapter 4 verses 1-7 and this is um this this is an interesting story to me and this is where I I I I got my um my title of of my sermon what came out of these scriptures here now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead all right and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee it was that was her husband's boss you know that's the way I relate it I I look at it that way that was her husband's boss and I've had people come to me before whenever something happened to to one of my employes boys their spouse would come and say such and such such and such and what are you going to do how are you going to help me I I I need help that's what she was expressing and and uh tell me what hast thou Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaiden hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil pot of oil I looked up that word pot I like to look up words and and look at them a little deeper cuz I always in my mind I would Envision a pot I mean I cook in a pot so I'm thinking a pot well the the actual word that is used there is um aluk aluk it's um it's supposed to be a a flask a flask of oil um and I meant to ask you earlier if you had a flask like a flask of oil but I I know you had you had it one time but I think I don't see it up here but so it for you to understand being that he was a priest that would have been something very common to them to have a small flask of oil like anointing oil is what they would have they would have had it could have been used for different things but it was in your mind you might have been thinking like I was it's a big pot I got a big pot sitting over in a corner with a bunch of oil in it that wasn't what it was it was just something very small something minuscule something that was very common to them all then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in Thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out all right into all these vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so she questioned him and said how in the world is this going to happen cuse this all I have is just this little small flask why in the world would you want me to go and borrow vessels a lot of vessels empty vessels how's this going to work no that wasn't what she did she accepted what the man of God told her and she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and she poured out and she poured out and she poured out and it came to pass when all the vessels were full she had vessel upon vessel upon vessel I I just think in my mind how did she convince the neighbors to give up these vessels I mean neighbors are nosy sometimes and I'm sure they're thinking we know she ain't got no money creditors are calling her every single day and she can't afford to pay them and now they're going to come and take what the only thing she has left of any value is her sons they're going to take that so why is she asking to borrow our vessels what's she going to is she going to Pond them off is she going to go try to sell these I mean think think through it I mean these are these are things that happen in her life these people knew her husband died they they saw the life that she was having to live and maybe she was having to scale back and she was barely getting by and and everything was leaving her house because she had no money she had no income she had no way to provide anything more and now she's asking her sons to go out to all the her neighbors and say we need to borrow a vessel why I can't tell you I just need to borrow a vessel you you got an empty one you and and it it couldn't be one that was cracked it had to be a good vessel you know couldn't have the imperfections in it it it had to be a proper vessel but she still did not know how it was going to work it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me another one bring me another vessel bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed so as long as there was a vessel available the oil continued to flow continued to flow as long as there was an available vessel that was in the right position to allow the Holy Spirit that's what the oil represents the Holy Spirit to allow it to become full she did not understand what the messenger told her how it was going to work she and she didn't stop at least in what I read she never stopped and questioned him exactly how is this all going to work but she obeyed IM she obey then she came and told them and of God and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the rest see it was enough it it it God provided enough as long as there was a vessel for him to fill he filled it and whenever all the vessels was full see the problem wasn't with the miracle the miracle was there that was the oil the miracle was in The Obedience of what she was told to do and she followed through with what she was told to do but all that Miracle needed was a vessel to be poured into and all he is asking for tonight is a vessel a temple that he can dwell in he's told us that we are the na we are the holy of holies but he refuses to dwell in an unclean vessel we must allow the word of God to come in and cleanse us of all impurities to come in and sanctify Our Lives to allow him to indwell yes sir because he is not going to cohabitate with sin he refuses to cohabitate with sin and the things of this world but so easily are we convinced by the world that that's what we need to take in and we need to allow that into our lives no push back against that fleshly desire and open up our heart and our life to allow him to fully fill us completely and to make our vessels full it don't need to be partially full it needs to be completely full praise the Lord oh my there was a I was reading is it okay to Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon had this made this comment and I I found it intriguing he said I believe that you and I in the matter of spiritual blessings from God have more to do with the measurement of our mercies than we think we make our blessings little we make our blessings little because our prayers are little see if if she had went out and told her sons just I don't really understand why he's asking us to do this but you know just just go to our our favorite neighbors next door and and see if they have a vessel and if they would have come back and had only one vessel he would have filled that one vessel because he was there to fill it the miracle was there the promise was given to fill that vessel however many vessels they brought was going to be full they did not fully understand that but they had received a promise and they moved on it and I don't know it doesn't tell me how many vessels they actually went but it was enough because they were they were able to to use that sell that oil and take care of themselves going forward so it's enough if you open your vessel up to him tonight he will f it and it's not a one-time feeling right he will continually poor himself every time you come and you open yourself up to him and you say Lord fill my cup fill my cup see you can't come in and say Lord fill my cup all right you can't you can't do that this is a cup when you when you lift your hands up to him and you say father I need you to f my cup make my vessel full tonight I don't want it to be halfway no I hate going to a restaurant and they come in and they hand me my cup of drink on and it comes out to me it looks like that F her up like I paid you for a full glass I would appreciate that you feel it and we're more concerned with a natural drink when we go to a restaurant of making sure our cup is full and then we We complain if it takes the waitress too long or the waiter too long wait person maybe that's what you're supposed to say nowadays I don't know um the if it takes them too long to come back and fill your cup yes sir but we'll go week after week after week after week after month after year with an empty vessel coming into church and we come in and we sit down with our lid on I really wish that he would preach something that that I would that I liked and if he'd preach something that that you know that I really liked I would I might take my lid off and allow allow that to come in it's too late then too late then see the thing is is when we come in we don't we don't have that choice we don't make that choice the choice is his you go out to a restaurant they say do you want Coke do you want Pepsi do you want um Sprite what do you want to drink and and we we tell them I want this and then we don't have that today I asked for ginger ale sorry we don't have ginger ale well I didn't just get up and leave I said well what do you have you have Sprite we have Sprite I'll take Sprite but see people come in church and just because the preacher is not preaching their pet [Applause] Doctrine he's not preaching exactly what they want to hear they shut themselves off and they'll say eh I'm not that thirsty I'm just going to put that off to the side maybe next week I'll come back and see if he's if he's talking about something I really want to hear that's not how it works all we supposed to do is come in and take our cup and say Lord you know what I have need of come on now see the thing is is I don't know what I have need [Music] of I have conceived ideas of what I think that I need and he comes in and says no that's not exactly what you need today today you need scouring out on right now next week he may come in he may pour the put put a bomb of Gilead on you and and and just clean everything up and and make you feel good but this morning or this evening he may say no you need to be Sanctified you've been out in the world this week you've allowed too much trash into your mind and into your home and into your life and what I've got to do this Sunday morning is I've got to scour you out to get you clean so then I can refill you again I'm not saying that that you get the Holy Ghost one you get the Holy Ghost and you don't need any more of him no no no because it has to continually flow it must be a continual refilling in your body my my my Mercy sakes y'all are y'all are so wonderful to to to preach to I I I wrote this note down this morning I sitting at the table I said we can't live in the Quagmire of sin during the week and plan on being in Heavenly places on Sunday morning amen and then we go back back to a Godless home and expect God to be able to move in our lives it matters what's in your [Music] house I'm not the pastor but it matters what's in your house if she had not had that flask of oil yes sir it was probably left to the side she was thinking it was insignificant everybody has it everybody's got that everybody has that that small I mean because he was a he was a priest so why why is that nobody wants it no I can't sell it because everybody has it it's common place but it was that oil that the miracle came through to continually fill up every vessel that was placed before it the House of Prayer for many people think that you're referring to this place House of Prayer starts at home it has to start at home but I think too often we we've considered just the church building as a House of Prayer but it has to be your house your personal home is where it must start when you ever notice when Noah got off the ark the very first thing he did was build an altar right he didn't even have a house but it showed me where his priorities were it was more important to him to have a place to meet God and to hear from him and to worship him and offer his praise and his adoration that was more important to him than a natural dwelling place to live in so what are your priority priorities [Music] today have we prepared our Temple have we emptied out our vessels of the worldly things so that the oil of the Holy Spirit can be poured into US it matters what's in your house it matters how we take care of this vessel you know I had a I had a situation a couple years ago I'm going to try to try to close um in in just a moment um by can share this little story with you had a situation at our house uh a couple years back or so that um on everybody knows what the sopit is on the house and you have a sopit vent that usually is for the exit air from a bathroom vent um at least this one was from that um so a sofit vent had fallen off you over the years it dry rotted and it it fell fell off of it and uh and I noticed that it was it was off and I really didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it I just notice there was a hole up there like the the tube still there it's still it's still exhausting out from the house so I didn't think nothing of it time went on I would see it I'd be outside I'd look up kind of looks ugly I probably should fix that sometime and then I go get busy doing something else completely forget about it some time went by and we had went off on on um well before before that um some time went by and and one day we I get a phone call from My Wife and she's like I hear something when I'm in the restroom I I hear some noise and um I was like why she said it sounds like it's coming from the ceiling area and um I said well well what what it could be I mean and then um the next day I get I think the next day or two I get a phone call she said I hear birds I hear like a bird chirping when I'm I'm in in our bathroom I'm like how are you hearing birds chirping in our bathroom so you know I'm going through my day and I'm like you know what that vent is gone I wonder if a bird has gotten up inside that and created a nest well they had and I was like well that's kind of neat you know neat to have hear the birds chirping and I'm like I really should get up there but I hate to disturb their nest I'm like I really need to get up there and take care of that but I didn't and um time went on and um we had went off this months later I was not taking care of my temple that's what I'm trying to get at so I I we'd went off on vacation and we we came back we've been gone for about a week or so we come back in and um you know if you've been on a long drive one of the first things that you typically need to do is is use the facilities whenever you get home and um so you go into the master restroom and um realize that there's looked like somebody had went in while we were gone and took black pepper and shook black pepper out over top of the toilet area and the floor and I'm like what in the world is this so I go get a bright flashlight and I go in there and I shine this flashlight really bright and it's like that's not black pepper looks like some type of bug so I have a friend of mine who is an exterminator I give him a call and I describe to him he said you've got bird mites I took a picture of it I wonder where how was I supposed to know that they were going to contribute bird mites to our home bird bird mites yeah Bird yeah mhm yeah that's what it was and uh I got pictures of it I can show you sometime I cuz I got I'd gotten down on the floor you know to try to figure out what it was and then when I got back up I realized I had blacks like oh all over my my knees I'm like whoa this it has moved out a lot further than I expected so I had to call my friend they come over he's like you're just going to clean that up we'll spray we'll put you know put stuff up there and that'll kill it and I was like thank you appreciate that and um so I'd shared um i' I'd shared that um I think at our church and um that that went on and and um Brother David sitting back here nodding his head and um he's like so you you fixed the vent right I said not yet I said we got rid of the we got rid of the the the bird mites and made sure that it was it it was killed off and there was nothing up there and and he said U he said uh well you repaired it right and you put a new vent on like well no I didn't and uh I said but I I'll do it sometime I'll do it sometime and you over time time went by and he asked me again one day we actually was at the house I think it was if I remember right and we're back in the backyard and he looks up and he says when you going to fix that hole and I'm like I'll get to it at some point I I finally got the ladder you know as it took take a wrong ladder to get up to the place where it was at and I said just you know it's going to take a couple of people to to go in and replace the stuff and and I said I just haven't taken the time to do it he said you you really ought to get that thing fixed because if you wait too long you're going to have birds make a nest in it next season they're going to do the same thing you going to have the same problem and I said point taken I'll take care of that and I didn't didn't take care of it till one day I was um little little bit later I'm I'm outside working in the yard I'm on my my lawnmower and I'm I'm cutting the yard I love to love to cut the yard and I I'm riding the lawn mower and I'm looking up and I'm seeing that place what no what I done I took some tape sorry I took some tape and covered the hole with some like blue painters tape so every time I would look up I'd see this blue spot on this white sfet I she didn't go back there many times she knew that I hadn't fixed it though and um so I'm I'm out there working with the yard and I'm looking up and I see this blue tape on the soet and all of a sudden the Lord spoke to me riding along you you don't have to believe me but he spoke to me and he said Satan don't care that you recognize that there's a problem with your house in your temple he just does not want you to address it he don't care I could sit there and say I've got a problem I got a problem I got a problem but I didn't fix it Satan is all right with you recognizing right I've got a problem he's okay with you saying there's trash in my in my house Satan says yeah there it is I helped you put it there I encourage you to place it there just don't do nothing about it you can take care of it another day you can take care of it another day and it just keeps getting pushed off and pushed off and pushed off right don't push it off any longer let tonight be the night that you say you know what my vessel hasn't been completely scoured out maybe it has maybe it's been scoured out but you didn't maybe you it was scoured out and then you put a you put a temporary lid on it and said I'll open it up in my time and I'll allow God to come and fill me up in my time he may pass you by he may pass you by but he might be calling out to you tonight to say if you'll simply remove that lid and allow me to come and fully take possession of your life and fill you completely then you'll be able to finish that race you'll be able to finish the race if you've been filled up completely and allow that oil to continually flow in your life but you must be clean we must be clean we must pray and ask God to sanctify us to cleanse us to fill us and to use us

position to allow him to feel it takes you and I to do this part right somebody takes you and I to do this part to position ourself correctly to allow him to come and fill you up completely his desire is to pour himself out all he's asking is would you be a yielded vessel would you let me come and place myself within you so that I might use you see he he's not looking to use you he's looking to use

enough visual to see it and then the presence of God come and say Amen by my melting hearts and touching lives filling and refilling brother brandham said there's one baptism of the Holy Ghost one filling but many refilling we ought to have three or four a [Music] night why not why do we limit it some people say well I'm just waiting I'm just rening in the sun just waiting on the Rapture I'm
