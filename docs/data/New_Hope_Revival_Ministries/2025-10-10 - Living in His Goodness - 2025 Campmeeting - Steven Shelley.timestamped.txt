[39:57] Amen.
[40:06] Lord, we just want to tell you how
[40:07] worthy you are tonight.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Our words say they fall so short
[40:14] of ever being able to express our
[40:17] gratitude to you for your goodness and
[40:20] your love, your mercy. But we want to
[40:24] say thank you Lord and you are worthy of
[40:28] all praise
[40:30] and glory
[40:32] adoration.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:42] [Music]
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need on your heart tonight
[40:47] just by the lifting of the hand? All
[40:50] over the building there are hands I'm
[40:52] seeing going up. We want to remember
[40:54] those that are
[40:57] traveling our way and some will be
[40:59] leaving after the service to travel home
[41:02] tonight through the night. We want to
[41:04] ask God to protect them as they travel.
[41:07] Some will be traveling through the
[41:08] night. And I ask the angels to ask the
[41:11] Lord to let the angels be with them as
[41:13] they're uh traveling. We are expecting
[41:17] God to move among us through the rest of
[41:20] this weekend to move tonight. When we
[41:24] pray, let us remember the situation
[41:27] going on in Israel with the hostages. It
[41:30] it seems that the there has been a a
[41:33] deal that has been made and over the
[41:35] next few days it's supposed to unfold.
[41:38] And we want to ask the Lord to let those
[41:40] hostages, every one of them, both the
[41:42] living and the deceased, to be able to
[41:45] come home, that those families can have
[41:47] peace in their hearts and in their minds
[41:49] once again as much as possible. We want
[41:52] to remember brother Shelley tonight and
[41:54] sister Stacy. They need a touch from the
[41:56] Lord. I know that God has it. We want to
[41:59] pray for our brother Dwayne as he would
[42:01] come to minister the word to us tonight.
[42:04] Believe that the Lord would speak to us.
[42:07] speak to us. I believe it. Sing this
[42:10] course as we're getting ready to pray
[42:12] tonight. Be flat worthy.
[42:15] Thou
[42:17] art worthy.
[42:21] Thou
[42:23] art worthy.
[42:27] Thou
[42:29] art worthy,
[42:32] oh Lord.
[42:34] [Music]
[42:37] to
[42:39] receive glory.
[42:43] Glory
[42:44] and honor.
[42:48] Glory
[42:50] and honor
[42:53] and power.
[42:57] [Music]
[42:58] For thou hast created,
[43:04] hast all things
[43:07] created.
[43:10] Thou hast
[43:12] created
[43:15] all things.
[43:19] [Music]
[43:21] and for thy pleasure
[43:26] they are
[43:28] created.
[43:31] Thou
[43:33] art
[43:34] [Music]
[43:36] brother John Thornton. I'm going to ask
[43:37] you to come tonight and pray over these
[43:39] prayer requests, please.
[43:42] Thou
[43:44] art worthy.
[43:47] Thou
[43:49] art worthy.
[43:53] Thou
[43:55] art worthy,
[43:58] oh Lord,
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] to
[44:05] receive glory.
[44:09] Glory
[44:11] and honor.
[44:14] Glory
[44:16] and honor
[44:19] and power.
[44:24] For thou hast
[44:27] created,
[44:29] hast all things created.
[44:35] Thou hast
[44:37] created
[44:40] all things.
[44:46] And for thy pleasure
[44:51] lay on
[44:53] me.
[45:04] Do you really believe that, church?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; He is worthy today. Oh my. Don't you
[45:10] just love him?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Don't you just love him? Don't you just
[45:14] love it when you feel him getting close
[45:16] to you?
[45:18] &gt;&gt; It just does something to me.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't want me to react and
[45:23] he doesn't want me to rejoice, he better
[45:25] not get close to me. Cuz my hand's going
[45:27] to go up. My heart's going to say,
[45:29] "Thank you, Jesus."
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he is worthy today.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in miracles?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe God still the same today
[45:39] that he was yesterday? The scripture
[45:41] said he's the same yesterday, today,
[45:45] and forever.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; You're looking at a miracle standing up
[45:48] here.
[45:50] I'm telling you tonight that no matter
[45:52] what you have need of, whether it's a
[45:54] whether it's a headache or a or a
[45:56] toenail pull off, Amen. or if it's
[45:59] life-threatening cancer,
[46:01] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that God has the answer.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's that close.
[46:07] He's that close.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. To answering that prayer. You see,
[46:12] there's no space between that. That's
[46:14] how close he is. And all we have to do
[46:18] is believe him. Is to have faith.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell you something? Faith is
[46:25] faith in the face of facts.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Fact is 99 year old women don't have
[46:32] babies. Faith says otherwise.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Faith says if you're going to if you're
[46:38] going to tear down the walls of a city,
[46:40] you don't march around with a 29piece
[46:42] orchestra saying pling all is well. But
[46:46] faith says something different.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; If you're going out and defeat a giant,
[46:50] you don't send a 14 or 15 year old kid
[46:53] that has no battle experience with you.
[46:56] But faith says different.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; And the doctor may have said there's no
[47:00] hope for you, but faith says there's
[47:03] something different.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Thank God. All you got to do, Jesus
[47:07] said, only believe. All things are
[47:10] possible. God bless you. Let's talk to
[47:13] him. Father, how grateful and thankful
[47:16] and privileged we are to be able to
[47:18] stand in your holy presence tonight,
[47:20] Lord, to feel you so close to us, Lord.
[47:24] And we know that you come to do a work
[47:26] tonight through that word, Lord, through
[47:28] our faith and believing you. We have
[47:30] come believing, Lord. We are creating
[47:32] within ourselves an atmosphere to
[47:34] receive exactly what you have for us
[47:37] today, Lord. We put no restrictions. We
[47:40] put no limitation tonight, Lord, on what
[47:43] you're able to do. And we just open
[47:45] ourselves completely and holy to you and
[47:48] say, Lord, whatever it is that you want
[47:50] to accomplish in our lives, in our
[47:53] bodies, in our spirit tonight, Lord, we
[47:56] stand here as receptive vessels saying,
[47:58] "Touch us, Lord, tonight." You saw all
[48:01] these multitude of hands that were
[48:03] lifted today. I wish I had the ability,
[48:06] Lord, to meet one of those needs, but I
[48:08] do not. But we're serving a God today
[48:12] that said, "I will supply all of your
[48:14] needs according to my riches and glory."
[48:18] It doesn't matter what it is. It doesn't
[48:20] matter what resource it takes. You have
[48:22] the ability today. We cast ourselves and
[48:25] our needs and our petitions at the feet
[48:28] of Jesus today. And we trust you. We
[48:30] believe you today. Bless your man's
[48:32] servant as he brings this word tonight.
[48:34] open our hearts and give us a spirit and
[48:37] a heart to receive that to just speak to
[48:39] us and we walk out of this building. We
[48:43] walk out having been changed a little
[48:45] bit more to be like you that we've
[48:47] whittle off that we've shed off whatever
[48:50] it was that caused us not to be a
[48:53] perfect vision of the son of God. Help
[48:55] us I pray in Jesus name we praise you.
[48:58] We thank you. Amen. Amen. God bless.
[49:03] God bless you, brother John. Thank you.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:07] [Applause]
[49:08] Hallelujah.
[49:11] [Applause]
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; You may have your seat tonight.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; I felt my faith being stirred.
[49:28] [Laughter]
[49:31] You could tell it, too.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:36] It's good to be gathered once again
[49:38] tonight.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; A lot of us were here last night, but
[49:41] some traveled in today and we're so
[49:43] thankful to see them uh in the house of
[49:48] the Lord. Sister West, it is so good to
[49:50] see you and see Paul tonight. God bless
[49:53] you.
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:01] Johnny, I didn't see you last night, so
[50:03] I'm going to greet you tonight. God
[50:04] bless you. We're glad you're here.
[50:09] [Applause]
[50:10] Brother Isaac and Sister Mary Stofus
[50:12] traveled in today from Indiana. We're
[50:14] glad that they're here tonight.
[50:17] [Music]
[50:21] Sister Lily Klene and Aaliyah came from
[50:24] Missouri. I assume you traveled in
[50:26] today. God bless you. We're glad you're
[50:27] here.
[50:31] [Music]
[50:31] [Applause]
[50:34] I'm trying to scan the crowd. Make sure
[50:35] I get everybody. Isaac and Susan, we're
[50:38] glad that you all are here from Indiana.
[50:40] God bless you.
[50:46] Ruth Stoz traveled in today. God bless
[50:49] you from Indiana.
[50:52] [Applause]
[50:55] Over here, Pastor Brother Isaac and his
[50:57] wife, Sister Annie, and their children
[50:58] also traveled in from Indiana today. God
[51:01] bless you.
[51:03] [Applause]
[51:06] Now, some of these are leaving tonight,
[51:08] and we really want to pray for them.
[51:11] They're they're brave souls to travel
[51:14] all night to go home. They trade out
[51:17] because they have they have farms, they
[51:20] have produce, they have to they have to
[51:22] look after animals and so some of them
[51:24] come so and some of them stay behind and
[51:27] then they switch out. So that's what's
[51:28] happening tonight. We want to pray for
[51:30] them and believe the Lord to to uh help
[51:34] them get there and here and back there.
[51:37] And
[51:38] &gt;&gt; God is good. He's faithful.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; We're blessed to be able to be in the
[51:43] house of the Lord tonight.
[51:46] Tomorrow night is banquet night when
[51:50] we're going to celebrate Brother Shel's
[51:52] 50th preaching anniversary. It starts
[51:56] promptly at 6:00.
[52:00] There is going to be a lot of activity
[52:03] tomorrow night, including eating.
[52:06] So, it's going to start promptly at 6.
[52:09] They requested that I would tell you if
[52:13] you're the parents of small children
[52:16] where you're going to need to get in and
[52:18] out of the table maybe frequently that
[52:21] you would sit toward the ends because we
[52:24] are going to be tight there in the
[52:26] fellowship hall. And uh that they've got
[52:28] the little tables for the younger
[52:31] children over there on the side. You may
[52:33] have to tend to those children as well.
[52:35] So, if you have that age group of
[52:37] children, uh we're just doing that so
[52:40] that you don't have to uh spend as much
[52:43] time uh squeezing through the chairs.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; We're adding what you saw last night.
[52:49] They're going to add another row of uh
[52:51] of tables and chairs. So, we are going
[52:54] to be squeezed in there. When you go in,
[52:57] I will warn you, it may be cold, but it
[53:01] won't stay cold long.
[53:04] We only have two air conditioners down
[53:06] there. We got six in this building. So,
[53:10] &gt;&gt; uh we're going to add to it.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; We'll add to it as we need it. But I
[53:16] just want to give you that warning that
[53:18] we may uh have it cold when you go in
[53:22] because we've got to
[53:25] beat the rush. But we're going to have a
[53:27] good time tonight.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a good time tomorrow
[53:31] night. We're going to have a good time
[53:32] Saturday. We're going to have a good
[53:35] time Sunday
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:38] because where Jesus is,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; we can have a wonderful time.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And I like the way brother John said. He
[53:47] said, "Lord, if you don't want me to
[53:49] react,
[53:51] don't come near."
[53:55] &gt;&gt; You see, he built us. God built us
[53:59] &gt;&gt; as emotional people.
[54:02] Whether you claim to be emotional or
[54:04] not,
[54:05] &gt;&gt; he claimed us as human beings with
[54:07] emotions.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And when his holy spirit draws near to
[54:12] us and that vibration of the spirit
[54:15] starts happening, there's something that
[54:18] inside of me that reacts to that
[54:22] &gt;&gt; and and I could quench it.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; I have the human ability to quench it.
[54:28] But I believe that if we embrace the
[54:31] spirit of the Lord, he'll come again and
[54:34] again and again.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; And all that heavy burden that you've
[54:38] been hanging on to. All that heavy
[54:41] burden that you've just let rest on your
[54:43] shoulders, if you'll let him draw near
[54:46] to you, he can roll that burden right
[54:48] off of you.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; He promised he would
[54:52] &gt;&gt; in the word of God.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:57] We're going to receive the offering for
[55:00] the expenses of the meeting tonight. As
[55:02] you put in your offering, perhaps you
[55:04] would have tithe the local people that
[55:06] you would want to put in as well.
[55:08] Brother Ellas, would you come again
[55:10] tonight and stand here? Ian, will you
[55:13] get the other bag and come and stand
[55:14] over here, please? We're going to uh
[55:18] bring our offering to the Lord. We want
[55:21] to see every need of this meeting taken
[55:24] care of. We don't want we we don't want
[55:26] to beg you.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; We're not beggars because my papa owns
[55:31] it all.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And if we're obedient to his voice when
[55:35] he says give, he'll take care of this
[55:38] ministry. He'll take care of you.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I've seen him do it over and over and
[55:43] over again. God is faithful.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you give to the Lord
[55:49] tonight. Would you sing this course? I'm
[55:51] so glad that Jesus set me free.
[55:57] Well, I'm so glad that Jesus set me
[56:01] free. I'm so glad that Jesus set me

[57:30] set me free. Satan had me bound. But
[57:34] Jesus,
[57:36] Satan had me bound, but Jesus set me
[57:40] free. Singing glory, hallelujah.
[57:43] Jesus set me free. Now I'm on my way to
[57:47] heaven. I'm shouting victory. I'm on my
[57:51] way to heaven. I'm shouting victory.
[57:59] Singing glory hallelujah for Jesus. One
[58:03] more time. I'm so glad that Jesus set me
[58:07] free. I'm so glad that Jesus set me
[58:12] free.
[58:13] I'm so glad that Jesus set me free.
[58:17] Singing glory. Hallelujah.
[58:20] Jesus set me free.
[58:28] Hallelujah.
[58:32] He whom the sun sets free
[58:36] &gt;&gt; is free indeed.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're able, would you
[58:41] stand to your feet tonight?
[58:44] We're going to invite our brother Dwayne
[58:46] Jackson to the pulpit. He's going to
[58:48] sing and preach and testify in whatever
[58:50] the Lord lays on his heart. We believe
[58:53] that God sent him here for us. And I
[58:56] believe that there is a word from heaven
[58:59] that is to be delivered tonight that we
[59:02] can receive if we'll come with a right
[59:05] spirit and a right heart, a right
[59:06] attitude. Father, we thank you that we
[59:09] can be gathered here tonight as our
[59:12] brother would come. I am asking you that
[59:15] you will do the exceeding and abundant
[59:18] tonight in this house that you get all
[59:22] glory and honor through our brother as
[59:24] he ministers to us. And it's in the name
[59:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray and
[59:30] declare these things that you get glory.
[59:34] Amen. Would you help me to make Brother
[59:36] Dwayne welcome to the pullpit tonight?
[59:41] God bless you, brother.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I love you, buddy. If you're going to
[59:46] sing,
[59:50] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; How can you not be excited
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; in an atmosphere like this?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. you you can have your seats for
[1:00:06] just a a moment
[1:00:10] if you would and uh give me hopefully
[1:00:13] give me a chance to settle my nerves
[1:00:15] just a little bit. Um, I I I
[1:00:22] told brother
[1:00:23] told brother Wesley
[1:00:26] after his service the other night, I
[1:00:28] said I said, "You know, about a week and
[1:00:30] a half ago,
[1:00:32] the Lord gave me a a scripture
[1:00:35] that he impressed upon me to to to use
[1:00:39] for the service tonight, an opening
[1:00:40] scripture."
[1:00:42] And I was at first I I was excited. you
[1:00:45] know, when whenever you're you're
[1:00:46] praying and asking the Lord's direction
[1:00:48] and you you you feel like you get a word
[1:00:51] and you you write that down and and then
[1:00:53] the more I dwelt on it in my human mind,
[1:00:55] I said, "That don't make no sense to me.
[1:00:59] Why why would I why would you want me to
[1:01:00] use that verse? It it just it it I
[1:01:04] couldn't make sense out of it." And I I
[1:01:05] had a a thought that I felt like he was
[1:01:07] leading me on. And every time I kept
[1:01:09] going back to the first verse that I I
[1:01:11] had written down, I said, "Lord, that
[1:01:12] that don't make sense to me. Maybe maybe
[1:01:14] I I've miss I've missed it. But then
[1:01:16] after the service whenever brother
[1:01:18] Wesley preached the other night, I told
[1:01:20] him afterwards, I I know the reason why.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I know the reason why.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Everything makes sense to me now.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; And so many different things I'll share
[1:01:28] with you in just a minute. But I want to
[1:01:30] sing a song and um if you know it,
[1:01:32] please please help me. I'm not a I don't
[1:01:34] like to to sing specials. I I like to
[1:01:37] people to worship with me this evening.
[1:01:39] The the song is Speak to the Mountain.
[1:01:43] Glory to God.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Help me sing it this evening.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; From strength to strength
[1:01:56] we sometimes go.
[1:02:01] And again,
[1:02:04] we're sinking low
[1:02:08] in the shadow
[1:02:11] of a mountain
[1:02:14] looming high
[1:02:17] above our heads. We need not fear what
[1:02:22] lies ahead.
[1:02:25] For the word
[1:02:28] has clearly said
[1:02:31] that our faith would be sufficient
[1:02:36] to make the mountain
[1:02:39] disappear.
[1:02:43] Speak to the mountain.
[1:02:47] You'll not triumph
[1:02:50] over me. Be thou removed from here to
[1:02:56] yonder.
[1:02:59] Disappear into
[1:03:01] the sea. Speak to the mountain.
[1:03:07] Speak with authority
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:15] and the mountain
[1:03:18] must move. And you shall claim victory
[1:03:26] [Applause]
[1:03:28] in the midst
[1:03:31] of the battle.
[1:03:33] When the foe is gaining ground,
[1:03:39] look up and see the mighty
[1:03:44] hand of God
[1:03:47] reaching down. Oh, speak God's word name
[1:03:51] and Satan trembles.
[1:03:54] Speak God's word and watch him flee. For
[1:04:00] once again
[1:04:02] our God delivers. The mountain crles
[1:04:08] at our feet.
[1:04:11] Speak to the mountain.
[1:04:16] You'll not triumph
[1:04:19] over me. Be thou removed from here to
[1:04:25] yonder.
[1:04:27] Disappear into
[1:04:30] the sea. Speak to the mountain.
[1:04:36] Speak with
[1:04:38] authority
[1:04:43] and the mountainous
[1:04:46] move and you shall claim victory.
[1:04:52] Can I sing that second verse one more
[1:04:54] time?
[1:04:56] Now in the midst
[1:04:59] of your battle,
[1:05:02] when the foe is gaining round,
[1:05:07] look up and see the mighty
[1:05:12] hand of God, still reaching down. Oh,
[1:05:17] speak God's name as Satan trembles.
[1:05:23] Speak God's word and watch him bleed.
[1:05:28] For once again,
[1:05:30] my God delivers
[1:05:33] the mountains from
[1:05:37] his feet.
[1:05:38] Oh me to the mountain.
[1:05:44] You not triumph
[1:05:47] over me.
[1:05:49] Be thou removed from here to yonder.
[1:05:55] Disappear into to the sea. Sweet to the
[1:06:01] mountain.
[1:06:04] Oh, speak with
[1:06:07] authority.
[1:06:11] Oh, and the mountain
[1:06:14] must move and you shall claim victory.
[1:06:22] Oh, speak to the mountain.
[1:06:28] You triumph
[1:06:30] over me. Oh, be thou removed from here
[1:06:36] to yonder.
[1:06:39] disappear into
[1:06:41] the sea. Speak to the mountain.
[1:06:47] Speak with
[1:06:50] authority
[1:06:54] and the mountain
[1:06:58] must move.
[1:07:00] You shall claim victory.
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:10] Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] Glory.
[1:07:21] Glory.
[1:07:24] Hallelujah.
[1:07:26] Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:29] Hallelujah.
[1:07:32] Glory be to God.
[1:07:34] Praise his wonderful name.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Praise his name.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Do you really recognize tonight
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; what power
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; and what authority that has been given
[1:07:55] to you.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; If you don't now, I hope by the end of
[1:08:01] this service that you do.
[1:08:04] I feel like so many of us have not taken
[1:08:07] a hold of it.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; It's been given to you
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; to use what's been given to you, his
[1:08:15] word.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; But if you don't take it and you don't
[1:08:19] consume it, you're never going to be
[1:08:20] able to speak it.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; You must take and eat the book.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; It has to become a part of you. Would
[1:08:32] you stand with me this evening?
[1:08:34] Hallelujah.
[1:08:36] Praise his wonderful name.
[1:08:40] Amen. Amen. I tell you, it is such a joy
[1:08:43] and such a privilege. Thank you
[1:08:46] musicians. I tell you the you just don't
[1:08:49] find better musicians in worship.
[1:08:54] We thank them for their their labor of
[1:08:56] love.
[1:08:58] And I tell you, it's if if you've ever
[1:09:01] if you've never been in their position,
[1:09:03] you don't realize
[1:09:05] how much it takes and how much they give
[1:09:08] of themsel. And uh I I tell you, I
[1:09:10] certainly do appreciate as as name as
[1:09:13] brother Joe was saying last night of of
[1:09:15] watching Brother Benjamin whenever he
[1:09:18] leads worship, it's it's not done
[1:09:21] half-heartedly.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; It it's not done and it's not done as a
[1:09:26] show.
[1:09:29] There there's I I've been to services
[1:09:31] where it appears as a performance is
[1:09:33] being put on, but that's not a show.
[1:09:36] That's him entering in to his personal
[1:09:39] worship. And if you want to join in with
[1:09:41] him, then do it.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; He He's doing the work. He's doing the
[1:09:47] work of a of of ministry, of inviting
[1:09:49] you in to the presence of God.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, there's been so many
[1:09:56] things just in the past two days that
[1:09:58] have that have just overwhelmed me with
[1:10:01] with things concerning about tonight.
[1:10:04] And I I don't make I don't want to keep
[1:10:06] you standing for long, but you'll be
[1:10:09] seated longer than you'll be standing.
[1:10:11] So, um, the the other night, um, last
[1:10:15] night, Brother Joe, Brother Joe Writers,
[1:10:17] in in his, um, in his ministry to us, he
[1:10:21] was he was sharing with us how how our
[1:10:24] position is key.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; The position that you're in, the
[1:10:29] position that you're supposed to be in
[1:10:31] is key. And he spoke he spoke on on Mark
[1:10:34] um, chapter 16 and and in his his
[1:10:38] speaking, he he made a comment. He said,
[1:10:40] "It must become an inspired word in my
[1:10:44] life."
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. It It must become
[1:10:49] an inspired word.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; It can't just be left just just on on
[1:10:53] here. It's got to be inspired word.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And then and then a comment that he made
[1:10:58] about it was about eight minutes or so
[1:11:00] to till he he was finished up. He said,
[1:11:03] "We have to be able to make sure that
[1:11:06] the word is vested
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; in us."
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't tell you the last time I've
[1:11:12] heard the word vested
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; used.
[1:11:17] You'll see why it's important to me in
[1:11:20] just a in just a moment.
[1:11:22] my morning devotional as I sat down to
[1:11:25] to read and study this morning.
[1:11:28] It it came up on my my screen
[1:11:32] and uh let me see if I can if I can find
[1:11:36] it now. My morning devotional popped up
[1:11:38] on my screen. It says, "We are God's
[1:11:42] mouthpiece."
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Hashtag speak the word. Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; My thought for this evening is by the
[1:11:52] power vested
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And I I I tell you, I I love the
[1:12:01] continuity
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Benjamin comes out and he sings,
[1:12:07] "I was made for more."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; You'll find where that fits in at the
[1:12:13] end of the the the service this evening.
[1:12:15] It it just Everything is just is falling
[1:12:18] in line. And as I said, the things that
[1:12:19] Brother Wesley was talking about, it it
[1:12:21] clarified to me why I want to share this
[1:12:25] opening scripture this evening before I
[1:12:28] let you have your seats.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; My opening scripture tonight is Isaiah
[1:12:33] chapter 52
[1:12:36] verse one and two.
[1:12:44] You got it. They got it on here.
[1:12:48] Awake.
[1:12:50] I I don't I don't think Isaiah was
[1:12:53] telling them, "Hey, wake up.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Wake up. Listen to what I have to say."
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't quiet.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; No, he was trying to get their
[1:13:04] attention. He said, "Awake. Awake.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Put on thy strength, O Zion.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Put on thy beautiful." And I wrote down
[1:13:15] majestic, honorable, and glorious
[1:13:18] garments, oh Jerusalem, the holy city.
[1:13:22] For henceforth
[1:13:23] there shall no more come into thee
[1:13:28] the uncircumcised
[1:13:30] and the unclean.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Now, if you were here Tuesday night,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; you understand when brother Wesley was
[1:13:39] talking about the circumcision,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; right? This is why it tied in for me. Uh
[1:13:44] it made it it brought it clarity to me.
[1:13:49] No more come into thee the circum
[1:13:52] uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake
[1:13:54] thyself from the dust. Arise and sit
[1:13:59] down, O Jerusalem. Loose thyself from
[1:14:02] the bands of thy neck, oh captive
[1:14:05] daughter of Zion. You don't have to be
[1:14:08] bound anymore.
[1:14:10] How you speak the word?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; The bonds have been removed. We have
[1:14:17] kept them on ourselves.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; He has not bound you.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He's given you freedom. He's given you
[1:14:24] liberty.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; You have to take the bondage off. Loose
[1:14:29] thyself.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Take the word, speak the word, and loose
[1:14:34] thyself. He's given you the power and he
[1:14:37] has given you the authority to do just
[1:14:41] that.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. I pray that the
[1:14:44] Lord will bless the reading of his word
[1:14:46] and bless the remainder of the service.
[1:14:48] And and uh I tell you, I I I know he's
[1:14:51] here.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; I know he's here. And if even if if I
[1:14:55] would if I would potentially make a
[1:14:57] mistake, I know he will clear he will
[1:14:59] clear it up. my my mind is going in so
[1:15:01] many different directions with with with
[1:15:03] so many things that that have have
[1:15:05] happened and I've heard and and um I I I
[1:15:09] want to bring it to you. I want to to
[1:15:11] deliver it to you as it came to me. In
[1:15:13] the book of in the book of Genesis 32
[1:15:16] verse 28 says, "And he said, thy name
[1:15:20] shall be called no more Jacob,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; but Israel,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; for as a prince, thou hast power with
[1:15:28] God and with men, and hast prevailed."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; God placed that authority. He changed
[1:15:38] him. He changed his name and he placed
[1:15:40] within him a power and a position of
[1:15:44] authority. Now he had to step into it,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He had to walk into the position that he
[1:15:50] was placed in. Tonight you and I must
[1:15:53] again walk into the position that he has
[1:15:57] placed before us.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; He puts a position there. But if you
[1:16:01] choose to turn aside,
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; then his hands are tied. You you did you
[1:16:06] know that you can that you can tie the
[1:16:08] hands of God if you don't believe.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is what hinders him. Now it's
[1:16:14] not going to it's not going to hinder
[1:16:16] the ultimate of his plan and his will
[1:16:18] but it will hinder your ability to
[1:16:21] receive blessings and favor with him.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Now the the word power we know it means
[1:16:27] authority. And the word vested as I said
[1:16:30] the the title this evening would be by
[1:16:32] the power vested in me. The word vested,
[1:16:35] maybe some people may not understand
[1:16:37] what that word means, but it means
[1:16:39] empowered or it means authorized.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It means commissioned.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And it means approved.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; So he has he has commissioned us with a
[1:16:52] power and an authority this evening. And
[1:16:55] if you're if you if you are confused
[1:16:58] about your position in Christ, you will
[1:17:01] never understand what your authority is
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; and you will never know how to use it.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; So you you've got to get rid of the
[1:17:09] confusion.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Satan wants you to be confused.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; He does not want you to accept that you
[1:17:16] are a son and a daughter of God. He
[1:17:19] wants you to forget who your father is.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; That's what he wants you to do. He wants
[1:17:24] to confuse you and get you pulled away
[1:17:26] from that because he knows
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; that if you recognize your position and
[1:17:32] you recognize who you are, you get a
[1:17:35] true revelation of who you are, there is
[1:17:38] nothing that can stop you.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Praise God.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You know, there there's and I don't have
[1:17:44] it written down, but it just comes to my
[1:17:45] mind that that there was a place that
[1:17:47] Brother Brandham made made the comment
[1:17:49] that that when the true church gets a
[1:17:51] true revelation
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; of what she is,
[1:17:55] that she will be an invincible army.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? You get a true
[1:17:59] revelation of your position in Christ,
[1:18:02] there's nothing that can stop you.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stand in your
[1:18:05] way.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. And people say,
[1:18:11] "Well, my problem is too big for him."
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; No, it ain't.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; No, it isn't. There's there's nothing
[1:18:17] that's too too hard for him. But, you
[1:18:19] know, in in our Christian walk today,
[1:18:20] there's there's many that that still
[1:18:22] live in a in a with a a spiritual popper
[1:18:26] mentality.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; They have not truly accepted who they
[1:18:31] are.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And and so they they still they let
[1:18:34] Satan drag them down and bind them down
[1:18:37] with the thoughts in their mind. And so
[1:18:39] they live as a popper when they have
[1:18:42] been given the place of a prince and as
[1:18:45] a king.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't live that way.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; If if I had a million dollars, I I'm
[1:18:53] going to live like I had a million
[1:18:55] dollars.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I don't have a million dollars. So I I I
[1:18:58] don't live that way. But if I was a
[1:19:00] millionaire, you would know it. I would
[1:19:02] I would act the part of a millionaire.
[1:19:05] There's a few people that that I know of
[1:19:07] that are millionaires and and honestly,
[1:19:10] you don't see them act in that part. I
[1:19:12] think it's because they don't want
[1:19:13] somebody else to know that they are
[1:19:15] because they know if they if the other
[1:19:16] people find out they are, then all
[1:19:18] they're going to want is
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; give me give me give me. But but if I in
[1:19:23] in the spiritual sense, I'm I'm a the
[1:19:26] son of a king.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; That means something to me.
[1:19:32] You know, I I've had I've had my kids
[1:19:33] and you know, it's it's it's hard being
[1:19:36] a preacher's kid um because sometimes
[1:19:38] you get you get picked on or you um
[1:19:40] examples get used. Um but I've had them
[1:19:43] ask me a as they're as they're growing
[1:19:45] up, you know. Well, Dad, why why why do
[1:19:48] we dress the way we dress? Why do we act
[1:19:51] the way we act? Why why is it that we
[1:19:54] don't go to these places? And you know,
[1:19:55] I've got friends that they they go here
[1:19:57] and they go there and and their mom and
[1:19:59] dad says nothing's wrong with it.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And and and they're allowed to wear this
[1:20:03] and they're allowed to wear that and and
[1:20:05] their parents said that there's nothing
[1:20:06] and they go to church.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; They say that they read the Bible.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And what I remind them, I said,
[1:20:13] "Whenever you go out of the house, you
[1:20:16] represent our family."
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Now, now they are a Jackson.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Right. And in our in our community, in
[1:20:25] our in our county, the the Jackson
[1:20:28] family has been known for years and
[1:20:31] years and years. Our family has lived in
[1:20:33] in the in the same area since just
[1:20:36] around the turn of the century of 1700.
[1:20:39] So, there's a lot of Jacksons that live
[1:20:41] in our community. Our business that that
[1:20:45] we operate has been in business since
[1:20:47] 1952.
[1:20:48] My grandfather started the company. My
[1:20:51] dad runs the company. He owns the
[1:20:53] company. He doesn't run it anymore. He
[1:20:55] put that on to me. And I've I've been
[1:20:57] there for over 30 years working with him
[1:21:00] at the company. So, in our community,
[1:21:03] we're known. That's right.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; The people know us. The other day, my my
[1:21:06] mom and dad's building a a new house and
[1:21:09] they they had something that an issue
[1:21:11] about needing to get an inspector to
[1:21:13] come out and do an inspection. Brother
[1:21:14] Steve and and so they they called he
[1:21:17] called the inspector or somebody else
[1:21:19] called for dad and and the the inspector
[1:21:22] said, "Well, has such and such been
[1:21:23] done?" Well, typically an inspector goes
[1:21:27] out to the job site.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; They're not going to take your word
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; because their jobs on the line.
[1:21:35] So they they called and and the person
[1:21:39] told him I I think it was my mom that
[1:21:41] was talking to him and um actually it
[1:21:44] wasn't sorry it was a it was another
[1:21:46] gentleman that was talking to him and
[1:21:47] they said the the response was is such
[1:21:50] and such completed and he said Doyle
[1:21:53] said Doyle is my dad's name. Doyle said
[1:21:55] it's done and his response to him was
[1:21:59] well if he said it's done it's done. He
[1:22:02] said, "I've never known him in all my
[1:22:05] years of knowing him," which was 50
[1:22:08] almost 50 years. He says, "I've never
[1:22:10] known him to lie.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Never known him to lie." See, there's a
[1:22:16] reputation that goes with our family
[1:22:18] name.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And there's a reputation that goes with
[1:22:21] you.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; When whenever you go out into public,
[1:22:25] you are you're representing your natural
[1:22:27] family.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You're representing your church that you
[1:22:30] attend. And you are a representation of
[1:22:33] God and his word. If you claim
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; him as your father
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; and you claim this church as your
[1:22:40] church,
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; then you should feel that you should
[1:22:43] feel that burden within you that when I
[1:22:46] walk out into public, I don't want to
[1:22:48] look something other than
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; what this says.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to bring a reproach
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; on my family's name. I don't want to
[1:22:59] bring a reproach on my church name and I
[1:23:02] definitely don't want to bring a
[1:23:03] reproach on his name
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; cuz people look at you
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; and let them look.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Some people, you know, that as they're
[1:23:12] growing up, they're like, I I don't want
[1:23:13] to be I don't want to be called out. I I
[1:23:15] don't want to look different. We're
[1:23:17] called to be different.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's that that's what makes us who we
[1:23:21] are. We are called to be a separated
[1:23:24] people. There's a reason that we're
[1:23:26] we're called to be separated that none
[1:23:28] of that's in in in the notes, but praise
[1:23:30] the Lord. In in the message, fundamental
[1:23:34] foundation for faith, brother Brandham
[1:23:36] makes a a little comment. He says, "But
[1:23:38] he gave us these redeemed blessings that
[1:23:41] we might operate
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; that we might operate the work of God by
[1:23:46] the energy
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit."
[1:23:50] All of the blessings that he's given to
[1:23:52] you is for a purpose.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; It's that we be that we are able to
[1:23:56] operate the work of God. Not operate
[1:23:58] your work,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; not operate somebody else's work,
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; but we're operating his work.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And we're doing it by the energy of the
[1:24:08] Holy Spirit. Over in the book of
[1:24:10] Revelations chapter 1 verse 5 and 6, it
[1:24:14] says, "And from Jesus Christ,
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; who is the faithful witness and the
[1:24:19] first begotten of the dead and the
[1:24:22] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:24:25] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:24:29] sins in his own blood,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; and hath made us
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; what?
[1:24:37] kings and priests
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; unto God and his father. To him be glory
[1:24:44] and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[1:24:48] Now, if he has made you a king and a
[1:24:52] priest,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; you want to go ahead and take my notes?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I don't have
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:01] He's going ahead and preaching for me.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Live like it.
[1:25:06] That's what we're called to do.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How are you going to walk out in
[1:25:10] front of somebody and say, "I'm I'm I'm
[1:25:12] a son of a king."
[1:25:14] And you look like you just came out of
[1:25:16] the barroom.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what, they're they're
[1:25:21] not going to look at you and trust you
[1:25:22] and believe you.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; They're not. They're going to say, "He's
[1:25:26] double-minded
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; and he's unstable
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; in all of his ways." Trust me, the the
[1:25:33] people that live out in the world, they
[1:25:34] know scripture.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; They'll bring scripture to you.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And they'll look at you and they'll bind
[1:25:40] you up if you ain't careful.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; They'll they'll bring scripture and
[1:25:43] they'll they'll they will bind you up
[1:25:45] with those because guess what? Their
[1:25:48] father is Satan.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He knows the word.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; My Bible said he he he he fears. He
[1:25:54] trembles.
[1:25:56] He He knows the word,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:26:00] He just can't live it.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; He wasn't called to live it.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation chapter 5 verse 9
[1:26:07] and 10, it says, "And they sung a new
[1:26:10] song, saying, Thou art worthy."
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Didn't we just sing that just a few
[1:26:16] minutes ago? again.
[1:26:20] Thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:26:23] open the seals thereof. For thou was
[1:26:25] slain and hast redeemed us to God by the
[1:26:28] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[1:26:31] and people and nation and has made hast
[1:26:36] made us unto our God, kings and priests.
[1:26:41] And we shall reign where?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; On the earth.
[1:26:47] This is where we will reign here on this
[1:26:49] earth.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Now, if again, if he has placed you as
[1:26:54] kings and priests, there are
[1:26:56] responsibilities that go along with
[1:26:57] that.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; There's benefits that go with it.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; And there's responsibilities that go
[1:27:02] with it. Hopefully, we'll get to that in
[1:27:04] a little bit. In the message, faith is a
[1:27:06] substance.
[1:27:08] Brother Brandham says our bodies are
[1:27:10] groaning
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and we have an inheritance. Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And we're children now, heirs of the
[1:27:18] kingdom. He said, "Oh my kings and
[1:27:21] priests unto God, offering spiritual
[1:27:24] sacrifice."
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; That's what these sons Did I move? I
[1:27:29] think I went to the wrong spot. What
[1:27:32] does a priest do? Yes. Make a sacrifice.
[1:27:35] What is a spiritual sacrifice? That's
[1:27:38] what these sons and daughters do, which
[1:27:41] are kings and priests, yet not in full
[1:27:44] possession,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; but they're making sacrifices, offering
[1:27:48] to God spiritual sacrifices,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; the fruits of our lips.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Giving praise to him.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Fruits of our lips. You say,
[1:27:59] "Brother Brandom, I I just don't feel
[1:28:00] like praising him."
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; You ever been in that place
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; in in this flesh? You ever been in that
[1:28:08] place? You're you're in a really low
[1:28:10] spot and and you're it's really tough
[1:28:12] to, you know, to to want to give that
[1:28:14] praise. He said he said that's the time
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; to make the sacrifice.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Praise him anyhow.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Kings and priests, sons and daughters
[1:28:26] offering spiritual sacrifice, the fruits
[1:28:30] of our lips giving praise unto his name.
[1:28:33] He said, "Now notice it was for everyone
[1:28:35] that was a priest in the Old Testament.
[1:28:38] Everyone in the New Testament that
[1:28:40] becomes a Christian, born again,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; becomes a priest to God."
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And we are priests and kings.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; A priest is to make sacrifice.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; We'll let that settle for a second.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; A priest is to make sacrifice.
[1:29:01] People
[1:29:03] don't people don't want to sacrifice.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; They want the benefits
[1:29:11] of the king
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; and the dominion that I have as the
[1:29:16] king. But don't make me sacrifice.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; But see, it takes both.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; It takes both. A priest is to make
[1:29:26] sacrifice. And we give to God the
[1:29:29] sacrifice of our lips, giving praise to
[1:29:31] his name. Say, "I don't feel like it."
[1:29:33] He said, "Do it anyhow."
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; That's a sacrifice.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Say, "I feel too tired."
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; The devil will tell you that
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; will
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; till he takes you to hell.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; That's tough.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; That's tough words. He will tell you
[1:29:50] that till he takes you to hell. Said,
[1:29:52] "That's right. You're to make a
[1:29:54] spiritual sacrifice. the fruits of our
[1:29:56] lips, giving praise to his name, priests
[1:29:58] and kings. Unto God the Bible said we
[1:30:01] were made us priests and kings.
[1:30:04] If we're kings and priests, how ought we
[1:30:07] to act? How ought how ought we to
[1:30:09] conduct ourselves?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:30:14] I wrote down we haven't been made kings
[1:30:17] and priests because of anything that we
[1:30:19] have done.
[1:30:22] I
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to I want you to understand
[1:30:25] that it it wasn't anything that you did.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; But he chose you.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And because he has chosen you and
[1:30:35] because you are spiritual Abraham's
[1:30:37] seed, the spiritual seed of Abraham,
[1:30:39] then you are a recipient of the
[1:30:42] inheritance
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that was given. It's only according to
[1:30:46] his sovereign will that he chose you and
[1:30:49] he placed a representation of himself
[1:30:52] within you.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; If his seed is inside you,
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; it must bring forth of its kind.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; If his seed is inside of you, it will
[1:31:05] bring forth of its kind. Right.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; In 2 Thessalonians
[1:31:10] 1 11 and 12, wherefore also we pray
[1:31:15] always for you that our God would count
[1:31:18] you worthy of this calling. Now see, in
[1:31:21] my own self, in my own mind, I don't
[1:31:24] feel worthy. I I don't feel worthy to
[1:31:26] stand here in front of you this evening
[1:31:28] and even to open his word and to read
[1:31:30] his word. But it wasn't of my calling.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; See, he's made me worthy. His word, his
[1:31:38] righteousness
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; is what has made me worthy. I I didn't
[1:31:41] call myself I didn't this is the
[1:31:44] furthest thing than than what I would
[1:31:46] want to do. I I ran from it for 20 plus
[1:31:49] years to to not be in this position. And
[1:31:53] it it cost me it cost me, you know, many
[1:31:56] many years of of of of not being fully
[1:31:59] blessed the way that God wanted me to be
[1:32:01] blessed.
[1:32:04] But once I stepped into my position,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; then he was able to perform what he
[1:32:11] already had in place.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; But it was me. I was out of position.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I had to I had to accept the calling and
[1:32:20] I had to step into the position that he
[1:32:23] had set forth for me and then operate
[1:32:27] within that position. It's it's one
[1:32:30] thing to realize what position you are
[1:32:32] supposed to be in. Another thing to act
[1:32:34] on it
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; and to step into it and do the
[1:32:38] performance that you're supposed to do.
[1:32:40] Not performance as a performing type
[1:32:43] thing, but do what he's asked you to do
[1:32:45] is what I'm saying. worthy of this
[1:32:48] calling and fulfill all the good
[1:32:51] pleasure of his goodness and the work of
[1:32:55] faith with power that the name of our
[1:32:58] Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
[1:33:02] you.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That's that's what he's wanting. He he
[1:33:05] he is wanting to receive glory
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; to him
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; and ye in him according to the grace of
[1:33:12] our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. In
[1:33:14] the book of Ephesians, I I I bring a lot
[1:33:16] of scripture to you that it's I hope you
[1:33:18] don't mind scripture.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I love scripture.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; If I say something of my own, it could
[1:33:25] it could be wrong. But I guarantee you
[1:33:26] if I read to you scripture and I bring
[1:33:28] you scripture, it ain't going to be
[1:33:29] wrong.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Never ever wrong. In the book of
[1:33:33] Ephesians chapter 2,
[1:33:35] verses 1 through 7,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and you
[1:33:41] hath he quickened.
[1:33:44] who were dead in trespasses and sins.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I want I want to stop just a
[1:33:48] second. Brother Wesley, whenever you
[1:33:50] read from the book of Ephesians last
[1:33:52] night, chapter 2, what verse did you
[1:33:55] start with?
[1:33:59] Whenever he opened up with verse 8, I
[1:34:01] opened my notes up and I handed I showed
[1:34:04] it over to to Heather. I said, "Look,
[1:34:07] I've got Ephesians 2:es 1-7."
[1:34:12] and he started with eight.
[1:34:16] I I I again I love the continuity
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; who were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:34:26] wherein in time past you walked
[1:34:28] according to the course of this world
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; according to the prince of the power of
[1:34:34] the air
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; the spirit that now workketh in the
[1:34:38] children of disobedience
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; among whom also we all had our
[1:34:44] conversation in times past in the lust
[1:34:46] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[1:34:50] the flesh and of the mind,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; and were by nature the children of
[1:34:55] wrath, even as others.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; But God,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy,
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; for his great love wherewith he loved
[1:35:08] us,
[1:35:16] his mercy.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; I I didn't deserve it.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve it in in in the in the
[1:35:25] way that I was. I didn't deserve it.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; But he chose me.
[1:35:31] He chose me. Even when we were dead in
[1:35:34] sins, hath quickened us together with
[1:35:37] Christ.
[1:35:38] By grace ye are saved, and hath raised
[1:35:41] us up together, and made us sit together
[1:35:44] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that
[1:35:47] in the ages to come, he might show the
[1:35:49] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:35:52] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[1:35:55] That such an expression of God's mercy
[1:35:58] and his love. It was a divine
[1:36:00] intervention
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; for you and me
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; because without Christ, we're powerless.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Without him, we're empty vessels.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; If if you don't have him, you ain't got
[1:36:17] nothing.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't have his love and you don't
[1:36:22] have his mercy, you ain't got nothing.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You're completely empty. You would still
[1:36:28] be dead in your trespasses and sin.
[1:36:30] You'd be helpless
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; and without a hope.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; But he is rich in mercy.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He is the one who's made you worthy.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; He is the one who has given you
[1:36:40] authority.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; You didn't earn it.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you could earn it.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Nothing that you could do to earn it.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; And you definitely don't deserve it.
[1:36:52] Right?
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; This flesh man don't deserve what he has
[1:36:57] given to us.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; But his love and his mercy just simply
[1:37:01] flows.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It flows out of him. He wants to bring
[1:37:06] you mercy. He wants to offer grace to
[1:37:08] you. But will you accept it or not?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; His mercy brought a spiritual
[1:37:14] resurrection.
[1:37:15] And he has raised us up. The the
[1:37:17] scripture said he raised us up and
[1:37:19] seated with him in heavenly places. And
[1:37:21] I I I even I think I mentioned it last
[1:37:23] night. If if if we are seated with him
[1:37:27] and the scripture says that he has that
[1:37:29] he has been seated at the right hand of
[1:37:30] the father.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; The right hand of the father is a
[1:37:33] position of power.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; So if we are in him and we are in
[1:37:39] heavenly places and we are seated with
[1:37:41] him then we also
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; by proxy we're sitting in a position of
[1:37:47] power and authority.
[1:37:51] We have to accept and recognize that
[1:37:54] position that he has placed us in
[1:37:58] in uh oh my
[1:38:02] I think I've got this in in the message
[1:38:05] gifts 1956 did I okay I did
[1:38:10] when Peter James and John
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; had received power Jesus gave them power
[1:38:17] to heal the sick
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; to cast out devils to raise the dead
[1:38:22] about Mark chapter 16.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; All this was already in my notes before
[1:38:29] last night.
[1:38:32] He says, "I can show you where God give
[1:38:35] that power to the church."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And you that don't believe in divine
[1:38:40] healing or miracles, show me where he
[1:38:43] took it away from the church.
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:48] Show me where
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; he he he he he made that claim in front
[1:38:53] of many many people. Show me where.
[1:38:58] He said he um
[1:39:00] hang on. Let me find show me where he
[1:39:03] took it away from the church. But when
[1:39:05] they received it, he said the church
[1:39:06] today, this is what I the church today
[1:39:08] isn't needing power.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's needing faith
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; to operate. What power it has.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; You've had so much embalming fluid
[1:39:20] pushed into you
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; that the days of miracles has passed in
[1:39:24] some old cold morg with the icicles, the
[1:39:27] spiritual icicles hanging down. He was
[1:39:30] talking about churches.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You understand? He's talking about
[1:39:34] churches
[1:39:36] and preachers that were pumping
[1:39:38] inbombing fluid into people.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Spiritual icicles hanging down with 90
[1:39:43] below zero. and somebody in there with
[1:39:46] some dead fluid to pump into you to be
[1:39:48] sure that you stay dead.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; They don't want somebody jumping up and
[1:39:53] shouting hallelujah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Let's just keep them all quiet.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Just keep it would scare them.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; It would you you have some of these
[1:40:02] churches when some of y'all would go in
[1:40:04] and and the word would be preached and
[1:40:06] the the the word given across the pull
[1:40:08] pit and a person shout up and say,
[1:40:10] "Amen."
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; It'd probably escort you out. We don't
[1:40:14] want that in here.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; There there are
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; there are
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; He said it's become such a place till
[1:40:22] the spirit of God has been grieved. And
[1:40:25] any church that denies the supernatural,
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; get this.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; This is what our prophet said.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Any church that denies the supernatural,
[1:40:34] it'll die as sure as I'm standing this
[1:40:37] pull pit. He that cometh of God must
[1:40:40] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[1:40:43] those who diligently seek him. He is
[1:40:46] alive. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:40:50] and forever in every principle and
[1:40:54] power, a living Christ. When these
[1:40:57] disciples had received that power, he
[1:40:59] said, "Look at it. It just lays in man."
[1:41:02] Oh, they thought they were dignified.
[1:41:05] And they go right out a few days later
[1:41:07] and find themselves helpless
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; before an epileptic. They could not cast
[1:41:13] the devil out. And Jesus come along and
[1:41:15] he said to them, "Oh thou faithless
[1:41:19] generation.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; How long will I suffer you?
[1:41:24] Bring him here." Oh brother, when he
[1:41:27] come before that real jewel,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; he cast the devil out of him. And the
[1:41:34] disciples come to him. They said, "Lord,
[1:41:36] did you take your power back?" He never
[1:41:41] said, "You don't have power." They said,
[1:41:43] "Why can't we do it?" He never said,
[1:41:44] "Well, because you lost your power." He
[1:41:47] said, "Because
[1:41:48] of your unbelief."
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; See, the power had been given. The
[1:41:54] authority
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; to move the same way Jesus was moving
[1:42:00] had been given. The problem was is they
[1:42:03] were not fully stepped into their
[1:42:05] position and using it in the correct
[1:42:07] way.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; They they they weren't they they you
[1:42:10] could almost say they it was almost like
[1:42:12] an impostor. You know, they they weren't
[1:42:14] using it in the right way fully moving
[1:42:18] under the uncction of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:20] under you know the under exactly how
[1:42:22] Christ wanted them to work and move. And
[1:42:25] many of them you know there was there
[1:42:26] was a time that um there was seven sons
[1:42:30] of
[1:42:32] They went out.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Sure was.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; They were they were paid exorcist,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; you know, and and they wanted to go out
[1:42:41] and and and they were going to they they
[1:42:43] saw what the disciples were doing.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; I'm this is this is not here, but they I
[1:42:49] just that story come to my mind. They
[1:42:52] wanted to do what the disciples were
[1:42:55] doing
[1:42:56] because they seen they had been given
[1:42:58] authority to speak over the over over
[1:43:01] devils and cast devils out. So they went
[1:43:03] out and they were going to move just
[1:43:04] like the disciples and they go out and
[1:43:07] they they you know they go out to to
[1:43:09] cast the demon out and the demon speaks
[1:43:12] back to them. So you you've got to make
[1:43:14] sure that you are in
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; the leading of the Lord. You are
[1:43:18] following his will.
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; It has to be in accordance with his
[1:43:24] will. Guess what? If you don't move
[1:43:26] within his will, you're going to get in
[1:43:27] trouble. You're going to be on your own
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and he's not going to back you up.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; If you just try to I'm going to give
[1:43:35] somebody a word.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; You better know that you are following
[1:43:40] the will of God.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; It better not be coming from your mind.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; It better be coming from his word. And
[1:43:48] you better know that he gave you that
[1:43:51] specifically to give because these these
[1:43:53] guys, they went out and they were going
[1:43:54] to cast this devil out. And the demon
[1:43:56] said, "hm uh Paul, I know.
[1:43:59] And um Jesus, I know.
[1:44:03] I don't know who you are.
[1:44:06] You ain't got any authority over me."
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; It's what the demon said. You You have
[1:44:10] no authority over me. You know, they
[1:44:13] were saying by the I I I forgot how they
[1:44:15] how they they said they was going to
[1:44:16] cast him out by the um in the in the
[1:44:20] name that Paul preached, I think is how
[1:44:22] how they they they said it. If
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and he said he said you know I
[1:44:27] know this one and I know Jesus but I
[1:44:30] don't in other words he's saying I do
[1:44:32] not accept the authority that you're
[1:44:36] trying to claim
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; because the authority had not been
[1:44:41] vested
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; to them
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; it had not been given to them
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; they had not been commissioned
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; by God to do those things so he didn't
[1:44:52] have to back it up and if you try to go
[1:44:54] out on your own and you have not been
[1:44:57] commissioned by him. Guess what? You're
[1:44:59] going to fail. You're going to fall flat
[1:45:00] on your face and you might end up like
[1:45:02] them. They were fully embarrassed
[1:45:04] because that demon beat them up
[1:45:06] terribly, stripped them of their
[1:45:08] clothes, and sent them running away.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That That's complete embarrassment.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And I I don't want to be in a spot that
[1:45:17] that I'm trying to move something on my
[1:45:19] own and I'm trying to do something that
[1:45:21] the Lord has not told me to do. I want
[1:45:24] to make sure that I'm right in the
[1:45:26] center of his will. See, the thing is
[1:45:28] what I told you a moment ago that that
[1:45:30] my my dad is the owner of the business
[1:45:32] that that we operate called Jackson
[1:45:34] Steel.
[1:45:35] He's owned it now for for quite a few
[1:45:37] years and I've been working with him
[1:45:39] since uh 1993
[1:45:44] 92 somewhere around there. Long time
[1:45:46] ago. Well, there there came a time a few
[1:45:49] years back that he said I'm going to
[1:45:52] step back. He didn't want to fully
[1:45:54] retire, but he didn't want to deal with
[1:45:56] the day-to-day operations of the
[1:45:58] business. And and he he brought all the
[1:46:01] guys together and he and he stood me in
[1:46:04] front of all these all the guys that
[1:46:05] work. We got about 20 20 people there
[1:46:07] that that work. And he said, "As of
[1:46:09] today,
[1:46:12] he's running the company.
[1:46:16] All authority
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. All power to run the things of
[1:46:21] the company is in his name. He said,
[1:46:24] "We've we've signed it. His He's now
[1:46:26] listed as the president of the company,
[1:46:28] and if anything's being done, it goes
[1:46:30] through him.
[1:46:32] And if there's anything that I want, he
[1:46:34] this is him speaking. Anything that he
[1:46:36] wants done, he's going to tell me." So,
[1:46:39] as I run the company, I still operate
[1:46:43] the business knowing my father's will.
[1:46:50] Y'all understand that?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; I don't run the company just the way I
[1:46:56] want to run the company.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I've been in my father's presence long
[1:47:01] enough.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I know his ultimate direction for the
[1:47:06] business.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; He has told me in private many times
[1:47:12] he's given me direction. He said this, I
[1:47:14] want to see the company move to this
[1:47:16] level. I want to see us to do this and I
[1:47:17] want to see see us do that. I want to
[1:47:19] see the company grow. I want to make
[1:47:21] sure that that our guys are taken care
[1:47:22] of and and all these things. So, as I
[1:47:25] operate the business as the president
[1:47:27] now, I have I have authority on paper
[1:47:31] that I could go in and spend every dime
[1:47:33] that the company had.
[1:47:36] I could I could write a check and and
[1:47:38] sign it and it would get cash,
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; but I would not be in the will of the
[1:47:45] father. That's good.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Because I know the direction that he
[1:47:49] wants the company to go.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; He's just vested power.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; He commissioned me to be in hisstead
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; to stand there in his place and speak.
[1:48:00] But the things that I'm speaking, I'm
[1:48:01] speaking what I have heard him say to me
[1:48:04] for years and years and years. And
[1:48:07] that's what we do with this word. Our
[1:48:10] father
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; has presented his will to us.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; It's up to us if we've been commissioned
[1:48:19] to move and to work within
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; his will.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Don't do it on your own.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Brother Brandon would tell
[1:48:29] he he would tell the the um he would
[1:48:31] tell the story about the um the
[1:48:34] policeman,
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:38] And um he said that that that policeman,
[1:48:42] he does not have the strength
[1:48:45] to step out there and stop
[1:48:49] a car. That's or you want say a
[1:48:51] semi-truck coming down the road and now
[1:48:54] there there's
[1:48:56] where's it at?
[1:49:00] But he walks out there.
[1:49:07] Guess what?
[1:49:10] I don't have the ability. I don't have
[1:49:12] the strength in me to stop a moving
[1:49:15] vehicle, but I guarantee you I walk out
[1:49:18] in that road and I flash this sheriff's
[1:49:21] badge in front of them, guess what?
[1:49:25] They're going to stop.
[1:49:27] Now, see the thing is, and I don't sure
[1:49:29] do y'all have an officer? Y'all have a a
[1:49:32] police officer? Okay. I didn't know if
[1:49:34] y'all had one that was a police officer
[1:49:36] in here. I was going to I I was hoping
[1:49:38] they would be. Pardon?
[1:49:40] Oh, you couldn't tell me. Okay. Now,
[1:49:43] see, the the thing is
[1:49:46] everything about this badge is real.
[1:49:52] Hold that. Look. Look at that.
[1:49:56] That's real. That's not a fake. That's
[1:49:59] real. See, I've got a I've got a friend
[1:50:01] of mine who is a who is a police
[1:50:02] officer, and I asked him the other day.
[1:50:04] I said, "Any chance I could borrow one
[1:50:08] of your badges?"
[1:50:10] He gracefully let me.
[1:50:13] He knows that I'm not going to do
[1:50:15] something wrong with it
[1:50:18] because, see, for me to stand out there
[1:50:21] now, they would respect that badge.
[1:50:30] Everybody's preaching for me.
[1:50:34] The the
[1:50:37] Yeah, we need help sometimes. Even
[1:50:39] though I'm an impersonator,
[1:50:42] I don't even have the authority
[1:50:45] to wield that badge. But they would
[1:50:48] respect that badge until they found out,
[1:50:52] wait a minute,
[1:50:54] You don't have authority.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; You're just holding up. You're
[1:50:57] impersonating an officer. And see, many
[1:51:00] people today
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; impersonate
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; a believer.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; They pick up the same word that you do.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; They'll use the same quotes that you do.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; And they have never been commissioned
[1:51:17] and authorized by God to use it.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; They become an impersonation.
[1:51:23] And they'll flash that badge and they
[1:51:25] want people to see that badge.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; They'll flash it in front of you. See
[1:51:30] what I know?
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; See what I know. You need to listen to
[1:51:33] me. I'm standing. You need to obey me.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; See, this badge is legit,
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; but I don't have the authority to use it
[1:51:44] in that way. I'm just using it as a
[1:51:46] sample tonight, as an example. But see,
[1:51:49] there's too many people today, sir,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; that are just impersonating being a true
[1:51:55] Christian.
[1:51:56] They pick up the same Bible you'd pick
[1:51:58] up. They'll speak those words out in
[1:52:01] front of you. Cuz I wanted Let's see.
[1:52:18] See, now I just bestowed
[1:52:22] a police badge to this young man right
[1:52:25] here.
[1:52:27] I vested, I commissioned him. If I had
[1:52:29] the true power and authority as a
[1:52:32] sheriff to deputize, that would be me
[1:52:36] commissioning him and me giving him
[1:52:38] authority now with that badge that he
[1:52:40] could go and he could hold that badge
[1:52:42] and he could the the authority that
[1:52:44] stood behind that badge would stand
[1:52:46] behind him.
[1:52:48] that's yours to keep.
[1:52:50] See, I gave it to him. He didn't come
[1:52:54] ask for it.
[1:52:56] But I chose to bestow it upon him.
[1:53:00] And that's what our heavenly father has
[1:53:02] done with us tonight. He chose you. He
[1:53:07] chose to place his word in your mouth.
[1:53:11] He chose to vest
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; to commission you
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; with his word to give you authority.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; But what are you going to do with it?
[1:53:21] Are you going to just keep it in your
[1:53:23] pocket?
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Are you actually going to wield it?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Are you going to use it in the way it
[1:53:30] was intended?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; He has commissioned you.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; He told you to speak his word.
[1:53:40] and to speak it with authority.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Everything, all the authority behind the
[1:53:48] Rutherford County Sheriff's Department
[1:53:50] would stand up for this badge right here
[1:53:53] if the right person is holding it.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just an impostor.
[1:54:01] But if the right person is holding it,
[1:54:04] if you have been commissioned by God
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; to use his word as kings and priests,
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; then the full authority of this word
[1:54:17] will stand behind you every single time
[1:54:21] that you speak it in faith believing.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That's what's the key.
[1:54:30] Unbelief hinders you.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; People, they they they're they say, "Oh,
[1:54:33] yeah. I I know the Lord. He He gave me
[1:54:35] that badge, but I just I don't know that
[1:54:38] I I don't know if if I can use it or
[1:54:40] not.
[1:54:42] He made you priests and kings.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; You didn't put yourself there.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He's the one who made you worthy.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Your righteousness did not.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; He chose you and he chose to place his
[1:54:56] word within you.
[1:54:59] Hallelujah.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Water that word.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Water that with the sacrifice of praise.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; We We're We're supposed to be priests
[1:55:08] and kings. Oh, brother brother Steve, we
[1:55:10] we talked a little bit week or so ago or
[1:55:14] something. I I I'd sent something to him
[1:55:15] and and and also there there's there's
[1:55:18] more that goes beyond that. I'm not
[1:55:19] going to get into all of that, but
[1:55:21] there's a there's a prophetic ministry
[1:55:23] that comes with the bride as well.
[1:55:26] prophet, priest, and king.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; MelkiseDC, prophet, priest, and king.
[1:55:35] That's that's what's been given to us.
[1:55:37] That's what has been vested in us. It's
[1:55:39] what has been bestowed to us and
[1:55:42] commissioned to use the authority of the
[1:55:44] word. But are you going to stay in the
[1:55:47] popper mentality? Are you going to stay
[1:55:49] in the mentality of a victim for the
[1:55:51] rest of your life? or are you going to
[1:55:53] stand up and speak the word and say, "I
[1:55:55] don't have to let this mountain stand in
[1:55:57] my way anymore.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; I don't have to let this this mountain
[1:56:02] of of doubt
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; stand in front of me.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; I've been given the authority of the
[1:56:08] word to speak it and move forward."
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Speak it and move forward.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; I have no idea where I'm at with my
[1:56:19] notes, but that's okay.
[1:56:23] 1 John 5:14.
[1:56:26] And this is the confidence that we have
[1:56:29] in him.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; That if we ask anything,
[1:56:35] see, a lot of people don't put that in.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; That's not convenient.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, it isn't convenient because then
[1:56:41] that means they have to pray and they
[1:56:44] have to lay before him to find out what
[1:56:45] his will is.
[1:56:47] But most people, they just want to say,
[1:56:50] "Anything that I ask, he's going to give
[1:56:53] it to me."
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:56:57] it's got to be in accordance with his
[1:56:58] will.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; That's how we're supposed to pray.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; When you go to him, you're supposed to
[1:57:06] pray, "If it be thy will."
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Know that that that's one of the four
[1:57:12] most difficult words to pray. Thy will
[1:57:16] be done.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; That's so difficult
[1:57:21] because my will is what I want.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; But when you go to him in prayer,
[1:57:27] that's how Christ prayed
[1:57:30] in the garden of Gethsemane whenever he
[1:57:32] was having to die out to himself.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "Not my will
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; but thine be done." That's that's
[1:57:40] ultimately the hardest four words I
[1:57:43] think that a Christian prays is thy will
[1:57:45] be done because that means that you're
[1:57:47] completely dying out to yourself and
[1:57:50] you're taking self-will and setting it
[1:57:51] aside. And you know we're we we like
[1:57:54] oursel.
[1:57:56] We're human. We we like our will. We
[1:57:58] like our ideas and we think most of the
[1:58:00] time that our ideas are the best.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; We have to set those things aside and
[1:58:04] accept what God has for us. We have to
[1:58:08] operate and move within his will.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; We have to know the will of the father.
[1:58:15] In in in Luke 10 verse 19, he says,
[1:58:18] "Behold, I give unto you power
[1:58:21] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:58:24] over all the power of the enemy. And
[1:58:28] nothing shall by any means hurt you."
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Who gave you that power? He did.
[1:58:36] He's the one who vested
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; that power to you. In the amplified, it
[1:58:42] reads like this. Listen carefully.
[1:58:44] I have given you authority that you now
[1:58:49] possess.
[1:58:50] Not going to possess,
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; you now possess to tread on serpents and
[1:58:56] scorpions and the ability to exercise.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Is it up there?
[1:59:05] The abil that's the
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. I'm in a different
[1:59:09] amplified. The ability to exercise
[1:59:12] authority over all the power of the
[1:59:16] enemy which is Satan. And nothing will
[1:59:19] in any way harm you.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; He's the one who has given us that
[1:59:23] power. His word has given us that power.
[1:59:27] In Matthew 10 verse one, he says, "And
[1:59:31] when he had called unto him the 12
[1:59:33] disciples, his 12 disciples, he gave
[1:59:35] them power against unclean spirits to
[1:59:38] cast them out and to heal all manner of
[1:59:41] sickness and all manner of disease."
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; What does that look like?
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; What does what does that look like it
[1:59:50] when that it's put into action?
[1:59:53] You know, we we read the um the the the
[1:59:56] quote from Brother Brandon when he was
[1:59:58] talking about Peter and John, but I'd
[2:00:00] like to read to you the um in Acts
[2:00:04] chapter 3, verses 1-16.
[2:00:09] Says, "Now Peter and John went up
[2:00:10] together into the temple at the hour of
[2:00:13] prayer."
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying to show you how how
[2:00:17] Matthew 10:1 has been put into action.
[2:00:21] went up together into the temple at the
[2:00:23] hour of prayer being the ninth hour. And
[2:00:25] a certain man lame from his mother's
[2:00:28] womb was carried whom they laid daily at
[2:00:32] the gate of the temple which is called
[2:00:34] beautiful to ask alms of them that
[2:00:36] entered into the temple who seeing Peter
[2:00:39] and John about to go into the temple
[2:00:42] asked an alms. And Peter fastening his
[2:00:46] eyes upon him with John said,
[2:00:50] "Look on us,
[2:00:53] and he gave heed unto them,
[2:00:56] expecting to receive something of them."
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; And then he got disappointed for just a
[2:01:02] moment.
[2:01:04] Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I
[2:01:09] none."
[2:01:12] And I'm sure that for just a moment
[2:01:16] that man thought, "Well, then why did
[2:01:19] you stop?
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm here."
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; I I I need some money. I I I need
[2:01:27] something to help get me a loan.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; And now you're going to stand here and
[2:01:31] waste my time by telling me, "Sorry, I
[2:01:35] ain't got no money."
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:01:37] Silver and gold have I none, but such as
[2:01:42] I have,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; but such as I have. Not such as I'm
[2:01:50] going to get,
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; such as I'm going to receive, but he
[2:01:54] said, such as I have, give I thee. In
[2:01:58] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[2:02:01] rise up and walk.
[2:02:04] And he took him by the right hand and
[2:02:07] lifted him up.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; And immediately
[2:02:12] his feet and ankle bones received
[2:02:14] strength.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; And he leaping up stood and walked and
[2:02:20] entered with them into the temple
[2:02:22] walking and leaping and praising God.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there's a lot there's a
[2:02:28] there's a whole lot just just right in
[2:02:30] there that that's going on and there's
[2:02:32] no way I can can go into all of that.
[2:02:34] But he I don't know how long he'd been
[2:02:37] lame from his mother's womb.
[2:02:40] I mean if you know anything if if that
[2:02:42] your muscles atrophy and and all these
[2:02:45] things and there's there would be
[2:02:46] absolutely no strength. That mean there
[2:02:48] was instantaneous
[2:02:50] recreation,
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; an instantaneous miracle that took place
[2:02:56] in his body.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; He could not help but jump up.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; He had never felt that strength before.
[2:03:04] And all of a sudden, that strength and
[2:03:05] energy hit him. There was nothing that
[2:03:07] was going to stop him from leaping to
[2:03:09] his feet and shouting because there was
[2:03:12] a miracle that had taken place. And
[2:03:14] there's miracles that take place in our
[2:03:16] lives every day. And sometimes we're
[2:03:18] just we keep quiet about it.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't I don't want to make such
[2:03:23] a big to-do about it.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; He made a big deal about it.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; He wanted everybody to know and see what
[2:03:29] God had done for him.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't going to need to be out there
[2:03:32] no more begging for for alms. He was
[2:03:36] going to be able to provide for himself.
[2:03:38] All right.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; You know, there was a um I don't if
[2:03:41] you've ever read any of uh uh anything
[2:03:44] by Thomas Aquinus.
[2:03:47] Thomas Aquinas. He was a uh 13th century
[2:03:51] um with the uh with the Catholic uh
[2:03:54] church I believe. Um but there was a
[2:03:57] time um he had went to the pope and um
[2:04:02] it was a time that that that
[2:04:05] they were counting a lot of income, a
[2:04:06] lot of revenue that had been coming in
[2:04:08] to the to the church. And the and the
[2:04:10] pope, he was kind of bold and and and he
[2:04:14] he looked over at Thomas Aquinas and he
[2:04:16] says, "No longer do we have to say as
[2:04:21] Peter, silver and gold have I none.
[2:04:26] And Thomas Aquinas looked at the pope
[2:04:28] and he says, "And neither can you, as
[2:04:31] Peter say, rise up and walk."
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; See, it was all just finery. It was all
[2:04:40] beauty. It was all just a business.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; As brother Joe was talking, just it was
[2:04:46] just a business plan. It was just a way
[2:04:48] for money to come in. And that pope was
[2:04:51] he was bragging on, "Oh, we're not like
[2:04:53] Peter. We we don't have to say silver
[2:04:56] and gold have I none. They had they have
[2:04:58] all of it. They're they're they're so
[2:05:00] they're so rich,
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; but they have no power.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, and like like but like
[2:05:09] Peter, you can't say rise up and walk. I
[2:05:13] don't care about this gold. I don't care
[2:05:15] about the silver. I don't care about
[2:05:17] anything this world has to give.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; You can have it all. You can take it
[2:05:22] all. But I want to be able to operate
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; within the power and the authority of
[2:05:28] God's word because that is what makes a
[2:05:31] difference.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; You can have all of the wealth of this
[2:05:34] world
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; and if you don't have him, you have
[2:05:39] absolutely nothing.
[2:05:42] And if you don't have a revelation
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; of who you are in him,
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; then you are living way below the
[2:05:53] privileges that you have been given.
[2:05:55] That he wants you to live. He doesn't
[2:05:56] want you to live just halfway.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; He said, I would I would that you have
[2:06:02] life and have it
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; more abundantly.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; It's it's not just barely getting by.
[2:06:10] It's abundant life.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; That's the life that he has given to you
[2:06:15] and me.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; It's It's not that we have, as I said
[2:06:18] before, we we're not supposed to stay in
[2:06:20] that popper mentality.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Step into your position
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; as king and priest. Step into the
[2:06:27] position as sons and daughters of God.
[2:06:30] Take his word in your mouth and speak
[2:06:34] his word with the authority that he has
[2:06:37] vested within you that he has
[2:06:39] commissioned you to use.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; He put it there.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Now, if I if I was to try to go out to
[2:06:46] the road, like I said, as that police
[2:06:48] officer, and I walk out and I'm just in
[2:06:50] in just normal clothes and I walked
[2:06:52] there and put my hand up, guess what?
[2:06:53] They're just going to keep blowing on by
[2:06:55] me.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; But I if I go out there and I actually
[2:06:58] use
[2:07:00] what's been given to me and I stand up
[2:07:02] and I flash that in front of them. Guess
[2:07:04] what? They're going to apply their
[2:07:05] brakes and they're going to come to a
[2:07:07] screech and halt.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; And that's what has to happen for us. We
[2:07:12] have to put the devil in his place.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; But the only way you're going to put him
[2:07:16] in his place is you better know your
[2:07:17] place.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; If you don't know your place,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; everything is going to get out of whack.
[2:07:27] You must know your position. You must
[2:07:30] know the will of the father.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And then you must operate within that
[2:07:35] will.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; I've got to skip down some.
[2:07:42] I got to I've got to skip some. You
[2:07:44] know, they they came to um they they
[2:07:46] came to Peter um Annis and Caiaphas and
[2:07:49] the different ones uh the Sadducees.
[2:07:52] They they came to to Peter and they they
[2:07:54] threw up this at him. Well, by what
[2:07:56] power,
[2:07:58] by what name
[2:08:01] have you done this?
[2:08:04] His response was, "By the name of Jesus
[2:08:08] Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; whom God raised from the dead, even by
[2:08:16] him do this man stand here before you
[2:08:19] whole." Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Another reference to the message from
[2:08:24] brother Wesley. This is the stone which
[2:08:27] the builders This is the stone which was
[2:08:30] set at not of you builders which has
[2:08:33] become the head of the corner.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Peter wasn't ashamed to say that it
[2:08:39] wasn't done by him.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Peter wasn't trying to take credit.
[2:08:47] Peter wasn't trying to make a name for
[2:08:48] himself. He wasn't going to stand up in
[2:08:50] front of them and and say, "I did it.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; It was all me. All me." No. He said it
[2:08:59] was by his name.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where power lies.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Power lies in the name of Jesus. It
[2:09:06] don't lie in my name.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; It don't lie in your name.
[2:09:11] in power lies in the name of Jesus.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; It wasn't his power that had been given.
[2:09:19] It was the authority to speak the name
[2:09:21] of Jesus
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; over any situation.
[2:09:25] You've been given that power. You've
[2:09:27] been given that authority to speak his
[2:09:30] name over any situation
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; and watch it be resolved.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; But we have to put it into action.
[2:09:39] You you don't want to just, you know, it
[2:09:41] you don't want to just keep it in your
[2:09:43] pocket.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't do any good if it
[2:09:46] just stays in your pocket.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; It doesn't do any good if you study and
[2:09:49] you read. That's great. But until you
[2:09:52] speak it,
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; it
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; that's that's where the power lies. It's
[2:09:56] in the spoken word.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; The Rama. That's whenever that's that's
[2:10:00] whenever things take place. Whenever you
[2:10:02] speak his word,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; reading his word is great.
[2:10:07] dwelling in his presence. You need to
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; but you have to speak his word.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; That's whenever it t that's whenever
[2:10:16] action happens is by speaking his word.
[2:10:19] It was demonstrated in um Mark 11 um
[2:10:23] when when Jesus spoke to the fig tree.
[2:10:27] You know it said in um in Mark 11:20-24
[2:10:30] said in the morning as they passed by
[2:10:31] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[2:10:33] roots. Peter calling to remembrance
[2:10:35] saith to him, Master, behold the fig
[2:10:37] tree which thou cursseth is withered
[2:10:39] away. Jesus answering saith unto him,
[2:10:43] have faith in God.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, that's just too
[2:10:48] simple." Well, that's that was the words
[2:10:50] of Jesus himself.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. For verily I say unto
[2:10:56] you that whosoever
[2:10:58] How many whosoevers do we have?
[2:11:01] Whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; be thou removed,
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; and be thou cast into the sea,
[2:11:13] and shall not doubt.
[2:11:17] It's key. Shall not doubt in his heart,
[2:11:21] but shall believe that those things
[2:11:23] which he saith shall come to pass, he
[2:11:26] shall have whatsoever he saith.
[2:11:29] Therefore I say unto you, what things
[2:11:32] soever ye desire when ye pray, believe
[2:11:36] that you receive them, and ye shall have
[2:11:39] them.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; It's important to believe.
[2:11:44] It's important to know his will.
[2:11:48] It's imperative that you walk in his
[2:11:51] will.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Imperative. That's the only way it
[2:11:56] happens. It's the only way it works. It
[2:11:59] must be in alignment with his will. And
[2:12:02] I tell you tonight, I I believe that
[2:12:03] we're living below our privileges.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; He He has given so much to us. He has
[2:12:12] offered so much to us. He has placed so
[2:12:14] many things before us and yet we don't
[2:12:18] take advantage of our position and the
[2:12:22] authority that we have with his word.
[2:12:26] We were not made to be defeated
[2:12:29] Christians.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; We're not made to be a defeated
[2:12:34] individual.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Benjamin Benjamin sing the song
[2:12:39] this evening. I was made for more.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; See, brother Benjamin didn't know what I
[2:12:45] was preaching tonight.
[2:12:47] God did.
[2:12:49] I I I sent him a text this afternoon and
[2:12:52] I said um said, "Hey, is there a chance
[2:12:55] that you could sing?" I said, "Well, I I
[2:12:57] think the way I phrased it, do you do
[2:13:00] you have the song Made for More in in
[2:13:04] your things songs that you plan to sing
[2:13:06] this this week or I forgot exactly how I
[2:13:09] word it. I could pull it back up, but
[2:13:10] something to that that effect." And um I
[2:13:13] said because I I would love for you to
[2:13:15] sing that song this evening at the end
[2:13:18] of service. And his response was,
[2:13:22] "Well, I I already was thinking about
[2:13:25] singing that song, but would it be okay
[2:13:27] if I went ahead and sang it at the
[2:13:29] beginning of service and then we could
[2:13:31] follow up with it at the end of
[2:13:32] service?" And he said, "Would that is
[2:13:34] that going to affect anything?" I said,
[2:13:35] "No, not anything. To me, it just
[2:13:40] solidifies
[2:13:42] that that was what God wanted done
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; because he didn't know that I was going
[2:13:47] to send him a text and ask could he sing
[2:13:50] that song because I know that I was made
[2:13:53] for more.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; I know that you are made for more
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; and there's more for you to be had
[2:13:59] tonight.
[2:14:00] If you will choose to walk in what God
[2:14:04] has given to you,
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; we we we don't have to to barely get by
[2:14:11] in our spiritual walk.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; He has given you such a higher level
[2:14:15] that he wants you to step into.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Such a higher level of praise.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; And then whenever you enter into that
[2:14:24] level, there's it it's limitless to what
[2:14:27] God can do. when you enter in to those
[2:14:30] places with him. He'd say, "Brother
[2:14:33] Brandham, um he he made a comment on and
[2:14:35] and I don't even know if uh if I wrote
[2:14:38] down where it was at. It's okay. If you
[2:14:40] need me to find it, I'll find it for
[2:14:42] you. If you don't trust me, he he said,
[2:14:44] "Get some spunk about you."
[2:14:49] You can you can search for that word
[2:14:51] spunk.
[2:14:53] Get some spunk about you. Stand up and
[2:14:55] claim your God-given privileges. God
[2:14:59] promised you healing. It's yours.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; He's promised it to you. It's yours. Get
[2:15:08] some spunk about you and claim it. Take
[2:15:11] hold of it.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; You're not going to take what's mine
[2:15:16] away from me. I know it's mine. I I I
[2:15:18] guarantee you, you take some of these
[2:15:20] the little ones that's in here and
[2:15:21] they've they've gotten to that place. It
[2:15:23] only takes them about about 18 months of
[2:15:28] life. 18 to 24 months. Maybe not even
[2:15:31] that long, but at least no no longer
[2:15:34] than 18 months. And they understand the
[2:15:36] word mine.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz you go to take something away from
[2:15:41] them. Mine.
[2:15:43] Or their brother or sister tries to take
[2:15:45] something from them and it's mine.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Mine. Mine.
[2:15:51] It's mine.
[2:15:53] Every single promise
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; that's in this book is mine.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be like that 2-year-old
[2:16:01] and like my three-year-old that's going
[2:16:03] to fight you over it.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; You try to take it away from me, I'm
[2:16:08] going to come at you and I'm going to
[2:16:09] say, "No, it's mine.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; You can claim it for yourself, but
[2:16:13] that's mine."
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Why can't we have that spunk about
[2:16:17] us as adults?
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; I think we should. We have to. Amen.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; We have to sir.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; We We've got to come to that place that
[2:16:26] we say, "It's mine. I see where he gave
[2:16:29] it to me and it's mine." Brother Brandon
[2:16:31] would talk about if you if if you were
[2:16:32] given a like a a big warehouse or
[2:16:35] something and that it was given to you,
[2:16:36] he said, "I would walk every corner of
[2:16:39] it. I would open up every box." Now, I'm
[2:16:41] paraphrasing, but I would go through
[2:16:44] every every place in there and check it
[2:16:46] out. So, I want to know what's mine.
[2:16:50] I want to know what's mine.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; I want to open up every single page and
[2:16:55] read it and take it in and eat it and
[2:16:58] know what's mine. And then I'm going to
[2:17:00] act upon what's mine.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; It's my inheritance.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; It was given to me.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; My name is written in the will.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Your name is written in the will, too.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go through here and
[2:17:17] spend all the time to tell you what's
[2:17:18] yours.
[2:17:20] But I'm going to tell me what's mine.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; When I go to listen and I want to read
[2:17:25] the will, I've got a copy of my father's
[2:17:27] will. I keep it in a safe spot cuz I can
[2:17:31] open up that and I can read it and I can
[2:17:33] see the things that he has said upon my
[2:17:35] death. This you're going to receive
[2:17:37] this. You're going to receive this.
[2:17:38] You're going to receive this. You're
[2:17:39] going to receive this.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; And he rose again.
[2:17:49] And he gave you so many promises.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Don't be lax. Don't be slack in reading
[2:17:58] it and receiving what's yours.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Get some spunk about you.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Could I ask the musicians to come this
[2:18:07] evening? And I want to I want to to to
[2:18:09] end with with with just a uh just a
[2:18:13] couple more words if they would come and
[2:18:15] if brother Benjamin would uh would would
[2:18:18] come and and if he could sing that song
[2:18:20] again for us this evening. Not him just
[2:18:22] sing it but lead us within that song. In
[2:18:25] the message believest thou this
[2:18:29] brother Ram said the coming of the Lord
[2:18:30] is at hand.
[2:18:33] The church ought to be moving on into
[2:18:37] their powers.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Science can only climb so far and then
[2:18:41] it has to drop off.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; But we got untapped
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; sources.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's never been touched of the power
[2:18:50] unlimited of God that we ought to be
[2:18:53] moving into. He said, "We're living a
[2:18:56] million miles under our privilege
[2:18:58] tonight of privileges of Christians to
[2:19:01] be enjoying." And he said, "I feel
[2:19:03] ashamed of myself." This is Brother
[2:19:06] Brandham. "I feel ashamed of myself when
[2:19:09] I look out here and see the institutions
[2:19:11] and the sickness and the troubles that's
[2:19:14] going on right now. Our church ought to
[2:19:16] be walking the street, healing the sick,
[2:19:18] raising the dead, casting out devils,
[2:19:20] doing signs and wonders, making the
[2:19:23] whole world realize that Jesus Christ
[2:19:26] lives.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; He lives.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; He lives.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; He lives.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; He lives in me.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; He needs to live in you, too.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; And if he lives, you should be saying
[2:19:40] the same thing. He lives.
[2:19:43] He's just not he's not a story in a
[2:19:46] book.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; He's a living word
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; and he's living in a bride of this day.
[2:19:52] He's living in you and me. And there's a
[2:19:55] work for us to do.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; There's authority that we've been given.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; You've been given the the authority to
[2:20:04] use the word to speak to whatever
[2:20:06] problem, to whatever situation is
[2:20:09] standing in front of you right now.
[2:20:12] Right.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; We sang we sang this the the song when I
[2:20:18] began. Speak to the mountain.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; You may have a mountain. Now, some of
[2:20:24] you may not have anything that's in
[2:20:26] front of you. May maybe maybe everything
[2:20:29] is smooth for you right now, but I
[2:20:30] guarantee you that there are those in
[2:20:32] this church tonight that have a mountain
[2:20:34] and stand in front of them. Sure.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; But through his word,
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; through his word,
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; you can speak to that mountain.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; And it may be only one pebble
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; that moves.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; And you may it may not look like
[2:20:56] anything is happening, but give it time.
[2:20:59] Yes.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Keep speaking to it
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; and speak believing. Don't let unbelief
[2:21:07] creep in at all.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; You must cast unbelief aside.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Whenever you speak to it, it must be
[2:21:15] spoken in faith.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; It most must be spoken in faith
[2:21:20] believing that it's going to take place.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; It can't be a hope so. Can't be a maybe
[2:21:26] so. It's I know that by his word I can
[2:21:31] claim these things.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; We have been made for so much more.
[2:21:34] Would you stand with me this evening?
[2:21:37] Would you please receive the power and
[2:21:39] authority that he has vested into you
[2:21:43] this evening? Walk into it. Step into
[2:21:46] it. Use it.
[2:21:49] Get some spunk about you
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; and speak it.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Step into your position tonight. Speak
[2:21:56] the name of Jesus over every situation.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Every situation.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; We must speak his name. Speak through
[2:22:06] his word in accordance with his will.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Benjamin. Please
[2:22:12] sing.
[2:22:19] Cuz I know who I am.
[2:22:24] Cuz I know who you are.

[2:22:35] is only
[2:22:37] the start.

[2:37:35] than anything that I'm dealing with.

[2:38:12] the enemy.
[2:38:15] We don't like to dwell on him too much
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; because he likes to make us doubt.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; So, standing here with all of these
[2:38:26] people tonight,
[2:38:28] we've all been big, bad, and bold.
[2:38:32] We've got some spunk in us, brother.

[2:38:38] we got some spunk in us.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; And we sang mountain, you've got to
[2:38:44] move.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; But I just want to encourage you tonight
[2:38:48] as a fellow believer
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; that when the doubt comes when you're
[2:38:53] all alone,
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to sing those same words.

[2:39:18] of Jesus Christ.
[2:39:24] And every promise that he made me in the
[2:39:27] book is yes and amen.

[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; I've been spoken to directly.
[2:39:50] I asked the Lord for it today and he
[2:39:52] answered
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; and I'm so grateful.

[2:40:42] set up and further decorating tonight
[2:40:46] before some go to bed. And so, we don't
[2:40:50] want to keep them out late. They're
