we're thankful I'm so thankful for the angel of the Lord that appeared to him and told him what his ministry would be and that he would stand before Kings and potentates and God was faithful to that word and we are thankful we're thankful and then on and that was in 1946 then on Wednesday May the 8th the next day is the anniversary of brother brandom's extreme visitation beyond the curtain of time I want you to know that answers a lot of questions for me and I'm very thankful for that and then on Friday of this week is Sister Imo's birthday in Japan and I want to I want to wave at sister IMO and I want to say happy birthday to you on the other side of the world we love you and appreciate you she may not be streaming but she will see this in archive a lot of times they're up watching different uh different time I don't know what the time is it may be maybe tomorrow might be Monday there I don't know what it is but there are special meetings going on this weekend in Japan and we've already been praying for them that God will manifest himself there in a mighty way there are many many many people in Japan who don't know the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ they've never even heard the Salvation message and so we we're thankful for the little group that is there and for the pastor that is there and he's a fine man of God and he's doing a wonderful job and we're very glad that they have a place that they can go and and fellowship we're we're blessed God sent them to us can you imagine you know getting a re ration that you should be baptized you're Japanese you're a Christian you haven't really had a a Full Gospel message presented to you and you hear it because of a newsletter that came to you from Jerusalem you hear about this little church in Alabama and you fly to the other side of the world to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what sister IMO did with her daughter F and they were some of the very first Believers in the entire nation of Japan to accept this message there was no Fellowship going on before and we're thankful that there is now isn't God good he is so faithful I want to thank you all that uh many of you have uh sent me cards and handed me cards and and gifts and I have on a new tie today from sister Kathy uh for for my birthday and I have a new mug that says Papa Bear and uh and just all kind and and fudge sister Terry knew I had lost a few pounds this week and she was determined to reverse it and she made look she's red I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to embarrass you like that and know bookmark leather and I've got all kinds of things thank you so much for thinking about me and uh and the and the and the love Gifts of of of offering of money too thank you I appreciate all that I want to brag on brother gley he's not here to hear it so it's easier to brag on him then but uh we we uh prayed for him Tuesday night and we asked the Lord to give him courage and boldness and to use him in a mighty way he is in Napoleon Ohio I don't know exactly where that is but Ohio is a big state and Napoleon is a long way from here I think it's probably 11 or 12 hours away and they drove and it was a new place um I think I may be the one that mentioned this church to him because I had listened to the pastor who was preaching a fine message on on the paganism of Christmas and of course that got the title got my attention and I hope that it wouldn't disappoint me and it did not it was an outstanding message I and so brother gy was going to be up that way last September and he went by there on a Wednesday night and just visited the church and so the pastor brother Cameron Smith invited him to come and preach well it dawned on me that that I have a subscription to their YouTube and uh I thought well maybe it will be live and so I'm sitting in my chair last night and I found brother gley preaching now he had already started preaching and I want you to know that he was doing an absolute outstanding job and the people I couldn't see all the congregation only the first few rows but the people were so responsive and were pulling on him and the harder they pulled the Bolder he got now I'm might not ought to say this but sister Joyce sent me a text and she knew immediately I sent brother gley a text and I said that was some fine preaching which surprised him he had no idea that I was listening sister Joyce asked an honest question and she might not have told him she did so now he will know she said be honest brother Shelly was there any time that you lost your breath anticipating how the crowd would receive what what Wes was saying and I said yes yes more than once I lost my breath I had to gasp to get more oxygen because I thought he is really pushing the envelope but he created such a hunger the Holy Ghost through him created such a Hunger for More Of God and he prayed for many after the service and I didn't get to see all of what was going going on some of it was off camera but your prayers I just wanted you to know your prayers for him were answered and I trust that God is doing outstanding things there this morning and I pray and and uh certainly hope that he will have another invitation back after the service was over brother gy made some statement in the preaching he said you know brother brandham tells us if you're eating Cherry Pie and you come to a seed or a pit he said you don't you don't discard the whole pie you just spit out the seed and uh that's right that's right and so when the pastor got up I always you know those few little speeches that those few words after an evangelist that the pastor speaks are very important words they're very heavy words and you can usually tell what the pastor's Thinking by what he says after did you all know that so the pastor got up and he and he bragged on it and he said I couldn't find one seed to spit out it was nothing but the truth I appreciate that I appreciate the Lord using our brother amen he's a blessing to us and I appreciate the Lord using him that way and we want to give all the glory and the honor to the Lord let's stand again I think that's it I I almost could but let let's let that be the music why don't we give these musicians a great thank [Applause] you hallelujah amen amen are you ready yes let's go to Acts chapter 17 and we're going to read verses 23 through 30 acts chap 17 verses 23 through 30 for as I pass by and be held your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands can you say Amen neither is worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all what does all mean all all means all a l all God has G that's all God is giving to us all life and breath and all things all and haveth made of one blood this is powerful transfusion one blood whether you're African or North American whether you're European or asan come on you a as a Believer you are you have received a blood transfusion and now the blood that is flowing through your veins is divine blood it is the blood of the Lamb God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation now this is an interesting verse of scripture because it boldly decrees and declares the sovereignty of God I want you to know God is Sovereign we serve a God who is more powerful than his enemy he's more powerful than luck he's more powerful than fate God is Sovereign he has made of one blood all nations of the earth those who have been born from above and then the next verse that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him feelings don't matter they do matter feeling a feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us what a paradox many have spent years searching for the Lord finally finding him he was right there all all the time it was not until our eyes were open that we could see him now I want you to pay very careful attention to verse 28 for in him for in him we live in him we live say that with me in him we live and move and move and and have our being our existence is in him my daily life is in him my daily bread my provision is in him my breath is in him everything that I have is found because I am in him for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your Poets of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring what a word what a revelation we are sons of God we are of his seed remember the Bible said and his seed remaineth in them that they cannot not sin that word seed is is the Sperma that we were talking about in Greek you have in you by the New Birth the very Sperma the very life seed of God and Satan can never take that from you never your enemies can never take that from you and it's not something that you can ever lose right once that spermac seed of God is in you we won't talk about how it gets there that's quite a debatable subject this morning and one for another time but once that Sperma of God life of God seed of God is in you you can never lose it there's nothing to replace it pretty powerful for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone Graven by Art and man's device and the time at and the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent not knowing who God is used to be an offense that God winked at but no longer because the full revelation of who God is has come to planet Earth and because it has visited us one generation ago ignorance is no longer tolerated by God now if that's the case then it's God's responsibility to get the word to those people he uses men he uses men but if there's anybody out there that has not yet had an opportunity it's up to God he's Sovereign to get that word to them may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated for in him we live and move verse 28 and have our being as certain also of your own prophets have said for we are also his offspring the life of Messiah is in US hello and so therefore we have been Messiah it's a translation of the Greek you have been Anointed with messiah's anointing Amen brother brandom tells us clearly the anointing is a person powerful it's a person it's the only person of the godhead well I thought that was Jesus it is the anointing is a person it's not a feeling when you have had fellowship with the person you're going to feel something this quickening power this unction from the Holy One will Quicken your mortal body in time of Resurrection it will Quicken your mortal body when you sit under the revealed word it will Quicken your mortal body when you come to praise and worship him and create an atmosphere for Jesus Christ to come and prove himself to be the same today yesterday today and forever so it's not just some smoke the anointing is not just a cloud it's not just a haze in the room the anointing is a person and you have received of the Holy Spirit the anointing of the Messiah the anointing of the Lord Jesus Christ and therefore you are an offspring of almighty God now that's what the word I just read I didn't read that from the message book I read that from the Bible you are also his offspring you are right now right now though not fully expressed though not fully manifested you right now are an offspring of God right now right now say right now I am a manifested Son of God somebody say well what if there's no manifestation in my life are you here are you here are you living in 2024 then you've been [Music] manifested you've been manifested you were once a thought in the mind of God he spoke you into existence it was not your mother and father they provided the DNA and the genetics that form the flesh body that you're living in but the reality of who you really are it's not found in mortal flesh it's not in the DNA it's not in the genetic code of your life it's found in the inner man it's that breath that God breathed into Adam and made that's Spirit New Testament Numa that is Greek and it is breath it is the air of God it is the Breath of God he breathed that breath into our Adam and Adam was no longer just a flesh body he was now a flesh body that contained The Very Spirit the very breath of almighty God as soon as that breath came into his flesh body he was then given a soul and that Soul remember and Man became a living Soul he was once just a body of Flesh stay with me then Spirit was breathed in to him and when Spirit entered into flesh Adam would have had no way of contacting his environment his physical body would have given him five senses and he could have contacted his environment around him physically through the five senses but that's not the environment we're talking about we're talking about the glory realm we're talking about the spirit realm and so God gave him that ability then to create uh to contact both Physical Realm and also the spiritual realm that was no longer in heaven it was now living inside of him then the fall came and his Spirit was fallen and his Spirit would have need to be regenerated or redeemed you are unlike Adam in this sense you came here with with a fallen Spirit you came here with an adamic nature you and every other Generation all the way back to Adam came to this Earth with a fallen spirit and a fallen nature dwelling and reigning in your flesh you and I had to come to the New Birth and in that new birth the the very Holy Ghost of God the very Zoe the the life of God was transferred into us by the new birth what did we do we repented we repented of our sin we were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we were filled with the Holy Ghost and now the very Breath of God the life of God breathed into us in the New Birth it went right into the Fallen Spirit it went right into the Fallen part of who we were and reject generated us can you imagine when Spirit dies it's dead but when God breathes into Fallen Spirit it is now recreated in the new birth and it comes forth whole and it's just like what lives in you and I it's just like the life that Adam received of God in the garden are you with me well then why don't I this and why don't I that and why why don't I other because we're on a journey we are a tripartate man and every part of us must be redeemed back to the father's original thoughts about us we must have a redeemed and regenerated Spirit we must have a redeemed and regenerated soul and one day we must have a regenerated and redeemed body then we have what John G call full salvation we understand that you can have the Holy Spirit on your flesh and you can dance and you can run and you can jump and you can talk in tongues and brother brandom said you can be lost he said you can go straight to hell now I know Pentecostal theology struggles with that because they think once somebody talk in tongues they've reached the Pinnacle but it's possible to talk in tongues with just an anointing falling on your flesh but there is an anointing that's deeper than that it's the indwelling presence of almighty God it's the life of Jesus Christ Living in The Believer it's the anointing of the Messiah and once we have that then in him in him we live the life that I now live the Apostle said is not my own life I'm living messiah's life oh how important that is it's not only important for it to happen it's important for us to know that it has happened it's important for us to testify that it has happened it's important for us to live like it has happened right hello wow I think I'm going to preach about three hours today if I do it won't be based on your amens cuz they're a little lacking I'm going to say like they say in Ghana you need to sanctify your amen your amen needs to get saved when we understand through this message what God has done on the inside of us we we are compelled we are behooved we are moved upon to live a different ordered life we can't follow after the flesh it will never let me tell you something if you're depending on your flesh to get you to church on Sunday you'll never come if you're depending on your flesh to give you the want to to pay your tithe you'll never pay your tithe if you're to depending on the flesh to cause you to be kind and do good deeds for one another it's not likely that's going to happen because this flesh has a nature and that nature is not running after God but you have another nature one that's on the inside of you one that's the real who you are and that nature will lead your soul to the things of God if you will continue to feed and strengthen your regeneration spirit and we do that on the Living Word we don't do that on the dead preaching of YouTube we don't do that on this Doctrine and that Doctrine and the other Doctrine hello we don't do that by listening to this one and that one and the other one who preach all kinds of things because the modern church has lost their mind we stick with the revealed word of the hour we hear it we feed on it we bask on it and we are changed by it that doesn't mean that somebody out there doesn't say something good that can inspire you but there's only one word to dress you and that's the revealed word this bride is not going to be dressed in denominational sermons she's not going to be dressed on denominational YouTube clips she's going to only be D oh it's quiet she's only going to be dressed in the revealed word of God God went to a lot of trouble to get this truth to us and we should value it we should value it with everything that is within us the New Testament reveals to us that Christ is you know when we read scripture for surface it sounds like that Christ is the head and we alone are the body and we must depend on the neck to connect us but we don't take one scripture we don't take one quote we take them all and when we take them all we find out that Christ is not only the head but he's also represented himself in the body we're not depending on a neck to connect us we're depending on messiah's life to connect us and we are connected to the head so Christ messia the anointed one is represented both in the head and in the body now Jesus technically is our head we make up the body but remember as the bride church we have messiah's anointing not just on our flesh but in us all the way in hello hello all the way in not just a surface thing a feeling a goosebump a jump or a hoop or a holler but something that causes us to walk different and talk different and live different and dress different we listen to different music than what the world listens to we get our high in a different way than how the world gets their High hello we get our thrill in a different way than how the world gets their thrill there's something wrong with you if you're always looking to The World To Thrill you the greatest thrill that any man or woman could ever have is to come in contact with the precious power of the Holy Ghost now that'll thrill you brother and it's not just an emotional thrill it's a thrill that changes it's a transforming Thrill is anybody hearing the preacher it transforms Ms us from glory to glory from Faith to Faith from strength to strength so when we put the head Christ and the body Christ together when we see by the word head joined to the body then together we form the corporate Messiah the Messiah hasn't gone he didn't leave the Earth remember what he said when he was leaving I'm going to come to you you're going to have to let my flesh body go we like to hold on to people we like to hold on to flesh we find Comfort when we meet a god with skin on him we find comfort in that whether it's our mother or our preacher or our wife or our husband or whatever it is when we find somebody who has God living in them and we can feel and experience God in that person's life we want to hold on to them forever Jesus said it is expedient for you it is totally necessary anybody here it is totally necessary for you that I go away because if I do not go away what I carry what's on the inside of me cannot fall on you there can't be but one of us here at a time one body but if I take my body elsewhere then there'll be a new body for messiah hear me there will be a new body for messiah to live in and it won't be a one man body it won't be just a prophet's body it won't be just a pastor's body it won't be just a faith healer's body it'll be a many membered body it'll be your body and my body and your body and your body and your body and that makes up corporate Messiah he's now corporate he's now living in a many membered body hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I feel like so many times we work so hard to convince you of what's living inside of you because you're Fe feelings will tell you other things your feelings will magnify any unbelief that's left in you or any area of your life where you still need a change how many of you have some place in your life that you still need a change and you know what that's all right nothing wrong with that you're here you're in the right atmosphere look lately I've been getting test monies from people who didn't have hands laid on them and God met their need now that is in the presence of corporate Messiah when you get plugged into a body where messiah's living then you don't necessarily have to line up and do it the oldfashioned way didn't he tell us that that new ministry was coming and under that new anointing we wouldn't have to be prayed for like Methodist and always having hands laid on us now don't you misunderstand me I am 110% for prayer lines I've been recently hearing sermons against prayer lines may I just humbly say that is stupid that's not the spirit of God that's the spirit of stupid and you just let that person have a need you just let people who don't believe in that have a problem and they're going to ask somebody to pray for them and there some of them aren't going to be happy if you don't lay your hand on them right they want that contact laying on of hands is not necessary but how many of you no it's a way that God has chosen to move and it's a point of contact what it is it's messiah in you contacting [Music] messiah in somebody else we have called it here Spirit to Spirit Fellowship too much Fellowship takes place in the realm of Flesh anybody with me just flesh just getting together in the flesh talking about [Music] ball talking about this golf now it's pickle ball next month it'll be something else for an old-fashioned Church we're sure a trendy Church for a while it was drones and and model cars and oh airsoft guns everybody shooting one another I I'll be honest I can understand why that would be a stress relief cuz you know it wasn't a bullet it was just it was just going to stun them let them know you were out there none of these things are wrong nothing it's not wrong folks to have some kind of of Outlet or or entertainment or something like that but if you get together and that's all you talk about then your soul your flesh is going to be gratified and your soul is going to be strengthened soul is mind will and emotion if you get together and all you talk about is how she hurt your feelings and how you're rejected and your kids never invited and that's going to talize the Flesh and feed the soul it's going to make your soul a sumo wrestler your mind is going to get fat your will is going to get fat your emotions are going to get fat and the spirit man on remember I know there message Believers lising this that believe that we've reversed the order so please just apply everything we say to to the spirit about the spirit in your in your uh Paradigm as soul and vice versa but when I read scripture I find that the order of things is Body Soul and Spirit and so don't don't be upset because I've called it something differently see it as you would normally see it regardless of what it's called the soul that middle part of who you are or the spirit if that's your Doctrine is mine will and emotions and it will desire to eat up and draw strength from everything around you it stirs up competition and emulation it stirs up smack talk it stirs up selfish ambition instead of spiritual desire did you know there are some people who think they're following us a desire of the spirit and really they're underneath a selfish ambition they're looking to build a Ministry for a name or for a reputation they they they do it in the Name of Christ but Christ is not glorified do you understand if you're going to feed the spirit man the spirit man is very finicky it doesn't discern scores it doesn't discern Heroes it doesn't discern superheroes it doesn't discern hippie talk it doesn't pick up those things the spirit only feeds on the revealed word sir why because that's what it was born from remember we have heard that we have a word birth remember the anointing is a person and the person is the word manifested so they're one in the same you were born by the spirit of the word by the spirit of the word by the spirit because of the word how many of you have had a word birth then the only thing that will feed that in your life is the revealed word if you'll let the spirit man get fat if you'll let the word that part of you the word part of you begin to grow it will become the sumo wrestler and it'll take care of the stick man if you starve your emotions W I'm not off of page one you've got to starve your emotions how do you do that by understanding what he said what does feelings believe I'll just have a little water here well I feel well I feel well I feel well she made me feel well he made me feel well I always feel feel feel feel if you're going to feel you need to feel after God don't feel after the emotions if you let your emotions reach out listen if you wear your feelings I'm going to call names in a minute if you let your feelings lead you and you always wear them on your sleeve they'll get knocked off there's some of us who are gifted in it and we will surely knock them off then you'll cut us off because people don't want [Music] relationship because relationship is give and take they want somebody who will yes yes that's right you're you're right you're right oh they want a sympathizer and that's not what relationship does relationship is not about enabling somebody to starve their Spirit man relationship is about sometimes speaking the truth in love we gravitate ha toward people who are non-confrontational because we don't want anybody to tell us like we are we like yes men and yes women around us come on talk to us holy ghost but relationship is made up of those who will also say now you are acting like the rear end of a horse and everybody sees you and then that person will go into hiding cut you off decide that you were out to destroy them and instead of recognizing that you may have been manifesting a hores rear end a a mule religion like brother brandom talked about you see I I love amens I need amens but I'm more interested in in in somebody that'll hear it and work on it than somebody that'll just heaw a mule can only heaw but a thoroughbred horse can get to the Finish Line how many of you plan to get to the Finish Line you're not going to be a hot house plant that has to be babied all the time woo I knew the I knew I know how this goes over it flies like a lead balloon but it's the truth it's the truth every time we wear our feelings on Our Sleeve someone pokes it then it just fluffs up the mind and the will and the emotions and and and it convinces us that that we were right and we carry because of that an orphan spirit you're no longer an orphan you are an offspring of God I'm counting on some of you who struggle with who you are to say Amen we are offspring of God we are dwelling with Christ as corporate messiah in the earth and we're feeding that part of us on the revealed word of the hour and when the spirit of man that regenerated spirit it's now not man's life but the life of God when it begins to swell it starts talking not only to your soul your mind will and your emotion it starts commanding the flesh oh that is the control tower that's where control ised supposed to come from the regenerated Spirit man then it tells your mind you behave it tells your will submit to God it tells your emotions calm down stop looking for somebody to agree with you and repent kill that thing you've got another seed living in you kill it dig it up by the root if jealousy is there dig it up nobody can be you but you and you're a fine you you're a valuable you you're an offspring of God yet there is not another one just like you you don't have to be like somebody else you don't have to worship like somebody else or preach like somebody else or play music like somebody else don't settle for being a copy of someone else that's an imitation the original God doesn't make junk you carry the Sperma of God in you act like it live like it talk like it we are dwelling with him as corporate Messiah it's powerful it's glorious it's not all easy that's right but it gives us what we need to overcome in the message Oneness I'm going to need some more honey sorry bring me another Leng too he said and if you'll notice how that Eve was United with Adam she became part of him God did you notice in Genesis 1: 127 he created man singular male and female thank you plural he created man male and female created he them plural now the man was both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminis and masculine do you understand that Adam was created with every attribute of God in him by the spirit life and therefore he had both the attributes of masculinity and the attributes of femininity obviously some people haven't had that separated and so they have gender confusion they're not identifying who they are by the plumbing they're identifying who they are by feelings well feelings can't be trusted so God God knows what he's doing he gives the right Plumbing for the right part part of who you are masculine or feminine Adam had both the Bible said male and female he created he them but there was only one so far then God uh then the body part listen this is important because he says it here in a way that should be noted the body part of the woman was a byproduct now what we often hear people quoting is a woman is a byproduct that's not what he said not here here he said the body part now what part of a tripart man or woman is that the body part what's what is that is that Soul or spirit Spirit or flesh so the flesh part of who Eve was was a byproduct because it came from the man after the creation had been finished God made Adam both and then he reached into Adam just like Christ was both he hung there on the cross bridegroom and bride bride was separated from him through a narrow way bride comes back into Christ through a narrow way that's right we're no longer separated from him we're now in him and how did we get there it's a narrow way it's a spirit walk not a flesh walk not a soul walk not mind will and emotion it's a spirit walk amen so so then God reaches in and he takes out the the Genesis says a rib and yet man has the same amount of ribs that a woman has but evidently in the beginning Adam had another one well I just don't know oh don't let that throw you God had to get her done he reached inside of Adam he took that rib he fashioned a woman and therefore the the body the flesh body was a byproduct it came from the man but I want you to know the life that was in her wasn't a byproduct the life that was in her was a portion of original life Spirit life so her body testifies of the fact that she was the weaker and it's supposed to I'm going to preach a little bit here it's supposed to she's not supposed to want to look like Mrs Atlas she's not supposed to want to work out and have I'm not saying she's not supposed to work out that's all right you you EX decd to burn fat but you don't work out ladies to have shoulders like a man you don't work out to have biceps like a man you work out to burn fat and to be healthy and to stay fit if you ever let that Spirit get on you that you think you've got to look like a man you see those female bodybuilders are a little bit disgusting your body as a woman testifies that you were created to be a weaker vessel but remember that's your body that's your flesh but there is a part of you that is not byproduct and there is a part of you oh this is going to O somebody's going to cringe there's a part of you that is indeed not weaker [Music] not weaker that Spirit life in you is not to be weaker because you're a woman that's not a byproduct that's original life hello and so you can have as much of the Holy Ghost as anybody can and you should and you should go for more so you can live with him that's right I thought I'd get a little more help you should get more of the Holy Ghost sisters so you can live with him so weaker body but you let the life of Jesus Christ breathe on that seed of God and let it come forth in gene form like him that's not weaker that's not a byproduct it's messiah's life it's messiah's anointing are you still with me that then God took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct read the next phrase but not the spirit boy that's power powerful you know brother gley was preaching last night and he was contrasting the things that he had heard all of his life around the message and what he now knew to be the truth and he took an example of a quotation that's always used to discourage someone from speaking in tongues where it is referred to several times as sound in like uh peas dry Peas on a cide or peas being dropped on a cide ratatatat Ratatat brother gy said I heard all my life that used to keep that gift down and then I decided to research that and I looked up every time he made that statement and every time he made that statement it was connected to something like a hypocrite somebody lying cheating and stealing but speaking in tongues and he said I said well I'm not that then he goes to the next one uh uh you know talking about someone running around with somebody else's wife and still talking in dun and he said but I'm not that and he goes all through the quotes that have been used in his life to keep that down and discovers that none of them were talking about True Believers and none of them were talking about a true experience so what has happened is we've taken some quotations and they have been used as scarecrows to keep people in a false identity and we don't identify with hypocrite and we don't identify with lying stealing and cheating and still talking in tongues we identify with a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and that Holy Ghost that Holy Ghost at some time or another will testify by by taking the tongue and using it as a testimony he heard the statement made you you should hear it he heard the statement made if your if you've never heard your pastor speaking in tongues he it's probably because he doesn't have the Holy Ghost and that Disturbed his spirit because it seems he he realized he' never hurt his dad and and he knew his dad he knew the life of his dad and he knew his dad had the Holy Ghost he comes home from that camp and he gets down beside the bed and he starts praying one night and he said his dad rarely ever did this but his dad slipped in knelt down beside him put his arm around him and begin to pray for him and the next thing you know the Holy Ghost began to pray through his dad and brother gy said the question was settled that night it was there he was there and this was an opportunity to testify so that that question could be answered come on let's not take something like woman is a byproduct and a and make her lesser spirit spiritually because the Bible teaches us spiritually there is neither male nor female with God spiritually but this flesh is different how many of you know it's different and God's particular about it and he wants you to dress it up differently he wants you to go out of here with a distinction in your life and to show the world around you that you belong to him and even your clothes and hair and every part of who you are testifying he goes on to say and I got to hurry the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished God took from the side of Adam a rib and made a woman let's go on but not the spirit the spirit was part of Adam remember where he got it it was God's original life for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and feminis he goes on now don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit this is Messiah Ed this is Messiah this is those who have been anointed by the anointing of the Messiah but in spirit we are Sons and [Music] Daughters the Bible clearly says we're Sons not some other Spirit hello but the spirit of the Living God let's go on we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person Joy in wedlock to the Eternal why do you keep beating this horse it is in Hope an anticipation that tomorrow morning when you wake up and realize that it's a Monday and everything you had today is is draining from you and you got to go face the world face the job face the pressure face the bills it's my hope that eventually you'll wake up on a Monday morning and you won't yield to the flesh or to the emotions of the soul but you'll yield to the spirit the part of who you are that's just like him and you'll raise up out of that bed and say there's nothing that's going to happen to me today that I'll not be able to get to the other side of it because Gra is he that is living in me than anything I will face today I am an offspring of almighty God same person same God see how God planned it that we should be not different but him not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real say that word real Union and offspring of the almighty done by a holy union now the body comes from mother and father but the spirit comes from God God separating himself as Adam was separated on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself no longer in one man the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah but separating himself and now falling on a 12 who were fire torches who took the fire out and it began to spread God look God putting hisself together he couldn't put himself together in one man anymore that's why it disturbs me that this message has become such a Onan message it disturbs me that so many of my brethren have let it all be hung on one man when our Bible tells us that that he was one son Jesus coming to Perfection so that many seed so that many sons could follow him Jesus didn't think it was robbery to be equal with God because he knew he was God you may understand at some point it's not blasphemy for you to understand that there's a part of you that is Corporate Messiah living in the Earth for a purpose for a reason and our fellowship together will feed a part of who we are we've got to make sure that we are not neglecting the spirit part of Who We Are to only feed flesh and soul that Spirit man will wither I want you to know I'm going to say this again you will not be able to overcome in this hour with two sermons a week well why don't we have church three four five nights because it it doesn't become my responsibility to spoon feed you all week long it becomes your responsib ability to eat nobody has to tell you to eat breakfast your stomach starts calling out that Spirit man ought to be calling out in you and if it's not it's because the flesh is being pampered and the soul is being fluffed ego ego is robbing many people of their spiritual growth they're protecting an ego whoa wait just a moment wait who don't don't don't amen Amen brother tell the truth because we can't waste time now we're protecting ego reputation I got to be the best got to have the best got to be the most that's ego it's ambition you get that Spirit man fed on this word and saturated in the presence of the Divine glory of God that Divine and manifested presence of God and you'll start leading those other parts of who you are your your your regenerated Spirit the breath of God in you will start leading those that mind it'll start directing your thoughts to the word hello it'll start directing your emotions let me let me ask you a question since you are kind of acting like I'm I'm preaching to the wrong congregation let me ask you a question and see how honest you'll be has there been any time time in the last week from after the sermon Sunday April 28th to before the service today that your emotions were a wreck hold up your hand oh my my my Holy Ghost it appears that I have not been preaching ing to the wrong Church you you can't cast emotions out you can't cast somebody's soul out of them but what you can do is let those emotions be corraled and brought into captivity to the revealed word that says you are not to live your life as a wreck come on I've been there I'm an expert I know what anxiety is I know the physical effects it will have on your body I know it can you can have a burnout and and it lasts all day long and if you love it and nurse it it'll stick around the next day or you can get out of your head get into the word and end it how fast immediately immediately somebody said I don't have that much control over my soul life you do you're just not exercising it you are now a Son of God you are not living Soul life anymore you're living Spirit life so tell that mind will and emotions to behave bring that under control choose make a choice you choose whether you you you whine and and you cry oh it's not fair the reality is it may not be fair let me use this as an example this could help you let me see what time oh I have time sister Ruth took 50 young people from Calvary Pentecostal Church in in uh in Richmond Virginia to Jerusalem in 1973 to pray over the city there were others who joined them later from the na nations of the world and there are so many things about the Middle East that conexs you driving is one of them and yet I would rather drive there than here because there if you don't take it you'll never get it so if you get behind the wheel timid you'll get run over they'll just flatten you you know here you know how people do at crosswalks here wait till you get right up in your car and you know what they're saying pedestrians have the rideway pedestrians have the rideway pedestrians have the rideway you'll go to Walmart yeah I don't know if the Sanctified go to Walmart or not but you'll go to Walmart and they'll P they'll walk right out they'll walk right out they'll run see you coming and run till they get there and then you try that in Jerusalem and you'll be a greasy spot on the road they will run you over they don't know pedestrians have the right away I don't care if you've got a crosswalk I don't care if the lights flashing green I don't care if somebody's told you to go you better make sure nothing's coming or you'll get run over let me tell you something else about Jerusalem it doesn't have to be posted for it to be an illegal place to park most all amazing places to park are illegal and here if you you don't have a sign posted you assume you can park there and you've got an argument when you go to court not there they don't have to tell you by a sign no parking you find you a nice juicy place to park and you park there when you come back you're very likely to have a parking ticket I'd like to see you go down to the municipality and argue that they will look at you like you've got three heads they will even tell you do you know how expensive it is to defend this nation pay your parking fee so you just start reaching in so that is something to complain about cues lines this is the Middle East honey both Jew and Arab this is the Middle East they don't always know what lines are about you better not even turn around if you turn around to look behind you somebody will Dart in front of you they'll think and you say wait a minute and they'll say I thought you were getting out of line well I didn't move my feet I just moved my head come on I'm just giving you an example sometimes it rains red mud there the hene blows in and the air is filled with red dirt off the desert and it rains and and and as I told you on my way to the mayor's reception in a crisp white shirt I meet the mayor of Jerusalem shake his hand and apologize to him for my muddy white shirt now covered in red spots and he says that's Holy Dirt you're in Jerusalem better to be dirty in Jerusalem than be somewhere else in the world sister Ruth found out that young people have a tendency to complain about everything and so she found out that in the course of a day they spent a lot of time complaining to one another about Jerusalem no lines bad traffic no Whoppers and it Disturbed her and one day the Lord began to talk talked to them in a prayer meeting and he began to tell them if you're here on assignment don't speak anything but good about the land he also told them when you're on assignment in Jerusalem I'll take care of things at home don't let your mind be distracted by what's happening at home I if you're here at my uh request I will take care of things at home powerful he's done it for me it was just powerful and so she began to have the young people practice saying only good things about Jerusalem and do you know what that does it puts your faith in a different place it causes your emotions to calm down when someone cuts you off in traffic and you're about to uh you remember bless the land Bless the people speak good over this assignment hello that's an example example let let me tell you something when God plants you somewhere don't you come here and make fun of the way we talk you're the one that's got the accent don't you come here and talk about our greasy food don't eat it don't you talk about our red mud some people eat it you find something good to say about your assignment if God brought you here practice that it's powerful I'm telling you it's a spiritual principle some of you are offended and you're not going to practice it because you don't see how there's any spiritual uality to it I'm telling you a grateful heart a thankful heart a thankful attitude causes other emotions to be honed to be ped Lord I Thank [Music] You Lord I Thank you that this is an ethical uh excuse me an ethnical diverse place to live I thank you that everybody's not pale white I thank you that you've got shades of all colors and then if I reach out into my community I can touch many nations that's one way of looking at it isn't it it's a lot less Prejudice than how most of us look at things hello hello you start speaking good you start speaking good about your own family members oh my let me have some water nobody wants to do that get you an accountability partner to count all the times you use the word annoying in 24 hours that's so annoying that's so annoying that's so annoying he's so annoying she's so annoying you're easily annoyed aren't you you let that Spirit Man start feasting on this revealed word and you'll start seeing somebody's need it'll happen it has to happen it has to happen you'll start seeing somebody's burden somebody's need somebody's hurt yes sir you start praying you'll start making yourself controlling your emotions your reactions will will be different when you start taking Authority when you start setting things in order in your own life is everybody with me on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the Pillar of Fire separating himself setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together then that group of people together what does it do it brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together oh that's who I am that's who you are the unified body of the Lord Jesus is coming together isn't that beautiful corporate Messiah is gathering he's coming back together God putting hisself together by drawing Those portions of who he is back together oh my in the message God commissioning Moses and when a man becomes Born Again of the spirit of God he becomes an offspring a Son of God and then he has the same type of mind that God has put you on the mind of Christ we now have the Apostle said the mind of Christ oh when our mind becomes born again right we start thinking differently when a man becomes born again in the spirit of God he becomes an offspring or a son of God and then he has the same type of mind that God does the mind that was in Christ is where now where is it now in us do you really believe that do you think Christ would be so easily annoyed I'm assuming that's a no help us and then he has the same type of Mind God does the mind that was in Christ is in us and we believe for the Unseen for the miraculous and just anything see then we have the Holy Spirit who comes to us and speaks to us concerning these things and that's the whole purpose of these meetings dear Christian friend it's for no other purpose before God but that your faith in God might be stimulated to a place to believe him for the Salvation of your soul and for the healing of your body somebody say Amen I'll take just a few more minutes maybe 10 John 1:1 he came to his own and his own received him not but as many come on help me as received him I like that to them gave him power even to them are you one of them if you're one of them raise up your hand and say I'm one of them I'm one of them this been given power to become a Son of God even to them that believe on his name how many of you believe on his name well have you been baptized in it if you hadn't you're not believing on it go down to the water and take his name wear his name believe on his name that word power and he gave power is exusia it doesn't just mean it's not dunamus here Dynamite it actually means authority to as many as received him to them gave he authority to become the sons of God how many of you know what power may not be able to accomplish Authority will get it done can I give you the example one more time it's like Barney five brother brandom didn't call him Barney five but he talked about out it'd be like a little Deputy sir all skinny little non-assuming fellow stop out step out in front of a a moving vehicle and hold up his hand right he said why he doesn't have enough power to stop that car you see Barney F he can't even get to his bullet that's how you and I are sometime we've so entertained and fed ourselves with all the world stuff that we know more about the headlines than we do the word so we're standing in the road and a and and a speeding enemy it's about to try to take us out and we're fumbling for our bullet well it is written well what is written you finally find the bullet then you can say what's written brother brandom said that little old Deputy we're going to call him Barney 5 because that's who I think of every time I hear the sermons Barney f is a little old soaking wet looking thing who don't even weigh 100 pounds when he's gets right out of the shower and he is not particularly pretty and he's kind of a kind of a a a fumbling sort of personality and he shoots if he does shoot it's his own shoe and he steps out in front of a moving vehicle there's nothing about him that would cause anybody who wanted to get away You're a bank robber and you want to get away you see that funny looking little fella standing out there with a big nose and big ears and you just hope he moves because you're going through you're escaping you're getting out of there but but listen it's not his size it's not his power when he flashes that badge that's his authority and you better not pay any attention to how weak he looks or how much you think you you can get something over on him you better honor that badge because that badge says I am authorized he is authorized to stop you in your tracks you with me so you may not always exercise and and you may not always possess the power you that only pray on Sundays I know you don't have the power to defeat the enemy I'm sure of that but I'll tell you what you do have you've got a relationship your fellowship may be a little lacking but your election is in place so your relationship is in place and that gives you power to as many as received him have you received him how many of you received him to as many as have received him to them he gave exusia authority jurisdiction the ability or strength with which one is endued I like this the power of authority do you believe you have authority in Jesus Christ yes do you believe that you are coming to a place to recognize that your name on the check and then the word Sons here is techon which is not speaking about a fully mature hio son it's talking about about a child to as many as received him to them gave he Authority exusia power to be The Offspring the toddler the children of God Offspring children metaphorically the name transferred to that intimate and reciprocal relationship formed between men by the bonds of love to as many as received him to them gave he Power Authority to be to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name why because God's spirit his anointing his life is living inside of you can you say Amen believing God listen at this one you got to hear this you've got to throw aside your senses wow wow whoever told you that listen you've got to throw aside your senses and your sensibilities too God never give you those senses to trust him with God give you his Spirit to trust him yes your sense is only to contact see taste feel smell and hear but to you yourself is that spirit that lives in you now watch this and when are you listening and when that's been regenerated and the old man died and the new man born again that is a part of God then you become a Son of God an offspring of the Creator a chip off the old block you could say then you can believe what the impossible things are you facing something right now that looks impossible if you got a situation in your life right now that you cannot see the other side you see the inside of who you are is eternal the outside part of who you are is in time we often think like time creatures when we need to realize that we're Eternal you have to be you have eternal life in you when we think like time creatures we see see deadlines we see lifespans we see due dates but it's due in a few days that's time that's in time if you look at your situation from the dimension of time you may feel hopeless but if you will allow ow your mind to drift toward the Eternal you will recognize that God can move on your behalf so quick so suddenly you you know how quick a life can change one phone call can change your life forever you ever had that call change your Li forever never be the same you can't even remember a time that this was not your reality someone's gone something ended a friendship finished a loved one leaving and everything is different I want you to know God can move out of Eternity into your situation so suddenly so quickly that it can transform your life just like that dreaded phone call so in such a manner that nothing would ever be the same again he can so move for you I want somebody to find your faith right now he could so move for you that your life would never be the same again it may look impossible but because you're an offspring of the Creator you can believe the impossible things because you are made up here's what your makeup is it's not introvert extrovert it's not blue red yellow green your makeup is of the miracle working God hallelujah who's not bound by time you're a part of him say it you're a part of him so he can turn the impossible into a possibility so quick it'll shock you two more and we'll close believing God oh we just read that didn't we did we yeah go tell my disciples I have man everywhere across this country sometimes criticizing me about Divine Healing why my brother how how could I keep from believing in Divine Healing when it's the very nature of the Holy Spirit did you hear that the very nature of the holy spirit is to heal you how many of you need healing today the very nature of the holy spirit is to heal you it's his nature look at your neighbor I got to keep you awake look at your neighbor and say it's his nature it's the very nature of the Holy Spirit to heal you every man that's born of the spirit of God will have to believe come on we'll have to believe in the Supernatural why because he's a part of God he's an offspring of God you can't be an offspring of God and not believe in the Supernatural because that's a realm that God moves in I say you look like your daddy you got a nose like tell tell me I got a nose like Dad got a mouth like Dad well he's my father I got a right to look like like him Hallelujah then if God is my father I've got a right to believe in the Supernatural because I'm born of theal why are you reading on it because it quickens my faith that makes a oh oh oh oh oh I'm just a human you're going to have to humor me I'm just a human being I have feelings I have thoughts I have problems I have bills I'm just a human I'm just a man those song One Day at a Time I'm just a woman I'm just a man I'm so needy I'm so broken I'm so messed up oh brother sister that's not who you are you are a supernatural being why because the supernatural God has chosen to live in you that makes you Supernatural you can't have a supernatural God by the Holy Ghost living in you and and and always just be a human some people just want to be mortal they just want to be human so they have an excuse for all their shortcomings well I'm just I'm I'm mad now I'm I'm not I'm going to take my dish home I ain't even going to eat lunch with you I'll find something I know where they sell it inward outwardly I'm a man of clay you're a man of clay outwardly we understand that but [Music] inwardly outwardly flawed outwardly clay outwardly extremely finite outwardly very natural sometimes carnal outwardly but inwardly when you are born of the spirit of God you become a supernatural being in there and that supernatural being hungers and thirst for its Heavenly Home Yonder that's right amen notice it and finally the musicians are coming the world is falling apart it is it is but I'm assuming that you didn't come here today for me to tell you all the ways that the world is falling apart because you already know them you've seen it on the fox you've read it on the internet I doubt there's anybody in here that takes a newspaper but if you did you've read it in the newspaper the world is falling apart she's forgotten God our college campuses are educating fools there's just some things you can't teach in a lesson they're getting more of their opinion from Tick Tock than they are their professors and unfortunately their professors are highly influenced by Tick Tock and so you've got somebody that that's like a shim leading the March last week calling for the death of Zionist the university expelled it but one of our representatives from the squad was going to be speaking on the campus Because where there's that kind of a controversy she likes to bring her ignorance and so they leted him back on he's been expelled he's been to stay off the property and they let him come back and and attend her speech and have a photo op with her and he becomes even more famous while calling for the death of all Zionist we're talking about someone who can't even Define the word in ivy league universities I saw where Dartmouth had a big one even Southern universities calling for the death of Zionist calling Israel an oppressor and guilty of genocide while Rockets continue to fly every day and while we've been sitting in church today there was a whole barrage of things taking place and the IDF is going into Rafa the last stronghold our nation has asked them not to do it they're going in anyway to take the last stronghold of Hamas this world is falling apart but I want to tell you the real good news the church is ready ready for what ready for the greater ready for the greater I heard RJ pray we're on the cusp we're on The Cutting Edge of the greater yes the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come what preachers are calling a Revival of emotion here's what brother brandom's calling there will be a big outpouring of the spirit does that sound like Revival is over to you there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to do what to grab that church that bride church and take her into the sky exactly because the church the word the Bride In Christ his ministry is where yeah that's why you've got to have messiah's anointing it's in his bride which is his body the celestial body or I mean to say the supernatural body of his is here on the spiritual body on Earth he's talking about you his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding so they become one he takes them just like a little minority in the last days thanks be to God so you may not feel Supernatural what is feelings got to do with it have you tried to exercise that Supernatural part of who you are if you don't ever try to use it you'll soon doubt it's there start using it talk to your symptoms anybody ever talk to your symptoms speak to them you have authority you have authority over your own body the word of God in your mouth is creative yes but the reality is when we feel something when we hear something when we think we know something about this body we're quick to find the remedy or a pill that I'm not against medicine everybody needs a little poison to keep them going I think I just choose mine as fried chicken and not a prescription but anyway um we we sometimes just accept it and never deal with it you don't have to do that why don't you work on that one oh Lord instead of saying hey I got a new pain does anybody have new ones still coming on do you want that one to get to where the others have gotten to stop it talk to it now pull out your badge I I feel I feel powerless against you but I need you to know that I have the authority you have trespassed you don't belong here the blood of Jesus resides here anxiety you can't live here the blood of Jesus lives here come on use the authority that God has given you as corporate Messiah to deal with some of these things do it consistently do it daily don't do it once a week do it daily and see if God won't move on your behalf we've been hearing as I said earlier I'm done we've been hearing testimonies of people overcoming huge obstacles without a personal prophecy without a prayer line they just heard the word they believed the word and the next thing you know they acted on the word if you believe it you'll act on it right true faith will act on it you hear that line in Kate's song this morning you've got the faith you act on that faith and see what God will do it's not about feeling like it it's about exercising who you are let's stand there's so much Authority in this room blows my mind that the enemy would even try to show up here with how much Authority is represented in this room helloo anybody know that anybody know know what's in you does anybody know the badge that's in your pocket it baffles my mind that the enemy would even show up among us but he does and he will continue to until enough of us start taking that Authority and exercising it in the name of Jesus I have messiah's anointing in me and therefore I'm a part of a corporate Messiah and I'm speak speaking to you with all authority get your hands off of my family get your hands off of my [Music] children get your hands off of my house get your hands off of my [Music] body I care I'm carrying the anointing of the Messiah nothing can stand before him you believe that I didn't hear any amens nothing can stand before him he not only has all authority he also has all power hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how many of you have an impossible situation you're facing right now put your hand up looks impossible we know it's not but it looks impossible how many of you are facing a situ ation that looks impossible well you're you're serving a God of all possibility I'd like to see you take some faith today and and bring a testimony back in here I believe it I believe it I believe you will I believe you will I believe somebody will wake up Fed Up you see God is so jealous in this hour for the glory he wants the glory he wants the honor for what he does and he doesn't want to share that with you and I he wants you to take him at his word and get your need met and then come tell somebody look what God has done in my life none of the glory shared with the preacher none of the glory shared with your prayer partner all the glory belonging to him look what he did Look What the Lord did look how he moved on my behalf I'm believing him because a supernatural being lives inside of me
