========================================

Description:
This sermon addresses how pride partners with offense in believers' lives, exploring God's unchanging abhorrence of pride through Proverbs 6:16-19. Pastor Shelley examines the Hebrew concept of "high eyes" and connects God's hatred of abominations across both testaments. He challenges cultural accommodation driven by pride, particularly regarding gender distinctions, while emphasizing self-examination rather than judgment of others. The message calls believers to maintain biblical standards despite shifting cultural norms.

you're in the house of God and we we miss those who are streaming but we uh appreciate their mindfulness we appreciate the fact that most of them are coming out and on the up swing and they're being mindful uh of some of the rest of us when you're a close uh Community like this one uh and people are together sometimes every day of the week um then it's easy to spread things around and you can't get mad you can stay home wear a mask and live in a bubble and do all those kind of things if you like but but you'll get bored you can't get mad at folks and we ask people to use as much wisdom as possible but we don't ever want to lose sight of the fact that we serve a healing Jesus I know that marbeth is going to absolutely have a fit but it will not be the first fit that she has ever had since meeting me so many years ago but uh she did an incredible thing yesterday in a skirt and uh she said her first and maybe last but she ran a marathon yesterday and not only did she finish the marathon but she came in was it second or third in your division second place in her in her age division her first and came in second place in her age Division and did it looking like a Godly Saint skirt let's let's congratulate her [Applause] there was there was sickness in her house and and uh she maybe felt a time or two like you know didn't feel all that great but she pressed through and I'm I'm not U it's not one of my goals you know I decided that climbing Everest and running a marathon or about the same thing and uh I'm going to live on uh the Bible said Lo I'm with you and but anyway uh she is uh an inspiration I appreciate that now I did all that buttering up because I need a favor are you able to hobble to the piano Kade you know I love you and I love your gift but I don't think you've ever played this song for me so uh I'm going to ask her to come and I I wasn't going to sing we've had plenty of singing but uh I just feel like I'm supposed to and perhaps it's for for you that are still fighting or maybe someone in home still trying to press through their uh their infirmity their sickness but I'm so thankful for the way that God's helped us amen he's good to us I want to sing healing Jesus I'm probably going to need the words didn't used to but probably do now and I know you hadn't played it in a long time either so what a healing Jesus I found in you what a healing Jesus you restore refresh and renew you're my healing Jesus for for such a time as this arise On Healing Wings thou son of rightousness little more in the monitor son when walking by the Sea

quties let's stand and get ready for the word oh surely he bore our [Music] sorrow and my by his stripes we are healed last time sing that old song he was wounded for our transgressions every one of them he was bruised for our [Music] iniquities my God he was woo and surely surely he bore our sorrow and by and by his [Music] stripes I believe it I believe it put your faith there I believe it praise God let's thank the Lord for these musicians bless [Applause] them turn in your Bible this morning to uh The Book of Proverbs if you need to slip out before we're finish this morning we certainly understand we're going to give God the time that he needs this morning leaning on him depending on him and needing him amen sister Audrey sent a message also in tremendous pain today and needs a healing touch from the Lord may God just reach down to her and she's sometimes unable to get up and walk around she has been in a real battle but we know that her hope and trust is in the Lord and I didn't mention brother Shaw and sister Ronda they've also been fighting for their health but we just believe that very quickly God will restore them amen I didn't have time to I'm so sorry I just got a little distracted this morning but uh there are some birthdays this week and I may miss one but the ones I have I'll call them out real quick sister Cindy has a birthday on Friday do you still celebrate birthday sister Cindy good good uh let's say happy birthday to Sister [Applause] Cindy I know what Emily wants for her birthday it's the same day she wants her family well so let's pray that God will give her that and we send our love and uh happy birthday greetings to sister Emily also on Friday Friday Also begins purum and uh the reality of purum is still alive today there's still a mighty force that would like to take out God's people but they can't God has an Covenant he has an eternal Covenant with his people he's faithful to that Covenant and we pray for Israel not just when we uh when we remember something coming up like a purum but we pray every day the scripture tells us there's a blessing in praying for the Peace of Jerusalem and for the Jewish people people wherever they are and it's time for them to go home it's time for them to go home and take the promise and we're so thankful For What the Lord Has Done and the restoration that he has brought we're thankful every year around purum time we remember that God had a had a little woman at the right place at the right time the scripture said for such a time as this and uh he's got an answer for every hmon he knows how he knows how to deal with with every hmon you believe that God's got a morai he's got a faithful servant sitting by the gate waiting on God to keep his promise and he will so if you happen to be like us and porum is a time of of remembering and sometimes we do the groggers and sometimes we well almost all the time we eat hamash because there's enough jewishness in us that we understand the principle of the Jew they tried to kill us God wouldn't let them he gave us the victory let's eat that's Judaism they'll tell you right away that's that's been their their existence but one of these days it's not going to be quite like that amen um and then on Saturday the 15th the next day is David's birthday he's out one of the musicians but uh we wish him a very happy birthday as well did I miss someone here that you just call it out and tell on me all right let's turn to Proverbs um I I uh we we're in a in a study it's a little bit awkward sometime when we're in a study because there's that great temptation to want to go back and and rehearse and Rewind and go over what we've already gone over but there's really no time for that so if you are not uh a part of the series thus far it's available on the app and um we're thankful that God is giving victory over the spirit of offense amen he is yes his people have carried it too long and we're ready to be completely delivered set free healed and whole great peace have they which love the law of God and nothing shall by any means offend them we want to have an unoffendable heart I want to have an unoffendable heart in this battle amen I've got to win this thing and we have been identifying that there are spirits that like to partner with offense the first being anger we've dealt with anger and now we're in the third session of dealing with pride and when you ask Christian people about Pride nobody has any nobody you know we're we're Believers uh but then when you start looking at what Pride does and how it behaves you find out that there are remnants and and residues of Pride clinging even to the believer's life and and we've got to not put on a false humility but a real one a genuine one we cloak ourselves in humility God will use us and he'll give us what we need in our families and in our lives do you believe that okay brace yourself then Proverbs Chapter 6 beginning in verse 16 pray for me would you these six things doth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood an heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift in running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among Brethren I want us to look at one verse in the Amplified before you have your seat and that's verse 17 it says a proud look this the spirit that makes one overestimate himself and underestimate others that's that's the bottom line um when you see your life as the most important there is at least at least a remnant of the spirit of Pride that's still hanging on to your life and we don't want that now we know we have to take care of ourselves we take care of our families we we we clean up you know we want to look as good as we can and the these that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about putting others down and lifting ourselves up all the time we're we're also talking about losing patience with people who don't see the importance of us we we uh sometimes think that we're all that and we get aggravated with people who don't see us is all that all right now are you going to help me this morning the Amplified said a proud look the spirit that makes one overestimate himself and underestimate others a lying tongue and hands that shed innnocent blood Papa we need you ABA we come before you today today knowing that we are nothing without you but with you we are everything you said we were to be everything that we were created to be everything that you saw us being before the foundation of the world your thoughts about us did not start at our physical birth on planet Earth but our we were in your mind before the world's foundations were laid if I believe what the scripture said and I do we you knew us you knew our uprisings and our downfalls you already knew our strengths and Witnesses and if I believe what Paul said in the New Testament you already even knew my choice I had one to make but in your forn knowledge you knew my choice before I was ever born and because of that you have shielded Our Lives it's not that we haven't been through some stuff we have and there have been some suffering a little bit of pain along the way but the reality is all of these things pale in comparison to the brightness of your glory that is being revealed in the sons of God in these last days we are not what we desire to be but we give you the praise for not being what we once were we thank you for every deliverance we thank you for every time that you have dug out the root every time that you have let your word uncover what we were not even totally completely aware of and thank you for the grace that did not condemn us but the grace that pulled us higher and so today Lord once again we feel the upward call the upward pull back into who you have created us to be and we must confess that sometimes it's a painful Journey dealing with the reality uh of what we have allowed to remain in us but we trust the process because we trust you and we know that you are indeed working all things not some of the things not the things we like but all things you're using them for your glory to be established and revealed in us all things work together for the good of them who love the Lord them who are the called according to his purpose so we bless you in all things and we ask for your strength and help as we approach your word bashim Adonai Yeshua hamashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said you may be seated I want you to look with me at the Hebrew word that is used there in verse 17 uh the word is remote it is both an ancient Hebrew word and a modern Hebrew word uh modern Hebrew we would usually pronounce it raamat and uh in ancient Hebrew perhaps more with an o sound remote it if you are ever in Israel you will see so many signs that use the word Ramat and it's because many things in the land of Israel are named after high places high mountains or high hills and there it will be uh a prefix part of the name but also describing the spot like raat Rael the heights of Rachel or uh it goes on the word uh here is translated in English Pride it's a form of the Hebrew word room and it means high or lifted up it modifies the Hebrew word in this sentence inim which is eyes which is the feminine plural in Hebrew you didn't need to know that literally it means High eyes the Bible is saying to us six things God hates seven are an Abomination to him high eyes one of the things the first of the things things that he despises is someone having high eyes I I I want you to understand that it seems a bit of a paradox because the scripture tells us that we should look up look up our Redemption draws nigh the scripture tells us that we should cast our eyes up or look under the hills from whence cometh our help our help comes from the Lord Our God and our maker but that's not the kind of high eye Abraham the Bible said and Abraham lifted up his eyes and he beheld what a ram caught in the thicket and that was not just any Ram that was a ram that was testifying uh uh that there was coming a sacrifice provided of God on the same mountain of Moria the same place there's going to be another lamb this time in the form of a man and Abraham had to look cast his eyes upward to be able to see that it means by Revelation he looked and saw not just the ram caught in the thicket by his horn but he also saw the prophetic picture that was to come how many of you want to have those kinds of eyes I want those kinds of eyes the revealed eyes the ones that are able to see what natural eyes cannot behold we want to be those who are able to discern both the times seasons and cycles of the Lord and we want to be able to not only discern what God has said but from what that he has said is he saying is he emphasizing in this particular moment the whole book is God's written record of his word amen uh the word is not a book the word is a person remember John 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God drop down and you find a verse that says and the word became flesh so the word the logos is not a book but it's a man it can even in this hour be a woman because we are to be the word demonstrated today not in the exact same way that our Lord was he was absolutely transformed into a body that was uh prepared to to be the word to carry the word as both God and Son of God only one two offices that we're mentioning here but we know there was three it was not Papa father who overshadowed Mary the scripture is clear it was the Holy Ghost it was the ruach hakodesh our holy spirit that overshadowed Mary not a person in himself but a demonstration of the same God here oh Israel the Lord thy God is is one always has been always will be and I don't think that we even need to be so U dogmatic in limiting him to be only three because he's a doctor and he's a lawyer and he's a come on great physician and he's SAR Shalom Prince of Peace and Jehovah Rafa the Lord God who heals us so he has many attributes many offices many administrations many Ministries but only one spirit is that right and that Spirit became flesh and that flesh was Jesus Christ powerful and the blood that he shed was not Mary's blood wasn't Joseph's blood it was God's blood blood that God had prepared specifically for the purpose of redemption you see the purpose of that blood was to get God's life a life on us and not only on us but in US animal life wouldn't do it see the scripture said the life is in the blood so every lamb that died every Ram that died every turtle dove that died released life it released life but it was animal life and therefore it only had the ability to cover man's transgression but there came a blood don't ever forget the power don't ever forget the authority don't ever forget what the blood has done is doing and will do should it be our emphasis the life that's in that blood should be our emphasis because God creator was looking for a way to get that life on you and ultimately in you so that life came and dwelt among us we beheld his glory that was God being son Among Us isn't that right Emmanuel which means what god with us so the life was once with us but Jesus is leaving and he says something so powerfully important I'm leaving you I'm out of here but there's a part of me that's going to come back it's going to fall on you it's not only going to be in you and over you that life was over you in the Old Testament with you in the gospels but in the Epistles and the rest of the New Testament it's revealed that that life is now going to be in You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire how many of you are thankful for that experience it's so much more than an experience it's a transformation it's a translation it's taking the life of God and putting it inside of mortal men and women everything that happened up to that point is a type and Shadow we're no no longer living in types and shadows we're now living in the reality of every type and in the reality of every shadow because God's own life has come and lives inside of us anybody feel like helping me a little bit this morning we we are going somewhere but it's going to take us a minute to get there so we want to have the kind of eyes that can see not just this realm but another dimension another realm we understand that Realms are moving this way among us there was a time that we only understood that Dimensions lay this way but now we understand that parallel dimensions are running that way not so much this way on top of one another somebody said what in the world does that mean that means eternity is so much closer the spirit realm is so much closer than what we first thought we first thought you've got to be in the third heaven to even begin to see the spiritual things because we had everything stacked this way but we begin to understand by a message by Ministry by teaching we begin to understand that that spiritual realm is not a million miles away it's not above Earth's atmosphere but it's actually in this room right now it's reality that means our loved ones are not a million miles away from us this isn't wait a minute this isn't New Age this is Bible our loved ones are not a million miles away from us they're just behind a veil that you and I can't always see through but one of these days and God in his goodness and his Mercy there are times that he lets us press through the veil he let brother brandom go beyond the curtain of time many of you have had experiences in your Christian Life that allowed that other realm to become very real to you and I pray that as we get the rest of the mud and Gunk and junk dug out of our Lives I pray that it sets us in such an order that we can live as we were created to live dual dimensionally we were created to live as citizens of Two Worlds an eternal one and one that's locked in time we were created to be able to walk through the natural existence of our life while engaging that other realm one of these days we're going to see the reality of that in a greater fullness than what we have if you believe the message that I believe you believe that there's actually coming in that Resurrection time a moment we don't know how long a short quick period of time that our loved ones are going to step through the veil wouldn't that be Mar marvelous we catch a glimpse it produces the rest of the faith that we needed to say hey somebody said where's the Bible for that oh I'm so glad you asked it's in the gospels and many of the Saints which slept arose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem if there's ever going to be a catching away like our Lord was caught he was you can't can't deny that you can't deny that he left the uh Jerusalem from the mount this same Jesus I'm here to tell you the angel said this same Jesus that you see leaving in like manner he's coming back and if his next coming is in the same manner of his first coming then don't be surprised if it doesn't happen in a similar fashion those who were dead in Christ begin to make brief moments of appearance in that from that realm stepping into this realm we see them our faith is sort of perfected and finished and we say Lord this is it this is real and we wait for the change of our body it's coming it's coming it's not a way of Escape we're not trying to get out of anything I know that the modern church out there is always talking about raptures being a copout well I want you to know it's not at all it's simply Revelation 4 come up higher I'm going to show you something it's just not going to be like the church has defined it it's just not going to be Millions disappear it's just not going to be headlines reading all over the world it's not going to be quite like that come on but there's coming a change you're going to be like Enoch one of these days you're going to be walking around doing what you do you step right out of this Dimension never coming back to timeall Lord glory be to God moving on Enoch walked with God and he was not do you know what the scripture means what it says what the original says it says Enoch was emptied he had to empty himself before God could empty him he had to get rid of some stuff before God could occupy who he was and like the old songwriter said uh Enoch was just strolling with the Lord one day and the Lord said Come On Son we're we're closer to my my home to my place than we are to yours just come on home with me and he did and he did translated just like that Elijah translated Chariot a fire a chariot with horses of fire drew a chariot down Swing Low Sweet Chariot the prophet got in and he left somebody said that wasn't a physical thing well it must have been because Elisha caught his mantle not just a spiritual mantle the ministry mantle he caught a physical mantle amen wrapped it around his arms and smoked the river and saw the same power same results and if you search the scripture double Miracles so there is a greater portion for the bride of Christ in the last days amen so don't get hung up with theologians just stay with the word there's a greater portion it's in us it's full of option it's when your name on the check is the same as his name on the check the reality is we don't want our name we're just going to sign it m Jesus Christ because we're tired of our old identity our new identity is a part of him Hallelujah and and we say Amen we say Amen when the preacher says that but we forget it when the fever comes we forget it when the finances get tight we forget it when our fames are shaking with some confusion or chaos well I want you to know something that's when you need to remember who's who you are that's when you need to remember you've got somebody with you the old him no said I have somebody with me to share my heavy load I feel his presence near me every day and if I were you and I didn't feel and experience and engage with the presence of the Lord every day of your life I would find out immediately why I wouldn't wait till tomorrow I'd find out today why I can go two or three days without engaging and experiencing the presence of the Lord if that is your life you are living below your privileges as a Son of God in the last Church age you're living below your privileges I don't think it's going to take a lot to figure out why I think a little Common Sense goes a long way come on somebody said well I just don't know if there's any deep dark sin or some unconfessed iniquity or some generational thing or maybe I've got a great great great great great grandpa that I haven't repented for his lifestyle and so forth oh no it's much more simple than that if you're a part of the Holy Ghost filled elect of God in this hour and you're not experiencing the presence of the Lord I don't think the problem lays in five generations back I think the problem lays with us we're not giving him the time he deserves and it's not the quantity of time it's the quality of time it's making him our number one priority it's saying Lord I can live without a salad at lunch but I cannot live without your presence in my life I have to feel the reality of who you are this is a love affair this is not Church entity this is a love affair this is a relationship the king bridegroom is walking among and in his people in this hour and our prayer needs to be arise arise oh King in me take up your rightful place rule and Reign from the Throne of my inner being if you let him be that personal to you he will be if you keep putting him on the throne A Million Miles Away you'll never even be able to imagine the reality of who he is or the proximity that he desires to live to your house he's not a million miles away he's omnipresent he's God in this house he's just as holy among us as if you were standing Before the Throne somebody said I need to see an image look around we fail to see who he is in one another because we're looking for some kind of you know ethereal fog we're looking for the Blue Fog I've seen it I know it's real we're looking for the pillar of fire I've seen it I know it's it's real I grew up in Pentecost when the fire of God was so real on Highway on the highway out there that it came in Balls of Fire and rolled down the highway as I've told you many times before and not just one or two but every ey saw it even the Skeptics and the critics even those who said there's nothing to God manifesting himself in the foreign lights that's what they called them early' 70s foreign lights they didn't know what to call them but when God showed up and manifested even Skeptics and unbelievers on now like my grandmother's nephew who said Aunt mild I just don't believe in those far in l oh she said she looked at me she said do you hear that she said Glenn Ray doesn't believe standing on the old concrete steps of the church I'll show you a picture back there the spirit of God just manifested himself not one not two but three Big Balls of Fire rolling right down the highway he goes right down on his behind mouth drops open total shock holy presence of the Lord all around my excuse me my grandmother she said Glen Ray you believe him now that's how really was now we may not see that like we would love to I know just the mention of that causes many to say oh I'd love to see that well I I did and I'd love to see it again but you know what I'd really love to see I I'd really love to see a people who recognized that it's not by a sign it's the fact that he now lives in us and he'll be God as much as you'll let him be in you that means when the bad news comes it's not the nerve pill you run to first it's him it's not the home remedy you run to first it's not some Crystal you run to first hello you just run to him oh I need you like I've never needed you before and the same God that's right he stands up in us when we let him true he stands right up in us will The Real Jesus Christ please stand up and we're waiting on him to come he's here in us this Same Spirit The Same Spirit that resurrected Jesus from the dead it shall dwell in you and if it dwells in you it shall also Quicken and change your mortal body it shall also anoint your faith to believe that he's still a Healer it will anoint your faith to believe my God shall supply all of my needs according to his riches and Glory you believe it that's who he is so we want to lift our eyes up above circumstances above problems above present conditions we don't want to uh become uh only thermometers who report how bad life is how sad life is how bad the news it look folks we know all that that's why we're we're cutting off the news that's why we're turning it off it doesn't mean we're hiding I hear the news at least a little bit of it every day of my life I'm going to it's part of my obligation but I'm not going to live in it amen in fact there's just a real pleasurable feeling that comes all over me when I turn it off or when I because that means there's something better coming then we just start singing his Praises worshiping him he was in the car all the time just waiting on the atmosphere to be right so that he could manifest that he was there brother I told you that I come to church a whole lot lighter than I used to I used to listen to Fox News before I left the house while I'm getting dressed and in the car all the way over here on satellite no wonder I'd come in hanging my head how are you sleep not very well how do you feel not too good good glory but now I come over here singing I'm living up on this mountain and I won't come down don't stay too long in the valley going to move to Higher Ground or I sing an oh Henson song I'm living in the pages of his word Lord that's where I'm living I'm living in your word your word is living in me I'm abiding in the Vine I know where my anchor holds praise God it's not in church it's not in a Doctrine it's not in a denomination my anchor holds in the word that word is more than a printed page it's a living reality what we don't want to do is become prideful because God blesses us we spent two Services teaching on Lucifer how he got caught up in his own amazing ability his own Beauty God made him that way it wasn't him God made him incredibly beautiful more beautiful than any other creature in the heavenlies and built him in such an innate way that his body seemed to resonate with the sound of praise and he began to get a little you know a little elegant a little a little dramatic perhaps we don't know we weren't there but he got a little excited about who he was spent a little too much time in the mirror thought he could sing better than anybody else come on he started dancing but not not just for the king he started twirling but not just for the king he started moving around but not just to capture the attention of the king he realized that all of heaven was watching him and boy he milked it to the very end didn't he are you making some suppositions well yes part of it is but but but part of it is not because we understand even even the brother brandham told us that uh it was he was caught up in his own Beauty and that it was his pride he started looking at his ability leaving God out I will Ascend I will put my throne above I'll build my kingdom over here I don't need to be a part of that King I got a better Kingdom over here I'll do something different I'll go up so that even God has to look up up to see who I am and God said oh boy you may persuade a third of the Angels but you won't get them all in fact I'm getting ready to throw you right out of here you're not going to have access in and out of the throne without permission I know the charismatics they like to put him there every day well I want you to know it's not reality he cannot bombard in unless he's invited or allowed in the scripture tells us there was a time that he was uh had full access to that realm accusing the Brethren before God now his Dominion is in the earth his throne in the second heaven and he is the prince of the power of the air and now he's accusing still and he'll accuse you before God if God lets him in but right now he'd be he's more happy or feels more fulfilled if he's just accusing you to me and me to you he likes to accuse the brother to the brother the Brethren to the Brethren come on he wants you to be a skeptic of even those who walk the Faith with you that's how he brings offense that's how he come on that's how he brings hurt woundedness bitterness that's how he paralyzes us I'm sick of the devil I'm sick of letting him win we know too much about him we know too much about how he operates to continue to be taken in we've got to stop taking the bait I said we've got to stop taking the bait don't take too much pride in anything not even your looks because that can change overnight not in your what you have you can lose that ask job you can lose it all not because necessarily you're a sinner or God hates you but sometimes he's testing and proving you'd think after as many years as some of us who've been on the journey we'd be tested enough proven enough but the reality is we still got too much hello of junk I believe it was Smith Wigglesworth who called it yunk we've got too much yunk in us all we have to do is let him take out the trash he knows how give him access to every room of your life quit holding back some give him all of it let him have it all we said that a few weeks ago give him Broken Dreams give him wounded Hearts give him broken toys all of it if it goes all the way back to your childhood he's a Healer there's a bomb in Gilead did you read the devotional there's a bomb in Gilead there's life in the tree for you all you got to do is apply it use it appropriate it there's power in the blood use it appropriate it there's Authority in the blood use it appropriate it there's power and authority in the word use it appropriate it there's power and authority in prayer use it appropriate it come on there's power and authority in the name of Jesus well his mother didn't call him Jesus nobody answers to it I've seen him do it if you're more comfortable called him Yeshua call him that sir or maybe you're so sacred name you can't even say Yeshua yahu that's one of the words it doesn't matter it's lining up your heart with who he is the church is often crazy about semantics I wish that they would be that diligent to seek out the truth of the scripture if it doesn't have a word base you can't find it in the word somebody said is is God limited to his word well actually he can do anything that he wants to do but he's not going to do anything that contradicts his word he gave it to us so that we would have an absolute sir your pastor is not your absolute a prophet is not your absolute men are are very fallible but God's word it cannot fail it cannot lie God's word doesn't exaggerate men do God's word doesn't leave out details men do amen where's your confidence it's got to be in the word amen we ought to be careful not to cast our confidence away from men from our brothers and sisters from those that God uses to help us I'm not saying in any way that we shouldn't have confidence in one another we should and if we don't it's because we're nurturing offense but our confidence must not rely only in men our confidence must be in the word in the Lord Jesus Christ are are you sure you believe that in him is thus sayith the Lord are you sure you believe that yes sir cuz I'm going to show you something in a minute that's in the word and somebody's going to get quiet if it's in here will you believe it if it's in here will you ask the Lord to show you how it applies to your life if I can show you that the word says it would you at least pray and say Lord is there any application of that in my life will you do it I know you will I know you will so the kind of high eyes that the scriptures is talking about here in Pride and how Pride partners with offense it's those you know those hotty eyes well if you if you've got your you know your nose in the air it's arrogance it's haughtiness that the scripture is talking about have you ever known anybody that's hotti have you ever been hotti you huh how many of you have ever known anybody that's just arrogant have you ever been arrogant that's the question how many of you ever seen anybody that just seem to ooze Pride have you ever oozed Pride that's the real question have I that's the real question the reality is there's always an example out there we can't fix them we can't help them unless God gives us the voice to do it we've got to we got to help ourselves you can recognize in other people what you can't see in yourself we need the word wo we need God to talk to us from his word because he makes us personal I don't believe in Ultimate reconciliation make sure you understand that we don't preach universalism here make sure you understand that we don't believe that everybody's saved we believe it's a Bible Way repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you become a candidate to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what the word said that's what the scripture said if it were worked it works if it works then it works now we don't believe the devil's going to repent in the end time and be saved we don't believe that we don't believe that you can believe anything you want to believe and live any life you want to live and be saved that's not the god of the Bible you know that's a that's a friendly God it is it really is he he you know he's a tolerant of everything that's so nice I'm so glad but you know what that's a God that we made we don't need another handmade God we don't need another Idol we need the one we were singing about today there's no God like unto thee among the gods you're the only one true Living God your word is yay and amen not one jot or t is going to pass away if you said it that settles it are you with me amen now we find that that lifting up the remote the the high or lifted up eyes it literally means if you put that back up it literally means High eyes uh idiomatically it means a proud look and if we look at the word remote as a as a a participle or participle some people say I don't but some people do uh it describes the state of the eyes being elevated while looking down on others you don't have to go out in the world to find somebody to look down on if you've got Pride going on in your life you'll look down on somebody in this house this morning and if you do God have mercy on you the ground is level at the foot of the cross doesn't matter how many digits in your in your yearly salary the ground is level at the foot of the cross doesn't matter what your pedigree is the ground is level at the foot of the cross amen doesn't matter about your bloodline family line family reputation you may have horse thieves and slave owners and thieves and you you may have somebody in your family married five six seven eight times cheated on all their wives that doesn't make you anything the ground is level thank you at the foot of the cross there's no reason to look down on anybody everybody's commanded to repent amen amen there was a time that God winked at ignorance the scripture said there was a time that God said well if he don't know any better was it's going to be quiet I ain't even got to my point yet if he don't know any better would the Bible said there was a time that God winked at ignorance he said if you think those men were Sinners at the tower that the Tower of salom fell on if you think they were more than Sinners more Sinners than you all are he said I tell you not and except you repent you shall all likewise perish pretty serious business isn't it don't you think that because somebody died like that or was judged a certain way or something come along that that uh God was winking at that no more he said now he commandeth every man to repent so ignorance of the truth is not going to be an excuse that we can use before the Lord in fact we're just going to be inexcusable so we better get our excuses run through here let the word do what the word came to do and just say yes Lord yes I just say yes God said I don't want you to do that anymore you know what your answer needs to be you're going to have to help me Lord yes I don't want you running around that way no more what what's your answer got to be Lord you got to help me but my answer is yes oh and don't don't make God act you know God doesn't have Alzheimer's God doesn't have split personality God is Not schizophrenic sir doesn't have panic attacks either God is Not uh you know he doesn't have all these different uh entities going on like they to tell us you know God the father's mad and God the son is Savior and God the Holy Ghost is sweet and laughs all the time you you're you're putting him in a box still God's everything the word says He is there's nothing that he's ever been that he can't be right now he's the same yes you can say man if you believe it so we're not looking down on others look at look at Proverbs 16 uh 5 same same book but but 10 chapters later he said everyone that is proud in heart remember this is part of a bigger series that says above all else guard your heart which relates to the soul the mind the will and the emotions and that's where the problem is and brother bham told us the greatest battle ever fought going to be fought on the Battlegrounds of the mind if that little bride can win there she's won the rest it's all it's over with then this is where the enemy comes against us here he tries to disqualify us all the time you've got to read the promises of God and speak them over your life or the enemy will find you at a weak moment and convince you that you're not one of them you ought to grab your bible run all over your house singing I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them tell the Devil he's a liar in fact when he starts his talk we ought to shut him up at the beginning seems like we want to just listen to see what he's going to offer he doesn't have anything to offer he's a liar he's the father of all lies he's never going to tell you what you can be in Jesus Christ he's going to make you feel guilty for everything you've already done that you've already repented over and already been forgiven for he's the only one that won't don't forget he wrote it down he's going to remember he's going to remind you he wants you to keep paying he's almost a Roman Catholic he wants you to keep paying for what you've done over and over and over because the blood of Jesus is not enough I want you to know it's enough where are you his blood is enough everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished Old Testament I hear you Old Testament what the scripture say what did the Bible tell us all scripture is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction we need it all we have to keep it in its place we have to understand the Covenant that it falls under and how it applies to us today but we don't throw out the baby with the bath water oh no sir we want it all every promise in the book is mine if God can do it for you he can do it for me if God could do it for Jack Co and Ora Roberts and come on all the way down if God can do that he can do it for us if we pay a price there is a price to pay and that's emptying oursel Enoch had to get rid of who he was so that he could let God come and live in him that's that's actually what the what the Hebrew says he was not well we we always interpret that to mean he disappeared and he did but he was not before he was not and and you've got to be a wasn not you I have to be a wasnot I realize sometime I'm not there yet but I'm pushing through you still here good cuz I'm not nearly done again if you have to slip out with understand no no condemnation W you look at that in the Amplified quickly everyone proud and arrogant and heart is disgusting oh wow I knew that old Amplified Bible wasn't no good Oh you mean it doesn't clean things up with Victorian English if actually looks right to the root meaning of the word Abomination everyone proud and arrogant in heart is disgusting hateful and exceedingly offensive to the Lord that doesn't sound like the gospel of the modern Church does it be assured I pledge it they will not go unpunished I know there are many of us who probably would hope that that was only referring to the older Covenant but it actually refers to the character and nature of God may I just say this and it won't go over well with all the people who hear this wherever you might access this service but the reality is if God hated it if God ever hated it he still hates it now the question is did he ever hate it well we don't go back to the old church to figure that out we go back to the word you see there were those was under the old church who who would teach it you know God hated everything including everybody they went too far when they told me that God hated Dr Pepper I knew that wasn't possible if God ever hated it you see you can't have it both ways he's an unchanging God if he ever loved it he still loves it if you ever loved him he still loves him if he ever loved her he still loves her he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to eternal life but there's a way to come there's a door open there's a Calvary way there's a blood way you got to come a bloody path you've got to accept the life of his blood to be saved baptized in his his name and filled with the same life that he operated in in his Earthly Ministry it's not joining a church it's having a relationship with Jesus Christ a personal relationship that word Abomination is something that the church would like to redefine for us in this modern time I feel quite sure but the reality is it means the same in the New Testament that it does in the Old Testament the word in Hebrew is toar and it means something disgusting if God says that a proud look is disgusting in his eyes he means that we shouldn't wear that kind of a look if you carry that kind of an heir some people like to say Aura if you carry that God's not pleased with that you're not disgusting you're broken but that look on your face that attitude that you carry if you're operating in Pride and it doesn't matter whether it's family Pride educational Pride or even bride Pride because some people get a revelation of election and that makes them have bride pride and they think they're better than anybody else because they've heard the bridal message well that doesn't make you better it makes you more accountable if you have heard a Midnight Cry then that gives you the responsibility to be more accountable so so we ought not to strut around because of what we know or what we believe or who we follow or what come on so any any proud look is disgusting let me tell you something I have had pride in my life and God knows how to work it out he has before he can do it again in and that was disgusting I wasn't disgusting to God but that pride in my life that offense that I nurture and carry that bitterness jealousy cooler than the grave so unlike Christ but from time to time that stuff is operated in us may I say even as Believers anybody here even as Believers I know that we don't like to have that thought we we would like to think that as Believers we have you know reached the epitome of of perfection but no we're climbing we're climbing we're moving up that uh that stature of the perfect man we're making our way higher climbing Zion it's a rough road like the old uh black preacher used to sing I'm coming up the Rough Side of the Mountain but I'm doing my best to make it home how many of you have ever had to sing it I'm coming some of you heard a a eagle call a higher call come up higher Revelation 4 call and you said Lord I'm coming but you found out it wasn't as easy to get there as you thought he called me he invited me so I ought to be able to do this on my own no it's every inch by his help and Grace and sometimes it takes us longer to go up than what we thought but we're still on our way tell them remember remember the old spiritual said tell them when you saw me I was on my way amen if you get there before I do tell them over Yonder when you saw me the LI I was on my way wasn't there yet but I'm on the journey how many of you can say I'm not there yet but I'm on the journey and I don't hate the journey I don't hate the there's joy in the journey brother sister there's victory in the journey we get knocked down we get up Hallelujah that's not defeat that's Victory every time you fall that's one thing but every time you get up that's another thing you're an eagle you didn't become an eagle if you are an eagle you were born to be one elected the soar I don't care how many years you spent in an old denominational Barnard pecking around eating chicken worms you were never ordained to grow on chicken worms woo God had something better for you to eat and you had to find it and if you hadn't found it I hope you keep flying to you do I'm so thankful that I found mine I'm thankful for what it has done what it is doing and what it's going to do you see I've learned that the author of my faith is also the finisher of my faith and what he started in me the good work he started he's going to he's going to finish it all I have to keep doing say yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord I Surrender I've got my eyes on you amen remember if you need to go you can it says uh something disgusting morally an abhorrence you see the word abomination in the Old Testament often appears as something that God abor abhor can you say abhor do you know what it is it's the strongest degree of hate uh there are some things I don't like and there's some things I might even I I try not to say it but there are some things I might say well I hate I I don't I hate those I I like brussels sprouts I I can eat a whole head of cabbage but I I don't like I don't really like brussels sprouts I don't guess I hate them anymore because I can eat them I got a family that likes them and a daughter-in-law that really likes them and I found out if you smother them in something else else it's like broccoli you can eat it just cover it in cheese and bathe it in balsamic vinegar and bake it in the oven till it's no more and and then you you can but I wouldn't say I abhor them because I eat them just something I don't prefer abhor is a very strong word I just can't imagine using that in our everyday language you know I just have horror cold weather it sounds a little overdone you don't like it you might even say you hate it but I don't know that you would say you abhor it just buy another sweater and press on abhor is really a serious word and Abomination captures the reality of what it means to hate something so bad that you abhor it strongest degree of hate and everyone who operates in Pride and arrogancy God said I hate that not them I hate that look of arrogancy I hate that attitude of of arrogancy I hate that attitude of Pride I abore it it's an abominate one who SWS Discord among the Brethren God said I hate that if you don't want to be a part of the family get out but don't stir up and call CA Discord just what God Said I hate when people God said a lying tongue you don't have to lie you can put your finger over your mouth and take the silent treatment you you can say I plead the fifth you can just not answer some of you don't look at me like that because you're experts you know how to dance some of you like a little dancing goat you know how to move around when you don't want to tell something you know how to maneuver you think it's slick you think it's cute woo it's quiet you know how not to tell it you also know how to almost tell it but but cover your you know what I mean cover yourself so that if they ask you if you told it you can say you didn't we know how to operate come on but God sees us he sees us here something that's detestable I'm moving on I got to before I lose every amen this word Abomination appears 117 times in the Bible I I read every verse this week I'm amazed at some of the things that God says the most popular if you could say that of the of the Abominations are the seven that are mentioned here in this p portion of scripture but there are many other things that God said I just despise that for instance under the law he said if a if a man finds a an uncleanness in a wife and he puts her away because of that uncleanness gives her a bill of divorcement because of that uncleanness now please remember that's a very specific reason reason and it goes to dishonesty and deception about her Purity if you read the context and if a woman lies about that and a husband later finds out that was not the case under the Old Testament scripture said he can put her away Bible also says that she can take another husband she can then go and remarry Deuteronomy 2 41 or something like that I may be I know may not have it quite right but anyway and it says that if if he goes and or excuse me if she goes and takes another husband she can says she can but if she does she cannot come back to that first husband I mean she wasn't clean enough good enough and holy enough the first time you see it's it's a scriptural reason he had to do it under that lie deception of Purity it has to do with the tokens of virginity we've taught it it's it's actually a very holy thing in in in a bridal Paradigm it's a very holy thing but if a man decides he puts his wife away she could go on he said to take another spouse if I'm reading it right and I think I am pretty plain English but she could then not come back if that husband was gone that second husband whatever happened she couldn't come back if that first husband took her back under those circumstances of putting her away the Bible said it would be an Abomination for him to take her back am I right brother 241 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 you you you go all the way through that scripture now I don't know exactly why God said that but he said it and somebody said well sh I'm so glad that don't apply it don't somebody say well that's under the law you pay your tithe don't you that's under the law too you see there are many things that have carried over I know that we would like to exclude them all we would only take the Jerusalem mandate there in the book of Acts if we could and those are the only things that we would claim have any kind of uncleanness in them at all five or six things you know but there are certain things that do not tie specifically to the uh Temple service you there are certain things you can't you couldn't abide by because there's no temple in place and no sacrifice in place except the only one that matters and so there are certain things that you certainly could but there are things that are morally disgusting whether you agree or not God said there are certain things that are just morally disgusting to him and those things can't change if you let that change in your faith and in your religion then you're making God schizophrenic and you're saying that God has one personality one time and one another that he that he can hate something one minute and love something the next minute and hate something the next minute that's his character when God said that is AB horrible to me you have to look at it as part of his character you may change your preferences but God is Not Low by reason of his word he told us by reason of his word he can't change his mind if he ever thought that a proud look a lying tongue feet that are uh hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that are Swift and running to Mischief a false witness speaking lies and he that sth Discord among the Brethren if he ever thought that those things were morally disgusting doesn't matter what Covenant you're under he still does oh now you know where I'm going there's just something about Pride let's go back to that for a moment there's just something about arrogancy there's just something about haughtiness that God said I'm not having it in my people I don't love you less but I hate that disgusting Behavior that's what the word said you believe that don't you now somebody say yeah but you know that Bible said that if you uh wear wool and linen mixed together that's wrong and if you plant corn and beans in the same row that's wrong well he says there are a lot of things that are wrong under a a covenant that is connected to a sacrificial system amen that's right is it 600 11 or 613 Commandments and uh some of those Commandments are directly connected to Temple worship and we would have a very hard time doing those things but when God said I hate it when the scripture says he didn't say I it's an Abomination for beans and corn to be planted in the same roow did he he didn't say it's an Abomination for you to wear linen and cotton or wool or what he didn't say it's abomination no M didn't say that those things are connected to an identity that God wanted his people to have if you were uh among the Heathen and you were walking by a farm and you saw a farm that was set up like that a a crop a field that was set up like that God wanted it to be so that you would know that is a field that belongs to the followers of Yahweh that's God's people there whether they believe that God or not that's them folks sometimes they call them the God those who follow the god of no name or the the unknown God or they called him all kinds of different things but God wanted his people to present themselves in such a way that wherever they were and under what any circumstance uh whether it was in the market or in a private home or or on a a job or in a field he wanted his people to be distinct enough that's right that the whole world would know they're mine I love that I love being his segula I love being a peculiar treasure to Jesus Christ I love that when he said A peculiar people he wasn't talking about see how weird we can get I love the fact that he was referring back to the Old Testament uh concept of a king having many treasures and many wealthy uh uh expressions of wealth but among all all of the gold and the silver the king always had a segula he always had a particular place where his most prized treasure was kept and he would visit it he loved looking at it his heart didn't trust in it but it was exclusively his and no one else's and the New Testament captured the thought and said you are a peculiar people a holy nation come on separate from the rest of the world you're mine my Mark is on you you're going to walk right and talk right and do right and spit white because my Mark is on you there's another Mark the church is waiting on it to appear but the reality is it's been here for a long long time script natur the Bible said in the New Testament that the mystery of iniquity doth already work and the Mystery of iniquity and the and the and the son of predition are tied together in the New Testament isn't that right and the son of predition in the New Testament is a forerunner of the Antichrist which is a system that's already in place it's already in place and I don't want no part of it amen anybody here I just don't want any part of it if that seems Pride if that's arrogant if you think that's too tough I apologize to you for the way I'm making it sound I don't want any part of that system God called us out thank you Jesus he called us out I'm not going to spend all my life condemning that system but I'm going to walk separate from it I don't want it up here I don't want that over my thinking you see I don't want to receive a mark in my in my in my thought life my forehead and I don't want to join myself like a right hand of Fellowship I don't want to join myself to A system that God has said that's Antichrist it's not Christ and that word anti doesn't always mean as a prefix in the Greek it doesn't always mean against sometimes it means another there's another Christ that's why Jesus said in the last days are going to come and say Christ is here and Christ is there don't you follow them why would he say that because you're always going to know where he is how many of you are always going to know where Jesus is he's in his word he's in his people you don't have to go to Jerusalem to find him you don't have to go to Jeffersonville to find him you don't have to go to Tucson to find him you don't have to go to Mecca to find him we know right where Jesus is right now he's in me Hallelujah somebody said isn't that a little bit much to say it's not enough to say amen and once we get a revelation of that we'll live a different life and we'll operate in a victory that's higher we'll we will absolutely move in a Deliverance that is higher than we've ever known God may not take away from you what he didn't give you but he'll pull you up into a place of Deliverance where the things you once hated you will now love and the things you once loved you will now hate if there are things in your life that are not good for you and not right for you I pray and for me as well I pray that God will lift us up to a higher place and that if we're holding on and even loving something that God said I don't want you to have any part of that we'll begin to despise the very thing that we adore somebody said why would you pray such a prayer as that because the Bible said that's what God wants to do in us we are not normal regular creat ations he said that he told us when you've got my life in you the life that that that I'm living now the Apostle said that's not my life I laid that down I'm not trying to operate on my own understanding my own intellect my own mind we now have I thank God he said it can be a present tense even when I don't always operate in that I want to confess it over my life I now have the mind of Christ even when I don't feel like I'm seated in Heavenly places I want to be able to confess what the word said today we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus some of us have colds and and coughs and some of us are tired and and we fought physical battles and and and and we may not be 100% but the reality is the word said we now have the mind of Christ the word said we are now seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus some folks are waiting on what is already present reality if we're looking at it with the right glasses you need isav Lord give me more Isa are you with me got to hurry let's see what time it is I see some of you looking you can slip out if you need to and horen something detestable this word is used 117 times in ancient Israelite culture the concept of toall was deeply tied to the covenantal relationship between God and his people practices deemed were those that violated the Holiness and Purity required by the law Idols were considered Abomination this included idolatry sexual immorality unjust practices cheating more than once the scripture that's just boil it down says cheating ducking under moving around the law cheating more than once God said that's an Abomination unjust practices the term reflects the cultural and religious boundaries that set Israel apart from surrounding Nations emphasizing the call to Holiness and obedience to God's Commandments I don't see anything in there that says that God changes his mind about what he considers to be idolatry or that he changes his mind about what he considers to be sexually immoral including prideful Behavior a proud look lifted up eyes one who SS Discord among the Brethren now we've got to we've got in the time we have we have to move quickly look at Revelation 171 with me uh I I talked about this Tuesday night but I didn't read it I want to read it take me a moment to read it Revelation 1771 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns you're following along so far and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color purple and red and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication I want you know God hates what's in that cup that cup is full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication the scripture calls her a it doesn't take a whole lot of discernment to recognize that she actually is a religious system that religious system will make its Covenant with a political system in the end time Pap Rome joining with political Rome H becoming the the reality of mystery Babylon people don't want to talk about it uh people don't like to think about it you hear church people say I'm scared of the Book of Revelation you ought not to be scared of anything you you know fear is the opposite of Faith perfect love casteth out fear you experience this perfect love you don't have to be afraid of the book of the Revelation or any other book in the Bible the book of the Revelation is the only book in the Bible where God said don't add to it don't take away from it he didn't say don't understand it he said don't add to it don't take away from it if you do you're going to find that something has been taken out on your behalf if you want to be as though you never existed because if your name comes out of the book of life it means you've never it is as though you never existed Now understand that we see in the scripture there's a book of life and there is a Lamb's Book of Life there's one book you can have your name blotted out of there's another book that you can't have your name blotted out of do you understand your name can be removed from the book of life it's a judgment and it it is as though you never existed on the earth that's what the scripture teaches but once you have the Revelation and indeed it really is there your name in the Lamb's Book of Life God's going to have you he's going to have you if it's there he's going to have you one way or the other amen are you extreme calvinist I'm not I find my balance in the scripture there's reality in both sides of that camp he knew me and because he knew me he knew my choice he knew what I would accept and what I would reject and because of that because of his for knowledge of me the scripture said he predestinated me to be conformed to his image that's just the word now what about the scripture that says don't you think you chose me I chose you that's because God saw your choice in the beginning and chose you from the beginning so that you would your life would then be a life that would one day bring total reflection of who you chose what you chose because he said to them he for know forne to them he did also pred desate that they would be conformed so there's an order to that isn't there the glorification is at the end of that thing first Justified first justified by faith Justified never sin that's what the blood has done for us if we embrace it and hold on to it so here is a woman a horish woman sitting on a beast dressed in purple and scarlet color decked with gold precious stones and pearls why is that mentioned because like Lucifer this church system trusts in her beauty in her Treasures in her gold in her silver in her Cathedrals she trusts in the things that are temporal she puts on all this doodads and you know robes and gowns and sensors and oh my goodness so many kinds of things she puts on because she wants to be seen and known and her beauty to attract but the reality is her judgment has already been determined she holds in her hand a cup full of Abominations and the filthiness of her fornication let's read on and upon her forehead this woman could never forget what she represents because upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great and no sir that's not the United States of America hear me there's a lot of folks in the modern church that say that's the United States of America it is not this woman had mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots she's not only a in the scripture but she is the mother of other harlots of prostitute her daughters are just as loose just as pleasure seeking just just as Beauty oriented as she is loose adapting adopting doing whatever it needs to do to be tolerant great Babylon the great the mother of Harlot and Abominations she is the embodiment she is the personification of everything that God says I hate that I abhor it I find it disgusting am am I overdoing this interpretation I I need a few more minutes am I overdoing this do you think I'm saying something I shouldn't say doesn't it seem that that's exactly what is being say said she is the representation of everything that God calls disgusting I abhor it and she loves it so much she drinks it and Tattoos it right on her head it's right there on her head she's proud of who she is and what she does she so religious she's so religious all the Abominations of the Earth right there identified and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration that's pretty serious business there was something about her she was captivating she was enthralling she was attractive John is saying something this is a servant of God a prophet of God a messenger of God on an aisle of patmas boiled in oil and Wouldn't Die banished to the aisle of patmas given an opportunity that no other man was given to see the entire revelation of Jesus Christ played out in symbol form before his eyes what a man what a vessel thank God for his obedience I'm so thankful that there was no Facebook no Twitter no no Instagram to distract him it's just him in the cave just him on the island and God showed up and showed him things that you and I needed to know for 2025 but he's honest when he says there was something about her that made you want to uh see her there was some admiration there was some wonderings some mystery about this woman she was somehow attractive remember she represents a system a church order that is attractive if you don't think the blood's enough well that's all right we've got we've got another way for you to feel good about yourself you can pray the rosary you can come behind the confessional you can uh do the hell marry you can quote the Apostles Creed you can do all these things and still feel okay about yourself if you're not so sure that the blood of Jesus Christ is Enough there is no uh greater tolerance than the tolerance that this woman shows to anyone except those who stand against her if you stand against that system you become blood in her cup she just murders her own oh over 60 million over one period of church history 60 million she murdered her own some of them members of her own Society but they had a little difference of opinion men that said wait a minute the just shall live by faith chased hunted she would have killed Martin Luther if she could have she did Kill many we have the fox book of Martyrs we can read the story of how anybody that said I think baptism ought to be another way or like youus who stood before the council and said I believe something has been added to the holy RIT like like other men of Faith who stood up and said wait a minute I think we have falsely interpreted what this scripture says and and the answer has always been the same away with you some to the prison some to the dungeon some to their death stretched apart not medieval tyrants and Kings priests you tell me Bishops religious men turn the crank to pull them apart women's bellies cut open and unborn babies snatched from their wombs sulfur burned inside of a woman's body because she had some thought some understanding that was different than this system you must just be making all this up it's just craziness all you have to do is open up your mind and read a little bit of history and you'll find out it wasn't communism that did all of this it was religion it was this woman she was drinking the blood of the martyrs over 60 million at one time we don't know the total amount but some people say that it would be upwards of 200 million people and maybe more that this church system has murdered some of them for more serious offenses some of them for something as simple as saying I have had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ baptized by immersion in his name we can't afford for you to have a different opinion because then you would under undermine the structure of the holy church the only church they say when the Catholics when that movement when that system talks about uh ecumenicalism and bringing Faith together they don't mean you believe what you believe I believe what I believe will come together no no no no they mean you believe what I believe you may be Baptist now you may be Pentecostal now but if you want true salvation you've got to come this way be all right if it was a Bible way if it was a bloody way if it was a scriptural way you read about lent in the Bible anybody read about Ash Wednesday in the Bible anybody read about the blessing of the dogs and animals during Lent and going to the priest on Ash Wednesday and having a cross put on your forehead I never read that in the Bible did you you ever read about going in a little box and confessing your sins to a priest I never read that you ever read about having a little bracelet on with bunch of beads and you count through those beads and and and you do that enough you'll find favor and you repeat some slogan Hail Mary Mother of God full of grace and truth it's a lie from the beginning Mary's not the mother of God God has no mother just let me get this out of my system so I don't have to do it every week for here on now it it goes on and on and on they don't just believe that that little communion cracker in your mouth represents the body of Christ they believe that it's literally trans transformed into the flesh body so that when you swallow you're not swallowing flour and water you're swallowing the body of Christ and you're drinking not wine that represents his blood you're drinking his blood which is an Abomination life is in the blood you don't have to have it my my my what a phony representation of how to get the Life of Christ in you just get the Holy Ghost just do what Mary did just do what Mary to Mary you love so Mary you love Mary you pray to Mary you worship Mary then do what Mary did Mary was commanded to go up and get the Holy Ghost just like the rest of them she had to have the Holy Ghost too amen I need to move on there's so much about her that influences us even today Steeples and these crosses with round Moon shapes on them representing the Holy Eucharist and kneelers and last rights and signs of the Cross and all of none of it absolutely none of it in the Bible and yet it's the largest group of Christians in the world are there good people there there are good people everywhere but to ignore the evil of the system because there are good people there would be doing them a disservice I saw this woman drunk with the blood of the Saints I'm hurrying and with the blood of uh the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw I wonder with great admiration let's read on quickly I got to get it somewhere and the angel said unto me where didst thou Marvel I will tell the mystery I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and 10 horns the Beast that thou sawest was and is and is not sawest was and is not excuse me he was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is mysterious isn't it and here is the mind which ha wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sth this is most likely not speaking about Colorado the only other city other than one in Colorado that sits on Seven Hills is the city of Rome so the scripture identified so many years ago the very location of where this Beast would be and where this horish woman would make her home powerful you didn't even need a prophet to see that you needed a prophet for many other things but not particularly for that on which the woman sth uh then there are seven Kings I wish we had time five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when cometh he must continue a short space now we can talk about these things another time in another series I read them simply because of the word Abominations means in the Old Testament something God hates means in the New Testament something that God hates now this is not my subject but can I give you a quote that's speaking about abomination but it's not particularly um it's talking about Pride but it uh is in my notes and I didn't want to spend too much time developing the thought can I just kind of throw it out there sure you can Pastor you worked hard to pull this together no no 182 we have seen a star oh brother sister how nice it would be if each one of you if each one of us me brother man said me wonder why he said me wonder why he put himself in there because he was also falling a little bit victim to the very thing he condemned somebody said that's a hateful thing to say was it hateful for the Bible to record that John admired the woman that sat there on that Beast or was that just reality reality it wasn't that he wanted to worship her but he sure was intrigued it's it's not totally out of my grid that someone could become enamored temporarily interested in something that they shouldn't be interested in has it ever happened to you he said I I I I just if each one of us me if each one of us could lay aside all this your Christmas tinsil see quit all the swapping gifts one with another all of this what do you call it nonsense of the world and just that's why I stuck it in here when I was first star in this series take off our pride and lay it down now this is why message Believers are running back to this stuff Pride it's real simple it used to not matter that we were the only ones that didn't but it matters now it used to didn't matter that our women weren't painted up but it matters now so they don't use eyes Shadow they just put lots of colored cream on their faces I was just recently in a gathering where there were many Believers and I don't know that there were 30 women in that great big crowd of brothers and sisters who weren't painted long hair some of it twisted and dyed and tied and permed and squirmed and didn't look real didn't look natural but that wasn't they they were all pretty in line with that but but I marveled I I grieved it greatly affected me and affects me to this moment why in the world after all these years of knowing the truth would would we start going back and picking up those things I know this is on the internet I know people will hear this has not ever been a part of your uh Faith it's never been a part of who you are but for us it's been a part of of our identity for a long long time and we you know we uh say that we believe that this Prophet you know that that he was right on had the right interpretation of the word etc etc some people say he was an extension of the word of God I don't say that but some people do some people say infallible some people say uh every word out of his mouth thus sayith the Lord etc etc etc and those same people are the ones who now put the color on and fix up all the flaws and run for all the Christmas and and here he identified I didn't understand this years ago I now do why he would say such a thing like this but now I understand it and just take off our pride and lay it down and stop the thing underfoot say Lord Jesus guide me to that Perfect Light amen now if that was all we could just say Amen we don't do it anyway no need to even mention that but he said watch something Supernatural happen the holy spirit will come in a phenomenal way so I'd like to say to anyone who hears this uh who has once stood against these kinds of things which by the way are directly connected to this Mystery Woman it is it is it is undeniable that Christmas is an extension of that and her system and we used to stand against it but now we're doing it for the kitties and now even brother brandom gave candy and now even he had a tree and now thank y'all for my suit and now we hear all those things well here's what he said wouldn't it be wonderful each one of us could lay aside all this Christmas tensil you one of us us me and lay our pride down do I have a few more minutes thank you I'm almost done if I haven't squirmed you I'm fixing to squirm you Deuteronomy 22 and5 would you put that up we don't have to saying we don't have to worship we don't have to pray for you we can just go home if you're in a hurry but we do have to get this so there are many things in the Old Testament God said don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that don't do that do this do this do this do this some of them we don't even know how to interpret we don't even know how to how to to do them or not do them because in order to figure it out we would have to go to the oral tradition and man's interpretation and I'm not I'm not going to do that I'm not going to go to the to the talmud I'm not going to the oral tradition like some people do to try to figure it all out because that's not Vindicated it was opinion may be right may not be right so some things we wouldn't even know how to do if we thought we were supposed to do them and that's why you see all this weirdness everybody trying to figure it out for themselves but there's one thing we can know that God didn't say those things were Abomination if he said it was an Abomination is something he hates something detestable disgusting to him that can't change a woman the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so before it was the it was the doing that God said he hated proud look I hate it when people behave proudly so Discord that's a doing Swift to M doing do we have to go back and get them all doing doing doing God said I hate that now he says says those who do this are detestable disgusting an Abomination to me that's serious business folks you you can throw it out and call it oldfashioned if you want to but that's pretty serious business I I'm I'm just I'm not saying more than what this word is saying a woman shall not wear that which say that word with me pertaineth unto a man neither neither don't let the man off the hook neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God morally disgusting in his sight now I believe that from that scripture to take it through the scripture that's his character that's part of God's character if he said I love it that's part of his character if he says he hates it that's part of his character so God is saying I I despise when women here masculine I despise when a woman is wearing something possessing something doing something that pertains to a man wait a minute you said you said doing something well we have to to be fair because the key word here is not Abomination that's powerful enough isn't it the key word here is even more convicting the key word is protect pinth I want everyone to say the word pertaineth that's a key word now I don't generally refer to AI for my Bible study but I thought this would be an interesting search I'm going to ask artificial intelligence to tell me if pertaineth in Deuteronomy 22 and5 I gave it the Hebrew word which is KH if it was to be taken literal is it a literal word oh I happen to have its answer understanding pertaineth the word pertaineth in this verse comes from the Hebrew term Ki which corresponds to Strong's number 3627 in Hebrew Khali broadly means vessel Implement utensil or article it refers to a tangible object remember what the word is pertaineth it refers to a tangible object or item that belongs to or is associated with someone or something it has been translated stuff weapons vessels Jewels instruments garments dresses and even Furniture there the word pertaineth can be used concerning even Furniture in context of the Tabernacle or the temple because remember that was furniture that God designed to be used for excuse me specific purpose so the word pertaineth can mean a weapon the modern church when they interpret this verse when they explain to us that it doesn't apply to us today they choose one of those words that's translated in English weapons uh armor and they'll tell you that that verse refers to the shame of a woman wearing the armor of a soldier who is a man well that would work that way but not the other way then what would the man how could the man be wearing the armor of a woman that would only be one gender do you understand my point they forget to tell you that it doesn't just mean that word pertain it is the is the kicker here not the word Abomination the word pertaineth is the kicker here because that can mean associated with pertaineth it is an Abomination for a man to wear that which pertain it a woman to wear that which pertain it let let's read the verse one more time and move a woman shall not wear that which is associated unto a man that could be a lot of things pertaining neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God let's read on in the context of Deuteronomy 22 and5 k specifically denotes clothing or items typically worn by men how could you say that because it says garment that's also an important word but not nearly as important as pertaineth are you with me so I ask the question how literal is pertaineth in the Hebrew in this verse and in this verse pertaineth is quite literal it refers directly to physical objects namely garments or articles of clothing designed for or associated with a specific gender listen to me Church the command is clear and practical women now listen I'm not going to use AI for my go-to reference but I had had fun a couple times this was one of my times the one thing I know about it it can be wrong it's according to how you ask I ask considered this word Hebrew now in English how literal is the context this is not a theologian opinion this is absolutely factual from the very meaning of the word the command is clear and PR practical women are not to wear clothing that belongs to men and men are not to wear women's garments well this word belong doesn't mean possessed by again it means pertaineth to this reflects a concrete instruction about maintaining distinct gender appearances which was significant in ancient Israel Society for preserving social and religious order so from that verse of scripture we can conclude that crossdressing is an Abomination to God is that right now they say well in the Bible they didn't wear dresses and pants that's right not not really but sort of because men did often wear breaches underneath their robes sometimes uh associated with with a garment sort of like a girdle but having legs so sometimes the English translates it girdle but anybody that knows anything about oldfashioned women's girdles even had legs not maybe to the ground but but legs the the priest wore them athletes would wear them in fact it was part of the Garment that was used to gird up the loins to pull the robe up and to tuck in so a lot of the time under a man's robe there were garments that Associated that man as a man well you couldn't see it if it was under his robe that's right and that's why they use different styles different colors different sashes ropes and ornamentation women's being more ornate a man's being more simple and the only blurring of the lines was with royalty because the king wanted everybody to know how wealthy he was so he oftentimes borrowed designs from the women to make himself which according to scripture would be an Abomination pertaineth the word that I want you to carry home with you today is pertaineth doesn't have to be just slacks it doesn't just have to be genes the Bible said that God abhors this concept of women wearing garments that pertain to a man that could be dress slacks or trousers or shorts or it could be uh did I say blue jeans pants they call them now the women will tell you I get my pants in the women's section that's not the problem the problem is not what section you buy in because remember we have genderless bathrooms now so it doesn't matter it's not the department you buy it in it's what it pertains to what do you think what is it associated with which gender you see we now have a a president who said there's only two genders and the Bible said there should be distinction between the two in a lot of things including the things they wear amen so it's not just the dress slacks or the jeans dungared they used to call them or what my granny call britches and I like to say it that way britches it's more than that it's the pajamas oh let's see how quiet it gets if jeans pertain to a man so do pajamas pertain to a man oh my oh my sweatpants I don't think it's any of anybody's business what I wear at home it is if it pertains to a man I grieve when I see these little girls in britches some of you put put your girls in them I don't I don't agree with it I I'm embarrassed by it and offended there's no way in this world that you can say that doesn't pertain it pertains and if you're never going to take a picture of them then perhaps when they're older they'll forget but you are going to and they're going to see it and they're going to wonder and they're going to ask why it was okay and what what age should it change I see the age getting higher and somebody said well don't you want to teach a little girl to be modest yes and that has to start from the beginning and when they're toddler when they're just crawling around they don't understand holding their dress down you just have to teach them when they're old enough to understand but you don't have to dress them in something that pertains to a man you you don't have to say I don't even care I won't even be offended if you don't even say amen I won't be offended I just I'm my responsibility is preach what's the word saying now In fairness let me give you a quote where brother brandom said he didn't know what to say about it just so you'll understand and then we're going to go we're going to go we're going to rejoice and we're going to go we're not going to worry about it but we are going to say we heard the word pertaineth we're going to say that we understood now from scripture that it means can be associated with and it doesn't even have to be necessarily just a piece of clothing it can also be some other item that is associated with a man or some other item associated with a woman and then you just take that like a like a merse like a man's purse is all right for a man to have a bag to carry his things in but it shouldn't be shouldn't be made like a woman's purse hello I sure wish you to let us cut off the stream I don't I don't I don't really care questions and answers let me get this one in questions and answers and women 118 you dress like a woman and man you dress like a man don't try to be a and wear women's clothes and women don't you try to be masculine and wear man's clothes because God don't want you to do that the Bible condemns it there it is amen doesn't matter if it has flowers on it sheep clouds tulips uh uh what else can little elephants doesn't matter does the Garment pertain to a man if it does then we ought to be very careful how we allow it in our families because if God says that this cross dressing and women wearing things that pertain to men and vice Versa that something he hates because he wants there to be such a distinct line in the genders which is even more important today that we have been forced to try to figure out pronouns and what do they call it binary and what's the other term they use for genderless genderless you really think somebody's walking around without a [Music] gender why even an elephant has a a g a gender a lion has a gender I think most bugs have genders but there are people that don't have genders or they're fluffies or Furies or whatever they are don't you understand it's a spirit there's the reason why the Bible said women should have long hair men should not have long hair it goes to the same reasoning it needs their needs to be a clear distinction in the genders God does doesn't like that line blurred and if it's blurred he calls it an Abomination are you with me I'll skip that one but I'll finish with this one this is the one that that the women use to wear their sweat britches sweatpants and and put their children in pajamas and they do it because Mama wears them and they say things like well it's cold weather you know it's cold and a woman then get you a skirt to the ground and put something underneath it that we can't see and call that your underwear but don't shine it for other people to see it you see brother brandham said about those women uh the Scandal skirt one day I'm going to teach one day I'm going to teach on the Scandal skirt I have pictures but the Scandal skirt that brother brandham cried out against so much uh so many times was a skirt that had little leggings that came out from underneath the skirt it the skirt was made in such a way that it was was naturally hiked up and these little leggy things were there and I've got pictures of them and her name was Clara Bo and brother brandham talked about her and she was the one who made him famous and brother brandham said they're rightly named Scandal skirt cried out against them just like he did the split tail skirts cried out against them because he felt like that it was a compromise and pertain those those little now I don't think that's pertain to a man but those are leggy things that were hanging out the bottom they pertain to a man the words pertain you're just preaching your conviction am I I thought I was I thought I was just preaching what the what the scripture said excuse me excuse me if I'm out of order I thought I was just giving you what the scripture said now this shows you a prophet that know everything and thank God for one who commit he didn't questions and answers of paragraph 270 question 367 and we're going going to be hard to have an anointed prayer altar call service worship service after this the question was I'd like to ask a question number one is lady's pajamas is a lady's pajamas pertaining to a man's garment I'm going to be real honest with you I don't know why in the world she even asked such a question like this in 1964 but she did so brother brandham who didn't even like to talk about ladies hoery he was so unfamiliar with the cycle of a woman's body because it wasn't discussed it's not like it is today where everybody knows everybody else's time women didn't talk about it in those days it was a reality but it wasn't something it was talked about like oh it's that time of the month for me and you know that's why I'm so grouchy and they they just didn't talk about it and that's why brother brandham said some things that are just incorrect concerning that for instance saying that the only time that a woman's body released those eggs was with stimulation and that's just not the truth it happens every month and those eggs that are not fertilized are flushed out of her body in a cycle that God created if I'm embarrassing you I'm very sorry sorry but it's a very natural thing now and we need to speak it just like it is but brother Bram didn't understand that because it wasn't something that was talked about and he literally thought the only time that happened was and he found out that wasn't the way it was maybe maybe when he got to Heaven maybe somebody told him later maybe his wife told him I don't know he said boy don't tell me they can't ask you some burners he said I don't know I don't know did you know brother bam never used the word pertaineth when referring to Deuteronomy 22:5 he just said woman shouldn't wear that which pertains shouldn't wear a man's garment and vice versa he didn't use that word pertaineth when referring to the Garment he used that new testament pertaineth unto God or what whatever that verse of scripture is he never used that word in association with Deuteronomy 22 and5 that wasn't something that really stuck out to him in such a way that he made it a part of his preaching so no wonder he came and said I don't know I'm just going to let you know uh I'm going to let you do the deciding of that you shouldn't be parading around before people with a moan I know that so that way it would be but in the in going to bed you see all those dots and hyphens and that is a man on the spot that's a man who's not entirely comfortable with the question here I am talking about what some other man's wife is wearing to bed you know he saw it that way I don't I don't uh have that same kind of feeling he said so that it would be but in the in going to bed I I I don't know he said I'm going to have to back up on that one I told you I'd be honest if I didn't know I'm not going to put my own thought about it and I wouldn't want to do it that either he said all right unless you want my own thought what about all those people who say his opinion meant more to me than all right well then let's hear his opinion he said unless you want my own thought if you want that I'll tell you now remember it isn't it it this this could be a million miles wrong I think I I think it would look nice to have a night down on that's his opinion he said might have been more scriptural than he realized because the word says pertaineth and you can't tell me that a pair of pants pertains to a man but a pair of pants on a woman at night does not pertain to a man it's pertain it's not the purpose of the Garment it's not the designer of the Garment it's not the print on the Garment it's pertain whether you believe that or not it all goes back to Pride he said I I can't tell you that uh because I couldn't back it up he couldn't back it up what if somebody can what if somebody can look at Deuteronomy 22:5 and say emphatically that using just the language of the scripture the word pertaineth could mean garment it could even mean curling iron a man shouldn't be using a curling iron I don't have anything is curling iron Ben stop using a curling iron that's your problem that's what's happened if you quit using that curling iron it'll all grow back I mean I said that cuz he was doing this if a man were to use one he'd have to have long hair wouldn't he the Bible already said the Bible already said not for a man to have long hair so you can go with the quote I I I bless you you can go with the quote where brother said I don't know I I couldn't really say I'm not sure I'd be backing it up don't want to give you my opinion but if you really want my opinion I'll tell you I think it you'd look nicer than a night gown well he didn't mean somebody else's wife would look nice in a night gown he meant I think it would be nice for a woman to wear something that pertained to a woman a night gown instead of pajamas but he said I think I'd like I think it'd look nice and but I couldn't back it up couldn't back it up so now I'm going to leave it at that what if it could be backed up what if we have gotten to a place where we have used these things to mean something they don't even mean and when we go back and take a look at them they slap Us in the face and they mean more than what we ever realize they mean pertain itth the one thing I know is that God said even the very look of Pride I hate that and what is it that makes somebody want to try to go around the word Lord Jesus help us to take your word as your word if I've heard anybody's feelings I pray that they will soon heal let's stand musicians coming but I just simply don't have any AP I'm not I I just don't have one yet maybe I'll come in here Tuesday night with my shoulders all down and apologize for telling you the truth and if I do You' be sure to snap a picture it burns in me that line shouldn't be [Music] blurred it should not be blurred the gender line should not be blurred it should be distinct some things we can't even apply but if God said I hate that it can apply if he says I hate it he hates it and now we look around and we wonder why in the world these all these preachers preach those things way back then and now look at the mess the world is in and nobody seems to want to say it anymore it is what it is if Pride partners with offense it sure can set up a dangerous trap for a Believer yes you're right what you do in the privacy of your home is not up to me it's up to you your husband as a sister and God your husband may not care but the next question is does God I can't tell you what uh what the next generation will do about that because they all like to put these little britches you know first of all it started off as under the skirt like the like the apostolics you thought they were UPC because you see their leggings coming out from under their skirts and that that was that was tolerated to still is in the message people adopted that as their uniform as well and now for their little girls they would just put little uh tights or something like that on one thing but now it's pant suits it is you know I'm right Ruffles around the legs like that makes a difference Jackal lanterns little pants and little Ruffles candy canes and whatever else the world is interested in and now it's getting older and older and older and how in the world they're going to wrestle that thing if that girl gets old enough to be used to that how are they going to wrestle that away from her I don't understand if it pertains at 8 it pertains at eight months I have no judgment I have no condemnation for anybody that doesn't share that understanding but just know this it's more than my conviction it's what the scripture said pertaineth God help us woo Glory if you weren't looking you'd just got scared didn't you Lord I want to serve you I I didn't want to I didn't want to say that I I I really didn't and I thought there for a while I wouldn't even get to it because of time and then I knew that if I didn't get it off of me I'd have to call everybody back here tomorrow probably once you put something in there I I've got to cover it when I get to it and then we're going to move on Lord the one thing we don't want want to do is be we don't want to sww Discord among the brethren we don't want to have a lying tongue we don't want to have a proud look we we don't want to do anything that your word says that is detestable or something you abhor or something that you despise we don't want any part of it and probably there's so much more that should be addressed but Lord this is what you put on my heart so I ask that you will give us Grace no judgment let no family judge another family let no mother judge another mother let no Father Judge another father let it not be a a discussion at lunch to shame anybody but Lord let it be established that this seems to be what your word is saying to us and let us come back to our thoughts about Pride we just want to lay low before you as much as possible we want to be faithful at the end at the end I want to be a fa faithful man at the end I believe these Saints want to be faithful men and faithful women unto God are is this the most important thing we have to preach no no it's not a lot of this wasn't the most important thing but may be needful anyway give us Grace Lord to move forward in all things and love one another most of all when we come to worship you we want to have clean hands and a pure heart we don't want to be mad we don't want to be offended we don't want to be rude to one another we want to to show as much love as we possibly can I'm struck by the fact that that poish woman had all those jewels on just like we read in Isaiah 3 it's a look of pride May we be clean outside and inside may we be free from pride May we be humble before you not false humility but the real kind that says Lord if you can use anything you can use me most of all we we want to say we love you supremely above all things if there are those who believe us we we bless them in the name of Jesus Christ and uh we are thankful that they were here with us this morning we give you the honor and the praise and the glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may leave if you desire to if you need to you certainly can uh th for those of us is 2:21 for those of us who won't believing uh would you come and lead us in just a bit of worship Benjamin and let's Worship the Lord I'm not going to have a hard
