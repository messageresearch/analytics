[46:36] today what a blessing to be able to
[46:38] gather in the house of the Lord with the
[46:41] saints of
[46:42] God how he has ministered to us and got
[46:47] us through sicknesses and let us be able
[46:52] to come back to the house of the
[46:54] Lord continues to help us how great he
[46:58] is we're going to receive the tithe and
[47:01] the offering today to give to the Lord
[47:04] he's uh wonderful and worthy and he has
[47:09] been the one who has provided for us
[47:11] everything that we
[47:13] have anything that we have is because of
[47:16] him any abilities that we have is
[47:20] because of him and we want to give him
[47:23] the the praise and we want to keep
[47:26] Covenant with him in our tithe and in
[47:28] our
[47:29] offering uh just a a little brief update
[47:34] to you uh we don't tell everything that
[47:38] is going on I am one who a lot of times
[47:43] like to try to stay under the
[47:45] radar and uh so I don't tell everything
[47:48] I know and uh the the enemy likes to
[47:52] twist and distort and do all sorts of
[47:55] things
[47:56] and so anyhow um we we mentioned that
[48:00] we're trying to get something going down
[48:02] under the Tabernacle I would like to
[48:04] give the Lord Praise because we have
[48:08] successfully uh gotten the poll uh
[48:12] passed by the Lee County building
[48:14] inspections department and after brother
[48:17] Shelley spent probably over an hour on
[48:20] the telephone this week this week to get
[48:23] tpusa to hook up that poll
[48:26] uh and give them quite a bit of money to
[48:29] hook up to that poll that is
[48:31] successfully done and we will expect
[48:33] that it will be hooked up this week and
[48:36] so we give the Lord praise for
[48:41] that so
[48:45] um when I went initially I I'm going to
[48:49] I'm going to give you a confession
[48:51] today when I went initially to the
[48:53] building inspections department I was
[48:56] trying to give them reference where the
[48:58] pole was and I said it's near a open
[49:02] steel
[49:04] structure well for whatever reason the
[49:07] lady said are you going to wire that
[49:10] structure and I said
[49:13] no the structure is already wired but
[49:16] there's no power to it well I lost sleep
[49:21] over it and the Lord dealt with me see
[49:24] that's what the word does
[49:27] that's what the word does it brings
[49:30] conviction to us the goodness of God in
[49:34] our lives brings us to
[49:37] conviction and keeps us on the way of
[49:41] Holiness the straight way because we
[49:45] don't want to be fallen in one ditch or
[49:47] the other ditch we want to stay right on
[49:50] the the straight place that the Lord has
[49:52] ordained for us and so when I I called
[49:56] the following day after I knew the
[49:58] inspector had been here to look at the
[49:59] poll they were supposed to have sent me
[50:01] an email to verify that that poll had
[50:04] been uh accepted or rejected and I did
[50:07] not get the email so I called back to
[50:09] the building inspections department and
[50:12] I asked about it and she said yes it has
[50:16] been passed and it's already been sent
[50:18] to talapa to let them know that it has
[50:21] passed and then I asked to speak to the
[50:23] building inspector and he called me back
[50:26] later and I asked him if he would meet
[50:28] me underneath of the Tabernacle well in
[50:31] that meeting everything underneath of
[50:34] that structure had to be updated so this
[50:38] week there has been a lot of uh uh all
[50:41] the old lights are gone uh there's all
[50:44] the old wiring is gone and so it's
[50:46] having to be completely uh rewired and
[50:50] that is for our safety and uh we're
[50:53] expecting a second uh inspection in
[50:56] coming days and weeks as we get that
[50:59] completed but we're trying by God's
[51:02] grace to get a place where we can meet
[51:05] together and not have to go off of the
[51:07] eagle Refuge we just want to have a
[51:10] place where that we can meet together
[51:12] and have Fellowship so that is what is
[51:15] going on I tell you that because we uh
[51:19] we want you to keep giving we even
[51:21] though it it you're not you may not be
[51:24] seeing anything it's happening it is
[51:27] happening by the grace of God and so
[51:30] we're we're going to need a lot of help
[51:33] uh in coming weeks uh I haven't asked
[51:36] this week because I wasn't going to
[51:38] subject you to the cold I don't mind
[51:41] subjecting myself but I wasn't going to
[51:43] ask you but as it gets warmer we're
[51:45] going to have to start asking for some
[51:47] of your help
[51:50] and I gave him the
[51:54] option
[51:58] hard Choice he made the hard choice and
[52:01] went and worked when I wasn't there and
[52:03] I appreciate it so much so we're
[52:05] grateful that God is he is helping us
[52:09] and we continue to move forward in the
[52:12] things of the Lord more than anything
[52:15] else we want to hear the voice of God in
[52:18] our ears we want to hear what he has for
[52:21] us in this house as the preaching is
[52:24] going out from this place we want to
[52:27] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[52:29] church and we want to stay right in line
[52:32] with it so with that if you brought your
[52:35] tithe and offering with you today we
[52:37] want to give you opportunity to give to
[52:39] the Lord Stephen would you help us and
[52:42] brother Ellas would you help us and

[56:21] love
[56:22] divine you know you are yes you may be
[56:25] seated you don't have to ask
[56:27] anybody you know you are it's the blood
[56:31] that's done the work the life in the
[56:33] blood and Grace was the vehicle that
[56:37] brought the blood to you Hallelujah so
[56:39] if you should hear the prophet say it
[56:41] wasn't the blood just know that it was
[56:43] the blood it takes the blood grace alone
[56:47] could never do it right it was grace
[56:50] that brought the token blood to you so
[56:53] the blood cleanses us and Grace brings
[56:55] it to our door aren't you glad that
[56:59] Grace and the blood cooperate together
[57:03] you you've got to look at the whole
[57:04] picture you can't take one sentence and
[57:07] miss the whole thing when I first came
[57:09] around this truth there were those who
[57:12] uh wouldn't wouldn't sing about the
[57:13] blood
[57:15] anymore and and I said oh my have we
[57:18] become so false that we can't sing about
[57:21] the precious blood I can give you so
[57:25] many things about that blood and we know
[57:27] how precious it is and it hasn't lost
[57:30] its power but the blood would have just
[57:33] been out there and you wouldn't have had
[57:34] any way to get to it it's not the
[57:36] chemistry of the blood but it's the life
[57:39] that's in the blood but Grace come along
[57:41] like a choo choo train picked up the
[57:44] life of the blood and brought it all the
[57:46] way to your doorstep and dropped it
[57:48] right off now if you can explain it
[57:51] better than that I'll let you but I see
[57:54] it that way way I'm thankful for I'm
[57:57] redeemed not just saved there's a church
[58:00] out there and some of them are
[58:03] saved the Bible said whosoever believeth
[58:06] and calleth on the name of the Lord
[58:09] shall be saved we're not just talking
[58:12] about salvation we're talking about
[58:15] another step and that's the step of
[58:17] redemption and that takes you all the
[58:19] way back to the original thoughts of God
[58:21] about you when he saw you when he knew
[58:24] knew you when he saw you when he knew
[58:27] every choice you would ever make he knew
[58:30] what you would be doing on January the
[58:32] 2st
[58:34] 2024 and he made provision for your life
[58:37] and he made provision for your
[58:39] Redemption and we are so thankful for
[58:43] that if you're thankful give him a
[58:46] [Applause]
[58:51] praise
[58:53] Hallelujah
[58:55] we greet all of you who are streaming
[58:58] this service this morning in the
[59:00] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:03] we're so thankful that you have joined
[59:05] us from so many places around the world
[59:10] may God bless you today in the same
[59:12] manner that He blesses the body of
[59:14] Christ that's gathered here locally I
[59:17] want to thank the Lord that the nearly
[59:21] uh foot of snow that came to
[59:24] Pennsylvania came this weekend and not
[59:27] last
[59:29] weekend we have so much to thank God
[59:32] for and uh we had plenty we had enough
[59:36] to get around we didn't have to stop we
[59:38] could keep moving but you know that's a
[59:40] lot of snow on country roads and uh
[59:43] we're thankful we told you uh that that
[59:47] uh we were glad to get out when we did
[59:49] but I found myself missing uh uh the
[59:52] people this week and and you know it's
[59:56] the character of the people the the
[59:58] beautiful thing about the church is the
[1:00:00] character of God's people I want you to
[1:00:03] know we are blessed to know that his
[1:00:06] life within us produces character and if
[1:00:10] you haven't come to that maturity yet
[1:00:12] keep
[1:00:12] pressing keep pressing because it's
[1:00:15] still available for you God is still in
[1:00:18] the sanctifying business I only have one
[1:00:21] birthday on my calendar for this week
[1:00:24] and that is Landon May hold hold up your
[1:00:27] hand is he in here hold up your hand so
[1:00:30] I can't hardly see that far back I do

[1:00:44] sweet 16 let's wish him a happy birthday

[1:00:56] Gregory and Samantha got old so
[1:01:01] fast to have a 16year old boy that I'm
[1:01:04] telling you that hit you that Gob
[1:01:08] smacked you when you realize that your
[1:01:10] babies are not babies anymore and now
[1:01:13] you've got 11 16 and you got several
[1:01:15] coming right along behind them I pray
[1:01:18] that he has a good birthday I want to
[1:01:21] remind you we did pray but I want to
[1:01:24] remind you you that uh that we should uh
[1:01:27] be praying and sharing and inviting
[1:01:29] people to come to the meetings and that
[1:01:32] is the first weekend of April excuse me
[1:01:35] February I had the the SEC the next set
[1:01:38] on my mind uh that is the 3 and the 4th
[1:01:42] of February Saturday night and Sunday
[1:01:45] morning and we're looking forward to
[1:01:47] What the Lord Has for us seemed like
[1:01:49] it's been months since we had a
[1:01:51] fellowship time together but it's not
[1:01:53] only two months
[1:01:55] and uh we're looking forward to February
[1:01:58] and April and I'm already looking
[1:02:00] forward to camp meeting and uh what all
[1:02:03] God has for us this year and uh the the
[1:02:07] the changes that we're going to be
[1:02:08] making to the Tabernacle you should
[1:02:11] understand that they are semi-permanent
[1:02:13] we're putting a semi-permanent solution
[1:02:15] in place and when we say that we we just
[1:02:19] simply mean it won't be the final
[1:02:21] solution but it's a step in the right
[1:02:24] Direction and uh that building is to be
[1:02:27] used for the glory of God I don't know I
[1:02:31] have to be honest with you I don't know
[1:02:32] whether it will ever be used for a camp
[1:02:34] meeting service again I don't know that
[1:02:38] it could possibly be we have precious
[1:02:41] Promises of what God's going to do for
[1:02:43] us at camp meeting doesn't matter to me
[1:02:45] whether he does them he's not limited to
[1:02:47] a building it doesn't matter to me
[1:02:50] whether he does them down there or
[1:02:51] whether he does them up here but we have
[1:02:54] have h a lot of money in that building
[1:02:57] and it sits there empty and has for a
[1:02:59] long time and uh rather than starting
[1:03:02] from scratch we feel like it would be
[1:03:05] better we would be better stewards of
[1:03:07] what God has given us if we started
[1:03:08] working so we're going to one end of it
[1:03:11] and we're going to start working across
[1:03:14] and we're going to see what God has for
[1:03:16] us somebody said what about this Vision
[1:03:18] or what about that Vision well just let
[1:03:20] me say one thing to you I had a vision
[1:03:23] concerning the multip purpose use of
[1:03:25] this building and in it many years ago
[1:03:29] there were printing
[1:03:33] presses I am not expecting that part of
[1:03:36] the vision to ever be
[1:03:40] fulfilled Oho it's got
[1:03:42] quiet because we don't need printing
[1:03:46] presses we don't need them anymore we
[1:03:49] get
[1:03:50] printers and
[1:03:52] binders and we can print all the books
[1:03:55] we want without a big printing
[1:03:57] press I uh when when but what I saw in
[1:04:01] the vision was at that time that's how
[1:04:04] you would have produced some books is
[1:04:06] through a printing press and did you
[1:04:08] know that the voice of God does not own
[1:04:10] a printing press did you know that all
[1:04:13] the printing presses are gone out of
[1:04:15] that building every one of them gone
[1:04:17] they don't even need them they don't use
[1:04:19] them anymore printing a book to them is
[1:04:22] an obsolete thing there are no no more
[1:04:24] books of the message being
[1:04:26] printed I don't know if you knew that or
[1:04:28] not they're not necessary anymore
[1:04:31] because they have a tablet that is
[1:04:33] available that you can have you don't
[1:04:35] even have to have a tablet you can
[1:04:37] download them from your phone print them
[1:04:39] if you want to I mean this is incredible
[1:04:44] you you don't have to wait on a book I
[1:04:46] used to order books and wait on the
[1:04:47] books to come order tapes and wait on
[1:04:50] the tapes to come now everything you
[1:04:52] need is at your fingertip that is not a
[1:04:56] shame somebody said what a shame you
[1:04:59] you've got African pastors who now have
[1:05:01] the ability to communicate with one
[1:05:04] another who never could communicate with
[1:05:06] one another before because they hold a
[1:05:08] tablet in their hand that has
[1:05:10] communication ability and if one gets a
[1:05:13] translation of a sermon he has the
[1:05:16] ability to send it to all of his
[1:05:18] brothers just say for instance they
[1:05:20] don't have Wi-Fi there is a
[1:05:22] communication system built in those
[1:05:25] tablets that go overseas that he has the
[1:05:28] ability to send a sermon to another
[1:05:30] tablet without
[1:05:33] Wii now you know that's something else
[1:05:37] and so I do believe that we will have
[1:05:40] books in fact I'm going to quote from
[1:05:42] one today but uh we won't need a
[1:05:45] printing press to do it well then the
[1:05:47] vision wasn't correct well you can have
[1:05:48] that attitude if you want to but you
[1:05:52] might get in trouble with the Lord
[1:05:54] the goal of that is to have books
[1:05:58] available whether we have a big old
[1:06:00] obsolete printing press to print them on
[1:06:02] or not or whether we can do it with a
[1:06:05] printer or whether we just say anybody
[1:06:07] who wants a copy you have it on a PDF
[1:06:10] how many of you saw that the PDF of
[1:06:13] brother Perry Green's testimony RJ has
[1:06:16] added that to the app did you get the
[1:06:19] message so you can go to your app you
[1:06:22] can download that I assume is that right
[1:06:25] we can down download it you can download
[1:06:27] it you can print it and you've got the
[1:06:30] PDF you've got the book you don't need
[1:06:32] to have a a a printed copy available you
[1:06:35] print your own copy if you can't print
[1:06:38] if you don't have a printer we'll do it
[1:06:40] for you we don't mind to do that and uh
[1:06:43] maybe the printer that we bought from
[1:06:44] Amazon back there won't be uh big enough
[1:06:47] to do the job that we will do in the
[1:06:49] future but we'll have what we need in
[1:06:51] the right time if you believe that say
[1:06:54] amen am so don't lament because
[1:06:57] something doesn't happen exactly the way
[1:06:59] we expect it to happen as long as it
[1:07:02] happens as long as God gets the glory as
[1:07:06] long as what is available what he
[1:07:08] desires to be available to the people is
[1:07:10] available I am all right with that we
[1:07:14] need a place to be together Fellowship
[1:07:17] is a part of of of New Testament
[1:07:21] Christianity they met in homes they fell
[1:07:23] fellowship with one another they broke
[1:07:25] bread together and we need that
[1:07:27] Fellowship so I am very excited and we
[1:07:32] will tell you more about the project as
[1:07:34] it as it moves forward the truth is we
[1:07:37] don't know all there is to know about it
[1:07:38] yet and and because ideas or have come
[1:07:42] and changes are already made to those
[1:07:44] ideas please understand that we're not
[1:07:46] trying to keep anything from you that
[1:07:48] you need to know there's nothing going
[1:07:51] on under the table here we just don't
[1:07:53] know
[1:07:55] didn't you hear brother gy say we want
[1:07:57] leadership we want leadership in every
[1:07:59] detail cuz we don't have to do it we
[1:08:02] don't want to have to do it twice and we
[1:08:04] don't want to do it wrong and have to
[1:08:06] turn around and do it right we want to
[1:08:08] be good stewards of what God's put in
[1:08:10] our hands I had a wonderful thing happen
[1:08:13] to me this morning uh as I was looking
[1:08:16] through the week and Landon's birthday
[1:08:18] was the only birthday you know on on on
[1:08:22] calendars when you use the Apple
[1:08:24] calendar or Google Calendar it gives you
[1:08:26] the option of repeating that so if I put
[1:08:30] your birthday in I can put repeat that
[1:08:32] every year and every year I won't have
[1:08:34] to copy and pay it'll be there your
[1:08:36] birthday will be there well I did that
[1:08:38] many years ago Church payment
[1:08:41] due 21st of the month Church payment due
[1:08:46] and I enjoyed myself immensely when I
[1:08:50] looked at the calendar today and it said
[1:08:53] Church payment do and I
[1:08:55] said
[1:08:58] no no it
[1:09:01] ain't no it
[1:09:04] ain't God has made the way I'm thankful
[1:09:09] are you thankful for the
[1:09:11] musicians everything they do and the
[1:09:13] worship leading God bless you all let's
[1:09:18] stand I only have about 3
[1:09:21] hours of material today
[1:09:27] so we'll try to be through in at least 2
[1:09:29] hours and 50 minutes we'll trim it
[1:09:33] down not many laughs this morning I can
[1:09:36] tell you're
[1:09:41] struggling I'm going to be on
[1:09:44] watch I have this sneaky
[1:09:47] suspicion that there are those Among Us
[1:09:49] who were up
[1:09:51] late perhaps watching the playoff
[1:09:54] offs like anybody really
[1:09:57] cares if you fall
[1:10:02] asleep I'm going to call your
[1:10:04] name and if I miss what kept you up that
[1:10:08] don't matter this is not the
[1:10:13] hotel they sit in the memory
[1:10:16] foam this is get ourselves trained
[1:10:20] because we have no idea what we're about
[1:10:22] to face in many many ways can you say
[1:10:25] Amen am we're praying every day for
[1:10:28] Israel we're praying every day for
[1:10:30] Jerusalem things are opening up on the
[1:10:33] Northern front there were there were uh
[1:10:36] some terrorists taken out yesterday in
[1:10:39] Damascus which should settle the thought
[1:10:41] in people's minds does Israel have the
[1:10:44] potential of reaching Damascus that's
[1:10:48] settled can they take out a vehicle with
[1:10:51] terrorists without without harming
[1:10:53] anything else
[1:10:54] yes the technology is there that is
[1:10:56] settled and will continue to to play out
[1:11:00] uh there are also targets that are being
[1:11:03] eliminated on the northern border just
[1:11:05] across in into Lebanon both Hamas
[1:11:09] because some of the leaders have fled
[1:11:11] there to the to the to the northern part
[1:11:14] which would be the southern part of
[1:11:16] Lebanon the northern part of Israel and
[1:11:18] also Hezbollah and those of you who know
[1:11:21] anything about what's going on in the
[1:11:23] world Hezbollah has many more times the
[1:11:28] potential and the Weaponry to engage in
[1:11:32] a long-term battle and that is because
[1:11:35] they are they are backed by by Iran and
[1:11:40] uh they already have the the weapons in
[1:11:43] hand so we have to pray for the North
[1:11:48] and the South we have to pray for Syria
[1:11:51] to the north uh East and we have to
[1:11:54] believe that God will continue to watch
[1:11:56] over his people and especially any
[1:12:00] hostages that may yet be alive and we
[1:12:02] believe there are some that are may God
[1:12:04] watch over them and keep them this is
[1:12:06] our prayer whether we mention it every
[1:12:09] service or not it's our daily life we
[1:12:11] watch it and we pray so I'm going to
[1:12:14] preach uh today and and the theme is
[1:12:18] going to be
[1:12:19] praise until the spirit of worship comes
[1:12:24] worship until the glory comes and then
[1:12:28] stand in the glory I'm going to read 2
[1:12:32] Chronicles 5 beginning in verse 12 and I
[1:12:36] would appreciate all the sacrifices of
[1:12:39] amens that you could possibly produce
[1:12:41] today because we are in a time of of
[1:12:45] spiritual something something is stirred
[1:12:48] it's not all it's not all good it's not
[1:12:51] all beautiful there's some Darkness
[1:12:54] that's being pushed back with our our
[1:12:56] prayers with our praise with our worship
[1:12:59] there are spirits that are being pushed
[1:13:01] back because of prayer and praise and
[1:13:03] worship and we must keep doing them
[1:13:05] because they're not welcome in this
[1:13:07] house and they're not welcome to touch
[1:13:10] your life and we want you to to be
[1:13:13] protected and kept in times like this so
[1:13:17] help us build this
[1:13:19] atmosphere 2 Chronicles chap 5 beginning
[1:13:23] in verse 12 and the Levites which were
[1:13:26] the
[1:13:27] singers all of them of Asaf of himon of
[1:13:33] judan with their sons and their Brethren
[1:13:37] and that would be udun or
[1:13:40] udon being arrayed in white linen having
[1:13:45] symbols and suies and harps stood at the
[1:13:50] East End Of The Altar and with with them
[1:13:54] 120 priests sounding with trumpets
[1:13:59] that's a lot of
[1:14:00] noise do you know how loud trumpets are
[1:14:04] very loud 120 trumpets and singers and
[1:14:10] what were the other instruments
[1:14:11] mentioned symbols
[1:14:14] suies and harps so there's percussion
[1:14:18] instruments represented there to all of
[1:14:22] those churches struggling to keep the
[1:14:26] beat come
[1:14:28] on there's an answer to that and it
[1:14:32] doesn't have to be rock and
[1:14:37] roll there are instruments that can help
[1:14:39] you keep the beat and help you keep the
[1:14:43] Rhythm and if that ever becomes a
[1:14:46] problem tone it down or kick it
[1:14:48] out but you don't have to let fear keep
[1:14:51] you from producing anointed
[1:14:53] music for people to worship god with it
[1:14:57] goes
[1:14:58] on it came even to pass as the
[1:15:01] trumpeters and singers were as one now I
[1:15:04] want to tell you something when the
[1:15:06] musicians and the singers can work
[1:15:09] together in
[1:15:10] unison and in unity even you as a singer
[1:15:14] in the
[1:15:15] congregation this is not one person
[1:15:17] trying to overshadow someone else but
[1:15:21] this is voices Harmony his voices
[1:15:25] blending together where you can hardly
[1:15:28] hear the distinction of anyone's voice
[1:15:31] it sounds like one Voice Hallelujah it
[1:15:35] sounds like one sound and when people
[1:15:38] come together in praise and worship and
[1:15:41] release one sound the enemy is run
[1:15:46] out and the glory of the Lord is invited
[1:15:50] in Hallelujah so they were as one to to
[1:15:56] make one sound to be heard in praising
[1:16:02] and thanking the lord it's
[1:16:06] unkey
[1:16:10] yes it's not
[1:16:14] distracting and it's not self uh
[1:16:18] motivated so that you're drawing
[1:16:20] attention to
[1:16:21] yourself but it's one
[1:16:24] sound oh I can't tell you what that
[1:16:27] feels like in my feeler when I say that
[1:16:31] one sound to be heard in praising and
[1:16:35] thanking the lord and when
[1:16:40] they oh do you understand what that
[1:16:43] means it means they were no longer
[1:16:46] Whispering it was still a sacred moment
[1:16:49] it was still a holy place but they were
[1:16:52] no longer whispering to one another they
[1:16:55] lifted up their voice with the trumpets
[1:17:00] those loud trumpets and symbols and
[1:17:04] instruments of music and praise the Lord
[1:17:08] saying for he is good for his mer ain't
[1:17:12] that about what we were singing this
[1:17:14] morning for his mercy endureth forever
[1:17:18] that
[1:17:19] then then not before the
[1:17:23] praise
[1:17:25] then then the house was filled with a
[1:17:29] cloud and that cloud was the visible
[1:17:34] manifestation of the Shak the Shina
[1:17:39] Glory presence of the Lord his presence
[1:17:43] more than an emotional response or a
[1:17:46] feeling but the
[1:17:49] manifested amen tangible Glory
[1:17:54] of the Lord came into the house as a
[1:17:58] cloud even the house of the
[1:18:03] Lord so we have an
[1:18:06] example of
[1:18:08] praise until the spirit of worship comes
[1:18:12] when those voices begin to blend
[1:18:15] together see praise I know you're
[1:18:18] standing so am I praise is a very
[1:18:22] individ idual thing we do it corporately
[1:18:26] but we don't express ourselves all the
[1:18:29] same praise is
[1:18:31] individual a and it is
[1:18:36] personal and we don't all do the
[1:18:39] same
[1:18:40] right that doesn't mean we should be
[1:18:43] comfortable in our
[1:18:46] non-committal we need to commit to
[1:18:48] praise but yours may not look like
[1:18:51] somebody else's and genuine praise is
[1:18:55] not
[1:18:58] affected by your present State of
[1:19:01] Mind CU praise genuine praise has
[1:19:05] nothing to
[1:19:07] do with
[1:19:09] you your yes is all that's required your
[1:19:13] willingness is all that's required so we
[1:19:17] who praise
[1:19:18] less when we're in a storm have missed
[1:19:22] the importance of what praise can do you
[1:19:25] get in a storm you don't praise less you
[1:19:28] come to a place of Babylonian confusion
[1:19:31] and you don't praise less and we're not
[1:19:34] talking about just going through the
[1:19:36] motions we're talking about connect well
[1:19:39] I can't connect cuz I don't believe in
[1:19:41] everything that everybody else's
[1:19:43] believes in well I beat that devil I
[1:19:46] whipped him amen for 10 years God sent
[1:19:49] me on the road for 10 years all over
[1:19:52] over the world to Pentecostal and
[1:19:55] charismatic churches where 2third of
[1:19:58] what was being said I couldn't agree
[1:20:01] with
[1:20:01] it but I wasn't responsible for what
[1:20:04] they were talking about my turn was
[1:20:08] coming now had I gone in there and and
[1:20:11] not worshiped or tried to praise the
[1:20:13] Lord because I didn't like the song or
[1:20:15] the music or the song
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:19] leader and I sat in some of the best
[1:20:23] Jason Upton was that his
[1:20:25] name and Joanne
[1:20:28] McFatter and and Brian and Jan Johnson
[1:20:32] from from
[1:20:34] California and uh some others that were
[1:20:38] invited to lead Worship in these places
[1:20:40] where I was speaking now they did learn
[1:20:43] that the noise you think it's loud in
[1:20:47] here you've never heard loud so they
[1:20:50] would meet me my my security
[1:20:53] team that would come and pick me out of
[1:20:56] my hotel room and Lead Me In would have
[1:20:59] a pair of earphones for me earplugs to
[1:21:02] put in I didn't even let that hinder my
[1:21:05] praise I wasn't there to say I agree
[1:21:07] with what you're doing or what you teach
[1:21:11] right right I was there on assignment
[1:21:14] and I wouldn't let my praise and My
[1:21:16] Worship be
[1:21:19] affected because it wasn't to praise the
[1:21:22] preacher or to bless the teacher or to
[1:21:25] support the worship leader I was there
[1:21:28] to praise the Lord because he is
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:36] worthy Hallelujah you may be
[1:21:39] seated I I want to know what happened
[1:21:43] here here the Levites were gathered
[1:21:47] together with singers with trumpeters
[1:21:50] with symbol players those who played the
[1:21:54] Sues and the and the harps and they
[1:21:57] stood a at the dedication of the Lord's
[1:22:00] house and they began to make music unto
[1:22:04] the Lord until they did it in one
[1:22:09] voice you see praise again is an
[1:22:12] individual thing even when we do it
[1:22:15] corporately it is a
[1:22:18] conglomeration of everybody's
[1:22:21] overflow some are louder by Nature than
[1:22:24] others and some break through the
[1:22:27] barrier of their own
[1:22:30] personality and you wonder do I want to
[1:22:32] put him back in the
[1:22:35] Box because when some people burst out
[1:22:38] of their
[1:22:39] box they come out like a
[1:22:45] bull and it's good but
[1:22:49] normally it finds its place without
[1:22:52] without anybody having to
[1:22:58] legislate or pass
[1:23:01] bills with
[1:23:03] committees to hold tell people to hold
[1:23:06] it down most people once they've been
[1:23:08] out of the box a while they just find
[1:23:11] their place Hallelujah and they blend
[1:23:16] but it's individuals some sing their
[1:23:19] praise and some speak their praise and
[1:23:22] we don't get to choose the methods of
[1:23:25] Our Praise they're outlined for us in
[1:23:27] the Bible we use our voice we use our
[1:23:32] posture yes sir we use our
[1:23:36] bodies as temples and we offer them to
[1:23:40] the Lord sometimes we stand sometimes we
[1:23:44] sit are you with me sometimes we lay
[1:23:48] prostrate on the
[1:23:50] floor I had to slow down a little bit I
[1:23:53] want to make sure I got the right word
[1:23:54] there that's
[1:23:57] prostrate that's what most people call
[1:23:59] the mail problem prostrate problems no
[1:24:03] that's not it that's prostate it's a
[1:24:06] little different sometimes we lay on our
[1:24:09] bellies before the
[1:24:11] Lord because his presence is so
[1:24:15] real I've been in that Glory ha I've
[1:24:19] been in that Glory where I didn't want
[1:24:21] to lift up my
[1:24:23] head I lay with my face my my teeth my
[1:24:27] nose my mouth buried in the carpet so to
[1:24:30] speak and I didn't even want to tilt up
[1:24:33] my head because the heavy
[1:24:37] weighted the heavy weight of his
[1:24:40] presence was so real that I didn't want
[1:24:43] to disturb
[1:24:45] it I recently heard a preacher say
[1:24:49] there'll be no dancing around the throne
[1:24:51] hogwash
[1:24:57] amen I'm going to
[1:25:00] dance I'm going to dance my way all the
[1:25:03] way to the throne and then I'll fall on
[1:25:05] my
[1:25:06] face if dancing is a part of Praise here
[1:25:10] it's certainly going to be a part of
[1:25:11] Praise
[1:25:13] there what I'm not going to do is what
[1:25:16] the charismatics talk about sometime I'm
[1:25:19] not going to March up to the throne
[1:25:21] crawl up on Daddy's and give him a high
[1:25:25] five that I'm not going to do and you
[1:25:28] ain't
[1:25:29] either and they ain't
[1:25:32] either you know people can get so
[1:25:36] comfortable but dance
[1:25:39] yeah and how do I know that won't
[1:25:41] displease the Lord because he told me to
[1:25:43] do it in his word are you still with me
[1:25:47] so praise is individual and uh well I
[1:25:51] don't want to give I don't want to skip
[1:25:52] around here let me just move on what was
[1:25:54] happening in this service that we read
[1:25:57] about here praise
[1:25:59] started the next thing you know voices
[1:26:02] begin to blend together with the
[1:26:04] trumpets and all of a sudden it was not
[1:26:07] many
[1:26:09] sounds it was not many expressions of
[1:26:13] praise it began to be one voice of
[1:26:18] worship this is how we learn the
[1:26:20] difference between praise and
[1:26:23] worship there there arose One Voice of
[1:26:28] Unity of
[1:26:31] Unison no one standing out Above the
[1:26:34] Rest everyone balancing themselves with
[1:26:37] the rest and a and a sound coming
[1:26:41] forward that was edifying and glorifying
[1:26:45] to the Lord and it was inviting the
[1:26:49] glory we are responsible to create an
[1:26:53] atmosphere for the word of God to go
[1:26:55] forth in we are responsible to create an
[1:26:59] atmosphere for God to come down and meet
[1:27:02] our needs so praise is how we enter in
[1:27:06] let us enter into his gat his courts
[1:27:09] with Thanksgiving and with praise praise
[1:27:12] is entering into his presence but
[1:27:16] worship is something
[1:27:19] different it's not necessarily
[1:27:22] uh as demonstrative it can
[1:27:25] be it's not always as visible which
[1:27:29] we'll get to a little bit later it can
[1:27:31] be sometimes someone is worshiping and
[1:27:35] you don't even know by looking at them
[1:27:37] there were they're just bowing their
[1:27:40] head and you may think that's a that
[1:27:42] person's dead there's no spirit in them
[1:27:44] at all no no no that's worship
[1:27:48] sometime definitely not
[1:27:51] praise
[1:27:54] again you don't get to choose how you
[1:27:56] praise you stand you sit you dance you
[1:27:59] you fall prostrate you speak you shout
[1:28:03] you sing Come On You clap your hands you
[1:28:06] raise your hands you play instruments
[1:28:09] with your hands where do you get this
[1:28:11] The Book of Psalms the greatest worship
[1:28:14] book praise and worship book in the
[1:28:15] Bible these are the ways and we should
[1:28:18] participate as Believers in all of those
[1:28:21] things
[1:28:23] we should all leap we should all at
[1:28:25] times when we're able dance we should
[1:28:27] all lift our hands we should all clap
[1:28:29] our hands we should all play
[1:28:33] instruments somebody said well I I
[1:28:36] really wish I could play the piano no
[1:28:40] you
[1:28:42] don't because the the proof of your of
[1:28:46] your desire is proven by your
[1:28:50] Pursuit not by your whin
[1:28:54] it's not too late for you to learn the
[1:28:57] guitar it's not too late for you to
[1:28:59] learn the piano why are you looking at
[1:29:01] me like
[1:29:03] that well I don't have time for that
[1:29:06] well you've got time for Fantasy
[1:29:07] Football you got time for what's it
[1:29:10] called Monopoly go you got time to burst
[1:29:13] your bubbles come on now you got time to
[1:29:17] do word
[1:29:18] searches some of you's got time to read
[1:29:20] Amish you know Christian
[1:29:24] fiction on
[1:29:27] now some of you's got time for Grace
[1:29:29] Livingston
[1:29:33] Hill some folks are backslid enough that
[1:29:36] they reach Stephen
[1:29:38] King and some of these other true true
[1:29:41] writers you know whatever you call
[1:29:43] them it's not edifying it's going to get
[1:29:46] quiet now just remember I was raised in
[1:29:50] a in a time in the cost when it was a
[1:29:53] sin they preached hard not to read the
[1:29:57] funny
[1:30:00] paper so I grew up not even reading the
[1:30:03] comic
[1:30:05] strips so I can preach it all day long
[1:30:09] there comes a time that we spread
[1:30:11] ourselves too thin with all kinds of
[1:30:14] other
[1:30:17] entertainments you could use a little
[1:30:19] bit of that time to learn a note
[1:30:23] come on
[1:30:24] now you ought to at least be able to do
[1:30:28] I can read I can
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:35] read an't that amazing I can read I can
[1:30:39] write I can so iron my daddy's shirts or
[1:30:42] whatever I don't remember what the rest
[1:30:43] of it was but but anybody could if you
[1:30:46] wanted to if you don't want to that's
[1:30:48] all right but don't be telling people
[1:30:50] you wished you could
[1:30:53] right is it one way to praise the Lord
[1:30:56] wouldn't it be something if everybody
[1:30:59] had a had that uh there'll be gifted
[1:31:02] people there there'll be those who have
[1:31:04] anointing to do it but we ought to use
[1:31:07] our hands if we're going to clap we're
[1:31:09] going to raise them why don't we use
[1:31:10] them for playing some kind of instrument
[1:31:12] sometime wouldn't that be amazing would
[1:31:15] be wonderful if we had an
[1:31:17] orchestra we might have to put them down
[1:31:19] there to get them all in but it'd be
[1:31:21] fine with me to use our hands to praise
[1:31:26] the
[1:31:26] Lord and so I Believe In davidic Praise
[1:31:31] but there comes a time that the glory of
[1:31:34] God desires his manifest presence he
[1:31:38] wants to pour that Among Us he wants
[1:31:40] that to flow into our lives because
[1:31:43] praise doesn't change
[1:31:47] us but Glory
[1:31:50] does
[1:31:53] you come in contact with the glory of
[1:31:56] God the cavod the
[1:32:02] heavy the heavy presence of the Lord and
[1:32:06] you'll never be the same just quite the
[1:32:09] same again some things are going to
[1:32:12] happen some of the world's going to roll
[1:32:13] off of you and the desires of your heart
[1:32:16] are going to change a little bit and
[1:32:18] here's the thing that's going to change
[1:32:20] the most your root
[1:32:22] ruined once you've ever tasted you're
[1:32:25] going to have to pray for me once you
[1:32:27] have ever tasted of that she that heavy
[1:32:32] Glory presence of the
[1:32:36] Lord you are
[1:32:41] ruined you have tasted it like an animal
[1:32:45] that has tasted Blood come on and now
[1:32:49] he's a danger to society
[1:32:52] an alligator that's attacked a human is
[1:32:55] a danger a bear that's attacked a human
[1:32:58] is a danger to society because they've
[1:33:01] got the taste of blood in them you let a
[1:33:05] Believer you let a Believer have a taste
[1:33:08] of the glory presence of the Lord and he
[1:33:12] or she is
[1:33:14] ruin it could never be church as usual
[1:33:18] again that's right you're going to leave
[1:33:21] an atmosphere like this and go back and
[1:33:23] sit in a Methodist
[1:33:27] Church how could anybody make such
[1:33:30] foolish decisions with their lives to
[1:33:33] leave a holy ghost place and there many
[1:33:36] of them to go back into formal
[1:33:40] religion sir you've not tasted of what
[1:33:44] I've tasted of you've not had a drink of
[1:33:47] what I've been drinking you get a drink
[1:33:49] of that and you're ruined amen
[1:33:51] absolutely ruined nothing no
[1:33:56] liturgy sir I don't care how true the
[1:33:59] truth is they
[1:34:01] preach nothing nothing can satisfy
[1:34:05] you but being in that
[1:34:08] presence it changes everything I want to
[1:34:11] ask you what happened in this Ser praise
[1:34:14] became worship yes sir and then it
[1:34:18] says in the in verse
[1:34:23] at the end of that verse for he is good
[1:34:25] his mercy endureth forever a and that
[1:34:29] then that then that then the house was
[1:34:33] filled with a cloud even
[1:34:38] even even the house of the Lord so that
[1:34:41] the priest could not stand to minister
[1:34:43] by reason of the cloud for the glory of
[1:34:45] the Lord had filled the house of God so
[1:34:49] really here it is you praise until the
[1:34:53] spirit of worship comes and you worship
[1:34:56] until the glory comes and then you don't
[1:35:00] rush to go home you
[1:35:02] stand in the glory if you can't stand in
[1:35:06] the glory you fall in the
[1:35:09] glory you kneel in the glory you lay
[1:35:12] down in the glory the point is you don't
[1:35:15] rush away from that presence of the Lord
[1:35:19] you'll soak it in
[1:35:21] and you linger there oh
[1:35:26] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:35:29] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:35:31] Hallelujah so what happened here
[1:35:35] Heaven invaded
[1:35:37] Earth that's right Heaven invaded
[1:35:42] Earth this is from Sister Ruth's
[1:35:45] writings on the
[1:35:47] glory she said as air is the atmosphere
[1:35:52] of the earth did you say she I
[1:35:56] did just because someone is a woman
[1:35:58] doesn't make them
[1:36:04] dumb brother vom said a woman has every
[1:36:07] right to every spiritual gift except
[1:36:09] handling the
[1:36:11] word somebody said well isn't writing
[1:36:13] about the glory handling the word I'll
[1:36:15] leave that up to you all I know is what
[1:36:18] she wrote Chang my life
[1:36:23] now why are we here talking about this
[1:36:25] this morning because I had a visitation
[1:36:28] from the Lord on December the 22nd of
[1:36:31] 2023 and in that Vision I was told that
[1:36:35] we were going to be mountain climbers
[1:36:36] this Gregorian year of
[1:36:39] 2024 and I I I asked the question how
[1:36:43] will we do
[1:36:44] that he said first be
[1:36:47] very
[1:36:50] surefooted watch your feet be
[1:36:53] strengthened in your feet be strategic
[1:36:56] with your
[1:36:57] feet watch where you
[1:37:00] step it's
[1:37:02] important I'll make your feet like
[1:37:04] hein's
[1:37:05] feet this is what he tells us and so I
[1:37:08] asked in this
[1:37:10] visitation I asked how will we do that
[1:37:14] and I was told five
[1:37:16] things and the first of those things was
[1:37:20] that we should should keep our balance I
[1:37:22] heard brother perig Green's voice saying
[1:37:25] whatever you do keep your balance in the
[1:37:29] scriptures and he was quoting what
[1:37:31] brother brandham had said to him the
[1:37:34] second voice I heard was that of brother
[1:37:35] brandham I recognized it immediately and
[1:37:38] he said whatever you do stay in the
[1:37:41] middle of the
[1:37:42] road and thirdly the next voice I heard
[1:37:45] was that of sister Ruth Ward hefin and
[1:37:49] she said pray praise whatever you do
[1:37:52] remember praise until the spirit of
[1:37:56] worship comes worship until the glory
[1:37:59] comes
[1:38:01] then stand in the glory so this morning
[1:38:05] we've made it to the third uh word of of
[1:38:10] advice of
[1:38:12] exhortation and there are two more to go
[1:38:14] but I'll be here for at least a couple
[1:38:16] of
[1:38:17] services as air is the atmosphere of the
[1:38:21] Earth glory is the atmosphere of Heaven
[1:38:26] that makes sense to me because it's the
[1:38:28] manifested presence of God it lifts us
[1:38:32] up hear us it lifts us up above the
[1:38:37] Earthly into the very presence of God
[1:38:42] the New Testament said we are we are
[1:38:45] raised to sit
[1:38:48] together we've been told by the message
[1:38:50] that that is is a present day reality
[1:38:53] we're not waiting to sit together in
[1:38:55] Heavenly places we are made to sit
[1:38:58] together in Heavenly places when we get
[1:39:01] in that presence of the Lord it is as
[1:39:03] though we are being
[1:39:04] lifted it is as though we are being
[1:39:07] lifted into another dimension alt
[1:39:09] together if you've been there you know
[1:39:12] can I just say today if you know you
[1:39:14] know and if you don't know you don't
[1:39:18] know but if you know you know and if you
[1:39:21] know then you know the
[1:39:24] importance as often as possible to go
[1:39:28] beyond
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:33] praise to come in to
[1:39:36] worship which is it's also very
[1:39:40] individual but it produces a very
[1:39:43] corporate
[1:39:44] sound when you've got more than one
[1:39:46] person in the same atmosphere pouring
[1:39:50] out
[1:39:52] like oil here's
[1:39:54] worship let let me give you praise when
[1:39:57] the spirit of the Lord is upon me I will
[1:40:02] dance like David
[1:40:05] dance that's praise worship is like
[1:40:10] oil upon your
[1:40:13] feet like wine for you to
[1:40:17] drink
[1:40:19] Lord like
[1:40:22] water from my
[1:40:25] heart I
[1:40:27] pour
[1:40:29] say I pour my love on
[1:40:35] you praise is not less than
[1:40:38] worship praise is as important as
[1:40:41] worship because nobody ever came under
[1:40:45] the spirit of worship that didn't get
[1:40:48] there by
[1:40:49] Praise amen there is an
[1:40:53] order praise first how long do you pray
[1:40:57] you
[1:40:58] praise you know three
[1:41:03] songs and again God have mercy if it was
[1:41:07] written after
[1:41:11] 1950 that's how some people
[1:41:14] are a young young man walked up to me at
[1:41:17] the wedding and he didn't know who I was
[1:41:20] I'm nobody but he didn't know who I was
[1:41:24] but he knew who another brother who was
[1:41:25] talking to me was and it was a little
[1:41:28] bit funny that he knew him and didn't
[1:41:30] know me but I didn't let it bother me
[1:41:32] the other brother said well do you know
[1:41:33] who this is and he said no I don't know
[1:41:36] him and anyway it went on but this
[1:41:38] brother began to talk about praise and
[1:41:40] worship he's a singer and of course if
[1:41:43] you're a singer it's important to you
[1:41:46] singing is important to you praise is
[1:41:48] important worship is important to you a
[1:41:51] and he began to talk a little bit about
[1:41:53] the the the influ the charismatic
[1:41:58] influence of the new
[1:42:00] worship and the new style and I said
[1:42:03] brother I'm with
[1:42:06] you if it's all about my reaction to
[1:42:12] God it's not enough but if it's about
[1:42:17] God if it's about him if it's about who
[1:42:21] he
[1:42:22] is when we praise we are emphasizing
[1:42:25] what God has done the Horse and Rider
[1:42:28] thrown into the
[1:42:30] sea but when we worship we're not
[1:42:33] emphasizing as much what God has done
[1:42:37] we're now emphasizing who God sh who God
[1:42:45] [Applause]
[1:42:48] is many people never get that
[1:42:52] far many praisers never get to
[1:42:57] worship many have not yet experienced
[1:43:00] being bathed in your own
[1:43:04] tears right because you praised beyond
[1:43:08] your manhood your manliness
[1:43:12] on you praised beyond your per I'm going
[1:43:15] to preach today if I have to Dr I'm
[1:43:17] going to preach it you praise beyond
[1:43:20] your D
[1:43:21] it you praised beyond your
[1:43:25] reputation your staunchness your
[1:43:28] religion call it what it is it's
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:34] religion you can praise with
[1:43:37] religion but real worship only takes
[1:43:40] place with
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:44] relationship so if all you have is is a
[1:43:47] religious connection to God you're going
[1:43:50] be a wonderful F praiser but if you want
[1:43:52] to move beyond the realm of Praise into
[1:43:55] the realm of worship so the glory can
[1:43:57] fall down on your head and Change Your
[1:43:59] Life Worship comes out of an overflow of
[1:44:03] a relationship of intimacy with God
[1:44:07] Almighty with our savior and bridegroom
[1:44:10] King the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua see
[1:44:13] worship is not focusing on on the might
[1:44:16] of his hand or the strength of his arm
[1:44:18] worship is IS F focusing on simply who
[1:44:22] he is You're
[1:44:25] Beautiful
[1:44:28] Jesus You're
[1:44:30] Beautiful Jesus I well I'm just not
[1:44:33] comfortable calling another man
[1:44:39] beautiful then you didn't praise your
[1:44:41] way to this place because if you praised
[1:44:44] your way to this place you forgot all
[1:44:46] that stuff sir you quit struggling over
[1:44:49] how a man can be the broad of Christ and
[1:44:51] how a woman can be the Son of God you
[1:44:53] get wo I'm
[1:44:55] preaching you get all that settled in
[1:44:58] the realm of Praise so the truth is some
[1:45:00] of us haven't praised enough we ought to
[1:45:04] be looking forward to some glorious days
[1:45:07] because some of our folks have some
[1:45:09] catching up to
[1:45:10] do with their
[1:45:13] praise because if you're still thinking
[1:45:15] like
[1:45:17] that I could never tell another man he's
[1:45:19] beautiful then why don't you remember
[1:45:21] that he's not just a man he's God
[1:45:25] Almighty and there was a time in his
[1:45:27] life and Ministry that there was no
[1:45:29] Beauty in him to be found and no
[1:45:32] comeliness but I want you to know from
[1:45:34] the Mount of
[1:45:35] transfiguration when God glorified him
[1:45:39] even the marring that took place at
[1:45:41] Calvary none of that could take away
[1:45:43] from the resurrected beauty of the
[1:45:45] glorified Christ you have listened to
[1:45:48] PMA Vision right you do know what he
[1:45:51] said about eyes like fire and feet like
[1:45:54] brass and you're
[1:45:57] beautiful
[1:46:01] Jesus You're
[1:46:03] Beautiful
[1:46:05] Jesus the heavens are
[1:46:10] open and I see the
[1:46:14] Lord You're
[1:46:17] Beautiful
[1:46:19] Jesus
[1:46:20] your
[1:46:22] beautiful
[1:46:24] Jesus the heavens are
[1:46:29] open and I
[1:46:31] see the
[1:46:34] Lord if you ever catch a
[1:46:38] glimpse if you ever catch a
[1:46:43] glimpse in the message confirmation
[1:46:46] confirmation and
[1:46:49] evidence paragraph
[1:46:52] 14
[1:46:53] remember that we mustn't never come to
[1:47:01] church to play
[1:47:05] religious I'm going to be honest with
[1:47:07] you I see people here sometime hiding
[1:47:09] behind a
[1:47:17] wiggle you think if you do that you
[1:47:20] really praising the
[1:47:22] Lord are you against that no I'm not
[1:47:25] against moving but some people aren't
[1:47:27] moving to praise they're moving to look
[1:47:32] busy it's going to be a little rough
[1:47:34] here just a few minutes I promise you it
[1:47:36] won't be long they're just moving to be
[1:47:38] a part of the crowd come on that I'm not
[1:47:42] even shaming you you want to be a part I
[1:47:44] want you to be a part so connect your
[1:47:47] heart to your
[1:47:48] wiggle let your heart be conect
[1:47:50] connected to God so that the
[1:47:51] demonstration of your body will be more
[1:47:54] than just a sway it'll be entered into
[1:47:58] the heavenlies as praise so that it can
[1:48:01] bring the the spirit of worship into
[1:48:04] your life that attracts draws and
[1:48:07] invites the glory to
[1:48:10] come because once you get in the glory
[1:48:13] you don't you don't feel the Wiggle
[1:48:15] anymore you don't feel the jump
[1:48:18] anymore you don't feel the squeal
[1:48:21] anymore come on it gets heavy on your
[1:48:23] head you ever have that shag Glory come
[1:48:27] and sit on top of your head it feels
[1:48:30] sometimes like your head is being shoved
[1:48:31] down into your neck into your shoulders
[1:48:34] the heavy weightiness of that Glory
[1:48:36] becomes so real that what you could do
[1:48:39] five minutes ago in a spirit of praise
[1:48:41] you can no longer do that's because
[1:48:43] you've gone somewhere do you hear what
[1:48:45] I'm teaching you today you've gone
[1:48:48] somewhere those of you that have been
[1:48:50] here long enough although I have new
[1:48:52] notes those of you who have been here
[1:48:54] long enough have gone through this
[1:48:55] teaching with me many years ago but even
[1:48:58] we sometime need a
[1:49:00] refresher come on people find various
[1:49:03] things to hide behind sometimes people
[1:49:05] hide behind their
[1:49:07] children and they stay constantly busy
[1:49:09] with their children not necessarily
[1:49:11] because the children have a
[1:49:13] need but because you have a need a need
[1:49:16] to hide a need to be checked
[1:49:19] out I saw the Judgment of God fall on a
[1:49:22] man one time who hid behind his little
[1:49:26] girl a presence of God fell in the room
[1:49:30] and he was hiding behind his child when
[1:49:33] he had every opportunity to
[1:49:36] participate that's why I'm never going
[1:49:38] to say anything about Nathan bringing
[1:49:41] his and brother Josh bringing his and
[1:49:43] and Tiffany bringing hers and whoever
[1:49:46] else brings their sister hope I've seen
[1:49:48] her over there both of them before
[1:49:50] and any of the rest of you whove come
[1:49:52] and you it it'd be better I know you'd
[1:49:54] like it better I've seen sister GW
[1:49:57] sister Anna Christine and and it'd be
[1:50:01] better for you if you didn't have to
[1:50:03] fool with
[1:50:04] them but you had
[1:50:08] them you brought them into the Earth
[1:50:12] hello why don't you introduce him to
[1:50:17] praise somebody said that little child
[1:50:19] was distracting me and the ow stop
[1:50:21] watching
[1:50:25] them I agree with you sometime but get
[1:50:28] your eyes off of
[1:50:30] that you're not here to people
[1:50:33] watch you're here to praise until the
[1:50:38] spirit of worship comes then worship
[1:50:40] until the glory come then
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:44] stand in the
[1:50:47] glory woo I hit 90 de with no
[1:50:52] music remember we mustn't never come to
[1:50:54] church to play religious we mustn't come
[1:50:57] to put on a religious act to go to
[1:50:59] church now I I've corrected you you know
[1:51:03] uh who
[1:51:05] move but but the reality is some people
[1:51:08] are so
[1:51:10] religious they come to church they can't
[1:51:12] ever
[1:51:15] move and somehow they feel
[1:51:17] spiritual by being stoic
[1:51:20] and may I just say especially
[1:51:26] preachers especially
[1:51:27] preachers sometimes a preacher behaves
[1:51:30] himself like it's beneath
[1:51:32] him to raise up his hands and turn his
[1:51:35] face toward God Almighty and begin to
[1:51:38] that's wrong folks that's wrong that's
[1:51:42] wrong I tell you leadership is leading
[1:51:44] in all things not just you be quiet and
[1:51:47] listen to me preach but let me show you
[1:51:49] how to to praise him let me show you how
[1:51:52] to worship him let me show you how to
[1:51:55] entertain the glory come on that's what
[1:51:58] servant leadership is all about it's not
[1:52:01] just it's not just you know buying your
[1:52:04] tank of gas it's a whole lot more than
[1:52:07] that and we need men and we're going to
[1:52:09] have them what if I told you we're going
[1:52:11] to have
[1:52:13] them because congregations that will not
[1:52:16] entertain the glory in the last days
[1:52:18] will be judged
[1:52:20] not in the end they'll be judged in the
[1:52:23] last
[1:52:24] days congregations that will not
[1:52:27] entertain the glory of the Lord the
[1:52:28] angel of God will come and write kabot
[1:52:31] over the
[1:52:33] door and that is the last plague brother
[1:52:36] brandom said that is spiritual
[1:52:39] death when he talks about spiritual
[1:52:41] death he's not talking about out there
[1:52:44] right he's talking among those who claim
[1:52:46] to know the truth you'll sit right on
[1:52:49] the Pew and drop and die if you're not
[1:52:52] careful because you want to fit into
[1:52:54] some kind of a of a mold that someone
[1:52:58] has created but there's going to come an
[1:53:00] hour I'm telling you I believe it with
[1:53:02] all my heart that God's no longer going
[1:53:04] to tolerate
[1:53:06] religion in his
[1:53:08] house and he's going to deal with those
[1:53:11] places that refuse to entertain the
[1:53:13] presence of the Lord now I don't mean to
[1:53:16] be critical or judgmental but let me
[1:53:18] tell you why men and women refuse to
[1:53:21] entertain the presence of the Lord
[1:53:22] because when he shows up he brings his
[1:53:25] love gifts with
[1:53:28] him and sin can be exposed
[1:53:32] then so if we keep the glory presence
[1:53:36] out and we keep the gifts out of the
[1:53:39] don't don't even bother with a back room
[1:53:42] because that doesn't work and it had
[1:53:43] never worked and it doesn't work come on
[1:53:48] yes sir maybe it's solve the problem at
[1:53:50] the brandham
[1:53:52] Tabernacle because it was preached for
[1:53:55] one man who was disturbing the service
[1:53:58] when brother brandham wasn't there
[1:54:00] brother brandham asked the deacons to
[1:54:02] deal with it and they could not do it
[1:54:04] and finally he come back they complain
[1:54:06] to him again he said if you can't deal
[1:54:08] with it I'll deal with it and so he gave
[1:54:11] Church
[1:54:13] order just put those gifts in a room and
[1:54:16] spiritual people meet before the service
[1:54:18] because of one man
[1:54:20] now had brother brandham been there more
[1:54:22] often perhaps he might have had the
[1:54:24] ability and the time to take that one
[1:54:26] man in a back
[1:54:29] room and put the word of Correction on
[1:54:31] him because if one man was causing the
[1:54:34] problem one man needed to be dealt with
[1:54:38] but instead it was brought to the
[1:54:39] congregation and not only adopted by the
[1:54:42] brandom Tabernacle but by hundreds of
[1:54:44] churches around the
[1:54:48] world and I wonder wonder if they know
[1:54:50] that they're doing that because of one
[1:54:54] man one gift that couldn't find its
[1:54:59] place and I'll tell you what I even know
[1:55:01] some of what the gift was saying he was
[1:55:05] uh telling brother brandom who wasn't
[1:55:07] even in the building where to go
[1:55:13] next they kept having problems with him
[1:55:16] and several others from time to time
[1:55:18] directing brother br to what city they
[1:55:21] thought he should go to next so people
[1:55:23] were literally coming from other cities
[1:55:25] I'm glad they love their
[1:55:28] City daring to stand up and say I the
[1:55:31] word of the Lord unto you is come to
[1:55:34] whever I
[1:55:37] live so that had to be dealt with now it
[1:55:41] was dealt with so extremely I didn't
[1:55:44] mess up I chose my word carefully it was
[1:55:48] dealt with so extremely that a whole
[1:55:51] generation of people have grown up
[1:55:52] around this truth that have never seen a
[1:55:55] a a real moving of the gifts of the
[1:55:59] Spirit I mean real the real the real not
[1:56:02] just exhortation in the spirit God
[1:56:04] reminding you of who he is in quoting
[1:56:07] scripture I mean real prophetic
[1:56:10] utterance yes sir we've seen that we've
[1:56:14] had periods of that we thank God for it
[1:56:17] we didn't ever intend for it to be our
[1:56:19] Focus
[1:56:20] we focus on him but when he
[1:56:24] comes he brings more than the anointing
[1:56:26] to
[1:56:27] preach oh yeah I need you to help
[1:56:31] me we must you we mustn't come to just
[1:56:34] put on a religious act my goodness I've
[1:56:36] been preaching an hour and I'm on page
[1:56:39] one we we mustn't just come to put on a
[1:56:42] religious act to go to church we must
[1:56:44] come to worship
[1:56:46] how trth in spirit and in truth it's
[1:56:49] Jesus said the time will come yes sir we
[1:56:52] must be deeply and sincerely we must
[1:56:56] really mean what we're coming here
[1:57:01] for the days are getting evil the time
[1:57:05] is evil and we want to make every minute
[1:57:11] count and
[1:57:13] especially when we're in the house of
[1:57:18] the Lord so you don't get an off
[1:57:24] Sunday you don't get to C and limit your
[1:57:28] response like how rough your week
[1:57:32] was cuz you didn't come to praise God
[1:57:34] for a good
[1:57:36] week last week you came to praise a good
[1:57:41] God the truth is he's good when you have
[1:57:44] a good week he's good when you have a
[1:57:45] bad week he's still good he's still God
[1:57:48] he deserves of Praise I've even told you
[1:57:51] all when you knock down drag out with
[1:57:54] your
[1:57:55] wife all the way to church
[1:57:59] yeah you turn to her and say honey we'll
[1:58:02] get this ironed out and repented of and
[1:58:03] made right in a little while but I'm
[1:58:05] going in there to praise the Lord and
[1:58:09] I'm not going to judge your praise I'm
[1:58:10] asking you not to judge mine I may not
[1:58:13] be worthy to praise him because I
[1:58:15] haven't yet repented of my hateful
[1:58:17] attitude toward you the love of my my
[1:58:19] life but I'm going to praise him because
[1:58:22] he's
[1:58:24] worthy come on
[1:58:26] now preacher step on your toes so the
[1:58:29] next service you come in all bound
[1:58:33] up you didn't get recognize you did
[1:58:36] something and didn't get thanked enough
[1:58:37] for it which I know happens all the time
[1:58:40] around here because I don't make enough
[1:58:43] notes and you let that affect the way
[1:58:46] you praise you you're not entering into
[1:58:49] anything come on now you're missing out
[1:58:52] don't you do that don't waste a service
[1:58:54] we want to make every minute count and
[1:58:57] especially when we're in the house of
[1:58:59] the Lord we want to praise until the
[1:59:01] spirit of worship comes worship until
[1:59:03] the glory comes then stand in the
[1:59:08] glory I think I may have another
[1:59:13] quotation but if we want to experience
[1:59:16] deep
[1:59:18] worship we need vibrant praise
[1:59:24] first if we have vibrant praise then
[1:59:28] we'll
[1:59:33] have I love that because it is really so
[1:59:36] opposite of what people
[1:59:39] think in the glory book sister Ruth
[1:59:42] talks about uh the Chicken and the Egg
[1:59:45] thing you know which came first the
[1:59:48] chicken or the egg she you said some
[1:59:49] people can never agree do do we go
[1:59:52] higher to go deeper or do we go deeper
[1:59:54] to go higher did you follow
[1:59:58] that and she said in my opinion and I
[2:00:00] want to say I 100% agree we go higher to
[2:00:04] go
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:07] deeper we ascended to Wade through the
[2:00:12] depths we don't go deep so we can go
[2:00:15] high we go high so that we can go deep
[2:00:18] we're talking spiritual now in the
[2:00:20] natural we go low in humility so that we
[2:00:24] can go
[2:00:26] high in God's Authority but in the
[2:00:30] spirit we worship we praise with high
[2:00:33] praises let the high praises of God we
[2:00:36] have vibrant praise if we have vibrant
[2:00:39] praise then we'll have deep
[2:00:41] worship and we'll have the fullness of
[2:00:44] the glory of God
[2:00:47] manifested oh oh
[2:00:50] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah maybe I
[2:00:53] should just share here because some of
[2:00:55] you were not listening Tuesday night and
[2:00:58] you may wonder why I'm quoting from a
[2:01:02] woman she was a missionary to the
[2:01:05] Nations I never heard her
[2:01:08] name really her her work was praise and
[2:01:16] worship she had a a unique ability
[2:01:19] raised in a in in a in a true
[2:01:23] Pentecostal Holiness
[2:01:25] home
[2:01:27] grandparents she was a direct descendant
[2:01:29] of Jonathan
[2:01:31] Edwards she had grandparents that were
[2:01:33] in the oldtime ways of Pentecost parents
[2:01:36] that were in the oldtime ways of
[2:01:38] Pentecost she never married so she
[2:01:41] didn't have any children to leave behind
[2:01:44] her brother was an amazing
[2:01:48] man her uncle was one of my favorite one
[2:01:51] of the favorite men of my whole life
[2:01:54] that I've ever met in my life and how
[2:01:57] did you even know I never met them never
[2:01:59] heard their name we certainly didn't
[2:02:01] Worship in the same circles years ago
[2:02:03] and we didn't certainly after coming to
[2:02:05] the message you know when we're just not
[2:02:07] allowed to like anybody else or have any
[2:02:09] confidence in anybody
[2:02:14] else I'm I'm surprised sometime but you
[2:02:16] know we hear people talk about they
[2:02:18] burned all their tapes and uh all the
[2:02:20] tapes they had of other preachers and
[2:02:22] any they had they thr out well look
[2:02:24] folks I want to tell you something
[2:02:25] you're ignoring the very message you say
[2:02:27] you believe cuz even brother brandom
[2:02:30] tells us you don't throw the whole pie
[2:02:32] out you need the Holy Ghost to let you
[2:02:34] know what's truth and not trueu but you
[2:02:36] spit the seat out it's not going to hurt
[2:02:39] you now if you start hanging out in that
[2:02:42] more than you do in this revealed word
[2:02:44] you're going to get out of balance and
[2:02:45] it's going to cost you
[2:02:47] something
[2:02:51] hello you see the way I feel is these
[2:02:53] churches were taking a bigger risk
[2:02:55] inviting me to come for 10 years than I
[2:02:59] was taking by accepting the
[2:03:01] invitation was I just went and did my
[2:03:03] own thing I did exactly what I felt like
[2:03:06] God was calling me to do if it bankrupt
[2:03:11] hell hair lip the devil then I knew I
[2:03:15] didn't have to ever go back
[2:03:17] again I knew many times before I finish
[2:03:21] my message that would be the last one I
[2:03:22] would be
[2:03:24] delivering so in that moment you just
[2:03:26] switch right down to low gear and give
[2:03:28] it everything you got all at one time
[2:03:31] tell it
[2:03:34] all I stood in in in conferences of
[2:03:37] 5,000 people and said if you're not
[2:03:39] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:41] Christ you are Catholic you've been
[2:03:43] baptized under a Catholic Doctrine and
[2:03:45] you need to go to the river the water
[2:03:47] the bapt and be baptized in the name of
[2:03:49] the Lord Jesus Christ in a trinitarian
[2:03:52] conference hosted by trinitarian
[2:03:56] church now maybe I was invited there in
[2:03:59] hopes that I would say what they wanted
[2:04:01] me to
[2:04:02] say but since I didn't ask them what
[2:04:04] they wanted me to
[2:04:06] say and most of the time if I if I
[2:04:09] veered to to the Comfort Zone it would
[2:04:12] be like I told you the other day they
[2:04:13] would ask me I thought you were going to
[2:04:14] talk about the ministry of brother
[2:04:16] brandham William
[2:04:17] brandham oh oh you really want me to
[2:04:23] yes so I never heard the name Hein or
[2:04:32] Ward there was a mobile home that used
[2:04:34] to sit right here where the church is
[2:04:36] and I had an office in that mobile home
[2:04:38] because we didn't have a church building
[2:04:40] here and I needed an office on the
[2:04:41] campground and most of the time it was
[2:04:44] some a place for people to stay the
[2:04:47] other end
[2:04:49] or some preacher to stay in and then Rob
[2:04:51] Us
[2:04:52] blind that only happened twice but
[2:04:55] anyway moving right
[2:04:59] along good gravy that's
[2:05:02] right anyway hallelujah praise the
[2:05:10] Lord one day I'm in the back of that
[2:05:13] trailer in the top of the closet moving
[2:05:15] a box of books
[2:05:17] magazines
[2:05:19] and I always don't kill me don't Stone
[2:05:23] me but for years I subscribed to
[2:05:25] Charisma
[2:05:27] magazine because I enjoyed reading about
[2:05:30] what was going on in the Pentecostal
[2:05:31] charismatic
[2:05:33] World whether I wanted to turn around
[2:05:35] and preach against it or whether I
[2:05:37] wanted to dig deeper into it I liked
[2:05:40] reading and I liked having the research
[2:05:43] and information at my hands I was told
[2:05:46] many times to throw them old magazines
[2:05:47] away they were just taking up space but
[2:05:49] I didn't
[2:05:52] listen I brought them over
[2:05:57] here one day in prayer the Lord shows me
[2:06:00] a woman's face as clear as a day she
[2:06:04] reminded me of my
[2:06:07] grandmother she had her hair teased and
[2:06:10] up in a holy
[2:06:12] haird might had a little color in it but
[2:06:17] anyway and God said I want I'm going to
[2:06:20] give you a word for her and I'm going to
[2:06:22] give her a word for you I said Thank You
[2:06:26] Lord but I don't know who that woman is
[2:06:29] far as I know I've never seen her in my
[2:06:34] life sometime later don't know exactly
[2:06:37] how long not too long maybe days I don't
[2:06:40] I don't recall forgive me I go to pull
[2:06:43] that box of books magazines down off the
[2:06:46] top shelf and when I do one slides off
[2:06:48] the
[2:06:51] top
[2:06:53] Hallelujah and when it landed on the
[2:06:55] floor it opened
[2:06:56] up to a particular page and there she
[2:07:00] was in the Charisma and it was a it was
[2:07:04] an
[2:07:05] invitation to the camp meeting being
[2:07:07] held at Calvary Pentecostal church or
[2:07:10] Tabernacle in Ashland
[2:07:14] Virginia and I saw her there and I
[2:07:17] grabbed that up so quick
[2:07:19] and I looked at it and I said all right
[2:07:21] now I know her
[2:07:22] name and now I've got to find out how to
[2:07:25] get to her the Lord had never yet given
[2:07:28] me the word for her he just said I will
[2:07:30] and I'll give her one for you and if I
[2:07:33] would have been as staunch as some folks
[2:07:35] I would have said well I have the word I
[2:07:37] have the message I have the truth I
[2:07:39] don't need a word from the
[2:07:42] Lord cuz I've got it all now come on but
[2:07:46] I'm not that person I wasn't then and
[2:07:48] I'm not
[2:07:50] now if God wants to use somebody to
[2:07:52] speak to me I want him to do it and if
[2:07:54] he can't find anybody in the message to
[2:07:57] give me a word because they're preaching
[2:07:59] against
[2:08:00] it right I've heard it recently they
[2:08:04] they're calling prophecy uh uh instead
[2:08:07] of prophesying they're calling it
[2:08:09] prophal
[2:08:11] lying and there may be many who
[2:08:14] propal but that doesn't mean that all
[2:08:17] propal anybody following me
[2:08:21] now I was ready to hear whatever the
[2:08:24] Lord had so I go to my desk at the
[2:08:26] office at the church in
[2:08:29] Columbus I also had a desk there and I
[2:08:31] called one day one
[2:08:36] winter might have been about this time
[2:08:39] of
[2:08:41] year and a and a and a sister from the
[2:08:45] islands answers the
[2:08:47] phone
[2:08:49] what was her name honey Mason it just
[2:08:52] slipped my
[2:08:53] mind sometimes you will see her often
[2:08:57] comment on social media something that I
[2:08:59] write something that I post a picture of
[2:09:01] the family or something you'll see
[2:09:03] sister Mason will comment to this day
[2:09:05] because she knows for a moment in our
[2:09:08] lives God connected us for a
[2:09:11] reason and I said uh sister I'm calling
[2:09:14] for information about the camp the
[2:09:16] Winter Camp that's going on about about
[2:09:18] to start and I would like to come
[2:09:21] up
[2:09:23] and uh I believe the Lord has dealt with
[2:09:26] my heart that I need to come and I'd
[2:09:29] like to meet this sister
[2:09:31] Ruth and uh I but I I have some
[2:09:37] concerns and and I said I I'm I'm sort
[2:09:40] of
[2:09:41] sheltered and and I don't get out too
[2:09:44] much among other groups and camps and I
[2:09:46] didn't in those days little did I know
[2:09:49] that God was about to put me
[2:09:51] there and and I said I don't know how to
[2:09:54] ask
[2:09:55] this so I just spit it out she said all
[2:09:58] right brother that's what I want you to
[2:10:00] do I said do you all have any men
[2:10:05] preachers that come out of my mouth she
[2:10:08] said oh yes yes yes and she began to
[2:10:11] name the brothers off and I said well
[2:10:13] good I I I'm just not real big on women
[2:10:17] preacher but I love my granny was a
[2:10:20] woman preacher and I love I love women
[2:10:23] who dedicated their lives to the Lord
[2:10:25] but I I worry about the biblical you
[2:10:28] know I worry about the scripture on that
[2:10:30] and I just want to know oh she said you
[2:10:33] you will find a variety of you will oh
[2:10:37] she said
[2:10:39] I I uh I I

[2:11:05] power let the river
[2:11:09] flow let the river
[2:11:13] flow
[2:11:15] let the riv ever flow and I thought she
[2:11:20] was coming to an end of the song and
[2:11:22] then she said
[2:11:25] let that was days of long
[2:11:28] distance let the river

[2:11:36] good chance to sing it with me Holy

[2:12:05] sung it to
[2:12:07] me but when she came to the end of that
[2:12:10] she said brother I'm seeing a
[2:12:16] vision I'm so glad I was open to
[2:12:21] that she said I'm seeing a
[2:12:27] vision she said it's just like that
[2:12:29] little
[2:12:30] pot of
[2:12:32] pansies on the corner of your
[2:12:38] desk I thought to myself I don't have
[2:12:41] any pansies there's no windows in my
[2:12:45] office I don't have any pansies in my
[2:12:47] desk and this is a TR on my desk
[2:12:49] literally I
[2:12:55] go sitting on my the corner of my desk
[2:12:59] sister Isabelle
[2:13:01] weams had potted a little pot of pansies
[2:13:06] they were my grandfather's favorite
[2:13:08] flower I've always said they were my
[2:13:11] favorite flower and I've mentioned in
[2:13:14] visitations to other places in the
[2:13:16] spirit especially Heavenly places I've
[2:13:19] seen pansies there in in in
[2:13:24] multitudes and what looks like a little
[2:13:27] face to you in in eternity was a
[2:13:30] face and it turned every one of them
[2:13:32] turned as I walked
[2:13:34] by now you don't forget that you have an
[2:13:38] experience like that that even the
[2:13:39] flowers watch you I know some of you
[2:13:42] watching this I know I'm giving you all
[2:13:44] more fod more ammunition
[2:13:51] but I'm telling how it
[2:13:54] happened and so in the in the in the
[2:13:56] cold
[2:13:58] weather you know pans is a flower that
[2:14:00] can go all the way through the winter
[2:14:03] sister weams had potted up a little pot
[2:14:05] of pansies and she sat it by my seat and
[2:14:09] Stacy seat for a luncheon that we had
[2:14:13] had on the Sunday before she sat that
[2:14:15] little pot of pansies there for
[2:14:17] decoration and she knew that I love the
[2:14:19] flower and
[2:14:21] she had carried them up after the lunch
[2:14:24] and and and sat them there on the corner
[2:14:26] of my desk and I didn't even really
[2:14:28] realize they were
[2:14:30] there until sister Mason saw them in the
[2:14:36] spirit she you some things you can make
[2:14:39] up and fix up
[2:14:41] speculate some things you
[2:14:44] can't we didn't have no you know what
[2:14:47] what do they call
[2:14:50] it
[2:14:52] FaceTime we we
[2:14:55] had
[2:14:57] handheld phones that plugged in the
[2:15:00] wall and she said you're like that
[2:15:03] little p now every man wants to be
[2:15:05] called a pansy in the
[2:15:09] spirit when I finally got to meet her I
[2:15:11] said I want to thank you so much you
[2:15:14] really boosted my manhood by by calling
[2:15:17] me a
[2:15:20] pansy she just
[2:15:23] cackled she said you know you're like
[2:15:26] that pansy in that little pot there on
[2:15:28] the corner she said I see you all frozen
[2:15:32] over in the winter your head just bowed
[2:15:36] down but she said I know what happens
[2:15:40] when the sun comes out and if you've
[2:15:42] ever grew penies like I have you know it
[2:15:44] it's true you can see them all froze up
[2:15:47] sickles hanging down from the face of
[2:15:50] that but you let the sun come out give
[2:15:52] them a little while
[2:15:53] Hallelujah and they just raise up their
[2:15:56] little heads and turn right toward she
[2:15:58] said I see God about to do that for
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:02] you he's going to throw you
[2:16:06] out and he's going to turn your face
[2:16:09] toward the Sun and I don't know what
[2:16:11] else she said but I know one thing I
[2:16:15] didn't care in that moment please don't
[2:16:17] cut the out I didn't care in that moment
[2:16:20] if everybody there was a
[2:16:23] woman I wanted to go see what that place
[2:16:25] was about so I can't go into all the
[2:16:28] story but it's
[2:16:30] big it's big what God did there were
[2:16:35] people there of every
[2:16:37] variety no
[2:16:39] Holiness that first night I got there I
[2:16:42] couldn't find any sister Ruth wasn't in
[2:16:44] the building and the leaders weren't in
[2:16:46] the building and I thought I saw people
[2:16:48] you know I thought oh my
[2:16:51] oh Lord as if I hadn't already known
[2:16:54] strange
[2:16:57] people these are some of the strangest
[2:16:59] people I've ever seen in my life there
[2:17:00] was a brother praying and he was doing
[2:17:01] like this with his hair while he prayed
[2:17:04] I thought oh
[2:17:06] Lord help
[2:17:10] us I actually went to a morning service
[2:17:13] afternoon service and wouldn't take my
[2:17:16] wife I said you stay here at the hotel
[2:17:19] and rest I have no idea what I'm going
[2:17:20] to get into over
[2:17:22] there you stay here she said all right I
[2:17:26] decided to let her go with me that night
[2:17:27] and that's when the man was doing like
[2:17:31] that we sat in the back and all this is
[2:17:35] the truth before God they were talking
[2:17:37] rudest bunch of
[2:17:39] folks like some of you all after a
[2:17:42] service when you do all your talking in
[2:17:45] here instead of out there
[2:17:48] see how quiet it gets when you resemble
[2:17:51] the remark do you see how quiet you get
[2:17:55] that's a pastor's uh life they were
[2:17:59] talking I mean talking loud before the
[2:18:03] service started loud going around oh I
[2:18:06] hadn't seen you in so long and I thought
[2:18:09] how could how could anybody make sacred
[2:18:12] the atmosphere of this room with these
[2:18:15] people carrying on like Hicks off the
[2:18:18] farmyard I mean I am in the seat of the
[2:18:23] scornful and all of a sudden God be my
[2:18:26] witness AC hundreds of
[2:18:29] people and across that
[2:18:31] Auditorium there come a shift right over
[2:18:35] the
[2:18:36] building I must have not been the only
[2:18:39] one who felt it because everybody in the
[2:18:42] room went
[2:18:43] Silent not a person talking and two
[2:18:48] sisters walked in the back door I didn't
[2:18:49] know either one of them at the time they
[2:18:52] looked
[2:18:54] theart they had their hair up on their
[2:18:56] heads they were dressed in sleeves and
[2:18:59] long clothes and fur
[2:19:03] coats it was
[2:19:06] cold they looked like something out of a
[2:19:08] book I'd never seen them
[2:19:11] before they looked like they had just
[2:19:13] stepped out of some history book or
[2:19:15] something and they come walking down the
[2:19:17] Isis and I'm telling you
[2:19:21] woo the presence of God was so real it
[2:19:25] was hanging on them like
[2:19:27] [Music]
[2:19:31] perfume they didn't greet anybody but my
[2:19:34] wife and
[2:19:36] I they turned to us and they greeted us
[2:19:40] both and one of those sisters kissed me
[2:19:43] on my
[2:19:45] cheek and I melted
[2:19:50] they were both in their
[2:19:53] 70s and all I could look up and see was
[2:19:55] my gray-haired
[2:19:58] granny kissing me on the cheek and I
[2:20:01] sobbed oh I know there'll be somebody
[2:20:03] say something about that but it it
[2:20:06] melted all the
[2:20:08] anxiety and all the fish out of water
[2:20:11] feeling that I'd been dealing with and
[2:20:14] they walked right on down greeted us
[2:20:15] both and walked right down The Isle and
[2:20:17] sat on the front row on the same side of
[2:20:20] the building that we were in and from
[2:20:22] that moment until the service started
[2:20:25] there was a presence in that room that
[2:20:28] was just
[2:20:30] profound
[2:20:32] profound in a few minutes there were
[2:20:34] some leadership begin to come in and and
[2:20:36] they were
[2:20:38] Holiness and although there were many
[2:20:40] people there who were not these the
[2:20:42] leadership brother Jackson and several
[2:20:44] of the others Darlene and so many of the
[2:20:47] others came in and played the music
[2:20:50] Michelle Acres was there and she played
[2:20:53] the music and there was such a
[2:20:56] presence and in the middle of worship
[2:20:58] sister Ruth and that whole big crowd of
[2:21:02] people sister Ruth came to the to the
[2:21:06] pull pit and she looked back in our
[2:21:07] Direction in the middle of worship in
[2:21:09] fact just to be honest she took little
[2:21:12] brother Jackson who was leading the
[2:21:14] worship you know he was up there singing
[2:21:15] a song or whatever she just took her
[2:21:16] hand ped him on the side and just moved
[2:21:18] him out of the
[2:21:20] way and she stepped up and she said
[2:21:22] little
[2:21:23] brother I'm not little maybe next to her
[2:21:27] I was a little bit
[2:21:30] but I want to talk to
[2:21:33] you she said I see you in the
[2:21:37] river remember let the river
[2:21:41] flow but she said you've been in a
[2:21:43] basket like
[2:21:46] Moses and God has protected you for many
[2:21:51] years but he is about to take you out of
[2:21:54] that basket and plunge you into the
[2:21:57] depths of the Spirit River and you're
[2:21:59] going to know him in ways you have never
[2:22:02] known him before and experience him in
[2:22:05] ways you have never experienced him
[2:22:09] before and I
[2:22:11] did and the history rolls on and I ended
[2:22:14] up preaching there at the summer camp
[2:22:17] and having many conversations on the
[2:22:19] phone and and I was able to give sister
[2:22:22] Ruth the word the word for her was set
[2:22:24] your Affairs in order he's coming to
[2:22:26] take you home her word was the one I
[2:22:29] just mentioned and several others that
[2:22:31] she gave me over the course of times as
[2:22:34] as often as I could get to where those
[2:22:36] meetings were going I wanted to go I
[2:22:38] didn't forsake the message I didn't quit
[2:22:41] believing the prophet I didn't quit
[2:22:43] preaching the message I just experienced
[2:22:46] a refreshing
[2:22:48] that brought a refreshing to this church
[2:22:51] body and plunged us into years of
[2:22:57] Revival and they were coming off the
[2:22:59] streets brother Shaw to
[2:23:02] experience what God was doing in the
[2:23:04] house now I know there's es and flows
[2:23:07] and seasons of
[2:23:09] things but I believe that in all of that
[2:23:12] experience two years of Fellowship until
[2:23:16] the Lord took
[2:23:17] her and when I heard the news that she
[2:23:20] had passed away I was crushed I cried
[2:23:23] like a
[2:23:24] baby I was like losing my grandmother
[2:23:27] all
[2:23:28] again I had bought her a dress for
[2:23:32] Mother's Day because I couldn't do that
[2:23:35] for my granny anymore so I sent her a
[2:23:37] check and said please buy a dress for
[2:23:40] Mother's Day Stacy and I want to bless
[2:23:43] you and it was the dress that she was
[2:23:45] buried in but I didn't know that I
[2:23:48] didn't know what we were
[2:23:50] doing when I went there they had
[2:23:54] 24hour testimony service for three days
[2:23:58] before her burial people came from all
[2:24:01] over the world and they stood under the
[2:24:04] t under the Tabernacle and testified of
[2:24:07] of what they saw in those meetings all
[2:24:10] over the world God sent her to Hal
[2:24:12] salasi the Emperor of Ethiopia twice to
[2:24:15] give him a word of the Lord
[2:24:19] I don't understand all of that but what
[2:24:22] I do understand is you can do a lot for
[2:24:25] God you can do God a service and not be
[2:24:27] in the center of his will and you know
[2:24:30] what my reaction to that is if she could
[2:24:32] be used of God out of his will like
[2:24:36] that come on what is my excuse come
[2:24:41] on sir yes
[2:24:44] sir if I carry anything out of those
[2:24:47] years and there were many
[2:24:50] connections remember it was Sister Nancy
[2:24:52] who represented her Ministry in Israel
[2:24:55] that opened their door for us in 2002
[2:24:58] and she ended up stepping down out of
[2:25:00] the ministry flying from Jerusalem here
[2:25:02] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:25:04] Jesus Christ and open the doors for us
[2:25:06] to go and baptize hundreds of people in
[2:25:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ while
[2:25:12] while spending time in Israel so I could
[2:25:15] go on and on and on about the
[2:25:17] connections but but I'm going to say
[2:25:18] like brother green did he said the most
[2:25:21] important advice brother brother brandom
[2:25:23] ever gave me was keep your balance in
[2:25:25] the scripture I'm going to say the most
[2:25:27] valuable thing that I think we could
[2:25:29] carry away from our association for
[2:25:32] those two years of time is
[2:25:35] praise until the spirit of worship comes
[2:25:40] and then worship until the glory comes
[2:25:44] and then stand in the glory
[2:25:51] I want you to look at Psalm It's 121 I
[2:25:55] want you to look at Psalm
[2:25:57] 24 verse 1-10 the Earth is the
[2:26:00] Lord's did I leave anything out honey
[2:26:02] that I should have put in
[2:26:08] that I could say
[2:26:12] that I never saw the
[2:26:15] highes as excited as they
[2:26:18] were when God sent me there that weekend
[2:26:21] and they didn't know why they couldn't
[2:26:22] figure out why they were so excited but
[2:26:24] they were so excited they called me
[2:26:25] three times while I was there I wouldn't
[2:26:28] scream cuz I was
[2:26:30] busy but they were so excited they
[2:26:33] wanted to know everything that happened
[2:26:34] they give me
[2:26:36] $100 to go several people did and they
[2:26:39] wanted to know everything that was
[2:26:40] happening and come to find out her
[2:26:42] Hebrew teacher was their Hebrew teacher
[2:26:44] and boy that just sent them over the
[2:26:46] moon
[2:26:50] it connected us to Israel a place that
[2:26:53] they love so dearly and it spent some
[2:26:54] time living there in the land anyway it
[2:26:57] goes on the earth is the Lord's and the
[2:27:00] I hope I didn't lose you I'm not quite
[2:27:02] done yet the Earth is the Lords and the
[2:27:05] fullness thereof the world and they that
[2:27:07] dwell
[2:27:08] therein for he ha founded it upon the
[2:27:11] Seas and established it upon the floods

[2:27:16] Lord or who shall stand in his holy
[2:27:19] place he that hath Clean Hands and a
[2:27:22] pure heart who have not lifted up his
[2:27:24] soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully
[2:27:28] he shall receive the blessing from the
[2:27:30] Lord and righteousness from the god of
[2:27:33] his salvation oh that's beautiful this
[2:27:36] is the generation of them that seek him

[2:30:34] there to speak well
[2:30:40] of to
[2:30:42] compliment to command to applaud
[2:30:47] to
[2:30:49] extol I want you to understand and I I'm
[2:30:52] going to close in a moment on page
[2:30:56] three I'm not quite on page three
[2:30:59] heading
[2:31:01] there we weren't sure if charity would
[2:31:04] be able to be here today she's been
[2:31:07] fighting
[2:31:08] something and Mariah ask on the way and
[2:31:11] she doesn't like putting it in it's a
[2:31:12] lot of work and and and she's afraid
[2:31:14] she's going to make a mistake and
[2:31:17] we we didn't think maybe chy would be
[2:31:19] here so Mariah asked on the way she said
[2:31:20] daddy do you have a lot of notes
[2:31:23] today I said only 14 pages for
[2:31:28] you 23 Pages for me but only 14 for you
[2:31:32] she said
[2:31:37] oh we know praise as a Prelude to a good
[2:31:44] service but I want you to know that that
[2:31:46] praise is a powerful instrument for
[2:31:50] Harvest we don't just praise to get the
[2:31:52] right feeling in the
[2:31:55] room sometimes we praise as preparation
[2:31:59] for harvesting what has been
[2:32:02] sown many times we long to hear his
[2:32:06] voice but in the song of songs the
[2:32:09] bridegroom says to the bride I want to
[2:32:12] see your
[2:32:14] face I want to hear your
[2:32:17] voice Face
[2:32:19] First Voice
[2:32:22] next I don't want to just hear I want to
[2:32:25] seek your face I want to see your
[2:32:27] face then I want to hear your voice God
[2:32:30] has given us a voice to be lifted up in
[2:32:32] praise to him if we have nothing else to
[2:32:35] offer him we have a
[2:32:37] voice there's a liberty that comes from
[2:32:40] putting your praise into audible words
[2:32:43] God wants to hear your voice speak your
[2:32:46] praise God wants to hear your voice sing
[2:32:49] your praise it releases the river of God
[2:32:53] to flow out of you as you open your
[2:32:55] mouth and begin to declare the goodness
[2:32:57] of the Lord in the land of the living
[2:33:00] declaring the Miracles of the Lord
[2:33:02] declaring the healing of the Lord
[2:33:04] declaring the victory of the Lord
[2:33:06] declaring the newness of the Lord using
[2:33:09] your voice as a trumpet sounding forth
[2:33:12] the
[2:33:13] blessings of the Lord the more you
[2:33:16] declare His blessings the more you'll
[2:33:19] have to declare the more you speak about
[2:33:22] his goodness the more you'll have to
[2:33:25] speak about his goodness Psalm 891 I
[2:33:30] will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[2:33:36] forever my Not My Thoughts come on with
[2:33:40] my mouth will I make known Thy
[2:33:43] Faithfulness help me to all generations
[2:33:48] amen there's a teaching floating around
[2:33:50] that praise is for the immature but
[2:33:53] intercession is for those that are
[2:33:55] spiritual you can read that in the glory
[2:33:59] book praise is for the immature but
[2:34:02] intercession is for those that are
[2:34:03] spiritual that couldn't be anything
[2:34:05] farther from the
[2:34:07] truth in Revelation one of the great
[2:34:09] praise books of the Bible in reality the
[2:34:12] praise and worship book of heaven we
[2:34:14] read this in re 195 and 6 and a voice
[2:34:19] came out of the throne saying praise our
[2:34:22] God all ye his servants and ye that fear
[2:34:25] Him both small and great and I heard as
[2:34:28] it were the voice of a great multitude
[2:34:30] and as the voice of many Waters and as
[2:34:33] the voice of many thundering saying
[2:34:35] hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[2:34:39] reth
[2:34:42] amen notice where the voice is coming
[2:34:45] from notice what the voice is saying
[2:34:48] it's almost a
[2:34:50] paradox when you hear anyone saying that
[2:34:54] praise is
[2:34:55] shallow you know that they need a deeper
[2:34:57] revelation of what praise really is you
[2:35:01] hear somebody calling praise part of the
[2:35:05] shook you know they don't understand
[2:35:08] what they claim to
[2:35:09] Believe come on you hear them saying
[2:35:12] that true Pentecost is part of the shook
[2:35:15] you'll know they don't understand what
[2:35:16] they've listened to right the only part
[2:35:19] of the shuck that Pentecost has anything
[2:35:21] to do with is the domination of
[2:35:25] Pentecost when brother brandom is
[2:35:27] talking about the truth of the church
[2:35:28] ages he tells us you you leave behind
[2:35:30] the fanaticism of the age before and you
[2:35:33] bring the truth over as each of the
[2:35:35] messengers did that they brought the
[2:35:37] truth of the prior age over into the
[2:35:39] next age so for them to tell you then by
[2:35:42] isolated Church age Book
[2:35:44] quote that what what work then won't
[2:35:47] work
[2:35:51] now right the F of that the Folly of
[2:35:55] that the Flesh of
[2:35:57] that the denominational structure and
[2:36:00] mindset of that will not work over here
[2:36:04] but we bring the truth of every age
[2:36:06] otherwise it's not a restoration of a
[2:36:08] brid
[2:36:10] tree if it's restoration of a brid Tre
[2:36:13] you bring the truth of every age and you
[2:36:14] start building the tree back Luther
[2:36:17] justification Wesley sanctification and
[2:36:20] notice brother Ram did not play a role
[2:36:22] in
[2:36:23] this because he simply said and
[2:36:28] Pentecost which preceded his ministry
[2:36:32] yes it was justification sanctification
[2:36:36] and baptism of the Holy Ghost and for
[2:36:39] you to tell me that nobody had the Holy
[2:36:41] Ghost until his ministry began you'd be
[2:36:43] out of the word and out of History
[2:36:46] that wasn't his
[2:36:48] role we have to be very careful in the
[2:36:50] balance because we can't have an eighth
[2:36:53] messenger and under the seventh age
[2:36:55] Pentecost was
[2:36:59] restored so we got to be real careful
[2:37:01] how we slant that or we may slant him
[2:37:04] right out of the word we might slant the
[2:37:05] message right out of its
[2:37:07] significance if we don't let it find its
[2:37:10] balance in the
[2:37:12] scripture the greatest Instrument of
[2:37:14] Praise that God has given you as your
[2:37:16] voice learn to lift it up to him we have
[2:37:20] discovered that not only did praise
[2:37:22] Delight Our God as he desired more of it
[2:37:24] but that he also liked it
[2:37:30] louder because he tells us to lift up
[2:37:32] Lift Up Lift Up Lift Up Lift up somebody
[2:37:35] said well I think he's just talking
[2:37:36] about where you send your
[2:37:41] praise then what did he mean when he
[2:37:43] said praise him with a loud voice
[2:37:47] he tells us to praise with the voice of
[2:37:48] Thanksgiving Psalm 267 write this down
[2:37:51] it's not on a slide he tells us to
[2:37:54] praise with the voice of Thanksgiving
[2:37:56] Psalm 267 he tells us to praise with the
[2:37:58] voice of Triumph Psalm 471 he tells us
[2:38:02] to praise with the voice of a Psalm
[2:38:04] Psalm 985 and he tells us to praise with
[2:38:07] the voice of rejoicing Psalm
[2:38:10] 1815 he keeps telling us over and over
[2:38:12] again how important the voice is got a
[2:38:15] little more to get in here the voice
[2:38:18] that John heard was the voice of a great
[2:38:20] multitude the voice as of many Waters
[2:38:23] and the voice of many mighty
[2:38:26] thunderings Our Praise Rises until it
[2:38:29] thunders like
[2:38:31] Niagara or Livingston
[2:38:40] Falls what was coming out of the
[2:38:44] throne the voice of a great multitude
[2:38:48] the voice as of many Waters the voice of
[2:38:50] Mighty thunderings is that right is that
[2:38:53] what it says our praise Rises until it
[2:38:56] thunders like Niagara or Livingston
[2:38:58] Falls so great are the rushing sounds of
[2:39:00] the joining together of voice to voice
[2:39:03] it rises until it reaches a level of
[2:39:05] Mighty thunderings going forth in praise
[2:39:08] and adoration to The God Who has
[2:39:11] delivered us now watch this very close
[2:39:14] and I'm done
[2:39:16] Hosea chapter 2 verse 19-23 let's go
[2:39:20] there and I will betro thee unto me
[2:39:24] forever yay I will betro thee unto me in
[2:39:28] righteousness and in judgment and in
[2:39:31] loving kindness and in mercies are you
[2:39:34] following me I will even betroth thee
[2:39:37] unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt
[2:39:40] know the
[2:39:42] Lord I assure thee you I assure assure
[2:39:45] you this is not by
[2:39:47] information that you will know the Lord
[2:39:51] this is by intimacy and Revelation you
[2:39:53] don't know the Lord by reading about him
[2:39:55] only you know the Lord by experiencing
[2:39:57] him you will come to know the Lord by
[2:39:59] encountering him you will come to know
[2:40:02] the Lord by meeting him not just by
[2:40:05] reading about him is that
[2:40:07] right let's go on verse 21 and it shall
[2:40:11] come to pass in that day I will hear

[2:45:09] sewing Praise You may not only affect
[2:45:11] the atmosphere of this room or this
[2:45:14] nation
[2:45:15] but by sewing praise you have the
[2:45:18] potential of affecting other regions of
[2:45:21] the world because your job is just to
[2:45:24] sew to the heaven it's up to heaven to
[2:45:26] decide where to send it
[2:45:28] back may God give you such a heartfelt
[2:45:31] praise and so many seed to sew to the
[2:45:34] heavens that you shift the atmospheres

[2:45:57] in one place and minister to the Lord
[2:46:00] and refect reflect outpourings effect
[2:46:04] outpourings to the ends of the Earth so
[2:46:07] I'm encouraging you to be faithful to
[2:46:09] sew to the heavens I'm going to tell you
[2:46:10] one more story in
[2:46:13] close this is from the glory
[2:46:17] book which is a life-changing little
[2:46:24] book nearly 50 I think in the glory book
[2:46:28] it's just 30s something but nearly 50
[2:46:31] young
[2:46:32] people heard the call of the Lord in the
[2:46:36] early
[2:46:37] 70s to leave their Pentecostal Holiness
[2:46:41] Church in Richmond Virginia and I've
[2:46:43] been I've been to the
[2:46:45] to the mother Church of this camp
[2:46:48] meeting old building I'm telling you
[2:46:51] it's like stepping back in history sits
[2:46:53] right in downtown Richmond
[2:46:55] Virginia not too far from
[2:46:58] Monument Avenue
[2:47:00] there in fact I sung on a radio
[2:47:03] broadcast that was broadcast out of that
[2:47:07] church Mr Ruth said you you preach up a
[2:47:10] storm let's see if you can
[2:47:12] sing there was no time to say no it was
[2:47:15] on the
[2:47:16] radio so I grabbed the mic and started
[2:47:18] singing thank God they could follow
[2:47:22] me in a prayer meeting one night God
[2:47:24] began to lay it on the young people's
[2:47:26] heart that he was going to send them to
[2:47:29] Jerusalem to pray for the
[2:47:32] Nations and it ended up being nearly 50
[2:47:36] who bought their tickets and cut their
[2:47:38] ties to
[2:47:40] home and caught
[2:47:42] planes I think it might have been 72 but
[2:47:45] I'm not 100% sure and they landed in
[2:47:50] Israel to find a place to
[2:47:54] stay God opened doors
[2:47:57] and they found places to
[2:48:01] stay one night they were having a prayer
[2:48:03] meeting they had prayer meetings day and
[2:48:05] night it's all they had to do they were
[2:48:07] called there to
[2:48:10] pray from Jerusalem they affected the
[2:48:12] nations of the world I have a book about
[2:48:16] that thick of
[2:48:17] testimonies that come out of the day of
[2:48:20] the years of those young people praying
[2:48:23] and God teaching them beautiful story
[2:48:26] you you know might not be interested but
[2:48:28] I
[2:48:30] was one day Catholic
[2:48:34] priests from the church of St Peter of
[2:48:38] galanto which sits right on top of Mount
[2:48:42] Zion the Mount Zion
[2:48:45] it was built over the ruins of the high
[2:48:47] priest Caiaphas his
[2:48:53] house is that also the same church where
[2:48:57] the
[2:48:59] yes where the
[2:49:02] pit where the prison pit that Jesus was
[2:49:05] kept in the night of his betrayal it's
[2:49:08] there you can go stand in the rock pit
[2:49:11] beneath that church my family's been
[2:49:13] there
[2:49:21] the Catholic priests began to hear about
[2:49:23] the prayer meetings that these
[2:49:24] Protestant young people were having over
[2:49:27] in East
[2:49:29] Jerusalem and they invited them they
[2:49:31] called them Glory sisters because there
[2:49:33] were more women than there was men and
[2:49:35] they had
[2:49:37] buns and long dresses and so they they
[2:49:40] caused quite a stir in Jerusalem because
[2:49:42] it was clear they weren't Jewish their
[2:49:44] hair was their hair was not covered or a
[2:49:46] wig as the Jews religious Jews like to
[2:49:50] do as long as it's covered either by a
[2:49:51] wig or by a scarf and these were
[2:49:54] beautiful young people who made their
[2:49:57] way through the streets of Jerusalem
[2:49:59] praying and and walking in prayer prayer
[2:50:03] walks and whatever else and the Catholic
[2:50:05] priest who oversaw the Church of St
[2:50:07] Peter of galac which is an amazing
[2:50:09] church and that that is in in it's Latin
[2:50:13] but in English it it basically means of
[2:50:16] the of the crowing of the
[2:50:18] rooster because it commemorates the
[2:50:21] place where the rooster told on Peter
[2:50:24] you know so there's a rooster on the on
[2:50:27] the top of the Spire of the church is a
[2:50:29] rooster up there reminding everybody be
[2:50:32] sure your sins will find you out the
[2:50:34] rooster will tell on you you know if you
[2:50:36] you preachers can't eat enough Fried
[2:50:38] Chicken to silence the
[2:50:42] roosters so this C Catholic Church said
[2:50:45] we don't use the church for so many
[2:50:47] hours of the day it's yours you come in
[2:50:49] and Worship the Lord and pray on Mount
[2:50:54] Zion they were scared to do it but they
[2:50:56] realized that only God could open a door
[2:51:00] there was nothing ecumenical in their
[2:51:02] agenda they they were actually terrified
[2:51:05] to do it but found out it must be the
[2:51:08] Lord and so they went but they said to
[2:51:11] the fathers fathers we need to tell you
[2:51:13] that there's a problem
[2:51:15] maybe and that is we dance when we pray
[2:51:18] in
[2:51:22] praise and they said what do you mean
[2:51:24] they said we mean what we
[2:51:27] say we
[2:51:29] dance and we don't know if you allow
[2:51:32] dancing in the none of us have been to a
[2:51:34] Catholic church and we don't know if you
[2:51:36] allow dancing and they said for the
[2:51:38] hours that you have the church you can
[2:51:40] do whatever it is you want to
[2:51:43] do including
[2:51:45] dance and before those years they were
[2:51:48] their years they met for years they
[2:51:50] didn't know how long it would last they
[2:51:51] thought maybe a few weeks it actually
[2:51:53] lasted many years that they had these
[2:51:55] daily prayer meetings in the Church of
[2:51:57] St Peter of galanto and people came Jews
[2:52:01] came and Catholics came and Protestants
[2:52:03] came from all over the world eventually
[2:52:06] to watch the dancing virgins on Zion
[2:52:09] that's what they called them because
[2:52:12] many of the prayer group were young
[2:52:14] single women who had dedicated their
[2:52:17] lives to just praying and praising in
[2:52:19] Jerusalem to affect the nations of the
[2:52:21] world it's big folks it's a big
[2:52:24] sacrifice and God so used it and so
[2:52:28] blessed but here come a brother from
[2:52:32] America and he thought this was a little
[2:52:34] waste of
[2:52:36] time and he stood up in the meeting and
[2:52:39] he said what you need to be doing is
[2:52:42] handing out tracks
[2:52:47] the way to reach Israel and the Nations
[2:52:51] is by handing out
[2:52:54] tracks sister Ruth said I could see the
[2:52:58] people getting excited and I knew in my
[2:53:01] mind that the next morning they were all
[2:53:03] going to be lined up outside the door
[2:53:06] waiting to get their
[2:53:08] tracks to go into Jerusalem and hand out
[2:53:11] tracks which would have eventually had
[2:53:13] us kicked out of the
[2:53:16] land because to proelite a Jew is
[2:53:19] against the
[2:53:20] law so if you actively reach out to try
[2:53:23] to win a Jew to to Christianity you're
[2:53:26] you're you're breaking the law of of the
[2:53:29] nation and can be
[2:53:31] persecuted and sister Ruth said I did
[2:53:34] not want to offend that brother neither
[2:53:37] did I want
[2:53:38] to
[2:53:40] squelch the enthusiasm and Zeal of the
[2:53:43] worshippers they've been so so faithful
[2:53:45] but I knew that we were not about to
[2:53:47] start marching through the streets of
[2:53:49] Jerusalem handing out paper tracks to
[2:53:52] whoever God didn't send us here to hand
[2:53:54] out tracks he sent us here to pray and
[2:53:56] praise and now to dance on Mount
[2:53:59] Zion and so she said I'm reading
[2:54:02] directly she said that night I prayed
[2:54:04] Lord give me your answer for
[2:54:08] them now remember that she was leading
[2:54:11] this prayer group and was qualified to
[2:54:13] do so because as a young
[2:54:16] girl she got on a boat and gave her life
[2:54:21] to
[2:54:25] China some of you met Gwen Shaw who was
[2:54:29] also a missionary to the world and that
[2:54:31] was the first time she ever met gwy
[2:54:33] sister Gwyn was in Hong
[2:54:37] Kong gave up
[2:54:39] everything why did God use them so
[2:54:42] because they gave up everything
[2:54:46] she gave up the love of her life because
[2:54:50] she wanted to be where God wanted her to
[2:54:52] be and she couldn't expect anybody to
[2:54:54] follow that so so she was qualified to
[2:54:56] lead this prayer meeting and she said
[2:54:58] Lord give me your answer for them and in
[2:55:01] the middle of the night the Lord spoke
[2:55:02] to me and said and this is
[2:55:04] powerful you seow to the heavens right
[2:55:07] out of the scripture you sow to the
[2:55:09] heavens and I will sow to the Earth that
[2:55:12] was the way our ministry of praise on
[2:55:14] Mount Zion was born not giving out the
[2:55:19] tracks you so to the heaven and also to
[2:55:22] the Earth and God be to pour out the
[2:55:25] Holy Ghost in prayer meetings all over
[2:55:28] the land of Israel and many of the
[2:55:31] Messianic leaders of that Nation today
[2:55:34] are the young people that were in those
[2:55:37] different prayer meetings in different
[2:55:38] places across Israel who received the
[2:55:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost and now they
[2:55:43] lead the Messianic Church the Jewish
[2:55:46] believers who are now Christian
[2:55:47] Believers in the land of Israel and they
[2:55:51] would get testimonies back as they as
[2:55:53] they worshiped and prayed and praised in
[2:55:55] Jerusalem they would get testimonies
[2:55:57] back and one of the churches that had an
[2:55:59] outpouring was down in Gaza the very
[2:56:01] place is under such turmoil right now it
[2:56:05] was Jewish held then and there was a
[2:56:08] group of little Jewish young people that
[2:56:10] had come to know Messiah and they were
[2:56:12] praying for an outpouring of God
[2:56:15] they were praying there on Zion these
[2:56:17] young people from Calvary Tabernacle
[2:56:19] were Calvary Pentecostal Tabernacle were
[2:56:22] and the word of the Lord spoke out of
[2:56:23] one of them and said while you're
[2:56:24] worshiping me tonight in Jerusalem I'm
[2:56:27] pouring out my spirit in
[2:56:31] Gaza few days later they began to make
[2:56:34] their way to Jerusalem and they began to
[2:56:36] give testimony to them find them and
[2:56:38] give testimony to them we're the
[2:56:43] beneficiaries we were meeting trying to
[2:56:45] know more of the Lord and he filled us
[2:56:47] with the Holy Ghost at the very same
[2:56:48] time that you all were praying and
[2:56:50] praising and dancing and worshiping me
[2:56:56] praise musicians until the spirit of
[2:56:58] worship
[2:57:00] comes and then
[2:57:02] worship until the glory comes and then

[3:13:21] those who have been preserved to Worship
[3:13:25] in the last days my God help
[3:13:29] us if you're here this afternoon and
[3:13:32] you've got a special need in your life
[3:13:35] at this time would you just raise up
[3:13:37] your hand and let somebody see
[3:13:41] you
[3:13:43] if you see there is Sister Rhonda and
[3:13:45] there there are several around Gia and
[3:13:47] Tiffany and sister Claudia and several
[3:13:50] others I couldn't see everybody sister
[3:13:53] shashana perhaps would you would you
[3:13:55] just slip to someone hold it up again if
[3:13:58] you are asking for prayer hold it up
[3:14:01] again if you're asking for
[3:14:04] prayer just slip to someone doesn't
[3:14:07] matter if someone has a big crowd slip
[3:14:10] to someone who had a need right now and
[3:14:13] it shouldn't be too hard shouldn't be
[3:14:15] too hard to get a need met in an
[3:14:17] atmosphere like this we just let our
[3:14:20] faith
[3:14:21] go Lord right now we just turn our faith
[3:14:26] loose you see every need that is
[3:14:29] represented maybe there were hands going
[3:14:31] up in people's
[3:14:33] homes you saw every hand not just the
[3:14:37] ones in this room and you know exactly
[3:14:41] what the need is
[3:14:43] and you're not only aware of the need
[3:14:46] but you have the supply you already have
[3:14:50] the benefit you have the
[3:14:52] answer if healing is needed you've
[3:14:55] already paid the price for healing if
[3:14:59] direction is needed you're the god of
[3:15:05] leadership if anxiety is an issue as as
[3:15:09] brother Hulk mentioned last Sunday and
[3:15:11] then it kind of went in a different
[3:15:13] direction but but I know there were
[3:15:15] people in this room last Sunday that
[3:15:18] deal with anxiety and were dealing with
[3:15:20] it even in that
[3:15:21] moment and I'm asking you right now to
[3:15:24] touch
[3:15:25] those even if they didn't raise their
[3:15:28] hand for a need this morning but they
[3:15:30] were here last Sunday under that burden
[3:15:33] I pray right now that by the power of
[3:15:35] the Holy Spirit you will pour peace and
[3:15:38] confidence and even the joy of the Holy
[3:15:41] Ghost into that life life to deal may
[3:15:43] they worship more praise more and
[3:15:45] worship more and come into the glory
[3:15:47] more often because that's the best thing
[3:15:50] I know as a remedy to deal with anxiety
[3:15:53] or fear or nervousness it's to focus not
[3:15:57] on how you're feeling or what you're
[3:15:59] experiencing but to focus on the
[3:16:02] goodness of God in a moment like that is
[3:16:05] the most effective thing we can do
[3:16:07] remind us by the Holy Spirit remind us
[3:16:11] in that hour
[3:16:13] to go back and do that so Lord every
[3:16:15] person who's being ministered to right
[3:16:17] now it's a little quiet in here but I'm
[3:16:19] hoping that faith is
[3:16:23] operating I'm hoping that faith is
[3:16:26] operating right now and and we're
[3:16:28] believing God
[3:16:33] yeah we're believing
[3:16:36] God to move in every one of these needs
[3:16:40] right nowall yes
[3:16:50] let the
[3:16:57] worshippers sons and the daughters
[3:17:02] sing Hallelujah I'm
[3:17:06] surrendering let's thank him right

[3:20:12] seated a moment we're almost ready to go
[3:20:16] I want to say to those who are streaming
[3:20:19] the service and who are givers here you
[3:20:23] should be watching this week for your uh
[3:20:27] contribution statement to come by
[3:20:30] email and if we don't have your email
[3:20:33] address would you reach out you can send
[3:20:36] it to
[3:20:37] nhrm that's New Hope Revival ministries
[3:20:40] just the initials
[3:20:42] nrm revival. org or whatever way you
[3:20:47] communicate with us there are a few that
[3:20:50] we don't have email addresses for when
[3:20:52] you were registering in your giving you
[3:20:56] perhaps didn't provide a a mailing
[3:20:58] address or an email address and we want
[3:21:01] to be faithful stewards we want to do
[3:21:04] things right and we want to provide you
[3:21:07] whether you use it or not it's up to you
[3:21:09] if you have a conviction against using
[3:21:12] it well don't you dare put that on but I
[3:21:15] put it on mine and I'm thankful that I
[3:21:19] can because they are fighting very hard
[3:21:22] I heard again this week that there is a
[3:21:25] lot of fighting going on to to fix it so
[3:21:28] that even people who itemize their
[3:21:30] deductions will not be allowed to use
[3:21:33] their contributions a charitable
[3:21:36] contributions on there and if you give
[3:21:38] enough it is a tremendous offset
[3:21:42] for your earned income a tremendous
[3:21:45] offset and if you don't know that if
[3:21:48] you've got a software if some of you use
[3:21:50] a software play with it and put in
[3:21:54] different amounts for the giving and
[3:21:56] then it will calculate what you owe and
[3:21:59] you will find out that it makes a
[3:22:01] tremendous difference in your owed taxes
[3:22:05] by giving and those of us who give way
[3:22:08] more than 10% of our income some some
[3:22:12] give up to 30% of their income then you
[3:22:15] really are offset and if you should
[3:22:18] reach the max there are certain
[3:22:21] allowances to roll some of your
[3:22:22] charitable giving over uh into the next
[3:22:26] year this is not a tax seminar brother
[3:22:29] Billy would be better qualified to do
[3:22:31] that than I would but every year it asks
[3:22:33] me when I go to fix mine if I have uh
[3:22:37] have something that was left over and
[3:22:39] not taken and not used I don't know how
[3:22:41] long that last either but I'm thankful I
[3:22:44] want you to know that you have been so
[3:22:48] faithful in your giving and again let me
[3:22:51] make this announcement and then we're
[3:22:52] going to leave the streamers if you have
[3:22:55] given and we don't have or you're not
[3:22:57] sure whether or not we have your email
[3:22:59] address if you'll email it to us
[3:23:02] nhrm revival. org that would be the best
[3:23:06] way to get it to us and then we will
[3:23:08] send this week the emailed receipts will
[3:23:11] will go out God bless you thank you for
[3:23:13] worshiping with us
