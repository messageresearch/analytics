TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today we are getting ready now for part three of a series that we have started on the process of spiritual adoption and we've already had a lot of fun teaching from Romans chapter 8 and guess what we're gonna go right back there again this week it's just so rich I think that is one of the richest chapters in the New Testament there are so many themes in Romans 8 that that awakened me that that really stirred up something within me and so I'm holding back a little bit because I mean I could take a half a verse of Romans eight and and speak all day because there's so many wonderful nuggets of truth there but we don't have that kind of time here on the television program if you've not contacted us to let us know that you're blessed by the Eagles cry would you take a look at the contact information that's given to you now on the screen and let us hear from you let us know that you are watching and if you have any prayer requests send them in we'd like to pray with you about your prayer requests and when God moves on your behalf and gives you the miracle you're after send us another email and let us know that God has answered prayer and we'll celebrate and rejoice with you there's one thing that we have come to know and that is God answers prayer he may not come when you want him to come but he's always right on time and he never fails and he doesn't always answer in the way that we want him to answer but he answers in a way that we know that it was him and that he is working all things out for our good so thank you for being a part of us praying for us and letting us help pray for you I just appreciate your faithful support of knowing that you're there and that you're praying we get emails sometime that say I never miss an episode and sometimes they'll tell us actually the time that they watch and and where they watch and I watch week after week and many times people will make a comment about one particular thing that was said or a theme to let me know that they were really watching and what program even or the subject matter of the series and that's just always a blessing so thank you so much let's get right into Romans chapter eight okay we left off in probably around verse 21 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God now ultimately we said this is speaking about the time of resurrection where our mortal body will put on immortality and and that which is of corruption will put on incorruption but also I believe it's speaking to us about overcoming the the limitations of this fleshly body there are some limitations because we're spirit beings that are living in an earthly body and there's just some things that this earthly body can't do but there is no limitation to what can be accomplished when your spirit man has come into union with the Spirit of God and I literally believe that the laws of the supernatural realm supersede the laws of the natural we see that all through the Bible we see men walking on water in the scripture we see iron axe heads floating in the stream we see a whole multitude of people fed with five loaves and and a few small fish we we see Jesus appearing to his disciples but not coming through the door we see the very Pete the very shadow of Peter healing the sick so there's some amazing miraculous occurrences in the Bible both Old Testament and New Testament now I know there are many who believe that those were Occulus occurrences are for that day they were Bible day things and we're never gonna see that again well I tell you I don't buy that I don't believe that at all because one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible says contrary to that Hebrews 13 and eight Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not and what he was able to do when he walked the shores of Galilee he's still able to do that today and so I believe that this scripture is not only speaking about overcoming this body of corruption and when it's changed in the resurrection but I believe it's also speaking to us of being set free from the limitations of the fleshly body so that we can enter into the glorious liberty and freedom of the children of God verse 22 says for we know that the whole creation that's everything in creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now even the earthquakes and the volcanoes and the super storms of this century testify that all of creation is in birth pains and is groaning for the manifestation or the unveiling or the revealing the apocalypsis of the children of God the adopted sons of God hallelujah verse 23 and not only they not only creation but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body we're waiting on our adoption that will bring about that's what to wit means to bring about the redemption of our body so that we could overcome the limitations of this fleshly body now what does this mean verse 23 not only creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God but we also as believers we're groaning we which have the firstfruits of the Spirit now you know I love the fact that everything that was in the Father he poured into the son and everything that was in the son the Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah he poured out upon the ecclesia the church on the day of Pentecost Shavuot and the same pillar of fire that led Moses and the children of Israel through the wilderness divided itself and appeared on the heads above the heads of the disciples in the upper room and Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and that's what he did on the day of Pentecost God Almighty came down in another form in the form of the Holy Spirit another manifestation another office not another person but another demonstration of the one true Living God here ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one but on the day of Pentecost we had another expression another manifestation or even another office if you want to call it that of God but what was it it was the same spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ it was the same spirit that overshadowed Mary and she conceived the Lord Jesus Christ so it's it's but and when we as believers have been washed in the blood sanctified by the word we've received the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the with evidence of gifts and tongues and and we have taught you here on the program that we believe that the ultimate evidence the ultimate fruit that someone has received the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's not speaking in tongues or gifts of the Spirit because it's possible to have those things and not have the fullness of the Spirit of God in your life we've seen that we've seen the counterfeit we know what can can happen out there but the true evidence is the the grace to live a life that is surrendered to every word of God I tell you the devil can imitate tongues he can imitate gifts he can imitate a revival I mean he can stir up people and have them all excited about things but there's one thing the devil can't do he cannot produce a life that is surrendered to the Word of God that's the evidence of the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and when we received I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit at the age of seven years old and it changed my life forever more I thought there couldn't be anything better than this this is this is God this is God in my body this is the Spirit of God living in me walking with me testifying that he's here that's what tongues is and it is it is biblical and it is for today to speak in tongues is a testimony that God's presence it's living inside of you and I believe in tongues and I believe in the gift of interpretation of tongues and I believe in prophecy and the gifts of healing and miracles and words of knowledge and wisdom and discerning of spirits I believe those gifts we need them but I know how the enemy can can imitate those kinds of things but he just can't live a godly surrendered life so that's our ultimate goal it's not to be able to prophesy more it's to be able to live more like Jesus but with all the fullness that we receive with all that greatness a great portion of God that we receive when we had the baptism of the Holy Spirit the Bible said that's just the earnest that's just the downpayment hallelujah that's just the deposit now in a real estate transaction when you are initiating a a contract to buy real estate many times the seller of the real estate will require that you put up a down payment but it's really not a down payment because the down payment is what you have to come up with when you're securing financing for the loan to pay for the property but they often require you to come up with what is called earnest money and that says it's held in what is called escrow it doesn't go to the seller right away it's usually held in an escrow account by the real-estate agency and what that says to the seller is I'm serious about my contract I'm not wasting your time I want you to know I'm putting up this earnest money to let you know that if you accept the terms of my contract and we can come to an agreement on such-and-such a date we will sit down sign the papers and you will be given a check for the remainder of the price the fullness of the price so when you get the earnest as a seller you only have a portion of the price that's coming to you and so if the Bible says that we have received the first fruits of the spirit or in other places it says the word earnest then we know that even after we have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's not over there's more of God to be had hallelujah I mean you're talking you're listening to a Pentecostal who received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and I thought I mean that was life what could be better and yet the Bible teaches us that when you have that experience there's more to be had there's more of God the deep calling to the deep but the noise of that waterspouts God wants to fill us with the fullness of the Spirit not just the earnest not just the firstfruits but the fullness and what is the fullness of the Holy Spirit of God it is adoption spiritual oneness spiritual adoption with God or by God and that's what this whole chapter is revealing we which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves and I'm telling you there is a groaning that's coming about in the spirit a longing a passionate deep cry god I've got to be filled with the fullness of your character I've got to be filled with the fullness of your spirit I want to walk in that place of authority in you so there is something groaning in us that can't be satisfied with the things of the world even we ourselves groan within ourselves we're in verse 23 waiting for the adoption to wit or that will bring us to the redemption of our body so it's it's by this revelation of spiritual adoption that we even come into a place of qualification for a resurrected body so you decide whether it's important or not if you want to have a body change one of these days then it is highly important very important that we come into that place of adoption and I want to make sure you understand that the adoption process and we'll talk about that in a moment it begins in the new birth but it doesn't end there so even if you're born again of the Spirit you've been justified by faith wash by the water of the word we go through this little thing again filled with the precious Holy Spirit of God you still have not come to the fullness of adoption now I know many churches denominations and so forth seminaries and theologians will say well that's adoption that's all there is to it well I can show you from the Word of God there's more to it than that so let's keep looking keep reading and keep studying in this series because I believe God wants to do some more verse 24 says for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man see if why don't they yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not think about this then do we with patience wait for it we're hoping for the fullness of adoption that has not yet been revealed we can wait for it with patience now I have a confession to make sometimes I get a little impatient because I'm ready to see the work of God finished in the earth I'm ready to see the kingdom of God established on planet Earth it's getting ugly out there it's getting dark out there hatred is rising and and it's bad on the world scene things are not getting better and we there's not been change yet except change for the band everywhere we look but we keep waiting with hope because we know that the sons of God are about to arise the church if you want to say the church I don't I don't often use that expression when I'm speaking about these terms because the church is what we what I think of when I think of Church you may think of the body of Christ when I think of church unfortunately I usually think of of what man has made it and and we're when you think of church you may be thinking of the church it was born on the day of Pentecost that which God established in the beginning but where is that church we're looking for that church where is that ecclesia where is that fellowship of believers that are doing it today like it was done in the book of Acts I don't know where that exists it's only in token form but we're coming to a place of harvest where we are going to see an emergence of a company of believers who operate in the same spiritual power and authority that we read about in the book of Acts Oh hallelujah so I just wanted to sort of help you understand the the term and why I'm saying body and bride and overcomers and sons of God and so forth because I believe that in every church there will be some who are called to this some are feeling that deep call and and who are not satisfied with with just the form they're not satisfied with just what they've been doing all these years perhaps you've heard me say before if you always do what you've always done then you'll always be what you've always been and there's a cry in my spirit that says I don't want to be what I've always been I want to be more for God not for me but for God verse 26 said likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities that's good news for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and that word uttered literally means which cannot be understood and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so when you don't know how to pray that's one of the reasons why the gift of the Spirit was given so that he could pray through us because the spirit itself always knows the mind of God so the Spirit will pray through you the mind of God why is that so important because it cuts out selfish ambition it cuts out soulish prayers it keeps us from manipulating God when the spirit prays through us he always prays the will of God and so I tell people you need to pray until you come into a place that you can pray in a heavenly language or with groanings that cannot be understood because much is accomplished you're bypassing your mind you're bypassing your will you're bypassing your soul and and the Holy Spirit is crying out to God from your spirit and this is an amazing gift that God has given the New Testament church this wasn't available in the Old Testament this was given to them into the New Testament believer of which I'm a part of that and I believe you're called to that so if you've never experience that gift you need the gift because once you get it that's just the earnest there's more where that came from hallelujah alright so because he maketh intercession the spirit for the Saints according to the will of God now everybody knows this verse but we have to be reminded of it sometime and we know that all things somebody say all things we know that all things work together for good to them that love God if it doesn't feel like it even if it doesn't look like it even if it doesn't smell like it even if it doesn't sound like it all things work together for good to them that love God that's me to them who are the called according to his purpose that's me that's you for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren now this is a very important truth that is being revealed here God in his foreknowledge knew our choice and by his knowledge of our choice he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son so that Jesus the son might be the firstborn among many brethren now that speaks of sonship that speaks of adoption Jesus paid the price walked the walk talked the talk won the victory over death hell and the grave so that you and I could fellowship him in his sufferings receive the glory that is to be revealed in us and ultimately be a manifested resurrected son of God because if there's firstfruits there's got to be the rest of a harvest if one son is the firstfruits of those who will be sons where are the other sons where is the rest well that's what we're contending for that's what we're believing for that's what we're hearing God revealed in this hour by the spirit the sons of God are arising those hungry passionate loving warriors those who are given the anointing to overcome the sons of the kingdom are racing up in this hour desperately tired of mundane Christianity and desiring relationship abba papa father god relationship drawn up under the arm of Almighty God and loved until you become like him this is what the scripture is talking about and it gives us so much hope to know that if Jesus lived among us lived in the earth was tempted in all manner like we are yet without sin and he overcame and he said little children I've overcome the world and I'm price he told us I'm praying for you he said to Peter I'm praying for you and I believe he's pet praying for us interceding for us as well that we will also overcome moreover verse 30 the last verse that we're going to read in Romans 8 moreover whom he also called excuse me whom he also whom he predestined he would get it right in a moment moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified that settles it the Word of God says so it's all a part of God's divine plan for you and I especially this last generation those of us who are now in the most exciting time the consummation of the ages evil is maturing and so are the sons of God evil is maturing the spirit of lawlessness the spirit of iniquity the spirit of Antichrist is maturing the sons of the wicked one are maturing and so are the sons of God there's about to be an ultimate showdown on Mount Carmel spiritually speaking God is going to show himself strong and this time he's going to do it through those who trust in him those manifested adopted sons of God now when we look here in Romans chapter 8 at this word adoption it's translated from two Greek words one of which is the word huse in greek it means mature sons and it is also translated from another word two words put together the first word huo's which means mature sons and the second word being thesis perhaps you've heard that word used for college or university which means placing so if you read the word adoption in the New Testament it means the placing the positioning the setting in order of maturer sons not little babies crying to get their way but the setting in order the placing of mature sons so this could be translated the placing of mature sons or a shorter version sonship sonship is being revealed we're going to have to end now part three and I want you to tune in again next time for part four let's pray together father I thank you that you have allowed us to come together today and speak the words of truth and I pray that they will take anchor take root in somebody's heart and that they will be anointed with a passion a desire to dig to search the scripture to see if these things be so and then to position themselves in prayer to receive for their life as an individual the promises that you're making known to us today through your word for those who are sick and afflicted you are the physician led healing flow right now in the mighty name of Jesus Yeshua the Messiah Lord we asked for deliverance for our loved ones and help for those who are oppressed of the enemy we just released your anointing right now to touch those who are watching this program in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Yeshua HaMashiach a man any man thank you again for watching the Eagles cry and I want to invite you to tune in again next week we're gonna do it all again we're going to continue this series on the process of spiritual adoption may God richly bless you this week bye bye for now
