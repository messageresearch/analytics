Description:
As with two tuning forks tuned the same, when we as His Bride have His Life in us and we and are so in tune with Him and one another, the same Holy Spirit will resonate through each of us.  When we speak His Word, it will send out a Message with the right tone.  When we get closer to Him and His Word, we will demonstrate the same note through our voice, through our lives, in perfect harmony and perfect tune to the Absolute.  God’s Word is His Absolute!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sympathetic resonance if you heard of that sympathetic resonance the thing with a tuning fork if you have it where it's in a base to where you're not you're not touching it but if you have one fork here and another Fork here you get them close enough together and if they're tuned the same you strike one fork and the closer it gets to this Fork over here that's tuned to the same it will start resonating the same tone and it never was touched there was never a physical contact but just because it's tuned the same it will start saying the same thing you get what I'm trying to say if we are tuned the same and we have his life a representation in US and that word is sounding Out and the closer we get to that note that's being sounded out guess what it's going to resonate through you and you're going to realize nothing that you did but because if there's a representation that you're attuned to the same note that because you're tuned the same and this voice is ringing out here and the closer you get to it all of a sudden that same voice starts resonating out through you and guess what it's saying the very same thing and that Holy Spirit is sounding over here I want to get as close to where the holy spirit is sounding out because I know I can get close to you guess what I'm gonna be saying the same thing I don't want to say anything different I want to say the same thing I want the same holy spirit that resonated through brother Branham I want the same Holy Spirit to resonate through me I wanted to say the very same thing that he said because if it does I know I'm in line with his word the closer that I can get to this word and this word is being spoken and it's sending out a message and it's sending out the right tone the closer that my life can get to that is going to be demonstrating the same thing that same note is going to resonate through my voice through my life through the things that I say the places I go it's going to say the same thing it has to say the same thing because I'm built the same you have to be in perfect tune Perfect Harmony in perfect tune to the absolute in his absolute is his word amen
