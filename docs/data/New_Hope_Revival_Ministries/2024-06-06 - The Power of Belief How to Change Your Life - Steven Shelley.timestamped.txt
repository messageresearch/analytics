[0:00] I believe in the power of your amen I
[0:04] believe your amen makes the word of God
[0:07] personal to you I believe when you hear
[0:10] a truth that you believe in and you say
[0:13] Amen you don't have to scream it so loud
[0:15] you send other people off the Pew but
[0:18] you speak it out of your mouth and that
[0:22] word means amen means what it means so
[0:26] be it and because it's a personal
[0:28] expression between you in the Lord
[0:30] you're actually saying and so let it be
[0:33] in my life I believe that's the truth
[0:36] and so let it be in my life so many
[0:38] times when the word of God Goes Forth we
[0:41] disqualify ourselves from receiving it
[0:45] and we think of all the reasons why
[0:47] we're not worthy of that promise or why
[0:50] we may not have that in our life or what
[0:53] what we have done or the mistakes that
[0:55] we have
[0:56] made God's not looking at your mistake
[1:00] he's looking at your faith if you're
[1:03] going to speak the word Jesus says the
[1:06] prerequisite for doing that is to make
[1:09] sure that there is no doubt no doubt in
[1:15] your heart otherwise you pray and you
[1:18] ask the Lord Lord I believe help thou my
[1:23] unbelief that's how we should pray we
[1:26] should really pray that way now Lord I
[1:27] know you can I believe you will
[1:30] I I I do but help me help me in my
[1:33] unbelief help me in my doubt but if
[1:36] you're going to rise up and the bride
[1:38] will the prophet told us that in that
[1:41] last day the bride will have thus saith
[1:45] the
[1:47] Lord and she will keep still until she
[1:52] has thus sayith the Lord and when she
[1:55] has it she will do exactly what is
[1:57] spoken and God will bring that to pass
[2:01] in her life so we're going to shake some
[2:04] mountains in the last of the last days
[2:07] and we're shaking mountains now through
[2:09] prayer but we're coming to a place of
[2:12] recognized Authority is anybody here
[2:15] when we begin to recognize our Authority
[2:18] it won't be asking anymore it won't be
[2:21] begging or petitioning anymore but a
[2:23] revelation will rise up in your heart
[2:26] this is the will of God and you will
[2:29] decree a thing the Bible said and what
[2:32] you decree without doubt in your heart
[2:36] will will it has to come to
[2:41] pass if you can say the right thing
[2:45] instead of the wrong thing God will do
[2:50] exactly what he said he was going to do
[2:52] for you if God told you he had given you
[2:56] a companion you hold on to the promise
[2:59] of of God and believe that in the right
[3:03] season in the DU time God will keep his
[3:06] word are you going to get through that
[3:08] problem that you're going through right
[3:10] now have you got any evidence that
[3:12] you're going to are you going to get out
[3:14] from under depression are you going to
[3:16] trust God to help you off of those
[3:18] anxiety drugs are you going to put God
[3:21] to the test and believe him do you have
[3:23] any
[3:24] evidence then what is
[3:27] it help me help me help me help
[3:31] yourself God said
[3:34] so God said so do you hear that devil
[3:40] God said
[3:42] [Music]
[3:44] so he said I'm going to give you your
[3:47] children and your children are going to
[3:50] serve
[3:53] me do you have any evidence that they're
[3:56] turning toward the lord now
[4:00] not with the natural
[4:02] eye in fact the natural eye is they get
[4:06] meaner every
[4:08] day don't pray that they'll that they
[4:10] will know suffering and heartache and
[4:13] and humility and and be humiliated don't
[4:16] don't pray such a prayer as that but
[4:18] don't always pray them out of every
[4:20] situation they find themselves in trust
[4:24] God believe that he has given you a
[4:27] promise
