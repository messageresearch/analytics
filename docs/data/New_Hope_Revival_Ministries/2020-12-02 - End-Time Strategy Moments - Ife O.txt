TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there's a hand that knows exactly where each piece is to be placed because there is a strategy and as i began to pray i saw a chessboard i don't know very much about chess but but i know a little bit from hearing other people talk and i saw a chessboard and i saw a shadow bump the board i didn't see a person or or an image but i saw what looked like a shadow of something bumped the chessboard and many pieces began to fall over toppled over in slow motion you'd think they'd just fall over but in slow motion i watched the pieces of the chessboard fall over and i saw a hand and i knew it was the hand of the lord and i saw him begin to go and i was thinking in my mind i would never remember because i'm not a chess player i would never remember where they were you know here they go and they fall over and they're scattered and kind of rolling around i would never remember but i saw a hand that knew see this was a reminder to me that there's a hand that knows exactly where each piece is to be placed because there is a strategy because it's important to have a plan as you go along and there was a strategy and in normal circumstances the enemy would be able to come in and just disturb the strategy when he disturbed the pieces on the board but there's somebody that remembers the strategy i saw the hand restoring the game and i knew that god's strategy was being restored and that though the enemy had caused a confusion and a scatter that he is still sovereign and he has a purpose and a plan it's not a game to god it's not a game it's something that he had on his mind for you and for me before the foundation of the world so i just began to give god praise that he knew exactly how to move every piece right back to where it was originally supposed to be and that the enemy's confusion and his interruption of the game was short-lived it was serious but it was short-lived and god has the grace and the ability to pick up where things left off and carry them all the way to eternity let me tell you the god who started a good work of redemption in you the god who sanctified you from the mess you were in and set you up right into his righteousness he knows how to take you all the way he's not just the author of our faith this morning but he's the author and the finisher of our faith hallelujah he'll see us all the way through because that's who he is
