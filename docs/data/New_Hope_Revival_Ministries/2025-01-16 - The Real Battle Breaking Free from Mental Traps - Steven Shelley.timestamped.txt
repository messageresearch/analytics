[0:00] this is a battlefield and the battle is
[0:02] not flesh and blood the battle is
[0:05] against principalities and power
[0:07] spiritual wickedness and high places the
[0:09] battle is with your accuser the battle
[0:11] is with a
[0:13] lie you'll never win a battle with a lie
[0:17] with another lie you'll only win a
[0:18] battle with a Lie by telling the truth
[0:21] speak the truth into
[0:25] that if you allow the enemy to squeeze
[0:28] you to that place you'll you'll you'll
[0:30] be the person nobody loves me and
[0:32] everybody hates me and everybody's out
[0:34] to get
[0:35] me you see that can lead to mental
[0:39] illness so the opportunity to be
[0:42] offended is an Ever
[0:45] reoccurring sort of thing
[0:49] amen
[0:51] repetitive it comes in the same door it
[0:55] comes through the same
[0:57] vessel it's dressed sometime in the same
[0:59] way words and phrases and expressions
[1:03] and what we have to do is when we
[1:05] recognize well we're not recognizing it
[1:07] very well because we didn't understand
[1:10] it to be a baited trap but if we can
[1:13] understand that like
[1:16] unforgiveness like Envy like
[1:19] jealousy like other things that we
[1:21] struggle within our heart when we're
[1:23] trying to guard it and keep it clean the
[1:26] enemy baits us first and then my my my
[1:31] when we take the
[1:33] bait he slams the door shut and then we
[1:37] become the Geral on the wheel
[1:40] caught oh my but if you can come if I
[1:45] can come to a place where we let the
[1:48] past strengthen us and not shade or
[1:53] diminish our love for one another then
[1:55] the purposes of God are actually being
[1:57] fulfilled in our life tribulation and
[2:00] trials situations where iron sharpeneth
[2:03] iron it's actually making us more like
[2:06] him the prophet tells us we're being
[2:09] honed in we're coming to a narrow point
[2:12] so that Jesus Christ The Living Capstone
[2:16] can come and take his rightful place at
[2:20] the head of all things is he Lord of all
[2:23] in your
[2:25] life then he's got to be Lord over your
[2:28] heart he's got to be king over over your
[2:30] emotions he's got to sit on the throne
[2:33] of your inner life are you a new
[2:35] creation in
[2:37] Christ then where is that old man he's
[2:40] to be dead and everything that's
[2:43] attached with him has to Die the reality
[2:47] is it's not
[2:48] automatic the reality is it has to be
[2:51] dealt with you're the only one that can
[2:53] deal with it you're the only one that
[2:55] can bring order to the chaos The
[2:58] Authority is in your mou mouth the word
[3:01] is in your hand it's in your mouth come
[3:04] on the blood of Jesus Christ is not only
[3:08] available to be
[3:11] appropriated it it it is
[3:14] absolutely part of the inheritance of
[3:18] this bride to fully appropriate the
[3:23] power and the blood of Jesus Christ
[3:27] there's been no other blood like that
[3:30] it's God's blood blood created by God
[3:34] for the specific purpose of redemption
[3:37] there's a life there it's Zoe life it's
[3:41] God's own life and if his life is there
[3:44] in the blood his love is
[3:47] there so you've not only got his life
[3:50] flowing through you you've got his love
[3:52] flowing through you and we must tear
[3:56] open the the roof we've got to kick down
[3:59] the wall we've got to burst the dams and
[4:02] we've got to let that love flow
[4:06] out it's recognizing that we're on the
[4:09] same
[4:10] team if you fail I
[4:14] fail if you trip I might
[4:17] trip if you don't succeed none of us
[4:21] succeed we are
[4:23] responsible as
[4:25] keepers not only first and foremost for
[4:28] our own mind
[4:30] but we are also somewhat responsible
[4:34] through the obligation and yet the
[4:37] privilege of Brotherly kindness
[4:39] fraternal love we are therefore
[4:43] responsible for the other
[4:48] Marines for the other team
[4:51] members if they fail we might fail
