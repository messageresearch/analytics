[1:01:34] big number how many of you'd like to see

[1:02:04] likes and and follows somebody said does
[1:02:07] any of that really matter it really
[1:02:10] matters
[1:02:11] it really matters
[1:02:13] because it's one of the ways that we can
[1:02:15] reach out
[1:02:17] we used to do everything through snail
[1:02:19] mail
[1:02:20] and we have we have files and files to
[1:02:24] prove
[1:02:25] the tens of thousands of cassette tapes
[1:02:28] that went out of this place through the
[1:02:30] years
[1:02:31] did you know that before this month is
[1:02:33] over i will celebrate 32 years as the
[1:02:36] pastor of this church
[1:02:38] and in those 32 years we have sent tens
[1:02:42] perhaps hundreds of thousands of sermons
[1:02:45] to almost every nation and every
[1:02:48] continent in the world
[1:02:50] that is the grace of god
[1:02:52] and the testimonies fill
[1:02:54] those filing cabinets down in the office
[1:02:58] and today we don't communicate through
[1:03:00] snail mail very much we get a few little
[1:03:03] uh tithe checks from
[1:03:05] uh some of our streamers come in the
[1:03:07] mail
[1:03:09] every now and again we get a letter from
[1:03:12] somewhere else in the world i had a
[1:03:14] wonderful package come this week let me
[1:03:16] get it
[1:03:18] don't go anywhere
[1:03:21] i'll be right back
[1:03:23] it's not too
[1:03:28] far i got pretty excited to get mail
[1:03:33] we have plenty of bills that come in the
[1:03:35] mailbox out there
[1:03:37] and a few checks
[1:03:38] but more bills than anything so i was
[1:03:41] real excited to open up this package
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:46] it is all the way from
[1:03:49] japan
[1:03:51] and i'm not going to be able to tell you
[1:03:54] anything but that
[1:03:57] can't pronounce the names
[1:03:59] of the places and the cities
[1:04:01] i can pronounce sister emiko
[1:04:04] because we know her
[1:04:06] wakatsuki
[1:04:08] wakatsuki
[1:04:10] uh she came all the way from japan many
[1:04:14] years ago with sister fusay her daughter
[1:04:17] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:04:19] jesus christ
[1:04:20] and so she sent me a gift
[1:04:23] and it's a token
[1:04:25] because i can't read anything but the
[1:04:27] cover
[1:04:31] but this is sister fusay's
[1:04:35] first
[1:04:36] novel
[1:04:37] in japanese
[1:04:42] it doesn't even look greek to me it
[1:04:44] looks japanese
[1:04:47] it looks like that the words go up and
[1:04:49] down
[1:04:50] instead of a cross
[1:04:53] and it says a christian novel
[1:04:56] to pastor stephen shelley thank you for
[1:04:58] your faithful prayer and sister fousey
[1:05:01] has signed her name
[1:05:04] and there was a letter in here
[1:05:07] let's see if i can find the letter
[1:05:09] how many of you'd like to hear a letter
[1:05:11] from sister emiko
[1:05:13] she didn't give us permission to read it
[1:05:15] but we'll
[1:05:16] we'll ask forgiveness later
[1:05:19] now i don't know if you all know this or
[1:05:20] not but sister emiko has a business
[1:05:24] and
[1:05:24] she designs cards and stationary and her
[1:05:29] character being japanese her character
[1:05:32] is that elephant
[1:05:34] you see that
[1:05:35] and she does quite well i think
[1:05:38] with uh this little character that she
[1:05:41] has come up with and she uses that so
[1:05:43] let me read this to you shalom
[1:05:46] i wish i could have
[1:05:48] fluent lips that could speak as holy
[1:05:52] spirit shows me
[1:05:54] but reality is my lips are heavy
[1:05:57] only when worshipping
[1:06:00] my tongue can cut loose
[1:06:02] and speak unknown tongues which nobody
[1:06:05] can understand
[1:06:06] anyway i want you to know how i thank
[1:06:09] you and your ministry and your worship
[1:06:11] team
[1:06:12] i make it a very important i make it
[1:06:14] very important to stream sunday and
[1:06:17] tuesday service
[1:06:18] your meetings are life source to me and
[1:06:21] they are special because you respect
[1:06:23] israel
[1:06:25] and the worship flows
[1:06:27] like ruth hefflin experienced i read the
[1:06:30] glory book many times
[1:06:32] and your message is fresh truth which
[1:06:34] nourishes me
[1:06:36] i must thank again sister nancy bergen
[1:06:39] for having introduced me to your
[1:06:40] ministry
[1:06:42] by streaming i have been worshiping the
[1:06:44] lord in the midnight hours
[1:06:46] of mondays and wednesdays since 2005.
[1:06:52] now that's a long time to be connected
[1:06:54] isn't it from 2005
[1:06:57] since i left the pentecostal church
[1:07:00] i have not had so many experiences of
[1:07:03] corporate worship but i do worship him
[1:07:06] sincerely and i believe i'm sowing into
[1:07:08] heaven
[1:07:09] god has blessed me with my family and my
[1:07:12] work
[1:07:13] i lived alone after fusee married but
[1:07:15] soon she returned with koya and ibuki
[1:07:19] now my house is loud and busy and lots
[1:07:22] of laughters and loving cares it doesn't
[1:07:25] sound like she's complaining to me as
[1:07:28] for fousey how much i thank you and your
[1:07:30] ministry team
[1:07:32] my heart was heavy with appreciation but
[1:07:34] couldn't utter the words of which i'm
[1:07:36] sorry
[1:07:37] she was raised in a church but i wanted
[1:07:40] her to encounter god so i depended on
[1:07:43] your ministry i thought kendra was a key
[1:07:46] girl to let her to the circle at the
[1:07:48] ministry and thank god that fousey was
[1:07:51] willing to obey the lord and now she is
[1:07:54] how much i thank your ministry including
[1:07:56] your youth camps and even bridal showers
[1:08:00] fousey is a bookworm she has devoured
[1:08:03] mountains of books and produced a book
[1:08:06] which i'm enclosing
[1:08:07] it's a story about a girl who is raised
[1:08:10] in a christian family tried to deny god
[1:08:13] and go wild but gradually she realized
[1:08:16] the hand of god
[1:08:18] caught her whenever she would fall and
[1:08:20] gradually she realized god is real and
[1:08:24] was baptized in the name of yeshua
[1:08:27] i now i know you cannot read it but as a
[1:08:30] fruit of your effort of arranging for a
[1:08:33] japanese girl to meet yeshua i want you
[1:08:36] to keep it you don't have to reply to
[1:08:39] this letter don't worry about not being
[1:08:41] able to broadcast all the meetings
[1:08:44] because we had some problems with the
[1:08:45] stream i will catch up with the meetings
[1:08:48] somehow sister emiko let's give god
[1:08:51] praise for that
[1:08:53] it means a lot
[1:09:00] god used sister nancy bergin living in
[1:09:03] jerusalem
[1:09:05] he allowed us to take the message to her
[1:09:08] and we baptized her
[1:09:10] in columbus she flew all the way from
[1:09:12] jerusalem
[1:09:13] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:09:15] jesus christ and then she took her 20 00
[1:09:19] 20 000 people on her email list
[1:09:22] and she sent the messages of truth from
[1:09:25] this place
[1:09:26] to 20 000 people around the world
[1:09:29] and sister emiko was one of those people
[1:09:32] one out of twenty thousand
[1:09:34] she heard the truth of being baptized in
[1:09:37] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:09:39] arranged to bring her and her daughter
[1:09:41] all the way from japan to be baptized in
[1:09:43] his name i'm telling you that's
[1:09:44] desperation
[1:09:46] and now god has blessed them and uh
[1:09:49] sister fousey has a wonderful husband
[1:09:52] and a beautiful little handsome boy
[1:09:54] and they're serving the lord together
[1:09:57] sister fousey is interpreting the
[1:09:59] message of brother branham into the
[1:10:00] japanese language at times now for
[1:10:04] printing purposes
[1:10:05] and now has written this novel and we
[1:10:07] don't know how god is going to continue
[1:10:09] what he's going to do but he's going to
[1:10:11] continue to use them there
[1:10:13] and they don't have any support from us
[1:10:15] we have never even been able to make a
[1:10:17] visit to japan to encourage them they
[1:10:20] get everything they get just like you do
[1:10:22] from the service from streaming the
[1:10:24] service but god is faithful
[1:10:27] and he's helping people and we're so
[1:10:29] thankful for that let me do this real
[1:10:31] quick before we go to the word uh
[1:10:34] i don't think that all the birthdays
[1:10:36] were mentioned last week and so last
[1:10:39] sunday sister martha west had a birthday
[1:10:41] sister flo on monday sister fousey on
[1:10:44] wednesday sister beth polk on thursday
[1:10:47] paul west on friday and then jennifer
[1:10:50] stark sister anna miller ezekiel joseph
[1:10:54] had a birthday on friday brother josh
[1:10:58] and sister hope had their wedding
[1:10:59] anniversary five-year wedding
[1:11:02] anniversary on
[1:11:04] friday and he wasn't in town
[1:11:09] uh
[1:11:10] this week on wednesday
[1:11:12] sister deborah gossman has a birthday
[1:11:15] who is one of our very faithful
[1:11:17] streamers
[1:11:18] and also this coming friday september
[1:11:21] the 9th is the 32nd anniversary of my
[1:11:24] grandmother going home to be with the
[1:11:26] lord and me coming home to pastor the
[1:11:28] church so
[1:11:30] 32 years have flown by
[1:11:34] before the month is over
[1:11:36] i'll celebrate 47 years of full-time
[1:11:40] ministry and you know what
[1:11:42] i'm looking forward to these next days
[1:11:45] with great
[1:11:46] anticipation
[1:11:48] perhaps more than i've ever had in my
[1:11:50] entire life
[1:11:52] i sat here this morning in the in the
[1:11:54] atmosphere of god's glory and i said
[1:11:56] it's a wonderful thought to know that
[1:11:58] our greatest days are upon us they're
[1:12:01] upon us
[1:12:02] what god is doing right now and what
[1:12:04] what listen uh after years of of little
[1:12:08] growth
[1:12:10] just maintaining and doing the best we
[1:12:12] can for outreach
[1:12:14] in in 10 months
[1:12:16] god has added 20 faithful people
[1:12:20] to this church to this assembly you know
[1:12:22] that's outstanding for a church of what
[1:12:25] used to be 80 people
[1:12:27] i want to give god praise for that
[1:12:31] it started with the minkos
[1:12:34] it started with the minko family and
[1:12:36] they began to drive and we waited every
[1:12:39] sunday to see if they'd be back
[1:12:42] if they missed a sunday we went to
[1:12:44] praying
[1:12:45] afraid that we'd offended them in some
[1:12:47] way
[1:12:48] and then they have become very faithful
[1:12:50] and they make quite a sacrifice to do it
[1:12:53] the next thing you know we get this
[1:12:55] mysterious email from someone in florida
[1:13:00] very mysterious
[1:13:02] i'm trying to figure out who is this
[1:13:04] brother and why is he asking simple
[1:13:06] questions like this
[1:13:08] and the next thing you know about the
[1:13:10] end of the year brother reed became a
[1:13:12] part of our church and what a sacrifice
[1:13:14] he makes to drive almost four hours
[1:13:16] every weekend to be with us that's the
[1:13:19] grace of god
[1:13:21] and then we had this immigration from
[1:13:23] the west
[1:13:25] i said immigration not invasion
[1:13:29] there's a difference and they began to
[1:13:31] come and today
[1:13:33] celebrates number 20.
[1:13:36] because brother josh's mother precious
[1:13:38] sister claudia she's number 20. and
[1:13:41] we're looking for 21
[1:13:44] and 22 and 23
[1:13:46] as god is putting together a team here
[1:13:49] he is he's building a people here
[1:13:52] hallelujah deliverance
[1:13:54] is going to be our theme
[1:13:58] he spoke to us 30 years ago and he said
[1:14:01] there'll be a word of deliverance go
[1:14:03] forth from this place that shakes
[1:14:04] nations
[1:14:06] well we don't see how that's hardly
[1:14:07] possible
[1:14:09] in our natural abilities
[1:14:11] but it's him
[1:14:13] he's the one that multiplies and he's
[1:14:16] the one that anoints
[1:14:17] and he's the one that does outstanding
[1:14:20] things

[1:17:09] slides over and brother and benjamin
[1:17:11] goes to the drums and leads from the

[1:17:28] thank you for praying for us
[1:17:30] we had a wonderful holiday
[1:17:33] we uh
[1:17:35] love we love it i didn't used to love it
[1:17:37] i married someone who loves the sand i
[1:17:39] didn't like sand
[1:17:41] i didn't like the ocean too much i like
[1:17:44] to watch it on nature videos
[1:17:47] uh i grew up watching jacques cousteau
[1:17:50] anybody even know who that is
[1:17:53] i well i grew up watching
[1:17:55] marlon what was his name perkins or
[1:17:57] whatever his name was with mutual of
[1:17:59] omaha's wild kingdom
[1:18:01] i enjoyed observing the world through
[1:18:04] through the television screen as a kid
[1:18:07] never really cared about the ocean
[1:18:09] because or the beach because there are
[1:18:10] so many naked people that like to go
[1:18:12] down there you know
[1:18:14] and we just found out if you plan your
[1:18:16] trip and go a little bit off season you
[1:18:18] can almost have it to yourself
[1:18:21] we spent one whole day and there was 12
[1:18:23] people within sight
[1:18:25] that's all i could see from a d and i
[1:18:27] said this is the life
[1:18:29] god did that for us because just the
[1:18:31] week before they said it was so crowded
[1:18:34] you couldn't even find a spot what do
[1:18:36] you do you sit
[1:18:38] and then you sit some more
[1:18:41] and then you drink a dr pepper and you
[1:18:43] sit some more
[1:18:45] and you read
[1:18:47] and the ocean was
[1:18:49] was pancake flat
[1:18:52] and you don't get that often i mean
[1:18:54] pancake flat
[1:18:55] so flat that i could walk out to my
[1:18:58] shoulders
[1:19:00] and look down in the water and no
[1:19:02] don't need goggles didn't need special
[1:19:04] glasses you can see the bottom we could
[1:19:07] you could see fish we saw a manatee come
[1:19:09] by that's quite a sight
[1:19:12] they're big
[1:19:13] we saw a sea turtle we saw shark we saw
[1:19:17] all kinds of fish and
[1:19:20] i i knelt down in the sand one day and
[1:19:22] just enjoyed the waves
[1:19:24] and uh felt something pinched me really
[1:19:27] hard on the knee
[1:19:30] i screamed like a woman
[1:19:34] they come with a net and pulled up the
[1:19:35] biggest old blue crab about the biggest
[1:19:37] one i've ever seen
[1:19:40] and i i wanted to look at his pictures
[1:19:42] and see if part of my knee was there
[1:19:46] but we just had a wonderful time doing
[1:19:48] nothing
[1:19:49] and and what i like to eat fish but i
[1:19:52] don't like it anywhere that that's not
[1:19:54] within a
[1:19:55] shouting distance of the water it comes
[1:19:57] out of
[1:19:58] you know you you can't go brother
[1:20:00] joshilano found out you can't
[1:20:02] order a fish sandwich here in columbus
[1:20:06] by the time it gets here it's hardly
[1:20:08] fish but when you can eat it right in
[1:20:10] the right in the area brother reed came
[1:20:13] up and we had had a nice fellowship with
[1:20:15] him anyway you don't need to hear every
[1:20:17] detail
[1:20:18] very little shopping very little
[1:20:21] entertain in very little of anything but
[1:20:24] just resting god is good
[1:20:27] second corinthians chapter 10
[1:20:30] verse 4 through six
[1:20:32] i was able to keep my word to my family
[1:20:35] they asked me to promise that unless
[1:20:38] there was an emergency i wouldn't take
[1:20:40] any phone calls
[1:20:41] or make any phone calls
[1:20:44] i did a whole lot of texting
[1:20:46] they didn't mention that
[1:20:49] but i didn't take or make any phone
[1:20:51] calls for a week and that's probably the
[1:20:52] first week in my life
[1:20:54] i don't remember a time ever that that
[1:20:56] was that way but i promised my kids
[1:20:59] and uh and and i was able by the grace
[1:21:02] of god to keep my promise he took care
[1:21:05] of you brother greeley did some mighty
[1:21:08] fine preaching
[1:21:10] sunday and tuesday night
[1:21:12] and i'm thankful that we didn't have to
[1:21:14] worry about anything
[1:21:16] all right we're back to where we were
[1:21:17] the sunday before i left i want to
[1:21:19] finish this message this morning for the
[1:21:22] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[1:21:26] you can't make them carnal
[1:21:28] they're not between you and i
[1:21:31] they're bigger than you and i
[1:21:34] our weapons are mighty through god to
[1:21:37] the pulling down of
[1:21:39] strong holes every one of them
[1:21:43] casting down imaginations in every high
[1:21:46] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:21:50] knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:21:52] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:21:56] of christ and having in a readiness to
[1:22:00] revenge all disobedience when your
[1:22:04] obedience
[1:22:05] is fulfilled can the church say amen
[1:22:09] second corinthians 2 11
[1:22:11] very quickly let's go
[1:22:13] lest satan should get an advantage of us
[1:22:18] for we let's read it together for we are
[1:22:22] not ignorant of his devices
[1:22:25] we've fought him before
[1:22:27] we know his tricks can you say amen
[1:22:31] second corinthians 11
[1:22:33] verse 1 through 4
[1:22:35] would to god you could bear with me a
[1:22:38] little in my folly
[1:22:40] and indeed bear with me
[1:22:43] for i am jealous over you the apostle
[1:22:45] paul said i am jealous over you
[1:22:51] with godly jealousy
[1:22:53] for i have espoused
[1:22:56] you to one husband
[1:22:59] that i may present you
[1:23:02] as a chaste virgin to christ this was
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:07] responsibility of the first church age
[1:23:09] messenger and every church age messenger
[1:23:12] that would follow
[1:23:13] it's the responsibility of every pastor
[1:23:17] every apostle every prophet every pastor
[1:23:20] excuse me every teacher every evangelist
[1:23:23] it's a responsibility of every
[1:23:25] ministering brethren
[1:23:27] to make sure that let's go back
[1:23:30] to make sure that we are helping to
[1:23:33] prepare a bride
[1:23:35] that we may help see that bride
[1:23:38] presented to christ
[1:23:41] as a chaste virgin one who is untouched
[1:23:45] unadulterated by the teachings of man
[1:23:48] a pure word bride how many of you know
[1:23:52] there's a difference in a church
[1:23:54] and a pure word
[1:23:56] a church bride that's not what he's
[1:23:58] looking for he's looking for a pure
[1:24:01] word bride
[1:24:04] but i fear lest by any means as the
[1:24:07] serpent beguiled eve through his
[1:24:10] subtlety
[1:24:11] so your minds should be corrupted from
[1:24:16] the simplicity that is in christ and one
[1:24:21] more while you're while you're there
[1:24:23] uh ii corinthians 3 17
[1:24:27] now the lord is that spirit and where
[1:24:30] the spirit of the lord is
[1:24:34] where the spirit of the lord is
[1:24:37] there is liberty father we come to you
[1:24:40] right now
[1:24:42] and we thank you that you have been with
[1:24:44] us
[1:24:45] through this service
[1:24:47] thank you for your anointing
[1:24:49] thank you for the precious presence of
[1:24:52] the lord that has been here and now we
[1:24:56] have
[1:24:56] received the offering and we have
[1:24:58] greeted the birthday and we've done all
[1:25:01] those little things that we like to do
[1:25:04] we lay all that behind us now and we
[1:25:06] approach the reason why we're here
[1:25:10] we didn't come just to feel you
[1:25:12] we came to hear your voice
[1:25:15] we came to honor the living word of god
[1:25:18] and here we stand in need of a clear
[1:25:23] word we need a clear message that comes
[1:25:26] from your word
[1:25:28] so we take authority over every demonic
[1:25:31] power every distracting spirit of hell
[1:25:34] and we push you back
[1:25:36] through the authority of jesus christ
[1:25:39] and we call on the lord to come and
[1:25:41] anoint our ears to hear the living word
[1:25:45] and to anoint your servant to be only a
[1:25:47] pipeline that your word may i not bring
[1:25:51] any opinion to the table but may i just
[1:25:54] open my mouth as you ask of me so many
[1:25:57] years ago and let you fill it with your
[1:26:00] life-giving word
[1:26:02] and then when we're done we will give
[1:26:04] you the glory
[1:26:06] and all the honor and all the praise
[1:26:10] for anything that is accomplished today
[1:26:12] to god be the glory we ask for this help
[1:26:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:26:19] for his glory only amen and the church
[1:26:22] said
[1:26:24] you may be seated
[1:26:28] freedom is a choice
[1:26:31] it's a choice jesus did everything that
[1:26:35] could possibly be done
[1:26:37] that needed to be done to set us free
[1:26:40] from the law of sin and death he paid an
[1:26:44] ultimate price
[1:26:45] he did everything that the law required
[1:26:48] to be done he didn't just shed the
[1:26:51] lamb's blood he shed god's blood
[1:26:54] god that had specifically designed a
[1:26:58] blood that could redeem mankind
[1:27:02] throughout all the ages you and i are
[1:27:05] the beneficiaries of something that we
[1:27:07] don't deserve that's why it's amazing
[1:27:10] grace we don't understand it we know
[1:27:13] every day that we don't deserve it but
[1:27:16] we realize that god has given it to us
[1:27:18] anyway why because he loved us
[1:27:21] we know that we didn't choose him
[1:27:25] until he had already chosen us where do
[1:27:27] you get that the bible said you have not
[1:27:30] chosen me but i have chosen you says the
[1:27:33] lord we understand that no man has ever
[1:27:37] sought god at any time by his own mind
[1:27:42] if a man or woman has ever sought god
[1:27:45] it's because god was seeking after that
[1:27:49] man or woman
[1:27:50] he found you right where you were how
[1:27:53] many of you're glad you didn't have to
[1:27:54] come up to where he was
[1:27:57] he reached way below the bottom and met
[1:28:01] you in your sin
[1:28:03] if you can say a man do
[1:28:06] found you right where you were some of
[1:28:08] you he found you in some mighty rough
[1:28:10] places
[1:28:12] but he found you nonetheless
[1:28:14] and he didn't just leave you he stayed
[1:28:17] with you and hovered around you and
[1:28:19] called your name and pulled on your
[1:28:21] heart
[1:28:22] whispered in your ear
[1:28:25] protected you from death
[1:28:27] the very reason some of you are here
[1:28:29] today is because god kept you from death
[1:28:33] that he might have time to redeem you
[1:28:36] and present you
[1:28:38] as that chaste virgin that the word is
[1:28:41] making us in this hour we're being
[1:28:44] purified by the word
[1:28:46] the very stain of sin is being erased
[1:28:50] and what the curse has brought into our
[1:28:53] lives we are now seeing it reversed by
[1:28:56] the living word
[1:28:58] the earth around us is living under the
[1:29:00] weight and the load of the curse but the
[1:29:03] bride of jesus christ is coming out from
[1:29:07] under that curse
[1:29:08] and the world is getting worldlier and
[1:29:11] sicker and in more trouble but the bride
[1:29:14] is becoming more like her bridegroom
[1:29:17] every day that we live
[1:29:19] how is that possible not by watching
[1:29:22] television all the time
[1:29:29] you spend all your time in front of the
[1:29:31] idiot box and you'll end up being one
[1:29:34] can anybody say amen
[1:29:37] even talk radio will pickle your brain
[1:29:40] there's only one thing that'll make you
[1:29:42] more like christ
[1:29:44] and that's the word
[1:29:47] we're not just faced with a dead letter
[1:29:50] but we have a living word
[1:29:53] and this living word is more than a
[1:29:56] sermon he is a person
[1:29:58] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[1:30:02] he has broken every chain
[1:30:05] every fetter he has power to set every
[1:30:08] captive free he has blown the silver
[1:30:12] trumpet of the jubilee so that every
[1:30:15] slave who can hear the voice of the
[1:30:18] trumpet it's not just a sign that god
[1:30:22] sends to us but with every god-sent sign
[1:30:26] there is a voice
[1:30:28] and only a little bride can seem to
[1:30:31] discern the voice that is in the trumpet
[1:30:35] there's a voice in the seals
[1:30:38] there's a voice in the church ages
[1:30:41] there's a voice in the thunders
[1:30:44] it's god speaking to his bride in these
[1:30:48] last days calling us to come higher
[1:30:51] telling us church is not the answer
[1:30:54] telling us are you with me
[1:30:56] telling us religion is not the answer
[1:30:59] there's only one answer and that's a
[1:31:01] relationship
[1:31:03] with jesus christ not twice a week
[1:31:09] every single day of the week
[1:31:12] every single day of the month a close
[1:31:16] relationship with him i think it
[1:31:18] sometimes baffles minds to find out that
[1:31:22] you can have that kind of a walk with
[1:31:24] him where he walks with you and talks
[1:31:27] with you and deals with you every single
[1:31:30] day of your life but he does
[1:31:33] somebody said i know i'm not
[1:31:35] experiencing that it's not his fault
[1:31:38] who's going to blame the lord
[1:31:41] we're going to blame ourselves and we're
[1:31:43] going to say we have filled our minds
[1:31:45] with so many things computer games and
[1:31:49] pornographies and all the things that
[1:31:51] that fill us up
[1:31:53] so there's no room for a relationship
[1:31:56] with jesus christ
[1:31:58] people sometimes come and complain
[1:32:00] because our services are long but
[1:32:02] they'll sit through one of those eternal
[1:32:04] football games
[1:32:10] there's nothing any more disgustingly
[1:32:13] boring
[1:32:16] than all of those people falling down
[1:32:18] all the time
[1:32:23] i've watched a few with my voice in the
[1:32:25] past
[1:32:27] thank god we're almost at a place where
[1:32:28] we don't have to do anything like that
[1:32:30] now
[1:32:31] and i said look we could be done with
[1:32:33] this
[1:32:35] they're playing games with us
[1:32:37] this thing could be over with but they
[1:32:40] keep falling down
[1:32:42] pulling one another down and
[1:32:45] those little black and white stripes you
[1:32:47] know
[1:32:48] hulking their horns and blowing their
[1:32:50] whistles and throwing their red flags
[1:32:53] and orange flags and yellow flags
[1:32:56] just drawing it out
[1:32:58] and if you if you didn't see it the
[1:33:00] first time
[1:33:03] don't worry they're gonna show it to you
[1:33:06] five more times
[1:33:08] before the next play
[1:33:10] they've even got cameras down on the
[1:33:13] field
[1:33:14] in the cones
[1:33:18] in the cones
[1:33:20] how do you know because i was watching
[1:33:22] one time and one got kicked over and the
[1:33:24] cameras flipping through the air and
[1:33:26] they're in a hurry to turn it back to a
[1:33:28] camera where you can see and all the pop
[1:33:31] and the circumstance and the and the
[1:33:34] hoochie mamas out on the field
[1:33:39] well they're hiding in hanging out of
[1:33:41] their drawers
[1:33:42] come on
[1:33:44] and people will sit there and give three
[1:33:46] hours four hours
[1:33:48] won't even get up to go to the bathroom
[1:33:53] so don't you come to the house of god
[1:33:55] and get in a hurry
[1:33:57] because you're not going to get anything
[1:33:59] out of that but a little bit of
[1:34:01] entertainment
[1:34:02] but when you come to the house of god
[1:34:04] ready to worship ready to engage the
[1:34:08] holy spirit
[1:34:09] you make up your mind i didn't come to
[1:34:12] be a spectator i came to be in the
[1:34:15] middle to be a participator
[1:34:18] to put everything i've got into this
[1:34:22] so that i can take something out
[1:34:25] hallelujah
[1:34:26] well don't mind us brother shelly we're
[1:34:29] we're
[1:34:30] we're too busy to listening to amen
[1:34:38] the power of agreement
[1:34:40] is found in the amen
[1:34:44] when you say amen you're saying i
[1:34:47] receive that into my life as the
[1:34:50] absolute truth
[1:34:53] and not only do i acknowledge it as the
[1:34:55] truth but i receive every benefit
[1:34:57] attached to that truth every blessing
[1:35:00] attached to that truth
[1:35:03] we like to use the example when our kids
[1:35:05] were growing up we had a shabbat meal
[1:35:08] every friday evening to honor
[1:35:11] uh this great tradition of pulling the
[1:35:14] family together
[1:35:17] i lost loved ones in the holocaust and
[1:35:20] and by the grace of god some of my
[1:35:22] family was able
[1:35:23] to escape and establish themselves in
[1:35:27] this nation and hide
[1:35:29] their jewishness
[1:35:31] in a time when even in america
[1:35:34] it wasn't safe to be jewish
[1:35:37] and so as an honor and respect
[1:35:40] to those who paid such a price
[1:35:43] for many years every friday night
[1:35:46] we cancelled every plan we did
[1:35:48] everything around that friday night
[1:35:52] and we have a time where the mother of
[1:35:54] the house is blessed and the father of
[1:35:56] the house is blessed
[1:35:58] and the daughters are blessed and the
[1:36:00] sons are blessed
[1:36:02] we read the scriptures to to pronounce
[1:36:04] this blessing over their lives and it
[1:36:07] was mandatory for us to say when our
[1:36:10] blessing was read amen
[1:36:14] it means
[1:36:15] yes i accept it
[1:36:18] and i intend to personify that
[1:36:22] to make that a living
[1:36:24] reality in my life
[1:36:27] when we bless our daughters and we say
[1:36:29] oh god may may they be like rebecca may
[1:36:33] they be like rachel may they be like
[1:36:34] leia and those little girls my beautiful
[1:36:37] little blond-headed girls would look up
[1:36:39] at us and say amen
[1:36:43] when we prayed over the boys may abba
[1:36:46] make you like ephraim and manasseh and
[1:36:48] they look up us even from the time they
[1:36:51] were tiny and say amen it means may i be
[1:36:55] the personification of what is being
[1:36:58] pronounced over my life so when the word
[1:37:00] goes forth and you say amen
[1:37:04] you are saying oh god i know that is the
[1:37:07] truth it's not just the truth it's my
[1:37:10] truth
[1:37:12] i own that truth
[1:37:14] i am that truth
[1:37:17] hallelujah we're not looking for revival
[1:37:20] somewhere we are
[1:37:22] revival
[1:37:24] that's what the word says we are revival
[1:37:27] we are the personification of a people
[1:37:30] who were once enslaved
[1:37:34] but by the beautiful grace and mercy of
[1:37:36] god we have now been set free and we are
[1:37:40] saying amen may i be the personification
[1:37:44] of freedom
[1:37:46] may i be the demonstration of liberty
[1:37:50] and may i never waste
[1:37:54] may i never squander freedom
[1:37:59] may i never use my freedom as an
[1:38:02] occasion to sin
[1:38:06] like a lot of people like to talk about
[1:38:08] being free from the law
[1:38:10] and the reason why they celebrate their
[1:38:12] freedom from the law is so that they can
[1:38:14] sin
[1:38:15] but god did not give us grace
[1:38:18] so that we have a license to live in
[1:38:20] unbelief
[1:38:22] hallelujah he gave us grace so that we
[1:38:25] might know what it means to receive
[1:38:28] something other than what we deserve
[1:38:30] if we get what we deserve it would be
[1:38:32] death
[1:38:33] and hell
[1:38:35] but thanks be to god he chose something
[1:38:37] else for us now how can we live slack
[1:38:42] how can we squander this grace
[1:38:44] how can we waste this freedom
[1:38:48] how can we be satisfied to live with
[1:38:51] vices in our life
[1:38:54] how can we be satisfied to hold on to
[1:38:57] habits that are destroying us
[1:39:01] how can we hold on to things that are
[1:39:04] affecting our marriage
[1:39:08] and the way we interact with our
[1:39:10] children
[1:39:12] how can we how can we squander this
[1:39:14] great gift that god has given does not
[1:39:18] the lamb deserve to receive the reward
[1:39:22] for his suffering
[1:39:26] shouldn't it be more than our verbal
[1:39:28] amen
[1:39:29] shouldn't it be the amen of our life
[1:39:32] shouldn't it be the amen of our choices
[1:39:35] i want you to give him praise just a
[1:39:37] moment go ahead he's worthy he's worthy
[1:39:46] we are faced
[1:39:48] with choices all the time
[1:39:51] all the time we choose we can choose
[1:39:54] anger
[1:39:57] we can choose jealousy
[1:40:00] it's easy to be jealous
[1:40:02] it's easy
[1:40:03] don't look at me like it's not
[1:40:06] it's easy to be jealous
[1:40:09] some of you ought to know you're experts
[1:40:11] at it
[1:40:15] you can teach us how to be jealous
[1:40:18] you've allowed that to swallow up your
[1:40:20] life
[1:40:22] come on
[1:40:23] it's a choice
[1:40:25] you can be free from that
[1:40:27] jesus paid the price
[1:40:29] for you to not only be free from
[1:40:31] unbelief but to also be free from
[1:40:33] jealousy
[1:40:34] you don't have to choose resentment
[1:40:38] quit comparing your life to somebody
[1:40:40] else's life
[1:40:42] quit comparing your family to somebody
[1:40:44] else's family
[1:40:46] quit comparing your car to somebody
[1:40:48] else's car get out from under that and
[1:40:51] remember we're all sinners that have
[1:40:54] been saved by grace
[1:40:56] the ground is level at the foot of the
[1:40:58] cross there are no big iams and little b
[1:41:01] little others no sir we are all just
[1:41:06] participants
[1:41:08] in the marvelous plan of salvation the
[1:41:11] grace
[1:41:12] and the mercies of the living god
[1:41:14] we have no pride in being bride
[1:41:18] we have no pride because we're chosen
[1:41:21] it should make us the most humble people
[1:41:24] in all the world
[1:41:25] if you folk really understood
[1:41:28] the glory of receiving the message that
[1:41:32] we have received
[1:41:34] if you really could see the one in the
[1:41:36] million value
[1:41:38] of being one in a million
[1:41:41] that would hear the word and respond
[1:41:44] with your life if you could see the
[1:41:46] value in that
[1:41:48] no price would be too great
[1:41:56] then a woman would never complain about
[1:41:58] having to do her hair a certain way or
[1:42:01] having to wear a certain thing or a man
[1:42:04] having to make some choices because i
[1:42:06] want you to know a man
[1:42:08] being modest is just as important in
[1:42:11] this hour as a woman being modest
[1:42:13] because so many of those lines are being
[1:42:16] blurred today
[1:42:18] pronoun confusion is a much deeper
[1:42:20] problem than pronouns
[1:42:22] come on
[1:42:24] and so it's important for us to be
[1:42:26] willing to be a little bit of a gazing
[1:42:28] stock
[1:42:30] to the world around us
[1:42:32] it's important that we don't let that
[1:42:34] cause us to resent who we are or to be
[1:42:37] ashamed of who we are we're called to be
[1:42:40] a parable
[1:42:42] you are walking in a parabolic anointing
[1:42:45] in an hour where it's so easy to go with
[1:42:48] the flow
[1:42:50] because i saw thousands of jellyfish
[1:42:55] blobs of gunk in the water
[1:42:58] jelly bubbles
[1:42:59] these other little creatures that you
[1:43:01] see that look like jellyfish but they're
[1:43:03] not
[1:43:04] and they don't sting but if you don't
[1:43:06] know what you're looking at you think
[1:43:08] you're looking at a jellyfish thousands
[1:43:10] and thousands of them and when they
[1:43:12] analyze the little creatures that they
[1:43:14] are they find out that they have more in
[1:43:16] common with humans
[1:43:18] than they do with jellyfish
[1:43:21] because they have more similar tissue
[1:43:24] when you pick them up they just it just
[1:43:26] kind of just kind of disintegrates in
[1:43:28] your hand there's nothing there but it
[1:43:31] sure uses that likeness to the jellyfish
[1:43:34] to survive because people get away from
[1:43:36] it not realizing all you have to do is
[1:43:37] pick it up with your hand and it just
[1:43:39] how many of you have ever seen them and
[1:43:40] you know what i'm talking about there's
[1:43:42] thousands of them there
[1:43:44] any of those blobs
[1:43:46] any jellyfish down there can just float
[1:43:49] around with the way the waves are
[1:43:50] turning and the way the current
[1:43:53] any old jellyfish can float down the
[1:43:56] stream
[1:43:57] in the right direction of the current
[1:44:00] but it takes something with a backbone
[1:44:03] it takes something with a vertebrae take
[1:44:06] something with a skeleton
[1:44:08] to say i don't have to go the way of the
[1:44:10] world around me i don't have to follow
[1:44:12] society around me i've got a made-up
[1:44:15] mind to follow jesus christ and his word
[1:44:20] is my example no matter what the
[1:44:22] co-worker thinks about me
[1:44:26] we can't trust in our little trinkets
[1:44:29] and
[1:44:31] her little
[1:44:32] treasures
[1:44:34] so many of the jewish people that i have
[1:44:37] known through the years especially those
[1:44:39] in jerusalem they're trusting in rituals
[1:44:41] and they're trusting in traditions and
[1:44:44] and whether they can ring the chicken's
[1:44:46] neck just right and all of these kinds
[1:44:49] of things to be right
[1:44:51] when all they have to do and they will
[1:44:53] they will they will in time all they
[1:44:55] have to do is open their heart
[1:44:58] and receive jesus as their savior
[1:45:01] and then they can live
[1:45:02] peace knowing
[1:45:04] that if i if i get something wrong he's
[1:45:07] there to pull me back and to woo me in
[1:45:10] and to forgive me and to show me mercy
[1:45:12] and grace if i'm willing to repent i
[1:45:15] just think repentance should be a
[1:45:17] practice it shouldn't be an event it
[1:45:19] should be a lifestyle we should just
[1:45:21] walk with a repentant heart before the
[1:45:23] lord lord forgive me lord have mercy on
[1:45:26] me lord help me not to be that person
[1:45:29] help me to be stronger than that so with
[1:45:31] everything that jesus has done for us
[1:45:34] how could we squander that
[1:45:36] by living below our freedom level
[1:45:39] you see that's why i say freedom is a
[1:45:41] choice we choose to allow the lord to
[1:45:44] deliver and set us free and then we
[1:45:46] choose daily and sometimes multiple
[1:45:48] times to stay in that freedom instead of
[1:45:52] holding on to resentment instead of
[1:45:54] holding on to unforgiveness
[1:45:58] instead of holding on to wrongs that
[1:46:01] have been done to us
[1:46:02] we choose not to be enslaved by
[1:46:06] unforgiveness we choose not to be
[1:46:08] enslaved by repeating and rehearsing
[1:46:12] every detail
[1:46:15] over and over and over and over and over
[1:46:18] again in our mind we make a conscious
[1:46:21] decision to choose freedom and in order
[1:46:23] to choose freedom we say i'm not going
[1:46:25] back there i'm not going through that
[1:46:27] thought process anymore i'm not walking
[1:46:30] through that hurt anymore i'm not going
[1:46:32] through the details of that betrayal
[1:46:34] anymore are you listening i'm leaving
[1:46:38] that under the blood of jesus christ i
[1:46:40] choose to forgive
[1:46:43] i'm not waiting on an apology i choose
[1:46:46] to forgive because i've been forgiven
[1:46:49] i choose not to be resentful but to and
[1:46:52] if i can embrace
[1:46:54] in this earth i can embrace in prayer
[1:46:59] if there are people that i can't walk
[1:47:01] with in fellowship through this life
[1:47:03] because of something that has transpired
[1:47:05] i don't have to forsake them in prayer
[1:47:08] i can call their name before the lord
[1:47:11] just like i would if i was walking in
[1:47:14] fellowship with them i don't forget them
[1:47:16] because i can't eat dinner with them
[1:47:18] i still have a responsibility when he
[1:47:21] allows it that we would would continue
[1:47:23] to say oh god deliver help lead guide
[1:47:27] direct protect
[1:47:30] keep these loved ones
[1:47:32] may i not harbor any ill will i'm
[1:47:34] preaching to somebody
[1:47:37] may i not harbor any ill will
[1:47:41] may i let it go because i choose freedom
[1:47:45] i choose to walk in to maintain
[1:47:47] deliverance
[1:47:49] you see it's our responsibility
[1:47:51] in a message called god doesn't call man
[1:47:54] to judgment without first warning him
[1:47:58] i may have shared this one with you
[1:48:00] the last sunday that i was here
[1:48:03] it talks about the responsibility that
[1:48:05] we have as believers he said now because
[1:48:09] we have a responsibility that we've got
[1:48:12] to answer to god someday for
[1:48:14] every man that come on the face of the
[1:48:18] earth has to answer to god for a
[1:48:22] responsibility and to and i'm not done
[1:48:28] and to many of us
[1:48:30] a stewardship
[1:48:32] we have to answer for just a moment
[1:48:35] there
[1:48:36] you and i are stewards of a truth
[1:48:42] we have been entrusted
[1:48:45] with the truth
[1:48:46] and we are going to be held responsible
[1:48:50] for the way we represent that truth
[1:48:57] when everybody's looking
[1:48:59] and when nobody you know is looking
[1:49:02] anybody with me
[1:49:04] we're going to be responsible for how we
[1:49:06] represent that truth in the world and to
[1:49:08] many of us it's a stewardship we have to
[1:49:11] answer for let's move on
[1:49:14] we
[1:49:15] this responsibility is a stewardship
[1:49:18] that's been committed to us by god i
[1:49:21] don't care what it is as i said a few
[1:49:24] moments ago a housewife
[1:49:30] then be a genuine housewife
[1:49:34] that's right if it's to be a farmer be a
[1:49:37] genuine farmer
[1:49:39] whatever it is that god has put you to
[1:49:41] do you've got a stewardship to that
[1:49:45] you've got to answer to god for because
[1:49:48] it takes all of these things to do it
[1:49:52] you're not living your life in in
[1:49:55] jealousy and comparing your your life
[1:49:58] your easy life i mean your very
[1:50:01] difficult life to someone else's easy
[1:50:04] life if you get caught up in that oh if
[1:50:06] they'd have been through what i'd have
[1:50:08] been through they'd be as bitter as i am
[1:50:13] you're choosing bitterness
[1:50:15] you're choosing to live there you're
[1:50:17] making yourself a continuous victim
[1:50:21] there's such a spirit in this nation
[1:50:23] right now and i'm not here this morning
[1:50:25] to shame the victim i'm here to tell you
[1:50:27] you have a choice
[1:50:29] you don't have to live under the
[1:50:30] responsibility of maintaining the
[1:50:33] mentality of someone who is a victim
[1:50:36] you have the grace of god and the
[1:50:38] responsibility to maintain the lifestyle
[1:50:41] of someone who has been set free
[1:50:45] from everything that satan sent your way
[1:50:49] to warp your life to hinder your life
[1:50:52] to handicap your life
[1:50:55] you don't have to live under that we're
[1:50:57] living in an hour where all of society
[1:50:59] seems to be emphasizing this
[1:51:02] this victim
[1:51:04] thought and and there's no one to to to
[1:51:08] help because
[1:51:10] all the helpers are victims
[1:51:15] and so it's no longer just about race
[1:51:18] it's about everything
[1:51:21] we've been betrayed by our parents so
[1:51:23] what
[1:51:27] jesus has come
[1:51:30] to heal you of every wound
[1:51:33] to heal you of every hurt
[1:51:35] he's the best mama that anybody could
[1:51:37] ever have
[1:51:39] he's the best daddy that anybody could
[1:51:41] ever have you don't have to live
[1:51:43] handicapped
[1:51:46] he proved it to me in my own life i
[1:51:48] didn't have a father and so i was
[1:51:50] fearful
[1:51:53] of how i would be a daddy
[1:51:55] when i had never had a daddy to be
[1:51:58] someone to be a daddy to me
[1:52:00] and my fear
[1:52:01] almost took my life at times
[1:52:05] holding me back from what god had for me
[1:52:09] i had to trust him i had to say even
[1:52:12] though i never had a father as an
[1:52:14] example i had a heavenly father
[1:52:16] he is my example and if i trust him
[1:52:19] he'll help me be the dad that he would
[1:52:21] have me to be
[1:52:23] all of us have to come to that kind of
[1:52:25] understanding when we choose to walk in
[1:52:28] freedom it means we choose not to be
[1:52:31] handicapped spiritually by the past we
[1:52:34] choose to let the past be the past and
[1:52:36] we're living in the present now we keep
[1:52:39] one eye on eternity and one eye on the
[1:52:42] present and we refuse to live at all in
[1:52:46] yesterday
[1:52:48] we refuse
[1:52:50] we take what god let us learn
[1:52:53] from the past
[1:52:54] and we leave the hurt and the wounds
[1:52:57] and the pain
[1:52:59] is it easy i didn't say it was easy i
[1:53:01] said it's possible because jesus has
[1:53:04] paid the price
[1:53:05] and all what he does when he heals us
[1:53:08] somebody said well i'm not healed you
[1:53:10] have you asked him have you nailed your
[1:53:13] have you bowed your knee have you knelt
[1:53:14] before have you said lord heal me
[1:53:17] i want to be healed of all the hurt and
[1:53:20] the past all the stuff that i feel like
[1:53:22] still affects me today i want you to
[1:53:25] heal me
[1:53:27] i want you to soothe me
[1:53:30] i want you to remold me and remake me
[1:53:32] and reshape me i want you to recreate me
[1:53:36] hallelujah because that's who you are
[1:53:39] i want you to give me a new lease
[1:53:42] on life
[1:53:43] and i want you to help me have strength
[1:53:46] to keep choosing freedom
[1:53:48] instead of bondage
[1:53:50] i forgive
[1:53:53] i forgive you
[1:53:55] do it i forgive you
[1:53:58] make up your mind to walk in that
[1:54:00] somebody said how's it possible because
[1:54:01] he forgave us
[1:54:03] how many times how many times oh so many
[1:54:06] times way more than 70 times seven
[1:54:09] wouldn't you agree
[1:54:10] he just still forgives he forgives you
[1:54:12] right now if you need his forgiveness
[1:54:14] right now all you have to do is look to
[1:54:16] him and ask him
[1:54:18] and it's there
[1:54:20] in a message called a prisoner
[1:54:22] he said now we're all born
[1:54:24] a free moral agent to make any decision
[1:54:28] that we wish to god justly does that
[1:54:31] because he must put every man on the
[1:54:33] same basis
[1:54:34] or he put the wrong put the first man on
[1:54:37] the wrong basis that he'd have to put on
[1:54:40] free moral agency see
[1:54:43] he said we're just exactly tonight like
[1:54:46] adam and eve there's no different
[1:54:48] right and wrong
[1:54:50] sets before either one of us
[1:54:54] life and death
[1:54:56] we can make our choice
[1:54:58] it's up to you to make it see
[1:55:01] he said that's the way adam and eve did
[1:55:03] and they made the wrong choice
[1:55:05] and now by that put the whole race the
[1:55:08] human race under death
[1:55:10] the penalty of death
[1:55:12] and then god came down oh yes
[1:55:16] oh it's good news it it it never gets
[1:55:19] old
[1:55:20] and then god came down in the form of a
[1:55:22] man and took that death
[1:55:25] paid the penalty of that death that his
[1:55:28] subjects to be free
[1:55:31] those that desired to his subjects that
[1:55:34] desire to to be free they could
[1:55:38] go
[1:55:38] free is that your desire
[1:55:41] it's not your desire
[1:55:43] all right and then i want to go to what
[1:55:45] was the holy ghost given for follow me
[1:55:47] with this if you give me just a little
[1:55:49] more time what was the holy ghost given
[1:55:51] for paragraph 137
[1:55:54] you're going to be filled up with
[1:55:55] something
[1:55:57] he said what are we going to do amen
[1:55:59] what are we going to do each person
[1:56:01] sitting here is filled with something
[1:56:04] and i'm going to close after that he
[1:56:07] said
[1:56:08] you're filled with something
[1:56:09] you can't sit there without being full
[1:56:11] of something
[1:56:13] so i want you to know sitting here today
[1:56:14] you're full of something
[1:56:18] he said you've got a life in you
[1:56:21] that life governs you
[1:56:23] and that life is governed by spirit
[1:56:28] now you might be full of the world
[1:56:29] loving the world or the things of the
[1:56:31] world god be merciful to you
[1:56:34] you might be full of creeds from some
[1:56:37] church some little prayers that you say
[1:56:40] you think it's going to pray to some
[1:56:42] dead person or make some kind of a sign
[1:56:44] across you god be merciful to you
[1:56:49] he said you may be full of religion
[1:56:52] i want you to look at what he said
[1:56:57] and that's worse yet
[1:57:00] you see it's not religion
[1:57:02] it's not going through the motion
[1:57:05] it's relationship
[1:57:07] he said the bible said in the last days
[1:57:09] they'd be very religious
[1:57:11] having a form of godliness
[1:57:13] but denying the power thereof
[1:57:16] from such turn away
[1:57:18] he said if you're all full of religion
[1:57:20] you're miserable just religion that's
[1:57:22] all if you're full of creed you don't
[1:57:24] know what you're talking about if you're
[1:57:26] full of the world you're blind
[1:57:28] and then again
[1:57:30] you may be full of the holy ghost amen
[1:57:34] see if you're just full of religion
[1:57:36] you're just full of rules and and
[1:57:38] regulations and stipulations and
[1:57:43] your mind stays on measuring up
[1:57:49] this is not what holiness is about
[1:57:53] it's not to keep your mind on measuring
[1:57:55] up all the time
[1:57:56] it's to keep your mind on your testimony
[1:58:00] you're thinking always of christ but
[1:58:02] you're thinking about the testimony that
[1:58:04] you're leaving
[1:58:05] so you choose to do and not to do some
[1:58:08] things because you understand that
[1:58:10] you're called as a minister to somebody
[1:58:12] you're called in ministry to somebody
[1:58:15] and they're watching your life so you're
[1:58:17] not fearful
[1:58:18] of being kicked out or put out of the
[1:58:20] church
[1:58:21] they're not living in fear of that
[1:58:25] religion will do that to you
[1:58:28] he said then you may be full of the holy
[1:58:30] ghost amen i hope you are and if you're
[1:58:32] not i hope you get full
[1:58:34] and if you're full of the holy ghost
[1:58:36] what you got you tell me
[1:58:39] you got power
[1:58:41] you got love you got peace
[1:58:45] even in the midst of the war
[1:58:48] you got power you got love you got peace
[1:58:52] even in all the rejection of your family
[1:58:55] guess what you got you got power
[1:58:58] you got love you got peace
[1:59:01] when you walk into the room on your job
[1:59:03] and everybody whispers and giggles and
[1:59:05] nods and punches one another in the ribs
[1:59:08] let me tell you what you got
[1:59:10] you got power
[1:59:13] you got love
[1:59:14] you got peace when you go to school
[1:59:17] some little sister goes to school and
[1:59:20] and
[1:59:21] and they're all sitting there in men's
[1:59:23] clothing and tight pants and and they
[1:59:26] look at you and you go in there with a
[1:59:28] skirt on and they laugh at you and they
[1:59:30] make fun of you they have something
[1:59:31] ridiculous to say about you maybe they
[1:59:34] call you a pilgrim
[1:59:40] maybe they call you amish
[1:59:44] some of you have been called amish
[1:59:47] some of you've been called pilgrims
[1:59:50] if they ever see that you just say
[1:59:52] that's exactly what i am the bible said
[1:59:54] i'm a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:59:59] this is what the scripture said and
[2:00:01] they're making fun of you and and you
[2:00:03] know we get older it doesn't matter
[2:00:06] we get used to it
[2:00:08] but these young ones
[2:00:10] i remember it very well i've told you
[2:00:12] many times
[2:00:14] they fell on the football field and
[2:00:16] rolled around in the dirt
[2:00:19] looked at me singing holy roller holy
[2:00:21] roller holy roller
[2:00:24] i'd say you baboons get up from there
[2:00:29] get up from there
[2:00:30] yes that's what i am i'm a holy roller
[2:00:34] and i'd rather roll into heaven than
[2:00:36] strut into
[2:00:39] i'm not hell going about my business
[2:00:42] and i've told you this so many times
[2:00:44] maybe you're hearing you unheard it we'd
[2:00:45] go back to the locker room
[2:00:47] and they would pull me off to the side
[2:00:52] nobody listening
[2:00:54] nobody watching and they'd say preacher
[2:00:57] my grandmother's sick in the hospital
[2:00:59] with a heart attack and i don't want to
[2:01:01] lose my grandmother you don't understand
[2:01:04] preacher i can't lose my
[2:01:06] grandmother will you get to the hospital
[2:01:10] to pray for my grandmother

[2:01:14] not not their buddies the same ones that
[2:01:16] had just been making fun of me and
[2:01:18] calling me a holy roller would ask me to
[2:01:21] pray and you know what i did
[2:01:23] i made my way to the hospital
[2:01:26] i prayed for dozens of grannies during
[2:01:28] my school career or they would say
[2:01:30] preacher my mom and dad are just about
[2:01:33] to get a divorce i don't want to live in
[2:01:35] a broken home
[2:01:37] pray that god will undertake i'd go back
[2:01:40] later and ask them they'd say
[2:01:41] all i can tell you is prayer's working
[2:01:43] things are getting better many times
[2:01:45] they would say things are getting better
[2:01:48] i run into people in town now all these
[2:01:51] years later and i and i greet them or
[2:01:53] they say hey steve how are you doing or
[2:01:55] they reach out to me on facebook and i
[2:01:58] remember
[2:02:00] i remember how they how they were how
[2:02:03] they acted how they made fun
[2:02:05] and how they asked for prayer
[2:02:09] i also remember the times that god would
[2:02:11] send real revivals to my friends
[2:02:14] i remember some of the times that those
[2:02:16] who would make fun of me i would have
[2:02:18] the courage to ask them to come to
[2:02:19] revival service
[2:02:22] i remember the the boy named chris who
[2:02:25] was a good friend of mine in high school
[2:02:28] i've been trying to get up the courage i
[2:02:30] needed to invite him to revival service
[2:02:33] and finally i got it
[2:02:35] and he drove a trans am
[2:02:38] that was pretty cool at the time you
[2:02:40] know
[2:02:41] and he said i'll go to revival under one
[2:02:43] condition
[2:02:45] i said what's that he said if you'll let
[2:02:46] me pick you up and take you in my trans
[2:02:48] ham
[2:02:51] i said well i just don't know
[2:02:53] about a holiness preacher arriving in
[2:02:55] the
[2:02:56] church in a red trans am
[2:02:59] but i guess i can
[2:03:02] he picked me up for church and took me
[2:03:05] in that red translam and
[2:03:07] he said i got something cold in the
[2:03:09] cooler in the back
[2:03:10] if you think you got nerves and need to
[2:03:12] relax a little bit before you preach
[2:03:15] i said chris you don't get it do you
[2:03:18] you don't really get the point do you he
[2:03:19] said oh no i'm just picking at you
[2:03:22] he says it's a sprite
[2:03:28] oh i got stories
[2:03:30] more stories in time
[2:03:33] of how god would meet in those revival
[2:03:35] services chris gave his heart to the
[2:03:38] lord not that night
[2:03:39] but not too many nights later
[2:03:42] same revival
[2:03:44] he said i'm coming back i said you're
[2:03:46] coming back he said yeah i'm coming back
[2:03:49] several nights later he came and gave
[2:03:50] his heart to the lord and before that
[2:03:53] revival was over he'd brought his mom
[2:03:55] and his dad and his hand and his uncle
[2:03:57] and all of them had given their heart to
[2:03:59] the lord
[2:04:02] he said to the pastor of the revival
[2:04:04] he said i i'd like to testify i said oh
[2:04:08] no pastor
[2:04:12] that might not be wise
[2:04:15] i have no idea what he'll say
[2:04:18] he he's very new to the faith
[2:04:22] it might be spicy
[2:04:25] it might be more than the granny skin
[2:04:27] panel i don't know
[2:04:29] he said no steve i feel like we ought to
[2:04:32] we ought to have him
[2:04:34] we ought to have him testify
[2:04:36] and i said okay and he got up with tears
[2:04:39] running down his face
[2:04:41] and he said i used to make fun of him
[2:04:45] i called him every name in the book
[2:04:48] he said i even made fun and mock
[2:04:51] speaking in tongues
[2:04:53] but the grace and mercy of god brought
[2:04:56] me to this revival
[2:04:59] gave me a tug on my heart and i
[2:05:02] surrendered my life to the lord and i
[2:05:04] didn't want to slip around when nobody
[2:05:05] was around and apologize to him like i
[2:05:08] had many times asking him for prayer
[2:05:12] i wanted to ask him to forgive me in
[2:05:14] front of all of you in this service some
[2:05:17] of our classmates there i want him to
[2:05:19] forgive me in front of everybody and i
[2:05:21] want him to know i'll never be guilty of
[2:05:22] that again
[2:05:24] you don't ever know what god wants to do
[2:05:26] in somebody's life
[2:05:28] i still feel for the young people i feel
[2:05:32] for what they may go through and how
[2:05:34] they might be made fun of but i want you
[2:05:36] to know
[2:05:37] you are blessed to live in the hour you
[2:05:40] live in
[2:05:42] because there was once a time you had to
[2:05:44] hide your faith entirely for fear of
[2:05:47] death
[2:05:48] christians were just killed they were
[2:05:51] tortured to death
[2:05:54] stretched apart
[2:05:56] their bellies split often and sulfur
[2:05:58] burned and listen at
[2:06:00] this it wasn't all done by evil tyrants
[2:06:04] either
[2:06:06] some of it was done by the church
[2:06:10] but you can't stop the real seed of god
[2:06:17] oh
[2:06:18] no
[2:06:20] constantine
[2:06:21] couldn't stop the real church queen
[2:06:24] helena couldn't stop the real church
[2:06:28] popes and potentates could not stop the
[2:06:32] real church
[2:06:34] although they tried to wash it from
[2:06:35] history with the very blood of those who
[2:06:39] confessed it
[2:06:41] the true seed of god has marched on and
[2:06:45] on and on and on so church
[2:06:48] we have it easy
[2:06:52] we have it easy
[2:06:55] a little coveted restriction
[2:06:58] and we start screaming persecution
[2:07:03] right
[2:07:04] some little restriction outdoor mask
[2:07:07] and we're just sure that we're being
[2:07:09] persecuted now
[2:07:11] we have never seen
[2:07:13] what's coming to this world
[2:07:16] the persecution's coming
[2:07:19] it's coming
[2:07:20] it's going to not only come
[2:07:22] by the hand of the government
[2:07:25] but it's going to come by the hand of
[2:07:27] false religion
[2:07:28] because when the false church joins with
[2:07:31] politics as the book of revelation tells
[2:07:34] us it will then you've got all the power
[2:07:36] of the church and all the power of the
[2:07:38] government together that's when the real
[2:07:40] persecution is going to take place and
[2:07:42] many of you are blessed to know by
[2:07:44] revelation that before it comes to that
[2:07:47] most serious hour god is provided away
[2:07:52] for those that are his for those that
[2:07:54] are sealed with the genuine power of the
[2:07:57] holy ghost to those who have been
[2:07:59] cleansed by the washing of the water of
[2:08:01] the word to those who have accepted and
[2:08:04] chosen to live in freedom and to walk in
[2:08:06] deliverance god's made a way out
[2:08:09] they're not appointed under wrath
[2:08:12] if you believe that say amen
[2:08:14] i need just a little more time it's just
[2:08:16] one
[2:08:17] give me just a little more time
[2:08:23] so even
[2:08:32] even if you listen
[2:08:34] even if you feel
[2:08:36] some
[2:08:38] ridicule
[2:08:40] you have some difficulty
[2:08:43] you can choose to walk in power
[2:08:46] to walk in love
[2:08:48] to walk in peace
[2:08:50] jesus said my peace i'll give unto you
[2:08:55] not as the world giveth i you
[2:08:59] you got peace
[2:09:01] you're sealed
[2:09:03] got a sign
[2:09:05] amen you've got rest
[2:09:08] you've got joy
[2:09:10] unspeakable and full of glory you're
[2:09:14] anchored oh my that's what you are
[2:09:17] anchored with the holy ghost
[2:09:20] you're full of something
[2:09:22] either the turmoil of the world or
[2:09:25] you're full of the holy ghost
[2:09:27] you're either full of unforgiveness and
[2:09:29] resentment and bitterness and jealousy
[2:09:32] and envying and strife
[2:09:35] or you're filled with the holy ghost
[2:09:37] power
[2:09:39] love
[2:09:40] joy
[2:09:41] peace
[2:09:42] he said you have passed from death unto
[2:09:45] life
[2:09:46] waiting for the general resurrection in
[2:09:50] the last day
[2:09:51] oh what a promise
[2:09:53] oh what a promise
[2:09:55] in the message just once more lord i
[2:09:58] might have to get somebody else to read
[2:10:00] it
[2:10:02] no excuse me i am the resurrection in
[2:10:04] life paragraph 64.
[2:10:08] like the world
[2:10:09] jesus said you cannot serve god and
[2:10:12] mammon mammon is the world
[2:10:15] can't serve god in the world at the same
[2:10:18] time
[2:10:19] we have our choice
[2:10:22] we can be germatized by god
[2:10:25] by his holy spirit and we have eternal
[2:10:30] life
[2:10:31] if we don't when we die that's it
[2:10:34] we're ready for the judgment then
[2:10:37] why we didn't do it then the punishment
[2:10:40] it follows that for rejecting it
[2:10:43] now in the message just once more lord
[2:10:46] he said samson prayed right
[2:10:50] lord let me die
[2:10:52] with these philistines
[2:10:54] oh my
[2:10:55] see what it's going to cost him what if
[2:10:57] god answers his prayer let me die oh i
[2:11:00] like that
[2:11:01] he said was it patrick henry said
[2:11:04] give me liberty
[2:11:06] or give me death
[2:11:08] that's right all right that's it
[2:11:13] read it
[2:11:16] liberty or death
[2:11:18] you see liberty is
[2:11:20] it's a choice
[2:11:22] freedom
[2:11:23] is a choice
[2:11:25] jesus has done everything that he could
[2:11:27] possibly do to set us free
[2:11:30] we're free by the blood
[2:11:32] we're free by his grace
[2:11:35] we're free because of mercy but we have
[2:11:38] a choice to make
[2:11:40] will we choose death
[2:11:42] will we choose to become to become
[2:11:45] entangled enslaved again
[2:11:49] or will we choose liberty he said it's
[2:11:52] back to god
[2:11:54] or death
[2:11:56] what are we going to do
[2:11:59] what are we mimicking
[2:12:01] what are we trying to play
[2:12:03] christianity
[2:12:07] how about giving me just a little more i
[2:12:08] don't see anybody moving toward the mic
[2:12:11] why don't you give me just a little more
[2:12:12] on the microphone
[2:12:14] if the holy ghost
[2:12:16] is still the holy ghost
[2:12:19] that fell at pentecost
[2:12:21] it still does
[2:12:23] the same things it did then
[2:12:28] same power
[2:12:33] won't you come in here or watch this
[2:12:35] service on a stream and make some fun of
[2:12:37] somebody because you saw him stagger a
[2:12:40] little bit
[2:12:42] or dance a little bit or jump a little
[2:12:44] bit when the holy ghost fell on the day
[2:12:46] of pentecost they staggered out of that
[2:12:49] upper room
[2:12:51] until everybody around them said oh
[2:12:53] these men are drunk
[2:12:55] and they're hard drunks
[2:12:58] because they're drunk and it's early in
[2:12:59] the morning
[2:13:01] you know what he said they're already
[2:13:03] drunk
[2:13:04] they got up drinking
[2:13:08] if the holy ghost falls among us
[2:13:12] it'll be the same holy ghost
[2:13:14] then we can accept expect the same power
[2:13:19] the same spirit
[2:13:22] it'll work the same way
[2:13:25] we don't need a council of churches
[2:13:30] we need the bible back in action
[2:13:33] how many of you long to be one of those
[2:13:36] who puts the bible in action in your
[2:13:38] life
[2:13:39] i want the bible to work in my life
[2:13:43] i don't want to say i'm saved but
[2:13:46] i go to church but
[2:13:49] i i do my best but i love the lord but
[2:13:54] i want to take him at his word
[2:13:57] he said that if we don't need a counsel
[2:13:59] we need the bible back in action let's
[2:14:01] go on
[2:14:03] he said now we find out that samson
[2:14:05] prayed right lord
[2:14:07] let me die with the enemy
[2:14:10] i'd rather die right here in the midst
[2:14:12] of my enemy than for god to continue to
[2:14:14] be mocked
[2:14:15] he said die to the enemy that had got
[2:14:17] him that way
[2:14:18] remember he's blind he's just a mess
[2:14:21] if there is anything that people ought
[2:14:23] to pray for tonight thank you i don't
[2:14:25] know i may spit that out
[2:14:29] what if i what if i take somebody out on
[2:14:31] the front row
[2:14:33] bethany you better watch you better
[2:14:35] dodge if you see this flying through the
[2:14:36] air like a torpedo
[2:14:40] did you all know a secret i'm going to
[2:14:42] tell you a secret did you know benjamin
[2:14:44] leads worship with one of these in his
[2:14:45] mouth every sunday
[2:14:50] he must have stronger jaws than i do to
[2:14:52] hold it in play
[2:15:08] there's anything that people ought to
[2:15:09] pray for tonight
[2:15:11] we see the thing that's done this
[2:15:13] it's getting away from the bible
[2:15:16] to a creed
[2:15:23] it started at nicaea
[2:15:27] when they started taking people away
[2:15:28] from the word
[2:15:31] and they started making religion more
[2:15:33] acceptable to the masses
[2:15:36] oh yes
[2:15:37] you just do a little bit of research
[2:15:38] you'll find out there was no holy
[2:15:41] trinity
[2:15:43] until nicean council
[2:15:46] when so many pagan rome romans
[2:15:50] were coming becoming christians they
[2:15:52] were accepting the church
[2:15:56] many of them were accepting the church i
[2:15:58] don't know how many of them were
[2:15:59] accepting jesus
[2:16:02] but they began to be so confused about
[2:16:04] god because they had had so many gods to
[2:16:06] worship and now they're being told hero
[2:16:08] israel the lord god is one
[2:16:11] and so these church fathers they begin
[2:16:13] to try to find a way to explain god
[2:16:17] look folks there's no way there's really
[2:16:19] no way to explain god you have to
[2:16:22] experience him
[2:16:25] he's not a doctrine
[2:16:27] you can explain doctrine but you can
[2:16:29] only experience a person and he's one
[2:16:33] he's one
[2:16:35] but they had to make it more acceptable
[2:16:37] to these pagans who couldn't understand
[2:16:40] god and so the church fathers got
[2:16:42] together and they start developing
[2:16:44] doctrine
[2:16:46] to help explain what the bible said
[2:16:49] and the next thing you know you've got
[2:16:51] all of these creeds
[2:16:53] all of these dogmas all of these ideas
[2:16:57] none of them in the
[2:16:58] bible isn't that amazing none of them in
[2:17:01] the bible
[2:17:03] and what happens to people swallow them
[2:17:07] because it was easier to understand them
[2:17:11] than to make our thoughts and belief
[2:17:13] system match the bible
[2:17:15] so this is the problem today people have
[2:17:17] gotten so far away from the bible to a
[2:17:20] creed
[2:17:22] then die with the thing get out of it
[2:17:24] die to it get out of it die to it get
[2:17:27] out of it die to it
[2:17:30] he said samson was willing to pay the
[2:17:33] price
[2:17:34] to get the power of god back again
[2:17:37] he was willing to go back to that
[2:17:39] nazarite valve that he made
[2:17:41] there is a price to be paid for it
[2:17:45] but today the people don't seem to do it
[2:17:48] now that's where we are
[2:17:50] there's a price to be paid to operate in
[2:17:53] the power of god there's a price to be
[2:17:55] paid to walk in deliverance there's a
[2:17:57] price to be paid but the people don't
[2:18:00] seem to want to pay that price you don't
[2:18:01] be like them you make up your mind i'm
[2:18:04] going to pay this price the lamb is
[2:18:06] going to get the glory he's going to get
[2:18:08] the reward for his suffering in my life
[2:18:11] if i'm the only one
[2:18:14] now let's go to john 8 just a moment
[2:18:16] we'll take just a few more minutes we're
[2:18:18] almost to the end
[2:18:26] i'm
[2:18:27] apologize to you about my voice
[2:18:31] john 8 31 then jesus said to those jews
[2:18:34] which believed on him
[2:18:37] if ye continue
[2:18:39] in my word
[2:18:42] then are ye my disciples indeed
[2:18:45] it's not believing once
[2:18:47] never fellowshipping the word again
[2:18:49] never receiving the word never studying
[2:18:51] never looking in the word again choosing
[2:18:53] your own life depending on the church to
[2:18:56] save you
[2:18:57] this is a relationship
[2:18:59] this is meeting jesus every day in the
[2:19:01] word
[2:19:02] if you continue to abide in my word
[2:19:06] you shall know the truth
[2:19:08] and the truth shall what
[2:19:11] make you free
[2:19:13] then answer they answered him we be
[2:19:15] abraham's seed just like the religion
[2:19:17] just like the
[2:19:18] religious why are you talking to us
[2:19:20] about something like that don't you know
[2:19:22] who we are
[2:19:24] we're sons of abraham we were never in
[2:19:26] bondage to any man that's a lie
[2:19:31] how many of you know that's just a flat
[2:19:32] out lie
[2:19:34] why they were slaves to egypt
[2:19:37] they were slaves to babylon
[2:19:40] they were slaves to the greeks
[2:19:43] they said we've never been in bondage to
[2:19:45] any man how sayest thou ye shall be made
[2:19:49] free
[2:19:50] they answered him we be abraham's seed
[2:19:52] you know
[2:19:53] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[2:19:56] unto you whosoever committeth sin is the
[2:19:59] servant of sin
[2:20:01] and the servant abideth not in the house
[2:20:03] forever but the son abideth ever
[2:20:07] if the son therefore shall make you free
[2:20:10] you read it
[2:20:14] he said i know that you are abraham's
[2:20:16] seed but you seek to kill me
[2:20:19] because my word hath no place in you
[2:20:24] to the most religious men of his time
[2:20:27] he looks to them and says
[2:20:29] you want to kill me
[2:20:31] because my word has no place in you
[2:20:36] you quote the word by memory
[2:20:38] but my word has no place in you folks
[2:20:41] this shows us that religion
[2:20:43] is a cheat
[2:20:46] religion is a counterfeit
[2:20:48] it doesn't take the place of
[2:20:50] relationship
[2:20:52] brother branham goes on to tell us in
[2:20:53] the second seal
[2:20:56] and when a man turns down the gospel
[2:20:59] paragraph 2 16
[2:21:01] and when a man turns down the gospel
[2:21:04] truth
[2:21:05] satan marks him
[2:21:07] where
[2:21:13] at his ear
[2:21:16] do you want to know where these customs
[2:21:18] come from
[2:21:21] i know this will not be pleasant
[2:21:24] some will mumble at their seat
[2:21:29] but it's still the truth
[2:21:32] this is where the whole tradition comes
[2:21:33] from of poking these holes in your body
[2:21:39] when a slave refused
[2:21:41] to take his freedom
[2:21:43] he rather wanted to stay in the house of
[2:21:45] his master
[2:21:50] there was only one way to identify him
[2:21:52] as a perpetual slave
[2:21:56] and that was to take his ear and lay it
[2:21:58] against the door frame
[2:22:01] and pierce it through with an awl
[2:22:05] and they put a hoop
[2:22:09] small hoop
[2:22:10] in that ear
[2:22:13] the other slaves didn't have it
[2:22:16] it's only the slave who said i don't
[2:22:18] want to be free
[2:22:21] i got a better life here you know this
[2:22:23] is terrible hard to say
[2:22:26] but even in our nation we have
[2:22:27] historical records
[2:22:30] that there were some situations where
[2:22:32] where even african slaves said the very
[2:22:35] same thing that they were saying way
[2:22:37] back in egypt
[2:22:39] there were those who
[2:22:41] didn't suffer
[2:22:42] as harshly as others
[2:22:45] and there were those who said i had a
[2:22:47] better life here than i would ever have
[2:22:48] anywhere else
[2:22:50] and there is record that even here in
[2:22:52] america they were still boring the ear
[2:22:56] this ancient tradition
[2:22:58] and putting a hoop in an ear and when so
[2:23:00] when i see this all the time now in
[2:23:02] churches and even men
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:07] the first thing that comes to my mind is
[2:23:09] who are you a slave to
[2:23:11] who is your master
[2:23:17] i i love my mama but i told my mother
[2:23:21] when she had to have more than one hole
[2:23:25] it was fashionable to have more than one
[2:23:27] i said mama who are you a slave to
[2:23:32] i said first of all you're a slave to
[2:23:35] society
[2:23:38] you're a slave to your peers
[2:23:41] and second of all you're a slave to
[2:23:43] satan
[2:23:46] i would want anything to identify myself
[2:23:50] with slavery
[2:23:52] anybody still here
[2:23:56] he deafens him so he can't hear the
[2:23:58] truth he marks him somewhere where the
[2:24:01] ear
[2:24:02] he's finished he stays with that group
[2:24:04] that he's with if he won't hear the
[2:24:05] truth no you shall know the truth and
[2:24:08] the truth shall make you free see the
[2:24:10] truth does what it makes free wow it got
[2:24:15] tight in here
[2:24:18] and there may be those who twist out of
[2:24:20] here saying i'm not giving this up i'm
[2:24:22] not doing that i'm not going to ever do
[2:24:24] different than i do right now let me
[2:24:26] tell you something you don't have any
[2:24:27] idea what you might do when god gets a
[2:24:29] hold of your heart
[2:24:32] you might be glad to be identified with
[2:24:35] the holy rollers
[2:24:37] you might not be embarrassed to be
[2:24:39] identified with the holy rollers when
[2:24:41] god ever gets a hold of your heart just
[2:24:43] right be careful what you say you won't
[2:24:45] ever do
[2:24:46] oh yes
[2:24:48] the truth makes free
[2:24:50] i believe that with all my heart
[2:24:53] is that the end of that one
[2:24:56] yes
[2:24:57] the token
[2:25:00] he said that's a cutting message
[2:25:02] but it's the truth that's what we need
[2:25:04] is truth god help us to know truth you
[2:25:07] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[2:25:11] i claim that jesus christ is the same
[2:25:13] yesterday today and forever i believe
[2:25:16] that god gives the holy ghost as a token
[2:25:18] right now just before the exodus of the
[2:25:21] bride going out of the church i believe
[2:25:24] there is so much tommy rot and people
[2:25:27] saying they shouted they spoke in
[2:25:29] tongues he said i believe in those
[2:25:30] things
[2:25:32] but you can't rely on that
[2:25:35] how many of you can say amen to that how
[2:25:38] can you rely on that and then deny the
[2:25:40] word
[2:25:43] not how much you're shouting not how
[2:25:45] much you're talking tongue
[2:25:46] it's how much you obey the word
[2:25:50] he goes on the token listen
[2:25:54] the token
[2:25:55] is the word
[2:25:57] identified in you
[2:26:00] living itself out
[2:26:03] that's powerful
[2:26:07] the token is the word identified in you
[2:26:10] living itself out that's god's being
[2:26:12] that's god being his own interpreter you
[2:26:14] don't have to say well now you interpret
[2:26:16] my tongue that idiot he interprets your
[2:26:18] life
[2:26:21] by the word
[2:26:23] when he takes your word what you are
[2:26:26] and identify his word through there
[2:26:28] there don't need any interpretation it's
[2:26:30] already there god does his own
[2:26:32] interpretation and we've had these
[2:26:34] promises for the day
[2:26:35] calling jesus on the scene let's do
[2:26:37] these quickly and have them out of the
[2:26:38] way where the battle is
[2:26:41] it's right up where there with satan
[2:26:43] not somebody who kisses the babies and
[2:26:45] buries the dead and carries a pen knife
[2:26:51] but somebody with a two-handed sword
[2:26:53] right up in the front of the battle
[2:26:54] that's the one c that's the thing that
[2:26:56] counts that's where the heat of the
[2:26:58] battle is on that's where the enemy
[2:27:00] stands
[2:27:03] we need some of that
[2:27:05] those who will not be afraid to preach
[2:27:07] the word
[2:27:09] without fear of man without compromise
[2:27:12] and knoweth it not
[2:27:14] if he's a president where is our john
[2:27:16] quincy adams is
[2:27:18] boy i'd like to ask that question today
[2:27:23] if this impostor is our president where
[2:27:26] is our john quincy adams is
[2:27:28] where is our abraham lincoln's men of
[2:27:30] principle where's our patrick henry give
[2:27:32] me liberty give me death where's the man
[2:27:33] that stands for what's right where is a
[2:27:35] man that's not afraid to speak out
[2:27:37] regardless the whole world's against him
[2:27:39] speak out for what's right and stand for
[2:27:41] it and die for it where is our arnold
[2:27:43] von winkleridge again today where is men
[2:27:46] of integrity where is men with spirit
[2:27:48] they're so wishy-washy and gummed up
[2:27:50] until they don't know where they stand
[2:27:51] god let me stand with the principles of
[2:27:54] one man as a minister the word of jesus
[2:27:56] christ for heavens and earth will pass
[2:27:58] away but it'll never fail on this rock
[2:28:00] i'll build my church
[2:28:05] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[2:28:06] against it choosing of a bride we're
[2:28:08] reading fast now
[2:28:12] and it's a dangerous thing to wait
[2:28:14] until that last hour too
[2:28:17] because you may take on something that
[2:28:20] you could never shake out of it
[2:28:27] i've seen it
[2:28:30] i've seen it
[2:28:32] i've seen something take such hold on
[2:28:34] somebody
[2:28:36] that they could not shake out of it
[2:28:40] you listen to me i've seen god bury
[2:28:42] people i've seen god absolutely hide
[2:28:45] people in the grave
[2:28:47] because they could not shake out of what
[2:28:49] had a hold of their life
[2:28:51] and god said i'd rather go saved
[2:28:55] than live a reproach
[2:28:58] somebody said i don't believe in says it
[2:29:00] doesn't matter whether you believe it or
[2:29:00] not
[2:29:03] it's what the word teaches it's what
[2:29:05] it's what life experiences have shown us
[2:29:08] you get to trampling the blood of jesus
[2:29:10] around with your wishy-washy life
[2:29:13] and something take a hold of you that
[2:29:15] you can't get out from under it's grace
[2:29:18] and mercy
[2:29:19] that takes us home
[2:29:22] rather than to leave us here to continue
[2:29:23] to blaspheme the name of jesus are you
[2:29:26] with me
[2:29:28] he said it's a dangerous thing to wait
[2:29:30] till the last hour because you might
[2:29:31] take on something that you could never
[2:29:33] shake out of it you know there is a time
[2:29:34] when you can be warned then if you step
[2:29:36] across that line of warning then you're
[2:29:39] already marked on the other side branded
[2:29:41] he said remember when the jubilee year
[2:29:43] come and the priest rode with the
[2:29:45] trumpet sounding that every slave could
[2:29:47] go free but if they refuse to accept
[2:29:49] their freedom then he had to be taken to
[2:29:51] the temple to a post and an awl bore
[2:29:54] through his ear bore him through the ear
[2:29:56] and then he served his master
[2:30:01] couldn't get out from under it
[2:30:03] it was put on his ear as a type of
[2:30:04] hearing faith cometh by hearing he heard
[2:30:07] the trumpet
[2:30:08] but he didn't want to listen to it
[2:30:12] if any time men and women hear god's
[2:30:14] truth and see it vindicated and proven
[2:30:16] truth but yet they don't want to hear it
[2:30:19] there's some other reason listen
[2:30:22] i want you to i want you to hear
[2:30:23] something
[2:30:25] i wish i could let you hear it
[2:30:28] but it's too personal
[2:30:30] but my wife and i received a voice
[2:30:32] message yesterday
[2:30:34] from a sister
[2:30:37] far away from here
[2:30:40] who said brother shelly i just wanted
[2:30:42] you to know
[2:30:44] what happened
[2:30:47] brother so-and-so
[2:30:49] this is a brother who has just recently
[2:30:52] received
[2:30:53] real deliverance
[2:30:55] in this house
[2:30:57] brother so and so accidentally
[2:31:00] passed by our house yesterday
[2:31:06] and we were really in a crisis
[2:31:09] there were some painful things going on
[2:31:13] we were having a real family crisis
[2:31:17] and god so used that brother
[2:31:23] his deliverance
[2:31:25] was evident
[2:31:27] what god has done in his life
[2:31:30] was evident
[2:31:33] and it was sharp and it was right
[2:31:35] and it spoke to our need and she went on
[2:31:38] for over six minutes
[2:31:40] and she said i just wanted
[2:31:42] to say to you all thank you so much for
[2:31:45] doing what you do
[2:31:46] and loving the way you love
[2:31:48] and giving people an opportunity to find
[2:31:50] deliverance i tell you what folks
[2:31:53] that is to me the most pr even though i
[2:31:55] couldn't just share it right out with
[2:31:57] all
[2:31:57] it's one of the most precious gifts that
[2:31:59] could ever be given
[2:32:02] it's a great amen it's a great
[2:32:04] encouragement to say
[2:32:06] let's keep preaching it let's keep
[2:32:08] creating an atmosphere
[2:32:10] let's keep encouraging people to get
[2:32:12] what they can from god and then choose
[2:32:15] to keep what they get
[2:32:17] let's keep doing all that we can do
[2:32:19] because it's not only making a
[2:32:21] difference in here
[2:32:23] but it's making a difference out there
[2:32:26] because that's what true deliverance
[2:32:28] does
[2:32:31] hallelujah
[2:32:35] they don't want to hear it there's some
[2:32:36] other reason there's some other choosing
[2:32:38] that they have than to face up to the
[2:32:40] truth in fact therefore their ears can
[2:32:42] be closed to the gospel they'll never
[2:32:44] hear it again my advice to you when god
[2:32:46] speaks to your heart you act
[2:32:51] you do what
[2:32:55] you know why elias is here
[2:32:57] because god spoke to his heart
[2:32:59] and what did he do he acted right then
[2:33:02] you know why brother austin's sister
[2:33:04] hannah here god spoke to their heart
[2:33:06] what did they do they acted right then
[2:33:08] rebecca sister rebecca and maya
[2:33:13] why god spoke to their heart they acted
[2:33:15] right then sister claudia god spoke to
[2:33:18] heart she acted right then josh and hope
[2:33:20] brother daniel sister and gospel to
[2:33:22] their heart listen
[2:33:24] you don't have to say i don't know
[2:33:25] anything about this you've got examples
[2:33:29] i'll never forget sister jaya jada
[2:33:34] we love you too sister jaya boy then i'm
[2:33:36] going to tell you something there's a
[2:33:37] lot of names
[2:33:39] jaya maya jada
[2:33:44] you all better be just glad if i point
[2:33:46] at you and talk
[2:33:51] cause sometimes when i'm when i mention
[2:33:52] their name i get them all mixed up
[2:33:55] it's the same thing that got to hold his
[2:33:56] sister jada
[2:33:59] after a sunday service
[2:34:03] who when nathan
[2:34:05] nathan got under inspiration in the
[2:34:07] middle of the sermon and started
[2:34:09] preaching
[2:34:11] and yet there was nothing out of order
[2:34:13] about it
[2:34:15] and that so struck
[2:34:17] sister jada's heart that she said i got
[2:34:20] to get back down there tuesday night
[2:34:26] so here she comes in tuesday night
[2:34:28] surprises us all with the children
[2:34:30] behind her
[2:34:31] brother
[2:34:33] elias
[2:34:34] comes barging in my office
[2:34:38] he's almost all he's almost taken out by
[2:34:41] my security detail
[2:34:47] he comes
[2:34:48] barreling in there like a bull in a
[2:34:50] china closet
[2:34:51] he finally gets broke in there to me and
[2:34:53] he said god said whoever gets in that
[2:34:56] altar tonight is going to have their
[2:34:57] deliverance
[2:34:59] i said all right
[2:35:02] what else do you say
[2:35:05] well all right
[2:35:07] we had a good service that night we said
[2:35:09] let's come and see we had a good order
[2:35:12] service god met he ministered he blessed
[2:35:15] encouraged he helped delivered what i
[2:35:17] don't know what all god did
[2:35:19] but i know we're coming to a close
[2:35:22] so much so that the stream is turned off
[2:35:30] hallelujah
[2:35:32] and we're coming down to go out
[2:35:35] and we look over there and there set
[2:35:36] some of their children
[2:35:40] the spirit of god's moving on them
[2:35:45] and i said look at there
[2:35:47] look what god's doing for them let's see
[2:35:49] what this is about
[2:35:51] and the next thing you know god was
[2:35:52] pouring the holy ghost out
[2:35:55] hallelujah
[2:35:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hour
[2:35:59] and a half two hours later
[2:36:02] god's had his way why it all was the
[2:36:05] same it all goes right to this when god
[2:36:07] speaks to your heart
[2:36:10] you better do it then
[2:36:12] or the enemy will talk you out of it
[2:36:16] or your family will talk you out of it
[2:36:20] or your preacher might talk you out of
[2:36:22] it
[2:36:25] when you know god is speaking to your
[2:36:27] heart you better be ready
[2:36:30] to obey
[2:36:34] him when we started in closing musicians
[2:36:38] are coming
[2:36:40] when we started this service we started
[2:36:42] off talking about
[2:36:44] the weapons of our warfare
[2:36:52] this is the greatest portion of the
[2:36:54] warfare that we're engaged in right now
[2:36:57] the biggest portion of the warfare that
[2:37:00] we are engaged in right now is in this
[2:37:02] these verses of scripture let's look at
[2:37:04] the list
[2:37:06] number one
[2:37:08] it's a battle
[2:37:09] to pull down
[2:37:11] strongholds
[2:37:14] paradigms
[2:37:16] thought processes
[2:37:19] same old same old same jose mo samo
[2:37:22] am i am i telling you the truth
[2:37:24] let me have your attention
[2:37:27] same old same old same old same same
[2:37:29] rejections
[2:37:31] same hurt feelings
[2:37:33] same resentment
[2:37:35] same little little roots of bitterness
[2:37:38] unforgiveness
[2:37:56] if we don't deal with strongholds
[2:37:59] if we don't pull down paradigms
[2:38:02] that we have built in our life
[2:38:04] they become death structures
[2:38:09] they produce nothing but death
[2:38:12] nothing but heartache
[2:38:15] nothing but destruction
[2:38:17] you get under a spirit of rejection
[2:38:20] then you attract rejection
[2:38:24] the hardest person for me to fellowship
[2:38:26] with
[2:38:28] is someone who wears that cloak of
[2:38:31] rejection
[2:38:33] it makes me so nervous
[2:38:38] you're afraid you're going to say the
[2:38:39] wrong thing you're going to do the wrong
[2:38:41] thing you're going to act the wrong way
[2:38:45] you're not going to call the right name
[2:38:50] and so what what really happens to me
[2:38:54] is when i'm around someone who wears
[2:38:56] that you know it's almost like a sign
[2:38:58] around their neck
[2:38:59] i'm rejectable
[2:39:04] then i don't know how to respond to that
[2:39:06] sometime
[2:39:07] so the first thing you realize you do is
[2:39:09] you're pulling away
[2:39:11] only because you don't know how to
[2:39:13] fellowship that
[2:39:15] i know how to cast it out
[2:39:18] if you want it cast out but most of the
[2:39:20] time people don't want that cast out
[2:39:22] they want it petted
[2:39:28] it's become their identity
[2:39:30] you take away that spirit of rejection
[2:39:32] that they're under and they don't even
[2:39:34] know who they are
[2:39:36] so so you you not on purpose even
[2:39:39] sometimes you you just sort of pull away
[2:39:41] because you don't know how to respond
[2:39:43] guess what that does
[2:39:45] it just strengthens that rejection
[2:39:47] spirit that's on that person and now my
[2:39:49] pastor now my friend now you have
[2:39:52] rejected me too not realizing
[2:39:56] that a lot of times the banner you wear
[2:39:58] around your neck
[2:40:00] is what's pushing people away
[2:40:03] isn't that awful
[2:40:04] it's one of the worst paradigms i know
[2:40:06] of i can't think of a much worse
[2:40:08] paradigm than that rejected people
[2:40:10] attract rejection
[2:40:14] so at some point you've got to make up
[2:40:15] your mind i may be rejected by everybody
[2:40:18] on planet earth
[2:40:21] but somebody loves me
[2:40:25] somebody died for me
[2:40:29] somebody understands
[2:40:32] me somebody cares about me
[2:40:37] somebody's drawing me close while
[2:40:40] everybody else is pushing me away come
[2:40:42] on come on
[2:40:44] you say that just seems like that just
[2:40:46] makes it seem as it is not a big thing
[2:40:48] it is a big thing it's a legitimate
[2:40:51] problem that people have and it needs to
[2:40:53] be ministered to but somebody needs to
[2:40:56] tell them you have the responsibility to
[2:41:00] make up your mind
[2:41:02] i'm not going to live under that
[2:41:04] identity anymore i'm not going to wear
[2:41:07] that as my banner i'm rejectable
[2:41:11] i've been so rejected
[2:41:14] you just change your change your sign
[2:41:18] you know what they ought to say
[2:41:20] you don't have an arrow on him and say
[2:41:22] upon him and say i'm his favorite
[2:41:30] that'll mess with the religious
[2:41:36] the religious will see them that's our
[2:41:38] year is favored
[2:41:40] god doesn't play favorite heads
[2:41:44] but you'll know in your heart
[2:41:46] hallelujah you know what you ought to
[2:41:48] know it
[2:41:49] you ought to know it
[2:41:51] you ought to be so sure of his love for
[2:41:54] you that you feel like i'm his favorite
[2:41:57] [Music]
[2:42:00] he's got a room full of favorites
[2:42:02] are you all right with that
[2:42:05] not i'm i'm unlovable
[2:42:07] not i'm rejected
[2:42:10] not i'm defeated
[2:42:12] people just don't understand me
[2:42:15] i'm misunderstood
[2:42:17] i'll never be in the clique
[2:42:19] i'm preaching to you
[2:42:21] shall i call your name with it
[2:42:28] can we do initials
[2:42:33] this is a part of life
[2:42:35] yes sir
[2:42:37] i know
[2:42:38] rejection you know my story
[2:42:42] i know what rejection feels like
[2:42:44] but you've got to make up your mind i'm
[2:42:46] not here
[2:42:47] for somebody to accept me
[2:42:50] i'm here
[2:42:51] to be his accepted to be his beloved i'm
[2:42:55] here to minister i'm not here to
[2:42:56] minister to everybody that's the hardest
[2:42:58] lesson for every preacher to learn
[2:43:01] because you come into this thing
[2:43:03] believing you can preach to anybody and
[2:43:05] help everybody
[2:43:06] and then you quickly find out there are
[2:43:08] some people that can never receive from
[2:43:11] you but it doesn't make them evil or bad
[2:43:13] it just means there's somebody else they
[2:43:15] can receive from therefore they are not
[2:43:17] your responsibility
[2:43:21] so you can quit beating heads with
[2:43:22] somebody and realize i don't have to
[2:43:24] help him
[2:43:26] god's got somebody else who can help him
[2:43:29] what i have to do is help those that i
[2:43:31] can help be a light to those that i can
[2:43:34] be a light too but if i choose to live
[2:43:36] in rejection because one person rejects
[2:43:39] me
[2:43:41] you've got that stronghold over your

[2:43:46] be
[2:43:47] you know it'll become self-condemnation

[2:44:48] people sometime
[2:44:51] they they're so defeated
[2:44:55] they're so confused that they confuse
[2:44:57] everybody around them that doesn't have
[2:45:00] to be your identity
[2:45:02] you pull that stronghold down
[2:45:04] your pastor can't pull that down your
[2:45:06] mama can't pull that down for you your
[2:45:08] husband can't vote your wife can't pull
[2:45:10] that down for you you're the only one
[2:45:11] that can take authority in the name of
[2:45:13] jesus christ and pull down strongholds
[2:45:15] what else
[2:45:18] let's let's go to just the list
[2:45:21] number one to pull down strong holes
[2:45:22] number two to cast down imaginations
[2:45:28] you know me i've got to tell paul kane
[2:45:32] he said brother
[2:45:33] stephen i have such a complex
[2:45:35] that i can't go to the football game
[2:45:40] and he was not exaggerating
[2:45:44] i can print the emails
[2:45:47] and show you he was not exaggerating
[2:45:50] he was tormented
[2:45:52] by the spirit of rejection
[2:45:57] i was emailing him three times a day
[2:46:00] from ghana
[2:46:03] and we had a blackout
[2:46:06] and i couldn't send off that second and
[2:46:07] third email by the next morning
[2:46:10] he was just sure that i had rejected him
[2:46:12] that i had believed a report about him
[2:46:14] that i wasn't going to be his friend
[2:46:15] anymore i said no papa paul
[2:46:19] it's called the blackout
[2:46:21] not only was there no
[2:46:23] internet there was no power
[2:46:26] we're still tight
[2:46:28] we're still friends
[2:46:31] the same internet that didn't let me
[2:46:33] communicate with you didn't let nobody
[2:46:35] communicate with me
[2:46:37] so i haven't believed anything
[2:46:39] that i didn't believe yesterday
[2:46:42] he said i can't even go the football
[2:46:44] game because when i see them down there
[2:46:46] in a huddle
[2:46:47] i'm convinced they're talking about
[2:46:50] me he was that bound
[2:46:55] you are the only one
[2:46:56] that can cast down that kind of
[2:46:58] imagination how many of you know that's
[2:47:00] that's absolutely
[2:47:01] ludicrous it's it's more than
[2:47:04] ridiculous he was saying it jokingly
[2:47:09] but was so guilty
[2:47:11] it's not funny
[2:47:14] you can't even hardly laugh at it
[2:47:15] because you can only imagine the torment
[2:47:18] you alone can cast down imaginations
[2:47:22] what else
[2:47:24] to cast down every high thing
[2:47:27] that exalteth itself against the
[2:47:29] knowledge
[2:47:30] of christ
[2:47:33] is there another
[2:47:34] where's it for
[2:47:36] to bring every thought yeah the most
[2:47:38] important
[2:47:40] to bring every thought into captivity
[2:47:41] and forcing it to obey christ
[2:47:44] oh no no no no no no no no no no uh-uh
[2:47:47] you're going to obey the word
[2:47:52] my my head's not going to just think
[2:47:54] what it wants to think
[2:47:56] i'm going to control those thoughts
[2:47:58] i'm going to submit them and subject
[2:48:00] them and force them to obey the word of
[2:48:02] god
[2:48:04] i'm his favorite i'm his chosen i'm his
[2:48:06] elected he loves me
[2:48:09] if you can't love me like he loves me
[2:48:11] i'm sorry for you
[2:48:14] you need to catch some of that
[2:48:18] if somebody can't love you like jesus
[2:48:20] loves you they got the problem
[2:48:22] you don't have to live the rest of your
[2:48:24] life feeling unlovable
[2:48:26] because two or three people don't love
[2:48:28] you
[2:48:33] church don't want much to do with you
[2:48:35] that doesn't mean he doesn't
[2:48:38] come on
[2:48:40] all these things are legitimate
[2:48:42] but every one of them have to be
[2:48:43] defeated
[2:48:45] in the message three witnesses
[2:48:49] he said god wake us up from this
[2:48:50] sense-bound dream that we're in
[2:48:53] may we go beyond this sphere
[2:48:55] up into the place where all things are
[2:48:57] possible
[2:48:58] and there lay hold on eternal life and
[2:49:00] on divine healing and tonight walk out
[2:49:03] of here victorious in christ jesus for

[2:49:10] give away satan
[2:49:13] what's the matter soldiers
[2:49:15] don't you think we can conquer
[2:49:18] he's already conquered
[2:49:21] we are more than victors
[2:49:24] in christ jesus
[2:49:27] every devil cast out
[2:49:30] everything else

[3:17:39] novice
[3:17:41] at having babies
[3:17:44] but this is the first baby at home
[3:17:47] and for those of you who don't know it's
[3:17:50] an entirely different
[3:17:52] circumstance
[3:17:55] it's beautiful it's wonderful
[3:17:58] it works
[3:18:00] it's worked for thousands of years
[3:18:03] it works it's good it's going to be
[3:18:05] glorious
[3:18:07] because we're all believing god it's not
[3:18:09] not something to take lightly
[3:18:12] there's a lot of prayer that needs to go
[3:18:14] in and that's why we've been praying
[3:18:16] consistently
[3:18:19] and we're going to really pray that

[3:18:48] we're thankful for that because girls
[3:18:51] have to have husbands

[3:18:57] home and that room and those who are
