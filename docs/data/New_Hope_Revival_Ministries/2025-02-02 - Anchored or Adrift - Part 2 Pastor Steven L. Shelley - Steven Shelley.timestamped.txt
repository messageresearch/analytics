[1:05:17] anchor hes would you give God praise
[1:05:20] with me what a solid
[1:05:23] rock hallelujah
[1:05:27] praise the name of the
[1:05:31] Lord thank you so much we thank all of
[1:05:35] you who've given so much to help us in
[1:05:39] the the service last night in the
[1:05:41] service this morning we we don't take it
[1:05:44] for
[1:05:45] granted we know that some were here last
[1:05:49] night straight from work and yet they
[1:05:53] come and consider it a privilege to give
[1:05:56] their gifts to the Lord and we become
[1:05:58] the beneficiaries of it because it takes
[1:06:02] an
[1:06:03] atmosphere brother brandom talked about
[1:06:05] Papa Bosworth and the story that he
[1:06:08] always told and he said it didn't matter
[1:06:12] whether it was uh under a hound dog or
[1:06:15] under a mother hen or whatever it was it
[1:06:18] takes atmosphere to hatch the
[1:06:21] eggs he said do you put eggs under a
[1:06:24] hound dog and if if she would lay on
[1:06:25] them while they would hatch even though
[1:06:28] that hound dog is not the mother because
[1:06:31] it takes
[1:06:32] atmosphere and that's what worship
[1:06:35] creates your sincere praise and the
[1:06:39] anointing that breaks every yoke of
[1:06:42] bondage creates an atmosphere the Bible
[1:06:45] tells us that this morning in this
[1:06:47] atmosphere we are seated together amen I
[1:06:51] want you to help me say we are seated
[1:06:54] together in in Christ Jesus that's where
[1:06:57] we are right now we are living in dual
[1:07:03] dimensions a part of us is here on
[1:07:06] planet Earth and as we worship and the
[1:07:09] word begins to lift us then there's a
[1:07:12] part of our being that's represented
[1:07:14] Before the Throne of God Amen maybe
[1:07:17] that's too much for some of you but
[1:07:19] that's what his word has taught us amen
[1:07:21] and so we are bidimensional people given
[1:07:24] the grace of of God to have a physical
[1:07:27] existence on this Earth but the ability
[1:07:30] to be moved into Heavenly places as we
[1:07:34] focus on the name of Jesus he's here I
[1:07:38] want to tell you this morning he is here
[1:07:42] I brought him how many of you brought
[1:07:44] him he's here he's here and he will do
[1:07:49] whatever we let him do you say I don't
[1:07:52] know about that language it's right
[1:07:54] language because our faith
[1:07:57] determines how much of him is loosed in
[1:08:01] this service it's according to our faith
[1:08:04] according to your faith be it done unto
[1:08:06] you isn't that what he said so may God
[1:08:10] anoint our faith right now may we lift
[1:08:15] above the realm of Hope and come into a
[1:08:18] place of perfect Faith to believe that
[1:08:23] whatever God would desire we are with
[1:08:26] him and not in his way and whatever we
[1:08:29] have need of that our faith would touch
[1:08:32] him and he would activate that reality
[1:08:35] in all of us I I I feel it's not about
[1:08:40] feelings but I feel something in in the
[1:08:44] atmosphere that my I don't know whether
[1:08:47] to say this so many visitors here are
[1:08:49] not but every cell uh in my body is
[1:08:54] responding to something that God is
[1:08:57] doing in the atmosphere and I feel
[1:09:00] something moving from the inside and
[1:09:03] maybe you think that sounds just
[1:09:05] absolutely uh uh weird or strange but
[1:09:09] you were created by that God you you are
[1:09:13] his creation and every cell of your body
[1:09:17] responds to his voice you believe that
[1:09:21] and I feel him in this house and I'm
[1:09:24] going to pray him whether I feel like it
[1:09:26] or don't whether I feel him or not it's
[1:09:29] not whether we feel him or not but when
[1:09:31] we can we
[1:09:33] should and when we do we ought to be
[1:09:35] very grateful for it thank you for being
[1:09:38] here thank you for coming and supporting

[1:12:20] faithful
[1:12:22] streamer um I know they're oh there they
[1:12:26] are come in for just a minute uh brother
[1:12:30] come come in just a minute because I
[1:12:32] wanted to make an announcement two
[1:12:35] announcements that I didn't make
[1:12:37] yesterday uh last Sunday well I didn't
[1:12:39] know about one of them but we are so
[1:12:42] very delighted to tell you that Brother
[1:12:45] David Yantis and sister Ashley TBO
[1:12:49] Yantis are going to have another baby a
[1:12:53] gift of God to their life and family so
[1:12:56] let's congratulate
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:01] them is okay and I got a text yesterday
[1:13:06] I had to make sure that I got that one
[1:13:08] in first because that was supposed to be
[1:13:10] mentioned last Sunday but now we get
[1:13:14] this exciting out of the blue surprise
[1:13:17] news that brother Austin and sister
[1:13:20] Hannah Hollowell are are expecting
[1:13:22] another baby so we want to congratul
[1:13:25] ulate them praise
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:30] God this is what we call Church
[1:13:35] growth we're thankful amen Hebrews
[1:13:39] chapter
[1:13:40] 2 I want to again respect and give honor
[1:13:44] to all of you who have sacrificed to be
[1:13:47] here and I realize that you're all on a
[1:13:52] journey and the journey gets hot and it
[1:13:55] gets hard but the answer is keeping your
[1:13:58] anchor on the solid rock he never
[1:14:01] disappoints can you say amen amen I'm a
[1:14:04] little bit needy when I preach I I Need
[1:14:09] a Little Noise I need an amen from you I
[1:14:13] need you to at least wiggle your
[1:14:16] finger or your toe in your shoe to show
[1:14:20] me just a little bit of pull because uh
[1:14:23] my old granny used to say that when you
[1:14:25] say Amen to a Holiness preacher it's
[1:14:28] like saying sick them to a
[1:14:31] dog well I must be a dog because
[1:14:35] every now and again I need an amen let
[1:14:37] it be one from the heart but don't just
[1:14:41] absorb because every time you say Amen
[1:14:44] you are claiming a promise amen so be it
[1:14:48] that's what amen means so be it and
[1:14:51] you're not just saying so be it for the
[1:14:53] body you're saying so be it that's right
[1:14:55] for me therefore we ought to
[1:14:59] give the more Earnest heed to the things
[1:15:04] which we have heard lest at any time we
[1:15:10] should let them slip for if the word
[1:15:15] spoken by Angels was steadfast and every
[1:15:19] transgression and
[1:15:21] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:15:25] of reward how shall we
[1:15:31] escape if we neglect so great
[1:15:37] salvation which at the first began to be
[1:15:41] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:15:45] unto us by them that heard him father we
[1:15:52] approach your life giving
[1:15:56] word it changes
[1:15:59] us the revelation of your love as
[1:16:03] brother Hawk was
[1:16:04] praying when your love becomes a
[1:16:07] revelation to us it changes our
[1:16:12] perspective so today we are here for a a
[1:16:16] shift in our
[1:16:18] perspective we have seen the the
[1:16:22] darkness getting closer to to us in this
[1:16:26] hour and we desire not to be overwhelmed
[1:16:30] or overcome by that Darkness we desire
[1:16:34] to scatter it by being filled with your
[1:16:38] light when you walk in a room Darkness
[1:16:42] has to flee when you walk in a room
[1:16:45] doubt has to go and anxiety and
[1:16:49] depression has to go a disease has to go
[1:16:53] and heaviness has to go
[1:16:55] so Lord we invite you to come and unveil
[1:16:59] yourself to us through your word and may
[1:17:02] we leave here with a a deeper
[1:17:06] determination to hold on to your word in
[1:17:10] this unsettling hour while there are
[1:17:13] many voices that are speaking Desiring
[1:17:16] to have our attention Lord may we keep
[1:17:20] our he our
[1:17:22] frequency Our receiver tuned to your
[1:17:26] voice may we hear it clearer and louder
[1:17:29] than any other voice may it be so uh uh
[1:17:33] profound in our spirit that that all
[1:17:37] other voices are drowned out and and we
[1:17:40] have courage to walk by the leadership
[1:17:43] of the Holy Spirit Break Every yoke
[1:17:46] right now in the name of
[1:17:49] Jesus we thank you for bringing all
[1:17:53] Spirits under your author Authority that
[1:17:56] your word might cut the atmosphere and
[1:17:59] accomplish all that you've sent it forth
[1:18:01] to do we ask this thing in the mighty
[1:18:03] name in The Only Name under heaven where
[1:18:07] B men may be saved the name of the Lord
[1:18:10] Jesus Christ bashim Adonai Yeshua
[1:18:13] hamashiach and the Saints
[1:18:15] said you may be seated stay tuned in if
[1:18:19] you possibly can last night we discussed
[1:18:23] what it means to let these things that
[1:18:28] we have heard slip
[1:18:31] away it's not as though we have found
[1:18:34] ourselves on a slippery slope we are
[1:18:38] standing on a solid foundation the
[1:18:41] Church of Jesus Christ is built on the
[1:18:44] foundation of the Holy Apostles and
[1:18:47] Prophets we are told in the New
[1:18:50] Testament that Foundation is not
[1:18:53] prophetic or Apostolic that Foundation
[1:18:57] is the Lord Jesus Christ the apostles
[1:19:00] and Prophets of the scripture are built
[1:19:03] on the foundation of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ and on top of their leadership
[1:19:09] the church is established Jesus said to
[1:19:12] to Simon blessed art thou Simon son of
[1:19:17] Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:19:20] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:19:23] which is in heaven and thou art Peter
[1:19:27] Petros it means a rock but it means a
[1:19:31] chip off the bigger Rock it's it means a
[1:19:35] smaller Stone it's more like a piece of
[1:19:40] gravel it testifies not only of of its
[1:19:45] size the word in in Greek but it also
[1:19:49] testifies to us that this particular
[1:19:52] Rock has come from a larger
[1:19:56] rock Rock of Ages cleft for me so Peter
[1:20:02] in the mind of God was a little stone
[1:20:05] that had been chiseled off a bigger
[1:20:07] Stone that's what you and I are amen we
[1:20:10] are Lively Stones the scripture said we
[1:20:13] are living stones because we have come
[1:20:16] from the original Stone as brother
[1:20:20] Brandon would say not the Rock of
[1:20:22] Gibralter but the rock of aen
[1:20:25] how many of you are glad that you're
[1:20:27] standing
[1:20:29] surefooted on the rock that will never
[1:20:34] roll
[1:20:36] Hallelujah well prophetically he did
[1:20:40] roll because Daniel said I saw a
[1:20:46] stone HED out of the mountain side and
[1:20:50] it came rolling down through Babylon on
[1:20:56] striking that old uh
[1:21:00] giant the image that Daniel saw striking
[1:21:04] that image on on the on the feet and and
[1:21:09] shattering that Kingdom that desired to
[1:21:13] rise up and exalt itself against the
[1:21:16] name and knowledge of Jesus Christ in
[1:21:18] the end time a false religion that mixes
[1:21:22] with it its Palo Rome coming together
[1:21:27] with a a political system and my we're
[1:21:31] not waiting on that to come it's
[1:21:34] here the Nations have made their
[1:21:37] Federation and the world is is growing
[1:21:41] darker but the light of God in his bride
[1:21:45] it's not
[1:21:47] dimming oh I'm going somewhere if you'll
[1:21:50] go with me it's not dimming his light is
[1:21:53] getting bright
[1:21:55] as you and I let it shine through US
[1:21:57] amen nothing can stand before a people
[1:22:01] who are surefooted on the Rock of Ages
[1:22:05] so it's not a slippery sto slope that
[1:22:07] we're standing on we're standing on a
[1:22:09] solid rock but sometimes because we
[1:22:12] think we have learned it all or we have
[1:22:15] come to know it all we let precious
[1:22:18] truth come Drifting by us and we miss it
[1:22:24] when brother brandham had the vision of
[1:22:26] the bear H this silver tipped Grizzly I
[1:22:32] don't think that bear ever knew that he
[1:22:35] was going to cause so much
[1:22:37] controversy uh as as that bear has
[1:22:40] caused because so many people have said
[1:22:43] aha there is a vision that didn't come
[1:22:47] to pass but they missed something in the
[1:22:50] telling of that of that event that you
[1:22:53] and I need need to understand the
[1:22:56] weather was different that morning than
[1:22:59] it had been and folks were out of
[1:23:03] sorts and those who were there give this
[1:23:06] testimony that I I firmly believe has
[1:23:10] some great value and weight and Merit
[1:23:13] Among Us brother brandom understood that
[1:23:17] there is a possibility that we miss what
[1:23:21] God desires to do in the timing that he
[1:23:26] desires to do it that doesn't mean he's
[1:23:28] not
[1:23:29] God he's God's Sovereign and God supreme
[1:23:34] but there are certain Visions there are
[1:23:37] certain things that that he would like
[1:23:39] to do and desires to do in us and and we
[1:23:42] must cooperate we must participate in
[1:23:46] the plan you understand we've got to be
[1:23:49] in the right place at the right time in
[1:23:52] the early days of brother ROM's Ministry
[1:23:55] he he would find himself uh Envision
[1:24:00] concerning uh uh some prayer needs that
[1:24:03] somebody would come with and they would
[1:24:06] come the next day and he would notice
[1:24:11] that something was not quite right and
[1:24:14] he would say no no no wait a minute you
[1:24:16] sit
[1:24:18] here are you listening you sit here and
[1:24:21] then you take that chair he was bringing
[1:24:25] people into
[1:24:27] alignment with what he saw because he
[1:24:30] saw God was going to bring the healing
[1:24:33] that was needed but but in order for the
[1:24:36] vision to be fulfilled everybody had to
[1:24:38] be in the right position somebody said I
[1:24:40] don't know if I believe that or not
[1:24:41] better check the book because the book
[1:24:44] teaches that principle you've got to be
[1:24:47] lined up it's not enough just to believe
[1:24:50] the truth it's not enough just to say I
[1:24:52] believe the word we've got to know what
[1:24:54] God is doing right now I love what God
[1:24:58] did in the 50s and 60s but I missed
[1:25:02] it I didn't show up till
[1:25:05] 1968 the prophet is gone the healing
[1:25:09] Revival has
[1:25:10] finished and so I can't just live my
[1:25:14] life in in in the 50s and
[1:25:18] 60s I have to believe that the god of
[1:25:21] the
[1:25:22] 50s and the god of the the 60s is still
[1:25:25] Jehovah
[1:25:26] Rafa he's still God Sovereign and
[1:25:29] supreme in 2025 how about the Saints
[1:25:33] giving a little
[1:25:34] amen and so it's it's also important to
[1:25:39] understand the seasons and the cycles of
[1:25:43] what God is doing in his people and
[1:25:45] there is a season going on right now
[1:25:48] where we are examining our hearts
[1:25:52] because we know that our hearts our
[1:25:54] blood pump but the Lev in Hebrew the
[1:25:58] heart is the seat of the emotions and
[1:26:01] most of us struggle in the area of
[1:26:06] mind
[1:26:09] will and
[1:26:11] emotions and and so that greatest battle
[1:26:14] that's ever fought is being it's being
[1:26:17] waged right now in this little bride and
[1:26:22] that's the season now where God is is
[1:26:24] putting his finger on things that we
[1:26:27] have allowed to to uh
[1:26:30] sprout in us a little
[1:26:33] resentments little
[1:26:35] prejudices sir little judgments and he's
[1:26:38] saying I can't have a people uh fully
[1:26:41] surrendered until they will dig in their
[1:26:45] garden and allow me by the Holy Spirit
[1:26:47] to help them I want you to know it's
[1:26:50] painful
[1:26:52] brother have you ever had a tooth pulled
[1:26:54] without
[1:26:55] novacaine it's painful would anybody
[1:26:59] want to have their appendix took out
[1:27:01] without medication without
[1:27:03] some you and I want to be Cowboys
[1:27:06] sometime but we couldn't have lived in
[1:27:08] the in the old
[1:27:09] west where they just poured a little
[1:27:12] Whiskey on them and cut them open we
[1:27:14] want to we don't even want to see the
[1:27:18] doctor knock me out before I get in
[1:27:21] there I don't want to know anything
[1:27:23] until it's all over and everything's put
[1:27:25] back into place you understand but
[1:27:28] sometimes God reaches in us oh yes and
[1:27:31] he starts extracting things from us that
[1:27:34] we thought we wanted to get rid
[1:27:36] of until they're
[1:27:38] gone on and we have come become so used
[1:27:43] to what we've carried that when it's
[1:27:46] taken from us it hurts still the hurt
[1:27:49] remains and God wants to heal every
[1:27:52] Wounded Heart in this house house he
[1:27:55] wants to heal every Wounded Heart in his
[1:27:58] little bride around the world we're not
[1:28:00] going to be a basket case at Rapture
[1:28:05] time we're not going to be addicted to
[1:28:08] nerve pills and anxiety pills at Rapture
[1:28:12] time he's going to have a people strong
[1:28:15] and mighty because they have been molded
[1:28:19] in the stature of the perfect
[1:28:22] man fully ad opted so that their name on
[1:28:26] the check their identity is no longer as
[1:28:30] I said last night former Amish or or the
[1:28:34] Pentecostal side of the message or or
[1:28:37] the dry side of the message or the
[1:28:40] Thunder side or the two Soul side or the
[1:28:44] come on he's going to have a people that
[1:28:47] their identity is not with who they
[1:28:49] fellowship with their identity is going
[1:28:52] to be mising is Jesus
[1:28:56] Christ Hallelujah and it won't matter in
[1:29:00] that moment who your pastor is or what
[1:29:03] your flavor is or your particular slant
[1:29:07] in the message is what's going to matter
[1:29:10] is that you are fully adopted and your
[1:29:12] name is the same as his name and in that
[1:29:16] moment of quick short work it's it's
[1:29:20] anastasis it is a reproducible resur
[1:29:24] ction right here on the earth it will
[1:29:27] bring eventually after God begins to
[1:29:31] stir in that he our loved ones will
[1:29:35] begin appearing to
[1:29:39] us and so if the old church hasn't
[1:29:41] kicked you out
[1:29:44] yet when you start letting it be known I
[1:29:48] caught a glimpse of my of my old sainted
[1:29:51] mother or I come on
[1:29:54] they're going to think you have surely
[1:29:56] lost it somebody said I have to see that
[1:29:58] in the word oh yes I'm glad you
[1:30:00] mentioned that because the Bible tells
[1:30:03] us that in the first resurrection that's
[1:30:05] how it
[1:30:06] was why shouldn't it be that way in the
[1:30:09] last Resurrection the Bible said the
[1:30:11] veil of the temple was torn in Twain the
[1:30:14] Earth Shook and darkness covered the
[1:30:17] face of the deep the Bible said and many
[1:30:20] of the Saints which slept
[1:30:24] you don't think they were taking a nap
[1:30:26] do you they were graveyard dead many of
[1:30:30] the Saints which slept
[1:30:34] arose and walked again the streets of
[1:30:38] Jerusalem and appeared to many
[1:30:42] amen hallelujah yes that's exactly right
[1:30:48] Hallelujah because we've got some over
[1:30:52] there and when we see that we'll know
[1:30:56] that this is Rapture
[1:30:57] time we're in that last season and cycle
[1:31:01] and brother I want you to know there
[1:31:03] will not have to be a sick one Among
[1:31:07] Us I don't believe that he's taking a
[1:31:10] bride out of here that is sick and
[1:31:12] defeated and broken and maimed and Halt
[1:31:16] and
[1:31:17] blind I believe that Resurrection cycle
[1:31:20] when it unfolds we're in the process of
[1:31:23] rapture now but when that final part
[1:31:26] begins to unfold every sickness every
[1:31:30] infirmity will begin to drop off of
[1:31:34] us those who are alive and remain will
[1:31:37] begin to feel the renewing of the
[1:31:42] spring it's coming folks it's closer
[1:31:45] than it's ever been we must not let
[1:31:48] these truths slip by us like icebergs
[1:31:54] we must grab a hold of them ground them
[1:31:57] in the word if you hear brother brandom
[1:32:00] say something you take that right back
[1:32:02] and find how to place that in the word
[1:32:07] and if you can't do that don't you make
[1:32:09] a doctrine of
[1:32:11] it
[1:32:15] on don't you make a doctrine of it if
[1:32:18] it's going to be a Doctrine it's got to
[1:32:20] find its place properly posed
[1:32:24] positioned in the word does anybody
[1:32:27] believe
[1:32:29] that so we are living in an hour there
[1:32:32] there's only one way it seems that we
[1:32:36] can make sure that our heart stays pure
[1:32:39] and our hands stay clean so that we have
[1:32:42] no hindrance ascending the hill of the
[1:32:47] Lord I I I don't want to wait till
[1:32:49] eternity to ascend the hill of the Lord
[1:32:52] every day I want to make my way up to
[1:32:54] Zion spiritually and and who can go
[1:32:57] there except he that hath Clean
[1:33:01] Hands no blood come on no blood that's
[1:33:06] right you're not guilty of murder
[1:33:09] right you've laid that aside remember
[1:33:12] what he said you don't have to take a
[1:33:16] gun to be guilty of
[1:33:18] murder he said you you tear somebody's
[1:33:21] influence down
[1:33:25] you've assassinated their
[1:33:27] character you're
[1:33:29] guilty you you you'll never go up
[1:33:32] properly and daily to the hill of the
[1:33:35] Lord with Innocent blood on your hands
[1:33:38] repent make it right if you have told
[1:33:41] things that have caused people to lose
[1:33:44] confidence in those that God might have
[1:33:47] even chosen to use for them or for their
[1:33:50] loved ones now is the time to
[1:33:56] repent make it right so that you can go
[1:34:00] up to the hill of the Lord with Clean
[1:34:02] Hands a pure heart one of the ways to
[1:34:04] make sure that that is true is to do
[1:34:07] what the scripture said Psalm 51 the
[1:34:10] repentance prayer of the psalmist for
[1:34:13] thou desirest not
[1:34:16] sacrifice
[1:34:18] 51:16 else would I give it thou Delight
[1:34:23] us not in burnt offering the
[1:34:27] sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:34:35] Spirit one that is not
[1:34:38] hoty one that has been dashed against
[1:34:42] The Rock and has been broken not by the
[1:34:45] world not by Family you've been broken
[1:34:49] by the Rock of Ages let me tell you
[1:34:52] something that is what we're missing
[1:34:55] sometimes is throwing ourselves on The
[1:34:59] Rock when we do it's going to break us
[1:35:03] but it's going to break the part of us
[1:35:06] that needs to be
[1:35:08] broken have you ever said Lord I throw
[1:35:11] myself on your mercy I have Lord I throw
[1:35:14] myself on your mercy I throw myself on
[1:35:18] you I want you to break me so that you
[1:35:22] can easier extract from me what what I
[1:35:26] have picked up from my
[1:35:30] life Mama issues and daddy issues and
[1:35:34] family troubles and church hurts
[1:35:37] and but who the man or the woman I hope
[1:35:41] you're hearing me the man or the woman
[1:35:43] who refuses to to be
[1:35:46] broken the one who refuses to throw
[1:35:49] himself or throw herself not only once
[1:35:52] and for all but quite consistently we
[1:35:55] need to be dashed against The Rock
[1:35:58] because God said I'm not looking for
[1:36:00] sacrifices of of burnt offerings and
[1:36:02] lambs and and sheep and this such
[1:36:06] anymore but but I am looking for a
[1:36:08] broken and a
[1:36:12] contrite
[1:36:14] humble heart oh God if I come with a
[1:36:18] broken and a contrite heart you will not
[1:36:22] despise you will not reject this is also
[1:36:25] for the believer brother brandom said in
[1:36:27] the message he calleth for you let's be
[1:36:29] a real
[1:36:30] Christian let this fire let this church
[1:36:35] be on
[1:36:37] fire prayer meetings going all the time
[1:36:42] it doesn't have to be organized it
[1:36:45] doesn't have to be we'll meet every
[1:36:46] Wednesday at 12 but it has to be that we
[1:36:50] find ourselves in a spirit of Prayer
[1:36:54] not a spirit of
[1:36:57] Gossip oh I need some preaching
[1:37:00] help I thought I was in the right place
[1:37:02] this morning for some amen help oh we've
[1:37:07] got to have a a spirit of prayer brother
[1:37:09] R said you can do a lot of things too
[1:37:12] much but there's one thing you'll never
[1:37:14] do too much and that's
[1:37:15] pray oh my and your prayer is not a
[1:37:19] Santa Claus list your prayer is oh God
[1:37:23] give me what I
[1:37:25] need what you desire I want to be
[1:37:28] positioned to receive and when we don't
[1:37:31] know how to pray he the
[1:37:35] spirit you get in your prayer closet
[1:37:38] there is no church order that's right
[1:37:41] hello that's right you get in your
[1:37:43] prayer closet and you let the spirit of
[1:37:46] God lead you and direct you in prayer
[1:37:49] and if you feel a groan coming up from
[1:37:52] your inner man groan
[1:37:55] own if you feel travail just
[1:38:01] travail if you feel God giving you uh
[1:38:04] somehow letting you capture a Heavenly
[1:38:07] language when you pray pray in that
[1:38:15] language speaking in tongues is not the
[1:38:18] initial
[1:38:19] evidence of the Holy
[1:38:22] Ghost that is a life that is surrendered
[1:38:26] to every word of God so you can talk in
[1:38:29] tongues and not have the real Holy
[1:38:32] Ghost but because that is a revealed
[1:38:35] truth doesn't mean that that you don't
[1:38:38] have the same blessing that God gave the
[1:38:40] early church and he said when you don't
[1:38:42] know how to pray as you should the
[1:38:44] spirit of God will will make
[1:38:47] intercession for you through you with
[1:38:50] groanings that cannot be and that word
[1:38:53] uttered is a word that actually means
[1:38:56] understood when we get to praying
[1:38:58] sometime and something begins to
[1:39:02] oh
[1:39:04] God oh
[1:39:07] God especially those of us who are not
[1:39:10] prone to emotion now I'm prone to
[1:39:12] emotion I I I I I just thought I should
[1:39:15] tell you that about myself I go all in I
[1:39:20] just go all in but but even you that are
[1:39:22] not prone to emotion if the spirit of
[1:39:25] God should move on you that way in your
[1:39:27] prayer time let him have his way and
[1:39:32] I'll never tell on
[1:39:34] you it's it's the bride's special power
[1:39:37] it's her special gift to be able to let
[1:39:40] the holy spirit of God if it's a groan
[1:39:42] let it be a groan if it's a sound that
[1:39:45] you don't understand let it be a sound
[1:39:47] you don't understand but you are uh
[1:39:50] living below your privileges if you you
[1:39:53] don't find that channel of prayer it's
[1:39:57] for you somebody said that's just for a
[1:39:58] few certain people let me tell you
[1:40:00] something that's not what the scripture
[1:40:02] says we want to stay in the scripture
[1:40:04] don't we so I I want to move on we need
[1:40:07] a church on fire we need a church on

[1:40:34] God's doing amazing things and the old
[1:40:36] miners are getting saved and they're
[1:40:39] having to retrain the mules that go into
[1:40:43] the mines because they trained them with
[1:40:46] curse
[1:40:48] words and the old miners have been going
[1:40:50] to the Welch Revival getting born again
[1:40:53] yeah how many of you know when you get

[1:40:57] again and and so their language got born
[1:41:00] again and and they but before that they
[1:41:03] would use curse words to tell the mule
[1:41:05] which way to
[1:41:08] go when they got saved they couldn't say
[1:41:11] those words anymore so the mule didn't
[1:41:14] know what to
[1:41:15] do that's
[1:41:17] Revival somebody say that's
[1:41:20] Revival oh may God give such a Revival

[1:41:30] national Revival I'm talking about a
[1:41:34] personal
[1:41:35] Revival may God do that so that we have
[1:41:38] to learn a new
[1:41:39] vocabulary maybe we have to take up new
[1:41:42] habits Lord may we have to change our
[1:41:45] pastimes because we get so passionately

[1:42:08] wanted to make their way down to Wales
[1:42:10] to see where the Revival was but they

[1:42:43] in my travels to England preaching they
[1:42:45] had these little round concrete
[1:42:49] stands out in the middle of the
[1:42:51] intersection and the there's a police
[1:42:53] officer standing there a Bobby with a

[1:43:18] their folks over in England either cuz
[1:43:20] they put a Bobby out there in the middle

[1:44:28] that brings the evidence of that
[1:44:31] stirring so deep within the fibers
[1:44:35] oh oh yes the fibers of their being that

[1:44:46] promise he spoke to the
[1:44:50] storm I have some storms
[1:44:53] you ever fa any
[1:44:55] storms there's word in your mouth
[1:44:57] there's Authority in your mouth to do
[1:45:00] something about it sister mey with a
[1:45:04] tumor in her body before the doctor's
[1:45:07] hand would touch you let that tumor be
[1:45:10] gone in the name of Jesus Christ by
[1:45:13] Spoken Word Authority brother brandom in
[1:45:15] shreport Sister MAA back home in
[1:45:18] Jeffersonville he had that unction he
[1:45:20] wanted to be there couldn't get there in
[1:45:22] time time from where he was down at Jack
[1:45:25] Moore's inport but the word of the Lord
[1:45:28] inspiration came somebody said that's
[1:45:30] because he was a prophet that's because
[1:45:32] he was a church age messenger that's
[1:45:34] because he was a spokesman for the
[1:45:35] seventh angel that's because he was
[1:45:37] Malachi 4 that's no no no it's because
[1:45:40] he was a Son of
[1:45:45] God it's because he was a Son of God who
[1:45:48] had come into that
[1:45:50] adoption the one that Jesus found on the
[1:45:52] Mount of Transfiguration when the voice
[1:45:54] didn't just say I'm pleased to dwell in
[1:45:56] you but he said I'm pleas hear
[1:46:00] him you see brother brandom had to come
[1:46:02] to that place like a wave sheath
[1:46:04] offering he had to come to that place of
[1:46:06] spiritual maturity that God could say
[1:46:09] over his life hear
[1:46:11] him he's talking for me now if you think
[1:46:14] that that's one to a generation You'
[1:46:16] misunderstood that's a messenger one to
[1:46:18] a generation but Jesus was the first
[1:46:21] seed he he was the first fruits of the
[1:46:24] Resurrection he was the first son to
[1:46:26] come to
[1:46:29] maturity he was the first fruits of
[1:46:31] Resurrection meaning that if he came to
[1:46:33] maturity they're going to have to be
[1:46:35] some more
[1:46:39] seed that come to
[1:46:41] maturity and speak to their
[1:46:44] tumors brother and sister hadie writes
[1:46:47] two sons bunch of snicker doodles or

[1:46:57] how to put the fritzes and the itses and
[1:46:58] all that together you know but their
[1:47:01] Rebellion their Rebellion they're

[1:47:15] or they were mocking and laughing and
[1:47:18] having a big time at the at the speaking
[1:47:20] of this creation of of squirrels by the
[1:47:23] spoken word of God somebody said that's
[1:47:26] such an amazing thing well listen God
[1:47:28] can do that he does it every day in the
[1:47:31] ocean he has that little starfish a
[1:47:33] certain kind of that starfish loses an
[1:47:35] arm or a leg or whatever starfish have
[1:47:38] and it
[1:47:39] regenerates that's something God knows
[1:47:42] exactly how to do he placed it within
[1:47:44] them to be able to do it don't you know
[1:47:46] he can do that
[1:47:48] today and and he can create and restore
[1:47:52] even missing
[1:47:54] limbs he's the greatest transplant
[1:47:58] surgeon he can give somebody a new heart
[1:48:01] a new
[1:48:03] kidney a new
[1:48:05] liver somebody said I've never seen or
[1:48:07] heard anything like that well let me
[1:48:09] tell you something God's just waiting on
[1:48:10] a people that will take him at his
[1:48:13] word oh my my just a minute I don't have
[1:48:16] any windshield
[1:48:19] Whoppers so I have to take time to be my
[1:48:21] own windshield whoer here I want to be
[1:48:24] one of those that Cleaves that clings so
[1:48:28] close to
[1:48:30] him I I uh I I wanted to go back over
[1:48:35] some of the things but I I won't take
[1:48:37] the time to do that but I want to just
[1:48:39] pick one thing out of of where we were
[1:48:41] last night and and and say that the
[1:48:44] lesson that was to be learned from bael
[1:48:48] peor was that there is always
[1:48:53] the temptation to
[1:48:57] compromise I I failed to mention last
[1:49:00] night that just before the plague struck
[1:49:04] and the plague came because the children
[1:49:07] of Israel were lusting after the women
[1:49:11] of Midian and Moab and they began to lay
[1:49:14] with those women those foreign women
[1:49:16] that God had told his people not to be
[1:49:19] mixed with and when they began to do
[1:49:22] that they begin to lose the favor of God
[1:49:25] over the nation and it began to manifest
[1:49:28] in various forms of
[1:49:31] division stay with me just a moment
[1:49:35] compromise will
[1:49:38] divide that's right when when you start
[1:49:42] going out pitching your
[1:49:44] tent towards
[1:49:46] Sodom laying your head in Delilah's lap
[1:49:51] it divides the
[1:49:54] body and people start getting their eyes
[1:49:57] on one another and they start patterning
[1:50:00] after one another and they'll say well
[1:50:03] she does
[1:50:06] it he does it that family can and the
[1:50:11] next thing you know they'll be
[1:50:12] patterning after one another how many of
[1:50:15] you know that was never God's intention
[1:50:17] it was his his intention for us to
[1:50:19] pattern our life and our lifestyle after
[1:50:22] the word oh God make us word
[1:50:25] people make us strong in our stand and
[1:50:28] strong in our convictions that if
[1:50:31] everybody in the message has a Christmas
[1:50:37] tree that will stand against
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:43] paganism oh just a
[1:50:45] minute Amen brother I'll just help
[1:50:49] myself may God give us such conviction
[1:50:53] that we're not looking to see what other
[1:50:55] churches are doing but we're going to
[1:50:58] stay on the word and we're going to flee
[1:51:01] Babylon and we're going to flee Pagan
[1:51:04] Rome we don't want anything to do with
[1:51:06] the gods of of the Heathen but here were
[1:51:10] the Israelis the Israelites the Hebrew
[1:51:12] people lusting and not only that they
[1:51:16] begin to worship the god of the Heathen
[1:51:18] Nations
[1:51:19] bpor and this was a filthy God this was
[1:51:23] a fertility God it was a God that was
[1:51:26] worshiped with all kinds
[1:51:29] of terrible practices of of of orgies
[1:51:33] and
[1:51:34] and I I don't know brother brandom
[1:51:38] called it free love but it's way more
[1:51:40] than than that it it it was filthy
[1:51:43] ungodly
[1:51:45] hideous forms of worship and this was
[1:51:48] God's people and the favor of the Lord
[1:51:51] and just before the plague came did you
[1:51:53] understand that God said kill
[1:51:58] them God said destroy
[1:52:02] them the only way to get out from under
[1:52:05] that
[1:52:06] influence is to take them
[1:52:08] out now we know we're not living under
[1:52:11] that Covenant of the
[1:52:14] javelin we're not in that dispensation
[1:52:16] where we take the Vengeance of God into
[1:52:18] our own hands but in that day you see
[1:52:22] the T Commandments doesn't say in Hebrew
[1:52:24] it doesn't say thou shall not kill
[1:52:27] English it says thou shall not kill in
[1:52:29] Hebrew it says thou shall not
[1:52:32] murder and murder was to take somebody's
[1:52:35] life out of anger out of jealousy out of
[1:52:39] Envy out of a a case of adultery and you
[1:52:42] wanted to remove the partner selfish
[1:52:44] reasons but there were times under that
[1:52:47] old Covenant that God said kill every
[1:52:49] one of them men women and children right
[1:52:52] you may think that was extreme and I
[1:52:54] would have to agree with you just
[1:52:55] slightly except that from where God was
[1:52:58] sitting his perspective was if we let
[1:53:04] one if we let one little no harm sin go
[1:53:09] on without standing against it in our
[1:53:12] own
[1:53:14] lives you have no Authority in somebody
[1:53:16] else's
[1:53:19] family neither do you have any respons
[1:53:22] responsibility right of what goes on in
[1:53:24] someone else's family but you're the
[1:53:27] priest of your home Brother come on and
[1:53:31] if you set your children down in front
[1:53:33] of the idiot box and feed them the filth
[1:53:36] of Babylon and the filth of the
[1:53:38] world that generation that you're
[1:53:41] raising will be farther away from
[1:53:43] Biblical truth than your generation and
[1:53:46] if Jesus carries their
[1:53:51] children where will they
[1:53:54] be the Pentecostal Church compromised
[1:53:57] when the old preachers preach it's
[1:53:59] better not to have a television get that
[1:54:00] thing out of your home the the Next
[1:54:02] Generation said we think we can control
[1:54:05] it and uh so maybe we will we'll just
[1:54:08] keep it and be careful with it and now
[1:54:10] this generation carries it in their
[1:54:15] hand carries it in their
[1:54:18] hand the enemy has more access to our
[1:54:23] lives in this generation than he ever
[1:54:25] has before and that means we're going to
[1:54:27] have to be on guard like we've never
[1:54:29] been before and a man that's not filled
[1:54:32] with the Holy Ghost doesn't have a
[1:54:34] filter he doesn't have a filter to know
[1:54:37] when it's affecting his Spirit
[1:54:39] everything that comes in your eye gate
[1:54:41] will have an effect on you everything
[1:54:43] that comes in your ear gate will have an
[1:54:45] effect on
[1:54:47] you everything that you smell on has an
[1:54:51] effect on your brain
[1:54:53] that's why we can walk into a kitchen
[1:54:55] and be carried back to our
[1:54:58] childhood because of a certain smell
[1:55:01] that smell itself is registered in a
[1:55:04] library in our brain amen so everything
[1:55:08] that we let in has an effect it finds
[1:55:11] real estate in our lives and if we're
[1:55:14] not careful it'll be enough am I going
[1:55:17] too far it'll be
[1:55:19] enough to make a creeper out of us
[1:55:23] us something that tightens us and bends
[1:55:26] us and molds us God help us there's got
[1:55:28] to be a way back to Holiness there's got
[1:55:30] to be a way back to Sanctified living
[1:55:33] there's got to be a way back amen yes
[1:55:37] sir the worst thing that somebody could
[1:55:40] do who has been delivered out of a
[1:55:44] system uh uh whether it's omish or
[1:55:46] minite or or Pentecostal or denomination
[1:55:49] this or that or whatever doesn't matter
[1:55:51] but the worst thing that somebody can do
[1:55:53] when they're pulled out into something
[1:55:55] higher is to is to feel like we're free
[1:55:58] now to do whatever the world
[1:56:02] does it breaks my heart when I see men
[1:56:05] and women called out of of one system
[1:56:08] into another because God wants to help
[1:56:10] them and the next thing you
[1:56:13] know they're looking
[1:56:16] exactly like the
[1:56:18] world that's not the kind of Exodus that
[1:56:20] God's involved in if God's pulling you
[1:56:23] out of one thing he's taking you higher
[1:56:25] come on now and you may be free to drive
[1:56:28] an automobile and you may be free to
[1:56:31] choose the color of curtains that you
[1:56:32] wear and you may be free to put a button
[1:56:34] where a button should be but that
[1:56:37] doesn't give anybody the right to go out

[1:57:30] something in us to wake us up if we
[1:57:33] listen in the message have not I sent
[1:57:36] thee paragraph 32 I hope you don't mind
[1:57:39] a few quotations mixed in here because
[1:57:41] it helps us to stay focused and when you
[1:57:43] feel that little
[1:57:46] buzzer down in your heart
[1:57:54] my ears so wet that my my microphone
[1:57:57] slipped off my
[1:58:00] ear no wonder we have to replace it all
[1:58:02] the time it gets
[1:58:05] rusted and when you feel that little
[1:58:07] buzzer down in your heart warning you

[1:58:47] another room you may not even hear hear
[1:58:49] it you when that when that
[1:58:52] alarm goes off on in your inner man and

[1:59:18] what take inventory
[1:59:22] we better check up on our payments to
[1:59:24] the Lord he said like I was preaching

[1:59:34] away from
[1:59:39] God when you hear the word come right
[1:59:43] back it's truly the word of God there's
[1:59:46] a little buzzer Rings you better listen
[1:59:49] to
[1:59:50] it because the the next voice you hear
[1:59:53] will tell you she does
[2:00:02] it half the church does
[2:00:06] it so you better listen to the first
[2:00:10] buzz you better hear the first voice
[2:00:13] don't listen don't walk across
[2:00:17] that because if you do that little thing

[2:00:25] a circle after a while it numbs you and
[2:00:27] you don't feel it anymore don't keep
[2:00:29] Crossing that line cuz you'll never get
[2:00:31] any farther till you come right back
[2:00:34] here where you left
[2:00:37] him don't even be I don't want you to
[2:00:40] even be like Joseph and Mary took them
[2:00:42] days
[2:00:44] right they didn't have a dozen children
[2:00:47] but it took them days to realize that
[2:00:49] Jesus wasn't walking with the cousins
[2:00:53] then they realize he's not even with us
[2:00:55] we've got to go back and get him and and
[2:00:56] where did they find him in the town they
[2:00:58] left him and if you keep walking past
[2:01:01] that buzzer you'll realize one day amen
[2:01:05] he's no longer on
[2:01:06] board the brother random said if you get
[2:01:09] dead cats on the line you can't get a
[2:01:11] signal through how many of you believe
[2:01:13] it's time to get all the isms and the
[2:01:15] sisms all the feelings and the
[2:01:18] strangeness and all the things that the
[2:01:20] enemy is trying to put on us us toward
[2:01:23] one
[2:01:24] another it's time to get all that off
[2:01:26] the line anybody
[2:01:29] here in the message letting off pressure
[2:01:31] there's a way back I want to tell you
[2:01:32] there's a way back there's a way back
[2:01:34] tell your neighbor there's a way
[2:01:38] back do you have another neighbor tell
[2:01:40] them turn to the other one there's a way
[2:01:44] back take me back this is letting off
[2:01:48] the pressure take me back to the Rock
[2:01:51] Lord
[2:01:52] take me back I'm drifting oh don't let
[2:01:57] me drift away from it if I'm going to
[2:02:01] eat let me eat around the
[2:02:04] [Applause]
[2:02:09] CFT let me stay close where the Mana is
[2:02:14] falling oh I'm just going to take a
[2:02:16] little break from church
[2:02:22] you was already spoiled now you'll be
[2:02:24] absolutely
[2:02:26] starved well I didn't get anything out
[2:02:28] of it anyway you don't know that there
[2:02:31] are times that just by sitting in the
[2:02:34] atmosphere where the presence of the
[2:02:36] Lord is moving there are things on the
[2:02:38] inside of us that are being shifted
[2:02:40] around and positioned so that God can
[2:02:42] help us out of our mess and we don't
[2:02:44] always feel it it's not always a a a a
[2:02:47] chill or a thrill it's not always hair
[2:02:50] standing up on our arm or or or chill
[2:02:53] bumps Goosebumps or whatever they call
[2:02:56] them sometime we're not feeling anything
[2:02:58] but because we've been
[2:03:00] obedient and we have chosen not to
[2:03:03] forsake the assembling of ourselves
[2:03:05] together even though our attitudes
[2:03:08] rotten and we really don't deserve to
[2:03:10] even be in the presence of the Lord
[2:03:12] there are things that take place
[2:03:13] sometime so you be careful how you say I
[2:03:15] didn't get anything you'll get exactly
[2:03:17] what you come to get and if you get
[2:03:20] anything else that you didn't come for
[2:03:22] Grace come on he said just stay as close
[2:03:25] to where the man is falling I don't have
[2:03:27] to wander
[2:03:28] out if I stay in the
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:33] cliff Mana is laid right at the
[2:03:37] door is that not
[2:03:39] good is that not a beautiful quote I'm
[2:03:42] thankful there's something to hold us
[2:03:44] I'm going to get to something in a
[2:03:45] moment yeah but we're ready for you to
[2:03:46] be done well I'm just
[2:03:48] beginning the absolute he said that's
[2:03:50] why I know the holy spirit is my compass
[2:03:53] that guides me he is the one that makes
[2:03:55] me know his word is true this word is
[2:03:57] true
[2:03:58] he
[2:04:00] he
[2:04:02] he is my
[2:04:04] absolute he is my absolute he is my
[2:04:08] sunshine he is my life he is my anchor
[2:04:13] when troubles are
[2:04:15] on brother amm's telling you he's not
[2:04:17] only the rock that your anchor hits he's
[2:04:20] the anchor
[2:04:21] he's my North Star when I'm lost the
[2:04:25] holy spirit is my
[2:04:27] compass that guides me back to the place
[2:04:30] in another in another place in the
[2:04:32] absolute he said don't figure it
[2:04:35] out somebody read those next two words
[2:04:38] you
[2:04:40] can't don't try to be some kind of
[2:04:43] Theologian here and figure everything
[2:04:45] out you can't you will lose your mind
[2:04:49] trying
[2:04:51] that's
[2:04:53] right well what did he mean by that and
[2:04:55] why did he say this over here and
[2:04:56] something else over
[2:05:03] there I don't have any problem with the
[2:05:06] fact that you'll find something over
[2:05:07] here and a little something different
[2:05:08] over here what I have a problem with is
[2:05:10] when men get up and say it's all thus
[2:05:12] sayith the
[2:05:15] lord it's going to get quiet
[2:05:18] now it's not all thus sayith the Lord
[2:05:21] how do I know what is I thought a
[2:05:23] prophet how do I know how am I going to
[2:05:25] know you're going to know because you're
[2:05:26] going to do what he said there's a
[2:05:28] there's a lazy people that are that are
[2:05:30] identifying themselves as bride there's
[2:05:32] a lazy people in the
[2:05:35] land that don't want to do the
[2:05:40] homework don't you understand that
[2:05:42] everything God did is piled on top like
[2:05:44] this he said line upon line precept upon
[2:05:49] precept don't you know the message came
[2:05:52] in such a manner that we have to take it
[2:05:54] back it's like a teacher giving us a
[2:05:57] homework assignment it's like a tutor
[2:06:00] bringing us to maturity so that we can
[2:06:02] be trusted with the father's business
[2:06:05] you hear what I say and you take it back
[2:06:06] to the word and if you hear me say more
[2:06:09] than one thing about the same thing you
[2:06:11] go back and see what the word says and
[2:06:13] then you'll know
[2:06:15] exactly because Pro because Revelation
[2:06:19] is somewhat Progressive
[2:06:22] it's
[2:06:24] unveiling and I don't think it's safe to
[2:06:26] just say well if it was after 63 or it
[2:06:28] was before I I don't think that's the
[2:06:30] way we ought to interpret this message
[2:06:31] at all I think the best way to interpret
[2:06:34] the message is to let God interpret it
[2:06:36] for us by the word take it back to the
[2:06:40] word and if it
[2:06:45] fits if it Dove Tales like the the
[2:06:48] ticket at the Chinese Laundry then you
[2:06:50] know you've got a f Foundation to stand
[2:06:52] on don't get away from that don't spend
[2:06:55] more time on Google trying to figure it
[2:06:58] out do your homework take it back to the
[2:07:02] Bible we need that my my I I I wished I
[2:07:07] was
[2:07:08] there I wish I was there and you were
[2:07:10] here because I would
[2:07:12] amen you me
[2:07:16] you he said that's why he's my
[2:07:19] compass don't try to Fig figured out
[2:07:22] just believe it that's right now that
[2:07:25] doesn't mean believe it because it's
[2:07:28] hanging out there it means you take that
[2:07:31] back to the word and when you see where
[2:07:33] that's placed believe it with all of
[2:07:36] your heart because it has to be built on
[2:07:39] the same Foundation amen make
[2:07:45] him make him your
[2:07:49] absolute not a printed page not a
[2:07:51] magnetic recording him the Living Word

[2:08:51] here's a few more it's it's just a few
[2:08:53] more mhm evening
[2:08:58] messenger I've had the privilege of
[2:09:00] preaching behind the pull
[2:09:02] pit and in the same church under the
[2:09:05] same pastor at that
[2:09:07] time that hosted brother brandom it was
[2:09:11] the Mesa Church Pastor Roy Carpenter in
[2:09:15] Mesa Arizona 1963 brother Brandon was
[2:09:18] scheduled to come back in the beginning
[2:09:21] of of 1966 and passed away uh uh
[2:09:26] Christmas time
[2:09:29] 1965 but this is a special message if
[2:09:32] you've never heard evening
[2:09:34] messenger paragraph 196 he said that's
[2:09:37] what you Pentecostal people had to
[2:09:39] separate yourself from the rest of the
[2:09:41] world straight with the word now don't
[2:09:44] fade back into the very thing that you
[2:09:47] come out of if you do you're what don't
[2:09:52] cut your anchor from
[2:09:55] Calvary does that sound like a man that
[2:09:57] was trying to attach you to
[2:10:00] himself or does it sound like a man that
[2:10:02] was trying to make sure that you saw who
[2:10:05] the star really
[2:10:08] is it's not the star in his hand that I
[2:10:13] follow it's the one whose hand was
[2:10:16] holding the star that's the one that I
[2:10:20] follow
[2:10:23] melik
[2:10:25] ham the king of the whole
[2:10:28] universe he said hold on to God's word
[2:10:30] for Upon This Rock I'll
[2:10:33] build that's what he said to
[2:10:35] Peter Petro Little Rock chipped off
[2:10:39] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[2:10:41] flesh and blood is not revealed to thee
[2:10:43] you didn't hear this from Mom and Dad
[2:10:44] you didn't hear this from the church
[2:10:46] Cemetery you didn't hear this from some
[2:10:48] a preacher somewhere you received this
[2:10:50] as a Revelation from my father it was a
[2:10:53] revelation that the church wasn't built
[2:10:55] on a piece of
[2:10:57] gravel the church was built on a bigger
[2:11:00] Rock right the one that Peter was
[2:11:03] chipped off of hello and that rock is is
[2:11:07] a
[2:11:08] revelation it can be boiled down if you
[2:11:11] will it can be boiled down Jehovah of
[2:11:14] the Old
[2:11:18] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[2:11:22] the greatest mystery ever
[2:11:24] revealed I quoted that Jehovah of the
[2:11:28] Old Testament is Jesus of the New
[2:11:32] Testament it
[2:11:35] matters it matters if you're still
[2:11:37] following a
[2:11:39] Babylonian threepers
[2:11:42] God you're not following then the god of
[2:11:45] the Bible at that
[2:11:47] point we did all we knew to do we
[2:11:50] followed the best way way that we knew
[2:11:51] how but when God opened our eyes and we
[2:11:55] saw that he's not three different people
[2:11:56] walking around in heaven ringing their
[2:11:58] hands over us but it's one God somebody
[2:12:02] said you know you're you you you're
[2:12:04] you're you're not preaching that Jesus
[2:12:06] is the is the second person in the
[2:12:09] godhead the second person of the Trinity
[2:12:12] no we're not preaching that at all we're
[2:12:14] preaching that Jesus is the only
[2:12:16] person in the
[2:12:18] godhead that's right the rest is eternal
[2:12:22] spirit it's logos it came forth from
[2:12:26] from a great Fountain of
[2:12:28] Light amen and truth and reality but
[2:12:32] when God decided to walk as a person to
[2:12:35] walk in a body of Flesh he's only done
[2:12:37] that completely one
[2:12:39] time it was in the body of our Lord
[2:12:41] Jesus Christ he was the word made flesh
[2:12:44] if you believe that say Amen if you
[2:12:46] don't believe that ask God to open your
[2:12:48] eyes to it that's right because there is
[2:12:51] false
[2:12:53] baptism uh can I be real
[2:12:56] plain well that's easy for some of you
[2:12:58] to say because it's not going to be on
[2:13:01] you but can I say to my precious
[2:13:04] brothers and sisters who've come from
[2:13:07] from
[2:13:08] anabaptist
[2:13:10] background your
[2:13:13] people your
[2:13:15] forefathers
[2:13:17] died
[2:13:18] murdered martyred
[2:13:23] because they had a
[2:13:27] conviction that
[2:13:29] baptism should not be
[2:13:35] infant some of them even saw that it
[2:13:38] should not be
[2:13:41] sprinkled or
[2:13:45] poured some of them had to to pull away
[2:13:48] from their own movements because they
[2:13:50] they saw that it should also be by
[2:13:53] immersion while many of the anabaptist
[2:13:56] went from a few drops to a cup of drops
[2:14:01] do you understand are you making fun no
[2:14:04] no no no I'm not because I think every
[2:14:07] step we make toward the truth should be
[2:14:09] celebrated and we should say God be
[2:14:12] praised I do I do if if you had a cup
[2:14:17] and not a Sprinkle I say praise God you
[2:14:19] were getting closer to the way that it
[2:14:21] was done to our Lord nobody sprinkled
[2:14:24] him nobody poured a cup of water on him
[2:14:27] it's death it's a symbol of death when
[2:14:30] you go down by immersion underneath
[2:14:33] those Waters you are
[2:14:36] symbolizing testifying prophesying I'm a
[2:14:39] part of his
[2:14:41] death and when that preacher pulls you
[2:14:44] up out of that water you're saying to
[2:14:47] God to the world around you to your
[2:14:49] brothers and sisters and to the Devil
[2:14:52] Himself I'm also
[2:14:55] raised with Christ
[2:14:59] Jesus many were murdered simply because
[2:15:01] they said it it shouldn't be a force it
[2:15:04] we shouldn't baptize our infants and
[2:15:06] sprinkle our infants it should be when a
[2:15:09] when a person is old enough to make a
[2:15:10] decision and you would think that that
[2:15:13] that people could just say okay you know
[2:15:15] you may have something
[2:15:17] there but instead their own church
[2:15:22] murdered
[2:15:24] them if you've read Fox's book of
[2:15:27] Martyrs you've only scratched the
[2:15:31] surface take a look at martyr's mirror
[2:15:33] look at some of the anabaptist
[2:15:36] writings and see how that for a simple
[2:15:39] fact you're not going to baptize our
[2:15:42] baby that eventually men and women were
[2:15:46] oh
[2:15:48] hideously horribly
[2:15:51] murdered and here's what breaks my heart
[2:15:54] to my brethren here's what breaks my
[2:15:56] heart for your people to have died
[2:16:00] choosing a truer
[2:16:02] baptism rejecting a false baptism and
[2:16:05] for you to
[2:16:07] remain in a false
[2:16:09] gospel that God is three people and that
[2:16:13] true baptism is in the name of titles
[2:16:16] breaks my
[2:16:18] heart because it was hatched in the very
[2:16:22] same
[2:16:23] system that sprinkled their babies and
[2:16:26] murdered your
[2:16:29] forefathers if you're going all the way
[2:16:32] go all the way back to the word if you
[2:16:35] can't understand ask God open my
[2:16:38] eyes I don't need a three-headed God I
[2:16:41] just need to find the god of the
[2:16:44] Bible I want him to be real in my life
[2:16:48] and I want to wear something more than
[2:16:49] just a title I want to wear his name I
[2:16:53] want to be his wife I desire to be his
[2:16:56] bride don't settle for just coming a
[2:16:59] little way
[2:17:00] out oh spirit of God Holy Ghost get on
[2:17:05] those here today that have received
[2:17:08] already that Revelation May their lives
[2:17:11] become so
[2:17:12] salty may you become so filled with the
[2:17:16] spirit of God that your community begins
[2:17:18] to be transformed
[2:17:24] yes I saw it many years
[2:17:27] ago I saw multitudes of Amish multitudes
[2:17:32] of of anabaptist
[2:17:35] people coming to the message of
[2:17:38] truth I saw myself riding in the back of
[2:17:41] an Amish
[2:17:43] buggy with a Bible on my lap and a
[2:17:46] spoken word book on my lap and and I
[2:17:50] knew that I would live to see and not
[2:17:52] that I've had a part but God knew who to
[2:17:56] use but I knew that I would live to see
[2:18:00] uh some of the of the
[2:18:03] embryonics and when I was sitting in my
[2:18:07] home in
[2:18:10] 201
[2:18:14] 14 what year did Brother green die 2015
[2:18:17] or 2016 honey 2015 I think the year
[2:18:22] before brother green died they
[2:18:25] started 16 in 2015 they started
[2:18:29] streaming I'm off my subject but I don't
[2:18:32] care they started streaming Harmony of
[2:18:35] the
[2:18:36] desert and I didn't have the courage to
[2:18:39] go yet because I didn't I didn't want to
[2:18:42] you know I didn't want to draw attention
[2:18:44] and I it's been years and all all that
[2:18:46] Fellowship broken and whatever but I
[2:18:48] begin to watch these people coming to
[2:18:51] sing and there was a a what do you call
[2:18:54] Mari Mar
[2:18:57] Mariachi I'm I'm not very culturally
[2:19:00] diverse a mariachi band of
[2:19:04] Believers and they got up and played and
[2:19:06] sang their Marchi style of of music with
[2:19:09] Maracas and and
[2:19:12] uh accordion and whatever they had what
[2:19:15] else do they play
[2:19:19] guitars and they s singing the Praises
[2:19:21] of
[2:19:23] God from their culture and I said oh my
[2:19:27] that that really touches my heart and
[2:19:29] then I saw a group of of anabaptist
[2:19:32] people a group of what looked like Amish
[2:19:34] people get up and sing and they began to
[2:19:38] sing on that on that stream that I was
[2:19:41] watching and I knew in that moment I
[2:19:43] knew in that moment that God was doing
[2:19:46] something that he had let me catch a
[2:19:48] glimpse of years before I nearly knocked
[2:19:52] brother Levi fiser down the next year he
[2:19:54] didn't know
[2:19:56] me and I'm big bigger than life sometime
[2:20:00] and when I got to go the next year to
[2:20:02] take sister green and I saw some of
[2:20:04] those same
[2:20:05] people in that meeting and I thought I
[2:20:08] can just go and hug their neck and grab
[2:20:10] a hold of them and and tell them how
[2:20:12] glad I am to meet them but boy I I came
[2:20:14] on too
[2:20:18] strong and brother Levi fish I know his
[2:20:21] children are some of them and relatives
[2:20:23] and church people here but he looked at
[2:20:25] me and he
[2:20:30] goes I said I'm serious
[2:20:33] Brother God's going to do
[2:20:37] something I saw it years ago what did
[2:20:42] you see I began to tell him what I saw
[2:20:45] and he put his hand over my shoulder he
[2:20:46] said tell me
[2:20:49] more he was no longer bothered by my
[2:20:53] bear
[2:20:55] hug or by my tie or whatever else might
[2:20:58] would have caught his
[2:20:59] attention then he was interested and I
[2:21:02] want you to know God is only
[2:21:04] beginning it's only beginning and it's
[2:21:07] got to come quick it's got to come quick
[2:21:09] it's got to come quick because we're
[2:21:11] already entering the season of rapture
[2:21:14] it's got to come
[2:21:16] quick may God touch you that are here to
[2:21:20] come all the way to the revelation of
[2:21:23] who he is as one here oh Israel the Lord
[2:21:27] thy God is one may you soon if you
[2:21:29] haven't already made the choice to be
[2:21:31] baptized in his lovely
[2:21:34] name and then brace
[2:21:38] yourself because when you identify with
[2:21:40] him by
[2:21:42] name all
[2:21:44] hell puts a Target on your head and
[2:21:48] you're going to have to hold on to the
[2:21:49] Rock
[2:21:51] but the rock will hold you if you can't
[2:21:54] hold
[2:21:56] him it's 117 I have a little more
[2:22:04] time in in in another place did I read
[2:22:07] evening messenger yeah no did I don't
[2:22:11] cut your don't I think I did Upon This
[2:22:13] Rock yes let let me do this
[2:22:16] one paragraph 96 it's just like a ship
[2:22:21] a ship has an
[2:22:22] absolute and that ship's
[2:22:25] absolute is the
[2:22:27] anchor now when that ship is tossing
[2:22:29] Waters in tossing Waters where easily
[2:22:32] could be thrown against a rock or
[2:22:33] bursted up or hit ground where the water
[2:22:36] is not deep enough and the great swells
[2:22:38] coming up will Flash the ship and even
[2:22:40] turn it over it's got to have a deep
[2:22:43] enough water to float it it's or the
[2:22:45] waves will turn it over and a ship with
[2:22:47] an
[2:22:48] anchor that's great mighty of metal that
[2:22:51] drops out of steel it goes down until
[2:22:53] the top of the bed of the ocean
[2:22:54] somewhere in a top of a mountain down
[2:22:56] underneath the sea he's
[2:22:59] talking there's something down there and
[2:23:02] that great anchor pulls as the waves
[2:23:04] Rock the ship till it strikes the great
[2:23:06] big Spears into a rock and there the
[2:23:09] ship has an absolute it's anchored waves
[2:23:12] might toss it about but still that ship
[2:23:14] can stand
[2:23:16] still right where it's anchored because
[2:23:19] it's an absolute to it
[2:23:21] and Christ I want to hear you say Christ
[2:23:25] is my
[2:23:26] absolute Christ not your church Christ
[2:23:32] is your absolute you're tied to him in
[2:23:34] that manner no matter what anybody says
[2:23:37] how hard the persecution gets how bad
[2:23:39] the storm seems to be how it looks
[2:23:41] impossible for it to
[2:23:44] happen go
[2:23:46] on is there
[2:23:48] more if something has happened to in you
[2:23:51] that Christ becomes your absolute or any
[2:23:54] promise in the Bible becomes your
[2:23:55] absolute if you're sick and you're
[2:23:57] praying for healing and something comes
[2:23:59] to that strikes that promise in the
[2:24:01] Bible I've got it there's nothing going
[2:24:05] to wave you from it say Amen there's
[2:24:09] nothing Charles virgon said this I have
[2:24:12] learned to kiss the
[2:24:16] waves that throws me against the Rock of
[2:24:22] Ages don't waste another minute of your
[2:24:25] life I'm coming to the last
[2:24:28] section don't waste another minute of
[2:24:30] your life cursing the
[2:24:33] circumstances that have brought you
[2:24:34] where you are
[2:24:35] today God picked them he chose
[2:24:38] them the prophet says he harnesses
[2:24:41] troubles and problems he harnesses them
[2:24:44] to use them to execute his purposes in
[2:24:47] your life every heartache I'm so sorry
[2:24:50] for your hurts I'm sorry for your
[2:24:54] tragedies I'm sorry for your
[2:24:58] griefs he was not a stranger to
[2:25:01] grief he was not a stranger to tragic
[2:25:04] betrayals or to
[2:25:07] persecution and he's close to those who
[2:25:10] have broken hearts and I'm sorry that
[2:25:13] you had to go through it and some of it
[2:25:14] was so
[2:25:16] awful that it would be understandable
[2:25:21] that it affected the rest of your
[2:25:23] life but please know
[2:25:25] this that God may not have been the
[2:25:28] author of
[2:25:29] it because sometimes God isn't the
[2:25:34] instigator but he takes advantage he
[2:25:38] harnesses that that happens sometime and
[2:25:41] he will always use what touches your
[2:25:44] life for his glory to shape you to mold
[2:25:48] you to make you to what you should be
[2:25:50] today those waves are chosen and
[2:25:53] orchestrated not to destroy you but
[2:25:55] rather to preserve You by throwing us
[2:25:59] repeatedly against the solid
[2:26:02] rock the solid
[2:26:05] answer our only
[2:26:08] hope is found in him we all know what

[2:26:14] nothing but in
[2:26:16] everything well if you're like
[2:26:19] me and you're reading that without a
[2:26:21] little study or without the Holy Spirit

[2:26:29] whatever you do just just don't even be
[2:26:31] careful just just do what no no no no no
[2:26:33] no that's old English you you've got to
[2:26:36] find out somehow how to to put that in
[2:26:38] some understanding it's not telling you
[2:26:40] not to be
[2:26:41] careful it's not telling you not to Be
[2:26:44] watchful let let me read it to you in
[2:26:46] this version it says do not fret
[2:26:50] or have any
[2:26:52] anxiety about
[2:26:55] anything but in every circumstance

[2:27:50] understanding it shall Garrison and
[2:27:53] mount guard over your hearts and
[2:27:57] Minds in Christ Jesus hasn't he done

[2:29:52] miracle or have a fish
[2:29:55] sandwich come on I want his presence few
[2:29:59] more minutes he doesn't need to perform
[2:30:02] a miracle to keep me around that's right
[2:30:05] I want him not just the blessings I want
[2:30:08] the
[2:30:09] blesser not just the gifts I want the
[2:30:13] giver
[2:30:15] Moses said just Show Me Your Glory
[2:30:20] and I need to read these verses for you
[2:30:22] to get this Exodus 33: 21-23 and the
[2:30:25] Lord said
[2:30:28] behold there is a
[2:30:33] place by
[2:30:35] me
[2:30:37] huh by me God said I've got a
[2:30:41] place by
[2:30:43] me and thou shalt
[2:30:47] stand not on a sifting sand
[2:30:50] come on help me now we're closing we're
[2:30:53] in this last
[2:30:54] cycle hear it you sure are asking I know
[2:30:58] I'm begging I'm begging on I I don't
[2:31:00] even care to be it doesn't bother me to
[2:31:02] beg you to hear it I want you to hear it
[2:31:04] and see if it lines up with the word
[2:31:06] because if it lines up with the word it
[2:31:08] might help you on the
[2:31:11] journey there's a place by
[2:31:14] me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and
[2:31:17] it shall come to pass
[2:31:22] while my
[2:31:24] Glory passees
[2:31:28] by that I will put
[2:31:32] thee in what King James
[2:31:34] translators translated
[2:31:37] Clift of the
[2:31:40] rock now when you hear the word Clift
[2:31:43] what do you think about a a
[2:31:46] bluff a place up on a mountain
[2:31:51] somewhere that you could stand on and
[2:31:54] look over a cliff in Modern English we
[2:31:58] take the tea off and we say it's a
[2:32:02] cliff but that word is not enough Cliff
[2:32:07] or
[2:32:08] Cliff because that word comes from a
[2:32:12] Hebrew word that doesn't mean just a
[2:32:16] particular Overlook on a mountain
[2:32:20] it means something more so hold on a
[2:32:23] moment I will put thee in a cliff of The
[2:32:26] Rock and will cover thee with my hand
[2:32:30] while I pass by are you following that
[2:32:35] and I will take away my hand and thou
[2:32:38] shalt see my back
[2:32:41] Parts but my face shall not be
[2:32:45] seen now remember this what God was
[2:32:48] showing Moses Was preparing him to write
[2:32:51] the first five books of the
[2:32:54] Bible God said I'm going to show you my
[2:32:56] hinder parts do you know what that
[2:32:58] really means to us God was saying I'm
[2:33:00] going to show you where I've
[2:33:02] been Moses you weren't
[2:33:04] around but I'm going to show you what
[2:33:06] I've done and though Moses was not there
[2:33:11] in the beginning right Genesis
[2:33:14] 11 he was able to write that's right the
[2:33:18] first five books of the Bible through a
[2:33:21] scribe telling every detail and then God
[2:33:25] said and then God said and then God said
[2:33:28] and then God said he wasn't
[2:33:31] there how did he
[2:33:33] know because on that mountain he said I
[2:33:36] want to see your glory and God said if
[2:33:39] you're going to understand my present
[2:33:43] glory and catch a glimpse of my future
[2:33:48] Glory
[2:33:50] you're going to have to see my
[2:33:52] [Music]
[2:33:54] glory from the
[2:33:56] backside you're going to have to see the
[2:33:59] glory that I have already brought forth
[2:34:02] in
[2:34:03] creation and so Moses under the
[2:34:05] leadership of the Holy Spirit sits with
[2:34:08] a scribe and writes the first five books
[2:34:10] of the Bible as though he were an
[2:34:12] eyewitness somebody say that's
[2:34:16] remarkable sometimes you ask God for
[2:34:18] something you don't get get it just the
[2:34:20] way you think you're going to get it but
[2:34:22] you get something good Moses got
[2:34:24] something good the grace the ability the
[2:34:26] inspiration to write the first five
[2:34:28] books of the Bible as though he were an
[2:34:30] eyewitness because God let him see the
[2:34:32] hinder part he let him see what he had
[2:34:34] done are you still following me but it
[2:34:36] gets even better a
[2:34:39] Clift not a Clift in English it says
[2:34:43] Clift it's a cleft the Hebrew word says
[2:34:47] cleft and the cleft is different than a
[2:34:53] cliff a Clift is a place that is a
[2:34:59] result of a
[2:35:02] cleaving that has taken
[2:35:04] place a cleaving is the opening up or
[2:35:09] the breaking open of something unusually
[2:35:14] hard or
[2:35:16] solid a cleaving is a smid
[2:35:21] a
[2:35:22] striking that occurs by an earthquake
[2:35:25] sometimes and The Rock opens up hear it
[2:35:31] the rock opens up and in the opening of
[2:35:36] The
[2:35:37] Rock an earthquake
[2:35:40] splits The Rock and in the opening the
[2:35:45] the Hebrew word is translated
[2:35:48] whole you're going to stand in a hole in
[2:35:52] the
[2:35:53] Rock yes Lord amen oh Jesus today
[2:35:59] tomorrow and every day for the rest of
[2:36:02] my life let me stand in the hole in the
[2:36:04] Rock let me live in the cleaving of the
[2:36:08] rock let me live in the caft of the rock
[2:36:12] hide me in the hole that you have opened
[2:36:15] up for me in the Rock are you do you
[2:36:19] seem to all of that in that CFT in that
[2:36:23] cleaving in that smiting in that opening
[2:36:27] up of the rock Moses was to stand God
[2:36:30] said that's right by
[2:36:32] me I've got a place for you right by me
[2:36:36] in a hole in the
[2:36:40] Rock You preachers could preach this
[2:36:42] better than I if you caught that I don't
[2:36:45] even hardly have the words to preach it
[2:36:47] Moses I've got a hole right next to me
[2:36:50] and when you get in that hole you can
[2:36:52] see my glory you can see what I have
[2:36:54] done you can see a revel you see
[2:36:57] folks God said Moses go to the Clift
[2:37:00] stand in the position of Where The Rock
[2:37:02] was
[2:37:03] smitten from that perspective and
[2:37:06] Viewpoint you can see my glory remember
[2:37:09] Moses also smoted a rock at one point
[2:37:12] and the Striking of that rock caused a
[2:37:14] what not a
[2:37:17] cliff it caused a cliff
[2:37:21] the smiting did what it opened up the
[2:37:23] rock didn't it and what happened when
[2:37:27] the rock opened up anybody with me water
[2:37:31] began to flow out of the hole in the
[2:37:32] Rock God knew exactly what he was doing
[2:37:36] brother random said the next time he
[2:37:38] should have spoken to The
[2:37:39] Rock he said he threw everything in
[2:37:42] God's economy out of cater when he
[2:37:44] struck it the second time because he
[2:37:46] said Christ has been forever smitten
[2:37:51] once and you never has to be smitten
[2:37:54] again now all we have to do
[2:38:02] is now all we have to do is speak to the
[2:38:04] Rock do you understand what is available
[2:38:08] to
[2:38:09] us because of the hole in the
[2:38:13] Rock do you understand what has been
[2:38:15] made available to us for daily Su
[2:38:18] sustenance and
[2:38:20] and and sustaining Grace because the
[2:38:23] rock was opened up because the rock was
[2:38:24] struck because the rock was
[2:38:27] smitten 1 Corinthians 10:4 the Apostle
[2:38:30] caught it in the New Testament and he
[2:38:32] said and they did all drink the same
[2:38:34] spiritual drink for they
[2:38:43] drank
[2:38:46] W Hallelujah
[2:38:50] they all drank
[2:38:52] water that came out of the
[2:38:55] rock but it this wasn't just any
[2:38:58] Rock This Rock was a type of
[2:39:02] Christ this
[2:39:05] rock it followed
[2:39:08] them what does that represent somebody
[2:39:10] said I don't think that was was was you
[2:39:12] know I think that
[2:39:14] was you know just totally
[2:39:18] symbolic well I'd like to I'd like to
[2:39:21] agree with your interpretation except
[2:39:22] for the fact that the New Testament word
[2:39:24] in Greek there for
[2:39:26] followed doesn't mean something that
[2:39:28] fell in
[2:39:31] squits it doesn't mean something that
[2:39:33] just sort of flowed out of a of a
[2:39:35] situation it followed it followed them
[2:39:37] it it no no the word that is used there
[2:39:41] means
[2:39:44] followed you understand what it means to
[2:39:47] follow come on Elli stand up the folks
[2:39:50] are missing I don't want them to miss
[2:39:52] this follow
[2:39:54] me is he behind me is he is he way back
[2:39:58] there if he's way back there he's not
[2:40:01] following me
[2:40:02] oh do it one more
[2:40:07] [Applause]
[2:40:11] time that's why I chose you yeah because
[2:40:15] I knew you knew it you do
[2:40:17] it that rock
[2:40:22] followed
[2:40:23] them they didn't know it they didn't
[2:40:27] understand it they were living in a in a
[2:40:30] covenant that was to open up to a newer
[2:40:32] Covenant but Moses perhaps maybe Joshua
[2:40:35] maybe some of the people would
[2:40:41] say that's a mighty familiar Rock
[2:40:46] there have we passed this way before
[2:40:51] have we ever I don't remember this
[2:40:52] particular spot but that rock looks so
[2:40:58] familiar it's because that rock was a
[2:41:02] type every place they went God wanted
[2:41:05] them to see the type of the rock that
[2:41:08] had been smitten for them amen I I could
[2:41:12] show it to you in archaeology if you
[2:41:14] needed to see
[2:41:16] it it came from the same mountain range
[2:41:18] of hor
[2:41:20] it's such a beautiful
[2:41:22] picture God is simply saying the rock is
[2:41:27] Christ The Rock has a Clift in it and
[2:41:30] that is where Moses was standing he
[2:41:33] didn't understand the
[2:41:34] fullness but God said I'm not going to
[2:41:36] talk to you out there on the edge I've
[2:41:39] got a hole right next to me I've Got A
[2:41:42] Plan of Redemption that you're a
[2:41:44] forerunner of because there's coming
[2:41:47] another one and he will be like you
[2:41:49] Moses he will be a prophet like you are
[2:41:52] but he will be so much more he'll be
[2:41:54] savior he'll be Redeemer he'll be
[2:42:00] healer in fact he will be salvation and
[2:42:04] his mother will call him
[2:42:06] Yeshua because his name means
[2:42:11] salvation that's where we've got to
[2:42:13] stand we've got to find that place in
[2:42:16] the rock musicians are coming slowly
[2:42:20] normally I tell you to come quickly come
[2:42:21] slowly but
[2:42:23] come not like
[2:42:26] elas fast moving but just like a wedding
[2:42:30] march come because I want to say
[2:42:33] something else Romans 66 knowing
[2:42:37] this that our old
[2:42:39] man is
[2:42:41] crucified with
[2:42:43] him you can't understand that in the
[2:42:47] world you can't understand that in
[2:42:50] church you can't understand that in
[2:42:53] religion the only place that you can
[2:42:55] understand that verse knowing this that
[2:42:57] our old man is crucified with him that
[2:42:59] the body of sin might be destroyed that
[2:43:01] henceforth we should not serve sin the
[2:43:04] only way that you can understand that is
[2:43:05] if you'll stand in the
[2:43:10] cliff you've got to stand in the smitten
[2:43:14] Christ you've got to see it from the
[2:43:17] perspective of the rock that was opened
[2:43:18] up for for
[2:43:20] you you remember when that
[2:43:23] Soldier he's already
[2:43:26] dead
[2:43:30] soldier thrust that sword to make sure
[2:43:34] that he's
[2:43:35] dead and blood and water did what it
[2:43:38] come flowing
[2:43:40] out it wasn't
[2:43:44] urine it was the fluid it was it was
[2:43:47] pericardium fluid
[2:43:50] it was the fluid from the pericardium
[2:43:53] which is the fluid in the sack around
[2:43:56] the human
[2:43:58] heart that's
[2:44:00] heart underneath the load of his pain
[2:44:03] hear it his Agony his suffering his
[2:44:06] crucifixion the
[2:44:15] cruestv
[2:44:17] his par
[2:44:19] cardium the protective sack around the
[2:44:22] heart
[2:44:24] exploded you've heard the expression he
[2:44:27] died she died of a broken heart it's
[2:44:29] really a
[2:44:30] thing it's not the heart itself that
[2:44:33] explodes it's the sack around the heart
[2:44:35] the pressure builds up in the
[2:44:36] pericardial
[2:44:38] fluid and it ex and it burst and there's
[2:44:41] there's I don't know I I'm sorry I don't
[2:44:43] remember the amount of water that's
[2:44:45] there but quite amount of water and it
[2:44:47] runs down loose through the body it has
[2:44:49] no vein to carry it it just runs loose
[2:44:52] down into the organs and it it will
[2:44:54] settle down in the extremities of the
[2:44:57] body the bottoms of the digestive system
[2:44:59] and that spear went right in his
[2:45:03] side and when it did not only did his
[2:45:05] life's blood what was
[2:45:07] left of his life's blood not only did
[2:45:10] that run out but that paracardial
[2:45:13] fluid it came running out as
[2:45:16] well brother brandom said that's a type
[2:45:20] in the same manner that Eve was taken
[2:45:23] out of Adam that day at
[2:45:26] Calvary symbolically God was taking his
[2:45:29] bride out of the
[2:45:31] side of the crucified
[2:45:34] savior that's
[2:45:37] powerful why is that powerful because it
[2:45:39] explains scripture I was with him when
[2:45:41] he
[2:45:42] died I wasn't physically with him I was
[2:45:45] symbolically spiritually type in a type
[2:45:48] I was with him
[2:45:49] and when he when that narrow hole was
[2:45:53] pierced and the blood and the water
[2:45:55] flowed out he said it was like Eve being
[2:45:57] taken out of Adam bride being taken out
[2:45:59] of Christ I am that
[2:46:03] bride the Bobby said I am that
[2:46:06] Revival I'm waiting on somebody here to
[2:46:08] say I am that
[2:46:10] bride that day at Calvary I was a part
[2:46:14] of him before the foundation of the
[2:46:17] world I was a part of of
[2:46:20] him died with him raised with
[2:46:26] him brother bam said I was with Paul
[2:46:31] rever when he rode his midnight
[2:46:35] ride I was with George Washington when
[2:46:38] he crossed the
[2:46:40] Delaware well somebody said this is a
[2:46:42] fanatic
[2:46:44] talking he's hundreds of years old he
[2:46:48] didn't mean he was physically in the
[2:46:50] boat he didn't mean he was physically on
[2:46:52] the horse he said I am an
[2:46:56] American and therefore I'm identified
[2:46:59] with her her risings her fallings her
[2:47:02] Goods her bads I'm identified with her
[2:47:05] listen when you get a revelation that
[2:47:07] you are identified with Christ that you
[2:47:09] died with
[2:47:11] him you suffered with him you died with
[2:47:16] him you raised with with
[2:47:20] him it's it's it's it's something you
[2:47:24] can't understand in church
[2:47:27] anity you've got to be standing in the
[2:47:29] place where the rock was opened up thank
[2:47:33] God for
[2:47:34] Revelation thank God for the hole in the
[2:47:37] Rock Lord let me live there somebody
[2:47:39] ought to want to live there he said
[2:47:42] you're bury Colossians uh Romans 6:4
[2:47:44] therefore we're buried by with him by
[2:47:46] baptism into death Colossians 2:12
[2:47:48] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[2:47:50] you are risen with him through the faith
[2:47:52] of the operation of God who had raised
[2:47:55] him from the perspective of being in the
[2:47:58] same place where Christ was smitten we
[2:48:00] can see the
[2:48:02] glory we can't we won't just see past
[2:48:06] Glory we can begin to see present Glory
[2:48:10] we can begin to see future Glory if we
[2:48:14] if we remain cleaving come
[2:48:17] on hide
[2:48:20] oh God it's not the bosom of Abraham
[2:48:24] that I want to hide in I want to hide in

[2:49:05] faith they bite and chew and devour and

[2:49:18] can L keep your head above
[2:49:20] it but he opened up the rock he said
[2:49:24] come on
[2:49:29] children I've opened up my
[2:49:34] side do you remember where you came
[2:49:37] from he said come on
[2:49:41] back come back I've got a place by
[2:49:45] me that I want you to hide when the
[2:49:49] storm is
[2:49:51] Raging I don't want you to be
[2:49:53] drifting I want you to be
[2:49:59] anchored is it possible to play soft oh

[2:50:12] Kate when the storms of life are raging
[2:50:16] Stand By Me Yes amen
[2:50:21] when what you once
[2:50:24] trusted is shaking and you you're no
[2:50:27] longer sure about what's what really is
[2:50:32] and what really
[2:50:33] isn't he said I've got a place not just
[2:50:36] Moses come
[2:50:38] on Daniel
[2:50:41] berer Billy
[2:50:43] TBO
[2:50:45] Brent brother Miller
[2:50:50] he said come on I've got a place by
[2:50:58] me this is why it's so important for us
[2:51:00] to see that we died with Christ once you
[2:51:03] stand in that vantage point and look at
[2:51:05] everything from that perspective nothing
[2:51:07] can defeat you there is no offense there
[2:51:10] is no bitterness there is no jealousy
[2:51:13] there's no envy that can live with you
[2:51:16] and in you for any period of time time
[2:51:20] if you
[2:51:21] choose to remain in the hole in the
[2:51:24] Clift of the Rock in the Smit in
[2:51:29] Christ it's Union with him on a level
[2:51:32] that only the true bride will ever be
[2:51:34] able to fully participate in because she
[2:51:37] was one with him from the
[2:51:41] beginning you don't have to know this
[2:51:43] message or the name William brandom to
[2:51:46] be saved amen you have to know the name
[2:51:50] Jesus you have to call on the name with
[2:51:52] sincerity of faith not just use it as a
[2:51:55] swear word but with all your heart Jesus
[2:51:59] have mercy on me and the Bible said
[2:52:02] whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[2:52:04] Lord shall be saved but that doesn't
[2:52:07] make you an
[2:52:09] overcomer and the spirit of this age
[2:52:12] will toss you and torment you and harass
[2:52:15] you until the
[2:52:17] last but for that little
[2:52:20] bride there's a place in his side it's a
[2:52:24] revelation it's not a physical location
[2:52:28] it's a
[2:52:28] revelation hide in his side get back to
[2:52:32] the Rock let your anchor grip don't kiss
[2:52:36] and run
[2:52:39] cleave he said there in Deuteronomy
[2:52:42] those who who participated in that
[2:52:45] debauchery they die
[2:52:48] and the ones you don't kill the plague
[2:52:50] 24,000 the plague took out until one
[2:52:53] righteous man said I've taken all I can
[2:52:55] take here we are standing before the
[2:52:58] altar of the Lord it says all of Israel
[2:53:00] was weeping before the altar of the Lord
[2:53:02] and here comes an Israelite who had rode
[2:53:05] the back pew his whole
[2:53:10] life he had rode the back pew he had
[2:53:13] said let me see how far I can get away
[2:53:16] and still be identified
[2:53:19] as a
[2:53:23] Christian and here come a hor
[2:53:26] woman and in the midst of repentance in
[2:53:29] the midst of the whole nation weeping
[2:53:31] before the altar of the Lord he took her
[2:53:33] in his tent and lay with
[2:53:35] her and the righteous indignation of the
[2:53:38] Lord fell on one
[2:53:41] Phineas and he said I can't stand it
[2:53:44] anymore how you could continue to commit
[2:53:47] fornication
[2:53:49] in the very vicinity of the altar of the
[2:53:54] Lord and those who cleaved to me in that
[2:53:59] hour Moses said the ones who cleaved to
[2:54:02] the Lord they were they were pardoned
[2:54:03] and granted a
[2:54:08] life this is
[2:54:10] it I'm not intending to be a
[2:54:14] liar Exodus 34:5 and the Lord descended
[2:54:17] in the cloud
[2:54:19] and stood with him there where in the
[2:54:21] place The Rock was smitten and
[2:54:22] proclaimed the Lord declared the
[2:54:26] name of the
[2:54:28] Lord the Lord declared the name of the
[2:54:32] Lord and the Lord passed by before him
[2:54:36] and proclaimed the Lord the Lord
[2:54:40] God
[2:54:42] merciful and gracious you can't see him
[2:54:47] like that in church
[2:54:50] anity he becomes the judge in church
[2:54:53] anity he
[2:54:55] becomes someone that is feared not
[2:54:58] reverential fear terrifying paralyzing
[2:55:02] fear like some have feared the
[2:55:05] bishop fear man's religion
[2:55:10] produces
[2:55:12] fear but when the Lord came to Moses he
[2:55:16] proclaimed his own name and he said said
[2:55:18] the Lord the Lord God read this with me
[2:55:22] merciful
[2:55:26] and that's the
[2:55:29] glory it's the glory for you
[2:55:33] now to know that you were in Christ that
[2:55:37] your sins were nailed to the cross if
[2:55:40] you'll walk away from them and cling and
[2:55:44] cleave to the
[2:55:46] Rock You Will will not face the Wrath
[2:55:49] and Judgment of a righteous God he'll
[2:55:52] hide you in his
[2:55:54] side until the storm passes over there's
[2:55:58] a little bride in Union with him who
[2:56:00] seeing God merciful and gracious long
[2:56:04] put it back up for me would you aren't
[2:56:07] you glad let me tell you some of you
[2:56:09] folks have given him a
[2:56:13] fit he had to be
[2:56:16] longsuffering is there anybody here
[2:56:17] you're willing to say I'm one of them he
[2:56:19] had to be longsuffering or he' have
[2:56:21] thrown me out a long time ago he just
[2:56:23] kept drawing me
[2:56:25] back the Lord is merciful and gracious
[2:56:28] longsuffering and
[2:56:31] abundant that's what you need a
[2:56:33] revelation of goodness and Truth Listen
[2:56:36] the rest of it I heard you're right
[2:56:38] keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving
[2:56:41] iniquity and transgression and sin and
[2:56:44] that will by no means clear the guilty
[2:56:47] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[2:56:49] upon the children and upon the
[2:56:50] children's children under the third and
[2:56:52] the fourth generation somebody said for
[2:56:54] what what in the world does that
[2:56:56] mean it means there's a way for God to
[2:56:59] separate you from the generational
[2:57:02] iniquity of your family your fathers
[2:57:05] he's got a place by him in his side that
[2:57:08] breaks the
[2:57:10] curse but it only works if you
[2:57:14] cleave if you cling if you drift
[2:57:19] your sin will Dash you and rock
[2:57:23] you and rip
