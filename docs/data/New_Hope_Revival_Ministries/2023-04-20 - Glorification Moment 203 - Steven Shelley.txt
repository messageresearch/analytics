Description:
This is the hour of glorification and adoption of the Bride.  The Father is about to drape His robe over our shoulder and say to the whole community, “Hear what he or she has to say.  The Bride doesn’t speak of himself or herself anymore.  They only speak of the Glorified Christ.”  
We are now living in the time of transition from Bride to Wife, and He is about to dress us in His authority.
