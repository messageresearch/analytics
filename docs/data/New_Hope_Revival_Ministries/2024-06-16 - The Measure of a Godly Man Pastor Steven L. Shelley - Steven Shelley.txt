ready yet uh the plumbing is still going on and uh the work continues I need $30,000 for air conditioning system but I know that my Lord has what is needed there because uh even though it is well

here we're thankful for the cool air thank you Olivia uh we're just grateful for how the Lord has provided thus far for the the building project down there uh we are so thankful to be debt free here

gave him all of my heart and I thought that I couldn't love him anymore and I did right at the start now I look back over the mountains and The Valleys where I've been it makes me know that I love him so much more than I did there and I keep falling in love with them over and over and over and over again I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again he gets sweeter and sweeter As Days Go By oh what a love between my Lord and I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again there's a hand that I hold on to through each Valley and each trial there's a shoulder that I lean upon as I face another M there's a love that I can depend on it's fresh and new each day and with love my heart is overflowing that is why I say oh I keep falling in love with Jesus over and over over and over over again I keep falling in love with Jesus over and over over and over again he gets sweeter and sweeter As Days Go By oh what a love between my Lord and I I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again there's a hand that I hold on to through each FY and each trial there's a shorter that I le as I face another mile there's a love that I can depend on it's fresh and new each day and with love my heart is overflowing that is why I say oh I can't keep falling in love with Jesus over and over over and over again I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again he gets sweeter and sweeter days go by oh what a love between my Lord and I Can We Stand Together As we sing the course again our Pastor

it's not just a song it's not just a song we really should be in that place where we're falling in love with him more and more every day we don't want our love to grow cold the Bible tells us that iniquity abounds and the love of many shall wax cold our love for Jesus has to be red hot God bless you you may be seated it has to be red hot and the only way to do that is to have fellowship with him come on now to have fellowship with him when you're listening to a tape and you're hearing the word from for our day sir it's not just for you to hear it it's for you to fellowship with it somebody said what do you mean well you've got to pay attention to it I don't care who's there if it's a truth say Amen you're riding down the road you hearing brother brandom he said something you believe it to be the truth or whoever but you need to hear that you say Amen well somebody will think I'm crazy no crazier than the one riding down the road texting or FaceTiming you you're the right kind of crazy and worship is essential to praise him and to worship Him is essential it's not optional somebody said well we don't all have to praise the Lord the same way we do have to praise him the Bible way it's the only of Praise that he will receive sir I want to apologize to the visitors for having this loeng in my in my mouth it's because of a dry mouth condition but I'm Healed uh by the stripes that he bore at calary you don't have to wait till you get here to praise you can praise him every single day of your life the Bible tells us raise your hands clap your hands you use your hands to play instruments the Bible tells us stand in praise it even talks about sitting and pray kneeling in Praise even laying prostate prostrate before the Lord in praise and he tells us to use our voice and he even tells us what kind of a voice to use there is a time that we should use a loud voice yes yes sir I know the worship here is Rowdy for a lot of people but we didn't tailor it for you we tailored it after the book of Psalms somebody say well I don't know what they're doing waving that piece of cloth around the Bible tells us to lift up a standard that word is a flag so if somebody wants to wave a I don't care if that's what they want to do they've got Bible for it and if the critics have a problem with it that is just fine with me we didn't come here to please one another or to or to be a part of any other church or organization we've come to worship him and I want you to know I'm proud of you I know pride is not the right word to use but I'm proud of you this morning for for worshiping him for for not letting anything change the way you you come to give him praise he's worthy I want to tell you something he's worthy and he deserves the highest praise the highest praise we have a few little preliminary things that we want to get out of the way so we can bring the word today brother Shane your daughter Abigail is not with you today but it's her birthday today Father's Day and her birthday I chose to call her name out so that everyone will remember her and that you will pray for her that God would meet all of her needs and if she were here we would certainly wish her a happy birthday but if you think about it brother Shane let her know that we have done that tomorrow uh excuse me Tuesday is uh Michael Christian uh it's his birthday he is not in here right this second oh there he is he he's the dad of twins he he's a father's father twice over and uh Tuesday is his birthday you want to tell us how many cuz I just simply don't remember 38 how did that happen I don't really know how it happened Wednesday June the 19th is my wife Stacy's father brother Ron Whitaker who's streaming this service in Canada today we say happy happy birthday to

keep it up and sister Flo just so you'll remember Thursday is your grandson Jason's birthday and he's a faithful friend of mine and I want to send him a happy birthday I'll try my best to text him that day Saturday is Hawk and Mary Beth's B uh uh no you don't share a birthday you share an anniversary how how many years 17 I was there when it happened and you'd think I'd keep up with it 17 years and yet when brother Hawk wished me a happy birthday uh listen to me a Happy Father's Day this morning I had to think a minute whether to wish him one back pray for me right he is a father and has been for a long time now you know I don't I guess I've told you all before you all share a birthday with brother uh Lord I don't believe it's going to be this way all the way out I I believe that uh I I'm going to do better with my memory and my words here you share an anniversary with brother Brandon and sister hope I don't know if you remember that or not and also on that day brother brandom spoke to the little fish and told him I give you your life back somebody said who needs a silly story like that I do I do because it reminds me that the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride have you ever prayed for your little doggy or your oh yes have you ever seen God do a miracle if God can heal a possum he can heal a person he's just the same God so I like to remember that now I have an announcement to make this very special I'm going to take my Leng out to make it um very special announcement it's it's exciting for all of you that are here and that will be here this year at camp meeting but it's also more special for someone who is streaming the service today and uh brother George in the Netherlands sister veronique and the girls it's so wonderful to be connected with you all this way we love you very much brother George your daughters Sharon and natana they um they reached out to me a from the Netherlands and they wanted me to wish you you a very happy Father's Day today and to tell you how much they love you and appreciate you and brother George they also wanted me to tell you that God has made a way a miraculous provision for you and Sharon the youngest daughter to come to camp meeting this year and be here with us for a few weeks your family has kept this from you and they wanted me to be the one to tell you today so brother George you're you and Sharon are coming to Alabama in the fall it's been 15 years since you were here God bless you we love [Applause] you it's incredible and when those girls sent that email can't would you absolutely I want to be a part of it and what a blessing what a wonderful history we have had with that family with brother George's dear Mom and Dad who have gone on to be with the Lord how wonderful it was to meet them living in the Netherlands originally the dad from Indonesia and had lived his life there had found the Lord and they eventually found this great truth that God has given to us and they've been here many times but but Sharon Rose has never been because she come along after they have been away for so long so this is going to be a very special time and we're very very excited about that I want to say to Lucas is he awake or asleep or Lucas I am so sorry that I left your name off my birthday list last week I put no but I forgot to put you and that's not because she's more special because you're pretty special yourself so as a whole church we want to say happy birthday to you I know it was yesterday but this is our chance to wish you a happy birthday God bless you we love [Applause] you I want to know who the oldest Father Here is today but I know it's you brother brother sha it's hard to believe it's hard to believe you you weren't so very old when I met you 30 years ago and we had so many older men with us then brother hey brother skipworth brother tibo so many others and one by one they have gone to be with the Lord and you're you're here and you're still getting older and that's all right how old are you you have to tell that to get this gift card 65 that doesn't seem so old right now it's it's in view for me come on brother would you all wish brother Shaw a Happy Father's day God bless you brother praise the Lord I love you about 30 plus years he's been faithful you say what you want to about brother Shaw we kid him awful hard about being the oldest dad because it doesn't seem right for the oldest dad to be that young really but he's a faithful man he goes to the street festivals and maybe they play all kind of music but he doesn't go for the music he give that up long time ago but he walks around looking for somebody to tell the Lord about he he's even a YouTube sensation Cu uh he he he found some hardheads down there one day and somebody filmed it and it's on YouTube he's an influencer at brother Shaw is he doesn't care who he meets he's going to tell them that Jesus is Lord and that you need to be born again and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he'll tell them and so he's worthy of his uh little bit of Honor that we can give him today who is the youngest father here let see David you're you're not Young no more I mean you are and

[Applause] praise I know we're taking extra time but we're just doing it it's what we do Father's Day Mother's Day we just do it now I know brother Robert has mentioned last year maybe that he had had

appreciate you saying that and somehow you're acquainted with an old friend of mine brother Tommy mckinstry in Scotland is that right Northern Ireland that's right I met him in Scotland but he's that's right I'm sorry your buddies I have Haven either longer than you probably because he wasn't even a married man when I saw him last me too but I didn't get your message I didn't I didn't I've looked I can't find it anywhere but yes yes yes yes yes do you preach yeah I could tell you keep warning to drag it [Applause] out he's going to he's going to leave here and he's going to say don't ever visit that church they abuse visitors they abuse visitors they treat visitors terrible your family is most welcome here today we're a strange crowd but we're glad you Among Us you probably the most normal people here no no no I'm I I'm kind of beginning to think that yes God is so good he's so good what else was I supposed to do anything else before we leave today we'll have the fathers come up we'll pray over them and and they each get one of these gifts here every father we want to bless them we are blessed we're so blessed uh I didn't have a father in my life he he was alive but he wasn't n in my life except the first five years of my life and uh we hoped and prayed for so many years that there would be a reunion but it just wasn't possible and then uh uh couple three years ago he he went uh went home I pray I pray that we will have Fellowship together through the endless ages uh I was told by a very good friend of his that he had had seriously called on the Lord and if that's the case there'll be no memory there'll be no memory of the past and we'll be brothers forever you know that's the way it works I was terrified to become a dad but God has been gracious and I made a lot of mistakes and so if Benjamin will just learn from my mistakes and not make them then he will be an amazing father to Elana Elana Jane he absolutely will would you stand we could sing brother Kate it don't seem right you're not singing but you'll have to sing too next time we better get on now don't we have amazing musicians let's love and thank God for every one of [Music] [Applause] them sister Naomi is uh is telling me from the Netherlands that you preached a few times at granddad's Church which is brother Peter Hall you remember brother Peter maybe his has an S on it is it Halls do you remember preaching for him is that who she yes yes I preached for him many times so Naomi recognizes you they're streaming in the Netherlands today and her and her husband well send it yourself put the camera on him Naomi he's sending you greetings this is fun I I was Pro I probably missed my calling maybe I should been a game show host or something I don't know but anyway all of you who are streaming this service some of you think I've just lost it but God bless every one of you you're so many I can't even call your names I've had so many Happy Father's Day greetings from from all over the world so many texts and and uh thank you thank you I'm thankful for my four children Stacy and I were blessed with but I have so many more than that that God has blessed us with so many more spiritual children than that we're very rich because of that and adopted sons and I appreciate them and love them and their families and anyway I could get real wax real sentimental but I want to give you some of the word today I want to speak about the measure of a Godly Man and uh I I feel we're blessed because we have Godly men Among Us and we have great examples and I don't know how we're going to do it but and I haven't discussed it with brother gy but somehow maybe just a picture maybe a little sign or something but I would like to put a a little uh commemoration in the fellowship hall when it's finished to brother West brother Arthur West who's going to be with the Lord he was a real dad to me and I appreciate it with the absence of a natural dad brother West sacrifice driving nearly 4 hours one way to be in this church for so many years and we shared more meals together than anybody outside of my blood family we had took more vacations together and I can't hardly wait I hope he's the first one I really do I love my mom I know she's with the Lord but I hope brother West is the first one I see because he certainly meant so much to me to my family to this church would he ever be thrilled to know that all 60 Acres and this building and all paid for wouldn't he be thrilled wouldn't he be thrilled to know we're using the building down there it's going to be used it's going to be so nice anyway 1 Corinthians chapter 16 I'd like to read two verses I'm going to read some of my notes today uh because it's a different sort of service when I was a boy one more thing when I was a boy it was a tradition in the Pentecostal churches maybe other denominational churches too for men to wear a rose on Father's Day to to give honor to their dad like like you would your mom in fact a lot of men wore flowers on Mother's Day now I know that is so sissify now and so out of our culture and so forth but by the world standard but my wife has uh she has revived the tradition she asked me she told me she was going to do it I cried uh Kendra made him and we're so thankful appreciate her so much she's talented um I cried about it but she asked you do you want a white rose thinking of your dad or or a pink for Elana well we you can't live in the past and uh I don't want to have to slug you so don't say anything about it being being pink this is to commemorate Eliana Jane and her dad has one today too so that's why we're doing it and and anyway my mom would like it she would she would like the idea of Reviving The Old tradition but anyway 1 Corinthians 16 verse 13 and 14 I I better hurry watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like men be strong I'm going to read it again Watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your things be done with Charity so whoever ever has the idea that a godly man can't be a loving man missed what the Apostle Paul wrote to the church at Corinth nobody should love their families more than a godly man no one should show them his love more than a godly man so if you've got an idea that Godly men don't cry and real men don't cry and Real Men Don't Hug their children and real men don't kiss their wives and uh I don't know where you got your idea of a real man maybe Hollywood maybe in some old movie but the Bible tells us that real men Godly men Stand Fast in the faith they're watchful because the enemy is Raging and quit you like men he said be strong and let all your things everything you do be done with Charity which is the demonstration of love may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and if I haven't already offended or thrown you off uh I will read this in the Amplified Bible so that I can finish the rest of you but I think it's important for us to hear this Amplified just a little bit that's like turning up the volume not so that we can take away from uh good old 1611 King James but sometimes you know in English quit you like men huh what does that mean stop being men it's what it says quit you like men so if you're if you're not speaking the king's language and we do not do that here in Alabama they may do that up there in Minnesota but we don't speak speak the king's language here we're just hillbillies with a little polish and sometimes we need it to be turned up a little louder so I'm going to do that for you this morning by reading this in the Amplified be alert and on your guard stand firm in your faith your conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things are you with me I'll be right back with you there it is keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it it's not a passion that you're born with we're talking about a passion for Faith for the things of God this is something nurtured in you and and and in fact quit you like men doesn't mean quit being men at all it means act like men behave like men and um this young man what is your name the the the student the one who's just graduated Elisha Elisha has no choice now he has come to a part of his life where he is going to be a man now he he had to he had to get there before he graduated because a boy can't go through some of those things and and survive and graduate like he has but I want you to know that sometimes it's not about your age or what you go through because I know some old people who are really not acting like men of God it's not enough to be a man it's to be a man of God a father eventually a father a man of God eventually a father what a responsibility that is and in the Amplified this says act like men be like men and in the denominational churches today they're going to preach that that means playing ball and starting a fire without matches and uh coaching the Little League team and that's how they're going to Define what a real man or a real father is but I want you to know that we're going to look at another way of measuring what a real man of God a man a Godly Man is H he may not know anything about Star Wars he may not be much for camping he may be more of a glamping sort of guy but if he will measure himself by the word of God which is our absolute and will surrender everything that that that's unlike that word to the word to God he will be a man he'll be a man and he will act like a man and he he may not be bowlegged and and he may not walk like John Wayne but if he will measure himself by the word of God he can be a godly man and he can act like a man the the the Amplified said act like men and be courageous we're waiting to see it again act like men and be courageous grow help me grow in strength and I just happen to grab it I don't even know if I passed it on or not but the 14th verse said everything let everything you do be done in love true love to God and man as inspired by God's love for us are you following me what wonderful instructions the Apostle Paul gave to the early church the the baby Church in Corinth you need to act like men now remember in this time the Greek culture had invaded uh the Hebrew people the Jewish people the Israeli Israelite people a second temple period when Jesus lived and died and rose again remember that the Greek mentality had taken over that part of the world and men were shaving for the first time Jewish men who had been instructed from old not to do that but the Greek mentality said we want to we want to strip that away we want to change your name you know most of the Apostles we call them by their Greek transliteration instead of their Hebrew name because people were beginning to speak Greek Jews were speaking Aramaic and uh this Greek influence this idea of bathing together that kind of watered things down a little bit the gymnasium you know that was a Greek thing and uh wearing wearing wreaths on your head and go going around in a in a bed sheet the Jews didn't know what to think about These Guys these Greeks that were invading the land of the Bible and I want to just tell you that that Greek culture like the Roman culture was a sissified culture it was a culture that really wanted to take any form of masculinity away from a man and that's why homosexuality was so prevalent in both cultures because they really wanted to blend the genders together can you imagine all those many years ago that there was already an attack against gender uh separation and distinction it it it was a it was an affront it was an assault to the people who were trying to live their lives by the Bible and you know they outlawed circumcision and uh they they started taking away the faith of the Hebrew people and trying to make them more acceptable on a world standard and so uh I want you to know Paul wouldn't going to have it he wasn't going to have it he he might have occasionally been called by a Greek name but his name was sha originally and uh he wasn't going to have this Greek influence taking over the church in Corinth I don't even want to tell you some of the things they were doing they they were wearing wigs and doing all kinds of things it's one of the reasons why First Corinthians chap 11 became necessary to tell the men nature itself teaches you that it's a shame for a man to have long hair Elisha believes that scripture this morning he's he doesn't have much hair at all and uh the same scripture that tells a woman that that long hair on your head is a sign of submission to your husband it is given to you for a covering it is a representation of the authority in the ranks of angels and Paul had to you know he had to talk to them about uh eating things sacrifice to idols and Oh my he was constantly having to come against that culture and he was tired of men kind of footing around and calling themselves Christians so this is what he wrote he said take this letter to them to to stand fast in the faith and to act like men don't let the culture dictate to you what a man is or is not you find a Godly standard in the Torah you find a Godly standard in the letters of the Apostles that we call the Epistles and live by that and if he would have been alive today he would have written a letter and he would have told people don't let your Heroes be sports stars and movie stars and losers like that you can have a big paycheck and be a loser when it comes to being a real man all these years later this footage a video footage that resurfaced a few weeks ago of one of these big football players knocking his wife for girlfriend down in the in the hallway of the hotel and stomping on her and there was a time that that all of society was uh you know singing his praise and calling him a man's man well let me tell you something a man's man doesn't beat a woman down on the ground and then kick her after she's down so thank God for Godly men who want to measure their lives according to the Bible instead of the culture the culture listen uh this identification business I I don't identify as oh my goodness and what are my pronoun I don't care what your pronouns are this world is in trouble if there's ever been a time for Godly men to raise up like we have in this house this is the hour to do that now the measure of a godly man it's big it's one sermon could never touch it all we live in a world that dep depends on secure and unchanging measurements in fact governmental agencies are formed to conduct tests on various devices to ensure that companies are being honest with selling Goods when you go to the gas pump there's a sticker here anyway there is a sticker on the pump that will have a seal on it and it will list the name of the state agency that has determined has checked the calibration of that pump stay with me and has determined that that pump is calibrated to Dill out or dish out a gallon of gas when it clicks a gallon on the screen a gallon of gas has gone into your tank how many of you appreciate the fact that somebody checks that every now and again cuz I don't want to pay for a gallon and get a half a gallon and you don't either so there's got to be somewhere a standardization uh of keeping those gas pumps in line what if a company would give three4 of a gallon and say it's a gallon it's happened or mixing it down with water you know you can be cheated the public would be up in arms if they found out that they were paying for a gallon of gas and getting a quarter of a t a quarter of a gallon or half a gallon or 3/4 of a gallon the the FDA I don't want to get too too started into that but the Food and Drug Administration there's a division of that uh agency that uh regulates pharmaceutical companies not nearly intense enough but this particular division of the FDA measures insist on regulating the equipment in the Laboratories to make sure that if something is 1,000 mgram that it really is 1,000 mgram now my idea is they should be checking a little closer to see what kind of poison is going in the pill but that's not what they do are you help me going to help me you with me no no they're not checking always the the the chemicals and the poison of of the additives of the pill but they're making sure that if it's 1,000 Mig in a pill you're going to get 1,000 milligrams of poison they don't want to cheat you not one little milligram right and so there's a there's a a part of the FDA that regulates that what if drug companies decided that that uh they would instead they'd call it a th000 milligrams but they would just slip in 1500 milligrams well that could make a difference according to what the drug is so there's got to be a standardization or else it would have a huge impact on our health and and it would depend on someone's weight and so forth the building industry is also regulated by inspectors who have determined that 12 in are going to be in a foot and uh you don't get to go and make your own measuring stick you you've got to buy one standardized or if if you're going to uh pass inspection they better not see you using a stick that you cut off a tree and hope that's 12 in or a measuring tape that you you know made a string and said well this is you you better you better stay with the standardization uh of the measurements and then there's other measurements like a matter of time I'd like to preach all day on time I'd like to preach on being on time wouldn't that be a great sermon but you know there are industries that depend on time Airlines look as long as you're not with American Airlines you should be all right they don't seem to care much about time when they say the flight is at 2 it may be 2 maybe 3 maybe the next morning at 9: it's right you hear it and see it all the time but somebody needs to kind of standardize this thing we're in a confusing situation here because we live in the central time zone and we go by the Eastern Time Zone and uh we've done that I saw someone explain that it's because of Fort Benning excuse me young man that's what we still call it Fort Benning and that's what it was my whole life and I forget to say it otherwise maybe you'll retrain me one day uh it's the same location for sure but anyway uh you know there there's got to be some standardization some measurement of time you've got to be precise if you're if you're going to uh go on a trip or show up for roll call in the morning and they've got their own military time but they tell me that the time difference the reason why we go by Central and we live and go by Eastern and live in the central is because of Fort Benning it's because so many soldiers lived on the Alabama side and they needed to keep them and so many mill workers who worked in Columbus Georgia on the other side of the river but they lived out in this area so we're confusing I saw where one woman wrote that if she leaves her phone on automatic she and her husband have a king-sized bed and she said on one side of the kingside bed it shows Central Time on the other side of the kingside bed it's eastern time that sounds about like a marriage don't it running on two different times wonder which one's always the last to get ready anyway there's got to be some standardization of measurement in the natural world well folks God says the same thing when it comes to spiritual things he wants to Define for us what a Godly father is he wants to Define for us what a Godly Man is again we're blessed to have Godly men here so this same kind of idea of measurement can be said for the scope of the spiritual world where the traffic of men's Souls moves not just on a daily docket but on an eternal plan something bigger than the here and the now thankfully we can find measurements in the word of God that can help us to see which way to go how to live and pattern our lives I'm thankful for it some four or five years ago I shared with you on Father's Day about a book that I have I don't have an original copy but I have have a reprinted Edition and it has been reprinted multiple times since then it was originally written in 1666 it was written by a A purst or a Puritan Theologian his name was Thomas Watson it's been reprinted by the banner of Truth trust you can look for it it's easy to get a hold of the book is called The Godly Man's portrait The Godly Man's portrait portrait written in 1666 it's a little over 250 pages long 12 chapters that are directly written toward what a Godly Man looks like hold on it was quite a popular book some 400 years ago when men were really concerned about being a Godly example it its popularity has long since departed from our society and it isn't likely to hit the New York Times bestsellers list anytime soon however Reverend Watson lists 24 different points in showing what a Godly Man looks like according to Watson he went through the Bible covered to cover and he made a list of 24 things portraits of a godly man I wished I could preach on all of them but I will read them all I'd like for you to think about it I wish I had had given you the a copy of the list we can put it on the church app because I think it it is so basic in the list that you really have to think about some of these but they're powerful uh powerful concepts of what a Godly Man is number one a man of knowledge and we know what kind of knowledge that is number two a man moved by faith that's what a Godly Man is number three a man ired by love four a man like God I want you to help me so I know you're with me number five a man who is careful about the worship of God that that's not a man that comes to the church and sits on his hands it's not a man that comes and expects his wife to worship and children to worship while he watches them but it's a man thank God for men like that here I don't want to call but I want to thank God for men like here who lead their children they don't send them up front they don't tell their wives you go up front many time they they come long before one of these brothers was a father long before one of these brothers was a married man he was patterning to be a godly man and he was one of the first and sometimes the only who put his whole heart he didn't play an instrument but he came came up here and spread his hands before the Lord like an evening sacrifice I want you to know that a real man of God is one who's careful about worshiping God that's why you're here today bless you I honor you for for choosing this some of you could have chose the lake for Father's day but you chose the house of God not to not to encourage your pastor only but to to bless the Lord a man who serves God and not men now that doesn't mean he that he doesn't have a servant's heart but he means that he's not looking to man for his Accolade he's not looking to man for acceptance or rejection he's holding on to God if God said so that that man is convinced he doesn't have to have a thousand confirmations of what the word has already said you with me a man who prizes Jesus Christ who values him who understands he's more than a than a an an equated character in history somewhere he's a living demonstration of a living God he may not be here in his own physical body but he's here in his corporate body right now living in a godly man living in a Godly woman and we value him we're we're careful where we take him we don't drag him to the pub we don't drag him here and there we honor and prize this Jesus who lives in us and and listen to what listen to what Thomas Watson said oh you just put this in here because you're a crybaby no I didn't write this he did a man who can weep I want to tell you something I don't think that that is optional I believe that as men we need to be humble enough before God that our heads can leak because leaky head will never swell you don't have to be a a mush you don't have to be a crybaby some of us might be that but you you you you need to be humble enough and tender enough thank God for what example we have here that you can shed a tear especially in the presence of the Lord this whole idea you know that what the world says we reject that today we're going to stand with with Reverend Watson from 1666 cuz he gets these and if you read the book he he uh certainly substantiates every one of these things with scripture a man who loves the word that don't mean just twice a week that's a man who understands you can't survive in Satan's Eden without your guide book and thank God for a family that can see a man a dad a husband open up the Bible talk to the children about the Bible devotions aren't just for mothers and children it's a good thing to have in your home and a good dad a Godly Man in there thank you for the example that you're setting for your children we're blessed I hear certain times in this community I hear people say so and so is is a is a present dad a Hands-On dad my that's wonderful brother that's wonderful I hope that can be said about you you cared enough to be present you you didn't read the newspaper I'm going to be oldfashioned now newspaper what's that do you know how our precious Brother David Edwards got down here from South Carolina by a map I I said what's a map this generation doesn't even know what a map is he said brother shelle I don't have a cell phone you know I love him but I almost asked him what cave he was living in he said I borrowed my wife he said I did bring a phone call case I needed something but but I borrowed my wives for those of you who have asked yes he stayed over and uh we had a wonderful time of Fellowship together on Wednesday what a dear precious brother and we so appreciate the fellowship that we had but he got down there so I I'm I'm thinking should I try to give him a little bit easier route to get home nope just go by the map just just follow the map sometimes you better stay with what your you're used to come on ain't that right a man who loves the word I'll go on I was going to say some more a man who has the spirit of God no I'm I'm coming back years ago the dad would you know come home and put on his slippers and read the newspaper and the kids would try to bother him and and he'd send them out of the room and so forth folks that might have worked in the 1950s but I'm going to tell you something we need a whole lot more more than that see that was in the day of television shows like Father Knows Best I I've seen some of those shows when I was younger I'm going to be honest with you I've seen some of them but you know that's not the example that's being held up in our generation today of what men are in the home I've never seen an episode I don't intend to find an episode but they call it an adult cartoon and there's a guy I've read some of the stupid things he said called Bart Simpson and and his idea of life is pretty trashy and that's who so many uh young people around the world that's what they think of when they think of a dad not Father Knows Best hello but dad's just a dumb nobody that don't know anything come on now are you with me now I'm thankful that we have a community full of men who aren't Bart Simpsons and I'm only basing that on what I've already said you we've got some men who said I'm going to do it the right way the god Godly way if I fall I'm gonna get up again and do it all over again a man who has the spirit of God residing in him you can't just have the dead word you can't just recite scripture with no connection and no passion and no Spirit we're reading the list of 24 things that that uh Thomas Watson wrote In the book 1666 this is the portrait of a godly man let's go on a man of humility he's not arrogant he doesn't think the world revolves around him a man of prayer now the only way your family is going to know you pray is if they hear you pray or see you pray a man of sincerity a Heavenly Man W what does that mean from 166 6 to 2024 somebody who's got his eyes on a prize and who says nothing going to keep me from my path and I'm going to set as many people as I can on the same path by being an example a zealous man hello brother sister oh yes this is for you a zealous man it's getting kind of quiet stay with me a zealous man that's a man with some passion about him that's that's a man that don't live his whole life on the sofa a zealous man he's got a passion especially for the things of God oh oh oh oh oh oh let's just skip that one and go on somebody tell me what the next one is oh you didn't lose your place patient man help me Jesus that'll strain you sometime that'll strain you as a Godly Man as a Godly father to be patient but it's important because somebody took a little time for you are you here a thankful man that's right a thankful man this is the kind of man that's to be respected in a home a thankful man one who knows where his help comes from it doesn't come from the government it'll fail you it comes from God I'm so thankful for that let's go on a man who loves the Saints if a man's always tearing down the household of faith always criticizing those who worship with him that's not a very good example a man who does not indulge himself in sin somebody said that's impossible no it's it's it's very likely when someone has surrendered to the word if unbelief Creeps in we grab a hold of it and wrestle It To The Ground a man who is good in his relationships now when I read that I remembered what the scripture said growing in strength so you and I have to grow in in being good in our relationships because the reality is some of us didn't come from a home where there was a good husband wife relationship where Dad didn't have a good relationship with his co-workers or his siblings we come some of us came from homes where our dad was just as content not to be with any of his family he was glad to be rid of all of them come on and so it's harder for us to learn what it me means to be good in our relationships and we have to work on it a little bit harder but thank you for the grace Lord that you give us to be a better husband to be a better son to be a better dad a man who does spiritual things in a spiritual Manner and in a spiritual order a man thoroughly trained in religion now we wouldn't put it that way today that was 1666 but we would say a man who knows what the Bible says and it's not a shame to explain uh the godhead well there ought not to be a man in this house or a father in this house that would be afraid to try to explain to somebody the godhead and if you're fearful of it it's because you haven't yet received the Simplicity of the revelation we have a tendency with religion to make things so complicated nobody can get it that's why we want to give it in the spirit that's why we want to be anointed to share it amen a man thoroughly trained in religion or in in the true biblical Doctrine a man who walks with God right is number 23 a man who walks with God number 24 the last a a a man who strives to be an instrument I must have not given him the other two that's just like me a man who strives to be an instrument for making others Godly how many of you'd like to know you're you are uh you know forging a path of what godliness looks like instead of men pursuing the American dream are chasing after pots of gold are giving themselves a pass that leans toward laziness and checking out from responsibility there are some measurements that we're going to require work these measurements will require work to obtain do does anybody believe it's worth it yes to grow in grace to grow in strength toward being a Godly Man what if there were just a handful of men in a city that said I want to be a godly man and a Godly father thankfully there are a handful or more of men in this church most of the brothers here have committed themselves if not all have committed themselves to being Godly examples and they should be I want you to know the script scripture talks about the woman of virtue being praised I want you to know that men of God Godly examples in our homes should also be praised their role should not be dumbed down they should be honored you know I could get real technical here they shouldn't be called Old Man hello they shouldn't be called old man if that's something you and your dad have agreed on you know your strangeness is welcome at your house if that's something's okay with you all but how many of you know that's not really honoring that's not really honoring my prayer for Father's Day 2024 is that we pursue the things by which God measures men in 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse 11 and 12 he said but thou oh man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness let's say it together righteous godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life that's being Heavenly isn't it where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses the verses that I just read come uh theologically I could say Bible students like to call these the Pastoral Epistles because they were written from Paul to Timothy as a leader was passing down some information some instruction some Godly wisdom about being a leader but I want you to know it's important to understand that every man who comes into the kingdom of God whether he's a a a a father or not every man who comes in to the kingdom of God is a leader he might be a single man in the church but I want you to know he's a leader Austin is a leader he's right now still a single man in our church but he's worthy to be looked at as someone who's trying to set a good example for somebody else and you may come along and say well he hasn't always neither of you neither of I let's give a man his due and be thankful we we would all be more thankful if Austin had a wife and a dozen children and he's single and I ought to take a picture of him and show it around but I want you to know he's yet to be he can still be a leader Among Us right and I'll tell you one of the things that he does set an example in and and that is showing honor and showing respect and and if if we're going to call people out and I will for being slack then I need to take a moment and give somebody a crown amen so so it doesn't matter whether you're you know married and got a dozen children if you come into the kingdom of God you're chosen to be a leader right because somebody's watching you if you're a husband your wife is watching you if you're a father you're leading your children but if you're just a brother in the church folks are watching you on your job you tell people you're a Christian you tell people you go to church how many of you know expect something higher out of us I want you to know I'm grateful they're not going to be disappointed when they work with some of you I'm grateful for that I don't take that I don't take that lightly I'm thankful for it so even though these instructions were written to to leadership it doesn't just mean pastors it doesn't just mean Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelist it means those leading their home those leading on their job those leading in Society sir every father preaching with his life as much as he is with his words I want to tell you something that part's essential Dad you can say the right thing and then do the wrong thing and negate what you've just said let all the saints say Amen there's an old Parable I don't know if it ever happened or not but it's it's recorded as a parable of a of a Haitian man a Haitian pastor told told this story and it made its way into several different books he told that in his country there was a man who wanted to sell his house for $2,000 and another man in the area desperately wanted to buy the house but remember it was $2,000 and this man didn't have the means he wanted the house but he didn't have the means to buy the house and so after a lot of bargaining the owner of the house agreed to sell the house for $1,000 that's half price how many of you know that's a good deal half price I should have expected that every sister in this room would have said amen I know it's not your day but how many of you will push somebody out of the way to get a half price deal you'll go to the dollar store knowing that there's nothing in there hardly any more a dollar you go anyway hoping that it's on clearance my wife recently bought some flowers on clearance this morning she she recently bought them as recently as yesterday she bought them on sale this morning they needed to go in the garbage they were on sale I said well she that's what I said I said well she got to enjoy them yesterday but she didn't get to enjoy them today so sometimes half price is not not a deal or are you with me so this man was convinced to to to uh to let him buy the house he he was slick he had a he had a plan he said yes you can buy the house glad for you to have it for $11,000 however the reduced price came with a stipulation a rather odd one the owner the one who is selling this great deal of a house would be able to retain ownership of a large nail just above the front door so I'm going to sell you the rest of the house for $1,000 but I'm going to own the large nail that's over the front door of the house seems so innocent doesn't it this is this is another culture another country come on I don't know why that's doing that I'm not even moving yet here I am moving uh I can't imagine anybody doing that maybe a sister being you know talked into something but I I think any brother here would be asking most most sisters too would be asking why do you want that nail over my front door but he knew what he was doing when this Haitian pastor concluded the story uh it went something like this some years passed and the original owner decided he wanted to buy the house back oh okay here comes the stipulation understandably the new owner was unwilling to sell it back to him and he wanted to buy it for $1,000 nope the new owner is not willing to sell it back to him so the original owner went out and found the carcass of an old dead dog hung it on the nail right in the front door the nail that he still owned he didn't own anything else but the nail he hung an old dead dog on the it wasn't long before the house became unlivable and the family was forced to sell the home to the owner of the nail the Haitian pastor went on to say if we leave the devil with even one small peg in our life he'll return every time to hang his rotten garbage on it so that's why we've got to make sure that when we sell out to we own everything we own it all we take authority and courage and boldness over everything that we are because if you give the devil an inch I remember the old preacher saying you know I read in the Bible if you give the devil an inch he'll take a mile and I thought I've never read that in the Bible but the Bible does say give not space to the devil if you're going to sell it you better you you you better make sure that that you walk away that old Devil's not he's going to make sure to come back if you leave him a nail I like that story I thought it was good if the enemy has one access to just a single nail in your life he'll take advantage of you he'll exploit it and it's a good question are there any nails hanging over our door that the enemy could come back and hang something on us are we One Look Away from pornography or are we completely delivered hello come on it's it it's it's something to think about don't give the devil or the world any room to take advantage of you and and listen to the instructions of the Bible I want to give you three ways and I got to hurry that man is measured we know the ultimate measuring stick is God's word but number one a man is measured by what he flees from it is 102 for you clock Watchers when Paul was writing these things to Timothy he used a Greek word and it it almost looks like it would be Fuego which you know is a word for for fire in another language but it's actually pronounced fug p h u go in Greek and it's pronounced fug we get an English word from that fugitive and that's the root word and it literally means to seek safety by flight it means you you don't inch away you don't crawl away you run away are you with me you're to flee from something because it's abhorent or distracting to your soul extra biblical literature in the Greek used to use this word when someone was running from a dragon or fleeing from a snake this is the same word that was chosen here to cover what happens when a Godly Man is running away from something that is in the world a man of God is measured by what he flees from in some other places Paul told us that we're to flee from some things let's see if we have a list there I won't read these scriptures for the sake of time Paul tells us flee from fornication flee from idolatry flee from covetousness and the love of money it's not wrong to have money you've got to have money to pay your bills but if making money becomes your goal in instead of setting you're in trouble and and 2 Timothy 2:22 flee from youthful lusts now there seems to be this prevailing idea these days around the message of the hour when we travel around and see what goes on in some of these youth Affairs that uh it's a current common and uh accepted practice that young people are all going to go away from the word of God we're not Amish folks they they're going to go away from the church and they're going to go after out and it's necessary for them to experience the depths of sin and and the depravity of that kind of a life so that when they come back to God they'll have a stronger testimony I I'd like to go around with the man who preaches that kind of a Doctrine it's not necessary the Bible does tell us and explain to us that who who him who is forgiven much loves much that's right that's true but how many of you believe it's very possible for a young man to grow up in faith to have a real genuine experience with God to be born again as a child filled with the Holy Ghost and stay in the word now I'm not an example for all things but that's my that's what my life was he filled me with the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old I want you to know it made a difference in my life it didn't always make me right it didn't mean I always did the right thing but it meant I always knew where to come back to I always knew where to look to and so to me my testimony is not like yours but I'm going to hold it up because I want some young brother here some young sister here I want Michaela to know sitting right here on the front row I want her to know I want you young Brothers to know that you don't have to go out there and experience the things of the world to appreciate serving God God to appreciate God's benefits and blessings in your life we're all Sinners I hate to tell you folks you were born in that shape we were shapen in iniquity we needed God when we breathed our first breath but there's no reason for us to think that a young man can't flee youthful lust he can when he's full of the Holy Ghost and he must Paul was sure about it this is still good advice in our gener ation we live in a sensual idolatrous money loving lustful Society every device the devil can use he'll do to subvert a soul we have to flee and that doesn't mean crawl away it means run away like you're fleeing a bear like you're fleeing a serpent like you're fleeing a hungry lion run remember we're not just fleeing from something but we're fleeing to something we're run into the Rock of Ages the men in this church and fathers in this church and husbands in this church who are successful in their life they're not just running from the devil they're running to the Rock of Ages they're running to the rock that will never fail them you believe that they're running to the rock that was split on their behalf Rock of Ages cleft for me in 1 Timothy 6 six and 10 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it's certain we can carry nothing out and having food and rment let us be therewith content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and lustful hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and predition For the Love of Money not money the Love of Money loving money and of loving God is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have AED from the faith listen this this man's talking about folks he knows who once walked in the faith till they had a little success in business till somebody started calling a mister I'm gonna preach now somebody started calling a mister somebody began to know their name some other business owner began to know who they were and the next thing you know they're leaving the faith leaving the morality of righteousness leaving the word because now they're Mis somebody Hello he said he said for the love of money is the root of all evil which which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and Pierce themselves through oh yes with many Sorrows so all of these things fornication idolatry Covetous the love of money and the youthful lust get away from it run from it encourage your sons if you're teaching your sons to handle things with their fist I'm missing that in the scripture you're not teaching them to be Lily lied or limp wristed or sissies but if you're teaching them that's the way to handle a problem what's going to happen on their job what's going to happen when their wife won't do what they tell them to do I'm going to get some help today you better teach a little bit better than that that's right you better make them understand there are some disputes that cannot be settled with fist they can only be settled by going to him it's hard enough for Godly men to get along the enemy wants to come between them and drive wedges between them isn't that right you'll discover that in fleeing from fornication idolatry greed and Youthful lust there are some virtues that start pouring into your life the men of God in this house the fathers Godly fathers in this house that have spent their life running from those things like brother gy running from those things they have found that in running from those things the things we need the things that are valuable the things that are most important start dropping down on you see that little song are you hear me that little song We sung this morning the Lord bless you and keep you I don't think ever everybody understands the great value of that that's the ironic priesthood blessing that's the blessing that the priest pronounced over the house of Israel yes sir it's an important blessing because it says to us that The God Who has sustained us is able to sustain our children and our grandchildren there's not a day goes by that I don't thank God for four children serving the lord one daughter-in-law serving the lord and a little grandbaby that's going to serve the Lord because her family is going to pour that into her and I want you to know I tell her every single day so far every single day P loves you but I want you to know Jesus loves you much more than p pap could ever love you come on I want you to know we've got we can claim this Heritage we can claim it we can't help where we come from but we can help What We Leave Behind I didn't have a Godly dad an example Le before me but I tell you I can do better for mine they can do better for theirs and I want you to know I see you brother I see you doing that I see you doing that maybe we don't stop enough to tell you but we see you doing that perfect I don't think you are because I know I'm not but I appreciate what you're running after I appreciate what you're growing in Paul uses the indication that it is to be a lifelong Pursuit we should never stop pursuing six things righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness which is gentleness a man of true faith will find himself Desiring and pursuing these Everlasting possessions of the Soul if you want to know what a man of God looks like sometimes it helps to know what he does not look like a man of God and you look around and think about this this represented in our body a man of God should not have the immature characteristics of a child I'm going to drink a little water on that I know you're in a hurry on I know you're in a hurry I know some of you wish I'd have just got back up here and preached on something else God wants us to hear this for now a man of God should not have the immature characteristics of a child 1 Corinthians 13:11 can I just read it in the Amplified I have it in both plan to read it in both but I'm taken too much time when I was a child I talked like a child I thought like a child I reason like a child now that I become a man I'm done with childish ways and have put them aside brethren in in 1 Corinthians 14:20 Amplified Brethren do not be children immature in your thinking continue to be babes in matters of evil but in your minds be mature men now do you know what the Apostle is telling them there know as little as you can about evil and as much as you possibly can about that which is Godly many many people have have have used research as an idea and then they become overwhelmed and overcome by Darkness that's right don't let that be what you're running after one characteristic of a true man of God one who can truly say is being measured by the word is maturity perhaps the best piece of advice if you want to know what a man of God really looks like is this you'll know it when you see it this is not fake it till you make it somebody's going to know wife's going to know children are going to know it can sometimes be hard to describe what a mature man looks like it is not however a hard task to know what an immature man looks like when a man's growth has been stunned as he is a boy in a grown man's body it's very obvious one sign a man needs to be mature is if he's more interested in playing than working yes I think I will obsessed with games and fun like a boy there's absolutely nothing wrong with having fun playing a game are doing all things in moderation but a godly man is not called to live for entertainment or games A Man was created to have a meaningful work Genesis 2:15 and the Lord go the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to tend and guard and keep to be a Watchman Over the Garden these Godly men sitting in this house these Godly fathers sitting in this house they have to take their responsibility as a Watchman serious right yes if there are mothers in this house that tell your children don't tell Dad it's going to get quiet now the dad will get mad don't tell Dad you better keep it from Dad something's wrong something's wrong in a home like that if that's your home something is out of order now maybe sometime that's because Dad has a rotten temper then he needs prayer but it's never an idea it's never a good idea to expect a man to be a Watchman and to be responsible for the souls of his family while they're in his care and then Short change him or sabotage his responsibility by keeping secrets mama mama knows sometime when they put on little Rouge don't tell Dad Mama walks in on them sometime when they're putting on things they ought not to put on doing things they ought not to do don't tell that I'm telling you folks that's not the way to build a home because Mom is going to have a measure of responsibility a Godly dad a Godly husband a Godly father that responsibility is going to rest more on his shoulders before God than mom don't keep him in the dark games can be good for boys if it helps to prepare them from work when playing games distracts a man from his work or takes him away from his wife and children he's acting like a boy he's not manifesting that he's a man another sign of maturity in a man is respect respect has more to do with you than it does with the people you are respecting respect is not flattering words or stroking someone's ego like telling someone you're the goat you're the greatest of all time you're the best there is you're the only one you're the best one there's nobody like you that's stroking ego that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about not flattering words or massaging someone's ego I mean respecting an office or position of authority even when we cannot respect the character of the man it's very very hard for me to respect the character or the ability of our president at a time like this when the whole world is laughing laughing at us and when the and when the whole world knows that he's probably not capable of zipping his own riches in the morning and yet he's the but he's our president and when I pray for him I pray that God will help him to serve out his days hopefully will end soon not his life days his office days if he were to walk in the room if I were to be invited where he was I would show him the same respect that I would show any other president I was tested on that I was not an Obama fan I knew many of the things that God had showed me about President Obama so it had nothing to do with the color of his skin I assure you that a th% a man who's capable of doing the job should do the job regardless of what color of his skin but God showed me the demon that was driving him to popularity I saw it I saw it behind him but I had opportunity to be in the room where the president was some years ago with my wife in Washington and I want you to know I showed him the same respect that I would have showed any president and I showed him the same respect stood clapped cheered just like I did when prime minister Netanyahu walked in the room not because I believed in in Obama's politics or because I liked what I had been shown in the spirit but because I learned early that we respect a man sometimes for his office because of who he is if you get a if you get a glimpse of that church it's not late if you get a glimpse of that then you can you can manage even when your dad wasn't wasn't the best dad he was still your dad oh lousy job he may have done but he was still your dad and you know what you needed him to get here and if it was a lousy example thank God thank God that you have made it really folks there's folks in this room that have made it you are not a reflection of your parents some of you had to fight all the way to where you are today without an example except what God gave you through the word and in that enough isn't that powerful so so some men are are measured by what they flee from and uh some men are measured by what they follow after godliness and righteousness and character in closing some men are measured by what they fight for the Bible tells us here fight the good fight in Greek that literally means agonizing the good Agony agonizing the good Agony fight the good fight Paul is in informing us that every step of the way there's going to be a fight to contend with if you think Christian life being a husband being a dad being a mom is an easy thing it's not at all being a grandparent it's a fight sometime it's a fight to be an example on your job Paul told Timothy in 1 Timothy 1:18 this charge I commit unto thee Timothy according to the the prophecies which went forth before on thee that thou by them might War a good Warfare you take the promises of God over your life they're yay and amen and if you if that's all you can hold on to to fight hold on to that because some men are measured by what they fight for 2 Corinthians 10 verses 3 and 5 for though we walk in the flesh we do not wear War after the flesh come on let's go on for the weapons of our Warfare not carnal Mighty through God to the pulling down of of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's the good fight Ephesians 6 finally my brethren verse 10 be strong in the Lord Lord in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand Brothers Godly men Godly dads don't check out on the on the fight our generation needs fighting men like we've never needed them before stay at your battle station and do the right thing keep being the example Godly example that you have set out to to be a Godly Man is measured by what he fights for we cannot become disconnected and isolated from the house of God we have to take the fight to the devil come on we've got to act like men in spiritual things too there are some things we ought to be will to fight for in our generation fight for your own personal identity as a man fight the battle for personal Holiness fight the battle for your family fight though the pain through the pain fight through the pain of living in a fallen world fight for some close Godly friends fight to have a strong faith there's so much more that could be said when asking what does a man of God look like perhaps the best way to summarize what a Godly Man looks like according to the Bible Bible is is with these words sacrificial love do what you do act like men do what you do with Love by love husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it while this is referring to marriage it still captures the essence of biblical manhood and godly manhood leads to Godly fatherhood a man of God is Not self-centered he lives to love God and others his man main goal is not his a Godly Man doesn't have to be married to live a Godly life some people think that getting a wife solves all your struggles I can assure you it does not a Godly Man doesn't have to be married but he has to he certainly has to work against living a self-centered life if no one's depending on you then that's not what God wants for you ultimately a man of God will seek to live like Jesus for for Mark 10:45 for ev even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many I want you to know there are men and fathers in this church Godly examples who are always willing you don't ever have to anticipate or prepare for a no they're going to help you they may have to work it in but they're going to help you they're going to serve the body because they're Godly men I don't know if they've got any trophies at home for soccer or football I don't know if they've ever won any wrestling trophies or not I don't know what their accolades are according to the things of this world but I want you to know that there are fathers in this house that should be praised and you young people if you have a Godly father you should show him as much honor and respect as you possibly can one of the one of the things that you can do especially living in his home if you're living in his home is to not argue some people just have to be right sometimes it's the higher road to take the Lower Road and just not argue there is no way to measure musicians are coming there's no way to measure the value of a Godly Man in the home a Godly Man in the church Community a Godly father there's no no way to put a value on it if these Young [Music] Fathers and we've got some some amazing examples I didn't get to read all the tributes but I read the tribute that sister hope put on Facebook for brother Josh I believe she meant those words and I believe they were well spoken and well deserved he's just one of many setting an example for their children and for for the body for the for the church I want to tell you a story in closing there's a Godly family they Jesus named Pentecostals they're Apostolic they don't do things just like we do they don't believe things just like we believe but they've made an impression on my life through the years their Church their music their Godly example you've heard me talk about the mangun before from Alexandria Louisiana when our kids went to Youth Camp two years ago now they stopped by the Pentecostal Church there in Alexandria they weren't having a regular service in their Sanctuary huge unbelievable Sanctuary they were having it in the in a in another facility because they were rehearsing for their uh Easter drama that people come from all over the world to see and but they were so kind didn't know didn't know my family but they were so kind to them to meet them and even took them in and sat him down and let him watch the rehearsal treated him so respectful and I know they're they had no way of knowing anything about who they were and I thought to myself if they treat everybody like that no wonder they have had such great success in a city are you okay with me mentioning somebody that doesn't believe it maybe just like you believe it a number of years ago a deadly disaster was averted because of the prayers of a fighting father one who fought against some things and one who fought for some things Pastor Anthony Mangan he is the sort of the um Apostle of the church now Bishop of the church now his son is the pastor his dad was the founder Pastor Mangan and his father-in-law brother lumpin along with brother mangan's son Gentry all went out on the lake for an afternoon of water skiing the boat was loaded with skiing equipment and the gas tanks were filled for what was going to be an afternoon of fun at some point during the trip for whatever reason the gas gas tank burst into flames and the boat caught on fire with a small explosion taking place they were tossed into the water here was brother Anthony his son Gentry and his father-in-law brother lumpin with a burning boat and the deep water of the lake to contend with and brother lumpin would have been elderly already at this time if if my memory serves me correctly and hearing them tell the story once gently Gentry was probably around 10 years old and so brother lumpin was already in his 60s if not 70s not in the greatest of Health can you imagine the fear and the panic and the uncertainty that these men were in on that day although the boat was severely damaged none of them were hurt they're floating around in the water until another boat nearby saw the explosion came over and pulled them out of the lake seems like problem averted but there was more to the story earlier in the week brother Anthony's dad the founding Pastor brother GA Mangan had felt a pressing burden with no explanation to pray for his son brother Anthony Not only was brother GA known for his praying he was known for fasting and so he didn't eat for several days because that burden would not leave him for his son with no apparent reason whatsoever he would go to the church early Before Dawn and spend hours praying for his son Without Really knowing the the reason for such deep prayer there were several times throughout the week that brother G would ask brother Anthony is everything all right son and he'd reply back everything's fine dad going great all is well what neither one of these men knew was there was a God who rich in Mercy who was pushing a father didn't tell him why we want to know all the detail didn't tell him why just told him there's a need and he' fought on his knees prayer rooms prayer altars and lingering in prayer can make so much of a difference on that day because of Elder mangan's prayers there were Angels hovering over a son a grandson and a dear friend it very well could have been the same angels that saved Daniel in the Lion's Den or those who wiped out sarb's army during Isaiah and hezekiah's time but on that day their assignment was in a lake in Alexandria because of the prayers of a fighting father fathers it's time for us to be measured by what we flee from by what we follow after and what we fight for I'm blessed I'm blessed to Pastor fathers and men like that let's stand we often talk about the importance of a Praying Mother but mama's not the only one that can pray we must we must learn to linger and tar in prayer when God puts a burden on our heart and we don't get immediately what it's about we can't give up we can't be discouraged and say well I don't know what it's about so I I guess is all right I guess everything's all right sometimes the lord has laid a prayer assignment on me I pray till I feel it lifting and and it's no time but here it comes back again I've been as a hobby last couple weeks to relax I've been working on my family tree I've laughed some I've cried some I I've been amazed at some of the things that you find in the newspaper about your family when you do a little research and uh I have over 2,000 people now in my family tree on both sides in doing that I was reminded I want to share this with you I know you're standing you can play something softly this is not a tear jerking thing it's a it's a a reminder of the importance of prayer my grandmother was from a family who had she had she had 15 brothers and sisters and one of her sisters died in childbirth and she raised her son as her own in fact for many years he didn't know he was adopted and unfortunately when he found out he was he was crushed he felt like somehow he'd been lied to in that generation it was believed that they should protect him and and cause him to feel as secure as he possibly could feel my grandmother had moved off the farm of course and was married and my dad was a young man and my mother was pregnant with me my parents divorced when I was five and my mother was expecting me in April of 1968 my grandmother her baby brother she was a twin her twin died at Birth his name was Adam her baby brother's name was Orlando Wilkenson and he was a little special I guess today they would say he was somewhere on the scale of autism nobody knew what to call it on the farm so he was just a simpleminded sort of young man wonderful personality and much loved by the family the baby the sweetheart of the family one day my grandmother Woke Up This is a grandmother's prayer but I want to remind you that you got to have got to pray a dad has to pray a father has to pray but this really came to my mind just in one day my grandmother woke up 70 miles from the farm here in Columbus and she had a burden and she was weeping in prayer praying in the spirit it and she said it was a death burden she said I had it several times before and I knew that somebody was going to die and there was nothing I could do to stop it but I had to pray that they would have an opportunity to find the Lord before they left and it lasted for days and she fasted and about third morning she woke up and the Lord spoke to her heart and said it's Orlando that you're burdened for and she drove she got in the car that afternoon and drove to the farm her mother was still alive at the time Miss Lizzy saved filled with a holy ghost she walked in the kitchen and I want I want to correct something she did not know it was Orlando the spirit of the Lord said go home go to Mama's house I'm going to use you today so she did she did not know yet who the death burden was for she said it she prayed until it lifted on on the way down 70 mies she walked into the kitchen of my great-grandmother's home and Orlando was standing in the door that led to the living room and she said that burden struck me harder than it had for the last few days and I began to weep she said I Orlando said Mildred are you okay and she said yes I will be I will be okay she said I leaned over the counter and I sobbed and prayed and cried out to God and stammering lips she said this was her description she said I had stammering lips and I couldn't I couldn't control my my burden I prayed until it started getting a little lighter and she turned to her brother who was still standing there really a faithful Watchman over her because he didn't know what was wrong with her he was standing right there and she said Orlando do you know that you've given your heart to Jesus Christ have you asked him to to I I'm not trying to scare you but have you asked him to save you to wash away your sins and to forgive you she said I know you and you're you're pretty pure in my opinion but if you've never asked Jesus into your heart you better do that he shook his head yes ma'am she said promise me that you will call on the Lord she said I'm going to pray for you now but I want you to call on the Lord for yourself when you have the opportunity she laid her hands on Orlando and he cried like a baby not quite 30 years old never married she said I prayed the rest of the day my mama was I scared my mom and she prayed she said I drove home my heart was broken I had a hole in it I didn't know what was going on I Didn't Know Why the burden was there I got home in the we hours of the night a sister called for prayer and I woke up and I was praying for this sister on the phone and the operator came on the line have you ever heard of such a thing as that that's the way it used to be operator came on the line and said michell there's an emergency call coming in from Henry County Alabama I need you to clear the line so that they can call you it's an emergency and she said yes ma'am and she hung the phone up it rang she picked it up she thought all of her family was safe and her son's my dad was home with my mom and waiting on me to come and all that and the sheriff said Miss Shell there's been a terrible accident and your sons are here they are safe my dad and my uncle but he said I'm so sorry to tell you that your brother Orlando has been killed in a in a freak car accident your 17-year-old son was driving excuse me your 17y old son was driving the car there's going to be no charges pressed it was a terrible accident there was a problem with the brakes the car hit a big rock in the road and swerved toward the ditch and rolled over my dad was behind the vehicle watching the whole thing take place just ahead of him where my uncle was driving great uncle was in the passenger seat as it rolled it rolled again and it caught Orlando's neck and it was broken he was gone just that quick my uncle's life was shattered 17 years old total accident she said I fell in the floor She Said Yes it hurt me so bad I I I needed to get up and get down there but I fell in the floor and I said granny because you were so brokenhearted yes she said yes but more than that I thanked God that he trusted me enough to give me a burden to pray sent me down there and I didn't know who I was why I was going but directed me and I spoke to Orlando and I have peace that he called on the Lord she said young and this is many years later I my mama was expecting me they'd gone hunting gone down home and went hunting she said what would have happened I would have lived the rest of my life not knowing she said as you grow old and you work for God if he puts a burden on your heart to pray don't demand to know everything about about it every detail don't take time to just pray I said you mean granny you can just pray Lord I don't even know why I'm praying or who I'm praying for yes just be a Watchman on the wall and just say oh God you know who it is that's in trouble you know who it is that's got a problem you know who it is that needs intervention Lord I pray for them right now I stand in the Gap this is for somebody I hope you're listening I stand in the Gap in prayer Lord Jesus if it's their life if at all possible spare their life if it's a problem they face if there's any way I can pray it away I will Lord but if it's something they have to go through go with them she taught me the value of praying when you get a burden if you've got a Godly father a husband that loves the Lord a dad Granddad an uncle or a brother in the church that you love and Trust you're you're very blessed it's a valuable treasure to have somebody who could hear from God and pray on your behalf when we go to heaven and we sit around that marriage supper T I believe we'll meet those who had a burden to pray for us when we didn't even know didn't even know we were being prayed for but God laid it on somebody's heart how many of you'd like to be that kind of a a prayer Point men women doesn't matter you'd like to know that God could lay something on your heart I want every father to come this way please and if at all possible I'd like to ask your
