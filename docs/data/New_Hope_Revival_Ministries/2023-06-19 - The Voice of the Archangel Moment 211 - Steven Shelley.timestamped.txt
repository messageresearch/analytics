[0:00] that little bride is going to call for
[0:02] the resurrection of her fellow bride
[0:04] members
[0:06] [Music]
[0:11] the shout is the message
[0:14] to gather the bride together the voice
[0:18] of the Archangel is a voice of Christ it
[0:21] is the voice of the Resurrection it is
[0:25] Christ speaking his word through a
[0:28] mini-membered bride the church was
[0:31] Sanctified washed and set apart for the
[0:36] very purpose that the Holy Spirit could
[0:39] come and Minister through them
[0:42] so brother Branham was a conduit
[0:46] I must also be conduits
[0:49] pipes pipelines for the Holy Ghost to
[0:53] flow through to speak through to
[0:57] minister through in such an hour as this
[1:00] the Bible tells us in first
[1:01] Thessalonians 4 it's the voice of the
[1:04] archangel
[1:05] which is a chief Angel and that Angel's
[1:09] voice is made up of the voices of a many
[1:14] membered bride it's not bride talking
[1:18] it's Christ talking through them amen
[1:23] that's what makes it Chief that's what
[1:26] makes it head that's what causes it to
[1:30] stand out above all other voices it's a
[1:34] Vindicated voice speaking of Vindicated
[1:37] word and it's the same voice that that's
[1:42] going to call the little bride out of
[1:45] the grave
[1:46] [Music]
[1:48] that little bride is going to call for
[1:50] the resurrection of her fellow bride
[1:52] members it will be the voice of the
[1:55] bridegroom echoed
[1:59] Amplified
[2:01] like a microphone through the voice of
[2:05] the Bride collectively speaking the same
[2:09] voice of the Archangel that will awake
[2:12] the sleeping Saints
[2:15] is the same voice that called Lazarus
[2:19] from the grave now whose voice was that
[2:22] it was the voice of Our Lord
[2:24] it was the voice of Jesus Christ
[2:27] and that voice is also the voice of the
[2:31] eternal spirit of the father because
[2:35] Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Lord
[2:38] Jesus Christ of the New Testament
