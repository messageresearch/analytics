TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you you [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and tell you what a great joy it is to be able to come to you and teach and preach and share from the precious word of God it is life to me and I know if you love the Lord Jesus the Word of God his word is life and strength and hope to you as well I'd like to invite you to contact our ministry all of the contact information will be given to you on the screen please let us hear from you share your prayer requests share your testimonies or just let us know where you're watching in the world it's an encouragement to our ministry to know that this program is getting out and I thank God for gospel channel and I thank God for Angel TV and I thank God that he's using the internet that we can stream and podcast and all this stuff that I don't even understand the technology of how it all works but I thank God that we can redeem it and use it for spreading the good truth of God's kingdom I want to get right into the study we're talking about exercising the census of our spirit it's been a long study so far week after week we've been looking at these scriptures I pray that you're not growing weary of the subject but that you're as excited about it as I am because I believe it's an invitation it's really an invitation it's not just information it's an invitation to come and walk in a higher place in the Lord Jesus Christ so let's look right to God's Word together okay in second Corinthians today in chapter 4 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 I have a problem some time knowing where to start because I pick out a verse that goes with what the Lord is speaking and then I read the one above it and the one below and I like them all and so I'm going to start in verse 11 second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 11 says for we which live are all wadded up to death for Jesus sake that the life also listen to this that the life also of Jesus the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh now that is a powerful promise so then death worketh in US but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish verse 16 yet the inward man somebody say the inward man the inward man is renewed day by day this renewing of the inner man is what we're teaching about the exercising of the senses of our spirit renewing the inner man inward man or inner man day by day for our light affliction those things that we suffer which is but for a moment all of the hardships and trials of life worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory I love that promise all the stuff that we go through in our life is temporal it may feel eternal that situation that's set of circumstances that you're going through right now it may feel eternal but its temporal and it is working in you and for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory in simple terms one of these days I don't care how dark that trial is right now how forsaken have forgotten how rejected you feel how depressed or discouraged you are at the moment there will come a time because of the promise of Jesus Christ that you will be able to exclaim it was worth it all every heartache it was worth it all every trial it was worth it all because there is being worked in you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory verse 18 says while we look not at the things which are seen that's the earthly realm but after things which are not seen that's the spiritual realm the heavenly realm for the things which are seen are temporal temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal you know this really teaches me something because the enemy what does he do he wants us always focusing on what we're going through right now what we're experiencing right now he wants us to get our eyes on that he wants to distract us with the temporary so that we miss focusing on that which is weighty that which is eternal that with just changing us from glory to glory so we've got to do something about it we've got to get ahold of ourselves so to speak wake up and we have got to say to the enemy I'm not going to focus on that which is temporal that which is temporary I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ now we were talking about how to nourish how to care for the spirit man we talked about cleansing we have to cleanse and bathe this physical body and also the spirit man the inner man has to be cleansed how is the inner man cleansed well the outward man is cleansed with soap and water the inward man is sanctified or cleansed by the washing of the water of the word by the revelation of god's word the Holy Spirit taking the word and applying it to those places of our spirit man that need attention that's what revelation is it's the Holy Spirit taking the word and applying it and causing it to activate in those areas of our spiritual life where we need attention in that grace isn't that the love of God isn't that the grace of God have you ever been sitting in a service somewhere and the preachers preaching away and all of a sudden it's like his sermon changes and he starts speaking right into your problem right into your situation right into your trial what's what's going on here that's the Holy Spirit that's the grace of God ministering by the spirit the word that you need at that particular moment that's why the gifts of the Spirit are so important because God uses the gifts of the Spirit to deliver to us the Rhema the Living Word of God present the present word what we need in our present set of circumstances well then we have to also nourish this physical body by eating that's how we went off the air last time talking about eating the right things and a lot of research says that we are physically ill because we eat dead food we eat processed food that is very dead nutrition this no nutrition no nutritional value processed highly highly processed in a factory and this is not you know I mean I'm not going to tell you that we don't like some of these things I have four children and and and they're prone to want them and we have to eat them in moderation I mean for instance something like what we call macaroni and cheese you know it is highly processed food noodles are processed and so forth Adam and Eve didn't eat macaroni and cheese in the garden it wasn't living food they were eating that which God gave them from the ground and the body does there's a high level of inflammation in the human body today because of some of these things so as we try to choose carefully what we eat to nourish the natural body we've got to be very careful as Eagles what we eat to nourish the spiritual man we have to be careful where we feed and a lot of people get their their nutritional value for the inner man by what they see on television and everything on television is not beneficial for the inner spirit man so we need to be discerning and we need to be careful and we need to be disciplined because God wants us to be fully alive in our spirit man he wants us to be able to have all of the senses of our spirit man fully exercised fully functional fully operational so that we cannot walk after the flesh or after the will of the soul but after the will of our spirit that has been renewed regenerated by the Holy Spirit of God interesting isn't it and then for the physical body they also tell us the importance of rest rest God instituted rest in the Sabbath this is why he taught why he arrested himself the Bible tells us in the Torah in the first books of the Bible he rested and he instituted a day of rest now Jesus the Messiah is our Sabbath he is our rest so we're not talking merely about keeping a day but we're talking about being wise and resting the body having an adequate proper amount of sleep it's a good thing for the physical body so is resting in the glory in the spirit of the lord worshiping God waiting on the Lord in worship in moments of consecration and dedication pulling yourself away I know it's easier said than done pulling yourself away from the hustle and the bustle of everyday life even if it's ten minutes in a closet with God I believe it's one of the ways that we're going to be launched into living life out of the spirit instead of out of the flesh of the soul by soaking in the presence of God gets some good worship music sing along with it lift your hands before the Lord weep in his presence just be still be still be quiet we need to spend quality time doing nothing before the Lord religion says do do do do do you've got to do you've got to work you've got to become you've got the you know you've got to be busy changing yourself but the truth of the matter is it's not within our power to change ourselves it's only as we yield to the Holy Spirit we give our will to God and we say Lord let your will be done your kingdom come as we spoke about in an earlier broadcast quality time time as we have taught of intimacy in the Hoopa where it's just you and Jesus just you and your lover you and your Messiah a good place to start when you're reading looking for scriptures to read in your own time is read some of the Psalms their worshipful their the pouring out of David's heart before God and when you read them read them from you as a love letter to the Lord from you this is so important it may sound so simple it's too simple it's too simple to work oftentimes we make things so complicated that when we do reflect in simple moments with simple methods we touch God I believe it's very very important this soaking in the presence of the Lord worshiping drawing oneself away for a season of refreshing my David did it remember we just talked about that but but I'm coming to the thought of of the 23rd psalm he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul this is how God wants to operate for us and we have to make the effort some time to do nothing not an effort to do something an effort to do nothing isn't that amazing that it's harder for us as believers to do nothing than it is to do something that's because of the way we've been programmed by religion religion has programmed us we've got to do more do more read more pray more study more work harder invite more people to church oh that's good I'm not against any of that but God's really after your heart he's more after your heart than he is your works and the only way that your works honor God is when they your works become the overflow of your affection toward god that's worship that way everything you do becomes worship because it flows out of a heart a spirit man that has been transformed wow this is what God's after he's after you remember the little story I've told you before about the American Indian many years ago who heard the missionary preach and he wanted to serve God and so he went into the into the brush Arbor where the meeting was going on and he lay his blanket on the altar and Lord here take my blanket i'm bringing you a gift and there was no word and and he said well I i guess i could give you my horse he goes out leads his horse in ties it to the altar and he says oh lord here's my horse i want to give you my horse and here's nothing from the lord and then he tests well i'll go take down my tipi you know these these TP triangle looking things that that the Native American people lived in at one time he takes that down and poles and skins and all and comes and lays that in in in what is like a church the brush Arbor and he says okay Lord here's my tepee but here's nothing from God he in exasperation he just can't go on anymore he just crawls up on top of the prayer altar and he lays down and he says okay Lord I've given you my blanket and you say nothing and I've given you my horse and you say nothing and I've given you my tepee and there's nothing left so I'll just lay here Lord and I'll just give you me because that's all I have left and he hears in his spirit of voice it says that's what I was after all the time and I want to tell you something that may seem you know just ridiculously silly to you but it's God's heart he wants you he's after you and when you make that full surrender to Him you come into that place of union and intimacy with him then what you do honors God that's a way to change your behavior change your life is to take those moments of reflection in the spirit with him because we've been trained to look at the things that we can see with the natural eye and now we're asking the Lord to bring us into a new training that we can also begin to see that which is beyond the veil open our spiritual eyes anoint our eyes with eye salve Oh father help us to see beyond that which is temporal that which is natural you see a natural person one who has been not been redeemed unredeemed we would say that person can only relate to the earthly realm I said a few programs ago that's why people are so caught up in the New Age and witchcraft and all kinds of mysticism and eastern religions and so forth because people are looking for inner peace but they're not able to find it because their connection is only with the earthly realm because their spirit man is dead when you come to Jesus Christ and you're born again hear me you're born again of His Holy Spirit your spirit man comes alive and that's how we have access to the heavenly realm to the spiritual realm the world is looking for a counterfeit what they don't know they're looking for a counterfeit they're looking for the real thing but they're finding some satisfaction some satisfaction in the counterfeit why would you settle for the counterfeit witchcraft and the New Age and a lot of this kind of stuff is just a counterfeit of the real it's like what Janice and jam breeze offered and the magician's of Moses it's just the counterfeit why would you settle for that when you can have real spirit life you can be a dual functioning person you can function both in the earthly realm and in the heavenly realm you can live in the earthly realm you can live in the spiritual realm that's how you were created Adam was created in the beginning to function that way how was he created Genesis 126 and God said let us make man in our image number one after our likeness number two and let him have dominion number three how was Adam created in the image of God in the likeness of God and to have dominion he was created to have dominion he forfeited that right of authority he forfeited that right of being in the image and in the likeness of God because of what happened in the fall their areas are three areas of life that God desires for us to develop as Christians and to function in the image of God the likeness of God and to have dominion this is what the Lord is calling us to as believers in this power let's examine this if Adam was made in the image of God but he lost some of that because God is three distinct personalities functioning as one God Adam was one man with three very important facets parts spirit soul and body he lost some of that in the fall so he lost some of that being in the image being in the lightness and having Dominion being in the image means created natural and spiritual potential you not only have potentiality or great potential in the natural to be something you've got great spiritual potential because you are made in the image of God we educate ourselves in the natural so that we can be fully we can we can kind of come to our full potential in the natural so we study and we learn and we educate and we do all of these things but how much time have we spent finding ways to reach our spiritual potential to be restored back to functioning in the image of God the likeness of God that speaks of developing natural and spiritual capacity and abilities so our potential our capacities our abilities our giftings the things that speak to us I heard a man of God a great man of God teaching from Australia Neville Johnson and he said you know you're sitting sometime in a service and you hear the preacher saying something and something inside of you leaps and he said that's because what that preacher is preaching is part of your destiny it's part of who God made you you are to have some part in that that he's being mentioned so it quickens you it awakens you in some way this is the truth we have abilities potential destiny that is inside of us that God wants to awaken some people have artistic abilities to draw to paint and that is a natural gift but that same gift God can use that in the spirit realm for you to be able to express what you receive in the spirit realm I know people who are prophetic artists who paint prophecy who paint the mind of God that which God is thinking that which God is emphasizing in a particular moment they're able under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to put it on a canvas now I would be right now unless I developed something than that I didn't know I had it would be very difficult for me to do that but God's given me other ways to express natural giftings and abilities and spiritual giftings and abilities find out brother sister find out my friend what some of your potential is potentials are your abilities are your spiritual giftings are natural giftings are see how you can develop them how you can exercise them how you can practice hearing from God and expressing it whether it's the dream having spiritual dreams are seeing visions are prophesying in the name of the Lord our art our music some people can sit down and and play a song have inspired inspired of Evan inspiration that comes from the Holy Spirit and I could sit down and maybe pluck out a little song it wouldn't sound like anything but someone else who God has given them that gifting in the natural not for the benefit of the natural only but for the benefit of the spiritual Kingdom to play and sing and lead us in worship and so forth and then if we see our natural and spiritual potential developed and our natural and spiritual capacities abilities and gifts develop then what happens is we move into that realm of Dominion Adam was made in the image of God the likeness of God and to have dominion and God is looking for a people who will function in the authority of God having Dominion having dominion what is Dominion its spiritual authority which is the result of a process of testings trials and spiritual growth you don't wake up all of a sudden and have dominion dominion is a process God is bringing us through a process I remember brother branham William Branham teaching about the power of the spoken word oh my what a subject the power of the spoken word now that doesn't just mean your words but but speaking the words of God speaking the mind of God expressing the heart of God very very powerful and very creative the spoken word of God is very creative he spoke and the world appeared he spoke and said let there be light him there was like he spoke and the sea was separated from the land so if you come into that place of speaking the Word of God the mind of God the will of God for that present season then the word that comes out of your mouth is creative why is that important because God's going to have a people who function in that authority and dominion so that we speak the Word of God expressing the mind in the will of God and we see circumstances changed we see healings take place we see deliverances take place because we're speaking the will of God and the creative Word of God is accomplishing the mind of God the will of God this is important now why do we not see that functioning info capacity in the body of Christ because he's still testing us we're still going through some trials we're still being honed in and remember that your trials can make you bitter or better and part of the problem is we've allowed the enemy to cause us to become bitter about what we're going through I just pray that the Lord will help us to get the full benefit of our trials and that we allow the Lord to polish us as jewels for his kingdom because he wants to use us he wants to flow through us I want to pray right now father in the name of Jesus I thank you for your word I thank you for hope I am full of hope about what you're doing through your word and in your body and with your people in this hour and we just surrender right now before you we just surrender we just say yes Lord come have your way in our life use us father help us to allow these testings and trials to bring us to maturity so that we also exercise that the spirit man and nourish the spirit man so that we can live out of the spirit man and not out of that natural carnal soulish man father I thank you for healing you are the healer I thank you for deliverance you are the deliverer just go forth and work your mighty works in and through your people in the wonderful name of your shoe of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen well this has been an intense program the anointing of the Lord has been here I pray that God we just show up in your life and you'll recognize him and let him do the things in you and through you that he desires thank you for watching the Eagles cry will finish we'll get through this one way or the other tune in again next time bye bye for now [Music] you
