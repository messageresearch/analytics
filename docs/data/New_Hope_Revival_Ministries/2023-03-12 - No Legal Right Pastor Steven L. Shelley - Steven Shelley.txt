Description:
"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen." 1 Peter 5:8–11

[Music] Eagles and fly [Music] give him some praise [Music] how many Overcomers are here today by the blood of the Lamb amen aren't we blessed let's thank God for the songs the word the the music the musicians the leading of the word the leading of the worship I'll get it in a minute his presence is with us be seated just a moment I'd want you to stand so long we'll take a moment just to say what a wonderful Joy privilege and blessing it is to be corporately gathered with you in the presence of the Lord there's nowhere I'd rather be right now than where I am in his presence with his people if you feel that way say Amen if you don't you just get a little more him and you'll feel that way as well there's nowhere like being in God's presence you can be in his presence anytime you you so desire he's as close as the mention of his name amen he's been so good to us just over 10 days ago when I saw you last many of you had had gathered with us at the cemetery to pay your respects to my mom who has gone to be with the Lord and he has strengthened us he has helped us he has blessed us and most of the time we have rejoiced completely and totally that she is in her right mind and in the wonderful presence of the Lord but there are those moments when you think about not having your mother and when that comes well I just thank God for her life and uh for her protection of me she was the epitome and the full definition of a mama bear if you've ever heard of a mama bear I had a mama bear and it's actually good for some of you that you didn't have perhaps the privilege of knowing her because you might have been on the other end if you got too close to me her then those uh claws would come out sometimes she was very very protective and uh her the hardships of her life sort of formed her to be that way but the reality when we got home and the death certificates were waiting on us and all the business that we've had to take care of from from out of town uh the nursing home and the Medicaid and the Medicare and the Social Security and all the things that you have to take care of just a serve as a constant reminder uh that she is not here but she really is here because we believe what the prophet spoke and we believe that our loved ones are not a Million Miles Away you know we think somebody said well Heaven Must Be A Million Miles Away well you're you're you're you're you're uh uh that's a good guess but the reality is our loved ones are with us even in this meeting this morning someone said wait a minute I don't believe in necromancy well then don't call out to them don't call out to them but they're here he told us they're in a faster Dimension than the one we're living in right now and one of these days we're going to speed up and they're going to slow down along with our theophany and we're going to meet in the middle and be together with the Lord and one day we will step out of that theophany into an eternal glorified body that will be ours forever and ever and ever and ever and ever in a new Heaven and a new Earth and uh someone said how do we know that the whole thing won't process and repeat itself all over again you don't ever have to worry about that there will be no tempter there he's finished he will soon have served his purpose the very reason why he was created will soon come to an end and you and I will live forever in the presence of the Lord oh what a wonderful Joy it is to know that amen so let me say again thank you to everyone who showed such love for us and to us those of you who were able to come and be with us and uh we were able thanks to Hawk we were able to share it with others who were not able to be there it is on the it is on Facebook and we did that just simply because there were some who had to work and some who couldn't travel and some who couldn't be there and we wanted to make we wanted to share that moment with them and and that had a great impact on my family that was there and had an impact on friends that we haven't seen in a long time and and then a few of us ended up at uh Zaxby's and and it was just wonderful to sit at a long table and have some of my family my church family gathered around and many thanks to brother Greeley who made it possible for us to not not have to come all the way back for that weekend but to to stay and to enjoy our time away and that is quickly coming to an end but uh I'm going to savor every last moment we will head back south in the morning and uh we'll be with you not next Sunday but the next and it has been life to me I can't tell you if you there there's no way to describe it I I don't know how to explain it to anybody you have to live it you you it has to be your life in order to be able to put put it into words but I so desperately needed a time and I needed an extended time and God has provided that in a wonderful way and he has blessed us with a an incredible location and I am able to to spend an hour and a half to two hours a day walking down a long stretch a two mile stretch of Beach and I might see four people the entire time six people may be at the most once I hit that that stretch and just in his presence I I started out uh when we first got there listening to tapes I was listening to brother Branham I was listening to uh to uh something else a book on on tape or whatever what do they call it audiobook and and and it and I was so blessed to hear some sermons of brother Branham but but finally I thought one day I'm going to do it without any music I'm going to do it without any preaching I'm going to really unplug anybody know what that's like just to really unplug not listen to anything but but hope to hear his voice and let him speak and you know he has been so faithful he let me stand with him in Heavenly places in courtrooms of authority and he did that for me I'm so grateful I can't tell you how grateful I am I was able by the spirit to catch several great wrongs being made right from his right hand of authority when when when when he speaks when he renders a judgment on behalf of the Saints and Heaven's Shake and the Earth responds and we if we're just walking in the natural realm we don't even realize what's happening we we hear of Storms and we hear of earthquakes we hear of natural things happening in the Earth and we don't even realize sometime that it is a natural reaction that's why when people say to me you know pray against the tornado and pray against this hurricane and pray against this strong wind and pray against us this Wildfire I don't I don't get on that I I that's not the kind of intercession that I was called to be a part of because I I believe our most effective intercession is just saying as it is in heaven Saul let it be on the Earth you know Nahum said that God is a god of the Whirlwind now I don't like to see tragedies and I don't I know people have lost homes and and lives and I don't like to think about those things but I just pray Lord your perfect will be done on Earth even as it is in heaven and someone says well I can't believe that those things are are the will of God then why do they happen because I don't believe that my enemy is more powerful than my God yeah see I believe God has power to both initiate and stop anything that happens in the Earth all he has to do you don't even have to speak he just tilts his head and the Earth has to respond how many of you believe that but sometimes we see those things happening in the in the earth and we we we call it the the devil and maybe sometimes he stirs things up brother Branham said you know he can get out on that Lake Superior and he can stir up the wind and stir up the waves and stir up the waters he can't create a storm he just gets in there and kind of you know stirs things up and sometimes the enemy might do that but other times for those of you who have an ear to hear other times the Earth is responding to something that has taken place in another realm in another dimension when the judge when the when the wigged one when when the Ancient of Days sitting on his throne when he renders a verdict of righteous judgment on behalf of the saints of God and it it goes like boats of lightning out of his mouth through through the third heaven all the way down through the second heaven and Strikes the Earth and Wrongs are made right and we don't always even know when wrongs are being made right but you know God is so beautiful and so Sovereign and so holy and we may not all be called to walk in those things but we can have understanding if we so desire to have understanding and governments shift and leaders change and and decisions are made all the time from him from his throne and and sometimes we don't even realize what has happened unless we would have that opportunity that that John had in Revelation chapter 4 when that voice said come up higher now now brother Branham said that John is a type of the Bride are you with me he's a type of the Bride so if God gave John the opportunity to be caught up into a Heavenly door and see things that had not yet taken place on the Earth if God would do that if brother Brandon was right and I believe he was when he said John is a type of the Bride then then is it so hard for us to imagine that there would be situations and circumstances when the bride would be caught up okay I don't hear a lot of faith in here that we might be able to participate observe Lord I don't have to be in the middle just let me you have you ever said let me be a fly on the wall just let me be a casual Observer in the great courtroom of Eternity when the righteous judge begins to render verdicts and I I just uh I just thank him I I thank him there's nothing that refreshes my life more than than his Supernatural presence and we're just blessed you've been having amazing services and brother Greeley has been so Faithfully declaring such a rich word over our lives we are blessed and uh these children sitting here on the front row Tuesday night listening some sometimes sometimes being kids sometimes listening it just so happened that the camera caught them many times having you know disturbances and some of the second row kind of trying to help them a little bit but but there were moments that they were right listening and hanging on to every word of the Purim story and and uh celebrating along with brother Greeley and it was wonderful and and I and I have to I have to confess that I I was sitting in the living room and I I saw the head butt I saw Elisha and Moses I think it was in there and their and their uh crash I I have to tell you that I'm a nervous laugher so when something like that happens sometimes I hysterically laugh even though I knew it must be painful Moses I hope you'll forgive me Elisha wherever you are I hope you'll forgive me for laughing because I know it was painful it looked painful brother Josh come running up to pick the shoes up that fell off and uh but I just loved I loved being a part of it you you you're gonna have to be my age or older to appreciate what that felt like to be able not to miss it I wouldn't wanted to miss that somebody said you're just crazy I just love them and that was if it was meant to happen I'm glad I got to see it so streaming is wonderful but it's not like being here are you ready for the word let's stand together if you're in a hurry you know we have an open door policy you slip out anytime you need to we love you we appreciate you being here today you're always welcome we're going to be having an extra service on Saturday night April the 1st and we will be having uh lunch together the Lord willing weather permitting on Sunday after the service on April the 2nd I've heard from several different groups of people who are hoping to be here with us and it's going to be a wonderful weekend a fellowship with one another fellowship with the word fellowship with his Spirit isn't that going to be great I'm looking forward to it well the Lord's been talking to my heart about actions and reactions and I wanted to preach I I listened to brother Branham did you know brother random preached the sermon with that's almost a very similar title now I listened to it while I was away and was quite inspired and I was hoping to to preach a little of that to you this morning and help you and help myself actually because it's a powerful thing to understand that every action has a reaction we can't always control the action but we can control the reaction in many cases and uh but the Lord wouldn't allow that for this time that we have together today so there's going to be a little more of a review you're going to see I think as we move out of the summer a few months from now and into the fall I think you'll see that it was all in the mind of God that we go back in and refresh our memory and Minds about some of the things that God has spoken to us I think it will be so helpful as we start seeing him unfold someone sent me a text this week and said brother Shelley what could I pray specifically for you about I don't get I don't get texts like that very often from anyone but this is a precious brother and I haven't seen him in years and and he sent that to me and I I thought about some things that come to my mind and I thought no I don't want to trouble him with that and I I I I you know that's that's uh I think we're covering that in prayer and all of a sudden uh I just saw Lord if I had one desire really a desire from you it would be that you would give me more Revelation from your word personal revelation of your word and then give me the spirit of understanding and let me have an understanding heart I want to be able to understand and and you know God is a great Giver of wisdom and understanding and Revelation and so if I should come to your mind in these last days that we are away pray that over my life I would appreciate it so much First Peter chapter 5 beginning in verse 8. the Apostle said let me say to the streamers all over the world I see you I acknowledge you I am so thankful that that you are with us today and let me say uh that sister Cindy Chadwick has a birthday on Tuesday and sister Emily wassinger has a birthday on Tuesday and David Yantis has a birthday on Wednesday and brother and sister man's anniversary is on Friday and God bless them and and strengthen them encourage them and Friday is also the 60th anniversary of the preaching of the seals and you know that's a that's a mark That's a milestone that's something to Mark 60 years ago God spoke and he began to reveal truths that were hidden underneath those seal and you and I have been partakers beneficiaries anybody here Am I by myself this morning no no there we are beneficiaries of those truths and we're believing that anything that hasn't got to us will get to us in due time we're thankful for what what God gave us for what we have and we're thankful that God found a servant 60 years ago that he could begin to talk through and so much you can take those seals and those Church ages and they they just uh lay over each other so beautifully and you can lay them over church history and It just fits it just dovetails in such an amazing way and and there's so many in the church that don't even know it I know you're standing I I I got up I was sitting on the in my chair reading and on the beach and and I got up to go up to the ward the parking lot and you don't have to know why you can guess and there was an older couple sitting there and the wind had had whipped up and they were kind of bundled it wasn't cold but it was you know how it can be around the water and uh he even the man had a a towel or something around his shoulders in the spirit of the Lord spoke to my heart and said talk to them and I said Lord I don't even know what I would say I surely need to go up I've got to go Lord I need to go I've been holding it I've got to go but that that ocean you know talk to them and I thought what will I say I just opened my mouth he told me that many years ago if you open your mouth I'll feel it I just opened my mouth and I heard myself talking you ever had that happen I heard myself talking and I said well any day at the beach is better than a day behind a desk in a stuffy old office I don't even know why that came out and that man said you can say that again and his wife said amen we just started chatting a little bit and they were Christians they said we've been watching your family we knew you were children of God and we were interested to talk to you we thought how would we ever be able to strike up a conversation with you I said well where are you folks from and they said Southern Indiana I said how Southern well about as South as you get we're right across from Louisville I said oh you must live in Jeffersonville yes we live in Jeff and I said well that's very interesting I've been there many times and I began to talk to them about the Tabernacle there and what God did in their Town they'd never passed by the Tabernacle they've lived there 25 30 years never passed by the little brick building don't even know he said I say I think one time I heard that name but there was some negative things attached to it I said oh yes that's the cult I just tell them I don't hide it like some people do I said oh that's the cult that follows after brother Branham but but there are sincere believers who believed that he was a man sent from God and I began to give them the testimony of brother and sister Ledford taking the little girl from Middletown Ohio healed of leukemia tears began to run down that woman's face and she said he's still a god of Miracles she said I'm a Baptist but she said I know that God is still in the healing business we just had a Time I just talked as fast as I could I thought this may be my only chance I said revival.org revival.org revival.org revival.org I kept saying it over and over to try to get anyway you know you just don't ever know why God puts you in somebody's path those people could have been from any place we were sitting next to people from a a little foreign couple from somewhere they were speaking Portuguese you you don't ever know who you're running to out there and here behind us an elderly couple of all the cities in the world Jeffersonville Indiana I gave them the address I said you ought to at least just ride your car by and be able to tell your grandchildren that you passed a place where Jesus Christ showed up in the 50s and 60s and raised the Dead I said somebody ought to know it and he and you know it thrilled them they said in our town in our town let me tell you something he'll do it wherever we let him [Applause] First Peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil don't tell me he's a roaring lion the Bible said as a roaring lion He's a hypocrite walk in the back he's an imitator he's a counterfeit walking about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that she have suffered a while make you perfect huh make you perfect make you complete establish strengthen settle you I'd like to hear somebody say I want that I want to walk in his wholeness I want to walk in his Shalom I want to walk in his strength I want to be settled in this thing I don't want to be a tree tossed about in the wind but I want to be one that sends my roots down into the revealed word of the hour no matter what the enemy says or does I want to be established I want to be strengthened I want to be settled to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I'd like to read the same verses I'm going to need your help I'd like to read the same verses from the Amplified if you don't mind it makes it a little louder I like loud you can tell be well well balanced oh brother Branham said to brother Perry green whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures you know that cult that I was mentioning out there a moment ago this is what where they have fallen off the wagon it's because many have have not kept their balance in the scripture they find a slogan a phrase a quotation from the message that they don't understand they they don't perceive some time that it was a cultural statement they they don't understand do you know why they don't understand that they don't understand it because they have many have failed to understand the context of the scripture if you can't understand the context of the scripture you'll never understand the context of the quotes you you can't make a a book written by Jewish men in a Jewish culture you can't understand it with a Greek mentality you've got to understand what was happening in the time of the Bible you don't have to be a scholar you don't have to be an expert just a little careful reading a little careful study will help you to understand for instance when we read the New Testament we could do a little study on what what the environment was like in the second temple period what was the political situation what was the believer situation what were they going through at the time what was being said in the newspaper in the internet of the day you know what was being talked about if we can understand sometimes we we read the words of Jesus many people fail to understand that he's quoting the prophets many times Jesus is speaking and he's quoting the prophets of the Old Testament and so to fully understand the Fulfillment of what the prophets of the Old Testament said and its New Testament reality you've got to do a little study you've got to find out the mindset I know that's what a lot of people believe that's why we have pastors and preachers so we do all the study but the Bible said that we as bereans and I think we should all have that kind of a desire in our heart a hunger for the word and we should all spend a little time in the book for ourselves studying it out and asking the Holy Spirit to make it real to us and so the the people that have failed for instance the Feast of Jehovah they quickly raise up and call them Jewish feasts they take no time to understand that these feasts were God's idea so they were God's Feasts he gave them to his chosen people of the day of the time he gave them to the nation that he chose to give them to but he also spoke to strangers who would join themselves to the god of Israel that they should also remember those things [Music] anybody with me so to understand even even the world calls it Easter you can't even understand it if you don't see what the scripture talks about in the older Testament it's not Easter it's Passover so you understand and when you start spending a little time looking at it you find out that one day the Spotless lamb came and he did what all the other Lambs couldn't do oh so many other Lambs gave their lives and shed their blood and the temple itself couldn't contain the blood that was spilled through the years of making these offerings to God but here come the Lamb of Glory not the third person of a trinity by the way but the lamb or the second person of a trinity no no the lamb the word made flesh and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth right that's who he is coming down the road yesterday listening to a song and I'm hearing in the song It's a Wonderful little thought about resurrection and I'm listening to the recitation and the father said and the son said and the Holy Spirit said and if you didn't know anything any better you'd think there were three people having this discussion you see many people fail to see what brother Branham called the greatest one of the most powerful great Revelations that any person can have if you fail to get this you'll never be able to properly apply the scripture amen somebody said what is it Jehovah [Music] your behave of hay Jehovah of the Old Testament [Music] is is Jesus Christ Yeshua hamashiach of the New Testament the word became flesh if you fail to see that you'll baptize the wrong way you'll give Jesus two fathers he could only have one we call the father his father but the Bible tells us that it wasn't the father who overshadowed Mary it was the Holy Spirit who overshadowed Mary caused her to conceive how can that be said because it's the same eternal spirit the eternal spirit of the Father the same spirit that come in a different office a different Administration the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary and that which was born in her and formed in her was of the Holy One it was by the spirit of God so Jesus didn't have two fathers he had one father he was conceived by the Holy Spirit you say we all we know that but you don't know how blessed we are to know it did you know tens of thousands of people flock to whatever's moving and whatever's happening and whatever sizzling at the time and many people are touched and blessed and healed and strength and strengthened and encouraged and all the different things that happen when we get where God is moving and so many walk away still not understanding who God is and how are we going to properly be able to discern the day and the hour that we're living in if we cannot properly discern the God we serve somebody said these things don't matter if they don't matter then why did the men give their lives so that you can I I could have a book that tells us these truths sure it matters church doctrine may not matter but biblical truth matters can anybody say man we're living in a day of charismatic chaos where people can believe whatever feels good to believe but how many of you know God has sent a plum line he dropped it right out of Eternity and it falls right in the middle of God's word and it's his way or no way it's his word or none at all we can't choose the way we approach God we must approach him the Bible way we can't choose how to praise God We Must Praise Him the Bible Way there's a way that's been prescribed for us in this day aren't you glad you're a part of the prescription aren't you glad it was delivered to your address okay now let's hurry we haven't even read the text be well balanced temperate sober of mind be vigilant it's not not wrong to have a sense of humor no God has a sense of humor somebody said how do you know look around [Music] they all looked at brother Daniel well I've always heard that there are some some perfect heads and the others he covered with hair we don't all look the same we don't all act the same we don't all worship the same God's a god of variety he has a sense of humor it's all right for you to have a sense of humor I want to tell people something I'm just lighting up just a little bit just a little bit because religion stinks religion breeds death it's only a relationship with Jesus Christ that's going to have life and victory and hope and love and deliverance in it amen so it's all right it's all right to have a sense of humor but there's a time that we need to be sober of Mind and Spirit [Music] there's a time to laugh and there's a time to be serious you believe that there's a balance we need a balance be well balanced be temperate be sober of mine be vigilant and cautious at all time he didn't say paranoid he didn't say be Anointed with the spirit of Suspicion he said be cautious it means to to to move circumspectly to to consider the way things it means that we should be careful how we react for that enemy of yours the Devil roams around like a lion roaring in Fierce hunger I like to tell people that enemy of yours like a roaring lion he doesn't want to chew your leg he would like to destroy your life he would like to consume you the enemy would like to eat you up until there was nothing left of you but how many of you know greater is he that is in you that he that is in that enemy you need to tell him that your creator is the same one that made him the same one made you you dirty scum made me and you're serving your purpose and I am serving mine and I'm going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony lion roaring in Fierce hunger seeking someone to seize upon and devour can I just remind you that the enemy knows exactly who to approach [Music] he knows exactly when to talk to you he's never going to talk to you when you're shouting the victory [Music] he's never going to talk to you when you're up on the mountain somewhere giving God praise full of the Holy Ghost talking in tongues jumping up and down with a praise in your heart he's gonna wait until you have withdrawn until you have pulled in your own mind until you're walking through that that Valley of mind will and emotion he's going to magnify things that don't need to be magnified he's going to minimalize things anybody awake I don't know how you could sleep this morning he's going to try to minimalize things that don't need to be minimalized he's going to wait until he can find you in a vulnerable moment and he's going to desire and he will if you let him seize upon you not just ignore you but to devour you the Bible said withstand him remember that message that I've preached all over the world about how to face off with a hungry lion you just raise up bigger than he is I'm just telling you what they said not sudden movements but deliberate movements and the best way you can get your hands above your head [Music] face off your enemy with your hands in the air because you're never bigger than you are when you are praising and giving God glory you look more ferocious when you're praising God when you're warring in praise you look like more than a snack you look like you might turn on your attacker you might pursue your pursuer you might chase after your Chase you might devour your Devourer when you get connected to your creator you raise up don't shrink down don't don't uh you know uh shrink away in fear but withstand him be firm in faith like brother Huck was talking about against his onset rooted established strong immovable and what determined there are determined people here this morning you may not be one of them but there are determined people in this house who are going to press this thing all the way you know why they got to meet up mind if you don't have a maid of mind let me tell you something I can tell by the way you respond to the word brother Greeley can tell by the way you respond to the word I don't mean how loud you are I mean how you pull in faith you use your faith to pull on that word we can tell by the way you respond to the word whether you're determined or not your amen reveals a whole lot about you your naps reveal a whole lot about you too yes I'm not going to apologize for that I'm not in town long enough to apologize knowing that the same identical sufferings are appointed to your Brotherhood the whole body of Christians throughout the world you know what I can just summarize that by saying you ain't the only one in a battle I just want you to know you hey I know it's not good English but you can understand it can't you a problem oh the saints of God are facing the same devil and the same enemy but we're not going to use that as an excuse to lay down and let him Stomp all over us never come on we're not going to spend our time rubbing our wounds moaning and groaning right told my wife at least once while we were away I said honey somebody's grumbling our normals very supportive church family somebody's grumbling and I hope they'll be very very careful in their grumbling because there are seasons where it's all right to be human in their Seasons where it's deadly spiritually deadly to be a normal everyday Joe Blow human somebody said what in the word are you talking about your supernatural creatures you can't let your life cause you to look on the outside you've got to look for something higher than that oh my in other words you're not going to just just what I said a few moments ago I hope you didn't miss it what I said a few moments ago you're not going to jump on the bandwagon and pray against the storm unless you know that the Lord is inspiring you to pray against the storm what are you going to do if you find out God is in the storm the scripture said he's a god of the Whirlwind so you might find yourself praying against God brother Brandon said whatever you do you don't want to find yourself praying to take something off that God put on why would he do such a thing as that because your book has been written your story is already recorded in the books of heaven and you and I are here fighting sometimes struggling sometimes yielding some time to walk out our page how many of you have been mindful I hope you've been mindful lately since it was the theme when we were leaving the theme was that we would discover what God would have us to do today that's why no matter how bad I needed to get up to the parking lot I I remained there to talk to that couple because the Lord had given me the instructions to do so and may never see them again may never pass their way you know how it works you know how God deals with you you may never ready you may never know the fruit of it but in eternity you might see somebody walking down the road and you say oh I remember you [Applause] [Music] we strengthen one another on the way we encouraged one another on the way they told me we spend our day studying the word we're retired we go from here to here they name some of the places they like to go and spend time and we spend our day studying the word and I said well I'm so glad I met you because I can give you something to chew on I've got some things I'd like to point you toward that that might take you I mean I I said you know I I don't in any way profess or confess to know it all but I know part of the journey and and the little lady spoke up she said well I can tell you that that's how the Holy Spirit leads she said because we started out in the Baptist Church and and God moved us around to two or three different ones now we're in a Christian church but she said really I told my husband the other day we're really Pentecostal in our hearts and he said wife whatever would make you say something she said because we love Jesus [Applause] you're not the only one God's leading I'm not the only one God's leading don't be offended when somebody tells you there's more let's see if there is [Applause] maybe I am looking back there and seeing sister Trish and maybe that's making me think of brother green I don't know but but brother green used to tell them when they would leave his church and uh you know I I was on the other end of that because he one time quite a few people left his church to move here so I know what it feels like to be on the other end of that ah but he would get up and say you know go if God is telling you to go and if you find something that we don't have here come back and tell us that's the attitude we ought to have if you can go find something better than what we got go find it but once you get there don't just get fat you come back and tell us hey there's more where'd that come from ever growing we're ever growing as God just continues to reveal himself I got to get through this reading it's one o'clock 12 53. hallelujah praise the Lord withstanding be firm in faith against his onset rooted established strong immovable and determined knowing that the same identical sovereigns are pointed to your Brotherhood the whole body of Christians throughout the world next verse and after you have suffered a little while the God of all Grace who imparts all blessing in favor who has called you to his own eternal glory in Christ Jesus Will himself complete and make you oh I don't mean to be lazy because I don't think laziness is going to get it done but isn't it a wonderful Revelation reality to know that it's not me making myself like him [Music] I don't have to wear a saffron robe I don't have to hide in a cave I don't have to do things that people do sometime to be like Jesus I don't have to work at it to be a holy man come on all I have to do is yield my will pull my mind down pull my thoughts down pull my emotions down are you with me and allow him because he's the one who will complete us and make us what we ought to be establish us ground us securely and strengthen and do what settle us have you ever met anybody they didn't it wasn't that they needed a total Deliverance they they just needed to be settled the spirit of God will settle you in that word is anybody with me now that word adversary let's hurry that word adversary that's used in the in in First Peter 5 is made up of two Greek words auntie and dicos anti-anti or anti means instead of or in the place of in some context it can also mean to be against and die course means rights as self-evident now notice that's kind of an important understanding of the word adversary because there is a a word a portion of that word comes from a Greek word that speaks of legalities so when we see these two Greek words come together it means to stand against rights or to stand against what rightfully belongs to someone let me read it again to stand against what rightfully belongs to someone the enemy your adversary is standing against you and heriting what rightfully belongs to you he want he doesn't need it for himself he just wants to dispossess you remember he's the klept he's the thief the one who steals not because he needs he steals for the thrill of stealing your adversary will steal your joy having no need of your joy but knowing that you have a legal right to it he places himself between you and your joy so you've got to move him out of the way you have to dispossess him before he dispossesses you you've got to dismantle him before he dismantles you you 've got to steal his rights his right of accusation before he destroys you with his accusation anybody understand you are dismantling the enemy the accuser the adversary you are dismantling his case against you you are not allowing the Devil to stand between you and your inheritance anybody with me it's only hour one come back to me let's have church here for a moment the enemy wants to stand between you and the bridal inheritance that's already yours it's already secured your name is on it it's written in your book but he wants to get between you and your joy he wants to get between you and your inheritance he wants to get between you and the authority that God's given you to use the spoken word come on he wants to get between you and your ability to speak healing to your own body to speak to the cells of your own body and call them into alignment is part of what I've been practicing as I go up and down the way I've been calling to the cells of my body and the authority of the Creator and commanding that they begin to come back into alignment with what is mine it's mine healing is mine Divine health is mine every rebellious cell has to respond to the authority of the bridegroom come back in the line yes yes every muscle every nerve every bone but you have to learn to take the time you have to make the time to take the authority that's yours are you with me because that accused now uh maybe I'm not quite ready to say that yet we will in a minute so this adversary it comes from that word anti-dicos anti-dikos you put the two words together and it means one who brings a charge in a lawsuit an accuser a plaintiff an opponent an opponent at law so this if the devil if the scripture indicates that the enemy the devil Satan is our accuser what it means is he is bringing an accusation against us in the same manner that someone might sue you anybody ever told you I'm going to sue you well it's not good words to hear it don't encourage you when somebody says I'm going to sue you but here's what you need to know about suing they can somebody said you can't oh yeah yeah did you know the thief can break in your house trip over your furniture and sue you for his injury he better hope that's the only injury he gets we we we're alabamians here you do whatever you want to do in my yard but you come in my house that's a different story you can stand on the outside and huff and puff and blow the house down do whatever you need to do but you come inside that's going to be a little bit of a different story it's a horrible thought to think somebody can come in your house fall over and break their ankle and sue you for their for their damages when you didn't invite them in but you can't you can sue about anything but that doesn't mean you're going to win I can sue you for wearing the same tie if I can find a Jack Leggett lawyer somewhere to bring a suit and can think of some I'm not making it up you ought to read lists there's lists out there of all the crazy lawsuits you can come up with you're infringing on my trademark go home and throw them red ties out of your closet because I'm wearing one today it's my trademark and I'm going to sue you if you wear one you've just got to find the right crazy lawyer and he'll say yes that's a part of you that yes Siri you wear that threes oh Nathan you're in big trouble I just looked back there and saw how red his is it's really red oh it's hot pink you can have it I'm not gonna wear it but it don't look it don't look hot pink to me you can sue for any reason just make up something you can find somebody to manipulate the law but that doesn't mean they're going to win so you have an accuser and he will accuse you of all kinds of shenanigans it doesn't have to be true it doesn't have to be true for the devil to say it it doesn't have to be true for the enemy to come against you in a certain area of your life you don't have to be guilty of it for the enemy to say you are anybody with me anybody with me you've just got to make sure that when the accuser is standing between you and your joy standing between you and your healing standing between you and your Victory you've got to make sure that he has no legal right all right because I want you to know it's not a decision you and I make alone it's a decision that's made in the authorities above you're going to want to know like the prophet told us you're going to want to make sure there are no dead cats on the line you're going to want to make sure there's no unconfessed sin because the enemy will come he'll try to take your family he'll try to take your children right out of the faith anybody with me he'll try to take you home did you know we're living in a society today where people can can can file rights and quick claim deeds on your own property never walking in the door never been to your house did you know you can let somebody stay with you and if they stay long enough they've got rights you can't just ask them to leave when you can but you may find out you're on the wrong end of the law I actually know a couple that went through something like that they hired a housekeeper and at the end of her contract they didn't want to keep her own anymore and their her contract had come to an end they had a legal written contract but she had been living there long enough that in that particular state she had the right to make a claim I know a church a few states away from here where pastors going through the very thing a woman living in the parsonage he didn't need the parsonage he let a woman live in the Parsons she's been living there for years he's tried to get her out and not too many months ago they go to church on Sunday and the church sign has been taken down brand new church sign taken down and hauled off and the locks have been changed and they don't even have a door a key to get in their own church because she living out here in the parsonage has gone to the law and someone has took her side is wicked but that's the hour we're living in where it doesn't have to be true to stand up in court and it's they're having to go through all kinds yes one day eventually they'll win and they'll get her out eventually but the poor old Pastor is about crazy from having to deal with the mess and people are tired of fighting the situation and they get worn out let me tell you something the enemy always has a case against you it doesn't have to be true he'll tell you he'll convince you he'll call you a loser and a failure and a thief and a liar and you know we almost get to a place where we tiptoe around the enemy I don't want to attempt tour around him there's a brother in our church who's just started a business and I bless him and I believe God's going to prosper him but I've been watching how people refer to that and how they talk about it in the different things that come in come come out of people's mouths when they're expressing it and you know what I hear so very often brother Greeley I hear people saying if God blesses it come on not if God blesses it I've heard it through nobody meant any harm but I've heard three different conversations where people say now if God blesses it if God if God blesses uh no no no no that's not the way you operate you're intimidated the enemy has intimidated our language and we're tiptoeing around the enemy so don't you speak about that brother or his business that way at all let me show you how to speak about it God is going to bless that brother God is going to bless that business see it like brother really said it God made the promise he just happens to be one who said now is my time to take that prophecy as part of my life and God is going to bless me don't be afraid to say it if you beat God's conditions he has obligated himself you don't have to obligate God God has obligated himself he's made a legal contract with us pay your time be faithful to God be faithful to God's house and then you can cut all that tiptoe talk if God blesses don't even say when God blesses say God is blessing God is multiplying God is breathing on it God's gonna give him so much business that he has to hire this one and that one and the other one [Applause] God's Gonna bless him so they don't have to borrow real to beg somebody else's equipment we can bring ourselves into alignment in the night the Lord woke me up last night in the night and he began to talk to me about something I want to share this with you real quick it's not the message but it kind of fits in right here I want you to be very careful what you say over your children I want you to be very careful what you say over your grandchildren very very careful because the spirit of the Lord woke me up and was talking to me in my spirit about something like this be very very careful don't say he's clumsy don't say he's socially challenged don't say she's socially and and here's where we really really seeing we say like me what kind of mom and daddy are we we want our children to be awkward because we've been awkward I'm just going to come down here and Pastor a while we want our children to be awkward because we're awkward you see first of all I don't believe in introverts and extroverts I don't believe in them I don't even believe in them so when I hear people describing themselves as such I don't even believe them I believe it's absolutely something that somebody made up and it has become an excuse for our own awkwardness or lack of and I think that what we what we do we we Embark with our words we don't understand the power and the authority of our words and for me to say over my son he's going to be an introvert like me she's going to be an introvert like me that one's going to be an extrovert like me why in the don't you have anything else to talk about [Music] it's like we project our fears on our children we're not going to do such a thing like that as we come into the fullness of recognizing Who We Are and if we realize the effect of our words in the negative we would also begin to discern the power and authority of our words in the positive and we would start speaking those things do you really want your children to be socially awkward because you've chosen to be you know God didn't make you socially awkward no no you've chosen to be that way somebody has reinforced the def your definition of who you are someone has reinforced that and you have chosen to do that let me tell you something God can call you out of your shell and some of you God needs to put you back where he got you yeah I'm kidding don't accept anything that you don't like anything that you don't think is from him don't you accept it because mama had it and Grandma had it when I was young I really really suffered with ulcers in my mouth and they eventually manifested in my stomach and I was just a young boy in ninth grade of high school when they got so bad that I woke up every morning with a sour stomach I vomited every morning of my life and my mouth was so full of ulcers that I lived at the dentist's office with taking all kinds of different treatments and they cauterized them with a with a with a cauterizing Rod because they would get so bad and so big inside my mouth that to open my mouth was painful to eat was painful to talk was painful and lately those things have been manifesting in Joshua's mouth and some of you know a couple weeks ago he had to go to the doctor because his got so bad in his mouth that he could hardly stand the pain and lately Olivia has been complaining about having those things well I've been talking to God about that on the beach I'm just giving you an example I've been talking to God about it and I didn't like him and God delivered me he delivered me every now and then I might have a little sore inside my mouth or on my tongue but very rare and nothing like what I used to have you could you I have scars now I have scars in my mouth hard places in my mouth where I've had really bad ones that healed up and they got hard but I've been going down that beach talking to the Lord and I've been saying just because I had him doesn't mean Joshua has to suffer just because I had him doesn't mean Olivia has to have them my wife's mother had migraine headaches that doesn't mean my wife has to fight my green head do you understand where I'm coming from now [Music] well I was a clumsy child so that's why my child Falls all over his own feet you don't have to believe such a thing as that I hope I don't sound like a quack what I'm trying to tell you is what the Lord woke me up he just woke me up be careful what you say over your children you're mean as a snake you really want to say such a thing like that help me I'm getting some help here you don't want to say anything like that let me tell you something any true person who struggles with being awkward and we all have struggled with being awkward at one time or another in life but anybody who really has battled that in their life would never ever want their children now if you need quotes I can get them I preached how many do you reckon I preached a whole year on the mind two years I probably preached two years on the mind and I've got quotes that'll run out your ears and nose I've got Caroline Leaf quotes and I've got brother Brandon quotes and I I can show you the neurologist and all and and and we can talk about all that neuroplasticity and and what brother greedy was getting into the other night so and and in fact it all ties right back to the word because you're fearfully and wonderfully made in the mind of a great creator and so I don't want to talk about this very long but I I it came to me because I walked straight up out of a dead sleeve and I thought how am I going to make that how am I going to work that in what what the Lord was already kind of laying on my heart but he just gave me the moment he just opened it up nobody who struggles with something like that wants her children to struggle so quit saying things like that now there is a kind of a spirit that can get on somebody where they get to feeling like their safety and numbers and they'll start putting on putting that on those around them for instance a mother who's afraid of the water can sometimes put that on their children because it gives them a little bit of a sense of of of being normal we feel a little more normal oh CCC she see he no no no no no no no no no no let me tell you who you are you're the wife of Jesus Christ you're the Lamb's bride I I don't care if the whole world around you is is you don't have to be have a nervous breakdown you don't have to have one come on now well I just get so awkward I just can't even say my name practice get in the mirror get in the bear and say my name is Stephen Shelley my name is Stephen Shelley my name is Steve until you believe it isn't that what brother Brandon said about heel being healed he said just say it or no I'm Healed I am healed I am healed I'm Healed I am healed I'm Healed I am healed I'm here I'm here until you believe it and once you believe it it's there it's done don't you let the enemy accuse you and use something that you're not even guilty of to block you to get between you and your joy you and your blessing you and your [Music] don't say if if God heals her if God heals me if God blesses a business if God helps me overcome if I can get above myself if I can get myself straightened out if I can now I told my wife this two days ago be three days ago now I had already taken my three mile walk on the beach I'm getting somewhere between six and eight miles a day but three miles barefooted on the beach now you're talking about somebody who has spent the last three years hurting from the bed to the bathroom now it's the truth my wife leaves with me pain in my legs my sciatic nerve numbness my leg my whole leg going numb don't mean to be plain but even going to the bathroom and being so numb all the way down afraid that I'm gonna be a mess wet myself because that sciatic nerve pressed and it was so numb I couldn't even you know feel and for God to give me the strength and help me and bless me to be able to do what I've been doing the last few weeks is for me miraculous and I'm giving him the praise this particular day I walked the three miles in the sand barefooted which is harder anyway I've had both feet operated on my achilles tendon was almost completely severed and it's it's was sewed back together and walking on the sand any of you that have ever been with me where they were saying you know I have had terrible problems walking in the sand because it's so unstable but I knew that this was my time I knew it and God has helped me so so I I come back sat there for a few hours read and rested and relaxed and I thought you know what I'm gonna get up and do one more mile real quick I know exactly where the half mile Mark is I'm going to go down that beach half mile and come back and the next day I felt good when I got back the next day I started my walk and I was hurting all over and I thought well maybe that that little bit of extra maybe I shouldn't have maybe I should have done a half mile instead of home all the reasoning trying to figure it out but the pain was back and it was back with a with a Vengeance and I thought I'm going to have to sit down here and and uh what am I going to do because there's no way to even get to me I couldn't get nobody to come help me because there's no access it's a it's a a stretch of Dunes where there's no beach access and I thought how what in the world am I going to do I sat down on the sand and I rolled my hip around on the sand until it popped and once it popped I was able to get up and and walk on back and it began to make me mad you've got to get this way in line I know I'm using myself as an example here but it's just to show you how the enemy will work on me just like it work on you and every step oh ow ow there was one period of time literally I thought I hope nobody I'm glad nobody's seeing me I hope nobody's seeing me with the binoculars because I was literally this but I said I'm not gonna stop no no no no no no no no no no no the Lord is healing me the Lord is strengthening me the Lord is helping me the devil said you'll be in the bed tomorrow you won't be able to walk you'll have to have your cane you want me to get around he talks to me too and you know what I just talked right back to him you're a liar and the father of all lies Hallelujah and I pressed my way just like you have to press your way through whatever the enemy is throwing at you it's it's our everyday Affair but here's what I gotta close I gotta close here in a minute but here's what I want to say to you oh my I don't like skipping you want to make sure let me just stop I'm going to summarize hearing for a moment and close you've got to make sure that the enemy doesn't have a legal right to hold something that's yours because let me show you this let me give you this verse real quick if you have to slip out thank you so much for being here we're so happy you're here let me let me give you Revelation 19 11 real quick I want you to see this and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war I want you to notice when he comes in the second coming this is the second coming and when he comes in the second coming this will be his Priority First he will judge then he will make war and when I hear that it speaks to me and it tells me that it is a part of his inerrant nature to judge he is a judge if I had time I would go to Daniel I did this with the church in 2020 . did you all realize that we are in the weak right now right now this is the week that begin to change everything we'd known about the normalcy of our life three years ago this week things begin to change our our normal way of going to a restaurant our normal way we were away at sister Carol kinser's funeral and we were being told that we might not be able to cross the border to come out of Virginia we were being told that week the news was beginning to report that people were being stopped at the border of Florida and if they couldn't if they couldn't show citizenship they would they would not be allowed to pass into Florida now the truth is that began to get out early and it wasn't in fact the case but just a few weeks later the things that we were beginning to hear so when we left Virginia that day we really wondered what kind of problems we would have restaurants that were open on the way up were shut down on the way back live as we as we had known it really begin to shift [Music] and God gave us a message and the message was I am giving a Divine reset I am giving my people an opportunity while things are being reset around them I'm giving them an opportunity to be spiritually realigned and reset with the purposes of Heaven come on now and even though the season has passed and and did you know that they are anticipating that in May of this year they are going to announce the World Health Organization is going to announce in May of this year not now not March not April but in May of this year they're going to make the official declaration that the pandemic is over it's not official but in me it's going to be official they're going to schedule it you remember the spirit of God knows what the hearts of men don't know remember that we were Hearing in the news a few weeks after we were Hearing in the news that this was a disease that had come out of wet markets and the spirit of the Lord's right there spoke over this church and said this came out of a Lab yes yes this wasn't something out of a wet Market this was something that escaped and it had been even manipulated by man foreign and now what is the talk now they're they're bringing they're talking about bringing some of the men who argued that that down to to Justice they're talking about making them pay for their crime [Music] you know if you just listen to the Holy Spirit then you won't have to Panic or be paranoid you know we haven't really taken the time in a long time to thank God how he brought us through how many of y'all shouldn't we just take a moment [Applause] shouldn't we just take a moment to thank God how he brought us through [Applause] really God's been good to this church very few Services did we miss very few Services did we miss [Applause] he was so good to us let us not lose our opportunity to realign ourselves even now with the purposes of God first he judges then he makes War judge judges speak directly of judicial activity this requires a hearing of the evidence and then the rendering of a decision and a verdict I want you to know that it is a part of the inherent nature of God to be a judge it is a part of who he is a judging is not what he does a judge is who he is and when we think about a judge we think about we think about one who's ready to just Crown the Earth with judgment but we must understand that part are you still with me just a few more minutes we must understand that a part of his responsibility and who he is is not just to to bring judgment on the unrighteous but it's also a part of who he is to render Justice on behalf of the righteous and I saw some situations in the spirit while I was away that had been manipulated by the Enemy by the Accuser I saw some situations where the enemy had stood between certain people and what was rightfully theirs by the Kingdom Purpose of God and it'll make you mad enough to choke the devil to think that he would get between you and what God somebody said I don't even know if that kind of thing happens read Daniel chapter 10. Daniel Prayed in the minute that God prayed God sent an angel to give to give Daniel the answer but he got in the second heaven and the Prince of Persia withstood the angel of the Lord and they wrestled there in the heavens for days they wrestled in the second heavens for days until Lord Michael until the Prince Michael said wait a minute this can't go on like this and he came down into the second heaven and and and kicked I'm going to be clean temptation is there to be Raw but he kicked them you know picked that angel up and said now go do what I've sent you to do Daniel is weak he has fasted he has prayed he has travailed he's wondering if God even cares and all of a sudden one day the angel shows up steps into the room Daniel's falling around he's so weak oh don't worry about it Daniel take courage get up and get ready your prayer was heard the first day you prayed so don't you tell me that the enemy doesn't Delight in getting between people and their promise in getting between people and their blessing they're healing their Joy their prosperity he Delights in standing between you and your victory but in the spirit I begin to see that prayers were being offered and I don't mean now I lay me down to sleep prayers it's all right that's good prayer do it but I mean strategic prayers prayers that called and pleaded the case before the Ancient of Days the righteous judge of all and and and it it came in such a way that the judge could not help he he could not refuse the petition because the petition was made based on the blood there's no higher price the blood of Jesus Bobby Conner said one time to us he said there's going to be a greater Revelation and understanding of the appropriation of the blood than what the church has ever had before and I believe it I believe I've seen some of it in the spirit because all this arguing that goes on in the courtroom of Eternity all this arguing and going on and the enemy standing there making his case about why you don't deserve right now and if and some of what he says is true and that's why you and I have a responsibility to keep the dead cats off the line and walk in a state of repentance and I want to tell you something if you struggle with saying you're sorry you got bigger problems than that it's hard time that some of us apologized and made right some of the things we've done and gotten by with anybody with me it's hot time that we've made it right before God you could shut down your accuser you you could cause him to have to stand speedless speechless before the judge because there's nothing else to be said because you've repented and you've cried out to God and you've gone to your brother and you've gone to your sister and you've gotten it right and so now he just the judge says what is the accusation and normally the great sophist would just open his mouth and he would just begin to eloquently spew out all the things that you did wrong the way you didn't treat your wife right the way you didn't treat your children right the way you cheated on your job the way you took the stapler home that didn't belong to you hey come on you'll just but now it's all been made right it's all been confessed and the blood you'd be surprised what the blood calls into the courtroom when that blood is pleaded when the great defense attorney of all times there is no argument he never has to argue on on your behalf all he has to do is plead the blood there is no accusation that can stand against the power of the blood of Jesus Christ it silences the enemy as long as you've made everything right that needs to be made right I encourage you in this hour I don't have time to ground this today I don't have time to land the plane today even but I encourage you to go out of here seeking the Lord for any area of your life that the enemy may actually be telling the truth about you before the throne because in any place where the enemy is telling the truth about you watch this even the blood thank you even the blood can't free you Heaven is a place of order that other realm that that courtroom of justice is a place of of divine order and and there is a there is a a precedent there is a protocol that takes place if you've ever been in a trial if you've ever been a juror if you've ever watched a trial you you will know uh you know how things operate you hear the attorneys before they start spewing uh many especially older uh more old-fashioned attorneys will say always before they start talking may it please the court of course it pleases the court we just called on you but there's a protocol that says may it please the court it just it just it's like some of you have seen sister Flo leave a service sometime of course she had to go out and at times she's done like this just just respect it's not necessary but it's just an expression of respect that I may be distracting but it's important for me I got to go out so I can show at least or you might see somebody you know Crouch down a little bit not that they become invisible when they bow their head but it's just you know it's just a little protocol to say hey I realize that I I may be distracting but I I got to get up to the parking lot I gotta get to the back and and if you think there's protocol for how things operate here you you ought to begin to just uh catch a glimpse of how things operate in his great court of justice and if you think the devil Just Dances around like like Mr fancy pants you'd be surprised at your enemy you know he is the the Imp that responds to Blue Devil he prances when he has an opportunity in boast when he has a chance but he gets in the presence of that Divine judge and I want you to know he's business his business he's straight to the point and if he lays one accusation before that judge that has already been repented of and covered by the blood I want you to know in in a in a in a New York Minute the objection comes and the blood is planned settled and if that devil should go back to try to talk about that again [Music] order in this court you cannot bring before me any matter that has already been covered by the blood of the Lamb of God think about it so the enemy finally begins to run out of things that he can say to get between you and the case you want to make sure there's nothing standing there you're still with me we're closing we're closing we're closing deep calleth under the Deep we're closing pitch your neighbor tell him to sleep at lunch wake up now paragraph 98 thou Spirit of the devil that has bound my brother I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God who come to this earth and fought principalities and Rob Satan and you have no legal right to hold him anymore why because the blood now if you've not repented the blood is available but it doesn't cry out on your behalf service after service after service after service I begged them to repent I took a quote from the church age book or brother Branham said sometimes we just scream out I'm sorry hello and I begged them and I begged them the whole mind series was inspired by a spirit that I was having to battle in 2020 just a few weeks from now just a few weeks from now three years ago he gave me a message for them when the strong man meets the strong angel you go back and look over that series of sermons you go back and look at titles just titles and you'll hear that the spirit of God was crying out over and over and over again you don't have to come to the altar you don't have to make a public statement stand at your seat and cry out to God I'm so it's it's where it starts it's where we start repositioning ourselves just say yes even I am capable of error foreign no man no woman is infallible we have the need to keep coming back and saying Lord I'm sorry I miss this and when we do that the enemy has no legal rights to hold us anymore but when we refuse to repent and make right what we have done the enemy stands as our accuser and the problem is he stands between us and the victory so our whole lives has to be turned upside down and right all topsy-turvy and everything around us have to shift just so that God can begin to speak to our hearts and say when you when your case is heard you don't want the enemy to be able to say a word when he opens his mouth you want the blood to cry out shut him up every time are you with me let's go on and finish this one he said and we stand under the commission of Jesus Christ said they shall cast out devils and come out of the man in the name of Jesus Christ leave him he said can you hear me can you hear me now and this can you hear me now say Amen the brother says amen say Amen the brother says amen all right you may raise your head and look this way the man I didn't know how deaf he was just the deaf Spirit like a dark cold Shadow go like that moving to him now he has perfect hearing now why because the enemy had lost his legal rights listen just a moment come here I'm going to whisper real low this microphone verse sends it and brother Branham goes through I love the Lord yeah I love the Lord glory to God and the brother says glory to God and he says I'm whispering he said see this I'm going to put my hand over the microphone you won't hear it just me praise the Lord the brother continues to repeat and respond to what brother Adam says now I'm just barely Whispering listen to this can you hear me all right hear me now sir I can hear you playing yes now watch can you hear me now yes I can hear you playing amen God bless you you're healed my brother now look at this last next sentence he said now see watch the disease now if the man keeps believing that'll never come to him again something had given that demon a legal right to take that man's hearing and when that legal right was dealt with and repentance came that enemy could not stay he had to go and as long as that man kept believing and walking in faith that devil could never come back and hinder him again does that help anybody it sure does help me it sure does help me now let me give you another one speak to this rock and I know we got to go the devil hates me and I know he hates you too you just might as well know that you just might as well be settled on that the devil hates you I know you like for everybody to like you but the devil don't like you he hates you you represent to him everything that he wants and will never have the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's he's my enemy but as long as God's my friend I don't have no fear of him I just drive him right on back take the word of God and move him right on back out of his out of the place that he thinks he's aholden he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil and a password that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's wept yes sir he swept in sickness he swept in disappointment he swept in everything he Swift in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is is a big old Shadow hear him he said so he just might as well get on down the street I've just seen his red light go over a hill a while ago did you another man said the last time I saw the devil he was going over the hill the red light of his gone yes sir all right praise the Lord I begin to feel pretty good now and he should now in closing you just said that yeah one more time well it would help us if you didn't keep saying that he probably would this is a long one or you got you've got 10 more minutes good you can't send me on vacation and then expect me to come back exhausted right you got to think I'm going to come back refreshed and if I come back refreshed I ought to preach all day and I know of at least a dozen to be here right maybe or not I think that was a little conservative you just stay right with me I know you would but I won't do that to you this is uh it's a long one it is uh now that's right now I read this to you all but I preached this series just before we started putting these screen these thoughts up on the screen the quotes on the screen I was so disappointed for charity when I realized that this long quote had not been put in because it was just a few weeks after this in 2020 that we started putting the the quotes on the screen now stay with me and that night after speaking brother Johnson came to me and said brother Branham said I want to tell you he said I told you I wouldn't ask you to pray for people and just several had accepted Christ and all down along we had them lay their hands up towards the windows and so forth that wanted to accept Jesus there except Christ there in New Albany that's New Albany Indiana he's in West Palm Beach Florida now he said and I said now that's all right what is it brother he said I got a Sunday school teacher here and he said she's a neurotic very lovely person but said she's nervousness has struck her and said she's been about eight years like that and said she's a lovely person would you if you'd go out towards the window and down them steps would you just lay your hands on her and I said sure so as I started out I went down towards the steps and they had the little woman down at the bottom of the steps I expected the way he explained her to see somebody in a straight jacket but a lovely nice looking clean little woman looked like standing there about 30 years old 32. and she said how do you do brother Branham I said are you the patient she said yes I said what's the matter sister she said I don't know brother Branham I laid hands over on her and asked God to heal her eight years now she's been out of her head she she said she just couldn't she she just prayed she couldn't get away from the place there she was scared to death all the time and she said I've been going over to the psychiatrist and taking treatments over there mental treatments and said it cost ten dollars a time how much you think that cost today it's in the 50s I'd say it cost a whole lot more than ten dollars a a treatment and folks it could very well be that this was electoral therapy shock treatments because that is what they were doing for people who needed to be reset mentally they shocked them sometimes doing so much physical damage that even if the person got mental help they were physically left handicapped because of the electric shock that went through their body I go sometimes two times a week and said I've been going for years and I just get worse all the time and I said well God bless you my sister and deliver you from that in the name of Jesus Christ now folks it looks like stay back it looks like that would be enough here is a prophet messenger sent from God saved by the blood filled with the Holy Ghost Sanctified by the word a success Ministry like none other tens of thousands of people healed doctors verified full of authority looks like all he'd have to do is say God bless you my sister and deliver you from that in the name of Jesus Christ look to me like it ought to be all right let's go on I went on about three days after that wife and I were in New Albany and here that little lady was on the street with another woman she was holding her hands like this and I said are you any better sister she started crying and she said brother Branham I'm even getting worse a little place there called the White House where the ladies do their shopping I stepped up in a little place there and asked prayer for her again so then here she come up in a couple days in a car they brought her up some women and they had to hold her up to keep her in the car to bring her up she was just screaming she was scared the world was going to burst with her and she was afraid she was walking on top of the earth and it was going to sink and oh all kinds of things you know how nervous people are so I had prayed for her again third time brother Branham has prayed for this woman and she said brother Branham when you have a meeting close again if I have to be put I want to come when that anointing is on you so I can said I believe that you pray for me when that anointing was on it would Cast Away that evil spirit from me I said are you a Christian you living above sin she said yes brother Brandon I'm a Sunday school teacher and I said well I pray that God will grant it and she got kind of to be a good friend with my wife calling her on the phone she said now if the angel of the Lord ever comes to brother Brandon while he's at home you call me sister Branham well one morning getting up after a powerful Vision well my wife said she said honey is it still present I said yes she said let me call that little woman from New Albany will you I said what little woman she said uh well that little woman is so awful nervous and said I feel so sorry for the little thing she's got three children and I said well call her so I went in and just a few minutes they brought her up and I said put her to herself over in the room he brought her there to the house and then there's a man come in from the Walnut Street Baptist Church in Louisville with cancer on the liver dying it's been about three years ago he's still living no trace of cancer just as normal as he can be and the doctor said his liver just dried up or got hard or something or another I don't know what it was he was just barely living he's a great strong healthy man many of you people that follow us from meetings to meetings will see him right in the meeting heard him testify so then I was in dealing with him and my wife come and said that little woman from New Albany they got her out there in the other room so I went in there to where she was she was and I said I want to see her by myself and so then when the anointing is on when when go you to talking to a person now watch when you go to a person that's when Vision starts you contact their Spirit like Jesus talking to the woman at the well he contacted her spirit and that's exactly right there's no great mysticism of that and then the vision takes place she said sit down there and I said how are you feeling she said brother Brandon I don't know she said I'm just about to go crazy she said I just don't know how I can't stand it any longer and I said now I want you to try to get quiet and just look here to me just a moment talk she said yes sir yes sir I'm doing the best that I can brother Branham like that very lovely little person and after talking to her a few minutes moments I seen a little black car going like that the vision left me I said did you ever have a car accident she said no sir I never did have a car accident I said there's something strange I've seen a little unseated black car in a running like that and she said no I never did have a car accident and then I went ahead talking to her here come again the vision broke and I seen her with a blonde-headed man and she was riding fast in the car and an automobile was going in a train just barely missed them and she started screaming I can hear her but I was still in the vision and She fainted and fell in the floor and here was the vision she was got married just before the war a young girl her husband went overseas and when he went overseas she started getting Lonesome and she started having company with a blonde headed boy just pause the moment now do you see the picture the Branham had prayed for her three times pronounced that that Spirit would have to leave her alone and now she she began to really to get her own a concept of how Deliverance would come when that anointing comes I want to be there and she made friends with sister random I just love that every time I read that I just think that's a smart woman she just figured now if I can just get in the family a little bit and make friends with sister then when that anointing I love that to me that's like ripping the roof off and letting him down that she she was after her help and uh so um started having company with a blonde headed boy let's read on and one night being out she broke her marriage vow and lived untrue to her husband on the road in the train almost struck them and killed them I'm so sorry I got so distracted because my mind went back to a similar circumstance elfrida is not here to verify but it reminded me of a of a of a very similar thing that happened in one of our services one time when a vision like that broke out for a man who was on the Stream I saw a train and he was going from place to place very strange that it come to my mind like that and and then when my wife heard her scream she'd come into the room we got her up she began to scream she said Oh Brother random don't you tell that to nobody don't you tell that to nobody I said there you are sister I said unconfessed sin now now when the house when it'll be quiet she said but I had she'd all different people coming on her and all and pray for her and stomp devils and kick devils and everything else but he stayed right there I said and he will stay right there as long as you got that unconfessed sin so let me just say your accuser will stand between you and your Victory as long as you've got something that has not been made right but you get rid of that you let the blood deal with that you do what God would allow you to do to make that thing right then you push the accuser out of the way and the blood cries out on your behalf and if he opens his mouth against you again the blood shuts him up you said brother Branham I listen I confess that to God I know there's a bunch of cheaters in here and you're already reading ahead of me again it wasn't God you sinned against it was your husband you got to make that right she said oh I'd break up my home I said that's all I can say lady there is the cause and until you make that right you'll never get any better that's way back in she said I don't even think of that I said no you don't but your subconscious is thinking of that read it I want to tell you something this gift was was a genius brother Branham not even a grammar school education no Deliverance schools no schools of the prophets no no no conferences to go and learn how to operate in these things Baptist and God used that gift and things he spoke about the mind and the brain and how Spirits work were not even considered to be true and accurate in the time that he spoke them but now you hear Dr Caroline Leaf saying that 25 years ago when she started or 30 years ago she started in the research of the brain it was it was more commonly believed that the brain was fixed could never be repaired and you lived with the mind that you were born with can't change your IQ it's something you're born with and now all almost all brain scientists agree that through the miracle of neuroplasticity a person is able to rewire their brain and brother Brandon was preaching this in the 50s before it was ever that was a gift and you may get your little self all agitated with me for emphasizing that and I don't care I want to give honor where honor is due in a world of phonies in a world of flakes I want to tell you that somebody paid the prize and touched God and God used him because of it he's not he's not my my God he's my brother he's not to be worshiped he's to be heated we take everything he said and line it up with the scripture if we can't find it in the word we don't make some big Doctrine over it we just leave it what dovetails with that word we stand on that because we are thankful I'm thankful I hope I'm not sounding fanatical if I am okay no Psychiatry he said no you don't but your subconscious is thinking of that all the time and I said no psychiatrist could pull that out of you and I said you know that there's nobody in the world knows that but you and that man alone I said God's holy spirit has revealed to you and told you where your trouble now you go make that right with your husband and then you'll get well that's more noise than I expect she said I can't do it it would break up our home brother Branham she started crying said sister Branham don't you let him tell nobody that like that and I said now my wife said why he don't tell things like that sister said you know he wouldn't do that and she said and listen if if you should come supernaturally buy a piece of information or if someone who has come by something supernaturally should share that with you you shouldn't be a person to repeat that or or let that circulate among the people to do that would be so dangerous don't ever use something especially something you got Supernatural don't ever use that against somebody use it to try to help somebody tell the person guilty tell the person involved but be careful and don't don't don't feel your way into it if you don't know what to do with what you get pray about it he would leave me right now my husband and and said would break up my home what would happen to my little children and so forth This Woman's in a tether and I said look sister first clear yourself with God will take care of the rest of it so she said well I just can't do it brother Branham and I said of course now that's all I can do sister I've just done what God told me to do there's your trouble I said they can anoint you with oil every five minutes through the day for the rest of your life it'll never do you any good I said they might lay their hands on you and stomp and kick devils and say get out of here Satan but you don't you just don't have to holler at him he knows what faith is he knows what your life is so there's no need in you trying to bless him he will stay right there and got a right to stay there as he knows what his rights is what he can do and what he can't and she said well I just can't do it we're nearly done I started to walk away and she started crying I look back and standing by her side stood another man in a vision think about it God's about to come to This Woman's rescue I know you're tired I look back standing by her side of the other man in a vision I said isn't your husband kind of a tall man yes he has black hair yes Combs it over sideways kind of wavy yes and I said he's a deacon in your church that church yes and I said he's got the same rottenness to confess to you talk about freedom now that woman couldn't go home wild and mad this was the day that she had to tuck her own feelings and emotions down and she had to go take the Deliverance that God was about to give her and let it be this is good for the goose good for the gander kind of stuff isn't it he's got the same rottenness to confess to you I said when he landed in France told about a girl with him then said working doesn't he work for the Chevrolet company yes he does and I said there's a lady who works there that's a black-headed in the office I said he was in a Green Chevrolet car he was out in the lane at a certain place with that woman she was wearing a pink dress no more than the day before yesterday he's got the same thing to confess now brother Brandon would have never told that woman what that man did had God not brought it out in such a way that she was about to get the boldness she needed to confess her own why she said not my husband he's a deacon I said no wonder brother Johnson can't get nowhere down there I said such is that in your church that's right he said that's what's a whole lot of matter with a lot of churches too God will never bless God will never bless he'll never bless over sin and I said you go get your she said my husband wouldn't I said all right that's all I know you go get your husband make that thing right and you all get your life straightened up then God will be with you well I went on in to see another person and when I come back Mida she went in and called her husband on the phone the other ladies come and they went and met my wife said do you think they'll come back I said sure they'll be back so it hadn't been but a little while my wife said look coming up the steps here they come whoa here they come with their arms around one another seed Deliverance is possible and and help is possible you just got to get out from under the burden he said here they come with arms around one another just to cry and the tears running down their cheeks I open the door I said what about it he said brother Brandon my wife call me and I got in the car she come confessing to me that a wrong Shia did and said she come accuse me of the same thing and I said where have you been and she said it's a truth brother Branham I said I don't know you I've heard of You by Brother Johnson but said I never seen you but I want to shake your hand and say it's the absolutely truth and I'm guilty and no good to be called a father and my children are a deacon in the church and as soon as I can get to brother Johnson I'll resign from my job and I said don't do that see the difference between religion and relationship religion would have had that man standing down for 30 years but he was about to prove his relationship and God can work with that you see when a man is truly sorry when a woman's truly sorry their life changes their their demeanor changing their personality changes a man that's coming out of out from under a lie while he's the most humble person he's not bragging anymore he's humble he like my granny used to say he's as humble as an old dish rag he's not boasting on his family and boasting on his on his job and boasting on the things he's accomplishing no no no he's he gets way down low so that relationship with God can be re reformed and oh anyway it goes on I said don't do that just get right with God and continue with your job see I said no need to doing that he said oh if God would forgive me I said sure he'd forgive you now you confessed your wife ask her to forgive you you all forgive one another yes I said now sit down now is the time then I went down and said Heavenly Father this demon has tormented this girl for all these years has no legal right [Music] come on church I know you're tired well dismantling the accuser's case against you [Applause] musicians are slipping up he has no legal right to hold her now because it's done been found and made right now come out of her come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ and this is Brother Graham's report and she's perfectly normal and well from that time on c c what is it it goes slow but we get the costs see what I mean Visions that's the reason some of you send me letters and say brother Roberts will pray for 500 while while brother branham's praying for two brother Roberts is praying for people the way God told him to do it it's brother Oral Roberts he's talking about I'm doing it the way God told me to do it see but I want to know what I'm doing and before I condemn a satanic spirit and so forth I want to know first whether that's in God's legal plan his brother Bosworth said Jesus died for everyone that's right then if you're living in above that reproach and doing right then Satan has to turn loose of you but if there's anything back behind there maybe something that you ought to have done maybe you're living clean and pure but God told you something to do and you neglected to do it and god holds that right on you until you go back and make that thing right again whether it's something you should have done or should not have done do you see what I mean now but friends with sincerity and working for the kingdom of God yet I labor under the name of a psychologist or a fortune teller or a devil that's the things they were saying about him but I'm only happy I'm only glad that I can represent Jesus Christ and he knows my heart and he knows I'm no psychologist or fortune teller I'm a Christian your brother trying my best for the kingdom of God by the power of God to help his poor six suffering children and I pray to God with all my heart soul and mind tonight that you'll be one that he will help can we bow our heads just a moment for prayer isn't that powerful heavenly father it's so sweet to come to you in the name of thy son I bless tonight as your servant these people whatever you're buying on Earth I'll bind it in heaven remit all of our sins tonight Lord I pray that you'll do it and Grant Lord that there not be one person who's present now that'll be lost in the great final day May every one of them be saved that was how he ended this long story three times prayed for the same man that cast out thousands of demons heal the sick and raise a dead but that Spirit had a legal right to torment that woman because she was carrying that burden around of not laying it all out before the Lord I want us to stand you that are able to stand and we're going to ask the Lord I want parents to ask the Lord search our hearts for things that we might speak over our children I don't even want you to if if Mama has a diagnosis or Daddy has a diagnosis I don't want you to accept that for your children a person that has a ADHD or some social disorder like that they can have children that don't have such a thing if you see little things that concern you run to God go to the Lord and ask him to help our children amen but let's be careful what we speak over them if there is something that is giving the enemy a legal right to hold on in your life I encourage you this is not about seeing you embarrassed it's about seeing you free otherwise that thing will just keep coming back and coming back and coming back only you know if there is something that needs to be laid out before the Lord if there's something that you need to make or right with him do it because I'm telling you there's no greater feeling in all the world and and Truth in all the world than to know that when that enemy stands there to try to accuse you the blood cries out if there's nothing if he has no why why the Bible tells us that that the enemy came to Jesus but there was nothing in him to agree with the accusation when the enemy comes to try to take you out let there be nothing found in you that agrees with any part of the enemy this is our prayer Lord search our hearts let's pray together as they play something getting ready for worship Lord search our hearts today I've taken way more than my allotted time but I pray that you will somehow let this be a a mark somehow today Lord let this be a a state driving moment for somebody let this be a an hour where a burden rolls off and not only what we carried in our conscience but but maybe carrying in our subconscious mind because we've never fully brought it out let today be a day that we get out from under the the edge of that burden We Stand free in your presence Maybe by default you've agreed with something spoken in your presence it was non-edifying you'd like to get out from under that burden denying you that that's one of those that you don't get out from under by going telling somebody what you said you get out from under by coming to the Lord and saying Lord help me forgive me and help me for for and forgive me for coming into agreement with that and may I never ever ever agree with the wrong again let me come out from under that Hallelujah I know you're weary I certainly sense and know you are Jesus come and help us help us right now if you'd like to talk to him a moment before we worship why don't you come everyone who will why don't we come and gather as close as we can and and again I'm not going to mention it again but it's it's late there must be some reason why the enemy is allowed to keep coming back and back and back in the same manner that he has come time and time again may God give us an answer may God give you an answer today to get out from under the burden let's come and pray right now you keep talking to the Lord Lord here we are thank you for the blood thank you for the power of the blood thank you that the blood Cries Out Lord as we stand in your presence today if there is any legal right that the enemy could use to hold on in our life may he be exposed today may we take the first step in getting him kicked out of his lodging place he's Shabbat [Music] foreign talk to the Lord would you folks talk to him right now this doesn't have to be a a a heavy moment it can be a it can be a liberating moment once we get the account settled [Music] I feel that enemy and I know how he likes to duck he locks this duck down he likes to crouch down when the word is coming to expose him but we just say today that every lie of the enemies foreign even the thing that drives you back to the pornography even the thing that drives you back to the habits even the go to the root let the Holy Spirit go to the root you don't have to stand there and shame you don't have to stand here in condemnation you have come to fix it with the Lord you have come to let his blood cleanse you have come to take away Satan's legal rights today so that there is nothing that he can use to hold on in your life let him do it this is a serious moment yes it is let him do it let the Lord do it just like this [Music] Lord we worship in your presence right now to the sinner's ears and may sound strange your answers in worship Freedom could be found through death and pain just enter into his presence with us right now twice and his Perfection took place [Music] watching this service today pray the same prayer let God come to you right where you are and set you free please [Music] [Applause] [Music] one can wash away my sins what the blood is here today [Music] on again oh nothing but the blood yes Hallelujah [Music] there is nothing strong enough to stand [Music] against where love is done without stretched hands for now salvation flows for every man oh hi oh [Music] yeah and whosoever calls upon this name they will find their guilt and burn and roll away they are rise up to their feet forever change [Music] [Applause] [Music] what can make me [Music] and what can wash away is [Music] [Music] [Music] there is nothing strong enough to stand foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] so ever calls upon this is [Music] foreign [Music] for what can wash away myself [Music] [Music] myself [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus thank you thank you Jesus [Music]
