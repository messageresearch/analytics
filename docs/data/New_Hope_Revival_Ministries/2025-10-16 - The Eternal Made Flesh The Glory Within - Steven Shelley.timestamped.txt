[0:00] He was formed from a divine
[0:05] holy intervention,
[0:08] but given flesh that would feel, that
[0:13] would have emotion,
[0:15] &gt;&gt; that would experience
[0:17] ups and downs.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Why? So that he could be a high priest.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; So that he could be touched
[0:26] &gt;&gt; with the feeling of our infirmities.
[0:29] so that he can know what it's like to
[0:32] live as a man.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; What love.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "What love."
[0:38] &gt;&gt; What amazing love.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do it that way. He
[0:43] chose to do it that way.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; It is not a lesser administration.
[0:50] It is not a lesser office.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Right there.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; Not not a lesser manifestation.
[0:58] This is God,
[1:00] &gt;&gt; eternal,
[1:02] &gt;&gt; once invisible,
[1:04] &gt;&gt; now incarnate,
[1:07] &gt;&gt; in a body. Hallelujah.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; It's important to know that because if
[1:13] you don't fully understand that, you'll
[1:15] think that any baptism works and that
[1:19] any baptism is right and that any
[1:22] baptism is Christian. But when the
[1:25] father decided, I'm going to find a
[1:27] name. I'm going to get a name. I'm going
[1:30] to have a name. In fact, the New
[1:31] Testament says that the father
[1:35] gave him a name.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; At that name,
[1:40] every knee,
[1:43] &gt;&gt; help me just a little bit.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Every knee will bow and every tongue
[1:48] will confess. Salvation comes in no
[1:51] other way, in no other form, by no other
[1:54] name. Amen.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Than that precious name in English, we
[1:58] would say of the Lord Jesus Christ. When
[2:01] you're baptized in that name, you're not
[2:03] leaving Father out. You're not leaving
[2:04] Holy Spirit out. You're attaching
[2:07] yourself to a name that was so high, so
[2:11] chosen, so exalted that it was large
[2:14] enough
[2:17] &gt;&gt; to be worn by the one that the scripture
[2:21] said
[2:23] &gt;&gt; in him
[2:24] &gt;&gt; dwelt. Help me
[2:26] &gt;&gt; dwelt.
[2:31] One part of God, one office of God,
[2:35] &gt;&gt; one administration of God,
[2:38] &gt;&gt; all
[2:40] &gt;&gt; in him dwelt all
[2:43] &gt;&gt; the fullness,
[2:45] &gt;&gt; the fullness
[2:47] &gt;&gt; of the Godhead.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50] All the offices,
[2:52] &gt;&gt; all of the attributes,
[2:54] &gt;&gt; all the redemptive names and descriptive
[2:56] titles,
[2:58] &gt;&gt; all of them,
[3:00] &gt;&gt; dwelt in him. The scripture said the
[3:03] fullness of God
[3:04] &gt;&gt; dwelt in him. How
[3:07] &gt;&gt; bodily.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; So now you've got Jehovah Rafa.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; You've got Jehovah Shama.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; You You've got all of that
[3:16] &gt;&gt; now covered under one name.
[3:22] But Jesus didn't say, "I'll send you the
[3:24] third person."
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "I
[3:29] &gt;&gt; will."
[3:29] &gt;&gt; You won't stay comfortless
[3:32] &gt;&gt; for long,
[3:34] &gt;&gt; because I will
[3:37] &gt;&gt; come to you.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; How is it possible?
[3:43] I I'm going to leave, but I'll come
[3:45] again.
[3:47] He was going to change bodies.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; He had accomplished what needed to be
[3:54] accomplished in that earthly body for
[3:57] now of our Lord Jesus Christ. The body
[4:01] went into the ground. He was resurrected
[4:03] as a as a glorified Christ
[4:06] &gt;&gt; like John saw him in Revelation chapter
[4:10] one.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; But the spirit that was in him
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. was now going to fall on 120
[4:19] gathered in the upper room.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; And even though it greatly offends
[4:24] people, I take great delight in saying
[4:26] it as often as possible that the enemy
[4:29] now he no longer had to deal with one
[4:31] Jesus.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; I know what the religious mind says.
[4:36] This is blasphemy.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; There's only one Jesus.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; But you you don't understand. The father
[4:41] had a bigger plan than that from the
[4:43] beginning. Right.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; He He didn't just want one house.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; He wanted a house with lots of rooms.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; He wanted a house with lots of places
[4:55] &gt;&gt; that he could dwell
[4:57] &gt;&gt; and not just to put you on a shelf like
[5:00] a trophy.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; But so that in the last of the last
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. at the end of the end times,
[5:09] &gt;&gt; he could not only live in us and dwell
[5:11] in us as as as his purchased possession,
[5:15] but that he could move through us
[5:19] &gt;&gt; in a quick short work.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; Unlike the world has ever seen.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; A final harvest.
