[43:34] something
[43:36] I I'd like
[43:39] to I'd like to tell you what he saw he
[43:43] saw that representation of
[43:45] himself that seed that he had placed in
[43:48] The Believer that's what he was bringing
[43:51] back to himself you may be seated this
[43:53] morning it was God Gathering himself
[43:57] together through the mighty Plan of
[44:00] Redemption and I'm so thankful for that
[44:04] that's the part of our Redemption that
[44:06] we have very little to do
[44:08] with you didn't choose him he chose you
[44:13] and he saw your choice thank God he
[44:16] didn't take away your free will but he
[44:19] saw that you were going to choose him
[44:21] and so he just said I choose
[44:24] first that's what that's what for
[44:26] knowledge is all about we're thankful
[44:29] okay somebody's got some music playing
[44:31] can we fix that got it okay thank you I
[44:34] I kept hearing it and it's good music I
[44:37] think but uh we don't need it right now
[44:39] do
[44:40] we uh we want to thank you for uh all
[44:44] your prayers for all of those who have
[44:46] really had a tough time well first let
[44:48] me say to brother Josh uh Alano you
[44:51] might have had a rough start but the
[44:53] anointing makes the difference when the
[44:56] anointing came and I'm I'm telling it
[44:58] this way because he hadn't planned to
[45:00] sing We don't enjoy asking people to
[45:02] sing this is not a concert we don't run
[45:05] our services like other groups where
[45:07] everybody has a song We like for people
[45:10] to to have uh something laid on their
[45:13] heart and we like for them to let us
[45:15] know they've got a song and if we feel
[45:17] like we even like to know what it is
[45:19] does that sound terrible we like to know
[45:21] what the song is because we'd like to
[45:23] see if it kind of goes along with the
[45:25] service theme that we're trying to build
[45:28] but on occasion when no one turns one in
[45:30] and we feel like we might need a song uh
[45:33] then we will send and Joshua said well
[45:35] I'll go ask Josh he's always willing and
[45:39] you know when you don't sing that often
[45:40] and there's so many different songs
[45:42] running through your mind the musicians
[45:44] sometime may find a hard find it hard to
[45:47] just pull that tune up just because Josh
[45:49] says my song well I don't know but
[45:52] sometimes that's not always easy to
[45:54] remember but I love the fact fact that
[45:56] he was willing and I love the fact he
[45:58] was giving it his all but when the Holy
[46:00] Spirit Come when the anointing of the
[46:02] Lord comes it it supersedes all the
[46:07] effort and the skill and and and it
[46:09] overrides the music and if someone's off
[46:12] or hits a wrong note on the base or some
[46:14] other instrument the anointing just
[46:16] destroys the Yoke some people may have a
[46:19] good voice as far as singing goes but if
[46:22] there's no anointing on it then it
[46:25] doesn't get in anything done how many of
[46:27] you love the sweet anointing of the Holy
[46:30] Spirit we've we've certainly experienced
[46:32] him today uh this has been a hard two
[46:35] weeks for a lot of folks and uh I have
[46:38] to be pretty still or I go back into a
[46:40] coughing fit uh I think the pneumonia is
[46:43] clearing up but the bronchitis is still
[46:45] there but um the doctor said give it a
[46:48] 10 another 10 days but I I just know it
[46:51] could it can lift in the morning it can
[46:52] lift right now and I am much better
[46:55] brother gy is ministering the word of
[46:57] the Lord to us this morning I so
[46:59] appreciate him doing that um I can't
[47:02] right now I can't get my brain wrapped
[47:04] around the idea that we have to travel
[47:06] this week at toward the end of the week
[47:09] but some of us are going to Pennsylvania
[47:10] for a wedding I'm not a wedding person I
[47:14] I don't I don't it doesn't make me feel
[47:16] clouded uh or or uh prestigious when
[47:20] someone invites me to come to a wedding
[47:22] I I'm just that's just not really my cup
[47:24] of tea but uh Amy Crossman uh brother
[47:28] G's nephew
[47:30] niece is getting married and uh she's a
[47:35] very special girl to a lot of us and uh
[47:38] their their love story was quick and it
[47:42] was pretty special and so she wanted us
[47:45] to be there so pray that the Lord will
[47:47] give us a touch between now and getting
[47:49] on an airplane I understand that's one
[47:51] of the sickest environments you can be
[47:53] in so I want to be well and I know these
[47:56] others that are going to be going you're
[47:57] going to be left in very good hands
[47:59] we're going to leave you in the hands of
[48:01] the Holy Spirit and he's going to come
[48:03] next Sunday and minister to your need
[48:05] and to your life through brother Hawke
[48:08] so we want to ask you to pray for him
[48:10] this week uh we know this is the mind of
[48:13] God we know this is God's Will and we
[48:15] know that God's going to use him to talk
[48:17] to you but he needs a little extra
[48:19] prayer he's uh I don't know if you can
[48:21] get rusty or not but but if you're out
[48:23] of the swing of things sometimes it's
[48:25] getting back in the in the saddle let's
[48:28] pray that God will inspire him and give
[48:31] him boldness and uh he's walking through
[48:34] an unusual time in his life where where
[48:37] you know when when God's all we have
[48:39] that's all we need and we and we run to
[48:42] him and I know personally that he's been
[48:44] seeking the Lord in a in a in a
[48:46] desperate way and you know when we do
[48:48] that we're lining ourselves up and
[48:50] getting ready to hear from God so I
[48:52] believe it's going to be a very special
[48:54] uh uh time
[48:56] tomorrow January the 8th is the uh
[48:59] anniversary of the of the pillar of fire
[49:02] that came into the Tabernacle that
[49:04] morning and Drew on the wall the faces
[49:07] of the church age moons and uh if you've
[49:10] never heard that tape you would be
[49:12] blessed to hear it when the presence of
[49:14] the Lord comes and people begin to see
[49:16] the light one of the most fascinating
[49:18] things about that tape is when brother
[49:20] brandom says that's not it there some of
[49:23] you are not looking it's here and I find
[49:26] that kind of kind of uh unusual because
[49:29] sometimes we can get distracted and
[49:31] think that we're looking at the right
[49:33] thing and we're only looking at the
[49:35] image of the right thing and we have to
[49:37] come back to the word which is our
[49:40] absolute when we approach this message
[49:43] that's how we need to approach it it it
[49:45] is it is certainly a reflection of the
[49:48] word but there is an original word there
[49:51] is an absolute it's God's Bible it's
[49:54] God's holy script scripture and I'm
[49:56] thankful to have it I love him and I
[49:58] love his word don't you and so we wanted
[50:01] to just to mention that also you have
[50:04] been praying with us about Israel you
[50:06] know that our lease was to end in
[50:08] February just this week we have heard it
[50:11] was a long hard process to be able to
[50:15] hear back from the new owner but just
[50:17] this week I had an email finally after
[50:21] after sending my email multiple times we
[50:24] finally got an answer back they have
[50:26] agreed to extend our lease for one more
[50:29] year I can't tell you the relief that
[50:32] that brings to us uh the the lease price
[50:36] is going up it will it will be between
[50:39] $600 and $800 more a month which is hard
[50:43] for me to imagine but it is uh it's the
[50:46] price of being desperate and needing the
[50:49] place the the family that owns it are
[50:51] are very uh happy at this point I think
[50:55] that that that we're going to do that
[50:57] their original intention was to buy it
[50:59] and move in immediately and uh you know
[51:02] War can shift things around a little bit
[51:05] and so I am looking to be able to spend
[51:07] some time this year in Israel sorting
[51:10] through the stuff and getting ready for
[51:13] the new chapter whatever God has for us
[51:15] there so I wanted to thank you for
[51:17] praying and I wanted to thank you for
[51:19] your continued giving because we are
[51:22] we're certainly still in our old lease
[51:24] and then in February we begin a new
[51:26] lease and your giving makes that
[51:28] possible it's rare that we have to to
[51:32] pull something from somewhere else to
[51:34] make that happen uh if it is it's
[51:36] usually no more than $400 or500 because
[51:39] many of you have not missed a beat in
[51:42] all of the other projects you've not
[51:44] missed a beat remembering Israel every
[51:46] month you know God sees that he we we
[51:50] need our prayer we need to continue to
[51:52] pray for the hostages and to pray for
[51:55] for those who are risking their lives
[51:57] every day for Freedom it's not nearly
[51:59] over but God is going to establish
[52:02] something I believe it I believe that
[52:04] what he's doing right now is cleansing a
[52:06] path and making a way for a move of the
[52:08] spirit in the land of Israel and
[52:11] unfortunately it takes some Sometimes
[52:13] some physical uh shakings and some even
[52:17] death and and hardship to get us to a
[52:19] place where we're ready for God and God
[52:22] only the only answer for Israel is the
[52:25] same answer for every nation of the
[52:27] world and that is to surrender to the
[52:30] Lord if we trust in religion religion
[52:32] will fail us but if we trust in the god
[52:35] of the Bible we'll be all right are you
[52:38] with me and I want to mention One Last
[52:41] Thing Before brother gy comes to
[52:43] minister today and that is you have
[52:46] continued to give also in your building
[52:49] fund and sometimes it's Mark building
[52:51] fund and sometimes it's Mark Campground
[52:54] but since we were able to pay off the
[52:57] church you have given an additional
[53:01] $4,600 into the into the building fund
[53:04] well we're already beginning going to
[53:07] begin to tap into that very shortly and
[53:10] we're not pres not uh able this morning
[53:14] to present to you the whole program or
[53:16] the whole plan uh but God's got
[53:19] something good and we're going to have a
[53:22] place to Fellowship sooner rather than
[53:24] later
[53:26] isn't that good news and uh we feel like
[53:30] really we feel like that uh something
[53:32] prophetic is taking place because we
[53:35] brother gy can he might share it I don't
[53:37] know if he planned to share it or not
[53:39] but anyway uh they set a power pole
[53:42] yesterday down by the Tabernacle and you
[53:45] know what that's progress that means
[53:48] that after many years electricity is
[53:50] going to be hooked up to that building
[53:52] down there and we anticipate that it
[53:54] will soon be usable for the further
[53:57] purposes of God you can imagine the cost
[54:01] and uh we might would have shuddered at
[54:04] that at one point but we have seen the
[54:06] supernatural of God we know what he can
[54:09] do and so they're already working
[54:12] they're already doing some things
[54:13] there's planning going on and there's
[54:16] some engineering that had to take place
[54:18] for the power company to come and bring
[54:20] power and there's requirements for us to
[54:22] do and and uh the expenses start coming
[54:25] so let me encourage you to keep giving
[54:28] because we're in a financial position
[54:30] now that everything you give for the
[54:32] building fund or for the campground we
[54:35] can put that right in a separate account
[54:37] because we don't have that $4,100 church
[54:40] payment hanging on us every month isn't
[54:42] he good so I hope we can put that much
[54:46] or
[54:49] [Applause]
[54:50] more and we'll share more when we know
[54:53] more but it's it's kind of a it's kind
[54:56] of a day-by-day thing well now the plans
[54:58] have changed twice or three times when I
[55:00] say plans not plans ideas really wasn't
[55:02] it but they've changed two or three
[55:04] times already just as you start making
[55:07] baby steps then something else comes up
[55:10] and you say well we might as well do it
[55:12] this way we might as well think about
[55:13] this way so we're not trying to keep
[55:15] anything from you we know you're going
[55:17] to be excited we know that it's going to
[55:19] be a wonderful Next Step but we want to
[55:22] know what we're talking about when we
[55:24] talk
[55:25] so somebody doesn't come but you said we
[55:29] want to know what we're saying don't you
[55:31] think that's important let's stand I'm
[55:33] ready to hear what God has for us today
[55:36] uh I'll be uh Lord willing I'll try to
[55:39] minister here Tuesday night and next
[55:41] Tuesday night and as we said brother
[55:43] haulk will be ministering in the morning
[55:47] um let me just see
[55:53] this they're just the the the Aspen Wall
[55:56] family has just mentioned to me again
[55:57] that their little granddaughter is
[55:59] really ill and they're just asking us to
[56:02] pray again that she would be able to
[56:04] drink and eat a little something and
[56:05] doesn't get dehydrated from all the
[56:07] vomiting and the other other uh side
[56:10] effects of the flu and I know that God
[56:13] these are precious friends of ours and I
[56:15] know that God's going to hear their
[56:16] prayer and we're going to believe God
[56:18] with them so let's keep doing that
[56:20] father we thank you today that your word
[56:24] is y and amen we thank you for the
[56:27] unction of the holy spirit that we've
[56:29] already felt in this house and we know
[56:32] you're coming now to deliver a word to
[56:34] us that we're needy of we may not even
[56:37] know what we need but we thank you that
[56:39] the word discerns our needs even when we
[56:42] can't identify them for ourselves so
[56:45] Lord again we ask for special Grace on
[56:48] that funeral service today that you
[56:50] would comfort those hearts that you
[56:53] would surround them with your love and
[56:55] that you would use this hardship and
[56:57] heartache as an opportunity to draw each
[57:00] and every one of them closer to your
[57:03] side we lift up this precious little
[57:05] granddaughter of the Aspen walls that
[57:07] you would touch her from the top of her
[57:09] little head to the souls of her little
[57:12] feet and you would give her miraculous
[57:14] healing in the name of Jesus that her
[57:17] little body would just fight with
[57:19] everything it has and that your
[57:21] anointing and healing virtue would do
[57:23] the rest Lord move over this house right
[57:26] now and touch every person who needs
[57:29] strength and healing we're not just uh
[57:32] upset about symptoms Lord we want you to
[57:35] go to the root of the condition and
[57:37] bring healing in the mighty name of
[57:40] Jesus and for those who need travel

[57:52] brother today with a cold from on high

[57:59] now and focus on your voice to us and
[58:03] may we have a heart to hear and may we
[58:06] have a will to obey it's not hearing
[58:09] only but it's doing your word that
[58:13] activates the supernatural so may we
[58:15] hear and may we find Grace to do it and
[58:19] we will give you glory and honor and
[58:22] praise for it's in the name of the Lord

[1:00:51] power even to love him amen amen
[1:00:55] we're going to look to the word again
[1:00:56] today in Hebrews chapter 1 while you're
[1:00:59] finding the scripture can you pull these
[1:01:01] lights down I'd like to show a few
[1:01:04] pictures uh of of just to show you uh
[1:01:09] the difference that you're giving made
[1:01:11] some weeks ago we took an offering for
[1:01:13] some windows and doors in a church
[1:01:15] building in India and uh there's some
[1:01:19] before and after pictures there that's
[1:01:21] the building without the doors and the
[1:01:23] windows and um God has blessed them and
[1:01:28] there you can see the doors and the
[1:01:29] windows in the building and that is
[1:01:32] because that you gave to the Lord and so
[1:01:35] we take part in What the Lord is doing
[1:01:38] in that place and we give the Lord Glory
[1:01:41] because he is the one who blessed us to
[1:01:43] be able to
[1:01:48] [Music]

[1:01:55] uh he pastors a church and he has many
[1:01:57] men that work with him I would say that
[1:01:59] he has uh an Apostolic calling on him he
[1:02:03] goes to so many places um one other
[1:02:07] thing before we look to the scripture
[1:02:10] thank you musicians I'm so thankful that
[1:02:12] the Lord has blessed us with you and
[1:02:15] your
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:20] gift brother Shelly was talking about
[1:02:23] things moving along this uh on here on
[1:02:25] the campground and I I'm not going to
[1:02:28] say a lot about it just yet because
[1:02:30] we're still trying to do some uh get
[1:02:33] some ideas but would you pray for the
[1:02:35] favor of the Lord this week that uh
[1:02:39] specifically this week we need the favor
[1:02:41] of the Lord and I would appreciate your
[1:02:43] prayers concerning that Hebrews chapter
[1:02:46] 1 and we'll start with verse 10 just
[1:02:48] like we did on Tuesday night and thou
[1:02:51] Lord in the beginning Hast laid the
[1:02:53] foundation of the earth and the heavens
[1:02:57] are the work of thy
[1:02:58] hands they Shall Perish but thou
[1:03:01] remainest and they all shall wax old as
[1:03:04] do a garment and as a vesture shall thou
[1:03:07] fold them up and they shall be changed
[1:03:10] but Thou Art the same and thy year shall
[1:03:13] not fail but to which of the Angels said
[1:03:16] he at any time sit on my right hand
[1:03:20] until I make thine enemies thy foot stol
[1:03:23] are they not all ministering Spirits
[1:03:26] sent forth to minister to them who shall
[1:03:29] be Heirs of
[1:03:31] Salvation on to chapter 2 verse one
[1:03:35] therefore we ought to give the more
[1:03:36] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:03:40] heard lest at any time we should let
[1:03:43] them slip for if the word spoken by
[1:03:47] Angels was
[1:03:48] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:03:51] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:03:54] of of reward how shall we escape if we
[1:03:58] neglect so great salvation yes which at
[1:04:02] the first began to be spoken by the Lord
[1:04:05] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:04:09] heard him God also bearing them witness
[1:04:13] both with signs and wonders and with
[1:04:16] diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:19] according to his own will For unto the
[1:04:22] Angels hath he not put in subjection the
[1:04:25] world to come whereof we speak but one
[1:04:29] in a certain place testified saying what
[1:04:32] is man that thou art mindful of him or
[1:04:36] the son of man that thou visitest him
[1:04:40] thou mest him a little lower than the
[1:04:42] Angels thou crownest him with glory and
[1:04:45] honor and did set him over the works of
[1:04:48] thy hands thou has put all things in
[1:04:51] subjection under his feet for in that he
[1:04:54] put all in subjection under him he left
[1:04:57] nothing that is not put under him but
[1:05:00] now we see not yet all things put under
[1:05:04] him but we see Jesus who was made a
[1:05:06] little lower than the angels for the
[1:05:09] suffering of death crowned with Glory
[1:05:12] and Honor that he by the grace of God
[1:05:14] should taste death for every man yes sir
[1:05:17] for it became him for whom are all
[1:05:20] things and by whom are all things in
[1:05:24] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:05:27] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:05:30] through suffering amen let us pray one
[1:05:34] more time before we uh have our seats
[1:05:37] father we just want to say thank you
[1:05:40] that we could be in your presence today
[1:05:42] thank you Lord that you surround us with
[1:05:45] your presence and we thank you that you
[1:05:47] are moving Among Us Lord and you are
[1:05:50] doing in our lives what we cannot do for
[1:05:53] ourselves as we surrender to you I thank
[1:05:56] you Lord that you are still healer and
[1:05:59] that you are bringing healing to our
[1:06:01] bodies I thank you that you're still
[1:06:03] deliverer and you're bringing
[1:06:05] Deliverance to us Lord as we have need
[1:06:09] Lord It's seems sometimes we're so far
[1:06:11] from the mark but I thank you for Grace
[1:06:15] unmar favor that has been given to us
[1:06:17] Lord now we ask you that you will have
[1:06:20] your way May the angels be in their
[1:06:23] position as we are in ours get honor and
[1:06:26] glory for it's in the name of the Lord
[1:06:28] Jesus Christ that we pray amen amen
[1:06:33] praise the Lord you may have your seats
[1:06:44] today 1950 it shall be even as it was
[1:06:49] told
[1:06:49] me brother brandham says see God always
[1:06:53] had had ministering Spirits I believe in
[1:06:58] them I believe in ministering Spirits
[1:07:01] sent from the presence of God the Holy
[1:07:04] Spirit ministers led the church Guardian
[1:07:08] guardian angels that watch over us their
[1:07:12] Angels always behold the face of My
[1:07:15] Father which is in heaven is that right
[1:07:19] and then another one which I gave you
[1:07:21] one line out of and uh what think ye of
[1:07:25] Christ paragraph 38 I see another Angel
[1:07:29] he's talking about the uh the young man
[1:07:32] in the fiery furnace he says I see
[1:07:34] another Angel come up in his name's
[1:07:36] wormwood he destroyed the anti delvian
[1:07:39] world with Waters he has control of them
[1:07:42] he's going to do something in the last
[1:07:44] days with them turn them all bitter so I
[1:07:47] can hear him right quick run up and fall
[1:07:49] down before his majesty and say oh
[1:07:52] Master have you looked down there angels
[1:07:55] are concerned about what we believe
[1:07:59] about
[1:08:01] Christ Angels let me repeat that line
[1:08:04] angels are concerned about what we
[1:08:08] believe about Christ have you considered
[1:08:11] down there and he goes on to talk about
[1:08:13] that uh if he the Lord would just give
[1:08:16] him command he would go and that he
[1:08:18] would wash Babylon off of the map on the
[1:08:20] earth because uh to save those three
[1:08:24] Hebrew boys but now God knows what he's
[1:08:27] doing and he knows how much of a fiery
[1:08:29] furnace that he wants to take us through
[1:08:31] before that the angels are sent with
[1:08:34] their commission to deliver us so uh on
[1:08:39] on Tuesday night we talked about a
[1:08:41] prophetic word that had come here in
[1:08:44] October uh of
[1:08:46] 2023 and how that the Lord talked to us
[1:08:49] about an increase of the Angelic
[1:08:52] activity that would be around us and he
[1:08:54] started talking to us about the things
[1:08:57] that we might see flashes of light or we
[1:09:00] might see their outline and how that
[1:09:02] they would come to us and they would be
[1:09:05] assistance to us and uh so we uh keep
[1:09:10] that in our mind and think about the
[1:09:12] things that the Lord desires to do for
[1:09:15] us and in Us and how that he would use
[1:09:19] the angels in that work the ministering
[1:09:23] spirit that have been given to us in the
[1:09:26] end time are not just for us to say oh
[1:09:30] we got a lot of angels around us we have
[1:09:32] a necessity to cooperate with them um I
[1:09:37] think that many times because we don't
[1:09:40] see them uh we don't take time to
[1:09:43] remember that they're even there and
[1:09:45] when we don't see them and we don't feel
[1:09:49] them uh and we don't perceive that
[1:09:52] they're around us we just go on with our
[1:09:55] life H because we're so tied to what we
[1:09:59] can see what we can hear what we can
[1:10:01] taste what we can feel what we can smell
[1:10:05] that's the way we connect to this
[1:10:07] environment that is around us but
[1:10:09] there's a whole another unseen realm
[1:10:12] that God has given into our hands that
[1:10:16] he wants us to cooperate with he wants
[1:10:19] us to understand what they do what their
[1:10:22] job is how they minister to us and there
[1:10:26] are times that he opens our eyes and
[1:10:29] lets us see that's right and we know
[1:10:33] that through all of the ages God has
[1:10:37] worked with angels and he sent them to
[1:10:40] people and it's one of those things
[1:10:43] where that you hear stories about it but
[1:10:47] if if you've never encountered one in a
[1:10:50] way that you thought was tangible you
[1:10:53] forgive about
[1:10:54] them but we don't want to forget about
[1:10:57] this Angelic activity because God made
[1:11:01] us a promise that he was going to
[1:11:03] increase that Angelic activity and so we
[1:11:06] desire to look into this to find ways uh
[1:11:11] to find how that Angels operate how what
[1:11:14] they do on our behalf uh we always keep
[1:11:18] in mind that we do not worship
[1:11:22] angels
[1:11:25] we are not going to worship them we
[1:11:28] worship only the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:11:31] one who died for our sins the one who
[1:11:34] paid the price that we could have
[1:11:37] eternal life thank you Jesus yet through
[1:11:40] the scripture Old and New Testament God
[1:11:44] sent angels I begin to think about some
[1:11:48] of these instances where that God sent
[1:11:51] angels and I begin to wonder did every
[1:11:56] one of these where it says that an angel
[1:12:00] came to
[1:12:01] them did they actually see the
[1:12:06] angel because in some instances it says
[1:12:09] it was as the appearance of an Angel
[1:12:12] whereas there were other times that it
[1:12:14] just said an angel came to them did they
[1:12:17] actually see light did they see an
[1:12:21] outline of a man some of them actually
[1:12:24] saw
[1:12:26] men all right so I I want to go quickly
[1:12:29] through these again uh I'm uh I'm asking
[1:12:33] you we're going to we're going to flash
[1:12:34] him up on the screen today and uh don't
[1:12:37] critique my notes this is uh this is not
[1:12:40] my strong point uh God called me to be a
[1:12:44] preacher and a preacher is one who
[1:12:47] delivers good
[1:12:48] news and this is good news that God
[1:12:52] would let let his angels be a part of
[1:12:55] our
[1:12:56] life that we could actually
[1:12:59] partake of what they have to offer and
[1:13:03] that their assistance would help us in
[1:13:06] this journey all right so the first
[1:13:08] place we're the first one we're going to
[1:13:10] talk about is the uh I'm going to be
[1:13:13] repeating so uh just bear with us
[1:13:16] service to those who have inheritance
[1:13:19] Hebrews 1:14 which we've already read
[1:13:22] are they not all ministering Spirits
[1:13:26] sent forth to minister for them who
[1:13:29] shall be Heirs of Salvation is anybody
[1:13:33] in here an air of
[1:13:35] Salvation join hirs with Jesus Christ I
[1:13:39] I love the scripture in Ephesians that
[1:13:41] talks about our inheritance that has
[1:13:44] been given to us as Believers and so as
[1:13:49] a as one who inherits salvation these
[1:13:53] angels are sent for me so that is the
[1:13:57] first thing that you can identify that
[1:14:00] Angels if if you are an heir of
[1:14:03] Salvation then the ministering Spirits
[1:14:06] are sent forth for you
[1:14:08] amen all right the next thing we're
[1:14:10] going to look at is they reveal unknown
[1:14:14] truths in Daniel 10: 14 to 21 the angel
[1:14:19] came to Daniel to show him what was
[1:14:21] coming to his people in the latter days
[1:14:24] and we also find in chapter 8 and
[1:14:27] chapter nine of Daniel where that this
[1:14:29] angel came to him specifically in 89
[1:14:33] Gabriel came to him and was telling him
[1:14:36] about some things that were going to
[1:14:38] happen to his people the Jewish people
[1:14:41] in time to come he told Daniel you seal
[1:14:45] it up you can't talk about it but
[1:14:48] there's going to come something in the
[1:14:50] latter time and the angel is the one
[1:14:52] that came to death Daniel Daniel was one
[1:14:55] he he I I I suspect that Daniel had
[1:14:58] somewhat of an inquisitive mind he
[1:15:01] didn't just lolly gag along in his life
[1:15:04] and say everything's going to be all
[1:15:06] right in the end but he had an
[1:15:07] inquisitive mind and he wanted to know
[1:15:10] some things and so in his desire to know
[1:15:13] some things the angel of the Lord he
[1:15:15] talked to the Lord about it and the
[1:15:18] angel of the Lord came to him and
[1:15:20] revealed uh these things to him
[1:15:24] we find in Ezekiel chapter 40 uh Ezekiel
[1:15:28] describes a man whose appearance was
[1:15:31] like
[1:15:37] brass now you don't look like
[1:15:42] brass unless you've been got out and got
[1:15:44] a suntan I guess but you don't look like
[1:15:47] but that's the way Ezekiel described
[1:15:49] this man this angel that came to him and
[1:15:52] began to talk to him concerning the
[1:15:54] millennial
[1:15:55] Temple and then in the Book of
[1:15:57] Revelation John saw the angels to the
[1:16:00] churches he saw the Angels around the
[1:16:02] throne he saw angels with trumpets and
[1:16:05] vials John got to see all of
[1:16:10] this Angels everywhere but Revelation 1
[1:16:15] verse one says this the revelation of
[1:16:18] Jesus Christ which God gave to him to
[1:16:21] show unto his servants things which must
[1:16:25] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:16:28] signified it by his Angel unto his
[1:16:32] servant John so all that John saw was
[1:16:36] because an angel came and showed it to
[1:16:39] him and if you look at this in The New
[1:16:41] American Standard instead of signified
[1:16:44] it by his Angel it means it was
[1:16:46] communicated by the angel to John
[1:16:49] because God used the angel to get it
[1:16:52] across to to John that there's some
[1:16:54] things that I want you to be able to
[1:16:57] write down now remember Revelation is uh
[1:17:01] we're told that the Revelation is a book
[1:17:04] of symbols right that's right so when
[1:17:06] John was given all of this Revelation
[1:17:09] and he got to see all of this stuff and
[1:17:11] he wrote it down in the in the form that
[1:17:13] we have in the Book of Revelation John
[1:17:16] didn't understand all of
[1:17:20] it neither do we understand all of it
[1:17:23] because so much of it is in symbol form
[1:17:26] that's right yet God in his grace comes
[1:17:29] in the end time and he continues to
[1:17:31] reveal himself to us all right so then
[1:17:35] we go on to personal
[1:17:38] guidance Matthew 1: 20 and 21 the angel
[1:17:44] came to Joseph in a
[1:17:46] dream now this was not Joseph out
[1:17:50] working his carpenter shop and all of
[1:17:52] the sudden an angel in the form of a Man
[1:17:54] shows up to him this is a angel shows up
[1:17:58] in Joseph's dream giving him guidance
[1:18:00] about what to do about this uh his
[1:18:04] fiance Mary who is pregnant he didn't
[1:18:07] know what to do he was going to put her
[1:18:10] away privately but the angel came in a
[1:18:13] dream and said you take Mary to be your
[1:18:15] wife what's conceived in her is of the
[1:18:18] Holy Ghost so that was personal
[1:18:21] guidance again in chapter 2 in a dream
[1:18:25] to Joseph once again letting him know
[1:18:28] that it was safe to go back to Israel
[1:18:30] from the land of Egypt they had escaped
[1:18:33] to Egypt because of what Herod wanted to
[1:18:35] do to the young child Jesus then in Luke
[1:18:39] 2: 8-12 the Angels Came to the Shepherds
[1:18:43] concerning the birth of
[1:18:47] Yeshua now this is one of
[1:18:51] those that
[1:18:54] I'm not saying yay I'm not saying nay I
[1:18:57] don't really know but I want you to
[1:19:00] think about the this that it doesn't say
[1:19:04] that they saw them it doesn't say that
[1:19:08] they encountered them it says they the
[1:19:11] Angels Came to them but yet did they
[1:19:15] actually see them I don't
[1:19:20] know and I'm only saying I'm only
[1:19:23] emphasizing that point because I believe
[1:19:26] that there are angels that come to
[1:19:28] assist
[1:19:30] us that we don't see them we don't feel
[1:19:35] them we don't perceive them per se in in
[1:19:39] a form of a of a light but yet they come
[1:19:42] to us and we know that something has
[1:19:47] shifted and as the Angels Came to these
[1:19:51] Shepherds something something happened
[1:19:54] yes that caus them they must have heard
[1:19:58] a voice
[1:19:59] somehow that caus them to get up and
[1:20:04] move then we talked about uh the angels
[1:20:07] as a personal guide and we talked about
[1:20:11] lot Genesis chap 19: 15-1 17 the angel
[1:20:17] actually got a hold of lot and said
[1:20:19] let's
[1:20:21] go we can't wait around something is
[1:20:24] about to happen to this city and you
[1:20:26] can't stay here and he grabbed him and
[1:20:28] moved him so not just as personal
[1:20:31] guidance but now as his personal guide
[1:20:34] with his hand on him saying let's
[1:20:37] move sometimes there's that expedience
[1:20:40] that we've got to move and we we though
[1:20:44] we may not see an angel again but we
[1:20:46] feel something pressing us something
[1:20:49] moving us and we must move when the
[1:20:51] spirit of the Lord says move and we just
[1:20:54] want to be in in a place where that we
[1:20:57] can uh
[1:20:59] recognize that God is doing something on
[1:21:02] our behalf and that when he wants us to
[1:21:05] move we better
[1:21:08] move how can I see an angel how can I
[1:21:11] feel an angel how can I know that angels
[1:21:14] are
[1:21:16] around the simplest answer that I could
[1:21:19] give to us would be stay in the spirit
[1:21:22] yes yeah that's a good
[1:21:24] one we get so caught up in Natural Life
[1:21:30] natural happenings
[1:21:32] natural watching the news and being
[1:21:35] caught up in the news can cause us to be
[1:21:38] so focused on what is happening in the
[1:21:41] world around us the the natural world
[1:21:44] around us that we forget about that
[1:21:46] spirit world that is all around us that
[1:21:50] is here to assist us when all of the
[1:21:53] world is blowing
[1:21:57] up and the world is blowing
[1:22:00] up wars and rumors of wars everywhere
[1:22:05] wars and rumors of wars and about the
[1:22:07] time that you think something is over
[1:22:09] with it escalates
[1:22:13] again
[1:22:15] it's it's a crazy thing that we're
[1:22:18] watching that's true yet the Angels From
[1:22:24] Another realm Are Watching Over The
[1:22:28] Heirs of eternal
[1:22:30] life they're watching over the Airs of
[1:22:33] eternal life to make sure that you make
[1:22:35] it all the way through that's right you
[1:22:37] don't have to worry little bride that
[1:22:39] you're going to fall and fail along the
[1:22:42] way there is already the the the end is
[1:22:46] already determined for you and for me
[1:22:49] and God has given this Angelic activity
[1:22:52] to help help us along the way and we
[1:22:54] don't have to settle for what the world
[1:22:56] settles for we can take a hold of the
[1:22:59] promises of God every promise in him is
[1:23:03] yes and
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:07] right then we look
[1:23:09] at Angelic protection Daniel
[1:23:14] 6:22 Daniel told the king that an angel
[1:23:16] had come to shut the mouths of the Lions
[1:23:20] oh what protection God gave to him I
[1:23:23] like now as we go along there's probably
[1:23:26] going to be there will probably be
[1:23:28] scripture this is not an exhaustive
[1:23:31] research that I'm giving you there'll
[1:23:33] probably be scriptures that come to you
[1:23:36] uh concerning how that God helped his
[1:23:39] people along the way and I tried to only
[1:23:42] use those where it specifically talked
[1:23:44] about an angel or the angel of the Lord
[1:23:48] so we have Daniel of course the angel
[1:23:52] shut the the mouths of the Lions and
[1:23:53] then we go to the scripture in Psalm 91:
[1:23:57] 11 and 12 for he shall give his CH
[1:24:00] Angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[1:24:04] all thy ways they shall bear thee up in
[1:24:07] their hands lest thou Dash thy foot
[1:24:10] against a
[1:24:12] stone now this is a scripture
[1:24:16] that the devil
[1:24:19] used in the Temptation Of The Lord Jesus
[1:24:23] Christ tried to get him to do something
[1:24:28] out of timing tried to get him to uh let
[1:24:32] pride get in the way and this was what
[1:24:35] the enemy used but this is also
[1:24:38] scripture that we as the people of God
[1:24:40] are able to take that there are angels
[1:24:43] that have charge over us to help to keep
[1:24:47] us in the
[1:24:49] way I just want to tell you if angels
[1:24:53] could be in charge to keep balum in the
[1:24:59] way then as a Believer I believe God can
[1:25:03] give angels to keep me in the
[1:25:07] way deliverance from our enemies Acts 5:
[1:25:12] 19 the apostles were imprison for
[1:25:15] preaching but they were released by
[1:25:17] angels and then again in Acts chapter 12
[1:25:20] specifically Peter was released from
[1:25:23] prison by the angels and as we said on
[1:25:26] Tuesday night he didn't believe it he he
[1:25:29] was he was in a state
[1:25:31] of discouragement I don't know but he
[1:25:35] didn't believe that he could be released
[1:25:37] the angel had to help him out a little
[1:25:39] bitl and the people over there praying
[1:25:42] for his release when Roa came to the
[1:25:44] door she wasn't so sure about it
[1:25:47] neither but the angel delivered Peter
[1:25:50] out of the prison God
[1:25:52] yes encouraging and
[1:25:55] strengthening Genesis chap
[1:25:58] 32 we see that Jacob uh had just dealt
[1:26:01] with leaving laan his father-in-law and
[1:26:03] he was about to meet Esau his estranged
[1:26:06] brother and the angels came to him to
[1:26:09] strengthen him to help him in this uh
[1:26:12] very pivotal time in his life the Angels
[1:26:15] ascending and descending they were they
[1:26:17] were there to help him uh in his time of
[1:26:21] difficulty when he was
[1:26:30] scared I hope none of you have a
[1:26:33] father-in-law that wants to take
[1:26:35] everything that you've ever worked
[1:26:38] for and then chase you down when you
[1:26:40] decide to
[1:26:44] leave I hope you've never had an
[1:26:47] estrangement from your brother or sister
[1:26:49] like Jacob had you might say well Jacob
[1:26:53] brought that on
[1:26:55] himself but there was already a
[1:26:58] predetermined outcome to those two young
[1:27:01] men God had a hand in it that's true but
[1:27:05] it did not keep Jacob from being afraid
[1:27:07] that's of the unknown that's where Jacob
[1:27:11] was he was afraid of the
[1:27:13] unknown and we get in that place a whole
[1:27:16] lot of time we're afraid of the unknown
[1:27:19] it keeps us from moving out and doing
[1:27:21] what God want wants us to do because
[1:27:23] we're afraid of what might we might
[1:27:26] encounter what kind of uh Darkness we
[1:27:30] may encounter and as we said on Tuesday
[1:27:33] night when we are talking about the
[1:27:35] spirit realm we're going to encounter
[1:27:38] darkness and we're going to encounter
[1:27:41] light we really don't want the darkness
[1:27:44] but friends darkness is encroaching on
[1:27:47] us every
[1:27:49] day we may not attribute it in our in
[1:27:53] our Humanity we may not attribute it to
[1:27:56] demon
[1:27:57] spirits but demon Spirits are at work in
[1:28:01] the world and they're pressing in on us
[1:28:05] yes and we discount that it is Spirits
[1:28:09] in we just say oh it's a part of life
[1:28:12] but really demon Spirits are pressing in
[1:28:16] on us from every side to try to make us
[1:28:20] trip to Fair fa to trespass against the
[1:28:24] Lord in some way he cannot take away my
[1:28:28] salvation but he's still out to trip me
[1:28:32] up is demon Spirits behind
[1:28:39] it we call them demon
[1:28:45] spirits but they're really Dark
[1:28:51] Angels
[1:28:52] trying to
[1:28:54] destroy the enemy comes to
[1:28:57] steal to kill and
[1:29:01] destroy he wants to steal your Victory
[1:29:05] he wants to steal your joy of your
[1:29:09] salvation he wants to steal the progress
[1:29:12] that you've made in the Lord Jesus
[1:29:14] Christ he wants to kill your influence
[1:29:18] he wants to kill any words that you
[1:29:20] speak that have life to them he wants to
[1:29:24] destroy you he wants to destroy your
[1:29:27] children he wants to destroy your
[1:29:30] influence he wants to destroy your
[1:29:34] testimony steal kill and destroy that's
[1:29:38] what he wants to do but Jesus said I
[1:29:41] have come that you might have life and
[1:29:44] that you might have it more
[1:29:47] abundantly and he gave an Angelic host
[1:29:50] on the lights side to help to assist us
[1:29:55] in fighting the Angelic forces of the
[1:29:58] dark side the demon spirits that are
[1:30:01] trying to steal and kill and
[1:30:05] destroy amen constantly that's it we're
[1:30:09] they're pressing in on us that's right
[1:30:12] and we need to take the authority that
[1:30:14] we have as HS of Salvation and tell
[1:30:19] demon spirits to back up yes back up in
[1:30:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:30:27] invite the Angelic host from the Throne
[1:30:30] of God that has been already uh
[1:30:34] predetermined to help me in this
[1:30:37] instance in my
[1:30:39] life so Jacob was in that place where he
[1:30:43] just didn't know what to do about
[1:30:45] tomorrow right what is Esau going to
[1:30:48] think of me what is is he coming with
[1:30:51] sword
[1:30:52] is he coming with an army is he going to
[1:30:54] cut my head off and leave my children
[1:30:56] fatherless and my wives widows is that
[1:30:59] what is going to happen it's all that
[1:31:01] fear of the unknown I don't know what
[1:31:05] tomorrow holds but if I'll hold to the
[1:31:07] hand of the Lord Jesus Christ I know
[1:31:11] that I'll be all right and that he'll
[1:31:13] take me all the way through it's brother
[1:31:16] Cade sang here last Sunday morning
[1:31:18] something keeps holding
[1:31:20] me
[1:31:24] Hallelujah encouraging and strengthening
[1:31:27] Acts chapter 27 Paul was told by an
[1:31:30] Angel that shipwreck was going to happen
[1:31:31] but there would be no loss of
[1:31:34] life judges chap 6 verse 12 to Gideon he
[1:31:38] tells him that he was a mighty man of
[1:31:40] Valor
[1:31:44] Hallelujah we find ourselves in Gideon's
[1:31:48] position oh yes many days of our life
[1:31:54] we find ourself in
[1:31:56] Gideon's
[1:31:57] condition many days when we're ready to
[1:32:00] step into the
[1:32:03] pulpit when we're ready to step in to
[1:32:06] preach or to sing or to sing a special
[1:32:09] or to do anything that God has called us
[1:32:12] to do the enemy wants to push us back in
[1:32:14] a corner and make us
[1:32:17] hide yet God has a different word for
[1:32:22] us and he calls us Mighty Men of Valor
[1:32:26] Mighty women of Valor somebody who has
[1:32:30] already been put had a garment placed
[1:32:33] upon them the Robes of his righteousness
[1:32:36] that we can wear by grace and we don't
[1:32:39] have to hide from the enemy we don't
[1:32:42] have to hide from the dark Spirits we
[1:32:45] don't have to hide behind the wine press
[1:32:47] in the threshing floor or anywhere else
[1:32:50] we can get up and be about the father's
[1:32:52] business because there's an Angelic host
[1:32:56] come to us and already pronounced to us
[1:32:59] Mighty Men of Valor get about doing the
[1:33:02] Lord's
[1:33:04] work then again strengthening Luke
[1:33:07] chapter 22 verse 43 to Jesus in
[1:33:10] Gethsemane an angel appeared unto him
[1:33:13] from Heaven strengthening
[1:33:19] him if you think about where Jesus
[1:33:24] was the proximity of time that was left
[1:33:27] before he would be taken to the
[1:33:31] Cross he knew it was
[1:33:34] coming he tried telling the disciples
[1:33:37] that it was coming and they really
[1:33:39] didn't want to hear it they wanted him
[1:33:42] to stick around and live his life with
[1:33:44] them and be their Po and just walk
[1:33:46] beside of them and he said if I don't go
[1:33:49] away I can't send the comforter
[1:33:52] and he explained to them I've got to go
[1:33:54] and I I must do this he had to do it for
[1:33:57] my salvation for your salvation for your
[1:34:00] healing and my healing for my peace of
[1:34:03] mind and your peace of mind for your
[1:34:06] broken spirit and my broken Spirit he
[1:34:09] had to go all the way to Calvary but
[1:34:12] there he was in Gethsemane and he's he's
[1:34:15] praying and it says he was sweating as
[1:34:17] it were drops of blood and the angels
[1:34:21] came to him angel came and strengthened
[1:34:24] him to help him to get all the way
[1:34:28] through to the
[1:34:32] Cross if he' had stopped at Gethsemane
[1:34:34] that would not have been
[1:34:37] enough if he had got as far as being
[1:34:41] questioned in pilate's judgment Hall
[1:34:45] would not have been enough he had to go
[1:34:48] all the way to Calvary and not just to
[1:34:51] Calvary
[1:34:52] that wasn't enough either he had to be
[1:34:54] placed in a tomb and he had to go to
[1:34:56] hell and he had to take the keys of
[1:34:58] death and hell and the grave and he had
[1:35:00] to come up out of the Tomb
[1:35:03] resurrected first
[1:35:06] fruits to know that when we lay someone
[1:35:10] in the grave that is not the end of it
[1:35:13] there is a resurrection friends and
[1:35:16] Jesus had to have an angel come and
[1:35:18] strengthen him to get him all the way
[1:35:21] through that's
[1:35:23] true then we go to the provision of food
[1:35:27] First Kings chapter 19 Elijah after his
[1:35:30] great victory over the prophets of Baal
[1:35:32] and he hears that Jezebel is after him
[1:35:34] he runs and hides here
[1:35:37] again now with Gideon the angel came and
[1:35:41] told him you're mighty man of
[1:35:46] Valor when Elijah ran and
[1:35:49] hid Angel didn't come and say you're a
[1:35:52] mighty man of
[1:35:56] Valor he came and he fed
[1:36:00] him and then he came and fed him
[1:36:04] again and then gave him further
[1:36:07] instruction and told him that he needed
[1:36:10] to go and anoint this one to be king and
[1:36:13] this one to be king and this one to be
[1:36:14] prophet in his dead his his his part was
[1:36:17] over
[1:36:19] with he was he he was coming down to the
[1:36:23] end of his time yes sir and it was going
[1:36:25] to be a change of
[1:36:29] season with Kings and with prophets
[1:36:33] there was a change of season about to
[1:36:35] happen but Elijah was in this place
[1:36:38] where he had run and he hid because he
[1:36:41] had been through such a battle but God
[1:36:44] was faithful to Elijah and brought him
[1:36:47] food when he needed food the Lord knew
[1:36:50] that Elijah needed physical strength
[1:36:54] from food prise the
[1:36:56] Lord he' been running a long
[1:36:59] time God provided food and we can take
[1:37:03] this same provision by the angels to
[1:37:07] Elijah and we can take it for ourselves
[1:37:10] to know that when things get tough
[1:37:12] around us that God still provides for
[1:37:16] his own he will provide what is needed
[1:37:20] at the time
[1:37:21] that we are in need
[1:37:24] Hallelujah God knows how to bring food
[1:37:28] by
[1:37:30] Angels so let's just look for a few
[1:37:32] minutes at some of the Angels
[1:37:35] characteristics I told you they have
[1:37:38] intellect Matthew chapter 28 the angel
[1:37:41] answered and said fear not I know that
[1:37:44] you seek Jesus who is crucified he is
[1:37:47] not here he is risen as he said come
[1:37:51] come see the place where
[1:37:54] Jesus
[1:38:00] led so we see that they knew things that
[1:38:05] they could convey to someone
[1:38:08] else angels are not
[1:38:11] idiots they don't come to you with
[1:38:14] useless
[1:38:16] information they come from the presence
[1:38:19] of the Lord to bring to us things that
[1:38:22] we need to know at a certain time to
[1:38:25] help us make it
[1:38:27] through then we can see in First Peter
[1:38:31] 1:2 unto whom it was revealed that not
[1:38:34] unto themselves but unto us they did
[1:38:36] Minister the things which are now
[1:38:38] reported unto you by them that have
[1:38:40] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:38:43] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[1:38:46] things the Angels desire to look into
[1:38:50] now we told you on Tuesday night the
[1:38:52] angels are looking in at us because they
[1:38:55] want to know what's going on with us yes
[1:38:59] the angels are interested in you they
[1:39:02] are they want to know about your
[1:39:04] well-being they want to know especially
[1:39:07] about your spiritual well-being and they
[1:39:09] really want to know what you know right
[1:39:13] and so they have
[1:39:15] intellect they have
[1:39:18] emotions the scriptures job 38:7 Luke
[1:39:23] 213 Luke
[1:39:25] 15:10 onto they have a will I'm going to
[1:39:28] move just a little bit quicker Jude
[1:39:31] chapter 6 The Angels which kept not
[1:39:33] their first estate but left their own
[1:39:36] habitation he hath reserved in
[1:39:38] Everlasting chains unto Darkness unto
[1:39:41] the Judgment of the great
[1:39:44] day angels are Spirit beings they're not
[1:39:48] limited to material bodies they're
[1:39:51] ministering Spirits again sometimes they
[1:39:54] show up as a human being what looks like
[1:39:58] a human being be careful not to
[1:40:01] entertain Angels unawares so they are
[1:40:05] Spirit
[1:40:08] beings sometimes they appear as we read
[1:40:11] a while ago concerning Joseph they
[1:40:14] appear sometimes they are with human
[1:40:17] function as in a dream they come to us
[1:40:20] in dreams dreams uh which is a human
[1:40:23] function for us God gave us
[1:40:27] dreams uh there are many times perhaps
[1:40:30] that we have dreams that disturb us we
[1:40:36] really need to sanctify our minds ask
[1:40:38] the Lord to sanctify our dreams so that
[1:40:41] when we are dreaming it allows if the
[1:40:44] Lord so desires to send an angel in our
[1:40:47] dream that we are able to receive that
[1:40:52] uh and and that we're not so caught up
[1:40:55] in the world so caught up in uh all the
[1:40:59] Temptations of life that we have dreams
[1:41:04] that are
[1:41:06] unsanctified sometimes they're seen by
[1:41:08] some and not others Genesis Chapter 18
[1:41:12] The Three Angels one stayed with Abraham
[1:41:15] two went to Sodom some folks saw them
[1:41:18] some were
[1:41:19] blinded and then we gave the more
[1:41:22] specific one in 2 Kings 6:1
[1:41:26] 15-17 where that Elisha and his servant
[1:41:30] uh were together and all the that the
[1:41:32] servant could see was that they were
[1:41:34] surrounded by the
[1:41:37] enemy oh
[1:41:41] yeah that's the way the enemy wants it
[1:41:43] to
[1:41:44] be he wants you to think you're
[1:41:47] constantly surrounded by enemy
[1:41:49] forces
[1:41:51] yet God wants you to know that you are
[1:41:55] surrounded by a host of angels an
[1:41:59] increase in Angelic activity he come he
[1:42:02] came to remind us and I'm here again
[1:42:05] today to remind you that there's an
[1:42:08] increase in the Angelic activity and we
[1:42:11] want to be able to see them to know that
[1:42:14] they're that there are more of them than
[1:42:17] there are of demonic
[1:42:19] forces
[1:42:27] more of
[1:42:29] them than of demonic
[1:42:32] forces I just remind you that when
[1:42:39] Lucifer was cast out he only took
[1:42:43] onethird that meant
[1:42:45] 2/3 were still on the light
[1:42:49] side and so so if you can't see them if
[1:42:54] your eyes are not open to them and you
[1:42:57] feel like that you are being pressed
[1:42:59] upon by more demonic forces than good
[1:43:02] forces may you be reminded that he only
[1:43:06] has one third as many as God has and God
[1:43:09] has
[1:43:12] two3 all right we don't always get to
[1:43:16] see them sometimes our eyes are opened
[1:43:19] as the Elisha asked the Lord to Open the
[1:43:22] Eyes of the servant so that he could see
[1:43:24] the Heavenly
[1:43:25] Host Mark
[1:43:28] 12:25 this one We Gather from it that
[1:43:30] they don't reproduce for when they shall
[1:43:32] rise from the dead talking about humans
[1:43:34] they shall neither marry nor are given
[1:43:36] in marriage but are as the Angels which
[1:43:38] are in
[1:43:39] heaven Luke 20:36 they don't die again
[1:43:43] talking about humans neither can they
[1:43:45] die anymore for they are equal unto the
[1:43:47] angels and are the children of God being
[1:43:50] the children children of Resurrection
[1:43:51] from these verses we see that they don't
[1:43:54] reproduce and that they don't die the
[1:43:57] ninth one they have a physical reality
[1:43:59] as when I told you that the Angels laid
[1:44:01] their hands on lot and his family with
[1:44:04] an urgency to get out of Sodom they
[1:44:07] engage in
[1:44:09] combat second Kings chapter
[1:44:13] 19:35 it came to pass that night that
[1:44:16] the angel of the Lord went out and
[1:44:18] smokee in the camp of the Assyrian
[1:44:21] and4 score and 5,000 and when they arose
[1:44:26] early in the morning behold they were
[1:44:28] all dead
[1:44:32] corpses God shall fight for
[1:44:35] you he shall fight for
[1:44:39] you does that mean you're going to be
[1:44:41] lazy I hope not we've got to be active
[1:44:46] alert active alert active alert this is
[1:44:50] is not a time for us to be where that we
[1:44:54] uh uh are are finding ourselves in a
[1:44:57] place of sleep we have to be alert and
[1:45:00] we have to be active about the things of
[1:45:02] God and allow the Holy Spirit to work in
[1:45:05] us and such a way that we are
[1:45:08] cooperating with the Angelic
[1:45:12] host I've already alluded to this one
[1:45:15] Hebrews 13:2 they can be mistaken as
[1:45:17] people and entertained unawares be not
[1:45:21] forgetful to entertain strangers thereby
[1:45:24] some have entertained angels
[1:45:27] unawares they have more knowledge than
[1:45:29] man but less than God and I give a
[1:45:32] scripture Matthew 24
[1:45:36] 31-36 and also Luke
[1:45:40] 13-16 the Angels knew things that human
[1:45:44] beings did not know they came to reveal
[1:45:46] that to them but that did not make them
[1:45:49] higher than uh Papa God they have more
[1:45:53] power than man but less than God and
[1:45:56] again I gave you Acts chapter 5: 19 and
[1:46:00] 2 Peter 2 verse
[1:46:04] 11 and we see that they have power uh
[1:46:08] more than man can do but again they're
[1:46:11] not above what God allows them to
[1:46:15] do then I gave you several instances
[1:46:18] where the scripture specifically uses
[1:46:20] the phrase the angel of the
[1:46:26] Lord I gave you concerning Hagar in
[1:46:29] Genesis chapter
[1:46:31] 16 then when the angel of the Lord came
[1:46:35] to Abraham in Genesis 18 we find this a
[1:46:39] preist visitation to the Earth Genesis
[1:46:43] CH 22 to Abraham only this time the
[1:46:47] angel of the Lord called from heaven
[1:46:49] right this was not the angel beside him
[1:46:53] on the earth the angel called from
[1:46:55] heaven now this is one of those
[1:46:57] instances my mind wonders did a Abraham
[1:47:01] see the
[1:47:03] angel or did he only hear the angel I
[1:47:06] don't know it does not specifically say
[1:47:10] Genesis chapter 31 the angel spoke to
[1:47:13] Jacob in a dream and he said I am the
[1:47:15] god of bethl and I I just made a note
[1:47:19] I'm the god of the house of the go of
[1:47:22] God he's still god of the house of
[1:47:26] God he appeared to Moses in Exodus 3: 6
[1:47:32] in the flame of a burning
[1:47:35] bush and I gave a scripture John 8:58
[1:47:40] where Jesus identified himself as the I
[1:47:42] am the one in the burning bush then he
[1:47:45] appeared to Israel as a nation at the
[1:47:47] Red Sea as a pillar of clouds
[1:47:51] Exodus 14:19 the angel of God which went
[1:47:55] before the camp of Israel removed and
[1:47:58] went behind them and the pillar of cloud
[1:48:01] went from before their face and stood
[1:48:03] behind
[1:48:05] them now I would like to mention that
[1:48:08] brother brandham repeatedly uh uses
[1:48:12] Exodus 23: 20 through 23 and he
[1:48:16] repeatedly calls him the angel of the
[1:48:18] Covenant behold behold I sent an angel
[1:48:21] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[1:48:23] to bring thee into the place which I
[1:48:25] have
[1:48:26] prepared beware of him and obey his
[1:48:30] voice provoke him not for he will not
[1:48:33] pardon your transgressions for my name
[1:48:35] is in him but if thou will indeed obey
[1:48:38] his voice and do all that I speak then I
[1:48:41] will be an enemy to your enemies and an
[1:48:44] adversary to your adversaries for mine
[1:48:47] Angel shall go before thee and bring
[1:48:49] thee into the in unto the amorites the
[1:48:54] Hittites the perizzites the Canaanites
[1:48:57] the hivites and the jebusites and I will
[1:49:01] cut them off now I take this scripture
[1:49:04] for
[1:49:06] myself because although I may not
[1:49:10] see something that I
[1:49:13] would would have the name Amorite
[1:49:15] hittite perizzite Canaanite hivite
[1:49:17] jebusite the spirits of every one of
[1:49:20] these
[1:49:21] IES continue to this
[1:49:25] day the spirits that They Carried are
[1:49:28] still in the Earth today and I am still
[1:49:31] having as a Believer I am still having
[1:49:33] to fight them you are having to fight
[1:49:36] them but if I will keep Covenant with
[1:49:39] the angel of the Covenant and I will
[1:49:41] beware of him and obey his voice and
[1:49:44] provoke him
[1:49:46] not then I can be sure that he's going
[1:49:50] to show up yes and he's going to cut off
[1:49:53] praise
[1:49:55] God how will he cut him
[1:49:58] off well I cooperate with him by the
[1:50:02] preaching of the word I cooperate with
[1:50:05] this Angel of the Covenant when he comes
[1:50:08] by the word and I am it is revealed to
[1:50:11] me that there are Hees in my life that
[1:50:14] need to be cut off and I cooperate with
[1:50:17] him to allow him to cut them off he will
[1:50:19] cut them off oh yes there are some that
[1:50:24] I cooperate one time and they're gone
[1:50:28] and there are other times where I have
[1:50:30] to cooperate time and time and time and
[1:50:33] time and time again because it has a
[1:50:35] bigger hook in me than other things and
[1:50:38] I have to continue to cooperate with the
[1:50:41] angel of the Covenant because he is
[1:50:43] continuing to work to get all of the
[1:50:46] tentacles of that thing that have hooks
[1:50:49] in me he is coming by his spirit and by
[1:50:52] the word of God to cut the tentacles of
[1:50:55] that thing out of my life praise the
[1:50:57] Lord because they got hooks Hallelujah
[1:51:00] in
[1:51:01] me some things have more hooks than
[1:51:04] others because of how long they've been
[1:51:06] allowed to linger in our lives how long
[1:51:09] we've cooperated with them in our lives
[1:51:12] and the Holy Spirit has to come by his
[1:51:14] word and Time After Time After Time he
[1:51:16] has to come and cut them out of our
[1:51:18] Lives because that they're so
[1:51:21] incredibly hooked to us but we want all
[1:51:25] the hooks out of our Lives all of them
[1:51:29] I'm constantly praying God I don't want
[1:51:31] that to have a hook in me I don't want
[1:51:33] it to be a part of my life I want only
[1:51:36] the word of God to be who I
[1:51:39] am all right then he came to balum the
[1:51:43] angel of the Lord now remember I told
[1:51:45] you first of all the donkey saw him the
[1:51:48] angel of the Lord
[1:51:52] balum was so
[1:51:55] intent on
[1:52:00] money a meal ticket he was so intent on
[1:52:04] it till that he only had one thing in
[1:52:07] his mind and that was to go to curse the
[1:52:09] children of
[1:52:13] Israel but the donkey saw the angel of
[1:52:17] the Lord and finally balum
[1:52:21] saw the angel of the Lord as well and
[1:52:25] when balum saw the angel of the Lord his
[1:52:29] attitude was quickly
[1:52:32] changed you can read that in Numbers
[1:52:34] chapter 22: 22-
[1:52:37] 27 he came to Joshua in Joshua 5:13 he
[1:52:42] came as the captain of the host he
[1:52:45] appeared as a
[1:52:46] man when he came to Gideon the the angel
[1:52:50] of the Lord called Gideon a mighty man
[1:52:54] of Valor he appeared to
[1:52:57] him what he looked like or in what form
[1:53:00] Gideon saw him I do not know but he
[1:53:03] appeared to him he came to Samson's
[1:53:06] mother the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:53:09] her and recognized her barrenness and
[1:53:12] again the angel of the Lord came back so
[1:53:14] that uh manoah could see him as well the
[1:53:18] angel of the Lord came to Phillip in
[1:53:21] Acts 8:
[1:53:24] 26-30 and the angel of the Lord spake to
[1:53:28] Phillip saying arise and go toward the
[1:53:31] South unto the way that goeth down from
[1:53:35] Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert
[1:53:39] where they're fighting right
[1:53:41] now he arose and went and behold a man
[1:53:44] of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority
[1:53:47] Under Candice Queen of the Ethiopians
[1:53:49] who had the charge of all her treasure
[1:53:51] and had come to Jerusalem for to worship
[1:53:54] was returning and sitting in his Chariot
[1:53:57] reading Isaiah the prophet then the
[1:54:00] spirit said unto Phillip go near and
[1:54:02] join yourself to this Chariot and Philip
[1:54:05] ran thither to him and heard him read
[1:54:08] the prophet isaas and said understandest
[1:54:12] thou what thou readest so Phillip the
[1:54:16] angel of the Lord spoke to Phillip and
[1:54:18] gave him instru ruction and in in so
[1:54:22] being obedient to what the angel told
[1:54:24] him to do then Phillip was able to
[1:54:27] impart
[1:54:29] Revelation to this Ethiopian
[1:54:33] unic so then we go on to talk about how
[1:54:36] that angels are organized and ranked and
[1:54:39] and I am not smart enough to to really
[1:54:44] give you all that I would like to be
[1:54:46] able to give you but we know that there
[1:54:48] are Min Min ministering
[1:54:51] spirits that are a part of the Angelic
[1:54:54] hosts that come to us they're actually
[1:54:56] all of them are ministering spirits but
[1:55:00] Michael is not going to come to you
[1:55:02] every time Gabriel is not going to come
[1:55:03] to you every time the four living
[1:55:05] creatures are not going to come to you
[1:55:07] every time and I don't want to call them
[1:55:09] lesser Angels but I guess that's what
[1:55:11] they are I don't really know but they're
[1:55:13] they're they are in ranks so we have
[1:55:15] ministering Spirits we have Michael who
[1:55:18] is an archangel and and he's a chief
[1:55:20] leader and he contended with the devil
[1:55:24] disputing about the body of Moses and we
[1:55:27] also see Michael in Daniel chapter 10
[1:55:30] and in Revelation
[1:55:36] 12 then we see
[1:55:39] Gabriel and we find him in Luke chap
[1:55:43] 1 and first of all he speaks to
[1:55:46] zecharias concerning the conception and
[1:55:48] the birth of John the baptizer and then
[1:55:51] he speaks to Mary concerning the
[1:55:53] conception and the birth of
[1:55:56] Jesus then he also talks in Daniel
[1:55:59] chapter 8 and chapter n to Daniel in
[1:56:02] chapter 8 cons helping Daniel to
[1:56:05] understand concerning goat Nations and
[1:56:07] then in jiel Daniel chapter 9 concerning
[1:56:10] the 70 weeks that are determined upon
[1:56:12] Daniel's
[1:56:14] people then we come to
[1:56:17] cherubim we hear so often about the
[1:56:20] Cherry beam that are that was put at the
[1:56:25] uh east of the Garden of Eden the
[1:56:28] Flaming sword which turn every way to
[1:56:31] keep the way to the tree of life then we
[1:56:35] see it also uh as as Moses was trying to
[1:56:40] bring into the Earth what he saw in the
[1:56:44] Heavenly realm uh Exodus 25:19 he was
[1:56:47] told to make one cherub on one end and
[1:56:50] the other cherub on the other end even
[1:56:53] of The Mercy Seat shall you make cherry
[1:56:55] Beam on the two ends thereof now once
[1:56:58] again I'm going to repeat what brother
[1:56:59] Shelley so often says cherubs are not I
[1:57:04] should say Cher beam are not little fat
[1:57:08] babies with a
[1:57:11] diaper Angels at all are not fat little
[1:57:17] babies with diapers that's right
[1:57:21] angels are
[1:57:24] warriors they're
[1:57:27] constantly fighting against demonic
[1:57:31] forces yes they are warriors to help to
[1:57:36] drive back demonic forces and again we
[1:57:40] keep uh we cooperate with
[1:57:43] them then we find in Ezekiel chap 10 and
[1:57:47] I would like to read verses 18 through
[1:57:49] 22 so that we can understand about the
[1:57:52] Cherub beam then the glory of the Lord
[1:57:54] departed from off the threshold of the
[1:57:56] house and stood over the Cherry beam the
[1:58:00] Cherry beam lift up their wings and
[1:58:01] mounted up from the earth in my sight
[1:58:04] when they went out the wheels also were
[1:58:07] beside them and everyone stood at the
[1:58:10] door of the East Gate of the Lord's
[1:58:12] House and the glory of the Lord of
[1:58:14] Israel was over them Above This is the
[1:58:18] living creature that I saw under the god
[1:58:21] of Israel by the river cabar and I knew
[1:58:25] that they were the Cherub
[1:58:27] beam everyone had four faces a piece and
[1:58:35] everyone four
[1:58:37] wings and the likeness of the hands of a
[1:58:42] man was under their
[1:58:46] wings and the likeness of their faces
[1:58:48] was the the same faces which I saw by
[1:58:51] the river of kabar their appearances and
[1:58:54] themselves they went everyone straight
[1:58:56] forward
[1:58:58] now just so you know what he saw
[1:59:01] concerning their faces was the
[1:59:03] same as John saw in the Book of
[1:59:07] Revelation where that it was the face of
[1:59:10] an ox the face of a man the face of a
[1:59:14] calf and the
[1:59:18] eagle we'll get that in just a minute uh
[1:59:21] if I've got that
[1:59:23] wrong we know that in Luke chap 28
[1:59:26] Lucifer who was the anointed cherub that
[1:59:29] coverthe was carried away on a power
[1:59:31] trip uh you can find that in Ezekiel
[1:59:34] chapter
[1:59:35] 28 now I want
[1:59:37] to I I I've got to look in at the word
[1:59:44] seraphim and the seraphim the the four
[1:59:47] living creatures we find that sarap is
[1:59:51] the singular seraphim is the plural and
[1:59:55] the word sarap which is the singular
[1:59:58] word is the meaning that strongs gives
[2:00:02] is serpent or fiery serpent found this
[2:00:07] very
[2:00:08] interesting and that was definition
[2:00:12] number one definition number two was
[2:00:14] sarap or
[2:00:16] seraphim and that word seraphim is taken
[2:00:20] from the Hebrew word
[2:00:22] 8313
[2:00:24] sarf meaning to burn or to set on
[2:00:30] fire now I want you to realize that this
[2:00:34] is the same word that is used in numbers
[2:00:39] 21 when the Lord sent fiery
[2:00:42] serpents through the
[2:00:47] camp when the people spoke against God
[2:00:50] and against his servant Moses God sent
[2:00:54] fiery serpents through the camp these
[2:00:58] serpents were biting the
[2:01:00] people then the remedy for that was
[2:01:03] Moses was to take and build this fiery
[2:01:07] Serpent and put it on a pole and all the
[2:01:11] people had to do for their Deliverance
[2:01:13] was to look and they would
[2:01:18] live
[2:01:20] we read about the seraphim in Isaiah
[2:01:23] chapter 6 and the reason that I brought
[2:01:25] in concerning the fiery serpent is
[2:01:29] because it will give us more meaning
[2:01:31] when we go to Isaiah chapter 6 in the
[2:01:34] year that King Uzziah died I also saw
[2:01:39] the Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[2:01:41] lifted up and his train filled the
[2:01:44] temple Hallelujah above it stood the
[2:01:48] seraphim each one had six
[2:01:50] wings with Twain he covered his face
[2:01:54] with Twain he covered his feet and with
[2:01:57] TW he did fly I just want you to notice
[2:01:59] the Cherry beam had four wings saraph
[2:02:02] have six wings and one Cried unto
[2:02:06] another and said holy holy holy is the
[2:02:09] Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of
[2:02:12] his glory and the post of the door moved
[2:02:16] at the voice of him that cried and the
[2:02:20] house was filled with smoke then said I
[2:02:24] woe is me for I am undone because I am a
[2:02:28] man of unclean lips and I dwell in the
[2:02:31] midst of unclean PE or people of unclean
[2:02:34] lips for mine eyes have seen the king
[2:02:38] the Lord of
[2:02:39] hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto
[2:02:42] me having a live coal in his hand which
[2:02:48] he had taken en with the tongs from off
[2:02:51] of the altar here we bring in the fire
[2:02:55] right
[2:02:56] right here we bring in the fire that we
[2:02:59] need because we have been a people of
[2:03:03] unclean lips we have had words that have
[2:03:06] come out of our mouth that spewed
[2:03:09] uncleanness and we need the
[2:03:12] seraphim I'm telling you that through
[2:03:16] the prophetic word we have recently
[2:03:18] heard heard that even the even the four
[2:03:21] living creatures were coming to be a
[2:03:24] part of that Angelic host that was come
[2:03:26] to us so we're going to take the Cherub
[2:03:29] beam and we're going to take the
[2:03:31] seraphim and we're going to allow them
[2:03:33] to be a part of our life and the sarapin
[2:03:36] come unto me having a live coal in his
[2:03:39] hand which he had taken with the tongs
[2:03:42] from off the Altar and he laid it upon
[2:03:44] my mouth and said Lo this hath touched
[2:03:48] thy lips and that iniquity is taken away
[2:03:52] and thy sin is
[2:03:55] purged also like to read Revelation 4:
[2:03:59] 6-8 and Before the Throne there was a
[2:04:01] sea of glass like under Crystal and in
[2:04:04] the midst of the throne round about The
[2:04:06] Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[2:04:08] before and
[2:04:09] behind and the first Beast was like a
[2:04:12] lion the second beast like a calf the
[2:04:14] third Beast had face as a man and the
[2:04:17] fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so
[2:04:20] there we have lion
[2:04:23] calf man and flying
[2:04:28] eagle the four beasts had each of them
[2:04:31] six wings about him and they were full
[2:04:34] of eyes within and they rest not day and
[2:04:36] night saying holy holy holy Lord God
[2:04:40] Almighty which was and is and in is to
[2:04:43] come the seraphim that Isaiah saw this
[2:04:47] they were doing the same thing crying
[2:04:50] holy holy holy to the Lord now again uh
[2:04:54] for those of you that were not here the
[2:04:56] book of the the the Book of Revelation
[2:04:58] the New Testament calls them beasts
[2:05:00] these are really the four living
[2:05:02] creatures there are two different words
[2:05:04] for beasts in the New Testament one
[2:05:07] being uh zoon which is the living being
[2:05:11] and then the other word is theion
[2:05:14] meaning a brutal beastial man a Brut of
[2:05:16] savage like the Beast system
[2:05:19] so we uh and I'll skip that last part
[2:05:22] charity uh so we we know that all of
[2:05:26] these have been uh given for us they're
[2:05:32] a part of who we are and we want to be
[2:05:36] able to cooperate with them now I want
[2:05:40] to read two quotes and then I'm going to
[2:05:42] give you a few things of how that I
[2:05:45] think that we can cooperate with the
[2:05:47] angels and how we can
[2:05:49] activate uh Angelic
[2:05:53] activity uh the first one I want to read
[2:05:57] is
[2:06:03] um out of order
[2:06:08] here I am the resurrection and
[2:06:13] life this one's a little bit lengthy but
[2:06:16] there's there's a quotation at the end
[2:06:18] that
[2:06:19] find uh
[2:06:22] amusing at the same time it has depth to
[2:06:26] it now look then Zacharias was a
[2:06:30] righteous man a priest he came to the
[2:06:33] house of God and his
[2:06:35] office was in there to burn incense
[2:06:38] while the people were praying and then
[2:06:40] one day while he was burning incense the
[2:06:43] time of the promise was drawing nigh and
[2:06:45] God sent an angel down to the altar then
[2:06:48] he he asks the congregation do you
[2:06:50] believe in angels they respond that they
[2:06:53] did he says yes sir and then he goes on
[2:06:56] to talk about someone said not long ago
[2:06:59] said brother brandom you're mistaken
[2:07:00] about that man that talks to you said
[2:07:03] that was the Lord I said it was an angel
[2:07:07] he said I am sent from the presence of
[2:07:10] God he wasn't the Lord he was an angel
[2:07:14] oh said that's all mistaken said brother
[2:07:16] brandom God in old times and the Bible
[2:07:19] spake said there was Daniel and all of
[2:07:21] them yeah they were had angels and so
[2:07:24] forth like that but not in the New
[2:07:34] Testament not in the New Testament
[2:07:37] Doctrine and this man was a man said we
[2:07:40] speak where the Bible speaks and Silent
[2:07:42] where the Bible is silent I thought how
[2:07:44] silent he was on many things on the that
[2:07:47] the Bible spoke
[2:07:49] I said do you mean to tell me that you
[2:07:51] don't believe the angels of God the man
[2:07:54] said no sir the Holy Spirit leads the
[2:07:57] church I said that's correctly but they
[2:08:01] have ministering Spirits sent from the
[2:08:03] presence of God he said not in the New
[2:08:06] Testament brother I said oh yes in the
[2:08:09] New Testament he said the Holy Spirit
[2:08:12] Not Angels the Holy Spirit I said look I
[2:08:15] want to ask you something I said it was
[2:08:18] the angel of God who met Mary he said
[2:08:22] yeah but that was before
[2:08:24] Pentecost and said after Pentecost it
[2:08:27] was the Holy Spirit from then on I said
[2:08:30] truly the Holy Spirit leads the church
[2:08:33] that's truth but look I said do you
[2:08:35] believe that Phillip had the baptism of
[2:08:38] the Holy Spirit do you believe it all of
[2:08:40] you sure he did when he went down in
[2:08:43] Samaria holding a RI Revival who was it
[2:08:46] that spoke to him and said go out out
[2:08:48] into the desert Gaza was it the Holy
[2:08:51] Spirit no sir an angel of the Lord spoke
[2:08:55] to him is that right go out to the
[2:08:58] desert Gaza and speak look how many
[2:09:01] believes that Peter had the Holy Spirit
[2:09:05] let's see you believe he had the baptism
[2:09:07] of the Holy Spirit when he was in prison
[2:09:09] that night and down at John Mark's house
[2:09:11] was having a prayer meeting for him who
[2:09:14] was it like the light that shined in the
[2:09:16] window and opened the doors for him was
[2:09:18] it the Holy
[2:09:20] Spirit the angel of the Lord how many
[2:09:24] believes Paul had the Holy Ghost well
[2:09:26] when he was out there on the ship 14
[2:09:28] days and nights no moon stars and all
[2:09:30] hope was gone he went
[2:09:33] down in the galley to pray he come back
[2:09:37] up said have a good courage for the
[2:09:39] angel of God whose servant I am stood by
[2:09:42] me last night said fear not Paul is that
[2:09:45] right the angel of the Lord
[2:09:49] the whole book of Revelations was wrote
[2:09:51] by a witness of an angel I Jesus have
[2:09:54] sent mine Angel to testify of these
[2:09:56] things to write under the church is that
[2:09:59] right John fell down to worship the
[2:10:01] angel the angel said do it not now it's
[2:10:05] not Joseph Smith but he said a true
[2:10:06] Angel won't stand to be worshiped you
[2:10:09] know that no sir he said worship God and
[2:10:13] God still has angels and they visit the
[2:10:16] people not a worship of Angels but
[2:10:19] Angelic beings who are attributes of God
[2:10:22] sent forth to minister to the church
[2:10:25] through the people oh my how short we
[2:10:28] are of the real Apostolic church today
[2:10:32] of the blessing now I want you to listen
[2:10:35] to this quote we people who claim to be
[2:10:39] there who claim to have kissed the
[2:10:42] blessings of the rims of the cup of
[2:10:44] blessing how short we come how we bubble
[2:10:48] dance on top of the suds and know not
[2:10:52] what the bottom is that is true we've
[2:10:56] only touched the surface is what he's
[2:10:59] saying but he had a real way we bubble
[2:11:02] dance on top of the
[2:11:04] suds you get a cup full of something and
[2:11:07] it's got Suds on top of it and that's
[2:11:11] where he says we've been dancing but
[2:11:13] down in that cup there's some real
[2:11:15] substance that we want to get a hold of
[2:11:18] there's substance about the Angelic
[2:11:21] activity that we want to get a hold of
[2:11:24] and we want to cooperate with them we
[2:11:26] want to cooperate with God we want to
[2:11:29] cooperate with his spirit that he sends
[2:11:31] among us we want to cooperate with the
[2:11:34] Angelic activity that has been given to
[2:11:37] us in this end
[2:11:39] time so I have put together a
[2:11:43] couple let me read one more quote that
[2:11:46] brother Shelly read about this time time
[2:11:48] last year I think it's been on my
[2:11:50] refrigerator now for a year this is from
[2:11:54] Revelation book of
[2:11:56] symbols Angelic beings associate
[2:11:59] together oh I hope you get that that
[2:12:02] just dropped right down free look if you
[2:12:05] got the holy spirit in you then you're a
[2:12:07] candidate for association with the
[2:12:10] Unseen World and the supernatural no
[2:12:14] wonder people can't believe in those
[2:12:16] things they've never come in contact
[2:12:19] they got nothing in here to believe with
[2:12:23] but when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[2:12:25] heart quickly he becomes then a two-fold
[2:12:28] being one of this Earth to die and one
[2:12:32] of Heaven to live Amen in his body he's
[2:12:36] still subject to death but in his soul
[2:12:39] he's passed from Death un life hallu in
[2:12:43] his body is he has Earthly contact with
[2:12:46] the five senses but in his Spirit he has
[2:12:49] contact with God through the Holy Ghost
[2:12:53] and the angels of God visits him speaks
[2:12:57] with them their Messengers sent from God
[2:13:00] to reveal and to bring messages from God
[2:13:02] to the individual he's out to get first
[2:13:06] things first you can't put the KOA on
[2:13:09] before the foundation is laid see so we
[2:13:13] got to remember that first things first
[2:13:16] seek first the kingdom of God and his
[2:13:18] righteousness and all these other things
[2:13:21] will be added unto
[2:13:25] you if you have the Holy Ghost you're a
[2:13:29] candidate for association with the
[2:13:32] Unseen World and the
[2:13:34] supernatural so how do I cooperate with
[2:13:37] the angels and what can I do to activate
[2:13:42] Angelic
[2:13:45] activity the first thing that I have put
[2:13:48] down here is
[2:13:52] kindness we have already read Hebrews
[2:13:55] chapter 13 verse 2 be not forgetful to
[2:14:01] entertain strangers for thereby some
[2:14:05] have entertained angels
[2:14:08] unawares if we find ourselves always in
[2:14:12] a bad mood and always being rude to
[2:14:17] people
[2:14:19] and God decides to show up in the form
[2:14:23] of a
[2:14:27] man but as an angel under the layers of
[2:14:31] skin that you see with your natural eye
[2:14:34] but you don't know it and you're just
[2:14:37] rude to
[2:14:40] everybody kindness will help us in
[2:14:44] association with the Angelic
[2:14:46] activity we also see that Abraham in
[2:14:50] chapter 18 of the Book of Genesis when
[2:14:53] the angel the Angels Came to him the the
[2:14:58] the scripture says the Lord appeared
[2:15:00] unto him in the ples of memory and he
[2:15:02] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[2:15:04] day and he lifted up his eyes and looked
[2:15:07] and loow three men stood by him and when
[2:15:11] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[2:15:14] tent door and bowed himself to the
[2:15:17] ground
[2:15:18] there was a kindness in Abraham that he
[2:15:22] wanted to that I think that there was
[2:15:25] something in in Abraham that he
[2:15:28] recognized that this was
[2:15:30] otherworldly but they appeared as
[2:15:34] men and he went to them and he bowed
[2:15:37] down before them and said my Lord if I
[2:15:40] have found favor in your sight pass not
[2:15:43] away I pray thee from thy servants let a
[2:15:45] little water I pray you be fed Ed and
[2:15:48] wash your feet and rest yourself under
[2:15:50] the tree and I'll fetch a morsel of
[2:15:53] bread and comfort your hearts after that
[2:15:55] you can pass on for therefore you're
[2:15:57] come to your servants and they said so
[2:16:00] do as thou Hast said so there was a
[2:16:04] kindness inside of of Abraham that he
[2:16:08] wanted to
[2:16:11] entertain men they look like men but
[2:16:14] there was something inside of Abraham
[2:16:16] that he he recognized maybe that they
[2:16:19] were not from this world but
[2:16:22] he he still offered them natural
[2:16:28] substance he offered to them a pan of
[2:16:31] water to wash their feet because they
[2:16:33] looked like they had been on a
[2:16:35] journey there was kindness to
[2:16:38] him then we there was another thing The
[2:16:45] Obedience how can we activate Angelic
[2:16:48] activity or how can we co cooperate with
[2:16:51] them we can do it through our obedience
[2:16:53] and I gave the scripture that when the
[2:16:56] devil left Jesus behold Angels Came and
[2:16:59] ministered to him I I give this one
[2:17:03] because you recognize that when Jesus
[2:17:06] went into the Wilderness and he was
[2:17:08] tempted all through his
[2:17:11] temptation the Angels were not
[2:17:14] there according to what we read in the
[2:17:17] scripture
[2:17:18] but Jesus was
[2:17:20] obedient perhaps he felt something
[2:17:23] perhaps he didn't just as you or I we go
[2:17:27] through these uh times of Temptation we
[2:17:30] go through times of trial we may feel
[2:17:33] the Lord we may not feel him but when we
[2:17:36] don't feel him it is it is our
[2:17:39] responsibility as a Believer to take the
[2:17:42] word that we know and defeat our enemy
[2:17:47] oh
[2:17:48] and as we walk in obedience with what we
[2:17:52] know when we're not feeling
[2:17:54] anything but we're operating in this
[2:17:57] temptation in this trial when we feel so
[2:18:01] alone when we feel like there's nobody
[2:18:04] here to help us and we feel like that
[2:18:06] there's not 12 Legions of angels to come
[2:18:08] and Deliver Us right we feel like we're
[2:18:12] all alone but if we still walk in
[2:18:16] obedience to what we know from the word
[2:18:19] of God I believe that the Angels
[2:18:22] afterward can be uh ushered in that's
[2:18:25] how we are cooperating through our
[2:18:28] obedience the next one I would say is
[2:18:31] that we cooperate through our
[2:18:34] humility I give J Daniel 10:
[2:18:38] 1-14 uh specifically verse 12 then said
[2:18:42] he unto me fear not Daniel for from the
[2:18:45] first day that you did set your heart to
[2:18:48] understand and to chasen
[2:18:52] yourself before thy God thy words were
[2:18:56] heard and I am come for Thy word so in
[2:18:59] this instance the word chasen means to
[2:19:03] humble yourself or chasing yourself to
[2:19:06] humble yourself then also Isaiah 662 for
[2:19:11] all those things hath mine hand made and
[2:19:14] all those things have been said the Lord
[2:19:18] but to this man will I look even to him
[2:19:22] that is poor and of a contrite spirit
[2:19:25] and trembleth at my word so it is our
[2:19:30] part to help to activate Angelic
[2:19:34] activity to have a contrite heart to
[2:19:38] have a humble heart to not be built up
[2:19:41] in Pride to be able to uh entertain
[2:19:47] these angels with a right Spirit to walk
[2:19:50] in a right spirit all times even when we
[2:19:53] don't feel
[2:19:55] anything we want our spirit to be kept
[2:19:58] right yes sir we want to allow the Holy
[2:20:01] Spirit to uh work in us that we're
[2:20:04] humbling ourself under his mighty hand
[2:20:08] so that he can exalt Us in due time but
[2:20:11] we can help to activate the Angelic
[2:20:14] activity by humbling ourselves in the
[2:20:17] presence of God not just when we come to
[2:20:25] church friends as Believers we ought not
[2:20:27] to be
[2:20:32] Hy to one another or to those that we
[2:20:35] work with those out in the
[2:20:39] public we can't let ourselves be
[2:20:44] hoty you want me give you a more modern
[2:20:47] word
[2:20:48] we can't find ourselves being
[2:20:52] jerks to one another or to our fellow
[2:20:59] man the light of God dwells in us and it
[2:21:02] is our responsibility to let the light
[2:21:05] shine before men that others can see the
[2:21:09] God of all eternity lives inside of us
[2:21:14] and he has made a difference in our
[2:21:16] lives
[2:21:18] the musicians can come as I finish up
[2:21:20] these other two that I have the number
[2:21:23] four I would say that we can help to
[2:21:27] activate Angelic activity by speaking
[2:21:30] the word Psalm
[2:21:32] 103:20 bless the Lord ye his angels that
[2:21:37] excel in strength that do his
[2:21:40] Commandments hearkening unto the voice
[2:21:43] of his word so the angels are hearkening
[2:21:48] to the voice of his word the word of the
[2:21:51] Lord and when we take the word of the
[2:21:54] Lord and we are speaking it over our own
[2:21:57] lives no matter what we see no matter
[2:22:00] what we feel we are speaking the word of
[2:22:04] the Lord over our lives and it causes
[2:22:07] the angels to perk up their ears and to
[2:22:11] hear what we're saying that they can be
[2:22:15] launched according to what we're
[2:22:17] speaking
[2:22:18] yes let me take this just a little bit
[2:22:22] further bless the Lord ye is angels that
[2:22:25] excel in strength that do his
[2:22:27] Commandments hearkening unto the voice
[2:22:29] of his
[2:22:30] word I and you are a word sent from God
[2:22:35] we won't return void but we have a voice
[2:22:39] the word has a
[2:22:41] voice and as our
[2:22:44] voice is speaking the word of God the
[2:22:49] angels hearken to the voice of the word
[2:22:52] hallelujah we can take this a little bit
[2:22:54] farther because there will come a time
[2:22:57] when the Resurrection the voice of the
[2:22:59] Resurrection is going to be in the bride
[2:23:02] it is in the bride but there will come a
[2:23:04] time when she will call for the
[2:23:09] Resurrection the angels are hearing
[2:23:12] Hallelujah they are attached to the word
[2:23:17] Hallelujah God and His word are the same
[2:23:21] they are attached to the word and the
[2:23:23] angels as we speak the word the angels
[2:23:26] are activated and we're cooperating with
[2:23:29] the
[2:23:33] angels the last one which actually
[2:23:36] should have been the first one is
[2:23:39] worship Matthew CH 4:
[2:23:43] 8-10 again the the devil taketh him up
[2:23:46] into a exceeding high mountain and show
[2:23:48] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[2:23:50] the glory of them and saith unto him all
[2:23:53] these things will I give you if you will
[2:23:55] fall down and worship
[2:23:58] me then said Jesus unto him get thee
[2:24:01] hence saan for it is written Thou shalt
[2:24:05] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[2:24:08] shalt thou
[2:24:09] serve Jesus used it is written
[2:24:14] right which tells me that it was written
[2:24:18] there were writings
[2:24:20] somewhere that Jesus was familiar with
[2:24:24] that he used against the
[2:24:27] devil so I would like to take you to
[2:24:29] Deuteronomy chapter 6:13 a part of the
[2:24:33] Torah 613 Thou shalt fear the lord thy
[2:24:37] God and serve him and thou shalt swear
[2:24:41] by his name now here it uses the word
[2:24:45] fear we're going to use the word fear
[2:24:49] and worship together fear equals
[2:24:53] reverential awe which is
[2:24:56] worship and then we go to Psalm 347 the
[2:25:00] angel of the Lord encampeth round about
[2:25:04] them that fear Him or them that have
[2:25:06] reverential awe for him or them that
[2:25:09] worship Him the angel of the Lord
[2:25:12] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[2:25:15] and deliver them deliver them right the
[2:25:18] Angels do not encamp round about those
[2:25:21] that Grumble and complain and spout
[2:25:24] their torments and all of these things
[2:25:26] the angel of the Lord campath around
[2:25:29] about them that fear Him and He
[2:25:31] delivereth them as we worship as we're
[2:25:35] in awe of the goodness of God as we
[2:25:38] watch what the Lord does among us we are
[2:25:41] cooperating with the Angelic activity
[2:25:44] and we are allowing them by our worship
[2:25:48] by our reverential all we are in essence
[2:25:52] we are inviting the angels to come and
[2:25:56] do what they need to do you are not
[2:25:59] going to always know what the angel
[2:26:01] needs to do
[2:26:04] right we don't know what God needs to do
[2:26:07] for us
[2:26:11] sometimes you ever go to God
[2:26:14] clueless too often too often
[2:26:17] go to God clueless and I'm so glad that
[2:26:20] my Lord understands help
[2:26:27] Lord but he doesn't want us to be
[2:26:30] complainers where that all we're ever
[2:26:33] doing is saying Help
[2:26:35] Lord I'm miserable life is so rough help
[2:26:39] Lord he wants us to be in awe of his
[2:26:43] goodness he wants us to worship and in
[2:26:46] that worship we are helping to activate
[2:26:49] the Angelic activity we're causing a
[2:26:52] buzz around us in the spirit world it's
[2:26:55] causing a it's causing something to
[2:26:57] happen on the dark side because the the
[2:27:00] Angels of Darkness don't like it when we
[2:27:03] worship they don't like to hear the name
[2:27:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ they don't like
[2:27:07] it when we're entering into a place when
[2:27:09] we're able to forget all about ourselves
[2:27:13] and concentrate on him and worship him
[2:27:18] we want to activate the angels in
[2:27:22] whatever way that we can through
[2:27:25] humility through kindness through
[2:27:27] obedience through speaking the word
[2:27:30] through our worship we want to do
[2:27:32] whatever we can you can find other ways
[2:27:35] in the scripture that will help you that
[2:27:37] you will help that you will see and
[2:27:39] recognize that you can activate the
[2:27:42] Angelic activity in your life and we
[2:27:44] want to do that because it is God's
[2:27:47] promise to us that there would be an
[2:27:49] increase of angelic activity and I don't
[2:27:52] know about you but I don't want them
[2:27:55] standing around doing
[2:27:57] nothing that's
[2:27:59] right I want them to work I want them to
[2:28:04] be about Papa's business getting things
[2:28:07] done and I want to be one of those down
[2:28:10] on the earth who is in such cooperation
[2:28:13] with that Heavenly realm where that I am
[2:28:15] keeping myself in an attitude of worship
[2:28:18] and I'm walking in humility and
[2:28:20] obedience to the Lord Jesus and I'm
[2:28:22] using his word to defeat my enemy and
[2:28:25] the en the enemy is going back and the
[2:28:27] Angelic activity the Angelic host is
[2:28:30] coming in closer I'm not worshiping
[2:28:33] Angels I'm worshiping almighty God and
[2:28:35] thanking him that he sends them among us
[2:28:37] but I am so thankful for those helpers
[2:28:40] that are among us would you stand
[2:28:42] together with us and let's just Worship
[2:28:44] the Lord and just draw the host of heav
[2:28:46] heaven in close that he can do what he
[2:28:49] wants to and come and say Amen to the
[2:28:51] word of the Lord
[2:28:54] today thank you
[2:28:57] Lord thank you

[2:44:04] offer receive our efforts
[2:44:08] Lord they look kind of feeble
[2:44:11] sometime but you receive them Lord and
[2:44:14] know that our heart hearts are full of
[2:44:17] your
[2:44:18] goodness your Tender Mercies toward us
[2:44:21] that never
[2:44:24] fail I looked across the body this
[2:44:27] morning and I saw those who look tired
[2:44:29] and
[2:44:30] weary I was in a position not preaching
[2:44:33] to be able to look and I saw those who
[2:44:36] caught up on their sleep
[2:44:38] and those who look like they've been
[2:44:40] beat up by the virus and whatever else
[2:44:44] but there was something that comes over
[2:44:46] you folks when you start worshiping
[2:44:50] him when you started singing Worthy is
[2:44:53] the
[2:44:54] Lamb I just looked across and it looked
[2:44:56] like a different congregation we're the
[2:44:58] same ones weary a little while
[2:45:03] ago battle scarred a little while ago
[2:45:06] but when we connect with our creator and
[2:45:09] we are not focusing anymore on the on
[2:45:12] the pain or the or the hurt or the
[2:45:14] heartache or the or the tiredness or the
[2:45:17] headache and we start focusing on his
[2:45:19] goodness it just transforms us it
[2:45:22] transfigures us our countenance
[2:45:24] change it changes because the glory
[2:45:27] light of God begins to fall on us I want
[2:45:30] to I want to bless you and encourage you
[2:45:32] and tell you
[2:45:34] that as often as you can be connected to
[2:45:37] him like that do it and take your
[2:45:40] opportunity many times through the day
[2:45:43] to just let him know how much you love
[2:45:45] him you don't have to get to church to
[2:45:46] raise your hands raise them in your home
[2:45:49] fill your home with praise fill your
[2:45:52] automobiles with praise be connected to
[2:45:54] him because it changes so much it's not
[2:45:57] just our look or our face that changes
[2:46:01] it changes us from from the inside we we
[2:46:04] uh I've been strengthened today by the
[2:46:07] word and I know that it was a review of
[2:46:10] Tuesday night but it really helped me to
[2:46:12] be able to see it on the screen
[2:46:15] and I know uh uh charity may she may
[2:46:19] regret that uh brother gley has
[2:46:22] discovered the the benefit of having it
[2:46:25] up she may be
[2:46:27] moaning I thought about her it's not
[2:46:30] easy what they do to get it up in time
[2:46:32] and and to get it uh uh you know the
[2:46:35] scripture put in and everything but
[2:46:37] aren't we blessed to be able to see it
[2:46:40] because most of us now are we didn't all
[2:46:42] start off to be Learners that way but
[2:46:45] but our modern technology has trained us
[2:46:48] all now and we have to see something in
[2:46:49] front of us to be able to focus and
[2:46:51] concentrate and it helped me a lot today
[2:46:54] as we went through and then the the end
[2:46:57] the summary of it was how to begin to
[2:47:00] create an atmosphere in your life that
[2:47:04] you learn to yield and you learn to
[2:47:06] cooperate with those Angelic beings that
[2:47:09] God has sent to us and brother brandham
[2:47:11] said some people don't see them because
[2:47:13] they don't believe in them they don't
[2:47:15] talk about them because they don't
[2:47:16] believe in them but but we do and uh we
[2:47:19] don't have to see them I I know I could
[2:47:23] tell in worship as we come to a close I
[2:47:26] could feel something rushing into us and
[2:47:30] I know they're coming to be nosy thank
[2:47:32] God they're coming to see what's
[2:47:35] happening in you and that's what the
[2:47:37] word says I'm blessed today and I know
[2:47:40] you are and we're not going to hold you
[2:47:42] any longer but thank you for being here
[2:47:44] good to see Solomon and Zion I knew they
[2:47:47] were coming but I absolutely forgot till
[2:47:49] I saw them when I come out on the
[2:47:51] platform uh she didn't quite make it for
[2:47:53] her birthday but she wasn't too many
[2:47:54] days late were you we're glad they're
[2:47:57] here and it's uh always good to have
[2:47:59] Hannah and Rachel kinzer with us they
[2:48:01] came to help us celebrate Joshua's
[2:48:04] birthday this time and we're happy to
[2:48:06] have them I'm glad that the Lord's been
[2:48:08] with us today father go with us now and
[2:48:12] would you strengthen our brother who
[2:48:14] laid it out for us so
[2:48:16] beautifully and this is one of those
[2:48:19] that we could go back and hear again
[2:48:22] reflect on it
[2:48:24] again and look at it again because this
[2:48:28] is an ongoing
[2:48:30] Revelation I I feel that the reason why
[2:48:34] you've promised that there would be an
[2:48:36] increase is because the need for them is
[2:48:40] going to
[2:48:41] increase and and so it's good for us to
[2:48:44] to to to focus on what the spirit is
[2:48:46] focusing on strengthen our bodies and
[2:48:49] minds and bring us back here Tuesday
[2:48:51] night ready to move forward in you those
[2:48:54] who are traveling today even watch over
[2:48:57] them and keep them safe to the airport
[2:49:00] and then from the airport home we've got
[2:49:03] so much to be thankful for we thank you
[2:49:06] for your leadership to us in this hour
[2:49:09] and the strength that comes when we
[2:49:11] gather together in your name we lift you
[2:49:13] up and love you
[2:49:15] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:49:17] ask these things and the church
[2:49:20] said amen take your Miracle with you I'm
[2:49:23] claiming mine I really did feel
[2:49:26] something rushing in when we were
[2:49:28] worshiping the Lord and I'm claiming
[2:49:31] mine and I want you to do the same let's

[2:49:42] will be with them in every step that
[2:49:44] they make
[2:49:45] and heal their hurts and their wounds

[2:49:54] oldest son and there was a divorce many
[2:49:57] years ago in that family and and and the

[2:50:09] families involved and then her husband a
[2:50:12] childhood sweetheart and looking forward
[2:50:16] to welcoming that little baby into the
[2:50:18] world and God had a plan that nobody saw
[2:50:21] coming but he saw and he knew and he can
[2:50:25] use this to help that family anything
[2:50:28] that you can do throughout the next few
[2:50:29] days to show your love especially to
