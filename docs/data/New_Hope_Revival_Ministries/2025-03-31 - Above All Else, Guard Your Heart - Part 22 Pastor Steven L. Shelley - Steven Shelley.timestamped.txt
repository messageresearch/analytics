[46:32] We adore you. Oh Jesus.
[46:35] Sweet Jesus. Your place. Yes.
[46:44] [Music]
[46:45] When we feel that connection with your
[46:49] heart, we know why we exist. Yes.
[46:55] Being in love with you makes everything
[46:59] make sense. That's it.
[47:04] And I was
[47:06] reminded just when you told the
[47:08] disciples that everything
[47:10] that the father had given
[47:14] you, you would not lose. They're in your
[47:17] hand.
[47:19] Everyone and your right
[47:22] hand is all powerful. Amen.
[47:27] Amen.
[47:30] And also when we were singing about your
[47:34] manifest
[47:36] presence, I could just sense you come
[47:40] among us. And my spirit was responding
[47:44] to you, Lord. Hallelujah. And I just
[47:47] want to thank you for the honor of
[47:49] meeting with you. Yes, sir. Thank you
[47:52] for being among us right now. And
[47:55] father, I'm inviting you to come and do

[48:25] because you wanted us so bad. Amen. And
[48:28] so we're responding right now to you and
[48:31] we're coming before you, Lord, at your
[48:35] invitation. And we just thank you for
[48:37] your love for us, the life you've given
[48:39] us, the hope that we have in Jesus

[48:48] eternity. and the
[48:51] bride. She's going to be with you
[48:53] forever and ever and ever. We belong to
[48:58] you, oh

[49:02] right
[49:03] now where that reality might be obscure
[49:07] or has numbed. Father, I pray in the
[49:10] name of Jesus that the anointing of the
[49:13] Holy Ghost would destroy every lie that
[49:16] is holding us back and we would just
[49:19] come before you with boldness, full
[49:21] confidence at the throne of grace.
[49:27] I just pray you would have your way
[49:29] tonight or today um among us. Oh God,
[49:35] like we heard the other day, we are now
[49:37] seated in heavenly places. It's a
[49:39] present reality.

[49:45] right now.
[49:47] So we just commit everything into your
[49:50] hands right now. Be with brother Gley.

[1:01:13] be seated. Stay alert, please. We want
[1:01:18] to We've got several things that we want
[1:01:20] to share with you. And we want you to to
[1:01:24] to uh be awake. We want you to hear it.
[1:01:27] We don't want you to miss it. God is
[1:01:30] good. Amen. Thank you so much. Uh you're
[1:01:34] looking this way
[1:01:38] now. Thank you so much for all of your
[1:01:41] prayers. for us while we were gone. We
[1:01:44] needed them multiple times. And God was
[1:01:47] faithful because you prayed, because you
[1:01:50] cared, because you made a sacrifice. The
[1:01:53] Lord was faithful and he moved. I
[1:01:57] haven't gotten all my energy back just
[1:01:59] yet. Uh I don't know why, but you know,
[1:02:02] sometimes your body's fighting something
[1:02:04] off and you don't have a lot of
[1:02:06] symptoms, but something's going on. But
[1:02:09] uh also I'm not used to preaching four
[1:02:11] services that close together either.
[1:02:14] Hadn't been it's been a long time. But
[1:02:16] God was good. You would have been so
[1:02:18] blessed. I know you were needed here at
[1:02:21] your post of duty. But you would have
[1:02:24] been so blessed to have been in those
[1:02:26] meetings and those who were blessed and
[1:02:28] privileged to be able to be there were
[1:02:31] blessed. And not only did they receive a
[1:02:33] blessing, but uh they were a blessing.
[1:02:37] And we didn't know that at the last
[1:02:40] minute there would be a need for a
[1:02:42] musician. There was a brother who has
[1:02:45] been I guess raised in that church and
[1:02:48] we knew his parents for many many years
[1:02:51] who had been working a a particular
[1:02:53] schedule for a long time. And the
[1:02:56] weekend of the meetings the the schedule
[1:03:00] changed and he was required to be there
[1:03:02] and he only got to be there in one
[1:03:04] service. And uh I had felt in my heart
[1:03:08] that Cade was supposed to be there and
[1:03:11] we made arrangements for him to have a
[1:03:13] place and uh he came made the sacrifice
[1:03:17] to drive up and come and he was very
[1:03:19] needed. He ended up being the musician
[1:03:21] for the meetings and God blessed him and
[1:03:24] used him and anointed him. And then on
[1:03:27] Saturday night and Sunday, Brother Josh
[1:03:31] came up and he was needed on the guitar.
[1:03:34] And it just was uh a real privilege to
[1:03:38] be there. The atmosphere was so
[1:03:40] powerful. And I'm not exaggerating when
[1:03:43] I tell you, brother Adam Knight and
[1:03:46] Sister Ida, his wife, would want me to
[1:03:49] greet you and to tell you that they
[1:03:52] appreciate your prayers for the
[1:03:54] meetings. And the church on Friday night
[1:03:57] was packed. It was full with chairs put
[1:04:00] out. And there were pastors who had made
[1:04:03] quite a sacrifice to be there. And it
[1:04:06] meant a lot to us. Brother Scott Smith,
[1:04:09] who is a pastor of a of a nicesized
[1:04:11] church uh over an hour away. He was
[1:04:15] there on Friday night with his wife,
[1:04:17] Brother Adam, uh excuse me, brother
[1:04:20] Brother Danny Adams, who pastors a
[1:04:22] church there where we were three years
[1:04:24] ago. He and his wife were there Friday
[1:04:26] night and Saturday night. Brother
[1:04:29] Lindseay McGrady, who pastors a church
[1:04:31] quite a distance away, was there with
[1:04:34] his wife and his mother-in-law and
[1:04:36] father-in-law. What a real blessing to
[1:04:39] get to see brother and sister Ror in the
[1:04:41] service on Friday night. On Saturday
[1:04:44] night, there was some sort of hindrance
[1:04:47] at the beginning of the meeting. I'm
[1:04:49] down in the basement. Could have had
[1:04:51] something to do with the heat because
[1:04:53] the day of the meetings, the air
[1:04:55] conditioner went
[1:04:56] out. Well, it's a good thing it was a
[1:04:59] little cooler there than here. But they
[1:05:01] opened the door. They had to open the
[1:05:02] door outside to let some cool air in.
[1:05:07] And uh it was warm. I'm not going to
[1:05:09] tell you it wasn't warm. It was warm.
[1:05:11] But we made it anyhow. And uh God was
[1:05:14] good. I took off my tie, but I kept my
[1:05:16] coat on the whole time. So I kept half
[1:05:19] the protocol. But uh but there was such
[1:05:23] a you could feel it. I'm in the basement
[1:05:25] and I could hear and I could just sense
[1:05:28] that there was some sort of hindrance in
[1:05:31] the service at the beginning, but I
[1:05:34] don't know what shifted. But from the
[1:05:35] time I came out and I walked, the minute
[1:05:38] I put my foot on the platform, the
[1:05:41] presence of the Lord became so real. I
[1:05:45] just said, "It's the angel of the Lord
[1:05:46] here." That's all I knew to call it
[1:05:49] because his presence became so real that
[1:05:51] I went ended up on my on my knees and
[1:05:55] the pastor also overcome and the
[1:05:58] presence of the Lord so real across the
[1:06:00] entire service. They were calling me to
[1:06:04] take the service and I couldn't get up.
[1:06:06] I couldn't I couldn't stop weeping under
[1:06:09] that anointing to be able to even take
[1:06:12] the service. When I got there, I
[1:06:14] couldn't talk except to weep. and uh
[1:06:17] worship. And then the presence of the
[1:06:19] Lord sent me down to the pastor's son
[1:06:22] who needed a mighty touch from God. And
[1:06:25] as I began to pray for him, he began to
[1:06:27] weep in the presence of the Lord. And
[1:06:29] some little sisters turned loose and
[1:06:31] were out in the aisle. And the pastor
[1:06:33] gave him Can you wait a minute now? Wait
[1:06:35] till you hear this. The pastor gave a
[1:06:37] message in tongues and interpretation
[1:06:39] from the platform. This is unheard of.
[1:06:43] This is unheard of. Hallelujah. And uh
[1:06:47] so God was moving and Sunday he moved
[1:06:49] again among us and sister Evelyn was so
[1:06:52] glad to have all of us up in her neck of
[1:06:54] the woods and s and Mimi Sister Mimi was
[1:06:57] there with her and thank you for coming
[1:07:00] those of you who did those of you who
[1:07:02] didn't. Thank you for praying for us.
[1:07:04] God moved sovereignly. We didn't know we
[1:07:07] were getting such a swanky place for the
[1:07:09] cost of less than two hotel rooms. We
[1:07:12] had a house uh on the lake on Lake
[1:07:15] James. Is that right? Lake James. And uh
[1:07:19] when I say lakehouse, I mean a
[1:07:21] lakehouse, not a cabin. And the and the
[1:07:25] sun room sat out over the water. So when
[1:07:29] you're in the sun room looking down,
[1:07:30] you're you're over the water. And we
[1:07:33] were so thankful. We had no idea what we
[1:07:36] were getting. We thought it looked
[1:07:38] pretty in the pictures. And I told the
[1:07:40] pastor, I'm going to take care of our
[1:07:42] accommodation because my family's coming
[1:07:45] and it's my responsibility to take care
[1:07:47] of them, not yours. But the church was
[1:07:49] very generous. They took care of all of
[1:07:51] our expenses in in the offering that
[1:07:53] they gave. And we left there mightily
[1:07:56] blessed of the Lord. And we we got to
[1:07:58] stay an extra day for half price. And
[1:08:01] uh, Brother Bill Yance drove all the way
[1:08:04] down on Friday night with Jason, his
[1:08:07] son, and they were in the service and
[1:08:09] invited me to come up and preach
[1:08:11] Wednesday night. We almost didn't go. We
[1:08:13] needed to be home, but the Lord dealt
[1:08:16] with us. He just the pool was there. And
[1:08:19] they only have a small handful of
[1:08:20] people. And on Wednesday night, it's
[1:08:23] less than a handful. But I didn't care.
[1:08:26] It didn't matter to me. I was just going
[1:08:28] to be a encouragement to him. When you
[1:08:30] are 81 years old and you've lost your
[1:08:33] wife of 60 plus years and your your
[1:08:36] church has come down to a handful of
[1:08:37] people, I'd say you need a little
[1:08:39] encouragement.
[1:08:41] And so we just decided that we were
[1:08:43] going to do it. And we went up and took
[1:08:44] him out to eat on Tuesday night and then
[1:08:47] had service on Wednesday night. And to
[1:08:49] our surprise, to our surprise, there
[1:08:52] were close to 80 people there on
[1:08:54] Wednesday night, which was a shock. a
[1:08:58] shock to them and a shock to us. And you
[1:09:00] know how they got there? By Facebook
[1:09:03] invite. Jason just put out on Facebook,
[1:09:06] Brother Shelley's going to be preaching
[1:09:08] and singing. And we had a great time in
[1:09:10] the Lord. And if I told you the needs
[1:09:12] that were ministered to and the people
[1:09:14] that hadn't been in church in years that
[1:09:17] came to that meeting Wednesday night,
[1:09:19] there was a man sitting on the front
[1:09:21] row. And after the service, Brother Bill
[1:09:22] said, "Did you see that man sitting on
[1:09:24] the front row?" "Yes, I saw him." He
[1:09:26] said he hadn't been to church here in
[1:09:27] three years.
[1:09:30] He said, "But he told me he'd see me
[1:09:31] Sunday." He said, "If brother Shel's
[1:09:34] going to be preaching, I'm coming
[1:09:36] regardless." And God really moved and
[1:09:38] blessed and I'm thankful and the family
[1:09:40] was ministered to. Would you keep
[1:09:41] praying for them? Pray for Brother Adam
[1:09:44] and Sister Ida and his family. Uh it
[1:09:47] it's a beautiful thing that God's doing.
[1:09:49] It's a country church. It sits up on a
[1:09:51] hill. It would make an amazing painting.
[1:09:54] It sits up on a hill and a load of steps
[1:09:57] going up to it and it's it's just a
[1:09:59] beautiful little country place. Uh most
[1:10:02] of all, the presence of the Lord makes a
[1:10:04] difference. God makes a difference. I
[1:10:07] felt the floor shaking when the spirit
[1:10:09] of God began to move. And we're looking
[1:10:12] for something to come out of that even
[1:10:14] more than what we've already heard.
[1:10:16] They're going to be coming for a visit
[1:10:18] soon. Uh, I don't know how much of this
[1:10:21] to say, but we could always remove it
[1:10:24] later if I got too personal. But I
[1:10:26] looked down and I saw that there was a
[1:10:28] German sister on the front row with her
[1:10:32] husband. I assumed her husband and he
[1:10:35] didn't look quite as German to me as she
[1:10:37] did. She had on the stockings that the
[1:10:40] German ladies wear and when they're cold
[1:10:43] and how in the world she could have
[1:10:45] stood that, I don't know. But it was
[1:10:48] just that, her warm stockings and her
[1:10:51] mannerisms that let me know she was
[1:10:53] German the way she held her head. I hope
[1:10:55] that's not offensive, but it's the
[1:10:57] truth. But I thought I ought to know
[1:10:59] you. I I I think I've seen you. I think
[1:11:02] I've met you. But what are Germans doing
[1:11:04] up here in Morgan, North Carolina?
[1:11:08] I mean, that's just not a metropolis.
[1:11:10] I'll tell you that right now. There's a
[1:11:12] Walmart now and a few stores that they
[1:11:15] didn't have, but it's not a big big
[1:11:17] place. And uh the last night of the
[1:11:19] meeting uh I was told who they were. And
[1:11:23] uh it is it was the grandson one of the
[1:11:26] grandsons of brother Ewald Frank and the
[1:11:30] the son uh of uh of I'll get it in a
[1:11:35] minute uh
[1:11:37] Bernard in English Bernard. And we spent
[1:11:41] an evening with brother Bernard uh who
[1:11:43] who pastors a group in Germany. We spent
[1:11:46] an evening with him on the night of
[1:11:47] brother Green's funeral. And I can't
[1:11:50] tell you
[1:11:52] details, but he said something to me on
[1:11:56] Sunday that really really touched my
[1:11:59] heart. And it was that just the without
[1:12:03] giving the detail uh it was a little
[1:12:06] something that was said in the service
[1:12:08] that set his mind and heart to ease and
[1:12:11] he opened up. You've got to open up.
[1:12:14] You've got to open up. I'll be glad to
[1:12:17] tell some of you uh privately if you if
[1:12:20] you're interested, want to ask, but he
[1:12:23] was able to open up his heart and God
[1:12:26] came in and he he cried out in the in
[1:12:28] the presence of the Lord. And anyway, uh
[1:12:31] I know I'm taking time, but but what
[1:12:34] about asking you to pray and then not
[1:12:36] even telling you that that it was worth
[1:12:38] your prayers?
[1:12:40] Worth your prayers. And I've got plenty
[1:12:43] to say today, but I want to remind you
[1:12:45] that the fellowship meetings, Would you
[1:12:47] bring me a microphone? Uh, fellowship
[1:12:50] meetings are this weekend, April the 5th
[1:12:52] and the 6th. And I meant to tell you
[1:12:55] before I left, but Brother Dwayne
[1:12:58] Jackson is going to be preaching
[1:13:00] Saturday night, and I'll be preaching
[1:13:03] Sunday morning. The way that worked out
[1:13:05] is he was scheduled to preach at Brother
[1:13:08] David Templeton's right up the road.
[1:13:11] Brother David forgot that it was our
[1:13:13] fellowship meeting, which was fine.
[1:13:16] They're a sovereign church. We're a
[1:13:18] sovereign church. They can do them and
[1:13:20] we'll do us. And the times that we get
[1:13:22] to do it together are extra blessed. But
[1:13:25] then he invited us to come and and and
[1:13:29] uh to have a little meal too with them.
[1:13:31] And I I didn't want to answer because I
[1:13:34] didn't want to throw a wrench into what
[1:13:35] they were doing. So, I didn't even
[1:13:37] answer right away. And then last Sunday
[1:13:40] night, it was a week ago, he sent a text
[1:13:42] and he said, "I'm so stupid." And I
[1:13:44] said, "No, brother, you're not. You're a
[1:13:46] pastor and we get passes for
[1:13:49] forgetfulness. We have a lot on our
[1:13:51] mind." And uh he said, "Well, you know,
[1:13:54] is there something we can do to work it
[1:13:55] out?" And I said, "Well, yes, you can
[1:13:58] loan us your preacher for Saturday night
[1:14:02] and then he can preach for you Sunday
[1:14:03] morning and you can go right on with
[1:14:05] your plans." And you know, without any
[1:14:07] hesitation, I've never had cooperation
[1:14:09] from pastors
[1:14:11] ever. Without any hesitation, uh,
[1:14:14] Jonathan, he said, "A done deal, and
[1:14:17] we'll come with him Saturday night." So,
[1:14:20] we're looking forward to what the Lord
[1:14:21] will do Saturday night. Of course, they
[1:14:23] won't be with us Sunday morning, but I
[1:14:25] hear that others are coming in. It's
[1:14:27] going to be a good time. Uh K, can you
[1:14:31] play that song that you did so very well
[1:14:34] on uh Saturday night? Uh preserving all
[1:14:38] relationships because I placed a lot of
[1:14:40] pressure on him. And I said, "If you
[1:14:43] mess me up on this song, you're
[1:14:46] done. Don't ever look at my daughter
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:53] again." And he did amazing.
[1:14:56] This was the only thing Brother Adam
[1:14:58] asked me. He said, 'I want you to obey
[1:15:01] the Lord when you come, but I've got one
[1:15:02] request. I want to hear you sing God
[1:15:05] Walks the Dark Hills. I've probably not
[1:15:07] sung it in 20 plus
[1:15:10] years. God walks the dark
[1:15:16] hills, the
[1:15:18] highways and byways.
[1:15:23] He walks through the
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:27] billows of life's troubled
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:33] sea. He walks through the cold dark
[1:15:39] night, the shadows of midnight.
[1:15:45] God walks the dark
[1:15:49] hills just to guide you and
[1:15:55] me. God walks the dark
[1:16:01] hills to guide my footsteps.
[1:16:08] He walks
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:12] everywhere by night and by
[1:16:18] day he walks in
[1:16:24] silence. Oh, down the
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:29] highway. God walks the dark
[1:16:35] hills to show me the
[1:16:39] way.
[1:16:41] Listen, God walks in the
[1:16:46] storm, in the rain and the sunshine.
[1:16:53] He walks on the
[1:16:57] billows or through glimmering
[1:17:03] light. Helps us walk up the
[1:17:07] mountain so high. Cross our rivers
[1:17:11] through valleyies.
[1:17:15] God walks the dark
[1:17:19] hills cuz he loves you and
[1:17:24] me. Sing it with me. God walks the dark
[1:17:31] hills to guide my
[1:17:36] footsteps. He walks
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:42] everywhere by night and by
[1:17:47] day he walks in
[1:17:53] silence. Oh, down the highway.
[1:17:59] God walks the dark
[1:18:04] hills just to show me the way. Listen to
[1:18:09] this last verse again. God walks through
[1:18:13] the
[1:18:15] storm, through the rain and the
[1:18:19] sunshine.
[1:18:22] He walks on the
[1:18:26] billows or through glimmering
[1:18:32] light. Helps us walk up the
[1:18:36] mountain so high. Cross
[1:18:40] rivers through
[1:18:43] valleyies. And God walks the dark
[1:18:48] hills cuz he loves you. and me. Sing it
[1:18:53] with me, would you? God walks the dark
[1:19:00] hills to guide my footsteps. Yes, you
[1:19:04] do, Lord. And he walks everywhere.
[1:19:12] By night and by
[1:19:16] day he walks in
[1:19:22] silence. Oh, down the
[1:19:27] highway. God walks the dark
[1:19:33] hills just to show me the way.
[1:19:41] Aren't you glad he
[1:19:51] does? Aren't you glad he does? Aren't
[1:19:55] you glad he does? You folks are sleepy.
[1:19:58] Don't you sleep at night?
[1:20:05] Come here, brother Luke Yovic. and come
[1:20:08] down here, Sister Megan
[1:20:12] Yovic,
[1:20:14] please. Unannounced,
[1:20:19] unprepared. Few weeks ago, y'all stand
[1:20:23] beside each other and face the glorious
[1:20:25] congregation.
[1:20:27] A few weeks ago, my wife and family,
[1:20:31] girls at least, were gone to Indiana to
[1:20:34] a
[1:20:34] meeting. And uh I was in my pajamas on a
[1:20:39] Saturday
[1:20:41] afternoon, not expecting any company
[1:20:44] because most people know I appreciate a
[1:20:47] little heads up. But that's not a
[1:20:49] surprise with a heads up, is it? I go to
[1:20:52] the door in my pajamas thinking that it
[1:20:54] is the
[1:20:57] FedEx. I had just received a
[1:20:59] notification for delivery and I went to
[1:21:01] get my delivery and there stood Brother
[1:21:05] Luke and Sister Megan Yovic with
[1:21:08] sheepish looks on their faces. And I
[1:21:12] said, "Oh Lord, I'm not dressed. Let me
[1:21:14] go get my clothes on. Let me get
[1:21:16] something besides my pajamas on." I go
[1:21:18] running down the hall. Joshua comes out
[1:21:20] of his room. He's not uh properly
[1:21:23] attired either,
[1:21:25] really. He goes to the door and leaves
[1:21:28] them standing on the
[1:21:31] porch. And I said, "Well, at least let
[1:21:33] them come in. They're here to see us."
[1:21:36] And I go back in and I said, "Well, I
[1:21:39] already know." Because I had seen the
[1:21:42] way she was moving. Megan moves
[1:21:45] differently. She's a creature of of
[1:21:47] habit. And when she's expecting, she
[1:21:50] moves a little different than other
[1:21:51] people. And I noticed it for about two
[1:21:53] weeks. But I had no clue about the rest.
[1:21:59] So I want her and him, whoever. But but
[1:22:01] she's the one who told me part of it and
[1:22:03] then he can tell part. But I want you to
[1:22:05] tell about the little details, too. I
[1:22:07] think the church would appreciate
[1:22:08] knowing the dates and the different
[1:22:10] things. You all can hand them out back
[1:22:12] and forth or whatever. Oh boy.
[1:22:16] Um, well, it's
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:24] twins. We'll just start with
[1:22:27] that. Um, we went to our ultrasound and
[1:22:32] like we had talked about, you know, the
[1:22:35] possibility after with Rayma. We
[1:22:37] thought, you know, he said he had
[1:22:39] thought about it even before her that
[1:22:42] like our necks will probably be twins. I
[1:22:44] didn't think that. Well, we go to our
[1:22:47] ultrasound and we're just sitting there
[1:22:50] and I'm just praying everything looks
[1:22:52] good and she runs the scanner across my
[1:22:56] belly and he grabs my arm and I grab her
[1:22:58] arm and I was like, "Is it twins?" And
[1:23:00] she goes, "Yes." And like the whole room
[1:23:03] erupted. Our kids were jumping and
[1:23:04] screaming and mom was like, "I knew it."
[1:23:07] Because she'd been telling me for a week
[1:23:08] she thought it was. Um
[1:23:11] but okay, you tell the rest.
[1:23:15] Uh the the due date is
[1:23:18] projected at October 18th, the day we
[1:23:21] lost Rayma. And so we're just same date.
[1:23:24] Same date. She was born and lost. They
[1:23:26] lost her. Same day. What was the brother
[1:23:30] said that day? I mean, it's pretty
[1:23:33] incredible. Um the day that we had her
[1:23:37] little funeral,
[1:23:39] um pastor was praying for us in our room
[1:23:42] and um he was praying and he said, "God
[1:23:45] will redeem and restore." And like when
[1:23:49] she ran that I was just like, "He's
[1:23:51] doing it right now." And then to top it
[1:23:53] all off, the due date, it was just so
[1:23:55] much so overwhelming. I was like, "We're
[1:23:57] going to tell them right now." Like
[1:23:59] right now. So it's twins. Ain't that
[1:24:03] wonderful? Oh, that's so good.
[1:24:05] Congratulations to both of you. That's
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:13] wonderful. God is good. Let's thank the
[1:24:16] Lord for these
[1:24:22] musicians. My the Lord is good. Isn't
[1:24:26] that beautiful? It is. That is
[1:24:28] beautiful. He doesn't make a mistake.
[1:24:31] And they might let you see a ultrasound
[1:24:34] if you'd like to see one. The last one I
[1:24:37] saw, I've seen two two times now. The
[1:24:40] last one I saw was it looked exactly
[1:24:43] like upstairs and downstairs
[1:24:46] apartments. It looked like they were
[1:24:48] sitting in apartments right on top of
[1:24:50] each other. One baby up here and one
[1:24:52] baby down there. God is good.
[1:24:56] They went through a dark time and the
[1:24:59] Lord is giving them back, we believe,
[1:25:02] some some double blessing. And uh some
[1:25:06] folks wouldn't be excited about
[1:25:09] it, but they are
[1:25:12] and I am too cuz I don't have to take
[1:25:15] care of them every day. God bless you.
[1:25:17] Let's stand for the reading of the word.
[1:25:20] Uh I don't know that uh some of these
[1:25:23] dates were mentioned while I was gone. I
[1:25:25] have not yet had a chance to see the
[1:25:26] services. I heard I've heard nothing but
[1:25:29] wonderful reports about the preaching
[1:25:31] and I know it was good and I will
[1:25:33] listen. I just haven't had an
[1:25:34] opportunity to do it. We didn't get home
[1:25:36] till Thursday night and I just haven't
[1:25:39] had a chance but I want to. But last
[1:25:41] Monday was Sister Phoe's birthday. Not
[1:25:43] this past but while I was away. And then
[1:25:46] Wednesday of that week was Carter's
[1:25:48] birthday. And um we didn't I wasn't here
[1:25:51] to remember or to to announce it, but uh
[1:25:54] Wednesday the 26th, how old did you
[1:25:56] turn, Carter? 13. That's pretty special
[1:26:00] birthday, isn't it? Let's Let's thank
[1:26:02] the Lord for Carter. Wish him a belated
[1:26:06] happy
[1:26:07] birthday. And then the Gies celebrated
[1:26:10] on last Friday their 43rd wedding
[1:26:13] anniversary. That's pretty profound. And
[1:26:16] that was also Sister Greta Christensen's
[1:26:19] birthday. And uh uh hoping that they
[1:26:21] might see this. They're longtime friends
[1:26:24] and streamers of this ministry in
[1:26:26] Norway. We send them lots of love. And
[1:26:29] if they should happen to to hear this
[1:26:31] service, I sure would love to hear from
[1:26:33] Brother Frank and know how they're doing
[1:26:36] um across the water there. And this
[1:26:39] coming Wednesday, April the 2nd, is
[1:26:41] Sister Alfreda's birthday. So, you're
[1:26:44] going to want to make sure to wish her a
[1:26:46] very happy birthday on Wednesday of this
[1:26:48] week. And then on Friday of this week,
[1:26:51] uh, would be the anniversary of Brother
[1:26:53] Peter McFarland and Sister April Reigns.
[1:26:57] And they were married in
[1:26:59] 2009. How much time did you all How many
[1:27:02] years did you all get to spend together
[1:27:04] then? Just under two years they got to
[1:27:07] spend together. But, uh, it was a great
[1:27:10] expression of their love one for
[1:27:11] another. And we sure do miss brother I
[1:27:14] miss Peter many many many times. Then
[1:27:16] this coming Saturday, April the 5th is
[1:27:19] Isaiah Ellsworth's birthday and uh he's
[1:27:22] had a rough day today. Uh so let's pray
[1:27:24] for him. He is about to turn three.
[1:27:27] We're believing that's going to help him
[1:27:28] in every
[1:27:31] way. Isn't God good? Let's turn in our
[1:27:35] Bible this morning. It's just
[1:27:37] 12:23. We have plenty of time. Let's
[1:27:40] turn in our Bible to Proverbs chapter 16
[1:27:43] verse 18. We're finishing up uh the sin
[1:27:47] of pride and how pride and hottiness
[1:27:52] like to partner with the spirit of
[1:27:54] offense to bring both bondage and
[1:27:57] eventual deception. I've got a few
[1:28:00] little uh short piece of of review and
[1:28:05] then we're going to move on. Uh it's not
[1:28:08] easy to keep up with this because I have
[1:28:12] uh three or four series going at once.
[1:28:16] We are on above all else part 22. We are
[1:28:21] on the characteristics and strongholds
[1:28:23] of offense part 11. We are on the deadly
[1:28:27] trio of pride hottiness partnered with
[1:28:29] offense part seven. And before we leave
[1:28:32] here today, we will have started uh
[1:28:36] another uh
[1:28:38] subset that I'd like to call the subtle
[1:28:41] spell. How manipulation and control
[1:28:44] enter in through offense. And that would
[1:28:46] be part one. So we're dropping off pride
[1:28:50] and moving into something else. Proverbs
[1:28:52] 16:18, pride goeth before
[1:28:56] destruction and anaughty spirit before a
[1:28:59] fall. Father, we come to you Lord today
[1:29:03] as humble as we know how. Humility is
[1:29:06] not something we can put on and fake it
[1:29:09] or uh pretend. Humility is something
[1:29:12] that comes from real relationship with
[1:29:15] you. When we
[1:29:17] realize how far you
[1:29:20] condescended, how far you stepped down
[1:29:23] to become like us, you are the ultimate
[1:29:28] example of
[1:29:29] humility. And we thank you that you have
[1:29:33] modeled it for us. And there's a fight
[1:29:36] uh it seems in the end time, that great
[1:29:38] battle of the mind. And the enemy wants
[1:29:41] to lead us into various virtues of
[1:29:44] pride. But we ask that you would help us
[1:29:47] today that we would be free from all
[1:29:51] pretense of pride. We also pray that you
[1:29:55] would expose to us the ways that
[1:29:59] manipulation and control desire to
[1:30:02] operate among us. We want to be led by
[1:30:06] the spirit and not controlled by
[1:30:09] spirits. So we ask for your help today
[1:30:12] in this study. Uh, I sense that the
[1:30:16] people are also a bit weary and
[1:30:18] scattered in thought and I need you,
[1:30:21] Lord, to help me lay a foundation for
[1:30:23] what is ahead. And I'm depending on you
[1:30:26] today to come and give us grace to do
[1:30:28] that. We will praise you abundantly
[1:30:30] because you're always lovely and
[1:30:34] altogether worthy of the praise. We ask
[1:30:37] for your help. In the name of the Lord
[1:30:39] Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saints
[1:30:42] said, "Amen." Amen. You may be seated.
[1:30:44] Just remember, you ain't the only one
[1:30:47] going through a battle. You're not the
[1:30:50] only one that's in a struggle. Amen. The
[1:30:54] bride of Christ around the world is in a
[1:30:57] battle for their mind. But we're going
[1:31:00] to win it. We're going to win it. We're
[1:31:02] going to win it. And the very fact
[1:31:04] sometime that we want to call so much
[1:31:06] attention to our own struggle is rooted
[1:31:09] in
[1:31:11] pride. And so sometimes we need to
[1:31:15] overcome not only because God has made
[1:31:17] us overcomers. He said I want you to
[1:31:20] know I've overcome the world. So I'm
[1:31:22] writing to you to overcome. That's how
[1:31:23] we overcome by the way is in his
[1:31:25] overcoming power. Uh we have to remember
[1:31:29] sometime that if we pull too much of the
[1:31:32] focus on our own struggle, our own
[1:31:35] problem, then we cause others to lose
[1:31:38] their footing. And we got to have
[1:31:41] somebody we trust. We've got to have
[1:31:42] somebody we can talk to. We've got to
[1:31:45] have somebody that we can find strength
[1:31:47] with. Uh that is that is a fact. But
[1:31:50] it's like fasting. When we fast, we
[1:31:53] don't come dragging into church with a
[1:31:55] with a pale face and and sleepy
[1:31:58] cracklings in our eyes and messy hair
[1:32:01] and wanting everybody to know we're
[1:32:03] fasting. The scriptures said when you
[1:32:05] fast, you wash your face. You anoint
[1:32:07] your head with oil
[1:32:10] and you go on work your job if that's
[1:32:13] what is required. And we've had some
[1:32:15] brothers here who went into some uh long
[1:32:18] periods of fasting, working every day in
[1:32:20] the hot sun because they wanted a
[1:32:23] meeting with God. God is faithful. Amen.
[1:32:27] And they didn't run around telling
[1:32:29] everybody. Of course, when their clothes
[1:32:30] started falling off, people will start
[1:32:32] asking uh why you're looking so so slim
[1:32:38] all of a sudden. But we don't want to
[1:32:40] draw attention to ourselves in our
[1:32:43] giving. We don't want to draw attention
[1:32:45] to ourselves in our struggle. We always
[1:32:48] want the focus to be on the only one who
[1:32:51] can help us get out and that is the Lord
[1:32:54] Jesus Christ. Praise him. Give him
[1:32:56] praise. Give him praise. Let him be the
[1:33:00] light. Let him be the focus. Let your
[1:33:03] vocabulary and your language be that of
[1:33:05] an overcomer. Uh whether you feel like
[1:33:08] overcoming or not, whether you feel like
[1:33:10] you are overcoming or not. Uh because
[1:33:13] there's power in the right confession.
[1:33:16] Let the weak say I am strong. Didn't say
[1:33:19] let the weak say I can barely make it.
[1:33:22] Didn't say let the weak say I'm on my
[1:33:24] last leg. It said let the weak say I'm
[1:33:28] strong. Let the poor not the poor.
[1:33:30] Didn't say to the poor we go around and
[1:33:32] say I can, you know, hardly get enough
[1:33:34] for a can of soup. said, "Let the poor
[1:33:37] say I'm rich
[1:33:39] because I tap into resources that are
[1:33:42] not of this world." How many of you are
[1:33:45] glad that your strength is not of this
[1:33:48] world? Your riches are not of this
[1:33:50] world. Your provision is not dependent
[1:33:53] on this world. You're tapping in to what
[1:33:56] God has on the other side. Pride goeth
[1:33:59] before destruction. Proverbs 16:18 says,
[1:34:02] and that word pride, if you'll put that
[1:34:04] up, uh it is it is
[1:34:08] 1347 strongs, H for Hebrew, and the word
[1:34:13] is gaon. And gaon is also translated
[1:34:18] arrogancy because sometimes pride and
[1:34:22] arrogancy are are synonymous. To be
[1:34:25] arrogant is rooted in pride. It also
[1:34:29] means exaltation. It means excellency,
[1:34:32] majesty, pomp, proud, swelling up. Here
[1:34:36] gaon reflects an excessive self- reggard
[1:34:40] that opposes humility. And according to
[1:34:43] the scripture here, it invites downfall.
[1:34:47] The main message of this verse is saying
[1:34:50] that pride and arrogance lead to ruin.
[1:34:55] They never lead us closer to Christ.
[1:34:58] never leads us to victory, never leads
[1:35:00] us to overcoming power. It only leads to
[1:35:03] ruin. The phrase goeth before pride
[1:35:07] goeth before means that pride comes
[1:35:10] first. It's the cause of the warning s.
[1:35:14] It's the cause or the warning sign of
[1:35:17] what's coming next. Destruction. Walk in
[1:35:21] pride, destruction's going to follow.
[1:35:24] Sha same with a hotty spirit. It sets
[1:35:27] you up for a fall. When we look at the
[1:35:30] word hottie, it it it speaks to us of
[1:35:33] being
[1:35:35] uncorrectable.
[1:35:37] Uninstructable. Someone who it let me
[1:35:40] just say it like mama used to say it, a
[1:35:43] knowit-all.
[1:35:45] Can I tell you, nobody likes a
[1:35:47] know-it-all. That's why preachers are so
[1:35:49] despised is because in their very in
[1:35:52] their very delivery, it almost looks
[1:35:55] like they know. They think they know
[1:35:56] everything. Well, I want you to know I
[1:35:58] don't know everything. I know more than
[1:36:02] those who don't bother to look.
[1:36:06] I know more than those who don't ever
[1:36:08] approach the word, but I don't know
[1:36:11] everything. And he has to teach me every
[1:36:14] day of my life. I make sure to pull
[1:36:17] myself up to his table every day of my
[1:36:21] life to be taught of the spirit. And
[1:36:24] brother, if that's the best teacher, the
[1:36:26] Holy Ghost is the best teacher that
[1:36:28] there could ever be. He will lead us and
[1:36:31] guide us, instruct us into the ways of
[1:36:34] all truth. That's what the Bible said.
[1:36:36] Amen. So, a hotty spirit is a spirit
[1:36:41] that knows it already. You know, I find
[1:36:44] that when you try to advise people today
[1:36:46] with unsolicited advice and sometimes
[1:36:50] with solicited adi advice, when they ask
[1:36:54] you, but but they don't always ask you,
[1:36:58] but you feel the opportunity to give a
[1:37:01] little instruction, a little advice, a
[1:37:04] little I've been there, done that, and I
[1:37:05] might can help you along the way. I find
[1:37:08] that people's first reaction verbally is
[1:37:12] often I
[1:37:14] know. Have you ever noticed that? Watch
[1:37:17] your
[1:37:18] kids. Watch your kids. You'll learn from
[1:37:21] the three-year-old to the 30year-old.
[1:37:23] Watch them. You can't tell them anything
[1:37:26] that they don't
[1:37:27] already know. But the reality is you
[1:37:30] wouldn't be in the mess you're in.
[1:37:33] You wouldn't be in the squeeze you're in
[1:37:35] if you knew what you said you knew. All
[1:37:37] right.
[1:37:39] I find sometime that when you're trying
[1:37:41] to help people, especially those who
[1:37:43] come asking for help, that they're often
[1:37:47] not listening to what you're
[1:37:49] saying, they're they're often
[1:37:51] formulating what their reply is going to
[1:37:54] be. You know, a conversation would take
[1:37:57] twice as long if everybody would listen.
[1:38:02] Oh, I'm gonna help you.
[1:38:04] I'm going to help you in your
[1:38:05] relationships if you let me. It would be
[1:38:07] twice as long if everybody would listen
[1:38:10] first and then come up with your reply.
[1:38:14] Make sure you understand what's being
[1:38:16] said before you formulate your reply to
[1:38:20] what is being said. That's very
[1:38:22] important. And don't start a sentence
[1:38:24] with I
[1:38:26] know. If you just have to say I know,
[1:38:29] say I know you're right. Now pray for me
[1:38:33] that I can remember it when I'm in
[1:38:36] trouble.
[1:38:38] Because if you know, that means you
[1:38:40] always know. But the problem is
[1:38:42] sometimes in the heat of the battle, in
[1:38:45] the minute of the test, we forget what
[1:38:48] we know. That's why we have the Holy
[1:38:51] Ghost.
[1:38:54] I was reading this week where brother
[1:38:56] Brandham said, you know, uh the
[1:38:57] Pentecostal church, he said they've
[1:39:00] they've redefined uh uh so many things
[1:39:04] and and changed the way things are said.
[1:39:07] He said they always say Holy Spirit.
[1:39:09] Now, there's nothing wrong with saying
[1:39:12] Holy Spirit. That's what he is. He is
[1:39:15] the ruach
[1:39:17] hakodesesh which means the holy breath
[1:39:20] or the holy spirit of god or even holy
[1:39:23] wind of god. That's what he is. But he
[1:39:26] said they want to take that holy ghost
[1:39:29] and make it uh denominationally sound a
[1:39:33] little more appealing to those who
[1:39:35] haven't yet committed to the Pentecostal
[1:39:38] faith. And he said, "We ought not to be
[1:39:40] changing our vocabulary to make it more
[1:39:43] uh uh uh easy to make it easier for
[1:39:46] people to to endure it." He said, "We
[1:39:49] ought to stay with the word."
[1:39:52] Amen. So, I thought I would just throw
[1:39:55] that in. It's the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:39:59] and he's keeping me alive. Can you say
[1:40:02] amen to that? So, let's not be hotty.
[1:40:04] Let's not be arrogant. Let's not let our
[1:40:08] pride lead us. Destruction follow us.
[1:40:11] Here's here's three things. I think it's
[1:40:14] three why uh we should be uh uh watching
[1:40:18] constantly this subtle uh approach of
[1:40:21] pride. Number one, pride blinds you.
[1:40:24] When you're too proud, you might
[1:40:27] overestimate yourself, ignore good
[1:40:30] advice, or think you don't need help.
[1:40:33] That can lead
[1:40:35] to big mistakes. Remember I told you
[1:40:38] about the brother who was offended when
[1:40:41] I spoke to him about getting somewhere
[1:40:43] where he could get help. He said, "Oh
[1:40:45] yeah, you what makes you think we need
[1:40:47] help?" Because everybody needs help. And
[1:40:51] if you're not in a place where you can
[1:40:53] get help, you need to find a place where
[1:40:56] you can get help.
[1:41:00] Nobody's saying you're lost. It's just
[1:41:02] saying we all need God's help. I need
[1:41:04] him every day. Don't you? And number
[1:41:07] two, pride pushes people away.
[1:41:12] When someone is overconfident, which
[1:41:15] often times overconfidence can be a
[1:41:20] front for inferiority complex.
[1:41:24] Did you know some people come bashing
[1:41:26] into a conversation not because they're
[1:41:29] confident, but because they're they feel
[1:41:32] inferior and they
[1:41:34] overcompensate for their inferiority. So
[1:41:37] don't judge someone as prideful just
[1:41:41] because they come in like a bull in a
[1:41:44] china closet. There are also brain
[1:41:47] reasons and chemical reasons why some
[1:41:50] people don't know how to interact
[1:41:53] socially. And so sometimes they get
[1:41:56] misjudged as being prideful when the
[1:41:59] reality is they have a condition that's
[1:42:02] somewhere on the spectrum and they don't
[1:42:05] really know how to socially interact.
[1:42:08] Did you know there is a condition that
[1:42:10] is becoming more prevalent in the world
[1:42:12] that we live in today where people are
[1:42:15] are struggling chemically through the
[1:42:18] brain to feel remorse?
[1:42:23] There are certain levels of autism on
[1:42:26] the scale where the person dealing with
[1:42:30] that kind of condition cannot they they
[1:42:33] are seemingly unccapable of even
[1:42:37] registering remorse or sorrow for their
[1:42:41] behavior. Sometimes we might be guilty
[1:42:45] of misunderstanding someone who needs
[1:42:48] more than repentance and remorse. They
[1:42:51] need a rewiring.
[1:42:53] I want you to know we serve a creative
[1:42:55] God who's not only able to balance our
[1:42:58] hormones and our chemicals, but he's
[1:43:01] also able to rewire the circuits of our
[1:43:05] brain. Yes, sir. So, let's know if it's
[1:43:08] pride and let's recognize if it's just
[1:43:11] overcompensation for inferiority. You
[1:43:14] say you're focusing on complexes. Well,
[1:43:17] brother Brandham experienced complexes
[1:43:19] and confessed to us that they were a
[1:43:21] part of his life. And with with the help
[1:43:24] of the Lord and by the truth of God's
[1:43:27] word, he overcame those complexes. And
[1:43:30] you and I can too. Don't make more of
[1:43:34] something than there is really lying
[1:43:36] there.
[1:43:39] As much as possible, live
[1:43:43] peaceable with all men.
[1:43:47] Just do your best to get
[1:43:49] along and don't dare judge someone
[1:43:53] else's motives.
[1:43:55] You may see what they've done. You may
[1:43:58] know that according to the word, what
[1:44:00] they've done is wrong, but that does not
[1:44:02] give us permission to judge someone's
[1:44:06] motives for what they've done. Arrogance
[1:44:10] annoys others.
[1:44:15] Pride is so intricately connected to
[1:44:19] rejection. And then pride and arrogancy
[1:44:22] is one of the reasons why people
[1:44:24] continue to be
[1:44:26] rejected. It's an overcompensation
[1:44:28] again. It's working too hard to be
[1:44:32] accepted. How many of you want the Lord
[1:44:34] to just welcome you as his child? If the
[1:44:37] Lord loves you, if the Lord accepts you,
[1:44:40] if the Lord is okay with you,
[1:44:45] you may never convince some people how
[1:44:47] wonderful you are.
[1:44:50] But if the Lord loves you, you may never
[1:44:53] be able to convince some people you're
[1:44:56] normal. But if the Lord loves you and if
[1:45:00] he accepts you, don't quit working on
[1:45:02] yourself. Don't quit trying to improve
[1:45:05] things. scripturally in your life. But
[1:45:09] be careful that in your arrogancy,
[1:45:11] you're not pushing others away because
[1:45:14] then you lose support and you start
[1:45:17] making enemies who might work against
[1:45:20] you. And then the final pride invites
[1:45:23] trouble. Both people and God according
[1:45:26] to the Bible resist the proud. God
[1:45:29] resists the proud and people resist the
[1:45:32] proud. When we see somebody operating in
[1:45:34] untethered pride, we want them we want
[1:45:37] to teach them
[1:45:40] something. Not you, just me. We want to
[1:45:44] teach them something. We We want to see
[1:45:46] them come down a notch or two. The
[1:45:48] problem is they don't belong to us.
[1:45:52] They're his
[1:45:54] and let him take care of his own. In
[1:45:57] short, if you're full of pride or you
[1:45:59] act superior, you're walking straight
[1:46:01] toward a downfall, whether it's losing
[1:46:04] something important like a job or a
[1:46:06] relationship or your reputation. So,
[1:46:09] check up regularly that your offense is
[1:46:13] not just something rooted in pride and
[1:46:15] can easily be healed and let go of by
[1:46:18] the grace of the Lord. Paul warned us in
[1:46:22] 2 Corinthians 12 and verse 6 about
[1:46:27] selfexaltation. Sometimes we need
[1:46:30] recognition. Sometimes we need a title.
[1:46:33] It's so popular in the Pentecostal and
[1:46:35] charismatic world today to put your
[1:46:37] five-fold ministry office on the card.
[1:46:40] You know, prophet so and so, apostle so
[1:46:43] and so, evangelist so and so, pastor
[1:46:46] even so and so. It's not necessary to
[1:46:49] announce your calling.
[1:46:52] It's not necessary. When I traveled
[1:46:54] among the charismatics, everybody who
[1:46:56] approached me would approach me the same
[1:46:58] way. They wanted to tell me a dream or a
[1:47:00] vision or a feeling or an experience or
[1:47:03] sensation or a zipper that buzzed or
[1:47:06] something. They all wanted to tell us
[1:47:08] something, but they all turned me off
[1:47:13] because they approached me this way.
[1:47:15] Now, brother Shelly, I'm a very
[1:47:17] spiritual person.
[1:47:22] Burp. Anybody ever seen The Family Feud
[1:47:25] years ago?
[1:47:27] Burp. Wrong answer. When somebody has to
[1:47:30] come up and tell you how spiritual they
[1:47:33] are, there's something in me that says,
[1:47:36] "Uh-uh." Cuz spiritual people don't have
[1:47:38] to announce they're spiritual.
[1:47:41] Spiritual people are just who they are
[1:47:43] and they just live who they are. Come on
[1:47:46] now. They don't have to go around
[1:47:47] telling everybody how spiritual they
[1:47:50] are. There's a reason for that. That's
[1:47:52] some more of that inferiority. That's
[1:47:54] some more of that needing some self. You
[1:47:56] You need to be exalted a little bit. So,
[1:47:58] you're helping the Lord out. Look at 2
[1:48:00] Corinthians 12 and 6. For though I would
[1:48:03] desire to glory, I shall not be a fool.
[1:48:06] This is the greatest apostle of all
[1:48:09] times here.
[1:48:10] And and here's what he said. I shall not
[1:48:13] be as a fool, for I will say the truth,
[1:48:15] but now I forebear, lest any man should
[1:48:18] think of me above that which he seeth me
[1:48:20] to be, or that he heareth of me, and
[1:48:23] lest I should be exalted above measure
[1:48:28] through the abundance of the
[1:48:30] revelations.
[1:48:32] There was given to me, help me, a thorn
[1:48:36] in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to
[1:48:41] buffet me, lest I should be.
[1:48:46] God gave Paul a thorn in the
[1:48:50] flesh, a messenger of Satan to remind
[1:48:54] him of his humanity when he started
[1:48:58] getting fluffed up because of believing
[1:49:01] the message.
[1:49:04] God allowed a thorn, a messenger to
[1:49:07] come. Some people believe it was a a a
[1:49:11] problem with his eyesight.
[1:49:14] I'm not sure that's what he's talking
[1:49:16] about since he specifically calls
[1:49:18] whatever this is the messenger of
[1:49:22] Satan to buffet me. It makes me wonder
[1:49:25] if it wasn't a companion gone sour, a
[1:49:29] friend, an associate in ministry. I
[1:49:31] don't know exactly what it was. For
[1:49:34] anyone to say they know would be
[1:49:36] speculation because the scripture
[1:49:38] doesn't tell us. But whatever it was, it
[1:49:42] kept
[1:49:43] Paul firmly footed on the ground when he
[1:49:47] wanted to get a little high up and a
[1:49:50] little high and mighty over the
[1:49:51] revelation that God was giving him. That
[1:49:54] word exalted there in the Greek, it
[1:49:57] means, and it's a long word. Look how
[1:50:00] long that word is in in Greek. And it
[1:50:04] means to lift or raise up over something
[1:50:08] to lift oneself up to beaughty to carry
[1:50:12] oneselfily to behave in
[1:50:20] solit. The reason why I'm wondering if
[1:50:23] it is more than just a physical
[1:50:26] infirmity. The word that is used there
[1:50:29] is the
[1:50:30] angelos. It's the same word that means a
[1:50:32] messenger. an envoy, one who is sent,
[1:50:37] especially an angel by implication in
[1:50:40] the positive, a pastor, a messenger from
[1:50:43] God. But the reality is this was one
[1:50:47] sent by Satan to keep Paul on the
[1:50:51] ground. I want you to know that I can
[1:50:55] assure you God's still doing it. That's
[1:50:58] right.
[1:51:00] I'm here to testify to you that he still
[1:51:03] sent God is still sending
[1:51:06] messengers of Satan to buffet the
[1:51:09] servants of God to keep them from
[1:51:11] getting a little too big for their
[1:51:13] britches. Is that all right to use that
[1:51:15] kind of language? Well, how would you
[1:51:17] know, brother Shel? Cuz I have my
[1:51:19] own and I have had some through the
[1:51:22] years. In the message, the queen of the
[1:51:25] south, brother Brandham said, "You see
[1:51:27] what pride and
[1:51:30] selfishness
[1:51:33] does? It shuts you
[1:51:37] out from the kingdom of God." Does
[1:51:40] anybody find that to be a little
[1:51:43] heavy? My pride, my selfishness keeps me
[1:51:49] on the outside of the kingdom looking
[1:51:52] in. How many of you want to live on the
[1:51:54] outside looking in? No, we want to live
[1:51:56] on the inside of the kingdom of God
[1:51:59] looking out. Live the life of an
[1:52:01] overcomer. And in the message Jehovah
[1:52:05] Gyra, Brother Benham said, "What ought
[1:52:07] all our conduct to be? Not like the
[1:52:10] world, but we should act like sons and
[1:52:13] daughters of God. conduct ourselves like
[1:52:16] king's children, not like slaves of
[1:52:19] fashions and slaves of passion and
[1:52:22] slaves of pride. We should be what? Sons
[1:52:26] and daughters of God and act like it and
[1:52:30] conduct ourselves that way. Let our
[1:52:33] conversations and everything be seasoned
[1:52:37] with God's spirit. Isn't that a
[1:52:40] wonderful quotation? Turn to Romans
[1:52:42] chapter 1 with me this morning because I
[1:52:45] want to show you quickly the link
[1:52:49] between pride, offense, and
[1:52:52] deception. Romans chapter 1 verse 21
[1:52:56] through32 said, "Because that when they
[1:52:58] knew
[1:52:59] God, they glorified him not as God,
[1:53:05] neither were thankful." They knew
[1:53:09] God, but they glorified him not as God.
[1:53:13] Neither were they thankful, but became
[1:53:17] vain, proud, hotty, arrogant in their
[1:53:22] what? Imaginations. And their foolish
[1:53:26] heart was darkened. This shows us the
[1:53:30] connection between pride, offense, and
[1:53:33] deception. their foolish heart was
[1:53:37] darkened. Then he goes
[1:53:40] on, professing themselves to be
[1:53:44] wise.
[1:53:48] They didn't say they started off as
[1:53:50] fools.
[1:53:52] It said they were bragging on how wise
[1:53:55] they were. And the more they bragged on
[1:53:57] how wise they were, how much wisdom they
[1:54:00] had, the the the dumber they became.
[1:54:03] They became like fools. Paul said, "You
[1:54:07] should see the the context." If you
[1:54:10] don't know the context of Romans 1, some
[1:54:12] of you know it automatically. If you
[1:54:14] don't know the context of Romans 1,
[1:54:16] you're going to get a touch of it right
[1:54:17] now. They became like fools. They
[1:54:19] bragged about their wisdom. They became
[1:54:22] like fools. And look at what happened.
[1:54:24] This is a really a description of Sodom
[1:54:27] and Gomorrah.
[1:54:28] You see, they they they knew
[1:54:31] God, but they didn't care to keep him
[1:54:34] around to worship him or acknowledge him
[1:54:37] as God. And they were not thankful for
[1:54:41] the benefit and the blessing and the
[1:54:44] provision of God. They bragged about
[1:54:46] their wisdom until they became fools.
[1:54:49] And this was the natural
[1:54:52] progression. This is a serious
[1:54:54] indictment. Hear it. This is a serious
[1:54:57] subject here. We won't stay here long.
[1:55:00] And they changed the glory of the
[1:55:04] uncorruptible God into an image made
[1:55:08] like to corruptible man and to birds and
[1:55:13] for-footed beasts and creeping things.
[1:55:16] They they recreated God.
[1:55:20] They formed a God that was more like
[1:55:23] them
[1:55:25] than the God of the Bible. Did you know
[1:55:28] that's the very motive of religion in
[1:55:30] this hour? To recreate a God in the
[1:55:33] image of man. That's true.
[1:55:36] That's not what happened in the
[1:55:38] beginning. In the beginning, God made a
[1:55:40] man in the image of God and a man fell.
[1:55:45] And so God came down and walked as a man
[1:55:49] that he might restore man back to the
[1:55:53] place of authority that he was given in
[1:55:55] the beginning made in the image and the
[1:55:59] likeness of almighty God. A God with a
[1:56:03] little G. The prophet tells us a God
[1:56:06] with a portion of deity in him. A man
[1:56:10] with a portion of deity in him making
[1:56:13] him a little G God. Somebody said, "That
[1:56:15] just gives me a lot of creepies." Well,
[1:56:17] I want you to know it's scriptural.
[1:56:20] I'm not sure where your creepies come
[1:56:22] from, but it's scriptural. It's so
[1:56:24] scriptural that the New Testament tells
[1:56:26] us that those who receive that
[1:56:28] transformation will have the power to
[1:56:31] forgive sin
[1:56:33] or to retain sin.
[1:56:37] These are the ambassadors of God in the
[1:56:40] end time. These are the God men of the
[1:56:43] last age. And we can say and women
[1:56:46] because this is not a genderless
[1:56:48] message. This is the manifestation of
[1:56:51] the sons of God that the world gets so
[1:56:54] bent out of shape on because perhaps
[1:56:56] okay it has been taken out of context
[1:56:59] and misused. But the reality is the
[1:57:02] same. The scripture tells us that all of
[1:57:04] creation is groaning for the full
[1:57:09] manifestation of the God men,
[1:57:13] the sons of God to come forth. Oh,
[1:57:17] they're the children of the
[1:57:18] manchild. They are the offspring of the
[1:57:22] of the original, the one who who became
[1:57:25] the perfect one.
[1:57:29] Right, brother? He wasn't the perfect
[1:57:30] one. As soon as he condescended into
[1:57:33] flesh, he was then no longer 100%
[1:57:37] perfect. His spirit was his flesh not.
[1:57:42] That's why the Bible said, "Though he
[1:57:43] were a son,
[1:57:46] yet he had to learn." Yes. He learned
[1:57:49] perfection
[1:57:50] by the things he suffered. Oh, what an
[1:57:54] example, folks. God loved us so much. He
[1:57:58] loved us so much. He loved us so much in
[1:58:01] the beginning that he he devised a plan
[1:58:04] that that's the greatest plan. It's the
[1:58:06] best deal. I'm telling you, if you don't
[1:58:08] want no part of it, you are losing out.
[1:58:10] You are missing out, brother. This
[1:58:12] relationship with God to become what he
[1:58:14] created us to be in the beginning. It's
[1:58:16] a process. It's a battle. It's not all
[1:58:19] easy. It's full of hard knocks and high
[1:58:21] places and low places and curves in the
[1:58:23] road and valleys and mountain tops and
[1:58:25] hills and es and flow in the river flow.
[1:58:28] all that all that stuff.
[1:58:31] And yet it's worth it all to be made
[1:58:34] like him. So they just started making
[1:58:37] God in the images that they were
[1:58:40] familiar with. Let's make him more like
[1:58:42] a man, corruptible. Let's let's let's
[1:58:45] make him like a bird.
[1:58:48] Let's let's let's put foroot on him.
[1:58:50] Let's make him a beast. Let's make him
[1:58:53] like a creeping thing. This is what
[1:58:55] Greek mythology and Roman mythology did.
[1:58:58] Let's make God more like a creature.
[1:59:01] Pull him down so we can understand him.
[1:59:04] You don't have to pull God down to
[1:59:05] understand him. He came down. He
[1:59:09] condescended so that you could be filled
[1:59:12] with who he is. Are you here? All right.
[1:59:16] So then after they began to do that,
[1:59:18] making these creeping images and so
[1:59:20] forth, it said, "Wherefore God also gave
[1:59:22] them up to
[1:59:25] uncleanness through the lusts of their
[1:59:28] own hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[1:59:33] between themselves." When you pull God
[1:59:36] down to a fallen, corruptible man, when
[1:59:38] you pull God down and make him like a
[1:59:40] beast and you want to be like that, God
[1:59:44] said, "Go ahead. just do whatever you'll
[1:59:47] do and they did and they began to uh
[1:59:51] absolutely defile their own bodies in
[1:59:54] the way they behaved. If God is now in
[1:59:58] the image of a creature, then filthy
[2:00:01] false religions begin to have filthy
[2:00:05] false
[2:00:06] associations with animals. That's right.
[2:00:10] Goes all the way back to
[2:00:13] Leviticus. It's it's rotten.
[2:00:16] It's sickening.
[2:00:19] But it's reality. And why did it exist?
[2:00:23] Because man kept wanting to put God in
[2:00:25] something that he could relate to. The
[2:00:27] next thing he becomes attracted to where
[2:00:29] he has placed his God and he starts
[2:00:32] behaving like an absolute animal. Some
[2:00:35] animals have more sense than a man who
[2:00:38] falls into this kind of a category. He
[2:00:41] said, "Who changed the truth of God into
[2:00:44] a lie and worshiped and served the
[2:00:46] creature the creature more than the
[2:00:51] creator who is blessed forever." Amen.
[2:00:54] For this
[2:00:55] cause, again, this is an indictment of
[2:00:58] Sodom and Gomorrah. It's an indictment
[2:01:00] of the United States of America. It's an
[2:01:03] indictment of the hour that we're living
[2:01:04] in right now. For this cause God gave
[2:01:08] them up unto vile affections. For even
[2:01:11] their women did change the natural use
[2:01:15] into that which
[2:01:23] is what if I told you that the cutting
[2:01:25] of the
[2:01:27] hair is speaking of the same thing.
[2:01:34] It's against nature.
[2:01:37] It's here is a woman so fallen that
[2:01:41] she's changing the natural use of her
[2:01:45] body and the relationship that God has
[2:01:49] created for intimacy and reproduction.
[2:01:55] It has now taken her out of her own
[2:01:58] nature and it is working that which is
[2:02:01] not natural. That's right. Come on. And
[2:02:05] in the same way that it's blending the
[2:02:08] gender, then the the the the difference
[2:02:11] in the hair, it it goes on. It it just
[2:02:15] keeps progressing on and on and on. I I
[2:02:18] don't I don't apologize for making it
[2:02:20] that plain because that's exactly right.
[2:02:23] Uh he goes on, "And likewise also the
[2:02:27] men leaving the natural use of the woman
[2:02:30] burned in their lust one toward another
[2:02:32] men with men working that which is
[2:02:34] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[2:02:37] that recompense of their error which was
[2:02:42] meat. There's a judgment. I'm I'm sorry
[2:02:45] to say it's scriptural though to say
[2:02:47] there's a
[2:02:49] judgment. It's both physical and
[2:02:51] spiritual. the judgment. And even as
[2:02:54] they did not like to retain God in their
[2:02:56] knowledge, how did they get in this
[2:02:58] condition? How did the world even open
[2:03:00] this kind of a thing up? It's because
[2:03:03] forefathers, those ahead of us, found
[2:03:06] themselves in this kind of position.
[2:03:08] This is not a new thing. This isn't this
[2:03:11] isn't 20th century or 21st century. This
[2:03:14] goes all the way back to the beginning.
[2:03:16] And even as they did not like to retain
[2:03:19] God knowledge, God in in their
[2:03:21] knowledge, God gave them over to a
[2:03:23] reprobate mind to continue, we could
[2:03:26] say, to do those things which are not
[2:03:29] convenient. And they are not godly and
[2:03:33] they are celebrated in our society and
[2:03:36] it's a battle being filled with all
[2:03:39] unrighteousness, fornication,
[2:03:41] wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[2:03:43] full of envy and murder and debate and
[2:03:45] deceit and malignity and whisperers. It
[2:03:48] goes on. Whisperers,
[2:03:52] even backbiters, haters of
[2:03:55] God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
[2:03:58] inventors of evil things, disobedient to
[2:04:01] parents. I always find it to be strange
[2:04:04] that God tucked that in there through
[2:04:06] the apostle. We're talking about all
[2:04:08] kinds of filthy, horrible, damnable
[2:04:11] things. We're talking about illicit
[2:04:14] sexuality, perversion,
[2:04:17] etc. And right in there, disobedient
[2:04:22] parents. Did somebody make a mistake?
[2:04:26] No. It's part of the same barrel. God's
[2:04:29] saying rebellion is rebellion, and I'm
[2:04:31] going to deal with it. God is saying
[2:04:34] that rebellion is rebellion, sir. God is
[2:04:37] saying disrespect is disrespect. Amen.
[2:04:39] And there is an outworking of it. There
[2:04:42] is an end to it. It just keeps going and
[2:04:44] going and going until it ends up in a
[2:04:46] place where you would never desire to be
[2:04:49] without understanding, covenant
[2:04:50] breakers, without natural affection,
[2:04:52] implacable, unmerciful, who knowing the
[2:04:55] judgment of God, that they which commit
[2:04:57] such things are worthy of death, not
[2:04:59] only do the
[2:05:04] same, but have pleasure in them that do
[2:05:08] them.
[2:05:10] Paul is taking this a step
[2:05:12] further and he's saying you by
[2:05:16] default can fall under a same
[2:05:20] judgment by taking pleasure by taking
[2:05:27] fellowship with those who do these
[2:05:31] things. I didn't write the book. I'm not
[2:05:35] even interpreting it. I'm just actually
[2:05:37] sort of reading it to you. Are you with
[2:05:39] me? And we're moving on. 2 Thessalonians
[2:05:42] chapter 2 10 and 12. And with all
[2:05:45] deceivleness of unrighteousness in them
[2:05:47] that perish because they receive not the
[2:05:49] love of the truth that they might be
[2:05:51] saved. And for this cause God shall send
[2:05:54] them strong delusion that they should
[2:05:56] believe a lie that all might be damned
[2:05:58] who believe not the truth but had
[2:06:00] pleasure here it is again in
[2:06:03] unrighteousness.
[2:06:05] What we find out when we just when we
[2:06:07] really study what happened and the
[2:06:10] progression of the behavior in Sodom and
[2:06:13] Gomorrah, we find out that homosexuality
[2:06:17] was not the original problem. The
[2:06:19] original problem was pride.
[2:06:23] When you fall into pride, there is a
[2:06:27] natural progression of development.
[2:06:30] And that's when you begin to see the
[2:06:33] creature as having more importance than
[2:06:36] the creator.
[2:06:39] Now, there's nothing wrong with working
[2:06:41] out. There's nothing wrong with having a
[2:06:44] a healthy and strong body. But you need
[2:06:46] to understand that Paul, who wrote these
[2:06:49] words, was aware that they're spiritual
[2:06:52] exercises that are way more important.
[2:06:58] I'm just going to wait a minute.
[2:07:01] There are spiritual exercises with far
[2:07:04] greater results than in the natural.
[2:07:08] That's why Paul said to Timothy, "Bodily
[2:07:10] exercise profitth little." It didn't
[2:07:12] mean that it's not a good idea to move
[2:07:14] your body to stay healthy and and and to
[2:07:18] keep your joints lubricated. That's a
[2:07:21] great idea if you want to move around
[2:07:23] while you're on Earth. It's a good thing
[2:07:25] to do unless you want to be in the bed
[2:07:27] the last few years of your life. It's a
[2:07:29] good thing to do. But there are things
[2:07:31] that are if you're looking at eternal
[2:07:33] value and you're looking at that which
[2:07:35] is really valuable in life, there are
[2:07:39] spiritual exercises, praying, reading
[2:07:41] your Bible, worshiping God, staying
[2:07:43] connected to him in a relationship that
[2:07:46] are far more important than that. You
[2:07:49] see, the whole word gymnasium goes back
[2:07:51] to false religion.
[2:07:55] It goes all the way back to Roman
[2:07:58] culture. Homosexuality was the rage. The
[2:08:01] richer you are, the more the more
[2:08:03] involved you
[2:08:06] were. And the problem with all of that
[2:08:09] is they they
[2:08:11] obsessed. They so obsessed and drove
[2:08:14] themselves to the
[2:08:15] gymnasiums of their day. That's how the
[2:08:18] whole Olympic thing started. It started
[2:08:21] as a part of false religion.
[2:08:25] It wasn't just uh uh you know innocent
[2:08:27] competition.
[2:08:29] It started as a part of false religion.
[2:08:31] Man began to see himself as so
[2:08:33] good-looking.
[2:08:38] I I read an article one time about when
[2:08:41] mirrors were first added to men's
[2:08:46] gymnasiums so that men could look at
[2:08:48] themselves. And when I say themselves, I
[2:08:51] don't just mean their beard.
[2:08:53] I mean themselves
[2:08:57] and they worked to to look better in the
[2:08:59] mirror in pagan culture. They did it
[2:09:03] with such a spirit that did not like to
[2:09:07] retain God and godliness until they fell
[2:09:09] in love with the image of their own body
[2:09:11] and that's what led them to
[2:09:12] homosexuality.
[2:09:14] The sin of homosexuality is a it's
[2:09:17] rooted in pride.
[2:09:21] And it goes all the way back to the
[2:09:23] worship of the creation instead of the
[2:09:25] creator. Somebody said, "What's that got
[2:09:27] to do with it? Why are you even bringing
[2:09:29] this out on when you're talking about
[2:09:30] pride?" Because that's what happens.
[2:09:32] Pride goeth before
[2:09:36] it leads the way for destruction. Not
[2:09:39] just a fall, but destruction. And this
[2:09:42] is how it all comes together. The
[2:09:44] connection between arrogance, pride,
[2:09:46] hottiness, and offense. Arrogance is an
[2:09:48] exaggerated sense of one's own
[2:09:50] importance or abilities, often leading
[2:09:52] to disregard for others. I I'm sickened
[2:09:55] by the fact that people constantly talk
[2:09:57] about they're better than someone
[2:10:00] else. I'm better than you are. I'm
[2:10:02] better than you are. I'm better at that
[2:10:03] than you are. I do better at that than
[2:10:05] you do. Why don't you just toot your own
[2:10:08] horn?
[2:10:10] Oh, that's what you're already doing.
[2:10:13] Why don't you just stop tooting your own
[2:10:15] horn? The Bible tells us, "Let somebody
[2:10:17] else praise you."
[2:10:20] Let somebody else tell how wonderful you
[2:10:22] are.
[2:10:25] Watch preachers, we're the
[2:10:28] worst. Let somebody else tell you how
[2:10:31] wonderful you are. Don't let that I'm
[2:10:33] just kidding. I'm just joking. It's just
[2:10:35] a joke. It's all in fun. We don't mean
[2:10:37] anything by you.
[2:10:40] Don't let Let let me see how hard it
[2:10:42] would be for you to stop bragging on
[2:10:44] yourself. I shot a so and so. I hit a so
[2:10:47] and so. I did such and such and so many
[2:10:50] yards.
[2:10:52] What? My mind doesn't even work that
[2:10:54] way. You could tell me 50 yards. I don't
[2:10:56] even know how far that is. I'd have to
[2:10:58] walk it
[2:11:00] off. I can't just look out through the
[2:11:02] yard and see it like some of you can. I
[2:11:05] did this and I did that and I'm the best
[2:11:07] at disc golf and I'm the best at
[2:11:09] volleyball and I'm the best
[2:11:12] at and I'm in the gym seven days a week
[2:11:15] and I can lift, you know, I can bench
[2:11:19] lift 390 lbs
[2:11:23] and you better do it in proper form or
[2:11:26] you're going to have problems that are
[2:11:28] going to embarrass you one of these
[2:11:32] days. And they have to start cutting
[2:11:35] them out of you. You know those You know
[2:11:38] what I'm talking about, don't you?
[2:11:39] Straining like that. And it's like
[2:11:41] having a baby. Hello.
[2:11:45] We get so caught up.
[2:11:48] We get so caught
[2:11:50] up. We've got to catch ourselves here.
[2:11:54] He said arrogance isn't exaggerated.
[2:11:56] Listen. Listen. everybody else in a in a
[2:11:59] picture
[2:12:01] smiling and you look like you could spit
[2:12:04] a ten penny nail. You think that's
[2:12:08] cute? I
[2:12:10] don't. I find it to be a an attribute of
[2:12:19] pride. It's like when you knock somebody
[2:12:21] down trying to get in the
[2:12:24] door. We got to watch these things. They
[2:12:27] may be very innocent now, but according
[2:12:29] to the scripture, they lead to deception
[2:12:32] and eventually a perversion
[2:12:35] that causes great
[2:12:38] judgment. I know that seems a little
[2:12:40] rough, but it's it's just right. It's
[2:12:43] right. It's right. I can go back to
[2:12:45] North
[2:12:47] Carolina. I was offered a church
[2:12:50] Wednesday. I don't have to be here. I'm
[2:12:53] here because I want to be here. Because
[2:12:55] God called me here.
[2:12:57] But you're going to have to take I'm not
[2:12:58] an evangelist when I'm here.
[2:13:01] I've been told this week more than once
[2:13:04] I I never heard that. Brother Shelley
[2:13:07] preaching while we were away. That's
[2:13:08] because I was doing the work of an
[2:13:10] evangelist.
[2:13:13] An evangelist chills and thrills and
[2:13:16] then leaves and the pastor has the real
[2:13:19] work. That's right.
[2:13:23] That's
[2:13:24] right. That's right. I've seen it right
[2:13:26] here in our own church and evangelists
[2:13:28] come and say less than what I say and
[2:13:31] get 10 times the
[2:13:35] reaction. I just it don't even you can't
[2:13:37] even let it hurt your feelings. It's a
[2:13:39] difference in the offices. I don't
[2:13:42] believe pastors should be gone all the
[2:13:44] time, but I think it's absolutely
[2:13:46] healthy and in order for a pastor to go
[2:13:48] and preach to somebody else on occasion.
[2:13:50] It causes so many different little
[2:13:53] reconnections. It causes you, a pastor,
[2:13:55] to appreciate the people that he has,
[2:13:58] unless he comes home and they're all
[2:14:02] asleep. It brings out more giftings in
[2:14:05] him that he hasn't used in a while. And
[2:14:07] it's good to encourage another group of
[2:14:09] people and you pull out all your
[2:14:11] wonderful phrases and you do all the
[2:14:13] things that you know the wows,
[2:14:16] but it takes more than that to steward a
[2:14:20] body week after week after week. Amen.
[2:14:24] Okay. It says now it's closely tied to
[2:14:26] pride. Arrogance is an exaggerated sense
[2:14:29] of one's own importance or abilities
[2:14:30] often leading to disregard for others.
[2:14:32] It is closely tied to pride and
[2:14:34] hottiness which when unchecked lead to
[2:14:36] offense and spiritual bondage. The Bible
[2:14:38] warns against arrogance and its
[2:14:40] consequences. Look at Proverbs chapter
[2:14:44] uh 8 and verse uh 13, excuse me. The
[2:14:47] fear of the Lord, the fear of the Lord
[2:14:50] is to hate evil. The fear of the Lord is
[2:14:53] to hate
[2:14:54] evil. The fear of the Lord is to hate
[2:14:57] evil.
[2:14:59] Pride and
[2:15:01] arrogancy. And the evil way and the
[2:15:04] forward mouth. God said do I
[2:15:08] hate. That word arrogancy is ga. It's
[2:15:11] the same word we used just a moment ago
[2:15:13] for pride. The exact same word. Now,
[2:15:17] Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13 in the
[2:15:20] amplified. Look at it here. The reverent
[2:15:22] fear and worshipful awe of the Lord
[2:15:27] includes the hatred of evil, pride,
[2:15:30] arrogance, the evil way, and perverted
[2:15:33] and twisted speech. I hate this is not a
[2:15:36] mistransation. It's actually absolutely
[2:15:39] proper and in line with the original
[2:15:40] Greek to tie the two together. The fear
[2:15:43] of the Lord is to worship him and to
[2:15:46] have reverential respect and awe of the
[2:15:49] greatness of our mighty God. But
[2:15:51] connected to that is we must also hate
[2:15:54] evil.
[2:15:56] We must also hate what pride does. We
[2:15:59] must also hate the arrogancy that tries
[2:16:02] to creep up in our life. It's an evil
[2:16:04] way. It's a perverted way. I just showed
[2:16:06] you in Romans and Thessalonians. It's a
[2:16:08] perverted way. Satan is not a creator.
[2:16:13] He's just a perverter. Are you with me?
[2:16:16] Good. Romans
[2:16:18] 12:3. We've covered five whole pages.
[2:16:21] We're doing amazing. For I say through
[2:16:23] the grace given unto me to every man
[2:16:25] that is among you, not to think of
[2:16:28] himself more highly than he ought to
[2:16:29] think.
[2:16:33] And I want you to know that means even
[2:16:34] your problems, even your troubles, even
[2:16:37] your
[2:16:39] struggles when you have to have a prayer
[2:16:42] chain because you've got
[2:16:51] roaches. You want everybody's attention
[2:16:54] called to your pest problem. You've got
[2:16:58] you've got some options here.
[2:17:01] Pray for
[2:17:02] yourself. Call your closest prayer
[2:17:07] partner and either come off a hundred
[2:17:10] bucks and have an exterminator come or
[2:17:14] buy you a big can of
[2:17:16] raid. It's not a spiritual
[2:17:23] crisis. We should be careful how we
[2:17:27] think of ourselves. See, this is not how
[2:17:29] we look at this. We look at it as like,
[2:17:31] oh my, nobody's No, no, no. That's not
[2:17:33] the only thing. I've I've been I've dug
[2:17:35] so deep down into pride. I have found so
[2:17:38] many ways that pride creeps in my own
[2:17:41] life until I'm
[2:17:43] flabbergasted because you wouldn't
[2:17:45] necessarily perhaps see yourself as a
[2:17:47] prideful person until you realize that
[2:17:49] it means way more than just walking
[2:17:52] around like you're the the the top dog,
[2:17:55] right?
[2:17:58] Kill your roaches and come on back to
[2:18:03] church. Make up your mind. I don't have
[2:18:06] to have all the focus on me. I don't
[2:18:09] have to have everybody looking at me and
[2:18:10] thinking about me all the time. Make you
[2:18:13] a prayer list, folks. Pray over that
[2:18:15] prayer list. Love one another. Pray for
[2:18:17] one another. Don't be embarrassed to
[2:18:18] call somebody for prayer. That's not
[2:18:21] what I'm saying. But I'm saying don't
[2:18:24] ever think that your way is so hard that
[2:18:28] you're the only one that could make it.
[2:18:32] We're all in a battle. I want I said
[2:18:34] this whole time I was gone. We're all in
[2:18:37] a battle. And the way we really win is
[2:18:40] by really focusing on somebody else's
[2:18:42] battle. Getting our mind off of our own
[2:18:45] battle and helping somebody else get up
[2:18:48] a little bit. That's good preaching
[2:18:50] anyway. But we get mad. We get a little
[2:18:55] offended. Yeah. Not to think of himself
[2:18:58] more highly than he ought to think, but
[2:18:59] to think
[2:19:01] soberly according as God hath dealt to
[2:19:03] every man the measure of faith. You
[2:19:05] heard that? That word soberly is the
[2:19:08] Greek word 493 in Strongs. And it says,
[2:19:11] "Be in the right mind." Think in your
[2:19:14] right
[2:19:15] mind. And it says, "What's next?"
[2:19:17] Somebody read it next. To exercise what?
[2:19:24] self-control. To put a moderate estimate
[2:19:27] upon oneself, to think of oneself
[2:19:30] soberly with a right mind, to curb one's
[2:19:35] passions, to realize that we're all
[2:19:40] tempted as our Lord was tempted. And how
[2:19:43] did he
[2:19:44] overcome? Without sin, by the word. The
[2:19:48] anointed ones at the end time. Paragraph
[2:19:50] 285. Not that we disagree with you,
[2:19:53] brother, to be different. Many of you
[2:19:54] here might be trinitarian preachers.
[2:19:57] Why, Lord of mercy, I was shocked after
[2:19:59] my service Wednesday night. The two
[2:20:01] women who amen me the most looked as
[2:20:03] looked the most godly. They told me
[2:20:05] later they were trinitarian women and
[2:20:07] maybe even preachers. I said, "Well,
[2:20:09] praise God for them cuz I needed their
[2:20:14] amens." They did look a little funny. I
[2:20:16] didn't know who they were. They did look
[2:20:17] a little funny when I said come to the
[2:20:19] water and be baptized in the only
[2:20:20] Christian baptism in the name of the
[2:20:22] Lord Jesus Christ. They did look a
[2:20:23] little funny
[2:20:25] then. But I needed their help. He said,
[2:20:28] "Not that we disagree with you, brother,
[2:20:29] to be different." Many of you here might
[2:20:31] be trinitarian preachers. We don't want
[2:20:32] to be angry with you. We love you. If we
[2:20:35] didn't, if I didn't believe that, I'd
[2:20:36] never leave the church till I got down
[2:20:38] there on my knees and said,
[2:20:40] "God, make me right." How many of you
[2:20:43] think that'd be good for all of us to do
[2:20:44] before we go home today? Just a few
[2:20:46] seconds on our knees.
[2:20:50] God, I don't want that arrogant. This is
[2:20:52] Brother Brandham. I don't want that
[2:20:53] arrogant, selfish spirit mixed up with
[2:20:57] mine.
[2:20:58] I want my spirit to be pure and clean,
[2:21:02] brotherly love, holy with the Holy
[2:21:05] Spirit. Now, if someone does anything
[2:21:08] wrong to
[2:21:12] me, hello
[2:21:19] You all looking this
[2:21:20] way? Anybody resembling this remark?
[2:21:24] Now, if anyone does anything wrong to
[2:21:30] me, huh? That's all
[2:21:36] right. That's all
[2:21:38] right. They did worse to my Lord.
[2:21:45] I ain't never going to speak to that. I
[2:21:47] ain't never going to do give a I ain't
[2:21:49] never going to try to help that. I
[2:21:56] ain't That's all right. He
[2:21:59] said, "If someone does anything to
[2:22:04] me, that's all
[2:22:07] right. That's all right.
[2:22:10] And though I might have the right to get
[2:22:12] back at
[2:22:15] them. And though I might have the right
[2:22:17] to get back at them, let me see you.
[2:22:22] And though I might have the right to get
[2:22:24] back at them, I don't want that in my
[2:22:26] life.
[2:22:29] It's exhausting, Sister Flo. It's
[2:22:32] exhausting to think you got to work to
[2:22:33] get somebody back for what they did. I
[2:22:35] got to teach him a lesson.
[2:22:37] Like I've always said, I've got to give
[2:22:39] her a piece of my mind. You be careful,
[2:22:41] honey. You're running
[2:22:42] short. You better hold on to every piece
[2:22:45] of your mind you got. No, you don't have
[2:22:48] to get nobody back. No, you don't have
[2:22:50] to give anybody a piece of your mind.
[2:22:52] No, you don't have to speak your peace.
[2:22:54] No,
[2:22:56] he said, I want to have love. I want to
[2:22:58] be ready to correct with love. With love
[2:23:01] that absolutely answers out yonder for
[2:23:03] it.
[2:23:05] There's coming an answer. We're going to
[2:23:06] have to answer for what we do wrong. Are
[2:23:09] you with me? Now, let's move to the next
[2:23:12] section of this study. I'll take a few
[2:23:14] more
[2:23:14] minutes. I want to call this section the
[2:23:17] subtle spell.
[2:23:20] Spell like a potion
[2:23:25] spell. I want to call it the subtle
[2:23:27] spell. How manipulation and control
[2:23:31] enter through offense.
[2:23:34] Manipulation is a key strategy of the
[2:23:37] enemy to bring division, control, and
[2:23:40] deception into the body of Christ. You
[2:23:41] better buckle your seat belt. It's often
[2:23:44] rooted in pride and offense. I think I I
[2:23:46] think you may have these notes. But it
[2:23:48] does not work
[2:23:49] alone. It partners with other spirits to
[2:23:52] form a stronghold that might that must
[2:23:55] be discerned, controlled, and
[2:23:57] broken. Manipulation. Someone say the
[2:24:00] word with me, would you? Manipulation.
[2:24:03] The subtle spell. There's a spell that
[2:24:05] sweeps through the body of Christ. One
[2:24:07] so subtle that it often goes undetected.
[2:24:10] It does not come with witches hats
[2:24:14] or pentagrams.
[2:24:16] It comes with wounded hearts, bruised
[2:24:19] egos cloaked in offense, manipulation,
[2:24:23] control. Galatians chapter 3 verse one.
[2:24:28] Let's look at it. Oh foolish
[2:24:31] Galatians, men and women, brothers and
[2:24:34] sisters of Galatia, who hath bewitched
[2:24:37] you, a
[2:24:39] spell. If we were to look at this, it
[2:24:42] means who has cast a spell over you that
[2:24:46] you should not obey the truth before
[2:24:49] whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
[2:24:52] evidently set forth,
[2:24:55] crucified among you. When we look at the
[2:24:58] root meaning of this verse of scripture,
[2:25:01] it talks
[2:25:02] about the the uh terrible tragedy of
[2:25:07] trying to continue something in the
[2:25:11] flesh that is
[2:25:14] birthed and has its origination in the
[2:25:17] spirit.
[2:25:20] I want to tell you the
[2:25:22] message of the hour, the revelation of
[2:25:25] Jesus Christ was birthed in the spirit.
[2:25:28] And those men and women who are
[2:25:30] dedicating their lives to try to keep it
[2:25:33] going in the flesh
[2:25:38] are missing the point.
[2:25:41] It's
[2:25:43] witchcraft. It's witchcraft to try to
[2:25:46] build in the flesh.
[2:25:48] what starts in the
[2:25:51] spirit. Everybody feeling like they've
[2:25:53] got to wear the cloud on their clothes
[2:25:55] or they've got to have the cloud
[2:25:57] everywhere or they've got to have a
[2:25:58] prophet's picture everywhere or they've
[2:26:00] got to do this and that or if anything
[2:26:02] negative is said uh that might bring any
[2:26:05] negative reflection. Uh we they've got
[2:26:08] there's a police out there that'll text
[2:26:10] you and call you and get a hold of you
[2:26:12] because they want to make sure that we
[2:26:14] don't do anything that would cause
[2:26:15] anybody to doubt. Let me tell you
[2:26:17] something. If I have to spend the rest
[2:26:19] of my life building in the flesh,
[2:26:23] what God started in the spirit,
[2:26:26] somebody's under a spell.
[2:26:30] That's right.
[2:26:32] Someone becomes a part of the problem
[2:26:35] instead of part of the solution. Yes,
[2:26:37] sir. Manipulation is a key strategy of
[2:26:40] the enemy to bring division, control,
[2:26:43] and deception into the body of Christ.
[2:26:46] That word bewitched in Greek is
[2:26:51] basino and it means to bring evil on
[2:26:56] one by feigning praise or an evil eye to
[2:27:01] charm to
[2:27:03] bewitch. There's more than one way to
[2:27:06] cast a
[2:27:07] spell. You can cast a spell through the
[2:27:10] powers of evil, through darkness,
[2:27:12] through
[2:27:13] demons. But there's another way to cast
[2:27:15] a spell. You can brag on somebody.
[2:27:28] You can brag on somebody until they
[2:27:31] become your your
[2:27:32] your
[2:27:35] pawn. It's the way the spirit of Jezebel
[2:27:38] worked. Yes.
[2:27:41] It's the way it works in churches. It's
[2:27:43] the way it works on jobs.
[2:27:47] When somebody's always telling you what
[2:27:49] a goat you are, don't believe them.
[2:27:52] They may not even understand what
[2:27:54] they're coming under, but there is a
[2:27:57] spirit that operates in the body of
[2:27:59] Christ that will not operate through
[2:28:02] demonic spells or curses, but it will
[2:28:05] seek to
[2:28:07] control by bragging, by becoming so
[2:28:11] friendly, by showing oneself
[2:28:14] supportive. Now, surely please don't
[2:28:17] misunderstand, we need a compliment
[2:28:19] every now and again.
[2:28:22] We certainly need support, but don't use
[2:28:25] these kinds of things to get on
[2:28:27] someone's good side. So then you can
[2:28:30] manipulate
[2:28:32] them. I don't know what I would do
[2:28:34] without a brother like you. I don't know
[2:28:36] what I would do without a son like you.
[2:28:38] I don't know what I would do without a
[2:28:40] daughter-in-law like you. I don't know
[2:28:42] what I would do. And and it becomes
[2:28:44] insincere.
[2:28:49] I don't know what I'd do without a
[2:28:50] brother-in-law like you. I don't know
[2:28:51] what I'd do without a sister-in-law on
[2:28:53] you, like you. It becomes insincere and
[2:28:55] it becomes a way to manipulate.
[2:29:01] It is so
[2:29:03] true and it's it's rooted in offense and
[2:29:07] pride. God help us.
[2:29:10] The word translated bewitched signifies
[2:29:14] affecting the eyes or spoiling the sight
[2:29:18] so as the men cannot discern an obvious
[2:29:22] object in a due
[2:29:25] position. The very word bewitched here
[2:29:29] translated is saying to affect the way
[2:29:33] someone
[2:29:34] sees so that they don't even know
[2:29:36] they're being controlled.
[2:29:39] Now, some of you are going to think
[2:29:41] about bad
[2:29:42] marriages because that's where it shows
[2:29:44] up a lot in bad marriages. It can show
[2:29:48] up on a job. It can it it shows up all
[2:29:51] the time in a
[2:29:53] family. You You want me to give you some
[2:29:55] help here? I guess our family is not as
[2:29:57] important as her
[2:30:01] family. I guess our family doesn't mean
[2:30:03] as much to you as as his family does.
[2:30:10] See, what they're doing is they're
[2:30:13] trying to affect the way you see the
[2:30:15] situation.
[2:30:17] And God says that's that's manipulation.
[2:30:19] It's control. And it's
[2:30:22] really to be judged the same way as
[2:30:25] someone casting an evil spell over
[2:30:27] someone. Did you know the judgment for
[2:30:29] witchcraft is going to be the same? Did
[2:30:31] you know the Bible is so much against
[2:30:33] the operation of witchcraft like that,
[2:30:36] controlling someone else by spell or by
[2:30:39] affecting the eyesight by the things
[2:30:41] that you say that the Bible said let
[2:30:44] every witch die.
[2:30:47] The Old Testament said burn her.
[2:30:51] Now that doesn't mean that's how we
[2:30:53] handle it in the New Testament. But if
[2:30:55] we should find out that we are operating
[2:30:57] in control and manipulation or if we
[2:31:00] find out that we are under the
[2:31:03] operation of control and manipulation,
[2:31:06] we need to repent and we need to say,
[2:31:08] I've got somebody with me who leads me.
[2:31:11] I don't have to be led by subtle
[2:31:17] twisting of words.
[2:31:19] Come on, sisters. We're talking to you,
[2:31:22] too.
[2:31:24] You know, it's like that old thing where
[2:31:26] they say, "Well, yeah, the husband is
[2:31:28] the head, the wife is the neck." I want
[2:31:30] you to know, in too many homes, that is
[2:31:33] the case. And remember, it's because
[2:31:36] they're living with such a stiffnecked
[2:31:38] man
[2:31:42] who has never loved his wife like Christ
[2:31:44] loved the church. And so, the only way
[2:31:47] to even bring him down to communication
[2:31:54] is to manipulate him a little
[2:31:58] bit. So then what are we going to call
[2:32:00] that? Christian
[2:32:05] witchcraft. It becomes a serious
[2:32:07] subject. It's probably too heavy for
[2:32:10] your mood this morning, but it's a
[2:32:12] serious subject. One that I'm examining
[2:32:14] in my own life as I go through this
[2:32:17] study. The meaning is, who hath seduced
[2:32:21] you? Who hath so corrupted your
[2:32:25] understanding that your actions are as
[2:32:29] unaccountable as the effects of
[2:32:34] witchcraft? You're no longer making
[2:32:36] decisions that are based on
[2:32:39] righteousness, the word of God, and the
[2:32:42] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[2:32:44] You're now making decisions for your
[2:32:47] life based on
[2:32:49] influence,
[2:32:51] manipulation, control, and fear. And God
[2:32:54] says, "I'm not going to lead my church
[2:32:56] that way. I'm not going to lead my
[2:32:58] church through manipulation, fear, etc.
[2:33:00] I'm not going to do that. I'm going to
[2:33:02] hit on all sides of this.
[2:33:05] I hope you all camping out in other
[2:33:07] places can hear what I'm saying in the
[2:33:10] building.
[2:33:14] The word rendered hath been evidently
[2:33:16] set
[2:33:18] forth because there it comes to the end.
[2:33:20] It says before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[2:33:22] hath been evidently set forth crucified
[2:33:25] among you. The word rendered there
[2:33:27] properly to write before and then to
[2:33:30] announce beforehand in writing or to
[2:33:33] announce by posting it up on a tablet.
[2:33:38] Paul did not say they were visited by
[2:33:43] witches. He said they were
[2:33:46] bewitched. Something spiritual had
[2:33:50] clouded something spiritual just not of
[2:33:53] the
[2:33:54] light of the darkness. Did you know it's
[2:33:57] possible to come under such a
[2:33:59] bewitchment that even when confronted
[2:34:02] with the
[2:34:07] truth, you can't see it.
[2:34:13] There are people who uh are so under
[2:34:16] that kind of an influence that they
[2:34:18] continue to pour every penny into a
[2:34:23] business that's already
[2:34:27] unfavored. God has already said you've
[2:34:29] lost your
[2:34:31] way. and they will continue to put
[2:34:34] everything they've got into propping
[2:34:36] something
[2:34:38] up that God said you weren't faithful to
[2:34:41] me in all of
[2:34:43] that. You want me to bless you and you
[2:34:46] haven't even paid your tithe
[2:34:49] or you want me to do all these things
[2:34:51] for you and you won't be faithful in
[2:34:53] other areas. And so I'm saying to you,
[2:34:56] uh, there's another
[2:34:57] way. Like, get a
[2:35:02] job. Brother Shelley, I thought you were
[2:35:04] for entrepreneurship. I am 100%. I
[2:35:08] believe that all God's men should come
[2:35:11] to a place of maturity. It'd be
[2:35:13] wonderful if they were all in a place of
[2:35:15] maturity that they could serve as
[2:35:17] entrepreneurs in the kingdom of God, uh,
[2:35:20] set their own hours and and make money.
[2:35:23] The reality is you can't start it in the
[2:35:26] flesh.
[2:35:29] Here's the opposite of what I said a
[2:35:30] moment ago because it's how we have to
[2:35:32] apply it. You can't start it in the
[2:35:35] flesh and expect it to be spiritual as
[2:35:37] it goes forward if it originates in the
[2:35:42] flesh. It's going to be a product of
[2:35:44] your loins. Yes, sir.
[2:35:47] Abraham had a good idea.
[2:35:50] He said, "I'll just take Hagar.
[2:35:54] I'll just lay with Hagar." Sarah, you
[2:35:57] know, suggested. But don't you think
[2:35:59] Abraham hadn't already thought of it?
[2:36:03] I'll just take Hagar. I'll I'll lay with
[2:36:05] her. She'll produce a baby. I'll go with
[2:36:07] that baby before God and ask God to
[2:36:09] bless it. God's already told you, I'm
[2:36:11] going to give you a son and I'm going to
[2:36:12] bless him and I'm going to give him to
[2:36:14] you through Sarai.
[2:36:17] That's right. So, you may have a good
[2:36:18] idea, Abraham. Sarah may have come up
[2:36:21] with a good idea, but it wasn't a God
[2:36:23] idea. It was a product of Sarah's mind
[2:36:29] and Abraham's loins.
[2:36:31] It produced a baby. His name was
[2:36:35] Ishmael. And God eventually said to
[2:36:38] Abraham, "He's never going to be
[2:36:39] anything to your family but trouble."
[2:36:42] So, take the take the the I started to
[2:36:45] say the hooker. take take the
[2:36:47] concubine take the concubine uh out and
[2:36:51] and her child and leave him there in the
[2:36:54] wilderness.
[2:36:56] Somebody said, "Where's the mercy?" God
[2:36:58] had mercy. He sent an angel down to give
[2:37:00] him water and food. God showed mercy
[2:37:03] because he knew that it wasn't wasn't uh
[2:37:06] Hagar's fault. He knew it wasn't
[2:37:08] Ishmael's fault particularly.
[2:37:10] They were sustained and now they have
[2:37:13] become what we know as the Arab and
[2:37:14] Muslim nations of the world.
[2:37:19] Sounded like a good idea to give Abraham
[2:37:21] a promised son. But God said through
[2:37:23] Sarah,
[2:37:25] what happens when you get an idea from a
[2:37:28] woman's head and a seed from a man's
[2:37:31] loins? Then you've got something
[2:37:34] originating in the flesh.
[2:37:37] And you can expect it to be
[2:37:39] anything but a problem in the
[2:37:43] flesh. If God says to you, "I'm going to
[2:37:46] lead you into a job. I'm going to lead
[2:37:47] you into a business. I'm going to show
[2:37:49] you the way, and you're not going to
[2:37:52] league yourself with darkness and
[2:37:53] sinners." Let me tell you something. We
[2:37:55] We misuse the scripture. I got to hush
[2:37:57] in a minute here, but I'm think I'm on
[2:37:59] something now, so I don't want to quit
[2:38:00] just yet. But you know that scripture
[2:38:02] that says, "Be you not unequally yolked
[2:38:04] together with unbelievers." That's not
[2:38:06] just marriage. That's business partners.
[2:38:10] That's making leagues and agreements and
[2:38:12] contracts with men and women who don't
[2:38:14] share the same the same scripture, the
[2:38:17] same revelation, the same truth as you
[2:38:19] do. You've got to be careful. Now, that
[2:38:21] doesn't mean that it will never be
[2:38:22] something that God does. But you've got
[2:38:24] to be very careful to know that it's the
[2:38:26] Lord. Because if that person behind the
[2:38:29] scene, unbeknownst to you, is cheating
[2:38:33] or lying or deceiving someone to build
[2:38:36] their part of the business, you think
[2:38:39] God's going to come down, draw the line,
[2:38:40] bless your part, not theirs,
[2:38:43] you're going to suffer like Achen
[2:38:45] suffered.
[2:38:47] If there's someone in the camp desiring
[2:38:49] the wedge of the Babylonians,
[2:38:52] hiding it, doing wrong, God's not going
[2:38:55] to bless even your part. Because you
[2:38:58] should have known better not to come
[2:38:59] into league in agreement with somebody
[2:39:00] who doesn't serve Christ.
[2:39:05] I need a nap.
[2:39:08] This word is life to me. It don't always
[2:39:11] feel lily.
[2:39:13] Sometimes it feels a little deathly.
[2:39:16] That's right. But there are things that
[2:39:17] have to die so that proper things can
[2:39:20] live. Paul didn't say we were visited by
[2:39:23] witches one Sunday. He said they were
[2:39:25] bewitched. Something spiritual had
[2:39:27] clouded their perception, disrupted
[2:39:30] their obedience, and obscured the cross
[2:39:33] from their vision.
[2:39:35] This is not fantasy. It's witchcraft
[2:39:37] through offense,
[2:39:41] pride, and sooulish
[2:39:43] manipulation. Soulish means mind, will,
[2:39:47] and
[2:39:49] emotions. I'm not against
[2:39:51] women. I have a reputation for being for
[2:39:55] women. And don't take that and make it
[2:39:56] something it's
[2:39:57] not. I believe that women have a proper
[2:40:01] place in the body of Christ and in the
[2:40:03] kingdom of the Lord. And I have
[2:40:05] confidence in women who pray because I
[2:40:07] know men are
[2:40:08] slack by
[2:40:10] nature. They pray less by nature. They
[2:40:14] see their need less by
[2:40:17] nature. They have to break through their
[2:40:19] own
[2:40:20] nature to be anything more than
[2:40:25] that. We do it. Some do it. But some
[2:40:29] never do it. Some stay in the vicious
[2:40:33] cycle of their
[2:40:35] manhood. Ain't nobody going to tell me.
[2:40:38] Ain't nobody going to teach me. Ain't
[2:40:39] nobody going to instruct me. I know I'm
[2:40:42] a man. I got a wife. I got children. I
[2:40:45] know how to do it. Ain't nobody going to
[2:40:46] tell me how to do it.
[2:40:52] So, let me get another credit
[2:40:55] card. Solve everything. Let me tell you
[2:40:58] something. Credit doesn't solve all the
[2:41:00] problem. Yes sir. No sir. He doesn't. So
[2:41:04] a man has to fight through a lot of his
[2:41:06] own nature to come to where he's yielded
[2:41:09] and obedient to Christ. So does a woman.
[2:41:12] So I'm not against women at all. Not at
[2:41:14] all. I believe women have a a a
[2:41:17] beautiful place in the kingdom of God. I
[2:41:19] embrace what the New Testament said. In
[2:41:21] the kingdom there's neither male nor
[2:41:22] female. There are offices that are
[2:41:24] better suited and called for men. There
[2:41:26] are better places in the kingdom for
[2:41:27] women to serve. That is the truth. There
[2:41:30] are better places for women to serve in
[2:41:32] public, better places for men to serve
[2:41:34] in public. Climbing a telephone pole is
[2:41:37] not the best place for a woman to serve
[2:41:39] the
[2:41:42] public. Is that chauvinist? If it is,
[2:41:45] I'm sorry. I'm
[2:41:47] sorry. Unless she's wearing britches
[2:41:50] under her clothes like women do
[2:41:53] today, she don't need to be up on that.
[2:41:55] Does Does that mean Are you taking that
[2:41:57] to mean she can't? Oh, no. She
[2:42:01] can't. I'm one of those people who
[2:42:03] believes she has the brightness, the
[2:42:06] intelligence, by nature, by design to do
[2:42:09] most anything mentally that a man can
[2:42:12] do, including serving as president of
[2:42:15] the United States of America. I don't
[2:42:17] know why she would want to is my
[2:42:19] question. But it's never been about
[2:42:21] whether she had the ability to do it. I
[2:42:23] know there are women who are far
[2:42:25] superior in making things happen in
[2:42:29] business than many men. But the question
[2:42:32] is, do they need to be there? Is that
[2:42:34] where God wants them? Are they serving
[2:42:36] at their highest level when they serve
[2:42:38] there? But what I'm trying to say is
[2:42:41] this spirit of manipulation is present
[2:42:43] in so many
[2:42:44] marriages. It's present in so many
[2:42:47] homes. And don't think that men cannot
[2:42:49] manipulate. They do and they will. And
[2:42:51] they do that by reminding you who makes
[2:42:54] the money
[2:42:58] and how dependent you are on their
[2:43:02] paycheck. But most often a woman uses
[2:43:05] manipulation in the home. And she does
[2:43:07] it in in a in a bragging way at times.
[2:43:11] She does it in a controlling way,
[2:43:14] reminding us that she's the
[2:43:16] neck when indeed she really is the neck
[2:43:20] that turns the head because she's had to
[2:43:22] learn the grind. And she wouldn't have
[2:43:25] had to learn the grind. Let's balance it
[2:43:27] out one more time. She wouldn't have had
[2:43:28] to learn how to dodge and walk on the
[2:43:31] eggshells if we would have loved her
[2:43:34] like God told us to love her. She
[2:43:37] wouldn't have had to do it. But that
[2:43:39] does not excuse her
[2:43:42] from casting a
[2:43:47] spell and usurping her place, taking the
[2:43:51] man's place in the
[2:43:53] home. I don't think that a man has to
[2:43:56] remind a woman. I don't think that a
[2:43:58] godly man conducting a godly family has
[2:44:02] to remind a woman that she's a woman.
[2:44:06] If you keep finding your need to tell
[2:44:08] her she's a woman some things a little
[2:44:10] bit out of order. You're the woman. I'm
[2:44:13] the one that makes the decision. I'm the
[2:44:15] one that cost the shots around here. I'm
[2:44:17] the one that I don't think we ought to
[2:44:18] have to remind them of that over and
[2:44:19] over and over again.
[2:44:22] In fact, I don't think that the average
[2:44:24] woman has a problem finding and
[2:44:26] fulfilling her role in a home when she
[2:44:30] feels safe,
[2:44:32] when she feels loved,
[2:44:34] when she feels cherished. Come on, I'm
[2:44:37] getting some amens now. There is a
[2:44:39] balance. But don't ever think, my
[2:44:42] brother, that manipulation is a way to
[2:44:44] get your wife to do what you want her to
[2:44:46] do. And dear sister, don't ever think
[2:44:48] that we get by God if we try to use
[2:44:50] these subtle forms of manipulation and
[2:44:52] witchcraft to get our husband to do what
[2:44:55] we want them to do. And here's the
[2:44:57] problem, and this is why Paul had to
[2:44:59] address it. They were making it
[2:45:04] spiritual. They were making it
[2:45:08] spiritual. And there are natural roles
[2:45:11] in a family. There are also spiritual
[2:45:13] roles in a family. And sometimes women
[2:45:16] will justify taking the spiritual
[2:45:19] leadership of the home by reminding us
[2:45:22] that their husbands are not doing their
[2:45:26] responsibility. But that does not give a
[2:45:29] sister the the grace to step out of her
[2:45:33] place
[2:45:35] either. You see, we have to be careful
[2:45:37] with our excuses because thanks be to
[2:45:40] God, we have a Bible way.
[2:45:44] We have a scriptural example in the New
[2:45:47] Testament.
[2:45:48] We just go right back to the word. So
[2:45:52] now notice Paul did not say they were
[2:45:54] visited by witches. He said they were
[2:45:57] bewitched. Something spiritual had
[2:45:59] clouded their perception, disrupted
[2:46:01] their obedience, and obscured the cross.
[2:46:04] This is not fantasy. He said it is
[2:46:06] witchcraft through offense, pride, and
[2:46:08] soulish manipulation.
[2:46:11] Every time we refuse to
[2:46:13] forgive, you know, forgiveness is the
[2:46:15] answer for offense.
[2:46:17] You can nip all this in the bud by just
[2:46:19] learning and to choose to forgive.
[2:46:23] If you're waiting on the apology, you're
[2:46:25] not choosing to forgive.
[2:46:27] You're forgiving with stipulation.
[2:46:30] That's not how Christ forgave me. He
[2:46:33] didn't hold my sin over my head.
[2:46:35] Hallelujah. He cast it as far as the
[2:46:38] east is from the west to never remember
[2:46:41] it against me anymore. Can you say amen?
[2:46:44] Amen. Every time we cling to our right
[2:46:46] to be right. Every time we weaponize
[2:46:49] emotion and here's here's where that
[2:46:51] sister thing comes
[2:46:53] in to weaponize emotions to control
[2:46:57] someone else. There are people in this
[2:46:59] world who think they can change the tone
[2:47:01] of their
[2:47:03] voice and win the
[2:47:06] moment by putting a little
[2:47:11] trimmer in their voice like they're
[2:47:13] sorry. They're not
[2:47:16] sorry. They're just using
[2:47:18] emotion, theirs and yours to try to
[2:47:22] manipulate the
[2:47:23] situation. That's not real forgiveness.
[2:47:26] That's not real repentance. Come on,
[2:47:28] brother, sister. That's not dealing with
[2:47:30] things the Bible way. Every time we take
[2:47:33] emotions and weaponize them to control
[2:47:36] someone else, we open the door to the
[2:47:39] subtle spell where manipulation replaces
[2:47:42] love and control
[2:47:47] replaces. There could be no overemphasis
[2:47:50] of needing the baptism of the Holy
[2:47:52] Ghost. We need him to serve the Lord
[2:47:53] properly in this hour. We need him to
[2:47:56] serve one another properly.
[2:47:58] Is that right? 1st Samuel 15:23 as we
[2:48:02] come to a close for
[2:48:05] rebellion. This is a huge story. I have
[2:48:09] I know I have 15 pages for several weeks
[2:48:12] that I've wanted that I've wanted to use
[2:48:14] on the story of of Samuel and
[2:48:18] Saul. This this is an incredible
[2:48:22] story. For rebellion is as the sin of
[2:48:25] witchcraft, and
[2:48:26] stubbornness, let's just stop a moment.
[2:48:28] For rebellion is as the sin of
[2:48:31] witchcraft. Here we are again looking at
[2:48:34] manipulation and control, comparing it
[2:48:37] to witchcraft, New Testament, Galatians.
[2:48:41] Now we're looking at Old Testament, and
[2:48:43] we're comparing rebellion to the same
[2:48:46] kind of of of manipulation of through
[2:48:49] witchcraft. Stubbornness is as iniquity
[2:48:52] and
[2:48:54] idolatry. Stubbornness, not
[2:48:58] steadfastness. Stubbornness is the same
[2:49:01] as worshiping a false
[2:49:03] god. Idolatry. Uh-oh, it got quiet. Did
[2:49:07] I just say something out of the word?
[2:49:10] I'm just reading. Stubbornness is as
[2:49:11] iniquity, which is generational sin, and
[2:49:15] idolatry, which is worshiping another
[2:49:16] god. What is it that we're making
[2:49:20] another god when we become stubborn? Our
[2:49:24] will. We're worshiping our will. We're
[2:49:28] exalting our will above God's will. So
[2:49:32] therefore, we're making an idol out of
[2:49:34] our will and we're being stubborn about
[2:49:37] it. You're not going to move me. I can
[2:49:39] hear God. I can hear God for myself.
[2:49:41] You're not going to change my mind.
[2:49:42] You're not going to help me. Come on.
[2:49:45] And there we get the scripture. For
[2:49:46] rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft.
[2:49:48] Stubbornness is as iniquity and
[2:49:50] idolatry. It's like worshiping a false
[2:49:52] god. Because thou hast
[2:49:55] rejected Saul, Samuel to Saul, thou hast
[2:50:00] rejected the word of the Lord. He hath
[2:50:03] also rejected thee from being king. I
[2:50:05] want you to listen to me as we close.
[2:50:07] Really, this is the close. I want you to
[2:50:10] answer a few questions for me. Was it
[2:50:12] God's perfect
[2:50:14] will? Did it become God's perfect will
[2:50:17] for Saul to be king over
[2:50:20] Israel? It
[2:50:23] did. God was the rejected king. Did it
[2:50:27] hurt him? It did. Is it how he wanted
[2:50:30] things to originally be? No. Did it
[2:50:32] catch him by surprise? No.
[2:50:36] He knew that Israel was not going to
[2:50:38] remain a theocracy because in the end
[2:50:42] time there wouldn't be any theocracies
[2:50:45] except in the kingdom. Israel is not a
[2:50:48] theocracy. There's no theocracy on the
[2:50:51] planet except the kingdom of God. And
[2:50:53] it's quickly perverted into
[2:50:55] man's creation. Too often we create what
[2:50:59] we're looking for. Amen.
[2:51:02] And so it it was it was certainly God's
[2:51:05] desire to always be king of Israel, but
[2:51:09] he allowed and
[2:51:13] chose he chose his own successor.
[2:51:21] It was the word of the Lord that came to
[2:51:25] Samuel that Saul was to be anointed the
[2:51:28] king of Israel. And even though the
[2:51:30] brokenness of God in the message the
[2:51:33] rejected king gets a hold of our heart
[2:51:35] and the and don't you listen now.
[2:51:39] And and and the sorrow that God
[2:51:42] experienced knowing that they'd rather
[2:51:43] have a man than him. It it hurt him. I
[2:51:47] know it did. And yet it was his plan. It
[2:51:50] was his will. It was his plan that Saul
[2:51:56] be king of Israel.
[2:51:58] The same God who called Saul to be the
[2:52:00] king of Israel. It was God's will. Let
[2:52:02] Let me make sure you understand because
[2:52:04] I'm going to say something just now in a
[2:52:05] moment. Was it God's will? Did God send
[2:52:08] Samuel to anoint Saul to call Saul to
[2:52:11] be? Did Did that happen? Am I right?
[2:52:14] That happened. Did you know the same God
[2:52:16] who said he's the one?
[2:52:22] The same God that said he's the one said
[2:52:26] he's no longer the one.
[2:52:30] Make sure you hear that. The same God
[2:52:33] that said I've chosen Saul now says I've
[2:52:36] rejected Saul.
[2:52:38] Does that mean God was wrong in the
[2:52:40] beginning? Never. It means that Saul's
[2:52:43] heart changed. That's right. And when
[2:52:46] Saul's heart changed, God sent Samuel to
[2:52:49] him and said to him, "Remember what was
[2:52:51] the rebellion? Remember what the sin
[2:52:53] was?" God said, "Kill them all.
[2:52:57] You take all the Amalachites out. Every
[2:52:59] one of them, including King Aag, go get
[2:53:01] them all. Get them all and get their
[2:53:03] cattle, too. Make sure there's nothing
[2:53:05] left of that evil, rebellious uh uh
[2:53:08] kingdom." I mean, that's just Bible
[2:53:11] history, right? The word of the Lord
[2:53:13] begins to stir on Samuel. He comes up
[2:53:15] the road. He hears the bleeding of the
[2:53:17] sheep. He said, "Hey, what's going on?"
[2:53:19] He finds out. He meets Saul on the way.
[2:53:22] Saul is so religious. What a hypocrite
[2:53:24] at this point in his life. The chosen of
[2:53:26] the Lord. The chosen of the Lord. He's
[2:53:30] become such a hypocrite at this point
[2:53:32] that he grabs him, you know, his coat
[2:53:35] and he says, "Oh, praise the Lord. Bless
[2:53:37] the Lord, brother Samuel. Prophet
[2:53:39] Samuel, it's so good to see you. I have
[2:53:41] just come from the slaughter of the
[2:53:43] kings, obeying every word that has come
[2:53:45] out of the mouth of the Lord by the
[2:53:47] great esteemed prophet
[2:53:50] Samuel. And Samuel says, "Then what
[2:53:52] meanth the crying of the sheep?" Oh, oh,
[2:53:54] oh. That why he said we decided that we
[2:53:59] would keep the
[2:54:03] best and offer it unto the
[2:54:06] Lord. In fact, we will keep the king.
[2:54:08] the king who was rooted in in
[2:54:12] heathen pagan ritual and witchcraft. And
[2:54:16] remember what it cost Israel to keep him
[2:54:18] alive. There would have never been a
[2:54:20] Hmon.
[2:54:23] If A hadn't lived, there would have
[2:54:26] never been a Hmon. There would have
[2:54:28] never been a porum.
[2:54:32] There wouldn't be a gossa conflict.
[2:54:37] So what Samuel, what Saul did, he had no
[2:54:39] right to do. And yet he blessed himself.
[2:54:42] Oh, I've obeyed the word of the Lord.
[2:54:43] Oh, you've rightfully said you've obeyed
[2:54:45] the word of the Lord. But I'm here to
[2:54:46] tell you, the same way that God chose
[2:54:48] you, he has now rejected you as king.
[2:54:53] And look what God did. There's a lot of
[2:54:56] controversy right now because of a of a
[2:54:59] television series about the house of
[2:55:01] David. And there's a lot of conflict
[2:55:03] about it. And I find I find the conflict
[2:55:07] very
[2:55:07] interesting because it's actually
[2:55:10] bringing out something in in scripture
[2:55:12] that we might not have fully looked at
[2:55:14] in the beginning, but it appears that
[2:55:17] God reached way below the
[2:55:20] bottom when he picked
[2:55:24] David. We can talk about that another
[2:55:26] time, but he chose David. He reject He
[2:55:30] chose Saul.
[2:55:32] Now, I know people like to say the
[2:55:33] people chose Saul, but understand if God
[2:55:36] hadn't allowed it, it would have never
[2:55:39] been and it was God who sent the prophet
[2:55:42] down to anoint him.
[2:55:44] Remember, Samuel was a big bigwig
[2:55:46] prophet. Everything, every word that
[2:55:48] came out of his mouth came to pass. Not
[2:55:50] one word fell on the ground. He was
[2:55:52] totally submitted and committed to the
[2:55:54] call. Amen. And so here we rebellion is
[2:55:58] a flash it one more time. Rebellion is
[2:56:00] as a sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness
[2:56:01] as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou
[2:56:03] hast rejected the word of the Lord, he
[2:56:05] hath also rejected thee from being king.
[2:56:08] So God can choose
[2:56:11] and he can reject.
[2:56:14] And God was right both times. He's the
[2:56:17] man. He's not the man.
[2:56:21] He's the one. He's not the one. Was God
[2:56:24] ever wrong? Not any of that time.
[2:56:28] Not any of that time was he wrong. And
[2:56:30] in in the final uh close here, the last
[2:56:33] one, musicians
[2:56:35] come. I want to show you three
[2:56:38] things. Offended
[2:56:40] hearts are fertile
[2:56:43] ground for for this kind of witchcraft.
[2:56:46] We're talking about manipulation and
[2:56:49] control because offense breeds it
[2:56:54] breeds the dis the demonstration the
[2:56:58] display of three things.
[2:57:00] Manipulation, domination,
[2:57:04] intimidation. Manipulation is emotional
[2:57:06] control. making you think that you're
[2:57:09] making a decision on your own when you
[2:57:11] are really following
[2:57:14] subtle
[2:57:16] control that the Bible says is just like
[2:57:19] casting spells, just like witchcraft.
[2:57:22] The same thing as what the witch is
[2:57:23] doing down the road. When we try to
[2:57:26] manipulate one another by using emotion,
[2:57:29] when a woman uses an
[2:57:30] emotion to try to get her way in the
[2:57:33] home, that's wrong. When a man uses
[2:57:36] emotion to try to control his
[2:57:41] wife, that's
[2:57:43] wrong. Emotion should not be weaponized
[2:57:46] to control
[2:57:48] anyone. Particularly, it should never
[2:57:50] happen in the body of Christ. Preachers
[2:57:52] shouldn't do it. Peucidtors shouldn't do
[2:57:55] it.
[2:57:58] we're going to withhold our amen or
[2:57:59] we're going to withhold our tithe or
[2:58:00] we're going to withhold something to try
[2:58:02] to get the preacher off the subject that
[2:58:04] we that we're uncomfortable with. That's
[2:58:06] wrong for a preacher to use the same
[2:58:09] kind of thing. And have we have have
[2:58:10] most all of us preachers been guilty?
[2:58:13] Yes. Have I ever been guilty? Probably
[2:58:15] so. As I begin to look at the
[2:58:17] seriousness of it, I see myself in many
[2:58:20] of these things. I'm thankful that God
[2:58:23] gives us the opportunity to make them
[2:58:25] right.
[2:58:27] When we are carrying offense, it becomes
[2:58:30] fertile ground for witchcraft because
[2:58:32] offense breeds manipulation, which is
[2:58:34] emotional control, domination, which is
[2:58:36] relational control, and
[2:58:40] intimidation, which is spiritual
[2:58:42] control. These are the three pillars of
[2:58:45] how witchcraft operates in the church
[2:58:47] today. We got a long way to get through
[2:58:49] this, but this is our introduction to it
[2:58:52] this morning. Let's stand.
[2:58:54] We want to be
[2:58:56] free from all hurt, wounds,
[2:59:02] offense, jealousies,
[2:59:05] resentments. We want to shut the door
[2:59:08] down in our life to any form of
[2:59:14] manipulation and control in the home, in
[2:59:17] the family, in the church, on our jobs.
[2:59:22] We want to just do it like the scripture
[2:59:24] tells us to do it. We want to do it like
[2:59:26] brother Brandham said there when he
[2:59:28] tells us, "Okay, they've wronged you and
[2:59:31] you may have every right to retaliate.
[2:59:33] Just let it
[2:59:35] go." God is a just
[2:59:39] God. He's a just God and he knows how to
[2:59:45] write what is wrong. He knows how to set
[2:59:48] things back in order if we get out of
[2:59:50] the way and let him. It's a possibility
[2:59:54] that we are at one moment the chosen of
[2:59:57] the Lord to do a job and in another
[2:59:59] moment rejected to do the same job. What
[3:00:02] happens in that situation? God will
[3:00:04] raise somebody else up. Do you think the
[3:00:06] kingdom of God's going to suffer because
[3:00:08] somebody gets out of line and refuses to
[3:00:10] hear the word of the Lord? I don't I
[3:00:13] don't think it suffered. I think Israel
[3:00:14] got a better king.
[3:00:17] I think for many years David served the
[3:00:19] people of God in a greater measure. But
[3:00:22] didn't he have to pay a price for it?
[3:00:25] Was he a perfect leader?
[3:00:30] Did he end up committing adultery and
[3:00:32] then murder to cover his sin?
[3:00:35] Did he pay a price? Lost his son. Did he
[3:00:39] pay a price? Many. One of the prices
[3:00:42] that he paid is he wasn't even allowed
[3:00:44] to build the temple of the Lord.
[3:00:46] But God has an order.
[3:00:49] We want to find that order and stay in
[3:00:51] it, don't we? Let's just pray a minute
[3:00:53] or two here. Just play something softly.
[3:00:55] Father, we are moving forward in our
[3:01:00] journey and our quest to rid our
[3:01:04] lives of
[3:01:06] offense. We read in your word, great
[3:01:09] peace have they which love the law of
[3:01:11] God, and nothing shall by any means
[3:01:14] offend them. And yet we find ourselves
[3:01:16] so easily becoming
[3:01:20] offended with one
[3:01:23] another. It would be a daily basis if we
[3:01:27] were together every
[3:01:29] day. But we know there's victory for us.
[3:01:33] We know your word is outlining a plan
[3:01:36] for us to get above that stuff.
[3:01:41] We don't want unforgiveness to become a
[3:01:43] stronghold in our life. We want to
[3:01:46] forgive even as you forgave. Lord
[3:01:51] Jesus, what an example Joseph
[3:01:55] was. What a higher example you were when
[3:01:58] you prayed at the cross. Father, forgive
[3:02:00] them for they know not what they do.
[3:02:04] If only we
[3:02:06] could be that easy and quick to forgive.
[3:02:10] Search
[3:02:11] us. Search us
[3:02:13] today. Search our hearts
[3:02:16] today. If we recognize this morning that
[3:02:20] we with subtle ways have tried to
[3:02:22] control our marriage, our family, our
[3:02:25] children, our companion. Lord, help
[3:02:28] us. Forgive us. But not only forgive us,
[3:02:31] teach us how to do it
[3:02:36] right. May we never have to bash or
[3:02:40] break with words to
[3:02:43] lead. May we lead with
[3:02:46] love. May we lead our homes with love.
[3:02:49] May we lead the body of Christ with
[3:02:50] love. May we even lead on our jobs with
[3:02:53] love.
[3:02:57] We thank you that it's not too late for
[3:03:00] us to be more like
[3:03:02] you. We reach out, Lord, for more of you
[3:03:05] in our
[3:03:07] lives. We love you supremely above all
[3:03:11] things. Help us as we gather to worship
[3:03:14] you
[3:03:15] now in the name of Jesus.
[3:03:19] [Music]
[3:03:23] I love you, Lord.
[3:03:25] [Music]
[3:03:27] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[3:03:32] And all my days, can you say that? I've
[3:03:36] been held in your hands. from start to
[3:03:39] finish. From the moment that I wake up
[3:03:44] until I lay my head.
[3:03:48] Oh, I will
[3:03:50] sing of the goodness. Come on, let's
[3:03:52] worship him of God. Yes.
[3:03:58] And all my life you have been faithful.
[3:04:03] [Music]
[3:04:06] And all my life you have been so so
[3:04:12] good. With every breath that I am
[3:04:18] able, I will
[3:04:20] sing of the
[3:04:23] goodness of God.
[3:04:26] I love you, Lord. Yes. Oh, your mercy
[3:04:33] never fails
[3:04:35] me. And all my
[3:04:38] days I've been held in your
[3:04:42] hands. From the moment that I wake
[3:04:46] up until I lay my
[3:04:50] head. Oh, I will sing of the
[3:04:55] goodness of God.
[3:04:57] [Music]
[3:04:59] Oh, cuz all my life you have been
[3:05:05] faithful.
[3:05:07] Oh, and all my life you have been so.
[3:05:12] You've been so good.
[3:05:15] Lord, with every breath that I am
[3:05:20] able, I will sing of the
[3:05:25] goodness of God.
[3:05:28] I love your
[3:05:30] voice. Lord, you have led me through the
[3:05:36] [Music]
[3:05:37] fire in the darkest
[3:05:40] night. You are close like no other.
[3:05:45] cuz I've known you as a
[3:05:48] father and I've known you as my
[3:05:52] friend and I have lived in the
[3:05:56] goodness of
[3:05:59] God.
[3:06:01] Oh, cuz all my life you have been
[3:06:06] faithful. You've been so faithful, Lord.
[3:06:09] And all my life, you have been so.
[3:06:13] You've been so
[3:06:15] good, Lord. With every breath that I am
[3:06:21] able, oh, I will
[3:06:24] sing of the goodness of
[3:06:28] God.
[3:06:30] Oh, cuz all my life you have been
[3:06:34] faithful.
[3:06:37] [Music]
[3:06:38] Oh, and all my life you have been so.
[3:06:43] Lord, you've been so
[3:06:45] good. So with every breath that I am

[3:14:45] And when the battle's over, we shall
[3:14:48] wear a crown. We shall wear a crown. We
[3:14:53] shall wear a crown and win the battle.
[3:14:57] The New Testament said he would give a
[3:15:00] crown to the
[3:15:02] overcomer. We'll wear a
[3:15:05] crown. Wear a
[3:15:07] crown. Wear a bright and shining crown.
[3:15:13] And when the battle's over, we shall
[3:15:16] wear a crown in the new
[3:15:21] Jerusalem. Well, when the battle's
[3:15:24] [Music]
[3:15:26] over. Oh, we shall wear a crown. The
[3:15:30] bride shall wear a crown. When the
[3:15:32] battle's over, we shall wear a crown in
[3:15:36] the new
[3:15:38] Jerusalem. Wear a crown. Wear a crown.
[3:15:42] Wear a
[3:15:44] crown, wear a bright and shining
[3:15:49] crown. And when the battle's over, we
[3:15:53] shall wear a crown in the new.
[3:15:58] [Music]
[3:16:01] And
[3:16:02] so you may cast yours at the feet of the
[3:16:06] master, but the the truth
[3:16:09] is those who
[3:16:11] overcome are given the crown of life.
[3:16:15] The fadeth not away. Aren't you
[3:16:17] thankful? There are treasures that are
[3:16:19] incorruptible. Amen. I want us to close
[3:16:22] the service today and I would like to
[3:16:24] ask you to remember a family of
[3:16:27] believers in uh Hickory, North Carolina
[3:16:30] today who are grieving the loss of a
[3:16:34] 20year-old son taken tragically in a
[3:16:39] accident a couple of three nights ago.
[3:16:43] He had just spoken with his pastor the
[3:16:47] Sunday before his death about his
[3:16:50] struggle to get back to God and to get
[3:16:54] help from an addiction that had taken
[3:16:57] control of his life. 20 years old,
[3:17:00] handsome, the last name of the family is
[3:17:02] Britain, originally from the north but
[3:17:06] had settled in that area. I think they
[3:17:09] were brother Adam Knights at one time,
[3:17:10] but uh at the time of of what what was
[3:17:13] his first name, honey?
[3:17:15] Eli at the time of Eli's death, I think
[3:17:18] they were going to brother Barry
[3:17:20] Coffey's church in Hickory. But the
[3:17:22] family needs to be remembered to the
[3:17:23] Lord. 20 years old. My wife and I, we
[3:17:26] take these things pretty hard when we
[3:17:28] hear them because we're parents. That's
[3:17:31] just it. her parents and we realize how
[3:17:34] how fleeting, how how
[3:17:37] how
[3:17:39] undetermined life is and it makes you
[3:17:42] want to hug everybody tighter and make
[3:17:45] sure you say I love you when they leave.
[3:17:48] Pray for this family today that God will
[3:17:50] strengthen them. The service will be
[3:17:52] this week and they're going to need the
[3:17:54] help of the Lord. The only hope and
[3:17:56] peace that they have now is the fact
[3:17:58] that the young man spoke to his pastor
[3:18:00] on Sunday and said, "I need prayer. I
[3:18:03] need prayer. I I want to get my life
[3:18:05] back in order." May God have heard his
[3:18:08] prayer, his cry, his heart, and uh we
[3:18:12] just hope and pray that we that that
[3:18:15] family is reunited with him just over
[3:18:17] the over the horizon. Amen. Amen.
[3:18:21] Tuesday night at 7:00, uh, every family
[3:18:24] and parent that has someone going to
[3:18:27] youth camp in Louisiana, I'd like to
[3:18:29] speak to you just a few minutes after
[3:18:31] the service on Tuesday night. So, I
[3:18:33] realize and recognize that some of you
[3:18:35] have young people going to the camp in
[3:18:38] Louisiana over the weekend of of what
[3:18:41] the world calls Easter. And uh I want to
[3:18:44] speak to you all, not necessarily the
[3:18:46] your youth. We can do that another time,
[3:18:48] but to parents and um chaperones and
[3:18:52] whoever else is involved in that, I'd
[3:18:54] like to speak to you just a few minute,
[3:18:56] 10 minutes, uh 15 max after the service
[3:19:00] on Tuesday night. Uh Saturday night, six
[3:19:03] o'clock. We will have our fellowship uh
[3:19:06] weekend. Brother Dwayne Jackson will be
[3:19:08] preaching Saturday night. the Lord
[3:19:10] willing, I'll minister on Sunday morning
[3:19:12] because he will be going to minister for
[3:19:15] brother David Templeton on on Sunday
[3:19:17] morning. Uh we're not sure about
[3:19:19] fellowship on Saturday because we know
[3:19:21] some of the folks have obligations
[3:19:23] during the day on Saturday. So, we're
[3:19:25] not sure that there'll be anything. If
[3:19:27] something comes up, we we don't really
[3:19:29] know yet who all will be here. something
[3:19:31] comes up, we'll let you know by way of
[3:19:33] the app. But there will be a meal after
[3:19:36] the service on Saturday night. And there
[3:19:38] will be extra visitors here. So, let's
[3:19:40] make sure that their needs are taken
[3:19:42] care of. And then there'll be a potluck
[3:19:44] picnic type thing on Sunday afterwards
[3:19:47] so that we can have lots of fellowship
[3:19:48] with the visitors. We have so much to
[3:19:50] celebrate. We do. We have so much to
[3:19:53] celebrate. Let's just pray together as
[3:19:55] we get ready to go. Father, your grace
[3:19:57] is sufficient for every trial, for every
[3:20:01] loss, for every heartbreak. We lift up
[3:20:04] the Britain family before you today,
[3:20:07] Lord, and a mom and a dad and sisters,
[3:20:10] maybe even a a a younger brother. I
[3:20:13] don't recall exactly the dynamic of the
[3:20:15] family, but they're hurting. Their
[3:20:18] hearts are broken. You are our comfort
[3:20:22] in times like this.
[3:20:24] We lift them up to you, Lord, and we
[3:20:26] pray that your presence will surround
[3:20:28] them in significant and profound ways
[3:20:31] during this time of of real pain, real
[3:20:34] heartache. Lord, as a body, we thank you
[3:20:37] for instructing us from your word today,
[3:20:40] giving us the strength, the grace, the
[3:20:42] desire, the wannabe to be here. We ask
[3:20:45] that you go with us and let perfect
[3:20:47] healing take place in our bodies and
[3:20:49] that you would continue to uh break down
[3:20:52] the word that we have heard. And may we
[3:20:55] become very very aware of uh every trick
[3:20:59] and scheme of the enemy and may we
[3:21:01] exercise the authority that you have
[3:21:04] given us, the overcoming power. Lord,
[3:21:07] what a blessing to be a believer, to
[3:21:10] know that we can overcome because you
[3:21:14] have overcome it all. We just ask that
[3:21:17] you would bless today our uh leaving and
[3:21:20] our time short time of fellowship after.
[3:21:24] We just give all things into your great
[3:21:26] big capable hands. In the name of the
