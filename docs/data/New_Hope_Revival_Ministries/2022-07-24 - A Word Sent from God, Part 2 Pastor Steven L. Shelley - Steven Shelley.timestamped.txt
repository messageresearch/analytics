[37:12] that have come in i've been getting
[37:15] uh
[37:15] what you might say
[37:18] really bombarded inundated with so many
[37:22] asking for deliverance which is a
[37:24] wonderful thing
[37:26] to want to be free yes but only the lord
[37:28] can give that deliverance so we are

[37:37] down in the night and he has uh the
[37:39] results of his mri

[37:49] be with him
[37:50] and to touch him and give him strength
[37:52] he will meet with a specialist to find
[37:55] out what the what the course of action
[37:57] is normally a pretty serious
[37:59] surgery but i don't know what they will
[38:01] tell him but we know that god is with
[38:03] him sister anita needs our prayers we
[38:06] need to hold her up to the lord she
[38:07] needs strength and help and leadership

[38:14] at least two medical decisions that i
[38:17] need to make
[38:18] perhaps even this week and i've been
[38:21] putting it off and hoping for a miracle
[38:24] i know god is a miracle-working god but
[38:27] i won't be able to continue to go much
[38:29] longer with these two things i need
[38:31] god's help with if if he lifts my faith
[38:34] today i'm willing to hold out
[38:36] longer
[38:37] i believe it i know he's more than able
[38:40] and i need his leadership all right amen
[38:43] and like you've already requested prayer
[38:45] for those traveling some are not here

[38:50] have been exposed or might have been
[38:51] exposed some are not here because they

[50:42] musicians for stepping in today
[50:45] and helping us
[50:47] to press into the presence of the lord
[50:50] and i thank you as well for coming with
[50:53] a mind made up to press into the
[50:56] presence of the lord to create
[50:58] atmosphere
[51:00] if you will allow me just a couple of
[51:02] minutes i would like to tell you a
[51:04] couple of things that are going on
[51:07] i would like to
[51:09] thank luke and nathan for helping us to
[51:11] get that sidewalk
[51:13] jacked up we had somebody to fall last
[51:15] week and
[51:17] i leaned pretty heavy on luke because he
[51:20] is more up to date with some of the
[51:22] building techniques and
[51:24] so we were able to get that jacked up
[51:26] rather than paying 2 500 for
[51:28] professionals to do it we did it
[51:31] and so it is level now it is safe once
[51:34] again and so i'm thankful to the lord
[51:36] for that
[51:37] we want to thank brother david mann
[51:40] though he is not here this air
[51:42] conditioner got put in place i know
[51:44] nathan was helping him i'm not sure who
[51:46] else brother robert these brothers got
[51:49] this air conditioner in place yesterday
[51:51] and hooked up so it is cooling this
[51:54] morning and we're thankful for that and
[51:56] we want to honor
[51:58] to pay
[51:59] go ahead it's paid for we're so grateful
[52:02] to the lord for that
[52:04] [Applause]
[52:10] i would like to announce to you
[52:13] that the prayer chapels are now ready
[52:16] for use
[52:18] [Applause]
[52:20] [Music]
[52:21] [Applause]
[52:25] i would like to in a couple of weeks to
[52:27] rededicate them
[52:32] we put as little money in them as we
[52:34] possibly could we started out with a new
[52:36] roof april of 2020
[52:39] they are climate controlled and as long
[52:42] as the lord provides i would like to
[52:44] keep them that way when you walk in
[52:47] to the left the remote control is there
[52:50] they are set currently on 73 degrees if
[52:53] you want it colder you can lower it if
[52:55] you want it warmer you can raise it just
[52:58] put it back at 73 degrees before you
[53:00] leave so that we can keep them climate
[53:03] controlled and comfortable there are new
[53:05] shades on the windows so you can feel
[53:07] private you don't feel like anybody's
[53:09] looking in on you
[53:10] and so
[53:12] right now i think that we need to
[53:16] not worry about new furniture we'll do
[53:18] that in a little while but we've got
[53:20] some other things that we need to tend
[53:22] to here on the campground
[53:24] namely this parking lot this parking lot
[53:26] is breaking apart we've got to get it
[53:28] resealed and so it's really necessary
[53:31] that we focus on that but uh i just
[53:34] wanted you to know that the prayer
[53:35] chapels are now ready for you to go in
[53:39] they're clean
[53:42] repaired
[53:44] i would ask that you don't scrutinize
[53:46] them too much i didn't build them and
[53:48] luke didn't build them
[53:50] their
[53:51] the ceilings are pretty wavy
[53:54] but
[53:54] they're freshly painted
[53:56] there's no broken sheetrock tape and so
[53:59] they're they're all i want to thank
[54:00] brother hawk for helping us to get the
[54:03] painting i want to thank brother steve
[54:05] polk for helping us to get the flooring
[54:07] because of brother steve polk the
[54:10] flooring in the doorways we didn't have
[54:12] to pay for it his company
[54:14] provided that and brother steve helped
[54:16] us to get it down i appreciate that
[54:17] brother steve brother david mann help us
[54:20] to get the new air conditioners
[54:21] installed
[54:24] and so they are ready for use and we're
[54:26] so thankful to the lord for that
[54:31] yes
[54:32] and you give god the glory because
[54:35] that's how it would want that's how
[54:37] folks want it to be is that god receives
[54:40] the glory and the praise but can i just
[54:42] tell you that during that whole
[54:44] restoration process that brother greeley
[54:46] started on his own and i thank god for
[54:49] those that came in and helped not one
[54:51] receipt has been turned in for
[54:53] reimbursement so as far as i know not
[54:56] one penny has come out of the church
[54:59] account to do that it has been done it
[55:02] has been taken care of i think we ought
[55:04] to really give god praise for providing
[55:07] it that way
[55:10] thank you lord thank you lord
[55:12] [Applause]
[55:13] hallelujah
[55:15] [Applause]
[55:20] it it was not inexpensive there's a lot
[55:23] of money involved in redoing anything
[55:26] and sometimes a little bit more when
[55:28] you're trying to redo
[55:30] but i really appreciate the fact that it
[55:32] was done that way and we didn't have to
[55:34] we didn't have to squeeze or or or you
[55:38] know borrow from peter to pay paul
[55:40] we were able to continue to take care of
[55:42] jerusalem we were able to continue to
[55:44] take care of the insurance we were able
[55:46] to continue to
[55:48] gather this money which will be your
[55:50] next announcement that's exactly right
[55:56] this is
[55:59] now this really this right here really
[56:02] really makes me happy
[56:04] because this week
[56:07] an eight thousand dollar payment was
[56:09] made on this property
[56:12] so that means as of today
[56:15] 232
[56:19] 355.96 has been given
[56:22] directly for the principle of the
[56:24] mortgage of this property
[56:26] that means that right now the current
[56:28] balance is at the halfway of where we
[56:31] started 238
[56:34] 258 dollars and 26 cents
[56:38] halfway folks in 16 months halfway by
[56:42] the goodness of god
[56:46] [Applause]

[56:56] we're going to do everything that god
[56:58] called us to do on this property i am
[57:01] expecting it to be fully accomplished
[57:04] because god's grace is so sufficient for
[57:07] us
[57:08] it doesn't matter what the naysayers
[57:10] might say god keeps his word
[57:14] amen he keeps his word

[1:09:07] and uh we're just a little over 50
[1:09:09] gathered here this morning
[1:09:11] and so many are out to protect us and
[1:09:14] for us to protect them and we we just
[1:09:17] want to make sure that we don't do
[1:09:19] anything to to spread unnecessarily
[1:09:22] this virus but i just want you to think
[1:09:25] of one thing
[1:09:27] i want you to think of the fact that
[1:09:29] this
[1:09:30] corona thank you thank you oh he's
[1:09:33] anticipating a double header
[1:09:36] um
[1:09:37] i don't know who laid those there i
[1:09:39] don't think these are the ones i got but
[1:09:41] thank you so much whoever did i
[1:09:42] appreciate it
[1:09:44] um
[1:09:45] and
[1:09:46] oh they smell good
[1:09:50] uh
[1:09:51] what was i saying
[1:09:54] thank you but you know that those
[1:09:56] different strains of virus have been
[1:09:58] around for a long time and you've had it
[1:10:00] many many times before it got to covet
[1:10:02] 19.
[1:10:04] you may have had it 18 other times
[1:10:07] i don't know how many times and that's
[1:10:09] why when it first came out they were
[1:10:10] showing on the lysol can that lysol
[1:10:13] would take care of that particular those
[1:10:15] strains that we were getting and now
[1:10:18] that we test we're going to be testing
[1:10:21] forever
[1:10:22] some people are going to be testing
[1:10:24] forever it seems but i do appreciate the
[1:10:27] fact that you all who got these symptoms
[1:10:30] you work also in the public and you test
[1:10:32] it and i appreciate you doing that and
[1:10:34] letting us know and pulling aside a
[1:10:37] little bit
[1:10:38] and uh because there are some elderly
[1:10:41] people here
[1:10:42] and uh
[1:10:44] yes you know it's coming
[1:10:47] you know it's coming don't you
[1:10:50] so i said to david because he's been in
[1:10:52] the house with ashley and i guess i
[1:10:55] guess you all are living together these
[1:10:57] days and
[1:10:58] she had the she had tested positive and
[1:11:02] the cdc is saying five days
[1:11:04] now at home away from the public
[1:11:08] and then you go out with a tightly fit
[1:11:10] fitting mask
[1:11:12] which i'm missing this morning but
[1:11:14] anyway
[1:11:15] um
[1:11:16] so i said to david no you all come but
[1:11:18] just be careful with the elderly you
[1:11:20] know just just be a little bit mindful
[1:11:22] of that and so david says something like
[1:11:25] this you know well i guess that means
[1:11:26] you won't get any hugs tomorrow
[1:11:31] calling me elderly
[1:11:34] yeah calling me elderly
[1:11:37] and i don't want his hugs any when i'm
[1:11:39] kidding
[1:11:40] i'm kidding and i guess compared to some
[1:11:43] of you i am antique but uh
[1:11:46] um
[1:11:47] i i i don't want to feel that way do you
[1:11:50] i want to want to feel good
[1:11:52] and uh so thank you so much the lord has
[1:11:55] been good to all of us this week and uh
[1:11:57] brother greeley mentioned ben and he
[1:11:59] mentioned him because he just came off
[1:12:02] this morning a 12-hour shift and i know
[1:12:04] that was hard to come right over here
[1:12:07] and uh and do what he has done but but
[1:12:10] what about miss emily you know just uh

[1:12:16] first babies born when i came to be the
[1:12:18] pastor here and there she is just
[1:12:20] shining on the piano
[1:12:22] let's thank god for that
[1:12:28] i'm glad that olivia found her courage
[1:12:31] when she was asked to fill in on the
[1:12:33] keyboard and i appreciate her for doing
[1:12:36] that and and she's very capable
[1:12:40] so we just it was just amazing how
[1:12:42] everything came together it looked a
[1:12:44] little dim all of our
[1:12:46] regular piano players gone and some of
[1:12:48] the ones we were considering asking gone
[1:12:52] and uh but you know ben was very i don't
[1:12:55] know how he was at home kendra but he
[1:12:57] was just very helpful very even-tempered
[1:13:00] about it with me anyway
[1:13:02] and he just arranged it and he just
[1:13:03] called on different ones and um you know
[1:13:06] i don't know how how much a piano
[1:13:09] playing brother josh does but he was
[1:13:11] willing to get up here and you know when
[1:13:13] you can sing like they sung it doesn't
[1:13:15] even matter they could have done that
[1:13:16] acapella but i appreciate him getting in
[1:13:19] there and i appreciate chad obeying the
[1:13:21] lord without having to be asked and and
[1:13:24] i was just taking back that he asked me
[1:13:26] because he he knows that he can always
[1:13:28] look folks you can obey the lord if you
[1:13:31] know it's the lord you can obey the lord
[1:13:34] you can obey the lord and i'm glad he
[1:13:36] did because we can honestly say today
[1:13:39] that it is well it is well
[1:13:42] no matter what it looks like or smells
[1:13:44] like or sounds like it is well
[1:13:47] and then i once again appreciate all
[1:13:49] these wonderful reports that brother
[1:13:51] greeley gave us today god is helping us
[1:13:54] along
[1:13:55] and you know the thought of having to
[1:13:57] resurface which is a very expensive
[1:13:59] project
[1:14:00] and the thought of that used to would
[1:14:02] have just overwhelmed me but you know
[1:14:04] how could you be overwhelmed with that
[1:14:07] when you see what the lord can do if you
[1:14:10] let him
[1:14:11] and i trust that god is giving back to
[1:14:13] you pressed down shaken together and
[1:14:15] running over if you're doing without
[1:14:17] food or doing without necessities to
[1:14:20] give
[1:14:21] i wouldn't encourage that beyond your
[1:14:23] tithe but if god if you're giving with
[1:14:26] the right heart i believe god is giving
[1:14:28] back to you and i don't believe you're
[1:14:30] missing it because that's just the way
[1:14:33] it works in the economy of heaven if you
[1:14:36] believe that same man
[1:14:37] so i want to say happy birthday today to
[1:14:41] uh our sister judith who has been away

[1:18:56] but i want you to know that this church
[1:18:59] is praying for the congregation
[1:19:01] in israel and we have been praying for
[1:19:03] you for many years
[1:19:05] in 2002 god laid it on our hearts
[1:19:09] and we have been praying that that the
[1:19:12] saints would be able to gather and
[1:19:13] encourage one another and bless one
[1:19:15] another in israel and so you all are
[1:19:18] never far from our hearts we know that
[1:19:21] you all have gone through some hardships
[1:19:23] there's been difficult times along the
[1:19:25] way but god has sustained his people
[1:19:29] in the land of the bible and i believe
[1:19:31] he will continue to do so in fact i
[1:19:34] would just say to you the best is yet to
[1:19:36] come in israel i believe that with all
[1:19:38] my heart god is not nearly through
[1:19:41] brother writers from cape town south
[1:19:44] africa god bless you our precious friend

[1:19:55] ready for the word of god today
[1:20:00] charity was unable to be here she has
[1:20:02] some mild symptoms and enough that she
[1:20:06] didn't want to ignore them
[1:20:08] brother
[1:20:09] daniel and sister anna miller or
[1:20:11] somewhere
[1:20:12] somewhere in the world
[1:20:15] busy
[1:20:16] and i'll just tell you that uh
[1:20:20] pulling
[1:20:22] mobile homes or motor homes or travel
[1:20:24] trailers that's the least of what they
[1:20:27] are busy with they're always ministering
[1:20:30] to somebody always answering somebody's
[1:20:32] call
[1:20:33] and praying for somebody and so we bless
[1:20:36] them on the road
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:41] i i
[1:20:43] appreciate
[1:20:45] mariah
[1:20:47] she has not
[1:20:49] been putting in the quotes and things
[1:20:50] until today and she was quite distraught
[1:20:53] this morning that she wouldn't be able
[1:20:55] to do it but i understand that she's
[1:20:57] done all right at it and i want to thank
[1:20:59] her and appreciate appreciate her for
[1:21:01] doing that this is a time for
[1:21:04] cross-training
[1:21:05] i want you to hear me because i think
[1:21:07] it's a little bit spiritual
[1:21:09] uh this is a time to train
[1:21:11] uh and kind of cross over in other words
[1:21:14] if we've got all these people sitting
[1:21:16] out here that can play the piano they
[1:21:18] need to be playing the piano
[1:21:21] that's right we need to put some uh
[1:21:24] second string third string
[1:21:26] on tuesday nights and get them used to
[1:21:29] playing our songs we have guitar players
[1:21:32] that don't get to play we need to get
[1:21:34] them up here get them playing on tuesday
[1:21:36] nights let's see how they do come on
[1:21:39] we've got violin violinists and we've
[1:21:42] got
[1:21:43] i don't know i think even flautist i'm
[1:21:45] going to have to pray about that one but
[1:21:47] anyway
[1:21:49] we have people who have talent
[1:21:52] it just takes a little bit of skill to
[1:21:54] put in the quotes it just takes a little
[1:21:56] bit of skill to run that projector these
[1:21:58] cameras we need cameramen we need backup
[1:22:01] on the sound we we just we have the jobs
[1:22:05] we just want to make it available to
[1:22:07] those who desire to help us it's not
[1:22:10] right for somebody to have to do it
[1:22:12] all the time and never get to be a
[1:22:14] complete part of the service
[1:22:17] and the truth is some just do it so well
[1:22:20] until we just want them doing it
[1:22:23] but but we need to cross train here
[1:22:26] because we have busy times ahead
[1:22:29] and we are maintaining two services a
[1:22:32] week but we anticipate that with what
[1:22:35] god is doing we will have to go to three
[1:22:38] services at some point
[1:22:41] because the people are crying out for it
[1:22:44] and so we've got to be ready to meet
[1:22:46] that need
[1:22:47] and so uh anyway
[1:22:51] i just happened to say to the brothers
[1:22:53] on sunday afternoon in my office we got
[1:22:56] to do something about that sidewalk that
[1:22:58] little lady fell and hurt her foot toe
[1:23:00] toe and and we've got to do something
[1:23:02] about it and that was all i said
[1:23:05] and then days later somebody said well
[1:23:07] did you see that the sidewalk was fixed
[1:23:09] well no i don't walk on the sidewalk
[1:23:11] very often it was already done finished
[1:23:14] and i didn't even know it was done
[1:23:17] that's god he just provided he put that
[1:23:19] on their heart they got it done before
[1:23:21] we could ever i could ever go out there
[1:23:23] and look at it it was already fixed
[1:23:25] this means that people are feeling
[1:23:28] their their responsibility to god's work
[1:23:32] and you may you may not call this
[1:23:34] revival but it is revival
[1:23:37] because when our hearts are reconnected
[1:23:39] with the work of the lord we are in some
[1:23:42] form of revival
[1:23:44] personal revival that makes us see the
[1:23:47] need and others who can't be here to
[1:23:50] physically do that but who give extra
[1:23:52] and they say wherever the need is just
[1:23:54] put it on the need and brother david has
[1:23:57] really worked hard and sacrificed in the
[1:23:59] heat they said he was a wet just a
[1:24:02] dripping wet
[1:24:03] man yesterday after being up there and
[1:24:05] all those who helped him
[1:24:07] oftentimes we don't even know who does
[1:24:10] what so it's good that we take this
[1:24:12] opportunity to thank all of you for what
[1:24:15] you do
[1:24:16] if you walk over a piece of trash shame
[1:24:19] on you
[1:24:20] pick it up
[1:24:21] if you step over a water bottle don't be
[1:24:24] that kind of a person if you see a weed
[1:24:27] don't wait on somebody else to pluck it
[1:24:29] if you're able pluck it
[1:24:31] then you have an investment
[1:24:33] then you are making a part and you'll
[1:24:36] get the blessing
[1:24:37] i'm telling you you'll get the blessing
[1:24:40] anybody here
[1:24:42] ephesians chapter 1.
[1:24:45] i'm going to need your help today this
[1:24:47] is going to be part 2
[1:24:50] of a word sent from god
[1:24:52] and we're going to be doing a lot of
[1:24:54] quotations because we didn't get them in
[1:24:56] on sunday but all of you that were here
[1:24:59] last sunday i want you to just remind
[1:25:02] yourself of what you were hearing and i
[1:25:06] had so many comments
[1:25:08] that came back and said i loved the end
[1:25:11] of the service when brother greeley and
[1:25:13] brother austin were preaching the
[1:25:15] message back to you i loved that people
[1:25:18] loved it they thought now that's one way
[1:25:20] to make sure people get it
[1:25:23] is have them to express it and
[1:25:26] so you just start thinking now i want
[1:25:29] you to see before we read that the holy
[1:25:32] spirit is brooding over the water and
[1:25:35] the seed of god is laying there want you
[1:25:38] to remember all of that i want you to
[1:25:40] remember the scriptures that were read
[1:25:42] because we're going to move forward
[1:25:44] ephesians chapter 1
[1:25:46] beginning in verse 3 all the way to
[1:25:49] verse 12 blessed be the god and father
[1:25:52] of our lord jesus christ who have
[1:25:56] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:26:00] in heavenly places in christ according
[1:26:04] as he hath chosen us in him
[1:26:08] before the foundation of the world that
[1:26:12] we should be holy
[1:26:15] i want you to say holy
[1:26:18] and without blame before him
[1:26:21] in love
[1:26:23] having predestinated
[1:26:25] us
[1:26:26] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[1:26:31] christ to himself
[1:26:33] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:26:36] will
[1:26:37] why did he do it
[1:26:39] because it pleased him
[1:26:42] to do it
[1:26:43] i like that did you know you are here
[1:26:46] because it brought the father pleasure
[1:26:49] to place you here at this time
[1:26:52] in the earth and even in this body if
[1:26:55] you listen to what brother branham was
[1:26:57] saying he did it according to the good
[1:26:59] pleasure of his will to the pray to the
[1:27:02] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[1:27:07] he had made us accepted in the beloved i
[1:27:11] appreciate that in whom we have
[1:27:13] redemption through his blood
[1:27:16] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:27:19] riches of his grace don't ever let
[1:27:21] predestination cause you
[1:27:24] to diminish in your heart your
[1:27:27] appreciation for the blood
[1:27:30] and for the grace of god
[1:27:32] blood was the token price but grace was
[1:27:35] the vehicle
[1:27:37] that got that blood to you had it not
[1:27:39] been for grace
[1:27:41] the blood could have been there but it
[1:27:42] wouldn't have been on you it wouldn't
[1:27:44] have been for you but grace brought us
[1:27:46] to the blood and the blood finished the
[1:27:49] work wherein he hath abounded toward us
[1:27:52] in all
[1:27:54] wisdom and prudence
[1:27:56] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:28:01] his will i'm so thankful that we can
[1:28:04] know the reason
[1:28:06] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:28:09] hath purposed in himself
[1:28:12] we're still reading that in the
[1:28:14] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:28:19] might gather together in one
[1:28:21] all things in christ both which are in
[1:28:26] heaven and which are on earth
[1:28:29] even
[1:28:30] in him
[1:28:31] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:28:35] inheritance hallelujah being pre and
[1:28:37] notice that we have obtained an
[1:28:41] inheritance
[1:28:42] being predestinated according to the
[1:28:45] purpose of him who worketh let's read
[1:28:48] that together
[1:28:49] all things after the council of his own
[1:28:54] will he didn't have to take counsel with
[1:28:56] anybody else he didn't have to call a
[1:28:58] committee meeting with anybody else he
[1:29:01] took counsel from his own will
[1:29:04] praise god for that that we should be
[1:29:08] to the praise of his glory who first
[1:29:12] trusted in christ we are to be the
[1:29:15] praise of his glory our life is the

[1:31:18] now in the message things that are to be
[1:31:23] i want you to see
[1:31:24] i want you to to uh get this in your
[1:31:28] heart today that when we say i was once
[1:31:31] a thought
[1:31:32] in the mind of god brother branham says
[1:31:34] that thoughts are equal to attributes
[1:31:38] do you understand
[1:31:40] are you do you understand what i'm
[1:31:41] saying
[1:31:44] a thought is the same as an attribute
[1:31:47] brother branham said an attribute is a
[1:31:49] thought
[1:31:50] now we hear him talking about
[1:31:53] god expressing these attributes and he
[1:31:56] names some of them he said it was in god
[1:32:00] meaning in his mind to be a father
[1:32:04] it was in god to be a healer it was in
[1:32:07] his mind to be a redeemer to be a
[1:32:10] deliverer he said these were attributes
[1:32:14] of god in another place he said it was
[1:32:17] in him to be a father it was in him to
[1:32:20] be a son it was in him to be holy ghost
[1:32:22] he said also these are attributes of god
[1:32:26] i want you to know who you are
[1:32:29] the same thing that was in god that
[1:32:32] caused him to have the desire to be a
[1:32:34] healer that's what you are you're a
[1:32:37] thought
[1:32:38] that has been expressed you were once a
[1:32:41] thought that was actually an attribute
[1:32:45] in the mind of god i want to make sure
[1:32:47] that you don't just look at the word
[1:32:49] attribute as though it were a
[1:32:51] characteristic or as though it were a
[1:32:53] job to do or an office to fulfill i want
[1:32:57] you to know that every thought in the
[1:32:59] mind of god before the foundation of the
[1:33:02] world was an attribute in itself
[1:33:06] hallelujah
[1:33:07] so what did god do somebody had to be
[1:33:10] sick so that god could uh express
[1:33:13] himself as a healer
[1:33:17] so god had a thought
[1:33:19] you were that thought
[1:33:21] you were that attribute and in order for
[1:33:24] that thought or that attribute to come
[1:33:27] to pass and to fulfill his will
[1:33:31] you had to be spoken
[1:33:34] because a word is a thought that has
[1:33:37] been spoken or that has been expressed i
[1:33:41] want to go back to things that are to be
[1:33:44] in paragraph 33 we're going to study a
[1:33:47] little bit maybe not preach as much but
[1:33:49] study a little bit together he said now
[1:33:52] if we are those attributes of god
[1:33:58] because there's going to be those who
[1:34:00] hear this
[1:34:01] and hear last sunday and they're going
[1:34:03] to say
[1:34:05] i think you're taking it a little bit
[1:34:08] too far when you say that i am a word
[1:34:13] sent from god
[1:34:14] because people are a little nervous
[1:34:16] about you placing yourself with the
[1:34:19] bible
[1:34:20] that's exactly where you're supposed to
[1:34:22] be placed
[1:34:24] in the bible
[1:34:27] if john 3 16 is a word sent from god so
[1:34:31] is stephen lamar shelly
[1:34:36] now you you you've got to understand the
[1:34:38] thought you've got to understand the
[1:34:40] attribute to be able to draw that
[1:34:42] comparison
[1:34:43] and understand we're talking about the
[1:34:45] same thing a thought expressed now if we
[1:34:49] are those attributes of god we cannot
[1:34:53] live by
[1:34:58] creeds there are creeds outside of the
[1:35:02] message
[1:35:03] they have even built some creeds around
[1:35:07] the message
[1:35:09] yes creeds
[1:35:11] man's ideas
[1:35:13] man's ideas that don't line up with the
[1:35:16] book
[1:35:17] with the word
[1:35:19] i want to get rid of that in my life i
[1:35:21] don't want to live by any creed i want
[1:35:23] to live by the word
[1:35:25] we cannot live by denominationalism
[1:35:30] brother branham said that's mark of the
[1:35:31] beast
[1:35:33] all right we go on we must live by the
[1:35:35] word
[1:35:37] why because the bride is a part of the
[1:35:42] bridegroom
[1:35:45] now who is the bridegroom
[1:35:48] jesus christ lord jesus christ is our
[1:35:50] bridegroom
[1:35:52] you're a part
[1:35:53] of the bridegroom bride is a part of the
[1:35:56] bridegroom so you are a part of the lord
[1:35:59] jesus christ is that all right to know
[1:36:02] it's powerful to know
[1:36:04] he said why because the bride is a part
[1:36:06] of the bridegroom like any wife is a
[1:36:08] part of her husband
[1:36:10] but i would like to say to brother
[1:36:12] branham
[1:36:13] now this could get me in big trouble but
[1:36:16] i would like to say to brother adam that
[1:36:18] the relationship between the heavenly
[1:36:21] bridegroom and the earthly bride is a
[1:36:23] higher order
[1:36:25] i would like to say that the
[1:36:27] relationship between a husband and a
[1:36:28] wife on the earth is patterned after
[1:36:31] that relationship not the other way
[1:36:33] around
[1:36:34] i would just like to kind of clarify
[1:36:36] that without making any any there's no
[1:36:40] correction to be made here it's just
[1:36:42] drawing your attention to the fact that
[1:36:45] that relationship that you have with him
[1:36:48] is of a higher order
[1:36:50] and anything we do down here is based on
[1:36:53] that relationship
[1:36:55] he said therefore we must be
[1:36:58] that word
[1:37:00] bride
[1:37:02] i'm a part of the word
[1:37:04] i'm a part of the word
[1:37:07] i am a word
[1:37:09] sent from god
[1:37:11] all right and he said and what is that
[1:37:15] word bride question
[1:37:17] the manifestation of this hour
[1:37:25] the manifestation of this hour
[1:37:29] the bride
[1:37:31] when the word
[1:37:33] manifests itself in this hour it does it
[1:37:38] in bride form
[1:37:42] how is the word manifested in this hour
[1:37:45] word form
[1:37:49] now you believe christ has come
[1:37:52] how many of you believe christ has come
[1:37:55] does anybody believe he is coming
[1:37:58] but that he has come
[1:38:00] he's come in word form
[1:38:03] he's coming now in bride form
[1:38:06] he's coming again
[1:38:07] in a body form
[1:38:09] there it is
[1:38:11] and that's not somebody making it up
[1:38:13] that's exactly what we've seen in our
[1:38:15] day
[1:38:16] the lord jesus christ himself has
[1:38:20] descended in word form in the message of
[1:38:24] the hour
[1:38:25] we are now at the closing of the gentile
[1:38:28] dispensation and at the closing of the
[1:38:31] gentile dispensation another coming is
[1:38:34] being revealed
[1:38:36] it's his coming in bride form
[1:38:43] which is a many-membered body form
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] it came in one body
[1:38:50] all the way through
[1:38:52] but now he's coming in many membered
[1:38:55] body form
[1:38:57] meaning you and i
[1:38:59] oh
[1:39:00] hallelujah
[1:39:01] in a minute i just can't hardly wait to
[1:39:03] get there but in a minute you're going
[1:39:05] to find out why you had to be
[1:39:07] transferred
[1:39:08] from the mind of god as an attribute to
[1:39:11] the earth
[1:39:12] there was a very distinct reason why god
[1:39:15] wanted to get you out of his mind
[1:39:18] and into the fulfillment of his plan
[1:39:21] and i want you to be able to see that in
[1:39:22] just a minute
[1:39:24] all right he said the manifestation of
[1:39:26] this hour the bride not a creed or a
[1:39:29] denomination
[1:39:31] and may i say or an organization
[1:39:37] because when you start identifying
[1:39:40] yourself as an organization you're
[1:39:43] identifying yourself with creeds of man
[1:39:46] the word of god cannot be organized the
[1:39:49] word of god cannot be denominationalized
[1:39:52] the word of god cannot be changed into a
[1:39:55] creed if you believe that same man
[1:39:58] he said the manifestation of this hour
[1:40:00] the bride not a creed or a denomination
[1:40:04] but a living
[1:40:08] what is an oracle
[1:40:10] a word
[1:40:13] a living oracle
[1:40:15] of god that's who you are
[1:40:18] you are a living oracle of god be
[1:40:19] careful what you say
[1:40:21] because you're a living oracle of god
[1:40:24] look at after the comma a living
[1:40:27] attribute
[1:40:28] of god
[1:40:30] i'm just coming out of this this morning
[1:40:32] a living
[1:40:34] attribute of god
[1:40:37] displaying to the world
[1:40:41] the attributes
[1:40:44] of god
[1:40:46] whoop
[1:40:47] in the formation
[1:40:49] of the bride
[1:40:51] my lord of mercy come on
[1:40:53] but a living oracle of god a
[1:40:56] living attribute of god displaying to
[1:40:59] the world the attributes plural of god
[1:41:03] in the formation of the bride that's to
[1:41:06] be expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:41:11] living
[1:41:13] hallelujah
[1:41:14] there was a bunch of attributes that
[1:41:17] could not be expressed in ephesus
[1:41:22] there was a bunch of attributes that
[1:41:25] could not be expressed in smyrna or
[1:41:27] pergamus or thyatera philadelphia any of
[1:41:31] the other church ages
[1:41:33] they could only be expressed in the last
[1:41:36] days in the hour that we're now living
[1:41:39] in when there would be a real formation
[1:41:42] of the bride
[1:41:43] anybody here
[1:41:45] remember when i was in jerusalem and he
[1:41:47] caught me up into a heavenly place
[1:41:50] and introduced me to the messengers of
[1:41:52] the seven church ages
[1:41:54] now that's one thing i know is real
[1:41:58] now i know there's some controversy
[1:42:00] there we might not have the dates just
[1:42:02] right but we've got the messengers right
[1:42:07] because i've had a confirmation
[1:42:10] that that it is so
[1:42:12] and in that experience i was told that
[1:42:15] in the same way
[1:42:17] that all the evil
[1:42:20] of the other ages of the church ages
[1:42:23] that all the evil was gathered together
[1:42:27] into the age of laodicea
[1:42:30] so everything evil from ephesus and
[1:42:33] smyrna and pergamus and all these other
[1:42:36] church ages
[1:42:37] it was gathered together and expressed
[1:42:41] again
[1:42:42] in laodicea
[1:42:44] the most evil and wicked age the age of
[1:42:47] people's rights the most evil and wicked
[1:42:50] age of all the other church ages are you
[1:42:52] with me but remember he told me in that
[1:42:54] experience that in the same way
[1:42:57] in the same manner that all the evil of
[1:43:00] all the other church ages had been
[1:43:02] gathered into laodicea he said i have
[1:43:04] also gathered together the overcoming
[1:43:07] portion
[1:43:10] hallelujah
[1:43:12] so not only is this the culmination of
[1:43:14] evil in laodicea but it's also the
[1:43:17] culmination of all the overcoming
[1:43:21] portions
[1:43:22] so what god gave to ephesus and what god
[1:43:25] gave to smyrna and what god gave to all
[1:43:28] of these other pergamos and all the
[1:43:30] other church ages
[1:43:32] he has gathered together to form a bride
[1:43:36] like no other who will come out of
[1:43:39] laodicea
[1:43:41] she will have experienced the evil of
[1:43:44] every church age
[1:43:47] but she will come forth with the
[1:43:50] overcoming power that was given to all
[1:43:54] the other church ages
[1:43:56] why because christ has to come in bribed
[1:44:01] form
[1:44:05] he has to
[1:44:06] he's come in word for him
[1:44:09] he has to come in bride form
[1:44:12] hallelujah
[1:44:14] we're not preaching church ages book
[1:44:16] here we're preaching what the prophet
[1:44:18] said in the sermons
[1:44:20] all righty goes on i got to read the
[1:44:22] rest of this martin luther
[1:44:25] could not express
[1:44:34] think of this
[1:44:38] you know in that experience i had quite
[1:44:40] a quite a conversation with martin
[1:44:42] luther
[1:44:44] for those of you that hadn't read it
[1:44:47] he he apologized to me
[1:44:51] that's pretty humbling
[1:44:53] because he knew how i felt about him
[1:44:56] i didn't have to tell him nobody had to
[1:44:58] tell him he knew
[1:45:00] how i felt about him
[1:45:02] he said some terrible things
[1:45:06] he said some horrible things
[1:45:08] about the jews
[1:45:10] he said many things that were wrong
[1:45:13] that are in error
[1:45:16] that are not the truth
[1:45:19] and yet he was still
[1:45:21] the church age messenger
[1:45:26] i'm not trying to draw any i'm just
[1:45:27] telling you
[1:45:29] didn't get it all right
[1:45:32] but he got just shall live by faith
[1:45:34] right
[1:45:36] john wesley was a trinitarian
[1:45:40] he didn't get the godhead right he
[1:45:41] didn't get the baptism right but he got
[1:45:44] the washing of the water by the word
[1:45:46] through sanctification he got that right
[1:45:49] so we had to have a messenger who would
[1:45:51] come in the last days who would tie
[1:45:53] together
[1:45:54] all the loose sins left over by the
[1:45:57] other messages
[1:45:59] in fact he said when that seventh angel
[1:46:00] comes he will not have a message of his
[1:46:03] own
[1:46:07] we're always talking about brother
[1:46:08] branham's message
[1:46:09] but he said that messenger will have no
[1:46:11] message of his own it'll just be to tie
[1:46:14] together all the loose sins
[1:46:17] to to eliminate all the excuses
[1:46:21] of what we didn't see and what we didn't
[1:46:23] hear and what we didn't know
[1:46:25] so that we could be fully accountable to
[1:46:27] every word of god this laodicean bride
[1:46:30] coming out she is accountable for every
[1:46:34] word of god
[1:46:36] we're not under the cloak under the fog
[1:46:39] of of half truths
[1:46:41] like all the other church ages were
[1:46:44] because here's a man preaching one day
[1:46:45] that just shall live by faith and the
[1:46:47] trinity of god the next day
[1:46:52] here was a man like wesley preaching
[1:46:53] sanctification one day baptizing
[1:46:55] entitles the next
[1:47:00] the most wonderful thing about these
[1:47:02] church-age messengers is that they were
[1:47:04] able to hold their head
[1:47:07] above the fanaticism that surrounded
[1:47:09] their message
[1:47:11] that's how brother branham was able to
[1:47:12] come out strong and say if you say that
[1:47:15] jesus christ lives in me i pray that you
[1:47:17] are right
[1:47:18] but if you're making me him if you're
[1:47:20] putting me there in that place you are
[1:47:22] making me antichrist
[1:47:26] you're not jesus christ you're mrs jesus
[1:47:30] christ but you came from christ
[1:47:33] and i'll show you a little bit later and
[1:47:35] you're going right back to where you
[1:47:36] come from
[1:47:37] isn't that a comforting thought see
[1:47:39] martin luther could not express the
[1:47:41] attributes that we express
[1:47:44] because that was in the beginning
[1:47:47] the resurrection like the corn of wheat
[1:47:50] that went into the earth
[1:47:53] he's talking about that re
[1:47:55] we could say really we could call it
[1:47:57] re-restoration
[1:47:59] because because it was a restoration of
[1:48:02] truth lost during the dark ages that
[1:48:06] came right in in the middle of the
[1:48:08] church ages
[1:48:10] so now we got to build back up we once
[1:48:12] had it right we lost it now we got to
[1:48:14] build it back up and god sent a luther
[1:48:17] to put things back in proper balance
[1:48:20] concerning justification
[1:48:22] and he raised up a wesley to place
[1:48:24] things right
[1:48:26] right back in proper order concerning
[1:48:29] sanctification
[1:48:31] and then there was a pentecostal age
[1:48:37] i believe it was clarence larkin who
[1:48:39] said
[1:48:40] that the laodicean church age began in
[1:48:44] uh
[1:48:45] 1900
[1:48:47] and brother branham oh brother branham
[1:48:49] was the one that put it back to 1900.
[1:48:50] can we get that can someone look that
[1:48:52] for me
[1:48:54] brother branham put it in 1906 that's
[1:48:56] what i thought
[1:48:58] larkin put it at 1900. there are only
[1:49:01] two variations
[1:49:04] in what larkin said about the dates of
[1:49:06] the church ages and what brother branham
[1:49:09] said about the church ages and that's
[1:49:10] one of them he placed it at 1906 because
[1:49:13] that was the beginning of the azusa
[1:49:15] street revival he believed that that
[1:49:17] being the birthday of the modern church
[1:49:19] the modern pentecostal church that was
[1:49:21] the beginning of the last church age
[1:49:24] and if you hear him talking about the
[1:49:26] purpose listen carefully
[1:49:29] if you hear him talking about the
[1:49:30] purpose of this restoration he tells us
[1:49:33] right what it was for it was to put
[1:49:36] healing back
[1:49:38] it was to put the holy ghost back
[1:49:42] laodicea laodicea
[1:49:44] that's that's a church age you identify
[1:49:46] with correct
[1:49:48] i mean i'm living in a bright age over
[1:49:49] here at the end of laodicea that's what
[1:49:51] the word tells us but we most identify
[1:49:53] with laodicea as a church age he said
[1:49:56] and it was also for the
[1:49:59] restoration
[1:50:03] you know what i'm gonna say
[1:50:05] you know
[1:50:06] of the gifts
[1:50:10] isn't it amazing that god would go to so
[1:50:12] much trouble
[1:50:14] to put back in the church what the enemy
[1:50:17] had stolen away only to let the message
[1:50:20] preachers come around now and take away
[1:50:23] from us
[1:50:26] what laodicea restored
[1:50:29] i don't think people even know the
[1:50:30] church age
[1:50:32] i don't even think some of those that
[1:50:33] walk around with a church age book under
[1:50:35] their arm like it's a bible or something
[1:50:37] i don't think they even realize what the
[1:50:40] church ages are about
[1:50:42] because if you did you would understand
[1:50:45] that that it was a restoration of the
[1:50:47] original pentecost
[1:50:52] don't come around here at the end of the
[1:50:53] age and tell us that we now no longer
[1:50:56] need the gifts we no longer need the
[1:50:59] holy ghost
[1:51:01] when it took seven church ages to put it
[1:51:04] back in
[1:51:06] you think the bride is going to let you
[1:51:08] take it away from us now
[1:51:12] never
[1:51:14] sure there must be a proper order sure
[1:51:16] it must fulfill its biblical purpose but
[1:51:19] we can't let you take away from us what
[1:51:21] it took seven church ages to give us
[1:51:23] back
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:26] maybe we need to look at some of those
[1:51:27] quotes but not this morning
[1:51:29] martin luther could not express the
[1:51:31] attributes that we express
[1:51:33] because that was in the beginning now
[1:51:34] let's go to modern events
[1:51:37] are made clear by prophecy
[1:51:40] san bernardino california
[1:51:43] paragraph 118 and so will the church
[1:51:45] come
[1:51:46] through
[1:51:47] justification
[1:51:49] sanctification
[1:51:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:51:57] check that quote
[1:51:59] someone check that one for me
[1:52:01] check it on your phone make sure i
[1:52:02] didn't add that
[1:52:13] okay good thank you very much that's
[1:52:16] just what it said
[1:52:20] we didn't highlight it
[1:52:23] because we don't want to emphasize it
[1:52:26] any more than we emphasize anything else
[1:52:28] we thought the other needed to be
[1:52:30] emphasized but we want to make sure it's
[1:52:32] supposed to be there
[1:52:34] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:52:38] the holy ghost restoration of gifts
[1:52:42] right on into the formed
[1:52:46] image
[1:52:48] of christ
[1:52:52] which is justification sanctification
[1:52:56] baptism the holy ghost restoration of
[1:52:58] the gifts
[1:52:59] right into christ
[1:53:01] remember what the man said to brother
[1:53:03] branham about the scaffold work
[1:53:07] he just called these things the scaffold
[1:53:09] work brother graham said here but you
[1:53:10] need to know this you don't take the
[1:53:12] scaffold work down
[1:53:15] until the building has been perfectly
[1:53:16] completed
[1:53:18] you got to have it you got to have it
[1:53:20] you got to have it i want you to know i
[1:53:22] believe the gifts will be manifesting as
[1:53:24] the bride is leaving making her exit
[1:53:27] jesus not speaking in tongues the
[1:53:29] prophet said that god will too
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:36] i'm just quoting i i mean i added a
[1:53:38] little bit there the bride will too but
[1:53:40] brother braham said jesus died speaking
[1:53:41] in tongues
[1:53:43] now i want you to pray for me
[1:53:46] because
[1:53:47] sometime
[1:53:49] it could be as soon
[1:53:52] as next sunday
[1:53:55] but i
[1:53:57] next sunday is the 31st so it'll most
[1:53:59] likely be the seventh
[1:54:01] but some time soon
[1:54:03] i'm going to begin a series
[1:54:06] on tongues
[1:54:09] diverse tongues
[1:54:11] speaking in tongues
[1:54:14] and messages in tongues
[1:54:15] because they're all the same
[1:54:17] so we're going to talk about that and
[1:54:19] people have been waiting for it
[1:54:20] anticipating it coming
[1:54:22] and and i'm almost ready to start it i
[1:54:24] don't have all my notes together but i'm
[1:54:26] almost ready to start it i'm ashamed to
[1:54:28] tell you i've been working on it two
[1:54:29] years
[1:54:30] maybe longer
[1:54:32] maybe three
[1:54:34] just gathering the balance
[1:54:37] see
[1:54:38] because if i'm going to read you
[1:54:41] the quotes where brother branham talks
[1:54:42] about speaking in tongues
[1:54:44] being like
[1:54:45] peas on a on a dry peas on a cowhide
[1:54:49] those are the ones that people love so
[1:54:51] much when they're taking tongues out
[1:54:54] i'm going to read them
[1:54:56] but i'm going to read the other ones too
[1:54:59] where he said that's the only kind
[1:55:03] that's the only kind the word gives
[1:55:04] birth to
[1:55:06] that kind of baby
[1:55:08] now that's just recently some powerful
[1:55:10] things that i was able to find that i
[1:55:12] think will help us so perhaps
[1:55:14] by the first sunday of august since i
[1:55:17] just realized we have one more week in
[1:55:18] july i may can do that i think some of
[1:55:21] you will appreciate that study pretty
[1:55:23] pretty good
[1:55:25] uh let's go on
[1:55:28] christ
[1:55:29] let me just start and read it over again
[1:55:31] so we can flow
[1:55:33] and so will the church come through
[1:55:35] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:55:38] the holy ghost restoration of gifts
[1:55:41] right on into the formed image of christ
[1:55:44] christ is the bridegroom
[1:55:46] the church is the bride and the bride is
[1:55:49] a part
[1:55:50] of the bridegroom
[1:55:53] it'll have to be a word
[1:55:56] church
[1:56:00] now that takes out the creeds that takes
[1:56:02] out the not a denominational church
[1:56:06] it'll be the word church
[1:56:08] the word that's made known
[1:56:11] and by
[1:56:13] the vindicated
[1:56:15] word of god how many of you are thankful
[1:56:17] for the message of this hour
[1:56:19] now in the message christ is the mystery
[1:56:22] of god revealed i know it's a little
[1:56:24] different got a lot of quotes stay with
[1:56:26] me paragraph 184 predestinated
[1:56:30] there's the mystery
[1:56:33] he before christ or anything else was
[1:56:37] ever on earth
[1:56:39] you see
[1:56:40] his great mystery
[1:56:44] somebody read that for me
[1:56:47] the great mystery is that he chose
[1:56:51] the bride
[1:56:52] knowing eve would fall
[1:56:55] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[1:56:57] she would fall
[1:56:59] but he would choose a bride that would
[1:57:01] not fall
[1:57:03] hallelujah how is it that she will not
[1:57:06] fall she will hold to that word
[1:57:09] regardless of what all the rest of the
[1:57:12] world has to say about it
[1:57:15] here we are
[1:57:16] holding on to the word
[1:57:19] no matter what the world or the church
[1:57:22] world has to say about it we're holding
[1:57:24] on
[1:57:25] isn't that good
[1:57:28] they would hold to that word they are
[1:57:31] predestinated to stand there
[1:57:35] then he defines that by saying the
[1:57:37] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:57:41] predestinated the church to that great
[1:57:45] glorious
[1:57:46] stand
[1:57:48] now what is that great glorious stand
[1:57:51] it's to stand on the word
[1:57:54] someone read ephesians 1 we don't have
[1:57:56] it
[1:57:57] we didn't pull it up but someone get
[1:57:59] ephesians 1
[1:58:00] verse 3 and 4 you have it elias
[1:58:03] let me hand you the microphone read that
[1:58:05] for us
[1:58:09] just a moment let's see the mute comes
[1:58:11] off yes
[1:58:13] read that for us please
[1:58:14] one
[1:58:15] verse
[1:58:17] three and four
[1:58:18] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:58:20] lord jesus christ
[1:58:22] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:58:24] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[1:58:27] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:58:30] before the foundation of the world that
[1:58:32] we should be holy and without blame
[1:58:34] before him in love amen just what we
[1:58:37] read at the beginning amen but now just
[1:58:39] three and four thank you so much
[1:58:42] brother branham is saying
[1:58:44] predestinated the church to that great
[1:58:48] glorious stand
[1:58:49] and we've just defined the stand by
[1:58:52] having our brother read it he said now
[1:58:54] you see his secret
[1:58:57] watch
[1:58:58] what to
[1:58:59] to restore
[1:59:01] fallen eve
[1:59:03] i'm not sure you're with me
[1:59:05] will you get there
[1:59:07] as she was a prefigure
[1:59:11] of the church
[1:59:12] and now notice as god opened up the side
[1:59:16] of adam
[1:59:18] and took out eve
[1:59:20] by his own flesh and blood
[1:59:24] and divided his spirit from masculine
[1:59:28] and feminish
[1:59:29] to feminish
[1:59:31] and put it
[1:59:32] in eve now notice
[1:59:35] he reached into adam
[1:59:39] took from his spirit
[1:59:43] part of that spirit god's spirit in adam
[1:59:48] was male
[1:59:49] part of it was female
[1:59:51] feminist
[1:59:52] god divided
[1:59:54] that spirit from
[1:59:56] male here to remain in adam and the
[1:59:59] feminist he placed in
[2:00:02] eve he put it in eve let's read on
[2:00:05] so powerful
[2:00:08] took the rib from under his side and
[2:00:12] made eve out of it
[2:00:16] so did the same thing listen
[2:00:19] taking out
[2:00:20] of the side of christ
[2:00:27] the blood and the water
[2:00:30] and christ is the word and taking the
[2:00:32] word and making up his church eve see
[2:00:36] back to himself
[2:00:38] again
[2:00:40] redeemed by the blood that must come
[2:00:43] from his body
[2:00:46] oh
[2:00:48] that's powerful
[2:00:50] that's powerful
[2:00:53] now let's go on christ is the mystery of
[2:00:55] god revealed same message paragraph 384
[2:01:01] but the eve in the last day
[2:01:06] is not going to do it she's not going to
[2:01:08] misbelieve
[2:01:09] she's not going to take human reasoning
[2:01:13] the eve in the last day is not going to
[2:01:16] do it how do we know
[2:01:18] because she
[2:01:19] predestinated
[2:01:21] not
[2:01:22] to do it
[2:01:24] that's the bride yes sir god's going to
[2:01:27] do it he knows he'll have it
[2:01:30] he said church would be there
[2:01:32] without his church would be there
[2:01:35] without spot or wrinkle now look
[2:01:38] she is going to stand there
[2:01:40] in the splendor of him
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:44] and what is she going to be
[2:01:49] i am a word sent from god
[2:01:52] his word made manifest
[2:01:55] my i can show you where brother branham
[2:01:57] said just like the word put on flesh in
[2:01:59] the day of jesus the word is putting on
[2:02:01] flesh in the last day powerful isn't it
[2:02:05] no wonder it's called a bride coming of
[2:02:07] christ are you with me
[2:02:09] don't miss this
[2:02:11] i know for some of you it's a little bit
[2:02:12] different but look at 385 just one just
[2:02:15] one little quote just one sentence it'll
[2:02:17] shake the whole world
[2:02:19] shield the rod she'll be a token
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:24] to the world
[2:02:28] why were you born to be a token
[2:02:31] to the world
[2:02:33] somebody has to display who jesus is
[2:02:38] somebody has to be a living attribute of
[2:02:40] god
[2:02:42] somebody has to be the living word for
[2:02:45] this hour
[2:02:46] she'll be a token
[2:02:48] to the world
[2:02:50] in the message identification you're
[2:02:51] keeping up quite well
[2:02:55] uh paragraph
[2:02:56] 55 it's just a little short one i like
[2:02:59] it he said the whole thing is god
[2:03:02] becoming material
[2:03:07] like a husband and wife becoming one
[2:03:09] together god and his church becoming one
[2:03:14] i am a word
[2:03:16] i am a word
[2:03:18] i am a word sent from god i am a word
[2:03:21] sent from god
[2:03:23] say it again i am a word
[2:03:25] sin from god we've got a lot more to go
[2:03:27] through are you still here
[2:03:29] good
[2:03:30] in the message the identification of
[2:03:32] christ in all ages
[2:03:34] preached in birmingham alabama
[2:03:37] the prophet said it's god
[2:03:39] manifested in flesh
[2:03:42] now
[2:03:47] now
[2:03:49] in the flesh
[2:03:55] i'm a word sent from god i am a word sin
[2:03:57] from god i'm a word sin from god i'm a
[2:03:59] word sin from god
[2:04:01] it's god men of now you want to come
[2:04:03] along and tell me that
[2:04:04] you're going to have to struggle with
[2:04:11] lust the rest of your life you're going
[2:04:13] to have to struggle with jealousy the
[2:04:15] rest of your life you're going to have
[2:04:16] to struggle with pornography the rest of
[2:04:18] your life
[2:04:24] and you're here to be god manifested in
[2:04:27] flesh
[2:04:32] no he was tempted in all manner even as
[2:04:35] we are
[2:04:37] yet without sin
[2:04:38] to show you and i that it's possible and
[2:04:41] that there will be a word bride in the
[2:04:42] last days who walk above it
[2:04:46] not in our own strength and power but by
[2:04:48] the revelation of who we are a word sent
[2:04:52] from god i got a lot more it's god
[2:04:54] manifested in flesh now in the flesh of
[2:04:58] his bride for the bride and the husband
[2:05:01] is the same self
[2:05:07] do you know who i am
[2:05:09] i'm flesh of his flesh
[2:05:13] i'm born of his bone
[2:05:16] i am a living attribute
[2:05:19] of a living god
[2:05:21] i am a thought expressed i'm an
[2:05:22] attribute that has been expressed i am a
[2:05:25] word
[2:05:26] sent from god
[2:05:28] now this is powerful for us to get a
[2:05:30] hold of
[2:05:31] now
[2:05:32] uh i want to go to christ
[2:05:35] it's identified let me just make sure
[2:05:37] that i didn't use that one already
[2:05:38] because i i went back and pulled some
[2:05:44] i don't think i did did this one
[2:05:47] christ is identified the same in all
[2:05:49] generations are you still here
[2:05:52] thank you so much paragraph 71 he's
[2:05:54] eternal
[2:05:56] and he's the only source of eternal life
[2:05:59] there is
[2:06:00] it's in god our father he's eternal
[2:06:04] himself
[2:06:05] now therefore
[2:06:07] if
[2:06:08] we
[2:06:08] have eternal life
[2:06:12] i want to ask you how many of you in
[2:06:14] this room you're not ashamed to say that
[2:06:16] you believe that you have eternal life
[2:06:19] so now if you have
[2:06:22] eternal life we have part of god in us
[2:06:27] and god in us if you have eternal life
[2:06:31] the only eternal life is the life of god
[2:06:34] he's the only source
[2:06:38] brother branham tells us if it was
[2:06:40] created it has a beginning
[2:06:43] and it has an end
[2:06:46] only god being eternal and whoever he
[2:06:48] imparts his spirit to
[2:06:50] they are eternal
[2:06:52] unless god should impart his spirit he
[2:06:55] didn't feel that satan with the holy
[2:06:56] ghost
[2:06:59] lucifer didn't have the holy ghost
[2:07:02] lucifer is not eternal
[2:07:04] anybody with me
[2:07:07] the soul that sinneth is not eternal
[2:07:10] because it has not had the life of god
[2:07:12] imparted into it he said now therefore
[2:07:15] if we have eternal life we have part of
[2:07:17] god in us and god in us if he isn't then
[2:07:20] that's the only way you could have
[2:07:22] eternal life is to have god living
[2:07:24] inside of you he said it isn't something
[2:07:26] that was manufactured then given to you
[2:07:29] by some creed or you lived into it you
[2:07:32] grew into a better man or a better woman
[2:07:35] that seems to be the gospel of the
[2:07:37] church today
[2:07:38] just be the best uh uh best you you can
[2:07:41] be
[2:07:43] the best version of yourself
[2:07:45] well being the best version of myself
[2:07:48] could not produce what the word has
[2:07:50] produced in me
[2:07:51] the eternal life of god he said not not
[2:07:54] that you grew into a better man or a
[2:07:56] better woman it's god himself in you
[2:08:00] be careful where you take him
[2:08:02] be careful watch what you what you get
[2:08:04] him involved in
[2:08:06] he said just like you're a part of your
[2:08:08] father here on earth you're a part of
[2:08:11] your heavenly father can you see that
[2:08:14] and he said and what you are
[2:08:17] you're the attribute of his thoughts
[2:08:21] of you
[2:08:22] before
[2:08:24] the foundation of the world
[2:08:27] right now you are
[2:08:29] you are what he thought you would be
[2:08:34] somebody said oh god have mercy
[2:08:37] he thought i would be yeah
[2:08:40] he thought i would struggle like this
[2:08:41] yes he knew that
[2:08:43] he knew that
[2:08:44] but that's not all he knew about you
[2:08:47] i'll show you this in a minute i found
[2:08:48] some things here that really bless my
[2:08:50] blesser
[2:08:51] he said listen to this he said uh and
[2:08:54] what you are you're the attribute of his
[2:08:56] thoughts of you before the foundation of
[2:08:58] the world you're expressed
[2:09:01] he had to breed it in
[2:09:05] very interesting
[2:09:07] now that's just what i said to you last
[2:09:09] sunday your mom and your dad came
[2:09:11] together and they and they and they uh
[2:09:14] they certainly produced a part of who
[2:09:16] you are
[2:09:20] he had to breed it in but he was the one
[2:09:22] who chose
[2:09:24] where to put that spirit in everything
[2:09:26] he said to get
[2:09:27] what you are
[2:09:29] to make you
[2:09:31] what
[2:09:32] you
[2:09:33] are
[2:09:35] i appreciated someone writing me this
[2:09:36] week and saying i finally got it
[2:09:40] i finally got who i am in my family
[2:09:43] and why god placed me in the family he
[2:09:45] placed me in i now realize why i'm in
[2:09:48] the family that i was in that good
[2:09:50] when somebody can see that finally and
[2:09:53] then you quit questioning god why did
[2:09:55] you give me to this family why did you
[2:09:57] place me here when you knew things were
[2:09:59] going to be hard and harsh and awful and
[2:10:01] and life was not going to be good why
[2:10:03] did you you you just begin to realize he
[2:10:05] placed you there as a token
[2:10:08] he placed you there as a solitaire
[2:10:10] all right now let's go on future home
[2:10:12] i'm going to read now several quotations
[2:10:14] from the future home notice this is 64.
[2:10:19] he said if you've got eternal life
[2:10:21] there's only one form that's god
[2:10:24] and you are an expressed attribute i am
[2:10:28] a word sent from god
[2:10:30] so this is for the person who said to me
[2:10:32] some years ago
[2:10:34] when i preached i'm a word sin from god
[2:10:36] i'm uncomfortable with the fact that
[2:10:38] you're making me equal to a word of god
[2:10:41] or the word of god well here here is the
[2:10:44] answers for all of that you you were in
[2:10:47] the same mind
[2:10:49] that the healer was in
[2:10:51] and the savior and the deliverer all
[2:10:54] that god needed to express
[2:10:56] you were in that same mind you were a
[2:10:58] thought just like all the rest you were
[2:11:01] an attribute just like all the rest
[2:11:03] remember when brother branham is talking
[2:11:05] about the woman at the well uh uh
[2:11:08] or the woman caught in the act of
[2:11:10] adultery excuse me and corrected it
[2:11:13] when he is talking about the woman
[2:11:15] caught in the act of adultery he places
[2:11:18] her attributes below
[2:11:20] no he places her attributes above he
[2:11:23] places the attributes of the pharisees
[2:11:26] below
[2:11:28] dot not not nod he said he said thereof
[2:11:31] their father
[2:11:33] the devil didn't he but this little
[2:11:36] woman caught in the very act of adultery
[2:11:40] she was represented above
[2:11:46] caught
[2:11:47] in the act
[2:11:49] of adultery i'm getting that right arna
[2:11:52] it it was the woman caught an act of
[2:11:53] adultery not the woman at the well
[2:11:55] caught in the act of adultery
[2:11:58] and yet she had representation
[2:12:01] in the mind of god
[2:12:03] these religious fanatics their
[2:12:06] representation did not come from the
[2:12:08] mind of god it came from another father
[2:12:10] altogether
[2:12:13] interesting isn't it
[2:12:15] so even when you were out there in sin
[2:12:17] and even when you were doing things that
[2:12:19] you had no business doing
[2:12:22] you were still represented in the mind
[2:12:24] of god because that was where your
[2:12:25] origin was
[2:12:28] oh
[2:12:30] amazing grace how sweet to sound
[2:12:32] he said you're not going to uh uh you
[2:12:35] you are an expressed attitude if you're
[2:12:37] not you're not going to be there anyhow
[2:12:42] no man can come to me except my father
[2:12:44] has drawed him
[2:12:46] he only draws his own
[2:12:48] just telling what the word said see
[2:12:51] which passes away all these old things
[2:12:54] but these things don't so it speaks of
[2:12:58] eternity
[2:12:59] the holy ghost
[2:13:01] is eternal
[2:13:03] now now what look at the next sentence
[2:13:05] then
[2:13:06] you are in eternity
[2:13:09] where you was all the time
[2:13:11] but you've just recognized what happened
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:22] paragraph 238
[2:13:24] see
[2:13:26] you were made for an eternal purpose why
[2:13:29] were you born
[2:13:30] you were made for an eternal purpose
[2:13:33] to be a token of the world to express
[2:13:35] the spoken word of the father
[2:13:37] as a word sent from god are you
[2:13:39] following me
[2:13:41] that's who you are that's why you're
[2:13:42] here that's your why
[2:13:51] i don't have permission
[2:13:53] to share this
[2:14:00] so i'm not going to share it because
[2:14:02] you're watching
[2:14:04] i'm not going to share your name
[2:14:08] but i want you to i want you to listen
[2:14:10] to this young man somebody i love very
[2:14:13] much
[2:14:14] before genesis 1 1
[2:14:17] i was a thought in the mind of god
[2:14:20] his spirit covered the earth brooding
[2:14:22] over his precious seed
[2:14:24] nothing happened until he spoke it
[2:14:26] when the time came for his thought of me
[2:14:29] to become word he spoke my name
[2:14:32] hallelujah
[2:14:34] i gave my heart to the lord when i was
[2:14:36] younger at ohio youth camp and was
[2:14:38] baptized
[2:14:39] long story short with my father issues
[2:14:42] and things that happened in my family i
[2:14:44] turned to the world
[2:14:46] even when i was snorting cocaine even
[2:14:48] when i was drunk out of my mind even
[2:14:50] when i was with more women i could name
[2:14:52] he never left me brother shelly
[2:14:57] i felt him through all of it i hope i
[2:14:59] don't get in trouble for sharing this
[2:15:01] never at any time did he leave me or
[2:15:04] forsake me he was not happy with me
[2:15:06] but he was there with me
[2:15:09] he was a thought in my mind constantly
[2:15:12] pulling at me watching over me i know it
[2:15:15] because i felt him and i continued
[2:15:17] living a life for myself
[2:15:19] but
[2:15:20] one day i had enough
[2:15:23] he wasn't just the thought in my head
[2:15:25] anymore
[2:15:26] i spoke it
[2:15:28] and told him i didn't want that life
[2:15:30] anymore i wanted him
[2:15:34] if he dresses the lilies with beauty and
[2:15:36] splendor how much more does he love me
[2:15:39] he watches over me he watches over every
[2:15:42] sparrow how much more does he love me
[2:15:44] thank you for teaching scripture and all
[2:15:46] your hard work and dedication
[2:15:50] who would want to dance
[2:15:52] getting a testimony like that
[2:15:56] he got it
[2:15:58] he got it
[2:16:00] he got it see you were made for an
[2:16:03] eternal purpose because you was the
[2:16:05] manifestation of an attribute that was
[2:16:09] in god
[2:16:10] that thought of you and expressed you
[2:16:15] and he made earth
[2:16:20] see you thought the earth was the
[2:16:22] important part
[2:16:25] but the prophet said no you were.
[2:16:30] you remember the little clip we we made
[2:16:32] hawkmaid it's all about the bride
[2:16:35] you were
[2:16:37] he made an earth that he could take you
[2:16:40] out of
[2:16:42] and to make you a human being
[2:16:45] you had to have an expression
[2:16:47] you had to have a place to express
[2:16:49] yourself you had to play you had to have
[2:16:51] a place to come and show the world who
[2:16:53] you are
[2:16:54] a word sent from god so he created an
[2:16:56] earth and placed you in the earth
[2:16:59] you were the more valuable of the two
[2:17:02] the bible said so jesus tells us
[2:17:04] that a soul is more valuable
[2:17:07] 10 million worlds like the one we're
[2:17:09] living in right now laid at our feet and
[2:17:11] it could not buy a soul isn't that good
[2:17:15] and sin come along and perverted his way
[2:17:18] that was okay
[2:17:20] because god had that handle too
[2:17:23] if you believe that say amen
[2:17:25] all right where are we
[2:17:29] a little more you come anyhow but you
[2:17:31] was lost with the world
[2:17:34] so he come and redeemed you
[2:17:37] now here's who you are the expressed
[2:17:40] attribute
[2:17:41] and also redeems this earth
[2:17:45] by the same way i got to read that again
[2:17:49] you need to listen to this
[2:17:50] he said you come anyhow but you was lost
[2:17:53] with the world
[2:17:54] so he come and redeems you the expressed
[2:17:57] attribute and also redeems the earth by
[2:18:00] the same way then his purpose rolls on
[2:18:03] see oh hallelujah oh that does me so
[2:18:07] much good think of just what lays ahead
[2:18:09] if you can think about what lays ahead
[2:18:11] you ought to give god a praise
[2:18:14] the whole redemption
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:18] i want you to look at what messenger
[2:18:20] comes from the future home
[2:18:25] the future home
[2:18:28] paragraph 275 of the same message
[2:18:31] he said just like all the curse of sin
[2:18:34] is gone you got to hear this
[2:18:38] just like all the curse of sin is gone
[2:18:41] when the holy ghost accepts you see
[2:18:43] you don't accept it
[2:18:49] it accepts you remember what ephesians
[2:18:51] said
[2:18:52] you are accepted in the beloved
[2:18:56] all the curse of sin is gone when the
[2:18:58] holy ghost accepts you see you don't
[2:19:00] accept it it accepts you see because
[2:19:02] it's god's attribute
[2:19:05] see if it's the holy ghost it means
[2:19:08] god's spirit
[2:19:14] and it's the attribute
[2:19:16] the thought of god has accepted you
[2:19:20] because that you were ordained for that
[2:19:24] purpose
[2:19:25] remember the prophet said it was in him
[2:19:26] to be father it was in him to be son it
[2:19:28] was in him to be holy ghost attribute
[2:19:32] it was also in him to express himself
[2:19:36] as reed gabrielson
[2:19:38] west of greeley
[2:19:40] stephen shaw
[2:19:41] david yantis
[2:19:44] you sisters are not to be left out
[2:19:46] he said yet you was born in sin
[2:19:50] imagine that you were a living attribute
[2:19:51] of god sent forth into the earth word
[2:19:53] made flesh thought expressed
[2:19:56] and yet you were born in sin
[2:19:58] but god had that attribute and here you
[2:20:00] expressed yourself here on the earth and
[2:20:02] he comes down
[2:20:04] and gets you
[2:20:08] one day the holy spirit passes over the
[2:20:10] top of the water and says your mind your
[2:20:12] mind your mind your
[2:20:14] mind he starts claiming what belongs to
[2:20:17] him
[2:20:18] he's going to have his seed
[2:20:22] you hear me jesus christ is going to
[2:20:25] have his seed
[2:20:27] all that the father hath given him every
[2:20:29] one of them will come
[2:20:32] no man will be able to take them out of
[2:20:34] my hand
[2:20:35] why because they're his seed
[2:20:37] [Applause]
[2:20:39] the prophet of the old testament said he
[2:20:41] will see his seed
[2:20:44] and there he hung suspended between
[2:20:46] heaven and earth
[2:20:50] how was he able to endure the suffering
[2:20:51] of the cross because he saw his seed
[2:20:56] you
[2:20:58] wasn't nails that kept him there it was
[2:21:00] you
[2:21:01] he saw you
[2:21:03] and that's what kept him on the cross
[2:21:05] he knew me
[2:21:09] yet he
[2:21:10] loved me
[2:21:14] he
[2:21:15] whose glory makes the heaven shine
[2:21:22] so unworthy
[2:21:27] of such mercy
[2:21:32] yet when he
[2:21:34] was on the cross
[2:21:38] i
[2:21:39] was on his mind
[2:21:43] the look of love was on his face the
[2:21:48] thorns were on his head
[2:21:53] blood
[2:21:54] was on his scarlet robe
[2:21:58] was stained
[2:22:00] a crimson red
[2:22:03] and though
[2:22:05] his eyes were on the crowd that day
[2:22:09] he looked
[2:22:11] ahead in time
[2:22:15] for when he
[2:22:17] was on
[2:22:19] the cross
[2:22:22] was on his mind he saw his seed yet he
[2:22:28] knew me
[2:22:31] yet he
[2:22:34] loved me
[2:22:37] he
[2:22:39] whose
[2:22:40] glory makes
[2:22:42] the heaven shine
[2:22:47] so
[2:22:48] on worthy
[2:22:53] of such
[2:22:55] [Music]
[2:22:58] yet when he
[2:23:00] was on the cross
[2:23:04] ah
[2:23:14] 275
[2:23:16] just like all the curse of sin is gone
[2:23:19] when the holy ghost accepts you
[2:23:22] future home where we were
[2:23:24] see you don't accept it it accepts you
[2:23:28] see because it's god's attribute i'm at
[2:23:30] the beginning
[2:23:32] the thought of god has accepted you
[2:23:35] because that you were ordained for that
[2:23:39] purpose
[2:23:40] see
[2:23:41] in that powerful
[2:23:43] you
[2:23:44] yet you was born in sin there we are
[2:23:48] but god had that attribute
[2:23:52] and here you expressed yourself on earth
[2:23:55] and he comes down and gets you see you
[2:23:57] back here you're back here here is where
[2:24:01] you belong see
[2:24:03] sin has lost its power that's right

[2:30:18] god
[2:30:19] follow this
[2:30:20] you were only in his thinking
[2:30:24] watch this
[2:30:25] your very
[2:30:27] name
[2:30:29] if it
[2:30:31] ever was on the book of life it was put
[2:30:34] there before the foundation of the world
[2:30:37] he's talking about the lamb's book

[2:31:14] of the world he knew what you
[2:31:18] were
[2:31:19] let's go on
[2:31:21] i'm only saying that not to mix up
[2:31:23] doctrine
[2:31:25] but to straighten it out
[2:31:27] that we might get away from this fear
[2:31:29] and scare
[2:31:33] how many of you have sat through those
[2:31:34] scary altar calls
[2:31:38] anybody ever give them i have
[2:31:43] i beat on the wall i've ran over to the
[2:31:45] wall when i was a boy and beat on the
[2:31:46] wall
[2:31:47] and made it sound like those people and
[2:31:49] was in the flood beating on the ark to
[2:31:51] get in
[2:31:54] if we only knew if we only knew
[2:31:57] that none of that was really necessary
[2:32:03] fear won't bring you to grace

[2:32:10] are
[2:32:13] only god only god only love he'll tell
[2:32:16] you in a minute only love only him
[2:32:18] expressing himself as love can do that
[2:32:20] for you love can do way more than fear
[2:32:23] can accomplish if you believe that same
[2:32:25] man
[2:32:26] he said i i just want he said i'm not
[2:32:28] only saying this now i'm only saying
[2:32:31] this not to mix up doctrine but to
[2:32:32] straighten it out that we might get away
[2:32:34] from this fear and scare he said you
[2:32:36] don't know who you are
[2:32:39] you are not going to be
[2:32:42] but now you are the sons of god isn't
[2:32:46] that what the scripture said he said see
[2:32:48] you always were the sons of god see
[2:32:52] that doesn't mean there didn't need to
[2:32:54] be repentance in baptism in the name of
[2:32:55] jesus and the reef in the baptism of the
[2:32:57] holy ghost he's not saying any of those
[2:32:59] things he's saying all of these things
[2:33:00] are made available to you because god
[2:33:02] saw you in the beginning
[2:33:04] all right are we still together
[2:33:07] all right then the next paragraph
[2:33:09] paragraph 46
[2:33:11] he said
[2:33:14] same same message the god who was rich
[2:33:16] in mercy did we miss one
[2:33:18] all right paragraph 46 was there also
[2:33:22] let me read it to you we don't have it
[2:33:23] but let me read it to you for when god
[2:33:26] had you in his thinking at the beginning
[2:33:31] you have to be some part of you your
[2:33:34] life that's in you now
[2:33:37] had to be with god
[2:33:40] before there
[2:33:42] he said well when when before he even
[2:33:45] become material here on earth that's god
[2:33:49] before god became material here on earth
[2:33:51] before there was anything but god
[2:33:54] before there was anything but god you
[2:33:57] were one of his attributes
[2:34:00] listen to this he knowed what your name
[2:34:03] would be
[2:34:04] he knowed the color of your hair you
[2:34:06] would have
[2:34:12] he knowed all about you
[2:34:15] how could he do that because he'd
[2:34:16] already thought about you
[2:34:18] you're exactly what he thought you to be
[2:34:20] now in the message lean not unto thine
[2:34:22] own understanding
[2:34:24] do you have that paragraph 17
[2:34:26] should be the next one in line
[2:34:30] lean not under thine owner's
[2:34:32] understanding that's it he said so you
[2:34:33] see
[2:34:35] if you were in the foreknowledge of god
[2:34:37] then you are becoming a part of god
[2:34:40] and the only way you can be a son of god
[2:34:42] or a daughter of god you had to be a
[2:34:44] part of god
[2:34:45] and god isn't complete
[2:34:54] he's gathering all of his thoughts back
[2:34:55] together
[2:35:00] and god isn't complete without you
[2:35:04] powerful
[2:35:06] has to be
[2:35:08] that's right because there is one
[2:35:11] only one resource of eternal life and
[2:35:13] that is god and him alone has eternal
[2:35:15] life see now and you were a part of him
[2:35:18] in so much that you're an attribute or
[2:35:20] in his thinking in the beginning
[2:35:23] it and listen that
[2:35:26] it gives that little tug
[2:35:30] towards him
[2:35:33] that's what has to be quickened
[2:35:38] some of them will never be quick and
[2:35:39] they just don't have it that's all
[2:35:42] you see only an attribute an expression
[2:35:44] of god in the earth are you with me
[2:35:47] only an expression of god in the earth a
[2:35:50] thought or an attribute expressed in the
[2:35:52] earth has that god tug
[2:35:56] and that's what the quickening spirit
[2:35:57] falls on it's the gene it's the gene
[2:36:00] it's the gene of the seed it's the gene
[2:36:02] seed life of god
[2:36:04] and the anointing and the quickening
[2:36:05] power falls on that and you start
[2:36:07] feeling the tug here was a young man who
[2:36:10] said he was with me i could feel him i
[2:36:13] knew he was there even just a thought in
[2:36:16] my mind but i knew he was there all the
[2:36:19] time
[2:36:21] what a revelation
[2:36:23] everybody doesn't have that
[2:36:26] now in the message the easter seal
[2:36:32] i would love to get all these in but i
[2:36:34] won't because i just won't
[2:36:38] paragraph 59
[2:36:41] he said there's only one life one
[2:36:42] eternal spirit one eternal life and
[2:36:45] that's god god alone is the eternal and
[2:36:48] then we being his children are part of
[2:36:50] him that is the attributes of his
[2:36:52] thinking and the thought
[2:36:54] is expressed and becomes
[2:36:58] there you are
[2:37:00] there's your quote
[2:37:01] i need a quote where brother branham
[2:37:03] said i'm a word sent from god there it
[2:37:04] is
[2:37:05] go back
[2:37:10] and then we being his children are part
[2:37:12] of him that is the attributes of his
[2:37:14] thinking and the thought is expressed
[2:37:16] and becomes a word
[2:37:18] not just anybody's word
[2:37:21] god's mind god's thought god's
[2:37:24] attributes god's word
[2:37:26] all right let's go on
[2:37:28] then each individual is here that
[2:37:30] possesses this eternal life was before
[2:37:33] the foundation of the world in god's
[2:37:34] thinking it's the only way it could be
[2:37:36] because you're an attribute that's an
[2:37:38] expression of a thought has become a
[2:37:40] word and a word has taken life
[2:37:42] hallelujah
[2:37:43] a word has taken life
[2:37:46] and what did he say about it it's
[2:37:48] eternal
[2:37:49] it's eternal
[2:37:51] all right let's go on
[2:37:52] that's the reason we have eternal life
[2:37:54] in the same principle that the great son
[2:37:56] of god the redeemer we become sons and
[2:37:59] daughters of god through that same
[2:38:02] spirit by the same foreknowledge of god
[2:38:07] are you still here
[2:38:08] and give me just a minute let me find
[2:38:10] something to mark
[2:38:24] i'm gonna read one more
[2:38:27] maybe two
[2:38:30] could be three
[2:38:33] this is a good one
[2:38:36] are any of them not good no not really
[2:38:39] i want you to notice that most of these
[2:38:41] that have come in here are 64-65
[2:38:44] that's simply because i started with the
[2:38:45] last sermon that this appeared in and
[2:38:47] went backwards
[2:38:49] that don't mean he didn't say it all
[2:38:51] through he said it all through
[2:38:55] but as his understanding and revelation
[2:38:57] expanded we often see that taking place
[2:39:02] in those last years after the seals were
[2:39:04] loosed he said the bible became a new
[2:39:05] book
[2:39:07] and and very little doctrinally changed
[2:39:09] but there were some things definitely
[2:39:11] expanded after the full revelation came
[2:39:14] i want to take you to a message called
[2:39:15] the power of transformation
[2:39:18] prescott arizona
[2:39:21] october 31st
[2:39:23] 1965.
[2:39:25] i want to go to paragraph 293.
[2:39:38] if you are a christian now
[2:39:41] a genuine
[2:39:43] predestinated seed
[2:39:46] you was in god
[2:39:49] you always was in god
[2:39:53] the germ of your life
[2:39:56] which is an attribute of god
[2:40:01] which was his thought
[2:40:04] now he's going to give you an example
[2:40:06] that i find
[2:40:07] very
[2:40:08] very helpful
[2:40:10] in the next paragraph so let's go on
[2:40:13] watch this carefully if you're a little
[2:40:15] bit confused or not quite settled i want
[2:40:18] you to hear how it works this is this
[2:40:20] was precious he did this twice that i
[2:40:22] know of could be many more times but two
[2:40:24] times i found something very similar to
[2:40:26] this
[2:40:27] now stay with me you're ahead of me
[2:40:28] don't read ahead of me stay where i am
[2:40:31] say for instance
[2:40:33] this pretty little lady sitting here see
[2:40:36] god said
[2:40:38] in the day
[2:40:40] there will be a girl
[2:40:41] her name will be so-and-so
[2:40:44] she will be this
[2:40:45] thus and this
[2:40:50] stop period look at me
[2:40:53] she'll be that tall
[2:40:55] of a medium build
[2:40:57] red hair
[2:41:00] we don't know
[2:41:01] she will be this thus and this
[2:41:05] and even
[2:41:06] and even no to this very hour
[2:41:11] she would sit and listen at this message
[2:41:15] dressed in a red dress
[2:41:18] is that getting any clearer for you
[2:41:22] some people think this is just broad you
[2:41:24] know god knew me
[2:41:26] this is pretty specific
[2:41:29] he knew where she was coming he knew
[2:41:30] what her name would be knew what color
[2:41:32] hair she would have knew all there was
[2:41:33] to know about her he said earlier now he
[2:41:35] knows she's going to be sitting here
[2:41:37] today listening to this sermon he said
[2:41:39] and wearing a red dress
[2:41:43] that's pretty specific isn't it see that
[2:41:45] was his thought
[2:41:49] so in eternity pass she was sitting in a
[2:41:52] service in a red dress
[2:41:56] certain color hair certain build
[2:41:59] certain personality and disposition
[2:42:04] in the mind of god before the foundation
[2:42:06] of the world
[2:42:08] he goes on whoever your husband is
[2:42:14] and whoever he is and he would bring
[2:42:16] this together god
[2:42:20] so before the foundation of the world
[2:42:22] what business do you have choosing your
[2:42:24] own companion
[2:42:29] what business does anybody have choosing
[2:42:31] their own mate in life
[2:42:33] and then expecting god to make the best
[2:42:35] of it
[2:42:38] why don't you wait on the lord
[2:42:43] and don't bring me no uh i know it's god
[2:42:46] because he hasn't stopped me
[2:42:53] or i know it's god because he hadn't
[2:42:55] told me it wasn't
[2:42:58] this is look you're a living attribute
[2:43:00] of god you don't have to be led by by by
[2:43:03] uh what do you call that deductive
[2:43:05] reasoning you don't have to be led by
[2:43:08] by uh what do they call it when you take
[2:43:10] out your options
[2:43:13] process of elimination thank you
[2:43:16] you don't have to know god's mind by
[2:43:18] process of elimination
[2:43:20] you're a living attribute of god you can
[2:43:22] wait for more than that you can come
[2:43:23] before the presence of the lord and ask
[2:43:25] him his will and expect him to show you
[2:43:27] his will is that right if he knew in
[2:43:30] eternity pass it a woman to be sitting
[2:43:31] here this morning to hear the word in a
[2:43:33] red dress with certain building i
[2:43:34] already knew who her husband was
[2:43:41] he already had a plan
[2:43:43] and he would bring this together and you
[2:43:44] would sit here this in this city
[2:43:48] at this day
[2:43:50] there could be no way for you to fail it
[2:43:58] because you're growing
[2:44:01] let's redone
[2:44:06] let's go on
[2:44:12] and as long as your seed inside growing
[2:44:16] you have to produce just exactly what
[2:44:20] the seed said you would do
[2:44:28] unbelief
[2:44:29] will pull you out of god's predestinated
[2:44:32] plan for your life
[2:44:34] and either plunge you in your own
[2:44:35] rebellion or in the permissive will of
[2:44:38] god which brings different results the
[2:44:40] permissive will of god will bring
[2:44:42] different results in your life than the
[2:44:44] perfect will of god and yes brother
[2:44:46] branham taught both
[2:44:49] god has a perfect plan one he saw before
[2:44:52] the foundation of the world does he
[2:44:54] always force you to do it if you read
[2:44:56] this quote you might come away with an
[2:44:58] idea that god will force you but i'm
[2:45:00] telling you he does not force us
[2:45:04] but what he will do sometime is let us
[2:45:07] find ourselves out there
[2:45:10] and i have quotes for that too
[2:45:12] and he woos and pulls and draws us right
[2:45:15] back to his plan now here's the key in
[2:45:18] this quote as long as your seed inside
[2:45:20] growing
[2:45:24] you take yourself out from under the
[2:45:25] living word you'll stop growing you get
[2:45:27] yourself out from under the anointing of
[2:45:29] the holy spirit in the presence of jesus
[2:45:31] christ and you quit growing
[2:45:34] and you'll start making your own dumb
[2:45:35] choices say amen
[2:45:38] but as long as you sit under the
[2:45:40] anointed word and you come into the
[2:45:42] presence of god on a regular basis
[2:45:44] praising him and worshiping him and
[2:45:46] creating an atmosphere for him to gently
[2:45:49] lead you along
[2:45:51] you'll never step away from his plan
[2:45:54] it's his word he keeps his word he
[2:45:56] watches over it just like he did in the
[2:45:58] beginning see
[2:45:59] he said you was in your father as a germ
[2:46:03] and you come forth as a daughter you you
[2:46:05] every one of you brothers and sisters
[2:46:07] you come forth if you wasn't in your
[2:46:09] father then you wouldn't have been here
[2:46:12] we understand this by the seed don't we
[2:46:15] and if you wasn't in god
[2:46:18] if you believe the message of the bible
[2:46:21] and the present message of the day
[2:46:24] a vindication of it the reason you are
[2:46:27] sitting here listen now listen listen
[2:46:30] now
[2:46:31] the reason you are sitting here because
[2:46:34] you were predestinated
[2:46:36] to sit here
[2:46:40] now you come along and tell me you
[2:46:42] denominational nut case you come along
[2:46:45] and tell me god don't care where you go
[2:46:46] church
[2:46:51] that's the same way they say god don't
[2:46:53] care how you baptize as long as you
[2:46:54] believe in him
[2:46:57] no sir you don't understand
[2:46:59] you don't understand it all he already
[2:47:01] has a plan for our life
[2:47:03] and it doesn't include just happenstance
[2:47:07] it's not luck that we're living by it's
[2:47:10] a divine program of god
[2:47:13] and he said you're sitting here because
[2:47:15] you were predestinated to sit here you
[2:47:17] wouldn't have been here otherwise
[2:47:20] listen to what brother branham's saying
[2:47:21] not only about the woman in the red
[2:47:23] dress but all of us
[2:47:26] he said you wouldn't have been here
[2:47:27] otherwise you'd have been on the street
[2:47:28] maybe drunk some of you
[2:47:32] i know nobody in this church is going to
[2:47:34] rise up with some self-righteousness and
[2:47:36] say i can assure you i wouldn't be you
[2:47:38] have no idea
[2:47:40] i have no idea where i'd be
[2:47:43] i know what i think i would choose i
[2:47:45] know what i think i would reject but the
[2:47:47] truth of the matter is i don't know what
[2:47:50] i where i would be or what shape i would
[2:47:53] be in had it not been for finding a
[2:47:55] grace to yield to the predestinated plan
[2:47:58] of god for my life come on come on come
[2:48:00] on come on i'm like some of you i
[2:48:02] wouldn't be living in alabama that's for
[2:48:04] sure
[2:48:08] and some of you out here running around
[2:48:10] with some other man's wife
[2:48:12] and you women out married running around
[2:48:14] with some other woman's husband or
[2:48:16] something like that see
[2:48:18] but you were predestinated to be here
[2:48:21] listen to this see
[2:48:23] you can't help it
[2:48:34] your family comes to see why do you
[2:48:36] always have to go to church you just
[2:48:37] leave me here said you always have to go
[2:48:39] to church why do you always have to go
[2:48:40] to church why are you always listening
[2:48:41] to preaching
[2:48:43] i can't help it
[2:48:47] can't help it
[2:48:49] i have a father
[2:48:52] i have a father
[2:48:54] he is god
[2:48:55] you were a seed anybody there
[2:48:59] he's still preaching
[2:49:00] and when he come to a place he's got you
[2:49:02] now
[2:49:03] to where you was in him then as a
[2:49:06] thought here it is
[2:49:09] this is it
[2:49:10] why did you have to be transferred
[2:49:14] from the mind of god as a thought
[2:49:16] attribute
[2:49:17] to a body of flesh and placed on an
[2:49:19] earth he built an earth for you to live
[2:49:20] on by the way we we found that just a
[2:49:22] moment ago you're reading ahead
[2:49:27] you're reading ahead
[2:49:30] when i already heard him rejoicing me
[2:49:33] too
[2:49:34] now you are a person
[2:49:37] that can do
[2:49:38] what say it together fellowship
[2:49:44] he wanted you to be more than a thought
[2:49:46] in his head
[2:49:49] he wanted you to be more than a word
[2:49:51] coming out of his mouth
[2:49:53] he wanted you to have a physical form
[2:49:57] and god almighty
[2:50:00] wanted to have fellowship
[2:50:07] with you
[2:50:09] with you see like you was in your
[2:50:12] father's at the beginning but now uh you
[2:50:15] are sons and daughters
[2:50:19] let's read on
[2:50:21] so you can have fellowship with your
[2:50:22] parent
[2:50:23] now we're sons and daughters of god who
[2:50:26] can fellowship with our father god see
[2:50:28] it's just as beautiful
[2:50:32] aren't you thankful
[2:50:34] don't you like that
[2:50:37] then you become like him
[2:50:40] and if we were sons
[2:50:42] then your attributes
[2:50:44] and was in his form at the
[2:50:48] beginning
[2:50:50] and remember
[2:50:52] if you was in him at the beginning and
[2:50:54] when jesus which is god the word made
[2:50:57] flesh and dwelt among us then you were
[2:50:59] in him and stood the insults that he
[2:51:02] took listen
[2:51:06] you went to calvary with him
[2:51:09] in him
[2:51:11] you died in him
[2:51:14] you arose
[2:51:18] and now you are seated together in the
[2:51:21] heavenly places where
[2:51:23] in
[2:51:24] him
[2:51:58] two more
[2:52:02] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[2:52:11] 172 did we read that
[2:52:14] in the other batch
[2:52:17] we did have one from that sermon didn't
[2:52:18] we
[2:52:21] is that the same one
[2:52:25] all right no that was 118 this is 172.
[2:52:28] all right let's read it 172. are you
[2:52:30] still with me
[2:52:31] i know you're tired
[2:52:34] i am
[2:52:36] but the real ordained of god
[2:52:40] that real gene that real germ
[2:52:43] [Music]
[2:52:45] a soul of god that was in god before the
[2:52:50] foundation of the world remember you
[2:52:52] that's really got the spirit of god in
[2:52:54] you tonight
[2:52:56] you were here in christ because he was
[2:53:00] the fullness of the word he was the
[2:53:03] fullness of the godhead bodily you
[2:53:06] remember all that the father was
[2:53:09] he poured into the sun
[2:53:11] let's go on
[2:53:13] god was in christ reconciling the world
[2:53:16] to himself do you believe that
[2:53:19] he said look he was in christ then if
[2:53:21] you were in god a gene a word an
[2:53:24] attribute from the beginning
[2:53:27] then you walked with him here on earth
[2:53:30] anybody listening
[2:53:32] you talked with him on earth
[2:53:34] you suffered with him on earth
[2:53:37] you died with him at calvary

[2:56:31] so shall my word be
[2:56:35] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[2:56:39] of my mouth
[2:56:43] it was in him to be a healer is he a
[2:56:45] healer
[2:56:47] in him to be a deliverer have you found
[2:56:49] him to be a deliverer a savior
[2:56:53] a counselor
[2:56:56] then why would we believe that any of
[2:56:59] his thoughts
[2:57:01] will not accomplish everything
[2:57:05] that he saw them
[2:57:06] accomplishing he said so shall my word
[2:57:10] be that goeth out of my mouth it didn't
[2:57:12] start in his mouth it started in his
[2:57:15] mind
[2:57:16] as a thought and an attribute his mouth
[2:57:19] brought it into creation
[2:57:21] it shall
[2:57:22] not return unto me void
[2:57:26] but it shall accomplish that which i
[2:57:30] please ephesians
[2:57:32] according to his pleasure
[2:57:34] and it shall prosper in the thing
[2:57:41] 2022
[2:57:44] where to
[2:57:45] i sent it
[2:57:47] i'm telling you that's one of the most
[2:57:48] powerful verses in the old testament
[2:57:51] in this context
[2:57:53] now i want to read that quote
[2:57:56] questions and answers number one
[2:57:59] 1964 paragraph 152 let me
[2:58:02] let me
[2:58:03] rush and read it before you can when
[2:58:05] jesus suffered in that body
[2:58:08] he suffered
[2:58:10] because a man and a woman
[2:58:12] are one person
[2:58:14] stay with me
[2:58:16] eve was taken out of adam
[2:58:20] and the church what happened
[2:58:22] god opened up the side of adam
[2:58:27] now brother branham was a man
[2:58:30] and he could make mistakes
[2:58:33] because all men could make mistakes
[2:58:36] if that makes you nervous it shouldn't
[2:58:39] because he told us to keep our balance
[2:58:41] he told brother the green over and over
[2:58:43] again whatever you do brother keep your
[2:58:45] balance in the scriptures
[2:58:47] and you'll never be able to balance the
[2:58:49] quotes
[2:58:50] if you can't lay them in the scriptures
[2:58:53] and one time brother brandon makes a
[2:58:55] statement that a woman
[2:58:57] that a man has a one less rib
[2:59:01] than a woman
[2:59:03] that is not the case
[2:59:07] i just want you to know that
[2:59:09] it doesn't change who he was or what he
[2:59:12] was
[2:59:12] or the ministry that god gave him
[2:59:16] it just means that he had a thought
[2:59:24] you all see the water coming down
[2:59:28] i'm assuming it's dripping out of there
[2:59:35] see the wet spots
[2:59:45] i almost forgot what i was doing
[2:59:50] god opened up the side of adam and took
[2:59:52] out of there a help meet
[2:59:55] a helpmate the bride
[3:00:02] and god opened up the sight of jesus at
[3:00:04] calvary
[3:00:09] and took out the bride
[3:00:13] you remember standing me standing here
[3:00:16] on a
[3:00:17] flatbed trailer
[3:00:20] in a parking lot of gravel
[3:00:23] right here
[3:00:26] and preaching
[3:00:28] for the first time
[3:00:31] at christ
[3:00:33] the bride was taken out of christ
[3:00:36] through a narrow way
[3:00:38] and that the bride would enter in
[3:00:41] to christ he would come back into christ
[3:00:44] through a narrow way
[3:00:46] it was a spear
[3:00:48] thrust in his side that separated the
[3:00:50] bride from christ and it would be a
[3:00:53] narrow place
[3:00:55] we wouldn't come a broad way we would
[3:00:57] come a narrow way to get back to where
[3:00:59] we came from but god would get us there
[3:01:02] and he is
[3:01:03] he's getting us there
[3:01:05] and god opened up the sight of jesus at
[3:01:07] calvary and took out the bride and when
[3:01:09] jesus died at calvary remember
[3:01:12] the bride was not taken from the body
[3:01:15] until the body was dead
[3:01:21] why because you had to die in him
[3:01:26] because his death
[3:01:28] is your death
[3:01:32] do you remember what a struggle we had
[3:01:34] in this church for over a year
[3:01:37] when i was preaching that
[3:01:41] and everybody was on the struggle bus
[3:01:46] maybe not everybody but a lot of folks
[3:01:48] and it would be so hard to break through
[3:01:50] those scriptures and so hard to break
[3:01:53] through those truths
[3:01:55] because we find it so difficult to
[3:01:58] believe
[3:02:00] that his death was our death
[3:02:04] but here brother branham explains to us
[3:02:08] the bride was not separated from the
[3:02:11] body
[3:02:13] until
[3:02:14] now i know that i know some children are
[3:02:17] loud don't even let that bother you it
[3:02:19] don't bother me it's not bothering me
[3:02:21] don't let that bother you
[3:02:23] i know some of you are worried
[3:02:24] especially if you think it's one of
[3:02:26] yours don't don't worry about it
[3:02:28] it's all right
[3:02:30] they're just expressing who they are
[3:02:33] children
[3:02:35] we get you under the anointing and you
[3:02:36] scream and carry on like that too
[3:02:38] expressing who you are so right now that
[3:02:40] is not bothering me but you're bothering
[3:02:42] me because you're worried about it
[3:02:44] don't worry about it it's all right
[3:02:47] remember the bride was not taken from
[3:02:49] the body until the body was dead he had
[3:02:52] already died
[3:02:54] and they was going to break his legs
[3:02:58] and the prophet said there'll not be one
[3:03:00] bone broken
[3:03:03] let's go on
[3:03:05] so they done drawed back the hammer to
[3:03:07] break a leg
[3:03:09] and a man went up with a spear and
[3:03:11] pushed it through his side brother
[3:03:13] branham said through his heart and the
[3:03:16] reason for that is because the
[3:03:18] explanation of blood and water comes
[3:03:20] from an exploded heart
[3:03:22] but the reality is the spear would have
[3:03:24] never had to go through his heart
[3:03:26] perhaps it did just like he said but
[3:03:28] because if the heart explodes then that
[3:03:31] that sack that pericardium
[3:03:34] where the blood is where the fluid is
[3:03:36] that protects the heart
[3:03:38] that's like water it's not blood it's
[3:03:40] like water
[3:03:42] and you don't ever know you got one
[3:03:43] until something goes wrong with it
[3:03:46] but i want you to know it's some of the
[3:03:48] worst pain i ever had in my life was
[3:03:50] pericarditis
[3:03:52] when an infection in my body turned into
[3:03:55] an
[3:03:56] inflammation and infection of the sac
[3:03:58] that the heart is in and i'm telling you
[3:04:00] that was pain
[3:04:03] and that that heart was under such a
[3:04:06] load that it exploded and when it did it
[3:04:09] burst the pericardium and the blood that
[3:04:11] was pumping through the heart and the
[3:04:14] water the sack of water in the sack of
[3:04:16] protection of the heart it exploded and
[3:04:19] and regardless of whether that went
[3:04:20] right through his heart or if it went
[3:04:21] through his side as we read
[3:04:24] then it wouldn't matter because that
[3:04:26] both blood and water came
[3:04:29] running out that spearhole
[3:04:32] he said and water and blood come forth
[3:04:35] he was already dead
[3:04:38] already dead
[3:04:41] there are so many places where brother
[3:04:43] adam talks about the bride being the
[3:04:45] water that came out of his heart
[3:04:47] he said she was already redeemed in the
[3:04:50] body by his death
[3:04:54] so for those of you who want to go
[3:04:56] through the tribulation so bad
[3:04:58] be my guest
[3:05:00] but here's what the word said so there's
[3:05:03] no more suffering tribulation period for
[3:05:06] the bride
[3:05:08] why because she died in him
[3:05:11] she paid the price in him
[3:05:14] she proved her love in him
[3:05:17] he said see
[3:05:18] she does what
[3:05:21] she goes in
[3:05:24] i want you to give god a handclap of
[3:05:26] praise
[3:05:26] [Applause]
[3:05:31] hallelujah
[3:05:35] hallelujah
[3:05:39] [Applause]
[3:05:40] i am a word
[3:05:43] sent from god
[3:05:46] a thought an attribute expressed
[3:05:50] are you with me
[3:05:52] let's stand together
[3:05:54] oh
[3:05:55] hallelujah

[3:05:59] find it necessary
[3:06:01] it thank you thank you it's him it's
[3:06:03] that wasn't me it's his word
[3:06:06] it's life-giving
[3:06:10] i don't know how in the world
[3:06:12] people are so satisfied
[3:06:14] with everything else
[3:06:16] but they cannot
[3:06:18] feast
[3:06:20] on his word
[3:06:24] see you you have to be a part of that
[3:06:27] word to fully understand
[3:06:29] what happens when that word comes forth
[3:06:30] like that
[3:06:32] it's your story being told
[3:06:34] and you start identifying with that if i
[3:06:36] would have went on in that message
[3:06:39] it's where he starts talking about paul
[3:06:40] revere and it's where he starts saying i
[3:06:42] rode with general washington and i rode
[3:06:44] with paul revere and i was i'm
[3:06:46] identified in her strengths and i'm
[3:06:48] identified with this nation in her
[3:06:50] weaknesses because i'm in her i was in
[3:06:52] her i'm a part of that and he starts
[3:06:55] contrasting that with who we are in the
[3:06:56] bride i'm telling you it's wonderful to
[3:06:58] know these things
[3:07:00] it's wonderful to know that i don't know
