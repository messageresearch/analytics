[50:56] [Music]
[50:58] to be a part of us
[51:00] God bless you
[51:03] can we say Amen
[51:05] praise God I greet each and everyone in
[51:07] the Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ what
[51:09] an honor and privilege to be here in the
[51:12] house of the Lord I also bring special
[51:14] greetings from South Africa from the
[51:16] bride that side to all of you here it's
[51:19] so wonderful to be in the presence of
[51:20] the Lord is that right
[51:23] there was nobody and nothing to worship
[51:26] him he wanted to be God in the beginning
[51:28] he desired to be God but there was no
[51:32] hands no voices no feet to dance and
[51:36] then he created us to make him God Amen
[51:39] and we're not ashamed to make him God
[51:41] tonight he said right
[51:43] I'm not ashamed to shout and jump and
[51:46] dance to make him God I can tell you
[51:49] Christ is not unwelcoming this church
[51:51] he's welcome here we can feel him the
[51:55] person of the Holy Ghost amen I was just
[51:57] reading a scripture there in Greek in
[52:00] Hebrew it means praise it means also to
[52:03] brag on God Amen to break on the Lord
[52:06] and I was just thinking you know if you
[52:07] don't praise God you're not breaking on
[52:09] your God but amen if you know that he's
[52:12] a Healer a redeemer a savior I mean you
[52:15] will praise him you will bragged that
[52:17] he's a Healer how many can break tonight
[52:20] that our God is a deliverer he's a
[52:23] Healer and a redeemer oh blessed be the
[52:25] name of the Lord Brahman says this
[52:27] message is already inspired he says but
[52:30] you need to be inspired and when an
[52:32] inspired man picks up the inspired word
[52:35] there will be results I feel this camp
[52:38] meeting is inspired by God and we know
[52:40] this message of the hour is already
[52:42] inspired and our God is not dead but he
[52:45] is alive amen and we hear Amen to
[52:48] worship him and to honor him I always
[52:50] tell the church guarded to make up his
[52:52] mind when he how he's going to come down
[52:54] from Heaven to Earth and he had to make
[52:56] up his mind he had to decide how will I
[52:58] come down and you know God made and
[53:00] problem says he's the same yesterday
[53:01] today and forever when he did it like
[53:04] this the first time you should do it
[53:05] like that the second time the third time
[53:07] and all the time he said right amen so
[53:10] he made up his mind he will come through
[53:11] the tribe of Judah and Judah means
[53:14] praise he came through praise brother
[53:17] when you don't feel the Lord you just
[53:18] stop praising him wherever you are
[53:20] whatever area in your life if you don't
[53:23] feel the Lord you just start praising
[53:25] him and I'm telling you he's bound to
[53:27] come down amen because he comes through
[53:30] our praises
[53:32] is that right
[53:33] praise the name of the Lord he's born
[53:35] out of the tribe of Judah and the symbol
[53:37] for Judah is a lion so when you praise
[53:40] God there must be a raw in your worship
[53:43] amen the devil must hear the lion
[53:45] roaring you can't worship like a mouse
[53:47] softly amen because your Praises should
[53:51] sound like a lion and when the enemy
[53:53] hears them in your aim and there's a
[53:55] Roar and you Hallelujah there's a law
[53:57] then God knows that's a true worship is
[54:00] that right amen praise the name of the
[54:02] Lord so we're just excited amen I'm
[54:04] overwhelmed I don't be here too long
[54:05] amen I'm just over excited you know 2020
[54:09] when the pandemic came it was so
[54:11] significant and so prophetic because 20
[54:13] if you multiply 21 20 it gives you 400
[54:16] and God in Genesis 15 he said after 400
[54:19] years I'll take my people out on The
[54:22] Exodus is that wonderful amen after 400
[54:25] years and on 2020 the pandemic came it
[54:28] was so prophetic problem says God keep
[54:30] on repeating amen hallelujah he's a god
[54:33] added repeat his prophecies he's not
[54:35] just the god of History he repeats his
[54:37] history amen and after 400 years yeah
[54:40] amen came God to get Israel out of the
[54:43] Exodus and it happened after 400 years
[54:46] and how did it happen with the pandemics
[54:48] in year 2020 you can see the when you
[54:51] counted together you get the year 400
[54:53] you get the number 400 and that means
[54:55] amen the 2020 when that happened amen it
[54:58] was significant because it shows us The
[55:01] Exodus for the bride is on Amen and God
[55:04] told Moses he told Moses this he said
[55:05] Moses I'm going to take my people out
[55:07] I'm going to do wonders but when I
[55:10] studied that word wonders I couldn't
[55:12] understand how God can say I'll take my
[55:14] people out with wonders but when the
[55:17] Wonders came it was actually pandemics
[55:19] it was plagued behind plague plague
[55:22] after plague but how can God says he's
[55:24] going to take them outward wonders you
[55:26] see to the Egyptians it was plagues but
[55:29] to his people it was wonders
[55:32] can somebody shout and say Amen
[55:35] oh brother to the world the pandemic was
[55:38] chaos but for us it was Supernatural
[55:41] wonders because God came on the scene to
[55:43] service the same yesterday today and
[55:46] forever and I'm so excited I told the
[55:48] people amen after 400 years but the
[55:50] redeemed time was exactly
[55:53] 430 years
[55:55] so The Exodus took place after
[55:58] 430 years and Moses he told Abram for
[56:01] after 400 years but in the book of
[56:03] Exodus and the physicals you can read it
[56:06] was after 430 years and what God did in
[56:09] the first Exodus you can study all the
[56:11] Exodus Brahman says it's the same what
[56:14] happened in the first accidents will
[56:15] happen in a second Exodus will happen in
[56:17] the Third Exodus God sent him a prophet
[56:19] in the first Exodus in the second Exodus
[56:21] Jesus was the prophet and in our Exodus
[56:23] God sent William Branham it's our
[56:25] Prophet but I want to show you something
[56:27] there just quickly pass if I can 450
[56:30] years and it's amazing after the Book of
[56:32] Malachi for 400 years there were no
[56:35] Visions no dreams there was no
[56:37] prophecies it was quiet they call it the
[56:40] silent God for 400 years
[56:43] oh but then the angel Gabriel came
[56:46] amen what the prophecy
[56:48] that the Redeemer will be born but Jesus
[56:51] only functioned after 30 years so if you
[56:55] look into that amen you get the year 430
[56:58] again
[56:59] after Malachi to the Book of Matthew 400
[57:02] years of Silence but the angel said that
[57:05] the Messiah will be born and after 30
[57:07] years he stepped into his levitical hood
[57:09] exactly 430 years again and I tell the
[57:14] people can it be in this Exodus that
[57:16] 2020 is to you you can count at 400
[57:19] prophetically but if you look at 2020
[57:21] it's like a countdown to 2030 then you
[57:25] get the number again 430 I'm not making
[57:27] dates we don't know the day and the hour
[57:29] but I just want to pinch you Ramen says
[57:32] pinch yourself the coming of the Lord is
[57:34] close he said there's still great things
[57:36] happening now they said it's running out
[57:38] of time and it's the coming of the Lord
[57:40] and I'm telling you brother he's closer
[57:42] then close can ever be the Lord is
[57:44] coming and may God bless you
[57:48] publishers
[57:51] Hallelujah
[57:52] [Music]
[57:52] [Applause]
[57:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[57:59] [Applause]

[1:04:53] I've got a I've got to move along this
[1:04:55] evening I hope you'll keep up with me
[1:04:57] I received an inspiration in the service
[1:05:00] last night
[1:05:01] when brother Greely was preaching about
[1:05:04] uh many wonderful beautiful things
[1:05:09] but he mentioned just briefly the eyes
[1:05:11] of the Lord
[1:05:13] and it stirred my heart and God began to
[1:05:16] talk to me today about the eyes of the
[1:05:18] Bride I want to talk about your eyes
[1:05:21] tonight Song of Solomon or Song of Songs
[1:05:25] as I like to call it because that's what
[1:05:28] Solomon called it under the inspiration
[1:05:31] of the Holy Spirit Song of Songs chapter
[1:05:34] 3 and verse 6 who is this
[1:05:40] that coming out of the wilderness
[1:05:44] like pillars of smoke
[1:05:47] perfumed with myrrh and frankincense
[1:05:51] with all powders of the merchant
[1:05:56] now let's turn to Revelation chapter 19.
[1:06:00] and we're going to read verse 7 8 and 9.
[1:06:04] let us be glad
[1:06:06] and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:06:11] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[1:06:17] his
[1:06:18] wife hath made her self ready something
[1:06:24] has transitioned the bride to wife
[1:06:29] something had to take place to move her
[1:06:33] from the realm of a spousal engagement
[1:06:38] to being the wife
[1:06:41] she had made herself ready and to her
[1:06:45] was granted
[1:06:48] she didn't get it on her own find it
[1:06:50] somewhere pay for it it was given to her
[1:06:54] it was granted that she should be
[1:06:57] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:07:01] for the fine linen is
[1:07:05] the righteousness of of saints and he
[1:07:09] saith unto me right blessed are they
[1:07:13] which are called unto the marriage
[1:07:16] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[1:07:20] these are the true sayings of God are
[1:07:25] you with me tonight
[1:07:27] then I want us to go to Song of Songs
[1:07:29] chapter 8.
[1:07:36] I just felt impressed that we remain
[1:07:40] standing for for the for the rest of
[1:07:43] this reading
[1:07:46] verse 5 who is this
[1:07:49] that cometh up from the Wilderness
[1:07:52] leaning upon her beloved
[1:07:56] I raise thee Up Under The Apple Tree
[1:07:59] there thy mother brought thee forth
[1:08:02] there she brought thee forth that bear
[1:08:06] thee
[1:08:07] set me as a seal upon thine heart as a
[1:08:12] seal upon thine arm for love is strong
[1:08:16] as death
[1:08:18] jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals
[1:08:24] thereof are coals of fire which hath the
[1:08:28] most vehement flame many Waters cannot
[1:08:33] quench love neither can the floods drown
[1:08:36] it if a man would give all the substance
[1:08:39] of his house for love it would utterly
[1:08:43] be contemned
[1:08:47] and then finally Song of Songs
[1:08:51] chapter 7 and verse 4.
[1:08:54] thy neck is a tower of ivory
[1:09:00] thine eyes like the fish pools in
[1:09:04] heshbon by the gate of bath rabim thy
[1:09:09] nose is as the Tower of Lebanon which
[1:09:14] looketh toward Damascus

[1:10:31] forming the eyes of my wife in this hour

[1:12:35] found among that church that has been
[1:12:39] chosen

[1:13:04] to miss see tight God was bringing
[1:13:07] Israel his people out a nation

[1:13:15] nation out

[1:13:24] type of today that God is calling his
[1:13:28] bride out of a church

[1:13:48] a bride church out of a church which is
[1:13:52] called in the Bible or it's referred to
[1:13:54] in the Bible We Know by the word of the
[1:13:58] Lord that she is not only espoused as a
[1:14:02] bride to him but the scripture
[1:14:04] specifically describes her as a Chase
[1:14:07] virgin do you believe that I want you to
[1:14:11] stay with me in the foundation second
[1:14:13] Corinthians 11 and 2 for I am jealous
[1:14:17] Paul says I am jealous over you not with
[1:14:22] a carnal jealousy but with a Godly
[1:14:25] jealousy for it has become my
[1:14:28] responsibility he's saying for I have
[1:14:31] espoused you to
[1:14:36] not to a bishop
[1:14:38] not to a pope not to a top ten in the
[1:14:42] message list but I have espoused you to
[1:14:46] one husband that I may present you as a
[1:14:50] you read it for me
[1:14:52] a chaste virgin to Christ a chaste
[1:14:57] virgin is one who is not defiled by
[1:15:01] fornication and uncleanness
[1:15:05] this is how we're going to do it I'm
[1:15:08] going to say it and if you believe it
[1:15:10] you're going to amen it
[1:15:13] so we can move quick
[1:15:15] you want to start over
[1:15:16] a Chase virgin is one look the only way
[1:15:20] I can get 13 pages in tonight is stay
[1:15:22] close to my notes and the only way we
[1:15:25] can flow is I'll do my thing you do your
[1:15:27] thing if you believe it
[1:15:29] don't just blindly say Amen but if it
[1:15:32] strikes your heart you respond
[1:15:35] we're going to be kind of liturgical has
[1:15:38] has any of you been in a church where
[1:15:40] they had a liturgy
[1:15:41] and you get up and and the the priest or
[1:15:45] whoever he would read a verse and then
[1:15:47] the people would have a stanza of
[1:15:49] response
[1:15:52] and then one more statement and the
[1:15:54] people that's how we're going to do it
[1:15:56] tonight we're going to be very very
[1:15:58] ecclesiastical in our support
[1:16:01] I'm going to say it if you believe it
[1:16:03] you're going to respond a Chase virgin
[1:16:06] is one who is not defiled by fornication
[1:16:10] and uncleanness
[1:16:12] a chaste virgin is one who is espoused
[1:16:15] to a husband and greatly loved by him
[1:16:20] a Chase virgin is one who is longing for
[1:16:24] the wedding day
[1:16:29] surprises all expressions and tokens of
[1:16:33] love from the espouse
[1:16:36] she does not despise or reject any of
[1:16:41] his love gifts
[1:16:43] if he offers it she wants it
[1:16:47] if he hangs it over our head we reach up
[1:16:50] by faith and take a hold of it we don't
[1:16:54] want any of it to pass Us by we know
[1:16:58] that the Omega bride must be like the
[1:17:00] alpha bride but she comes with a double
[1:17:04] portion because she has seen her day
[1:17:08] she has recognized the day that she's
[1:17:12] living in and the message for that day a
[1:17:16] chaste virgin is one who Delights to
[1:17:20] hear as often as possible from her
[1:17:24] espoused
[1:17:25] once a week is not enough for her
[1:17:28] twice a week is not enough for her she
[1:17:31] constantly desire desires to hear him
[1:17:34] whisper his love to her day and night
[1:17:38] is that all right
[1:17:40] in the message scriptural signs of the
[1:17:42] time paragraph 42 he said but remember
[1:17:46] the bride will be a called out separated
[1:17:50] and different filled Holy Ghost born
[1:17:55] washed in the blood of the Lamb she'll
[1:17:59] abstain from everything that's filthy
[1:18:03] around her husband
[1:18:10] she is a Chase virgin
[1:18:13] pure
[1:18:16] by the word
[1:18:19] you see what's so powerful about this
[1:18:21] word
[1:18:22] is it restores virginity
[1:18:27] it restores chastity
[1:18:30] just someone who has already taken
[1:18:34] a seed from some denominational system
[1:18:37] out there
[1:18:40] somebody who's been raped by the church
[1:18:42] I'm going to talk a little plain now
[1:18:45] she's been raped by the church and yet
[1:18:49] she was waiting all the time to get to
[1:18:51] her husband
[1:18:54] and when the word comes she sees herself
[1:18:57] as filthy and unworthy but the word
[1:19:00] begins to wash her
[1:19:03] it begins to cleanse her it begins to
[1:19:07] restore her membrane
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:14] turns her bloody issue backwards
[1:19:17] he restores her membrane she stands
[1:19:21] before God in this hour no matter how
[1:19:24] many spiritual lovers she's had
[1:19:27] she stands virgin and chaste and pure
[1:19:31] because he sent A pure word
[1:19:34] you can never be purified by a mixed
[1:19:37] word
[1:19:38] it can be man and God it can't be the
[1:19:41] message and man it has to be the pure
[1:19:45] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:49] amen that's the only thing that can
[1:19:52] restore us back
[1:19:53] are you with me
[1:19:55] are you with me
[1:20:01] the word and her
[1:20:05] are the same
[1:20:08] as a man that his wife becomes one in
[1:20:12] Union
[1:20:15] when a man lays with his wife
[1:20:18] they become one in something holy
[1:20:23] and sacred how dare you take it
[1:20:27] how dare you take it before it belongs
[1:20:30] to you
[1:20:33] how dare us take something so holy and
[1:20:37] so sacred for our own pleasure
[1:20:40] before we have the contract before we
[1:20:44] have the katuba
[1:20:46] amen so we have most all of us failed
[1:20:52] somewhere along the way
[1:20:54] we have we have failed
[1:20:57] I I know that you know sometimes the
[1:21:00] message people can be so hard
[1:21:05] when a minister is going to take a life
[1:21:09] they can so scrutinize that woman
[1:21:14] to make sure that she's a virgin because
[1:21:18] of an isolated verse because of some
[1:21:21] comments that brother branna made and
[1:21:23] I'm for that
[1:21:24] don't you misunderstand me I'm for that
[1:21:28] but I would like to know are we going to
[1:21:31] ask the preacher
[1:21:36] are we going to ask the preacher are you
[1:21:39] a virgin
[1:21:40] how many lovers have you had before you
[1:21:43] came to Christ
[1:21:46] is it that you stand behind the holy
[1:21:48] desk having more than one lover you do
[1:21:51] it because the word has purified you if
[1:21:54] you've let it you do it because God has
[1:21:57] erased your past you have become one
[1:22:00] with the word
[1:22:01] why don't we give a sister some Grace
[1:22:07] some of you are shocked you heard me say
[1:22:09] it
[1:22:12] it's a very sad condition
[1:22:14] I know of some situations where young
[1:22:17] women promise themselves to young men
[1:22:20] and and and something happened that that
[1:22:23] broke the engagement and the pastors
[1:22:26] would raise up and tell this girl you
[1:22:29] can never be married again so so rock
[1:22:33] hard and so solid but what about the boy
[1:22:36] oh it didn't matter
[1:22:40] because this message world is so hung
[1:22:43] you know on the man can and the woman
[1:22:46] can't and they they get so bogged down
[1:22:49] in their religion
[1:22:52] they divide themselves over things that
[1:22:55] are really not essential
[1:22:58] and they forget what the word has done
[1:23:00] for us
[1:23:01] oh I believe in being pure I believe a
[1:23:04] man ought to take a pure wife if he's
[1:23:06] gonna fill this desk don't you
[1:23:09] misunderstand me but I also know that
[1:23:13] none of us have the right to throw
[1:23:14] stones it was not whether or not we
[1:23:18] remain pure all of our lives that made
[1:23:21] us virgin it was the pure word of God
[1:23:26] that set the record straight just a
[1:23:28] minute Amen brother
[1:23:31] so some of us were married to Assembly
[1:23:34] of God and Methodist and Baptist and
[1:23:38] Pentecostal
[1:23:42] and you don't think I'm going to be
[1:23:44] married to somebody and not lay with
[1:23:46] them do you
[1:23:48] is that too plain
[1:23:50] so if I was married to the Methodist you
[1:23:53] better know I took what they had to give
[1:23:56] is that too plain
[1:23:58] and you did two Baptist Pentecostal
[1:24:00] whatever Brethren whatever Church Amish
[1:24:04] Bishops or whoever it was
[1:24:07] if you were joined to them you took
[1:24:09] their seed you took what they had and
[1:24:12] then the word came looking for you
[1:24:16] you didn't find this Prophet you didn't
[1:24:19] find this message this message found you
[1:24:23] because God wanted to reverse
[1:24:27] you're Wandering Way
[1:24:30] and he wanted to cleanse you
[1:24:33] he wanted to make you virgin born
[1:24:36] born again
[1:24:38] that's what he does that's what the word
[1:24:40] does the word and her are the same
[1:24:43] let me just ask are you still with me
[1:24:45] then let's go back to being liturgical I
[1:24:48] say it you refrain you come back with a
[1:24:51] response refrain in that in that context
[1:24:54] doesn't mean refrain from amending
[1:24:57] it means as I reply as a refrain you get
[1:25:00] with me because I want to talk to you in
[1:25:02] a moment or two about your eyes you can
[1:25:05] tell a lot about somebody
[1:25:07] by looking in their eyes I want you to
[1:25:11] know there's something happening to the
[1:25:13] bride's eyes
[1:25:14] in this hour
[1:25:16] she's having some help from on high some
[1:25:20] cataract surgery is taking place
[1:25:23] some reshaping and reforming and
[1:25:26] remolding is taking place and the
[1:25:28] healing and a restoration is taking
[1:25:31] place in the bride's eyes
[1:25:34] he's going to see clearer now than she
[1:25:37] has ever seen before
[1:25:40] she's going to notice and recognize very
[1:25:43] quickly when the enemy is trying to sell
[1:25:45] her ability
[1:25:47] when the enemy is trying to put
[1:25:49] something on her some lie some untruth
[1:25:52] some Spirit of disqualification she's
[1:25:55] going to see that devil she's going to
[1:25:57] recognize that snake tail
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:02] she may have to do like the Apostle Paul
[1:26:05] and take that Viper up
[1:26:08] sling it in the fire and say you can't
[1:26:11] have my vision
[1:26:13] you can distract me from the word
[1:26:17] I need some help
[1:26:20] the word and her the same as a man and
[1:26:22] his wife becomes one in Union so does
[1:26:26] the real genuine Church of God when he
[1:26:31] becomes in Christ the Bible is
[1:26:33] punctuated with a
[1:26:36] every promise don't make any difference
[1:26:39] what the denomination says the soul
[1:26:42] that's in The Believer punctuates it
[1:26:44] isn't that what I was asking you to do
[1:26:46] because it is the word in him
[1:26:51] the word has to punctuate the word
[1:26:54] didn't brother tell us last night we are
[1:26:56] a word sent from God then you can hear
[1:26:59] the Living Word of God and not respond
[1:27:02] in some way
[1:27:03] first and foremost your faith has to
[1:27:06] reach out and take a hold of that word
[1:27:09] but if you can be so bold as to say a so
[1:27:14] be it and amen you make that word
[1:27:18] personal in your life
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:21] it's not the noise I crave
[1:27:24] it's a faith refrain
[1:27:26] it's a response that says that's the
[1:27:29] truth
[1:27:30] I'm sticking to it
[1:27:33] I don't care what anybody else says I'm
[1:27:36] staying with that word
[1:27:38] the bride church is much loved by the
[1:27:40] Lord Jesus Christ as scripture says he
[1:27:43] rejoices over his people
[1:27:46] when you're worshiping him and you're
[1:27:49] rejoicing over his goodness and
[1:27:52] faithfulness to you if you could see him
[1:27:54] if you could catch a vision a glimpse I
[1:27:58] want you to know he is joying over you
[1:28:01] he is delighting over here he is
[1:28:05] hovering over you like the song told us
[1:28:08] tonight
[1:28:09] what a great privilege and
[1:28:12] responsibility is ours to be a part of
[1:28:15] the chosen bride Church
[1:28:17] the seed does not air with the shut
[1:28:19] brother random said in paragraph 99 I'm
[1:28:23] almost done with the quoting but uh but
[1:28:25] uh not because I don't think it's
[1:28:27] important I just wanted to lay it as a
[1:28:30] foundation he said but when you come to
[1:28:32] say I and my father are one and these
[1:28:36] other things
[1:28:38] all right
[1:28:40] that's when the shook
[1:28:43] starts pulling away from the seed
[1:28:46] you remember you know as long as the
[1:28:49] fish sandwiches were being served he
[1:28:51] didn't have a problem pulling in the
[1:28:53] crowd
[1:28:54] as long as brother Branham was seeing
[1:28:56] visions and Discerning everybody's needs
[1:28:58] he didn't have a problem filling up the
[1:28:59] largest auditoriums in the world
[1:29:01] but then the word began to come a little
[1:29:04] straighter a little clearer hello
[1:29:07] Jesus began to talk to his disciples he
[1:29:10] began to tell them you're going to have
[1:29:11] to eat my my body
[1:29:13] you're going to have to eat my flesh and
[1:29:15] drink my blood and it so stirred some of
[1:29:18] them that they begin to pull away
[1:29:21] that shuck will pull away from the seed
[1:29:23] every time that's just a carrier it's
[1:29:26] just a protector it's there to protect
[1:29:29] the seed to bring it to the hour of its
[1:29:32] maturity you know that to be right but
[1:29:35] he said the real genuine bride church
[1:29:37] will bring forth
[1:29:40] how about you reading it the entire
[1:29:47] in its
[1:29:49] and it's
[1:29:52] for he's the same yesterday today
[1:29:56] and forever aren't you glad
[1:29:59] you see this bride church has a
[1:30:01] responsibility
[1:30:04] the bride church is intent on being kept
[1:30:08] pure from idolatry
[1:30:12] I believe you can do better
[1:30:14] I'm giving my all I'm waiting on you to
[1:30:16] give yours
[1:30:18] the bride church is intent on being kept
[1:30:22] pure from idolatry
[1:30:24] there you go that's sounding better
[1:30:27] that means she's not into Pastor worship
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:34] she's not into church worship
[1:30:37] she's not into brother Branham worship
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:43] it's him be a man
[1:30:45] do you let your pastor be a man if you
[1:30:48] don't you'll never have a leader
[1:30:51] the man that God chooses to lead you
[1:30:53] wherever you worship is going to be a
[1:30:56] broken vessel
[1:30:57] you don't hold him to Perfection and
[1:31:00] infallibility you let him grow
[1:31:03] some of you have been with me since I
[1:31:06] was a 21 years old
[1:31:09] I'm 55 now
[1:31:11] we've grown together
[1:31:14] you've given me Grace and I have given
[1:31:17] you Grace
[1:31:18] you have not worshiped me and if that
[1:31:22] Spirit tried to raise its head here God
[1:31:25] knows how he always knew how to deal
[1:31:28] with that
[1:31:30] if you get to lean into heavy on your
[1:31:32] preacher
[1:31:33] God knows how to deal with that
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:38] a church like some that I love and some
[1:31:41] that I know of that go all these years
[1:31:44] and can't find a replacement for their
[1:31:47] pastor
[1:31:50] something is wrong
[1:31:53] you want a carbon copy and God doesn't
[1:31:57] have carbon copies
[1:31:59] you've got to understand that a mighty
[1:32:02] man may lead you through a season and
[1:32:04] another mighty man might have to come
[1:32:06] and take his place
[1:32:08] to lead you through a season we're
[1:32:11] talking about pastors now we're not
[1:32:13] talking about word prophets I caught
[1:32:15] your thought
[1:32:17] I'm not making an eighth messenger out
[1:32:20] of anybody
[1:32:22] but I'm telling you you don't worship
[1:32:24] your pastor
[1:32:26] you don't worship the vision of the
[1:32:29] church
[1:32:31] some churches are mission driven and if
[1:32:34] they're not careful they'll worship the
[1:32:37] mission field
[1:32:41] some churches are branham-driven
[1:32:46] it's all they see
[1:32:48] they can't even believe that God is
[1:32:51] going to do something in his bride in
[1:32:54] the absence of the prophet
[1:33:00] so they're waiting to see how it's going
[1:33:03] to be
[1:33:04] they put more confidence in brother
[1:33:06] Walker's dream
[1:33:10] and brother Junie Jackson's dream than
[1:33:13] they do in the pure word of the message
[1:33:15] or the hour
[1:33:16] they take these dreams where it's spoken
[1:33:19] I'll ride this Trail again and they're
[1:33:22] hold because brother random is telling
[1:33:23] the dream they're holding that to some
[1:33:26] level of infallibility and in their own
[1:33:30] just like Abraham had an Ishmael
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:37] Ishmael was a prophet of Hagar's womb
[1:33:43] and Abram's loins
[1:33:50] this right here
[1:33:52] now I know he gave her a natural seed
[1:33:55] but it was an idea
[1:33:57] the very thing that God is in trouble in
[1:33:59] the first place was an idea that was
[1:34:03] full of discrepancy
[1:34:04] anybody with me
[1:34:06] and so God had to deal with that
[1:34:09] he had the deal you know it's a good
[1:34:11] idea but just because it's a good idea
[1:34:16] doesn't mean it's a god idea
[1:34:20] I like what brother told us tonight he
[1:34:22] kept saying if God ever does it one time
[1:34:25] one way
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:28] if he ever does anything similar to that
[1:34:30] again he's going to do it just like he
[1:34:34] did it the first time
[1:34:40] every time
[1:34:41] now if you raise brother Branham up to
[1:34:44] the level of Jesus Christ
[1:34:46] then no wonder you have to bring him
[1:34:49] back
[1:34:50] for a 40-day period of ministry
[1:34:55] if you make him Jesus no wonder you have
[1:34:58] to believe he's going to return to
[1:35:00] finish what he started
[1:35:01] but it's not a one-man ministry that's
[1:35:05] going to perfect the bride
[1:35:07] it's not press play
[1:35:10] the bride the Bible tells us in
[1:35:13] Ephesians very clearly how the bride is
[1:35:17] going to come to her perfection
[1:35:20] with a five-fold Ministry
[1:35:25] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:35:29] evangelists
[1:35:31] somebody said you really believe that
[1:35:33] there are New Testament prophets alive
[1:35:35] today if there are not you and I are
[1:35:39] sunk
[1:35:42] because Paul the first church age
[1:35:44] messenger said that body will never come
[1:35:47] to the unity of the faith without the
[1:35:49] touch of the fifo ministry
[1:35:53] it's going to be a many membered body
[1:35:56] with a many membered Ministry you need
[1:35:59] more than apostles
[1:36:01] you need prophets too you need
[1:36:04] evangelists too we need teachers too
[1:36:07] somebody said where are they don't you
[1:36:09] worry
[1:36:11] are clouded over eyes are going to be
[1:36:14] clearer as we go forward
[1:36:17] and what we're going to find out is that
[1:36:19] many times they were among us all the
[1:36:22] time
[1:36:24] God had placed them there
[1:36:28] for such a time as this
[1:36:31] they didn't even know what their calling
[1:36:34] was
[1:36:35] until the word came alive
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:40] you know how that kind of a shoe forgive
[1:36:43] me
[1:36:45] do you know how that kind of ministry is
[1:36:47] birthed
[1:36:48] it's not birthed by by opportunities to
[1:36:51] preach
[1:36:54] you can't put somebody in the fivefold
[1:36:56] ministry by giving them the pulpit
[1:37:01] every brother every holy ghost-filled
[1:37:04] brother in this church ought to be able
[1:37:06] to take a service
[1:37:12] if you're the husband of one wife
[1:37:15] and you pass the other qualifications
[1:37:17] that the Bible tells us concerning the
[1:37:20] elders every every brother every Holy
[1:37:24] Ghost Field brother
[1:37:26] out not to have to worry myself to death
[1:37:29] on this is fixing to sound pastoral
[1:37:32] I'm an evangelist tonight
[1:37:35] I'm I'm a I'm a guest speaker at this
[1:37:38] here camp meeting
[1:37:40] and I'm about to say some kind of
[1:37:42] pastoral
[1:37:44] but I want you to hear me and I want you
[1:37:46] to hear me well
[1:37:48] there's so many that feel that call but
[1:37:51] I want you to know it takes more than
[1:37:53] that call I want to tell you I want to
[1:37:55] show you how how Ministry is born it's
[1:37:58] not born by practice
[1:38:02] although we all need it
[1:38:04] we need it young ministers especially
[1:38:06] they need exposure and they need
[1:38:09] opportunity
[1:38:11] but that Ministry that that calling
[1:38:14] especially to the Ascension gifts and
[1:38:16] what are they again Apostles prophets
[1:38:18] pastors teachers evangelists the Bible
[1:38:21] said that he ascended
[1:38:23] he gave gifts unto men
[1:38:26] so we call that the accented gifts he
[1:38:30] left something he ordained something
[1:38:32] while he was leaving
[1:38:34] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:38:38] evangelists now you can't train somebody
[1:38:41] into that
[1:38:44] brother Branham said they're born there
[1:38:46] but they may not know it
[1:38:49] you may have been born to be a pastor
[1:38:51] but you may not know it
[1:38:53] are you with me you may have been born
[1:38:55] with a prophetic gift in your life to to
[1:38:58] serve the body as a new testament
[1:39:00] Prophet but you may not know that
[1:39:04] so how do you get that kind of a
[1:39:06] Ministry birthed
[1:39:08] you do it in the prayer Chapel
[1:39:14] you do it in the altar
[1:39:16] you do it on the floor here
[1:39:19] we call it carpet time
[1:39:22] it's when you get down and bury your
[1:39:24] nose in the rug
[1:39:26] that's when we're gonna know you're
[1:39:28] serious about the call of God on your
[1:39:30] life amen
[1:39:33] that's where my Ministry was birthed at
[1:39:36] the foot of my bed as a boy my Ministry
[1:39:39] whatever little bit God has given to me
[1:39:42] it wasn't birthed by opportunity
[1:39:45] it was birthed by wailing it was birthed
[1:39:48] by groaning
[1:39:50] it was birthed by wrestling
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:55] by saying I'm not turning you loose
[1:39:58] until you set in order what you have
[1:40:01] sown in my life come on now and that
[1:40:05] little bride she's about to get some
[1:40:06] clarity in her vision you're going to
[1:40:09] see young men you're going to see young
[1:40:11] men begin to get serious about the word
[1:40:17] they're not just going to look for an
[1:40:18] opportunity to speak I said every holy
[1:40:22] ghost filled brother I ought not as a
[1:40:24] pastor I ought not to have to worry
[1:40:27] I ought not to have to always clear my
[1:40:30] schedule with brother Greeley and him
[1:40:31] clear his schedule with me to make sure
[1:40:34] that one of us is here
[1:40:36] any Holy Ghost Field brother in this
[1:40:39] church
[1:40:40] ought to have enough of the word in you
[1:40:42] that if you're called on you could take
[1:40:44] a service
[1:40:47] well what if I didn't preach like you
[1:40:49] you better not
[1:40:52] You Preach like you
[1:40:54] you speak like you
[1:40:58] there's Grace in this house for those
[1:41:01] who want to start to do something for
[1:41:03] the Lord
[1:41:05] everybody doesn't have a grandmother
[1:41:07] that'll just give you the pulpit
[1:41:09] you need an opportunity all right let me
[1:41:13] tell you what God does he opens doors
[1:41:16] for those that he puts his trust in
[1:41:20] he'll open doors
[1:41:22] we need a five-fold Ministry it's not
[1:41:25] all hanging in the infallibility of one
[1:41:27] man
[1:41:28] now I know brother Brandon was not a new
[1:41:30] testament Prophet I know that he was
[1:41:32] more on the order of a word Prophet I
[1:41:34] know that he was a a voice he was a a
[1:41:37] spokesman he was a messenger for the
[1:41:41] seventh angel
[1:41:42] only one of those in a generation
[1:41:45] only one of those to a church age are
[1:41:48] you with me
[1:41:49] may not always fit the chart
[1:41:51] you know a man's Ministry might go a
[1:41:54] little bit beyond it might it might go
[1:41:56] beyond his death
[1:41:58] so people get a little worked up when
[1:42:00] they start checking the numbers and The
[1:42:02] Messengers that were assigned as the
[1:42:04] seven Church age Messengers and they
[1:42:06] find out that one didn't even live in
[1:42:08] his church age that ought not to be so
[1:42:09] so horrible for you that ought not to be
[1:42:12] said let me tell you something
[1:42:13] especially in an hour like we live today
[1:42:16] where you don't have to be in a live
[1:42:18] Ministry there to hear the word of God
[1:42:20] you can hear the word of God anytime you
[1:42:22] want to but if you want to come to the
[1:42:25] Perfection and unity of the faith
[1:42:27] you're going to need Apostles prophets
[1:42:29] pastors teachers and evangelists to do
[1:42:31] it am I making that plain enough
[1:42:33] now if you're going to make brother
[1:42:34] Branham infallible and you're going to
[1:42:36] say things like he never made a mistake
[1:42:38] when he says over and over and over
[1:42:40] again he did
[1:42:42] and if you're going to let him misquote
[1:42:44] a scripture or add two scriptures
[1:42:46] together and you're going to have to do
[1:42:48] the same thing because he did
[1:42:51] because you don't want to Bear some kind
[1:42:53] of false witness on him and make him
[1:42:55] look like anything less
[1:42:57] so you'll get up these preachers will
[1:42:59] get up and they'll misquote the verse
[1:43:01] because he did and if you question them
[1:43:03] they'll say something like well that was
[1:43:05] God's Vindicated voice
[1:43:10] so if he said this verse wrong then it
[1:43:13] must have should have been that way in
[1:43:15] the first place
[1:43:18] no wonder they have to say there was no
[1:43:20] no perfect man like him no perfect
[1:43:23] messenger like him they have to
[1:43:25] disqualify Paul
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:29] thank you
[1:43:31] amen somebody said I wonder how the
[1:43:33] prophet would take to this kind of
[1:43:34] preaching I want you to know he's
[1:43:36] waiting on men
[1:43:38] he's waiting on this hour for men with a
[1:43:41] backbone
[1:43:43] to say you have rallied and run yourself
[1:43:46] crazy around the signpost
[1:43:50] now it's time to hear the voice
[1:43:54] and go do what he told us to do
[1:43:57] the bride has to have that Revival the
[1:44:01] bride has to move in the ministry that
[1:44:03] God has given to her
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:06] John the Baptist had to decrease
[1:44:18] are you still here
[1:44:24] we've got to be kept pure from all
[1:44:26] idolatry
[1:44:28] you can't worship your mama
[1:44:32] she's human
[1:44:34] it can't worship your daddy
[1:44:36] he's human
[1:44:39] you can't pray to pictures
[1:44:44] that's icons that's Catholicism that's
[1:44:47] paganism that's why the Jews have no
[1:44:49] confidence in Christianity yet
[1:44:51] because all they see is lighting candles
[1:44:54] and praying to Halo pictures
[1:45:07] they'll say things like they'll say
[1:45:09] things like well you know God loved that
[1:45:10] man so much that he had his picture made
[1:45:12] with him I think that's precious to say
[1:45:15] let me tell you how much you love me
[1:45:18] he loved me so much that he came down to
[1:45:21] live in my body
[1:45:23] you don't get any higher honor than that
[1:45:26] he loved you so much that he chose to
[1:45:28] come into you and purify You by his word
[1:45:32] so if you don't ever have a halo over
[1:45:34] your head if the pillar of fire don't
[1:45:37] ever physically hang over your head the
[1:45:40] prophet said you're more valuable to God
[1:45:42] than all the angels
[1:45:45] you carry as his bride more Authority in
[1:45:50] the Earth
[1:45:53] because you've got the word in you and
[1:45:56] if you're still if you've still got some
[1:45:58] of you in there try to get that squeezed
[1:46:00] out
[1:46:02] I'm not saying you're perfect but I'm
[1:46:04] telling you the the perfect one is in
[1:46:06] you the perfect one is in me
[1:46:10] we can't just point people back
[1:46:13] we've got to let them understand there's
[1:46:15] something to see out there
[1:46:17] I'm tired of this pest house
[1:46:20] so we've got to put away our Dollar Tree
[1:46:22] no more Pastor worship I hope I'm
[1:46:24] getting that in there enough
[1:46:26] the bride church is intent on making
[1:46:29] sure that there is not an inordinate
[1:46:32] love of the world found in her
[1:46:35] because if you love the world the things
[1:46:37] of the world the things of God they have
[1:46:40] no place to Lodge in you
[1:46:42] come on now I told you on Sunday we're
[1:46:45] going to have to be inconvenienced a
[1:46:47] little bit for that last move of God
[1:46:52] you may have to miss some of your
[1:46:54] Netflix series you may have to miss
[1:46:56] something from time to time you may have
[1:46:59] to lay something aside
[1:47:03] you may have to get up a little earlier
[1:47:05] so you can get to church on time
[1:47:07] and you can get a seat
[1:47:11] I know some of you really like your seat
[1:47:17] you may lose your seat
[1:47:21] there's a way to rivety that just get
[1:47:23] here early enough to claim it then put
[1:47:26] your little self in it and stay there
[1:47:28] amen because what I saw last night when
[1:47:31] that Spirit of Prophecy was stirring in
[1:47:33] here what I saw was God saying bone
[1:47:35] going to find its bone
[1:47:38] God's calling a tribe together he's
[1:47:40] calling a tribe together may he do it
[1:47:43] everywhere
[1:47:45] somebody said you're you talk like this
[1:47:47] place is special what kind of a pastor
[1:47:50] doesn't feel like
[1:47:53] that God has placed him in a special
[1:47:57] place
[1:47:59] you know special can mean a lot of
[1:48:02] things
[1:48:04] no offense but it can mean you ride on a
[1:48:06] short bus
[1:48:09] no offense
[1:48:13] well ain't he special
[1:48:19] that's a nice way to say he's ugly but I
[1:48:21] know you love him
[1:48:27] you do that to any of the youngins
[1:48:29] around here and you're going to deal
[1:48:30] with me because I have found out that
[1:48:32] when someone when when people are on
[1:48:34] folk or bride God gives them beautiful
[1:48:37] broad children
[1:48:40] we have some of the most beautiful
[1:48:41] children and young people in this church
[1:48:44] anywhere in the world
[1:48:47] somebody said well you're probably just
[1:48:49] a little bit prejudiced I am not
[1:48:54] I know when somebody's got a pretty look
[1:48:57] about them the touch of God beautifies
[1:49:00] he beautifies the meek with salvation
[1:49:03] doesn't he hello
[1:49:06] so we don't want to be found as the
[1:49:07] bride church with the love of the world
[1:49:09] in US
[1:49:10] the bride church is concerned with only
[1:49:13] pure worship
[1:49:17] directed toward her bridegroom she's not
[1:49:20] watching to see what everybody else is
[1:49:22] doing
[1:49:24] she doesn't turn around to look to see
[1:49:26] who's watching her
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:30] do we get a little that sometime don't
[1:49:31] you do that
[1:49:33] don't you do that
[1:49:35] I tell you when you get into that pure
[1:49:37] worship
[1:49:38] you don't care if you're if your Dunlap
[1:49:41] is jiggling
[1:49:46] you know what that is that's that part
[1:49:47] of you that's done lapped over your belt
[1:49:52] if you wear your pants big enough like I
[1:49:55] do mine you won't have that you pull
[1:49:57] them up like they ought to be pulled up
[1:49:58] you won't look like these men with their
[1:50:00] belly hanging down there and their
[1:50:01] britches down there buy you a bigger
[1:50:04] pair
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:14] you don't care if you're done lap
[1:50:16] Jiggles a little bit
[1:50:18] when you get lost in that pure worship
[1:50:20] it does you're not thinking about your
[1:50:23] hair you're not thinking about you're
[1:50:25] just thinking about him
[1:50:29] the bride Church the bride Church Longs
[1:50:32] for the return of the bridegroom you you
[1:50:35] you you get around people long enough I
[1:50:38] gotta hurry I've totally forgot
[1:50:41] you you you get around people very long
[1:50:44] and you'll find out that that talk that
[1:50:47] you ask them do you believe the Lord's
[1:50:48] coming yes but they don't live like they
[1:50:50] believe he's coming
[1:50:52] they've got a 40-year plan
[1:50:57] I believe we ought to we ought to plan
[1:50:59] you know I believe that I believe we
[1:51:01] ought to have a plan for our future but
[1:51:04] I don't believe that's what we ought to
[1:51:05] be called up in
[1:51:09] we can see we see how suddenly things
[1:51:12] can change
[1:51:17] on a Monday a diagnosis came
[1:51:23] not even two weeks later how many days
[1:51:27] two two weeks just two weeks at two
[1:51:30] weeks
[1:51:31] two weeks later our sister gone from us
[1:51:36] you have you listen we have no guarantee
[1:51:43] the real true bride Church she Longs for
[1:51:46] the return of the bridegroom
[1:51:49] they don't say these ridiculous things
[1:51:51] like I want the Lord to come but I will
[1:51:53] want to be married first
[1:51:56] I want the Lord to come but I want to
[1:51:58] have babies first let me tell you
[1:51:59] something you get the bridegroom in your
[1:52:02] vision
[1:52:05] and you'll understand that if you'll let
[1:52:07] him he will be everything to you
[1:52:10] he fulfills the longing of your soul he
[1:52:15] fulfills the deepest desire of your
[1:52:18] inner spirit
[1:52:20] just see him look to him find him the
[1:52:23] bride Church secures her own wedding
[1:52:26] garment we read it and make sure
[1:52:29] it's up to you to make sure it stays
[1:52:31] clean
[1:52:33] it's up to you to make sure it stays
[1:52:34] spotless are you with me as for the song
[1:52:38] of songs there's much controversy that
[1:52:41] surrounds that book and yet it was added
[1:52:43] to the Bible under the inspiration of
[1:52:45] the Holy Ghost simply put it as a song
[1:52:47] of love between King Solomon and the
[1:52:50] shulamite shepherdists
[1:52:52] 33 times in the song we find the word
[1:52:56] beloved in reference to our beloved in
[1:52:59] reference to the bride and her
[1:53:01] soon-to-be groomed 28 times it is the
[1:53:05] shulamite girl calling Solomon her
[1:53:08] beloved in Song of Songs 216 my beloved
[1:53:12] is mine and I am his
[1:53:16] he feedeth among the lilies in song of
[1:53:19] Psalm 6 3 I am my beloveds
[1:53:22] and my beloved is mine
[1:53:26] he feedeth among the lilies
[1:53:29] but we know it's much more than just a
[1:53:32] love song between King Solomon and the
[1:53:35] shulamite shepherdists it's a picture of
[1:53:38] our Heavenly bridegroom pursuing his
[1:53:40] bride and it opens up a Wellspring of
[1:53:42] understanding to us while there are some
[1:53:45] graphic words some analogies that some
[1:53:47] may not understand it serves to give us
[1:53:50] great spiritual truth concerning our
[1:53:53] bridegroom's passionate love for us
[1:53:56] I'm I am impressed to focus this evening
[1:54:00] for the little bit of time I have left
[1:54:02] on one analogy that will give us a real
[1:54:06] pause if we choose to pursue it I want
[1:54:09] to talk about her eyes
[1:54:11] the most important organ for finding out
[1:54:14] about the world around us is the eye it
[1:54:17] is used to gain knowledge appreciate
[1:54:19] Beauty recognize the Bad and the Ugly
[1:54:22] the Bible connects the eye with our
[1:54:25] emotions
[1:54:27] Lamentations 351 the eye affects the
[1:54:30] heart Deuteronomy 7 16 the eyes can pity
[1:54:34] job 16 20 the eyes pour out tears of
[1:54:38] compassion Psalm 31 9 the eyes can be
[1:54:41] consumed with grief Psalm 88 9 the eye
[1:54:45] Mourns
[1:54:47] Genesis 3 6 something can be pleasant
[1:54:51] and bring pleasure to the eye song of
[1:54:54] Solomon's 4 9 ravish the heart she
[1:54:58] ravish the heart of her bridegroom
[1:55:01] with her eyes song of song 6 5 your eyes
[1:55:05] have overcome me the beauty of an eye
[1:55:09] can overcome the bridegroom the Bible
[1:55:13] also connects are you with me the Bible
[1:55:15] also connects the eye with Revelation
[1:55:17] Psalm 119 18 open my eyes to behold your
[1:55:21] law Ephesians 1 17 18 the eyes of my
[1:55:25] understanding Psalm 32 8 guide me with
[1:55:28] your eye Genesis 21 19 God opened
[1:55:32] Hagar's eyes numbers 10 31 be to us
[1:55:35] instead of eyes
[1:55:37] second king 6 17 God opened the
[1:55:42] servant's Eyes First Corinthians 13 12
[1:55:44] now we see through a glass Darkly but
[1:55:47] then face to face so all through the
[1:55:50] scripture the Bible
[1:55:52] corresponds the eye with human emotion
[1:55:56] and all through the scripture the Bible
[1:55:59] connects the eye the human eye perhaps
[1:56:02] the spiritual human eye with revelation
[1:56:05] there are expressions that we use that
[1:56:08] concern the eye and I'm going to go over
[1:56:10] them real quickly with you that caught
[1:56:12] my eye
[1:56:14] what does that mean it means it
[1:56:15] attracted your attention feasted my eyes
[1:56:18] upon it means you looked at looked at
[1:56:20] something with pleasure and admiration
[1:56:22] gave him the eye
[1:56:26] that was my mama
[1:56:28] she always gave me the eye that means to
[1:56:31] look at to warn or with admiration
[1:56:34] he has an eye for that it means have the
[1:56:37] ability to notice with discernment and
[1:56:39] appreciation sometimes we say in the
[1:56:41] public eye that means well known or
[1:56:43] brought to public attention keep an eye
[1:56:45] on that it means look after or watch
[1:56:48] carefully keep your eyes open means be
[1:56:50] on the lookout Be watchful lay eyes on
[1:56:53] that means to look at and I laid my eyes
[1:56:56] on such a it means you looked at it
[1:56:58] right make eyes have you ever heard
[1:57:00] somebody say she made eyes at me
[1:57:05] would you do that if you're not my wife
[1:57:10] because that means flirt
[1:57:12] to look at lovingly
[1:57:15] and and some people will respond to to
[1:57:18] something they'll say my ah
[1:57:22] somebody look at me like you've never
[1:57:23] heard anybody say that before
[1:57:25] the Lord of Mercy I when I was in school
[1:57:27] they'd walk up to you pull their eyes
[1:57:28] say eyeball
[1:57:32] what's that eyeball
[1:57:37] my eye
[1:57:39] it means exclamation of contradiction or
[1:57:42] astonishment
[1:57:44] so there's a lot about our eyes would
[1:57:46] you agree
[1:57:47] we got to hurry
[1:57:49] that opened his eyes that means it made
[1:57:51] him aware of facts and real reasons see
[1:57:54] eye to eye that means whole precisely
[1:57:57] the same view see with half an eye that
[1:58:00] means to see or understand something
[1:58:01] easily because it's so evident shut his
[1:58:04] eyes to it means unwilling to see or to
[1:58:07] think about
[1:58:08] so obviously when Solomon declares that
[1:58:10] he was struck by the eyes of this young
[1:58:12] woman he wants to marry he's speaking
[1:58:15] figuratively are you with me the first
[1:58:17] thing he says about her eyes is she has
[1:58:19] Dove eyes
[1:58:21] did you hear the song about the dove
[1:58:23] Song of Songs 4 1. don't you leave me
[1:58:26] yet
[1:58:31] I'm not running a part two
[1:58:33] I'm gonna finish this tonight
[1:58:36] song of Psalms 4 1 behold Thou Art Fair
[1:58:39] my love behold Thou Art Fair thou Hast
[1:58:42] doves eyes within thy locks the Bible
[1:58:46] tells us in Matthew 6 22 the light of
[1:58:49] the body is the eye and if therefore the
[1:58:52] eye be single thy whole body shall be
[1:58:54] full of light but if thine eye be evil
[1:58:57] thy whole body shall be full of Darkness
[1:58:59] if therefore the light that is in thee
[1:59:01] be Darkness How great is the darkness
[1:59:04] did you know that when a dove fixes
[1:59:08] its gaze upon its mate
[1:59:12] it is never distracted by any activity
[1:59:17] around it
[1:59:20] I said when a dove fixes his or her eye
[1:59:24] on its mate it doesn't matter what's
[1:59:27] happening around them they lock eyes in
[1:59:31] such a profound way that sometimes
[1:59:33] people refer to that a dove as being a
[1:59:36] lovebird
[1:59:38] are having this Dove's eye as the bride
[1:59:41] of Christ indicates that we're becoming
[1:59:44] increasingly I've got to slow down it
[1:59:46] means that we are becoming increasingly
[1:59:49] aware of the Lord's person
[1:59:56] and his presence
[1:59:59] and that we possess a spiritual
[2:00:01] awareness that will lift us above the
[2:00:04] pools of the Earthly
[2:00:08] for a few moments last night as the
[2:00:10] service come to an end the spirit of God
[2:00:13] was still drawing in this place
[2:00:18] I knew he was drawing and I refused to
[2:00:20] let anybody take it into into Warfare or
[2:00:24] into any kind of violent intercession
[2:00:25] that is not where we were there's a time
[2:00:28] to war in the spirit there's a time to
[2:00:31] to uh to intercede with aggression in
[2:00:35] the spirit and then there's a time to
[2:00:38] recognize that the dove is over he's
[2:00:41] just hovering
[2:00:43] somebody said well I don't know what to
[2:00:45] do in times like that you don't have to
[2:00:47] do anything
[2:00:48] you don't have to do anything we make a
[2:00:50] great mistake
[2:00:52] we make I want to teach you something we
[2:00:54] make a great mistake when we think we've
[2:00:57] got to fill in the void there's never a
[2:01:00] void when the dove is hovering over our
[2:01:02] head
[2:01:03] we could sit and look each other in
[2:01:04] silence you know that's what lovebirds
[2:01:07] do
[2:01:09] we could just sit and look at one
[2:01:11] another here in silence as long as the
[2:01:13] dove is cooing over us
[2:01:16] we don't have to scream we don't have to
[2:01:18] be loud we don't have to pound the desk
[2:01:20] we don't have to beat a drum we don't
[2:01:22] have to wave a flag we don't have to
[2:01:24] shake a tambourine
[2:01:26] there's a time to do all of that
[2:01:28] you know as a pastor here you know that
[2:01:31] I believe that the people should have
[2:01:34] Liberty to worship God
[2:01:36] every time the enemy raises his ugly
[2:01:39] head to try to dictate in this house
[2:01:41] what worship will be like God has
[2:01:44] allowed us to beat him back
[2:01:48] you're not going to tell us we can't run
[2:01:52] jump or dance or shout or speak in
[2:01:56] tongues
[2:01:57] or twirl
[2:02:00] or wave a flag or throw a handkerchief
[2:02:07] every time the enemy has come through
[2:02:09] the years and tried to say you'll be
[2:02:11] more accepted
[2:02:16] hide the worshipers in the back
[2:02:21] so no streamer sees them
[2:02:23] if I was ashamed of the worship here we
[2:02:26] would have done something about it a
[2:02:28] long time ago I just wanted a place
[2:02:33] when my grandmother was leaving this
[2:02:35] world and God gave her the vision and
[2:02:38] took her out the spokes of a wheel out
[2:02:40] into the tragedies of the world she
[2:02:42] started in the hub The Hub was the
[2:02:44] anointing the spirit of God carried her
[2:02:47] out the various spokes of the wheel she
[2:02:49] saw disease and famine she saw World
[2:02:51] disaster she saw homosexuality and
[2:02:54] perversion she saw so many things just
[2:02:57] when she would feel like I can't I can't
[2:02:59] survive under the weight of how ugly it
[2:03:03] looks the spirit of God would pull her
[2:03:05] back down the spoke of the wheel and and
[2:03:07] an anchor Shah oh
[2:03:11] no
[2:03:12] and anchor her in the Hub in the
[2:03:15] anointing she told me that Vision the
[2:03:18] day of the day she died the morning the
[2:03:20] morning that she died either the morning
[2:03:21] she died or the morning before she died
[2:03:24] it was one of the last spiritual things
[2:03:26] that she said to me
[2:03:27] she said Steve you won't believe you
[2:03:29] won't believe it don't matter how black
[2:03:31] it gets out there it don't matter how
[2:03:33] filthy it looks if you'll always let him
[2:03:37] bring you back like he was doing me she
[2:03:39] said he brought me back
[2:03:42] she said it was like I was sliding back
[2:03:44] to the hub and the anointing just draped
[2:03:48] me and embraced me and wrapped its arms
[2:03:51] around me and all of a sudden are you
[2:03:53] with me
[2:03:55] and all of a sudden everything was all
[2:03:57] right
[2:03:58] uh uh
[2:04:00] jaw brother Josh antis come in and make
[2:04:03] it a little warmer those people are very
[2:04:05] very cold I'm very hot but it doesn't
[2:04:07] matter I I I'm sweaty but I I don't want
[2:04:10] nobody to get to catch a cold because
[2:04:13] you can't stay out
[2:04:15] laughs
[2:04:18] you can't have a sore throat and lay out
[2:04:20] this is you you don't want to miss this
[2:04:24] somebody didn't hear the message Sunday
[2:04:27] he said I'm going to give you the Moab
[2:04:29] I'm going to give you a Divine
[2:04:30] appointment I'm going to do something
[2:04:31] for you this week
[2:04:33] he didn't tell he didn't tell us what
[2:04:35] preacher he was going to use because
[2:04:37] he'll use us all if we'll yield to him
[2:04:40] he didn't tell us what service was going
[2:04:43] to be the best because they'll all be
[2:04:45] the best if we get everything out of
[2:04:47] them we can get I'm going to do it
[2:04:49] brother I'm gonna do it sister I'm gonna
[2:04:51] get everything I can get
[2:04:56] you've got to know when the spirit is
[2:04:58] calling and wooing and you've got to
[2:05:00] know what he releases you
[2:05:05] to stay one more to linger one moment
[2:05:08] longer than the spirit is wooing you is
[2:05:12] a waste of your good energy
[2:05:16] I lost friends one time at a camp
[2:05:18] meeting down the hill there under that
[2:05:20] Tabernacle
[2:05:21] because that long after the service was
[2:05:24] over there was a bunch of people from
[2:05:25] some of them from New Brunswick and from
[2:05:27] other places a big majority of them now
[2:05:30] dead a big majority of them gone and
[2:05:33] some left at very young ages but there
[2:05:36] were some of them who had come and they
[2:05:37] begin to try to to extend
[2:05:42] what God was it wasn't that he that he
[2:05:45] did want to help us
[2:05:47] it's that he has a time and a season
[2:05:52] for everything
[2:05:54] and boy I lay I begin to leave I began
[2:05:57] to get and all of a sudden the spirit of
[2:05:58] God just kind of picked me up and I ran
[2:06:00] like a wild man under that under that
[2:06:03] Tabernacle and I would go home I began
[2:06:05] to scream go home
[2:06:07] go home go back to your hotels
[2:06:11] go back get out
[2:06:14] I lost friends
[2:06:16] people didn't understand
[2:06:18] I stayed up half the night in a hotel
[2:06:21] parking lot by Cracker Barrel trying to
[2:06:24] explain to carnal-minded people
[2:06:28] how that God has an appointment
[2:06:30] and he has a season
[2:06:32] and there's a time to beat the floor and
[2:06:35] War and fight and push and there's a
[2:06:37] time to soak
[2:06:39] and there's a time to to respond to the
[2:06:42] call
[2:06:44] but you see our religious mentality
[2:06:47] things if I just pray five more minutes
[2:06:51] won't do your liquor good
[2:06:53] when the spirit is through with the
[2:06:55] assignment
[2:06:59] so don't get your feelings hurt
[2:07:02] when the when he's through calling I'm
[2:07:05] going to the house
[2:07:10] wouldn't be any need we're go but don't
[2:07:13] you worry somebody said well I ain't
[2:07:14] gonna know the difference you will you
[2:07:16] will because something
[2:07:19] because something's happening
[2:07:22] God is reforming our eyes
[2:07:25] he's reforming our eyes they'll they'll
[2:07:27] come along now say the only way to have
[2:07:29] a move of God is to tarry all night you
[2:07:31] can tarry all night and be no closer to
[2:07:33] him the next morning if God hasn't set
[2:07:36] an appointment with you
[2:07:42] you got to understand the times and
[2:07:44] seasons of the Lord
[2:07:46] I believe in fasting I believe fasting
[2:07:48] is a key for a lot of people in a lot of
[2:07:51] situations I believe fasting is one of
[2:07:53] the only things sometimes that can bust
[2:07:55] something open but I don't believe in
[2:07:56] fasting because you got an idea
[2:08:01] I believe listen if you're going to
[2:08:03] really fast you need to know God is
[2:08:05] wooing you
[2:08:06] he's calling you into time
[2:08:09] somebody said why would you say
[2:08:11] something like that because we were once
[2:08:12] on a 21 day Daniel Fast here and some
[2:08:15] just joined in because others were
[2:08:17] joining in and I'm telling you it turned
[2:08:19] loose mental sickness mental illness it
[2:08:22] turned loose all kinds of things in the
[2:08:24] house
[2:08:27] because it's just like Abraham and and
[2:08:29] Hagar
[2:08:32] God gave him a son but it was a product
[2:08:35] of Hagar's womb and his loins
[2:08:41] I know there are people who believe I
[2:08:43] know there are some of you who believe
[2:08:44] we need to be doing this and we need to
[2:08:46] be doing that and we need to be doing
[2:08:48] the other let me tell you what we need
[2:08:49] to be doing we need to be letting the
[2:08:52] Lord reform our eyes
[2:08:56] I'm telling you what worked in laodicea
[2:08:58] will not work where we're going
[2:09:00] [Applause]
[2:09:03] what worked in the church ages
[2:09:06] it won't work where we're going
[2:09:08] there is an exodus there is an exodus oh
[2:09:12] my do I have some more time
[2:09:14] thank you thank you I need a little more
[2:09:16] sorry
[2:09:18] I may not speak to you again
[2:09:21] I don't know how the Lord is going to
[2:09:23] lead
[2:09:24] I know God sent his servant from South
[2:09:26] Africa he's starting tomorrow night
[2:09:28] we're going to see how Night by Night
[2:09:30] how the Lord leads this may be my only
[2:09:32] chance to get my spirit free I got to
[2:09:34] get all this stuff off of my Fork
[2:09:37] because I'm not going to quit working
[2:09:39] because I'm not the one standing here
[2:09:42] I'm going to work for him and I'm going
[2:09:44] to work for brother Greeley and I'm
[2:09:45] going to work for you
[2:09:47] just as hard whether I'm standing here
[2:09:50] or not I want the shoe I feel something
[2:09:53] I think I'm by myself but I feel
[2:09:56] something
[2:09:57] I want every service to be what God
[2:10:00] wants it to be
[2:10:02] I don't care what it looks like
[2:10:04] I don't care
[2:10:06] critics say I don't care what the fans
[2:10:09] say I'm not moved by my fans I'm not
[2:10:13] moved by my credit I moved by the Holy
[2:10:17] Spirit
[2:10:18] we must be moved by the Holy Ghost
[2:10:23] [Applause]
[2:10:28] you'll never get to where God has called
[2:10:31] you to get if you get stuck in thinking
[2:10:34] that you've got to run your house
[2:10:37] your church
[2:10:38] like everybody else's Church
[2:10:42] now this the last thing brother Austin
[2:10:45] I'll just
[2:10:47] my grandmother said to me after that
[2:10:49] experience
[2:10:50] she said honey
[2:10:52] I want you to come home
[2:10:54] I want you to come home and I want you
[2:10:57] to take the church
[2:11:01] and I said granny big mama
[2:11:05] she looked Mighty tiny laying in that
[2:11:07] bed
[2:11:09] she had been my big mama all my life
[2:11:12] I said big mama God's already talking to
[2:11:15] my heart don't say no more I'm ready to
[2:11:17] come when he releases me to come
[2:11:20] I was in South Carolina at the time
[2:11:22] and she said I want you to promise me
[2:11:24] one thing
[2:11:25] she said it's not going to be easy
[2:11:28] they are going to fight you tooth and
[2:11:30] toenail and you will be tempted to leave
[2:11:33] to throw in the towel and leave because
[2:11:35] some of them that has been faithful with
[2:11:38] me
[2:11:39] will not be faithful with you
[2:11:43] she said some of them are so mad they
[2:11:46] could spit a 10 penny nail because I
[2:11:49] recognize that I wasn't called
[2:11:52] and they'll blame you
[2:11:54] remember my grandmother all those years
[2:11:56] of ministry
[2:11:58] she heard I said but big mama if he is
[2:12:01] that Elijah If he if that Spirit of
[2:12:03] power of Elijah is on him we'll have to
[2:12:05] do what he said to be right won't we yes
[2:12:07] ma'am I said but big mama the Bible said
[2:12:10] that a woman is not supposed to to
[2:12:12] handle the word of God and usurp
[2:12:13] authority over a man in that way and she
[2:12:16] said oh
[2:12:17] I never thought of it quite like that
[2:12:19] I'll never do it again
[2:12:22] you saw it you've read the testimony
[2:12:25] and so I said I will come
[2:12:28] in God's perfect timing she said I want
[2:12:30] you to promise me one thing I want you
[2:12:32] to have a church
[2:12:35] it don't have to look anything like the
[2:12:39] church that I started
[2:12:42] because I was doing God of service
[2:12:45] you're going to be in his will
[2:12:47] I want you to build a church where uh
[2:12:51] somebody can call the name of brother
[2:12:53] Branham
[2:12:54] and never be afraid
[2:12:59] that somebody is going to get their
[2:13:01] little feelings hurt and so they won't
[2:13:03] tell the whole story because they're
[2:13:06] afraid of driving somebody off or
[2:13:09] running I want you to have a church
[2:13:10] where you can call brother branham's
[2:13:12] name and give testimony and and and and
[2:13:15] let him be what God called him to be
[2:13:20] without without embarrassment Or Without
[2:13:22] Shame
[2:13:24] and I want you to have a church
[2:13:27] where people can worship God
[2:13:30] according to the dictates of their heart
[2:13:33] and nobody is going to tell them how to
[2:13:36] worship God
[2:13:39] he said as long of course as it's decent
[2:13:41] and in order
[2:13:42] she said some people may hold their
[2:13:44] hands like this some may hold them like
[2:13:46] that
[2:13:47] some may only dance when the spirit of
[2:13:49] God moves on them some may dance as a
[2:13:52] sacrifice of prayer they may just dance
[2:13:54] because they're happy
[2:13:56] but my desire for this church you don't
[2:14:00] have to make it like I had it
[2:14:03] you'll be led by the spirit but these
[2:14:06] two things I want you to do
[2:14:09] be free
[2:14:10] to call brother branham's name and let
[2:14:13] the people be free to worship God
[2:14:16] pure worship
[2:14:19] undictated
[2:14:23] we're not doing it to be seen
[2:14:26] anybody with me
[2:14:28] Dove's eyes single eye I guess I'll have
[2:14:31] to stop I don't know what I'll do
[2:14:33] because I'm not done
[2:14:36] having this Dove's eye indicates that we
[2:14:39] are becoming increasingly aware of the
[2:14:41] Lord's person and presence and that we
[2:14:43] possess a spiritual awareness that will
[2:14:45] lift us above the pulls of the Earth the
[2:14:47] single eye the single eye will enable us
[2:14:50] to become sensitive to the Lord's
[2:14:52] presence and obedience to his desires
[2:14:56] and purposes you can't call someone else
[2:15:00] into your experience
[2:15:03] I see inner sisters trying to do that
[2:15:05] sometimes
[2:15:07] you think because you've got a burden
[2:15:09] that everybody is supposed to have a
[2:15:11] burden that's not right
[2:15:13] that's subtle manipulation and it
[2:15:15] borders on witchcraft
[2:15:19] you don't model your intercession after
[2:15:22] somebody else
[2:15:23] you don't model your worship after
[2:15:25] somebody else you may be weeping but
[2:15:28] don't try to make somebody else weep
[2:15:33] I don't even know why I'm preaching the
[2:15:35] way I'm preaching now but I know it
[2:15:39] looks like I know it looks like I know
[2:15:41] we think it ought to be that we all do
[2:15:43] the same thing all the time
[2:15:45] I know that's what we think Unity is
[2:15:48] but Unity is when everybody Mary
[2:15:53] what are we gonna do
[2:15:56] we've run out of wine
[2:15:58] what are we going to do she said well
[2:16:00] honey child
[2:16:02] I don't know what to do
[2:16:05] it's not my wedding Feast I'm a guest
[2:16:08] here I tell you what whatever he tells
[2:16:11] you to do
[2:16:14] you gonna stay with me
[2:16:16] you you are or you're not getting no
[2:16:18] soup and sandwich
[2:16:21] ain't no to go plates
[2:16:24] except for seniors
[2:16:29] I don't know what I don't know what to
[2:16:30] tell you to do or out of wine yeah
[2:16:32] that's right right away but
[2:16:34] I believe this will work you go find him
[2:16:36] and whatever he tells you to do
[2:16:38] if you're around this Altar and he tells
[2:16:40] you to jump
[2:16:43] I hope you look like a kangaroo
[2:16:47] but you better jump
[2:16:51] we had a prophetic guy come here one
[2:16:53] time and he he didn't understand our
[2:16:55] jumping and he kind of made a little bit
[2:16:56] of fun he did you know he did he made a
[2:16:59] little fun called it a kangaroo anointed
[2:17:00] I don't care what you call the anointing
[2:17:02] that's on me
[2:17:05] that's your business you better be
[2:17:07] careful
[2:17:08] but that is totally up to you but if if
[2:17:10] he tells me to jump
[2:17:12] the only way for me to get wine
[2:17:16] is by jumping
[2:17:19] you may be standing right beside me and
[2:17:21] he may tell you to weep you may feel
[2:17:23] your heart breaking and you may need
[2:17:24] wine
[2:17:26] and you may only get wine you may not
[2:17:28] get wine jumping because I jump but if
[2:17:31] he breaks your heart and you begin to
[2:17:33] weep that's the way you'll get your wine
[2:17:38] he may tell somebody to walk about Zion
[2:17:42] he may not tell us all to walk about
[2:17:44] Zion but if he tells you to walk about
[2:17:46] Zion he yeah you don't have to go bring
[2:17:48] somebody else to walk with you you can't
[2:17:50] I don't I'm not trying to address those
[2:17:52] of you that have you know tried to
[2:17:54] encourage people in I understand that
[2:17:56] all together but I want you to know they
[2:17:58] can do what you do and may not get the
[2:18:00] wine
[2:18:02] the only way for us to have that wine is
[2:18:05] to do what he tells us to do and if
[2:18:07] you're worried that you're not going to
[2:18:08] know don't worry don't worry
[2:18:12] [Music]
[2:18:14] he's given us Dove's eyes
[2:18:16] single eyes we're going to learn how to
[2:18:19] lock our eyes on the bridegroom
[2:18:22] and it ain't going to matter who's
[2:18:24] having an earthquake around us
[2:18:27] somebody may be over there in the corner
[2:18:30] and they may be having a typhoon Revival
[2:18:32] they may be spinning like a tornado but
[2:18:35] you may just be standing there
[2:18:36] spiritually with your eyes locked on him
[2:18:39] and if your eyes are locked on your
[2:18:42] Dove's eyes are locked on the bridegroom
[2:18:44] you lay there right there stay right
[2:18:47] there keep your focus
[2:18:52] single eye will enable us to be
[2:18:54] sensitive the Lord's favor rests upon
[2:18:56] those who have cultivated a single eye
[2:18:58] toward him
[2:19:00] these can be easily led by him for they
[2:19:02] are close enough to see which way his
[2:19:04] eye is looking
[2:19:05] now a few few weeks ago somebody
[2:19:09] came to me and
[2:19:11] they said someone told me that they had
[2:19:15] an assignment to stand in a particular
[2:19:17] place and I don't believe in that
[2:19:20] well let me tell you something
[2:19:24] it's not your assignment
[2:19:30] God don't have to explain to you
[2:19:33] oh I don't know if that's Bible or not
[2:19:35] let me show you how how much Bible it is
[2:19:37] what about him Lord
[2:19:43] what about him Lord
[2:19:45] what about John how come how come you
[2:19:48] let him do like that
[2:19:50] Jesus said if I would that he tarry till
[2:19:52] I come which means if I decide that he
[2:19:55] does not taste natural death
[2:20:01] what business what is it to you
[2:20:07] do you know one of these days John may
[2:20:10] walk in
[2:20:15] if I would that he tarry till I come
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:20] he he might be somewhere in a cave like
[2:20:22] the mataraji
[2:20:25] he may be hiding somewhere it might have
[2:20:27] only been spiritual it might have been
[2:20:29] natural I don't know which it was so
[2:20:31] don't you try to throw another Stone
[2:20:35] but he just said if I wanted him to be
[2:20:38] alive
[2:20:40] when I get back
[2:20:44] what is it to you
[2:20:47] follow me
[2:20:49] isn't that what he said follow me
[2:20:53] if you don't understand something if
[2:20:56] you'll let me as your pastor I'm not

[2:21:06] you think you know it all I don't know
[2:21:08] at all but I will tell you this
[2:21:10] I have learned a thing or two
[2:21:14] and I didn't learn it in the seminar and
[2:21:17] I didn't learn it in the conference and
[2:21:19] I didn't learn it with a set of CDs
[2:21:22] I learned it with carpet time
[2:21:26] you see prayer is not what I do prayer
[2:21:29] is who I am
[2:21:31] and you're going to learn as a part of
[2:21:33] that bride that prayer is who you are
[2:21:37] because your eye Focus your eyes are
[2:21:39] about to be transformed a bit
[2:21:43] oh me
[2:21:47] Psalm 32 8 I will instruct thee and
[2:21:49] teach thee in the way which thou shall
[2:21:50] go I will guide thee
[2:21:54] with mine eye
[2:21:56] oh yes yes yes yes yes yes

[2:22:01] humble and harmless and Matthew 10 16
[2:22:04] why is the serpents and harmless as Dove
[2:22:06] we've got to learn some things by the
[2:22:08] spirit and I was going to read a quote
[2:22:10] there from God making his promise read
[2:22:13] it at home paragraph 34 flash it up just

[2:22:22] is a lover the dove who's in the evening
[2:22:24] there's nothing more beautiful than to
[2:22:26] hear the dove in the evening cooing the
[2:22:28] turtle dove let him cook let him cook
[2:22:30] let him go over here turn off the idiot
[2:22:33] box
[2:22:34] [Applause]
[2:22:35] and let the dove cool over you
[2:22:42] it's not just for women to be lovers
[2:22:45] it's not just for women to lay at the
[2:22:47] feet of Jesus it's not just for women to
[2:22:50] want to know his heartbeat it's not just
[2:22:53] for women to put their head on his chest
[2:22:56] so they can hear his heartbeat
[2:22:58] John was our example

[2:23:16] lock it you don't have to like my
[2:23:19] position I'm not sitting there for you
[2:23:23] I want to be as close to him
[2:23:27] what the prophet say about this desk
[2:23:29] right here

[2:23:38] John said I I know they're going to call
[2:23:41] me I know what they're going to say
[2:23:43] I know they're going to say I want the
[2:23:44] attention I know they're going to say I
[2:23:46] think I'm better than they are
[2:23:48] but I cannot afford for his heart to

[2:26:48] love
[2:26:49] and then I wanted to preach on the apple
[2:26:51] of the eye but I don't have time
[2:26:56] I'll I'll be back
[2:26:59] I'll be back sometime
[2:27:01] Sunday week if no sooner than that
[2:27:05] I want to get to the
[2:27:07] I want to talk a little bit about that
[2:27:09] Apple of the eye
[2:27:10] I want to show you that in Hebrew most
[2:27:12] of you have heard it before and you know
[2:27:14] what it means if the Lord says you know
[2:27:16] you touch the apple of my eye
[2:27:19] that's that little image it's that
[2:27:20] little little image that that appears in
[2:27:23] the pupil
[2:27:25] of what somebody's looking at
[2:27:28] did you know if you get close enough to
[2:27:29] somebody you can look at their pupil and
[2:27:32] see yourself
[2:27:36] that word in Hebrew that's exactly what
[2:27:38] it means it means the little man in the
[2:27:40] pupil of the eye
[2:27:43] in your case it might be a little woman
[2:27:45] in the people of the eye haven't we told
[2:27:47] you over and over again you become what
[2:27:48] you gaze at what you look at you become
[2:27:50] like
[2:27:52] don't you know God set us free some
[2:27:53] years ago and said you're still looking
[2:27:55] at the mirror of the law you're still
[2:27:57] seeing your shortcomings because you're
[2:27:58] looking at the law and you're not even
[2:28:00] supposed to be seeing your your blemish
[2:28:03] you're supposed to be seeing my image in
[2:28:05] the mirror not your image your image in
[2:28:07] the mirror can't change you
[2:28:09] your image is the Ugly Truth
[2:28:13] when you see the wrinkles they're there
[2:28:15] they're really there it's not a trick
[2:28:17] mirror
[2:28:18] I'm closing
[2:28:21] it's not a trick mirror we're no later
[2:28:23] than we were last night yet
[2:28:26] it's not a trick mirror it's telling you
[2:28:28] what you really look like and if you
[2:28:30] think it's going to help you to know
[2:28:34] believe me you hit double Grace 55 and I
[2:28:39] don't always need to know what I look
[2:28:40] like
[2:28:44] because sometimes there's not a whole
[2:28:46] lot you can do about it
[2:28:47] the one thing I know is I'm not going to
[2:28:50] diminish a wrinkle or turn one gray hair
[2:28:53] back to Brown by looking in the mirror
[2:28:57] you're not going to have power to change
[2:28:59] your life to set yourself free to
[2:29:02] deliver yourself to be more like him by
[2:29:05] looking at how how what reality says
[2:29:08] about your image
[2:29:09] but if you look at his image if you'll
[2:29:12] see the statue of the perfect man in the
[2:29:14] mirror if you'll see the perfect
[2:29:15] reflection of the perfect word looking
[2:29:17] back at you if when you look in the
[2:29:19] mirror you see Jesus instead of yourself
[2:29:21] you've got something to to pull up to
[2:29:23] you've got something to to reach a hold
[2:29:26] of
[2:29:29] he's the man in the mirror if you're
[2:29:32] still the man in your mirror you're
[2:29:33] going to miss this thing
[2:29:38] and how do you become the apple of his
[2:29:40] eye
[2:29:41] he's got to be looking at you
[2:29:49] and he said if they touch you
[2:29:52] they have touched the apple of my eye
[2:29:54] let me tell you what God's saying there
[2:29:56] he's saying they didn't put they're not
[2:29:58] put let me tell you something they take
[2:30:00] you apart
[2:30:02] they're touching the apple of his eye
[2:30:03] they didn't put you in God's eye
[2:30:07] he chose what to look at
[2:30:10] he chose you I'll finish this another
[2:30:13] time he chose you he'll look at you if
[2:30:15] he wants to
[2:30:16] don't matter what anybody else says if
[2:30:18] he's looking at you and you're the
[2:30:19] little man in his eye
[2:30:21] if you're the little reflection in his
[2:30:23] eye don't matter what anybody else
[2:30:24] thinks about you when they touch you
[2:30:26] they're touching him
[2:30:27] [Music]
[2:30:28] when they're condemning you they're
[2:30:30] condemning him when they're judging you
[2:30:31] they're judging him
[2:30:33] hello hello hello hello hello hello
[2:30:37] and then I'll come back and talk to you
[2:30:39] about those fish pools in heshban
[2:30:44] I spent all day today in those fish
[2:30:46] pools
[2:30:50] let me give you just this this little
[2:30:52] touch
[2:30:54] yes Lord speak we're hearing you hello
[2:31:04] thy thine eyes are like the fish pools
[2:31:06] of heshban he made an out an analogy
[2:31:10] the bride's eyes are like the fish pools
[2:31:13] of heshban
[2:31:16] you begin to do a little research don't
[2:31:18] let me do it for you then you go check
[2:31:20] me out
[2:31:23] and where are they located
[2:31:26] those fish pools in heshbon were located
[2:31:28] in the in the geographical location of
[2:31:31] the tribe of Reuben
[2:31:33] our brother was talking tonight about
[2:31:35] the tribe of Judah that's such a
[2:31:37] powerful tribe
[2:31:39] but Reuben was the firstborn of Leia
[2:31:43] and the word she cried out when when
[2:31:45] Reuben arrived
[2:31:49] she didn't say ain't everything going
[2:31:51] good
[2:31:54] she said the Lord has seen my affliction
[2:31:59] she was trapped in a painful life
[2:32:03] she knew she wasn't the first love
[2:32:07] she knew she had become a baby Factory
[2:32:09] for somebody that didn't love her like
[2:32:11] he loved the other wife
[2:32:15] even a brand new baby couldn't bring her
[2:32:17] the joy that it would bring somebody
[2:32:19] else and she cries out at the birth of
[2:32:21] Reuben the Lord has seen my affliction
[2:32:26] so Solomon is telling us
[2:32:29] if we go through the detailing we will I
[2:32:31] want to I want to share that with you
[2:32:34] we find out that Solomon is telling us
[2:32:36] that our eyes the bride's eyes are being
[2:32:40] formed
[2:32:43] by her afflictions
[2:32:48] it's it's not her joys
[2:32:51] that fixes her focus on him
[2:32:57] oh no
[2:32:58] we're swimming in the fish ponds of
[2:33:01] heshbon
[2:33:02] we're over there in the land of Reuben
[2:33:04] where our Affliction is what we see
[2:33:07] sometime
[2:33:11] you know there's some mamas that have
[2:33:13] had some babies
[2:33:14] that couldn't have the joy
[2:33:17] that other mamas had
[2:33:21] because they were born into homes where
[2:33:23] there was no peace
[2:33:27] somebody ought to think about what
[2:33:28] they're doing
[2:33:30] I know you'll be mad at me
[2:33:34] I've actually told a few people why
[2:33:37] don't you just quit having babies
[2:33:39] by someone who doesn't love you and
[2:33:41] treat you right
[2:33:44] somebody said brother Shelley that's not
[2:33:45] your decision no
[2:33:47] somebody said brother Shirley that
[2:33:48] that's not her decision wait just a
[2:33:50] minute
[2:33:54] you think a woman is nothing but a baby
[2:33:56] Factor you can take this out of the tape
[2:33:59] you think a woman's nothing but a baby
[2:34:01] Factory
[2:34:05] you think a woman in her right mind
[2:34:07] is going to keep having babies to be
[2:34:09] raised by an atheist
[2:34:16] there are some women that have had to
[2:34:17] bring some babies into this world
[2:34:19] in in hard times
[2:34:21] in Affliction everybody didn't have the
[2:34:23] joy that some of us had
[2:34:28] when we looked sometime we see this
[2:34:29] beautiful gift from God and sometimes
[2:34:32] the mama looks and she says it's just
[2:34:33] going to be so hard to raise him in the
[2:34:35] environment
[2:34:37] of our home
[2:34:39] nonetheless the Lord opens and shuts the
[2:34:42] womb
[2:34:43] and the Lord gives and takes away
[2:34:45] blessed be his name
[2:34:47] are you following me here so don't don't
[2:34:49] make a Doctrine where I didn't make one
[2:34:51] I'm just being very very honest I'm
[2:34:54] being very very honest here
[2:34:56] and there does come a time that we have
[2:34:58] to make a decision and realize that it's
[2:35:00] it's not necessarily our job to do it
[2:35:03] all
[2:35:04] right let somebody else do a little
[2:35:05] replenishing
[2:35:07] because we need to be able to
[2:35:09] spiritually
[2:35:11] emotionally and financially provide
[2:35:18] for the little lives that we bring into
[2:35:20] the world or else it's not going to be a
[2:35:23] joy for every Mama some mama's going to
[2:35:26] wonder how we're going to have enough
[2:35:27] how we're going to pay the dentist how
[2:35:29] how are we going to buy the milk how are
[2:35:31] we going to fix it come on
[2:35:34] the bride's eyes are not being formed by
[2:35:38] the joy
[2:35:41] they're not being focused and reshaped
[2:35:43] by by the pleasure
[2:35:46] they're being reshaped by the affliction
[2:35:49] somebody's been spending time in the
[2:35:52] fish ponds of heshbon
[2:35:57] and they're going to come out with a
[2:36:00] focus
[2:36:03] like never before
[2:36:05] [Music]
[2:36:06] they're going to see their bridegroom
[2:36:10] like they've never seen him before
[2:36:12] God is not going to let you suffer here
[2:36:17] and then rob you
[2:36:19] of the reward
[2:36:22] he may choose as he did for my royal
[2:36:26] jelly
[2:36:29] I
[2:36:32] spent time yesterday
[2:36:34] reading my files
[2:36:38] from Sister Weems
[2:36:41] and from Royal
[2:36:45] for years after she came here she signed
[2:36:48] every card wrote every card to my big
[2:36:51] brother
[2:36:55] older than me she was
[2:36:57] but she was calling me
[2:37:00] her big brother
[2:37:02] and as soon as I gave her that nickname
[2:37:05] royal jelly she signed them
[2:37:08] royal jelly
[2:37:10] I I had some royal jelly one time
[2:37:14] and it changed my life
[2:37:17] it's powerful stuff
[2:37:20] and I said to her you're powerful
[2:37:24] you're healing
[2:37:27] like royal jelly
[2:37:31] when you think about her life
[2:37:37] don't pity her now
[2:37:41] if you had any sympathy I hope you
[2:37:43] showed it to her
[2:37:45] when she drug her foot to get in God's
[2:37:47] house
[2:37:48] but you don't have to feel sorry for her
[2:37:51] now
[2:37:53] she's no longer swimming in the fish
[2:37:56] pond of heshbon
[2:37:58] [Applause]
[2:37:59] she'd no longer swims in the murky
[2:38:02] Waters
[2:38:05] of suffering and affliction
[2:38:08] she has the reward I wanted her to have
[2:38:12] it here
[2:38:13] but God didn't consult me he didn't ask
[2:38:17] me he didn't bother to give me a voice
[2:38:26] he said I'm going to give her the reward
[2:38:28] of her of her time in the in the
[2:38:30] Affliction I'm going to get but I'm
[2:38:32] going to do it over here
[2:38:34] and you know what I heard the Lord say
[2:38:37] because I know her story
[2:38:41] my files tell her story I know her story
[2:38:50] I know what she went through
[2:38:54] I know that every smile cost her a big
[2:38:58] price
[2:39:01] it didn't come easy
[2:39:03] it came with a price
[2:39:09] I read a letter from her accuser
[2:39:14] you may think that nobody ever had an
[2:39:17] unkind word to say to her but I want you
[2:39:19] to know I have the letters
[2:39:23] and she was called just about anything
[2:39:25] you'd want to call somebody
[2:39:31] probably shed some tears
[2:39:35] over the names that she was called
[2:39:37] but she learned
[2:39:43] Affliction is for a purpose
[2:39:45] sufferings for a reason
[2:39:49] everything gets to go in good you may
[2:39:50] forget where you come from you may
[2:39:52] forget the God who who helped you the
[2:39:54] way you may forget the goodness of God
[2:39:56] you may forget you may forget
[2:40:04] musicians are coming Jacob wrestled
[2:40:09] with the Lord
[2:40:11] God dislocated his hip
[2:40:14] the Jews today will not eat a piece of
[2:40:17] meat
[2:40:18] that is not
[2:40:20] cut by a kosher
[2:40:23] butcher
[2:40:25] because they refused to eat the hollow
[2:40:27] of his hip
[2:40:29] they won't eat they're careful even with
[2:40:32] the loin of a loin of beef
[2:40:35] because they don't want to eat a piece
[2:40:37] of meat that may have rubbed up against
[2:40:39] the hip
[2:40:42] of the cow because they remember
[2:40:47] that Jacob had a Revival
[2:40:53] had a Revival he had a meeting with god
[2:40:56] oh I tell you what I wish some of us
[2:40:59] would have a Revival like Jacob had
[2:41:04] you get up from that kind of a Revival
[2:41:07] wrestling with the angel of the lord
[2:41:09] your hip dislocated by the angel of the
[2:41:12] Lord and you know what it never did get
[2:41:15] right
[2:41:18] he was never the same
[2:41:20] God changed him
[2:41:23] he spent some time down there in Reuben
[2:41:30] affliction
[2:41:34] never walked right after
[2:41:36] we can spiritualize that all day long it
[2:41:40] was it was a spiritual transformation it
[2:41:43] was a limp
[2:41:44] to remind him
[2:41:46] of his meeting with God
[2:41:51] sometimes God just leaves enough of the
[2:41:55] scar
[2:42:00] to always remind us
[2:42:04] what it's like to meet him
[2:42:08] I'm refraining there's so much more I'd
[2:42:11] like to say right here but it gets a
[2:42:13] little too personal
[2:42:16] may God encounter us this week
[2:42:21] may he grab a hold of us and we grab a
[2:42:23] hold of him may it not just be that that
[2:42:26] he's our beloved but may we recognize I
[2:42:29] am my beloveds
[2:42:31] and my beloved is mine
[2:42:34] my my wedding ring costs 3.33
[2:42:41] for ten
[2:42:43] it's all I've needed
[2:42:46] I might have another one one day
[2:42:49] but if this one has kept me married
[2:42:53] I'm closing
[2:42:55] I never never had to take it off
[2:42:58] to hide the fact I was married in fact
[2:43:01] the only reason why I ever put it on in
[2:43:03] the first place
[2:43:06] is because I was doing some preaching
[2:43:08] and speaking among non-message people
[2:43:10] and the and the old divorced women
[2:43:14] kept hitting on me
[2:43:18] I know you can't imagine that
[2:43:21] I mean I know it grosses you out
[2:43:25] and I was in at the Ramon crater in
[2:43:27] Jerusalem and a young beautiful
[2:43:28] prostitute come up to me
[2:43:31] and she asked me if I wanted a date
[2:43:34] and I said lady I'm married she said
[2:43:36] well you didn't have on a wedding ring
[2:43:38] and I thought to myself I bet the next
[2:43:40] time you see me I'll have one on
[2:43:45] so I went down to a little Arab shop and
[2:43:47] I was able to get uh
[2:43:49] I I just can't I'm going to Israel the
[2:43:52] last of this month
[2:43:53] for a few days God willing and I I was
[2:43:56] just reminiscing the other night with
[2:43:58] the family sitting around I wonder what
[2:44:00] my Arab friends be there
[2:44:04] I've not been in 11 years
[2:44:08] almost 12.
[2:44:10] crazy how time flies I wonder will my
[2:44:14] well my Falafel man still be in the same
[2:44:16] spot
[2:44:18] you know you start having these thoughts
[2:44:22] and it says on here my beloved is mine
[2:44:25] in Hebrew
[2:44:27] and I'm his
[2:44:29] I want you to have that revelation
[2:44:33] you think he's beautiful how many of you
[2:44:35] think the Lord's beautiful
[2:44:37] let me tell you something folks
[2:44:40] he thinks that you are
[2:44:42] all together lovely
[2:44:45] he thinks you're the most beautiful
[2:44:46] thing he's ever seen in his his whole
[2:44:49] existence
[2:44:51] my beloved is mine sometimes I say
[2:44:54] You're Beautiful Jesus and and a man a
[2:44:56] big Macho bulky man big you know
[2:44:59] bow-legged man that really thought he
[2:45:02] was you know on a testosterone High
[2:45:07] he said to me don't you feel
[2:45:10] when you're saying
[2:45:12] Beautiful Jesus I said no I don't
[2:45:16] and the only reason why you do is you've
[2:45:19] never seen him because if you ever get a
[2:45:22] glimpse
[2:45:24] [Music]
[2:45:26] if you ever get a glimpse you'll think
[2:45:28] that's the most beautiful he's the most
[2:45:30] beautiful there's nobody that can
[2:45:32] compare there's nothing that compares to
[2:45:35] the beauty of the Lord and every time I
[2:45:38] tell him that do you know he longs to
[2:45:40] tell me
[2:45:44] I don't see your Dunlap
[2:45:47] I don't see a wrinkle you're beautiful
[2:45:50] to me
[2:45:53] how could he say that because it's his
[2:45:55] Beauty
[2:45:57] it's his beauty that makes you beautiful
[2:46:00] let's stand
[2:46:04] 9 42 yeah I went longer
[2:46:07] Joshua you were right I did
[2:46:17] part two will follow eventually
[2:46:23] I uh
[2:46:25] I I spent all day
[2:46:27] with him
[2:46:30] and uh
[2:46:33] well there's just nobody better he he's
[2:46:35] the best company
[2:46:37] I love my wife I love my children I love
[2:46:40] my family I'd rather be with my family
[2:46:42] than anything I can think of
[2:46:46] I love to eat with them I I even like it
[2:46:49] sometime when they bicker but my wife
[2:46:51] don't
[2:46:55] makes her nervous it only makes me
[2:46:57] nervous when they raise their voices
[2:46:59] but sometimes when they're just going at
[2:47:01] one another
[2:47:03] all in love because
[2:47:05] how do you know because it always ends
[2:47:07] okay
[2:47:08] the next day sometime but it's always
[2:47:10] okay
[2:47:11] and sometimes I just sit right in the
[2:47:13] middle then I think I'm the most blessed
[2:47:15] man Lord Jesus
[2:47:18] when I came to pastor this church I
[2:47:21] didn't think I would ever have a wife
[2:47:25] I told you that we're here in the
[2:47:27] beginning I let me love your children
[2:47:32] because I don't know if I'll ever have
[2:47:34] any children of my own
[2:47:40] so I loved the ones we had
[2:47:43] and God gave me
[2:47:46] a wife
[2:47:48] to love me
[2:47:50] and for children to love me and me to
[2:47:53] love and I love being with them
[2:47:58] even when they
[2:48:00] pick the peas out of the rice
[2:48:06] but I'd rather spend time
[2:48:09] in his presence with him Whispering on
[2:48:13] my shoulder
[2:48:14] than anything I can think of
[2:48:17] and I was sitting in the recliner today
[2:48:19] by myself going over this putting this
[2:48:22] together for tonight
[2:48:25] and I saw an open vision
[2:48:28] and what I saw before me I knew exactly
[2:48:32] what it was
[2:48:34] it was the image
[2:48:37] of the broken
[2:48:40] pieces
[2:48:42] of a kaleidoscope
[2:48:48] if you've ever picked a kaleidoscope
[2:48:49] oven and looked in it you see those
[2:48:52] little fractals those little broken
[2:48:55] pieces of glass
[2:48:58] that look chaotic
[2:49:01] it looks like just a mess
[2:49:04] but I saw open eye those little
[2:49:07] fractiles just lay it you know just
[2:49:10] laying in a little pile
[2:49:13] I didn't physically pick up my hand but
[2:49:15] I saw I saw the picture
[2:49:22] as it got clearer and clearer and
[2:49:24] clearer and every little piece of glass
[2:49:26] went to his piece of glass every little
[2:49:28] design every color found its color and
[2:49:30] the next thing I know
[2:49:34] it had been focused what do you call it
[2:49:37] I don't know focused enough
[2:49:39] that a beautiful picture was there and
[2:49:42] the Lord said it was there all the time
[2:49:47] he said now that's what I'm going to do
[2:49:50] for my bride
[2:49:53] I'm going to reform her eyes I'm going
[2:49:55] to reshape her eyes I'm not going to let
[2:49:58] her afflictions be wasted I'm not going
[2:50:00] to let her trials like God talk to you
[2:50:03] about your loneliness last night I'm not
[2:50:05] going to let her loneliness be wasted I
[2:50:07] am reforming I am reshaping I am
[2:50:09] remolding her eyes I'm going to give her
[2:50:11] a clearer vision I'm going to let her
[2:50:14] see more clearly than she's ever seen
[2:50:16] before what has looked like chaos to her
[2:50:18] what has looked like confusion to her
[2:50:20] what has looked like a mess to her is
[2:50:22] going to begin to find a clearer pattern
[2:50:26] and a and a picture is going to be made
[2:50:28] clear
[2:50:34] foreign
[2:50:45] Lord focus our eyes
[2:50:49] we don't want to waste we don't want to
[2:50:51] waste not one trial not one heartache
[2:50:53] what you're going hear me
[2:50:56] what you're going through right now is
[2:50:57] not in vain
[2:51:00] this long year what you've been through
[2:51:03] some of you that came here from other
[2:51:05] places you've been here a little over a
[2:51:07] year some of you are just now getting
[2:51:09] here it's not all been easy for you

[2:51:18] hard leaving your family behind it's
[2:51:20] hard leaving your friends behind coming
[2:51:23] to a new place and I don't I don't I
[2:51:26] can't help it that God chose to send you
[2:51:28] to such a strange place as this
[2:51:33] but I know that it's not all been easy
[2:51:35] for you but I want you to know the same
[2:51:37] promise as yours you're a part of this
[2:51:40] body now it is not in vain
[2:51:44] you're squeezing your difficulty your
[2:51:47] Clash it is not in vain
[2:51:50] God is surely doing the same thing for
[2:51:53] you that he's doing he's using the years
[2:51:55] of your Affliction he's using the things
[2:51:57] that you have been through
[2:51:59] to refocus
[2:52:04] he's good
[2:52:07] would you raise up your hands
[2:52:10] and ask him
[2:52:12] to transform your vision
[2:52:17] to give you Dove eyes
[2:52:20] to give you single vision

[2:52:37] that I can see you in the storm I can

[3:00:42] Lord I want to thank you I want to thank
[3:00:44] you
[3:00:46] I want to thank you for how you brought
[3:00:48] me through
[3:00:50] can you see his faithfulness
[3:00:53] can you see that there was only one set
[3:00:56] of footprints in the sand
[3:01:01] when you thought you were by yourself
[3:01:03] when you thought nobody knew
[3:01:07] when you thought you'd been left alone
[3:01:09] and you needed him the most
[3:01:12] you saw that one set of footprints and
[3:01:14] thought they were yours
[3:01:16] let him show you tonight let him
[3:01:19] re-fashion your eyes let the bride's
[3:01:21] eyes be refashioned tonight
[3:01:25] and let him show you those were his
[3:01:26] footprints
[3:01:28] how is that possible he had you on his
[3:01:31] back they picked you up like a sack of
[3:01:34] taters
[3:01:36] Drew you up to his own body and held you
[3:01:41] [Music]
[3:01:42] that's his love for you
[3:01:45] [Music]
[3:01:49] even in that hour when you stepped out
[3:01:52] of his will and you stepped out of his
[3:01:54] way he didn't leave you

[3:02:49] of espousing you to me
[3:02:52] [Music]

[3:02:59] that it's me you need
[3:03:01] nor my gift nor my hand nor my oil

[3:03:11] I want you to know that the one who
