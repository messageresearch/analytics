[25:08] [Music]
[25:12] i surrender to the kings
[25:15] [Music]
[25:30] i just want to read you this quote
[25:32] most of you get the text and you heard
[25:34] it but i want you to understand
[25:37] what we mean when we sing let the
[25:39] worshipers arise
[25:42] there is an authority
[25:44] in the bride of christ
[25:46] that the church at large does not have
[25:50] she doesn't have that same authority
[25:53] she doesn't have his heart like you do
[25:55] and his ear like you do not in this hour
[25:59] but this is what the prophet said he
[26:01] said now sons and daughters
[26:04] who has the most power before god
[26:07] what is an angel
[26:09] an angel is a servant that's right that
[26:12] right
[26:13] he said they're his servants what are
[26:15] you
[26:16] his son
[26:17] and daughter
[26:19] who has the most power in heaven then a
[26:22] sinner that's been saved by grace or an
[26:25] archangel that's standing by his right
[26:28] side
[26:30] the sinner
[26:33] the sinner
[26:34] that's been saved by grace has more
[26:39] authority in heaven
[26:41] [Music]
[26:44] oh
[26:46] hallelujah
[26:48] the sinner that's been saved by grace
[26:51] has more authority in heaven than the
[26:53] archangel that stood by his side without
[26:57] sin
[26:58] because he's a son
[27:01] son
[27:02] has more authority than a servant of
[27:05] course so when you come into his
[27:08] presence to praise him
[27:10] you don't come as a beggar
[27:13] you don't come as just a servant you
[27:16] have a special invitation as one of his
[27:20] sons to come before him and worship him

[28:12] frizzy hair and jewels and all that
[28:15] stuff hanging on her on them and they
[28:18] didn't find favor but esther she asked
[28:21] the servant she asked the chamberlain of
[28:24] the king what must i do
[28:28] what can i do to gain his favor
[28:31] oh let me tell you something little

[38:55] and off with her head
[38:58] she risked her life
[39:01] to come before the king
[39:04] for her children
[39:06] for her grandchildren
[39:08] for all the generations of israel
[39:11] we owe that little woman
[39:14] don't you forget

[39:24] for her people
[39:27] for the salvation of her people other
[39:29] women
[39:30] like we sing in the great speckled bird
[39:33] all the other churches are against her
[39:36] they envy her glory and her fame
[39:39] they seek to find fault with the
[39:41] prophet's teachings but theologians find
[39:44] no mistake
[39:44] [Music]
[39:47] vashti
[39:48] and all the other women
[39:51] all the other candidates
[39:53] they found fault with esther
[39:57] brother branham sometimes talked about
[39:59] the jews he called them hook nosed jews
[40:02] which today would be a very very
[40:04] detrimental thing to say a very very
[40:06] rude thing to say but in his generation
[40:10] he just wanted you to know they didn't
[40:12] come esther didn't come with her beauty
[40:16] it wouldn't have been enough
[40:18] she came dressed
[40:20] in the word for her hour
[40:23] the word for her hour her holy ghost had
[40:26] helped her get dressed
[40:28] and get ready
[40:30] i want you to just tell the lord one
[40:31] more time i'm standing for my children

[40:59] to cry out for your generations
[41:03] for our children and our grandchildren
[41:05] our great-grandchildren
[41:08] as many as the lord our god will call

[1:06:21] you may say there's your bed
[1:06:24] and uh but anyway
[1:06:26] god is good we couldn't have gotten as
[1:06:28] far as we have in the remodel of moss
[1:06:31] place and i tell you she would be so
[1:06:34] happy every time i go in there i i can
[1:06:37] just hear her i can hear her voice and
[1:06:40] in my heart and i can hear her say
[1:06:42] uh
[1:06:43] two things one i didn't know this place
[1:06:46] could look so good two why didn't you do
[1:06:49] this for me
[1:06:51] [Laughter]
[1:06:53] but everybody knows if it was going to
[1:06:55] be done for anybody else other than her
[1:06:59] or maybe me
[1:07:01] uh benjamin was uh
[1:07:04] he was the first grandson and
[1:07:07] and she didn't always uh she didn't
[1:07:09] always uh
[1:07:10] make them all feel equal but uh
[1:07:13] she loved them all i know that
[1:07:16] i know that it would be uh special to
[1:07:18] her to know that that they're going to
[1:07:20] be starting their life there
[1:07:22] and uh it couldn't be would not have
[1:07:23] been possible if if
[1:07:25] we hadn't had some real help and we
[1:07:27] appreciate it very very much
[1:07:30] some of the young brothers have really
[1:07:32] spent hours and hours and hours and
[1:07:35] hours and hours and hours and hours and
[1:07:37] that's not an exaggeration
[1:07:39] i'm asking god to bless them abundantly
[1:07:42] i'm so thankful that they don't work by
[1:07:44] the hour
[1:07:47] i'm asking god to pay them even better
[1:07:49] than the hour
[1:07:50] and there are many i'm not calling names
[1:07:52] because there's many that have done some
[1:07:55] things but there are a couple of
[1:07:57] brothers who have been there
[1:07:59] all the time just about and i really
[1:08:02] really do appreciate that
[1:08:03] i feel like i've already had more to say
[1:08:06] in the service than anybody else and
[1:08:08] it's my turn again but i just couldn't
[1:08:10] help myself i couldn't really couldn't
[1:08:12] help myself because i think sometimes we
[1:08:15] forget what worship is supposed to be
[1:08:17] about not not you folks so much
[1:08:20] but i i just think it's important to
[1:08:22] remember that it's it's not just
[1:08:25] to make him feel good
[1:08:27] you know it it's it's for us
[1:08:31] it's to get in that presence
[1:08:33] and be changed
[1:08:35] i i heard brother branham say just
[1:08:37] recently in a sermon that there's
[1:08:39] nothing like being in that presence of
[1:08:42] god
[1:08:43] because
[1:08:44] your spiritual cells just soak it in
[1:08:48] like a sponge
[1:08:50] and
[1:08:51] when you get in trouble or you have
[1:08:53] problems or something that that strength
[1:08:55] that you that you gleaned in
[1:08:59] soaked in it's there residually on a
[1:09:03] monday morning when you don't want to
[1:09:05] get up and and on a tuesday when things
[1:09:08] aren't going good on the job and a
[1:09:10] wednesday when the children are about to
[1:09:13] run you crazy
[1:09:15] and come on and on a thursday when
[1:09:18] you've got a bunch of workers that have
[1:09:20] called out
[1:09:21] no matter what your situation or a
[1:09:24] school teacher we've got a few teachers
[1:09:26] here and uh when they come back after a
[1:09:29] long weekend and they act like they've
[1:09:31] had sugar the whole time they were gone
[1:09:33] and there and you've got to try to bring
[1:09:35] them to some kind of a place where you
[1:09:37] can help them i'm so thankful so
[1:09:40] thankful that we are not wasting our
[1:09:43] time when we come and soak in his
[1:09:46] presence can you say amen well let me
[1:09:49] make these announcements really quick
[1:09:51] this tuesday night no excuses accepted
[1:09:58] well brother
[1:10:01] maybe
[1:10:03] i might accept an excuse for someone who
[1:10:05] lives four hours away brother reed i
[1:10:07] would i think that's a good excuse
[1:10:10] but most of us don't live four hours
[1:10:12] away
[1:10:14] uh
[1:10:15] by the way i don't i haven't done this
[1:10:17] i've not said a whole lot about it
[1:10:20] but i uh
[1:10:22] i would like to mention that today is
[1:10:25] brother reed's 12th weekend with us
[1:10:29] in a row
[1:10:30] driving nearly four hours one way to get
[1:10:32] here i think that's just a blessing i
[1:10:34] appreciate it i really appreciate it
[1:10:42] we've become very quick friends and he
[1:10:44] means a lot to me and he does to my
[1:10:46] family and we are just very very
[1:10:49] thankful that he finds something among
[1:10:53] us
[1:10:53] we know what it is
[1:10:55] i'm sorry to tell you it's not you and i
[1:10:58] it's his presence it's the fact that
[1:11:01] he's here
[1:11:02] i will let brother reed slide tuesday
[1:11:04] night as long as i can tell that he's
[1:11:05] streaming but the rest of you please try
[1:11:08] to come we don't have a special speaker

[1:19:26] we eat the most amazing cookies for
[1:19:28] purim but we try to remember you got
[1:19:31] your your little bit of a rehearsal this
[1:19:33] morning it's one of the most wonderful
[1:19:35] stories
[1:19:36] god has been so good
[1:19:38] he has been so good to preserve his
[1:19:41] people
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:43] i want you to know that every just about
[1:19:45] every other day a group of ukrainian
[1:19:48] jews are coming out
[1:19:51] and landing in the homeland
[1:19:54] oh hallelujah
[1:19:56] if you saw my little live on on whenever
[1:19:59] it was this week i mentioned something a
[1:20:02] friend of mine was in israel and staying
[1:20:05] at a five-star hotel on on the on the
[1:20:08] sea on excuse me in tel aviv on the
[1:20:11] mediterranean
[1:20:12] and it's a beautiful beach i'm telling
[1:20:14] you it's a beautiful place and got a
[1:20:16] notification and said i'm so sorry to
[1:20:18] tell you your room is canceled because
[1:20:22] we're giving your room to refugees from
[1:20:25] the ukraine
[1:20:27] five-star hotel and my friend was
[1:20:30] delighted he doesn't have to have it
[1:20:32] he's delighted and he said what country
[1:20:35] do you know of gives a refugee from
[1:20:37] another country a five-star hotel on the
[1:20:40] beach
[1:20:41] there's no land like the homeland
[1:20:44] that's right
[1:20:45] god
[1:20:46] has certainly kept his word
[1:20:48] in the nation of israel
[1:20:50] i told brother farmer that's what we
[1:20:52] were talking about
[1:20:54] i told him
[1:20:55] those people who come there many of them
[1:20:58] planned to be there temporarily
[1:21:01] but they don't know what to expect
[1:21:04] when they get there they're going to be
[1:21:05] treated with so many different things
[1:21:08] blessed with so many gifts
[1:21:10] provided everything they have need to
[1:21:13] start their new life
[1:21:15] in israel
[1:21:16] the israeli government has no intention
[1:21:18] of of encouraging them to go back to the
[1:21:21] ukraine because some of them understand
[1:21:23] the importance of the jew being in the
[1:21:25] homeland
[1:21:26] and they're going to give them
[1:21:28] everything they can get their hands on
[1:21:30] they're going to immediately enroll them
[1:21:32] in a free hebrew school
[1:21:35] they can do that within the first few
[1:21:36] days of being there if you want to know
[1:21:38] the home language you you there you go
[1:21:41] and they're going to help them with
[1:21:43] leasing a piece of property to live in
[1:21:45] and and all kinds of things and this
[1:21:48] this blessing goes on for years
[1:21:50] when they're able to buy their first
[1:21:52] automobile all the taxes are
[1:21:55] are stricken off they owe no taxes to
[1:21:57] the government anything the government
[1:21:59] can do to help them get settled in the
[1:22:01] land and you may have seen the pictures
[1:22:03] that i saw this week of ukrainian jews
[1:22:07] that have never been to israel before
[1:22:10] oh i can't help myself
[1:22:15] i i can't help myself
[1:22:17] you you think about putin and all of his
[1:22:20] evil deeds
[1:22:22] and uh you got charismaniacs
[1:22:25] praying this and that and the other and
[1:22:27] they don't even know what they're
[1:22:29] praying
[1:22:30] don't even know what they're calling on
[1:22:33] you just ought to hold your peace
[1:22:35] and you ought to say thy kingdom come
[1:22:37] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:22:40] heaven
[1:22:41] because whether you realize it or not
[1:22:43] the prophet of the old testament said
[1:22:46] the the fishers will come and the
[1:22:49] hunters will come
[1:22:51] and god sent theodore herzl as a fisher
[1:22:55] in the late 1800s
[1:22:57] to start the zionism movement to beg the
[1:23:00] jews to encourage the jews it was the
[1:23:03] beginning of the of the calling in the
[1:23:06] aliyah of the diaspora the scattering of
[1:23:10] the jews were now being gathered in and
[1:23:13] herzl never lived to see the
[1:23:16] establishment of the nation
[1:23:18] but his desire was to be buried in the
[1:23:21] land and he helped encourage hundreds
[1:23:24] and thousands of jews to go home and i
[1:23:27] particularly enjoy standing over his
[1:23:29] grave and thanking him every time i'm
[1:23:32] there thank you sir
[1:23:34] for having a vision to fulfill scripture
[1:23:37] but many didn't come by the fishers are
[1:23:40] you with me
[1:23:41] i'm preaching and i haven't taken the
[1:23:42] text
[1:23:43] many didn't come by the fishermen so the
[1:23:46] hunters had to come and a stalin came on
[1:23:49] the scene and a hitler came on the scene
[1:23:52] and what the fishers couldn't do the
[1:23:54] hunters began to drive them in by the
[1:23:56] thousands
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:59] hallelujah and now we live in such an
[1:24:02] hour that in many nations the jews have
[1:24:04] such a very comfortable life
[1:24:07] and it takes a stirring sometime
[1:24:10] takes a stirring sometime i don't like
[1:24:13] war and i don't like what it's doing and
[1:24:15] my heart is wept and my wife and i have
[1:24:18] cried looking at the pictures of those
[1:24:22] old people who ought to be
[1:24:24] treated well and fed well and given
[1:24:28] safety and there they're climbing across
[1:24:31] those boards to try to get across a
[1:24:33] river to get out of ukraine and to get
[1:24:36] into poland and it breaks your heart uh
[1:24:39] to hear of their deaths and children and
[1:24:43] all of this stuff and you've got these
[1:24:45] crazy people on social media who think
[1:24:48] they know so much
[1:24:50] they think they know what it's all about
[1:24:52] and they have no clue what it's all
[1:24:54] about but god does
[1:24:57] god knows what it's about and when i saw
[1:25:00] them this week getting off an ll
[1:25:03] a plane which is an experience in itself
[1:25:06] and walking across that floor and
[1:25:09] getting down
[1:25:10] old people and young ones alike getting
[1:25:14] down and kissing the dirty floor and
[1:25:16] thanking god for making a way for them
[1:25:19] to come home
[1:25:21] my heart cannot help but thrill and i
[1:25:24] have to say god you are faithful to your
[1:25:28] word you said i will give them a land
[1:25:32] and i will gather them in from the four
[1:25:35] corners of the earth don't lose the big
[1:25:38] picture church
[1:25:40] god is fulfilling his word
[1:25:44] hallelujah
[1:25:45] hallelujah so get you some
[1:25:48] some
[1:25:49] haman's ears
[1:25:50] and celebrate what god
[1:25:53] has done
[1:25:54] read the story
[1:25:56] of esther
[1:25:58] the megillah read it to your children
[1:26:01] and
[1:26:02] boo
[1:26:03] like the jews do when haman's name is
[1:26:06] mentioned and when mordechai
[1:26:08] and esther's name is called you cheer
[1:26:11] yay
[1:26:13] somebody said you want us to act like
[1:26:15] little children or something
[1:26:17] i don't mind
[1:26:19] i don't mind
[1:26:20] i'm closer to the second childhood than
[1:26:22] the first one probably but i don't mind
[1:26:25] it thrills me to know
[1:26:27] that god has been so faithful
[1:26:30] and then beginning on thursday of this
[1:26:32] week
[1:26:33] you will remember that it is the
[1:26:35] anniversary of the preaching of the
[1:26:37] seven seals
[1:26:39] you may not have an opportunity over
[1:26:41] that week to hear those
[1:26:44] sermons but choose one
[1:26:46] if you can't get them all in around the
[1:26:49] table
[1:26:50] get one choose one of the seals
[1:26:53] and and make a special effort to hear it
[1:26:57] in in the anniversary week and if you've
[1:27:01] got uh running low on things to praise
[1:27:04] god for praise him that his word is open
[1:27:07] praise him that he kept his word and
[1:27:10] opened up those seals
[1:27:12] bible becoming a new book so that you
[1:27:15] and i can know who we are
[1:27:17] it changed things
[1:27:19] it didn't only explain the symbols of
[1:27:22] the scripture it changed the symbols of
[1:27:24] the scripture somebody said what the
[1:27:26] world do you mean it caused things to
[1:27:28] mean something entirely different than
[1:27:31] what people thought it meant
[1:27:33] because they were interpreting it by by
[1:27:35] some natural skill but boy when that
[1:27:38] word even brother branham could have
[1:27:40] easily made a mistake he said i was
[1:27:43] about to make the biggest mistake of my
[1:27:45] life he was going to put jesus on the
[1:27:47] white horse like he had done he said i
[1:27:49] preached it all one time years before
[1:27:51] and i put jesus on the white horse
[1:27:54] but he said that wasn't that was the
[1:27:55] antichrist

[1:32:46] some of their time to help us worship
[1:32:49] the lord here and to be a part of what
[1:32:52] god is doing
[1:32:54] i struggled to know his mind i've had so
[1:32:56] much fun preaching about joy
[1:32:59] and i need to move on to something else
[1:33:02] i had some things in my heart and
[1:33:04] thought i would get to them but
[1:33:06] it was not until i
[1:33:08] began to set my i've studied i studied
[1:33:11] all day friday i studied mostly all day
[1:33:14] yesterday
[1:33:15] but it was real i went to bed last night
[1:33:18] still not knowing exactly where to go
[1:33:22] i knew
[1:33:23] something that i would bring but i
[1:33:25] didn't know exactly where to start
[1:33:28] i was troubled in the night about it i
[1:33:30] lord give me peace show me exactly what
[1:33:33] to do
[1:33:34] my family was offering suggestions
[1:33:38] aren't they wonderful

[1:33:42] i said i well i got about a one hour
[1:33:44] sermon and a three hour sermon i should
[1:33:47] tell you mariah suggested the one hour
[1:33:49] sermon
[1:33:54] that don't surprise you does it
[1:33:57] but anyway
[1:33:59] uh
[1:34:00] one of the many many many many times i
[1:34:03] woke up
[1:34:04] singing a song
[1:34:08] and through the night it seemed like it
[1:34:10] was just running over and over and over
[1:34:12] and i've got to get it because it's not
[1:34:14] a song i've ever sung before
[1:34:16] i've seen too many
[1:34:19] victories
[1:34:20] it's just been played a lot on the on
[1:34:22] the satellite radio
[1:34:24] i've seen too many victories to let
[1:34:27] defeat
[1:34:28] have the last word
[1:34:30] crazy
[1:34:33] i just kept hearing that song lyric over
[1:34:35] and over and over again i've seen too
[1:34:36] many victories
[1:34:38] to let defeat have the last word
[1:34:40] seen too many victories to let defeat
[1:34:43] have a lie i said that's good that'll
[1:34:44] preach that'll preach right there but
[1:34:47] that's not what i'm going to preach
[1:34:48] about
[1:34:50] then i went back and slept a while
[1:34:52] got up and went out and come back and i
[1:34:55] went to start the doors off again and i
[1:34:58] heard a voice say send judah first
[1:35:01] i said yes lord send judah first
[1:35:05] that's what i want to do is make sure my
[1:35:08] praise goes ahead of me into every
[1:35:10] battle
[1:35:12] come on now and so i'm going to preach
[1:35:15] right now
[1:35:16] on this morning i'm going to begin on
[1:35:18] the preeminence of praise
[1:35:20] send judah first
[1:35:23] i want to read in luke chapter 19
[1:35:26] beginning in verse 28 and read all the
[1:35:28] way to 40.
[1:35:30] that's a lot of verses but i want to get
[1:35:31] them out and when he had thus spoken he
[1:35:34] went before ascending up to jerusalem
[1:35:38] and it came to pass when he was come
[1:35:40] nigh to beth fage
[1:35:42] and bethany at the mount called the
[1:35:45] mount of olives he sent two of his
[1:35:49] disciples
[1:35:51] saying go ye into the village over
[1:35:54] against you
[1:35:55] in the which at your entering you shall
[1:35:58] find the cult tithe whereon you never
[1:36:02] yet never man sat loose him
[1:36:05] and bring him hither
[1:36:08] and if any man ask you why do you loose
[1:36:10] him thus shall ye say unto him because
[1:36:13] the lord hath need of him i like that
[1:36:17] and they that were sent went their way
[1:36:20] and found even as he had said
[1:36:24] unto them no surprise there is there
[1:36:28] and as they were loosing the coat the
[1:36:31] owners thereof said unto them why lucy
[1:36:34] the colt i guess they had a right to ask
[1:36:36] didn't they since it belonged to them
[1:36:39] and they said the lord hath need of him
[1:36:43] and they brought him to jesus and they
[1:36:46] cast their garments upon the colt and
[1:36:49] they set jesus there on
[1:36:51] and as he went they spread their clothes
[1:36:54] in the way
[1:36:56] and when he was come nigh even now at
[1:36:59] the descent of the mount of olives
[1:37:01] the whole multitude of the disciples
[1:37:04] began to rejoice
[1:37:06] and praise god with a loud voice
[1:37:11] anybody with me
[1:37:13] for all the mighty works
[1:37:16] that they had seen
[1:37:19] saying blessed be the king
[1:37:24] baruch haba basha
[1:37:27] baruch baruch
[1:37:30] uh oh my baruch atta adonai
[1:37:34] it slipped my mind blessed be the king
[1:37:37] that cometh in the name of the lord in
[1:37:40] the name of the lord beshem adonai peace
[1:37:44] in heaven
[1:37:45] and glory
[1:37:47] in the highest
[1:37:49] and some of the pharisees from among the
[1:37:52] multitude said unto him master
[1:37:55] rebuke
[1:37:57] thy
[1:37:57] disciples
[1:38:00] i want to have a little fun with this
[1:38:03] are you with me
[1:38:06] somebody from the cold formal church
[1:38:10] the first church of the message
[1:38:14] yes that's what we used to say first
[1:38:17] baptist church
[1:38:19] i just heard brother branham say this
[1:38:21] yesterday
[1:38:23] he said it used to be that we said as
[1:38:25] cold and formal as the baptist church
[1:38:29] but he said now we have to say as cold
[1:38:31] and formal as the pentecostal church
[1:38:35] and you know what we have to say now
[1:38:37] as cold and formal as some message
[1:38:39] churches
[1:38:41] and they begin to rebuke mat correct the
[1:38:44] master
[1:38:45] telling him why don't you tell your
[1:38:47] disciples to hold their peace
[1:38:50] master rebuke thy disciples
[1:38:53] and he answered and said unto them i
[1:38:55] tell you that
[1:38:56] if these should hold their peace
[1:39:01] i can tell them if that's really what
[1:39:03] you want
[1:39:04] i can tell them to be quiet but i need
[1:39:07] to let you know that if these should
[1:39:10] hold their peace the stones
[1:39:14] would
[1:39:14] immediately
[1:39:16] cry out
[1:39:18] i want somebody to say ain't no stone
[1:39:20] going to cry out in my place
[1:39:23] no rock is going to thank him for me
[1:39:27] i'm going to live my voice as long as i
[1:39:30] have a voice and glorify the god of all
[1:39:33] eternity

[1:40:05] this week and he howls and accuses we're
[1:40:09] going to need a little something to use
[1:40:11] against him so i pray lord that you will
[1:40:14] provide that in your word today that

[1:40:40] the bible said the trees of the fields
[1:40:46] cup their hands
[1:40:50] the bible tells us that the sun
[1:40:53] and the moon and the stars are giving
[1:40:56] god continual praise
[1:40:59] when you're asleep and you're tired and
[1:41:02] you're dreaming of being on a beach
[1:41:04] somewhere or in the mountains in a
[1:41:06] chalet somewhere and you're you're just
[1:41:10] enjoying yourself without even a thought
[1:41:13] of praise outside whether you can see
[1:41:16] them because of the clouds or not the
[1:41:19] stars are twinkling their praise and
[1:41:23] sending it to their creator the sun is
[1:41:26] giving its creator glory are you with me
[1:41:30] and the moon is reflecting the light of
[1:41:33] god's creation the sun so designed by
[1:41:37] god
[1:41:38] i know it's loud out there plenty but i
[1:41:40] need a little more in this monitor if
[1:41:41] you will please
[1:41:43] so designed by god to carry no light of
[1:41:47] its own but to be a mirror to be a
[1:41:50] reflection there you are little bride
[1:41:53] there you are
[1:41:55] god didn't place a light in you at your
[1:41:58] birth
[1:41:59] but he filled you with a light
[1:42:01] and you are a reflection of that light
[1:42:05] that little bride is glistening out
[1:42:07] across the night sky
[1:42:09] reflecting i tell you when it when the
[1:42:12] moon starts getting full
[1:42:14] i don't need a nightlight i don't need
[1:42:17] any help getting to the washroom in the
[1:42:19] middle of the night because i've got a
[1:42:22] little uh folding a little folding
[1:42:24] shutter on the bathroom window and a
[1:42:27] little drape at the top there's a little
[1:42:29] bit of a gap about there across the top
[1:42:31] of the of the bathroom window and when
[1:42:34] that moon gets bright and the weather
[1:42:37] permits it to shine i don't need a light
[1:42:40] i can see well to get out of the bed and
[1:42:42] to go into the washroom i don't have to
[1:42:45] have on any artificial light or use any
[1:42:47] electricity because the moon is out
[1:42:50] there doing its job
[1:42:53] amen
[1:42:54] you may not know it but these created
[1:42:56] things have voices
[1:42:59] they have sounds
[1:43:01] they have vibrations
[1:43:04] you know science has recorded
[1:43:07] the the sound of space
[1:43:11] you can hear it you can google it
[1:43:13] and you can hear the sound of outer
[1:43:16] space
[1:43:17] my my my my
[1:43:19] it sounds like just pleasant noise
[1:43:23] maybe like white noise to us but to the
[1:43:26] creator
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:29] it's praise
[1:43:31] it's worship
[1:43:33] it's adoration
[1:43:35] somebody said well the moon don't have a
[1:43:38] choice he doesn't
[1:43:40] she doesn't
[1:43:42] it doesn't
[1:43:43] the stars don't have a choice they don't
[1:43:46] but i want you to know god receives
[1:43:48] their praise
[1:43:50] they were created to give their light
[1:43:52] they were placed there as a testimony of
[1:43:55] the greatness and the goodness of our
[1:43:56] god but you have a choice
[1:44:00] and even if every star in the galaxy is
[1:44:03] praising him and if the mountains are
[1:44:06] singing his grandeur
[1:44:08] hallelujah if the trees are clapping
[1:44:11] their hands
[1:44:13] and the hills are giving god lord and
[1:44:17] awe and praise he would rather hear from
[1:44:21] those who have a choice
[1:44:24] are you with me
[1:44:25] he would rather hear your voice
[1:44:30] giving him praise
[1:44:32] are you with me oh
[1:44:35] nobody
[1:44:36] can praise him
[1:44:38] like i can
[1:44:41] you can't take my place
[1:44:44] nobody can praise him like you can i
[1:44:48] can't take your place
[1:44:50] your voice must be heard
[1:44:53] it's your heart
[1:44:55] turned and positioned toward god that
[1:44:59] he's after
[1:45:01] oh oh the clamor of a service all the
[1:45:05] praise of a service and the glory of a
[1:45:08] service is not enough he wants to hear
[1:45:12] your
[1:45:13] voice
[1:45:15] the songwriter wrote a song and said god
[1:45:17] wants to hear you sing
[1:45:21] i know what some of you are thinking
[1:45:24] you're thinking he don't want to hear me
[1:45:25] sing
[1:45:27] i'm not a very good singer
[1:45:29] let me tell you something
[1:45:32] you you may be right i'm not going to
[1:45:33] argue with you
[1:45:35] i'm not going to tell you everybody can
[1:45:37] sing cause they can't
[1:45:41] it'd be nice
[1:45:43] if everybody could
[1:45:45] i hate to say i'm so sorry brother billy
[1:45:49] i hate to you see people get quiet
[1:45:52] brother billy was preaching
[1:45:54] brother billy was preaching one time he
[1:45:56] told this
[1:45:58] years ago
[1:46:00] he thought well if i'm going to preach
[1:46:02] i'm going to need to be able to sing
[1:46:06] so he signed
[1:46:09] terrible terrible i'm terrible to me to
[1:46:11] laugh
[1:46:13] he's
[1:46:15] i felt sorry for him that night i'm just
[1:46:17] laughing at him today
[1:46:19] he said it got him some voice lessons
[1:46:21] and after a few
[1:46:24] they just told him
[1:46:29] you need to save your money
[1:46:32] oh
[1:46:35] i'm sorry i'm trying to help you out
[1:46:36] here
[1:46:38] he said it was halfway through the first
[1:46:40] lesson
[1:46:44] now if you know that's an honest person
[1:46:47] because most people would have just said
[1:46:48] i'm going to try to work with you and
[1:46:50] took his money
[1:46:52] but somebody just finally told him you
[1:46:54] you just threw you're done
[1:46:57] everybody admitted but you know what
[1:46:59] brother billy
[1:47:01] god wants to hear
[1:47:04] your song
[1:47:06] he does
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:09] he doesn't judge it by the bar of music
[1:47:14] he doesn't judge it by by it's
[1:47:17] it's melody
[1:47:20] or whether every note is pitch perfect
[1:47:23] that little tuner who come in here
[1:47:27] he tuned the piano
[1:47:29] and then he played
[1:47:30] the piano
[1:47:32] even my untrained ear could tell it
[1:47:34] sounded a lot better this week than it
[1:47:36] was sounding before he got here
[1:47:38] and he didn't want to offend him he said
[1:47:39] it's pretty awful
[1:47:41] but we knew that especially like
[1:47:43] mirabeth said down toward those higher
[1:47:44] notes
[1:47:45] and uh
[1:47:47] everything can kind of get out of tune
[1:47:48] like that and you notice it
[1:47:51] but kovid was here and kept some of them
[1:47:54] in fact the man we scheduled to come
[1:47:56] uh who is a blind gentleman who does an
[1:47:59] amazing job was not was unable to come
[1:48:02] and our this other fellow had to be
[1:48:04] rescheduled they neither one live here
[1:48:07] they have to drive from either
[1:48:08] montgomery or eufaula
[1:48:10] to come and tune the piano but i don't i
[1:48:13] knew it sounded off a time or two but it
[1:48:15] didn't really bother me like some you
[1:48:17] know it's bad when a streamer writes
[1:48:22] a streamer thank you streamers
[1:48:26] and says i will be more than happy to
[1:48:28] pay
[1:48:34] to tune the vienna i didn't get my
[1:48:36] little feelings hurt
[1:48:38] i said thank god this will be
[1:48:41] the motivation we need to get it tuned
[1:48:44] and you'll be proud of me i've scheduled
[1:48:46] to have it tuned every six months now
[1:48:50] and i said you know what we're we're
[1:48:52] pentecostal and we can be a little
[1:48:54] heavy-handed
[1:48:56] and he said well it doesn't really
[1:48:57] matter he said but it's just better to
[1:48:59] keep it in good working order i couldn't
[1:49:02] tell but somebody could tell but i want
[1:49:04] you to know that it was like that week
[1:49:08] after week
[1:49:10] after week
[1:49:12] month after month
[1:49:14] aldrin covet
[1:49:16] didn't keep sister laurel from playing
[1:49:18] it
[1:49:20] didn't keep sister marabeth from playing
[1:49:22] it didn't keep cinderella when she was
[1:49:24] here from playing it didn't keep me from
[1:49:26] singing along
[1:49:30] didn't keep you from praising the lord
[1:49:35] singing to an out-of-tune piano
[1:49:38] god didn't come and say hey
[1:49:42] no more of that attitude stuff
[1:49:45] he just blessed us didn't he
[1:49:48] blast us and blessed us and blessed us
[1:49:51] so that shows you it's not the tone
[1:49:56] it's not the pitch perfect
[1:50:01] it's the sincerity of your heart
[1:50:06] whoa
[1:50:08] boy i want to preach and i don't feel
[1:50:09] able
[1:50:10] i want to preach
[1:50:12] i want to get it to you
[1:50:14] i want to show you where you should
[1:50:16] preach a lot about prayer i know i know
[1:50:18] i do i preach a lot about praise
[1:50:21] i'm trying to make up for all those that
[1:50:23] won't preach about it
[1:50:26] because i have a lot of friends that
[1:50:27] won't preach about it
[1:50:29] because they're afraid it'll cause a
[1:50:30] little wildfire in their churches
[1:50:33] i've had them tell me
[1:50:35] i've had them tell me brother shelly i'd
[1:50:37] love for you to come and do a series in
[1:50:40] our church on praise but i can't do it
[1:50:44] i got some big names i could toss out
[1:50:46] here
[1:50:48] they said i can't let you do it
[1:50:51] because said then i'm afraid the people
[1:50:54] would get a little wildfire
[1:50:57] you ought to hear what brother branham
[1:50:58] said about wildfire
[1:51:03] i tell you what i'll tell you like my
[1:51:05] old pentecostal granny she said well
[1:51:08] they holler wildfire wildfire till they
[1:51:11] put out the fire
[1:51:13] she said i just want some fire
[1:51:16] and she said i'll tell you right now if
[1:51:18] this ain't the real fire it'll do to the
[1:51:20] real fire gets here
[1:51:23] [Applause]
[1:51:25] you say i can't amend that then hold
[1:51:26] your peace
[1:51:28] hold your peace if you can't amend that
[1:51:30] but i can amend that
[1:51:32] if preaching on praise it's going to
[1:51:34] cause somebody to get a little wild
[1:51:38] no wonder the disciples the people
[1:51:40] standing there told the disciples tell
[1:51:43] them to hold their peace
[1:51:46] jesus said i could if you wanted me to
[1:51:49] but if i told them the bible said they
[1:51:51] praised him in a loud voice too
[1:51:53] said it
[1:51:55] they just started crying out blessed is
[1:51:58] he
[1:51:59] who comes
[1:52:01] hoshanah
[1:52:03] hoshanah
[1:52:06] blessed is he who comes hosanna hoshanah
[1:52:11] got loud
[1:52:13] and they said just you need to tell them
[1:52:16] didn't they hear
[1:52:18] two times church order
[1:52:25] if you didn't get it in 51 you got it
[1:52:27] the next time
[1:52:29] you've got church order twice
[1:52:32] anything you get twice or you ought to
[1:52:34] listen to
[1:52:35] and i have
[1:52:37] and when i listen to it i don't hear
[1:52:39] anything in there
[1:52:40] telling me that i ought not to give god
[1:52:43] all the praise
[1:52:45] that i can
[1:52:46] i'm going to tell you something for me
[1:52:49] praise and worship is the most important
[1:52:52] weapon
[1:52:53] [Applause]
[1:52:56] come and say what about the word what
[1:52:58] about the word what about the word you
[1:52:59] can't even praise god the way he wants
[1:53:02] to be praised outside of that word
[1:53:07] because he's not listening at your voice
[1:53:11] whether you can sing or not
[1:53:13] he's reading your heart
[1:53:16] he's looking to see if the word of the
[1:53:18] hour is there
[1:53:20] that's right
[1:53:22] that's right coach brother branham said
[1:53:24] this week when i was listening he said
[1:53:26] i'll tell you right now he said i used
[1:53:28] to say pentecostals used to say speaking
[1:53:30] in tongues
[1:53:32] it's the initial evidence of the holy
[1:53:33] ghost he said then one day i said love
[1:53:38] he said perfect love
[1:53:40] and then he said one day i was talking
[1:53:42] to level and level had an idea and he
[1:53:44] said and he said i think it's a good one
[1:53:47] he said the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:53:48] is being able to receive the full word
[1:53:50] for the hour
[1:53:52] i don't have a problem with that
[1:53:54] all i know is somebody needs to get so
[1:53:59] full
[1:54:00] of the holy ghost that you quit dipping
[1:54:03] in unbelief
[1:54:05] [Applause]
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:08] you need to be so filled with the holy
[1:54:10] ghost that you're looking for more room
[1:54:12] in your skirt
[1:54:16] not
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:20] less more him
[1:54:23] more length
[1:54:25] instead of less
[1:54:27] a little more covering your arm
[1:54:30] than not
[1:54:31] you see when we get filled with the holy
[1:54:34] ghost it keeps us
[1:54:36] right on the word
[1:54:39] and when we start pulling away a little
[1:54:40] bit it's the holy ghost
[1:54:43] that pulls us back to the word
[1:54:45] that's what he said i've heard him
[1:54:49] seemed like everything i was listening
[1:54:51] to
[1:54:52] i heard a whole sermon friday night and
[1:54:54] a whole
[1:54:54] heard a whole sermon yesterday
[1:54:57] and i'll tell you it seemed like
[1:54:58] everything and i wasn't picking them by
[1:55:00] the title
[1:55:02] cheater
[1:55:04] you can kind of get what you want
[1:55:06] sometime doing that
[1:55:07] i just said i'm going to take the last
[1:55:10] sermon that he preached on this day
[1:55:14] and i listened to the last one he
[1:55:15] preached on friday
[1:55:17] it's in the app you can find it and i
[1:55:19] listen to the last one that he preached
[1:55:21] yesterday on that date
[1:55:23] all those years ago i think yesterday it
[1:55:25] might have gone all the way back to 61.
[1:55:27] i can't remember and in both of those
[1:55:29] sermons years apart brother brandon was
[1:55:32] saying a lot of beautiful things
[1:55:36] but i found an amazing
[1:55:39] see it was the same day day one day
[1:55:41] after another but years apart
[1:55:44] and i found so many wonderful
[1:55:46] similarities in what he was saying
[1:55:49] in both of those sermons he was calling
[1:55:51] for people to have an experience
[1:55:55] with god and when you have an experience
[1:55:58] with god you can't sit on your hands
[1:56:00] when you come to church
[1:56:05] nobody in my house but me
[1:56:07] brother branham couldn't hear me
[1:56:10] nobody could tell that i was getting
[1:56:13] into the spirit of it
[1:56:15] like he told us to do but right by
[1:56:18] myself i couldn't help but say a man
[1:56:22] brother
[1:56:24] that is nothing but the word
[1:56:27] thank you for telling it like it is i
[1:56:30] cannot be like some dead zombie
[1:56:35] when the word goes forth there's an a
[1:56:39] man
[1:56:40] on the inside of me
[1:56:42] that has to come out
[1:56:45] praise
[1:56:46] the word should take the most
[1:56:48] preeminence among us
[1:56:50] always
[1:56:51] but praise
[1:56:53] having a
[1:56:55] praise
[1:56:57] to to put praise first is a good idea
[1:57:01] not too long ago the lord was dealing
[1:57:03] with me about prayer and he said
[1:57:06] you'll get on track and on target a
[1:57:08] whole lot quicker if you'll praise me
[1:57:10] before you pray
[1:57:13] now see the pentecostals taught us the
[1:57:14] other way they said you pray
[1:57:16] and get everything out and then you
[1:57:18] praise well the holy spirit taught me to
[1:57:20] do it differently he said you'll get a
[1:57:22] whole lot good luck on track a whole lot
[1:57:24] quicker
[1:57:25] praying the mind of the spirit
[1:57:28] instead of your own selfish desire if
[1:57:30] you start coming in with praise
[1:57:33] and instead of praying first praise
[1:57:36] first get your heart moldable and
[1:57:40] pliable before god because we don't want
[1:57:43] any rocks crying out
[1:57:45] are you with me
[1:57:47] judah
[1:57:48] was just one of the
[1:57:50] tribes it was not the firstborn
[1:57:54] among the tribes
[1:57:58] but it was the tribe that over and over
[1:58:01] and over again god said you're first
[1:58:04] you're first
[1:58:05] you're first he didn't love judah any
[1:58:07] more than he loved the rest of the
[1:58:08] tribes he had a reason prophetically for
[1:58:11] sending judah ahead of all the rest
[1:58:14] because judah's name mean praise
[1:58:17] come on now and when the holy ghost was
[1:58:20] directing even we're not talking about
[1:58:22] the baptism of the holy ghost now in the
[1:58:23] old testament we're talking about the
[1:58:25] leadership and direction of the spirit
[1:58:27] of god which we can also call the
[1:58:30] eternal spirit of the father but he
[1:58:32] wants the holy spirit and he was
[1:58:34] directing things and moving in ways in
[1:58:37] the old testament that we find very very
[1:58:41] profound when we look back and there was
[1:58:43] an order like i mentioned this morning
[1:58:46] about a pro a prophetic protocol of
[1:58:49] coming before the king you don't just
[1:58:52] stomp your way in
[1:58:54] i know some of you are sleepy
[1:58:56] i know you're sleepy
[1:58:58] please don't be
[1:59:01] don't miss this
[1:59:03] because you may have something come up
[1:59:05] this week that you need to send praise
[1:59:08] first
[1:59:10] instead of panic
[1:59:13] praise first panic later say it with me
[1:59:16] praise first
[1:59:18] panic later
[1:59:19] you may find out that you don't have to
[1:59:21] panic
[1:59:23] you may be caught up in faith
[1:59:26] you may be caught up in blessed
[1:59:28] assurance
[1:59:29] you may get so anointed in your praise
[1:59:32] that what was disturbing you a minute
[1:59:34] ago is no longer disturbing you
[1:59:37] you may find that your mind doesn't keep
[1:59:39] dragging you back to how bad it is
[1:59:47] we just got to get some of this extra
[1:59:49] stuff out of moss place
[1:59:54] there won't be room
[1:59:56] to move their stuff in
[1:59:58] well i just don't have a room in my
[2:00:00] pocket for it
[2:00:02] i told my wife
[2:00:04] i i just don't have room in my pocket
[2:00:06] for that stuff
[2:00:07] we got to figure something out
[2:00:10] i said i call them and find out how much
[2:00:12] it'll be to rent a mobile attic
[2:00:14] i'll put that out there for a few months
[2:00:16] and
[2:00:17] start going through the rest of it and
[2:00:19] selling what we can and
[2:00:21] getting keeping what i want
[2:00:31] i've had to say a time or two get in
[2:00:32] your place now woman
[2:00:36] with a smile on my
[2:00:38] face she's been pretty good about it
[2:00:42] i gotta have a little room and that we
[2:00:44] called it was a good price now i know
[2:00:46] why it was so cheap to get it
[2:00:50] so we get it it comes out there and the
[2:00:52] man don't take time to see where the
[2:00:54] power line is he just
[2:00:57] runs right through it
[2:00:59] all he had to do was lower his
[2:01:01] hydraulics just a little bit he could go
[2:01:02] right under it if you'd have met him you
[2:01:05] kind of understood
[2:01:08] he's a little scattered
[2:01:10] so he not only rips the power line down
[2:01:13] he splits the pole
[2:01:17] i'm so glad that sister beth
[2:01:21] is having such a good time
[2:01:24] mm-hmm she wasn't laughing like that
[2:01:25] when the washers and dryers and vehicles
[2:01:27] and all that was going or was she
[2:01:30] when she was having a hard time when
[2:01:31] brother steve called me on the phone
[2:01:38] i'm kidding
[2:01:40] bust burst the pole splintered it
[2:01:43] and laid it out there and then wanted us
[2:01:45] to say that we couldn't he said well all
[2:01:48] of us was
[2:01:49] all of us thought it would work
[2:01:53] well benjamin wasn't him up there yet
[2:01:54] and stacy was on the porch and i was in
[2:01:56] the house there wasn't all of us
[2:01:59] involved
[2:02:01] anyway it took a solid week
[2:02:04] because they come out and they said you
[2:02:06] can't fix it like it was
[2:02:08] they forgot about grandfather cause
[2:02:12] that has saved us many times
[2:02:14] in many places including where you stand
[2:02:16] now
[2:02:18] on this property they forgot about all
[2:02:20] that and everything had to be redone
[2:02:23] not just new poll everything had to be
[2:02:26] redone
[2:02:28] and it feels so
[2:02:30] heavy
[2:02:32] so it went from about a 300 project to
[2:02:35] almost a 3 000 project
[2:02:38] in in a few days
[2:02:40] and days are ticking off
[2:02:43] no power
[2:02:45] pressure's on because jen and her mom
[2:02:48] were coming last night
[2:02:50] and we needed a place for them to be
[2:02:52] able to stay of course
[2:02:54] and that wasn't the biggest problem the
[2:02:56] biggest problem was getting it fixed
[2:02:58] right
[2:02:59] and getting the inspect i tell you what
[2:03:02] i'm going to pray that man gets saved
[2:03:03] filled with the holy ghost and baptized
[2:03:06] in the name of jesus
[2:03:10] and all the rest of them too and if
[2:03:12] you're listening i'm talking to you you
[2:03:14] need jesus
[2:03:16] [Applause]
[2:03:18] he was just being picky
[2:03:20] but i just kept saying to him we got to
[2:03:23] we cannot let this we cannot we cannot
[2:03:27] we can't get off track
[2:03:30] there's reason to panic there's reason
[2:03:33] to fret there's reason to be upset but
[2:03:36] we've got to choose to say
[2:03:41] it's all for a reason
[2:03:45] i finally said to him i want this safe
[2:03:49] i said to my family i want this safe i
[2:03:52] don't want it unsafe i don't think it
[2:03:54] was unsafe but i want it safe
[2:03:58] i said our future grandbabies may live
[2:04:00] here
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:04] and i said and furthermore benjamin and
[2:04:05] jenna can run
[2:04:09] but those grandbabies may not be able to
[2:04:10] run from the fire
[2:04:14] i want it done right
[2:04:16] it's all for a reason
[2:04:18] god knows what he's doing
[2:04:22] he
[2:04:22] provided he made a way
[2:04:26] you ought to see how god made a way it
[2:04:28] didn't even have to go on a credit card
[2:04:30] because god miraculously provided and
[2:04:33] made a way
[2:04:35] [Applause]
[2:04:37] something that i should have gotten last
[2:04:39] month came this month and it wasn't my
[2:04:41] tax refund
[2:04:44] it should have been here last month but
[2:04:46] if it would have been it would have been
[2:04:47] spent
[2:04:48] but it not only come this month it came
[2:04:51] days before the check had to be written
[2:04:56] so i just kept saying we got to praise
[2:04:57] him we've got to praise him we cannot
[2:05:00] let this get us off track we've got to
[2:05:03] praise him
[2:05:06] my little wife running through the house
[2:05:07] saying god is moving among us we are
[2:05:11] about to see a mighty move of god no
[2:05:15] wonder the devil is mad and i'm not
[2:05:18] going to let him win come on
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:22] we don't just preach this
[2:05:25] we practice this
[2:05:28] it's the only way to survive in this
[2:05:31] hour
[2:05:32] sin
[2:05:33] first
[2:05:37] hallelujah
[2:05:39] i don't know if they're going to pay for
[2:05:40] any of it or not
[2:05:42] but i'm sending judah first
[2:05:44] i'm going to praise first
[2:05:47] and fret later if i have to
[2:05:49] i got a feeling i'm telling you folks if
[2:05:52] you let praise go ahead of you
[2:05:54] when you go to battle
[2:06:00] my
[2:06:02] see it's like this and i can't preach
[2:06:04] when i want to preach
[2:06:05] i just can't get it out
[2:06:10] judah
[2:06:11] means praise
[2:06:13] the sons of israel broke camp and every
[2:06:16] time they broke camp
[2:06:18] the tribe of judah led the way
[2:06:21] when israel went to war
[2:06:23] judah was the first to battle
[2:06:25] what kind of military strategy is that
[2:06:31] the best one
[2:06:34] they didn't send the swords
[2:06:39] they didn't send the catapults
[2:06:41] [Music]
[2:06:43] they didn't send the slingshots
[2:06:46] or the shotguns
[2:06:48] i'm taking a little liberty here
[2:06:50] or the atom bombs
[2:06:54] you know anything about the stories
[2:06:57] of hanukkah
[2:06:59] brother
[2:07:00] has told us the story of hanukkah
[2:07:03] and even in that in that period between
[2:07:05] the testaments
[2:07:06] the greeks used elephants
[2:07:09] for warfare
[2:07:12] so don't think that it was so primitive
[2:07:14] they didn't know how to kill one another
[2:07:17] even in the time of israel against the
[2:07:19] philistines they had ways of killing one
[2:07:22] another
[2:07:24] some of it was hand-to-hand
[2:07:26] combat and some of it was was these
[2:07:28] catapults that they used to to to sling
[2:07:31] these boulders
[2:07:33] to tear down the walls and to take out
[2:07:35] the camps and they would set fire
[2:07:38] while you've even heard about some foxes
[2:07:41] who are caught in their tails tied
[2:07:43] together in a torch lit on fire sit out
[2:07:46] into the barley fields of the
[2:07:47] philistines
[2:07:48] any kind of weapon anything can become a
[2:07:50] weapon when you're involved in active
[2:07:52] warfare but when it come time for god to
[2:07:55] set the order for the camp to move he
[2:07:57] didn't choose those who were the most
[2:08:00] skilled in brutal hand-to-hand combat he
[2:08:03] said no sin judah first
[2:08:06] let judah go before the bows and arrows
[2:08:08] help me
[2:08:10] let judah go before the bullets and the
[2:08:12] bombs and and all you let judah
[2:08:16] lead the way
[2:08:18] it was a good strategy then
[2:08:23] it's a better strategy now
[2:08:25] it prepares the atmosphere it
[2:08:28] impregnates the atmosphere with the
[2:08:30] promises of god when we come praising
[2:08:32] him it releases the atmosphere of heaven
[2:08:35] which is glory in our midst
[2:08:38] it prepares our hearts to receive the
[2:08:41] word when we gather corporately and send
[2:08:44] judah first
[2:08:46] when we individually get caught in a bad
[2:08:49] situation during the week and we
[2:08:51] individually or as a family decide hey
[2:08:56] we're not going to send emotions first
[2:09:01] we're not going to meet the enemy with
[2:09:03] emotions first or opinions first
[2:09:07] or prejudices first
[2:09:09] we're going to meet the enemy with
[2:09:10] praises first
[2:09:13] we're going to baffle the devils
[2:09:17] the demons aren't going to know what's
[2:09:19] going on
[2:09:20] because instead of getting in a tither
[2:09:22] and panicking and killing ourselves
[2:09:25] by falling into our own entrapments
[2:09:28] we're going to target our praise
[2:09:30] and our praise isn't headed toward the
[2:09:32] enemy our praise is heading toward our
[2:09:34] deliverer
[2:09:36] and we're going to let him know that if
[2:09:37] anything is accomplished in this battle
[2:09:39] it will be because of him
[2:09:41] you are great you are faithful you are
[2:09:44] mighty you are worthy you're the god of
[2:09:46] the whirlwind you're the god of battles
[2:09:49] mighty god everlasting father prince of
[2:09:53] peace lily of the valley bride and
[2:09:56] morning star
[2:09:59] that's who you are
[2:10:02] that's who you are
[2:10:04] oh
[2:10:04] numbers 2 9 just flash that if you can
[2:10:08] all that were numbered in the camp of
[2:10:09] judah were 100 000 and four score
[2:10:11] thousand and six thousand and four
[2:10:13] hundred throughout their armies
[2:10:16] these shall first set forth
[2:10:20] somebody say send judah first
[2:10:23] in the book of judges we see two
[2:10:25] instances
[2:10:27] where the lord said that the tribe of
[2:10:29] judah is to go first against their
[2:10:31] enemies in battle
[2:10:32] the first occurrence is found in judges
[2:10:34] chapter 1
[2:10:35] following the death of joshua
[2:10:38] when the children of israel inquired of
[2:10:40] the lord he said now after the death of
[2:10:42] joshua it came to pass that the children
[2:10:44] of israel asked the lord saying who
[2:10:46] shall go up for us against the
[2:10:49] canaanites first to fight against them
[2:10:52] that's judges 1 1 and this is 1 2 and
[2:10:54] the lord said read it for me would you
[2:10:57] judah
[2:11:00] behold i have delivered
[2:11:03] the land
[2:11:04] into
[2:11:06] your hands
[2:11:08] all of israel's hands
[2:11:11] judah
[2:11:13] you get judah
[2:11:15] you get judah leading the way
[2:11:17] you get the children of judah going
[2:11:19] first they were not those who were
[2:11:21] skilled in hand-to-hand combat do you
[2:11:23] know what they were skilled in they
[2:11:24] played trumpets
[2:11:27] help me
[2:11:28] they played shofars
[2:11:30] they clapped their hands
[2:11:32] and sang praises to the god of heaven
[2:11:34] come on
[2:11:36] they were singers and i don't mean to
[2:11:39] disturb your peace but they were
[2:11:41] twirlers
[2:11:45] when they went to praising him the word
[2:11:48] that's used for dance is a hebrew word
[2:11:51] that means to twirl
[2:12:00] where are you
[2:12:14] i'll be with you shortly
[2:12:16] i wasn't made for
[2:12:18] that stop world i want to get off
[2:12:23] that is what they did
[2:12:25] they did twirly gigs
[2:12:29] can you imagine an enemy
[2:12:32] waiting up on the hills
[2:12:36] for israel to approach
[2:12:40] and here come trumpet players
[2:12:44] shofar blowers
[2:12:46] symbol claspers
[2:12:49] and these folks
[2:12:53] it's a hebrew word it means to twirl
[2:12:56] hallelujah
[2:12:59] you see these little girls
[2:13:00] that love to be ballerinas
[2:13:03] they may be picking up on something more
[2:13:05] ancient than we realize
[2:13:08] because there was an hour in the bible
[2:13:10] when battles were won
[2:13:12] with a twirling army
[2:13:25] think about it
[2:13:28] what were we reading did we finish
[2:13:32] uh um
[2:13:33] did we get it out
[2:13:35] i'm loaded i can't get it out fast
[2:13:37] enough
[2:13:38] the second is found in judges
[2:13:41] uh
[2:13:42] uh 20
[2:13:45] and i won't read that
[2:13:48] but in verse 18
[2:13:51] it says judah shall go up first
[2:13:54] so two times judges one and judges 20
[2:13:57] when there was an inquiry made of the
[2:13:59] lord
[2:14:00] who will lead the way god already told
[2:14:02] them who was to break up camp and go
[2:14:03] first
[2:14:04] but they wanted to make sure that it
[2:14:06] meant to battle
[2:14:08] so two times they pray what should we do
[2:14:10] for have you ever been there
[2:14:13] i don't i know i got to do a lot of
[2:14:15] things sister anita let me let me talk
[2:14:17] to sister anita
[2:14:20] she came in here last sunday overwhelmed
[2:14:24] really really overwhelmed she had a list
[2:14:26] of things
[2:14:27] that had to be taken care of legally
[2:14:30] and practically for their lives
[2:14:33] no time to do it
[2:14:35] constant full-time caretaker for her
[2:14:38] husband
[2:14:40] no time to read anything
[2:14:42] understand anything
[2:14:44] fill out anything
[2:14:46] hardly enough time to pay the bill and
[2:14:48] make sure the house
[2:14:50] doesn't fall apart
[2:14:52] she was overwhelmed
[2:14:54] she has
[2:14:55] become a trained nurse
[2:14:58] she has learned things she never thought
[2:14:59] she would have to know
[2:15:01] and sometimes she has been able to to
[2:15:03] advise
[2:15:05] professionals
[2:15:07] of what to do
[2:15:09] her whole life for these years
[2:15:11] has been dedicated to the love of her
[2:15:13] life
[2:15:14] her beloved
[2:15:16] and she has weathered the storm quite
[2:15:18] well
[2:15:19] but this past weekend her testimony
[2:15:22] is
[2:15:23] she just hit the wall
[2:15:25] and friday night and
[2:15:27] saturday night it was just a culmination
[2:15:29] of everything and she nearly had a
[2:15:32] breakdown
[2:15:33] and as i was preaching here i feel god
[2:15:36] anyway
[2:15:39] as i was preaching here she texted and
[2:15:41] said ken we were coming toward the end
[2:15:42] of the service
[2:15:44] and we were going to pray and she said
[2:15:45] can i come over
[2:15:47] and crystalline had stayed home with her
[2:15:49] dad and was helping take care of him and
[2:15:52] i i looked over 10 12 minutes later i
[2:15:55] think it's about 12 minutes later i
[2:15:56] found the text
[2:15:59] and and i thought i said oh no
[2:16:02] i didn't tell her she could come over
[2:16:04] and we're getting ready to start closing
[2:16:06] and i looked up and my wife was standing
[2:16:08] there and sister anita had found my wife
[2:16:10] and they were standing there hugging
[2:16:13] and she came and got prayer
[2:16:15] and got some direction for her life
[2:16:18] and when i spoke to her
[2:16:20] late friday night i think it was late
[2:16:23] friday night
[2:16:25] i was sitting at the dining room table
[2:16:26] listening to brother branham
[2:16:29] and
[2:16:30] i i finally was able to touch base with
[2:16:33] her it's probably ten o'clock
[2:16:35] she the first thing out of her mouth was
[2:16:37] brother shelley you'll never know thank
[2:16:39] you thank you thank you thank you thank
[2:16:41] you and thank everybody for praying for
[2:16:43] me
[2:16:44] i have been able to accomplish so many
[2:16:46] things she began to list the things that
[2:16:49] she had taken care of in one week's time
[2:16:51] that had been chasing her like extending
[2:16:54] their tax deadline and all these legal
[2:16:57] things that you and i just do when they
[2:16:59] have to be done but they piled up on her
[2:17:02] you know that dirty low down sorry devil
[2:17:05] from hell if he can't break you down one
[2:17:08] way he'll try another way
[2:17:12] but she just knew she had to get under
[2:17:14] the atmosphere and the presence of the
[2:17:16] lord and we prayed for her after the
[2:17:19] service we sat there on the front row
[2:17:21] and talked for quite a while
[2:17:23] and she said you just wouldn't believe
[2:17:25] the things that i was able to get taken
[2:17:27] care of when that old fog and whatever
[2:17:30] else that the enemy had put on me was
[2:17:33] lifted i was able to focus so much
[2:17:35] better and get things done i want to
[2:17:37] give god praise for that
[2:17:39] i want to tell you that's what i'm
[2:17:40] talking about
[2:17:44] that's what i'm talking about
[2:17:46] she could have sat at home and said well
[2:17:47] crystalline's here i need this time
[2:17:51] to fill out these papers
[2:17:53] so i'll go to the table and i'll begin
[2:17:55] to do all this she could have used her
[2:17:56] time that way but she chose to use her
[2:18:00] time like i'm preaching this morning
[2:18:02] send judah first
[2:18:06] you ought to be a little louder than
[2:18:07] that
[2:18:08] send judah first
[2:18:12] we ought not to have to beg anybody to
[2:18:13] praise the lord
[2:18:15] we ought not to have to beg anybody to
[2:18:16] sing for jesus
[2:18:18] we ought not to have to beg anybody to
[2:18:20] do anything in the kingdom of god no no
[2:18:22] no no no no you ought to send judah
[2:18:25] first
[2:18:26] you may not need him now but you'll need
[2:18:28] him one day
[2:18:30] you better send judah first she decided
[2:18:33] to put god first and give him that time
[2:18:36] and let him minister to her and she had
[2:18:39] a better ability
[2:18:43] so panic or praise
[2:18:45] which will it be which will it be will
[2:18:47] you panic or praise will you let your
[2:18:49] emotions get out of hand or will you
[2:18:50] praise the lord
[2:18:52] the preeminence of praise i'm talking
[2:18:54] this morning about sin judah first
[2:18:57] i won't finish this morning you know
[2:18:59] that
[2:19:00] i got to stop now pretty soon
[2:19:03] but i know that this is a subject that
[2:19:05] you and i can utilize
[2:19:08] in our life
[2:19:10] brother brother
[2:19:11] reed had a had a god moment last week
[2:19:15] and he got something hung up in a
[2:19:17] situation and and it was just going to
[2:19:20] be overwhelming all the things that had
[2:19:21] to be done to correct it he
[2:19:23] he's a plumber by trade and
[2:19:26] he knows what to do and what needs to be
[2:19:28] done but this was a bad situation
[2:19:31] and god moved for him
[2:19:36] he just moved i don't even know if you
[2:19:37] stopped to pray
[2:19:41] he moved
[2:19:42] he turned his heart towards the only one
[2:19:44] well i'm not going to bother god with
[2:19:48] oh let me tell you something
[2:19:50] anytime you call his name
[2:19:53] you're not bothering him
[2:19:56] he wants to hear from you
[2:19:58] he wants to hear your voice billy tebow
[2:20:01] whether you can sing or not
[2:20:03] he wants to hear you call his name when
[2:20:05] you get well i i don't i don't talk to
[2:20:08] him enough when things are going good so
[2:20:10] i better not talk to him when they fix
[2:20:12] it
[2:20:14] quit feeling sorry for yourself and fix
[2:20:16] it
[2:20:18] talk to him all the time
[2:20:20] you never have an excuse to say there's
[2:20:22] nobody i can talk to
[2:20:25] you can go to him well it's just not the
[2:20:27] same your mighty right it's not the same
[2:20:35] because he listens
[2:20:39] and he does something about it
[2:20:42] he possesses the power
[2:20:44] to do something about it
[2:20:47] i want to remind you again of the
[2:20:49] authority of a son
[2:20:52] when i first came around the message
[2:20:54] they were all the time they were so
[2:20:56] afraid back in the 90s they were so
[2:20:58] afraid so many of my friends were so
[2:21:00] afraid of pentecost so afraid that it
[2:21:03] was going to break out as an experience
[2:21:05] among us
[2:21:06] and drag us back into some kind of
[2:21:09] wildness or something i don't know what
[2:21:10] the fear was but we heard it every time
[2:21:12] we went to church
[2:21:16] the word the word the word the word the
[2:21:18] word the word the word the word the word
[2:21:19] the word i tell you if you're not
[2:21:21] careful you sit under that for so long
[2:21:23] you'll find a little resentment building
[2:21:28] because you can fill up with the word
[2:21:30] but until you learn to do something with
[2:21:32] the word that you have heard
[2:21:34] i'm telling you there's people dying on
[2:21:36] the vine around this message
[2:21:38] dying on the vine not because they
[2:21:41] haven't heard the word but because they
[2:21:43] don't recognize the authority
[2:21:47] that god is placing in their mouth and
[2:21:50] in their hands to use this word to
[2:21:55] accomplish the will of god in the earth
[2:21:57] so you just say i need the word we need
[2:21:59] the word we need the word we do we we
[2:22:00] did the word but what are we going to do
[2:22:01] with it when we get it
[2:22:03] so every time i would go among them they
[2:22:05] would preach
[2:22:06] power
[2:22:07] i'm not being ugly
[2:22:09] i'm being a little mocking because it
[2:22:11] nearly destroyed my life
[2:22:13] and i hadn't forgot it
[2:22:14] power
[2:22:18] power lady power
[2:22:21] they say why brother branham said we
[2:22:22] don't have power
[2:22:24] why do you want power
[2:22:28] in pentecost we had power we thought we
[2:22:30] had so much power in pentecost
[2:22:33] so i heard that until it was running out
[2:22:35] my ears
[2:22:37] so i just started searching the same
[2:22:39] message
[2:22:40] well remember back then there wasn't it
[2:22:41] wasn't as easy to search as it is now
[2:22:50] the very moment
[2:22:52] the message was searchable
[2:22:54] i was in the first 12 people
[2:22:57] in this world
[2:22:59] that owned a computer with the software
[2:23:01] i was in in the in the in the group
[2:23:05] of the first 12
[2:23:06] that were able to search this message
[2:23:09] god helped me to do it
[2:23:12] i didn't have the money to buy a
[2:23:13] computer
[2:23:14] and the computer that i had to buy to
[2:23:16] search it was this big
[2:23:18] it was called a laptop
[2:23:24] but i had to have it
[2:23:27] and i went and i walked i walked these
[2:23:30] years with them through every transition
[2:23:32] when brother neil holliva came out with
[2:23:34] with a more more
[2:23:36] uh
[2:23:40] i'll get it in a minute uh a faster
[2:23:43] database by using folio views i was one
[2:23:46] of the first to buy it
[2:23:48] he told me my computer wouldn't run it i
[2:23:50] said okay sell me a computer then
[2:23:53] and i bought a computer from him
[2:23:56] that would run his robust software
[2:23:59] to be able to search it
[2:24:01] i remember when they came out with the
[2:24:03] e-book
[2:24:04] anybody ever have an e-book
[2:24:06] i bought one of the first it was sold
[2:24:10] and i found out that i couldn't that
[2:24:12] little e-book you could search a whole
[2:24:13] message on a little ebook
[2:24:15] my goodness it the screen didn't even
[2:24:17] light up
[2:24:19] it was horrible to have to try to read
[2:24:21] it
[2:24:22] but we were so glad to have it
[2:24:25] i carried that thing in my luggage
[2:24:27] everywhere i went to preach and i found
[2:24:29] out that a printer was available
[2:24:32] so i bought me a printer that was about
[2:24:34] that big chad just talked to chad he's
[2:24:36] toted it all
[2:24:39] he's drug it all over the world he can
[2:24:41] tell you
[2:24:43] i finally bought me a little printer
[2:24:44] like this that printed the message
[2:24:47] on uh
[2:24:49] thermal
[2:24:50] paper
[2:24:52] like you use for a
[2:24:54] receipt
[2:24:58] so i would be standing up there
[2:24:59] preaching the message
[2:25:01] with a roll of paper
[2:25:07] because i
[2:25:09] found so much
[2:25:12] that he said
[2:25:14] that i had never heard anybody else
[2:25:18] preach
[2:25:20] and it sets me
[2:25:23] free
[2:25:25] i'm not trying to brag i'm telling you
[2:25:28] it was a hard road to hoe
[2:25:32] and some of you hold it with me
[2:25:34] we found that for everything they would
[2:25:38] say
[2:25:39] to try to reduce
[2:25:42] the need for a personal pentecost
[2:25:47] they would quote it
[2:25:49] like it was the
[2:25:50] authority for everything they could pull
[2:25:53] out
[2:25:54] we found out we could pull out 30
[2:25:59] that said back to pentecost
[2:26:02] back to an experience
[2:26:04] come on i'm just being honest here
[2:26:07] you've got to have your per brother
[2:26:09] branham even said i never heard nobody
[2:26:11] say it until i found it
[2:26:13] because we couldn't you couldn't say you
[2:26:15] could listen to the tapes and couldn't
[2:26:17] remember what you heard
[2:26:19] we're so blessed today
[2:26:21] i can do it on my phone
[2:26:24] i don't have to take preacher's words
[2:26:26] for it you don't have to take my word
[2:26:28] for it
[2:26:29] it's available
[2:26:31] the absolute and right interpretation of
[2:26:34] the scripture is available for all of us
[2:26:36] to find it for ourselves
[2:26:38] but we cannot take out an isolated
[2:26:41] quotation here and shut the move of god
[2:26:43] down in our lives
[2:26:46] you've got to balance every one of them
[2:26:48] together
[2:26:50] to see what the mind of god is saying
[2:26:53] and when i balance it together and i see
[2:26:55] what the mind of god's saying i want to
[2:26:57] stand here today and say send judah
[2:26:59] first
[2:27:02] go praise him
[2:27:04] praise him with everything you've got
[2:27:06] praise him out there and when you come
[2:27:08] in here praise him too
[2:27:11] i believe we have to take it all
[2:27:13] i don't believe we can cherry
[2:27:14] cherry-pick
[2:27:16] i believe what we have found out with
[2:27:18] all of the resources available to us
[2:27:20] is that what they were trying to say
[2:27:24] is that there's something greater
[2:27:26] for us than power
[2:27:30] but i just couldn't get him around to
[2:27:32] saying it where i was sitting
[2:27:34] all i could hear them say was power
[2:27:37] power power only the pentecostals won't
[2:27:40] power our power
[2:27:42] and i'm thinking well what do we what
[2:27:43] what do we got then
[2:27:45] and here come brother ban i'm saying it
[2:27:46] don't take power
[2:27:49] the balance the balance don't say power
[2:27:52] it takes authority
[2:27:59] anybody with me
[2:28:00] whoa
[2:28:01] i'll never forget i had never heard a
[2:28:03] preacher
[2:28:04] never heard another preacher say this
[2:28:06] never ever ever in any big message
[2:28:09] convention anywhere i was ever preaching
[2:28:11] had i ever heard anybody quote this
[2:28:14] until i was listening for myself what's
[2:28:16] the lesson here hear it for yourself
[2:28:19] and hear it with the right spirit
[2:28:20] and don't hear it to try to fight
[2:28:22] somebody else with it hear it to get
[2:28:24] delivered just let the word do the work
[2:28:28] come on one day i'm listening and i'm
[2:28:30] desperate i'm so desperate i have been
[2:28:32] censured i have been told all kinds of
[2:28:36] things you'll calm down we thought you'd
[2:28:38] calm down in 12 months now it's been
[2:28:40] four years you're still on the road you
[2:28:43] ain't calmed down yet we still hear you
[2:28:44] speaking in tongues around the altar
[2:28:47] but we know one day all that'll get
[2:28:49] settled
[2:28:53] great men that i love to this day pet me
[2:28:55] on the head
[2:28:57] and say i was just like you
[2:29:01] just like you when i started out but i
[2:29:03] got all settled in the word
[2:29:06] and you will too
[2:29:09] and i'm thinking i don't i don't even
[2:29:10] know what that means
[2:29:12] but if it means act like that um
[2:29:16] you see i was there when it happened
[2:29:18] i was there when heaven opened up and he
[2:29:20] baptized me with the holy ghost and fire
[2:29:23] i didn't know it was illegal then i
[2:29:25] didn't know that i didn't know that you
[2:29:27] had to be baptized in jesus name i
[2:29:29] didn't know you had to do this or that
[2:29:30] or the other all i knew was i wanted the
[2:29:32] holy ghost more than anything else in
[2:29:34] all the world
[2:29:37] one day i'm sitting down listening to a
[2:29:39] tape tape
[2:29:42] cassette
[2:29:43] for you kids aaron
[2:29:45] come to my office sometime i'll show you
[2:29:47] a cassette
[2:29:50] oh thanks be to god
[2:29:53] i was listening to a cassette one day my
[2:29:54] heart was so broken i had been so
[2:29:57] censored so
[2:29:59] criticized i had been sitting in a week
[2:30:01] of meetings where i was the subject
[2:30:03] every night
[2:30:06] and i'm thinking your poor people lord
[2:30:08] here they need to be helped and fed but
[2:30:10] they're using all their time to preach
[2:30:12] against me
[2:30:14] and i wasn't mad i was broken i was so
[2:30:16] broken
[2:30:18] i said god i don't know why in the world
[2:30:20] you'd drag me into this anyway
[2:30:22] but i cannot survive like this
[2:30:26] and i heard a sermon i was listening to
[2:30:28] a sermon in the motel room
[2:30:30] and brother branham came out on that
[2:30:31] sermon and this is what he said i'm
[2:30:33] paraphrasing
[2:30:34] he talked about the difference between
[2:30:36] power and authority
[2:30:39] he talked about that little police
[2:30:40] officer i'd never heard it preach never
[2:30:43] heard it quoted never heard anybody
[2:30:45] mention it but i was hearing it right
[2:30:47] out of his lips and i immediately had a
[2:30:49] vision it wasn't a spiritual vision it
[2:30:51] was a carnal vision i saw barney fife
[2:30:58] my battery died what time is it
[2:31:03] 1 27.
[2:31:04] i saw barney five
[2:31:07] i saw his brother branham preached
[2:31:10] that that little weak
[2:31:12] officer of the law
[2:31:15] he was describing him
[2:31:17] had no power against the oncoming
[2:31:20] traffic
[2:31:21] hear me stay with me
[2:31:23] he couldn't have stopped that truck if
[2:31:24] he wanted to he had no power
[2:31:27] he had no power
[2:31:29] he had no power
[2:31:30] guess what he didn't need any power of
[2:31:32] his own he had something greater than
[2:31:34] power that's what they were trying to
[2:31:37] say but they never said it
[2:31:41] i never heard him finish it
[2:31:43] they just kept saying powerful i got my
[2:31:46] parallel hold up a pentagon's a power to
[2:31:47] brother power
[2:31:49] but when i heard him say it i knew where
[2:31:52] they got it
[2:31:53] i just didn't know why they didn't
[2:31:54] finish it it must have not they didn't
[2:31:56] have visions of barney fife like i did
[2:31:58] it didn't speak to them like it spoke to
[2:32:00] me i saw that man standing there but he
[2:32:02] didn't have to have power to stop that
[2:32:04] vehicle he had a badge big old shiny
[2:32:07] badge and of course i'm adding to the
[2:32:09] quote there had a bullet in his pocket
[2:32:13] brother graham didn't say that that's
[2:32:14] what i'm saying
[2:32:15] bull in the pocket he couldn't have got
[2:32:17] it in the gun fast enough to stop the
[2:32:18] driver if he wanted to but oh standing
[2:32:21] there the sun
[2:32:23] the son
[2:32:24] glistened on that badge
[2:32:27] he had authority
[2:32:28] [Music]
[2:32:31] all he had to do was raise up his hand
[2:32:36] it's all you have to do little bride
[2:32:39] it's not your power that you've got to
[2:32:41] find
[2:32:43] god has all the power he has all the
[2:32:46] power and he said behold
[2:32:50] let's balance the quote he said behold i
[2:32:53] give you power
[2:32:55] over all the powers of the enemy
[2:32:59] why could he release that to his
[2:33:00] disciples because he was teaching them
[2:33:03] the grace of authority
[2:33:05] he knew he knew he knew and boy he knew
[2:33:08] him really well
[2:33:09] because some of them had some issues
[2:33:11] still
[2:33:13] they were still working through some
[2:33:14] stuff
[2:33:16] and they could have used that power
[2:33:18] pretty wildly
[2:33:20] you see you could pick up a sword and
[2:33:22] cut somebody's ear off
[2:33:26] but because jesus wasn't just there
[2:33:28] representing power he was also
[2:33:30] representing authority
[2:33:32] he reached down and picked up that ear
[2:33:35] and power didn't do that
[2:33:37] the creator's authority did that
[2:33:39] he just reached down and put that ear
[2:33:41] and slapped it right back on the head
[2:33:43] and it grew just like it always had
[2:33:45] attached just like authority did the
[2:33:47] work
[2:33:48] so what i found out is the more i
[2:33:50] searched and the more i heard the more i
[2:33:52] understood that there has to be a
[2:33:54] balance
[2:33:56] and that pentecost is not a swear word
[2:33:58] because we're not preaching pentecost as
[2:34:01] a denomination we're talking about
[2:34:03] pentecost as an experience and if you
[2:34:05] don't have a holy ghost experience you
[2:34:08] need one
[2:34:11] because if i understand what he said you
[2:34:14] can't make the rapture
[2:34:20] now it's quiet
[2:34:22] because we're putting all our
[2:34:23] denominational friends in the rapture
[2:34:27] we do
[2:34:28] don't look like you don't
[2:34:31] i hear the way you talk about everybody
[2:34:32] that that goes to church
[2:34:38] all it takes to be saved is to call on
[2:34:40] the name of the lord
[2:34:42] you don't have to believe this message
[2:34:43] to be saved
[2:34:44] if you hear them preaching that you know
[2:34:46] they're off the word
[2:34:50] because the bible tells us how to be
[2:34:51] saved you believe in your heart and
[2:34:53] confess with your mouth
[2:34:55] you're saved brother braham said get
[2:34:57] back to the abc's except believe confess
[2:35:00] didn't he say it
[2:35:02] but we're not talking about being saved
[2:35:03] we're talking about being rapture
[2:35:05] material
[2:35:06] and if i understand what he said he said
[2:35:08] it takes a new birth
[2:35:10] to make the rapture and he said the new
[2:35:12] birth is not complete until you receive
[2:35:15] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:35:17] he didn't say you have to talk in
[2:35:19] tongues
[2:35:22] he said you've got to be able to believe
[2:35:23] the word for your day
[2:35:26] you don't understand the value
[2:35:29] i pray you do
[2:35:30] but many don't understand the value of
[2:35:32] what god's given us
[2:35:33] and i don't mean no harm and i know
[2:35:35] there's a visit there too and i know
[2:35:36] there are people streaming everywhere
[2:35:38] and i don't mean to sound like i'm
[2:35:39] against anybody i'm not against anybody
[2:35:41] i'm for everybody but i can't forget
[2:35:43] what i've had to learn the hard way
[2:35:45] along the way
[2:35:46] and i cannot stand back in this hour and
[2:35:49] let this little church die on the vine
[2:35:54] i can't let us cool down
[2:35:57] until we look like status quo
[2:36:00] i'm telling you the holy spirit
[2:36:02] spoke into my heart as i lay there on
[2:36:04] the bed send judah first
[2:36:09] and we're going to send
[2:36:10] judah first
[2:36:12] we're going to praise when we can
[2:36:15] we're going to praise as often as we can
[2:36:18] and as long as we can and we're going to
[2:36:21] open up the atmosphere with our praise
[2:36:24] then we're going to let the word work
[2:36:28] we're not looking for more power we're
[2:36:31] looking for how to use the power we've
[2:36:33] been given
[2:36:36] and it comes
[2:36:38] by authority
[2:36:40] who's got more authority tiffany
[2:36:43] an archangel
[2:36:45] or a sinner saved by grace
[2:36:57] my belly was shaking
[2:37:00] i laughed so deep just then i felt like
[2:37:02] i felt my old body shaking
[2:37:05] like some old granddaddy
[2:37:08] it thrills me
[2:37:12] when i hear that
[2:37:15] i've seen
[2:37:16] angels it doesn't make me anything
[2:37:21] but i believe in them
[2:37:23] brother branham said you want to see
[2:37:24] them believe in them
[2:37:26] i heard him say this week asked he said
[2:37:29] ask
[2:37:30] to see them he said it
[2:37:34] ask to see them
[2:37:36] don't give up and quit if you don't
[2:37:40] but it wouldn't hurt
[2:37:43] i've seen them standing on this
[2:37:54] i've seen him walking i've looked out my
[2:37:56] window that i was just describing to you
[2:37:58] alfreda was in my home one time
[2:38:01] many years ago
[2:38:04] and i looked out that
[2:38:05] very same window and i saw huge
[2:38:09] strong
[2:38:10] mighty angels
[2:38:12] walking through the yard
[2:38:14] i knew that god had sent them i knew
[2:38:16] that they were investigating angels
[2:38:19] i knew they had come on us on a commit i
[2:38:21] didn't worship them i didn't try to
[2:38:23] paint a picture of them i didn't buy me
[2:38:25] a statue of them i just honored god i
[2:38:28] just thanked him
[2:38:31] i just thanked him that he would let me
[2:38:33] see
[2:38:34] they're there whether you see him or not
[2:38:37] but i just thanked him that he let me
[2:38:39] see them i'm not going to deny that i
[2:38:40] did i'm not trying to boast that i did
[2:38:42] but i'm not going to deny that i did
[2:38:44] they're real
[2:38:46] they're powerful
[2:38:49] they make fun of oral roberts because
[2:38:51] they said he saw
[2:38:53] an angel
[2:38:54] you know whatever it was 12 or 13 i
[2:38:56] don't care
[2:38:58] i'm not going to criticize that
[2:39:01] maybe he did
[2:39:04] i'm not going to come against that
[2:39:07] it's none of my business don't you be
[2:39:10] everybody's judge
[2:39:12] it's not our business but here's what
[2:39:14] you need to know about angels
[2:39:16] they're servants
[2:39:20] they don't get to go
[2:39:22] when they want to go
[2:39:24] they go when they're sent
[2:39:28] even old jacob
[2:39:30] he got an understanding of that
[2:39:33] as he had wrestled all night i'm coming
[2:39:35] to an end
[2:39:36] he'd wrestled all night with an angel
[2:39:40] god
[2:39:41] just a moment
[2:39:52] angel said i gotta go
[2:39:55] we got to finish this up here
[2:39:57] but i got to go
[2:39:59] the day's breaking
[2:40:03] you know the change of life that came
[2:40:05] you know what god did and you know that
[2:40:07] he gave him a limp that he never forgot
[2:40:09] and
[2:40:10] he always remembered wrestling with god
[2:40:12] or an angel of god
[2:40:14] at that place
[2:40:16] but it's very early in the morning like
[2:40:18] that that angels stand before the throne
[2:40:20] and receive their commissions
[2:40:24] and they get their assignments
[2:40:26] to go and do
[2:40:28] i know the pentecostal and charismatic
[2:40:30] world has encouraged people to command
[2:40:32] angels but i don't encourage people to
[2:40:34] do that even though we understand that
[2:40:37] we have more authority
[2:40:39] we understand that man was created lower
[2:40:42] in the order
[2:40:44] of of creation than the angels
[2:40:48] doesn't mean authority it means they
[2:40:50] were created in a higher order than a
[2:40:52] man and from the angel
[2:40:55] in the lower place
[2:40:56] he created man is that right am i
[2:40:58] telling what the scripture said i didn't
[2:40:59] miss that did i
[2:41:01] got it right
[2:41:02] they're powerful they're created beings
[2:41:05] they feel they feel the atmosphere
[2:41:08] you feel them sometimes you sense them
[2:41:10] sometimes you see them sometimes you
[2:41:12] don't know what you're feeling but you
[2:41:14] know the presence of god is here because
[2:41:16] those angels have stood before the
[2:41:17] throne they've stood in the presence of
[2:41:19] god and they come bearing his face to us
[2:41:21] they come bearing his presence to us and
[2:41:24] they change the atmosphere
[2:41:26] i just want to remind you of a time that
[2:41:29] brother brother billy paul
[2:41:32] was not sensitive
[2:41:35] he was meeting in the little trailer
[2:41:37] with his dad
[2:41:38] over some prayer requests and some mail
[2:41:40] that had come in
[2:41:42] and paul was running back and forth
[2:41:45] across there and his daddy told him not
[2:41:47] to do it and he did it again
[2:41:50] and his daddy swatted him like we all do
[2:41:52] i pray
[2:41:55] because there's a time to do it
[2:41:57] you just evidently got to know the time
[2:42:00] he swatted him on the
[2:42:02] seat of the pants
[2:42:04] as he went through there again and
[2:42:05] disobeyed his dad
[2:42:07] brother branham reached over and picked
[2:42:08] up his hat off the chair
[2:42:11] and put it on his head and left left he
[2:42:13] said dad
[2:42:14] we're not finished here he said no paul
[2:42:16] i'm doing oh billy i'm done
[2:42:21] he said everybody's got an angel the
[2:42:23] story came
[2:42:24] everybody's got an angel and when you
[2:42:25] swatted that
[2:42:27] swatted him that way you offended that
[2:42:29] boy's angel
[2:42:32] and i have to go
[2:42:33] i'm telling you folks that's powerful
[2:42:36] if you'll get get your mind as far
[2:42:38] around that as you possibly can
[2:42:40] it'll help you understand that every one
[2:42:43] of god's children
[2:42:44] have angels assigned to them
[2:42:48] we've got to remember that there's a
[2:42:50] time
[2:42:51] and a place for all things
[2:42:55] there's a time and a place for all
[2:42:56] things there's a protocol and an order
[2:42:58] for things
[2:43:00] i see people behaving in this sanctuary
[2:43:02] sometimes
[2:43:03] in ways that nobody ought to behave in a
[2:43:06] place that has been dedicated to the
[2:43:08] house of god
[2:43:10] and i'm not talking about running the
[2:43:11] aisle and i'm not talking about jumping
[2:43:13] and i'm not talking about praising the
[2:43:15] lord
[2:43:16] i'm talking about dragging in and out as
[2:43:19] you do
[2:43:20] i see people sometime leaving the
[2:43:22] service and greeting people all the way
[2:43:24] down the aisle
[2:43:25] there's a time to greet people
[2:43:28] it's going to be deathly quiet
[2:43:31] there's a time to kiss babies and hug
[2:43:32] folks
[2:43:34] there's a time to do that but there's a
[2:43:36] time not to do that
[2:43:38] and what you do in here you should be
[2:43:40] very very careful with
[2:43:42] because you may have run in at the last
[2:43:45] minute without any preparation to be
[2:43:47] here but i want you to know there are
[2:43:49] people sitting in this room today that
[2:43:51] prepared their hearts
[2:43:53] way before their bodies got here
[2:43:56] there are people that prayed for this
[2:43:58] service
[2:43:59] they're people that got up extra early
[2:44:02] to dedicate their heart and turn their
[2:44:05] heart toward the service that god would
[2:44:08] move and minister and you and i have an
[2:44:10] obligation
[2:44:12] to respect and honor that which is
[2:44:15] sacred
[2:44:16] and as i said a moment ago
[2:44:20] brother branham talked about angels
[2:44:23] he said fools walk with hobnailed shoes
[2:44:25] where angels fear to trod don't you be
[2:44:27] one of those fools
[2:44:32] longer we know one another and the
[2:44:33] longer we worship in the building the
[2:44:35] more familiar we become with one another
[2:44:37] the more familiar we become with this
[2:44:39] building
[2:44:40] brother branham was not a fanatic
[2:44:44] he preached church order but he was not
[2:44:47] a fanatic about church order
[2:44:49] he allowed it to be broken many many
[2:44:52] times on tape and blessed it
[2:44:58] he put the gifts in a room and then
[2:45:00] blessed the lord
[2:45:02] when they operated in the sanctuary
[2:45:08] never criticized
[2:45:10] even though there was an order set for
[2:45:12] the local church when someone would give
[2:45:15] still a message in tongues and
[2:45:17] interpretation that witnessed with his
[2:45:18] heart he would honor god and thank god
[2:45:21] for it
[2:45:23] sometimes calling the name of the person
[2:45:25] used
[2:45:26] so we would know who was used of god so
[2:45:29] he wasn't a fanatic didn't you hear
[2:45:30] brother greene talk about the time that
[2:45:32] he was at the tabernacle with a broom
[2:45:36] sweeping up he said i just didn't want
[2:45:37] to leave
[2:45:40] he said and i was had the broom there
[2:45:43] and i was trying to be careful that i
[2:45:45] didn't strike the broom against the pew
[2:45:49] he said the service was over we were
[2:45:51] dismissed everybody was out
[2:45:53] but he said i was trying to be
[2:45:55] respectful to the sanctuary and so i
[2:45:57] didn't even want the broom to clank
[2:45:59] against the chair or the pew and he said
[2:46:01] all of a sudden brother branham opened
[2:46:03] up the door of the study there and
[2:46:04] hollered out brother perry
[2:46:06] you want to go to breakfast in the
[2:46:07] morning
[2:46:12] and brother green he said i i
[2:46:14] i almost grabbed my chest
[2:46:17] he said here i am trying not to break
[2:46:19] make the broom make a clicking sound
[2:46:20] again and brother branham calls out real
[2:46:22] loud
[2:46:23] and i said
[2:46:24] that would be good
[2:46:27] he said what can't hear you
[2:46:31] he said i said that'll be fine
[2:46:34] now somebody said are you trying to tell
[2:46:35] me he didn't do what he said or practice
[2:46:38] what he preached i'm not saying that at
[2:46:39] all
[2:46:40] i'm telling you he knew that there's a
[2:46:42] balance
[2:46:47] in all things
[2:46:49] and when we forget
[2:46:50] that this is a sacred place
[2:46:54] then we're off balance
[2:46:57] i'm not going to call you down for
[2:46:58] worshiping the lord
[2:47:00] if you do it with sincerity of your
[2:47:02] heart and you do it not to draw
[2:47:04] attention to yourself but you do it to
[2:47:06] bring honor to the king
[2:47:08] i'm not going to call you down for
[2:47:10] praising the lord when it's time to
[2:47:11] praise the lord
[2:47:13] i'm not going to call you down or try to
[2:47:15] place you in some kind of restriction or
[2:47:17] bondage when you get so excited in the
[2:47:19] presence of god that you seemingly can't
[2:47:21] contain yourself
[2:47:23] and you jump or you dance or you holler
[2:47:25] or you raise your hands and praise god
[2:47:27] because i understand that you are in a
[2:47:30] battle
[2:47:33] you're in a battle i'm in a battle we're
[2:47:35] in a battle and it's not getting easier
[2:47:38] it seems to be getting harder
[2:47:41] and the strategy for dealing with these
[2:47:43] battles
[2:47:45] is to let praise go ahead of us not our
[2:47:48] emotions
[2:47:50] let praise go ahead of us
[2:47:52] i want the musicians to come i
[2:47:55] i'm not even on page two
[2:47:58] i have
[2:48:00] not preached
[2:48:03] i've just shared
[2:48:12] it's just a familiar
[2:48:14] battle
[2:48:20] we sometimes
[2:48:23] have to come back and
[2:48:27] realize
[2:48:31] people will
[2:48:32] sit here sometime and they'll say i'm
[2:48:34] just not going to raise my hand because
[2:48:36] somebody
[2:48:37] told me to raise my hand
[2:48:41] you you're just forgetting what it's all
[2:48:43] about
[2:48:47] we've had it here many many many times
[2:48:51] people act one way when the pastor's
[2:48:53] here
[2:48:55] in another way when the pastor's not
[2:48:57] here
[2:48:58] my band-aid is flapping around
[2:49:01] well don't you just took it off
[2:49:07] i thought you was bringing stitches
[2:49:09] you're going to sew it up or something
[2:49:13] we've had it here where
[2:49:16] if a certain worship leader was was
[2:49:19] leading
[2:49:20] people could really get in
[2:49:23] and if another one was
[2:49:25] they couldn't seem to enter in
[2:49:30] we've had evangelist after evangelists
[2:49:32] come through here and you shout them
[2:49:33] down
[2:49:36] and freeze me out on a sunday morning
[2:49:39] because i made a decision you didn't
[2:49:41] like
[2:49:42] and watch it get quiet
[2:49:44] i'm too far into this now to care
[2:49:48] i'd have cared about 20 minutes ago
[2:49:50] now i don't care
[2:49:51] come on now
[2:49:53] when we do like that you know what we're
[2:49:55] showing we're showing we're not in order
[2:49:58] we've missed what it's about
[2:50:01] you're not here for me
[2:50:04] you're not even worshiping because i'm
[2:50:06] telling you to worship
[2:50:08] you're here for him
[2:50:10] you came to meet him
[2:50:16] i found myself this morning sitting
[2:50:18] there i'm not the only one but i'm the
[2:50:21] only one that'll tell it
[2:50:23] i found myself sitting here this morning
[2:50:25] and i don't i don't i don't criticize
[2:50:27] benjamin's worship leading
[2:50:30] because i think it's outstanding
[2:50:32] and it's anointed
[2:50:35] and he's had a lot of criticism he's
[2:50:37] been criticized because he smiles
[2:50:41] don't react
[2:50:44] well he just smiles up there like it's a
[2:50:46] show or something
[2:50:48] don't react
[2:50:52] joey see i'm talking to you
[2:50:54] yeah
[2:50:58] or he wiggled a little bit
[2:51:01] moved a little bit
[2:51:02] cried a little bit
[2:51:04] and people sometimes don't like that
[2:51:10] was that beth
[2:51:16] you can't hold yourself she can't
[2:51:18] contain herself
[2:51:19] but the truth is i have sat
[2:51:24] in worship services
[2:51:28] where a worship leader stood right here
[2:51:30] like this not not here we never had one
[2:51:33] like this much well maybe one
[2:51:36] or two
[2:51:37] but not much
[2:51:41] never worship
[2:51:44] just song lead
[2:51:46] because you know in the message that's
[2:51:47] what it's called song leading
[2:51:50] just lead a song just sing a song
[2:51:54] i i whispered to benjamin i'm sure you
[2:51:56] heard me too
[2:51:58] this morning i said don't forget son
[2:52:02] lead us
[2:52:03] yes
[2:52:05] lead us
[2:52:08] it's not just singing the songs
[2:52:11] it's encouraging us by showing us the
[2:52:15] way.
[2:52:16] that's what a leader does he shows the
[2:52:18] way he don't just tell you to do it
[2:52:24] you can say a lot of things about me you
[2:52:26] can say a lot of things about him but
[2:52:28] you cannot say
[2:52:29] that we tell you to do what we're not
[2:52:31] willing to do
[2:52:33] i have led you into praise and worship
[2:52:35] by my own example for for nearly 30
[2:52:38] years plus
[2:52:40] because i have seen the importance of
[2:52:42] doing that
[2:52:44] so i was standing here this morning and
[2:52:46] those first two songs he sung are songs
[2:52:48] that i love
[2:52:51] but the thought came to my mind i wonder
[2:52:53] why he sung those back to back
[2:52:56] doesn't usually come this way son don't
[2:52:58] think it does
[2:53:00] but i was standing i wonder why he sung
[2:53:02] those songs back to back i don't know if
[2:53:04] i'd have done that or not
[2:53:07] i'm not sure i would have sung those
[2:53:09] songs back to back
[2:53:12] i wonder what he could have done instead
[2:53:13] of that
[2:53:16] very constructively my mind was trying
[2:53:19] to
[2:53:20] come up with a better plan
[2:53:26] why would you tell this because i ain't
[2:53:28] the only one
[2:53:32] and the next thing you know he's not on
[2:53:34] either one of them songs anymore
[2:53:37] but i have missed
[2:53:40] the first five minutes
[2:53:44] of my next opportunity
[2:53:48] because my mind was trying to think what
[2:53:51] he could have sung and i may have
[2:53:53] mentioned it i may have never mentioned
[2:53:55] it but i found myself thinking of what i
[2:53:58] could suggest that he sung that would
[2:54:00] have went along with that one and made
[2:54:02] way for the next one and then it don't
[2:54:03] know me i don't even know what the next
[2:54:05] one is
[2:54:08] cause i have checked out
[2:54:12] oh i'm preaching at me
[2:54:15] don't you let your carnal mind
[2:54:19] cheat you
[2:54:20] out of your opportunity
[2:54:26] there was a time i thought i would have
[2:54:28] never let some of these modern worship
[2:54:30] songs be sung where i was sitting
[2:54:34] and what i have come to understand is
[2:54:37] you don't have to like the style
[2:54:40] or the or or the or the age
[2:54:46] you don't even have to like all the
[2:54:48] words
[2:54:52] it ain't about that
[2:54:54] now tonight i'm going to the lord
[2:54:56] willing if i'm able i'm going to hear
[2:54:58] the callings we're saying
[2:55:00] over at the baptist church
[2:55:10] i probably shouldn't have told you i was
[2:55:12] going because some of you won't want to
[2:55:13] go
[2:55:16] the last time we were there i got really
[2:55:18] blessed
[2:55:19] we were listening to the hoppers and
[2:55:21] i think ben and ken maybe zach i don't
[2:55:23] remember how i was we had a whole row or
[2:55:24] two there and the baptist people sitting
[2:55:26] in front of us turned around
[2:55:30] and said you all are making this fun
[2:55:36] little life ain't going to hurt nobody
[2:55:40] i'm going to try to respect where i am
[2:55:43] i'm going to listen to the words i'm
[2:55:45] going to i i don't think i'm going to
[2:55:47] hear a style that i don't particularly
[2:55:49] care for i think i'm going to like that
[2:55:51] but i'm going to worship him i can't
[2:55:53] help it
[2:55:55] if they wanted to sell a ticket and have
[2:55:57] a concert they oughta done that
[2:55:59] but they put it in a church and when i
[2:56:01] get into church i cannot help myself
[2:56:06] i don't see myself running the aisle i
[2:56:08] don't see myself embarrassing you
[2:56:11] but i'm going to worship him
[2:56:14] come on now
[2:56:16] because i realize it's about him

[3:00:01] i try to worship no matter who's singing
[3:00:04] they sing specials
[3:00:06] i try to worship with them
[3:00:09] because i know it's not a concert
[3:00:12] somebody gets up here in front of folks
[3:00:14] and sings
[3:00:16] it ain't easy
[3:00:19] i i try to give my

[3:00:30] i try not to do things like that
[3:00:33] because we're one big family

[3:00:39] of god

[3:09:58] just play
[3:10:00] i want to read this to you as you play
[3:10:02] keep playing it
[3:10:04] you weren't here some of you weren't
[3:10:05] here tuesday night
[3:10:07] there's hardly a
[3:10:09] a service that i don't make a quote but
[3:10:11] i usually read one
[3:10:14] i checked myself this week i took this
[3:10:17] quote home and studied it against all
[3:10:18] the other quotes
[3:10:21] i made a document i'll share with you if
[3:10:23] you like
[3:10:24] it was it was
[3:10:26] all the quotations i could find i'm
[3:10:28] still looking for some
[3:10:30] where brother branham said when that
[3:10:31] which is perfect has come
[3:10:33] and almost every time he says that he
[3:10:36] says his love
[3:10:38] almost every time almost every time
[3:10:42] it's a very very rare reference that he
[3:10:44] says something about the word almost
[3:10:46] every time he says it's perfect love
[3:10:49] when that which is perfect has come
[3:10:50] almost every time
[3:10:54] but i
[3:10:55] wanted to check myself out
[3:10:58] this is a quote that i think you ought
[3:10:59] to hold on to
[3:11:01] because the enemy would like to talk you
[3:11:03] out of your experience
[3:11:05] i shared this
[3:11:07] i went back and studied two church ages
[3:11:09] excuse me two church orders that he
[3:11:11] preached
[3:11:12] and this sermon was after both of them
[3:11:14] after both of them he said this
[3:11:17] after the seals were preached he said
[3:11:19] this
[3:11:21] after all the things he said about that
[3:11:23] which is perfect has come he said this
[3:11:26] so put this in the right balance
[3:11:29] it's the message thirst
[3:11:31] it's paragraph 236
[3:11:33] you have nothing to apologize for if you
[3:11:36] have an experience with god you have
[3:11:38] nothing to apologize for
[3:11:41] this is what he believed this is what he
[3:11:43] told us was coming he said wait
[3:11:46] now i want you to see the date again
[3:11:50] 9 19
[3:11:52] september the 19th
[3:11:54] 1965
[3:11:59] three months he's gone
[3:12:03] church ages preach seals preached
[3:12:06] both church orders preached
[3:12:08] every quote he makes
[3:12:10] about that which is perfect is come that
[3:12:12] which is in part is done away with all
[3:12:14] preached
[3:12:15] and yet he comes in september of 65
[3:12:18] and says this wait till that
[3:12:20] satisfaction comes
[3:12:22] [Music]
[3:12:24] the satisfaction portion of the fullness
[3:12:27] of the holy spirit comes in
[3:12:31] then these joy bells of shouting
[3:12:35] and speaking in tongues
[3:12:38] and dancing in the spirit
[3:12:40] will come
[3:12:42] anybody with me
[3:12:44] you won't have to do it by the music
[3:12:48] you will do it when you're going down
[3:12:51] the road in your car
[3:12:53] [Music]
[3:12:55] now that is not to say that you can't do
[3:12:58] it in god's house it's only saying when
[3:13:01] you get the real thing you don't have to
[3:13:04] have the drums to shout
[3:13:05] you don't have to have the piano to
[3:13:07] shout you can worship god talk in
[3:13:10] tongues
[3:13:11] and scream out hallelujah driving down
[3:13:14] the road when the real satisfaction let
[3:13:16] me read you'll do it when you're going
[3:13:18] down the road in your car you'll do it
[3:13:20] when you're sweeping the floor you'll do
[3:13:22] it when you're driving nails in the wall
[3:13:24] with your carpenter work
[3:13:26] wherever you are
[3:13:30] that joy
[3:13:32] unspeakable
[3:13:33] and full of glory
[3:13:36] i like the balance
[3:13:38] sing something else sing a little more
[3:13:39] of that whatever you need to do
[3:13:42] we're not having service tonight don't
[3:13:44] usually so we might as well squeeze
[3:13:46] every moment out of this one we possibly
[3:13:48] can but if you're not going to worship
[3:13:50] then there'll be no need we just go but
[3:13:52] if you want to have a little more i do i
[3:13:54] need it i'll be honest i need a little
[3:13:56] more i need just a little more time in
