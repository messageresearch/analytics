[0:59] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of
[1:02] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:05] Station Alabama and it's always a
[1:08] delight to come to you on the gospel
[1:10] Channel what beautiful days we have to
[1:14] serve the Lord and we are so excited
[1:16] about what God is doing what we're
[1:19] seeing the Lord accomplished
[1:21] we're excited about the outreach of
[1:23] Christian television we believe that as
[1:26] we have said many times before there's a
[1:29] lot of garbage on the television but God
[1:33] is using the television to take the
[1:36] gospel to the far reaches of the world
[1:39] I'm very blessed today and extremely
[1:43] honored to have in our studio in Alabama
[1:48] the founder and CEO of Omega television
[1:52] and the gospel channel brother Eric
[1:54] Erickson he was with us here a year and
[1:58] a half ago when we dedicated this studio
[2:02] to the Lord by a miracle the Lord
[2:05] provided the equipment that we needed to
[2:07] be able to come to you on a regular
[2:09] basis and he came all the way from
[2:12] Iceland to pray a dedication prayer and
[2:15] to be a part of the camp meeting and so
[2:18] it's really exciting to have him with us
[2:21] at this time brother Erickson we are
[2:23] delighted that you are with us in
[2:26] Alabama yep it's a privilege it's a
[2:28] wonderful time and opportunity to be
[2:32] here with you and all these wonderful
[2:35] people here and coming and to know
[2:38] everything is going so well here from
[2:40] the studio and how God had been given
[2:45] opportunity for you to take wonderful
[2:48] program here many different people and I
[2:52] feel it the very excited and when I come
[2:55] here in a stroller studio I say wow this
[2:57] is wonderful I want to copy and paste
[3:00] this through the people last time
[3:02] because it is a very comfortable it is
[3:05] very very good you know yeah I'm glad
[3:08] you've interviewed me many times on the
[3:11] gospel channel from Iceland yeah but
[3:14] this is my first time to interview you
[3:17] and before we started you were asking me
[3:20] about the camera shots and it just it
[3:24] made me laugh inside because it reminded
[3:26] me this this is must be a little turned
[3:28] around for you because you often do the
[3:31] interviewing and now you're on the spot
[3:33] I get to ask you questions yes and I'm
[3:36] maybe have the same feeling like the
[3:40] people that is coming to Castellano
[3:43] studio and I'm setting I'm hosting the
[3:45] pro right and they are so many time very
[3:48] nerve yes and when I sit down here I
[3:51] have a little bit nervous you know if
[3:52] any oh wow this is think you know good
[3:55] because you know you're not in confident
[3:57] you never know what I'm going to end
[3:59] yeah I want to start off by reading a
[4:02] scripture before we and start asking
[4:04] questions but I felt like the Lord laid
[4:08] a verse of scripture on my heart to
[4:10] share with all of you from the 28th
[4:12] Psalm and when I think about brother
[4:16] Eric Erickson and I think about the
[4:19] gospel channel I think about the
[4:21] beautiful people of Iceland because
[4:24] that's where it started and I think
[4:26] about how they have so faithfully prayed
[4:29] and supported the gospel channel so that
[4:32] now it's across Scandinavia and across
[4:36] the UK and in so many different places
[4:39] when I think of what God is accomplished
[4:42] with just a handful of people and what
[4:45] he is accomplishing today this scripture
[4:47] I think is very very appropriate in
[4:49] Psalm 28 and verse 7 it says the Lord is
[4:54] my strength and my shield my heart
[5:00] trusted in him and I am helped therefore
[5:06] my heart greatly rejoice it and with my
[5:10] saw
[5:11] will I praise him the Lord is their
[5:16] strength and listen and he is the saving
[5:20] strength of his anointed save thy people
[5:24] and bless thine inheritance feed them
[5:28] also and lift them up forever
[5:32] these are encouraging verses of
[5:34] Scripture and I believe that that's
[5:37] exactly what the Lord has done in the
[5:39] life and ministry of brother Eric
[5:41] Erickson in the gospel Channel he has
[5:44] been the saving strength of his anointed
[5:48] I believe my brother that you are a man
[5:51] called for a job and I think I've heard
[5:54] you say before that you were the most
[5:56] unlikely but God saw it differently
[5:59] that's how you saw yourself but I
[6:01] believe that when God looked at you he
[6:03] said that's the man for the job and it
[6:06] must have been true because here you are
[6:09] after all these years still still doing
[6:11] such a wonderful work for the Lord I
[6:14] would like for you to share with the
[6:16] people today your testimony of how you
[6:18] found the Lord your childhood a little
[6:21] bit yes where did you start it started
[6:24] in that way I mean every summer from for
[6:28] six years old I go to my grandfather
[6:32] and move it it was far away from the
[6:35] capital city it was in East part of
[6:38] Iceland and I call that every summer and
[6:41] my grandfather he was a really
[6:45] great men he was a very quick and very
[6:48] serious and but what he did he helped me
[6:52] to have a Lord's Prayer every night and
[6:56] he put his hand on my chest you know and
[7:00] they and we have the Lord's Prayer
[7:03] together and he did it every single
[7:07] night every time I was there and for six
[7:11] summer and then I very thankful for that
[7:17] because I know God was real he was far
[7:20] away and but I knew that this was the
[7:24] prayer I think that that was very
[7:26] important and many time I maybe just
[7:31] repeat the Lord's Prayer but it's sink
[7:35] into my life right exactly and we know
[7:39] that it's time you know the God knows
[7:43] and also we know the devil is real yes
[7:46] like Jesus absolutely and I have a
[7:49] wonderful father a mother but like the
[7:53] devil is coming in one day another he
[7:55] the divorce mmm and I was just four or
[7:59] five years and my mother she was quite
[8:03] sick she has asthma and she was not easy
[8:07] to take care of and so I remember that I
[8:11] I was put in some places where children
[8:16] born where they have no mother or no
[8:18] mother
[8:18] and so I was there you know just alone
[8:22] sometime I thought you know where are my
[8:24] father where I'm a mother I'm not seen
[8:26] and for a long time you know but I
[8:28] thought it was just a normal you know to
[8:31] be there in with all other children and
[8:34] but when I was with my grandfather it
[8:39] was quite a good time
[8:42] nice fellowship with all of the people
[8:45] that was there like a family but you
[8:49] know that the devil's real and and
[8:51] something took place you know the devil
[8:54] came to me the Bible said Satan himself
[8:57] he can take a form on the internal life
[9:00] absolutely and so he came in some way
[9:03] and and he fooled me and we know that in
[9:07] Iceland it was very superstition
[9:10] believing that people live in a rock by
[9:13] God and there was a man a boy like me
[9:20] same age he he was in communication with
[9:24] something you know he said this is the
[9:27] people I am in in a communication with
[9:29] and I was very curious because I was
[9:33] very hungry to know more
[9:34] sure and so he will always tell me about
[9:38] what he explains so and but he said you
[9:42] know they quite don't speak about it you
[9:45] know don't share about it you know if
[9:48] you if you share about it it will be
[9:50] will call a curse on our life oh yeah
[9:52] Wow be very helpful you knows he said so
[9:56] I was all at America very carefully I
[9:59] didn't want to put a curse on my life
[10:02] but when I was 12 years old I have a
[10:06] grandmother that was such a loving
[10:08] grandmother she took care of me and my
[10:11] mother was so sick she couldn't take
[10:13] care of me she loved me so much you know
[10:16] and I loved her so much you know and one
[10:19] day I maybe thought maybe as here with
[10:22] her about what had been said about my
[10:24] life that will be cross on my life if I
[10:29] will expose or tell about these people
[10:31] so I was very afraid you know told my my
[10:33] grandmother and she hurt me and but she
[10:37] didn't recognize how thin so serious but
[10:41] that has a very negative active-active
[10:43] on my life in effect on my life because
[10:46] he when I start to think about
[10:48] everything was working wrong with me you
[10:51] know I was not happy in school
[10:53] I did not feel any purpose to learn
[10:55] algebra I didn't see nothing purposely
[10:58] and so I was very curious or I go astray
[11:02] you know I start to smoke and drink even
[11:06] 12 years old
[11:07] wow that's young yo you're high things
[11:09] you know because my father mother did
[11:12] not watch me I I could live my life as I
[11:16] want but I was very very excited to find
[11:21] what life have to give then they came a
[11:25] tightening toughness in my life so much
[11:27] you know and I always thought you know
[11:29] this occurs on my life
[11:30] they say Eric there's a curse on your
[11:32] life and so I did bothered me very much
[11:36] you know
[11:36] and so the boy that was with me and when
[11:43] he was about 20 years he just killed
[11:46] himself you know
[11:46] oh and so the devil always told me
[11:50] hearing you next Wow and then I got to
[11:54] some working outside reykjavik in some
[11:58] farm outside i was there as a worker and
[12:02] there was a old lady there that was very
[12:07] sometimes he could be very upset you
[12:09] know
[12:10] and one times I was doing something that
[12:14] she's not too you know and she said you
[12:18] know go to die and I I was scared to
[12:21] death you know because I thought okay
[12:23] and they said you know there was a boy
[12:25] before me and that in his farm and he
[12:28] said the same to him and he killed
[12:30] himself
[12:31] oh my so I always thought I was the next
[12:34] one I'm sure and so I I go in a very
[12:37] very deep darkness and I in myself I
[12:43] always say believe God that he was far
[12:45] away
[12:46] and when I was 13 years old I live alive
[12:51] I was so desperately I want to kill
[12:53] myself I have been
[12:56] fighting with some boys and they was
[12:58] putting cold water on me and making fun
[13:02] you know and so conspiracy against me
[13:05] you know so I was very upset I I haven't
[13:07] arrived and I thought I want to kill
[13:10] myself you know and so I was so
[13:13] desperately you know then I heard a
[13:15] voice you know someone said to me Eric
[13:19] you allowed to go to movie today all the
[13:22] children at the farm so I certainly I
[13:26] forget you know and so I remember that
[13:29] we go to the town and there was a film
[13:32] that I saw called Ben okay Ben Hur
[13:35] yes
[13:36] and both of my friend that was a we was
[13:39] fighting one set my right and other or
[13:42] the left and then we start to watch this
[13:45] movie were very excited child Heston and
[13:48] it's a very great movie and then I came
[13:52] up scene where suddenly Jesus show him
[13:56] up in the film and I start to watch you
[14:00] know and I saw in the film you know when
[14:02] Jesus a he touched the people and he got
[14:05] healed you know and like that and I I
[14:07] just start to cry you know and I also
[14:11] see em because my friend you know move
[14:13] on with left on the right side you know
[14:16] I I was in sestra trouble you I try all
[14:19] my best not to to cry you know and I was
[14:22] so touched you know Wow
[14:23] and I felt Jesus is a wonderful you know
[14:26] wow just amazing you know and then after
[14:32] I we left the movie I I was allowed to
[14:35] sleep at my mother house in town so
[14:41] before I came as a big apartment on the
[14:44] pit for my mother lived there so I was
[14:47] certainly and I came to that house and
[14:50] people go in
[14:53] have a cigarette you know and so I want
[14:56] to smoke but I said you know Eric you
[14:59] cannot smoke Jesus you if you love Jesus
[15:03] and what can you do for Jesus what did
[15:06] Jesus do for you what can you do for him
[15:08] and if you if you are smoking your sin
[15:11] your sin against God but the negative
[15:15] was so strong you know I I I have a
[15:18] smoke you know and I'm had a very bad
[15:21] feeling you know and I came in my home
[15:25] at the mall that place and then people

[15:37] sendin you break the law you are you are
[15:39] not good boy and now you come to ask for
[15:43] for for prayer and forgiveness you know

[15:51] Jesus only in years old only person that
[15:54] really loved me you know
[15:56] I knew and I was betraying him you know

[16:01] that time I didn't know that them I
[16:03] could ask Jesus to fork in write and
[16:07] mention what he had done for me and to
[16:09] ask him to help me to live a Christian
[16:12] life help me to get rid of the topic you

[21:24] to whom waiting for the oft call and
[21:27] then the optical creme because I was in
[21:29] the middle of it so many people came
[21:31] forward so I have to have a go to the
[21:34] small room and when I was just a
[21:38] kneeling in a small room nobody was

[24:35] he was always very kind to me and so I
[24:39] looked to me because he was here oh you
[24:40] he was he he he was strong everybody was
[24:44] praying with him you know he was my
[24:46] friend you know so you were honored to
[24:49] heaven in my room you know in the middle
[24:52] night will he was speaking to me up with
[24:54] Jesus you know and I thought about I
[24:56] could not argue with him you know and so
[24:59] so he said you know Eric this is truth
[25:02] because
[25:04] one of my friend that was been in a
[25:05] prison one time we broke out of the
[25:08] prison
[25:09] we took the the keeper of the prisoner
[25:12] but we took a many men close meant to
[25:15] the prison and it took the key from him
[25:17] and we just escaped from the prison Oh
[25:22] the pole it was after the whole nation
[25:24] on the ratin everybody wore blue
[25:27] government and that night he said you
[25:29] know now my friend he know the Bible he
[25:33] say no more drugs no more alcohol you
[25:37] have to control listen to him so that
[25:39] was how I came first time to hurt very
[25:43] powerful preaching Pentecostal very
[25:46] powerful you know Jesus a life free man
[25:50] him and so so okay getting people to
[25:55] come to meeting that was very typical
[25:57] but so I thought you know III wanting I
[26:00] know where they are they are now at home
[26:03] watching the TV why not to have a
[26:06] Christian TV in I thought it was
[26:09] something that came to my mind you know
[26:10] but this was on 7576 so this is the
[26:16] beginning that I knew to reaching out to
[26:19] people were through the media because
[26:21] the people are there and people have a
[26:24] free will and they can choose right
[26:26] absolutely and so this is a amazing how
[26:31] God brought me out of darkness came new
[26:34] life and then I knew that I want to do
[26:38] something for the Lord I like I want to
[26:40] like the big guy I want to like appellee
[26:43] grahame you know I and one of my
[26:46] favorite William million per annum
[26:49] that was my favor you know Siham polio
[26:52] knows as a godly man with such a
[26:55] wonderful powerful things in in their
[26:57] life healing to place you know
[26:59] absolutely I were watching cutting
[27:01] Coleman a Alan you know and so I want to
[27:04] feel like back up random like a pillock
[27:07] Raya make some order rope as you know
[27:09] then a lot told me Eric maybe they would
[27:14] like to be like you
[27:15] yes of course uh uh everybody had the
[27:17] same same opportunity to set the Lord
[27:20] and so Lord show me what are they doing
[27:23] why are why are I using them
[27:26] that's a good question so think about
[27:29] why are they use backup are they special
[27:33] maybe they have a special calling
[27:35] special office but what was that took
[27:38] them to function in Langley because I
[27:41] knew that prayers and fasting and
[27:45] seeking God wholeheartedly and they paid
[27:47] the price full price in the full price
[27:49] and they lay on the floor the whole
[27:52] night praying seeking God and having
[27:55] breakthrough like I was reading from the
[27:58] daughter of Billy Graham she said you
[28:00] know want many time in the early in Prak
[28:02] first in the morning I knew my dad had
[28:05] been praying the whole night he had such
[28:08] a fight with the devil you know and so
[28:12] we know that a Alan he locks him inside
[28:16] the room he was fasting and praying and
[28:19] he said to her if I don't open the door
[28:21] unless something will take place you
[28:24] know at a long time he has a really
[28:27] experienced from the Lord and God showed
[28:30] himself spoke to him out openly and they
[28:33] and
[28:34] this is same things with all over like
[28:37] when I have been studying blood random
[28:40] you know I I knew he was a young man he
[28:42] was not little Lord he was a rebellion
[28:47] against God you know there's a young boy
[28:48] yes but he called through lot of tough
[28:51] times so he came to the Lord and God
[28:54] left him a pen and gave him most
[28:56] powerful ministry I believe that anybody
[28:59] had in a lifetime I agree yeah and so so
[29:03] that was very inspiration for me or I
[29:06] were used to listen Katherine Kuhlman I
[29:08] have a one tape you know I thought all
[29:10] think about the power the place of the
[29:13] Lord how God can use a woman that is so
[29:17] skinny so thin you know this is a
[29:19] healing power so skinny you know so so I
[29:25] thought you know I was so thirsty for
[29:28] the Lord well I said lord I will give
[29:30] everything so can use me I want to I
[29:34] don't care I want to slay be in a one
[29:37] room with a one pet and was the one I I
[29:39] don't care I want the Holy Ghost I want
[29:42] to use by you I want to and i pray lord
[29:46] help me to reach out to millions of
[29:48] people and I knew the people say if we
[29:51] pray according to his will right we'll
[29:54] hear the pray amen
[29:56] so I oh that's good I say lord please
[29:59] help me to leech of millions of people
[30:01] for you and even sir you know mm-hmm
[30:03] this was when a 7576 yet I was in Norway
[30:08] I asked his prayer so now we are in a
[30:11] network in Europe Scandinavia Iceland
[30:14] reaching million no house exactly and I
[30:17] believe that we will go further
[30:19] absolutely absolutely this was a
[30:23] fantastic so how did how did this the
[30:27] network start I I know the Lord put the
[30:30] burden in your heart to reach millions
[30:31] of people yeah but you you must have not
[30:34] started with a million people you you
[30:36] must have been reaching feeling
[30:40] my humble beginnings I started with a
[30:42] small 1000 transmitted radio
[30:44] transmission 1986 I laugh every time in
[30:48] 1986 you're speaking to a neighborhood
[30:51] maybe maybe yes yes it was but it was a
[30:55] good stuff it was a good start because
[30:57] you were proving you were proving your
[31:00] desire little is much when God is in it
[31:03] and you were faithful over the little
[31:05] things and it was amazing I remember
[31:07] 1986 when we put the signal on the radio
[31:11] and we start to play the the the music
[31:14] and we spoke in God's Word and being
[31:16] with people to call in we did it very
[31:19] silently we didn't want to behave a big
[31:22] blow you know we just was on air we
[31:25] start to broadcast people's tuning back
[31:27] and forth and certainly we came up to
[31:29] the phone number please you can call if
[31:31] you have a prayer request whatsoever and
[31:33] the peel and the phone start or end you
[31:35] know amazingly avow someone was
[31:39] listening he are so many more than we
[31:41] thought you know amazing and so so I
[31:43] stay with that ratio for two and half
[31:46] years two and a half years and that was
[31:48] a lot of fight because the past or they
[31:53] just misunderstood things you know they
[31:56] thought they should have control of the
[32:00] radio station they said you make we will
[32:02] not help us we will be here and saying
[32:06] what to do so there was a fight you know
[32:08] and and put some really fight you know I
[32:10] was not happy about that you know and
[32:12] then then I start to think about it you
[32:15] know the Lord spoke to me in so clear
[32:17] way to reaching out to the whole world
[32:20] so so I thought you okay
[32:23] I will just use another way I want to
[32:26] have a powerful radio short-day and
[32:30] reaching from Iceland all over the world
[32:32] pow sure because a short day they go
[32:34] order of wall of the road so I thought
[32:36] this is answer so I go to America I
[32:39] stayed for six month see an exhibition
[32:42] they want to raise up a very powerful
[32:47] radio transmitter in Iceland
[32:50] and that kosta 1/2 million dollar and
[32:53] what about this was shoot but we knew
[32:56] nothing was impossible for God right so
[32:58] I I was in America 6 month with my
[33:02] family mmm Daniel was a small he was
[33:05] three years old when he came to America
[33:08] with me and my thought it was 2 years
[33:10] and we staying at Tucson and I was
[33:14] sharing the vision that God put in my
[33:16] heart and people were listening you know
[33:19] they was very excited you know and I saw
[33:22] the map and I show them how we can reach
[33:24] from Iceland all over the world you know
[33:26] but someone said to me one pastor Eric I
[33:29] have to confess that you know this sound
[33:31] like a smoke in air for me but now I can
[33:34] say things are real he said you know and
[33:38] so when I came back to Iceland I I was
[33:43] with a kids small kids and wife and I
[33:47] said you know I have to do something to
[33:49] live you know so I came to my mind you
[33:52] know I want to do something business you
[33:54] know so I said you know a carpet
[33:56] cleaning company that's easy you know I
[33:58] can work hard you know and then I have a
[34:01] time to serve the Lord right so I put
[34:06] some machine you know good machine you
[34:09] know little bit you know good price you
[34:12] know so I make business card from
[34:18] processor and I start to go to company
[34:21] offer the service you know and so we
[34:25] came to one company that was renting a
[34:29] cleaning machine and there was all
[34:32] couple there you know and they was
[34:33] trying to get some rent some equipment
[34:36] it was a really trouble so he came to
[34:39] bid my business card you know and they
[34:40] said you you can maybe help us you can
[34:43] maybe clean our house
[34:45] and as I certainly haven't do that you
[34:48] know
[34:49] and my heart starts to beat you know I
[34:50] have never done it before you know hmm
[34:52] this is a nice machine I have pocket you
[34:54] know I have never used it before so I
[34:57] called my wife and we have to go in this
[35:00] to this place we have to clean the house
[35:04] so I came there you know there was a
[35:06] whole nice couple you know they show me
[35:09] that the living room and carpeting and
[35:12] in the stairway and in a statement why
[35:15] Wow Austin I've never pushed it on me

[35:23] have a clean carpet I always say to me
[35:35] mama so put the words it is you know and
[35:43] many people get out I was a pretty good
[35:47] power on you know starting all this is
[35:49] working very well you know so did he
[35:54] clean all the houses you know and they
[35:57] all cover the big smile you know this is
[36:00] want to be see such things on a carpet
[36:03] and they just pay that was the beginning
[36:08] a great business you know I did a great
[36:11] business you know Wow
[36:12] and then we have a company we have a
[36:14] cleaning company and and and then later
[36:16] a I hire my uncle you know and we were
[36:20] still in great job you know mmm and then
[36:22] one morning 8 o'clock 19 1 8 8 8 o'clock
[36:28] eight or nine that God spoke to me
[36:32] before the day I things are very cold
[36:35] dark outside I were feeling flu and I
[36:39] would not feel good you know I was
[36:41] feeling diamond force in air
[36:44] and I said wow I am just dying in
[36:48] Iceland you know it is a clean or rate
[36:51] or nothing to do just cleaning carpet
[36:54] you know so I could wake up early in the
[36:57] morning go to the bathroom and suddenly
[36:59] the light came you know and I felt the
[37:03] Lord speaking to me in a cesta clear way
[37:06] I want you to build me a Christian TV
[37:09] station realized Wow
[37:11] and so I put my hand like this you know
[37:13] a lot I I know that you're speaking to
[37:15] me I want to open you because you will
[37:17] speak it to me this is why I want to
[37:19] obey show of my wife see wake up you
[37:21] know I said you know God spoke to me to
[37:24] start the Christian TV station oh he
[37:26] said you know with a big guy you know be
[37:29] very careful in the voice of reason
[37:35] yeah be very careful I said yes of
[37:38] course you know and I knew what it mean
[37:40] you know I have to go to the small
[37:41] trailer room then he was still sleeping
[37:45] you know when he was still sleeping you
[37:47] know and then I kneeled down you know I
[37:50] pray the one now at two one and I
[37:53] certainly felt the Spirit of the Lord
[37:55] you know I say all things possible you
[37:57] know who would strengthen me Amen so III
[38:00] was say I knew I had son I think I have
[38:04] some faith sure I saw it was possible
[38:07] you know and so I start to think where
[38:11] can I get the transmitter but I need her
[38:14] license before ok there's a lot yes yes
[38:17] so so I asked for the government to give
[38:21] me license to have a Christian
[38:23] television so very soon I have the
[38:26] letter from the government we have
[38:28] granted you this request so I I have to
[38:31] go to that office and of course with my
[38:34] wife she's a saucers things as an
[38:37] important person you know and we came to
[38:41] this government office and people
[38:43] sitting that very seriously you know no
[38:45] smiling you know
[38:47] and their wonderful facility is a
[38:49] generic are you sure what your to make
[38:51] do you know what it costs to make it
[38:53] just the one hour in a national TV I
[38:57] said yes yes I know yeah no problem yeah
[39:00] I know yeah just my league you know need
[39:03] and then they have uh some nice document
[39:09] you know and and the the person that was
[39:12] the initiator of this is a generica I
[39:14] have to confess you're the most
[39:16] obstinate person I ever met in my life
[39:18] hmm I we don't know but we will give you
[39:21] this crisis and sign my letter you know
[39:25] I was and then I say say goodbye so we
[39:31] go to the car old Citroen car shut the
[39:36] door with the document with a license my
[39:40] wife was sitting by my side you know I
[39:41] started to thank God for this Jesus
[39:44] thank you yes we have no transmitted we
[39:47] have no money but we have the lies we
[39:50] have a license and then we put the car
[39:54] on race committee it was a car seat on
[39:56] the left and after you know it was one
[39:58] of the less than that because there were
[40:00] many tables of snow in Iceland so it had
[40:02] to lift the math you know so I could
[40:05] upgrade it so this was the beginning you
[40:09] know and then later I found out the
[40:13] company in East part well where they
[40:17] have a TV
[40:19] small TV network and I asked him to you
[40:22] have a transmitter available and he said
[40:26] you know properly we have a transmitted
[40:28] ten mods properly we we can sell or
[40:33] whatsoever how call me at the Banach I
[40:37] and I did you know they said you know
[40:38] yeah we can rent this to you and
[40:42] appropriate was are about twenty
[40:44] thousand Icelandic króna at that time
[40:46] that's about like
[40:51] $200 today but at that time you know
[40:55] that it's more now it's like a thousand
[40:57] $2,000 so I said yes that would be fine
[41:00] you know and okay we sent you that
[41:03] transmitter and then we found out you
[41:07] know the transmitter was a children to
[41:10] channel 59 so we have to change that
[41:16] frequency to channel 45 but because this
[41:19] was quite all transmitted so I said you
[41:23] know have you some talk of and talk
[41:24] about it that the transmitted no okay we
[41:28] we will do our best
[41:30] the birthday the government people that
[41:32] said you know we want to have the money
[41:33] and the front you know is a quite work
[41:36] and people they they thought he was just
[41:40] good idea but there was very serious so
[41:44] I said yes of course I understand that
[41:46] so I start to speak to some of my
[41:49] friends and one of the friend he said
[41:52] you know he was a former priest to the
[41:54] priest he said Eric no problem I will go
[41:57] to the churches and we will get the
[41:59] money that is needed that was about
[42:01] thousand dollars something like that so
[42:04] I said you know I was not so positive
[42:08] that he will come with money from not
[42:10] journey but they didn't say nothing you
[42:13] know then left if six weeks he he came
[42:15] you know he said Eric I'm very
[42:18] disappointed nobody want to help nobody
[42:22] nobody nobody want to help and so I
[42:27] continued to pray as I spoke to some
[42:29] company and I had to speak to them
[42:32] several time you know and one of my
[42:34] friend is wrote a check and and small
[42:36] church gave at ten thousand and then I
[42:39] finally came with the money and they
[42:40] would pick a smile you noted and they
[42:43] said oh yes we will work on the soon we
[42:45] will call you when we finished then one
[42:49] week later I have a phone call and the
[42:52] man said generic you have to come yes I
[42:55] I want the communist on these things
[42:57] voice you know so I have the world cup
[43:00] fourth floor stairway no elevator you
[43:02] know
[43:02] when they came on top I like it and they
[43:06] look to me very sad you know he said you
[43:08] know I'm be sorry but it didn't work you
[43:11] know you cannot use it transmitters oh
[43:13] no and I was almost paralyzed you know
[43:17] grab a try I'm a throat you know I say I
[43:20] don't understand you know I was sought
[43:23] as I was a darkness you know in my mind
[43:24] you know so I I have to go home and told
[43:31] my wife you know this is very strange we
[43:34] are not allowed to use the transmitter
[43:36] it was like a furnace of course this was
[43:39] like as someone had died you know
[43:41] because you were so close yes yes yes
[43:43] yes and I and then the phone ring I can
[43:46] you and I pick the phone the same voice
[43:49] you said you have to come again so I I
[43:52] saw a drove down working the fourth
[43:55] floor and said you know he said you know
[43:57] Eric you have to you must have been
[43:59] praying because we found out you can use
[44:02] the transmitter
[44:04] it was just a human mister praise God
[44:08] there's a scale you know we magnified
[44:11] too much you know you it's normal you
[44:14] can use it unbelievable and then like
[44:17] wow I thought was this was multiple use
[44:19] and then was another step you know it's
[44:24] needed some Mota later motivated is that
[44:27] you take the video signals into some
[44:30] piece and it will convert it to radio
[44:34] frequency to fit the transmitter okay
[44:36] and that cost about Iceland Colin three
[44:39] hundred thousand kronor that time I've
[44:41] also quite good morning but I had to
[44:44] have it you know and and I had not the
[44:47] money so I was very very think about
[44:52] that you know then I had someone that
[44:56] came to me he said you know my former
[45:01] son you know when I was young boy you
[45:03] know I
[45:04] I had some Sun you know everything broke
[45:07] up because the life story I will explain
[45:09] it
[45:10] yeah in the book you know it's excellent
[45:11] it's a long story but I want to say you
[45:14] know my son young son you know he was
[45:17] about 18 17 18 you know he said that I
[45:22] have a money in a bank I want to help
[45:26] you I want to loan him money
[45:28] mmm and yeah he said you I want to help
[45:32] you with the money and I said yes okay I
[45:34] want get the money alone but you know
[45:36] you know what you do is this is just a
[45:38] little small risk you know and he said
[45:41] okay no problem no problem so he was
[45:44] able to order the the the motor later
[45:46] and and the motor later came and we was
[45:52] able to fix it and we was on 28th of
[45:55] July we was the first Christian TV
[45:59] station in Iceland for 24 hours and was
[46:02] like a paper was born I'm sure and my
[46:05] song that gave me 300,000 I paid back to
[46:09] him you know even more but God bless and
[46:13] finally today he have a multi-million
[46:16] business you know and he has a lot of
[46:19] money you know god bless him in such a
[46:21] mighty way and I also found out there
[46:24] was a person I was helping in the
[46:26] beginning with the raise the transmitter
[46:29] he came his what carpenter he said you
[46:31] know Eddie I am willing to help you but
[46:33] you please you have to help me to have a
[46:35] like a hammer and different things you
[46:37] know he was so cool you know and he
[46:41] helped me later few years later he has a
[46:44] big company many work many people
[46:47] working for him he was doing such a
[46:49] group section meeting picking building
[46:51] you know and so we found you know the
[46:54] people that he refused to help me they
[46:56] are no longer pastors everything was
[46:59] wrong wrong wrong with them you know
[47:01] they was against me you know not because
[47:04] they didn't understand you know God
[47:06] helped me and God they gave me favor
[47:09] with brother sister from many different
[47:12] churches and we have stayed now in July
[47:15] for 27 years day and night this coming
[47:19] July yes will be 27 years yeah
[47:22] and and it is everything it is a just
[47:26] God's grace you know I cannot post I

[48:38] was most unlikely like the devil tried
[48:41] to kill me you know I caught through
[48:43] such a struggle you know I was in a
[48:46] darkness but Jesus came in Alleluia and
[48:49] he and and I knew that you is he has a
[48:52] purpose and the amazing thing my mother
[48:54] she mentioned many times many she was
[48:57] living outside
[48:58] Reykjavik in countryside there were no
[49:01] electric no phone nothing no doctor far
[49:05] away from anybody she was so sick when

[49:16] with a shining light and he cityscape
[49:21] inanity taylean on in theaters and see
[49:26] code to sleep and she woke up totally
[49:29] healed so I knew that the Lord he is

[50:18] Pentecostal church they have a Tuesday
[50:21] meeting at Wednesday always kneeling

[52:36] staying in communication with God yeah
[52:40] yeah kneel in town don't stand terminus
[52:42] you have Jesus coming said : no no I got
[52:46] the roommate issues you know and and he
[52:49] when you're just kneel in town I I say
[52:52] this is old-fashioned prayer meeting I
[52:54] learned it in the Pentecostal okay I
[52:57] came a time in my life I hurt my knee I
[52:59] could kneel down so I said I am
[53:02] powerless

[53:14] and I will bow down in my heart you know
[53:18] and I will wait on the Lord and I will

[53:42] crazy on your knee
[53:44] yes I I feel so fresh mighty you know
[53:47] that's so outstanding it's so
[53:49] outstanding and I know that through the
[53:52] years you've shared bits and pieces of
[53:54] this but yeah I I just have a feeling
[53:56] that there are people on the other end
[53:59] yeah who are hearing this testimony
[54:01] maybe together like this for the first
[54:03] time yes and I think that they will
[54:06] appreciate even more when they turn on
[54:08] the gospel channel
[54:10] yeah and they hear how it started with a
[54:12] vision with a burden to reach millions
[54:16] men to reach the world yeah but but it
[54:19] started out just reaching a neighborhood
[54:21] yeah I think that's going to encourage a
[54:23] lot of people to pray for the gospel
[54:25] channel because the greatest days are
[54:28] just ahead
[54:29] yeah and we're talking about the history
[54:31] but yeah but the future is the brightest
[54:33] and now we have be living and planning I
[54:37] believe from from the Lord we want to
[54:39] have a live broadcasting from Monte to
[54:41] Friday on primetime prime time and we
[54:44] want to ask people to help us because we
[54:46] work on troop to part in Iceland but I
[54:49] cannot give from Monte to Frazier so I'm
[54:53] asking some brother sister what are
[54:56] involved in this great vision to
[54:58] reaching out to lost people to comment
[55:00] so I believe that from this place we
[55:02] will have a life everlasting in
[55:05] Scandinavia in England in Iceland and an
[55:11] anointing and Jesus Christ is coming to
[55:14] hit remain where they are hey man
[55:16] life amen and we became opportunity to
[55:21] call him for prayer and praise report
[55:23] people will appreciate that they will
[55:25] appreciate that and and there'll be
[55:27] someone answer the phone and then yes
[55:29] yes that really means a lot so many
[55:32] people and this is going to be in
[55:33] English mm-hmm and we have so many hands
[55:36] that can help us right
[55:38] answer the phone
[55:40] and taking care of things and we will I
[55:43] believe the end time is now and I
[55:46] believe this is coming from a small
[55:48] nation wisely yes that's because that's
[55:51] incredible I was like okay I was a black
[55:55] sheep in the family maybe I was not
