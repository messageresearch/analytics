TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to part 10 of a series that we've been doing over the last few weeks on the process of spiritual adoption and I need to end it but I haven't finished it we're gonna do one more today and and I might have to come back and do a few more at some point but I want to say what a blessing it is to be able to come to you and share this way I'm a preacher and I normally do my preaching in the pulpit and but I so enjoy being able to sit behind this little desk and just speak to you from my heart and let you know that we love you and we're doing what we do it's small I recognize that but we're doing what we do because we love to share the revelation truth from God's Word in this hour it's such a delight to see and to know that God is preparing a people and those people are about to emerge with the fullness of the Word of God in their lives and we're going to see a harvest a harvest of harvesters first and then those harvesters are going to be loosed for a quick short time into the harvest fields and there's going to be deliverance and salvation and strongholds of false religion are going to be broken and people are going to come I just prophesy that there's going to be an awakening that vales are going to be lifted and scales are going to fall off of people's eyes and there's going to be a great host of people who see the beauty of the Lord Jesus Yeshua who have never seen him before and to have even the smallest part of that it's a great blessing to us would you look on the screen and see the contact information and let us know that you're watching this program if you've got prayer requests feel free to send them in and we will join with you in prayer believing that God will answer your need I want us to get right into the study today we're going look to the scripture in the book of first John and we're going to look at chapter three and see some interesting things there first John chapter 3 beginning in verse one said behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us now that word behold there means to focus and to see not just to look but to look with focus to look with intention and with purpose on the manner of love that the father has to be stoned bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God here we are again sonship adoption the manifestation of our relationship with him behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure now so many people interpret that verse of scripture to say that we will not be like him until we see him and then we'll know who he is when he comes but I believe that that is not exactly what is being taught in this verse of scripture it does not yet appear what we shall be I believe that is speaking about the the end of our adoption the fullness of our relationship with Jesus Christ but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him now some people believe that that means when he appears we're changed to become like him I believe that it means the torsed sons of the kingdom are going to meet him when he comes and were already going to have been transformed into his image because we have a physical coming that's what we're waiting on and we have the parousia coming of the Lord which is the coming in his presence and will with the fullness of his word that's what we're experiencing in this hour the Lord is coming in this hour he's coming in the fullness of his word he's coming with revelation he's coming to anoint our eyes with eyesalve that we can see the living reality of his truth but he's coming again in a physical body a glorified would mind you but he's coming to receive his bride unto himself so I believe there's a transformation that has to take place in the bridal company before the physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be saying I've never heard that before in my life search the scriptures I invite you to dig and search through the scripture and see if you cannot see the evidence that we're going to be changed that God is going to manifest himself that's what all of creation has been groaning for and longing for for so many years as we read about in Romans chapter 8 and I believe that that's what's beginning to happen right now hallelujah and that's exciting that is such good news in a world that is filled with such bad news gloomy news and dark news economic some people say economic downturn but I think it's it's becoming in some places closer to economic failure and you can get your eyes on those things and get caught up in politics and the stock market and investments and and I'm telling you you can have a nervous breakdown well I mean the newspapers are full of people who take their own lives because they've lost their retirement and so forth but you as believers I'm speaking to you as a belief you've got to put your hope and your trust and your confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ and remember what David said I'm an old man and I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor the seed of God begging for bread in other words God will always come through if he has to send the Raven for you like he did for Elijah to feed you somebody said well where did the where did the Ravens get that food well I don't know if they got it off with somebody's window seal or if they got it supernaturally and it was created by God but but regardless of that fact the Prophet was fed he was taken care of and you and I are going to be taken care of by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter how bad things get in fact we're going to be used in mighty ways when the world is in such a sad shape and in such a needy predicament they're going to look for help and you and I are going to be able to provide the spiritual assistance that's needed for those who have no hope we're going to be able to give them hope not religion not just Church anity but we're going to be able to give them something with some substance we're going to be able to give them a part of the divine nature of Jesus Christ that we have at that point will be manifested in our lives so let me read that one more time Kenneth beloved now are we the sons of God now I need to mention that that word sons is tecnine that we've talked about before which means puberty adolescence beloved now are we the how it appears in King James it says sons of God but in other translations they picked up on the fact that that's teknon and they have said children of God meaning adolescents teenagers beloved now are we teenagers in God and it does not yet appear what we shall be it is not yet manifested that we're going to come to a place of maturity that's beyond the age of teenage years under and the responsibility level of being a teenager but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him so I believe let me say this again I believe that it's his appearance his parousia coming that's going to cause us to be like him so that when he comes physically to receive his bride we're already going to be like him and so we're going to know him because we're going to be exactly like him in His image with his character all this soulish stuff dealt with and we're going to be walking as the manifestation of the Living Word of God in the earth somebody said that's that's about the most far-out thing I've ever heard well I invite you one more time see what the Bible said don't take my word for it or anybody else's word search God's word and see if the Lord hasn't promised some pretty amazing things for those days just prior just preceding the days of his physical return some amazing things yes they're dark things and bleak things and ugly things going on but it's like we mentioned many times before Charles Dickens when he wrote A Tale of Two Cities he begins that classic book by saying it was the best of times it was the worst of times so in in the world and those who have no hope in the Savior and in the Messiah they're going to be experiencing the worst days the world has ever known but the bride the remnant of God's people we're going to be experiencing some of the greatest days that perhaps greater than what we've we've ever known for sure and maybe greater than than what's ever been manifested in human history I can say that because it's not just going to be two or three here and two or three there but there's going to be a whole company of believers that are raised up now my time is already slipping away really quick and we're going to just sort of review now these we're not going to talk about circumcision we've covered that quite well that that place of infancy but we're going to just real quickly review that that teknon that teenage stage and then we're going to finish up again by talking one more time about the adult place of maturity the believer is also referred to as that teknon that greek word which is a child and we see that many times for instance in John 1:12 and I mentioned that the last time we were together - as many as received him to them gave he the power to be the sons of God that speaks about that level of the maturity of a teenager but the believer is also in union with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is called a mature son that word huse is used referring to the Lord Jesus Christ as a mature son so in union with him we are then called to be adult sons as well and so that is our highest calling although we may be in that in that baby stage of the word brephos in Greek or we may be in that adolescent stage but potentially we have been called to be a mature son to the people living in the predominantly Greek enrollment culture of the 1st century AD that word here theisha would bring to mind a ceremony that that evolved from the Greek and Roman culture called the toga virilis and it was a ceremony in which a 14 year old boy would go through a ceremony of investor with adult male members of his family and at this ceremony there would be speeches made by his father and uncles and other male relatives that would challenge the young man and offerings would be made to the gods and then the boy would stand in the center of the group and take off this a garment of a child that he had always worn and he would be given a new robe or the toga of an adult and this would be placed on him and this was called the toga virilis which means the road of a man so we see this process sort of ceremony in other cultures and so we believe that there was probably some influence on on the Jewish culture that as the Romans occupied the land and as Greek influence became so strong that this is probably where this little ceremony developed in Hebrew culture where as a twelve year old in in the other culture about fourteen but in the Hebrew culture it was when the son was announced to be a full Apprentice of the father to train it probably came some way from this toga virilis so you can see that this was in many cultures and now in the Hebrew faith in the Jewish faith it has developed all the way down to the to the bar mitzvah of course that young man whether he was 12 in one culture or 14 in another culture he was not mature enough or wise enough to exercise all of the privileges that he had and he was certainly not experienced enough in life to live up to all the responsibilities that would eventually be placed on him but the seriousness of his position as a citizen was sort of impressed on him in this little ceremony and if he was intelligent and hardworking and consistent he would then of course grow up to be an adult having integrity and character and there would be another celebration of that milestone in his life in explaining how we interpret the term from the scripture that we started off with in Romans 8 the manifestation of the sons of God perhaps we should use a bit of clarification on that term because what did Greek speaking people such as Paul mean when they said something was to be manifested well as you've heard me mention not necessarily reading it from a notes as I'm doing but you've heard me mention in this study that that original Greek word is apocalypsis and it means a disclosure in other places throughout the New Testament that word is also translated as an appearing a coming to shine light on or a revelation the definition assigned to the root word is to take off the cover so here we kind of see that concept in this toga virilis ceremony where the the the robe of a child the age-specific garb of a child was removed and and the age-specific robe of an adult man was put on him when I hear that term apocalypsis or apocalypsis is probably a little bit more accurate it means to me the the act of exposing something that has been previously hidden from view so if God says you're coming and through the scripture if he says to us through the Apostle the the manifestation of the sons of God it means that God's been working on something behind the scenes guess what it's me it's you he's been working on us he's been dealing with us as we've talked about every trial we've gone through every both the low places and the high places the valleys and the mountains the hardships and the seasons of blessing and abundance it's all been a part of God's plan to work on us as his masterpiece because there's coming a day that he's gonna take off the cover and he's going to show the world his mature sons that which has been in darkness that which has been in obscurity will be brought out into visibility it has been stated by some that what we're really looking for is not a manifestation of the sons of God but a manifestation of God in his sons and I believe that that is pretty accurate this is basically a difference of perspective for instance we often call the the book of the Bible that's right after the four Gospels we often call that the Acts of the Apostles but it's really not about what the Apostles did is it it's about what the Holy Spirit did in the lives of the Apostles so the emphasis is not on the sons of God being manifested the emphasis must be on God being manifested through his sons how many of you want to make God a vessel you you want to prepare your life as a vessel as a pipeline so that God can come and manifest himself in the fullness of his glory through your life I believe that's many people's desire that that you are watching this program right now and and whatever manner you're singing and whatever media method you're watching this program I believe I'm speaking maybe even on a DVD for that matter many people who are watching this your deepest desire is to be a yielded vessel in the hand of the Lord and and I really believe that God is bringing us to that place he's sort of pulling us and and drawing us so that we want to yield ourselves more to him now that was the toga virilis which was compared to the time of being celebrated as an apprentice of the father now in closing this today bringing it to an end at least for now I want to look one more time at that other ceremony the one that took place about the age of 30 that would be the son placement and the ceremony went something like this I'm gonna just read it from my notes once the son had finally come to age the father would arrange a ceremony for him and that means he had passed the test he had been under the governor's he had been under the tutors he had proven himself accountable he had proven himself trustworthy so the father would arrange a ceremony for him in a part of the city that would draw the largest possible number of observers usually in that time around the main gates of the city or alternatively in the marketplace amidst a great crowd of witnesses he would then place his hands upon the head of his son and he would initiate the impartation of power now that's very very interesting and I could preach on that if I had time I've just glanced at the clock and I don't have a lot of time to go into the impartation of the father's authority but just think about the biblical implication and the spiritual implication of that he would speak to the crowd of his sons commitment throughout the course of his training his apprenticeship and then he would confirm that his son was now willing and able and ready to accept the responsibilities that were about to be conferred upon him or imparted to him he would grant him the authority publicly to speak in his stead and would call upon all who were there to be witnesses that day and to bear record that from that time forward his son would go forth from that ceremony in his father's name think about that no longer was his son to be looked upon as merely an heir under tutors and governors but he was now recognized as the inheritor think about that the inheritor of all that his father had promised him and an equal partner in the family business he was not an apprentice anymore he was not in training anymore he had proven himself and he was now to be a partner in the family business you just think about the fact that we're coming to that place of maturity in the placing of a mature son and where we are becoming partners in the family business where where we could have said like Jesus sent us as a young man to his parents I'm about my father's business think about it and he and his father were one it meant that either one of them could conduct the full business of the family and this this speaks about the oneness that Jesus had with the father but it also speaks about the Union and the oneness that you and I are called to in this last day as part of the Bride of Christ finally to seal the deal so to speak the father would utter these now familiar words this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased the exact words that three of the Gospel writers have told us that were spoken over Jesus at his baptism and three of the Gospel writers have told us that these words were spoken over him on the Mount of Transfiguration that's exactly the words that a father would pronounce publicly over his son during this time of adoption this pronouncement would let everyone know that the son had received the full blessing and the full endorsement of his father I believe that's about to take place in the earth I believe that this people that God's been working on all these years he's about to to come in the fullness of his glory and announced to the world I now have a bridal company in the earth who are going to be functioning in oneness with me and they're going to be authorized and have the authority to conduct my business on the earth in a manner that the world has yet to see I had an experience in closing I don't know if I have time or not but a few weeks ago I had an experience in a sort of a revelatory realm where I saw what happened on the Mount of Transfiguration I saw the Lord Jesus Yeshua standing there I saw Moses and Elijah I even saw Peter James and John I saw how the cloud came down how they entered into the cloud I heard the voice speaking this is my beloved son I'm pleased with him hear him hear ye him and then all of a sudden I saw something beyond what we read about in the Gospels I saw a veil that I had not seen before like a deep curtain that had been behind the Lord Jesus and I had not seen that before I just watched the whole thing play out and I'd not seen that curtain all of a sudden I saw the curtain and it lifted the veil literally literally was lifted up from behind him and there was a great crowd of people standing behind him and the voice spoke again this is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased hear ye him this time I knew by revelation that the phrase here--he him was not just referring to the Lord Jesus it was referring to them it could have been said although it was said here he him he was now referring to the corporate voice of God speaking through the body of mature sons those who had come to full adoption and now the veil apocalypsis would be taken off and they would be revealed to the world with the authority of God in their mouth it was a life-changing and encouraging experience to be able to see that and I believe that's where we are and we've got to continue to remain humble before the Lord and walk softly before him in being sober and being vigilant and we need to let the Lord come and manifest the fullness of who he is in us so that we can speak the word and see God perform it not selfishly but for the body of Christ they're desperate cases they're desperate situations where we need a full manifestation of the glory of God and God wants to use you and he wants to use me let's pray together father I thank you for letting us come this far and sometime in the future we'll come back and and do some other teaching but I think that somehow by your grace you have used us to lay a pretty good foundation for at least what the process is about and I pray that you will use these words to bless your people and to cause them to hunger and thirst for more of you in a place of intimate fellowship and relationship with you the enemy so despises that but we in the body longed for it grant it to us in the name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen thank you for being a faithful watcher of this program and I pray that you'll tune in again next time I don't know what will be speaking about but I pray it'll be something that you need for that time in your life thank you for watching the Eagles cry bye bye for now [Music] you [Music]
