[0:00] it's not only possible that God is going
[0:03] to give us total Deliverance it is upon
[0:05] us
[0:06] it's the hour to claim it
[0:08] [Music]
[0:15] when when we are not in agreement with
[0:18] what God has promised
[0:20] and when we speak something from our
[0:23] being that is not in agreement with what
[0:26] God's word has said God doesn't say
[0:28] that's being negative
[0:30] oh that's what we say to one another
[0:32] don't be so negative but that's not what
[0:35] God calls it at all he calls it evil
[0:39] did you know the Book of Genesis helps
[0:41] us to understand when we are not
[0:43] bringing forth what we have been called
[0:46] to bring forth
[0:48] all that a disappointment
[0:54] when we are not manifesting what God has
[0:57] called us to manifest the Hebrew
[0:59] language calls it evil and when God said
[1:03] you can overcome all things and we start
[1:06] making excuses for why people have not
[1:09] yet overcome When God says I want to
[1:12] give you total deliverance and we start
[1:15] explaining why you may not have total
[1:18] Deliverance God doesn't call that being
[1:20] negative
[1:21] foreign yeah I want to tell it today
[1:25] because that being evil so it's possible
[1:29] that even churches are giving evil
[1:33] reports not not just negative reports
[1:36] but evil reports when we are calling the
[1:39] shot only by what we can see with the
[1:43] natural eye in spite of what God has
[1:46] already said he wanted to do God doesn't
[1:48] call that negative
[1:50] [Music]
[1:51] he calls it evil
[1:54] so I want you and I to watch our words
[1:58] to watch our thoughts and we need to
[2:00] watch our words and we need to watch
[2:02] what we come into agreement with we need
[2:05] to ask the Holy Spirit to reform and
[2:09] reshape our vocabulary so that when we
[2:12] open our mouth we are speaking the
[2:15] things that come into alignment with
[2:18] what God has said it's not only possible
[2:21] it's imminent it's not only possible
[2:25] that God is going to give us total
[2:27] Deliverance it is upon us and this is
[2:30] the hour to claim it the Holy Ghost
[2:33] baptism is real the genuine New Birth is
[2:37] real the supernatural God is real
[2:41] I encourage you not to worry about what
[2:44] others would say but go after it with
[2:47] everything you've got
[2:51] Party by speaking tongue Soviet
[2:55] what if I mess up my hair so then
[2:58] what if I slobber and snot so be it
[3:03] what if I lose my place in the church so
[3:06] be it
[3:08] what if my own family won't talk to me
[3:11] so damn
[3:13] there comes a time when we must make the
[3:16] decision
[3:17] to take God at his word and refuse to
[3:22] live in the Borderland
[3:25] go after it with everything you've got
[3:28] [Music]
