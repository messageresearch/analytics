[34:52] whipped but uh I my heart's pretty full
[34:56] today and uh for lots of
[35:00] reasons but for one is because of the

[1:21:39] had a memory like an elephant all right
[1:21:42] amen Isaiah 61 1 and two the spirit of
[1:21:47] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[1:21:52] hath anointed me to preach
[1:21:55] The Good Tidings unto the meek now this
[1:21:59] is a prophecy coming out of Isaiah's
[1:22:02] mouth he goes on to say he hath sent me
[1:22:06] to bind up the
[1:22:08] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:22:12] captives and the opening of the prison
[1:22:16] to them that are bound have you ever
[1:22:18] been
[1:22:19] bound aren't you glad that he's still
[1:22:22] opening prison doors to proclaim the
[1:22:27] acceptable year of the Lord if you were
[1:22:31] to look at that in Hebrew it would say
[1:22:33] the year of the Lord's Divine favor how
[1:22:37] many of you love living in the favor of
[1:22:39] the Lord that's why brother Cade got so
[1:22:42] emotional and anointed singing that I
[1:22:44] have been blessed he realizes he's
[1:22:47] living under the favor of the Lord I Saw
[1:22:51] Benjamin on the drums weeping because he
[1:22:54] realizes that he's living under the
[1:22:57] favor of the Lord we're a blessed people
[1:23:00] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:23:02] Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God
[1:23:06] to comfort all that mourn then while
[1:23:11] you're standing just a few more verses
[1:23:14] and this time from Luke chapter 4 verse
[1:23:19] 17- 22 we will share now the Fulfillment
[1:23:24] of Isaiah's prophecy in Isaiah 611 and2
[1:23:29] there was delivered unto him the book of
[1:23:32] the prophet Isaiah and when he had
[1:23:34] opened the book he found the place where
[1:23:39] it was written the spirit of the Lord is
[1:23:43] upon me this is red letter the spirit of
[1:23:47] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[1:23:49] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:23:53] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:23:56] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:23:59] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:24:02] the blind to set at Liberty Hallelujah
[1:24:07] Liberty them that are bruised to preach
[1:24:12] the acceptable year of the Lord and he
[1:24:16] closed the book and he gave it again to
[1:24:19] the minister and sat down and the eyes
[1:24:22] of all of them that were in the
[1:24:24] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[1:24:27] began to say unto them this day red
[1:24:32] letter again this day is this
[1:24:37] scripture that was spoken 400 years
[1:24:41] before this day is this scripture
[1:24:46] fulfilled in your ears I don't know if
[1:24:49] you recognize it or not but we are a
[1:24:51] blessed and chosen people today because
[1:24:54] we can also say that we are living in
[1:24:57] the day that scripture is being
[1:25:01] fulfilled Hallelujah and all bear him
[1:25:04] witness and wondered at the gracious
[1:25:07] Words which proceeded out of his mouth
[1:25:10] and they said is not this Joseph's son
[1:25:15] they recognized him because he had grown
[1:25:19] up in the town of of Nazareth if you
[1:25:23] looked at the literal translation of
[1:25:26] those gracious words in the Greek it
[1:25:29] would be this he gave the message of
[1:25:33] Grace aren't you thankful today that we
[1:25:36] have heard a message of Grace it is not
[1:25:40] a message of condemnation not a message
[1:25:43] of judgment not a message of
[1:25:46] religion but it is a message of Grace
[1:25:49] unmerited hello
[1:25:52] undeserved favor
[1:25:54] Grace is unmerited undeserved favor you
[1:25:59] you it's not based on your uniform it's
[1:26:03] not based on your keeping of the rules
[1:26:06] it's based solely on his grace and when
[1:26:09] you meet M Grace when you are acquainted
[1:26:13] with her it'll cause you to want to walk
[1:26:16] a straight and narrow walk it'll cause
[1:26:18] you to want to Leave the World Behind
[1:26:20] you and serve God in modesty and in
[1:26:23] truth if you believe that say Amen
[1:26:26] father we need you today our hearts are
[1:26:29] full and we need you to come and let
[1:26:32] your word burn in us may it be for us as
[1:26:37] it was those two men on the road to to
[1:26:41] emus when we leave this house when we go
[1:26:45] out to the baptism trough may it be that
[1:26:49] somebody can say my heart was burning as
[1:26:52] the words of life were being spoken over
[1:26:55] me and if that is the case my God we
[1:26:59] will give you the glory and the honor
[1:27:02] and the praise for it is in the name of
[1:27:04] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:27:06] Saints said amen you may be
[1:27:10] seated I want to move as quickly as I
[1:27:14] possibly can because I will miss you now
[1:27:18] for three
[1:27:19] services and I I want to get as much
[1:27:22] ground carried uh covered as we possibly
[1:27:27] can and I want to introduce you to the
[1:27:31] fifth part of a series that we've been
[1:27:34] preaching all year and when I say fifth
[1:27:37] I mean the fifth section not the fifth
[1:27:40] service or sermon but before I do that I
[1:27:44] want to read a quotation from brother
[1:27:46] brandham I want to read from questions
[1:27:49] and answers number two
[1:27:52] 1964 paragraph 1 110 and 111 I want to
[1:27:56] see if maybe this will give you a little
[1:27:58] inkling of where we're going now this
[1:28:01] logos that was in him which was the
[1:28:07] spirit of God I want to remind you that
[1:28:11] we have been told that it was out of
[1:28:14] that great Fountain of
[1:28:17] Light of flashing colors and various
[1:28:23] manifestations
[1:28:25] it was out of that great light that the
[1:28:28] logos stepped forth powerful powerful
[1:28:32] and here we meet the logos again this
[1:28:37] logos that was in him in who in Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ in the word made flesh which was
[1:28:47] the spirit of God the
[1:28:50] logos was the spirit of God I'm going to
[1:28:54] pause for your
[1:28:56] amen the logos was the spirit of God now
[1:29:01] if you try to make it something else
[1:29:04] you're going to get
[1:29:06] confused and you're going to come out
[1:29:08] with a trinity or a quadruple of God or
[1:29:11] five or six persons making up a godhead
[1:29:16] but if you will let it be what he told
[1:29:18] us it was everything will fit right with
[1:29:21] the book the logos that was in him Jesus
[1:29:26] Christ God bless you Sister I just
[1:29:29] looked back and saw that uh sister
[1:29:32] Rebecca's made it back to us praise the
[1:29:34] Lord that same spirit that was of God
[1:29:39] was in Christ and he calls it underline
[1:29:43] there what did he call it the an the
[1:29:46] anointing when you have experienced the
[1:29:50] anointing in your life let let me ask
[1:29:52] you how many of you have ever sat and
[1:29:56] experienced or stood or laid on the
[1:29:59] floor and experienced the anointing it's
[1:30:05] tangible it's
[1:30:07] manifest it's not spooky spooky come on
[1:30:11] I I it's not metaphysical or ethereal
[1:30:15] it's
[1:30:16] real that anointing is real now I want
[1:30:20] you to know that emotionalism is not
[1:30:22] necessarily the anointing
[1:30:25] being loud is not necessarily the
[1:30:27] anointing you can scream something loud
[1:30:29] and not be
[1:30:31] anointed you can dance and shout and run
[1:30:33] and talk in tongues and not have the
[1:30:35] real anointing of God on your life come
[1:30:38] on so I don't want us to to uh make make
[1:30:42] equal the anointing and and and emotion
[1:30:46] or loudness but I'm thankful for a
[1:30:48] little
[1:30:49] emotion I heard a prophet say if your
[1:30:52] religion doesn't have a little emotion
[1:30:54] in it is
[1:30:55] dead and he said I can only think of one
[1:30:58] thing it's good for that's to be buried
[1:31:01] am I preaching to Believers today I need
[1:31:04] your help here cuz I want to go
[1:31:06] somewhere so now we've got the logos
[1:31:10] that was in him which was the spirit of
[1:31:13] God and it is also called The anointing
[1:31:16] so if you have ever been touched or have
[1:31:21] experienced the anointing of God you
[1:31:23] have touch the logos the logos has
[1:31:26] touched you that's pretty powerful cuz
[1:31:30] that's what stepped out of the great
[1:31:32] Fountain of Light that's what was from
[1:31:34] the very beginning of the beginning of
[1:31:36] the beginning he tells us before there
[1:31:39] was anything to worship that
[1:31:42] logos before there was anything to
[1:31:45] worship that that being that spirit
[1:31:49] because nothing had yet been
[1:31:51] created and therefore by the definition
[1:31:54] of the dictionary he wouldn't have even
[1:31:56] been
[1:31:58] God now we know he was God but
[1:32:01] technically by the definition of the
[1:32:03] dictionary he wasn't God because there
[1:32:06] was not yet anything to worship Him
[1:32:08] aren't you glad he fixed that aren't you
[1:32:11] glad it's one of the reasons why you
[1:32:13] were born you were born to worship
[1:32:17] God I don't mean to pick on brother Cade
[1:32:20] but I heard him say something a few
[1:32:23] weeks ago that has stayed in my heart he
[1:32:25] said I was born to worship if I would
[1:32:28] have been prophesying over him that's
[1:32:31] exactly what I would have spoke over his
[1:32:33] life you're born to worship but he spoke
[1:32:36] it over himself he prophesied over
[1:32:39] himself I I was born to be a worshipper
[1:32:42] amen now technically all of us were born
[1:32:45] for that purpose and some of us have
[1:32:48] received gifts and anointings to be able
[1:32:51] to do that to enable us to do that with
[1:32:54] both spirit and Grace but truly we were
[1:32:57] all born to worship all right and then
[1:32:59] he goes on through the sanctify I I'm
[1:33:03] I'm already cutting up the quote so let
[1:33:05] me go back now this Loos that was in him
[1:33:08] which was the spirit of God the
[1:33:10] anointing through the sanctifying grace
[1:33:13] of the
[1:33:16] blood brought many sons yes sir hello
[1:33:20] I'm waiting on an amen many sons
[1:33:24] to God not just one son Jesus Christ not
[1:33:28] just one son a prophet not just one son
[1:33:31] your pastor on but but many sons have
[1:33:36] come to God by the sanctifying grace of
[1:33:38] the blood they've been touched by the
[1:33:41] logos that was in Christ the very same
[1:33:44] spirit that was in Jesus Christ he
[1:33:46] emptied that poured that out on the day
[1:33:49] of Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:51] Ghost if you have received the Holy
[1:33:53] Ghost
[1:33:54] you have received the very spirit that
[1:33:56] was in Jesus Christ therefore the logos
[1:34:00] is now living in
[1:34:05] you not somewhere on the throne in
[1:34:10] heaven that same logos that stepped out
[1:34:13] of that great Fountain of Light which is
[1:34:16] the spirit of God which is the
[1:34:19] anointing which is the holy ghost is now
[1:34:23] living in you and how was he able to do
[1:34:25] that because he Sanctified you with his
[1:34:29] grace by the blood of the crucified
[1:34:32] lamb he cleaned you up somebody said I'm
[1:34:35] not worthy none of
[1:34:37] us none of us are worthy but he made us
[1:34:42] worthy how by the sanctifying grace of
[1:34:45] his blood which is Anointed The Blood
[1:34:49] The Grace the many sons are anointed
[1:34:54] somebody say anointed Anointed with the
[1:34:58] same this same logos so when you've felt
[1:35:02] the anointing you've experienced the
[1:35:04] anointing you've moved by the anointing
[1:35:07] you've ministered you've sung you've
[1:35:09] prayed how many of you have ever felt an
[1:35:11] anointing to pray you're just praying
[1:35:14] along dry as a
[1:35:16] bone pushing through with everything
[1:35:19] you've got and all of a sudden uh the
[1:35:21] spirit of the Lord falls down on your
[1:35:23] prayer and you pray like a Preacher
[1:35:25] Man you almost sound like you're
[1:35:27] preaching to God but you're praying
[1:35:30] you're praying under anointing you're
[1:35:32] praying under the influence of the very
[1:35:34] same
[1:35:36] logos that was in him which was the
[1:35:40] spirit of God it was the anointing
[1:35:42] through the
[1:35:43] sanctifying grace of his blood living
[1:35:47] inside of the believer brother that's
[1:35:50] good right
[1:35:51] there paragraph 111 now on the day of
[1:35:54] Pentecost it come down that Pillar of
[1:35:57] Fire okay there it is here's something
[1:36:00] else that
[1:36:01] logos that anointing that Spirit of the
[1:36:05] Holy Ghost that Spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:36:07] the Holy Ghost all of that he now says
[1:36:11] the pillar of fire that's the pillar of
[1:36:14] fire when you've seen the pillar of fire
[1:36:18] uh you've seen the logos when you've
[1:36:21] experienced the pillar of fire you you
[1:36:23] experiened the
[1:36:25] anointing there's not a dozen different
[1:36:28] things here we're talking about a dozen
[1:36:31] different ways to describe the very same
[1:36:35] Spirit come on the Bible talks about the
[1:36:38] seven spirits of God they're
[1:36:41] one they're one all of them are together
[1:36:45] one the spirit of the Lord so we're
[1:36:49] thankful to understand that because if
[1:36:51] we get that we know when the Holy Ghost
[1:36:54] has come in we have received the
[1:36:57] fullness the very fullness brother vom
[1:37:01] said all that was in the father he did
[1:37:03] what he poured into the son and all that
[1:37:06] was in the son he did what he poured
[1:37:09] that into the church on the day of
[1:37:12] Pentecost my my my you've got the same
[1:37:15] God that thundered on Mount sin
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:21] living living inside of you
[1:37:24] he said on the day of Pentecost it come
[1:37:26] down the pillar of fire the logos and
[1:37:29] broke apart like that and tongues of
[1:37:31] fire set upon each of them do you
[1:37:35] believe that I believe it not their
[1:37:38] tongues but tongues of fire licks of
[1:37:41] fire set upon each of them a
[1:37:46] elected selected group identified by
[1:37:50] this Pillar of Fire showing that God had
[1:37:54] separated himself into man now let me
[1:37:57] show you what he's telling us there this
[1:37:59] was what we call Pentecost what the Jews
[1:38:03] call from the scripture
[1:38:05] chavot and chavot was a festival one of
[1:38:09] the three Pilgrim festivals of all
[1:38:11] Hebrews and they were commanded not not
[1:38:15] invited not
[1:38:17] suggested they were commanded every male
[1:38:20] Hebrew of a certain age was commanded to
[1:38:23] come and worship Jehovah worship God not
[1:38:27] in their Hometown on but in the city of
[1:38:31] Jerusalem in the Holy Temple so there
[1:38:34] were tens of thousands of people that
[1:38:37] had had uh crowded in to the city of
[1:38:41] Jerusalem that day the temple was full
[1:38:45] the courtyard was full the Roman stoa
[1:38:49] was full the ofel was full the southern
[1:38:52] sta
[1:38:54] that led up to the temple were
[1:38:56] full all of that area in front of the
[1:39:00] Temple mount the city of David full from
[1:39:04] the from the top of the oel to the
[1:39:07] bottom of the pool of Salim they were
[1:39:10] full of people the valley both both the
[1:39:14] kidan valley the whole The Valleys that
[1:39:17] that
[1:39:18] surrounded uh Jerusalem full of people
[1:39:22] every street full of people in fact we
[1:39:24] might as well get the the the paths that
[1:39:27] led up the mountain to to the Mount of
[1:39:29] Olives it's right there so all those
[1:39:32] little places on the way to Bethany full
[1:39:35] of people but the pillar of fire didn't
[1:39:38] come down to those who were gathered in
[1:39:41] Bethany or those who were gathered in
[1:39:43] the in the Roman stoa or those who were
[1:39:46] gathered in the Holy
[1:39:48] Temple didn't God say I'll meet you in
[1:39:50] the temple yes sir so those people were
[1:39:53] doing what they were commanded to do but
[1:39:55] the pillar of fire didn't come to
[1:39:58] them it came to a to a selected group of
[1:40:02] people yes sir a chosen group of people
[1:40:05] 120 men right amen women and children
[1:40:09] around but 120 men and he appeared to
[1:40:13] them on the day of Pentecost on the
[1:40:16] Festival of chavot and he filled them
[1:40:20] with the very logos he fil filled them
[1:40:24] with the pillar of fire he filled them
[1:40:27] with the spirit of Jesus Christ he
[1:40:30] filled them with the
[1:40:32] anointing so every time you've
[1:40:34] experienced the anointing you've
[1:40:37] experienced the favor of the Lord that
[1:40:40] fell on the day of Pentecost same logos
[1:40:44] help
[1:40:46] me help me same logos Same Spirit of
[1:40:51] Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know what
[1:40:53] that tells me that tells me you must be
[1:40:55] a chosen bunch of
[1:40:57] folks that's right amen you must be a
[1:41:01] chosen bunch of folks you must be
[1:41:04] elected you must be
[1:41:06] predestinated you must be called of God
[1:41:09] because you have been allowed to
[1:41:12] experience the same logos on the same
[1:41:16] Pillar of Fire the same
[1:41:19] anointing that fell on them and his
[1:41:23] falling on you some of you have
[1:41:24] experienced it I'm not going to try to
[1:41:26] put you on the spot so I'll cover up my
[1:41:29] eyes but how many of you have since the
[1:41:31] anointing since you've been gathered
[1:41:32] here today hold up your hand but I'm not
[1:41:36] looking because I don't want to put you
[1:41:38] on the spot but really it has nothing to
[1:41:39] do with me
[1:41:41] anyhow I experienced him for myself and
[1:41:45] I hope you did because you need a
[1:41:47] personal experience with with him don't
[1:41:50] you he said but tongues of fire set upon
[1:41:52] each of them a elected selected group
[1:41:56] identified by this Pillar of Fire
[1:41:58] showing that God has separated himself
[1:42:02] watch this into man somebody say that
[1:42:06] with me into
[1:42:09] man he was not satisfied to be
[1:42:13] Emmanuel God With Us he wanted to be God
[1:42:17] in
[1:42:19] us how many of you know it would be hard
[1:42:22] to be satisfied with having God With Us
[1:42:26] when you read in the book you don't have
[1:42:28] to be satisfied with God With Us you can
[1:42:31] have God in
[1:42:33] us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if
[1:42:36] you don't have the Holy Ghost today you
[1:42:38] need the Holy Ghost I'm not talking
[1:42:41] about that portion of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:42] you get when your spirit is regenerated
[1:42:45] in Christ therefore I'm not talking
[1:42:47] about the portion of the spirit you get
[1:42:49] when you're saved I don't argue with
[1:42:52] anybody I believe you cannot be redeemed
[1:42:55] you cannot be saved unless a portion of
[1:42:57] the spirit of the Lord comes into your
[1:42:59] life but that is not the baptism of the
[1:43:01] Holy Ghost so if you're sitting here
[1:43:03] today or you're watching this stream in
[1:43:06] the nations of the world and you don't
[1:43:08] know that you know that you know that
[1:43:09] you know that you
[1:43:11] know that you have the baptism of the
[1:43:14] Holy Ghost I invite you to seek for it
[1:43:18] because he may be seeking you and if he
[1:43:21] is he'll fill you not with a third
[1:43:25] person of a godhead he'll fill you with
[1:43:30] himself
[1:43:32] Hallelujah and when he fills you with
[1:43:35] himself you
[1:43:37] become eligible yes sir yes sir brother
[1:43:42] to do what he
[1:43:44] did same signs yes sir Prophet said same
[1:43:48] signs same wonders same
[1:43:51] Miracles mark
[1:43:53] 16 in the life of the
[1:43:56] believer now scoffield wasn't sure
[1:43:59] whether or not Mark 16 was inspired but
[1:44:02] I'm
[1:44:04] sure and these signs shall
[1:44:11] follow somebody said that Bunch they're
[1:44:14] always following signs no no no no no
[1:44:18] come
[1:44:19] on signs are always following that bunch
[1:44:24] these signs shall follow them that
[1:44:28] believe they shall hands on the
[1:44:32] sick Hallelujah they shall cast out
[1:44:39] devils and I I won't do like some of the
[1:44:42] preachers around this message do and
[1:44:45] leave it
[1:44:46] there come on they shall
[1:44:52] speak
[1:44:53] with new
[1:44:55] [Applause]
[1:44:56] tongues it's part of the promise and the
[1:45:00] promise is unto
[1:45:03] you and to your
[1:45:06] children and your children's children
[1:45:10] with staving lips and another tongue
[1:45:12] will I speak to my people to you your
[1:45:16] children and your children's children
[1:45:18] and he didn't stop there cuz nobody knew
[1:45:21] exactly how many generations to put in
[1:45:23] there and so he said and as
[1:45:26] many the God as the Lord Our God shall
[1:45:30] call He's Calling My Children he's going
[1:45:33] to call my grandchildren he's going to
[1:45:36] call my great grandchildren if we're
[1:45:38] here that long Hallelujah and they're
[1:45:41] going to respond somebody said what if
[1:45:44] they don't hear the call are you kidding
[1:45:46] me they're going to hear the call
[1:45:50] because if the pillar of fire found a
[1:45:52] chosen bunch of people on the day of
[1:45:54] Pentecost to manifest the Loos of God
[1:45:58] he'll do the same
[1:46:00] again he'll find the chosen of the Lord
[1:46:05] and he'll pour himself out so if you
[1:46:08] don't have the Holy Ghost woo you
[1:46:12] can he's real he's not an
[1:46:16] it it's the anointing it's the logos
[1:46:20] it's the pillar of fire it's the the
[1:46:23] spirit of Jesus Christ anybody know
[1:46:25] where I'm going no you
[1:46:28] don't maybe you do he said God had
[1:46:32] separated himself into man and then he
[1:46:34] asked this question I'm back to the
[1:46:35] quote there charity do you get it let me
[1:46:39] ask you do you get it do you get it God
[1:46:44] the logos separating
[1:46:47] himself into
[1:46:49] man God not in one person
[1:46:53] he's in his church
[1:46:56] Universal now I'm not afraid to go ahead
[1:46:59] and uh you know kind of bring that down
[1:47:01] just a little bit he's in his bride
[1:47:04] church I don't know what man's church is
[1:47:07] doing I can't keep up with what's going
[1:47:10] on in man's church but I know what God's
[1:47:13] doing in his
[1:47:15] church right she may not have caui C
[1:47:19] caui
[1:47:21] woo she may not have coffee shops and
[1:47:25] but I'll tell you what he's doing in his
[1:47:27] church he's filling her with
[1:47:30] himself woo and I want you to know
[1:47:34] unlike Jesus Christ who had the very
[1:47:37] fullness of God each of us has received
[1:47:39] a portion of God and that means if
[1:47:43] you've received a portion that means
[1:47:45] there's
[1:47:48] more that means there's more if there's
[1:47:51] a deep calling it
[1:47:53] means that there is a deep to respond
[1:47:57] brother bam said there's one baptism of
[1:47:59] the Holy Ghost and many woo you people
[1:48:03] are good this morning you're getting
[1:48:04] sharper now as we go on many
[1:48:08] refilling I I don't know but I think I
[1:48:10] may have got a refilling this morning it
[1:48:13] it just felt fresh to me
[1:48:16] Hallelujah he just felt
[1:48:18] fresh he overwhelmed me as I was sitting
[1:48:22] there with the reality I have been
[1:48:27] blessed turn to your neighbor turn to
[1:48:31] the one next to you and say I have been
[1:48:38] blessed and if you feel this way you can
[1:48:40] say and you've been a
[1:48:43] part of my
[1:48:45] blessing if you don't then don't say
[1:48:50] it you're stuck with each other
[1:48:56] anyhow do you get it God the Loos
[1:48:59] separating himself into man God not in
[1:49:02] one person he's in his church Universal
[1:49:06] that's the reason Jesus said the works
[1:49:07] that I
[1:49:09] do shall you
[1:49:11] also
[1:49:14] more he said it he said
[1:49:18] more I'm going to have a people that
[1:49:21] storms have to obey
[1:49:24] I'm going to have to have a people that
[1:49:26] speak to tumors and they
[1:49:28] disappear I'm going to have me a people
[1:49:30] that speak the word and conviction
[1:49:34] strikes that's right brother and like
[1:49:36] hady wres
[1:49:38] Sons conviction

[1:50:06] here forgive me forgive me no I think
[1:50:09] brother random being born in Indiana you
[1:50:11] know I mean in in Kentucky I think he
[1:50:14] had his own language though really I do
[1:50:16] he just made up his language and now we
[1:50:18] like it and we go on with it he he call
[1:50:20] them two little boys snicker frits
[1:50:24] you know what we might call teeny
[1:50:27] boppers oh no no I know this Young
[1:50:30] Generation my kids will say later Dad
[1:50:32] what's a teenie
[1:50:34] bopper I don't what they call him
[1:50:38] today I'm waiting y'all was so wanting
[1:50:41] to help me so bad while ago won't you
[1:50:43] help me now what do they call them
[1:50:46] now it looks to me like they're they're
[1:50:49] trying to go what I miss I don't want to
[1:50:51] miss nothing fun if you're having fun I
[1:50:53] want to be in on it he said you can't
[1:50:56] say it in church oh you can't say it in
[1:50:59] church you tell me after service I want
[1:51:02] to
[1:51:04] know now my mind is really in I want to
[1:51:09] know I got to know I have to
[1:51:13] know it looks to me like this generation
[1:51:16] wants to go back to
[1:51:18] beatnick come on now I see it I see men
[1:51:22] with beatnick haircuts and turtlenecks
[1:51:26] and they look just like do beill to me
[1:51:29] some of
[1:51:30] them I don't know what's got a hold of
[1:51:33] them but but here were two boys and they
[1:51:36] were laughing and snickering at what was
[1:51:39] being talked about but the anointing
[1:51:42] came and I I I give you your children in
[1:51:46] the name of Jesus Christ you might try
[1:51:48] to tell me that was only for a prophet
[1:51:50] or that was only for brother Brandon but
[1:51:52] I believe that every one of those five
[1:51:54] instances of the manifestation of the
[1:51:57] spoken word were speaking to
[1:52:00] us and God wants us to come to that
[1:52:04] place where we're manifesting that very
[1:52:07] same Authority in the creative spoken
[1:52:09] word of God somebody said I don't know
[1:52:12] when we'd ever need it well I I can
[1:52:14] think of dozens
[1:52:16] of there was a little fishy that lost
[1:52:18] his life and he stood up little fishy I
[1:52:20] give you your life and now people all
[1:52:22] all over the Internet make fun of that
[1:52:24] and mock that like it's some little
[1:52:26] silly thing but they won't be mocking
[1:52:27] when this little bride raises up with
[1:52:30] the voice of the bridegroom and cause
[1:52:31] for the
[1:52:32] resurrection because it was a little
[1:52:34] fishy then the next thing it'll be the
[1:52:36] dead in
[1:52:38] Christ because he said that bride will
[1:52:41] call for the
[1:52:44] resurrection it won't be
[1:52:46] her am I screaming too loud turn me up
[1:52:51] then it won't be
[1:52:53] her it'll be the voice of the bridegroom
[1:52:57] echoing you're just like a microphone
[1:53:00] come on so I can see why we need some of
[1:53:03] that I got to hurry I have to hurry now
[1:53:06] greater
[1:53:07] greater greater he said I know the King
[1:53:10] James says greater but the right
[1:53:12] translation there is more than this
[1:53:15] shall you do well don't more can't more
[1:53:18] does more have to mean more of the same
[1:53:23] not necessarily and I've looked at it in
[1:53:25] the Greek and I'm pretty happy with the
[1:53:28] way it comes out that what I did you can
[1:53:31] do that and and
[1:53:33] Beyond yes sir that's right God was
[1:53:36] bottled and confined in one man he goes
[1:53:39] on in one man Jesus Christ but now he's
[1:53:43] bottled and confined in the whole
[1:53:44] Universal Church of the Living
[1:53:46] God so whether it's just more of the
[1:53:49] same or greater I'm looking for it amen
[1:53:52] amen now the reason why we're in this
[1:53:55] little series and I'm hurried I'm really
[1:53:57] really really in a rush you just don't
[1:53:58] know it but is because I had this little
[1:54:01] thing with the Lord uh at the beginning
[1:54:04] of the year and the Lord spoke to my
[1:54:07] heart about this being a season of
[1:54:08] mountain climbing and I believe it in
[1:54:12] fact I've had to climb some and you've
[1:54:14] had to climb some already and we're just
[1:54:16] here at the end of March so if we've
[1:54:18] already had to do some climbing reaching
[1:54:21] for some higher Heights
[1:54:23] and it's just the end of March I don't
[1:54:24] know what we'll have to do come into the
[1:54:26] year do you but I pray Hallelujah I pray
[1:54:30] that we're so much higher up the
[1:54:33] mountain and uh remember that thatth
[1:54:36] word of the Lord came and said be very
[1:54:41] surefooted you you you've got to be
[1:54:43] careful where you put your
[1:54:44] feet you you know because you get it in
[1:54:47] in in uh rolling gravel and you may find
[1:54:51] yourself back Beyond where you started
[1:54:53] come on and and so you want to make sure
[1:54:56] like hind feet in high places that you
[1:54:59] become very surefooted I've watched that
[1:55:02] IEX as I have stood at edti multiple
[1:55:06] times in in Israel and I have seen that
[1:55:10] IEX at the very top of those mountains
[1:55:13] climbing up to the very top on on the
[1:55:16] sheer face of a mountain and you would
[1:55:19] from where you're standing you would
[1:55:21] think they're couldn't possibly be a
[1:55:24] crack or a gouge for that little thing's
[1:55:28] hoof to go in but he is scaling what
[1:55:32] looks like a straight up mountain right
[1:55:34] up right up at the top it's straight up
[1:55:36] and I have watched those icks do that
[1:55:39] and that's what the scripture is talking
[1:55:40] about when he talks about making our
[1:55:43] feet like H's feet so that we can climb
[1:55:46] be very
[1:55:47] surefooted so in this little experience
[1:55:50] I don't want to put too much emphasis on
[1:55:52] that but just to tell you why we're
[1:55:53] where we are today um I
[1:55:56] ask I ask the question how will we do
[1:55:59] that how how do how do
[1:56:03] we remain
[1:56:05] surefooted how do we make sure that
[1:56:08] we're climbing with sure-footedness does
[1:56:10] everybody understand the word and I
[1:56:13] heard five voices five things five
[1:56:17] people that I recognized and we have
[1:56:19] gotten to number five today the first
[1:56:22] one one I heard the voice of brother
[1:56:23] Perry
[1:56:24] green and I heard him say whatever you
[1:56:28] do keep your
[1:56:30] balance in the scriptures right so I
[1:56:33] preached that several
[1:56:35] Services read it to you from from the
[1:56:38] book acts of the prophet and told you
[1:56:42] the times that brother green would
[1:56:45] retell this story brother brandham looks
[1:56:48] at brother green and he said brother
[1:56:50] Perry whatever you do
[1:56:53] keep your balance in the
[1:56:55] scriptures because some people will take
[1:56:58] quotations way off out there
[1:57:02] somewhere where they can't ever even
[1:57:04] link them back to the
[1:57:06] book and I believe he knew that was
[1:57:08] going to be the tendency of the people
[1:57:11] you can get in some of those things that
[1:57:12] you read in the church age book that are
[1:57:14] not in the entirety of the message you
[1:57:17] won't find them anywhere else in brother
[1:57:19] brandom's preaching but you'll find them
[1:57:21] there in that church AG book and people
[1:57:23] would get way out there on a limb
[1:57:25] somewhere so disconnected from the
[1:57:29] scripture God must have known that
[1:57:31] brother green would have a tendency to
[1:57:33] do that so he spoke to him and I heard
[1:57:36] brother Green's voice I'm I I'm not
[1:57:38] trying to communicate with the dead I
[1:57:40] didn't see brother green I just heard
[1:57:41] the voice and you know that's a very for
[1:57:44] me a very familiar voice said whatever
[1:57:46] you do keep your balance in the
[1:57:48] scripture so I believe the Lord was
[1:57:50] saying to me at least if I'm going to
[1:57:52] remain surefooted this year and in the
[1:57:54] future I better keep my balance in the
[1:57:57] scripture the second voice I heard was
[1:57:59] actually the voice of brother
[1:58:01] brandham I recognize it you listen
[1:58:04] enough you'll recognize it some of you
[1:58:07] wouldn't recognize it if I played him
[1:58:08] here today because you don't take the
[1:58:11] time that you should take to hear what
[1:58:14] God has said to us in this day I heard
[1:58:17] that voice and he said whatever you do
[1:58:20] stay in the middle of the the
[1:58:23] road so I took a few services on that
[1:58:25] don't get too far off don't get too far
[1:58:29] off out there stay in the middle of the
[1:58:31] road keep your balance stay in the
[1:58:32] middle of the road that's the highest
[1:58:34] place the trash washes to the are you
[1:58:36] with me hello let me hear you and then I
[1:58:40] heard a woman's
[1:58:41] voice someone who meant something to me
[1:58:44] in my life sister Ruth and I heard her
[1:58:48] say whatever you do praise until the
[1:58:51] spirit of worship comes comes worship
[1:58:53] until the glory comes and then stand in
[1:58:55] the glory she was reemphasizing to me
[1:58:59] the importance of praise and worship
[1:59:01] someone recently visited this church and
[1:59:03] said man you people take praise and
[1:59:05] worship serious aren't we supposed to I
[1:59:08] heard where he said recently I found
[1:59:11] recently I'm listening to and he said
[1:59:13] it's the very reason yes that you were
[1:59:17] created you were created to worship God
[1:59:23] and he said when you come together to
[1:59:25] church you come together to worship God
[1:59:29] he said in that quotation it's the sole
[1:59:33] reason why you
[1:59:40] gather you see you could hear the word
[1:59:42] at
[1:59:42] home as this great movement is trying to
[1:59:45] tell us we don't need to be gathered
[1:59:47] together we just stay home and meet at
[1:59:49] the same time and hear a tape
[1:59:52] but that doesn't fulfill everything he
[1:59:54] said he said you your sole purpose of
[1:59:57] coming together is to worship God we
[1:59:59] need each other come on now I need you
[2:00:03] and you need me and we need to create a
[2:00:06] corporate
[2:00:07] atmosphere and then the fourth
[2:00:10] thing was some was a voice that I
[2:00:12] recognize if someone doesn't believe
[2:00:15] what I believe he's passed on now he
[2:00:16] didn't believe what I believe but he had
[2:00:18] some influence in my life I believe God
[2:00:20] used me in his life I gave gave you all
[2:00:22] those
[2:00:23] testimonies and I heard Bob Jones say
[2:00:25] whatever you
[2:00:26] do you must learn to love so I preached
[2:00:31] seven services on love and now the last
[2:00:34] this morning number five I heard my
[2:00:37] precious granny my dear old big mama she
[2:00:41] said whatever you do remember
[2:00:44] son the
[2:00:48] anointing how about you read it for me
[2:00:53] the
[2:00:54] anointing makes the difference how many
[2:00:57] of you know you can have a
[2:00:59] talent even a gift but it's not the
[2:01:03] trained
[2:01:05] voice it's not the trained musician that
[2:01:09] makes the difference it's the
[2:01:12] anointing that slices through the
[2:01:17] darkness it's the anointing that makes
[2:01:20] the difference and what is the anointing
[2:01:22] the
[2:01:23] logos the spirit of Jesus Christ the
[2:01:27] shakina of Glory the pillar of fire the
[2:01:30] full manifestation of God by the
[2:01:33] spirit and so I want to share this with
[2:01:36] you are you with me yes do I have I will
[2:01:38] say 20 minutes 30 minutes
[2:01:42] here now this
[2:01:44] happened just a few days before my
[2:01:47] grandmother passed away and I'm I'm just
[2:01:49] going to set the context of when she
[2:01:52] told me
[2:01:53] this she was uh dying you all know the
[2:01:56] story she knew she
[2:01:58] was and I had come down from South
[2:02:00] Carolina where I was pastoring was
[2:02:02] staying with her a few days my aunt was
[2:02:04] also there and I woke up one morning and
[2:02:08] my grandmother said honey I want you to
[2:02:09] go take a shower and I said do I do I
[2:02:11] need another shower I I she said no she
[2:02:15] said but this I want you to take a
[2:02:17] shower don't put on any deodorant don't
[2:02:19] put on any uh cologne or any spray or
[2:02:23] anything like that and and she said
[2:02:25] because I want to spend some time with
[2:02:27] you just you and I and she was doing
[2:02:30] that because she was it was her lungs it
[2:02:33] was in her lungs and the cancer started
[2:02:36] perhaps in her female organs they didn't
[2:02:39] find it cuz she didn't go to the doctor
[2:02:41] they didn't find it until it was already
[2:02:43] in the lungs and they wouldn't have
[2:02:46] found it in the lungs but she had that
[2:02:47] car accident in in Montgomery coming
[2:02:51] back from my Revival Ral in in montavo
[2:02:53] where I was preaching in montavo Alabama
[2:02:55] she had the car accident and while they
[2:02:57] were they took her you know she didn't
[2:02:59] want to go the hospital then you you
[2:03:01] remember the story she is she comes to
[2:03:04] herself sitting outside her catalac she
[2:03:09] has gone through the
[2:03:10] windshield as far as we
[2:03:13] know and all the all the windows were
[2:03:16] burst and she is sitting up against she
[2:03:19] was a large woman as you know and uh she
[2:03:23] was sitting up against the driver's seat
[2:03:26] door if I remember correctly with her
[2:03:28] back propped up against the the the car
[2:03:30] door and no one knows how she got there
[2:03:34] and she couldn't remember how she got
[2:03:36] there but she's sitting up when they get
[2:03:39] there and she has a laceration across
[2:03:42] all the way across her forehead and it
[2:03:44] had it's taken the skin and and the
[2:03:47] tissue and has peeled it down and she's
[2:03:50] holding it
[2:03:52] out of her eyes so that she can see the
[2:03:56] the paramedics it just just peeled it
[2:03:58] down it was still connected but just
[2:04:00] peeled it down and they said to her
[2:04:02] we've got to get you in the ambulance
[2:04:04] Michelli because they found her purse
[2:04:07] and her ID we've got to get you in the
[2:04:09] ambulance she said I don't want to go to
[2:04:11] the hospital she said my grandson's
[2:04:13] number is in there call him he'll pray
[2:04:17] it'll be all
[2:04:19] right and they said well h no ma' no no
[2:04:22] ma'am you don't understand you know
[2:04:25] you've come through the
[2:04:27] windshield maybe we're not sure how you
[2:04:30] got
[2:04:31] out uh and you you could be broken your
[2:04:35] bones could be broken we we don't know
[2:04:37] the extent of your condition and and at
[2:04:41] least you're going to need a lot of
[2:04:43] stitches at the very least she said I
[2:04:45] know what you said but she said you
[2:04:47] don't understand what prayer can
[2:04:50] do and she said if you'll just get in
[2:04:52] touch with him he'll pray it'll be all
[2:04:54] right and they said I tell you what
[2:04:55] we'll make a deal with you let us get
[2:04:57] you in the ambulance and we will call
[2:05:00] him on the way to the hospital well she
[2:05:02] agreed with that by the way I forgot to
[2:05:05] mention she had a purse under her arm
[2:05:07] when she's sitting there so we don't
[2:05:09] know how that happened while she is
[2:05:11] there in the hospital they're x-raying
[2:05:14] to see if they're broken bones and they
[2:05:16] find that both lungs are filled with
[2:05:19] cancer she'd never had a symptom
[2:05:22] they believe that it started in the
[2:05:23] female organs she decided to have a
[2:05:26] little portion of her lung removed and
[2:05:28] no
[2:05:29] radiation and she still lived several
[2:05:33] years and I don't remember now I'd have
[2:05:35] to sit down at least at least two years
[2:05:38] I think but I would have to look and
[2:05:41] see so now she's coming to the end of
[2:05:44] her life she's she didn't waste away she
[2:05:46] was a large woman she's lost a lot of
[2:05:49] weight she still looks good
[2:05:53] uh she still had somebody come in and
[2:05:56] put her hair up so it was still up in
[2:05:59] the Pentecost away and I just I ran
[2:06:03] immediately and took another shower I
[2:06:05] was going to do whatever she wanted me
[2:06:06] to do I was there for her so I come in
[2:06:10] and she began to talk to me she said sit
[2:06:12] down here on the side of the bed I want
[2:06:13] to tell you about a vision that I had
[2:06:17] and I want you to remember
[2:06:20] it and so I I wrote this I I want to
[2:06:24] give God thanks for
[2:06:26] RJ I don't see him this morning but he
[2:06:30] has done a real labor of love for me I
[2:06:32] texted him last night and thanked him uh
[2:06:36] again for what he had done he has taken
[2:06:38] a software and he has put all of brother
[2:06:41] brandom's recorded sermons all of the
[2:06:44] sermons here all of the prophecies here
[2:06:46] all of the Visions into one software to
[2:06:50] search so in about an hour I was able to
[2:06:54] search through every time that I have
[2:06:56] told this about my granny and I was able
[2:06:58] to pull together the details and I'm
[2:07:01] going to read it to you I didn't take
[2:07:02] time to write it well but that's not
[2:07:05] important for
[2:07:06] now she began to talk to me about a
[2:07:09] vision the Lord had given her she
[2:07:10] described seeing a large wheel something
[2:07:14] that reminded her of an Old Wagon Wheel
[2:07:17] I want you to try to see that in your
[2:07:18] mind an old western Wagon Wheel she said
[2:07:22] in this wheel there were
[2:07:24] spokes that went out in different
[2:07:27] directions that would be consistent with
[2:07:29] what a wagon wheel would look like is
[2:07:31] that right she said in this experience
[2:07:35] the spirit of the Lord would come to her
[2:07:37] and take her out a spoke of the
[2:07:41] wheel she said I felt myself journeying
[2:07:44] I felt myself traveling moving out the
[2:07:49] spoke of the wheel
[2:07:52] and God would let her see various
[2:07:55] conditions and Perils of the world stay
[2:07:58] with me just a moment she said in in one
[2:08:02] of those at the end of one of those
[2:08:04] fokes she saw
[2:08:05] famine she saw War she saw
[2:08:09] earthquakes she saw riots with people
[2:08:11] fighting in the streets she saw
[2:08:14] perverted Lifestyles becoming common she
[2:08:18] saw unrighteous living she saw people
[2:08:22] dying from dreaded diseases and
[2:08:25] afflictions such awful things she said
[2:08:29] some like she had never really seen
[2:08:31] before and after traveling down each one
[2:08:34] of those Spokes and seeing what she saw
[2:08:39] she would become so weary and so
[2:08:42] weakened from everything that she saw
[2:08:46] she said I even began to feel fearful of
[2:08:49] what it would be like to live in a world
[2:08:51] in that
[2:08:53] condition she described feeling like she
[2:08:56] would not be able to stand
[2:08:58] anymore she even began to say Lord I
[2:09:01] don't think I can see anymore I don't
[2:09:03] think I can take
[2:09:05] anymore she said I was very thankful
[2:09:08] that I only saw glimpses of these
[2:09:10] horrible
[2:09:11] things but every single time hear me
[2:09:15] every single time when she would feel
[2:09:17] nearly hopeless and overwhelmed the
[2:09:21] spirit of God would carry her back down
[2:09:23] the smoke I don't know how to describe
[2:09:26] it I'm just telling you what she said
[2:09:28] and I believe
[2:09:29] it and she found herself each time
[2:09:33] carried back down the spoke of the wheel
[2:09:36] into what she called the Hub of the
[2:09:39] wheel you know what I'm talking about
[2:09:40] don't you and she said at the Hub of the
[2:09:44] wheel was the
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:48] anointing she would go on to say it was
[2:09:50] the of fire it was the shik of Glory it
[2:09:55] was the very anointing of Jesus
[2:09:58] Christ it was true she said in the hub I
[2:10:02] was overwhelmed and overshadowed by his
[2:10:06] spirit and His glory and everything she
[2:10:09] needed was
[2:10:11] supplied in those few moments hear
[2:10:15] me in the
[2:10:17] anointing she was
[2:10:20] revived she she was
[2:10:22] sustained the first time that she
[2:10:24] arrived in the hub she she told me that
[2:10:28] the Lord spoke to her and said daughter
[2:10:31] this is my
[2:10:32] anointing you will find that no matter
[2:10:35] what is happening around you there will
[2:10:38] always be peace and strength in my
[2:10:41] anointing keep your mind on me live in
[2:10:46] my
[2:10:47] anointing no matter what My bride is
[2:10:50] faced with she must remember my spirit
[2:10:54] my anointing will be available for her
[2:10:58] to reach out and take a hold
[2:11:01] of after a bit she would be ushered down
[2:11:04] another
[2:11:06] spoke and see glimpses of more more
[2:11:09] turmoil followed each time with a
[2:11:11] journey back to the hub back to the
[2:11:14] anointing she spoke other things to me
[2:11:16] that day very prophetic of what was to
[2:11:18] come in our church in our ministry she
[2:11:21] she described exactly what was going to
[2:11:23] happen when we came back to bring the
[2:11:27] message so
[2:11:30] clear but the dearest
[2:11:33] thing that I remember her saying to me
[2:11:35] in all of that Vision in all of that
[2:11:39] experience it was the last real
[2:11:42] conversation that we had together within
[2:11:46] just a day or so she would be
[2:11:50] gone
[2:11:51] she said this remember
[2:11:55] son the
[2:11:57] anointing
[2:11:59] makes the
[2:12:01] difference I want to ask you if you
[2:12:04] understand that the anointing makes a
[2:12:07] difference you may get to a place out
[2:12:10] there on the other end of that of that
[2:12:12] spoke where you feel so overwhelmed do
[2:12:15] you ever get caught up by watching
[2:12:17] what's happening around you in the
[2:12:19] world and you almost began to feel
[2:12:22] fearful of what the future will hold
[2:12:25] with crazy elections like we're having
[2:12:27] and and and all the the wokeness of our
[2:12:31] society and with the familiarity of
[2:12:34] perversion and homosexuality and all the
[2:12:37] things that that used to never be talked
[2:12:39] about and now they're being paraded on
[2:12:42] the television and in the movies and and
[2:12:45] it's in your face all the time and they
[2:12:47] can't even advertise salting crackers
[2:12:51] without doing it with two
[2:12:54] men two men have to eat saltin crackers
[2:12:58] together come on it's the sickness of
[2:13:00] the world we live in they want it in
[2:13:03] every part of our society and you get
[2:13:06] caught up some time looking at all of
[2:13:08] that swirl and you think I won't be able
[2:13:10] to make it just like granny had in the
[2:13:13] experience she said then all of a sudden
[2:13:16] he ushered me yes back down into the Hub
[2:13:20] and everything I needed hear me Church
[2:13:23] everything I needed to be sustained
[2:13:25] everything I needed to be strengthened
[2:13:27] was found in his presence how many of
[2:13:32] you found that to be so even in your own
[2:13:34] life are you with me yes I need just a
[2:13:37] few more moments would you go to Isaiah
[2:13:40] chapter
[2:13:41] 10 I knew it'd be a little hard getting
[2:13:44] that out but I wanted you to know why
[2:13:46] that phrase meant so much to me remember
[2:13:49] son the
[2:13:52] anointing makes the
[2:13:54] difference haven't you ever heard
[2:13:56] someone who could who could really speak
[2:13:58] and say such wonderful
[2:14:01] things and yet there was no anointing
[2:14:04] there and it just rolled off of
[2:14:07] you or sing with like an angel and it
[2:14:10] was such a beautiful sound but there was
[2:14:12] no anointing so it didn't penetrate it
[2:14:15] didn't strengthen it didn't bless it
[2:14:18] didn't favor your life it's because the
[2:14:21] anointing is what makes the difference
[2:14:23] come on you just I I I I I remember
[2:14:26] hearing brother random say you know uh
[2:14:28] you just get an old cornpone preacher Ju
[2:14:30] Just get somebody barely with an
[2:14:32] education he could say that and really
[2:14:34] be talking about his own self barely an
[2:14:37] education but he said when that
[2:14:39] anointing
[2:14:40] Falls nobody cares what school he's been
[2:14:44] to nobody cares if he can hit the
[2:14:48] highest note or the lowest note hello
[2:14:51] because it's the anointing it's the
[2:14:54] logos it's the spirit of the lord it's
[2:14:57] the pillar of fire that makes the
[2:15:01] difference therefore Isaiah 10:24
[2:15:04] therefore thus sayith the Lord God of
[2:15:06] hosts oh my people that dwellest in Zion
[2:15:11] be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall
[2:15:15] smite thee with a rod and shall lift up
[2:15:17] his staff against thee and the manner of
[2:15:19] Egypt after the manner of Egypt for yet
[2:15:22] a very little while and the indignation
[2:15:25] shall cease and M anger in their
[2:15:28] destruction and the Lord of host shall
[2:15:31] stir up a scorge against him or for him
[2:15:34] according to the slaughter of Midian at
[2:15:37] the rock of orb and as his Rod was upon
[2:15:41] the sea so shall be lift it up after so
[2:15:45] shall he lift it up he not be sorry
[2:15:48] after the manner of Egypt
[2:15:51] now I don't know if you remember the
[2:15:52] slaughter of
[2:15:53] Midian but this was quite a Slaughter
[2:15:56] it's found in Numbers chapter 31 and
[2:15:59] although we won't take time right now to
[2:16:02] get the detail God took 12,000 little
[2:16:05] soldiers from each
[2:16:07] tribe and God began to uh release that
[2:16:11] Army and they began to Smite the
[2:16:15] midianites killed their five
[2:16:17] Kings and all nearly all the men but if
[2:16:22] you'll remember correctly they saved the
[2:16:25] women and
[2:16:26] children the Bible said the spirit of
[2:16:28] God fell on Moses he was
[2:16:31] angry he was angry and he began to call
[2:16:33] out to them why did you spare the
[2:16:38] women and he said I want you to go back
[2:16:41] and I want you to slay all the women and
[2:16:43] their
[2:16:45] sons I only want you to leave the virgin
[2:16:49] girls alive that's right but every
[2:16:52] everybody else I want you to take them
[2:16:54] all down now that's a controversial
[2:16:57] happening you know the world that hates
[2:16:59] God and hates the Bible they don't
[2:17:02] understand these kinds of things but God
[2:17:05] had a purpose in getting rid of that
[2:17:06] midianite spirit and how it was vexing
[2:17:10] the Israelites and God gave them The
[2:17:12] Spoils of War he gave them livestock and
[2:17:15] goods and they were divided among the
[2:17:18] Israelites and a portion was set aside
[2:17:21] for the priesthood and so forth and you
[2:17:23] might remember some of that and so God
[2:17:25] is comparing through the prophet Isaiah
[2:17:28] the slaughter at Midian to how God is
[2:17:32] going to deal with the
[2:17:34] Assyrians so the prophet is prophesying
[2:17:37] to Israel and saying it may look like
[2:17:40] that Assyria is going to Prevail
[2:17:43] forever but just like God suddenly
[2:17:46] changed things in the camp of the
[2:17:49] midians there's going to be a change are
[2:17:53] you are you caught up with me and then
[2:17:55] verse 27 you you're you're familiar with
[2:17:57] this and it shall come to pass oh I wish
[2:18:00] you were with me because this is about
[2:18:03] to get good for anybody that has an ear
[2:18:05] to hear it and I hope you will and it
[2:18:07] shall come to pass in that day are you
[2:18:10] here that his
[2:18:13] burden the Assyrian
[2:18:15] burden shall be taken away from off thy
[2:18:19] shoulder and his yoke shall be taken
[2:18:23] from off thy
[2:18:26] neck and the
[2:18:29] Yoke shall
[2:18:31] be
[2:18:35] destroyed
[2:18:40] because because of the
[2:18:43] anointing Brandy said remember son the
[2:18:47] anointing makes the
[2:18:49] difference I'd say in America we need
[2:18:52] the
[2:18:53] anointing I'd say in this church we need
[2:18:56] the anointing I'd say in my family I
[2:18:58] need the anointing I'd say in my life as
[2:19:02] an individual I need the anointing in
[2:19:05] this ministry I need the anointing it's
[2:19:09] the anointing that
[2:19:11] destroys the
[2:19:15] Yol now the Amplified says it this way
[2:19:18] did I give that to you charity no
[2:19:21] the Amplified says it this way and it's
[2:19:23] good for you to catch this because of
[2:19:26] the fatness stay with
[2:19:29] me because of the
[2:19:32] fatness the yoke is
[2:19:35] destroyed
[2:19:37] because of the fatness see it destroyed
[2:19:41] because of the fatness which prevents
[2:19:49] it oo glory to
[2:19:53] God my 18 neck is said Woo Jesus help me
[2:19:57] thank you
[2:19:59] Lord it's getting
[2:20:01] bigger spiritually I
[2:20:06] hope cuz I'm H you know I just bar I
[2:20:08] just barely butt in the
[2:20:11] 18 I was with Joshua a few minutes
[2:20:14] yesterday we ran in a Men's Warehouse
[2:20:17] with Joshua and I said honey they've
[2:20:18] even got 20 in neck shirts here he said
[2:20:23] I saw that I said I don't want
[2:20:26] one we're not talking about natural now
[2:20:28] we're talking about
[2:20:30] spiritual God is saying the uh the neck
[2:20:34] come on of the Israelites got so
[2:20:39] fat became so
[2:20:42] anointed so full of oil that the Yoke
[2:20:46] that Assyria had placed on her could no
[2:20:50] longer hold her
[2:20:53] back the anointing was so rich and the
[2:20:58] neck became so fat that the Yoke was
[2:21:04] burst from off of her neck from off of
[2:21:08] her shoulders anybody with
[2:21:10] me the Hebrew word used in this verse
[2:21:14] has more than one possible meaning we
[2:21:16] have words like that in our English as
[2:21:18] well let me explain how the Hebrew word
[2:21:21] is translated elsewhere in the Bible
[2:21:23] real quick I looked at
[2:21:25] all
[2:21:27] 100 93
[2:21:30] verses I did myself not in a list
[2:21:35] looking them
[2:21:39] up3 times this Hebrew word is used in
[2:21:44] the Old
[2:21:45] Testament for
[2:21:48] anointing over say 100 1 73 times that
[2:21:53] Hebrew word is translated
[2:21:57] oil 10 times
[2:22:00] ointment four times Olive two times
[2:22:06] fertile two times rich as in rich
[2:22:11] food once it is translated fat or
[2:22:16] fatness and only one time and that's
[2:22:19] Isaiah where we read reading only one
[2:22:22] time is it translated anointing because
[2:22:26] the anointing and the oil was used
[2:22:30] interchangeably because God compounded a
[2:22:34] recipe for the holy anointing oil
[2:22:37] remember and the holy anointing oil was
[2:22:41] used to anoint the
[2:22:44] priesthood and and remember what the
[2:22:46] word says about Unity how how pleasant
[2:22:49] it is for Brethren to dwell together in
[2:22:52] unity it is like the the oil it is like
[2:22:56] the
[2:22:56] anointing it is like the fatness that
[2:23:00] ran down Aaron's
[2:23:02] beard all the way down to the cloak of
[2:23:05] His Garment so do you know what God
[2:23:07] thinks about people when they move
[2:23:09] together in the
[2:23:12] spirit instead of pulling against each
[2:23:14] other all the time when they start
[2:23:17] moving together in the spirit God says
[2:23:20] that's most beautiful thing it it's the
[2:23:23] anointing it takes the anointing to move
[2:23:26] together it takes the oil of
[2:23:30] God sir so I would say that that
[2:23:33] anointing that oil that ointment is
[2:23:36] precious and it's it's necessary and it
[2:23:40] makes a difference few more
[2:23:44] moments it's also come to be associated
[2:23:47] with the
[2:23:49] Messiah because the Messiah is called
[2:23:52] what the anointed
[2:23:55] one the
[2:23:57] NIV which I often refer to as the nearly
[2:24:01] inspired
[2:24:02] version says it this way I'm I'm shocked
[2:24:06] I want to be fair and I want to tell you
[2:24:09] I'm shocked by the accuracy of this
[2:24:12] particular translation in this
[2:24:15] particular place when it's so nearly
[2:24:18] inspired in other places
[2:24:21] they finally got one right in that day
[2:24:24] their burden will be lifted from your
[2:24:26] shoulders their Yol from your neck the
[2:24:30] Yoke will be broken because you have
[2:24:34] grown so
[2:24:38] fat all you people on the diet are
[2:24:42] squirming in your
[2:24:47] seats he not talking about physical
[2:24:52] fatness he's talking about spiritual
[2:24:56] blessing he's talking about leadership
[2:24:59] of the holy spirit in your life and you
[2:25:02] become so
[2:25:04] enriched so engorged so fat on the an my
[2:25:08] God I want to be so fat by the
[2:25:11] [Applause]
[2:25:13] anointing in the natural I would like to
[2:25:16] be a lot Slimmer than I am but in the
[2:25:19] anointing
[2:25:20] yes sir
[2:25:23] hey no I didn't fall I'm okay I guess I
[2:25:27] leaned over too
[2:25:30] far in the anointing I want to be
[2:25:34] obese I want to be so big that the devil
[2:25:38] cannot get a yoke on my
[2:25:41] neck so blessed that he cannot put a
[2:25:46] illegal burden on my shoulder hear me
[2:25:49] yes sir in the Bible a Yol was a wooden
[2:25:53] beam normally used between a pair of
[2:25:57] oxen or other animals to enable them to
[2:26:00] pull together on a load or a plow it was
[2:26:03] a common agricultural tool in ancient
[2:26:05] times for tilling fields and
[2:26:07] transporting heavy loads if I were to
[2:26:10] give you a simple definition of a yoke
[2:26:11] it would be this a device used to govern
[2:26:15] and control directionally right oh I'm
[2:26:19] mad come
[2:26:21] on I'm mad I don't want the devil to
[2:26:24] govern
[2:26:25] me I don't want this world and it's
[2:26:28] charms to have government in my life
[2:26:31] hello hello hello hello I don't want the
[2:26:34] passions of this world or the pulls of
[2:26:36] My Flesh to govern me or to control me
[2:26:39] directionally I don't want the devil
[2:26:41] pulling RS one way and moving Me In One
[2:26:44] Direction pulling them another and
[2:26:45] moving me let me tell you the devil will
[2:26:47] play all day with
[2:26:48] you if you let let him lay his yoke on
[2:26:51] your shoulder he'll play with you all
[2:26:55] day he'll jerk you all over this house
[2:27:00] if you let him but there's a
[2:27:05] remedy there's a remedy you don't have
[2:27:09] to be controlled by the Reigns of the
[2:27:11] devil any
[2:27:13] longer you don't have to wear his
[2:27:17] Yol you can be free
[2:27:20] you can get a neck so fat that the Yoke
[2:27:23] of the devil burst come
[2:27:27] on
[2:27:29] how
[2:27:32] because of the
[2:27:39] anointing it has been proven in our
[2:27:42] generation that you can take the most
[2:27:44] anointed message that's ever been
[2:27:47] delivered to humanity and make it no
[2:27:49] more more than Creeds and
[2:27:55] dogmas churches all over this world
[2:27:58] mostly in America and
[2:28:01] Canada sit like dust
[2:28:05] wads dust
[2:28:07] bunnies on a
[2:28:08] Pew afraid that if they were to get a
[2:28:11] little happy they'll break the
[2:28:13] sacredness of the
[2:28:16] hour not I'm not say everyone I said
[2:28:18] some and there's there's plenty of them
[2:28:21] so dead so dry sing the same old song
[2:28:25] get the same old
[2:28:28] results right nothing ever happening
[2:28:31] nothing ever moving preacher preach Like
[2:28:34] a Man on
[2:28:36] Fire out the
[2:28:38] door come on on never a prayer offered
[2:28:42] on never an altar
[2:28:44] call I know it's a Methodist
[2:28:47] tradition but I understand what God can
[2:28:49] do when you come close I believe I heard
[2:28:52] a prophet say that right here is the
[2:28:54] closest you'll get that's right to the
[2:28:57] presence of God when he comes brother
[2:29:00] brandom said he comes right down over
[2:29:02] that pull pit and he wasn't just talk
[2:29:05] about his own he said so you ought to
[2:29:07] want to get as close to this there's
[2:29:09] nothing in this box it symbolizes
[2:29:12] something I'm just telling you I didn't
[2:29:15] make it up and I didn't say it and it's
[2:29:16] not original so you ought to want to get
[2:29:19] as close to this
[2:29:21] as you possibly can I'm GNA let that
[2:29:23] sink in a
[2:29:26] minute so that means every opportunity
[2:29:29] that you have you ought to want to draw
[2:29:31] close not to the not to the desk to the
[2:29:35] anointing that it
[2:29:36] represents to the freedom that it
[2:29:38] represents to the are you hear me yes
[2:29:40] sir to the favor that it
[2:29:44] represents yes sir so hungry if you're
[2:29:47] hungry don't hang the back door if
[2:29:50] you're hungry come on every now and
[2:29:52] again I'm not trying to bust you out of
[2:29:55] your routine but ever now and again when
[2:29:58] folks come to worship why don't you
[2:30:02] come why don't you draw a little closer
[2:30:04] to the fire draw a little closer to the
[2:30:09] fire recognize your visitation hour let
[2:30:15] the spirit have control cleanse and
[2:30:18] sanctify your soul Oh Come a Little
[2:30:21] Closer to the fire I wrote that when I
[2:30:25] was 10 come come a little closer to the
[2:30:30] fire that's where God wants to meet
[2:30:34] you why because the
[2:30:39] anointing
[2:30:42] destroys the
[2:30:43] Yoke 10 more
[2:30:46] minutes metaphorically the term yoke is
[2:30:49] also used in the Bible to symbolize
[2:30:51] servitude and subjugation and oppression
[2:30:54] anybody ever been oppressed by the enemy
[2:30:56] do you get the picture here is an ox a
[2:30:59] beast of burden with the yolk on his
[2:31:00] neck you know enslaving it to the will
[2:31:02] of the master and forcing it into a life
[2:31:05] of servitude that's what the devil wants
[2:31:06] to do for you he wants to beat you on
[2:31:09] your back and tell you where to
[2:31:18] go but
[2:31:21] eventually this this oxen this
[2:31:25] Ox gets so
[2:31:27] healthy he's eating so
[2:31:31] good he's drinking so good he's feasting
[2:31:35] so fine that he gets so
[2:31:39] healthy praise God and so fat from being
[2:31:44] so well fed
[2:31:46] spiritually that his neck begins to
[2:31:48] swell
[2:31:52] the devil don't even know what's
[2:31:53] happening the devil says woo he's
[2:31:55] getting more energy more strength he can
[2:31:57] work harder for
[2:31:59] me oh the more he eats the stronger he
[2:32:02] gets he can work harder in the field he
[2:32:04] doesn't know that the very thing that he
[2:32:06] thinks is a good thing is really a bad
[2:32:09] thing to him because you are about to
[2:32:11] burst his
[2:32:14] yoke nothing let me tell you something

[2:36:17] feeling you'll

[2:36:22] you start busting the devil's yoke off
[2:36:24] your
[2:36:24] neck when the things that have troubled
[2:36:27] you trouble you no
[2:36:29] more when you have a testimony like
[2:36:31] David had here Tuesday
[2:36:33] night that's when you have fed on
[2:36:36] pornography and fed on pornography until
[2:36:39] you get sick of

[2:36:43] your mind you hear the word you make up
[2:36:45] your mind I'm going to fast he didn't SP

[2:37:10] believe God's calling you I don't
[2:37:12] believe in extended fast unless you know
[2:37:14] God's calling you to that cuz you're
[2:37:16] going to need him to sustain you and you
[2:37:18] need a prayer covering you need somebody
[2:37:21] praying for you I know you don't go
[2:37:24] around telling the whole church but you
[2:37:26] need somebody calling your name before
[2:37:28] the Lord and he said this to
[2:37:30] me and he even came to a place where he
[2:37:33] felt like the Deliverance was coming and
[2:37:36] he thought he could end the fast and
[2:37:38] decided not to and went on to the
[2:37:41] end he said to me I'm not
[2:37:44] hungry worked every day I said David
[2:37:48] you're going to try I I we shouldn't be
[2:37:49] talking about fasting with a name
[2:37:51] attached but anyway we're doing it
[2:37:54] forgive
[2:37:55] us he didn't say all this in his
[2:37:57] testimony just God freed him from
[2:37:59] something that he dealt with since he
[2:38:00] was 11 years old his neck got fat amen
[2:38:05] he got in the presence of God he cut
[2:38:07] everything else out of his life you
[2:38:09] start cutting things out of your life
[2:38:11] and get fat on
[2:38:13] Jesus get fat on that word let your neck
[2:38:16] start growing on that word and that
[2:38:18] presence of God come
[2:38:20] on I said David you going to work he
[2:38:22] said I'm going to work as long as I can
[2:38:25] when I can't work I'm going to have to
[2:38:26] explain to him why he worked the whole
[2:38:31] time
[2:38:33] strengthened cooked his wife breakfast
[2:38:35] at least one
[2:38:37] time he was determined I said you know
[2:38:40] son some people can't really go that
[2:38:42] long just on water it's according to
[2:38:46] your body the shape the condition of
[2:38:48] your body what's going on in your body
[2:38:49] body you got to watch that I said you
[2:38:52] can get
[2:38:53] weak way before the end of his fast he
[2:38:55] could have gotten weak to the point that
[2:38:58] he wasn't able to move go around and do
[2:39:00] the things he was supposed to do but he
[2:39:01] was determined and if you would have
[2:39:04] said this to me I might not have
[2:39:05] believed you but he said this to me and
[2:39:08] there was something in his voice that I
[2:39:10] believed that he meant business he said
[2:39:12] if I
[2:39:13] die I
[2:39:16] die I thought that sounds radical for
[2:39:20] somebody else to
[2:39:23] say but there was such a desperation in
[2:39:26] his voice he said then I'll be
[2:39:30] free then I won't be tempted and
[2:39:32] tormented by that thing anymore so God's
[2:39:34] either going to free me here or he's
[2:39:36] going to free me that
[2:39:39] way you got a family David you got a
[2:39:41] baby you got I know but I've had to make
[2:39:44] up my mind that nothing
[2:39:47] matters that's too radical for a lot of
[2:39:49] folks here this morning that's too
[2:39:51] radical for some of you come on
[2:39:53] especially folks that get to church once
[2:39:55] or twice a
[2:39:58] year but there Comes A Time In Our Lives
[2:40:01] when we recognize the only thing that's
[2:40:03] going to get us out from under this yoke
[2:40:04] is a fat neck and the only thing that's
[2:40:07] going to get us a fat neck is getting in
[2:40:09] that
[2:40:10] anointing cutting off the telephone come
[2:40:13] on staying off of Facebook on come on
[2:40:16] get in front of his
[2:40:17] face getting off on Instagram and and
[2:40:20] and all the other bluebirds and
[2:40:23] everything else and making up your mind
[2:40:26] I've got to get in that presence because
[2:40:30] it's the anointing that destroys the
[2:40:33] Yol I want you to put up the definition
[2:40:36] of destroy and I'm going to go I'm I'm
[2:40:37] done I I could preach another hour you
[2:40:40] know I could I feel it I'm able but I
[2:40:42] won't here's the definition of destroy
[2:40:45] it doesn't just mean to break it and
[2:40:47] then the devil come along and glue it
[2:40:48] back together right destroy means to
[2:40:51] reduce an object to useless fragments
[2:40:54] that's the Yoke that's the Yoke
[2:40:57] hello a useless form or remain as by
[2:41:01] rending burning or
[2:41:03] dissolving to injure
[2:41:06] Hallelujah Beyond repair or
[2:41:08] renewal to demolish to ruin to
[2:41:12] annihilate to put an end
[2:41:15] to to
[2:41:18] extinguish
[2:41:20] woo are you
[2:41:22] there and it all boils down to this and
[2:41:26] the Yoke shall be destroyed right
[2:41:31] because of the anointing let
[2:41:35] stand Lord we've got to have that
[2:41:39] presence in this busy crazy
[2:41:42] world it's hard to take time it's not
[2:41:45] hard to find time I I hate it when
[2:41:48] people say get that
[2:41:51] way you can find what you're looking
[2:41:54] for it's hard to take time to get in
[2:41:58] that
[2:41:59] word bless every homeschooling
[2:42:03] Mama teach your children more than their
[2:42:07] math and their science and their social
[2:42:11] studies they're in your
[2:42:14] Sanctuary during the
[2:42:16] week teach them what they need need to
[2:42:19] know to get along in life but don't you
[2:42:22] fail to teach them the things that will
[2:42:25] increase the anointing on their life one
[2:42:28] of the reasons why Landon has come to
[2:42:31] the place that he desires to be baptized
[2:42:33] today is because he's he sits in a home
[2:42:36] and I know this because I get uh reports
[2:42:39] from time to time from from
[2:42:43] Samantha of how they he
[2:42:46] listens to what goes on in church
[2:42:49] how it comes out in the in their home
[2:42:52] school and how blessed and happy she is
[2:42:56] as a mama to know that he cares to know
[2:42:59] that her children care about knowing
[2:43:02] something about the word what a freedom
[2:43:05] we have in this nation to build a
[2:43:07] sanctuary in our
[2:43:11] homes not to March our children down to
[2:43:14] Egypt where God has delivered us and
[2:43:17] called us out not to March our children
[2:43:20] down every day and set them under that
[2:43:23] tutorship we're so
[2:43:25] blessed come on does it make a
[2:43:28] difference it certainly it certainly
[2:43:31] makes a
[2:43:33] difference one of the things that
[2:43:35] crossed my mind when I was sitting there
[2:43:37] thinking of how blessed I am I thought
[2:43:40] Lord I Thank you that there has never
[2:43:43] been one sleepless night in my home
[2:43:46] because I didn't know where my children
[2:43:48] were
[2:43:49] right who they were with or what they
[2:43:52] were doing they've not been perfect
[2:43:55] they're not perfect now they'll get on
[2:43:58] my last
[2:44:01] nerve but I'm
[2:44:04] blessed I'm blessed that I've never had
[2:44:06] to sit Al an alarm I've never had to
[2:44:09] knock on the door I've never had to beg
[2:44:11] one of my children out of the bed to
[2:44:13] come to
[2:44:15] church I'm
[2:44:17] blessed and one of the reasons why is
[2:44:20] because their mother made
[2:44:23] sure that serving God was not just a
[2:44:26] Sunday
[2:44:29] Affair but every day Monday through
[2:44:32] Friday they heard their lesson and they
[2:44:34] learned the things that they needed to
[2:44:36] learn to
[2:44:38] appreciate it's
[2:44:42] quiet it is the truth and we ought to
[2:44:45] take full advantage of what God gives us
[2:44:48] there's some of you this this morning
[2:44:50] who've got a heavy Yol on your
[2:44:53] shoulder you've carried something so
[2:44:55] long you don't have to carry that
[2:44:57] anymore you just need to get under that
[2:44:59] anointing

[2:45:06] presence and get in that presence and
[2:45:08] get in that presence it may be gradual
[2:45:10] it may be swelling and you may not know
[2:45:12] it and then one of these days

[2:45:17] Overflow strike you and what the devil

[3:09:09] him in every
[3:09:12] way from the top of his head to the
[3:09:15] bottoms of his little feet yes Lord may
[3:09:18] he grow up to serve you to know you and
[3:09:23] to love
[3:09:25] you may he recognize at an early age the
[3:09:29] benefit of your presence
[3:09:36] sir Lord I pray that the darkness would
[3:09:39] not be able to touch him that he would
[3:09:42] be surrounded in the love and the light
[3:09:44] of almighty God that you would not only
[3:09:49] protect him and keep him physically but
[3:09:51] in every way guard his little fragile
[3:09:54] Spirit Lord until that day that you
[3:09:57] would call him to Salvation yes Lord let
[3:10:00] him lead this little family to deeper
[3:10:01] things in you yes because of him May
[3:10:04] their hearts be turned toward you like
[3:10:07] never before yes Lord father reveal
[3:10:10] yourself to Dad yes what a
[3:10:13] responsibility is now on his
[3:10:16] shoulder
[3:10:18] he took on the responsibility of Sarah a
[3:10:21] wife and now the greatest responsibility
[3:10:24] that he could have is laid on his
[3:10:25] shoulder to be a Godly dad an example of
[3:10:30] righteousness to this little boy because
[3:10:33] everything he learns in life and about
[3:10:36] life is going to come from this Mom and
[3:10:39] Dad and family and so Lord I ask that
[3:10:42] you would allow them to know you in a
[3:10:45] deeper way that you would reveal
[3:10:47] yourself to them in every way I bless
[3:10:52] this Precious
