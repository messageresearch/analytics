Worthy is the lamb. You are holy. [Music] You are holy are you Lord God. Oh my. [Music] Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. You are worthy Jesus. Now just use your own words for just a moment as they play. Lord, we just want to say this evening that you are worthy to be praised. It is our great desire and blessing and thrill when we have an opportunity to exalt your name. You are holy in all of your ways. As the writer said among the gods that people worship, there is no God like unto our God. Oh Lord God of Israel, you are the only true living God and we bless your name this evening. To think that you've given us the privilege of being called by your name. Oh Lord, you deserve more than we're capable of giving. But tonight we yield to give you all that we are, all that we have, all that we do. For you are worthy. We bless you tonight, Jesus. In all your ways, you are holy. Why don't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? Clap your hands, all ye people. He says, shout unto God with a voice of triumph. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He lives. He rules. He reigns. You may be seated this evening. He's sovereign. &gt;&gt; He's good. &gt;&gt; He's perfect in all of his ways. &gt;&gt; We find through the years that many people perhaps did not always have the best experience with their earthly dad. And when that is the case, sometimes it becomes very difficult to relate to God as as both your elder brother and your papa. He's both. The Bible tells us he's both our Aba and he's our elder brother. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's hard for folks to get over their own wound and their own disappointment to be able to relate to him that way. But it's vitally important &gt;&gt; that we learn to love him in all that he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not new age or anything like that, but I'll tell you, he's also like a mother. &gt;&gt; And when I say that, I'm just telling you what the scripture said. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "How often I would have gathered you as a hen would her brood &gt;&gt; and you would not." It's his desire to wrap his arms around us. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a holy God. He's a righteous God &gt;&gt; and he wants a dedicated and consecrated people. &gt;&gt; But he'd much rather love you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And pull you toward him &gt;&gt; than to push you away. If you believe that, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to the Lord in prayer tonight. We have quite a few missing, but we're very thankful that you are here. And some who are here are fighting symptoms and believing that uh that God will give them complete victory. He's still the healer. Yes, &gt;&gt; he really is. &gt;&gt; And some are just facing lots of things and just were not able to be here this evening. Perhaps they'll be able to join us tomorrow. But I'm glad we're here tonight &gt;&gt; for this moment. There's nowhere on the earth I'd rather be &gt;&gt; than right here with you in his presence &gt;&gt; to see what he has for us. Every time we come together, &gt;&gt; he's got something for us. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. There are many needs right here among us. We want to remember Sister Williams to the Lord and we want to ask the Lord to give her a mighty touch. He's more than able. &gt;&gt; He's more than enough. We want to continue to remember brother Paul Drown who is not well this evening. He's in the hospital and they are looking for his uh what manner of treatment they might use and also what manner of pain management they might be able to give him. His heart is here. And he said, "Brother Shelley, I don't know whether I'll be able to stream tonight, but he said somewhere out there, I'll be given my virtual amen." &gt;&gt; And he I believe that that's who he is. And and I always know if I've spoken to him because he'll he virtually amens. And sometime there'll be 39 amens through a sermon, 39 text, but that's because he he wants to be involved even though he can't be here physically. Let's ask the Lord to give him a mighty touch. I really appreciate brother Paul and what he's meant to us through these years. And let's ask the Lord. God is able. &gt;&gt; There there's nothing that intimidates God. No disease, no no diagnosis causes him to back off. &gt;&gt; He's more than enough. And we want to remember the family that will be traveling. Sister Terry will have um more of her children coming in for the memorial service here Friday evening at 6:00 and then a meal to follow and we want to ask the Lord to comfort their hearts as they as they come. It will be fresh to them. you know, uh, those who have lived here, it's been a few weeks now, and they're still, of course, uh, recognizing and realizing the loss, but those who come who haven't been, well, for them, it'll be fresh. I want to pray that the Lord will just comfort them on the way &gt;&gt; and give them safety as they come, and that he'll move Friday night. Let his presence be so real &gt;&gt; that maybe we just catch some kind of glimpse of of Sister Gert Hammond on the other sides. Bless him, Lord. you know, uh, we really, really appreciate the opportunity to do that. Pray for Brother John tonight that God will strengthen him. He drove a mighty long way. He's just a couple of years, my elder. And, uh, we want to pray that the Lord will so refresh him and renew him tonight. &gt;&gt; Um, what a sacrifice he's made to come that far by himself. Thank you so much, brother. Although we'd rather you brought a, you know, a truckload with you. We're glad you're here this evening. Do you have a unspoken request? You just hold up your hand. The Lord knows. He knows there is a need that's real heavy on my heart tonight. There is a body of believers who need the help of the Lord and the grace of the Lord and the leadership of the Lord. And I'd like to ask God to move as only he can. when he gets involved, when he gets in the arrangements, things can shift. &gt;&gt; Please continue to remember the Whitmire family in Edmonton. And those of you may maybe a few of us had an opportunity to stream the service yesterday of Sister Lydia Whitmer who went home to be with the Lord at 90. And Sister Alfreda was giving a eulogy there. And Brother Ed Hammermeister did such a wonderful job. And sister Alfreda was just sort of taking her liberty with her family history and uh it really spoke to me all over again the price that some people have paid to come to the truth. &gt;&gt; You know, some of us haven't lived under threat, &gt;&gt; but they've really paid a price. And to think that there are seven of those nine children who uh who are still alive, that that's incredible. And and at their age, it ranges from about 93 or 94, I think, all the way down. And there's Sister Alfreda talking. And she says, "And and it's hard for me to imagine her 83 because it just happened so quick, but would you pray for that family that God will continue to draw every one of them close to him and comfort their hearts and if they need to go deeper that they will, higher, that they will, whatever their needs are." And there are some lost ones among them that God would reach them. He knows how. He's faithful. Can you stand again? Is it too much to ask you? Pastor, I didn't know you were coming. God bless you. What a surprise. Pastor Isaac is here with his family from Indiana. And we're going to ask him to come and pray over the prayer request tonight. And as he comes, would you just sing with me? Have faith in God. Our faith is not in faith. Faith is a powerful powerful powerful thing. But our faith is not in faith. Our faith is in God. Sing that with me as we prepare to pray. Have faith in God. [Music] Oh, have faith in God. Oh, have faith in God for thee serve. Have faith. Lord, our faith is in you tonight. Sing it one more time. Our faith is in the living God this night. Hallelujah. Oh, have have faith in God. No matter what it is, Lord, you know how. Oh, have faith in God. Oh, have have faith in God for the answer. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Our faith rests in you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lord, when we can't see it, see it, we believe it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, when when things don't line up, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; in the natural, Lord, we believe that you are already working things out for our good. And Lord, we believe your word. And we have come tonight, Lord, in simple faith, believing your word. Lord, whether things are working out or not, Lord, and these prayer requests, Lord, as we lift them up to you, Lord, the the family that lost a loved one, Lord, and and Lord, &gt;&gt; we know how it feels. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that you care for each one. &gt;&gt; And so, Lord, lift them up. We lift them up to you, Lord. And we ask that you touch them, that you encourage them, and Lord, that as as one by one they leave us, Lord, Lord, that we can step up and that we can be the light, that we can be that we can take on the torch, that we can be the fire burning in our day, Lord. That we can be the demonstrators of your word in our day, Lord. that we can simply rest &gt;&gt; in you &gt;&gt; and Lord then fight &gt;&gt; as only you could have us fight &gt;&gt; grant it Lord &gt;&gt; Lord help us Lord help our brother as he comes and brings the word Lord that the Holy Ghost on fire Lord that it be something Lord that it was for the apostles when they when they got out of the upper room Lord where they came out Lord not of themselves Lord but where the people wondered ed in amazement, Lord, at what came forth of their lips, Lord, knowing that never a man spake like this man. Never a man spake like this, Lord. Lord, this is strange. Lord, let it be that it touches hearts and minds. Lord, we've come. We've given you our all. So, Lord, have your way in this place. I thank you for everyone here, Lord, for healing for the ones that are battling. Lord, we ask for healing. We ask for deliverance. We ask for your grace. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As we continue on. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The answer is on the way. Amen. Sing this before you're seated. Oh yes. The answer's on the way. This I know. Jesus said it. I believe it. And it's so. Our heavenly father knows the need before we pray. And you can rest assure the answer's on the way. Oh yes, the answer's on the way. This I know. Jesus said it. I believe it and it's so. Our heavenly father, he knows the need before we pray. And we can rest assured the answers on the way. One more time. Oh yes, the answers. Lord, I believe in you, Lord. I believe it and it's so for our heavenly father knows the need for we pray. Rest assured the answers on the way. And you can rest assured the answers all the way. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Why don't you praise the one who brings the answers? Lord, we thank you. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. You may be seated this evening. We're sure glad to have brother Jordan and his family with us this evening. and they took a few days holiday and they didn't the last thing I said to him was take me with you but he he he said okay maybe but didn't make much effort but I'm glad they came back to be in service with us this evening I just know that God's got something &gt;&gt; and if it's him it's good &gt;&gt; what a good good papa Jonathan are you feeling well why don't you come real I know you've been around brother Gley and he wasn't feeling well and I didn't know if you give it to him or something, you know. &gt;&gt; Then Kate will come right after and sing and brother Thornton has all night, &gt;&gt; all the time he needs. Well, we don't really know but one. It'll be that one. But uh I I looked so hard to find a quote. I wanted to read a quote. And you need to know how you file things. You understand? And and sometimes I file them so good I can never see them again. And that's kind of what I did. But brother Brandon was talking about angels. We don't worship angels. And I don't pray to angels and I don't tell angels what to do, but I like them. &gt;&gt; I'm very thankful to know that I've got some &gt;&gt; helping me out. &gt;&gt; I remember one time, Brother Perry Green got stirred up about angels. &gt;&gt; And if he got stirred up about something, he wanted everybody to be stirred up about it. And he preached s several services in a row on angels. And then he began to tell one story right after another. Some that he had never told publicly before. But he got bold enough. He had preached himself to really believe in in angels. You know, he got so inspired and he started sharing testimonies that he had some never shared before about how angels had assisted him and ministered to him. Help. All the praise goes to God, &gt;&gt; not the angels. But isn't it good to know they're camped around us? &gt;&gt; Amen. Every now and again, we can kind of sense that there's something of another world. We don't know what to call it or maybe don't always see it with our eyes. But the quotation was something like this. You know, we don't see them because we don't believe in them. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; But if we would believe in them, we might get an opportunity. I don't have to see them to believe in them, &gt;&gt; but we might get an opportunity just to catch a little glimpse. If our eyes could be open tonight, we would see that this room is far more crowded than what we realize &gt;&gt; because they're with us. You believe that? &gt;&gt; When I'm broken from the battle and I've lost a another round, Satan whispers to my troubled mind. Oh, lay your armor now. Where are those that you loved and trusted? Look around you. They are gone. Would be easy to surrender when you're standing all alone. But I see a great band of angels camping around me. I see the captain rising up this challenge to me. Oh yes. And I know I'm safe from harm when I'm touching Jesus. Oh no. The battle is his but the victory is mine and victory is sweet. [Music] So I bowed my head in sadness while I pondered what to do. I've been in God's army for so long. I've tried to be a soldier true. That's when I hear a sweet voice from heaven saying, "Pilgrim, it is I." Lift your head and take you courage. Lift your eyes toward the sky. And I see a great band of angels all around. Thank God. Oh, and I see my captain rising up his challenge to me. And I know I'm safe from heart when I'm touching Jesus. Oh, the battle is but the victory is mine. Victory is sweet. Listen again. Then I bowed my head in sadness while I ponder what to do. Oh, I've been in God's army for so long. I've tried to be a soldier. True. That's when I hear a sweet voice from heaven saying, "Pilgrim, it is I." Lift your head and take new courage. Lift your eyes toward the sky. Oh, I see your rain [Music] on Abraham protecting us from harm. I see my captain rising up this challenge to me. Well, then I know I'm save when I'm touching Jesus. For the battle is his, but the victory is mine. I know the battle is his, but the victory. I said the battle is his, but the victory is mine. And victory is sweet. Yes, it is. It's not our victory. It's not our battle. The battle is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your turn. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You should have just stayed here. You should have stayed and sang. [Music] If you have some questions in the corners of your mind, places of discouragement and peace you cannot find, reflections of your past seem to face you every day. But there's one thing that I do know and that's Jesus is the way. Jesus is the answer for the world today. Above him there's no other. Jesus is the way. [Music] Jesus, he's the answer for the world today. Above them, there's no other. Jesus is the way. I know you got those mountains that you think you cannot climb. I know your skies are dark and you think the sun won't shine. In case that you don't know that the word of God is true, well everything that he promised us, I know that he will do it for you. Oh, Jesus is the answer for the world today. Yes, above him there's no other. Jesus is the way. Oh, Jesus is the answer for the world today. Oh, above him there's no other. Jesus is the way. I know you got those mountains that you think you cannot climb. I know your skies are dark and you think the sun won't shine. In case that you don't know that the word of God is true, &gt;&gt; well, everything that he promises, I know that he will do it for you. Jesus is the answer for the world today. Oh, above him there's no other. Oh Jesus is the way. Oh Jesus, he's my answer for the world today. Oh above him there is no other. Oh Jesus is the way. [Music] Jesus is the answer for the world today. Oh, above him there is no other. And Jesus is the way. Oh Jesus, he's the answer for the world today. Oh, above him there's no other.

We give you praise and honor and glory. You You can tell that I don't lead services very often. They said, "You you better take up an offering. Can we do it at the end? Will you all remind me and we'll put a bag at the back? I don't want to disturb what I feel right now. Come on, Brother John Thornton. And just do whatever God puts in your heart. Sing, preach, jump, whatever. We We're ready for whatever the Lord has. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Brother Steve asked me that I want to stay in the back for a little while. How could you do that? How could you stay back there with all this going on out here? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll let you be seated for a moment. You found out the last time I was here, I'm not a singer. Uh for whatever reason over the years, I have lost that voice. It's hard to think that at one time I thought I could sing. Amen. But you know, it's just so good to to be here tonight. I I don't say this carelessly or nonchalant. It is such an honor and a privilege to be able to stand here in front of you people and be part of this service. Uh I just love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wished I could I wish I knew every one of you by name. You know, Brother Brandham said, "There are some people that you like to be around. You just like to sit down and have coffee with." &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way I feel about you people. My son Adam and I, a lot of times we talk and we we raised the question, "What if God would move us out of Durham? Where would we go?" You're at the very top of the list. I can tell you you and one more place are running a real close race, but we certainly will. [Music] We wouldn't want to do that unless the Lord said so. But I'm tell you what, we we love you and the family is so disappointed tonight that they couldn't come and and be here with us. But I promised them that I would make a special trip just to bring them back to be in service with you. They enjoyed it so much. I I love the way you worship. Uh you know, you you do know you have a reputation, right? &gt;&gt; It goes before you. It's kind of like the guys that were standing outside talking earlier debating about whether or not they wanted to come in the church tonight or not. And and one of them was debating. He says, "I I don't want to go in there." He said, "I, you know, I just uh those people, they get excited and whatever. I just you telling the other guy, you just go on in and I'll stay out here." And they were back and forth and whatever. I said, "You know, I was down at a church a couple of weeks ago and they were quiet. They they preach love everybody and don't offend anybody. They even had a coffee bar and donuts." He said, "Boy, that was really nice." He said, "That's the kind of church I like to go to, but those people in there, they just get all excited and you just don't know what's going to happen." He said, "One minute they're raising their hands and shouting and praising the Lord. They may dance. They may even get up and run and whatever." Did you happen to see what happened to to to Joe last week that went? Well, you might know him as disbelief. Said he came out of that church looking like a practice dummy for the Crimson Tide blocking tackle. Amen. Said they just beat him up like you wouldn't ever said those people even will take the boss's name and write it on the bottom of their foot and run all OVER THE CHURCH SAYING, "DEVIL, YOU BELONG under the bottom of my feet." See, that's the kind of repetition you have people have created. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Well, you know where I was going with that, don't you? But that's I don't see them in here tonight. I don't imagine they're hanging around too much. Not with what's been going on. Amen. I I really feel embarrassed to try to sing with all these singers and musicians. Let's try F if we could. F chord of the mountain. You know this song, I'm sure. So help me sing it if you would. Life is easy when you're up on a mountain. And you've got peace of mind like you've never known. [Music] But things will change. And you're down in the valley. [Music] Church, don't lose hope. For you're never alone. For the God of the mountain, [Music] he's still born in the valley. [Music] When things go wrong, oh, he'll make them right. And the God of the good times, he's still gone in the bad time. The God of the day, he's still God in the night. I believe that. Don't you? You talk of faith wind. Oh, we're up on a mountain town. Listen, but talk comes easy when life saves. [Music] Now you're down in the valley of trials and temptation. [Music] Oh, that's where your faith is really put to the test. Oh, the call of the mountain. Oh, he's gone in the valley. Oh, when things go wrong, I know it. Oh, he'll make them right. And the God of the good time. He's still gone in the bad time. the God of the day. He's still gone in the night. Let's sing it from our heart. Oh God, [Music] he's still God in the valley. Oh, when things go wrong, oh, he'll make them right. And the God of the good time. He's still God in the bad time. The God of the day. He's still God in the night. [Music] The God of the day. [Music] He's still my God in the night. Glory to God. Amen. Do you believe that? Praise the name of the Lord. I believe that, you know, the Philistines and the God haters always thought if they could get the children of God into the valley, they could overcome. They said, you know, he we know he fights for him on the mountain, but if we can get him in the valley, we got a chance. Well, when Goliath got in the valley, he found out that didn't work too well, did he? &gt;&gt; Amen. He found out that the God on the mountain was the one that was in the valley of Eli. Amen. It doesn't matter what we're going through. And I and maybe I'm the only ones. Anybody ever been through a battle? &gt;&gt; Sure you have. But you've always come out because you trusted God. &gt;&gt; Believe him today. I appreciate him so much today. Amen. We won't keep you standing. If you have your Bibles, I I don't preach like anybody else. &gt;&gt; And uh you'll find that out very quickly. And uh I I beat myself up over that a lot of times, brother Greley, because I I kind of feel like I want to be better than I ever am. I I employ a whole lot of life into what I say and the whole lot of my experiences in what I say and a whole lot of things I have experienced. And let me tell you something. At my age, I have experienced it. I've experienced it all. I've seen the good, the bad, the ugly. Amen. I've been beat up by the devil. I've been told that I was going to die. I've been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death and I'm still standing &gt;&gt; because God knew that I was going to love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know that you feel the same way today. But we just appreciate him so much. And and I won't be lengthy. I promise I won't be long. I'm not a long- winded preacher. Amen. But it's not the length of it, but it's what God has to say in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter one. Amen. We'll just read maybe one verse there and then we'll go over to Amen. a little further over and get another verse of scripture here. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 1. I want to read verse number four. You probably can quote it by heart. According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy. Everybody say holy. that we should be holy and without blame. Without blame before him in love. Can you say amen? And if you'll turn over just a few verses or chapter over to uh second Timothy. Amen. Chapter one. We'll read a couple of verses for you there and then let you have your seat. Verse number nine. Who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our work. Amen. but according to his own purpose and by grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death and have brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. Amen. May God have his blessings on the word today as you're seated. Amen. And again, we just appreciate the Lord and uh uh letting us be here today. I had a beautiful lunch with Brother Shelley and the boys today. I felt like royalty. Amen. I'm not used to all that that elite treatment and stuff. Amen. But it was just a such a privilege and and not just Brother Shelley and whatever. And you know, with ministry like you have here, Brother Shelley and Brother Greley. Amen. There's nothing that I have new to say. And let me warn you of that firsthand. If you come looking for something new, you're out of luck. I don't have anything new to tell you. Amen. We read the same Bible. We We hear the same message. We hear the same preaching over and over and over again. So, I don't have anything new to tell you today. Amen. But if I can stir your mind, if I can encourage you to know that whatever you're going through, whatever you face, whatever you you think you might face, God has the answer today. Amen. because he chose you before the foundation of the world. I'm not here by chance, church. You're not here by by by just happen stance. You're here because God ordained that you be here. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm a I grew up in the days of Roy Rogers and the Long Ranger and Gene Altry and and and all those days and some of the young people looking at me saying, "Who in the world is that?" So, I'm I'm a real old western type guy. I like the Old West and I like the westerns and I like reading about the Old West. And I was reading an article not long ago and I came across a a a statement and it was uh concerning uh 19 1845 a man by the name of John Sullivan coined a phrase called manifest destiny. And I thought that's interesting. I'll begin to read a little bit about it. And what that what that term referred to with with Mr. Sullivan was that the early settlers that lived in the east coast had a right to to go west and to occupy the land and to create worlds and citiz and and country uh uh towns and all of that. And it was obvious. Amen. And it was their destiny that WAS WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. AND I THOUGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF LIKE THE BRIDE, you know, we have a destiny also. Amen. We didn't just we're NOT JUST UH PLAYING this thing by ear. It was all laid OUT BEFORE BEFORE IT EVER HAPPENED. AMEN. And you know, Brother Brandham said, "YOU'RE NOT SOMETHING BECAUSE you want to be something." Amen. You're not somebody BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE SOMEBODY. You're somebody in who you are because God ordained you to be that person. Amen. You are what you are because, Amen. God's will made you to be that way. All of us want the will of God. We know that today. I mean, there's none of us sitting here today that would wake up one morning and say, "I don't want to be in the will of God." It's always, "I want to be in the will of God." And we know those gifts and those callings OF GOD ARE WITHOUT REPENTANCE. THEY'RE THERE. AMEN. And they're PART OF US BECAUSE OF THE FORNOWLEDGE OF GOD. NOW, I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A a school lesson. We all know what fornowledge means. It means to be to know something. Amen. Before it ever happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be aware of it. The Greek word for that word is prognosis if I pronounce it right. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT it means reality before it becomes real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you apply that with a with religious theology, AMEN. It's it refers to all knowing omniscient. &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature of our God. AMEN. REALITY BEFORE IT BECAME REAL, EVENTS BEFORE THEY HAPPENED, and people before they were. Amen. See, we didn't just get here today. We've been here all the time. Amen. We We were in God before his forn knowledge. Let me read you what Psalm that the psalmist David said. Psalms 139:15. HE SAID, "MY SUBSTANCE WAS NOT HID from thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing hid from God. Amen. WHEN I WAS MADE IN secret and curiosity wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, thine eyes DID SEE ME. AMEN. AND THINE THAN EYES THAT SEE my substance. YET BEING UN UNPERFECT, listen church, and being unperfect IN AND IN THY BOOK all my manners and all were all of those were written which is continuous WHICH WERE FASHIONED WHO as yet were none of them. Amen. We're none of them. BEFORE WE EVER GOT HERE, WE WERE PART OF GOD. BEFORE WE EVER GOT HERE, GOD KNEW WHO WE WERE. BEFORE WE EVER GOT HERE, WE WERE MANIFESTED IN GOD. HOW MANY SAY AMEN? EXODUS 6 and:e 7 said, "I WILL TAKE YOU to me for a people." &gt;&gt; Amen. That included you and I. Somebody say amen. ROMANS 8 8:29. FOR THERE IS FOR THEREFORE FOR THERE HE THERE HE FOR THOSE HE FORNEEW HE ALSO PREDESTINATED AMEN to be CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE. AMEN. of his son which was the word. WHAT'S MY DUTY? WHAT'S MY PURPOSE? What's my my job if you want to put it in those terms to be here today is to be conformed. Amen. Not to a creed or to a doctrine but be conformed to this word. Not just this written WORD ON THE BOOK. AMEN. But that written that that living word. AMEN. THAT JOHN SPOKE ABOUT THE WORD THAT WAS MADE FLESH and dwelt among us. TO BE THAT WORD. THAT'S WHAT OUR PURPOSE FOR EVEN being here is today. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were not put here for but one purpose. That is to please God, to worship God. Amen. You were not put here, young people. AMEN. TO BE A STAR ATHLETE. YOU WERE NOT PUT HERE TO BE a rock star. Amen. You were put here to ordain and ordained TO BE A SON AND A DAUGHTER AND A PURPOSEFUL GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Nothing wrong with having dreams. NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING AMBITIONS. AMEN. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT GOD COMES FIRST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHAT GOD HAS FOR MY LIFE IS ALL THAT MATTERS TODAY. AND IF THESE other things come about well in being &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; See, I told YOU AT THE BEGINNING, I'VE BEEN THROUGH I'VE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE KNOWS how to take care of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And young people today, I know they have a battle. And I can identify. You know, a lot of us older people, we're not tempted and we're not we're not enticed by some of the things that the young people are enticed about. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT BOTHERED by those things. But the spirit of this hour and the and the spirit OF THE ENEMY, IF IF HE CAN GET A HOLD OF A a a young mind or a young talent, Amen. I said, YOU WEREN'T PUT you weren't put HERE TO BE A A ROCK STAR. YOU DON'T THINK FOR ONE MOMENT THE devil wouldn't be wouldn't love to get a HOLD OF AMEN. AND THAT TALENT BROTHER BEN HAS ARE OR THE TALENT OF THESE MUSICIANS. AMEN. AND OFFER THEM THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU COULD BE YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SINGING LIKE THAT. YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY PLAYING THAT MUSIC. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT you were ordained for. That was not your purpose. Amen. When I was growing up, it's hard to look at me and believe now. Amen. But I used to could sing. Amen. But I grew up in Brother Gley in the days of rock and roll. I knew Elvis. I met Elvis. I KNEW A LOT OF ROCK AND ROLL SINGERS IN THAT. AND I was I I wared WITH THAT. THAT BATTLED ME. AMEN. I'D GO to church in in in uh all OF MY SINCERITY, LOVING GOD, SINGING AND AND WHATEVER. AND GO TO HIGH SCHOOL AND THERE WAS THAT ROCK AND ROLL SPIRIT. AMEN. Pulling at me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Back then I had the voice. I I I thought I had the looks. Amen. May not may not be able to tell that now, but that spirit WARED AGAINST ME. AMEN. BUT THAT WAS NOT MY DESTINY. AMEN. THAT WAS NOT WHAT GOD PREDETERMINED ME TO BE. THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE PREDETERMINED YOU TO BE. AMEN. He predetermined YOU TO BE A SON OF GOD TO MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO PUT FORTH WHAT WHAT HE ORDAINED YOU TO BE. &gt;&gt; Fore is a connection between God and his and his fornown people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of his loving kindness. That's what the scripture says. Amen. When love projects, &gt;&gt; grace takes over. When love projects, Amen. And he we love him because HE FIRST LOVED US. AMEN. BUT THAT FORNOWLEDGE IS THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN GOD AND YOU BECAUSE HE KNEW YOU. &gt;&gt; It's hard for people to understand how that we can say amen. That we were there before we were ever anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we were. How many say amen? Predestination looks BACK TO FORNOWLEDGE. BUT FORNOWLEDGE LOOKS FORWARD TO DESTINY. AMEN. TO WHAT'S MY destiny today? Amen. TO BE A SON, TO BE A DAUGHTER OF GOD, TO MANIFEST HIM, TO MANIFEST HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; By fornowledge God, to say, "Esau, I have hated." Amen. Jacob I have loved. Amen. That that's a that's a strange scripture and a hard scripture for a lot of people, amen, to understand. But if you got a if you have a revelation, amen, of the knowledge of fornowledge of God, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. AMEN. And you can understand HOW ONE WOULD SELL OUT AND ONE WOULD NO MATTER WHAT IT TOOK. AMEN. He would he was he would do anything he could TO GET THAT BIRTHRIGHT. AMEN. I WANT TO tell you tonight, YOU NEED THAT KIND OF DETERMINATION. YOU NEED THAT KIND OF DESIRE. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES. AMEN. I'M GOING TO MEET GOD'S REQUIREMENTS. I'M GOING TO do whatever it takes TO BE THAT SON AND TO BE THAT DAUGHTER of God. Amen. No matter WHAT IT THE PRICE IS NOT TOO HARD TO PAY. THE PRICE IS NOT TOO HIGH, CHURCH. AMEN. WHAT WOULD A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL? &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THE WEALTH AND THE riches of this world could never amount to anything if you lose your soul with God. Amen. By fornowledge, God, Amen, would know and he would he would be able to to look at you AND AND THE PROPHET SAID, AMEN. THAT YOU are a bride. &gt;&gt; Not because you chose to BE A BRIDE, NOT BECAUSE you wanted to BE A BRIDE, BUT YOU'RE BRIDE BECAUSE GOD ORDAINED YOU TO BE THE BRIDE. AMEN. And you could have never been anything else. Amen. BECAUSE BEFORE THE FORNOWLEDGE OF GOD, GOD BROKE THAT LITTLE PIECE OF HIM OFF. AMEN. AND WHEN HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE." HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ME. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN GOD SAID WHEN GOD BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE, AMEN, INTO THAT MAN CALLED ADAM, HE ALREADY MADE HIM A A A a a spiritual man. But when he breathed that breath of life in it, he became a living soul. Amen. You and I began to live. &gt;&gt; Now, you might say, "Well, look at what happened to us." Yeah, we were we were we were lost. We were condemned. We were we were put on a downward track, amen, by the condemn. We were condemned by somebody else representation. But that's why not what God condemns us for. He doesn't condemn us or or send us, Amen. cause us to be lost because we were condemned or we were represented by someone else that transgressed God. Amen. because we're also represented by somebody else. AMEN. THAT BROUGHT US BACK TO GOD. THROUGH THAT FIRST MAN, ADAM, AMEN, this world WENT INTO SIN. BUT THROUGH THAT SECOND MAN, ADAM, WE GOT BACK TO WHERE WE BEL LISTEN CHURCH. I don't know about you, but I'm not on I'm not on my way back to Eden. I'm not on my way back TO HERE. I'M ON MY WAY BACK TO GOD. Let me let ME TELL YOU THIS. IT'S NOT HOW GOOD YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; It's not how bad you were. It's where did you come from? IF YOU CAME FROM GOD, you're going BACK TO GOD. IF YOU WERE NOT WITH GOD IN THE FORNOWLEDGE, YOU'LL NEVER BE BACK THERE WITH HIM in the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's where we came from. IT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TODAY. &gt;&gt; How many say amen? You didn't make yourself bride. &gt;&gt; You can't make yourself bright. You can't make yourself a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Shelley mentioned it today at at lunch. There are some people that Amen. JUST LABOR SO HARD TRYING TO LIVE GOD. TRYING TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; Why are you trying to do it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO. IT'S NOT WITHIN MY ABILITY TO LIVE FOR GOD. WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR IN THE MORNING, EVERYTHING I SEE, BROTHER GLEY, AMEN, IS CONTRARY to God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FLESH IS CONTRARY TO GOD. THERE'S NOTHING IN ME. AMEN. THAT MAKES me want to worship God &gt;&gt; except the God that's in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. See what we're doing. We're trying to do it oursself. And you'll never be able to do it. You'll never be a success in living for God. Amen. You've got to have him on the inside. Amen. You got to be changed from that old creature. Amen. To a new new creature. I heard you give a little story one time years and years ago about a pig. Amen. That was up on somebody's porch and they were getting him ready for getting him ready for a fair, I BELIEVE, AND they polished his his uh his uh toenails and got him all CLEANED UP AND LOOKING. HE LOOKED at brother Sheldon and he looked at that mud hole. He looked at brother Sheldon and he looked at that mud hole and all of a sudden he JUMPED OFF THAT PORCH AND BACK TO THAT MUD HOLE HE WENT. WHY? BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS BORN FOR. &gt;&gt; And if you were not BORN FOR THIS, YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You're never going to make IT IN OURSELVES. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT in ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're only secure. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only secure as long as you stay in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I see people today and I WONDER THEY'RE FIGHTING SO HARD TO get away out of the message. They're looking for quote to justify Amen. getting away from the truth. They're trying as much as THEY CAN TO NOT believe it. IF THEY TRY THAT HARD TO BELIEVE IT, BOY, THEY'D BE ON THE top of the mountain all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happens to them. BUT YOU LISTEN, THERE'S A TIME TO STAY IN THE BOAT AND THERE'S A TIME TO GET OUT OF THE BOAT. AMEN. YOU STAY IN THE BOAT UNTIL JESUS tells you to get out of it. Amen. The ch the the disciples WERE ROWING ONE TIME. AMEN. THE THE storm was raging and they forgot THAT JESUS WAS IN THE BOAT. THAT WAS A GOOD TIME TO STAY THERE. &gt;&gt; But then there was another time when he came walking ON THE WATER. PETER LOOKED OUT AND SAW HIM SAID, "LORD, IF THAT'S YOU, LET ME GO. TIME TO GET OUT OF THE BOAT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I can only imagine Andrew and John and the other disciples and Peter's getting ready to grab his coat up around him and getting ready to step over in the boat and they're grabbing him by his coat said, "Are you a crazy? Are you a fool?" Amen. YOU'RE GOING TO DROWN IF YOU DO THAT. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE people told you, "You're a fool for believing THIS MESSAGE. YOU'RE A FOOL FOR ACTING LIKE YOU DO. YOU'RE A fool for going to a church like that." Amen. Let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. BEING A FOOL HAS CARRIED ME A WHOLE LOT FURTHER IN GOD, AMEN, than I would have ever been if I had not been a fool for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Peter came back into the boat and they drugg him over, pulled him over in the B boat, Andrew probably looked at him and said, "Peter said, YOU'RE A FOOL. YOU COULD HAVE DROWNED OUT THERE." &gt;&gt; Peter probably looked at Andrew and said, "Andrew, you ever walked on water?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Say, see, being a fool sometime will take you a lot further, Amen. than you would any other time. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that the word that word fool is doesn't always have a negative meaning to it. You know, you could be just a fool for Christ. That Amen. There's nothing like being a fool for Christ, is it? &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're only secure as long AS WE STAY IN THE BOAT. AMEN. NOT OUTSIDE RIDING ON THE BOW. AMEN. Looking at the waves AND WHATEVER, BUT STAYING IN THE SECURITY of this word. Stay in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the building. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT STAY IN THE CHURCH. STAY IN THE BRIDE. STAY IN THE WORD BECAUSE THERE'S OUR ETERNAL SECURITY. THERE'S WHERE OUR LIFE IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; People try to live so close to the world to justify. Amen. WE OUGHT TO BE TRYING TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WORLD AS WE CAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I seen a a a a statement a man uh posted on on the on the social media the other day. He said, "I wonder how many teaspoons of the devil's sugar, Amen, can we take, Amen, and still claim to be a a believer? &gt;&gt; How many teaspoons of the devil's sugar can we keep taking, Amen, and still PROFESS TO BE A BELIEVER? &gt;&gt; We don't want to mar our testimony, church." &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a time, amen, a season for all things. There's a time to be manifested. Amen. And you're living in that time, a final voice for a final hour. Amen. A people that's been called AND CHOSEN, AMEN, BY GOD. NOT NOT when you nailed in the altar 10, 15 years ago or or or 10 or 15 days ago, BUT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world, God chose you. Amen. And when he chose you, he made you what YOU ARE. YOU COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A LUTHERAN. You could have never been a Methodist. You could never HAVE BEEN A PENTECOSTAL. SO, WELL, I CAME THROUGH THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CAME through it, but you didn't LIVE THERE. THAT WAS NOT WHAT YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE. YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE A BRIDE. WHY WERE YOU DESTINED TO BE A BRIDE? FOR THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, GOD SAW IN YOU WHAT IT WOULD take to believe this message. &gt;&gt; What the the the character, Amen. The trait, the the faith, AS BROTHER SHELLEY SAID EARLIER, THE FAITH to believe this word. You can't believe it without faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you were chosen people. You were YOU WERE AN ORDAINED PEOPLE. AMEN. BEFORE GOD EVEN BEFORE YOU EVER GOT HERE. &gt;&gt; That's what you were. Amen. There's a time for it. Amen. Not in Luther's day or Wesley, as I said, OR ANY OF THOSE OTHER DAYS. YOU were chosen to be the bride of Christ for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the church, but the bride of Christ. Amen. You know, when a bride becomes a bride, she becomes a bride on her wedding day. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been a fiance, it's time to be the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been a fiance long enough. time to be the bride. Amen. You know, and and you probably I I heard a story about this couple that was getting married and and the and the girl, she was kind of getting a little wet. Uh her feet was getting a little wet and she's getting A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND she was having doubts about her her her husband to be. And she went to him and she said, "I I I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WANT to marry me. You know my life. You know the MISTAKES I'VE MADE. I HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD ALL MY LIFE. I'VE I'VE MADE SOME BAD MISTAKES. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY YOU WANT TO MARRY ME. And he looks at her, brother Gillian, and says, "Because I love you." Amen. And when we go to him and we say, "Lord, h how could you possibly want to marry me? How could you possibly choose me? You've seen my wrongs. You've seen my mistakes. YOU'VE SEEN THE ERRORS. YOU'VE SEEN THE SIN IN MY LIFE. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY CHOOSE ME TO BE A BRIDE?" AND HE LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE I love you. And when that love projected, GRACE TOOK OVER. And no longer WERE YOU A SINNER. NO LONGER WERE YOU AN OUTCAST. AMEN. What you were brought into that fold. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were brought into that fold. &gt;&gt; Amen. That time to be manifested. Amen. This man created coined this flow. Amen. A manifest destiny. Amen. And we were we were destined to be the sons of God. Amen. We I went through a lot of things in my life and I'm sure everybody here can testify of the same thing. Ups and downs, uh career changes, this and that and the other. Amen. But God destinated or predestinated you to be, Amen. a son of God, a daughter of God. He predestinated you, if I can go this far, to to seek here under this word of God that you hear week after week after week. Amen. That builds you AND STRENGTHENS YOU. IT'S NOT JUST uh to come to worship the Lord and and feel the spirit of God. That's good. I love it. Don't ever get away from it. Don't ever do away with it. But hear that word BECAUSE THAT WORD IS going to strengthen you. That word is what you came from. AMEN. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE you back. Amen. You got to have that connection to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way it's got to be, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He breathed that breath into your life. Can I get a little on the natural for a little while? &gt;&gt; Amen. Back in the early 1700s, there was a man by the name of of Owen Thornton. He was my great great greatgrandfather. He had a son by the name of Thomas. I was there, &gt;&gt; but I was not Thomas. Amen. In the late 1700s, Thomas had a son. Thomas Thornton had a son. And they called him Matthew. I was there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I was not Matthew. &gt;&gt; Amen. Early 1800s, Matthew had a son and they called him Mandy. I was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I was not Mandy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1921 something. Mandy had a son and they called him John. Amen. I was there &gt;&gt; but it wasn't me. &gt;&gt; But January the the 9th. Amen. 1943. Amen. Christine and John welcomed a little baby boy. AMEN. NAMED JOHN JR. THAT WAS ME. THAT WAS MY TIME TO BE MANIFESTED. AMEN. ALL THE WAY THROUGH THOSE ANCESTORS. AMEN. THROUGH JOHN SENIOR AND MANDY AND MATTHEW. AMEN. AND THOMAS AND OWEN. I WAS ALWAYS THERE. BUT MY TIME TO BE MANIFESTED, AMEN. CAME ON JANUARY THE 9TH, 1943. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you may not like me. &gt;&gt; You may like me. You may disagree with me. But you can't change me. I'm a Thornton. I WAS BORN TO THORNTON. AIN'T nothing you can do ABOUT IT. AMEN. YOU were born what you are. YOU WERE BORN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THERE AIN'T NOTHING THE DEVIL can do ABOUT IT. SOMEBODY SHOUT, "AMEN." THERE AIN'T NOTHING HE can do about it. HE CAN TROUBLE YOU. HE CAN TRY YOU. HE CAN PERSECUTE YOU. AMEN. HE CAN RUN YOU DOWN. HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO, BUT HE CANNOT CHANGE WHO you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like Shelly better than now Thornton, but I can't be a Shelly. &gt;&gt; I like that name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I can't be that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that seed, Amen. that came down through all those generations &gt;&gt; was a Thornton. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My mother was a Jenkins. My grandmother was a tailor. I was never a Jenkins. &gt;&gt; I was never a tailor. They only carried me. Brother Greg, they they only carried the seed. I was never Amen. a Pentecostal. Amen. Free will a trinitarian. It only carried me. Amen. But there came a time for the birth to come forth. It came a time when I heard that word. Amen. And said, "Now is the time to be manifested. Now is the time to come forth." Come on. &gt;&gt; I was like I was like that little duck. Amen. That they found his egg and they put it under the chicken and the chicken hatched that duck AND HE WAS THE funniest looking thing. His beak was ALL FLAT AND WHATEVER. HE HAD WEB feet and he was the funniest looking thing. He just didn't fit. &gt;&gt; You ever felt like he didn't fit? &gt;&gt; Good. Amen. Because you don't you don't belong to this world. You don't belong to this world. YOU DON'T BELONG TO THE IDEAS AND OPINIONS OF THIS WORLD. But one DAY THAT MOTHER KEN MADE A MISTAKE. SHE DRESSED him up. She put a little chicken comb on his head. She put little chicken feet on his on his on on his web feet and they went out for a walk. Amen. And they made the mistake of walking down by the river by the pond. Amen. See, the devil made a mistake when to let you hear this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he could have kept you away from it, if he could keep fellowship away from God. Amen. All right. But see, you he can't do that because you were born for this. Amen. This was your day. Amen. This was your hour. THIS WAS YOUR DESTINY. AMEN. And that old mother KEN MADE A MISTAKE OF WALKING that little chicks in that duck down by the river. And all of a sudden, he got a sniff of that water. He started sniffing. Something smells different. Something different about THIS MESSAGE. SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS WORD THAN WHAT I'VE been hearing. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN." AND DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENT SOUND? AMEN. THE TRUMPET when it sounds, IF IT'S SOUNDING THE WRONG THING, it'll never it'll never represent the king. BUT WHEN IT STARTS SOUNDING THE RIGHT SOUND, that little duck got a whiff of that water and the closer he got to the water, the better better it smelled. All of a sudden, THE CHICKEN HEAD CAME OFF. AMEN. The web feeth were manifested. He took OFF THE CHICKEN FEET AND HE HEADED FOR THE water and he ran just as hard as he could run. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you heard this message, amen, joy came in your heart. I know it did as it did mine and you just I can't wait to get to it. I can't hear it enough. I can't wait to get to church. Brother Shelley, don't you want to start having service maybe four or five nights a week? Amen. We just need to hear it. We want to HEAR IT. WE DESIRE TO HEAR IT. THAT'S THE WORD. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S something on the inside of us, pulling, amen, working toward the outside. THERE'S SOMETHING PULLING US, AMEN, BACK TO THIS WORD. IT'S PULLING US. IT'S STRAINING. I feel the pull. Amen. It's pulling me back to it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I've got a longing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'VE GOT A DESIRE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'VE GOT A I'VE GOT A NEED TO HEAR WHAT THUS SAITH THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I didn't choose to be a Thornton. &gt;&gt; It was not in my choosing. &gt;&gt; Amen. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE FIRST Thornton came along. The word Thornton is Anglo-Saxon. And you forgive me for this. I hope it it emphasizes something. But the name Thornton uh is Anglo-Saxon. It comes from England. And the word t o n ton meant a heel like a a rise. And and thorn of course you know what that mean. So if the person's name happened to be Tom, they would refer to him as Tom from the hill of thorns over there. Amen. That's how it came about. So he it became John Thorn Hill. Jump John from the uh Thornhill. Amen. Now they call me Jesus. &gt;&gt; They call me little miss Jesus. Amen. I had a name change. Somebody said, "What's in a name?" I tell you a whole lot. Amen. There's a whole lot in a name. Amen. Because I was part of it. Amen. I was I was there. Amen. All the way back. And And I don't I don't know when the first Thornton Amen. set their name on something. You can go back. I went back a lot in history and and ancestor and chased a lot of things and traced a lot of things. Amen. A lot of famous thorntons and whatever. But the name, Amen, that seed that came down through every generation made me what I am today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some I'm I gain weight, I lose weight. &gt;&gt; Had a head full of hair, I lose my hair. Amen. We get We're young and we get old. All those change, but there's one thing that has never changed. I've been a Thornton all my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. From the very moment, Amen. that that doctor held me up. Amen. Like that. And popped me. And that first &gt;&gt; breath came out. Amen. I've been a Thornton. And ever since God, Amen. Slap me real hard spiritually speaking. Amen. And put the breath of life in you and me. Amen. We have become sons and daughters of God. And there ain't nothing nobody can do about it. &gt;&gt; And I can boast of that. And you can boast of that. Amen. You can you can put your fingers in your lapels and you can poke YOUR CHEST OUT AND YOU CAN SAY, "DEVIL, I AM WHO I am. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, NOT BY MYSELF, NOT BY MY STRENGTH, NOT BY MY ABILITY, NOT BY my doing, but by the grace of God. I am his son &gt;&gt; because I was destined to be that way." &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't choose to be a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was I thought I was doing pretty good. I was in a in a Pentecostal trinitarian church and Amen. I was singing and we were shouting, knocking over the chairs every night and people get speaking in tongues and running and go home and say, "Well, the preacher didn't even get to preach because the Holy Ghost took over." Oh, such error. God forgive me for ever being part of that. Amen. But that's the way we were. Amen. But it was just another stage. See, it was just another stage. I I I didn't I didn't get to where I am right now overnight. It's taken me It's taken me 83 years to get to where I am right now. And I've been through a whole lot of different stages, sister, all through those 83 years. Amen. And I didn't get where I am in the word. You didn't get where you are in the word. Amen. Overnight. It took a maturity. It took a growing. Amen. It took It took the knowledge of the word of God. It took preaching from your pastor. Amen. And other ministers of God to get you where you are today. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was only refining it. It was only refining it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I was never born to be anything except a bl a bride believer. Well, brother Johnny, don't you think you can fall? I could fall tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's not what I'm looking for. That's my not my destiny. Have I made mistakes, Lord, more than I want to admit? Amen. And have I come short of the glory of God more than I can than I can ever imagine. Amen. But you know, I'm I'm a I'm a builder. I build things at home. You know, I build decks and and work on houses and stuff like that. And so I build a lot of things. But I've never created but one thing. And his name is Adam. &gt;&gt; He's my son. Amen. And he's my son because that same seed that came through all those generations, Amen. was manifested through him. Amen. And there he is. That's the only thing I've created. Brother Bram said, "The reason people you like to be around people of of like precious faith is because you're a mini creator. You create an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You create an atmosphere." You know, we've we've heard him say that within the bride of Christ lies the ability to create worlds and go there and have them. EVERYBODY'S WANTING TO GET OUT OF out of out of Fort Smith and Dur want to go live in another uh another place. Let's just create this atmosphere of worship. If we can create an atmosphere of worship around us, we have accomplished, Amen. what the prophet meant for us to accomplish. I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can create that atmosphere of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know that there's any thorn cheer. But I'm sorry, you can't be one. &gt;&gt; You can't be one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you didn't have my father. &gt;&gt; You didn't have my father. But I can't be a Shelly cuz I didn't have his father. Amen. You say, "Well, brother John, that means there's a whole different one." Amen. But see, we all come from the same family. We all come into the same family. Amen. We were all part of God. We'll all be part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it I I just I just He chose me. I didn't cho choose him. I wasn't looking for him. He came looking for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that you were? You were lost. You You know when when when when God God came in the cool of the day, Amen. looking for Adam and Eve. Amen. And he said, "Adam, where are you?" &gt;&gt; Do you think for one moment God didn't know where Adam was? &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you something. God knew exactly where you were. &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God in the evening time, in the cool of the day, he's come and he's called. Amen. Not just Jodo. He's called your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's And you answer to your name. &gt;&gt; And when he calls that bride, Amen. Who's Who's going to answer? Only the bride. Only the bride that knows her name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You I could Brother Ben sitting back. I could say, "Hey, you come up here." He wouldn't know who I'm talking about. I could be talking about any of these brothers. But I say, "Brother Ben, come up here." Amen. He'd know who I was talking about. Amen. Because I called his name. identified. We have been identified. Amen. Not by our opinions. Amen. But I have been identified by that seed word. And that seed is a continuation of life &gt;&gt; for years. I told brother Shelley today, Carol and I were married for about 10 years before Adam was born. We were beginning to think we weren't going to have any children. I would be the last 40. There'd be no more of us. Amen. And then the Lord blessed us. Well, I've got a grandson now, and if the Lord terries long enough, if if he comes before he's old enough to marry and and have a family, he'll be the last one. Amen. And here you sit. You are the final voice. &gt;&gt; You are the final bride. There won't be any other church age after you. &gt;&gt; Amen. There won't be any other message. There won't be any other messenger. Amen. You are the final thing. Amen. You are the You are the consummation. You are the absolute of God's work from the beginning of the world. Amen. You are the consmation. Listen. Amen. Luther's message was good. Amen. Justification is wonderful. Wesley's message was wonderful. Amen. But let me tell you something. It wasn't complete. Amen. Wesley wasn't complete. The Pentecostal movement wasn't complete. But in you is the complete the the the complete plan, the complete work of God in this hour. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen, if if you're if you're struggling today, and I know we struggle, if something's holding you back, Amen. All you have to do is just turn loose and let God have his way. &gt;&gt; Just turn loose and let the Lord have his way. If there's something holding you down, Amen. And I can't imagine with the ministry that you have here, I can't imagine any of you having any problems. You ought to be on the mountaintops. I heard a story one time how the a king somebody gave him a couple of baby eagles and he created this aviary for him and he hired the best trainer and he got the best food and amen all this and the the eagles grew and he go out and one of the eagles would be soaring all over the sky just circling around and the other eagle was sitting on the perch and they changed his food. They got a different teacher to teach him all this stuff about hunting and whatever. They go out the next morning. He was sitting on the perch. &gt;&gt; And the king said, "I'll give hundreds of of dollars of gold to any man that can teach this eagle to fly." So he went out the next morning and both eagles were flying around. And the king said, "Wonderful, wonderful. who do who done all of this? And an old farmer with ragged bib overalls, long beard, hair all matted, and they want stepped forward and said, "How could you have possibly done all of this? What did you do to get this eagle to fly?" He said, "I cut off the limb that he was sitting on." &gt;&gt; See, cut off what's holding you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. If something's holding you back, if you haven't got THE VICTORY TODAY, CUT IT OFF. &gt;&gt; GET rid of it. Amen. It's not worth it, church. It's not worth missing OUT WITH GOD. IT'S NOT WORTH HAVING NOT HAVING THE BLESSINGS OF GOD. CUT IT OFF &gt;&gt; AND START FLYING. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN TO FLY, CHURCH. YOU WEREN'T BORN FOR THE MUD HOLE IN THE MUD PIT. YOU WERE BORN TO FLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's a fact for just It's just a fact. Amen. You didn't choose to be this way. You didn't choose to be anything. BUT GOD ORDAINED YOU. AMEN. WHY DID HE do that? Why did God pick you? Why did he pick me? Amen. He saw all the mistakes I'd make. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there had been one person lost, he would have still died for that one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw all the mistakes and all the shortcomings. But he looked back into that book. Amen. and he saw that first opportunity to hear the word of the Lord. Amen. I wished I could have got a hold of one of the little young people here before service, but I preached this message once in at home and I called my grandson up and I said, "John Luke, if I offered you a dollar or a nickel, which one would you take?" He said, "I'd take the dollar." So I wrote his name on that dollar bill and put it in my pocket. So during the service I said, "John Luke, come up here." And he came up. I said, "If I offered you a dollar or a nickel, which one would you take?" He said, "The dollar." And I pulled the dollar out and I said, "Whose name is written on that dollar bill?" He said, "Mine, John Luke Thornton." Amen. See, I knew he was going to take that dollar. Why? because I gave him the opportunity before he ever got there. God knew. God knew what you were going to do before you got here. So, he wrote your name on THAT DOLLAR BILL BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN I BE SURE OF IT TODAY, CHURCH? LOOK IN THE WORD OF GOD. FIND YOURSELF in this book. AMEN. THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. AMEN. GOD DID THIS FOR ME. I'M IN THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The pages of this book were written about me. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's all how we respond to it. It's how we react to the word of God. Amen. You know, when the angel Gabriel came to Mary, Amen. The first thing he done was let her know who she was. Blessed art thou among women. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said you're going to have a child. How can that possibly be? Nothing wrong with asking God why. Amen. To ask why is to have understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can this be? He said, the Holy Ghost that will overshadow you and that that is conceived in you will be of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what Mo what Mary's response was? &gt;&gt; I don't know about that. It ain't never happened before. No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, that wasn't her response. &gt;&gt; This was something that had never happened before. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here today as a bride that has never happened before. What's your response to that word? Amen. She said, "Let it be according to thy word." Amen. Let it be according to what? Sometime, you know, the word sounds hard. How how can these things be? Jesus told the disciples one time he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me well the disciples having followed him said Lord this is a this is a a hard saying who can do it Jesus response was you also go away I love the response to Peter who can we go you alone have the words of eternal life &gt;&gt; where am I going where am I going to go without this message where am I going to go without the word of God I have no hope I have no security I have no I have no chance of making outside of the bride of being a bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're we we fall, we fail, we come short a lot of times. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But my faults don't define who I am. My fail MY FAILURES DON'T DEFINE WHO I AM. I'm not defined by that. I'm defined by the word of God. I'm defined by what God said about me. Amen. I'll have faults and failures as long as I live until Lord raptures the church or takes me home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm not defined by that. &gt;&gt; Now, people may try to define you. They may put you in a pigeon hole. A lot of times they'll do that. &gt;&gt; But God does not define you by your faults or your failures. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're defined by your reaction to the word of God. You're defined by by what how you respond to the word of God. And your response is determined because of who you were. &gt;&gt; Where you came from. Amen. And where you're going when you leave here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I think about Abraham a lot of times. Amen. Abraham gives us a whole lot of good lessons. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was down there in the valley of Chaes. I don't remember reading in the scripture where Abraham was looking for a way to get out. I don't see any scripture that says he was saying, "Boy, I wish I could leave this place." I don't find anything which he was saying, you know, there's got to be something better than this. I don't find any scripture where he was he was uh uh tired of doing what he was doing. He was happy. &gt;&gt; He was doing what he was doing. He was making idols and sudden making a good living. Everything was going fine. But God had other plans. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime God will come and he'll interrupt your plans. You know, when I was growing up, I had a lot of I had a lot of plans. I Boy, I'd have laid them out. I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. Guess what? God just came and messed up everything. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's all I can say. God just came. He messed up all my plans. Amen. &gt;&gt; But, Brother Angel, I look back and I say, "Thank God. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the mess. Thank God for messing me up." But there was Abraham down there and and and all of a sudden God decided he would elect Abraham, Amen, as the father of faith. And he went down and Abraham get up and leave his family. And you know the story. I don't have to go through all of it. Amen. But Abraham became a very wealthy man. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as as he was getting older, Amen. he decided that it was time for his son to have a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's time for God's son to have a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham called his servant Eleazar. Amen. And he gave him a journal with everything that he a list of everything that he owned. All of his cattle, his gold, his silver, his his his sheep, his oxen, everything that he had. He said, "I want you to go, Amen. back to my kindred." &gt;&gt; Amen. And get a bride for my son. God will only marry himself. &gt;&gt; He will only marry his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Eleazar went back and and and bear with me just a moment. Eleazar went back, Amen. to that land. Amen. And he and he laid out this fleece before the Lord. I love the fact that he camped outside of the city and he camped by the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need to be you don't God doesn't want his people mingled in with with the world. He had them on the outside the city. Amen. By the well because listen, he knew that that's where the virgins that's where the young women would always come to draw water. Isn't it amazing that the bride always wants to go to the well? She always wants to go where the water is. Amen. Because that water of life is the only thing that will will cleanse us. Amen. Will sustain us. Amen. and make us what we need to be. &gt;&gt; And he camped out there and all of a sudden here come all these young ladies and and Eleazar had laid out this vision. Let the woman that says so and so, let her be the one. Amen. She came out and the conversation went on and she said exactly &gt;&gt; what the word was. &gt;&gt; That's it. She said the right thing. She had the right response. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and she said, "Come on, go to the house. We'll fix supper for you." Amen. Feed your cattle and and and all this stuff. So they went to the father's house. Amen. And and and and Leven, I believe it was, decided he wanted to know all the story. And and Eleazar said, "Before anything, I got to tell you why I'm here. I'm here to get a bride. I'm here to get a bride for my master's son." Amen. And he went through all of it &gt;&gt; and he said, "Is she going to go?" And these are the words that I that I love. Then the father said, "It's not for me to say. &gt;&gt; It's her decision." &gt;&gt; See, it it's not what the world says. It's not what your family thinks about you. The decision with her and they said, "Will you go with this man?" &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember that night God said, "Will you will you go with me?" And she said, "I'll go." Amen. I'll go. and they packed up the camels and everything and she went and the story ends up with her seeing uh Isaac walking through the field. She fell in love with him immediately. He fell in love with her. She lighted off the camel, run across the field and he grabbed up and kissed her. Isn't that a beautiful love story? Amen. It's not any more beautiful than your love story right here tonight. Because God sent a servant. God sent a word. Amen. To get a bride for his son. Look around at your neighbor today. Amen. and see God manifested in flesh. See that bride sitting beside of you. Know for a fact, amen, that you're all part of that bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God elected Abraham. Amen. He elected you and I. &gt;&gt; No man cometh to the father. The scripture said except cometh to me except the father draw him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said this. He said ponder on this. He said when when divine love is projected, Amen. It comes to its destiny and grace takes over. &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes to its destiny. WHAT IT WAS DESTINED FOR. WHAT WAS that love of God for? He loved us. Amen. So that we could love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IN OUR CONTROL. IT'S NOT IN OUR ABILITY. AMEN. It's in God's control. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S IT'S UP TO GOD. IT'S WHAT GOD HAS SAID IN HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. How can it possibly be? How can how can we how can we profess to be the bride of Christ? Look at us in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Open up and find your picture on every page of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know sometime when we begin to think of everything in the first person &gt;&gt; and I said it's not in my ability. It's not in my my control. It's not what I can do. It's not what you can do. when we when we be when we began to say I can do this. I can do that. I have done this. I didn't bring me to where I am today. You didn't bring yourself to where you are today. But when we begin to deal with oursel in the and our our relationship and our experience, when we begin to deal with it in the first person, we leave God out of the picture completely. And you know that the only thing that can hinder and stop the work of God is your free will. The only thing that can stop God from working is your free will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. I remember our precious brother Perry, we mentioned it day at lunch. Amen. Told me one time, brother Johnny, always keep your balance in the scripture. Amen. And you know what else he said? He said, "The fact that we're here, I remember one of the services. The fact that we're here, the fact that you're here tonight, not in new hope, but in your in this place in our walk with God is concrete evidence that we're going to make it the rest of the way. &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us this far to leave us." &gt;&gt; Amen. But but when we put ourselves as I can do this and I've done that and I can do this and we leave Christ completely out of the picture and it won't work that way, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you probably have seen it, but there was a man put up an illustration on on social media, Alistister Big. And he said, "What about the man on the cross, the thief on the cross?" He said, "I can't wait to get to heaven to ask this guy, how did that work out for you? One minute you're cursing God, one minute you're condemned to death. Amen. And the next minute you're standing HERE IN HEAVEN, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?" And the thief says, "I don't know. What do you mean you don't know?" And the angel came to him and said said, "What are you doing here?" He said, 'I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I How did you get here? I don't know. Well, let me go get the supervisor angel. And he comes over and he says, "A question for you. What is your stand on justification?" I don't know anything about it. Well, what about the scripture? He said, "I don't know anything about it." "Well, how did you get here?" He said, "The only thing I know is that the man on the middle cross said I could come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all because of him, church. &gt;&gt; It's It's not me. He said the right thing. Amen. The man on the middle cross said that I could come. Amen. And let me tell you something. JESUS HAS SAID you can come. Amen. Jesus has said, "You are part of me. &gt;&gt; You're part OF ME. YOU'RE PART OF MY FAMILY." &gt;&gt; I love it. Don't you, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. If the devil can if the devil can get us into a singular mind, singular point of mind that where it's all about us, then we're going to lose we're going to lose ground with God. Amen. There's nothing that will interrupt the program of God. Amen. We're bound to arrive. There's nothing going to stop it. The devil can come and he can he can he can disrupt our fellowship, but he can never disrupt the plan of God. Amen. That election looks back. Amen. It looks back in when I was a sinner. When I was a cuckerberg. Amen. Now I'm a wheat. When I was a sinner, now I'm a believer. Amen. Not just a believer, but a bride believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah the prophet prophesied 750 years before that word came to Mary. Amen. 750 years that word circled the globe waiting. Amen. For the right vessel. Wait, waiting for the right vessel for seven ages of the church. Amen. For all the seven dispensation of time all the way from eternity past. That that word, amen, has been circling the earth. Amen. Waiting for that very moment to drop into hearts of a people that would say, "Let it be so according to your word." Amen. All that time that word has been circling. But let me tell you something. It has found a lodging place. Amen. has found a lodging place. &gt;&gt; Amen. In you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He said the right thing. &gt;&gt; She said the right thing. &gt;&gt; You said the right thing. Amen. Seven ages. Luther justification. Wesley. Amen. But God has carved out a bride in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's chipped away everything. One of my one of my favorite characters in history is Michelangelo. And everybody knows him for the statue of Moses. Amen. And I'm I'm I'm sure that the the the the Pope did not know that when he commissioned Michelangelo to sculpture the mo the statue of Moses that it was going to become a masterpiece of of messages for the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the story is told that one day, Amen. Michelangelo Angelo was out in his yard and he was walking around and around and around this great big old chunk of marble and you're looking at he'd walk around and he look at it and he walk around and a friend of us come up and SAID, "MICKEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" He said, "What do you see there?" He said, "Are you kidding? I see a big old chunk of marble." And Michelangelo look looked at him and said, "No." He said, "There's an angel in there and he's trying to get out and it's my job to get him out." And he started tripping away at all the marble. Amen. And all this to make that angel, amen, God's been working on us, amen, for seven, seven dispensations, seven ages of this church. But let me tell you, there's a masterpiece. Amen. There is a bride today that we can step back and look at and say, "THAT IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED to be. That is what God ordained that I be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Final voice in a final hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew that I'd love him. Amen. Sometime you know myself personally go through this. We're up and down and up and have problems and whatever and I'll say Lord you know I love you. Things will get bad and sometime I'll say brother G. said, "Lord, have you forgot I'm down here? &gt;&gt; Do you not see what's going on?" &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the that's the flesh. That's John talking. Do you not see what I'm going through? Why are you letting me go through? I can imagine the disciples felt that way when they were pulling on that boat and Jesus is taking a nap. Doesn't he care whether we drown or not? In fact, they went down. Lord, don't you care where we drowned? How many times have you said that? Lord, do you not see what I'm going through down here? Why are you letting me suffer all this? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brown said, "It'll it'll make you perfect. It'll make you strong. God will test you. God will try you." Amen. To make you stronger and stronger and stronger. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, church, this is no, this is no willy-w. This is no do the easiest you can and get by with whatever you can. Amen. This is total line. &gt;&gt; Before I ever knew him, before I ever loved him, he loved me. Amen. And he made a propitiation, an atonement for each and every one of us in here. Why? So that I could become from that cocker that I could become a wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. There ain't nothing good about a cocker. There wasn't that any good about me. Amen. I I started serving the Lord as brother Shelley did at a very young age. But let me tell you something. I was lost as the worst sinner on on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it was it was it was it was how I got here. But it was not my destiny. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not my It was not what I was ordained to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, people tell me I shouldn't shouldn't talk about my ancestry in a bad way. &gt;&gt; But, you know, not everybody in my in my ancestry were the best people. &gt;&gt; Some of them were some of them were, you know, whatever. My grandfather, bless his heart, Amen. I never seen him in church. Never knew him to do anything. But he loved the bottle. I'm I I hate to say it about him, but he he was he was an alcoholic. That was his life. Granny wouldn't need him let him live in the house. She put him a little house at the back. She wouldn't even let him live in the house. Amen. But every Saturday night or every Sunday morning, they'd come to my grandmother's house and knock on the door and they'd say, "Nancy, you need to come and get Mandy. He's in the creek again." cuz every Saturday night he'd get drunk and he'd fall in the creek and he fell in the creek so much that they named it after him. &gt;&gt; See, that's not the kind of legacy I want. That's See, &gt;&gt; but thank God a chain was broken somewhere. The link The link was broken somewhere. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All this has happened, but I'm still standing &gt;&gt; and you're still standing. Why the musicians come? You know, the scripture says in in 2 Corinthians, one of my favorite scriptures, it says that God made him that was that knew no sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He laid upon him all the sins. &gt;&gt; I don't know of Can you tell me one sin that Jesus ever committed? No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the scripture said in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 I believe it is that God laid upon him every one of the sins of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the reason he did that was so that when God looked at Jesus, he saw me. &gt;&gt; And when he looked at me, he saw Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I became him. And he he became like he became a sinner like me so that I could become God like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's our hope today. Amen. That's the only reason that we can boast today is that he became us so that we could become him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't want to ever displease him. &gt;&gt; No sir. I look back on my life and I know that at times I disappointed my dad. Amen. But I was always his son. Nothing changed that. No matter what I done, how I acted, where I went, I was always his son. So I said a a moment ago, you're not defined by your faults and your failures and your shortcomings or whatever. Because if you were born of God, if you came from God, Amen. You're always going to be God's son &gt;&gt; and there's nothing the devil can do about it. That's not an excuse to live like the world or go out and take care of. It is not a It is not a a an excuse to sin. &gt;&gt; It's a reason, Amen. to live close to God. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Because I look back now and I I wish that I could say and I can only say in my mind, "Dad, I'm sorry I disappointed you there." And I can look back and say, "God, I'm sorry that I did this or I broke your promise or I came short, whatever." And when that and when the prophet said, "And when that love projected over projected, Amen." then destiny took over. It came to destiny and grace took over. For it's by grace that we're saved today. It's by grace, amen, that we are who we are. It's by grace that Amen. your destiny has been manifest in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's by grace and by mercy that your your destiny, who you are, the bride of Christ. And not because you chose to be that way, but because God ordained you to be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw what you were, what you could be, and what you would be. Amen. He says, "I'll pick that one. I choose that one." Amen. and they'll love me and they'll come to me because God said so in his word. That's the way it would be. Amen. God bless you. Stand with me if you would. I hope that we've said something that will encourage you. &gt;&gt; Good word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Strengthen you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good word. &gt;&gt; Give you give you something to to use against the devil when he comes. I am who I am and there's nothing you can do about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might not like me. You may tell just tell him. You may not like me. You like might may not like me going to New Hope and you may not like me doing this or you may not like me singing or whatever. Amen. But you can't do anything about it &gt;&gt; because it's part it is it is who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Could we pray? Father, thank you for your presence in your word today. Lord, I trust that you take this word and bind it up with cords of love and and let it be applied to our heart to encourage each and every one of us, Lord, that we might recognize who we are, &gt;&gt; Lord. And in recognizing who we are, cherish that that position and hold on to it, Lord, and and and be the best that we won't do anything to mar that position or the or the image of it or the privilege of it, but that we'll be those people that you're calling for in this final hour in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I bless you. &gt;&gt; He became sin who knew no sin that we might become his righteousness. He humbled himself and he carried the cross. cross. Love so amazing.

If you won't let him be Lord of all, he's not Lord at all. &gt;&gt; We want to let him be Lord over every part of who we are. &gt;&gt; Mind, will, and emotions, &gt;&gt; all of us. I've been blessed tonight. &gt;&gt; I I do. I I've been blessed. Brother started by saying, "You won't hear anything new." Well, we didn't hear anything new, but we hear it in a different way &gt;&gt; than what we might have heard it by somebody else. But I watch this message, what he was preaching tonight. I watched that very closely because there is a whole lot of hypercalvinism that has invaded this message. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham wasn't a hypercalvinist, but we hear a lot of hypercalvinism &gt;&gt; as though we had no choice. as though he just lined us up against the wall and said, "You are, you are not. You are, you are not." It wasn't quite like that. That's primitive Baptist doctrine. And if one man got up and shot his cousin, they said he was predestinated to do it. That's hypercalvinism. But he I said, "Lord, I know he's come into a balance." And and the whole thing you lay it all out because everything he said was true, wasn't it? I believe it. But I loved it when he gave the little illustration with his grandson. &gt;&gt; You see you, God chose first. &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; He said, "You've not chosen me. I've chosen you." &gt;&gt; He chose first. And how could he do that? By fornowledge &gt;&gt; because he knew that when I had an opportunity, &gt;&gt; I would choose him. &gt;&gt; That's predestination according to scripture. That's election according to scripture. And that's what you heard tonight. And it's true because he chose first. What he what he does is good and it's right and it's eternal. &gt;&gt; He'll get us one way or the other. He'll have his reward. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? That don't upset me. &gt;&gt; That relaxes me. &gt;&gt; I want you to come and sing one more. We'll we'll go cuz we're not used to being out this early and it won't hurt us. But I I want to I want to sing the old hymn. Um I I'll get it out here in a minute. Spafford's uh wrote the hymn. It is well. I kept trying to say all is well. Same difference. But here's the man who lost a lot &gt;&gt; and uh later built the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem. And one of the last sitdown meals that I ever had with brother Green was in the American Colony Hotel. And I told him a story that he knew about Spafford, but he didn't know that this was a a place that he built, a colony for Christians to live that's become a hotel. And they're passing over the spot where his family was lost at sea. And the captain out of respect comes to him and says, "Sir, I I thought you would want to know that we're passing over the very place where your family was lost in the storm." And he went over to the table and began to write these words. When peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, it is well &gt;&gt; with my soul. My favorite verse, my sin, &gt;&gt; not not in part, &gt;&gt; but the whole. Let's sing that tonight before we leave. It's our anthem [Music] when peace like a river attendeth my way. In sorrows I see those ro [Music] whatever [Applause] [Music] my law thou has taught me to sing. &gt;&gt; After hearing a message like that, you ought to be able to sing this. It is &gt;&gt; and know it's the truth with my soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it is well it is well with my soul. With my soul and it is well. It is well with my soul. Praise the Lord. Though Satan [Music] should not fail, he does &gt;&gt; and those trials will come. &gt;&gt; Let this blessed assurance. The sh country Christ have regarded my helpless. Oh that [Music] regard in my head [Music] and have shed his own blood for my soul [Music] and It is well. It is well with my soul. with my soul. It is well. Oh, it is well with my soul. I send all the bless. I see all the bliss. Smile while you sing. &gt;&gt; Glorious [Music] Lord. My s not in heart [Music] the whole glory is to the cross and I love your Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, oh my soul. And it is well. &gt;&gt; It is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh my sin. Oh, the bliss of this glorious [Music] Lord. I see. Oh, that might see not [Applause] [Music] every [Music] cross [Music] praise the high. Praise the Lord. Oh my soul, [Music] &gt;&gt; it is. It is well with my soul. with my soul. It is well, &gt;&gt; it is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; Now sing the last verse. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And Lord, haste the day. &gt;&gt; Haste the day. With my faith with my faith, faith shall be sil. Oh no, we roll back as [Applause] the shout. [Music] Yes, even so. Oh, it is well with my soul. Last time sing it. It is well. &gt;&gt; It is well. &gt;&gt; Nobody can testify of that for you but you. With my soul. &gt;&gt; With my soul. Yeah. It is well. It is well with my soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord because of that revelation we don't have to wallow &gt;&gt; in condemnation and guilt. Because of that revelation, we know that every sin, all unbelief, nailed to the cross, &gt;&gt; not in part, but all of it. all that's behind me, all that I may be walking through now, and any that I would walk through in the future, if unbelief should ever manifest itself in any form in my life, all I have to do is bring myself back under the authority of the blood, the word, and the grace of Almighty God, and my fellowship can be restored. Lord, I thank you that the fall in the garden did not change Adam's relationship with you. It changed his fellowship. He was always a son. And there's been many times in our life that our fellowship with you was affected by our own decisions and our stubborn will. But Lord, because of what we heard tonight, we were sons. &gt;&gt; We were sons. That's grace that I after all these years, I still can't quite get my head around it. And I thank you designed it that way so that we would have to depend on you. Lord, thank you for the word we heard tonight. And we don't always feel that, but it's not by feelings we march forward. It's by faith. And I thank you tonight for a servant, Lord, who would deliver his heart to us in language that we could understand and follow. I thank you for the sacrifice he made to be here. And I pray, Lord, that you would restore back to him any strength and virtue that was lost. And you'd place a new and fresh inspiration upon him. And Lord, I pray that even in the latter years of his life, that there would be increase of your anointing and that there would be increase of your many blessings and benefits. Thank you for giving him a sound body, a strong body, Lord, that he's been able to go and go and go. And Father, I pray that he will see fruit from his labor. I thank you for your precious oil that uh soothes every wound and every every openness in us. And you seal us for that purpose, that destiny that you chose for us before the foundation of the world. Lord, a message like we heard tonight just really makes us want to be alone with you. May we find that time. May we make that time that you would be a priority in our life. Hearing the word, reading the word, sitting at your feet, and worshiping you, being those little creators that he talked about tonight, changing the atmosphere around us by the creative nature of what you've done in us. We kept seeing that theme, Lord. uh saying the right thing. May we may we say the right thing. May May our confession line up with what we know. &gt;&gt; May we declare it. May we decree it. May we prophesy it. May every member of our body line up. &gt;&gt; Lord, in the physical, let every system of our body obey the design of the creator. Heal right now, Lord. release your healing. The price was paid already. It's ours. We access it by faith. It's children's bread. We take it tonight. Healing not only in body and in physical, but Lord, even in the places of our soul that have been wounded along the way. Heal us, restore us, make us new. If there was anybody whose steps were slowing, may this word tonight ring in their ears. &gt;&gt; May it be like a cheer coming across eternity. And may they run, Lord. May I run. May I run faster than I've ever run before with greater determination because of this great reminder that we've heard. It's you. It's you, Lord. It's you. Anything that we do, anything we accomplish, it's you, Lord. To God be the glory. Go with us tonight. Let this great spirit of the Lord settle over us even in our time of fellowship and and uh and nourishment and meet us tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Let our faith try to begin to anticipate the fullness of your glory that will meet us in the morning. We claim it. [Music] Thank you for letting us see our name. [Music] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for reminding us that not a devil in hell. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for the revelation that there is a book that our name cannot be blotted out of. &gt;&gt; Your servant taught us there is a book of life and a lamb's book of life. One of those books, our name can be removed. In one of those books, it cannot be. Lord, I thank you for letting us see our name in the Lamb's Book of Life this evening, knowing that whatever it requires, you're going to have your reward in us. It can come easy or hard. It depends on the depth of our surrender. Lord, tonight we surrender. Would you surrender with me, Lord? We surrender tonight. To the best of our ability, to the best of our knowing, we surrender. Any part, put your finger on it, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Show us any part of us. &gt;&gt; Any thought in our mind, any emotion that controls us that is not yet submitted to what your word says about us. Give us the grace to to pay the price to surrender. Your prophet said you've gone as far with God as you're ever going to go until you're willing to pay a greater price. The price that it for our salvation is paid. But the price to be an overcomer is something that we surrender and yield to as we sojourn here below. Lord Jesus, I want to give you more than I've ever given you before. I don't think you'll terry long enough for me to reach the age that brother Thornton told us he was tonight. But I'm inspired. I'm inspired by by a man like that. Who who at nearly 83 years of age is still reaching reaching for more of who you are. Stir up a hunger in us to the oldest. Stir up a desire for us to go all the way. Lord, in any place that we've taken the shortcut, may we go back and choose like your prophet did, the harder way because we know it's the way of reward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, may we fall in love with you all over again. That's what this kind of preaching ought to do in us. And we'll give you glory and honor and praise. In the mighty matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. I don't want to move, but I I think we might have to in a minute. Let's sing Falling in Love for just a minute before we go. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Falling in love. &gt;&gt; Falling in love with Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Sing it again before we go. Falling in love. Falling in love with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Falling in love. Falling in love with Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Falling in love. &gt;&gt; Falling in love with my Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Oh, cuz in his arms I feel protected. And in his arms I'm never disconnected. In his arms. That's where I feel protected. And there's no place I'd rather be. Sing that part again. Oh, in his arms. &gt;&gt; In his arms. I feel protected. When I'm in his arms. In his arms. I'm never disconnected. In his arms. In his arms. I feel protected. And there's no place I'd ra be. &gt;&gt; Falling in love. last week. Oh, I'm falling in love, falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love, falling in love with Jesus. [Music] Falling in love. &gt;&gt; Falling in love with my Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Amen. You're dismissed to go tonight in the lovely name of the Lord. Meet us at the bottom of Oh, sorry. Brother Ellias, would you take a bag there? I've only been reminded four times and and I forgot again. You won't be able to say we were about your money, will you? Give something tonight. We want to bless Brother Thornton for being here. I don't want him leaving here with any needs. I want us to meet them. I don't want him to go in the red. I want it want us to bless him for blessing us. You're dismissed to go tonight. Your the fellowship is free. There's food. You'll enjoy the food and the fellowship. And tomorrow after the service, we'll eat together again. I'm blessed. Anybody blessed? &gt;&gt; God bless you as you leave. It's the best thing I've ever done. Falling in love. Love you with Jesus. Falling in love. Falling in love. Wow. Yes. Falling in love with Jesus is the best thing I've ever done. [Music] Yes, sir.
