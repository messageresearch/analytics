[0:00] so he became our high priest which is a
[0:04] legal position in the courtroom of God
[0:13] he is our intercessor he's standing in
[0:17] the Gap making petition on our behalf
[0:21] every ordinance of the law that was
[0:24] against us has been blotted out
[0:27] every transgression of the instruction
[0:30] of God has been nailed to the cross and
[0:35] he has triumphed over it all and you
[0:38] were in him when he triumphed over it
[0:41] all he has made a public mockery
[0:45] a public display
[0:48] a show of the enemy
[0:51] has so ultimately stripped him of his
[0:54] power that the only way the enemy can
[0:57] operate with power in your life is if
[1:01] it to him
[1:02] so he became our high priest which is a
[1:06] legal position in the courtroom of God
[1:10] you see the legal terms of scripture are
[1:14] so numerous that we come to understand
[1:18] that God's transaction with you and I is
[1:21] a legal transaction
[1:23] and he has been so careful down through
[1:27] the Plan of Salvation from the Garden of
[1:30] Eden all the way up to the end of the
[1:33] laodicean church age and for all Time
[1:36] and Eternity he has gone to such care to
[1:41] such Precision he has been so meticulous
[1:44] to make sure that every requirement of
[1:48] the law every demand that the law would
[1:51] have on you he has stepped forward and
[1:54] fulfilled every bit of that not doing
[1:57] away with any of it
[1:59] just so ultimately filling it up there
[2:02] was no more room for your sweat
[2:05] the great grace of God
[2:10] God's perfect offering
[2:13] he came as such a perfect sacrifice that
[2:17] every requirement was met
[2:20] not abolished
[2:23] not abolished
[2:25] it was filled up
[2:27] it was all filled up we're saying that
[2:31] what Jesus did fulfilled the requirement
[2:34] of the law in such a powerful way that
[2:38] it superseded the older Testament and it
[2:41] has carried us all the way through what
[2:43] we call the New Testament or the newer
[2:45] Covenant and it has carried us all the
[2:48] way into eternity by the mind of God
[2:51] which means we're cleared did you know
[2:55] there was no room for that high priest
[2:57] to allow an inferiority complex to keep
[3:01] him from carrying out his one yearly
[3:03] Duty
[3:04] he couldn't say well well I you know I
[3:07] don't feel worthy or I'm not so sure or
[3:10] I don't know if I'm really called or not
[3:12] it was his responsibility and he had to
[3:16] do it whether he felt like doing it or
[3:18] not
[3:19] you have a responsibility
[3:22] there's no room for inferiority
[3:24] complexes and insecurities in the
[3:26] kingdom of God when the invitation comes
[3:29] let us come boldly unto the throne of
[3:32] grace you've got to get all your stuff
[3:35] out of the way amen every life that
[3:38] Satan tells you
[3:40] to try to keep you from going in every
[3:43] inferiority every insecurity every past
[3:46] transgression
[3:48] well I wasn't raised in a loving home
[3:50] that can't keep you out
[3:53] it's only if you choose to allow
[3:56] something to keep you out the invitation
[3:59] is yours come come come come
[4:03] and we must do it because it's actually
[4:06] as it was the priest's responsibility to
[4:09] minister before God it's your
[4:11] responsibility as a priest because we
[4:14] Are Spiritual priests amen we're also
[4:17] spiritual Kings
[4:18] and it's our responsibility according to
[4:21] the Book of Revelation it's our
[4:22] responsibility to minister before the
[4:24] Lord in that way so praise is not an
[4:27] option
[4:28] and worship is not an option it's a
[4:31] responsibility
