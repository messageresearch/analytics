[0:00] you trusted the norm you trusted status
[0:03] quo you trusted the way you had always
[0:06] done it
[0:13] i don't know if you all know the name
[0:15] r.c wetzel or not he had survived polio
[0:19] he had been through a lot and there was
[0:21] a great fire that destroyed his his
[0:23] family's home
[0:25] and and the barn and it so affected him
[0:28] as a grown man it still affected him
[0:31] those childhood memories i remember
[0:33] hearing him limp to the pulpit
[0:35] uh still crippled from polio he would
[0:38] limp to the pulpit he would preach and
[0:40] teach and tell us some wonderful things
[0:42] that god had done in his life and i love
[0:45] to hear him talk about that that fire he
[0:48] said the house gone the barn gone
[0:51] just smoldering
[0:53] embers
[0:54] left
[0:56] and
[0:58] he said we went out
[1:00] and the livestock gone the pet's gone
[1:04] the quilt's gone everything gone
[1:08] and he said sitting right in the door of
[1:10] a barn of the barn was a mother hen
[1:14] charred to death
[1:15] her feathers melted on her little frame
[1:18] but still in place
[1:20] he said i didn't mean any harm
[1:22] but i could not imagine what made that
[1:26] little mother stop
[1:28] at the door of that barn she was three
[1:30] inches from life three inches from
[1:32] safety
[1:34] what in the world made her stop right in
[1:37] the doorway of the barn and he said i
[1:39] didn't mean no harm but i just took the
[1:40] edge of my boot and i kicked her over
[1:43] just tapped her over and out from under
[1:45] her run a whole brood of little chickens
[1:48] [Music]
[1:49] he said i never had to question again i
[1:52] knew immediately why that mother could
[1:55] have made it to safety but she wasn't
[1:57] sure that her children couldn't make it
[2:00] to safety
[2:01] and then i would hear brother wetzel say
[2:03] oh jerusalem jerusalem
[2:07] and my mind would go back to jesus
[2:09] jerusalem jerusalem how often i would
[2:12] have gathered you as a hen would heron
[2:14] and you would not
[2:15] and jesus is standing in the midst of
[2:17] his own people and he's saying to them
[2:19] you you see this temple look around at
[2:22] all this everything you see now it won't
[2:24] always look like this there will be a
[2:26] time when one stone will not even be
[2:28] laying on top of another stone i'm
[2:30] telling you that's a lot of destruction
[2:33] and here's why it has to happen
[2:36] it has to happen because
[2:38] you trusted a building
[2:40] [Music]
[2:42] you trusted the norm you trusted status
[2:45] quo you trusted the way you had always
[2:48] done it and when your answer came and
[2:51] walked among you you didn't see him
[2:54] you missed the day
[2:57] of thy visitation
[2:59] this is why jesus was weeping over
[3:01] jerusalem in luke chapter 13
[3:03] because he knew the time would come
[3:06] that the temple would be gone that
[3:08] everything the people loved would be
[3:09] taken from them and in the moment listen
[3:12] prior to that is when he wanted to draw
[3:14] them
[3:15] you'd better be one of those if he
[3:18] should come and say get under my wings
[3:22] come on now
[3:23] get under my wings
[3:25] you better run with everything you have
[3:32] you
