[0:00] sympathetic resonance
[0:02] if you heard of that sympathetic
[0:04] resonance the thing with a tuning fork
[0:06] if you have it where it's in a base
[0:09] to where you're not you're not touching
[0:11] it but if you have one fork here and
[0:13] another Fork here you get them close
[0:15] enough together and if they're tuned the
[0:17] same you strike one fork
[0:20] and the closer it gets to this Fork over
[0:22] here that's tuned to the same it will
[0:25] start resonating the same tone
[0:28] and it never was touched
[0:31] there was never a physical contact
[0:34] but just because it's tuned the same it
[0:37] will start saying the same thing
[0:41] you get what I'm trying to say
[0:43] if we are tuned
[0:46] the same and we have his life a
[0:50] representation in US
[0:52] and that word is sounding Out
[0:55] and the closer we get to that note
[0:58] that's being sounded out guess what
[1:00] it's going to resonate
[1:02] through you and you're going to realize
[1:05] nothing that you did
[1:08] but because if there's a representation
[1:10] that you're attuned to the same note
[1:14] that because you're tuned the same and
[1:17] this voice is ringing out here and the
[1:18] closer you get to it all of a sudden
[1:20] that same voice starts resonating out
[1:24] through you and guess what it's saying
[1:27] the very same thing and that Holy Spirit
[1:30] is sounding over here I want to get as
[1:33] close to where the holy spirit is
[1:34] sounding out because I know I can get
[1:36] close to you guess what
[1:38] I'm gonna be saying the same thing I
[1:42] don't want to say anything different I
[1:44] want to say the same thing I want the
[1:46] same holy spirit that resonated through
[1:48] brother Branham I want the same Holy
[1:50] Spirit to resonate through me I wanted
[1:52] to say the very same thing that he said
[1:54] because if it does I know I'm in line
[1:57] with his word the closer that I can get
[2:00] to this word
[2:02] and this word is being spoken and it's
[2:05] sending out a message and it's sending
[2:07] out the right tone the closer that my
[2:10] life can get to that
[2:12] is going to be demonstrating the same
[2:16] thing that same note is going to
[2:19] resonate
[2:20] through my voice through my life
[2:24] through the things that I say the places
[2:26] I go it's going to say the same thing it
[2:29] has to say the same thing
[2:31] because I'm built the same
[2:34] you have to be in perfect tune Perfect
[2:38] Harmony
[2:40] in perfect tune to the absolute
[2:44] in his absolute is his word
[2:48] amen
