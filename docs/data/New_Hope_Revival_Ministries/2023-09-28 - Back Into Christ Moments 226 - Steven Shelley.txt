TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign that is being prepared now is not the body of the Lord Jesus Christ the body that is being prepared now is Mrs Jesus Christ and where did she come from well where did Eve come from Eve came out of Adam where did the broad come from she came out of Christ and we are living in an hour where the bride that came out of Christ is making her way back into Christ as the bride was separated from Christ at Calvary when that spear went in blood and water flowed out and brother Branham said that was Christ that was his bride being pulled out of his side she was being separated from him and how did it come it came from a narrow place Justice fear just enough room for the tip of the spear to go in and we that Revelation drop how does the bride get back into Christ she's got to be back into him she's the body that he wants to dwell in in the last days how does she get back into him through a narrow place and that's why we're pressed on every side that's why all life isn't Grand that's why there's heartaches and hardships and pain along the way because to get back into crisis is not a wide way it's not a broad way it's a narrow way this word is a narrow way it's a straight gate isn't that what the scripture tells us what a privilege what a privilege to be invited to go back into Christ business [Music]
