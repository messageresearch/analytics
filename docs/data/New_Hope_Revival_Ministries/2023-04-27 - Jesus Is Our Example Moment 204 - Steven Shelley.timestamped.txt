[0:00] Jesus is our example
[0:03] he gave up every ride he ever had
[0:12] but Jesus came
[0:15] to find the ungodly to find the Fallen
[0:18] of Adam's race
[0:19] and to redeem them from the from the sin
[0:23] of the fall all the way back to the
[0:26] original thought that God had about you
[0:29] in the beginning when God thought about
[0:32] you in the beginning you were perfect
[0:34] you were holy you were righteous you
[0:37] were in His image
[0:40] you've been fighting your whole life to
[0:42] get back to what God thought about you
[0:44] in the beginning
[0:47] keep on running this race we'll soon be
[0:51] done with troubles and trials
[0:54] we'll soon be done with Temptations and
[0:57] tasks we'll soon be done with all of the
[1:01] heartache and troubles and trials of
[1:03] life
[1:05] we're one day going to sit down with
[1:09] she glad hands with the elders and tell
[1:12] my Kindred good morning
[1:14] scroll down Glory Boulevard with Isaiah
[1:19] Jeremiah and the prophets of old
[1:21] spend our lifetime at the feet of King
[1:24] Jesus serving him and worshiping
[1:27] come on down and when I leave this world
[1:30] of Sorrow you need to know this I'm
[1:33] leaving here just like him
[1:37] my destiny according to God's
[1:40] foreknowledge of me he pre-assigned
[1:44] prefixed me a destiny
[1:47] and that Destiny is revealed in
[1:49] Scripture
[1:50] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:52] that he
[1:54] might be the firstborn
[1:57] among many brethren
[1:59] you see Jesus passed the test
[2:02] Jesus is our example
[2:05] he gave up every ride he ever had
[2:09] he left the Splendor of Heaven
[2:13] the deity that was within him the
[2:16] kingdom The Authority the throne he left
[2:21] it all to condescene
[2:24] and he entered into this world and he
[2:26] laid down his rights to speak up for
[2:28] himself
[2:29] to defend himself LED like a sheep to
[2:33] the slaughter uh yeah the uttered not
[2:36] his word the accuser stood there and
[2:39] lied against him and he never said one
[2:42] time that is not the truth
[2:44] when they finally pinned him down all he
[2:48] could say was I am he
[2:52] couldn't deny who he was
[2:55] and he gave up his right to life
[2:58] to live
[3:00] he gave up his right to be married
[3:04] [Music]
[3:06] to have children
[3:08] somebody said well that wouldn't be much
[3:10] of a privilege if you're God you forget
[3:12] who he was I know some people out there
[3:15] are under this false impression that he
[3:17] was 50 God and 50 percent man
[3:20] but that's not what the word my word the
[3:22] Bible I read doesn't teach me that he
[3:24] was half God and half man
[3:26] somebody said what in the world was a
[3:28] hundred percent God
[3:30] 100
[3:31] [Music]
[3:32] God it's not 50 50. he's a hundred
[3:36] hundred
[3:37] he was a hundred percent God when he
[3:40] cried out come out of that grave Lazarus
[3:43] he was a hundred percent man when he
[3:46] slept in the bow of the boat
[3:48] he was a hundred percent God when he
[3:50] stepped up and spoke to peace be still
[3:52] it just kept turning over and over he
[3:55] was always God always man so he gave up
[3:57] the Bible said in fact then he was
[3:59] tempted and every manner like we are
[4:01] [Music]
[4:02] he was tempted by lust
[4:07] yet without sin
[4:09] he was our example in all things
