free indeed there's never been men more free within their spirit than the apostles amen there was never anyone more free than John the Revelator who was imprisoned on the aisle of patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus but in his heart you don't get Visions like that unless you're a free man in Jesus name so I thank the Lord for His blessings this day I'm thankful for each and

curses are you with me if you'll just go brother one of you Benjamin would you just go in my backpack open the front zipper and put bring the little little quotebook here I just want to wave it around

have a wonderful camp meeting oh my [Applause] my my my it was outstanding in every way you people outdid yourselves with your cooking and with your your love and care for those who had come to be with us it was a wonderful thing to be able to put out the or find the need of putting out chairs and uh we're just believing that uh the Lord will continue to add to those numbers as we look forward to What the Lord Has for us and uh thank you for your uh participation in the memorial service last Monday night I know you were exhausted after a week of camp meeting but you came and you turned out in beautiful ways to honor the life of our sister royel I accompanied the family on Wednesday of this week to uh this the national cemetery in Fort Mitchell where we were able to lay our sister to rest in a grave that she will not need very long we're sure of that they can reuse hers butth we're just thankful for how God has been are you grateful for these musicians thank you all what a blessing thank you we don't even entertain the criticism anymore you know in the 90s they criticized us for having drums now a lot of them have drums so just don't get on the what's popular just let the Lord lead you in your worship I want a church I made my dear old grandma a promise I want a church where people are free to Worship the Lord according to the dictates of their heart if that is offensive to you you're going to be very offended because we intend to let people have freedom to worship God We Believe in the order but not man's order we believe in the Holy Spirit order somebody might wave a flag somebody might dance somebody might run somebody might wear a prayer Shaw somebody might wave an Israeli FL I don't know I don't know what God's going to show you to do or lead you to do or direct you to do but I want you to be free in this house it's paid for after all now you might as well enjoy it someone asked the qu couple of people actually asked a question this week does that include the debt of the church does that include everything it does all 60 Acres all the all the buildings mobile homes and different things that belong to the church uh office building all of it it's all free and clear thanks be to God it's been a long journey he's faithful you believe that I I want us to read this morning I would tell you to turn but I'm going to be reading it from the Amplified Bible and I don't know how many of you have an amplified Bible with you this morning but you can certainly read along in King James I love the King James it's my preference it's where I go first in all situations but I like the Amplified Bible pretty good uh again we faced a lot of criticism the first time we dared use it and now I hear Brothers using it all over I hear a lot of ministers using it and uh so don't don't uh get hung up on anything like that if you don't want it or it doesn't help you it doesn't amplify things for you then don't don't use it but this morning I've chosen to use it a few places and I I hope you'll be blessed by it I want us to read Psalm 83 because it's clear to me that that's where we are I'm going going to be speaking this morning on 12 reasons why Believers support Israel and the Jewish people it's a little different but it's what we need for this hour because there's never been such a demonic Spirit of anti-Semitism like there is in the world today it's greater than the day of Hitler it's everywhere it's now among Christian people and if you're on social media you will find out that there are those who claim the message of the hour who are very very anti-israel anti- the Jewish people and and I don't know what prophet they're following because this book is just one little quote book that brother Dale catch put together of of reference after reference and paragraph after paragraph where brother brandham tells us that this nation of Israel is the Israel of God he said this is the miracle that was promised a nation born in a day so she may not be perfect but she is the Fulfillment of scripture she may not you know do everything just right but she is the Fulfillment of all the prophets prophesied so I'm going to bless her if you don't mind and I'm going to pray for her let's see what's happening in our world today interesting that we don't go to uh social media to find out and we don't even have to go to the newspaper we can go right to the word of God Psalm 83 all the whole psalm keep not silence oh God hold not your peace or be still oh God for behold your enemies are in tural and those who hate you have raised their heads they lay crafty schemes against your people and consult together against your hidden and precious ones they have said come and let us wipe them out as a nation now what other Nation do you think he's talking about he's not talking about the United States he's not talking about the United Kingdom he's talking about the nation of Israel he said let the name of Israel be in remembrance no more this is what the nations are chanting from The River To The Sea this was their chant all day Friday from The River To The Sea their Des desire is to annihilate the Jewish people from the face of the Earth but greater than the Palestinian Authority and Hamas and Hezbollah and Syria have tried but God gets the last save next verse for they have consulted together with one Accord and one heart against you they make a covenant the tents of Edom the and the ishmaelites of of Moab and the hearit sial and Amon and amalec the Philistines with the inhabitants of Ty Assyria also has joined with them wasn't that in the news yesterday they have helped the children of lot the ammonites and the moabites and have been an armed to them Sila pause and calmly think on that do to them as you did to the midianites as to cicera and jaben and the brook of Kishon who perished at indor who became like manure for the Earth make their nobles like orb and Zeb yes all their princes as Zeba and Zuna who say let us take POS possession for ourselves of the pastures of God oh my God make them like whirling dust like stubble or chaff before the wind as fire consumes the forest and as the flame sets the mountain Ablaze so pursue and afflict them with your Tempest and terrify them with your tornado or hurricane fill their faces with shame that they may seek this is the ultimate purpose that they may seek inquire for and insistently require your name oh lord it's not to slaughter the innocent it's to lift up the God of Israel who welcomes the Arab's faith yeah he welcomes them to come and call on his name fill their faces with shame that they may seek inquire for and insistently require your name oh Lord let them be put to shame and dismayed forever yes let them be put to shame and perish that they may know that you whose name alone is the Lord are the most most high not only over the Jewish people but over all the Earth Grant it oh God we agree with the psalmist prayer we ask that you would help us today help our time in the word may we not flinch may we not back up may we not relent but may we stand in solidarity with your word we call call out for the souls of the Muslim world we call out for those who identify themselves as Palestinians may they know that the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob desires to also be their God lord stand with your people our dear friends many many that we know who are in bomb shelters today their little children scared I've heard from friends this week that said Stephen we have tried to keep the children calm but in circumstances like this it's so difficult to do God you are peace you are Shalom you are safety we pray that you will bring great peace to the Innocents to the children to the lives to the families that are uh that are unsure we pray for secular Israel that they also may know that you alone are the answer their answer is not in politicians it's not in bowing to the pressures of the United Nation their peace comes from The God Who has prepared a way to bring them safely through May there be a turning of of young secular Jewish hearts and Minds to the god of Israel May there be a stirring among them as they return to the god of the Bible Lord Jesus your Prophet has told us that they would receive their Holy Ghost Revival we know that that is for an appointed time and yet we pray that nothing would be able to hinder it we ask BL these things in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory and the saint said you may be seated isn't he good I'm going to need you to be patient with me my voice is still unsettled from last week my mouth and throat is still extremely dry we are pressing through circumstances and if you pray I know the Lord will hear your prayer amen Psalm 121 and4 elas I'm going to need to harass you today in front of your friends see he keeps coming back for punishment he does a great job with it Psalm 1214 behold he that keepeth Israel shall he's busy what's he busy doing keeping Israel Psalm 137 5 and six read it ellias will you if I forget thee Oh Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy can you read that in the Amplified now if I forgot if I forget you oh Jerusalem let my right hand forget its skill with the harp let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I remember you not if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy is that what it said amen number one I don't usually preach like this or teach like this 12 reasons to support Israel and the Jewish people many Church fathers have taught that God was finished with the Jews and left them in Exile as a sign of their Divine rejection however this all changed dramatically with Israel's restoration as a nation back in its ancestrial home we're going to look today at 12 biblical reasons why Believers and in fact all Christians should support bless and stand with the Jewish nation of Israel read reason number one Israel is the only nation on earth created by a sovereign Act of God I want you to say both times both not only her birth but her rebirth Sovereign Act of God the certain this certainly includes the modern Rebirth of the Jewish State Israel belongs to God himself as creator of Heaven and Earth God has the right of ownership to the universe and therefore he can give his land to whomever he chooses God is given the title deed of the land of Israel to Abraham Isaac Jacob and their descendants forever Genesis 177 and 8 in the Amplified Bible get ready to read it Ellas and I will establish my covenants between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generation for an everlasting for an everlasting solm pledge read on to be a God to you and to your posterity after you that's correct and I will give to you and to your posterity after you the land in which you are a stranger going from place to place all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God do you believe the word for 3500 years the land of Israel has belonged to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and their seed Forever by an everlasting and eternal blood Covenant recorded in the Bible the land that God promised to Israel includes the modern-day nation of Israel parts of Moder day Egypt Syria Lebanon and Iraq we're not just contending for the nation for the land land of Israel we're we're claiming the ancestrial land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the Bible clearly records that Abraham plead with God to allow Ishmael to own the land and to inherit the future promises fulfill God sent back a one-word text no he said no Abraham W with with a loving fatherly spirit will you consider Ishmael is there any Poss possibility that you would allow him to be the promised seed and the promised son and God just simply says no I won't do that and how many of you know God is Sovereign he shows Mercy where he desires to show Mercy it's what the scripture tells us and God said no I will not accept Ishmael as the promised son Isaiah 667 through 10 jot these verses down these are good scriptures to hold on to in time like this before Zion you ready to read ellias would you like to just I'll just send you my notes afterwards so you don't have to write and read at the same time I'll send them to you now read before Zion travailed she gave birth before her pain Came Upon her yes she was delivered of a malech child yes who has heard of such a thing who has heard of such a thing who has seen such things shall a land be born in one day or shall a nation be brought forth in a moment for as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children Hallelujah read on shall I bring to the moment of birth and not cause to bring forth says the Lord shall I who cause to bring forth shuts the womb says your lord your God Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her all you who love her yeah Rejoice for Joy with her all you who mourn over her is that right in the message the voice of the sign 1964 paragraph 38 brother brandom said Israel is a nation God doesn't deal with Israel as an individual Israel is a nation you see that means the good the bad and the Ugly this is why it doesn't matter that everything is not perfect God said I'm not dealing with them as individuals I'm dealing with them as a nation so those who do right and those who do wrong are a part of the same nation and God deals with them in equal proportion Israel is a nation always dealt with them and in the last days after the going away of the church the Rapture then God Will Save Israel as a nation is that clear what Israel is he talking about the reborn Jewish state of Israel what we now know as the modern state of Israel it's in the Homeland help me now so so don't come around and say this is not the Israel of the Bible this is the Israel of the Bible the Jew is in the Homeland ready for it and they'll be saved we know why Romans 11 tells us they were partially blinded for the sake of the Gentiles one of the Mysteries that brother brandom teaches us right out of Scofield's Bible is that mystery of the Jewish blindness being removed as a nation a whole nation looks up and realizes and recognizes what is this here he stands what is responsible who is responsible for these nail prints in your hand he said oh these I got them in the household of my brethren my friends gave me these let me tell you something there will be weeping and mourning and wailing and that is at the second coming it's in the Homeland now ready for it and they'll what be saved and the Bible said Nation b day he just read it Isaiah's prophecy a nation born in a day literally it happen one day Israel is not a nation the Jews have no Homeland the next [Music] day she has an ancestral Homeland restored God don't deal with Jews as an individual he deals with them as a nation Israel always now would would you read the rest of that it's his Nation he didn't call America his Nation he called Israel his nation and here he is fixing to bring his Nation out of a nation in an exodus bring his people from a judgment powerful powerful because the church is calling for the Judgment of the Jewish Nation this whole replacement theology that is so popular in the modern Church world that the church has replaced Israel it's a lie there's no reason for that you and I have been grafted in according to the New Testament we get our life out of the root amen what root which root The Offspring The Root and The Offspring in of David that's where it comes from one more quotation here as the eagle stirs her nest uh paragraph 34 you you seem a little aggressive Pastor you I I I am I am I feel a little aggressive I've been challenged all week by Christians who are embracing replacement theology those who have called the Star of David a satanic symbol because they spend all of their time on YouTube instead of in the word let's hear what the prophet said let's let YouTube serve its purpose I'm preaching on YouTube right now let it serve its purpose let us use it for Ministry but that's not where we get our facts if you're going to believe everything you see or hear on YouTube may I direct you to all of the things that we have against brother brandom against the message of the hour and if you you look hard enough you'll find things against your church are you going to believe that we must not we must not in in the the message uh as the eagle s her nest paragraph 34 uh they had these packing these Jews in Old crippled ones on their backs so they went up to interview them and they said are you coming back to die in the Homeland said no we're coming to see the Messiah when they were making their way back that gets me when they were W making their way back remember the threats of the Arab League of Nations was already uh blowing threats against them and so the world says you're really going to come and sit there like sitting ducks while they kill you all no we're not coming back to the Homeland to die we're coming back to see the Messiah Hal hallelujah hallelujah he's coming he's coming said no we're coming to see the Messiah when the Fig Tree puts forth its branches oh brother Israel's becoming a nation again you doubt that that's the restoration of the state of of of the nation of Israel I don't sir he said this old six point star of David flies the oldest flag in the world no mention of a satanic symbol here the oldest flag in the world the first time it flew for 2500 years they're in their own land now that's not Pope's calendar that's God's calendar Hallelujah Messiah will come just as sure as they're standing there waiting for him we're at the end time oh little eaglets press through the door of Mercy go flying as hard as you can when they brought them up those airplanes come down to get those Jews they were still plowing with old wooden instruments like they did hundreds and thousands of years ago still do it in South Africa so then when we find out that they was afraid of that airplane they were scared to get in it one old Rabbi stepped out there and said don't be afraid he said our Prophet promised us that someday we'd go to the Homeland on the wings of an eagle that big TW wa plane raised up with them Jews that's what the prophet saw am Hallelujah he didn't know what it was he should have called it an airplane he said it's Eagle's Wings they'll come back on seen that old airplane raised up there 2500 years ago that's what the prophet was seeing now it's coming to pass right now coming to pass right now bringing them back on the wings of the eagle do you believe that Joshua I'm so sorry would you grab me a a lozen let me see if I can do it without spitting it out I'm I'm very sorry thank you so we know multiple times in these quotations brother brandham calls the nation of Israel God's time piece he calls Jerusalem God's God's time peace he calls the Jewish people God's time peace amen so number one why we support pray thank you H for the for Israel and the Jewish people number one Israel is the only nation on Earth would it have been too much to ask you to have opened it great D it's glued in I told you this is going to be an unusual service Israel is the only nation on earth created by Sovereign Act of God number two we got to hurry God loves Israel he loves them it's simple he loves them Ellas we're reading Jeremiah 31 1-9 let's listen to this carefully at the same time saith the Lord will I be the God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my people is there any mention of Egypt or Assyria or no but I will be the God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my people read on thus saith the Lord the people which were left of the sword found Grace in the wilderness even Israel when I went to cause him to rest the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yay I have loved thee with an everlasting love don't forget you're excited about this therefore I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee again I will build thee and thou shalt be built and thou shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make marry yes yes Israel they are dancing people so is spiritual Israel we're dancing people too all right read on Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria come on Nathan the Planters shall plants and shall eat them as common things Hallelujah we Nathan can Nathan in the back there on the back row he can testify that this scripture has come to pass because he has participated with a group of Christian people who have gone to the land year after year after year restoring the V Vineyards of Samaria and I want to tell you something there's nothing like the feeling of cutting grapes in the fields of Samaria and looking over and seeing the ancient sight of Shiloh where the Tabernacle in the wilderness sat and you're standing there saying I am standing in the middle of the Fulfillment of biblical prophecy talk about making you feel important that'll do it for you all right read on for there shall be a day that the Watchmen upon the mounts Ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord Our God yes for thus sayith the Lord sing with gladness for Jacob and Shout among the chief of the Nations publish ye praise ye and say oh Lord th people the remnants of Israel behold I will bring them from the North Country he brought them out of Russia we saw it happening in and even to this day it's still happening Russian Jews are still making Aliah did you know there's been one plan L one plain land this week in the middle of War of Russian Jews coming home he's still fulfilling his word hallelujah hallelujah read on and gather them from the coasts of the earth and with them the Blind and the lame yes the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return Yes yes they shall come with weeping and with supplications will I lead them I will cause them to walk by the rivers of water in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for I am for I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is my first first born I want you to know that's power powerful prophetic language referring back to to verse three yay I have loved thee with an everlasting love so one of the reasons why we love and pray for Israel and the Jewish people is because God loves her I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee after a season of judgment the sword God is motivated by his everlasting love to restore Israel yes sir no note that it's an everlasting love an unceasing love a NeverEnding love notice that it is an unconditional love just like the love he has for his Gentile bride I'm pretty glad about that it was this love that birth God's plan with Israel and the love this love also will bring it to a glorious end now there's two long passages here so read them excitingly and quickly Deuteronomy 7 6-9 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people upon himself all right above all people that are upon the face of the Earth above them all the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people think about it for ye were the fewest of all people but because the Lord hath loved you because the Lord loved you that's why because he loved you and because he would keep the oath go ahead which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand yes and redeemed you out of the house of bondman yes from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt yes read on no no there therefore know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth covenants and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations I I don't think this is about to expire I don't think we're near to a thousand Generations just yet now read Romans 11 because this is very important it talks about you and I yes 24 through 26 this is Amplified for if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild Olive Tree and against nature grafted into a cultivated Olive Tree how much easier will it be to graft these natural branches back on the original Parent stock of their own Olive Tree amen lest you be self up opiniated wise in your own conceits I do not want I do not not want you to miss this hidden truth and mystery Brethren a hardening insensibility has temporarily be fallen apart of Israel to last until the full number of the in gathering of the Gentiles has come in and so all so all Israel will be saved you somebody said what about the Jew that's not really a Jew don't you think God knows how to sort that out don't try to do God's business he doesn't need your help there's apostles who claim to be apostles who are not Apostles right pastors who claim to be pastors who are not pastors so it shouldn't surprise you that there will also be Jews who pretend to be jew Jews who are not Jews but God knows without a DNA [Applause] test woo somebody said this isn't really a shouting message it can be it can be you you know why if for no other reason now I'm giving you 12 good ones but if for no other reason you ought to love this because the quicker we get this in our Inner Man the quicker we can do what our responsibility is so this little Gentile bride can be raptured out amen and then guess what when the Brethren when Joseph dismisses the Brethren think about the wife think about what comes next so all Israel can you read it good like that and so all Israel will will be saved will be saved as it is written the deliverer will come from Zion not not not not America from Zion he will banish ungodliness from Jacob I'm going to cleanse my son God said I'll take care of my son I'll get that secularism out of my Jewish people I'll settle that you leave me to do my work read on ain't there another is that the end of it well I have 27 and 28 after it I'll read it I didn't put my number there but I've got it and this will be my Covenant my agreement with them when I shall take away their sins all right read on Elias from the point of view of the Gospel good news they the Jews at present are enemies of God that's how it looks right now come on they crucified after all they crucified the Lord and the church wants them to pay I'm telling you the Catholic Church wants them to pay and the Protestant Church wants them to pay but God said I'll take care of them don't you worry they're not really my enemy I've chosen you I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thy own blood and said unto thee live when everybody else was prophesying your death and your destruction I prophesied life to you and the healing of your bloody wound this is what the scripture tells us read on Elias you're doing great which is for your advantage and benefits but from the point of view of God's choice of election that's something you all ought to understand election yeah of divine selection he he said you didn't choose me I chose you the reason why you chose me is because I chose first ain't that what he said to this bride he already said it to his Nation read they are still the Beloved dear to him for the sake of their forefathers this is New Testament anybody with me yes someone once asked how can God love a sinful Nation like Israel the answer is simple by the same unconditional love the Lord has toward his church indeed while we were yet sinners what happened Christ died for us so here's a simple rule for all believers we should love what Jesus loves Romans 58 but God shows and clearly proves mes his own love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners Christ the Messiah the anointed one died for us reason number three that all believers should love and pray for Israel and the Jewish people God is a covenant keeping God there it is we could go home but I spent too much time in this to go home I'm going to get it out we got to read it he's made a Covenant with both the people and the land did you know the prophets of the Old Testament said that God married himself to the dirt somebody said why want a two-state solution ever successfully work because God did not give the land that he married to the sons of Ishmael he gave the land to Abraham's descendants through Isaac and he said so that you'll know that I'm going to keep my word I am marrying myself to the land she is also my wife not just the people now I'm telling you that's a jealous God over a piece of real estate the world mocks and they say I don't understand why there's so much talk about a little tiny piece of real estate well here is what you need to be asking why does the enemy want that dirt so bad because it belongs to God and when God ultimately gives it back to his people and He will he'll show to the nations of the earth I am the Covenant keeping God that I said I was so he affirmed his promise to give Israel the land of Canaan with a sworn Covenant you remember in Genesis 17 if you've ever been to Elon Moray if you've ever been up to the top of Elon Moray and you have looked out over the nation of Israel like God took Abraham and he said I want you to look out over that and and and and we've been there Nathan you you went with us that day too didn't you they took us there after we had worked in the vineyard and you look out over that landscape and you realize that once upon a time Abraham stood on that mountain and his God said to him you see all that I'm going to give it to you and to your descendants forever and ever and ever I I think Abraham probably danced yes I think he probably I don't know if he did or not but I know I did I had myself a Time upon that mountain read for us Genesis 151 17-18 when the sun had gone down and a thick Darkness had come on Behold a smoking oven and a flaming torch passed between those pieces on the same day the Lord made a covenant promise pledge with Abram saying to your descendants I have given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates neither of which rivers run through the modern state of Israel so there's some more land to come there has to be now this was a covenant you you know uh Abraham he hears this up on the mountain God said I'm going to give you this land and The Descendants your descendants are going to be as as innumerable as the stars of the heaven and Abraham replies this is paraphrase but he replies how can I be sure that you really will do this and God answered by coming down like a burning torch which passed through the sacrificial animals the offering that was given to seal the land promised with Abraham by a covenant oath and that's what Elias just read one of God's main character traits is he's a covenant keeper if he says it he means it his word cannot lie do you believe that second Timothy 2:13 in the Amplified read it and we're going to try to hurry up a little bit we're dragging if we are faithless do not believe and untrue to him he remains true he remains true if Israel has backslidden he remains true if you've grown cold in indifferent toward God he remains true come on read faithful to his word and his righteous character for he cannot deny himself he cannot deny himself in the second seal paragraph 23738 and 39 and and 40 he said now I just want to ask you something just look at something right here in the face Israel is now for the first time for 2500 years here a nation the oldest flag in the world is flying over Jerusalem tonight Israel is in her Homeland he said there was a brother here one time wanted to be a missionary he felt to go to be a missionary to the Jews I said you might get one now and then oh people thinks the whole nation no sir and he's talking about in his own day 1963 he said Israel is converted as a not as a person a nation will be born in a day that's Israel all Israel is saved just remember that Paul said so all Israel is saved now notice all Israel that's exactly right now notice but he said when you see the Fig Tree and all the other trees putting forth their buds now watch there's never been a time for 2500 years that Israel has ever come to her Homeland we've got that little show of 3 Minutes to Midnight you know there she is a nation the six-pointed Mand David or Star of David flying and all these things is there any doubt after hearing that that brother brandham believed that the modern state of Israel is the Fulfillment of the prophet's words no doubt no out Romans 11:26 read it in the Amplified and so all Israel will New Testament all Israel will be saved read as it is written the deliverer will come from Z from Zion he will banish ungodliness from Jacob we just read that a moment ago now listen to this in the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit until God is finished with the Gentiles Israel was blinded they went off into sin into transgression against God because God blinded their eyes that we might be grafted in he said you get it can't y'all say Amen 26th verse now and so all Israel shall be saved he said God blinded them purposefully for you and I they cannot see because God blinded them well well when are they going to repent they will when are they going to turn to they will you can't hate them until they come in you've got to love them and bless them and pray for them they cannot see because God blinded them and all Israel true Israel shall be saved the Bible defines what a true Israelite is a true Jew one who obeys the Covenant of God he said what did the angel say say glory to finish the transgression of Israel I've come to tell you that there will come a time when Israel's transgression God will cut off that wild branch and grab into that back that real Branch again Hall if you believe that say amen amen oh sometimes it makes my heart jump come on see them poor miserable people cut off out yonder not knowing where they're going and think that God in his Mercy did that you're really going to despise the Jewish people when you're the reason why this is not to shame us it's to say the audacity of the church to say that the church has replaced Israel because she rejected the Messiah she did exactly what God prepared her to do he wouldn't allow her to see who he was because he also had a covenant with you he was bringing you and I in amen he said makes my heart jump praise God he did that in his mercy so that I could be saved ain't that great read would you take over and read for me blinded their eyes from their own Messiah shut their ears up that they could not hear him yet looked right at his miracles and looked right at his miracles and things that he was doing mhm now in the same message paragraph 51 so Israel did a wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen I'm not going too deep into this we could really divide ourselves this morning on that 70th week couldn't we God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgressions will be turning away from the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be all of them will receive Pentecostal Jews Hallelujah the real kind Pentecostal and in the fifth seal paragraph 257 now if they hadn't been if they hadn't been blinded God said let them alone they're not worthy but being that they was blinded by God his grace reached down to them amen talk about Amazing Grace and give each one of them a robe because all Israel will be saved I know you think you know the number but you might be surprised because the ceiling is supposed to take place after the second at the second coming after the Rapture the two witnesses have their Ministry with the 144,000 before the second coming sir so you may not know the number like you think you do I may not know the number and give each one of them a robe because all Israel will be saved everyone has his name written that's right what does that last sentence say now this is a very uh important scripture that we've got to read very carefully Revelation 6: 9-1 11 listen to this very carefully I shared this with a rabbi who was amazed he was absolutely amazed when the lamb broke open the fifth seal I saw at the foot of the altar The Souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for adhering to the word of God and for the testimony they had born now go back in the King James it says and for the testimony that they had the church teaches that this is Martyrs for Christ most of the end time prophecy preachers believe that this is Christians who have been beheaded or martyred for the cause of Christ brother brandham caught the spirit of this verse it didn't say for Christ it said whose lives have been sacrificed for adhering to the word of God they kept the word and for the testimony that they had later it says about another group of Overcomers they held the testimony of Jesus Christ this says and for the testimony that they had born next verse they cried in a loud voice oh Sovereign Sovereign Lord holy and true how long I'm not going to let you read how long how long now before you will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth did you know this week that that area under that altar is getting Fuller and Fuller whole families massacred in their bed there was a whole family of five missing and they found them they thought they had been carried away but they found them in their bed the father laying on top of his grown sons and and wife the father laying on top and all of them murdered in their own beds died as Jews not having the testimony of Jesus Christ and the church world would have you believe they went to hell it's what they teach they couldn't have gone anywhere else because they didn't have the testimony of Jesus Christ but God let brother brandham see under that seal this wasn't Christian Martyrs these were Jews that had been killed down Through the Ages who were faithful to the word that had been given to them and they kept their testimony clean before God and because of that they hang out under the Altar and constantly they cry if you could hear them I believe Ashley wrote a song she wrote a song about it they're crying out oh Lord how long how long before you avenge our our blood don't you come around and tell me that God forgot his Covenant with Israel he's letting them hang out there under that altar until they recognize who he is in an appointed hour and they will they will they will read on then they were each given a long and flowing and Fest of white robes this is what brother Brandon was talking about and told to rest rest and wait patiently a little while longer a little while longer until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their Brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been and we don't know this number we don't know how many will have to give their lives under an old Covenant as I said this week more and more and listen this is just starting the death toll will rise in in unbelievable Fashions this week but God has made a covenant with his people are you with me number four I got to hurry Israel is blessed that's why you should pray and love the nation of Israel and the Jewish people because Israel is blessed Genesis 12:3 and I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you are you sure you want to spew your YouTube Venom you need to know you're not going to do it here not here oh no the door that brought you in can take you right out are you being that yeah I'm being that serious I'm being that Ser I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee Israel shall all families of the earth be blessed God's purpose is to bless the whole world through the nation of Israel how many of you know it's happened in many many many ways they're ahead of us in medical science they're ahead of us in technology the first paraplegic that ever walked Walked In A contraption that I was there the day it was unveiled in Tel Aviv the very day that it was introduced to the world I happened to get to be there because of the connections that had taken me to Israel on that particular trip and to see a man unable to move his head his body I mean from his neck down unable to move they strap him into a machine and he walks across I think I think later my wife saw the same machine in Washington when we were there with APAC I think you were there and saw the same machine that this man who had spent his life unable to move and now they strap him in of course he looks like a robot now now but he's moving and he picks up his feet and begins to walk across the stage and lift up his arms because of the technology that God has given to those people there are more Nobel prizes among those people so be careful how you spew do you want a curse on your head do you want one on your home do you want one on your family it matters what we say it matters what we say uh that's right Pastor go right ahead and tell it are you angry maybe just a little maybe just a little Israel's blessed read this for me I want to read Genesis 12:2 and three in the Amplified Bible carefully and emphatically read it and I will make you of you and I will make of you am I'm making you nervous yes sorry a great nation and I will bless you with abundance increase of favors all right and make your name famous and distinguished he's certainly done that he certainly made that little Nation famous come on and you will be a blessing dispensing good to others now this is an important part read this and I will bless those who bless you who confer Prosperity or happiness upon you and curse him who curses or uses insolent language toward you all right whoa whoa whoa insolent language on I looked it up and in the Hebrew did you put that did you happen to put that it means insultingly contemptuous in speech or conduct I I'm going to be real honest with you I know this is just like raw this is raw today but I don't have a lot of patience for people who believe that the United States planing 911 I don't I don't have a lot of patience I don't have patience for flat earthers either by the way and I don't have patience for the garbage that they're pedaling out there this week that's right that Israel created Hamas and that Israel is the one who pre-planned this I do not believe that even the wickedness of her government would allow the immorality of planting an attack that would burn her own babies and by the way I know what YouTube says but before it's over you'll get to see the pictures if you desire to see them they're out there they're out there and you'll be able to see them if you want to I've seen the burned bodies I've seen photographs all week of the children's bodies who were burned I've not seen the photograph of decapitated babies but the world is saying and Al jazer who influences a whole lot of what we get through social media they're reporting that it's all made up and that those babies were not decapitated but you'll be able to see before it's over please don't buy into the conspiracy theories of those who hate Israel and the Jewish people please don't buy into the conspiracy theories of those who hate this nation she's wicked America's Wicked I'm not taking up for her failure she's done Wicked and awful and terrible things and yet God still has a people here who have also blessed the World by sending them the truth of the gospel and he remembers his Remnant so though there's pollution and corruption and though there are Wall Street Jews and though there are Rockefeller Jews just remember none of that changes the Covenant that God made with his people so be careful about your insolent language insultingly contemptuous and speecher conduct overbearing you bully Spirit showing a rude and arrogant lack of respect so we want to watch our insolent language toward Israel read on and go back just a little bit in fact read the whole verse again and I will bless those and I will bless those who bless you who confer Prosperity or happiness upon you yes and curse him who curses or uses insolent language toward you in you will all the families and Kindred of the earth be blessed and by you they will bless themselves Hallelujah are you with me fifth seal paragraph 287 8889 I think the one of the things that's holding this nation together because they've always respected the Jew that's right given him a place now now here is the issue brother Brandon boils it down for us you honor the Jew and God will honor you what about the what about the phony Jew God you honor the Jew you may not get the opportunity to inspect their circumcision so if you if you think they're Jew you feel like they're Jew they present themselves as Jew you honor the Jew and God will honor you I'll tell you I admire anybody that would go and live in the land of Israel there's turmoil all the time how do you know because I've spent enough time there myself I've been there when they handed out gas masks to American citizens because they were afraid of what was about to happen I've been there when we had to teach our children where they would go if a bomb was dropped I've been there I understand but I can't imagine the full commitment that many of our friends have made to leave the pleasures of this nation and the benefits of this nation to go and live in a nation like that but if you honor the Jew now In fairness I want you to I want you to hear the rest of this fifth seal now there's a bunch of Jews that's Renegades so some Jews are Renegades but you honor the Jew and God will honor you uh uh uh somebody read uh the rest of that for me would you just like oh there may be a few Renegades here but the real Jew God has put his name on the book yes before the foundation of the world and here he was murdered down in this time and remember think of it now how perfect this is right after them millions of slaughtered Jews innocent people by the nations of the world here the scripture says right in this time that they're each one under the altar realize what's happened and they're given what about the Jews that Hitler murdered there they are fifth seal paragraph 244 the Jews and Hitler hated them and so did ikan so did Stalin all of the rest of the world see but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them you know why these people lost their lives in the kabut of of Southern Israel they lost their lives because because they were Jews they were killed because they were Jews there's no other reason for their killing and if that's the criteria to be under the altar in the fifth seal then that's exactly where they've been carried number five I'm hurrying it doesn't feel like it but I'm hurrying God Hallows his name in Ezekiel 36 the prophet powerfully described how God will restore the land and people of Israel in the last days when Ezekiel sees him returning from the Nations and being filled with God's spirit he gives a clear reason why God is doing this read Ezekiel 36:21 for me help us Lord to get this out but I had regard concern and compassion for my holy name for my name whose name is at stake God's name is at stake read on which the house of Israel had profaned among the Nations to which they went my own people were profaning my name to the Heathen Nations so he declares in verse 23 and 24 read it and I will vindicate the Holiness of my great name God is Not only jealous for his people he's jealous for his name I will vindicate the Holiness of my great name and separate it for its holy purpose from all that defiles it my name which have been profaned among the Nations which you have profaned among them and the Nations will know understand and realize that I am the Lord the sovereign ruler who calls forth loyalty and obedience service when I shall be set apart by you and my Holiness Vindicated in you before their eyes and yours for I will take you from among the Nations and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land hello 75 years this year 75 years the Swiss Theologian Carl Barth stated in 1967 he said now you can read it in the newspapers God is fulfilling his promises number six Israel is key for Revival and blessing for the church read Romans 11 12-15 are you giving out okay read oh sister Beverly is not giving out read now their stumbling their lapse their transgression has so enriched The World At Large and if Israel's failure means such riches for the Gentiles think what an enrichment and greater Advantage will follow their full reinstatements it's to your benefit for the full restoration of the House of Israel to take place read on but now but now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles listen in as much then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles I lay great stress on my Ministry and magnify my office in the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous in order to stir them up to imitate copy and appropriates and thus managing to save some of them some of them for if their rejection and exclusion from the benefits of Salvation were overruled for the reconciliation of a world to God what will their acceptance and admission mean it will be nothing short of life from the dead Resurrection Resurrection this means that Israel's restoration is key for everyone who thirsts for the outpouring which God still has in store or to put it another way if you thirst for any Revival particularly bride's Revival pray for Israel she's a key that's why he keeps telling us over and over again she's the time piece she's the time piece watch her in uh the revelation of Jesus Christ I want to read this we're we're moving Zechariah 12th chapter and we want to take this real prayerfully now I want to get this for the glory of God this is the original teaching on the church Ages which is called the revelation of Jesus Christ series Zechariah 12 let's begin the n9th verse he's speaking of the coming Zechariah 12 we begin at 9 9th verse it shall come to pass zachari prophesying 487 years before the coming of Christ and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour out upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced this is Zachariah prophesying of the second coming of Jesus Christ when he hasn't even come yet the first time but look at paragraph 301 now when is the gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentile is finished the gospel is ready to do what to go to the Jews oh I if I just for tell you a little something is fixing to happen right here see right in this day you see it's fixing to happen we get it in the church age and this great thing is fixing to happen we'll carry over to Revelation 11 and pick up those two prophets Elijah and the Moses returning back again for the Jews who's we're ready for it everything is setting in order just ready now this is very important this Gentile message as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles one of the reasons why you're praying for Israel is because you have a responsibility to believe that God will help the gospel the Gentiles will take it right back somebody said I thought that was after the Rapture will you want the Rapture to come then we've got to get that gospel to them somehow and right now all you can do is pray oh I want to say some things you know all those criticisms in 2002 when we started working in Israel you remember all those criticisms remember all the quotes they sent us I mean does anybody need the same quote a 100 times God wouldn't let brother brandom go God wouldn't let brother brandom go God wouldn't let brother brandom go God wouldn't let brother brandom go there was a reason for that brother brandham had a signed gift if he would have gone there with that signed gift the people would have accepted what he was representing get that it wasn't time yet that's why I hung out in the hanger that's why he was out there hearing from the it's not don't you go but that doesn't mean that it will always be that way that sign gift is gone but there is a bride there is a gentile bride this Gentile message as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles the Gentiles will take it right back to the Jews again and the Rapture will come you see I'm a little offended by the fact I called brother George Smith some years ago uh driving through North Carolina and I said brother George I'm a little I'm a little perplexed by something he said what is it I said did you know there has never been a single sermon translated into Hebrew well he just stammers and stutters and he said I have no idea and he know he know we've had this discussion many times he said well I have no idea except for the fact that the Believers have a tendency to believe that we have no part it's a separate Covenant and we have no part in this and I said and I could also agree with that I understand where the logic is coming from but what about what brother brandom says in the revelation of Jesus Christ Series this Gentile message as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles the Gentiles would take it right back to the Jews again and the Rapture will come and even Dr Vil got it right in the church age book you heard me right he goes on this is a revelation story I don't I don't think I have to read all that let's go to the yellow he copies it right over now when is the gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is finished the gospel is ready to go back to the Jews oh if I could just tell you something that's about to happen right in in in this our day this is a quote which I feel very comfortable with no Theologian adjusting the mindset no Theologian adding an idea of what the seventh angel messenger's real responsibility was if you add something to what brother brandham said about that seventh angel messenger you may be on Dangerous Ground that's right so I love the fact that he just they left this here these two prophets Moses and Elijah turning the gospel back to the Jews we're ready for it everything is in order I'm I'm moving on everything is in order as the Jews brought the message to the Gentiles read it Brother gy come on even so the Gentiles will take it right back to the Jews I thought this was supposed to be after Rapture is that clear now to all of you who get all upset and perturbed because somebody waved an Israeli flag brother brandom says and I uh uh in a message I'll give you the moment but in Isaiah 5:26 and he will lift up a signal a sign an ins sign to call together if you're looking at King James it says an ins sign if you're looking in Amplified a signal to call together a hostile people from afar to execute his judgment on Judea and will hiss for them from the end of the Earth as the bees are hissed for excuse me as bees are hiss from their hives and behold they shall come speedily it's the lifting up of the insign that caused the Jews to come from the nations of the earth brother brandom that word insign in Hebrew something lifted up a standard a signal a banner a sign a sail or a flag He Shall Set up an inside Isaiah 11:12 for the Nations and shall assemble the outcast of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth and by the way that's that's figurative language nobody fell off the corner or the Edge in a message an ins sign an insign of course we all know what an ins sign is it's something that's in commemoration lift it up something to people to look up it's something placed before you and God promised in Isaiah 5:26 there would be an inside lifted up there would be an ins sign lifted up in the message the voice of a sign 106 notice what sign 106 the next one what does the sign do the sign is to attract the the attention and to get the elected ready and out of the way before judgment strikes that's why God sent the Gentiles assign he sent the Jews assign to get them home and in the message the mark of the beast and the Seal of God he says and I'm reading the Yellow Part the oldest flag in the world the six-pointed Star of David the oldest flag in the world flies for the first time for 2500 years yes and here's what he called so you you YouTube Watchers and social media stalkers and whatever else uh may be hearing this and you want to call that star of David a satanic sign in an ancient Pagan symbol I don't know what it was way back when on but I'll tell you what I know now the prophet of God Called It an ins sign that was to be lifted up to gather the Nations back to Israel and I feel very comfortable lifting it up today and reminding you that in that we have seen the Fulfillment of scripture amen the ins sign that was to be lifted up Israel Palestine blossoming as a rose you read in the magazines and watch how they come back way down in Iran and so forth so he's clear number seven we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Jewish people for their contributions which gave birth to the Christian faith Romans 15 2627 flash it up there I don't have time to read it it uh verse 27 it ha pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things carnal things the Believers of Macedonia understood an important principle salvation came to the Gentile first excuse me salvation came to the Gentile world through Israel and they were obligated to return a gift of thanks that's why they blessed the Apostle with a with a generous offering to take back to the church in Jerusalem in John 4:22 you Samaritans do not know where uh what you are worshiping you worship what you don't comprehend we do know what we are worshiping we worship what we have knowledge of and understand for after all salvation comes from among the Jews what a debt we owe what a debt we owe number eight our spiritual roots are in Israel and in the Jewish people that Romans 11 thing it's a Botanical Miracle you you you you've got something going on that that's that's miraculous yes sir Paul then describes God doing something no farmer would ever do he cuts off limbs from the natural tree and grasps Wild Olive branches in their place naturally this process is done exactly the other way around Noble branches are grafted into wild trees to improve their fruit but Paul relates this strange grafting exercise to Israel and the Gentile Nations the wild Gentiles are grafted in to the noble Jewish Olive Tree by faith in Jesus and are nourished by the rich sap of the Messianic Hope Rising from their prophets Patriarchs and Kings do not boast Romans 11:18 uh I'm hurrying do not boast over the branches and pride yourself at their expense if you do boast and feel Superior remember it is not you that support the root Ephesians 21-13 we don't have time to read it number nine now is the right time to pray and bless Israel Psalm 10216 when the Lord builds up Zion he will appear in his glory Glory you want the Lord to come in glory then we ought to pray for the building up of Zion Psalm 10213 you will arise and have mercy and loving kindness for Zion for it is time to have pity and compassion for her yes the set time has come the moment designated and how many of you know what the appointment word is in Hebrew moed it's a moed it's a moad number 10 God has changed his way of dealing with Israel this always shocks people it almost sounds it almost sounds heretical but God is the one who identifies it in Zechariah 8 11-15 read this one elas this one we can't skip but now I will not be unto the residue of this people start over but now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days saith the Lord of hosts I'm going to be different toward them read on for the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give their due and I will cause the remnants of this people to possess all these things see the church wants her to continue to pay for her blindness God said I once dealt with her accordingly now I'm going to help her now I'm going to bless her now I'm going to change the way I deal with her verse 13 and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse of among the Heathen oh house of Judah and House of Israel so will I save you and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strong for thus saith the Lord of hosts as I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the Lord of hosts and I repented not so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah fear ye not it's not time for her to pay the set time to favor her has come the set time to bless her has come Isaiah 54 and8 in a little burst of Wrath I hid my face from you for a moment but with age enduring love and kindness I will have compassion and mercy on you says the Lord your Redeemer Ezekiel 33:11 say to them as I live says the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked wied but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live turn back turn back from your evil ways for why will you die oh House of Israel Jeremiah 29:14 I will be found by you says the Lord and I will release you from captivity and gather you from all the nations and all the places to which I have driven you says the Lord and I will bring you back to the place from which I caused you to be carried away captive reason 11 are you still here the Jews are the family of Jesus did you hear that I love saying that to message Believers because they love saying back brother brandham said that Jesus was not a Jew did I say he was a Jew no I said the Jews are the family of Jesus this may be the simplest and one of the most profound reasons why we should love and pray for Israel and the Jewish people people Jesus was born in a Jewish Family can you dispute that no sir you see he wasn't particularly Jewish because his blood didn't come from Joseph he was born in a Jewish Family his siblings were Jewish you did know he had Earthly half siblings right they were Jewish he was raised and trained as a Jew and this may shock you he worshiped so so look brother uh tray it's like this if anybody were to have a problem with the fact that you're wearing a prayer Shaw they would have had a big problem if they would have lived in the Time of Our Lord because he wore something very similar to that in his day because he worshiped as a Jew it's another reason why we know Jesus danced because he grew up in a Jewish Family I do not believe he was the only one sitting around watching the rest of his family celebrate the Feast of Israel you dead dry starchy Christians dead Canadian dead American missionaries who go to Africa and try to make Americans out of the Africans it's a shame brother brandom didn't do it why would we do it let them worship God the way they feel to worship God go and we just should get over it this may be okay praise God Romans 9 3-5 read it Revelation 55 you'll have the notes Ellas you can just preach to the mirror you'll have it all you can just do whatever you want to do with it anybody else wants them you can have them too Revelation 55 oh this is good I've got to get this a brother came one time and he said yes it's true Jesus was born to a Jewish mother but you forgot one thing when Jesus rose from the dead he received a glorified body so he stopped being Jewish and now he is the universal brother of all mankind this sounds very impressive really doesn't it somebody's really thinking here Jesus the universal brother of mankind sounded amazing it's just not scriptural a lot of amazing things are not scriptural on because Revelation 5:5 said then one of the Elders of the Heavenly Sanhedrin said to me stop weeping see the lion of the tribe of Judah somebody say Judah yehudah Yehuda this time I will praise the Lord so Jesus did not stop identifying with the root he said the stop weeping see the line of the tribe of Judah the root Source hey put this up Revelation 55 Amplified the lion of the tribe of Judah the root source of David has won has overcome and conquered he can open the scroll and break its Seven Seals even in that most glorious Victorious moment he identified himself with his family and then Revelation 22:16 I Jesus have sent my messenger this is red letter to you my messenger Angel to you to witness and to give you Assurance of these things for the churches assemblies I am the root come on I am the source and The Offspring of the radiant and Brilliant any good and number 12 I'm almost as worn out as you are Isaiah 40 1-5 read it ellias Comfort ye Comfort ye my people the Bible commands us to comfort Israel sayith your God read speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her and her Warfare that her War is accomplished and that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins how long do you think the Jewish people should pay for rejecting the Messiah when it happened because of me it's time to forgive her it's time to pray for her it's time to bless her it's time for you to go to Israel when you can and see the land and meet the people it'll change your life I was supposed to leave tomorrow two weeks from tomorrow and may still he knows may still go Can't hardly wait to get there I told my wife I know you don't understand this but I would rather be there right now than here when I was 11 years old I went on tour of Israel for the first time 1979 I'm 55 now I was the only kid in the group my grandmother went to the school and begged for permission for me to go and my teacher said you can go if you bring back a report a slideshow and I did there were a lot of granny's and Grandpa on this tour we had a wonderful time of course I had got all the attention because I was the only kid so I loved every second of it this particular day they took us to yadvashem which is the memorial of the name it's the Holocaust Memorial Museum in that day it was in an old building now it's in a beautiful lovely facility that looks over the village of John the Baptist on carum beautiful Valley amazing place but in those days it was just in kind of a small building and there was a room that they took us to and the walls were covered in a mural of the Dead Jewish bodies of the Holocaust even the door when they closed the door you were completely surrounded by piles of naked Jewish bodies from the real photographs that were taken at toward the end of the Holocaust it was quite a moving very somber music and as we walked in the the guide the Jewish guide at yadvashem said to my grandmother I think this might be too much for him you might consider him going around and meeting you on the other side she said oh no he can handle it if I can handle it he can handle it she said he'll be fine but thank you so much for thinking about us and they closed those doors and they begin to tell the story of the Holocaust and the Jewish people and I began to weep and I began to hear an inner voice I know some people don't believe that God deals with people today but he does I began to hear an inner voice and I heard the dialogue of Ezekiel I Heard a Voice that said son of man can these bones live again and can you imagine I'm standing in in in in and everywhere I look are the dead bodies naked dead Jewish bodies that were piled up in ditches and and and the dirt was just pushed over them and no no one you know identifies their family members or anything the most awful thing and I'm having this spiritual experience as 11-year-old boy I heard the voice uh the inner voice of the Lord son of man can these bones live again and and I didn't say anything for a moment because I'm hearing this and it didn't dawn on me that I should answer as Ezekiel answered but when I realized what I was doing I said oh Lord thou knowest and he began to unfold the rest of that of that drama for me and instead in just a few moments time he said prophesy and as we begin to go through this in the spirit I I lost track of who I was with and why I was there and for just a few seconds of time that seemed like a long time I was just caught up into this experience and those those pictures of those dead bodies begin to transform before my eyes and I saw an army A mighty mighty Army uh this could have been in in in in in in my imagination had I not been prone to spiritual things but this was so profound and powerful and it marked my life and I couldn't explain what I'd seen except to tell what little bit of detail I've given you tonight but this afternoon but those dead bodies were no longer naked Twisted dead bodies now a mighty Army of Israel has stood on their feet and they're and and and they're stoic their chest are back and they're clothed in uh in in in uh in clothes and and in military uh gear and they're ready to fight this battle and I sobbed I'm sobbing I've been over a chair now and I'm sobbing and the little Jewish guide she said see I thought this might be too much but it wasn't that at all and when we when we stepped out my granny said honey what happened to you and I be to tell her this experience and she said' what do you think it means I said' I have no idea what it means but I know this from this day forward my heart is intricately connected with the Jewish people and the land of Israel I'll never be the same again that's the only explanation that I have for that exper for that feeling that I get when Israel is in a conflict like this there's a part of me that says I want to be there I would rather be there than here because I know that God is going to win this thing in the end I don't know how to explain it except I don't think I I'm not in any way saying don't misunderstand I'm not in any way saying that I have some specific or special role except except that I believe all believers should be Watchmen on the wall for Israel I believe it's part of our responsibility and duty to pray for the nation of Israel and for the Jewish people I want you to go back to the 12 reasons let me read them again in close music positions are coming hey it's just 130 my goodness of course this wasn't presented well because it was presented quickly reason number one these are 12 reasons to support Israel and the Jewish people number one Israel is the only nation on earth created by Sovereign Act of God and I believe that with every fiber of my being number two God loves Israel so I love her I love her I love her I love her her her political parties are just as argumentative as ours the lud and the conservative party and the and the advanced Liberal Party of Israel they're fighting right now they had to form an emergency Unity government to to help the nation get through War because they're so divided and they love they love to point their finger at at Benjamin Netanyahu forgetting so quickly the sacrifice that he has made for the nation of Israel for years it may be time for new blood but that's not my business my business is to pray sir I loved Ariel Chiron I've had the blessing and privilege of meeting three former Prime Ministers of Israel and shaking their hand and I was more honored by that than listening to President Obama address APAC these men have sacrificed yes so much God loves Israel number three God's a covenant keeping God number four Israel is blessed and I'm going to be blessed because I bless her number five God's jealous over his name he Hallows His holy name he's fighting for that name number six Israel is a key for Revival and blessing for the believing Church number seven we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Jewish people reason number eight Our Roots are in Israel my RO roots are there your roots are there because of Messiah the Bible cannot be understood from a Greek mentality it can only be understood from a hebraic mentality Our Roots are there number nine now is the right time to do it if you've been a little slack in praying for Israel will you understand that the set time has come cry out to God on her behalf somebody said I don't know how to pray Pray when you don't know how to pray the spirit of God will pray through you if you follow his leadership is't that right and number two when you don't know how to pray there's here's one way you can always pray and be right on Earth Lord on Earth in Earth as it is in heaven whatever Heaven's mind is over this let it be established number 10 God has changed his way of dealing with Israel he's no longer in the business of trying to punish her or put her in Exile he's now now gathered her back in reason 11 the Jews are the family of Jesus absolutely no doubt number 12 the Bible commands us to comfort Israel father thank you thank you that you're a covenant keeping God Why Don't We Stand play something softly father thank you that your word is clear to us it is our privilege it is not only our responsibility but is our privilege to pray for Israel we are not responsible for her her salvation you are but we are responsible to live a witness before her because even the Bible tells us that in that day the Jew will take a hold of our clothes and will ask us what meanthis hope what is this inside of you where did you find this [Music] peace and it'll be our responsibility to tell them that the real peace can only be found in a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua or Messiah Lord help us to live a life in front of our Gentile Neighbors when we're contemplating our own problems and the many many problems and complexities of this nation may we not be able to forget if I forget the old Jerusalem let my right hand shrivel up let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth Lord don't ever let us forget to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem for the protection of the Jewish people and although we don't participate in Jewish evangelism because we believe with all of our hearts that you have made a covenant with the Jewish people and then in that day all Israel will be [Music] saved we do bear responsibility in walking out as a light to pray as Watchmen on the wall both men and women asking that your perfect will be done to th for those people we are not cold and insensitive to the needs of the Arab Nation s or to the needs of the wandering Palestinians our hearts go out to them we pray Lord that you will open their eyes that they would absolutely refuse to participate in terrorism may they even it would be a great Jeopardy of their life a risk but would you strengthen them to stand against tamas and Hezbollah to say this is not our fight I pray for the safe Escape of those who need to be out I heard this morning from someone that we trust in the land that reports were coming in that Hamas was stealing car keys from Palestinians who wanted to flee the corridor of Hope hoping that the casualties would be higher and that more people would hate Israel my heart goes out to those [Music] people you told us once Lord as we prayed for the Arab people that you would show up and we had testimonies come in in multiple from multiple places that you were showing up in homes God revealing yourself to Arab people and they were calling you to be the god of heaven and finding Mercy in your presence do it again Lord yes [Music] Lord we thank you for election we thank you that not one in your forn knowledge will be lost Lord may we not be bogged down by the demonic spirits that would desire to stir hatred in our hearts toward the Jewish people in the land of Israel melt us together today let us see the responsibility Lord I want to thank you for a prophet who believed with all of his heart that the Modern Nation of Israel was a fulfillment of scripture one who told us watch watch watch watch if you want to know what God is about to do in the church watch the Jew he said so today Lord our eyes and our hearts are turned toward Israel and toward the Jewish people may you do everything that you promised and give them victory in this trying hour with his little loss of innocent life Liv as possible Lord it Grieves us to think that one mother on either side of this conflict would lose a child my heart breaks I can't stand the thought but Lord you know you know more than we know we're just little peons here trying to figure it out but you're a God who saw it from before the foundation of the world I don't know how to bring the promises of God to pass for Israel but you do you're the one who made them you're the Covenant keeping God I bless your name I bless your name I bless your name Yahweh I bless you I bless you Jesus Spirit of the Living God thank you for Angels Lord I sat with gersan Solomon a living witness of the of the liberation of the city of Jerusalem we heard him tell the story with his own mouth that there were men who appeared that day on the Temple Mount dressed in Robes of desert tan and white and walked among the soldiers assisting them in liberation in the Temple Mount he saw them with his eye and testified that the enemy ran so quickly away they ran out of their sandals when they fighting was over and when they wanted to thank this unknown host they couldn't find them anywhere when the tank ran over gersan Solomon crushing his legs and leaving him forever crippled he was left there to die but a man dressed in radiant white he testified to us came and picked him up and carried him back to his comrades and when they tried to find him to thank him he was gone Lord that's what we need right now we call for Angelic intervention in the land of Israel rise up host of the Lord let the jealousy of God be Vindicated in that land he's jealous for his people he's jealous for that land may this be the birthing of a Revival among the Arab people God you're not willing that any should perish it's your desire the scripture told us this morning that wicked men would turn from their Wicked Ways and not have to pay with their own blood I trust you we as a body trust you show us what to do show us what to do wake us up in the night hour when somebody needs help Lord let us let one of us catch the prayer assignment it's easy to go about our regular lives forgetting that the promises of God seem to be up for grabs make us mindful we don't want to be Fanatics we want to be mindful in a church world who wants to see the Jews punished let this little bride stand up on her behalf and cry out for her help because one day we're going to sit together Jew and Gentile and worship Jesus Christ it matters not I've had many Jews say to me you believe he has come the first time and will come the second time and we believe he's coming the first time and I've said to them many many times but the thing for you to know is he is one in the same bethlehem's babe is the same God who shows up on the Mount of Olives and reveals himself to the Jewish Brethren he's the same Messiah same savior you're the same Lord thank you for releasing this assignment to us may we be faithful come and lead us in worship son he became sin who knew no sin that we might become his rightousness he humbled himself and carried the cross love so amazing [Music] oh love so [Music] amazing Jesus Messiah the name above all Nam oh Blessed Redeemer [Applause] [Music] Immanuel Jesus the rescue for siners the ransome
