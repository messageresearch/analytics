Christ is the anointing and I thank God to have found a church where Christ is so welcome he's so in control amen and he receives all the honor and the glory and we thank God for that um I'm from South Africa and um the first time I came to America was in 200 19 me and my wife we came with some friends and we went through some of the places in America and if you are from South Africa you can easily pick up a racist Spirit if you're from South Africa within seconds you can pick it up but I'm telling you in 2019 when we came through America I could I could pick up uh a racism spirit and I think it was the same year or the year after that that that big thing happened in America where they killed that guy the policeman and what has happened there I can't breathe and whatever happened there um you know what but this is my second visit to America and I didn't feel one for one moment when Benjamin picked us up brother Benjamin picked us up we just felt the Holy Spirit a clean Spirit you know that's what that's what brother Brandon produced and that's the inheritance of the Bride to have the Supernatural and the spirit of God that sweet kind Dove the nature of Ave and a lamb but explained it to us we have no excuse but to carry that character on us and I'm telling you not one time did I feel that Spirit or any Spirit here I just felt the holy spirit in this place and I want I

Nation there's different cultures there Indians Apaches you find everything there Zulu suu colard everything everything is right there in South Africa so we have a variety of food so we can taste we we are one of the best people to can that can compliment a SEF and I'm telling you this sister if you in the message if you want a wife you need to come to New Revival service they got the best I mean the best food that I've tasted here and not only for a bonus not only can sisters cook good but for a bonus they can sing and shout and jump and their Holy Ghost filled that's a bonus my I have a wife like that I have a wife like that and I love my African baby amen I just love her amen she can make food she can jump and salt and she have the Holy Ghost the young Brothers must be a fool to not pray and look and get the sister that can cook that know how to worship the Lord and that have the Holy Ghost and know how to obey and be obedient to their husbands I've seen it here and I just want to compliment each and every one of you I want to tell the young sisters amen God will give you the best of the best husbands because you are in the best of the best churches amen may God send Angel husbands to you and may you receive a blessing from the Lord you just keep on serving God and you just keep on singing and praising God Amen don't look for a husband look to Jesus and I'm telling you he will give you your heart's desire is that right praise the name of the Lord so I just wanted to also compliment the sisters and before I came up here I asked my wife he said okay if I say to the sisters um you know they are good cooks and things like that because I need to know if I'm out of order or in order I just wanted to compliment them amen or I I'm not here with another Spirit I'm telling you I love my wife I don't travel without her I don't travel without her amen that God calls the man and his wife amen praise God and we need to love a holy clean life and wherever I go I my best I try to take her with me everywhere I go and if she cannot go with me I take my daughters my sons with me if they cannot go me with me I take a deacon a Elder with their wives with me amen because we want to we want to keep the name of Jesus holy is it right praise the name of the Lord so I just want to thank you all uh can a sister just put up that scripture I'm just going to for two minutes just read the scripture there in John chapter 4 because this camp meeting was inspired by John chapter 4 you can put up verse 23 and verse 4 if it's okay verse 23 and verse 24 amen I just want to show you something there praise God um and we are so excited Amen to worship him because what happened here in John chapter 4 uh um is that Jesus is dealing here with a woman that have a water problem she had five husbands so I I hope you understand what I'm talking about she had a water problem she went from one man to another man she wanted to be satisfied she was looking for the Hest of satisfaction and she couldn't find it from no man and that woman was in that condition one day the Lord sold me in the spirit the reason she was in that condition everybody rebuked that woman for a condition but the Lord show me one time that that woman was in that condition because in her City Samaria had had had weak men and because of weak men he was in that condition so don't only just down the the the woman of at the well amen praise God because the men wasn't strong in that City that's why she could run in the city and say I found a man and you cannot be a man unless you've met the man Jesus Christ you will never know how to love a woman if you don't know Jesus because God is love if you're looking for a nice romantic story first make contact with Jesus Christ when we were in the world we thought we know what love is we used words to express love we know nothing about love let me tell you this world out here they know nothing about love if you want to know what love is God is love oh and she found love she found love now watch here so Jesus had to deal with this woman she had water problem she had a water problem and then Jesus moved from the he dealt with her with the hter problem and from the hter problem he went over to the worship problem I hope you see it this woman had the heart problem and Jesus told her the Hest of satisfaction is the word of God it's the spirit of the Lord and then he had to move over all of a sudden they moved to away from the h problem and they were talking about the worship problem because there was a worship problem as well and I believe even in the message we have a worship [Applause] problem so Jesus was in a debate with this woman about the ho problem and he was in a debate with her about worship ohoo Lord if you want a debate of worship I'm telling you you're going to deal with Jesus Christ because he wants to be worshiped and he wants you to worship Him in spirit and in [Applause] truth a debate and this woman amen was seeking for water but Jesus was seeking for worship just give me two minutes I'm going I won't be long amen she was she was thirsting for water but according to this scripture the father seeketh such worshippers so the father was thirsty for worship oh God is thirsty for your worship he wants to be [Music] worshiped and he dealt with this woman watch here he dealt with this woman amen and I want you to see this so we changed from a water problem to a worship problem Our God don't receive any worship not just any type of worship amen I want you to see that he's not satisfied with any type of a worship according to the scripture he wants to be worship sh in spirit and in truth and the father seeketh such to worship him ohoo Lord I think he's seeking right now in the message of the hour he's seeking for such worshippers that can worship Him in spirit and in truth now listen there's a chosen place of worship but there's also a chosen way of worship I hope you see it there's a chosen place of worship brother B told us but there's also a chosen way of worship because this woman thought she said the Jews worship there and we worship here and Jesus changed it from where to worship and he changed it to How To Worship so you can be in the message you can be in the right chosen place of worship but it doesn't mean you have the chosen way of worship because you need to worship sh him in spirit and in truth for we seek such worshippers amen you can be in the right place of worship but are you worshiping him the right way very important it's very important so first he had to deal with the hots of satisfaction and then he dealt with the worship that brings sa satisfaction amen this is the worship that satisfy God is to worship Him in spirit and in truth I hope you see it but just quickly I want to say this God is a god of numbers because watch here in John chapter 4 why is this in John chapter 4 because this woman I want you to see this now this woman had five husbands five men and the one you have now the sixth one I want you to see it now six is a fallen number it's a number of a wrong worship system but here the seventh Man Came Jesus Christ and he showed her how to worship I hope you see it amen I hope you see it and that's why God sent William brandham the seven Angel messenger Amen to come and to show us how to worship God in spirit and in truth is that right Jesus introduced this woman to how to worship God in spirit and in truth and here God s and Jesus was the seventh man and here Jesus amen William brandham a son of men for our day came and turned our hearts back to the Pentecostal Faith to serve God and to worship God in spirit and in truth now listen not just in word not just in truth but in spirit of Truth and brother preach Spirit of truth even but I want you to see this if I may quickly I want you to see the number four the coming of the Lord is quickly in number four I want you to see this the God gave us the Rapture numbers and the Mysteries and secrets brother Brenham gave it to us it's in the message of the hour rapturing faith I believe is in the message now watch here I want you to see number four the coming of the Lord amen Malachi 4 you can see the coming of the Lord in number four amen you can see the coming of the Lord says Revelation chapter 4 is the rapture the Fourth Man In The Fire changed their bodies body chains on the fourth day he resurrected Lazarus so you can see the Rapture the body chains the resurrection under number four and it's also under number seven because the seven Angel brings rapturing Faith you need seven virtues for the Rapture the Rapture and the coming of the Lord is the seven seal the seven Thunders gives you rapturing Faith but I'm going to do something here I'm going to put four and seven together because it's so perfect I want you to see this why amen this woman in in in John chapter 4 the seventh man met her why in John chapter 4 and I want you to see number four and seven prophetically goes together right through the Bible I'm just going to give two or three but you can go right through the Bible I want you to see this watch you now brother Brenham was Malachi 4 but he was also the seventh angel can you see four and seven together there brother Brenham is amen the seventh angel anointed by the fourth living creatures anointing and anointing of an eagle four and seven together oh I hope you see it I hope you see it I hope you see it watch here amen brother Bram started his ministry in 1947 4 and7 there's it again and you can go right through the word of God and see 4 and 7 together amen the seven Church age after the seven Church AGS they go into the Rapture which is revelation 4 there's 4 and seven again where do you find brother Brenham under the fourth seal and under the seventh seal the seven Angel is under the for seal woo Anointed with that eagle anointing I want you to see that this is very important and that's why in The Book of Daniel when they turn the fire seven times warmer the Fourth Man Step Into the Fire there's four and seven together in Genesis 1:14 God created the moon the sun and the Stars that's his first Bible that's his Redemption plan but right there do you know what day he created the sun moon and stars on the fourth day so where did he put the Seven Stars in the fourth day so there's four and seven again together so every time if you looking for the Rapture 4 and seven goes together god is perfect in his numerology and that's why in John chapter 4 the seventh man came into a life and that's a type of the end time that's a type of the son of the son of men and brother bham typed that woman uh uh to the Bride of Jesus Christ he said she was in that condition in a backsliding condition amen after six Church ages she was still in a backsliding condition but then the word for her day came the seven man came I Know a Man can turn on the light and brother benam said there was a seat a predestination inside of her and he HED that seed and that seed quickened amen and it came to life I just want to give you one quote amen the queen of siba brother bham says Billy he says Billy Graham is a is a good preacher he says Billy Graham is a word preacher he says Billy Graham amen Billy Graham amen they rally around the [Music] word brother says they rally around the word and

and balance I'm grateful for it now I have uh quite struggled to know where to start today I thought I was going one place and by the way the prayer about the biscuit that was for me because I told my wife the biscuit was dry but my biscuit was warmed up a second time with only cheese and it became dry it's not because my wife makes a dry biscuit biscuit that those see I got the I got the trial run two days before and they're good biscuits I know that that's right up I I don't have to well I I I went into the office and they asked me if I slept and I Saidi slept in my office chair all night' what sleep I got and they said it had to be because you said your wife's biscuit was dry it was not her choice that I spent the night in that office chair I would like to read scripture this morning from Joel chapter 1 Joel chapter 2 and Acts chapter 2 and I would like to try to do it in Rapid succession they have my scriptures and I'm just going to read them so that you don't have to stand for a long time Joel 1:1 the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pul hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land has this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust had left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left at the caterpillar eaten awake ye drunkards and weep and how all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion hallah verse 70th laid my Vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white Joel chap 2 verse1 blow ye the trumpet in Zion and sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord come cometh for it is not ey at hand Joel 2: 23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit Acts 2 verse4 but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Juda and all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose for it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days sayeth the Lord that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles OST Les men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost verse 39 for This Promise is unto you yes and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call can you give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise [Music] Hallelujah Lord we bless you for all that has been done in this camp meeting and up to this point in this service now would you just come and just let your heavy anointing rest upon us all of the tiredness of our body may we be able to press through it Lord and hear what you would have to say to us in this hour for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen amen you may be seated glory be to hallelujah hallelujah thank you thank you hallelujah praise God now we a lot of us that are sitting here have been under the sound of the word for many many years I if you don't already know it I am the son of a pastor who has preached this message now since 1970 and I am blessed man to be able to report to you of of of the 10 siblings the 10 of us children that my parents have every one of them are in message churches of every variety I thank God for that as brother was preaching last night after uh God started put putting us here and we got here and and God would use us in different ways uh we have been in pulpits where we were told we don't need that here literally told we don't need that here what a shame and and and I remember a prophetic word that I gave in a church to a young man that that uh that I was told that just pray for the people we don't need that here and and so we went on years and never heard anything and about uh three or four years ago the man the young man came to me after almost 20 years and said the word that you gave to me I thought it was crazy and for 15 years I said I don't know if it's true or not but after 15 years the word that the Lord spoke over him came to pass because the word of the Lord standeth sure it's not the boast of men it's not the boast of what we are it's just to say God keeps his word he doesn't let any of it go back to him null and void without being effective he lets it accomplish what he wants it to accomplish now when God gave this message to us in the 50s and 60s God brought a restoration message if it was a message of restoration to the people because there had been uh this bug that was trying to eat off what God had given to the people and we find that through the years there were many things that were taken away from the people they they were they were uh in as it started out with the Apostle Paul and he well with Peter really at the day of Pentecost the Peter began to prophesy to them or repeat the prophecy of what Joel had prophesied which we read just a moment ago that there was coming a time when there was going to be a restoration for the people the people had become lacks they had become lazy and the Bible said for Joel prophesied and he said you tell your children come on and let your children tell their children and let their children tell another generation the problem is somewhere along the way the telling got watered down the telling got less and less and less and less until the people were satisfied with dead dry religion and they just went and just had just the Liturgy they just had the speaking and and they they would go out and the under the law they had all of the the things that they were supposed to do and many of them could keep the law as much as was in their power they could do the works but that sacrifice that they were required to bring could never take away the guilt of what was on them but God was speaking to a future generation that he was going to pour out his Spirit on All Flesh and God kept his word on the day of Pentecost when Peter and all of those that were in the upper room God was there came down upon them and they began to receive these clothing tongues of fire yes sir that's right now as many that were here last night didn't know what to do with what was on them yes those people were in the same condition on the day of Pentecost because they were used to going to synagogue they were used to hearing the word of the Lord but they were not used to something happen that caused them to react the way they did on the P day of Pentecost and there are some that received last night that were not used to receiving what they received and I as a Believer receive received my Pentecost I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the same time in the same week as our brother did in 1988 and I know that I receive the Holy Ghost but I tell you there was a period of time where that if times got Tough Enough the devil tried to talk me out and you go through this wishy-washy stuff did I or didn't I did I or didn't I and see I'm I've been around this message for a long time and I've I've heard the quotes and that one about the peas on the dry cow hi High I've heard that until that I decided I didn't need to speak with tongues so many have come on but most recently I've done some research and I realize that that the prophet we nearly every time that he brought that that particular phrase into his preaching was not talking about the tongues on the people that were true believers most of the time he was talking about those that were not living a life that was worthy of the Gospel but still talking in tongues they would do all the things of the world come to church on Sunday and and he said it just sounded like ratatatat all the time and when they were speaking in tongues and but growing up I would hear that phrase and I don't fault anybody because you know it's in the hearer's uh problem there but you you get to hearing that and you form an opinion and our opinions affect our lives I don't care what your opinion is or what that opinion concerns you can we could just talk about something as simple as as a soft drink and if you have an opinion that coke is better than Pepsi as I was talking to brother joose the other night we don't allow Pepsi around here I don't drink Coke I don't drink Pepsi I don't care but we have opinions especially if we drink it I prefer sweet tea I have an opinion about sweet tea but we form opinions about things even when we come to the the house of God we form an opinion about the worship leader the piano player the drum player the the guitar player the preacher we form opinions and we form op opinions about people's children we form all these opinions about things and then when the word of God comes because we're so set on making our opinions known then we give an opinion about that too rather than letting the word sink down into us and going back to this to lay it in the pages of this to say Lord does what I'm hearing I can't even say what he's saying what I'm hearing does it come into the pages of this book that's it that's right and so I lay the blame right here but through the course of years and seeing God move on different people and then when I moved here in the middle 90s and I began to see how that the the the the people that had allowed that gifting of tongues to come upon them how that they were able to press through and pray in the spirit now again as brother Shel was saying last night you can pray in the spirit in English and you can pray in the spirit in another language the tongue of of Angels the tongue from heaven and you speak in another language and you get a hold of God in such a way until that you are speaking mysteries in the spirit and we don't know anything of what's Happening most of the time but God is God by yielding to the spirit we could be dispatching Angels here and there by the spirit of God not because we think we're anybody but because we got in the spirit so I began to watch this and see this and I was a part of the ministry team in 96 and 97 and and realizing that I could be more effective if I could just break out but I had to fight my way through yes yes this is but I remember I was too I remember that night and in March of 1998 10 years 10 years from the time I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost till the time that God allowed me to break through in that other language now my experience was I started hearing it in my head and I didn't know what to do with it so I went to somebody more experienced than I and I said what do I do with it and he said well my advice to you would be when you're in your private prayer time whatever you hear speak it out loudly so that's exactly what I did and it went on for just a couple of days because I think we went to a supper uh together on a Friday maybe just to discuss some Ministry things and that's when I got the advice and so by Sunday night I'm already letting the spirit of God come out of my mouth see I that's the advice I would give to some of you when you're under the anointing of God standing up around here it probably isn't going to happen if you don't open your mouth I know that's right if you clamp your lips together and clench your teeth together it probably isn't going to come out of your mouth but if you let something come out of your mouth and you let the spirit continue to work through you there'll come a gusher because of out of men's bellies it's flowing the rivers of Living Water so through the years as I have watched and I have traveled and I have gone different places and unfortunately I have seen many of our churches around what we call the message I have seen them in Decline and we have we have just continued to do what God called us to do here we don't try to put it on nobody else we just try to be faithful with what God has called us to and I have seen as people have not repeated as they have not told their children and their children of course now have a watered down idea and that's what they pass on to their children and their children because that they're seeing less and less of the move the Holy Ghost they water it down just a little bit more to tell their children and then the church ends up in a backsliding condition because the spirit of God isn't moving but God said I will restore sayth the Lord hallelujah now this is what I've come to a conclusion of a couple of weeks ago we need a restoration of the restoration brother Brandon preached the message in 1962 the restoration of the brid tree where he talked about this bug that morphed from one place to another place to the another it was the same bug all along and I'm just going to give you a short version of what he preached there in 1962 because he said the Palmer worm the first stage of that bug and the first thing it ate off was the word word and he said it was the fruit the word word and then he said the fruit the nine fruits of the spirit with the nine spiritual gifts and so that Palmer worm tried to eat off brother brotherly love it tried to eat off faith it tried to eat off Joy the people you just make too much noise and that's what the Palmer worm did it came as that bug to try to take away the fruit of the spirit that was in the people the next thing that it did the it morphed into the Locust and then it the the started chewing on the leaves and he called that Divine fellowship or the coolness and then see through the years preachers especially get this idea you either do it my way or you get [Music] out I'm the ultimate Authority in this house by as a pastor of a certain place and so you do it my way or you get out and everybody again has opinion the pastor has that legal Authority I suppose he has that Authority as the pastor but then that Spirit starts getting on other people and it starts spreading out and that's what the bug did it started out with one leaf and then another leaf and then it gets bigger and bigger and it goes out to all the branches until there's no leaves left there's no coolness of the Holy Spirit the Divine love to be able to love on one another and prevent a pre present a coolness when the people come [Music] in one of his statements was sit down under this tree and let the winds from Heaven go to blow in a little bit the next stage of that bug was a caner worm and he called that the religion the covering the doctrine the lifeline and I just want to tell you today Doctrine matters the word of God matters what you believe matters it matters what you believe that is why you hear us repeating over and over and over again that God is not three God is one that is why you hear us repeating you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you need to repent first and then be baptized these are fun fundamental truths that are supposed to be a part of our life because they're scripture well what about Matthew 28:19 when you get a revelation of who God is you will realize that Matthew 28:19 and acts 238 are one and the same because all that God was he just decided that he couldn't appear to men in a spirit form so he took on a body the body of Flesh and he came to the Earth as Jesus Christ and when he was finished all the work on the earth then he went back to the right hand of power and he sent back his very own life back to the believer on the day of Pentecost he sent his own life not another one his life and so you are an extension of him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are an extension of the Lord Jesus Christ in the earth he that physical body went back to Papa but the Holy Spirit came down for you he came down to indwell you so that you could be all that people would see of Jesus Christ on the earth don't discount your Holy Ghost don't you discount what God has done for you don't you back up one iota for the devil but you allow the Lord Jesus to be alive and alert and active in your life accomplishing what he has come to do because he desires to make you so full of the Holy Ghost so that you don't know what to do with [Applause] yourself so he talks about the religion the covering and he said it gets them all dignified then strips he gets them all dignified and then he strips them of their religious covering on now and they make up their own ideas and they got stripped of their Pentecostal experience God never left anything for relics or tokens he sent the Holy Ghost something alive and it can never be destroyed so then the fourth stage of this bug was the caterpillar and he called that part of it the denomination and he said that it sucks out the very life the spirit out of the people sucks the very life out of the people and God planted this tree this spiritual tree he planted it for it to Bear spiritual fruit he planted it for it to Bear Supernatural fruit now I would like to say that when brother brandham preached this in 1962 he was dealing with one set of problems right so true he was dealing with a spirit of denominationalism that had crept into the church I mean isusa Street was just 50 to 60 years behind them at the time and where that God had poured out himself on Aza Street and all across the United States and even in other countries God had poured himself out in a marvelous way and people experience the Holy Ghost but because that the tishbite anointing had not yet been released in the Earth Earth people began to grasp what is right and what is wrong tell us the Holy Ghost had fallen the people were speaking in tongues and they could see that it happened in the book of Acts and that it was still promised to the people in the last day yet while they were enjoying the presence of God and it got larger and larger man started putting his own own ideas on it and started putting parameters around it and started denominational liing it in such a way and then it started dividing Brethren come on and as it started dividing Brethren and you had the Trinity denominations and you had the Oneness denominations and you had all in between and maybe more I don't know denominations and the denominational Spirit was around all of that God had did done in 1906 and people began to forget what God had done in 1906 because they were more concerned about building their own Ministry or their own [Music] denomination brother brandham was dealing with that situation in the 50s and 60s and he realized that the enemy had come in and he had tried to he and and had succeeded in eating away at the fruit and the leaves and the bark until it got into the very life and when that when that bug got into the life the tree died brother random came with that message from the scripture but I will restore sayith the Lord and oh how the people rejoiced in the 50s and the 60s when they heard that message of restoration now here is what I would say because that we have had a restoration message people have been satisfied to come to church hear a sweet sermon and go back out and they have forgotten because somebody forgot to pass the message down and when they forgot to tell their children some of those children that forgot to get told right became preachers and then some of those children that never got told by their parents that became preachers started talking a twisted Doctrine a twisted version of what really should be happening we're talking from Pentecost to the 50s and the 60s and as the preachers had not been told by their parents they now become parents and they become preachers and they have children and they start telling a a distorted version of what really should be going on on in the house of the Living God then we come with a watered down gospel and the enemy has been satisfied to get into that Pentecostal experience and start chewing at the at the bark and the leaves and the fruit and then into the very life again and we heard a message that message said I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah now it was to the generation in the 50s and 60s but somewhere in that group of people in the 50s and 60s after brother brandham left the scene we had a repeat we had a repeat of of a papa who came out of a Baptist Church L and recognized that there was a message for the hour that never had a new birth that's it that's it that's right and a Methodist that come out of a Methodist Church and recognize the word for their day but it was all it was to them was word without spirit and when they became a preacher or became a pastor and they started wanting to preach the truth of the end time they had truth but for whatever reason they wanted to deliver it with their Methodist way of delivering it and their message church was a Methodist Church or a Baptist Church or even an Episcopalian Church and they all had their ideas and they passed their ideas down to their children rather than giving them Joel's prophecy and saying God is going to pour out his Spirit on All Flesh your young men are going to see Visions your old men are going to dream dreams and I'm going to pour out my spirit on All Flesh it's the word it's the word it's the word it's the word it's the word it's the word now I'm just going to tell you let you misunderstand me I know you have to have the word when all all of your emotion is gone and you go out and face the world and that emotion that you felt here last night is it's a distant fond memory and you're facing the devil you're not going to be able to tell the devil I had a chill go up my spine on Saturday night get out of my way none of that's going to work that's why you have to be established in the word of God now brother got up here just before I did and he brought back to our attention the woman at the well and when Jesus spoke to her he said I am looking for true worshippers and those worshippers must worship me only in word Spirit first those worshippers must worship me only with Spirit no if you can Envision on the top of this Pulpit today one of those old timey balances and you get the word and the spirit on that balance you're going to find out that you come into Perfect Balance when you get the word and the spirit when you get spirit and Truth we find that the scripture says Thy word is truth we get the word and the spirit together and we get them in balance and something's going to happen so preacher didn't tell his children and he wonders why his children have gone to the world righta my heart cries because we are in an hour where we see people leaving this Truth for one reason or another over the silliest reasons as far as I'm concerned but when they get gone they start bashing everything and I wonder what are you standing on what are you even standing on but I think and there's at least two of them that when their parent died as soon as their parent died they left this truth okay Papa Mama I believe you had a real true experience with the Lord how come why is it that but the Next Generation decided that this was not truth I don't know the only thing that I can come up with is because the previous generation didn't tell the Next Generation or what they told them was watered [Music] down so then you get a noisy Church like this where that we speak in tongues listen I can take you to a I can take you to the beginning of a sermon where brother brandham sent his tape boys as he called them specifically because he wanted them to record what he called the chance of the spirit chance of the and it was it was Raising in here last night and it was earlier in the week there was one time in worship earlier this week I could hear that sound raising there was something in the spirit that was happening because nobody was trying to make their voice heard above somebody else and you could not distinguish between crying or shouting or speaking in tongues or speaking in English but there was a crescendo of the holy spirit that lifted up in here the rhythms of the spirit and there is a section of tape that you can go in here at this second I don't remember where it's at but I can find it for you where that brother brandham wanted it on recording because he said it settled him whatever your sound you don't have to speak in tongues as much as I do or as much as he does or anybody else does but let your sound come out it may just be a hum but if we could ever get in the right atmosphere together together if one by himself can put a thousand to flight and then you get a second one adding their voice and a third one and a fourth one and a fifth one and then the whole congreg congregation getting their voices all Blended together and nobody trying to outdo one another but trying to find the pitch the sound the one the the the listen the sound for today may be different than the sound for next week and so when we come together we want to be able to be sensitive to the spirit and if our sound ain't the right sound we want to be flexible and fluid enough until that we're willing to change our voice change our sound change our cartoon whatever it is go up a key go down a key whatever that might be to find the sound of the spirit for the moment because God wants to move every time we come together and he wants to move when you're by yourself so this bug has eaten off it is eaten off it is eaten off the fruit it is eaten it started out by saying well we have the word so the gifts aren't necessary and see this started happen after the man of God left the scene in 1965 because you can go back to hear what he said and he said every one of these nine spiritual gifts should be a part of the local assembly active should be active well brother brandham put them in a back room he said we'll meet 30 minutes before the service I recently asked a church if they had a gift room see here's our problem about the gifts we don't mind somebody having the gift of faith you got a gift of faith please lay your hands on me and if I'm sick in the song service and you have a gift of faith I would rather you didn't wait till the end of the preaching that's right but you see the gift of tongues and interpretation I'm I I as he said last night the biggest problem is control they have been squelched because didn't know how to control it or didn't have the ability to now I'm going to give a disclaimer as a preacher standing here over the years I have had my times of shaking in my shoes to know what to do should I stop it should I let it go and there are sometimes it has to be stopped I believe I believe that was told to us the other night there is a time for all things and absolutely the word has to have preeminence in our midst because when you go outside those doors you're not going to be able to speak in tongues and the to the devil and make him go now you may be able to pray in the spirit yeah that's the best way to for it to happen pray in the spirit and let the Angels come and take care of it but get in the spirit that's the main thing get in the spirit find what is necessary for the moment so the enemy took away these nine spiritual gifts and as he took away these nine spiritual gifts the fruit of the spirit also began to dissipate and then the leaves hello the leaves the coolness see there's there's there's when the Holy Spirit is Among Us and he's working on each one of us and we're yielding to him all that hotheadedness has to leave all that temper and rage all that stuff that gets us so out of sorts all that throwing around of opinion because we want it done oh when the the he that bug came and chewed off the the leaves the coolness and all the coolness begin to left and you could see people's tempers flaring ah this is the way it is everybody put in their own interpretation on what they thought ought to be the order of a service what they thought ought to be the order in the house of God and then then we we find that there were uh men installed as deacons that wanted to thump people over the head if they weren't perfect quiet in the service and they if they got out of hand and started to speak in tongues or they started to get a little happy calm down now the coolness of the Holy Spirit then the Lifeline where you start seeing the doctrine slipping now I would just like to dwell here just a moment because I have Through The Years you start getting attitude I have because people leave out Parts when they when they preach it's the word it's the word it's the word it's the word let's get all the word when God brought restoration all the way through the message brother brandham talked about Luther and he said that Luther brought a message of justification right then he said Wesley came after Luther with a message of sanctification he did not immediately go to the word no he did not he said after Wesley was the restoration of the gifts Pentacost the restoration of the gifts Pentecost over and over and over and then the true word now the problem that I have encountered Through The Years watching all of this is that people were willing to talk about Luther justification they were willing to talk about Wesley and sanctification tell the truth and they even would brief over restoration of the gifts and then the full word as if the full word negated all the rest of it I hope not and I just want to ask the question when you came to the truth of the word of God did you leave behind justification no when you came to the truth of the word did you leave behind sanctification some of them did and the reason you're seeing that some of them have left sanctification is because there's been some parents that didn't tell their children and there's some children that didn't tell their children and their children didn't tell their children and it has become a watered down gospel and we're seeing Babylon creep back into the [Music] church now why would I say all of this when it seems like I'm preaching to the choir right here because friends I want to be sure that I tell my children and I want this message to be so clear when I tell my children that they tell their children and that they can give the message so clear to their children that their children if we should be here would also be told because I don't want my children to start watering down the gospel and I don't want my grandchild I don't want her to hear a watered down gospel and then she starts giving out a watered down version of what is truth that is why I'm not ashamed to say this is my pastor that preaches justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the word because it is all a part of the package that has been given to us in the end time [Applause] it's all part of it and you've got to have your experience with the Lord just the same as I had to have mine and the enemy likes to talk you out of yours like he likes to try to talk me out of mind but there was an experience years ago that he can't talk me out of mine no more I remember a man of God when it happened on that Sunday night that said let it come out and get all you can so the devil can't talk you out of it tomorrow and I'm real thankful that he did because here I stand today the devil hasn't talked me out of it and he's not going to talk me out of it and by God's grace I'm going to help some of you to pray through [Applause] sometimes you'll hear me come and lay my hands on you and say such as I have I give you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if Peter could do it I can do it that man needed healing at that moment and Peter had it inside of him and he goes along and he's shaking his cup the boy man is shaking his cup at the gate beautiful and he says arms arms arms and Peter comes along and Peter says buddy I just don't have none of that but I tell you what I do have such as I have I give you in the name of Jesus Christ arise up and walk and immediately immediately his ankle bones receive strength and he jumped up and he went leaping leaping and shouting and praising [Applause] God and that is why I took Peter's example and I know what the Lord has done for me and some that struggle along the way and they can't seem to get where they want to and I see them going up and I see them coming back down and up and down and I want to say whatever I have whatever I can impart into you whatever I possess in the name of Jesus Christ I give it because I don't want to see you going from Pillar To Post when going in the up and coming back down I want to see you stabilized in the Gospel of Jesus Christ hey I thought y'all were tired now I Glory [Music] Glory this restoration message that has come along for us is because when when Joel prophesied I will restore sayeth the Lord now the bug thought when he ate off the leaves and the fruit and the the bark and got all the way into the core of that tree he thought that tree was dead dead dead we've all been around long enough to see some dead just as a side note I'm so happy that sister Gert Hammond and sister Terry Lawler are here and my mind began to wonder last night oh yes we brother Shelly had mentioned water baptism and how important water baptism was and some of you may not know that my dad pastored sister gird and sister Terry in the early 70s back in Pennsylvania Ohio they live lived in Ohio we lived in Pennsylvania and daddy would go one Thursday night a month to a little house church and they were a part of that my daddy pastored it sister Terry do you remember Sister Ludwig sister Ludwig was a woman that believed truth but she could not get out to go to services and she didn't have the joy of live streaming and I don't remember what her ailment was but I remember even though I was a small child she was in a bed that rocked back and forth for oh my it rocked back and forth and they would stop that bed and dad would come and he would preach to her a little while and he would give her the communion and so forth and she says brother gedle I want to be baptized in a bed that rock polio it rocked back and forth and she says I want to be baptized and Dad wrestled with that over and over not knowing what to do because her husband was not a Believer and and he knew that if he took her out in the water and she ended up deathly sick that he would be held responsible even though sister lwig was the one that wanted to be baptized but I remember he tells the story over and over again he said somehow God worked on that unbelieving husband he took the seats out of a back of a station wagon and he slid her into that St wagon and they took her bed out to a some body of water and I think there were four men that took her out in that body of water and lowered her down in that water and baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when there is a Hungry [Applause] Heart when there's a Hungry Heart God Will Make A Way I believe that there are people people who call on the name of the Lord with sincerity at the last moment of their life and they're never baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they make it but that sister saw through the word of God and she said even though I'm in this condition I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and God made a way for her to be baptized she saw the importance of it God rewarded her faith and I just was thinking about that last night thinking about how God has uh once again put sister Gert and sister Terry under the watchmans with brother Shelly of a brother grey I don't know why God does that full circle but somewhere along the way they got in a position where that somebody talked them a different story somebody tried to give to them a different story but down on the inside of sister Terry so on the inside of sister G there was something on the inside even though the bug had been able to tear down the leaves and it got to the bark and maybe it even gotten into the [Applause] life there was a root there was a root on the [Music] inside there was a root on the inside H I'm convinced today that somewhere along the way that sister Terry pulled sister Rebecca up on her knee just like brother brandham describes the woman at the well somewhere along the way the woman at the well he said that her mama pulled her up on her knee and began to plant the seeds of Destiny in her life and even though sister Terry fell beat and battered there was a root on the inside and it wasn't the root of bitterness that she was instilling into Rebecca it wasn't the root of bitterness that she was instilling into Hannah and into Lily and Joanna and said Sarah and Gary there was something that she was instilling in them and somewhere along the way somewhere along the way sister Terry started hearing I will restore sayith the Lord I will restore sayith the Lord I will restore sayith the Lord and for a while the water had to come by way of stream and God began to get the word to her and to her children and I you may have opinions about how it got there you may have opinions about how she what what she went through that's all your opinion might I remind you what Joel said my great Army which I sent among you God's Great Army all of your trials all of your Beating Downs all that you feel like that the enemy has had access in your life all of the preachers that have failed you through the years all of the deacons that have failed you all of the parents that have failed you all I can say is you have reason to Rejoice today because there was seeds of destiny that were planted in you somewhere along the way and even though that bug came along even though the bug came along and started eating and chewing chewing chewing Che chewing morphing into its next creature the same bug in another stage kept eating and eating and eating and you felt like life wasn't fair you felt like why did I have to go through this my great Army which I why Lord why Lord why Lord why did I have to go through all that I don't know all the reasons all I know is that these fiery trials are working a far greater and better and eternal purpose in you than you can ever dream or imagine but you have reason to Rejoice today because the Lord said I will [Music] restore Joel prophesied it Peter repeated the pro the the prophecy in Acts chap 2 and God fell on them at the day of Pentecost and it continued for some time but somewhere along the way the message again the bug got in there started chewing it off and then in the 50s and 60s God comes back along with a prophet and he once again gives this message of restoration now friends I want you to understand the message does not need to be restored the message the truth of the message does not need to be restored to to us today we have been given it but we need a restoration of the restoration we need to be reminded of the dilution that has come along the way and how that man has put their opinions in and the men have been used as the bugs but don't blame the men don't blame anybody it's like Christ on Calvary the Romans didn't crucify him that was God's idea from the beginning the lamb had to be offered and the blood of bulls and goats could never be enough and then when Jesus comes along and he starts preaching to them you've got to eat my flesh and drink my blood and all those who were standing around they said you you're you know you're teaching a doctor and you sound like a vampire eat your flesh drink your blood we're of Moses and we you know we are the those our fathers ate Mana in the wilderness now the Mana was Supernatural and they ate it under Moses's message they were given the Mana supernaturally every day except for just before the Sabbath they had to get enough for the Friday and Saturday they had to have enough for both days because it wasn't going to come on the Sabbath and if they tried to save any over from one day to the next it rotted it was smelly it was it was no good to eat and God gave them supernaturally that mana and when God instructed Moses to build the Tabernacle he gave him three things to put in the into the behind the holy of holies and Mana was one of those that he told to put in that Ark and we talked on Tuesday night about the rod that budded that was to go there as well and then the tables of stone every bit of that Supernatural and God gave a supernatural message to us but it got watered down one way and then another but it was God's Great Army that he sent along and it was for a reason reasons that I don't know what they were and it seems like it it seems so unfair as you look back over the years and you see people that lived lives of sin because that the generation didn't tell but we've got to leave all of that behind now every day is a good day because God made every day that God makes is a good day as our brother told us the other night every day that God makes is a good day and we can't cry about yesterday but we can embrace the restoration today I'm simply preaching to you the same restoration that he preached in 196 2 the same restoration but you're a whole different set of people than set under that message in 1962 right so true so true whole different group Sister Williams is about to be 87 years old yes she was one that passed it down did that's right and when she saw that bug getting into her family and she saw some restoration she said I got to get there I got to get there am that's how many of you got here because you said I got to get there but God is restoring once again he is restoring once again and seeing bits and pieces yes as I look out yonder seeing bits and pieces but that ain't where God called me to to to to dwell where he called me to live to sit under the sound of although I can glean out there and I can thank God for what is going on out there God has called me right here and what what I'm seeing right here is that we as a body of people we cannot afford to let the Next Generation go without the baptism of the Holy Ghost musicians are coming coming we can't let the Next Generation go without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we cannot let them go where that they think that speaking in tongues is something that is taboo we cannot let them go in the Next Generation that's why we as adults as parents we've got to be tongue talkers come on I am determined when I hold that grandbaby of mine and I'm up here praying I don't want her to be scared when she hears Grandpa praying in tongues I don't want her to be scared when she hears a groan come out of me I don't want her to be scared of that I want her to embrace it with everything that's on the inside of her when charity Grace has children I want to be the same way with her children because I don't want them to be [Applause] afraid I don't want your children to be afraid when I get loud and maybe I scrunch up my face and I start praying in tongues or I grown in the spirit I don't want your children to be afraid and start crying because they're afraid no you get them in this atmosphere every chance you get you get them in this atmosphere you help to create this atmosphere you help them to understand that praise and worship is important that they're voice is important that they need to join with ours that they're clapping their hands and raising their hands is important and they're dancing and they're stomping it's important it's a part of this restoration message that has been given to us we're passing it down to our children all of the nine spiritual gifts part of it it's right here in this assembly I call it forth today in whatever's inside of me I call it forth out of you the nine spiritual gifts let's stand together I what if you feel something inside of you glory glory use us Lord me say one more thing we have been beat and we have been battered because we say we hear this thought it's not about the emotion and I want to reiterate to you it is not about the emotion but I would like to remind you of a few things as I look back over this message of truth I want to remind you of a story where there were two ladies that went across a platform once and they were pronounced healed both of them those two ladies happen to be neighbors and when they went home neither one of them felt healed right but there was something on the inside of them that they believe the word of a prophet and they just kept saying I'm Healed I'm Healed and brother brandham describes it this way one day the one lady there was a coolness that came over her now may I ask what is coolness it seems to me that coolness is an emotion it's a feeling of some sort and that feeling preceded the [Music] angel might I remind you of many times when he was in the prayer line and he said to people you're sensing that warm feeling you're sensing that strange feeling HT it won't hurt you that's just the angel of the Lord the feeling preceded the angel so don't be afraid of feelings you can't live by them but when the feeling comes why don't you say I receive you whatever messenger you're sending Lord I receive it whatever you want to do with me I receive it let the Holy Ghost come down on me so let the presence of the Lord come down on you today as we begin to worship let his presence come down on you you're a people that have set under the sound of the word many of you for 20 30 40 50 60 years you've sat under the sound of the the revealed word and you're of no shortage of the word of God there are many of you that before you got here you were beaten battered down and you were not allowed to express the feelings that you had on the inside but I want you to be able to express those feelings and today once again I want to tell you whatever you feel inside of you if the Lord has been dealing with you about a specific gift perhaps the gift of faith or the gift gift of of discerning of spirits we all need that one I'll take all nine of them as a matter of fact I'll take any of them I'll take any of them but if you feel it working in you say yes Lord yes Lord I am a part of a body that allows the nine spiritual gifts and we do all things decently and in order and we know that the word has preeminence in this house and we know that there are giftings in this place that that help to keep me in divine order and we want divine order in the house but we're not going to quench anything that the spirit of the Lord wants to do let him hover over you today let him hover over you as you begin to Worship the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory see that you are drawing a line in the s and I want to be standing on your side Lord holding your hand so let your kingom come let

moving closer to the gulf it's very serious it's not because of Hamas it's not because of Hezbollah it's because of Iran Iran is funding the terrorist have been for for many many years and now they are adopting tactics from Isis and they have murdered and raped women and children and they're reporting it in our news that's never been a part of the Palestinian agenda but they're adopting from Isis and other former terrorist groups and underground terrorist groups some of you have seen the footage of women bleeding women being pushed into cars and taken hostage why do you always talk about Israel why do you always talk about the Jews so much why do you talk about Hebrews so much why do you have a teras scroll and silver trumpets and chofar because of this this is a book that we showed the church last Sunday and it's full of quotations where brother brandham tells us watch the Jews watch Israel watch Jerusalem he said it's God's time piece he said if you want to know what God's about to do in the church watch Israel watch the Jews so I want Nathan to hold up this Israeli [Music] flag and I want I want us to pray for the nation of Israel God said I will bless them who bless her and I will curse them who curse her brother brandham said that was God's ins sign there are people there are articles there are speakers who see the Magan David the Star of David and they call it a pagan and an occultic symbol churches denounce it brother brandham said when they restored that flag they were fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy that I will give an eternal ins sign e NS i g n a signia so don't you buy in to Google you hear what the Lord has said amen he has let that be established to remind us of our responsibility the messenger told us that as the Jews have given us the gospel we have a commission however God would use any of us to take it all the way back to themen today we can pray yes what we do tomorrow God will have to lead but today there's a way that we can take the gospel to them we can pray are you with me let's lift up our voices I don't have one let's lift up our voices right right now and pray for the Jewish people and pray for the nation of Israel pray for
