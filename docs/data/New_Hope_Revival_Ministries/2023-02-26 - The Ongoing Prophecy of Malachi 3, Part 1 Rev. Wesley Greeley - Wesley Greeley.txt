so glad that you're in the house of the Lord with us Thomas and Sarah it's nice to see you too today pray that God will work in your lives while you're here and touch you as he only can glad to see Solomon and Zion again today they were with us on Tuesday night but we're glad they could be with us here today as well brother Shelley asked me to pass on to you things are a bit uncertain and so we're given right now uh most likely there'll be a graveside service on Wednesday or Thursday morning for sister Jane Shelley if so brother Shelley will be at church on Tuesday night and if the funeral home can't work with them then they'll do Saturday morning and brother Shelley will be here next Sunday this all depends on the funeral home and so perhaps you'll keep those tentative plans in your mind we're just believing the Lord to work his Divine will and purpose concerning that we just want to hold his brother Shelley's family up to the Lord I'm glad that his family could be with him all of them together this weekend as he received that news and uh that he the the family could gather around him and and bring Comfort to him they bring Comfort to each other by the hand of the Lord I'm glad to see you in the house of the Lord and I so appreciate you pressing in and we want to look to the word today as as anybody since Tuesday night has anybody been doing some transplanting some tree moving I would like to read today from Malachi chapter 3. starting with verse one please behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like a fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord and offering in righteousness then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing unto the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years and I will come near to you to judgment and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers against the adulterers against the false swearers against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the Widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the Lord of hosts for I am the Lord I change not therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed I'm going to let you have your seats uh you've been standing a long time today we're going to continue reading in verse 7 even from the days of your father's you are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you saith the Lord of hosts but you have said wherein shall we return will a man rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein if we robbed thee answer in tithe and in offerings you're cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithe into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast our fruit before the time of the field in the field saith the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delightsome land saith the Lord of hosts he continues your words have been Stout against me saith the Lord yet you say what have we spoken so much against thee you have said it is vain to serve God and what profit is it that we've kept his ordinance and we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts and now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt God or even delivered and they that feared the Lord spake often spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man's Spirit his own son that serveth him then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not now there's a whole lot in this chapter of Malachi 3. and I would like to do a little bit of dissecting today and and talk about a variety of things including continuing where we were at on Tuesday night because the thought processes that we have we can have them either Sanctified or non-sanctified and this Malachi 3 is what we would call an ongoing prophecy it was for a day passed it's probably for a day future but there's so many things in here that it is for uh and now today prophetic word for us personally and the Lord wants to give us of his word day by day he doesn't want us to wait until we just come into the house of the Lord and hear a preacher preaching it he wants us to feed on his word every day uh he wants us to to read a word and the enemy would try to uh somehow Force us into a position where we've got to read a whole chapter or more every day when if we could get a one verse just one verse and chew on it all day long just let it ruminate let it be in our thoughts age all day long because the enemy is pressing in on every side trying to force his thoughts into our mind but the scripture says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and we cannot have the mind of Christ all the while feeding on the things of this world we're not going to get the proper nutrients that we need in our mind in our thought processes by feeding on the things of the world does that mean that we never would see a film or something like that no it doesn't mean that it just means that we have got to keep our mind stayed on the Lord we've got to so these the the the thoughts that God gives to us uh he wants us to have the word this word must be the basis for everything that we do our memories are not our enemy our imagination is not our enemy our conscience is not our enemy our affections and reasoning are not our enemy but they have to be Sanctified we've got to put the word to them so that everything that when when we're thinking and allowing these thoughts into our head we've got to have some there there are as brother Shelley taught us some time ago they are there are ants automatic negative thoughts these ants try to get in our brain and we've got to recognize that the thoughts that are coming in is this a thought that I need to keep or is it one that needs to go is this one I need to entertain or is it one that needs to go and so as we were preaching here on Tuesday night about these trees these dendrites and how but God has given us the authority by the Holy Ghost to be able to speak to the sycamine tree to speak to the dendrite to speak to that thought you have no permission to stay here you are not of God you are not going to help me in my journey with the Lord and so I speak to you you go and you go into that sea where that I can't see you no more that body of water down in the depths I don't want to see you anymore and so no after preaching to you on Tuesday night Wednesday morning I got tested and all through the week got tested there were things that happened that that can strike anger in you that can strike frustration in you that can strike all kinds of thought processes and it is I as a preacher along with you perhaps as lay members we must every one of us we have to take control of the control of the thought processes that go through our mind and we've got to say no you don't belong here I may have had just had something that was very frustrating but it is not going to be able to purchase any kind of land in my mind I reject your offer I am counter offering with the word of God and the word of God stand ashore so be transplanted you go elsewhere you're not welcome here so the prophet Malachi here is speaking to God's people and he said he says the Lord is coming and when he shall come who may abide the day of his coming now the word abide foreign the Hebrew word is cool all right so who may seize or contain or measure his coming when he comes see God is immeasurable he is he is not something that can be contained in your little box he cannot be contained in the little square that you try to make for him or that I make for him because I am just being honest with you I like my comfort zone and when my comfort zone is only this big I don't like to go outside of it too much and so I I have to allow the spirit of God to to to lead me and and and I tiptoe maybe outside of my comfort zone and I say ah yeah [Music] and many times in my life I've ended back up in my comfort zone because I don't like the change but it's really it's really a strange thing about change because we really don't like where we are either we say we don't like change but we don't like where we are we don't like the current condition of our life and we really do want some change but when we go outside of the box that we've created for ourself it causes us distress and it causes us all kinds of anxieties and all of these kinds you understand here once you ought to stand here once whether it be to preach the word or whether it be to lead a service or to lead worship or just to stand here with a microphone in your hand to give a testimony it's it it's you want to call talk about anxieties because when you are here as a leader you have a choice to make am I going to bring a service to a screeching halt because I am I am uncomfortable that because we've never been this way before am I going to bring it to a screeching halt or am I going to say okay Holy Ghost you do what you want to it's necessary for me for brother Shelley whoever's leading the sorry it's necessary for me to discern whether the Holy Ghost wants this to go another notch or if he's saying all right that's enough for now let's move on to another song move into the word we have to discern those things but every service God really wants us to step outside of our box because we do not want this place this Revival Center we do not want it to become church as usual we do not want everything to be cut and dry at a certain time it cracks me up some of these churches that we're associated with on their website they give a beginning time and an ending time of service it's very interesting to me how are you going to control the Holy Ghost should he break out we start at 11 o'clock but if the Holy Ghost breaks out and he wants to go till four o'clock we have no stop time we allow him to do what he wants to we allow him to come we know that we as an individual cannot contain him in his completeness in his totality we would explode but we allow him to come and abide in US can't measure it can't seize it because he continues to unfold himself I can't contain it and so sometimes we act a little strange and then we we find ourselves doing things that we didn't know we were capable of doing we we break out in a dance or jump or shout or something that we don't normally do because he is not going to be contained in our box he wants to live in us he wants to abide in us he wants to guide us day by day but he wants us to allow him by his coming to fall on us in whatever measure that he decides to fall on us and then the scripture goes on to say who shall stand when he appears now I can take this two different ways the word stand is a mod which means to stand in support of something so when he comes will I be found standing in support of what he wants to do now again this this is going to require Discerning of spirits this is going to require that I allow the spirit of God to work in me till that I can discern whether this is what he wants to do or whether it's not and so I have got to allow him to work in me and will he come and find me standing in support of whatever he wants to do [Applause] now I can take this another way because we have had prophetic word here where that God was going to come in such a way in such a heavy Glory till that there wouldn't be one that would be standing we would be all on our faces hello so I can take this scripture in another way till that who will be able to stand when he comes now this is where we contrast praise and worship praise is exuberant praise is the loud voice praises the shouting and the speaking in tongues and the jumping up and down and singing with a loud voice but when it transitions into worship it comes a little quieter our voices may still be raised but there's a different there's a there's a shift in the atmosphere when we enter into worship because the worship can lead to the glory of the Lord coming down until then none of us would be able to stand in his presence I want to be found standing on his side when the line is drawn in the sand I want to be found standing on his side but if he should come in all of his glory and drop in this place or in my living room or wherever I may be I want to be willing to fall I want to be willing to bury my nose in the carpet I want to be willing I don't want to be found a grease spot at the end of the day should he come and I find myself resisting him so who can abide and who is going to stand when he appears for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like Fuller soap refiners fire we have been found saying Lord Let the Fire Fall we want the fire to fall refiners fire is mighty hot what I can understand it's between 1600 and 1800 degrees Fahrenheit kind of warm because when a refiner is working with metal and they're trying to meld it down it takes an intense heat in order for them to melt the metal down so that as this metal is all melted the dross the stuff that is not pure metal can come to the top and it can be skimmed off so when God comes as a Refiner's Fire in your life he is coming because he wants to be able to melt you down to nothing till you are total fluid till that you are no longer resisting but you're just fluid [Music] and then he can take his holy ghost word and he can skim off of the top of you all of the dross all of the impurities many times we think that we're in a hot fire and we try to get out of that fire you remember when when those uh he three Hebrew boys they were uh they were told that they had to Bow before the image of the prophet that's what it was an image to the prophet Daniel had gained such notoriety in the Kingdom until that he had such Prestige and such honor with the King that the king decided to make this great golden statue of the Prophet Daniel and the Prophet Daniel he didn't want it he didn't like it but now the king is telling everybody you've got to Bow before this this image you've got to Bow before it and those three Hebrew children they had come from a culture of believing that there was just one that deserved reverence and that was God in heaven the creator of man they came from the same background as Daniel came from they were all friends they were Brethren they were working together and they were in a they were in a culture of paganism and they were doing their best to stay true to God while in the confines of this culture of paganism so are we well we find ourselves being tainted by the culture of paganism rather than as these boys did to draw back you remember when they were taken into this culture of paganism that they were offered some to eat and something to drink and they could have been fearful knowing that they could lose their heads at any moment because they were not in their own country but now they are presenting themselves before that the the gentleman the the eunuch That Was preparing their food and he's telling them this is what the king says that you've got to eat see there's plenty of people trying to tell you that's what you've got to eat you've got to eat all this stuff that the world is trying to present to you but these boys said sir we mean no disrespect but our God has told us that we are not to partake of that stuff and and we're requesting that you would just try it for a certain number of days and give us a different diet and see if if if you at the end of that time period if you would find that we would still be strong enough and our complexion would be good and that everything would be all right that we would not have to defile ourselves with the king's meat and then this eunuch this this one that was there uh watching over them he begins to recognize well perhaps I could just give them 10 days perhaps I could give them a period of time and we'll just see how this works out I don't really have to tell the king that they've refused his dinner uh perhaps we can just try this out for a little while and so they try this out for a certain period of time and at the end of that period of time this this the the the keeper of these men they wreck it he recognizes that they are faring better than those that are getting the king's meat now whether it was nutrition or whether it was because God blessed what they did and what they requested and because that he honored their willingness in a pagan culture to be able to stand against the the the the the times to stand against what they were being offered to say uh I don't really want to partake of that and so I am humbly asking that I can have a different diet that I can have a different uh thing to eat and God honored that and he let them fare better now because of their God blessing them and bringing them to a place of prominence in the Kingdom these weren't just a bunch of nobodies that stood out in the middle of this group of people that were bowing before this image these are men that have been looked up to they've got a little bit of uh prestige in the Kingdom they've got people that look up to them and come to them for answers and now they're standing there probably with their backs turned to this image they were refusing once again the king's commandment and as they refused the king's commandment they are not they they don't have the keeper of the men there to be able to say Sir um this image is uh um we don't do that and and we really don't want to bow down to that image and that's that's our that's our brother and we don't want to bow down to the image of Daniel and we just would rather that you would let us go hide in our offices and and not make a spectacle of of what we're doing and you know there's there's really no reason to stir up a lot of trouble uh perhaps we could we could come up with you know we could come up with a alternative we could come up with something different here but no God was allowing this test because these gentlemen had already passed some other tests they had already gone through some other fiery trials in their life and so now they were coming up to a real refiners fire one that was heated seven times hotter than it had ever been heated before and now they they were even given a second chance we're you know when when all of this music starts if you're willing to bow down to this image we'll let you off the hook and and you'll be you you can be okay and they said you can do what you want to do and whether our father delivers us out of the heat of this fiery furnace I don't know whether he will or whether he won't but nevertheless I am not willing to bow down as you have requested before this image of the Prophet I am one who realizes that this is idolatry and I'm not going to do it now see this makes people mad I mean this made the king mad this maze the king mad because he gave a commandment see hierarchies give Commandments and they think you need to bow down before their their idol worship but there is a group of people who have stepped outside of their box and said I have come this far leaning on the Lord I have come this far by Grace I have come through this many fiery trials and maybe it was not as hot as that furnace is but he's brought me through all of the other ones and he told me in the New Testament that these fiery trials were for my benefit because he was trying me to make me like pure gold so this fire the refiners fire Shadrach Meshach Abednego they were you know it's it's it's a it's as I stand here I find it really a shame on my part that I remember their Pagan names and not their Hebrew names Michelle that right it's one of them but that's their Pagan name Shadrach Meshach and Abednego but they had Hebrew names remember Daniel's name was changed to beltasher we remember Daniel's name but these boys they went into this fiery furnace and they were they went in Bound the men that threw them in the fire was so hot that they lost their lives the men that were throwing them in lost their lives yet these three Hebrew boys they went in and all of the fire did was loose their bob bob their loose their ropes from off of them so that they could walk around freely but what they found when they got inside the fire was uh like the the king says like unto the son of God there was there was something in that fire there was someone in that fire and it's the same someone that will help you in your fiery furnace when you're going through the refiners fire he will help you to go through it Revelation Chapter 3 Verse 18 he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isaf that thou mayest see the other thing that he said that he was going to offer to us to them and to us that when he when he appeared it was going to be like a Fuller's Soap a fuller or a borit is one who presses or widens cloth by pounding it with one's feet hands or a club to rid it of its impurities now this I'm telling you this sounds real Pleasant doesn't it and a soap or an Alkali From the Ashes of a plant macabushim is used to bleach the cloth so we have the soap which is to bleach and I just figure that if you're going to get the Fuller soap you're going to get the Fuller too so you're going to get the whitening but you're also going to get the pounding and The Stomping this sounds like such a delightful Journey doesn't it don't fear you've been walking through it your whole life it intensified when you gave your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ and if you haven't given your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ it will intensify and if you move here it will intensify because this is a Revival Center and we're pursuing Revival and when you pursue Revival and when you pursue the purposes of God no matter where you are it intensifies the fire intensifies and the pounding intensifies but the whitening also has to intensify because there are things inside of me as we have said before that I cannot currently see there are things when I came to the Lord Jesus Christ I repented of them he allowed me to see them and then as I continued my journey there were things there that I yet could not see that needed to be gotten out of my life there were things that needed to be purified by the Fuller soap and by the refining fire and so the Lord allowed this process whereby he brought it to the surface as the dross and he allows me to see it and then I have a choice will I bring myself out of the fire and let it Harden back together as impure metal or will I say I give it to you Lord now most of us around here know this is not a once and done process it is a continual process now there are times in our life where we feel like that we're in an intense furnace and there are other times where that it doesn't feel so hot yet we are in the we are in the process of the spirit of the Lord working with us to be able to bring us into his stature Into His Image so that he can do fully with us what he wants to do now we uh I think it was last Sunday we talked about how that David was a man after God's Own Heart he was one who uh allowed the Lord to work in him but there came a season of his life whether he sent others out to fight the spring battles he did not go as he generally did and he found himself in an adulterous mess and he found himself he didn't know he didn't know when he went up when he didn't go out to fight he didn't know he was going to find himself on a rooftop looking at another man's wife when he chose to commit adultery he didn't know he was going to have an illegitimate child or that he was going to have to kill a man have a man killed to try to hide his sin or that he was going to have the loss of a child sin will lead you farther than you want to go and it'll leave you longer than you want to stay and it'll cost you way more than you want to pay but there was something in David when he came back to the Lord Psalm 51 have mercy upon me o God according to thy loving-kindness according under the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee and the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow now David knew about Fuller soap he knew about the cleansing power of the law of of the most high God he did not yet have the blessing of knowing the the the fullness the messiah's work in shedding his blood for the remission of sin that sin could be annihilated but he knew where to go he knew where to run to when he was in a quandary with his own life and he was a miserable failure in all of his dealings because he had tried to satisfied his own flesh now he's coming to the Lord after all of the misery all of the loss and all of the the shame and the guilt of having someone killed and the shame of adulterous Affair and all of this kind of stuff and he brings it before the Lord and he says Wash Me now I found an interesting take on um Naomi in the Book of Ruth and this is taken from an article by Heim Ventura and he says Naomi in the Book of Ruth who wanted to be called Mara because she was bitter and the Lord marar or dealt bitterly with her and this writer says he never liked the idea of God dealing bitterly with someone and so he gives a different perspective here he said besides that it appears that this godly woman was looking for sympathy I thought that he says but when I studied the word marar m-a-r-a-r or bitter I found its Semitic origins in the word for bile that acid taste that comes to your mouth when you're spitting up yet this also comes from the same root as mura which is a sweet perfume or essential oil used for medicinal purposes Mira or Myra m-y-r-r-a-h was used to soothe skin abrasions so when God said that so when Naomi said that God was dealing bitterly with her she was making a play on words here she was asked to be called Mara not because she wanted sympathy but that she did not want sympathy she was declaring that she was being cleansed by borit macabsham or Fuller soap God was putting her through a cleansing process that was not pleasant but don't feel sorry for Naomi because this was only a process to help to cleanse her and make her pure those of you that may not be familiar with Naomi and the Book of Ruth and how that that her husband there was a famine in the land and her husband took uh he and Naomi and the sons they went to Moab and there the boys found wives and in the process of time the husband dies and then the two boys die and now Naomi is left with her two daughters-in-law and Naomi comes to a realize I'm in a wrong place wrong place I've got to get back to the house of God's bread I've got to get back there and so she proceeds to tell her two daughters-in-law who have also had loss they lost their husbands she proceeds to tell them Ruth and orpah I'm going back to my home where I belong this place is not my home I'm going back where I belong and you girls need to go back to your father's houses orpa chose to go back to her father's house but Ruth said not so where you go I'm going I have nothing back at my father's house that's pulling me that's tempting me nothing back there that I want to go to there's something on the inside of me I've been listening to your words Naomi I know you've had bitterness in your life I know you've had lost but I've been listening to the gospel message that you've been telling me that is why friends that we cannot neglect our senior uh our seniors Among Us you younger women you can learn from these Elder women they have understanding they have knowledge that you can learn from you don't need to disregard it you need to take it to heart because they as Naomi have been through some trials they've been through some tough places they've been through some real fiery trials and they can offer you something that would keep you out of going through the same pain the same tragedies that they went through you younger girls teenagers growing up to marriageable and even you young mothers there's something that these senior women can you can learn from and Ruth recognized that Naomi was one of those that she could learn from and she says I'm not going anywhere where but where you go where you go I'm gonna go your God is going to be my God where are you lodged that's where I'm gonna Lodge I'm going with you wherever you go and so now as God has taken Naomi through this this fiery process and allowed the Fuller Soul the the the bitterness of Life how whichever way you wish to look at it now she goes back to the land of her origin and we know that God has a beautiful plan that he is working out where that he is now again blending Jew and Gentile together to give a picture of the one new man Ruth a moabitus times I laugh Within Myself a chuckle to think about what it must have been like terrifying No Doubt when Naomi said to Ruth Boaz ain't getting it he just really ain't getting it you're gonna have to go down to the threshing floor and this is what you've got to do Ruth had confidence in that older woman she had confidence in Naomi that Naomi wasn't going to steer her wrong Naomi was given her advice that in in 2023 culture sounds outlandish it sounds crazy and maybe it was crazy then I don't know it probably was yet naor Ruth had a confidence in the in the instruction of Naomi that she would say okay I will go down and I will do what you're saying and no doubt that she's going down after dark to the threshing floor where all of these men are laying around where the where the wheat has been threshed out and there's big piles no doubt and Ruth slips herself under the edge of boys's garment and in a while Boaz realizes somebody's at his feet and she probably was terrified all over again as she has to reveal herself think about the number of terrifying incidents that Ruth went the first one was to even get the courage to do what Naomi was saying the second was to go through the dark by herself to get to the threshing floor and find the right man then to put herself at the feet of a man that she barely knew and then to reveal herself when Boaz woke up but when she walked away from that place she had a bundle in her hand and I think that she probably had a little bit more confidence and when she walked into the house of that older woman Naomi who had been through a grief she'd been through tragedy Naomi had been through bitterness of her own she had been through a Refiner's Fire she had been through the part where she felt like that she'd been stomped on and pushed against and washed with a fuller soap one that was bleaching and she probably felt at times like her bones were bleached out but yet when Ruth walked through that door and she had that bundle on her side Naomi knew that God was about to do something spectacular she probably didn't know the totality of what was about to happen but she knew that Boaz would not rest until that he took care of all of that Redemption all of that kinship all of that redeeming hell Naomi and her household back to their rightful position where the Naomi had all of her possessions back in her hands was hers Boaz redeemed it the Kinsmen Redeemer and God is doing the same thing for you he's doing the same thing for me as we go through these refiners fires as we go through this bleaching process being stomped on feeling like that nobody cares about us going through times when we feel like that nobody understands the bitterness of life that we've gone through yet God is working it to bring about a complete Redemption process in our lives foreign 48 verses 9 through 11. for my name's sake will I defer my anger and for my praise will I refrain for thee that I cut thee not off behold I have refined thee but not with silver I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction for my own sake even for my own sake will I do it for how should my name be polluted and I will not give my glory to another how many times have we in our pride and our arrogance tried to steal the glory of the Lord God's not going to have it he's not that's why he's taken us through these refiners fires because he's going to get all of the dross all of the uncleanness he's going to take it out of us now the refining has a very specific purpose he goes on to say as in the days uh of old Judah and Jerusalem will be an offering pleasing to the Lord King James reads then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years so in days of old or as in days of old Judah and Jerusalem will be an offering pleasing to the Lord when they first got to the land of Israel when they were first taken it over they were Conquering the land it was theirs and they were under the they were under the leadership of of of these Kings and then David and David was a man after God's Own Heart and it was a place that was pleasing to the Lord and then as time went on they got away from the Commandments of the Lord they got away from the peace of God they got away from the praising of the Lord they got away from all of those instructions that they had been given in time past and so God comes along and he says I am going to renew I'm going to restore the Judah and Jerusalem are going to be as in the days of old they're going to be that they're they're going to be an offering pleasing to the Lord now Judah meaning praise Jerusalem meaning peace he will put you in perfect peace whose mind here we're going to go back to these trees he will keep you in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon him we don't stay in perfect peace because we don't keep our minds on him but he is Desiring to bring us back to the place of old where like when we first got saved and everything was beautiful and everything was pleasant and we walked in a in a honeymoon so to speak we walked in a place of joy and that's where he wants to bring you to but it's as the fiery trials have come along you've picked up some bitterness you've picked up some anger you've picked up some resentment now I'm not putting anything on you don't don't take it that way I'm just naming off some of the things that we've experienced through the years that have caused us to be pulled away from our peace and they've caused us to be pulled away from our praise but God would like to restore us to that that old Jerusalem and Judah he would like to bring us to a place once again where we have our praise and we have our peace and the way that he does that is to take us through a Refiner's Fire and a fuller soap to wash us white and clean and to get all of the dross out of us to get all of that stuff out of us to where that we are allowing him to bring us to peace with our praise every one of us could name something probably this week that has pulled us out of our peace whether it was momentarily or whether it was for an extended period of time and so then we have to take the word that we have heard where Jesus said if you say to this sycamine tree if you say to this dendrite if you say to that prickly thorn bush you see Jesus gave another analogy as we mentioned on Tuesday night where he came along and he said if it's a good tree makes the fruit good and then in another place he told us that there was a necessity for the pruner to come along and trim off some branches that had no life in them they were really imposters that were trying to produce a fruit that was not for the good tree but you have been chosen to be a good tree to produce good fruit to the honor and praise of the Lord Jesus Christ and so it is of necessity that I a Believer go and allow the spirit to trim them off to take what I have been given see because we we want to sit back sometimes or in time past maybe we want to sit back and say okay Lord you do it but he wants our cooperation now this may sound off the wall but it's almost like he wants us to inflict our own pain because we've got to agree with him that he will be able to prune us [Music] we have to agree with him to say tree be gone this is not something that I need in my life it's absurd that we through the years have given real estate to horrible toxic thoughts and we entertain them and we petted them and we had pity parties for ourselves about them because we thought that it was our do justice that we should be allowed to hold on to all of these things whether it be on forgiveness or bitterness or anger or Strife or resentment or a bad childhood or whatever it was I'm do it let me let me Waller one more day no we would never use those words but that is the thought we give forth when we're given the word to speak to these trees to put them in this Bottom of the Sea because I've been given the authority by the word of God to say to my sick of mine trees be thou plucked up by the root I don't want to cut you at the base I want to pluck you out by the root I don't want any root of bitterness to be stuck in my mind to cause me to go back to and then shoot start sprigging up out of it and I got to deal with it again no we've got to say to this sycamine tree you root of bitterness you get out of my life and then you go into the depths of the sea I don't want you anymore God gave us these tools to work with and the furnace of affliction is heard what he's using the Fuller soap because he wants to call you back to your place of praise and he wants to call you back to peace then he said he was going to come near oh then he said he was going to come near to you to judgment and he gives a list of seven things that he's going to be a swift witness against number one he's going to be a witness against the sorcerers number two against the adulterers number three against false swears number four against those who oppress the wages of the hireling number five those who oppress the fatherless number six those who turn aside from the stranger and number seven those who fear me not saith the Lord seven things that he was going to say that he said he was going to be a swift witness against now sorcerers sorcerers we think about probably somewhere in this County I'm quite sure that there are witch covens meetings of witches and I am sure that we are on their radar but I do not have to fear because the Lord fights for me that doesn't mean I'm unaware that doesn't mean that I run scared that doesn't mean that I rise up and try to take uh to try with my ability to pull down every stronghold of Witchcraft that is in this County it is that I build up myself in my Most Holy Faith letting the blood of Jesus Christ be a bulwark against that now there are times where the holy spirit gives an assignment and he says you pray against that you you put a special bulwark of of the uh or safety net however you want to say it against that that it can't get to God's people there are sorcerers but there are those who do not attend which coven meetings but there are those who try to manipulate our service with their prayers and these are the ones that we are going to be a little bit more aware of that we have to deal with they're closer in but he said the Lord said I'm going to be a swift witness against the sorcerers remember Malachi 3 we said is an ongoing prophecy and we're allowing him to fulfill all of it as he will in our time so he says I'm going to come near to you to judgment and I'm going to be Swift with witness against the sorcerers so those that try to pray in a certain way to manipulate your life or manipulate the service here or manipulate the way that God would handle a situation there's a swift witness of the Holy Ghost that's coming right now to deal with these situations because there are people among us that have been given Authority in prayer as intercessors to take authority to plant a bulwark against these things still that they fall null and void powerless to the ground all right so as you pray I would advise you if your children are away from the Lord I would advise you not to pray God do what you have to you know put them in a car wreck or train record no no God who is rich in Mercy knows the right time the right way to get their attention perhaps it will be through tragedy that he gets their attention I don't know but you don't have to put any of that on them you can pray God your kingdom come and your will be done in earth as it is in heaven now see we can pray your kingdom come your will be done as it is in heaven so let it be done on the Earth but we can also pray let it be done in this earth man because that's what we're desirous of is that we are vessels that God can work through and this dirt this pile of Ashes this that's going back to the ashes is being used by God right now that we can pull Heaven's plans into the Earth I'm not trying to manipulate Heaven's plans I'm not trying to alter Heaven's plans I'm trying by God's grace to pull Heaven's plans into the Earth so that we can know what is the mind of God at this moment what is the mind of God for this season of My Life so we want to allow him to be swift witness against sorcerers then he said he would be swift witness against adulterers adultery comes in many forms and we know through the Old Testament God was against adultery and then in the New Testament there is a clarification between fornication and adultery fornication is relationship between man and a woman that is that they're not married and the Bible tells us that it is the necessity of a woman that if she has been found this way before being married that it is of necessity for her to tell her husband uh to be that this all needs to be taken care of before marriage so that afterward if she kept it a secret then Jesus said except for the cause of fornication she could not be put away so after the marriage if all of this has been laid out a fourth time the man has no excuse afterwards God takes adultery very seriously we know that there are a lot of scrambled eggs you can't unscramble scrambled eggs but I give you the words of a Vindicated prophet stay as you are and God have mercy on you if you ever do it again I'm right there right there that's what he said and I received that God has called us to a higher level so then we also have this aspect of adultery when it comes to the word of God where men are trying to bring in other women churches religious systems refer you back I believe it was last Sunday about the the mother of harlots the Roman system the mark of the beast all of this stuff is part of that Beast system and we find gospel preachers over the years as time has gone by there has been an indentation of an adultery in the preaching there has been uh where that they have been grappling they have been receiving the seed of other women they have been receiving the thoughts of other women they have been laying down with other women and they have brought these thought processes into the gospel preaching and it has caused a mixed seed a hybrid a hybrid and a hybrid cannot reproduce itself it may look almost like the Original Seed but a hybrid cannot reproduce itself now these adulterous Affairs that men have had through the years it has caused a bunch of scrambled eggs I'm talking religious now in the religious Realm because men have come with their ideas do you realize that there are there are National secrets that are given away to prostitutes because men have these adulterous Affairs and they give away these secrets of National Security and they don't even realize that they're doing it and Men preachers have done the same thing in the spiritual realm they have given away secrets and they have received stuff into their own bosom that they've tried to feed to the people and it has caused churches to become uh come on hybrid and that is why that we keep coming back we cannot we cannot partake of this paganism because it's part of the Roman system and we don't want anything to mess with them if you genuine seed of God because we want only the pure seed the genuine and so we can't allow mixture to come in Among Us all right then we have false swearers someone who willfully and knowingly makes a false statement about a material fact friends we live in an hour where Integrity matters it has always mattered but if that Integrity ever mattered to us as the Bride of Jesus Christ it matters now what we say matters what we talk about matters what we repeat matters what we say over again matters what we embellish matters we've got to speak truth we've got to be men and women of Integrity even to our own hurt we cannot be false swearers I realize that I'm not going to finish this today so the musicians can come while I finish these last four those who oppress the wages of the hireling now we don't have to deal too much with this um because we we most of us when we go get a job we ask what our salary is going to be before we ever start you know what's what's my hourly rate or what's my salary how often am I going to be paid but in those days and days of old where there was day laborers and they were depending on that money to be able to eat that evening to be able to go to the market that evening it was very important for them to keep their word about what they said that they would be honoring their word about the payment to that person that worked for them that they would honor that and that they would not oppress and at the end of the day come and say I'm sorry I don't have it I'm sorry you weren't worth what you what we agreed upon now this really again can go to the giving of our word not just a wage as in dollars and cents but the giving of our word honor your word honor your word if you say you're going to do something do it and if you can't say you can't as I get older I realize that I can't fulfill everything that everybody wants out of me you can't either it's not wrong for us to say no but to say we're going to do something for somebody and then we don't do it we're not keeping our word we say we're going to give something to somebody we don't do we're not keeping our word it is important for us to keep our word Swift witness against those who oppress the fatherless I find through the scripture that starting in the Old Testament all the way to the end of the New Testament God cared about these three the fatherless the Widow and The Stranger he had great care for them because he realized that there was no one to take care of them and he wanted somebody to be mindful enough to care for them and so he repeated it Time After Time After Time and if we as individuals are hard-hearted and we see someone who is fatherless or someone who is a widow or someone who is a stranger now let me just clarify about strangers I'm not trying to tell you mothers that your children need to speak to every stranger not no some of your children don't need any help they talk to everybody I think it's precious until they start walking off with a stranger and there are many panhandlers on the street corner and I don't think that God called me to provide for every one of them I can't it's impossible and I have been burnt enough times until that I struggle with helping any of them so now I have a choice will I Harden My Heart against all of them and Say Never Again or will I allow the refiners fire will I allow the Fuller soap to continue getting things out of me till I can have clearer eyes clearer vision more genuine understanding and and uh a clearer ear to hear that gentle still small voice say this one this one put aside your thinking put aside your bias put aside anything that would be in your mind against panhandlers this one The Importance of Being LED by the Holy Ghost so that we can help the Widow especially those that are of the household of faith we've got widows here that need help some of them don't need the financial help God has provided that but some of them in their Elder age have got weak and they just need somebody to come and put something heavy on a top shelf out of the way the fatherless we have children in this assembly that do not have a natural father but we men can reach to them and be kind show compassion step in where Mama might not be able to fulfill give a word of instruction that may be coming from a man would be different than coming from a mother and and at that appropriate time by the leadership of the Holy Ghost that word of instruction coming out of the mouth of a man a word in due season that would not only help that child but help that mother because God is coming with swift judgment against those who oppress the Widow the fatherless the stranger from his right and then those that don't fear the lord he desires for us to have a reverential awe of him I don't have to be afraid of him how many times in the New Testament did he say fear not fear not don't be afraid he doesn't want us to be afraid of him but he doesn't want us to be haughty he doesn't want us when he comes in here to try to ourself up against him and say no not this time to allow the reverential all of the spirit of God to come in this place and to move Among Us in such a way now this ongoing prophecy is going to be an on ongoing teaching because there's no way I can finish today so I want you to stand with me and we'll take what we have heard thus far and we'll let the Holy Spirit just begin to work among us to do in US Ben you're getting a song we we're just going to allow the Holy Spirit to work in us and take what we've heard today there's plenty to chew on there's plenty for us to say Lord I know that you have let me be in a heat of battle you've put me in a place of the Refiner's Fire and it sure doesn't feel good but I realize as I've said under the sound of the word today that it is necessary for my growth it is necessary for my uh my ongoing instruction in the word of God that I get this piece of dross out of the way this that is coming up in my heart in my mind in my thought processes even now it is something that I realize that you're dealing with right now and you've brought me into this fiery place because this is what you want to deal with right now because you have a desire to bring fullness completeness wholeness into my life now Lord as we worship together I ask you to work among your people to accomplish what you desire to today in the name of Jesus Christ you seal this word in and do Great and Mighty things in our midst Hallelujah [Music] thank you Lord any times of question certain circumstances and things I could not understand [Music] and many times and trials weakness blurs my vision then my frustration gets so out of hand but it's then I am reminded I've never been forsaken I've never had to stand one test alone but when I look at all the victories and the spirit Rises up in me and it's through the fire my weaknesses make strong and he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to collide and he never offered our victories without fighting but he said hell would always come in time and just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says giving and just hold on cause Milo will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] so many times of question circumstances things I could not

will show up and he will take you through the fire again I know within myself that I would surely perish but if I trust the mighty hand if God he'll Shield the Flames again he'll never promised that the cross would not get heavy and not be hard Hallelujah no he never offered our victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time yes he did [Music] just remember when in your standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says giving in just hold on cause our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again and just hold on cause my Lord will show up and

starting this week to own their own business and we want to ask the Lord it's a promise for the men of this church we claim that promise we speak that promise over their lives that they will be blessed going out coming in and they're sitting down and when they're standing up that they will be blessed that all the anxieties that come with starting a business would just roll off of them in the name of Jesus Christ Lord as we lay our hands upon them Lord Joshua is the one that is going to be doing the majority of the work but God as uh uh being married to a wife Lord this is a joint venture and there is anxieties with it and so we ask you Lord that you would relieve both of them of this anxiety God that there would come such a wave of assurance from the hand of the Living God that they know that this is the moment this is the hour this is the right time this is the business this is what you have ordained for them and so God I pray that it says they step out on a word from the Lord that was given many years ago that it's an ongoing prophecy even as we mentioned this morning God this ongoing prophecy we bring it forward to February of 2023 for Joshua and charity Yantis to believe that this business would Prosper that it would be a a business of integrity and that God you would let there be such favor upon it that people will stand back and say wow What the Lord Has Done on their behalf now God I pray that you will send the work according to your will that there would not be any Unholy alliances made give such Direction by the holy ghost that there would be no Unholy Alliance that God you would direct Joshua and charity in everything that they do every Venture that they make Lord decisions concerning Finance whatever that would be I pray God that you would just work upon them and in them and that your blessing would rest on them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray this amen amen praise the Lord Hallelujah now you got me praise foreign [Music]
