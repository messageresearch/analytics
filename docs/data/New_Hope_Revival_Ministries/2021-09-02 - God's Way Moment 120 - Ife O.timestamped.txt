[0:00] let me tell you something that was grace
[0:03] breaking forth in a garden
[0:06] that had just lost its way
[0:12] [Music]
[0:14] you know people don't understand
[0:16] original sin like we do here
[0:19] and sometimes people will say well uh
[0:21] i'll tell you this uh eating an apple if
[0:24] eating an apple would cause you to know
[0:27] you're naked
[0:30] brother ram said we need to pass the
[0:31] apples
[0:34] how many of you know that's not the way
[0:36] it works
[0:37] they were naked but not ashamed because
[0:40] they were covered by the shekinah by the
[0:44] heavy glory of god they didn't know they
[0:48] had not been made aware of the of the of
[0:51] the knowledge between good and evil it
[0:54] was all good they didn't know evil
[0:56] existed hallelujah there was no shame in
[0:59] their nakedness now they've sinned
[1:01] against god and when god was coming in
[1:03] the evening for the next appointment of
[1:05] fellowship they wanted to make sure they
[1:07] didn't face him in their newfound
[1:09] nakedness
[1:10] so they grabbed them some fig leaves and
[1:12] started sewing them together and trying
[1:14] to figure out how they would cover god
[1:15] said that'll never work but i have a
[1:17] better way
[1:18] [Music]
[1:19] i have a grace-filled way
[1:22] i'm going to show you what it's all
[1:24] about
[1:26] there must be a lamb
[1:29] there must be a death
[1:32] there must be blood
[1:34] shed
[1:36] and then i'm going to take off those
[1:38] skin this is god i tell you what a
[1:40] tailor he was
[1:41] that he would come down in the garden of
[1:43] eden and make coats of skin and put them
[1:46] on adam and eve let me tell you
[1:48] something that was grace
[1:50] breaking forth in a garden that had just
[1:54] lost its way
[1:56] i want you to know the atmosphere of
[1:58] glory that had been in that garden was
[2:00] now gone it was a different place eden
[2:03] would never look the same
[2:06] it was gloomy and depressing and god
[2:10] shows up and he makes away by his grace
[2:14] where there is no way and he's still
[2:16] making the same way today provided a
[2:19] lamb that would provide for you a bloody
[2:22] cloth that you could wrap yourself in
[2:24] the clothes of his redemptive work
[2:28] that you would not stand before him
[2:30] naked what did it
[2:32] because you joined the right church
[2:34] because you recognize the right prophet
[2:38] because you said you believed a certain
[2:40] message
[2:41] no because you accepted the gift of
[2:44] god's grace hallelujah and you let that
[2:48] work in you don't ever stop his work
[2:52] don't ever stop letting grace do its job
[2:54] in you i want to thank god that grace is
[2:56] still working in me
