[0:07] i think sometimes we say i love him
[0:11] like he's a flavor
[0:14] like i prefer chocolate over vanilla
[0:18] but i want you to know that's not loving
[0:20] christ
[0:21] loving him is being willing to lay down
[0:26] everything that we
[0:28] have everything that we are
[0:31] everything that we're fond of everything
[0:34] we like laying it all down and loving
[0:38] him
[0:39] really
[0:40] loving
[0:41] him
[0:43] when we live in that place of
[0:46] relationship
[0:48] it is impossible to do it without joy
[0:52] you can't live in that love and rebel
[0:57] against what god's trying to do
[1:00] for you and through you
[1:02] and around you
[1:05] when you are living in the love of god
[1:08] you enjoy that time with him but but you
[1:11] don't completely cut yourself off from
[1:13] the rest of the body of christ because
[1:16] there's so much love in your heart the
[1:18] love you have for him the love he has
[1:20] for you you want to spread some of that
[1:22] around
[1:24] when you find something you really like
[1:26] that you really are fond of you want to
[1:28] share that you want to talk about that
[1:30] with somebody else i'm telling you the
[1:32] bride of christ must have communion with
[1:36] him
[1:36] we must have oneness we must have
[1:38] abiding we must have dwelling we must
[1:41] have intimacy with him
[1:44] it's about leaning on our beloved it's
[1:47] about trusting that if we can't stand on
[1:50] our own his shoulder
[1:53] remain solid
[1:56] it's not the will of the lord for us to
[1:58] only abide in that joy and have that joy
[2:00] remain uh dwelling in us when everything
[2:03] is going good that's not the joy of the
[2:05] lord the joy of the lord is what
[2:08] sustains us when everything's going bad
[2:11] the joy of the lord is what becomes a
[2:13] weapon
[2:15] when we understand that praise is not
[2:18] just uh standing in awe of him and
[2:20] lauding him as king of kings and lord of
[2:23] lords but praise is actually something
[2:26] that shifts the spiritual atmosphere
[2:29] around us
[2:31] because when the praises go up
[2:34] the blessings of the lord
[2:36] start filtering down
[2:38] that's when joy becomes a strategy
[2:41] to win a battle
[2:42] that
[2:43] needs to be won
[2:46] come on now
[2:47] shout
[2:49] when they heard the sound of the trumpet
[2:52] they shouted
[2:56] i don't know if it was a trumpet or the
[2:58] shouting i don't know what it was it was
[3:00] those sounds probably blending together
[3:03] in obedience to the lord that caused
[3:05] that wall to fall flat it just
[3:08] disintegrated and they didn't even have
[3:10] to step over it
[3:13] they just walked right in the strangest
[3:15] silliest
[3:17] strategy that you've ever heard for
[3:19] winning a battle and taking a wall city
[3:21] and yet it's what god chose i'm telling
[3:23] you if you will choose today to remain
[3:26] in the joy of the lord no matter what's
[3:28] going on in your life if you will choose
[3:31] today to remain in the joy of the lord
[3:32] no matter what's going on in your life
[3:34] you will find the victory
[3:37] it's on the other side of your shout
[3:46] you
