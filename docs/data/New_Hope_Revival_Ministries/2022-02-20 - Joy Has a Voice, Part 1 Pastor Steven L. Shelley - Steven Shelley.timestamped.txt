[58:12] you may be seated this morning it's
[58:14] wonderful to see you in the house of the
[58:16] lord and
[58:17] there are those who haven't been with us
[58:19] in a while and we're very very glad to
[58:21] look and see them here this morning
[58:23] it's home
[58:24] so we won't welcome
[58:26] uh folk as visitors when this is their
[58:28] home but it's very nice to see them and
[58:30] that includes sister west who is truly a
[58:33] survivor
[58:35] [Applause]
[58:39] we didn't see her like paul did in her
[58:42] in her weakest moment or sickest moment
[58:45] but i thought she was radiant this
[58:47] morning when she came to my office to
[58:49] greet me
[58:50] and i know that that is the goodness of
[58:52] the lord
[58:53] and her testimony is she was very very
[58:56] sick but god has been so good and so
[59:00] gracious to her
[59:02] and
[59:02] she drove a long way to be in the house
[59:05] of the lord this morning and i'm so
[59:07] thankful to have her here
[59:09] it's a wonderful joy to know that
[59:11] someone has a desire
[59:13] to get up and be in the house of god
[59:16] that is my desire and we are teaching
[59:19] our children that by example
[59:21] we see how things fade out as the years
[59:23] and generations go by
[59:25] if you and i don't value attendance in
[59:28] the house of god our children will value
[59:30] it less than we do our grandchildren if
[59:33] we tarry if jesus tarries and we tarry
[59:36] here they'll value it even less than we
[59:38] have valued it it's a very important
[59:40] thing to remember that we are setting an
[59:43] example for the generations do you
[59:45] believe that we really are god bless you
[59:48] for your faithfulness to the house of
[59:49] god this morning i understand that chad
[59:52] is working again and not here but we
[59:55] will
[59:56] still mention
[59:57] that today is his anniversary and uh
[1:00:01] because his best half is here
[1:00:04] and so we want to wish chad and jennifer
[1:00:07] a happy anniversary today a wedding
[1:00:09] anniversary
[1:00:10] [Applause]
[1:00:16] i know that jennifer still looks young
[1:00:20] she really still looks
[1:00:21] radiant and young like she did way back
[1:00:24] then yes you do quit shaking your head
[1:00:26] no yes you do and i'm the boss
[1:00:31] if you don't believe that you just asked
[1:00:33] nora and uh
[1:00:34] was it
[1:00:35] who was it said this morning was it
[1:00:37] millie or nora told joshua said you
[1:00:39] listen to brother you listen to pastor
[1:00:41] he's the boss
[1:00:43] and you do look young and beautiful this
[1:00:46] morning
[1:00:47] and uh the reason why i'm mentioning
[1:00:49] that is because they're only a couple of
[1:00:52] years
[1:00:53] behind my wife and i we were married in
[1:00:57] 97 and they were married in 99.
[1:01:00] of course there were a couple of kids
[1:01:02] when they got married but that's about
[1:01:03] what about 23 years
[1:01:06] this year
[1:01:07] and uh
[1:01:08] luke is is with his dad but levi's up
[1:01:11] there and you can see that god has been
[1:01:13] good to them and ariely is on the end of
[1:01:15] the pew there you can see god has been
[1:01:17] good to them so we thank the lord
[1:01:20] uh a couple of announcements that we
[1:01:22] would like to make this morning one is
[1:01:25] i think i have this tuesday night right
[1:01:29] if i find out that i have mistaken the
[1:01:31] tuesday night i'll let you know asap
[1:01:34] but it looks like our brother caleb
[1:01:36] doron from
[1:01:39] tucson arizona will be with us on
[1:01:42] tuesday night
[1:01:44] march the 15th now all of you that are
[1:01:46] excited you better be here
[1:01:50] it's on a tuesday night he won't be with
[1:01:52] us on the weekend but he is coming to
[1:01:54] speak at a little church if you want to
[1:01:56] go up on friday night i'm going to try
[1:01:58] to go
[1:01:59] uh i don't know where the church is but
[1:02:02] it's in the greater atlanta area which
[1:02:05] can be
[1:02:06] as a big area hitting it brother carrie
[1:02:09] i don't know which one of those towns
[1:02:10] it's in i will find that out for you
[1:02:13] between now and then but there is a
[1:02:14] little haitian brother who pastors a
[1:02:17] little group of message people there in
[1:02:20] that little town and brother
[1:02:22] caleb met them in florida and met the
[1:02:25] pastor at a minister's meeting he
[1:02:27] invited brother caleb to come and he
[1:02:29] mentioned to me that he was coming and
[1:02:31] that he would like to stay a day or two
[1:02:33] past the sunday and i said well then you
[1:02:36] come down and speak for us i believe
[1:02:38] that is tuesday night march the 15th but
[1:02:41] i will double check that
[1:02:43] on tuesday night march the 29th
[1:02:46] we won't particularly have a guest
[1:02:48] preacher i don't know who will preach
[1:02:50] but we will have a very very special
[1:02:52] guest
[1:02:53] singer
[1:02:54] and uh
[1:02:56] she's one of the best and we love her
[1:02:58] here very very much and she'll be here
[1:03:01] with her family on tuesday night march
[1:03:04] the 29th and we're looking forward to
[1:03:06] having them a few years ago they were
[1:03:08] here on spring break and we get to be
[1:03:10] blessed by her song ministry uh
[1:03:14] again and i believe that's that is
[1:03:16] tuesday night march the 29th and we will
[1:03:19] have special meetings here friday night
[1:03:22] saturday night and sunday morning april
[1:03:25] 1 2 and 3.
[1:03:28] one of those days is sister alfreda's
[1:03:30] birthday is it first or second second
[1:03:33] um we will be having a special weekend
[1:03:36] of services with brother daniel miller
[1:03:39] from uh idaho
[1:03:41] and his wife sister anna and they
[1:03:44] minister in both song and in the word
[1:03:47] and uh he was a real short-winded
[1:03:50] preacher when he was here the last time
[1:03:52] uh but i don't expect it to be that way
[1:03:55] i don't if it is and that the lord moves
[1:03:57] as mightily as he did then that's all
[1:04:00] right isn't it
[1:04:01] but uh when you have somebody pulling on
[1:04:04] you and amen in you and working with you
[1:04:06] a little bit well it just uh it can make
[1:04:09] for an incredible combination and we're
[1:04:11] going to do that we're we feel like this
[1:04:14] is an ordained time it feels like an
[1:04:16] appointment
[1:04:17] and we were going to do it the last
[1:04:19] weekend of march and we found out
[1:04:21] tuesday night that there were some folks
[1:04:23] who had planned for months to be away
[1:04:26] that weekend
[1:04:27] and we can't always do this but
[1:04:30] something just
[1:04:31] went right down into the deepest part of
[1:04:34] me and said
[1:04:35] this can't be we've got to do something
[1:04:38] about this
[1:04:39] so i asked you to pray tuesday night and
[1:04:42] when i woke up wednesday morning the
[1:04:44] lord gave me a very clear word don't you
[1:04:47] wish it could always be that way
[1:04:50] i wished it could always be direct and
[1:04:52] clear for somebody like me
[1:04:55] but he gave a very direct word
[1:04:58] he spoke to my heart about it being a
[1:05:00] beginning and not an ending
[1:05:02] and therefore he was moving it to the
[1:05:04] beginning of the month instead of the
[1:05:06] ending of the month and i said but lord
[1:05:10] the world celebrates april april fool's
[1:05:13] day
[1:05:14] on april the 1st i hate to start
[1:05:17] anything on april i won't even tell you
[1:05:19] what he said
[1:05:21] but you know there is a there is a real
[1:05:24] big fool out there
[1:05:27] we're not gonna we're not gonna give him
[1:05:29] any attention
[1:05:31] but the enemy said he had i mean god
[1:05:33] said i've got a way of of fooling the
[1:05:36] enemy
[1:05:37] and so i don't know what god is going to
[1:05:40] do but i
[1:05:41] feel firmly that it's going to be a real
[1:05:44] visitation from the lord so april 1st
[1:05:47] 2nd and 3rd we're looking forward to
[1:05:49] what the lord has
[1:05:51] three of our children are in dallas this
[1:05:53] morning
[1:05:55] attending some special youth meetings
[1:05:57] there annual youth meetings
[1:05:59] and i don't know how how everything has
[1:06:03] been but we began to get texts last
[1:06:05] night and said that the service was
[1:06:07] outstanding and and benjamin said daddy
[1:06:10] uh brother really really preached
[1:06:13] brother watkins really preached brother
[1:06:16] jason watkins we heard him preach in
[1:06:19] tucson just a few weeks ago at the
[1:06:21] minister's meeting and it was absolutely
[1:06:24] outstanding
[1:06:25] and so when we heard that he was going
[1:06:27] to be the speaker and the kids wanted to
[1:06:29] go then we wanted to make that possible
[1:06:31] but i miss i miss them all three this
[1:06:34] morning i especially miss the son of my
[1:06:36] right hand because i depend on him but
[1:06:39] i'm so thankful that joshua is here with
[1:06:42] us today he wasn't here last week
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:47] i tell you he's a real blessing in my
[1:06:50] life and i'm so thankful to god to have
[1:06:52] him
[1:06:53] and he's not just a good driver he's
[1:06:55] just a good buddy and i appreciate him
[1:06:57] so much
[1:06:58] would you stand with me this morning and
[1:07:00] let's approach the word let's thank god
[1:07:02] for these musicians i thought about
[1:07:04] singing but i took my time to talk so
[1:07:07] god bless you all very much
[1:07:11] i want to read this morning in psalms
[1:07:14] 118.
[1:07:16] i want to begin in verse 1 and i want to
[1:07:18] read the psalm for you it's not a not
[1:07:21] the shortest one in the book
[1:07:23] it's not the longest one either
[1:07:26] but i want to remind you that you may be
[1:07:29] sitting for some time unless you choose
[1:07:31] to stand up and cheer and you're always
[1:07:32] welcome to give god praise
[1:07:35] otherwise you may be sitting a little
[1:07:37] while today i believe the lord is
[1:07:39] turning this
[1:07:40] uh subject for us in a in a different
[1:07:43] direction slightly and
[1:07:45] and i'm excited about what he might want
[1:07:47] to say to us today
[1:07:49] i pray that you'll put in your your
[1:07:51] whole heart
[1:07:52] i wanted to say this not to embarrass
[1:07:54] anybody because brother steve and sister
[1:07:57] beth rarely are
[1:07:59] they're usually here ahead of time but
[1:08:01] this morning they were getting here
[1:08:03] right as the service was beginning to
[1:08:05] start the pokes
[1:08:06] and i wish that everybody could come in
[1:08:09] like they came in
[1:08:11] uh i looked and i saw the biggest smile
[1:08:14] the most beautiful smile sister beth was
[1:08:16] on your face and i knew you wasn't
[1:08:18] smiling
[1:08:19] because you were gonna get to see me now
[1:08:21] that's worth smiling about too but that
[1:08:24] is not what it was about

[1:08:28] song that ben was singing and the
[1:08:30] atmosphere was being created and she
[1:08:33] came in with joy
[1:08:34] with a smile on her face for another
[1:08:37] opportunity to enter in and worship the

[1:10:04] unto the lord

[1:10:08] because his mercy
[1:10:11] endureth
[1:10:14] what
[1:10:15] forever
[1:10:17] let israel now say
[1:10:20] that his mercy endureth forever
[1:10:24] let me ask the saints to say today his
[1:10:27] mercy endureth forever let them now
[1:10:32] let the house of aaron now say
[1:10:35] that his mercy endureth forever let them
[1:10:40] now that fear the lord say
[1:10:43] that his mercy endureth forever
[1:10:47] verse 5 i called upon the lord in
[1:10:50] distress have you ever done that
[1:10:53] the lord answered me and he set me
[1:10:57] he set me in a large place
[1:11:01] the lord is on my side
[1:11:04] i will not fear what can man do unto me
[1:11:10] the lord taketh my part with them that
[1:11:13] help me
[1:11:14] therefore shall i see my desire upon
[1:11:19] them that hate me
[1:11:21] it is better to trust in the lord than
[1:11:25] to put confidence in men
[1:11:29] we know that's the truth
[1:11:31] it is better to trust in the lord than
[1:11:34] to put confidence in princes
[1:11:38] all nations compass me about but in the
[1:11:41] name of the lord will i destroy them
[1:11:46] they compassed me about yea they
[1:11:49] compassed me about but in the name of
[1:11:51] the lord i will destroy them i want you
[1:11:55] to try to imagine the psalmist singing
[1:11:57] these words because that's what he was
[1:12:00] doing
[1:12:01] they compassed me like bees
[1:12:04] they are quenched as the fire of thorns
[1:12:08] for in the name of the lord i will
[1:12:11] destroy them
[1:12:13] thou hast thrust sore at me that i might
[1:12:17] fall but the lord helped me
[1:12:20] the lord is my strength and song
[1:12:26] and it's become
[1:12:28] you say it for me
[1:12:30] my
[1:12:31] salvation
[1:12:33] verse 15 is my text the voice of
[1:12:37] rejoicing and salvation
[1:12:40] is in the tabernacles of the righteous
[1:12:45] the right hand of the lord doeth
[1:12:49] valiantly
[1:12:50] the right hand of the lord is exalted
[1:12:54] the right hand of the lord doeth
[1:12:58] valiantly i
[1:13:00] shall
[1:13:01] not
[1:13:02] die
[1:13:07] i
[1:13:08] shall not
[1:13:10] die
[1:13:11] but
[1:13:12] live
[1:13:14] this was a hated man
[1:13:16] this was a hunted down man
[1:13:20] this was a man who had as many enemies
[1:13:23] and maybe more than he had friends
[1:13:27] he had those waiting to assassinate him
[1:13:30] at various times in his life and yet
[1:13:33] this is his testimony for you to take
[1:13:36] home with you today i
[1:13:38] shall
[1:13:39] not
[1:13:40] die
[1:13:41] but live
[1:13:44] come on
[1:13:45] and declare the works of the lord i
[1:13:51] shall not die
[1:13:53] but live and declare the works of the
[1:13:57] lord the lord
[1:13:59] have chastened me
[1:14:00] sore
[1:14:02] but he hath not given me over unto
[1:14:07] death
[1:14:08] i remember my grandmother getting that
[1:14:10] from the lord one time when the lord
[1:14:13] spoke to her and said as from the
[1:14:15] scripture yea for a small space i have
[1:14:17] forsaken thee but i will gather thee up
[1:14:20] again
[1:14:21] and the lord's doing
[1:14:24] the lord's doing
[1:14:25] and here we hear him again the lord hath
[1:14:28] chastened me sore but he hath not given
[1:14:30] me over unto death aren't you thankful
[1:14:32] for that
[1:14:34] open to me the gates of righteousness
[1:14:37] i will go into them and i will
[1:14:42] praise the lord
[1:14:44] this gate of the lord into which the
[1:14:46] righteous shall enter i will praise thee
[1:14:50] for thou hast heard me
[1:14:53] and art
[1:14:54] become my salvation
[1:14:57] the stone which the builders refused has
[1:15:00] become the headstone of the corner are
[1:15:03] you with me
[1:15:05] this is the lord's doing it is marvelous
[1:15:09] in our eyes
[1:15:10] this is the day which the lord hath made
[1:15:15] we will rejoice
[1:15:17] and be glad in it
[1:15:20] save now i beseech thee o lord o lord i
[1:15:25] beseech thee sin now prosperity blessed
[1:15:29] be he that cometh in the name of the
[1:15:31] lord we have blessed you out of the
[1:15:34] house of the lord god is the lord which
[1:15:39] hath showed us light
[1:15:41] bind the sacrifice with cords
[1:15:44] even unto the horns of the altar thou
[1:15:48] art my god and i will praise thee thou
[1:15:52] art my god i
[1:15:54] will exalt thee
[1:15:57] and the last verse of psalm 118
[1:16:01] oh
[1:16:02] give thanks
[1:16:04] unto the lord for he is good for his
[1:16:08] mercy endureth forever
[1:16:11] just bow your head with me a moment
[1:16:13] father how we thank you for how you have
[1:16:16] been with us already in this service
[1:16:18] your presence has been real
[1:16:21] your anointing has been in the house
[1:16:24] you have given us the strength and the
[1:16:27] grace to lift up your name in praise to
[1:16:31] be able to worship before your throne
[1:16:33] and declare your goodness to the
[1:16:36] children of men
[1:16:37] you have prepared us now to speak to us
[1:16:41] from your word i know in my heart that
[1:16:44] every demon in hell gets nervous as men
[1:16:47] of god around the world approach this
[1:16:50] sacred task of feeding your little bride
[1:16:54] i asked today that you would give us
[1:16:56] courage to press through all of the
[1:16:59] enemy's distractions and to declare the
[1:17:02] word of the lord with boldness and with
[1:17:04] anointing may our ears be anointed to
[1:17:08] hear the word of the lord lord anoint my
[1:17:11] lips to declare the word of the lord and
[1:17:15] give us grace
[1:17:16] to be obedient to your word today we ask
[1:17:20] this in the mighty name of the lord
[1:17:22] jesus christ and for his glory and the
[1:17:25] saint said
[1:17:27] amen you may be seated
[1:17:32] i know that was a long reading to have
[1:17:34] you standing on your feet this morning
[1:17:37] but i appreciate you reading it with me
[1:17:40] and i appreciate you entering in as we
[1:17:43] shared it together
[1:17:44] and i want to call your attention if
[1:17:47] you'll help me to do that to verse 15
[1:17:49] again it says the voice of rejoicing
[1:17:53] and salvation is in the tabernacles
[1:17:56] of the righteous
[1:17:58] the right hand of the lord doeth
[1:18:02] valiantly do you believe that
[1:18:05] in the
[1:18:06] complete jewish bible dr david stern's
[1:18:09] translation of verse 15 and 16 he said
[1:18:13] the sound of rejoicing and victory is
[1:18:17] heard in the tents of the righteous
[1:18:20] adonai's right hand struck powerfully
[1:18:24] adonize right hand is raised in triumph
[1:18:29] adonai's right hand struck powerfully
[1:18:33] how many of you believe that's worth
[1:18:35] singing about
[1:18:37] and then you're most familiar with the
[1:18:39] with the nearly inspired version of
[1:18:42] verse 15 coming from the new
[1:18:44] international version this is the lyrics
[1:18:47] that we sing over and over again shouts
[1:18:50] of joy
[1:18:52] and victory
[1:18:54] resound repeat in the tents
[1:18:58] of the righteous they echo
[1:19:01] off the walls of the tents
[1:19:04] of the righteous have you ever been in
[1:19:06] that kind of a moment where it seemed
[1:19:08] like the shouts of praise just echoed
[1:19:11] and rang through your inner being and
[1:19:14] through the even the building that you
[1:19:16] are worshiping in if that doesn't do
[1:19:19] something for the inside of you maybe
[1:19:21] you need to pursue a personal experience
[1:19:24] with the lord
[1:19:26] i heard our brother talking as he
[1:19:28] invited our lovely sister to come and
[1:19:30] sing and play the violin and he spoke
[1:19:33] about her history and her heritage
[1:19:36] in my mind i'm sitting there thinking my
[1:19:39] god how precious that is to know that
[1:19:42] you have a heritage in the word in the
[1:19:45] truth and in the message but being a
[1:19:47] pastor my mind just clicked a little bit
[1:19:50] and i remembered what the prophet was
[1:19:52] teaching us it's god doesn't have any
[1:19:55] grandchildren
[1:19:57] the question this morning for our little
[1:19:59] sister and every other person under the
[1:20:02] sound of my voice it's not what mama has
[1:20:06] it's not what daddy has
[1:20:08] it's not what kind of man was grandpa or
[1:20:11] grandma but the question this morning is
[1:20:14] do you have a personal experience with
[1:20:18] the lord jesus christ
[1:20:20] because when we stand in that great day
[1:20:23] before that great light we won't be
[1:20:25] facing anybody's record but our own
[1:20:29] it won't be our heritage or our
[1:20:31] inheritance or our pedigree it will be
[1:20:33] have you been born again by the spirit
[1:20:37] of jesus christ
[1:20:39] so my prayer for people precious saints
[1:20:42] like that dear ones like that my prayer
[1:20:45] for all of them is may each of you today
[1:20:48] have your own experience with the lord
[1:20:52] and carry that heritage forward and you
[1:20:55] know you got something to go to the
[1:20:57] enemy and war about you when when you
[1:20:59] know that that thing has traveled down
[1:21:02] through the generations you can stand
[1:21:04] here today and say i claim all of my
[1:21:07] grandma's prayers all my mom and daddy's
[1:21:10] prayers i claim the life that you gave
[1:21:13] them and bless them to live i claim all
[1:21:15] the benefits and blessings that they
[1:21:17] pray down upon their children and their
[1:21:19] grandchildren but you know there's other
[1:21:21] things we inherit from our forefathers
[1:21:26] sometimes those things can only be dealt
[1:21:28] with by the word of god
[1:21:30] and by the power of the holy spirit you
[1:21:32] may not feel him but he's here
[1:21:35] he wants to speak so directly to your
[1:21:37] heart if you'll surrender your heart and
[1:21:39] allow him to he wants to cut through all
[1:21:42] the stuff
[1:21:43] he wants to cut through all the
[1:21:45] marshmallow fluff he wants to get right
[1:21:47] down to the root of the matter because
[1:21:50] we're living in such a serious time now
[1:21:53] it's time to know you gotta know you've
[1:21:55] got to know that you know that you know
[1:21:59] that you've had an experience with jesus
[1:22:01] christ
[1:22:02] i've been trying my children have asked
[1:22:04] me this week they said dad what is it
[1:22:06] what is it that causes somebody to do
[1:22:09] good for a while
[1:22:11] to hold on for a while to rejoice for a
[1:22:14] while to stay in the channel of god's
[1:22:16] spirit for a while and then all of a
[1:22:19] sudden fall away and fall away and fall
[1:22:21] away and keep repeating the pattern and
[1:22:24] you know there is no great answer for
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:27] there's no perfect answer for that but i
[1:22:30] think if we had to boil it down it
[1:22:32] depends on which voice are you listening
[1:22:35] to this morning
[1:22:37] i want to call this subject this morning
[1:22:39] joy has a voice
[1:22:41] we preached on the agony of joy
[1:22:44] we preached last week on joy being not a
[1:22:47] a
[1:22:48] a condition
[1:22:50] but rather a strategic position to face
[1:22:53] the enemy
[1:22:54] i want you to know this morning your
[1:22:56] words are powerful
[1:22:58] what you say matters
[1:23:00] what you think matters
[1:23:03] many of us are living today in the life
[1:23:05] that we prophesied
[1:23:09] we're walking in the fulfillment of what
[1:23:11] our own words prophesied that's what
[1:23:14] makes this message so powerful because
[1:23:16] never before did we have an
[1:23:18] understanding to know that when we take
[1:23:20] god's word and we live a life of
[1:23:22] surrender to that word and we begin to
[1:23:25] speak forth that word that all of heaven
[1:23:28] begins to move in all directions to
[1:23:31] bring that word to pass not only do we
[1:23:35] not necessarily need a prayer line but
[1:23:37] god has given us the grace and the
[1:23:39] ability to be able to speak our own
[1:23:41] victory to be able to speak our own
[1:23:44] deliverance
[1:23:45] aren't you glad for that
[1:23:47] it keeps it from being a one-man show it
[1:23:50] places the spoken word in the body of
[1:23:53] christ
[1:23:54] so that you and i can move by the same
[1:23:57] victory
[1:23:58] that's been made affordable to those
[1:24:00] available to those who speak the truth
[1:24:04] so i want to i want to just give you
[1:24:05] this again in the niv shouts of joy and
[1:24:08] victory resound in the tents of the
[1:24:11] righteous
[1:24:13] the lord's right hand has done mighty
[1:24:16] things joy
[1:24:18] has a voice
[1:24:20] joy has a voice
[1:24:22] joy has a voice
[1:24:24] are you going to be with me today
[1:24:26] what are the sounds and the noises
[1:24:28] coming from your home
[1:24:33] what's the neighbor here are you
[1:24:34] listening
[1:24:36] what's the neighbor here coming out of
[1:24:38] your house
[1:24:39] you know voice is scary
[1:24:42] you may think all your secrets are
[1:24:44] secure this morning but somebody knows
[1:24:46] what you're talking about
[1:24:48] it gets out it gets on the wind it goes
[1:24:50] across the water if there's a little
[1:24:51] pond there it just carries it further
[1:24:54] and i want to ask you if if i were to
[1:24:55] ask your neighbors if somebody were to
[1:24:57] ask my neighbor what would they find out
[1:25:00] what are the sounds what are the noises
[1:25:02] that are coming out of our house
[1:25:05] because the bible says here shouts of
[1:25:07] joy and victory resound
[1:25:10] in the tents of the righteous how many
[1:25:13] of you know we're not righteous in our
[1:25:14] own self but we're wearing the
[1:25:16] righteousness of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:18] so how many of you live in a righteous
[1:25:20] tent let me see your hand
[1:25:22] i live in a righteous tent
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:25] amen it's not always peace
[1:25:28] but we know how to get back to peace
[1:25:31] it's not always without problem but we
[1:25:33] know how to press through problems
[1:25:36] because we know where our victory lies
[1:25:38] so let me ask you if someone's listening
[1:25:40] if someone's on your porch if someone's
[1:25:43] down by the mailbox what are they
[1:25:44] hearing what are the sounds coming out
[1:25:47] of your tent
[1:25:51] maybe they're hearing the loud cheering
[1:25:55] of this favorite sports team
[1:25:59] being cheered across the
[1:26:02] goal line
[1:26:04] touchdown line
[1:26:07] you know that line they cross
[1:26:10] i started to call it a finish line i
[1:26:12] think that's in a race
[1:26:14] is that what people are hearing you
[1:26:16] cheering for auburn tigers
[1:26:19] are you cheering for road tide
[1:26:22] or you're cheering for whoever it is
[1:26:24] playing in the super bowl the super bowl
[1:26:26] has come and gone those two teams fought
[1:26:30] together or played together 1-1 i didn't
[1:26:33] know who was playing
[1:26:35] before it happened and i can't remember
[1:26:37] who was playing now that it's happened
[1:26:39] and i don't even know who won can't
[1:26:41] remember
[1:26:43] it's not that i didn't hear it or see it
[1:26:45] but i don't even remember who won
[1:26:47] because this is a whole week later
[1:26:51] i wish you helped me
[1:26:53] and it doesn't even matter how many of
[1:26:54] you know it doesn't matter
[1:26:56] doesn't even matter today who won the
[1:26:58] super bowl
[1:26:59] but is that the kind of sounds the
[1:27:01] shouts
[1:27:03] the voices that carry out of your tent
[1:27:06] is it the cheering for your favorite
[1:27:08] sports team maybe it's the sound of
[1:27:10] country music
[1:27:14] worldly secular
[1:27:16] music written by
[1:27:18] addicts
[1:27:20] let's see if anybody help me today
[1:27:22] i'm on a mission
[1:27:24] i came with a mission
[1:27:26] i wonder if it's the sound of some old
[1:27:28] wino
[1:27:31] who's singing blaring his love song who
[1:27:34] cheated who who's being true whose car
[1:27:37] is parked next door
[1:27:39] i wonder if it's somebody's old croning
[1:27:41] voice singing out knock three times on
[1:27:44] the ceiling if you want me
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:49] or you can eat crackers in my bed
[1:27:51] anytime
[1:27:53] come on now
[1:27:54] i wonder if it's some old tune like that
[1:27:57] that's escaping your house and out your
[1:28:00] front door and through your open windows
[1:28:02] into the neighborhood and people know
[1:28:04] you go to church
[1:28:07] they know you call yourself a
[1:28:08] pentecostal they know you've got a
[1:28:10] different standard than the world around
[1:28:13] you i'm asking your church this morning
[1:28:15] i'm asking you streamers is that the
[1:28:17] kind of music you're listening to and is
[1:28:19] that what you're broadcasting to the
[1:28:21] neighborhood if it is you ought not to
[1:28:23] be
[1:28:26] because we are what we eat we become
[1:28:29] what we feast on what we feed on
[1:28:32] the bible tells us it should be shouts
[1:28:35] of joy and victory that resound in the
[1:28:38] tents of the righteous of the lord joy
[1:28:41] has a voice
[1:28:43] but so does misery
[1:28:47] misery has a voice
[1:28:50] a tear in somebody else's beer
[1:28:53] has a
[1:28:54] voice come on
[1:28:57] these old pop singers that sing today
[1:29:00] and carry on the way they do vulgar
[1:29:04] i am i am so offended when i see
[1:29:07] supposed to be christian people posting
[1:29:10] on social media how disappointed they
[1:29:12] are
[1:29:14] in the halftime show of the super bowl
[1:29:17] why
[1:29:18] what is wrong not what is wrong with
[1:29:20] them what is wrong with you
[1:29:25] anybody with me
[1:29:26] what's wrong with you that you're
[1:29:28] disappointed
[1:29:31] you should have known what kind of
[1:29:33] garbage it was going to be before you
[1:29:36] sat down to put your eyes on it
[1:29:38] you knew they weren't going to sing
[1:29:40] amazing grace
[1:29:42] you knew they weren't going to sing how
[1:29:43] great thou art
[1:29:45] you knew they were going to twist and
[1:29:47] gyrate and
[1:29:49] their bodies around and show their
[1:29:51] bodies around you because that's what
[1:29:54] sells
[1:29:55] sexuality sells it sells everything it
[1:29:59] even sells hamburgers
[1:30:04] it's not just a beer commercial it's not
[1:30:06] just a cigarette commercial if they
[1:30:08] still have those or some alcohol they
[1:30:10] sell car washes with sexuality
[1:30:15] and you should not be surprised when you
[1:30:18] sit down and put that evil thing in
[1:30:19] front of your eyes
[1:30:21] you shouldn't be shocked at what they do
[1:30:24] oh i saw a big debate going on i didn't
[1:30:26] see any of the show but i saw a big
[1:30:29] debate going on among christian people
[1:30:30] well i liked it
[1:30:33] some christians said i liked it because
[1:30:35] it was oldies
[1:30:38] it took me back to the 80s
[1:30:41] it reminded me of what life was like
[1:30:43] well i want you to know there's only a
[1:30:45] handful of us in this room that ought to
[1:30:47] be wanting to go back to what life was
[1:30:49] in the 80s
[1:30:53] how many of you wouldn't really want to
[1:30:54] go back to what your life was like in
[1:30:56] the 80s let me see your hand i want to
[1:30:57] know
[1:30:59] nothing in the 80s calling you back
[1:31:02] and so the old music that was a theme of
[1:31:06] that generation why in the world would
[1:31:08] christian people want to go back to that
[1:31:09] in the hour we're living in
[1:31:11] setting all that filth in front of their
[1:31:13] eyes some country in secular music
[1:31:15] blaring from the radio and going down
[1:31:17] the driveway and everybody hearing and
[1:31:20] listening to that kind of stuff or you
[1:31:22] pulling on to the campground or into
[1:31:24] somebody else's yard with your windows
[1:31:26] down and your old you can jive music
[1:31:28] playing you ought to be ashamed of
[1:31:30] yourself
[1:31:32] that is not what you want to be
[1:31:33] resounding
[1:31:36] that is not what you want to be sending
[1:31:38] out to a world that's lost
[1:31:41] and going to a devil's hell
[1:31:43] you need to be sounding some hope i need
[1:31:46] to be sounding some hope
[1:31:49] anybody with me
[1:31:50] maybe that maybe it's the sound of your
[1:31:52] tv blaring
[1:31:54] and it's the storyline of your favorite
[1:31:57] favorite netflix uh uh uh series
[1:32:01] and you're binging on that
[1:32:03] and you're watching one episode after
[1:32:05] another after another after another
[1:32:07] after another and you've got the windows
[1:32:09] up or you've got the door open and that
[1:32:12] sound is going out across the world
[1:32:14] people doing what people do being
[1:32:17] entertained by watching the very things
[1:32:19] that god has told us in his word stay
[1:32:21] away from that flee from that
[1:32:23] unrighteousness get away from the
[1:32:25] filthiness of this world and what do we
[1:32:28] do we set ourselves down and we put our
[1:32:30] eyes
[1:32:33] turn every piece of furniture in the
[1:32:34] living room toward the the devil's
[1:32:37] of a box you know
[1:32:39] turn every piece of furniture right
[1:32:41] toward it so that when we come in and
[1:32:42] sit down it's the focus
[1:32:45] come on now
[1:32:47] we used to preset but that's not what
[1:32:48] steals people's conversations in this
[1:32:50] hour
[1:32:55] it's the littler tv
[1:32:58] it's a one week i'm not going to be on
[1:32:59] this long
[1:33:00] it's the one we carry around
[1:33:03] anybody say man
[1:33:05] 15 people in a room all 15 looking at
[1:33:07] their screen at the same time
[1:33:09] then they wonder why we don't have real
[1:33:11] fellowship
[1:33:12] then they wonder why we're not one in
[1:33:14] the body of christ anymore that's why
[1:33:17] because we let that be what we amplify
[1:33:22] that's what we send out of our life
[1:33:26] oh i can't i can't myself i can and you
[1:33:29] can't either spend all of her time
[1:33:31] getting caught up i've been praying for
[1:33:33] canada this week but i haven't been
[1:33:36] spending all my time watching everything
[1:33:38] that's going on
[1:33:42] it pulls me down
[1:33:44] it'll never help me to think what i need
[1:33:47] to think and say what i need to say and
[1:33:50] press toward what i need to press toward
[1:33:53] i'm sorry the word is making you nervous
[1:33:56] this morning
[1:33:57] maybe it's the sound of mother and dad
[1:33:59] arguing with one another
[1:34:02] maybe that's what's going out of the
[1:34:03] window that shifted everybody
[1:34:10] i told you
[1:34:14] i don't want to have to tell you again
[1:34:18] is that what the neighbors would hear
[1:34:21] if they stepped up on your porch
[1:34:24] at any given time and you didn't know
[1:34:26] they were coming come on now
[1:34:29] would they hear the sound of slamming
[1:34:31] doors
[1:34:33] closets slamming and bedroom doors
[1:34:36] slamming and everybody letting everybody
[1:34:39] know that they're not happy i'm
[1:34:40] preaching
[1:34:42] you just don't recognize it yet but i'm
[1:34:44] preaching
[1:34:45] is that the kind of sound that would be
[1:34:47] coming out of your how because the bible
[1:34:49] said it's the shout of joy
[1:34:52] it's a shout of joy and victory that
[1:34:54] resound in the tents of the righteous
[1:34:56] not the sounds of arguing and fighting
[1:34:58] and fussing and fuming and
[1:35:03] complaining and bellyaching and grumping
[1:35:05] and gripping and all of these
[1:35:07] self-fulfilling prophecies that we make
[1:35:09] over our own lives all that going out of
[1:35:12] our home no no no maybe it's the sound
[1:35:14] of mother yelling at her children
[1:35:18] and maybe they need it
[1:35:25] but here's the problem with that if you
[1:35:27] get caught up in that
[1:35:30] it becomes such a habit
[1:35:32] and that's the only sound
[1:35:34] if you train a child to only respond
[1:35:37] when you yell
[1:35:39] they will only respond when you yell
[1:35:42] so that's what you'll be doing
[1:35:46] for the next 18 20 years
[1:35:48] is yelling there's got to be a better
[1:35:50] way
[1:35:51] you see it's the shouts it's the sound
[1:35:53] of joy it's the sound of victory it's
[1:35:57] the sound of celebration that we have
[1:36:00] been broke out of prison we are no
[1:36:02] longer a slave to fear we're no longer a
[1:36:06] slave to sin we're no longer a slave to
[1:36:10] secular society we've found a new way i
[1:36:14] have found the way
[1:36:17] come on
[1:36:19] that's the kind of sound
[1:36:21] that needs to be echoing out of our
[1:36:24] homes
[1:36:25] and out of our lives
[1:36:27] i'm gonna give you another chance to say
[1:36:29] amen
[1:36:30] or is it the melodies and rhythms of
[1:36:32] praise and worship music
[1:36:34] escaping out of your home into the
[1:36:37] neighborhood
[1:36:38] telling people oh
[1:36:40] happy day
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:44] the bills aren't paid but oh
[1:36:47] happy day
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] my throat is sore but oh
[1:36:54] happy day
[1:36:57] i'm going through some stuff
[1:36:59] i'm fighting some mind battle but oh
[1:37:03] happy day
[1:37:08] shouts of joy and victory resound in the
[1:37:13] tents of the righteous of the lord maybe
[1:37:16] it's the sound of somebody praying
[1:37:19] maybe somewhere among us is somebody who
[1:37:22] still prays like an old-timey believer
[1:37:27] maybe there's somebody here somewhere
[1:37:29] that prays like like a generation ago
[1:37:32] prayed
[1:37:33] or like two generations ago prayed
[1:37:36] maybe somebody is down by the ottoman
[1:37:39] down by the footstool calling on the
[1:37:42] name of the lord
[1:37:43] maybe somebody's got their face buried
[1:37:45] in the cushions of a sofa and they're
[1:37:47] calling on the name of the lord and like
[1:37:50] daniel they're not ashamed to let the
[1:37:52] sound of that prayer and that
[1:37:55] intercession escape the four walls of a
[1:37:58] trailer or a house or a tent
[1:38:03] and go out into the neighborhood and
[1:38:05] make a difference
[1:38:06] send a message out there into the
[1:38:08] atmosphere somebody said what if nobody
[1:38:11] hears it i want you to know somebody
[1:38:13] hears everything
[1:38:16] if you don't have a neighbor to send a
[1:38:18] good message to let the demons in hell
[1:38:20] know send a message to every imp of hell
[1:38:23] and let them know there's going to be
[1:38:25] shouts of joy and victory resounding
[1:38:30] in this house
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:34] we didn't come here to listen at what
[1:38:36] the enemy had to say
[1:38:38] oh let it be the sounds of somebody
[1:38:40] praying the groans of intercession and
[1:38:42] supplication as the picture of our
[1:38:45] voices rises and falls with intensity as
[1:38:49] we lay our burdens and our petitions
[1:38:51] before the lord let that be the sound
[1:38:54] maybe it's the sound of god's prophet
[1:38:57] preaching at the top of his lungs as he
[1:38:59] preaches an uncompromised message of
[1:39:02] truth and revelation let brother
[1:39:04] branham's voice be heard in your
[1:39:06] neighborhood
[1:39:09] because it's not a man's voice
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:13] it's the voice of god
[1:39:15] speaking through a man
[1:39:18] let that go out
[1:39:20] don't be ashamed of what you've been
[1:39:22] well what if he says something is going
[1:39:24] to offend somebody they're already
[1:39:25] offended
[1:39:26] the gospel offends
[1:39:29] if the good news offends people what
[1:39:32] will they do when they hear the
[1:39:33] nitty-gritty of how to serve god
[1:39:37] won't hurt them
[1:39:38] let them hear it let that be on your
[1:39:40] playlist
[1:39:41] if somebody gets into your car and you
[1:39:43] didn't know they were getting in there
[1:39:44] let that be the channel
[1:39:48] let that be the frequency they hear
[1:39:50] maybe it's the sound of a of a service
[1:39:53] an archived service on the new hope app
[1:39:55] because you just had to go back and hear
[1:39:57] one little portion of a sermon i know
[1:40:00] very few people are going to go back and
[1:40:02] listen to a two-hour sermon that they
[1:40:04] sat through in the beginning but i know
[1:40:06] people who do on a weekly basis but
[1:40:08] maybe the lord is calling you back to
[1:40:10] one little section that you wanted to
[1:40:13] hear one more time let that be the sound
[1:40:18] that resounds in the tense of the
[1:40:21] righteous of the lord because joy has a
[1:40:25] voice
[1:40:28] every other emotion in your life has a
[1:40:31] voice
[1:40:33] there's thousands times ten thousands of
[1:40:37] voices screaming for your attention all
[1:40:40] the time
[1:40:41] everybody has got a podcast
[1:40:49] and everybody wants your attention
[1:40:52] and they want your ear
[1:40:54] they want to fill you with their
[1:40:56] thoughts
[1:40:57] and with their ideas
[1:40:59] and there's nothing wrong with wanting
[1:41:00] to to be involved in some things like
[1:41:03] that but i want you to know that should
[1:41:05] never be what drives you
[1:41:08] your patriot webcast or whatever it is
[1:41:11] you get so excited about that should
[1:41:13] never be the driving force in your life
[1:41:16] that's never going to bring your wife to
[1:41:18] victory that's never going to bring your
[1:41:20] children all the way through to the holy
[1:41:22] ghost
[1:41:23] come on brother
[1:41:27] learning those kinds of things even
[1:41:28] caring for weapons and taking care of
[1:41:30] things like that it's all good and it
[1:41:32] has a place
[1:41:34] just like these sisters may be listening
[1:41:35] to something for needle craft or cooking
[1:41:38] or they may be following a recipe
[1:41:40] there's nothing wrong with any of that
[1:41:43] but i want you to know none of that is
[1:41:44] going to bring you to the place where
[1:41:46] the shouts of joy and victory are
[1:41:48] resounding in your tent nothing is going
[1:41:51] to set you up for a breakthrough in your
[1:41:53] life other than praising and worshiping
[1:41:56] him and letting the word of god permeate
[1:41:58] the air and drive demon spirits out i
[1:42:01] want you to know the word of god being
[1:42:03] preached in power and demonstration even
[1:42:05] on an old tape recording has enough
[1:42:07] power to drive out the very forces of
[1:42:11] hell
[1:42:12] we don't drive them out because we
[1:42:14] listen to things and watch things
[1:42:21] and invite them in
[1:42:23] you're the door
[1:42:25] i said i'm looking for the open door
[1:42:27] you're the open door somebody said i
[1:42:29] wish i could just find the open door
[1:42:30] into my home into my family you're the
[1:42:32] open door you're the door
[1:42:35] you're the window
[1:42:37] you decide what gets into your life and
[1:42:40] what stays out of your life
[1:42:42] joy has a voice
[1:42:45] joy has a voice
[1:42:47] where are you pressing in now let me see
[1:42:49] it come on
[1:42:50] i'm talking to you and i'm not angry i
[1:42:53] feel like i've got a message to leave
[1:42:54] with you and i'm going to do it with all
[1:42:56] that's within me
[1:42:58] because some of us are listening to
[1:42:59] other voices
[1:43:01] and we need to be listening to the voice
[1:43:02] of joy
[1:43:03] and we need to be echoing the voice of
[1:43:05] joy
[1:43:06] we need to be the the microphone for the
[1:43:08] voice of joy come on
[1:43:12] you mean you want us to pretend like
[1:43:13] nothing's wrong yeah there's a time to
[1:43:15] do that
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:18] it's called faith
[1:43:20] somebody said i call that phony no no
[1:43:21] it's not phony
[1:43:23] it actually takes faith sometime
[1:43:25] to praise god in the bad times to
[1:43:27] worship god when everything's going
[1:43:29] wrong
[1:43:30] to let that be your testimony you know
[1:43:33] i'm preaching to you the truth today
[1:43:35] i woke up this morning and the spirit of
[1:43:37] the lord began to deal with my heart
[1:43:39] and i i wrote a section of notes here
[1:43:42] that i want to share with you that were
[1:43:43] not in the original plan but
[1:43:46] god let me dream a dream in the night
[1:43:47] that caused my mind to go back to this
[1:43:50] and i just want to leave this to you
[1:43:52] because the spirit of the lord just
[1:43:54] real real strongly impressed on me that
[1:43:57] too many people are listening to a voice
[1:43:58] of disappointment
[1:44:01] the bible tells us what hope deferred
[1:44:03] can do in our lives
[1:44:05] but i want you to know it can be even
[1:44:06] more than what we realize
[1:44:08] and it can be talking to us more than we
[1:44:10] realize what we're that we're even
[1:44:12] listening to it we may not even always
[1:44:14] be able to identify it but i've got news
[1:44:17] for you today good news and that is
[1:44:19] there is a voice
[1:44:22] that knows how to deal with the voice of
[1:44:25] disappointment
[1:44:26] there is a voice that knows how to deal
[1:44:30] with any other voice that's talking in
[1:44:32] your spirit man
[1:44:35] disappointed people
[1:44:37] first of all let me ask you this
[1:44:38] question because it's a good idea to get
[1:44:40] a little gage here
[1:44:42] how many of you have ever been
[1:44:43] disappointed
[1:44:46] i'm disappointed when i drink the last
[1:44:48] iced tea
[1:44:52] and there's no more
[1:44:56] disappointment is something we deal with
[1:44:58] every day
[1:45:03] i'm disappointed when it's too cold
[1:45:06] and i'm disappointed when it gets too
[1:45:08] hot
[1:45:11] you look up the word disappointment
[1:45:14] there's something always
[1:45:17] around us
[1:45:19] to disappoint us
[1:45:22] happy
[1:45:23] comes and happy goes
[1:45:25] i'm happy one minute and disappointed
[1:45:27] the next
[1:45:29] i'm on cloud nine one minute and let
[1:45:31] down with everybody in my life
[1:45:34] the next minute
[1:45:36] anybody ever been there
[1:45:37] oh
[1:45:38] yes you have
[1:45:40] disappointed people have been
[1:45:42] disappointed by life not just by running
[1:45:45] out of milk
[1:45:46] not just by not having ketchup for the
[1:45:48] french fries
[1:45:49] there's been other things
[1:45:51] there's a lot of things that can
[1:45:53] disappoint us along the way
[1:45:55] disappointed people have been
[1:45:56] disappointed by life they've been
[1:45:58] disappointed by other people they've
[1:46:00] been disappointed by the church they've
[1:46:02] been disappointed by god
[1:46:07] they've been disappointed by themselves
[1:46:10] often these people wear their feelings
[1:46:12] on their sleeves
[1:46:14] because they're so used to being
[1:46:16] disappointed disappointed they never
[1:46:19] expect anything else but to be
[1:46:22] disappointed
[1:46:24] if you should discover this morning that
[1:46:26] that uh disappointment has been your
[1:46:28] lifelong companion
[1:46:31] there's something needs to be done about
[1:46:33] it
[1:46:34] because god doesn't want us carrying
[1:46:36] that kind of voice around in our head
[1:46:39] for the rest of our life when there's a
[1:46:41] stronger voice that can be used that can
[1:46:44] be yielded to
[1:46:45] to combat every disappointment that we
[1:46:48] face
[1:46:50] i have to talk to myself sometime
[1:46:53] you ever have to talk to yourself
[1:46:55] when i realized that benjamin and jenna
[1:46:58] were going to be married and that it was
[1:47:00] god's will and
[1:47:01] that he was setting it up i was
[1:47:04] excited
[1:47:06] but i was disappointed
[1:47:09] it doesn't really matter much but it did
[1:47:12] to me at the moment
[1:47:13] i was disappointed that
[1:47:16] so many people who had been with him
[1:47:18] from the beginning of his life
[1:47:21] there were 50 people in the waiting room
[1:47:23] the day he was born
[1:47:25] and i was disappointed knowing that the
[1:47:27] wedding was going to be in dallas
[1:47:33] and i just got blue about it
[1:47:36] i just got disappointed about it and i
[1:47:38] just began to try to figure what i might
[1:47:40] be able to do well maybe we could have
[1:47:42] another reception maybe we could have
[1:47:44] another ceremony maybe we could
[1:47:49] i don't want people who want to be there
[1:47:51] i didn't want them to miss it
[1:47:54] and i wanted it to be honoring to this
[1:47:56] church to this house
[1:47:58] not only because of my position here but
[1:48:01] because of his
[1:48:04] i got through it i worked through it
[1:48:07] after all what does it really matter
[1:48:10] but at the moment it really mattered
[1:48:12] anybody ever been there
[1:48:14] really mattered well
[1:48:16] i spend a lot of time when i get my hair
[1:48:18] cut and i get my hair cut every two
[1:48:21] weeks
[1:48:22] every tuesday
[1:48:24] i like it to be short i don't like it
[1:48:27] curling up in the back like a sister i
[1:48:30] don't like it coming down in my face
[1:48:32] i like it short it's not always
[1:48:34] convenient to go
[1:48:36] but i make an appointment i'm there
[1:48:38] every two weeks and i spend a lot of my
[1:48:40] time there giving advice
[1:48:46] praying
[1:48:48] witnessing talking
[1:48:50] i've even had them say we ought to pay
[1:48:52] you
[1:48:54] instead of you paying us
[1:48:57] but this particular day i went in there
[1:48:59] some months back
[1:49:01] i went in there and i i was feeling blue
[1:49:03] benjamin dropped me off that morning he
[1:49:05] had an errand to run
[1:49:07] he dropped me off to get my hair cut and
[1:49:09] i was feeling a little blue about it and
[1:49:10] i thought you know texas is so far away
[1:49:13] and
[1:49:14] there's got to find a house got to find
[1:49:17] a place to stay you got all these kind
[1:49:19] of things were in my mind that morning
[1:49:21] and i sat down in the chair and
[1:49:23] and my friend said to me
[1:49:26] she said oh stephen you must be so
[1:49:30] excited
[1:49:34] and i said i am
[1:49:39] that was all i could get out i had let
[1:49:43] my own personal disappointment
[1:49:45] overshadow my own personal joy
[1:49:50] i was joyful i
[1:49:52] was thankful i
[1:49:54] am happy
[1:49:57] but i was also disappointed
[1:50:00] and she said well you don't look so
[1:50:02] happy i said
[1:50:06] you know how we do
[1:50:11] we get our phone out and
[1:50:13] turn it around so we can see how we can
[1:50:15] make ourselves look a little happier
[1:50:17] i said look i'm doing the best i can
[1:50:20] you know i wanted to say just cut my
[1:50:22] hair
[1:50:24] i didn't come for conversation
[1:50:27] and here's what she said to me a few
[1:50:29] minutes you could tell i was just
[1:50:30] sitting there blue she said stephen
[1:50:33] she said you're one of the most blessed
[1:50:35] men
[1:50:37] that i've ever known in my life
[1:50:40] you have four amazing children
[1:50:43] who love you and stacy
[1:50:46] who love the lord who love the church
[1:50:50] who love the things of god
[1:50:53] and your son is going to get married in
[1:50:56] texas and she said i know that's
[1:50:58] disappointing to you
[1:51:00] but she said every time you think about
[1:51:03] how disappointing it is that they're
[1:51:05] going to get married in texas remind
[1:51:08] yourself they're going to be living in
[1:51:10] your backyard
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:24] she thought i mean i didn't know brother
[1:51:25] is your whether to be excited about that
[1:51:27] or not
[1:51:29] is that supposed to make me feel better
[1:51:30] no it made me feel amazing
[1:51:34] she said see you have to give and take
[1:51:38] sure it's disappointing because you
[1:51:40] would like for it to be there where all
[1:51:42] all of his friends and everybody could
[1:51:44] be there to help you celebrate but she
[1:51:46] said the truth is you're not losing your
[1:51:49] son
[1:51:50] you don't have to leave him in texas
[1:51:52] when you leave after the wedding's over
[1:51:54] he's coming home to serve the lord with
[1:51:57] you beside you and you gain a daughter
[1:52:00] well i tell you what i nearly started
[1:52:03] talking in tongues
[1:52:06] ashamed of myself embarrassed that i let
[1:52:09] my disappointment be so heavy
[1:52:12] that i couldn't celebrate the joy of
[1:52:15] what the lord was trying we've all been
[1:52:17] disappointed
[1:52:19] but i had to talk to myself i had to
[1:52:22] listen to my hair cutter
[1:52:25] you sometimes have to talk to yourself
[1:52:28] you've got to listen to somebody trying
[1:52:30] to encourage you
[1:52:32] you've got to take the hand of someone
[1:52:34] who extends a hand of help who wants to
[1:52:37] pull you into a higher place
[1:52:40] you've got to be willing to cooperate
[1:52:42] with the process to pull you out of
[1:52:45] having disappointment as a lifetime
[1:52:48] companion
[1:52:49] because disappointments will come and go
[1:52:52] but here's the key we got to make sure
[1:52:54] they keep
[1:52:56] going we can't entertain the voices of
[1:52:59] disappointment in our life
[1:53:01] we can't compare our family to other
[1:53:03] people's families or our circumstances
[1:53:06] to other people's circumstances because
[1:53:08] if we do you know what the enemy will do
[1:53:11] he'll pull you farther and farther and
[1:53:14] farther beneath the waves
[1:53:17] it can't be the sounds of of despair it
[1:53:22] can't be the sounds of disappointment it
[1:53:25] can't be the sounds of wanting to nearly
[1:53:27] give up that resound in the tents of the
[1:53:29] righteous
[1:53:30] joy has a voice
[1:53:32] victory has a voice
[1:53:34] overcoming has a voice anybody with me
[1:53:37] here today
[1:53:38] you decide
[1:53:40] who speaks in your house
[1:53:46] you let somebody come in your house and
[1:53:47] start disrespecting you
[1:53:54] you hear sister beth
[1:53:56] they got to go
[1:54:00] you let somebody come in there and start
[1:54:02] attacking you in your own home
[1:54:05] where you pay the rent
[1:54:07] you pay the light bill you don't have to
[1:54:09] put up with that
[1:54:10] you can send them on their way
[1:54:13] you're just going somewhere else this is
[1:54:14] my home
[1:54:16] i hope we can get this sorted out later
[1:54:18] but right now i just want you out of
[1:54:19] here
[1:54:20] this is my house this is where i live i
[1:54:23] don't have to do this right now i get to
[1:54:24] choose when i have this conversation i
[1:54:26] don't have to have this conversation
[1:54:28] right now i get to choose you would do
[1:54:30] that
[1:54:31] i pray you would
[1:54:33] i pray you would put the devil on the
[1:54:35] run if he came there to try to disturb
[1:54:37] the peace of your life
[1:54:39] then why in this world do we keep the
[1:54:42] voice of disappointment as a constant
[1:54:44] companion in our head and never send him
[1:54:47] packing
[1:54:49] why do we put up with that kind of talk
[1:54:51] from our own head
[1:54:54] that we would quickly reject
[1:54:57] if it came from somebody else's voice
[1:54:59] is anybody listening to me today
[1:55:05] this appointment wants to be your
[1:55:06] lifetime
[1:55:07] lifelong companion
[1:55:10] when we first begin to recognize that we
[1:55:12] have kept company with a spirit of
[1:55:14] disappointment
[1:55:16] instead of recognizing immediately that
[1:55:18] it is time to get healthy
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:21] you know if you if you're reading
[1:55:23] something or someone speaks into your
[1:55:24] life or or you come across a scripture
[1:55:27] that places some correction or
[1:55:28] conviction in your heart about something
[1:55:31] then you just recognize i've got an
[1:55:33] unhealthy place in my life and i want to
[1:55:36] give that unhealthy place to the lord
[1:55:38] this is the area where i need the lord
[1:55:40] the most
[1:55:42] and i'm inviting him into my vulnerable
[1:55:44] spot the room that i've always kept
[1:55:47] hidden and protected for myself for my
[1:55:50] own thoughts
[1:55:53] but i'm willing to open that up now and
[1:55:55] let the lord come in this needs to be
[1:55:58] our first response when the spirit of
[1:56:00] the lord brings conviction into our life
[1:56:03] we need to be willing to open the door
[1:56:05] and let him come in and do what he wants
[1:56:08] to do
[1:56:10] are you with me
[1:56:14] but instead of recognizing immediately
[1:56:16] that it's time to get healthy
[1:56:18] we may be tempted to make excuses for
[1:56:20] our state of mind
[1:56:22] we may be tempted to even blame others
[1:56:24] for our constant drawing of the short
[1:56:26] straw it's easy to become a victim
[1:56:30] in our own minds
[1:56:32] it's easy to walk forward with a victim
[1:56:34] mentality
[1:56:36] setting up scenarios and circumstances
[1:56:39] and situations that will always make us
[1:56:41] the victim
[1:56:43] because a victim mentality
[1:56:46] attracts victimhood
[1:56:50] just like rejection
[1:56:52] attracts rejection
[1:56:55] and just like the meme that goes around
[1:56:57] hurt people
[1:56:59] hurt people
[1:57:01] it attracts and it will continue to do
[1:57:03] that until you decide who gets to talk
[1:57:06] in your head
[1:57:08] it's powerful it's powerful when we
[1:57:11] recognize i can shut the voice off
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:16] i don't have to listen to any voice
[1:57:20] contrary to the voice of truth
[1:57:26] i didn't want to put too much on ben
[1:57:27] this morning but if we could have i
[1:57:29] would have left to have sang that song
[1:57:32] the voice of truth
[1:57:35] because i can see all those israelites
[1:57:37] standing there with their knees and
[1:57:39] knocking
[1:57:40] because one little giant i say little
[1:57:43] giant one little giant could have been a
[1:57:44] hundred giants
[1:57:46] so when i say little i don't mean little
[1:57:47] i mean a few
[1:57:49] one little giant down there in the
[1:57:51] middle of the valley
[1:57:53] breathing out his accusations and
[1:57:54] threats
[1:57:55] all of the israelites standing on the
[1:57:58] hill with their knees knocking afraid to
[1:58:00] face their enemy
[1:58:02] the enemy saying to every one of them
[1:58:04] you're defeated your fear will defeat
[1:58:07] you you'll never be able to do anything
[1:58:09] and david steps out to start to do what
[1:58:12] god is anointing him to do and the same
[1:58:14] voices call out to him
[1:58:17] boy you'll never win boy you'll never
[1:58:20] win boy you'll never win you've been
[1:58:23] disappointed before you'll be
[1:58:25] disappointed again
[1:58:26] help me
[1:58:28] you'll never win you'll never win you'll
[1:58:30] never win
[1:58:31] but i want you to know it wasn't the
[1:58:33] voice of disappointment that got him
[1:58:34] down there in the valley
[1:58:36] oh no there was another voice talking to
[1:58:39] david that day
[1:58:40] i
[1:58:41] am with you
[1:58:43] i will be with you
[1:58:45] you are not alone
[1:58:50] there was another voice talking to david
[1:58:52] that day remember the bear
[1:58:57] remember the lion
[1:59:01] remember the other times that i have
[1:59:04] seen you through
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:08] we're talking we're talking about the
[1:59:10] greatest praiser
[1:59:13] we're talking about a man that had the
[1:59:14] biggest heart of worship
[1:59:17] we're talking about a man who knew how
[1:59:18] powerful it was to focus on the goodness
[1:59:21] of god instead of the severity of his
[1:59:23] problem but here we here he was just a
[1:59:25] young lad
[1:59:26] he was under immense pressure
[1:59:29] and he could have failed he could have
[1:59:32] fallen he could have broken
[1:59:34] in the midst of all of that pressure
[1:59:36] but he chose he made a choice that day i
[1:59:39] wish you'd make the same choice
[1:59:42] i wish you'd make the same choice and
[1:59:44] that is to listen to another voice
[1:59:47] listen to the voice of truth shut down
[1:59:49] the voice of disappointment
[1:59:52] we may be tempted to blame others for
[1:59:54] our constant drawing of the short straw
[1:59:57] it's easy to become a victim in our own
[1:59:59] minds
[2:00:00] our soulish inner voice starts agreeing
[2:00:03] with the voice of our disappointment
[2:00:05] saying
[2:00:08] see there's something about the voice of
[2:00:10] disappointment you need to know he needs
[2:00:12] a companion
[2:00:15] that voice needs another voice
[2:00:18] that voice needs an amen
[2:00:22] that that voice needs somebody to agree
[2:00:24] like every other demon voice
[2:00:26] like you heard god's prophet standing
[2:00:28] there on the platform praying for these
[2:00:30] people and all of a sudden the demon in
[2:00:32] a man sitting out in the audience would
[2:00:33] cry out a demon and a man standing on
[2:00:36] the platform and those demons would be
[2:00:38] calling out to one another to strengthen
[2:00:40] themselves
[2:00:41] so they could resist
[2:00:44] brother brandon would just stop the
[2:00:45] service and deal with that thing right
[2:00:46] away well i want you to know it really
[2:00:48] works that way
[2:00:49] and i want you to know the voice of
[2:00:50] disappointment that you've been
[2:00:52] listening to in your life over and over
[2:00:54] and over again longs for somebody's
[2:00:56] voice to agree
[2:01:01] and you know what happens let me tell
[2:01:02] you something there will always be
[2:01:06] somebody this world is full of spineless
[2:01:09] people
[2:01:12] there will always be somebody to agree
[2:01:14] with you and your disappointment there
[2:01:16] will always be somebody to agree with
[2:01:18] you and your in your in your
[2:01:19] contemplation in your in your musing
[2:01:23] in your evaluation
[2:01:25] of a situation you'll always be able to
[2:01:27] find somebody who will strengthen you in
[2:01:29] that and the way spirits work spirits
[2:01:32] draw people into fellowship
[2:01:35] with those of the same kind of a spirit
[2:01:37] and that's why you've got to be careful
[2:01:39] when you're choosing your personal
[2:01:40] fellowship that you choose it with
[2:01:43] someone who has victory
[2:01:46] where will i ever find somebody like
[2:01:48] that keep looking
[2:01:50] keep looking
[2:01:52] because if you've been listening to the
[2:01:54] voice of disappointment the last thing
[2:01:57] you need
[2:01:58] is two hours with somebody else that
[2:02:02] listens to the voice of disappointment
[2:02:05] you don't have to say man
[2:02:10] misery
[2:02:11] loves company
[2:02:15] discouragement loves to listen to other
[2:02:19] discouraged thoughts
[2:02:21] it just works that way it is a magnet
[2:02:26] our soulish inner voice starts agreeing
[2:02:28] with the voice of our own disappointment
[2:02:30] saying no one understands
[2:02:32] no one cares everyone is trying to keep
[2:02:35] me down nobody wants me to be what i'm
[2:02:37] really supposed to be
[2:02:40] it's not hard to see that the voice of
[2:02:41] disappointment does not like singing
[2:02:44] alone or if it's going to have power it
[2:02:47] has to have another voice to agree with
[2:02:49] it it looks first internally
[2:02:52] because you've all got an internal
[2:02:54] self-talk
[2:02:56] first it looks to see if it can find
[2:02:57] agreement in you and if that's a little
[2:02:59] iffy it starts drawing someone into your
[2:03:02] life who will speak the same kind of
[2:03:04] thoughts over you
[2:03:07] or in your presence or in your ear
[2:03:10] it needs an inner voice to line up with
[2:03:12] the storyline of constant disappointment
[2:03:16] there are people even under the sound of
[2:03:17] my voice who when they look back over
[2:03:19] their life they don't see victories
[2:03:23] there have been victories
[2:03:25] there have been mountaintops
[2:03:28] but because of a negativity bias
[2:03:31] it's easier for that kind of a person to
[2:03:34] see
[2:03:35] just the times of great
[2:03:38] disappointment
[2:03:43] i didn't get the man
[2:03:46] i didn't get the woman
[2:03:48] i didn't get the boy i didn't get the
[2:03:50] girl i didn't get the job
[2:03:55] nobody bragged on me
[2:03:58] i was underappreciated
[2:04:01] come on
[2:04:03] i say this as humble as i possibly know
[2:04:05] how to get it across while still having
[2:04:08] authority
[2:04:10] this is the enemy's trick
[2:04:13] and he doesn't care who he uses it on
[2:04:16] and i'm telling you if this message is
[2:04:19] right and i don't even like saying if
[2:04:22] but if this message is right
[2:04:24] then everything you need to overcome
[2:04:27] every enemy in your life is already in
[2:04:31] you by the power of the holy ghost and
[2:04:34] all you and i have to do is rise up and
[2:04:37] say no more
[2:04:39] [Applause]
[2:04:40] i will not agree with the voice of
[2:04:43] disappointment
[2:04:47] but i wanted the skinny wife
[2:04:54] well be careful what you say cause she
[2:04:56] wanted the handsome husband
[2:05:07] i want to die with the hair that i was
[2:05:09] born with
[2:05:17] it's all very disappointing
[2:05:22] i want to lose it so
[2:05:24] get so far separated from the weight i
[2:05:27] lose that i never ever ever ever see it
[2:05:29] again
[2:05:32] none of these things always turn out the
[2:05:35] way that we want them or expect them to
[2:05:38] turn out and the enemy the demons of
[2:05:40] hell monopolize on disappointment we all
[2:05:44] have disappointment
[2:05:45] some of you looked at me funny when i
[2:05:47] said i'm disappointed when i drink the
[2:05:48] last of the iced tea but that's a
[2:05:51] disappointment to me
[2:05:53] it's not one i particularly need to be
[2:05:54] delivered from we just need my wife
[2:05:56] needs to check the picture more often
[2:05:59] we could solve this problem
[2:06:01] when it's getting low you just buy
[2:06:03] another picture
[2:06:06] but there are real disappointments
[2:06:10] and i don't want to minimalize real ones
[2:06:14] by bringing out my little ones
[2:06:17] but neither do i want to expose myself
[2:06:21] by bringing out my real ones
[2:06:23] you understand don't you
[2:06:26] we all
[2:06:27] we all get disappointed
[2:06:30] life gives us things that we didn't see
[2:06:33] coming
[2:06:37] i think about every not just one or two
[2:06:40] i think about every man and wife who
[2:06:43] dream of getting old together
[2:06:46] and i think about how so many uh are
[2:06:48] cheated it seems out of that opportunity
[2:06:51] and so rapidly and so quickly that
[2:06:53] there's hardly enough time to say the
[2:06:55] things that you want to say listen
[2:06:57] what's happened with covet has happened
[2:06:59] in such a way
[2:07:01] that that one minute you could
[2:07:03] communicate and the next minute
[2:07:06] they're on a ventilator
[2:07:09] and there's no communication no ability
[2:07:11] i mean you stand there talking and
[2:07:12] hoping but there's no conversation
[2:07:15] and it's it's it's over
[2:07:17] and we know that most people that get on
[2:07:19] it do not come off of it this is what we
[2:07:21] know by statistics
[2:07:23] and so it seems to cheat people
[2:07:27] out of their last conversations
[2:07:31] and that feels very unfair
[2:07:35] to me
[2:07:36] but god
[2:07:38] is sovereign
[2:07:41] and he never
[2:07:43] makes a mistake
[2:07:45] and what you and i need to do is pray
[2:07:49] for those who miss that opportunity
[2:07:52] but we need to do something else we need
[2:07:55] to make sure
[2:07:56] that we don't miss
[2:07:59] that opportunity in our lives
[2:08:02] that we say today what needs to be said
[2:08:05] to our loved ones is anybody with me is
[2:08:08] this off am i off base now and saying
[2:08:10] this say it today
[2:08:15] say it today
[2:08:17] because you may never get the
[2:08:19] opportunity to say what needs to be said
[2:08:23] if you need to say i'm sorry bite the
[2:08:26] bullet and say it
[2:08:32] i watched a little film
[2:08:34] the other night with
[2:08:37] joshua it was just us at home
[2:08:40] we watched a little film together that
[2:08:41] he had seen before and i'd never seen
[2:08:44] and it was about a dad who
[2:08:47] did quite well in a particular sport
[2:08:51] but his son came along and was even
[2:08:53] doing better than he was doing and there
[2:08:55] was a struggle
[2:08:58] dads can have a struggle
[2:09:01] and it was so hard for that dad to say
[2:09:04] to his son i'm proud of you
[2:09:07] and there were a few moments where it
[2:09:09] became so obvious
[2:09:11] that he had to say it
[2:09:14] he would have looked like a complete
[2:09:16] idiot not to say it so on a few rare
[2:09:19] occasions he was able to squeeze out the
[2:09:22] words
[2:09:23] to say i'm proud of what you've
[2:09:25] accomplished
[2:09:29] well the young man dies at the age of 25
[2:09:33] doing the sport that he loves
[2:09:37] the dad is sitting in the room weeping
[2:09:41] stoic
[2:09:43] guy who seemed to never have any emotion
[2:09:45] and now he's weeping
[2:09:48] his wife comes in to put her hand on his
[2:09:50] shoulder to comfort him a bit and
[2:09:53] he says i i did
[2:09:56] i did tell him a time or two on occasion
[2:09:59] i did tell him
[2:10:01] that he had done a good job and i was
[2:10:02] proud of him
[2:10:03] but he said i'm just sitting here trying
[2:10:05] to think
[2:10:07] i've been sitting here for the longest
[2:10:09] time
[2:10:10] trying to think
[2:10:15] because i'm such an emotional watcher i
[2:10:17] can't watch too many things
[2:10:20] because i'm sitting there saying oh no
[2:10:23] oh no
[2:10:27] i knew the storyline i knew it
[2:10:30] i knew what was about to happen
[2:10:33] i knew what he was fixing to say and i
[2:10:35] said oh no no no no no
[2:10:42] he said but i realize i cannot remember
[2:10:45] a single time that i told him i love
[2:10:50] you
[2:11:05] he doesn't get another chance
[2:11:10] only eternity
[2:11:12] could afford him another opportunity
[2:11:15] to say
[2:11:18] that stubborn old man
[2:11:22] that stubborn old man
[2:11:25] hung on his own pride
[2:11:28] afraid to to to feel like a a woman
[2:11:34] felt like if he showed much emotion he
[2:11:36] would be like a woman
[2:11:40] and he missed the opportunity to say the
[2:11:42] very thing that his son needed to hear
[2:11:44] the most
[2:11:47] because he lived every day of those 25
[2:11:49] years trying to please his dad to get to
[2:11:52] a place where his dad would give him
[2:11:55] approval and then he goes out of here
[2:11:57] never having the opportunity to hear the
[2:12:00] words that he needed to hear more than
[2:12:03] all the attaboys
[2:12:09] doesn't have to be that way
[2:12:12] you and i can say what needs to be said
[2:12:15] while we have an opportunity to say it i
[2:12:17] wish somebody would help me
[2:12:20] we can say what needs to be said now
[2:12:23] while we have breath to say it with
[2:12:25] because life is going to be filled with
[2:12:28] more disappointments
[2:12:31] it's not disappointments that i'm
[2:12:33] preaching against
[2:12:35] they come
[2:12:37] we can't prevent them from coming
[2:12:40] i'm preaching against listening
[2:12:43] to the voice of disappointment
[2:12:47] to the voice that says what if
[2:12:50] it could have been
[2:12:52] it should have been
[2:12:54] it ought to have been
[2:12:56] but it wasn't
[2:12:58] that's a voice that'll pull you out of a
[2:13:01] place where you can hear the voice of
[2:13:03] god
[2:13:04] that's a voice that will pull you into a
[2:13:06] place where your life and your home and
[2:13:09] your family is filled with confusion
[2:13:12] and there is no joy there is no voice of
[2:13:14] joy help me
[2:13:17] there is no voice of triumph no voice of
[2:13:19] victory
[2:13:38] that voice of disappointment
[2:13:40] it needs my inner voice
[2:13:43] to line up with the storyline of the
[2:13:45] constant disappointments of my life
[2:13:49] it seeks to highlight reference points
[2:13:51] from my past
[2:13:53] to confirm in my own head my
[2:13:55] victimization
[2:13:57] it seeks to put others in an awkward
[2:13:59] position of feeling pressured to agree
[2:14:01] with me
[2:14:03] in my disappointment
[2:14:08] this disappointment seeks to fully
[2:14:10] control our emotions
[2:14:12] leading to discouragement depression
[2:14:15] or worse
[2:14:21] what could possibly be so wrong
[2:14:24] in a 12 year old's life
[2:14:27] you saw the news
[2:14:31] 12 years old
[2:14:37] already gone
[2:14:39] hospital
[2:14:41] dad's
[2:14:43] head on his chest thank you
[2:14:46] mom's head on his lifeless body
[2:14:53] what disappointment could be so severe
[2:14:57] what curiosity could be so great
[2:15:01] that would bring a 12 year old to that
[2:15:03] to that point in his life
[2:15:05] and the world is full of people hurting
[2:15:07] just like that
[2:15:15] when you're disappointed you feel stuck
[2:15:19] how do you know i
[2:15:20] know because i've been there and i've
[2:15:23] wondered
[2:15:24] what have i done wrong why do i deserve
[2:15:26] such pain and frustration why are other
[2:15:29] people excelling while i seem to be
[2:15:31] standing still
[2:15:33] if you recognize any of that at all
[2:15:35] you'll recognize it to be the voice
[2:15:37] that disappointment talks with in our
[2:15:39] lives
[2:15:40] we've learned to temporarily push down
[2:15:42] the voice of disappointment in order to
[2:15:44] function in everyday living however
[2:15:46] there's only one way to confront the
[2:15:48] voice of disappointment in your mind in
[2:15:50] your soul and that is to plunge it
[2:15:52] beneath the blood of jesus christ and
[2:15:55] make a choice to listen to another voice
[2:15:58] his voice
[2:16:00] the voice of truth
[2:16:04] you give me job chapter eight i need
[2:16:05] just a few more minutes this morning job

[2:16:13] we'll save the time i usually read it in
[2:16:15] both

[2:16:20] uphold wrongdoers
[2:16:22] he will never cast away a blameless man

[2:17:18] you don't want to laugh you don't want
[2:17:20] to smile
[2:17:22] you don't want anybody to misunderstand
[2:17:25] your existence

[2:18:15] feel this morning that you could ever
[2:18:19] be a real praiser again
[2:18:23] there's some of you who feel so low
[2:18:27] that you can't see a way out

[2:18:34] joy of laughing in the spirit

[2:20:12] rivers of living water he'll laugh out
[2:20:15] of you he'll express joy out of you if

[2:23:04] but i saw lisa back there waving her
[2:23:07] hands

[2:23:14] i thought it was somebody else it
[2:23:16] doesn't matter who she is she's welcome
[2:23:17] to do that here
[2:23:21] if i knew lisa i don't know her but if i
[2:23:23] knew lisa i'd probably find out she's
[2:23:25] had disappointments
[2:23:29] if i knew lisa i would probably find out
[2:23:32] she's had heartaches
[2:23:34] have you honey
[2:23:37] she's been through some stuff
[2:23:39] but you'd have never known it this
[2:23:40] morning the way she was waving her arm
[2:23:42] ah
[2:23:45] [Music]
[2:23:54] believe i will
[2:23:56] psalms 30 11 in the amplified says you

[2:24:06] 3011.
[2:24:11] you have turned my morning into dancing
[2:24:13] for me
[2:24:15] [Applause]
[2:24:17] you have put off my sackcloth and girded
[2:24:20] me with gladness
[2:24:23] this is somebody that had mourned this
[2:24:26] is somebody that had lost this is
[2:24:28] somebody who had suffered this is
[2:24:30] somebody who was filled with
[2:24:31] disappointment and yet now
[2:24:34] you've turned my morning in the day
[2:24:40] how many of you know who john calvin was
[2:24:42] i need a few more minutes thank you
[2:24:50] john calvin a great leader
[2:24:53] great theologian
[2:25:02] but a very disappointing person
[2:25:04] in certain areas
[2:25:08] he was a spiritual leader in geneva
[2:25:13] he tried constantly to control people's
[2:25:16] outward behavior in the house of god
[2:25:23] he banned music
[2:25:26] he banned musical instruments
[2:25:29] all forms of entertainment
[2:25:33] he banned gambling drinking dancing and
[2:25:35] a modest dress i appreciate that
[2:25:40] but he also banned all outward displays
[2:25:42] of joy
[2:25:45] sister joyce
[2:25:48] he banned bright clothing
[2:25:54] shoshana
[2:26:00] jaya's not here
[2:26:03] but she told me one time i like colors
[2:26:05] when you talk about sister joyce liking
[2:26:07] bright colors i like bright colors too
[2:26:09] well john calvin wouldn't have
[2:26:10] appreciated that
[2:26:12] he believed a good christian ought to
[2:26:14] wear black or navy blue
[2:26:20] and one man was fined
[2:26:24] because he smiled at the baptism of his
[2:26:26] child
[2:26:28] this is church history
[2:26:33] think about it
[2:26:35] there's not much joy in that kind of an
[2:26:37] atmosphere
[2:26:40] he had some things right but he had some
[2:26:42] things wrong
[2:26:44] because and look folks you have license
[2:26:47] and liberty to use your voice in this
[2:26:50] house and some of you still
[2:26:53] would rather john calvin be your pastor
[2:26:58] [Applause]
[2:27:00] and to shout with me
[2:27:04] he's been too good
[2:27:07] too good to me
[2:27:12] when my granny passed away she said i
[2:27:14] want you all to sing happy songs
[2:27:18] i want you to sing when the home gates
[2:27:20] swing open for me
[2:27:22] because she said by the time you all are
[2:27:24] singing that the gates will have already
[2:27:27] opened up and swallowed me into eternity
[2:27:30] she said i want you to sing lord
[2:27:33] you've been too
[2:27:35] good to me
[2:27:39] lord you've been too
[2:27:42] good to me
[2:27:46] first you saved my soul from hell
[2:27:51] now you made my body well
[2:27:55] i thank you lord you've been too good
[2:28:01] to
[2:28:02] me
[2:28:06] she had disappointment
[2:28:10] just like you
[2:28:12] so many people have lost their shout
[2:28:16] and they lost their shout because they
[2:28:18] lost their joy that's what brother
[2:28:19] branham said
[2:28:21] you lost your shout because you lost
[2:28:22] your joy
[2:28:24] they're so quiet in church
[2:28:26] they resent being instructed encouraged
[2:28:29] begged pleaded with
[2:28:32] to do anything different than that
[2:28:35] they're caught in a in a
[2:28:37] grave
[2:28:38] which is a rut with both ends cut out of
[2:28:41] it
[2:28:42] and when there's an opportunity to move
[2:28:44] in the presence of the lord and see what
[2:28:47] god will do
[2:28:49] rarely do some people ever put their big
[2:28:52] toe in the water
[2:29:01] john calvin is their pastor
[2:29:05] isaiah 49
[2:29:07] 40
[2:29:08] verse 9
[2:29:10] o zion
[2:29:13] that bring us good tidings
[2:29:16] get thee up into the mountain o
[2:29:18] jerusalem
[2:29:20] that bring us good tidings lift up
[2:29:24] thy
[2:29:25] voice
[2:29:26] with strength
[2:29:29] he's prophesying to a people that have
[2:29:31] been in bondage
[2:29:32] he's prophesying to a people that have
[2:29:34] been in slavery
[2:29:36] he's prophesying to a people that have
[2:29:38] been in exile
[2:29:40] anybody listening
[2:29:42] and yet he said oh scion
[2:29:46] lift up thy
[2:29:48] voice with strength
[2:29:52] too loud
[2:29:56] lift it up be not afraid
[2:29:58] say unto the cities of judah behold
[2:30:04] your god
[2:30:08] you're still with me
[2:30:10] we're closing
[2:30:13] psalm 511
[2:30:16] amplified
[2:30:18] but let all those who take refuge
[2:30:21] and put their trust in you rejoice
[2:30:25] let them ever sing
[2:30:27] and shout for joy
[2:30:30] because you make a covering over them
[2:30:32] and defend them let those also who love
[2:30:35] your name be joyful in you
[2:30:47] read it again brother granny
[2:30:58] i can see why you would resent this
[2:31:00] message
[2:31:02] if it was being given to you by someone
[2:31:04] that had never had a reason to be sad
[2:31:07] but because i'm one of you because i
[2:31:09] live in the same world you live in
[2:31:11] face the same battles you face i know
[2:31:13] what pain's like
[2:31:15] i know what disappointment's like
[2:31:17] i know what heartache is like
[2:31:20] but i know one thing giving in to that
[2:31:22] voice of disappointment will never get
[2:31:24] you anything
[2:31:26] but a little cheap sympathy that doesn't
[2:31:28] go very far when you're already under
[2:31:30] the water
[2:31:32] there's only one thing that will ever
[2:31:34] bring you out of that kind of a place
[2:31:36] and that is the moment the very minute
[2:31:40] that you make up your mind i
[2:31:43] will not agree with this voice of
[2:31:47] disappointments
[2:31:49] there's something else in me that has a
[2:31:52] voice
[2:31:56] because you make a covering over them
[2:32:01] and defend them let those also who love
[2:32:04] your name
[2:32:06] be joyful
[2:32:15] any good
[2:32:17] now give me just a moment
[2:32:20] christ knocking at the door
[2:32:22] we're closing
[2:32:26] don't you just love to worship
[2:32:34] don't you just love to worship the
[2:32:35] messages sometimes they're so cutting
[2:32:37] with the word
[2:32:38] but then you know after we've all been
[2:32:40] corrected and stand guiltless in the
[2:32:42] presence of the father resting upon the
[2:32:44] grace of the lord jesus i just love to
[2:32:47] raise my hands and worship him he said
[2:32:51] don't you like to do that how many
[2:32:53] believes in that raise up your hands oh
[2:32:56] my
[2:32:58] just worship him in song
[2:33:03] paragraph 268 of patmos vision
[2:33:07] do you love him you know after the
[2:33:09] message is cutting and everything
[2:33:11] i like to hear people get into the hymns
[2:33:13] and go to worshipping and singing in the
[2:33:16] spirit
[2:33:18] there's nothing more prettier than good
[2:33:19] old singing that's right
[2:33:23] boy you'd upset some folks in some
[2:33:26] places if you were to get excited on a
[2:33:28] song
[2:33:31] not them overtrained voices that holds
[2:33:33] till they're squeaking and turn blue in
[2:33:35] the face and don't know what they're
[2:33:37] singing
[2:33:38] i like somebody that maybe couldn't
[2:33:40] carry a tune in a basket but yet he's
[2:33:42] got a pentecostal blessing
[2:33:44] now he's singing about it how glorious
[2:33:46] those melodious songs of the cross
[2:33:49] oh my
[2:33:52] in the message the patmos vision
[2:33:55] from the church age book
[2:33:58] he said have you ever noticed how the
[2:34:00] world gets into the spirit of things in
[2:34:02] the world
[2:34:04] they go to their ball games their
[2:34:06] sporting events and their dances
[2:34:09] they enter into the spirit of it
[2:34:14] musicians would you come and help me
[2:34:20] they enter into the spirit of it
[2:34:24] they don't sit there like wall flowers
[2:34:28] oh dried up sticks
[2:34:33] just reading
[2:34:35] they enter right into the feel of things
[2:34:39] and become a part of things
[2:34:43] he didn't seem to be saying there's
[2:34:45] anything wrong with that
[2:34:47] if i'm reading it right
[2:34:50] but oh how they hate the christians
[2:34:53] for getting into the spirit of god's
[2:34:55] word
[2:34:57] they call us fanatics and holy rollers
[2:35:00] there's nothing they won't do to show
[2:35:01] their hatred and disapproval but ignore
[2:35:03] that
[2:35:04] but ignore that
[2:35:06] you can expect it knowing where it's
[2:35:08] coming from just go on
[2:35:13] and get in the spirit
[2:35:15] of worship
[2:35:23] you see in africa where they believe
[2:35:25] this same message that we do
[2:35:28] in many places where i have been
[2:35:31] they have refused to let
[2:35:33] the american and canadian preachers
[2:35:36] steal
[2:35:37] their joy
[2:35:42] they just worship anyway
[2:35:47] they just dance anyway
[2:35:50] they just give god glory anyway
[2:35:53] i've been preaching in ghana where the
[2:35:54] crowd was so large there was no way to
[2:35:56] get the message to the back of the
[2:35:58] building
[2:35:59] and out from under the building that it
[2:36:01] was time to stop worshiping and go
[2:36:03] forward in the service so they had a big
[2:36:05] old bell under the platform
[2:36:10] and when it was time to move on so that
[2:36:12] everybody could hear even prayer if you
[2:36:14] don't stop them when they start praying
[2:36:16] they'll pray on
[2:36:19] and you've got to move on into service
[2:36:20] so they'll raise up that bell and sound
[2:36:22] that bell and
[2:36:26] it lets everybody out there know we're
[2:36:28] moving on in the service it's not
[2:36:29] rebuking them it's saying we have
[2:36:33] we've accomplished something
[2:36:36] now we're moving on to something else
[2:36:38] but if we're not careful white preachers
[2:36:40] will go over there and try to cause
[2:36:43] those people to worship like cold
[2:36:46] dry
[2:36:47] dead starchy white folks
[2:36:58] and they'll come around in ministers
[2:36:59] meetings and they'll say to me well them
[2:37:01] people don't know any better
[2:37:04] i'm so glad to tell you that they don't
[2:37:07] know any better i'm so sorry to say that
[2:37:11] some of you have learned better
[2:37:15] because there's nothing any better than
[2:37:18] getting in the spirit of worship
[2:37:22] and worshiping the king
[2:37:26] our spirit is clean it is fresh it is
[2:37:29] real it is sober and serious but
[2:37:32] nonetheless
[2:37:34] full of the joy of the lord the
[2:37:36] christian ought to be just as exuberant
[2:37:40] and full of his pleasure in the lord as
[2:37:43] the world is
[2:37:44] when it savors and delights in its
[2:37:47] pleasures
[2:37:49] i believe he means get in the spirit of
[2:37:51] it don't you
[2:37:52] both christians and the world are human
[2:37:54] both have emotions the differences of
[2:37:56] christians hearts and emotions are
[2:37:58] purely on the lord of glory and his love
[2:38:01] while the world
[2:38:03] satisfies the flesh
[2:38:06] just one more i know it's late
[2:38:08] and give out
[2:38:10] but just one more
[2:38:14] why it had to be shepherd
[2:38:16] he said i've seen jumping spells joy
[2:38:19] spells
[2:38:21] but there was nobody hurt
[2:38:26] the mountains rung out and the sun went
[2:38:28] down and everything took place but there
[2:38:30] was nobody hurt
[2:38:32] and i've seen meetings where the power
[2:38:34] of god was revealed to the people that
[2:38:35] they were free from the world
[2:38:38] and the things of the world
[2:38:40] and the joy of the lord filled the
[2:38:42] congregation
[2:38:44] they stood and screamed and cried and
[2:38:48] shouted to the top of their voice
[2:38:51] for the glory of god
[2:38:53] i never did see anything disorderly
[2:38:58] they were always right in order
[2:39:01] because they had recognized that their
[2:39:03] name
[2:39:05] that had been written in the lamb's book
[2:39:06] of life before the foundation of the
[2:39:08] world listen the great prophet shepherd
[2:39:11] had brought them the message and they
[2:39:12] were delivered
[2:39:15] a prophet shepherd no matter what the
[2:39:16] other ecclesiastical realms said about
[2:39:19] it they knew what had happened
[2:39:22] just as them shepherds did back there
[2:39:24] they knowed what took place
[2:39:28] let's stand to our feet
[2:39:31] possessing all things brother branham
[2:39:33] said i wished i had joy brother branham
[2:39:35] i wished i had joy somebody's talking to
[2:39:37] him he said you can have it
[2:39:41] you're
[2:39:42] just letting satan listen
[2:39:46] you're just letting satan rob you from
[2:39:50] the privileges that christ
[2:39:53] died
[2:39:54] for
[2:39:57] i'm an heir to it it's all mine
[2:40:00] everything he died for belongs to me
[2:40:02] belongs to you we're his children we're
[2:40:04] heirs of it everything that he died for
[2:40:06] listen folks
[2:40:08] there's not a person under the sound of
[2:40:10] my voice that hasn't suffered great
[2:40:12] disappointments in their life and a
[2:40:15] multitude of small ones along the way
[2:40:19] you may be disappointed when you get
[2:40:21] home today and find your lunch all
[2:40:23] shrunk up in the oven
[2:40:28] but you have a choice to make in this
[2:40:30] life as a child of god
[2:40:33] you can agree with that voice of
[2:40:34] disappointment and continue to attract
[2:40:36] those kinds of things into your life
[2:40:39] until you fall beneath the surface
[2:40:42] hardly able to get a finger up out of
[2:40:44] the water or you can make up your mind
[2:40:46] like i told my children who asked me
[2:40:47] this week
[2:40:50] it only takes a made-up mind
[2:40:52] and we have to keep making it up and
[2:40:54] making it up and making it up and making
[2:40:57] it up and making it maybe the old-timers
[2:40:59] weren't clear enough when they told us
[2:41:01] you have to make up your mind and choose
[2:41:03] the lord maybe they needed to tell us
[2:41:05] that you have to keep choosing and keep
[2:41:06] choosing and keep choosing and keep
[2:41:08] choosing because you do
[2:41:12] every time the voice of disappointment
[2:41:14] says looky here
[2:41:16] here we go again
[2:41:20] you have to choose in that moment to
[2:41:23] silence that voice
[2:41:25] and yield to another voice that's within
[2:41:28] you and let joy have something to say
[2:41:31] and remember joy is not based on
[2:41:33] circumstances or condition it's based on
[2:41:35] a revealed truth something that's been
[2:41:37] made real to your heart the devil didn't
[2:41:40] give it to you
[2:41:43] the devil didn't give it to you
[2:41:47] and the devil can't take it away
[2:41:56] lord we love you
[2:41:59] we love you today hallelujah
[2:42:02] we love you today jesus we thank you for
[2:42:04] how
[2:42:05] you have ministered to us we thank you
[2:42:07] for the strength that you've given us
[2:42:10] to hear your word today we thank you
[2:42:12] lord for calling our attention to the
[2:42:14] fact that we
[2:42:15] have often listened to the voice of
[2:42:17] disappointment
[2:42:20] instead of choosing your voice the voice
[2:42:22] of truth
[2:42:25] letting a little bit of joy
[2:42:28] push all the darkness out and push all
[2:42:31] the disappointment out
[2:42:33] and enter into the spirit of worship
[2:42:35] lord
[2:42:37] help us i pray
[2:42:39] for every person under the sound of my
[2:42:41] voice who has struggled o god with the
[2:42:44] voice of disappointment
[2:42:48] who's lived under the heavy burden of
[2:42:50] hope deferred and who has not yet broken
[2:42:53] through the surface
[2:42:56] to speak words of faith and victory
[2:43:00] i pray today lord that you will lift
[2:43:02] them higher
[2:43:04] that you will pull them stronger
[2:43:07] that you will encourage them deeper
[2:43:11] until they are able lord to do what your
[2:43:15] words said there's a way to get out
[2:43:18] there's a way to cross over there's a
[2:43:20] way to overcome there's a way to rise
[2:43:23] above
[2:43:26] there's a voice to be listened to
[2:43:29] there's a voice to yield to
[2:43:34] it's time lord jesus for us your
[2:43:36] children
[2:43:37] to be caught up in the spirit of praise
[2:43:40] and worship and leave the elements of
[2:43:43] this old world behind
[2:43:46] as we enter into a higher place
[2:43:49] with you

[2:44:24] thousand warriors

[2:45:52] to step out of my comfort zone
[2:45:56] until the realm of the unknown where
[2:45:59] jesus is
[2:46:02] and he's holding out his hand
