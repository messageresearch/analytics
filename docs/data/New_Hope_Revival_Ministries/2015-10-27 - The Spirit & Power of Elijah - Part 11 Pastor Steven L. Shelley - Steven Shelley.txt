TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Well, hello there. I'm Pastor Steven Shel and you're watching The Eagles Cry. And I want to thank you for doing that. I hope you'll stay tuned. We're going to soon come to a conclusion on our series that we've been working on for weeks now. Maybe you're tired of the subject. You're ready to move on to something else. But I just feel like it's a very important and timely study that we've been engaged in. And I believe the Lord will certainly use it. Uh hopefully you'll get an opportunity to see some of the episodes again at some point because I want this to get deep in your spirit because I believe that many of us are a part of this commission to be anointed with the spirit and power of Elijah to help prepare the earth for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want to remind you that we have a an amazing website revival.org revival.org org and we invite you to visit that website and take advantage of a lot of the free resources that we have, articles to read and visions and things that we've been sharing over the course of a good many years now. And I believe you'll be blessed. I think it's a good way for you and I to stay in touch. You can send us an email with your prayer request or a little note to let us know that you're watching this program. And that is a tremendous encouragement to us to keep doing what we do for the kingdom of God. I want to thank those of you who have already sent in your prayer needs and have already let us know that you're out there on the other end of this camera and you're watching this and you're blessed. And that is a great encouragement to us. I want us to read again uh today Malachi 4:es 5 and 6. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Last week we talked about the fact that when the angel of the Lord came to Zachcharias the father of John the Baptist and spoke to him about the ministry commission of John the Baptist. He specifically tell told him in Luke 1 verse 17 that he shall go he being John the Baptist shall go before him being the Lord Jesus in the spirit and power of Elias. But I want to remind you that when it came time for him to identify the ministry of John the Baptist in the Bible, he referred back to Malachi's prophecy, but only quoted a portion of it to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. What about the rest? The children to the fathers. Instead, he said, "And the disobedient to the wisdom of the just." And many say, "Well, that is referring to that other part, children back to the fathers." But I think that it was more intentional than that. I don't think the angel misqued the prophecy. I think he was giving us a key. Even like the Lord gave us a key in Matthew chapter 17. Let's glance back there really quick. The Lord gave us a key because the disciples asked him, "Why are the scribes saying that Elias must first come?" And Jesus answered in in verse 11, Matthew 17, Elias truly shall first come, future tense, and restore all things. But I say unto you, he has come already, and they knew him not. And they did to him whatsoever they listed, speaking of John the Baptist. So there's no doubt in my mind that when the Lord said Elias is come already, he was connecting the ministry of John the Baptist with the prophecy of Malachi concerning the spirit and power of Elijah. No doubt about it. But when he was speaking still in the future tense, he was speaking about another installment, another visitation of the spirit and power of Elijah. And when that when that application came, when that installment was to come, it would be about restoring all things. The ministry of John the Baptist was about building a bridge uh as a forerunner so that those who had held to the instructions of Moses, they needed some help in being able to see that what God was doing in this other generation, we could save the children. what God was doing in the second temple period when the Lord Jesus came as Messiah. It wasn't easy for the old-timers to be able to look ahead and say, "Hey, this is finally it." They waited and waited and waited and waited. And yet, when it finally came, they they had a little trouble and they needed the ministry of John the Baptist. And I did a study not too long ago and went all the way through the Bible and and through the gospels and looked at all the times that the scripture said and many believed and many believed and many believed and many believed and it was so outstanding of how many people really began to believe and accept that the Lord Jesus was the Messiah. Many more much more than what we have come to understand in in church. You know, we think about all of the Jews rejecting uh the Lord Jesus as Messiah, and that's just not the case at all. There were multitudes of them who were able to identify the ministry of the Lord Jesus as Messiah. And part of that was because of the great ministry of John the Baptist. So, thank God for what he did, but he did not restore all things. much much would need to be restored at a later time. There's no doubt about that. And uh another part of the commission of John the Baptist under the spirit and power of Elijah was to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. I want to thank God for what John the Baptist was able to accomplish. And I also want to look forward. I want to see uh if I can identify other applications or installments of the spirit and power of Elijah. You know, there are other scriptures that we could read about the ministry of John the Baptist. But what I would like to to speak to you about now, as we ended the broadcast last week, we talked about uh we well actually we asked a question and we didn't answer it. We said, uh, how important was it for people of that time period, uh, to recognize that John the Baptist was not just an ordinary preacher, but that he had truly come in the anointing in the spirit and power of Elijah and what his commission was all about, fulfilling a portion of Malachi's prophecy. What did it matter whether people received him as such or looked at him as just another preacher like people would do today? Uh why is that important? Well, I want to show you or even is it important? Well, I want to show you what the scripture said in Luke 7 and verse 29 and 30. I think it is important. He said, "And all the people that heard him and the publicans justified God being baptized with the baptism of John." Now, that means that there were a lot of people, including the publicans that recognized the ministry that John had come to fulfill. But verse 30 said, "But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the council of God against themselves, being not baptized of him." Now, do you understand the the significance of that language? Many of the people that heard him and the publicans justified God, gave God praise and legitimacy being baptized, obeying what John compelled the people to do, and that was to have a baptism unto repentance. But on the other hand, many did not. Pharisees and lawyers are particularly mentioned here. They rejected the council of God. They didn't justify God. They didn't obey the words of the Lord in the mouth of John the Baptist. Why? Because they discounted them. Because they said, "It's not important to believe him. We have Moses. We have the instruction. We have the law. We don't have to listen to what John the Baptist says. Who is he after all?" Many said, "Wait a minute. This man speaks with an unusual speech. Thi there is something prophetic about this ministry." And they went to the water and obeyed his instruction. But the others said nothing to it. And it says that they rejected the council of God against themselves, refusing to be baptized of John. Why are you bringing it out like that, pastor? Well, I'm bringing it out that way because I want you to know that it is important. It does matter whether or not we honor and respect and recognize the messengers that God sends to us. especially when we're trying to identify the spirit and power of Elijah. It is important. It's not just a a common event that we can uh miss. And it doesn't matter if we miss it. It's important for us. That's why we've spent so much time looking at the characteristics of the man who first had the spirit and power. It's important for us to look at his life. so that we can then identify those characteristics and traits in other people's lives. I want to tell you that I believe if John the Baptist fulfilled the first part of Malachi's prophecy, turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, there would have to be another application. There would have to be another uh installment of that spirit and power of Elijah that would turn the hearts of the children to their fathers. We've got the fathers turned to the children. But Malachi said, "And the hearts of the children to their fathers." What I believe we have here is a promise of another coming of the spirit and power of Elijah. And I believe that this was already forerun in the earth a generation ago. And many people were able to recognize that God was doing a great work in helping to prepare his bride. and others quickly rejected it because it didn't seem to be in the same flow of their tradition. And you know, that's where we all get into trouble when we are so staunch in our tradition that we miss what the Holy Spirit is trying to do sometimes in what looks like a new way. Now remember Jesus is the one who said uh Elias truly shall first come but he has indeed already come. This is our Lord explaining Malachi's prophecy. Yes, he has already come in John the Baptist fulfilling a portion of that. But yes, he shall come. I believe that there was a fulfillment of that word a generation ago. And I think it would would be interesting to look at it and see because if there was a generation ago an application of that spirit and power of Elijah, it would help us to know how to position ourselves, what to look for in an hour when God begins to pour that out on his corporate bride. And then the scripture tells us there will be another fulfillment, another installment during the great tribulation, the last years of the great wrath when two witnesses will rise up. One having the spirit and ministry of Moses, another having the spirit and ministry of Elijah. In order to help uh sort of prepare you, I'm just going to share my perspective here. I want you to take note. This is what the spirit of God has made real to me. I'm not here to persuade you of anything beyond scripture. But I want to share with you a testimony that I think is a very important testimony. Something that God did in the earth one generation ago. It is this is 2015. One generation ago, God did some outstanding things in the earth uh in the spirit and power of Elijah. I believe that um I think that the Christian history tells us that there have been some who have come along the way especially after Isusa Street who had outstanding ministries and many of those men actually claimed to be the Elijah that was to come and that Elijah that is to come is still out there in the future. that is referring to one of the two witnesses or the two olive branches as Zachariah called them. Uh and so there were some along the way actually quite a few who got so caught up in what they were seeing happening in their ministry uh that somehow they stepped into error and began to claim I am the Elijah to come. You have to follow me. And this is very spooky and it's it's really a dangerous vein for people to flow in. And you know what I'm about to read to you is a ministry that God used mightily in the earth a generation ago. And because of God using that ministry so mightily, others have come along and said, "Well, he thought he was the Elijah." Well, I want to assure you that is an error. The man that I'm about to read this testimony of did not believe that he was the Elijah. I think perhaps that somewhere in his ministry he began to recognize that what God was doing through him was of an extraordinary measure. I I don't doubt that at all. But I do not believe and I've heard hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, I'm not exaggerating, of his sermons and have never heard him say that he felt like he was the Elijah. Let me read this testimony to you and at least consider these things. It was on Sunday, June the 11th of 1933. That was a long time ago, that a most amazing and documented phenomenon occurred. William Brham was 24 years of age and had just completed his first tent campaign in a city called Jeffersonville in the state of Indiana. This had run for two weeks and about 130 candidates were awaiting baptism in the Ohio River at the foot of Spring Street, Jeffersonville, Indiana, before a crowd of about 3,000 that had gathered on the riverbank to watch. I stumbled a bit in my reading, but it was uh uh in the Ohio River. That's where the baptism took place at the foot of Spring Street. Again, in the city of Jeffersonville, Indiana, about 3,000 people, the article says, were standing on the banks watching this baptism take place. It had not rained for some 3 weeks, and the day was hot and the sky was clear. At about 2:00 in the afternoon, as William Brham prepared to baptize Edward Kulvin, the 17th candidate for baptism, he heard within him a small voice that spoke to him and said, "Look up." It repeated this twice more. And when he gazed upward, high above him in the clear sky, an area about 15 ft square could be seen churning as the waves were rolling across it. Immediately a bright pulsating star appeared from within the disturbance and lowered itself with a whoosh to hang just above the young minister's head. Do I have your attention yet? Well, that sounds like an outstanding event. Wouldn't you have liked to have been standing there to watch God do something like that? Such a supernatural sign. It was a few seconds before brother Brandham could cry out in alarm, causing the bystanders to then look up themselves and also notice this star or light. Some screamed while others fainted or ran for fear. Now, I don't know how I would have reacted, but I know I would have reacted somehow if I was standing there witnessing something like this. Brother Brham had seen the light many times before, he said, but had seldom spoke about it to others because he found that very few people could believe such a testimony. Maybe some of you are having a hard time believing such a testimony. In his own words, he said, "It nearly scared me to death." And then what happened next was even more outstanding than that. A voice thundered out and spoke over the crowd, saying, "As John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming of Christ, you are sent with a message that will forerun his second coming." Now either this is a a a true supernatural outstanding event or someone is telling us a fib. When this was through this pillar of fire, this star was received up into a small white cloud that had formed in the area of churning sky high above the river. The sequence of events occupied only a minute but would lead to the most dynamic and extensive divine healing revival ever experienced by mankind. Now wait a minute. Are you telling me that this event took place there on that day in in on the Ohio River? A star came, a voice spoke out. Okay. But that wasn't the end of the story. You're now telling me that one of the greatest revivals of divine healing in the history of the world took place after this event? Yes. I'm here to tell you that there are thousands and thousands of documented healings that took place over the course of the next 2530 years in the ministry of this man. They came by the thousands to be healed. It was an outstanding ministry. And to me, this adds even more credibility to this witness testimony of what took place that day on the Ohio River. If you're going to tell a supernatural event like this, there needs to be some fruit behind it. Amen. Some miracles behind it. Souls being saved and lives being changed. And we certainly have the historical record to say this was the truth. This happened. Brother Brandham reported that the event that we just read to you was featured in a local newspaper and a man by the name of Dr. Lee Vale stated that news organizations picked up this story what took place there on the Ohio River and circulated around the US. In fact, it went out all over the world. One headline read, "Mysterious light appears over Baptist minister while baptizing in the Ohio River." Now, somebody believed this testimony. That doesn't mean everything we read in the newspaper is so or true, but this had such credibility that it went out through the world in the news. I think that's pretty outstanding. Just as the Lord Jesus had presented himself to John the Baptist in the River Jordan in order that he could be baptized before beginning his public ministry, it appears so that in 1933 he publicly commissioned a forerunning ministry while he was baptizing in the Ohio River to begin a ministry that would deliver a message to forrun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now I tell you that's an outstanding event and I'm I'm aware of many many other testimonies of how God worked in such an outstanding and supernatural way in the life of brother William Brham. In fact there is a famous photograph of the pillar of fire that came and hung over brother Brandham's head in the in the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston, Texas. uh as a debate was going on about whether divine healing was real or not. And that photograph has was taken. It was examined and proven to be uh something that couldn't be explained. Uh they looked at and said it couldn't be just a a glare of a light or some kind of uh anomaly like that. There had to be some something of an unusual nature. I want to say supernatural nature. Some people have called that a halo over brother Brandham's head no that was a witness of the pillar of fire just letting people know this there's something to this and uh interestingly enough uh over00 recorded sermons remain today of of this humble ministry that God vindicated time and time again he would stand up in prayer lines and by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he was able to see right into the secrets of men's hearts. God doing it through him. Calling people by name, calling their doctor's name, calling out their disease, sometimes even their street address, phone number, doctor's name. It went on and on and on every time. What it was, it was Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. It was God showing the people that exactly what Jesus did when he was in his earthly body because of the power of the Holy Ghost available in us that we also can have a portion of that ministry that was none other than the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, because I believe that this humble man, Brother Brandham, came in the same spirit, the same power, the same anointing as John the Baptist or as Elijah or Elisha. I think that if you begin to be curious, you ought to do some research. You ought to dig a little bit and find out more about this anointed ministry. And if you write us, if you contact us, we'll point you in the right direction. We'll help you find out more because if he was given a message, that was what the commission said. You will be given a message that will go out and help prepare the the bride to help forerrun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then it would behoove me, it would be it would be compelling to me to look into that message, see what's there. And I have I want you to know I have spent many years since 1988 studying the ministry and the message that God gave William Brandom. And I know that it is a message sent from God to help prepare a bride to be ready for the resurrection. And so I encourage you to look into that. That being said, I also believe that God wants to anoint this generation with a double portion of that same kind of an anointing that rested on that man's ministry. Doesn't that sound good? How many of you'd like to come into that kind of a double portion spirit and power of Elijah? I believe it's available. Pray about it. Ask the Lord to make that real in your life. Contact us if you want more information. Father, thank you for giving me this privilege today to speak your word and to share a testimony of something that you did in the earth just a generation ago. I pray that you'll stir men's hearts and if there's something within them that's quickened and they become interested to know more that you will put the right information in their hands so that they can be blessed and encouraged by that message that you gave to that servant of the Lord. Also Lord help us to have a faith to believe that we'll be a part of that outpouring when your anointing falls on a corporate body. the spirit and power of Elijah. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Thank you for watching the Eagles Cry. I hope you'll come back again. God bless you. Bye-bye for this week. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
