[1:00:23] that flag drag in the ground what that
[1:00:26] veteran would do how he would become
[1:00:30] upset well there's some veterans around

[1:05:39] do praise
[1:05:42] God praise God isn't he
[1:05:44] good I I mean he's really good praise
[1:05:48] the Lord you you might want to turn that
[1:05:50] off they might they might get cold I
[1:05:52] don't know are you all cold hot War
[1:05:54] you're which are you leave it on leave
[1:05:57] it on for a few
[1:05:58] minutes uh brother Josiah's been working
[1:06:02] over there I I I really appreciate them
[1:06:05] being here like I said Tuesday night I
[1:06:07] didn't even get to see them the last
[1:06:10] time that they were here I know only I
[1:06:13] don't know them well but I I have
[1:06:16] enjoyed the the AO family uh at at
[1:06:19] Harmony in the
[1:06:20] desert and uh Katie's family is a very
[1:06:24] special family in Tucson there's nobody
[1:06:28] that doesn't know them that's the truth
[1:06:30] her dad cannot be missed he's about 10
[1:06:32] foot
[1:06:35] two not really but he's a giant but in
[1:06:38] the dealing that I had with him I found
[1:06:40] out he's a gentle giant and I like that
[1:06:43] a lot two different times when we were
[1:06:46] in Tucson and we had all of our kids
[1:06:48] with us and we needed an extra vehicle
[1:06:51] to do some running around they loaned us
[1:06:53] their vehicle and I appreciated that
[1:06:55] very much and the other thing that
[1:06:57] stands out in my mind is I had the
[1:06:59] privilege a few harmonies back when we
[1:07:02] were still at the at the hotel to sit
[1:07:06] near her
[1:07:08] grandparents and uh there's one thing
[1:07:11] you should know about them and that is
[1:07:13] they have a heart to Worship the Lord
[1:07:15] and I so enjoyed sitting near them and
[1:07:18] they said the same to me because we both
[1:07:21] had a heart not to be entertained we
[1:07:23] were w't there to be entertained we were
[1:07:25] there to Worship the Lord and the other
[1:07:28] thing that stands in my mind about
[1:07:30] sister Katie's grandmother is that uh
[1:07:34] sister green used to tell me every time
[1:07:36] now Sister Green was not that forgetful
[1:07:39] she was actually very sharp and had a
[1:07:44] unbelievable memory and could talk tell
[1:07:49] stories point out landmarks while
[1:07:52] directing me in driving all at one time
[1:07:56] and she never missed a turn I would get
[1:07:58] to listening and I would miss a turn and
[1:08:01] she'd say brother Steve aren't you going
[1:08:03] to turn we're coming up on our
[1:08:05] turn and she said to me one time that
[1:08:09] woman right there pointing at sister
[1:08:11] Katie's grandmother she said that woman
[1:08:13] right there not even attending our
[1:08:15] church through the years but she has
[1:08:19] been more of an encouragement to me than
[1:08:22] just about anybody I know she said every
[1:08:25] week I go to the mailbox and there is a
[1:08:28] card from her grandmother encouraging my
[1:08:32] heart you know that means
[1:08:34] something that means something so that's
[1:08:37] the kind of stock that she comes from
[1:08:40] and how talented they are and how
[1:08:42] anointed they were in singing they they
[1:08:45] have been worshiping for some time with
[1:08:47] with Brother John Andes in Washington
[1:08:50] and we are thankful that's the church
[1:08:52] where uh Solomon and Zion are and so
[1:08:56] we're glad to be able to share them for
[1:08:58] a little while here God is
[1:09:01] good for those of you who care I could
[1:09:04] say hak to you and that means have a
[1:09:08] joyful uh holiday and uh I have I have
[1:09:13] uh it's still a battle between light and
[1:09:18] darkness it is it's a spiritual battle
[1:09:21] and it's still going on in many many
[1:09:24] many ways and uh you know I believe
[1:09:27] there are people who are under an
[1:09:29] anti-semitic spirit and they don't even
[1:09:32] realize by the things they say and some
[1:09:36] of the actions that they do that they
[1:09:38] really are Jew
[1:09:40] haters and you know a great portion of
[1:09:43] the church is
[1:09:44] anti-Semitic even some message churches
[1:09:46] are anti-semitic because they believe in
[1:09:49] replacement theology I I hear ministers
[1:09:53] in this message preaching replacement
[1:09:55] theology on a fairly regular basis but I
[1:09:58] will assure you that God has not
[1:10:02] permanently divorced the Jewish
[1:10:05] people he married her back if you'll
[1:10:07] read the scripture amen and uh he has
[1:10:10] grafted you in Romans 11 he's grafted
[1:10:15] you in and you branches better be
[1:10:17] careful how you boast against the
[1:10:20] against the
[1:10:22] root boy you're really helping me I
[1:10:25] might preach this morning you better be
[1:10:27] careful how you boast because had it not
[1:10:30] been for them now we believe what
[1:10:33] brother brandham said about Jesus not
[1:10:35] being a Jew but I I like to explain that
[1:10:39] a little differently because if he were
[1:10:42] not a Jew in some sense he would have
[1:10:45] never been able to be the
[1:10:47] Messiah the Messiah of the Jews could
[1:10:50] not have been a gentile so for all
[1:10:53] intense and
[1:10:55] purposes when God created his
[1:10:58] blood he created him some blood like
[1:11:01] nobody else in the world had he placed
[1:11:04] him in a Jewish
[1:11:06] womb come on in a Jewish Home in a
[1:11:11] Jewish Community that's right and he
[1:11:13] worshiped God according to the customs
[1:11:16] and traditions of his
[1:11:18] day amen when that little woman said if
[1:11:22] I can but touch the him of His Garment
[1:11:25] we know that Jews did not wear hymns in
[1:11:28] their garments during the second temple
[1:11:30] period unless they were very
[1:11:33] wealthy in fact it was a sign if a man
[1:11:38] had a hym in His Garment that he was a
[1:11:41] wealthy man of great esteem and when
[1:11:43] when he came our Messiah came he came
[1:11:46] humble he came lowly he did not wear the
[1:11:49] garments of a wealthy man and so there's
[1:11:52] only one explanation for what it could
[1:11:54] mean when the woman said if I can but
[1:11:57] touch the Hemm of His Garment she was
[1:12:00] not talking about the Hem of His gown or
[1:12:03] his robe she was talking about his zit
[1:12:06] seit those threads that were given as
[1:12:09] instructions by God and reminders and
[1:12:12] tied in such a way that even the knots
[1:12:15] declared the unpronouncable name of
[1:12:19] God Amen that's powerful so when she
[1:12:23] said if I can but Touch the Hem of His
[1:12:25] Garment she knew if she could get a hold
[1:12:27] of the name of
[1:12:30] God hallelujah that the virtue that was
[1:12:33] in him would make her every wi hole
[1:12:36] hallu God's good isn't he he's good all
[1:12:39] the time let's see let's mention real
[1:12:42] quickly that I I mentioned already that
[1:12:45] today was their one anniversary I can't
[1:12:48] even remember our first anniversary
[1:12:50] honey but I know it was good it had to
[1:12:52] be good I was in it you were in it had
[1:12:55] to be good I started to make my old joke
[1:12:58] that she wore out you know the first
[1:13:00] year sure was hard first five years and
[1:13:03] now it's the first 26 years sure we're
[1:13:05] hard but we made it uh today is Sister

[1:13:15] but she is still a part of this body she
[1:13:18] reaches out for prayer from time to time
[1:13:20] and she Faithfully supports this work

[1:17:08] recapturing
[1:17:10] cleansing and rededicating your temple
[1:17:14] to the Lord
[1:17:17] recapturing cleansing and rededicating
[1:17:20] your temple to the Lord
[1:17:24] I I want to just share some things with
[1:17:28] you before we go to the book of First
[1:17:30] Kings in just a moment and David I need
[1:17:34] you to come with your
[1:17:37] Bible oh no I don't guess you really
[1:17:40] need you can read it off the screen but
[1:17:41] it looks more official for you to have
[1:17:43] your
[1:17:45] Bible Alias is unable to be here today
[1:17:48] just a
[1:17:52] minute
[1:17:54] uh uh ellias is unable to be here today
[1:17:59] and uh there's a lot of reading that
[1:18:01] means there's going to be a lot of
[1:18:02] listening and there's no need in me
[1:18:05] using my voice unless I have to redo
[1:18:07] what he
[1:18:08] does no need in using all my voice up
[1:18:11] for
[1:18:13] that I want to turn your attention today
[1:18:16] to the dedication of Solomon's
[1:18:19] Temple after 7 years the building of
[1:18:23] God's temple in Jerusalem was
[1:18:26] completed and King Solomon summoned
[1:18:29] everyone to assemble in Jerusalem for
[1:18:32] the dedication of this place where God's
[1:18:36] presence was promised to dwell on Earth
[1:18:39] but it was more than just a dedication
[1:18:42] of a building it was also an opportunity
[1:18:45] for the people to rededicate themselves
[1:18:49] to God's service following his prayer
[1:18:53] of dedication for the temple in First
[1:18:57] Kings 8: 23-
[1:19:01] 61 King Solomon offered a blessing for
[1:19:05] the people of Israel in which he had
[1:19:08] five basic
[1:19:11] requests number one he requested God's
[1:19:15] presence to be with his people number
[1:19:19] two he requested for the desire to do
[1:19:22] God 's will in
[1:19:25] everything number three he requested the
[1:19:28] desire and ability to obey all of God's
[1:19:32] Commandments number four he asked for
[1:19:35] God's help with daily
[1:19:37] needs and number five for people
[1:19:41] everywhere to know the one true God of
[1:19:45] Israel as a reflection through his
[1:19:48] people now those are five beautiful
[1:19:52] blessings blessings that Solomon prayed
[1:19:54] over the people and I would like to say
[1:19:56] the same thing over you that you might
[1:19:59] know God's
[1:20:01] presence that you might desire his will
[1:20:04] in
[1:20:05] everything that you might desire the
[1:20:07] ability and strength to obey all of
[1:20:09] God's Commandments to help God to help
[1:20:13] you with your daily needs and that God
[1:20:15] would let you be Al light to all people
[1:20:19] that would be my blessing for you David
[1:20:22] I need you to start reading First Kings
[1:20:25] chapter 8 verse
[1:20:27] 23 and we're going to read from 23 to
[1:20:32] 61 that's a lot of reading so I would
[1:20:36] just ask that everyone here would give
[1:20:39] us David and myself and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:44] your undivided attention because of
[1:20:46] there is a foundation that must be laid
[1:20:49] for what we're going to share
[1:20:51] today all right right David
[1:20:54] begin and he said Lord God of Israel
[1:20:57] there is no God like thee come on in
[1:21:00] Heaven above or on Earth beneath who

[1:21:37] Israel so that thy children take heed of
[1:21:40] their way that they walk before me as
[1:21:43] thou Hast walked before me amen and now
[1:21:46] oh god of Israel let Thy word I pray
[1:21:49] thee be verified yes which thou spakest

[1:21:55] God will indeed dwell on the Earth but
[1:21:58] will God but will God indeed dwell on

[1:22:32] which thou Hast said my name shall be
[1:22:35] there that thou mayest hearken unto the
[1:22:38] prayer which thy servant shall make
[1:22:40] toward this place yes and hearken to the
[1:22:43] supplication of thy servant and of thy
[1:22:45] People Israel yes which they shall pray

[1:23:29] right read on when the people when thy
[1:23:32] people when thy People Israel be smitten
[1:23:34] down before the enemy because they have
[1:23:37] sinned against thee and shall turn again
[1:23:39] to thee and confess thy name and pray
[1:23:43] and make supplication unto thee in this
[1:23:45] house a way for repentance is being
[1:23:47] made then hear thou in heaven and
[1:23:50] forgive the sin of thy people Israel and
[1:23:53] bring them again unto the land which
[1:23:55] thou gavest unto their fathers yes when
[1:23:58] the heaven is shut up and there is no
[1:24:00] rain because they have sinned against
[1:24:02] thee come on if they pray toward this
[1:24:05] place and confess thy name and turn from
[1:24:08] their sin when thou Afflicted them when
[1:24:11] they look to this Holy Hill that's right
[1:24:13] that you have ordained and place your
[1:24:16] name on it when they pray toward this
[1:24:19] place I want you Lord to hear prayer
[1:24:23] read on David good job then hear thou in
[1:24:26] heaven and forgive the sin of thy
[1:24:28] servants and of thy People Israel that
[1:24:31] thou teach them the good way wherein
[1:24:33] they should walk amen and give rain upon
[1:24:36] thy land which thou Hast given to thy
[1:24:38] people for an inheritance Solomon knew
[1:24:40] that the people would not always obey he
[1:24:43] knew that rain would be withheld he's
[1:24:45] really praying a very prophetic prayer
[1:24:47] that's right he knew that rain would be
[1:24:49] with held but he said oh God when they
[1:24:51] recog ognize what they've done and turn
[1:24:54] to this place in prayer I want you to
[1:24:56] forgive them this is Solomon negotiating
[1:24:59] with God telling God how to keep
[1:25:03] Covenant with his people I appreciate
[1:25:05] God not killing
[1:25:08] him read
[1:25:10] on if there be in the land famine if
[1:25:13] there be pestilence blasting Milo Locust
[1:25:17] or if there be caterpillar if there be
[1:25:20] if their enemy besiege them in the land
[1:25:22] of their cities whatsoever plague
[1:25:24] whatsoever sickness there be what prayer
[1:25:27] and supplication soever be made by any
[1:25:30] man any
[1:25:31] man or by all thy People Israel you hear
[1:25:35] that yes sir By Any Man any go any among
[1:25:40] the
[1:25:42] Nations remember that this house was to
[1:25:44] be a house of
[1:25:47] prayer for all
[1:25:49] nations not just the nation of Israel so
[1:25:52] he puts in here be made by any man or by
[1:25:55] all thy People Israel read on David
[1:25:59] which shall know every man the plague of
[1:26:02] his own heart right and spread forth his
[1:26:04] hands toward this house right then hear
[1:26:08] thou in heaven thy dwelling place and
[1:26:10] forgive and do and give to every man
[1:26:13] according to his ways whose heart thou
[1:26:16] knowest for thou even thou only knowest
[1:26:19] the hearts of for thou even thou thou
[1:26:22] only knowest the hearts of all the
[1:26:26] children of men how many of you believe
[1:26:28] he knows he knows today what's in your
[1:26:32] heart he knows what's in my heart when
[1:26:36] you assume or presume to know what's in
[1:26:39] my heart you're sinning against God
[1:26:41] that's right that scripture when Jesus
[1:26:43] said judge not that you be not judge the
[1:26:47] Bible tells us that every righteous man
[1:26:49] judgeth with the righteous judgment so
[1:26:51] why is Jesus telling us not to judge
[1:26:54] because the meaning of that word judge
[1:26:57] in the Greek is to examine the motives
[1:27:00] of one's heart you are never to examine
[1:27:03] the motives of someone's heart you can
[1:27:06] judge their actions you can judge their
[1:27:09] deeds you don't judge it by your likes
[1:27:11] and dislikes you judge it by the word
[1:27:15] you don't do that to condemn them you do
[1:27:18] that to prayerfully help
[1:27:20] them but you ever have the
[1:27:23] right and if you do it God will do the
[1:27:27] same to you he said remember I I if you
[1:27:31] measure out this kind of judgment just
[1:27:33] remember it's coming back to you because
[1:27:36] this was the presuming to know the
[1:27:39] motive of somebody's heart God is is
[1:27:43] hearing this prayer we know it because
[1:27:46] history tells us that God was was doing
[1:27:49] what what Solomon was asking him to do
[1:27:51] read on D
[1:27:54] David that they may fear thee all the
[1:27:57] days that they live in the land in the
[1:27:59] land which thou gavest unto our fathers
[1:28:03] read on moreover concerning a stranger
[1:28:06] that it is not that is not that is not
[1:28:09] of thy People Israel but cometh out of a
[1:28:12] far country for thy name's
[1:28:16] sake you see even in the older Covenant
[1:28:20] God was making
[1:28:22] way for Nations to come and embrace the
[1:28:27] god of
[1:28:29] Israel read
[1:28:31] on for they shall hear of thy great name
[1:28:35] oh the fame of Your Great Name is going
[1:28:39] to spread across the
[1:28:44] world read on and of thy strong hand
[1:28:48] right and of thy stretched out arm when
[1:28:51] they they shall come and pray when he
[1:28:53] shall come and pray toward this house
[1:28:56] that's right read
[1:28:57] on hear thou in heaven thy dwelling
[1:29:00] place and do according to all that the
[1:29:03] stranger calleth to thee for that all
[1:29:06] people of the earth May Know Thy Name to
[1:29:09] fear thee as do thy People Israel yes
[1:29:12] that they may know that they may know
[1:29:15] that this house which I have builded is
[1:29:18] called by thy name praise the Lord If
[1:29:21] thy people will go out to battle against
[1:29:23] their enemy whether soever Thou shalt
[1:29:26] send them and shall pray unto the Lord
[1:29:28] toward the city which thou Hast Chosen
[1:29:31] and toward the house that I have built
[1:29:34] for thy name then hear thou in heaven
[1:29:36] their prayer and their supplication and
[1:29:39] maintain their cause he's not covering
[1:29:42] Wars that God doesn't
[1:29:44] instigate he said if I send you
[1:29:47] out if God sends them out I want them to
[1:29:51] be able to call call on God toward this
[1:29:53] place and have their need met Solomon
[1:29:55] recognized the difference between being
[1:29:58] called and being sent and just those who
[1:30:01] got up and went right read on if they
[1:30:04] sin against thee for there is no man
[1:30:07] that sinth not and thou be angry with
[1:30:10] them and deliver them to the enemy so
[1:30:12] that they carry them away captives unto
[1:30:15] the land of the enemy far or near and it
[1:30:18] happened more than once yet if they
[1:30:21] shall bethink themselves in the land
[1:30:24] whether they are carried of captives and
[1:30:26] repent and make supplication unto thee
[1:30:29] in the land in the
[1:30:30] land of them that carried them captives
[1:30:33] saying we have sinned and have done
[1:30:36] perversely we have committed wickedness
[1:30:39] and so return unto thee with all their
[1:30:41] heart and with all their soul in the
[1:30:43] land of their enemies which led them
[1:30:46] away captive and pray unto thee toward
[1:30:48] their land which thou gavest unto their
[1:30:51] fathers that the city which thou H has
[1:30:53] chosen and the house which I have built
[1:30:55] for thy name powerful then hear thou
[1:30:58] their prayer and their supplication in
[1:31:00] heaven thy dwelling place and maintain
[1:31:03] their cause even in a Strange Land even
[1:31:06] in a heathen land even while in
[1:31:08] captivity even while having their sins
[1:31:11] dealt with Lord if they should call On
[1:31:14] Your Great Name toward this place even
[1:31:17] though they're many miles from Jerusalem
[1:31:20] many miles from Mount Z
[1:31:22] many miles from Mount morah many miles
[1:31:25] from the Holy Hill of the Lord hear
[1:31:27] their prayer Solomon is covering a lot
[1:31:30] of ground you're doing good David read
[1:31:33] on and forgive thy people that have
[1:31:36] sinned against thee and all their
[1:31:38] transgressions wherein they have
[1:31:40] transgressed against thee and give them
[1:31:42] compassion before them who carried them
[1:31:45] captive that they may have compassion on
[1:31:48] them for they be thy people and thine
[1:31:52] inheritance which thou bought broughtest
[1:31:55] forth out of Egypt from the midst of the
[1:31:57] Furnace of iron yes come on that thine
[1:32:00] eyes may be open unto the supplication
[1:32:02] of thy servant and unto the supplication
[1:32:05] of thy People Israel yes to hearken unto
[1:32:08] them in all that they call For unto thee
[1:32:10] that's right for thou didst separate
[1:32:13] them from listen now among all the
[1:32:16] people of the earth to be thine

[1:32:20] of Moses th th servant when thou
[1:32:23] broughtest our fathers out of Egypt oh
[1:32:26] Lord God stay with us and it was so that
[1:32:29] when Solomon had made an end of praying
[1:32:31] all this prayer and supplication unto
[1:32:34] the Lord he arose from before the altar
[1:32:36] of the Lord from kneeling on his knees
[1:32:39] with his hands spread up to heaven and
[1:32:41] he stood and blessed all the
[1:32:43] congregation of Israel with a loud voice
[1:32:46] saying blessed be the Lord that hath
[1:32:49] given rest unto his people isra is
[1:32:52] according to all that he promised there
[1:32:55] ha not failed one word of all his good
[1:32:58] promise Hallelujah which he promised by
[1:33:00] the hand of Moses his servant come on
[1:33:02] the Lord Our God be with us as he was
[1:33:05] with our fathers yes let him not leave
[1:33:08] us nor forsake us amen that he may
[1:33:11] incline our hearts unto him to walk in
[1:33:15] all his ways yes sir and to keep his
[1:33:17] Commandments and his statutes and his
[1:33:20] judgments which he commanded our fathers
[1:33:23] and let these my words wherewith I have
[1:33:26] made supplication before the Lord be
[1:33:28] nigh unto the Lord Our God day and night
[1:33:32] that he maintain the cause of his
[1:33:34] servant and he cause of his people
[1:33:37] Israel at all times as the matter shall
[1:33:41] require that all the people of the earth
[1:33:43] may know that the Lord is God that all
[1:33:46] may know that the Lord is God and that
[1:33:49] there is
[1:33:52] none else read on let your heart
[1:33:55] therefore be perfect with the Lord Our
[1:33:57] God to walk in his statutes and to keep
[1:34:00] his Commandments as at this day now if
[1:34:03] you know anything about this glorious
[1:34:06] day 7even years of preparation and
[1:34:09] building to get this temple in place how
[1:34:12] many of you know that the sound of a
[1:34:14] hammer was not allowed at the side of
[1:34:17] the building of the temple that means
[1:34:19] that outside the city of jerus Jerusalem
[1:34:22] in the quaries some of the stones coming
[1:34:25] from underneath the city how many of you
[1:34:29] have ever stood in Solomon's Quarry in
[1:34:31] Jerusalem many of us have stood there
[1:34:34] and it's a huge cave system and it sets
[1:34:38] right underneath the the wall of the Old
[1:34:42] City to this day and many of the stones
[1:34:45] that were used to build the temple were
[1:34:48] taken out of the of really the Mount the
[1:34:52] rock of morah or Mariah Mount
[1:34:56] Moriah and they were they were not
[1:34:59] allowed to make any sound once they were
[1:35:02] laid in place so they had to be cut with
[1:35:06] such
[1:35:07] Precision that they would fit perfectly
[1:35:11] together with without nail without
[1:35:15] connective structure they had to be able
[1:35:18] to fit together laid quietly no
[1:35:22] noise have you ever been around a
[1:35:24] construction
[1:35:25] crew can you imagine a a building being
[1:35:28] built with no noise it was so holy and
[1:35:31] so sacred that the sound of a hammer
[1:35:34] could not even be heard it was cut with
[1:35:37] such
[1:35:38] Precision that just like they said about
[1:35:41] the Pyramids of Giza you couldn't get a
[1:35:43] razor blade between the stones and
[1:35:47] everything had to be just right remember
[1:35:50] they were following in a pattern that
[1:35:52] had been shown to Moses in the
[1:35:55] Tabernacle of the Wilderness and now the
[1:35:58] presence of God and the furniture that
[1:36:01] God had given uh as as replicas or
[1:36:06] duplicates of that which is in the
[1:36:07] Heavenly places it was now to be rebuilt
[1:36:12] refashioned it would be exactly like God
[1:36:15] commanded and instead of God dwelling in
[1:36:17] a in a temporary tent of travel he would
[1:36:21] now live in a house a finished house
[1:36:26] remember the burden that struck the
[1:36:28] heart of David what a shame it is that
[1:36:31] we're living in our sealed homes and the
[1:36:35] and the glory of God is dwelling in a
[1:36:39] tent we've got to raise up and do
[1:36:41] something about it and they did and
[1:36:44] wouldn't you think by all that we have
[1:36:46] just reminisced that every king would
[1:36:49] have taken it upon the themselves to
[1:36:52] protect that Holy
[1:36:54] building doesn't it sound to you like
[1:36:57] that every king would want to improve it
[1:37:00] he he would want to maintain it he would
[1:37:02] want to maybe even rededicate it and and
[1:37:06] always keep it before the people but how
[1:37:08] many of you know that wasn't the case
[1:37:11] multiple times through the generations
[1:37:13] of the Kings and in the books of
[1:37:15] Chronicles we read that Kings would do
[1:37:19] that which was right in their own eyes
[1:37:21] we're not talking about Kings of pagan
[1:37:24] lands we're talking about Kings of
[1:37:27] Israel The Chosen nation of the Lord and
[1:37:31] then you would understand that Israel
[1:37:34] would be divided no longer United
[1:37:36] Kingdom but now it would be Judah and
[1:37:39] Israel and each would have their own
[1:37:41] King and they would war against
[1:37:44] themselves if you study through the
[1:37:46] Kings and the Chronicles you will
[1:37:49] understand that there was even a time
[1:37:50] that a Pagan Temple and not just one but
[1:37:54] multiple ones were raised up in the name
[1:37:57] of
[1:37:58] Yahweh so that the Nations could go
[1:38:01] easier to this
[1:38:05] location God didn't say I want to make
[1:38:07] it easy for you he said I'm going to
[1:38:10] choose one place I'm going to put my
[1:38:13] name on that place and if you want to
[1:38:16] worship
[1:38:18] me you've got to pray toward that
[1:38:22] place now this is important not because
[1:38:25] God has just one church and no church if
[1:38:27] you think I'm preaching that you're off
[1:38:30] uh but there is one
[1:38:32] truth there's one message there's one
[1:38:35] revelation of Jesus Christ it's upon
[1:38:38] this message that God has chosen to
[1:38:41] place his name in the end time and
[1:38:44] therefore we cannot worship God under
[1:38:47] the names of
[1:38:49] blasphemy we can only worship God under
[1:38:52] the name of the revelation of Jesus
[1:38:54] Christ which is not brother bram's
[1:38:57] message it's Jesus's
[1:38:59] message he used him as a mouthpiece for
[1:39:02] the seventh angel he deserves our honor
[1:39:06] and our
[1:39:07] respect but not our
[1:39:09] worship and he must not be our main
[1:39:13] focus we must keep our balance in the
[1:39:17] scripture and we must use God's word as
[1:39:20] our absolute to judge any and all other
[1:39:25] things that may be shown or happen Among
[1:39:28] Us are you with me so they even raised
[1:39:32] up I've been there I've been to the
[1:39:35] ruins of the false Temple that was
[1:39:38] raised up in Dan how many of you have
[1:39:41] been brother gy was there if you were
[1:39:43] ever with me in
[1:39:45] Dan uh maybe not every time but most
[1:39:49] every time because it's a hikee and once
[1:39:52] you get out the oldest
[1:39:55] architectural gate in the world is in t
[1:40:00] Dan it is the Gate of the city of Dan it
[1:40:04] is the gate that Abraham walked through
[1:40:07] and it is perfectly preserved now you
[1:40:10] can't go walking in and out of it but it
[1:40:13] is perfectly preserved and you can see
[1:40:15] it standing there as a testament to this
[1:40:17] day that God's word is true but on The
[1:40:21] Far Side near the near the headwaters of
[1:40:26] the Jordan River the beginning place for
[1:40:29] the Jordan River to flow and remember it
[1:40:32] flows all the way down fed by the
[1:40:35] streams of Mount Hermon and it flows all
[1:40:38] the way down through the nation of
[1:40:40] Israel into the the knesset or excuse me
[1:40:43] ganit the Sea of Galilee it flows out of
[1:40:48] the sea the same river flows out out of
[1:40:51] the Sea of Galilee near the baptismal
[1:40:55] yardan where we baptize many of you it
[1:40:58] flows out of the Sea of Galilee it flows
[1:41:01] all the way down through the Wilderness
[1:41:04] Jordan on one side Moab on one side
[1:41:07] Israel on the other side and the the
[1:41:10] river itself empties into the Dead Sea
[1:41:13] now the Dead Sea is
[1:41:15] dead and therefore there is no
[1:41:18] Outlet right so the Jordan River Flows
[1:41:22] In and streams of the desert will flow
[1:41:25] in during the winter seasons the Rainy
[1:41:28] Seasons but there are no Outlets so the
[1:41:32] mineral deposits are so rich and so
[1:41:35] heavy in that area that you can
[1:41:37] literally just turn loose if you can
[1:41:41] relax it's a little hard to relax but if
[1:41:45] you can relax the water will lift you up
[1:41:48] you'll go right back on your back have
[1:41:51] you ever seen pictur of someone reading
[1:41:52] the newspaper in the Dead Sea it's very
[1:41:54] easy to do because it turns you right
[1:41:57] back up now every year people die in the
[1:41:59] Dead Sea because they swallow the water
[1:42:03] they get to struggling they get to not
[1:42:05] relaxing they struggle and they swallow
[1:42:08] the water and the water is so full of
[1:42:10] minerals that it often will choke them
[1:42:12] and drown them that same river that
[1:42:15] flows from Dan flows all the way down to
[1:42:20] the Dead see and just over there close
[1:42:22] to where those Waters begin is the ruins
[1:42:27] of the false Temple that was raised up
[1:42:30] uh it had a holy of
[1:42:32] holies it had an outer Court it had all
[1:42:36] the things uh on a minuscule scale a
[1:42:39] miniature scale I guess you'd say and
[1:42:42] people were encouraged to come and
[1:42:44] worship there but God didn't receive any
[1:42:46] of the worship did you know there is a
[1:42:49] worship that God will not receive
[1:42:51] receive sir you say God wants everybody
[1:42:53] to worship him he does you know how in
[1:42:56] spirit truth and in truth God is seeking
[1:43:00] for such to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:43:04] truth worship done any old way come on
[1:43:09] in any old place come on with any old
[1:43:12] life
[1:43:15] on is not acceptable to God I regret
[1:43:19] having to say that
[1:43:21] but you know it's the truth you you can
[1:43:24] worship God in any condition but he
[1:43:27] doesn't receive Worship in any condition
[1:43:30] he has a place that he put his name he
[1:43:33] has a requirement for a life whosoever
[1:43:36] to ascendeth the hill of the Lord must
[1:43:38] do so with a clean heart and with holy
[1:43:41] hands now this would seem unfair is
[1:43:44] anybody listening this would seem unfair
[1:43:47] if if the way to get that clean heart uh
[1:43:50] pure heart and Clean Hands was so
[1:43:53] difficult that you had to jump through
[1:43:54] 30 different Hoops to get there if it
[1:43:57] was so
[1:43:59] religious that you had to uh you had to
[1:44:01] offer 11 different blood
[1:44:06] offerings or if it was so
[1:44:09] complicated that a plain simple-minded
[1:44:11] man like me would not even be able to
[1:44:14] find the way then I'd say to you God has
[1:44:17] required something that is unfair but
[1:44:19] it's so easy to get a clean
[1:44:22] heart it's so easy to get a pure heart
[1:44:25] it's so easy to get clean hands we've
[1:44:27] got a blood amen you know that song
[1:44:31] There is a blood let me tell you there
[1:44:35] is a
[1:44:38] blood and the life of that blood can
[1:44:42] cleanse your heart it can wash your
[1:44:46] hands and it can give you the
[1:44:48] opportunity to ascend the Holy Hill of
[1:44:51] the Lord and worship him in
[1:44:55] Zion how many of you recognize that Zion
[1:44:58] is no longer a physical Hill Zion is a
[1:45:02] people they're the called out remnant of
[1:45:04] the Lord in these last days and God is
[1:45:08] still dwelling in Zion hear what I'm
[1:45:10] saying he's still dwelling in Zion among
[1:45:13] his chosen still today both Jew and
[1:45:17] Gentile one new
[1:45:19] man now multiple times Through The Years
[1:45:23] a king would follow his own
[1:45:25] heart he would try to improve upon God's
[1:45:31] religion now we say religion Loosely we
[1:45:34] mean the truth of God's uh
[1:45:38] instructions you know the word
[1:45:42] Torah is really wrongfully translated
[1:45:47] law it's instructions the purest
[1:45:52] translation of the word is the
[1:45:54] instructions of the Lord and why did he
[1:45:58] why did he give us
[1:46:00] instructions sometimes called
[1:46:02] Commandments because he loved us because
[1:46:05] he trusted us and he knew that if we
[1:46:08] would love him with a pure heart we
[1:46:11] would follow his
[1:46:12] instructions if you love God and don't
[1:46:15] follow his instructions keeping his
[1:46:17] Commandments the Bible said you're a
[1:46:19] liar
[1:46:21] and the truth is not in you so if you
[1:46:24] love God oh but she love I've heard this
[1:46:27] I grew up in the South come on now I
[1:46:30] know we are being invaded by
[1:46:31] non-southerners thank the
[1:46:33] Lord but I grew up in the South and and
[1:46:37] and you know people would say about
[1:46:38] everybody she just love the
[1:46:43] Lord he just loved the Lord like that
[1:46:48] was all it takes that that's vitally
[1:46:52] important but loving the Lord is not
[1:46:54] enough because if you say you love me
[1:46:58] and you don't follow my instructions
[1:47:00] you're lying and no liar can enter into
[1:47:04] that Kingdom how many of you know that's
[1:47:05] what the scripture teaches so if they
[1:47:07] knew somebody had lived like the devil
[1:47:10] and it was time to bury
[1:47:12] them they thought they could just kind
[1:47:14] of Fudge on the
[1:47:16] truth by telling everybody how much that
[1:47:19] person loved the Lord but love has a
[1:47:23] price there's a cost to loving God and
[1:47:27] that is we must surrender our own will
[1:47:31] our own way our own choices he gives us
[1:47:34] a free will and then we turn around and
[1:47:37] give it back to him I don't I don't want
[1:47:39] to keep choosing for
[1:47:41] myself I don't want to keep having my
[1:47:43] own will I want to give you back my free
[1:47:47] choice I want you to choose for me I I
[1:47:50] want you to direct my life I want you to
[1:47:53] direct my steps is anybody hearing me
[1:47:56] this morning unfortunately there were
[1:47:59] many times during the times of the Kings
[1:48:02] of Israel when the temple would fall
[1:48:04] into disrepair and eventually God would
[1:48:06] raise up a restorer he would raise up a
[1:48:09] repairer of the breaches to repair and
[1:48:13] rededicate the place where God had
[1:48:15] chosen to place his name and where God
[1:48:17] had chosen to meet with his people David
[1:48:20] nine verses please of 2 Kings chap

[1:49:17] right and he did that which was evil in
[1:49:21] the sight of the Lord oh my not even a
[1:49:24] teenager after the Abominations of the
[1:49:26] Heathen whom the Lord cast out before
[1:49:29] the children of Israel you know what was
[1:49:30] wrong with him he was watching MTV come

[1:50:22] Nations I want everything about you to
[1:50:24] be different remember he said I don't
[1:50:27] even want you to wear garments he's
[1:50:29] speaking to Israel now under the older
[1:50:31] Covenant and he said I don't even want
[1:50:33] you to wear garments that are of mixed
[1:50:36] fibers when I come in contact with those
[1:50:39] extreme commandment Keepers who tell me
[1:50:42] that they keep the Sabbath and they
[1:50:44] observe the festivals of the Lord which
[1:50:46] is virtually impossible to do without a
[1:50:49] temple that's right you may work toward
[1:50:51] it you may celebrate it you may
[1:50:54] commemorate it but it's nearly
[1:50:56] impossible for you to keep it right I
[1:50:59] will ask them about their
[1:51:02] underwear
[1:51:06] yes come on does it have spandex in
[1:51:10] it if it does you're not a good
[1:51:14] Jew you see how ridiculous people can
[1:51:17] get because to mix anything with a with
[1:51:21] a with a natural fiber to M to mix two
[1:51:25] natural fibers would have disqualified
[1:51:29] to mix silk and cotton would have
[1:51:32] disqualified a Jewish person from
[1:51:35] worshiping in the Holy Temple come on
[1:51:37] now he said not only that I want you to
[1:51:40] be known so for me what is God saying

[1:53:01] kind of IES I want them to know that
[1:53:04] this Farm belongs to a people whose God
[1:53:07] is the
[1:53:09] Lord who is a jealous God over every
[1:53:13] aspect of their
[1:53:15] lives everything about them must scream
[1:53:18] I belong to Je HOV or yve I belong to
[1:53:22] yve I belong to the Living God this is
[1:53:25] powerful to know powerful to know and so
[1:53:29] because of that men young men old men
[1:53:33] here's a 12-year-old mixing in the
[1:53:36] Abominations of the Heathen now what
[1:53:38] does the word abomination mean it means
[1:53:40] something that God
[1:53:44] abhor sometimes we translate that in
[1:53:47] English are you still with me yes
[1:53:49] sometimes we translate that in English
[1:53:51] something that God hates but remember
[1:53:54] that hate is in
[1:53:56] degrees Like Love is in degrees in the
[1:53:59] Hebrew and in the Greek language so is
[1:54:02] hatred and there is a hate above all
[1:54:05] hates it is a a an
[1:54:08] abhorrence if God says I hate that in
[1:54:11] English and the word is abhor it's
[1:54:15] translated as abhor it's a strongest
[1:54:17] degree of hate right right and so God
[1:54:21] says it is an
[1:54:24] Abomination don't get quiet yet I hate
[1:54:28] it when men wear
[1:54:32] garments it's going to get
[1:54:34] quiet that pertain to
[1:54:39] women and women wear garments that
[1:54:43] pertain to men somebody said well now
[1:54:47] what qu what qualifies
[1:54:50] something as being a man's garment and a
[1:54:52] woman's garment you know what women used
[1:54:54] to say to me they'd say well I'll tell
[1:54:56] you right now I'll tell you right now my
[1:54:59] pants didn't come from the men's
[1:55:02] department that's not what it said
[1:55:04] that's right it didn't say what it was
[1:55:07] manufactured for hello now you going to
[1:55:10] have to help me or be
[1:55:12] quiet it it didn't say it didn't say
[1:55:14] what it was manufactured for it didn't
[1:55:17] say what department you buy it in it
[1:55:19] said that which
[1:55:24] pertains
[1:55:26] manlike woman likee if something has got
[1:55:31] [Music]
[1:55:33] legs
[1:55:37] now I know I know sisters wouldn't dare
[1:55:40] be caught in a pair of jogging pants in
[1:55:43] public but we'll wear them in
[1:55:46] home I know sh don't get mad yet it's
[1:55:49] been a long
[1:55:51] time little Holiness won't hurt
[1:55:54] nobody I know there's sisters it would
[1:55:56] only wear a long dress in public but
[1:55:59] pajamas in
[1:56:01] private remember the Bible didn't say
[1:56:04] what you wear 12 hours of the day better
[1:56:08] be man me pertaining to men if you're a
[1:56:10] man pertaining to a woman if you're a
[1:56:11] woman anybody with
[1:56:13] me woo this won't get me many reals
[1:56:16] likes on reals come on this won't get me
[1:56:19] popular a going but it's what I believe
[1:56:23] and I believe it's based on the word and
[1:56:25] this this I'm not angry about it I'm
[1:56:27] just using it as an example that God
[1:56:29] knows what he likes and if you don't
[1:56:32] care I don't want to be ugly and sound
[1:56:33] like I'm cussing but if you don't give a
[1:56:36] hoot that's so
[1:56:39] Southern I could have said something
[1:56:42] else I hear people using words like flip
[1:56:45] and so forth I don't want to say it like
[1:56:47] that too too close to other words you
[1:56:49] know euphemisms can be dangerous but
[1:56:52] here in the South we used to have a
[1:56:54] campaign against pollution that's right
[1:56:57] from hoodie the owl was his name hoodie
[1:57:00] I'm making that up I don't remember what
[1:57:01] his name
[1:57:05] was wasn't it ho hoodie the Al and he
[1:57:09] said give a
[1:57:10] hoot how many ever remember seeing it
[1:57:12] hope woo you old
[1:57:17] antiques give a hoot
[1:57:20] don't
[1:57:23] pollute
[1:57:25] woodsy who' name an now
[1:57:28] woodsy woodsy
[1:57:32] D you you might think in your mind that
[1:57:35] that God don't
[1:57:37] care that that that he don't really give
[1:57:40] a
[1:57:41] hoot about little
[1:57:43] things you take one look at this book
[1:57:47] come on brother
[1:57:50] and you will know that every curtain God
[1:57:54] designed it in this book if it hung in
[1:57:57] the Tabernacle of the Wilderness or in
[1:57:59] the temple God had a design for it he
[1:58:02] knew what he wanted embroidered on it he
[1:58:04] knew what color the threads ought to be
[1:58:07] he knew what color The Fringe ought to
[1:58:08] be he knew how many sockets there ought
[1:58:11] to be to hang it up and how many poles
[1:58:13] to keep it up and what those sockets and
[1:58:16] poles should be made out of and if you
[1:58:19] don't care if you don't give a ho like
[1:58:22] the world would say maybe what God
[1:58:25] likes then do what you want to
[1:58:29] do
[1:58:31] brother but if you
[1:58:34] care what he
[1:58:37] likes somebody said am I going to hell
[1:58:40] for doing something well I I'll be
[1:58:42] honest with you there's some things that
[1:58:44] I don't know whether you would go to
[1:58:45] hell for or not but I will tell you this
[1:58:49] what is wrong with us that we would want
[1:58:53] to participate in something that God
[1:58:55] says I hate that that's right now if you
[1:58:58] happen to ask me why God hates it I
[1:59:00] would have to tell you it's because it
[1:59:03] Blends together something God said I
[1:59:06] want to keep very
[1:59:08] separate I want men to dress like men
[1:59:11] and and women to dress like women and he
[1:59:15] even the world knows that because you go
[1:59:18] to McDonald's and you you don't have to
[1:59:20] read the men or the women they've got a
[1:59:22] stick figure there I know folks are
[1:59:24] getting woke now and they don't know
[1:59:27] what they are and they're binary do you
[1:59:30] remember a day when people told us not
[1:59:32] to homeschool our children because we
[1:59:34] would make recluses and freaks out of
[1:59:36] them because they wouldn't be able to
[1:59:38] get along in the real world if we didn't
[1:59:40] send them to public school we were going
[1:59:42] to give them closed minds and they
[1:59:44] weren't going to have good life did you
[1:59:46] know that over there at the public
[1:59:47] schools there are children that think
[1:59:49] they're
[1:59:53] rabbits did you know there are people
[1:59:56] over there in the public school system
[1:59:58] that think they're fluffy
[2:00:00] animals and they dress like stuffed
[2:00:03] animals and they have big conventions
[2:00:06] come on your little child is not going
[2:00:09] to be warped because you kept them at
[2:00:11] home the word of God said you teach
[2:00:14] these precepts to your children and your
[2:00:17] children's children I didn't call you
[2:00:19] out of Egypt to put you on a school bus
[2:00:22] and send you
[2:00:24] [Applause]
[2:00:27] back the only redeeming factor is some
[2:00:32] of you
[2:00:33] sisters who have at least some
[2:00:38] influence in that Heathen
[2:00:40] Society if I was going to have to if I
[2:00:44] had to send my children to that kind of
[2:00:46] a system I would love it if a teacher
[2:00:48] with a the skirt come out to teach my
[2:00:51] children so they're blessed to have a
[2:00:53] Jennifer they're blessed to have a Jenna
[2:00:56] they're blessed to get on a school bus
[2:00:57] and have charity driving that bus or
[2:00:59] sister Alita driving that bus who else
[2:01:02] anybody else drive now Sister LL driving
[2:01:05] a bus they're blessed they don't know
[2:01:08] about they don't understand it perhaps
[2:01:10] but they they put their kids on that bus
[2:01:12] with somebody who sees them who learns
[2:01:14] about them who prays for them who
[2:01:17] sometimes comes to church and requests
[2:01:19] prayer for them but you and I got to do
[2:01:21] better for our children we've got to
[2:01:23] keep them out from under that influence
[2:01:25] I've got to
[2:01:26] hurry if it's an Abomination it means
[2:01:29] God hates it he wants us separate he
[2:01:31] wants people to be able to look at you
[2:01:33] from across the room and know who you
[2:01:37] are your hair sister is a glory to you
[2:01:42] it puts power and authority on your head
[2:01:45] and not just to keep the scissors out of
[2:01:47] it but the way you twist it the way the
[2:01:49] way you fix it the way you do it the way
[2:01:51] you present it God even cares about that
[2:01:55] people are supposed to look at you and
[2:01:57] see that hair on your head and find that
[2:02:01] somewhat
[2:02:02] attractive not meaning in some sensual
[2:02:05] way but to see it there and think wow
[2:02:08] that's that's really
[2:02:11] something what they don't realize is
[2:02:14] that's not you just wanting to be
[2:02:15] different than everybody else that's you
[2:02:17] wanting to have because of the
[2:02:20] Angels you want to show the world your
[2:02:23] place in the economy of God's
[2:02:26] submission and because of that he puts
[2:02:28] power on your head I want to tell you
[2:02:31] something that'll get me in trouble when
[2:02:33] a lired holy ghost woman prays in
[2:02:37] tongues hell has to
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:45] shake it has to shake it don't know what
[2:02:49] to do with a woman that has power on her
[2:02:51] head it doesn't know what to do with a
[2:02:53] woman that has a language that hell
[2:02:55] can't understand so
[2:03:00] you glory be to God so you sisters
[2:03:04] realize what God's given you I know it's
[2:03:08] not easy I know it's wearisome to you I
[2:03:13] know it's hard on you sometime to
[2:03:15] maintain that and keep that I know you
[2:03:19] have to spend
[2:03:21] money I know it cost you something
[2:03:24] because you can't just run down here to
[2:03:26] Walmart and buy any shampoo on the Shelf
[2:03:29] if you do it'll fall out come
[2:03:32] on you'll poison
[2:03:35] yourself
[2:03:38] l oh I know some
[2:03:41] stories you'll poison yourself it cost a
[2:03:45] little bit you have to put a little more
[2:03:47] money into it come on you have to buy a
[2:03:49] little something a serum or a or a
[2:03:52] treatment or something uh to to make it
[2:03:56] to to to maintain its healthiness and
[2:04:00] some people go their whole life and
[2:04:01] never really find what works the best
[2:04:02] for their hair I want to tell you men
[2:04:05] something don't you run your lip
[2:04:10] amen if she spends an extra dollar or
[2:04:14] two to maintain what God calls her
[2:04:17] glory there you now preach it now
[2:04:21] brother if she needs I never preached
[2:04:24] this in my life I'm so
[2:04:28] off if she needs a little
[2:04:31] conditioner or something you know I'd be
[2:04:34] careful about sending her to the beauty
[2:04:36] parlor cuz that's what got Lot's wife in
[2:04:42] trouble but but but whatever it takes I
[2:04:45] I really do believe that a man a Godly
[2:04:48] Man man W want to say anything if a if a
[2:04:52] a a sister said honey I found something
[2:04:54] here that's supposed to work every one
[2:04:56] of you ladies ought to be taking
[2:04:59] collagen and every one of you ladies
[2:05:01] ought to be doing something to help
[2:05:02] strengthen your hair because it's a
[2:05:04] glory on your head it's supposed to look
[2:05:07] attractive and when I say attractive I
[2:05:09] don't mean in the way that that's
[2:05:11] seductive I mean
[2:05:14] is you know I'm so
[2:05:17] weird come on
[2:05:19] that when I meet a Pentecostal woman
[2:05:21] that's got her hair all done up I I just
[2:05:25] love
[2:05:27] it I just love it I just love it I think
[2:05:30] they might get carried
[2:05:32] away I don't think it has to set that
[2:05:36] high I I don't believe the higher the
[2:05:38] hair the closer to
[2:05:40] God but there is something about a woman
[2:05:44] who wants to keep her hair
[2:05:47] uncut
[2:05:51] if you listen to the Jackson nightes
[2:05:54] you'll you'll trim it an inch at a
[2:05:56] time until there ain't nothing
[2:06:01] left you'll get caught up in all of that
[2:06:05] you got straight hair you'll want
[2:06:06] permanent curly hair you got permanent
[2:06:09] curly hair you'll want straight hair
[2:06:11] come on don't let it be a stumbling
[2:06:13] block to you just say Lord I'm not doing
[2:06:16] this because I want to I'm doing this
[2:06:20] because I discover that it somehow
[2:06:22] pleases you I don't even know if I know
[2:06:25] why and in the same manner a man is
[2:06:28] supposed to have shorter
[2:06:30] hair he's not supposed to have a
[2:06:32] ponytail a man
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:37] bun how do you know that's right you
[2:06:40] don't even have to be holy ghost filled
[2:06:41] to know that the Bible said nature
[2:06:44] itself teaches you that it's a
[2:06:46] shame now I happen to believe I have
[2:06:48] friends in the in the anabaptist in
[2:06:51] movement that believe that the long hair
[2:06:53] then requires a covering I'm not one of
[2:06:55] those I believe that your long hair has
[2:06:58] given you for a covering but God covered
[2:07:01] all of these things because he wanted us
[2:07:04] to be a different people I got to hurry
[2:07:05] I don't know how I I can't tell you how
[2:07:07] I got on that where what are you doing
[2:07:10] what are you supposed to do you know
[2:07:10] what you're can you help me out can you
[2:07:12] help me David all right now so there
[2:07:15] were many times during the times of the
[2:07:17] Kings when the temple fell into repair
[2:07:19] read this manessa was 12 years old I
[2:07:20] done forgot all about
[2:07:22] it 21 or or two well go back to verse
[2:07:26] one because they forgot
[2:07:27] to manasse was 12 years old all that
[2:07:30] come out because he was
[2:07:33] 12 go ahead when when he began to Reign
[2:07:37] and reigned 550 and5 years in Jerusalem
[2:07:40] and his mother's name was havah read on
[2:07:43] and he did that which was evil in the
[2:07:45] sight of the Lord after the Abominations
[2:07:47] of the Heathen whom the Lord Lord cast
[2:07:49] out before the children of Israel he
[2:07:50] picked up the little ways of the other
[2:07:52] tribes come on for he built up again the
[2:07:55] high places which Hezekiah his father
[2:07:57] had destroyed that's that's those
[2:08:00] Groves they built those Groves they
[2:08:03] built altars up in the Groves of trees
[2:08:06] on tops of the
[2:08:08] hills they decked them
[2:08:10] out they decorated them
[2:08:13] up and then in uh
[2:08:16] Jeremiah in the times of Jeremiah they
[2:08:19] decided that they weren't pretty enough
[2:08:21] just to go up on the hill and pray up
[2:08:23] there in the Grove OR at the high altars
[2:08:26] we will now cut those things down no
[2:08:27] they weren't Christmas trees no such
[2:08:29] thing as
[2:08:30] Christmas they weren't Christmas trees
[2:08:32] but they said we'll we'll cut them down
[2:08:34] and fasten them in the floor with a nail
[2:08:36] and deck them with gold and silver we'll
[2:08:38] bring them into our homes and that's why
[2:08:40] Jeremiah said learn not the way of the
[2:08:43] Heathen because just going up in the
[2:08:45] Grove wasn't
[2:08:47] enough
[2:08:48] I I'm just going to say this the
[2:08:50] Holiness preachers preached against the
[2:08:51] movie
[2:08:53] theater at least you had to leave and go
[2:08:55] over to the movie theater and now what
[2:08:58] has happened is we brought the movie
[2:08:59] theater and
[2:09:01] worst into our
[2:09:04] hands if we're so inclined we better be
[2:09:08] careful to keep a pure heart and Clean
[2:09:11] Hands it's time to
[2:09:13] reconsecrate it it's time to recapture
[2:09:16] the house of the Lord
[2:09:18] it's time to reconsecrate the house of
[2:09:20] the Lord rededicate it clean it up first
[2:09:23] cleanse it up and then give it back to
[2:09:25] God read on David it's late and he
[2:09:28] reared up altars for Baal and made a
[2:09:30] Grove as did Ahab king of Israel and
[2:09:34] worshiped all the hosts of heaven and
[2:09:36] served
[2:09:37] them they even began to worship
[2:09:42] Angels Heavenly
[2:09:45] Creatures they even made little statues
[2:09:47] of them
[2:09:49] and worship them I'm not saying because
[2:09:53] you have a statue of an angel you're
[2:09:54] worshiping it not saying that at all but
[2:09:56] be careful what you
[2:09:58] worship be careful what you put your
[2:10:00] attention to read on and he built altars
[2:10:04] in the house of the Lord oh now he's
[2:10:07] he's was in The Groves he was out there
[2:10:10] on the high places but now the king
[2:10:13] dared to come into the temple of God and
[2:10:17] rearrange the furn
[2:10:19] Furniture it's not your place to
[2:10:21] rearrange the
[2:10:22] furniture in the house of the
[2:10:25] Lord it's not your place to add to the
[2:10:29] house of the Lord on your own without
[2:10:31] any Authority read on of which the Lord
[2:10:35] said in Jerusalem will I put my name one
[2:10:39] place and he built altars for all the
[2:10:42] hosts of Heaven and the two courts of
[2:10:45] the house of the Lord think about the
[2:10:47] just just redoing things things not
[2:10:48] according to the Heavenly pattern at all
[2:10:51] now look at how Wild he got as he got
[2:10:54] older he got
[2:10:56] worse and he made his son pass through
[2:10:59] the fire and observed times and used
[2:11:03] enchantments and dealt with familiar
[2:11:05] spirits and wizards he wrought much
[2:11:08] wickedness in the sight of the Lord to
[2:11:10] provoke him to anger come on now and he
[2:11:13] set a Graven image of the Grove that he
[2:11:16] had made in the house of the made in the
[2:11:18] house of which the Lord said to David
[2:11:21] and to his Solomon his son in this house
[2:11:24] in this house and in
[2:11:26] Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all
[2:11:29] the tribes of Israel will I put my name
[2:11:33] forever neither will I make the feet of
[2:11:36] Israel more move anymore out of the land
[2:11:39] which I gave their fathers come on now
[2:11:42] only if they will observe to do
[2:11:44] according to all that I have commanded
[2:11:46] if you want to stay in the land if if
[2:11:48] you want to stay in the promise you got
[2:11:50] to obey the
[2:11:51] word read on and according to all the
[2:11:55] law that my servant Moses commanded them
[2:11:58] but they hearkened not and Manasseh
[2:12:01] seduced them to do more evil than did
[2:12:04] the Nations whom the Lord destroyed
[2:12:06] before the children of Israel I want you
[2:12:07] to know there was more evil being done
[2:12:10] in Israel than had been done in the
[2:12:13] Pagan nations of the world what do you
[2:12:17] think God thought about that I'd say
[2:12:19] didn't like it very much if you go on to
[2:12:22] read the rest of 2 Kings 21 you'll find
[2:12:24] out that another young king rose on the
[2:12:26] scene and did the same kind of
[2:12:29] wickedness but that was not to are you
[2:12:32] with me yes sir I'm going to preach I'm
[2:12:35] just getting started but I'll hurry best
[2:12:36] I can now I want you to notice something
[2:12:40] here when it looked like it couldn't
[2:12:41] hardly get any
[2:12:43] worse enter into the picture
[2:12:47] Josiah
[2:12:49] a mere
[2:12:51] boy 8 years
[2:12:53] old but nonetheless chosen for a
[2:12:56] man-sized
[2:12:58] job he had a great Destiny before him
[2:13:04] Josiah looked at the sight and the state
[2:13:07] of the temple and said enough is
[2:13:11] enough he decided to put things back in
[2:13:15] order and if you want to read that in
[2:13:18] your own time you can read 2 Kings chap
[2:13:20] 22 and 23 and 2 Chronicles 34 and 35 but
[2:13:26] David is going to read seven verses to
[2:13:28] us here in 2 Kings 22 1-7 let's stay
[2:13:32] with him Josiah was 8 years old when he
[2:13:36] began to Reign and he reigned 3 And1
[2:13:39] years in Jerusalem and his mother's name
[2:13:42] was jedah the daughter of adah of
[2:13:46] boso and he did that which was right in
[2:13:49] the sight of the Lord and walked in all
[2:13:52] the way of David his father what a
[2:13:54] contrast two Wicked Kings in a row here
[2:13:57] and now here comes One 8 years old
[2:14:00] wanting to do what was right in the
[2:14:02] sight of the
[2:14:03] Lord and turned not aside to the right
[2:14:07] hand or to the left and it came to pass
[2:14:10] in the 18th year of King Josiah that the
[2:14:13] king sent shafan the son of aalah
[2:14:18] the Son Of mulam The Scribe to the house
[2:14:22] of the Lord saying go up to hilaya to
[2:14:26] the priest that he the high priest that
[2:14:29] he may sum the silver which is brought
[2:14:32] into the house of the Lord which the
[2:14:34] keepers of the door have gathered of the
[2:14:36] people yes and let them deliver it into
[2:14:38] the hand of the doers of the work that
[2:14:42] have the oversight of the house of the
[2:14:43] Lord and let them give it to the doers
[2:14:46] of the work which is in in the house of
[2:14:48] the Lord to repair the branches of the
[2:14:51] house breaches breaches of the
[2:14:54] house unto carpenters and Builders and
[2:14:57] Masons and to buy Timber and Hune Stone
[2:15:01] to repair the house how be it there was
[2:15:04] no Reckoning made with them of the money
[2:15:07] that was delivered into their hand
[2:15:09] because they dealt Faithfully they were
[2:15:12] trusted sir they didn't just go out and
[2:15:15] find strangers to come and do the work
[2:15:17] in the house of the Lord it was a holy
[2:15:20] place they were doing a holy work
[2:15:23] reconsecration repairing restoring so
[2:15:26] they found carpenters and Masons and
[2:15:29] workers that they could
[2:15:32] trust and they would give them the money
[2:15:34] and the work would be done now read 11
[2:15:37] and 12 of 2 Kings 23 and we're
[2:15:40] hurrying and he took away the horses
[2:15:43] that the kings of Judah had given into
[2:15:45] the son given to the son at the ENT to
[2:15:48] the Su
[2:15:49] in horses they had placed huge
[2:15:55] horses have you ever been to chains PF
[2:15:59] chains you seen those big horses they
[2:16:02] put in a lot of them by the door with a
[2:16:04] Chinese Soldier on top can you imagine
[2:16:06] going up to the house of the Lord and
[2:16:08] these huge Idols of horses are sitting
[2:16:11] there beside because some nut didn't
[2:16:14] think it looked good
[2:16:15] enough he wanted to make it look
[2:16:20] grander he didn't think it was flashy
[2:16:23] enough or fancy enough come on now
[2:16:27] little Josiah has to go down and rip
[2:16:29] those things out of there these these
[2:16:32] horses they weren't dedicated to the god
[2:16:34] of of Israel the god of the temple they
[2:16:36] had been dedicated to the god of the son
[2:16:39] sat down at the entering end of the
[2:16:41] house of the Lord by the Chamber of
[2:16:43] Nathan melik the Chamberlain which was
[2:16:45] in the suburbs and burned the Chariots
[2:16:48] of the sun with fire they had chosen
[2:16:51] their own elaborate decorations for the
[2:16:54] Holy Temple read on David and the altars
[2:16:56] that were on the top of the upper
[2:16:58] chamber of ahaz which the kings of Judah
[2:17:01] had made and the altars which Manasseh
[2:17:03] had made in the two courts of the house
[2:17:05] of the Lord remember that was we just
[2:17:06] read about that King did the king beat
[2:17:09] down he beat down somebody say beat down
[2:17:12] down he didn't walk in and say excuse me
[2:17:14] folks I I know that this might be a
[2:17:17] controversial subject here uh because
[2:17:20] some of you gave money for these thing
[2:17:22] but to be bill and I am not here to
[2:17:26] offend he wasn't like a
[2:17:31] ramaswami I'm not here to offend I
[2:17:37] I I hope you all don't mind I'm trying
[2:17:40] to appeal to everybody see I hope you
[2:17:43] all don't mind if I
[2:17:45] carefully remove these extra decorations
[2:17:48] that you all have added to the house of
[2:17:50] the Lord what's the bible say that
[2:17:51] Josiah
[2:17:54] did Katie you got to watch
[2:17:57] Josiah Jennifer you got to watch Josiah
[2:18:00] because they may carry if their mom and
[2:18:02] dad felt the inspiration of the Lord to
[2:18:04] to name them by that name they may carry
[2:18:07] a little bit of that
[2:18:10] wildness God did that on
[2:18:13] purpose but it does have to be watched
[2:18:16] after has to be steward did CU Josiah
[2:18:19] had no tact I don't I don't I'm not
[2:18:21] saying you
[2:18:29] don't my what a pastor can get himself
[2:18:32] in trouble here like that LE let's say
[2:18:35] we could all use a little more
[2:18:37] TX he didn't have any he just went in
[2:18:41] and got started ripping down those
[2:18:44] horses and beating down the two courts
[2:18:47] that had been raised up there and he
[2:18:50] break them down from
[2:18:53] then and then what did he do David and
[2:18:55] cast the dust of them into the brook kid
[2:19:00] drone I'm throwing you out I'm taking
[2:19:03] you all the way down to the valley I
[2:19:05] don't even want the ashes I don't even
[2:19:07] want the
[2:19:08] dust to remain on the floor of this
[2:19:11] Temple as a testimony of your
[2:19:14] foolishness I'm tearing them down in the
[2:19:16] name of the Lord
[2:19:18] it takes a repairer of the breach it
[2:19:21] takes someone who cares what God loves
[2:19:24] and what God hates it takes a holy
[2:19:28] priesthood with a zadok anointing that
[2:19:31] will come forward and say we're going to
[2:19:33] hate what God hates we're going to love
[2:19:36] what God loves and if that offends you
[2:19:40] we just have no apology to
[2:19:42] make if you can't worship here because
[2:19:46] we're standing for what the word said
[2:19:49] all are
[2:19:50] welcome but if you find that you can't
[2:19:54] worship here because we choose to stand
[2:19:56] on what the word said come on brother
[2:19:59] you are free that's
[2:20:01] right I don't take your presence here
[2:20:04] lightly and I don't take it here for
[2:20:07] granted I want you here I thank God for
[2:20:11] every last one of you that I see in this
[2:20:14] house and those and these streamers but
[2:20:17] I want you to know if the day ever comes
[2:20:20] that I would have to sugarcoat it or
[2:20:23] tiptoe around the Tulips to keep you
[2:20:26] coming up the
[2:20:29] hill I'm not interested
[2:20:32] then I didn't get in this thing for the
[2:20:35] favor of man I didn't get in this to
[2:20:37] treat somebody different because of
[2:20:39] their
[2:20:40] offering brother I got in this to stay
[2:20:43] on the
[2:20:44] word to bring correction when correction
[2:20:47] is needed whoever needs it that's what
[2:20:50] we have to do break it down now Josiah
[2:20:54] let me just give you four points of
[2:20:56] Josiah's ministry here before we get to
[2:20:58] the meat of
[2:21:01] this Josiah's rain began in 639 I know
[2:21:05] my wife wanted to say to me yesterday
[2:21:07] but she didn't cuz she was too busy to
[2:21:09] be where I was but I know when she saw
[2:21:11] me studying again I know she bad wanted
[2:21:14] to say honey remember you're not going
[2:21:16] to get the half of it you don't have to
[2:21:18] put it all in the notes but she didn't
[2:21:20] so I put it all in the
[2:21:22] notes Josiah's Reign began in 639 when
[2:21:26] he was 8 years old but he began to seek
[2:21:28] the Lord fully at age
[2:21:31] 16 in
[2:21:33] 631 and you will find that in in uh
[2:21:37] Chronicles in 2 Chronicles chapter
[2:21:40] 34 at age 20 in the year 627 in the 12th
[2:21:45] year of his Reign Jose mesiah began an
[2:21:48] active program of reform in Jerusalem
[2:21:51] and Beyond at the age of 26 think about
[2:21:55] it
[2:21:57] 26 we don't hardly give
[2:22:00] credit of
[2:22:03] intelligence of wisdom to someone who's
[2:22:13] 26 I've had to be reminded here a time
[2:22:16] or two we are not the children anymore
[2:22:19] in the
[2:22:20] church we're now
[2:22:22] married and we have children of our own
[2:22:26] give us a little
[2:22:28] credit so I'm here to give you a little
[2:22:30] credit if you can accomplish what Josiah
[2:22:33] was accomplishing at
[2:22:36] 26 I'll pay more attention to your
[2:22:40] advice he was really in it amen by the
[2:22:44] time he was 26 18th year year of his
[2:22:47] Reign he was sending workers up to
[2:22:49] rebuild to repair the temple and during
[2:22:53] the temple cleanup do you remember this
[2:22:55] the workers found the scroll of the law
[2:22:58] can you
[2:22:59] imagine that the very word of God had
[2:23:02] been lost for
[2:23:05] generations and it had fallen among the
[2:23:10] rubble can you imagine today that the
[2:23:14] word of God has been lost
[2:23:17] among the Christmas trees and the Easter
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:25] eggs
[2:23:27] listen when when when I got up here this
[2:23:31] morning I had a I realized I mean I
[2:23:34] bought it I know I ordered it this black
[2:23:36] shirt ain't it
[2:23:37] nice but when I come out here I for a
[2:23:41] split second I thought I remember the
[2:23:46] day
[2:23:48] since some of you came from the
[2:23:50] Assemblies of God I'll tell you that
[2:23:54] when I was a
[2:23:55] boy there was a district
[2:23:59] superintendent of the Assemblies of God
[2:24:01] by the name of th
[2:24:04] Spence
[2:24:06] and he was known just Assembly of God
[2:24:10] not strict Holiness Assembly of God he
[2:24:14] was known that if a preacher would come
[2:24:16] before him in a colored
[2:24:19] shirt not
[2:24:21] white to throw them out of his
[2:24:29] office and now they've got Thrice
[2:24:34] married
[2:24:37] preachers wearing cargo shorts on and
[2:24:41] wife beater
[2:24:42] shirts and baseball caps and flipflops
[2:24:47] standing in the pool pit of their
[2:24:52] churches oh how far are they Fallen I
[2:24:55] don't think a man has to wear a white
[2:24:57] shirt obviously or I wouldn't found this
[2:24:58] one to wear wore blue last week it was
[2:25:01] new
[2:25:03] too but I'm just saying isn't it
[2:25:07] amazing how you can have something way
[2:25:10] up here like that and little by little
[2:25:12] by little can you imagine throwing a man
[2:25:15] out of his office because there's a I
[2:25:17] know a pastor in this message that spoke
[2:25:19] to a brother who come to preach him a
[2:25:21] meeting with a with a a shirt other than
[2:25:24] white and if a if a man comes through
[2:25:26] there with
[2:25:27] whiskers he'll tell him if he wants to
[2:25:30] preach he needs to
[2:25:33] shave so this is not so far away so far
[2:25:37] removed that we couldn't relate to some
[2:25:39] of it but can you imagine not wanting a
[2:25:42] preacher to come for his
[2:25:44] license with a colored shirt on and now
[2:25:46] now standing in their
[2:25:50] poopit they stand there
[2:25:52] in cargo shorts and flip-flops and
[2:25:56] yellow toenails and baseball caps
[2:26:00] and and handle the things of God with
[2:26:04] their coffee shops and
[2:26:05] their tattoo parlors
[2:26:08] and we need
[2:26:12] Josiah you let a man get a little
[2:26:14] radical on YouTube and they they B him
[2:26:17] they they markk him as some kind of
[2:26:19] crazy fanatic because he wants to call a
[2:26:21] little bit of righteousness back to the
[2:26:23] church we need somebody like a
[2:26:27] Josiah who who don't have enough tact to
[2:26:30] care and don't even think about what it
[2:26:32] what somebody for every Josiah it takes
[2:26:35] a dozen come on to put the pieces back
[2:26:41] together because he just gets this on
[2:26:44] his mind and he rips it
[2:26:47] is anybody with me now I want I want to
[2:26:50] move into the last part of this sermon
[2:26:51] it's 122 I'm going to take till two the
[2:26:54] Lord willing and let you
[2:26:56] go I want to talk to you for a moment
[2:26:59] about what is called the inter
[2:27:03] testamental intertestamental
[2:27:07] period
[2:27:09] intertestamental
[2:27:10] period it's a period of about 400
[2:27:15] years it's expands from the ministry of
[2:27:19] the Prophet
[2:27:20] Malachi in 420
[2:27:24] BCE now remember that BCE is
[2:27:28] Jewish it means before the Common Era
[2:27:33] which is the second temple period the
[2:27:35] time of
[2:27:36] Jesus it's the same thing as
[2:27:39] BC before
[2:27:42] Christ but the Jews are not going to
[2:27:45] measure time
[2:27:47] by someone who they don't believe to be
[2:27:49] the Messiah so in historical documents
[2:27:52] and in seminary settings they will still
[2:27:56] refer historically to BCE so don't let
[2:27:59] that bother you but it lasted from the
[2:28:02] ministry of the Prophet Malachi which
[2:28:04] was about 420 bcee to the appearance of
[2:28:08] the ministry of John the Baptist which
[2:28:11] was in the early part of the first
[2:28:13] century
[2:28:15] ad
[2:28:17] 400 years that we sometimes call between
[2:28:21] the
[2:28:24] Testaments it was 400 years before we
[2:28:27] started seeing something new arise and
[2:28:32] other scriptural things written and
[2:28:35] recorded it took a John the Baptist to
[2:28:39] stir up the religious
[2:28:41] crowd come on sir he didn't come with a
[2:28:45] white shirt and a three piece be suit
[2:28:47] like they wanted him to right he came in
[2:28:51] with a with a a camel skin Romper
[2:28:56] on you know what that looks like a camel
[2:28:59] skinn Romper on with honey dripping down
[2:29:03] his
[2:29:04] beard and when he got hungry he was a uh
[2:29:08] there are various interpretations of
[2:29:10] what Locus was the most common to be a
[2:29:13] bug he's getting his protein from fried
[2:29:18] Grasshoppers and he's eating them with
[2:29:20] honey and he's screaming like a wild man
[2:29:24] calling everybody
[2:29:28] devils and you know when they when he
[2:29:30] come on the scene the people of Israel
[2:29:33] must have said oh I wish we had another
[2:29:37] Malachi when Malachi was on the scene
[2:29:40] when jeriah was on the scene when Isaiah
[2:29:42] was on the scene when Hagi was on the
[2:29:45] scene Israel wanted him off the
[2:29:47] scene and then here come John the
[2:29:50] Baptist and they said oh I wish we had
[2:29:52] Isaiah
[2:29:53] back give us an Amos again God's people
[2:29:57] are never ever satisfied it seems with
[2:30:01] what they
[2:30:02] have and they hardly ever recognize or
[2:30:07] appreciate
[2:30:08] it until it's
[2:30:11] gone anybody want to say
[2:30:13] Amen so if you're getting into
[2:30:16] Ministry because you want
[2:30:19] attention or because you want
[2:30:22] celebration that's right you'll mostly
[2:30:25] be appreciated at your
[2:30:30] funeral it's a truth there's no
[2:30:34] glory I don't know why anybody alive
[2:30:39] would want to be a
[2:30:40] pastor you have to say a word I don't
[2:30:43] even need your
[2:30:45] amen you're what I'm talking
[2:30:51] about why would anybody want that
[2:30:54] responsibility you from one minute you
[2:30:57] go from God's man of
[2:31:00] power for the
[2:31:02] hour and in the next minute you hate my
[2:31:08] children you know the you know the
[2:31:11] routine I try not to talk about it too
[2:31:14] much because I don't want to discourage
[2:31:15] anybody from obeying God if he calls you
[2:31:19] you'll have to do it whether you want to
[2:31:22] or
[2:31:23] not come
[2:31:27] on somebody appreciates me I got a I'm
[2:31:31] just kidding I got a big old box of
[2:31:34] fudge
[2:31:36] homemade peanut butter fudge today I
[2:31:40] cannot say that it is what I
[2:31:43] need but I must say I am
[2:31:47] humbly receiving
[2:31:49] it and I accept it as a great gift of
[2:31:55] appreciation and to not partake of it
[2:31:57] would be
[2:31:59] rude no matter what part of the
[2:32:02] geographical United States you're
[2:32:04] from isn't that right so during this
[2:32:08] intertestamental
[2:32:11] period there was the
[2:32:13] sald and the Greek
[2:32:17] influence and later
[2:32:20] occupation along with the Romans on the
[2:32:23] land of
[2:32:24] Israel
[2:32:26] soluset Greeks Romans all come calling
[2:32:31] all wanted to make Jerusalem their
[2:32:33] Capital there was that period of time
[2:32:36] that the city of Jerusalem's name was
[2:32:38] changed to
[2:32:40] Constantinople not even called after the
[2:32:43] Holy Name that God had given it and and
[2:32:46] you cannot imagine the things that
[2:32:49] changed I need your help just your
[2:32:53] attention you can't imagine the things
[2:32:55] that changed under the influence of the
[2:32:58] solids and the Greeks and the Romans and
[2:33:01] there were
[2:33:02] others Alexander the
[2:33:05] Great was coming to an end his sons and
[2:33:10] grandsons were crazy
[2:33:13] too and they wanted to conquer the whole
[2:33:15] world and every conqueror had his
[2:33:19] eye on
[2:33:21] Jerusalem and every conqueror had the
[2:33:24] same idea rid the world of the dirty
[2:33:28] Jews and we can rule the world from
[2:33:33] Jerusalem doesn't matter what conqueror
[2:33:36] you're talking
[2:33:37] about now underneath this 400e period
[2:33:42] gymnasiums were
[2:33:44] built in in in in Israel and around the
[2:33:47] world where Jewish and Greek
[2:33:51] athletes please understand that the
[2:33:54] Olympics as an event was a religious
[2:33:58] event and it was in praise to false
[2:34:03] gods I am not trying to indicate that
[2:34:08] someone who competes today is doing it
[2:34:11] in the name of a false god but I'm
[2:34:13] telling you the origins of it were
[2:34:16] filthy and in Israel hear me now in
[2:34:20] Israel gymnasiums were built where Jews
[2:34:23] and Greeks
[2:34:26] competed in various indoor
[2:34:31] competitions remember all competitions
[2:34:34] up to this time even in Rome were
[2:34:37] outdoor
[2:34:39] events held in something like circus
[2:34:43] maximus's or colise
[2:34:47] Ms now they're coming inside to a
[2:34:50] gymnasium a closed in building nothing
[2:34:52] wrong with the
[2:34:54] gymnasium but what they decided to do
[2:34:58] was to let the men stay with
[2:35:01] me to compete
[2:35:05] naked now if you don't think that would
[2:35:08] feed a perverted wrong
[2:35:11] Spirit and the reason why they does
[2:35:13] anybody know
[2:35:15] why because they wanted everybody to
[2:35:17] know the difference between a Jew and a
[2:35:23] Greek the Jews would be circumcised and
[2:35:26] they were the only
[2:35:28] people circumcising the the forkin of
[2:35:32] the male member during this time why did
[2:35:34] they do that because it was a
[2:35:35] commandment from
[2:35:36] God God said I not only want you to be
[2:35:39] known in
[2:35:41] public but I want you to be known in
[2:35:43] private that's right because remember
[2:35:46] the influence of the baths was already
[2:35:48] in the land of Israel and and public
[2:35:52] bathrooms and I have gone today the
[2:35:54] ruins of some of these bathrooms are
[2:35:56] still there and they're just holes in
[2:35:58] stone sitting right beside one another
[2:36:01] where where men would go in and go to
[2:36:03] the bathroom right in front of everybody
[2:36:04] the culture of the Greek and the Romans
[2:36:07] was to put the body on
[2:36:09] display and that's why there's so many
[2:36:11] ruins of naked statues around from that
[2:36:15] time period
[2:36:17] and they did consider the human body as
[2:36:19] a form of Art and there's nothing wrong
[2:36:21] with that except for the fact that they
[2:36:25] were using that to
[2:36:30] cheat to
[2:36:33] differentiate to show
[2:36:36] racism toward the
[2:36:40] circumcised remember that Jews had been
[2:36:44] heniz Greek IED during this
[2:36:48] period their hair in in many places in
[2:36:53] Israel the Jews had now trimmed nearly
[2:36:56] shaved their
[2:37:00] hair because of
[2:37:03] heniz they had been strongly
[2:37:07] urged and later forced to shave their
[2:37:12] facial
[2:37:14] hair
[2:37:18] a
[2:37:19] man under the natural design of his
[2:37:23] body with the proper balance of
[2:37:27] hormones is to have facial
[2:37:31] hair
[2:37:33] on it's not so attractive for a
[2:37:37] woman and under Norm you can laugh it's
[2:37:40] funny unless you've got the problem then
[2:37:44] it's not very funny it's hard I feel
[2:37:46] sorry for sisters who have to battle the
[2:37:49] balancing of the hormones to get things
[2:37:51] right don't make fun of
[2:37:53] it understand that it's a serious
[2:37:56] problem but wasn't in in the normal
[2:37:58] balance of the of the chemicals of the
[2:38:00] body a woman would not have much of
[2:38:02] facial hair and and a man would but you
[2:38:05] see the the the Greeks the the seusd
[2:38:09] this whole influence that came out from
[2:38:11] under Alexander they didn't want the
[2:38:14] Jews to be no noticed as
[2:38:17] Jews so they wanted everybody to look
[2:38:20] like
[2:38:21] Greeks I want you to hear this if I need
[2:38:24] to call your name I will to make sure
[2:38:26] you're listening to what I'm saying so
[2:38:29] they wanted everybody to have the same
[2:38:34] haircut it's kind of like the world
[2:38:36] operates
[2:38:38] today they want everybody to have the
[2:38:40] same haircut and they wanted Jews who
[2:38:42] under the Commandments of their
[2:38:44] scripture were not to shave the corners
[2:38:47] of their
[2:38:49] beards which means that they were not to
[2:38:53] to shape it into some kind of design
[2:38:57] that was more
[2:39:01] Pagan today we would look at it sort
[2:39:04] more like a what do you call it
[2:39:09] goatee they were to leave it pretty
[2:39:13] much to its natural B
[2:39:16] orders it was not wrong under C circum
[2:39:20] certain circumstances to trim it so that
[2:39:22] it didn't get in your
[2:39:26] soup but they quit trimming it Jews quit
[2:39:30] trimming it because they
[2:39:33] misinterpreted the corners of the Beards
[2:39:36] to mean side
[2:39:38] curls and this is why the ultra Orthodox
[2:39:42] hidic Jew has the side curls that's why
[2:39:45] boy born into that family doesn't have
[2:39:47] his first haircut till he's three years
[2:39:49] old because they want to give him a head
[2:39:52] start on his P his his uh side
[2:39:56] curls so they've got all these ideas now
[2:39:58] the Greeks come in and they they
[2:40:01] strongly urge them later force them to
[2:40:07] scrape how natural does that
[2:40:11] sound you're going to get quiet I'm not
[2:40:15] preaching
[2:40:17] Doctrine I'm telling you how it
[2:40:20] started they didn't want them to look
[2:40:22] like
[2:40:24] Jews not in public in private in the
[2:40:28] gymnasium they wanted to be able to know
[2:40:30] because if there was any any any any
[2:40:32] cheating going on of course the Jew
[2:40:34] would be the one the circumcised man
[2:40:36] would be the one doing it it was it was
[2:40:38] a Prejudice it was a racist thing but in
[2:40:42] public their desire was to get all the
[2:40:45] Jews to look more and more like the
[2:40:48] Greeks so some were forced to take sharp
[2:40:52] rocks and objects and start scraping
[2:40:56] off skin and pores and blood and hair
[2:41:03] because they didn't want the Jews
[2:41:04] looking like God had told them to look
[2:41:07] according to the scriptures anybody with
[2:41:08] me so I know that the world has made a
[2:41:12] beard a worldly thing I was under that
[2:41:15] same idea for many years coming out of
[2:41:17] the apostolic and Holiness
[2:41:19] Church but but
[2:41:22] really the opposite is
[2:41:25] true it was the
[2:41:27] influence of the
[2:41:30] heniz the solid the Greeks and the
[2:41:33] Romans that wanted
[2:41:35] men basically basically to look like
[2:41:42] women women were cutting their hair in
[2:41:46] Corinth at the time of Paul women were
[2:41:50] shaving their heads and wearing short
[2:41:57] wigs because they Jewish women because
[2:42:01] they didn't want to stand
[2:42:03] out they were treated so
[2:42:08] bad that they didn't want to stand out
[2:42:10] in society so Jewish women sometimes in
[2:42:13] Corinth and other cities that shaved off
[2:42:16] their head and wore short
[2:42:19] wigs so that the length of the hair was
[2:42:21] more similar to the length of a man's
[2:42:23] hair I want you to know that that
[2:42:26] spirit that tries to blend the
[2:42:30] genders was already in the Earth the
[2:42:32] Bible say and wait till I tell you what
[2:42:35] Spirit it is it's the spirit of
[2:42:39] antichrist the Bible said the spirit of
[2:42:41] antichrist does already
[2:42:43] work in the new New Testament the spirit
[2:42:47] of antichrist is the spirit of
[2:42:50] anti-Semitism that's one of the
[2:42:53] spirits the Prejudice Spirit against the
[2:42:56] Jews is one of the very spirits that
[2:43:00] operates under the
[2:43:02] umbrella of
[2:43:04] antichrist the spirit that causes a man
[2:43:07] to want to be a woman and a woman want
[2:43:09] to be a man to be binary to be neither
[2:43:13] male nor female right
[2:43:16] for women to dress the
[2:43:18] bush and men to dress the
[2:43:22] queer that Spirit falls under the
[2:43:28] umbrella I can't help it it takes my
[2:43:32] breath I don't want to be ugly I don't
[2:43:35] want to mistreat anybody sir but I
[2:43:37] cannot help when a when a lumberjack
[2:43:40] walks over to the table and says
[2:43:44] hello
[2:43:46] it takes me by
[2:43:48] surprise I want to understand the
[2:43:51] struggles of all
[2:43:52] mankind but I want you to know it falls
[2:43:56] under the umbrella of the spirit of
[2:43:59] antichrist and I don't want anything to
[2:44:01] do with it any spirit that tries to
[2:44:04] dehumanize a Jew operates under the
[2:44:07] spirit of
[2:44:09] antichrist for you to despise the Feast
[2:44:12] of the Lord hear me now to despise the
[2:44:16] Feast of the Lord is to operate under
[2:44:19] the umbrella of the spirit of
[2:44:24] antichrist the spirit of antichrist is
[2:44:28] not a spirit that is against Christ it
[2:44:30] is a spirit that seeks to replace
[2:44:33] Christ the spirit of anti-Semitism and
[2:44:37] these other branches that I have
[2:44:39] mentioned or or is the spirit that
[2:44:42] desires to replace yes sir
[2:44:45] the Jew with the
[2:44:48] church the Jew with a Greek on a man
[2:44:52] with a woman right a woman with a man
[2:44:55] brother brandham saw these Spirits
[2:44:58] operating in the 50s and 60s when a
[2:45:00] woman would take a
[2:45:03] [Music]
[2:45:04] poodle I need another hour when a woman
[2:45:08] would choose a poodle rather than to
[2:45:12] disfigure right her body and
[2:45:16] childbirth that's right he said there's
[2:45:18] something wrong with this woman carrying
[2:45:21] this fuu around in her purse refusing to
[2:45:23] give her husband a
[2:45:27] child he saw that as a spirit operating
[2:45:31] against the family
[2:45:33] structure let me tell you something I
[2:45:35] want to say this I tell you I feel good
[2:45:37] today I I ought to just preach on uh God
[2:45:42] loves
[2:45:44] families
[2:45:48] he loves for families to function
[2:45:52] together in
[2:45:54] wholeness that's right and
[2:45:57] godliness and he hat Satan hates the
[2:46:01] family and he wants the woman to control
[2:46:05] the
[2:46:07] house if he can have the woman
[2:46:09] controlling the house then he can change
[2:46:13] everything about the spirit of the
[2:46:16] family now don't you get on your high
[2:46:19] horse
[2:46:19] man because every Moses needs us as
[2:46:23] Fara even Abraham needed a Sarah
[2:46:27] sometimes we need to be
[2:46:29] reminded sometimes we need to be
[2:46:31] corrected sometimes we need to be helped
[2:46:38] supported we're not ashamed I'm not
[2:46:40] ashamed sir to say that I can't do it
[2:46:43] all I need need help but I don't believe
[2:46:46] that the woman should rule the house or
[2:46:49] lead the
[2:46:53] house I think men are wrong when they
[2:46:55] put the woman under the burden of
[2:47:00] finances and then blame
[2:47:03] her if there's not enough to go around
[2:47:06] you take the book that's
[2:47:09] right you do the
[2:47:11] job you be
[2:47:13] responsible see how you like
[2:47:16] it you can only do so much with
[2:47:21] peanuts come on now God loves the family
[2:47:24] he loves
[2:47:29] families I need another water whoever
[2:47:31] could help me please I it don't doesn't
[2:47:35] matter so
[2:47:38] gymnasiums naked
[2:47:41] competition to distinguish the
[2:47:43] circumcised Jew from the uncir
[2:47:44] circumcised Greek wealthy Jews were
[2:47:47] forced to forsake Hebrew as their
[2:47:50] language of choice and learn or Aramaic
[2:47:54] as it was being spoken in that day which
[2:47:56] is certainly nearly nearly Hebrew in
[2:47:59] many many many
[2:48:01] ways but they wanted the common man to
[2:48:05] speak Greek which proved nearly
[2:48:12] impossible to believe the scholars
[2:48:16] when they tell us that the New Testament
[2:48:18] was not written in
[2:48:20] Hebrew is sheer
[2:48:24] ignorance because every one of these men
[2:48:29] were not
[2:48:31] lawyers all the gospel writers were not
[2:48:34] highly educated
[2:48:37] men they could not have
[2:48:39] communicated in
[2:48:42] Greek as years went by more more of the
[2:48:45] common men began to try to learn Greek
[2:48:48] but they were writing in
[2:48:50] Hebrew that was later translated to
[2:48:54] Greek and later there are there there
[2:48:57] were forces that
[2:48:59] be that tried to destroy the
[2:49:02] Hebrew of for instance the four
[2:49:07] gospels they did it again an attempt to
[2:49:12] take it away from the Jewish people
[2:49:16] and to henize and to Greek eyes or
[2:49:19] romaniz these aren't words henize is a
[2:49:21] word it means the same thing even though
[2:49:25] scripture they wanted to have influence
[2:49:28] do you know that the reason why we had
[2:49:31] the Latin Vulgate do you know why the
[2:49:34] Bible was even translated uh into these
[2:49:37] other learned languages one of them by
[2:49:40] St Jerome do you know why it was even
[2:49:42] done it was done because they wanted
[2:49:44] wanted a copy of the Hebrew Bible in the
[2:49:49] library in
[2:49:51] Alexandria they wanted it sitting there
[2:49:54] as a trophy on a
[2:49:56] shelf and and what they did to get it
[2:50:00] was try to interpret the Hebrew
[2:50:03] scriptures the Hebrew
[2:50:05] Lifestyle the Hebrew
[2:50:08] mannerisms the Hebrew
[2:50:10] colloquialisms they were trying to
[2:50:12] understand them and squeeze them into G
[2:50:16] so most of the Bibles that we have today
[2:50:20] are
[2:50:21] translations from the
[2:50:24] Greek when in fact the Greek
[2:50:28] mindset was so forign from the Hebrew
[2:50:32] mindset that we can barely interpret the
[2:50:36] scriptures in this day we really need
[2:50:38] the holy spirit's help amen I believe
[2:50:42] that what is amazing is those beautiful
[2:50:46] times that the
[2:50:48] hebraisms come popping through the
[2:50:51] English Bible and remember that's a
[2:50:53] miracle because it has come from Greek
[2:50:55] Latin and finally into English or Latin
[2:50:59] Greek finally into English whichever the
[2:51:02] two because there's you know we have the
[2:51:03] septu agent and we we have other
[2:51:06] sources it's amazing it's amazing those
[2:51:09] times you cannot sons of Zion you cannot
[2:51:14] understand understand the Bible thinking
[2:51:16] like sons of
[2:51:19] gree you cannot understand the New
[2:51:21] Testament you cannot understand the New
[2:51:23] Covenant unless God gives us some
[2:51:26] understanding of the old Covenant that's
[2:51:28] why brother Brandon pointed us back to
[2:51:30] Passover and he pointed us back to the
[2:51:33] to the Feast of Pentecost and he pointed
[2:51:35] us back because the only way to
[2:51:38] understand the reality and fullness of
[2:51:39] the new is to have it based yes sir on
[2:51:42] the Fulfillment of the old you missed a
[2:51:45] good chance to say Amen so Hebrew names
[2:51:47] were discarded and the names that we
[2:51:50] call the men of the Bible are heniz
[2:51:54] names there was no John in bi in the
[2:51:58] Bible he was renamed John his name was
[2:52:03] johanan there was no
[2:52:05] James there was no there was no you you
[2:52:08] go through these name every name that we
[2:52:10] use there was no
[2:52:13] Moses
[2:52:15] these are heniz names that were used to
[2:52:18] to to point to the person
[2:52:21] Moshe what's his name this enemy wanted
[2:52:26] to rename
[2:52:28] them re-identify them mix them with the
[2:52:33] world water down their religion their
[2:52:36] faith steal their identity now you tell
[2:52:39] me that's not the spirit of
[2:52:42] antichrist Jewish men were in encouraged
[2:52:44] in some cases forced to scrape the hair
[2:52:46] from their faces and change their their
[2:52:49] hairstyles to soo the Greek culture I
[2:52:51] said that without my notes now do I have
[2:52:53] a few more minutes I'll never get this
[2:52:55] in
[2:52:56] 10 thank
[2:52:58] you I would like to read to you from the
[2:53:01] septu please don't fall out of your
[2:53:04] seat I'd like to read to you from the
[2:53:06] book or have David to then then it's on
[2:53:08] him he's responsible blame him I'd like
[2:53:12] to have him to read quickly one makabe
[2:53:16] now remember the macbes the book of
[2:53:18] macbes there were four of them they were
[2:53:20] never included in the Hebrew scripture
[2:53:22] but not for the reason that you would
[2:53:24] think they were not included in the
[2:53:26] Hebrew scripture because they they
[2:53:28] painted the
[2:53:30] hasmoneans or some people say
[2:53:33] hasmoneans they were they pointed them
[2:53:35] as true
[2:53:39] heroes remember that these were nonh
[2:53:42] heliz Jews right the Jews of the second
[2:53:46] temple period were highly heniz highly
[2:53:49] Greek right the the uh
[2:53:55] macbes who descended from the royal
[2:54:00] priesthood of the
[2:54:02] Bible through the family of the of the
[2:54:06] hasmoneans or
[2:54:09] Honan they were
[2:54:11] Heroes because they wouldn't bow to the
[2:54:14] culture of the day not even to the
[2:54:17] average
[2:54:18] Jew so that's why the books were never
[2:54:20] added to the Hebrew scripture they made
[2:54:22] the rebels look like
[2:54:25] Heroes and the religious faithful look
[2:54:28] like zeros
[2:54:30] right the Protestants didn't want the
[2:54:33] book and so although it was a part of
[2:54:36] the septu agent for for many many many
[2:54:39] many
[2:54:40] years the Protestants decided they
[2:54:42] didn't want it because it was m mainly a
[2:54:44] historical book and not necessary to be
[2:54:47] a part of the scripture so I agree today
[2:54:50] with the Protestants and I tell you I
[2:54:52] don't believe that this is a a book that
[2:54:54] has to be added to the Canon of the
[2:54:57] scripture I don't believe that it is a
[2:54:59] sacred book in the sense that it should
[2:55:01] be added to the Canon of our Bible
[2:55:05] although any Catholic Bible would have
[2:55:08] these four books in
[2:55:10] there but they are powerful eyewitness
[2:55:15] accounts of what happened during the
[2:55:18] intertestamental period so David read
[2:55:21] for me just a
[2:55:22] moment I got to
[2:55:24] hurry on the 15th day of the month of
[2:55:28] klev in the year 145 King Antiochus set
[2:55:33] up the awful horror on the altar of the
[2:55:36] temple and Pagan altars were built in
[2:55:38] the towns throughout
[2:55:40] Judea Pagan sacrifices were offered in
[2:55:43] front of the house houses and in the
[2:55:45] streets any books of the law which were
[2:55:47] found were torn up and
[2:55:49] burned and anyone who was caught with a
[2:55:52] copy of the Sacred books or who obeyed
[2:55:55] the law was put to death by order of the
[2:55:58] king month after month these Wicked
[2:56:01] people used their power against the
[2:56:03] Israelites caught in the towns on the
[2:56:06] 25th of the month these same evil people
[2:56:10] offered sacrifices on the Pagan altar
[2:56:12] erected on top of the in altar in the
[2:56:15] temple I'm going I'm I'm getting mad now
[2:56:18] yes
[2:56:19] sir I'm getting mad
[2:56:22] now this
[2:56:26] Antiochus I
[2:56:28] fourth his father Antiochus
[2:56:31] III can be pronounced either way
[2:56:34] Antiochus or
[2:56:36] anticus
[2:56:38] was a Greek helenistic king de descended
[2:56:44] from the
[2:56:46] solids who ruled the sald Empire from
[2:56:51] 175 BCE until his death in 164 BCE
[2:56:55] remember it goes
[2:56:56] down he was the acting king of Syria
[2:57:00] when he marched into Jerusalem Syria
[2:57:04] right you know those missiles yes sir
[2:57:07] coming from Syria yes sir to the land of
[2:57:11] Israel he was a Syrian King and he
[2:57:14] captured Jerusalem in 167 BCE in a
[2:57:18] minute I'm going to tell you why I light
[2:57:21] a
[2:57:23] candle and in a minute I'm going to tell
[2:57:26] you why we burn a lamp and why we
[2:57:29] remember the Feast of
[2:57:31] Hanukkah on and why you're too late come
[2:57:35] on to change my
[2:57:37] mind I
[2:57:39] recognize that Antichrist
[2:57:43] spirit yes
[2:57:45] indeed Pagan
[2:57:49] sacrifices offered in front of houses of
[2:57:53] Jews now when we say when when the
[2:57:56] mccabes wrote Pagan sacrifices do you
[2:57:58] know what it was Pig yes
[2:58:01] sir so Jews were forced to stay in their
[2:58:04] homes because pigs were being burned
[2:58:07] outside their doors most Hebrew homes
[2:58:10] didn't have a back
[2:58:11] door so they are forced to stay in their
[2:58:14] homes until that is burned up and in
[2:58:18] some cases removed the the any copies
[2:58:21] and only rich people only Rich Priestly
[2:58:24] families had copies of the scroll of the
[2:58:27] law and anyone who was caught in
[2:58:30] possession of a Bible let's say a Bible
[2:58:32] today because that's what we understand
[2:58:34] was forced to turn it in and stand and
[2:58:37] watch it burn those dogs burn the
[2:58:42] Bible come on they offered pigs in front
[2:58:47] of my house come on come on now do you
[2:58:51] understand what I'm
[2:58:54] saying they shaved my beard they made me
[2:58:58] cut my hair to look more like a
[2:59:01] woman so that I could fit Society they
[2:59:04] wouldn't let me speak my own
[2:59:07] language they tried to force a language
[2:59:10] that I was too ignorant to
[2:59:12] learn right then they begin to kill
[2:59:17] us one by one by one if we wouldn't bend
[2:59:21] if we wouldn't bow if we wouldn't
[2:59:24] henize if we wouldn't do what they
[2:59:28] did if they caught us doing what Jews do
[2:59:32] I'm saying us because I want you to know
[2:59:34] how personal I take this because when I
[2:59:37] read to you I feel something here now
[2:59:40] when I read to you that there's one new
[2:59:42] man and we are grafted in I get a little
[2:59:46] emotional yes and when I tell you what
[2:59:49] brother brandham said when he said I
[2:59:51] rode with George Washington over the
[2:59:52] Delaware River and I rode with v r
[2:59:57] yes when I hear brother bandom say I
[3:00:00] stood there with those Hebrew boys in
[3:00:03] the
[3:00:05] furnace it it lets me know how I did I
[3:00:09] did it by
[3:00:11] identification brother Brandon wasn't at
[3:00:13] the tomb
[3:00:14] brother Brandon wasn't at the Delaware
[3:00:16] brother Brandon wasn't in the fiery
[3:00:18] furnace but he said I'm
[3:00:20] identified with the god of the
[3:00:23] Bible you hear what I'm saying it was my
[3:00:26] children they stole out of my
[3:00:29] arms it was my children they tried to
[3:00:32] surgically
[3:00:37] uncircumcised they were taking the
[3:00:40] babies and trying to surgically un
[3:00:43] circumcised them they took tiny babies
[3:00:47] from their mother's arms crucified
[3:00:51] them and hung them on a chain around the
[3:00:54] mother's
[3:00:58] neck so that everywhere mother
[3:01:05] went and you get
[3:01:08] upset because I light a
[3:01:12] candle to remember what an antichrist
[3:01:15] Spirit tried to do to my people or
[3:01:18] because I eat a potato
[3:01:20] pancake that offends you because I
[3:01:23] mentioned
[3:01:24] Hanukkah while you're standing around
[3:01:27] the Pagan Christmas
[3:01:30] tree it's an
[3:01:32] antichrist
[3:01:34] spirit and if my children are ashamed of
[3:01:37] it I won't
[3:01:40] be if my church people are ashamed of it
[3:01:43] I won't be I'm not asking anybody to
[3:01:46] participate in what I do but I'm not
[3:01:48] apologizing to anybody for what I do I
[3:01:53] have never worshiped a
[3:01:57] candle I would much rather use the oil
[3:02:00] like sister Joyce did do you
[3:02:02] still it has nothing to do with the
[3:02:05] candle the wax or the oil for me it's a
[3:02:10] remembrance that that that Antichrist
[3:02:13] Spirit tried to destroy the
[3:02:17] Jews just like
[3:02:20] Hamas come crawling out of the tunnels
[3:02:23] on October the
[3:02:26] 7th and tried to
[3:02:29] murder and these educated idiots in this
[3:02:32] country who March up and down the street
[3:02:35] and scream from The River To The
[3:02:38] Sea are under an antichrist
[3:02:42] delusion they have no idea what it's
[3:02:46] like to be one of the hated or one of
[3:02:49] the hunted but I do because I have
[3:02:53] identified myself with the suffering of
[3:02:56] God's people I had family members
[3:02:59] murdered in the Holocaust I am
[3:03:02] Associated and identified with the
[3:03:04] Jewish people so you keep your Easter
[3:03:09] Bunny you keep your stocking on the on
[3:03:12] the on the mantle
[3:03:14] and you tell me how that has anything to
[3:03:16] do with the scripture but don't you get
[3:03:18] yourself all twisted up because I take
[3:03:21] time every year to remember the Feast of
[3:03:23] the
[3:03:24] Lord including one like
[3:03:29] this do I sound angry oh come on you
[3:03:32] know I
[3:03:36] do this is been my reality since October
[3:03:39] the 7th I've lived this I've eaten this
[3:03:42] I've drank this I've slept this I'm up
[3:03:45] in the middle of the night looking at my
[3:03:47] phone I'm up in the middle of the night
[3:03:50] to the bombs to the alarms right sister
[3:03:54] uh man tried to get it on the phone and
[3:03:57] and I think no it's no longer on the on
[3:03:59] the iPhone allowed outside of the land
[3:04:01] of Israel but because I downloaded it in
[3:04:03] Israel I still can have
[3:04:05] it and I'm notified every time that
[3:04:08] radar catches a a missile coming out of
[3:04:12] of from Hezbollah
[3:04:14] or the hoodies are from Gaza and I get
[3:04:17] up in the middle of the night and I
[3:04:19] scroll them by the
[3:04:21] hundreds and I've seen the
[3:04:24] videos and I've watched the videos of B
[3:04:27] burned babies and it reminds me of a
[3:04:32] time right here between the Old
[3:04:34] Testament and the New
[3:04:36] Testament so it's a little bit more to
[3:04:39] me I say this sometime in Jess but it's
[3:04:42] a little bit more to me this morning
[3:04:44] than they tried to kill us we won let's
[3:04:47] eat it's we must
[3:04:52] remember because we're sending our
[3:04:54] children to
[3:04:57] universities where the uneducated idiots
[3:05:00] or the educated idiots can't even answer
[3:05:04] a question presented to them the
[3:05:06] president of
[3:05:08] Harvard can't even answer a question if
[3:05:12] this is against the policy
[3:05:14] if it was if it was a prejudice against
[3:05:17] a homosexual or a transvestite or a
[3:05:20] binary somebody
[3:05:23] confused nobody would have a problem
[3:05:25] standing up for them but because the
[3:05:28] Antichrist spirit is so prevalent in the
[3:05:31] land and anti-Semitism is celebrated in
[3:05:34] the universities of our nation and many
[3:05:37] other with nobody it seems at time to
[3:05:40] stand
[3:05:41] up come on when a Jew transfers out of
[3:05:45] his university because of anti-Semitism
[3:05:48] and hides at Penn State or pen
[3:05:51] University of
[3:05:53] Pennsylvania hides there because he's
[3:05:56] told that
[3:05:57] anti-Semitism is is hardly known and now
[3:06:01] because of October the
[3:06:03] 7th because of raped women and burned
[3:06:06] babies and beheaded
[3:06:10] grandmothers this Spirit has risen up in
[3:06:13] this land and they don't know how to
[3:06:15] answer a simple question does this does
[3:06:17] this violate the
[3:06:19] policy if it doesn't you need another
[3:06:23] policy to run through the streets
[3:06:25] screaming from The River To The Sea
[3:06:27] doesn't mean Equal justice for the
[3:06:30] Palestinians or equal justice for the
[3:06:32] Arabs means nothing like that it means
[3:06:35] the total Annihilation it means we will
[3:06:38] drive every Jew into the sea and watch
[3:06:40] them gurgle until they gurgle no more
[3:06:43] because we're so against the god of the
[3:06:47] Bible we're so against a God that
[3:06:50] differentiates between men and women
[3:06:52] we're so against a God that
[3:06:54] differentiates between the righteous and
[3:06:56] the
[3:07:04] filthy I'm closing after a
[3:07:07] while this will this may be took off of
[3:07:12] YouTube
[3:07:17] but we're talking
[3:07:18] about
[3:07:20] recapturing cleansing and rededicating
[3:07:24] our
[3:07:28] Temple and the brides got to do it I
[3:07:31] hope I'm not upsetting anybody too
[3:07:34] much Antiochus i 4 epiphanies which
[3:07:37] means god
[3:07:39] manifested he believed that he was God
[3:07:42] In the Flesh
[3:07:45] he commanded that sacrifices be made to
[3:07:48] Zeus or to Jupiter on the altar that he
[3:07:53] had built over the altar of the Holy
[3:07:57] Temple can you imagine it's one thing
[3:08:00] what you do in your church but when you
[3:08:02] come into my church and try to redo or
[3:08:05] undo you understand what I'm saying he
[3:08:07] could have made his own a palace he
[3:08:10] could have had a palace he built he
[3:08:13] built the
[3:08:15] Fortress looking over the Temple Mount
[3:08:19] he raised up Towers to constantly spy on
[3:08:22] the Jews he could have built his own
[3:08:24] Temple the temple to Antiochus epifanes
[3:08:27] I
[3:08:28] 4th but instead he wasn't satisfied to
[3:08:31] have his own filthy house of worship he
[3:08:34] wanted to come into the house dedicated
[3:08:36] and consecrated to the god of Abraham
[3:08:39] Isaac and Jacob he wanted to build a
[3:08:41] filthy Pagan altar over the the altar
[3:08:43] that had been used to receive the
[3:08:47] offerings as commanded in the scripture
[3:08:50] and then later he wanted to raise up a
[3:08:52] statue of
[3:08:53] himself and he did called it God right
[3:08:58] next to the statue that he raised up of
[3:08:59] Zeus or or Jupiter the same God
[3:09:02] according to the Greek or the Roman
[3:09:03] culture whichever one you're looking at
[3:09:05] the final act it was more than they
[3:09:08] could
[3:09:09] stand we we we stood back when you when
[3:09:13] you forc Jews to scrape their faces to
[3:09:15] look like Greeks we stood back when you
[3:09:18] wouldn't let our children play
[3:09:20] traditional
[3:09:22] games that they had played since coming
[3:09:24] out of Egypt we stood
[3:09:29] back when you tried to force a needle in
[3:09:31] our
[3:09:34] arm I I may be getting my time frames
[3:09:37] mixed up here a little
[3:09:39] bit we stood back and we didn't do
[3:09:42] anything
[3:09:44] and we let it go on because we wanted to
[3:09:45] live peaceably with all citizens of
[3:09:49] Israel but now you're just about to push
[3:09:52] us over the edge now uh uh Mr uh
[3:09:56] Antiochus God
[3:09:59] manifested because now you have not only
[3:10:02] desecrated our homes with your Pig's
[3:10:04] blood but you have offered and on that
[3:10:07] day that famed day that David was
[3:10:09] reading
[3:10:10] about is the day that he walked in
[3:10:14] to the temple and offered a fat swine a
[3:10:17] big fat pig on this altar that he had
[3:10:21] erected totally desecrating the house of
[3:10:23] God totally desecrating all that was
[3:10:26] holy and
[3:10:28] righteous slapping in the face for
[3:10:31] centuries of priests that had walked up
[3:10:34] those steps to honor God to lift up the
[3:10:38] name of God to sing the songs of God to
[3:10:42] to point people to the god of the Bible
[3:10:45] Dishonored them
[3:10:48] all to try to turn people's worship
[3:10:51] toward him he had introduced Pagan
[3:10:54] prostitution in the temple of God all
[3:10:57] other Pagan cultures had Temple
[3:10:59] prostitutes and a man could receive
[3:11:02] special favors in their religion by
[3:11:04] laying with one of those Temple
[3:11:06] prostitutes and so Antiochus brought
[3:11:08] them to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem the
[3:11:10] only place at that time where God said I
[3:11:12] put my name is right here in this city
[3:11:15] can you imagine being a Jew on in
[3:11:19] [Music]
[3:11:21] modin a little village between Jerusalem
[3:11:24] and the Sea
[3:11:27] modin I've taken my children there and
[3:11:29] we've walked among the graves of the
[3:11:32] mccabes I've showed them the
[3:11:34] village where
[3:11:37] Mattias the
[3:11:39] priest
[3:11:41] served lived raised five boys including
[3:11:46] Judah
[3:11:48] mccabes I've showed them the history of
[3:11:52] a of a rag tag bunch of boys who said we
[3:11:56] stood back we watched you do this we
[3:11:59] watched you take that we watched you
[3:12:02] change this but now you're getting too
[3:12:05] close to home yes and our Hasan blood's
[3:12:09] boiling in our veins and we are not
[3:12:11] going to take your heniz anymore you're
[3:12:15] not going to you're not going to shove
[3:12:17] your tree down my throat
[3:12:19] anymore I'm going to speak up for what's
[3:12:21] right if it hair lips the devil and
[3:12:23] bankrupts
[3:12:26] Hell Judah McCabe's father lost his life
[3:12:30] took their circumcised babies from them
[3:12:32] as I told you a moment ago they killed
[3:12:34] anyone who had a copy of the Bible
[3:12:36] biblical text after they burned it in
[3:12:38] front of them they forbid any any Jewish
[3:12:41] baby to be circumcised they they forbid
[3:12:43] that anyone should observe the sabbath
[3:12:47] they forbid that anyone should require a
[3:12:49] Kosher diet they forbid that anyone
[3:12:52] should study the
[3:12:56] law and on that day the day we read
[3:12:59] about the Blasphemous King ascends the
[3:13:02] steps of the temple in Jerusalem he has
[3:13:04] conquered the nation of Israel and now
[3:13:05] wants to eradicate the Jews by
[3:13:07] eradicating Judaism the King enters the
[3:13:09] temple declares himself to be God
[3:13:11] manifest on the Earth and and then
[3:13:12] sacrifices a fat pig on the holy altar
[3:13:15] that has now been dedicated to Zeus or
[3:13:17] Jupiter perhaps fulfilling a portion a
[3:13:20] portion here this fulfilling a portion
[3:13:22] of Daniel's prophecy concerning the
[3:13:24] abomination of
[3:13:26] desolation we believe that according to
[3:13:29] Jesus who also spoke of the abomination
[3:13:31] of desolation that there will be a
[3:13:34] further a further manifestation in the
[3:13:36] days of
[3:13:37] antichrist but the Deeds of Antiochus
[3:13:40] epiphanes were so
[3:13:43] vile that everyone in history looks at
[3:13:47] him as a prototype of the
[3:13:51] Antichrist in seeking to prohibit
[3:13:54] Judaism and to henize the Jews and tyus
[3:13:57] forbade their religious practices and
[3:13:59] followed up this abominable act by
[3:14:01] requiring every Jew to present the
[3:14:03] copies of the law to be burned I want to
[3:14:05] read from Josephus just a moment
[3:14:08] Josephus is a contemporary give me just
[3:14:10] a few more minutes please please I'm
[3:14:12] sorry but I give me a few more minutes
[3:14:15] can't leave you hanging here Josephus
[3:14:18] was a contemporary of Matthew Mark Luke
[3:14:20] and John his words are not inspired he
[3:14:24] was considered by his Brethren a
[3:14:29] turncoat but he wrote a historically
[3:14:32] accurate
[3:14:34] document as an eyewitness to many of the
[3:14:36] things that took place including the
[3:14:38] ministry of Jesus this is what he wrote
[3:14:41] about what happened
[3:14:43] Antiochus got possession of the City by
[3:14:46] treachery at at which time he spared not
[3:14:49] so much as those that admitted him into
[3:14:51] it in fact the very the very ones that
[3:14:55] slipped him into the city so that he
[3:14:56] could conquer it he killed him
[3:14:59] first did you know that some of the
[3:15:01] first people that were murdered on
[3:15:02] October the 7th were actually
[3:15:06] peacekeeping kib
[3:15:09] butnik men and women who lived in kib
[3:15:12] seim on the border of Gaza who dedicated
[3:15:16] their lives to driving risking their
[3:15:18] life driving into Gaza knowing that
[3:15:21] Hamas could could attack them at any
[3:15:23] time to take sick children
[3:15:26] out one of the women who was killed that
[3:15:28] day one of the women that was taken into
[3:15:30] hostages worked with with or founded one
[3:15:33] of them founded an organization the
[3:15:35] other one worked with an organization
[3:15:37] that was physically going in bringing
[3:15:40] sick Palestinian children out play
[3:15:42] placing them in the care of Jewish
[3:15:43] doctors and after they received their
[3:15:45] treatments Etc driving them
[3:15:48] back did you know that the Rave they
[3:15:51] call it it was certainly wasn't Godly
[3:15:52] music these were not religious Jews did
[3:15:55] you know that that was that was supposed
[3:15:57] to be a peace promoting
[3:16:01] event and that there were Israeli
[3:16:04] Arabs at that event and there were
[3:16:08] foreign workers from the nations of the
[3:16:10] world at that event and it was an event
[3:16:12] that was promoted to promote
[3:16:15] peace between Arabs and
[3:16:18] Jews and many of the people who lived in
[3:16:22] the kabut on the borders were were men
[3:16:25] and women who had worked closely with
[3:16:27] Palestinian men and women families for
[3:16:31] many
[3:16:32] years and did you know they were so
[3:16:35] friendly toward the Palestinians that
[3:16:37] they allowed them to come in the border
[3:16:40] and work in their homes
[3:16:43] and in their kabut and trusted
[3:16:47] them all the while they were learning
[3:16:51] the
[3:16:53] layout drawing pictures of their homes
[3:16:57] showing on a map where the safe rooms
[3:17:00] were and selling that information to
[3:17:04] Hamas and I have to listen every day as
[3:17:07] many of them are called innocent
[3:17:09] Palestinians knowing that so many of
[3:17:12] them have sold
[3:17:16] Secrets can you imagine the ultimate
[3:17:19] betrayal of serving taking care of a
[3:17:22] woman's baby helping helping care for a
[3:17:24] family with small children as a as a a
[3:17:28] pair or whatever they call them all the
[3:17:31] while making
[3:17:32] notes so that enemies can come in and
[3:17:35] steal those children out of their
[3:17:37] mother's arms come on now
[3:17:38] really and I'm not supposed to get
[3:17:41] emotional or I should shouldn't mention
[3:17:42] it too much or or I shouldn't light a
[3:17:45] candle for Hanukkah eight simple little
[3:17:47] nights to remember the suffering or I
[3:17:50] shouldn't visit the Holocaust Museum or
[3:17:52] I shouldn't try to mix Judaism with the
[3:17:55] message or mix the Old Testament with
[3:17:57] the New Testament or anything else that
[3:17:59] you've ever said or heard said about
[3:18:02] me are you blind are you dumb are you
[3:18:04] deaf can't you see the spirit that's
[3:18:08] operating in the world around
[3:18:10] us on
[3:18:12] don't you get the connection by
[3:18:16] now and do you think for one moment that
[3:18:19] you and I will escape the same kind of
[3:18:23] attack don't you know that that we are
[3:18:25] hated it's not a people it's a spirit
[3:18:28] don't you know Antichrist hates you
[3:18:30] don't you know the spirit of antichrist
[3:18:33] would like to destroy you don't you
[3:18:35] women know the spirit of antichrist
[3:18:36] would like to see you Bob your hair and
[3:18:38] paint your face oh yeah oh don't you
[3:18:41] know that the spirit that presents
[3:18:43] another gospel another Christ would like
[3:18:46] to see us all just amalgamate and and
[3:18:49] and acclimate and mix right in the
[3:18:52] backslid church
[3:18:54] world or the Sleep message
[3:18:57] [Music]
[3:19:00] world
[3:19:04] can't so they let them in they let
[3:19:08] antias
[3:19:09] in as traitors and he they were the
[3:19:13] first he
[3:19:15] murdered no
[3:19:17] loyalty for he saw there was in it a
[3:19:19] great deal of gold and and on account of
[3:19:22] the riches that lay in the temple he
[3:19:24] wanted in for he saw there was in it a
[3:19:26] great deal of gold and many ornaments
[3:19:27] that had been dedicated to it of very
[3:19:29] great value and in order to plunder its
[3:19:31] wealth he ventured to break the league
[3:19:33] he had made so he left the temple bare
[3:19:35] he took away the golden candlesticks and
[3:19:37] the golden Altar and table and the Altar
[3:19:39] and did not abstain from even the the
[3:19:41] the most holy uh uh
[3:19:45] vessels and even the veils of linen and
[3:19:49] Scarlet he stole he also emptied it of
[3:19:52] the secret treasures and left nothing at
[3:19:54] all remaining and by this means cast the
[3:19:56] Jews into great lamentation for he
[3:19:58] forbade them to offer those daily
[3:20:00] sacrifices which they used to offer to
[3:20:02] God according to the law and when he had
[3:20:04] pillaged the whole city some of the
[3:20:06] inhabitants he slew and some he carried
[3:20:08] away captive together with their wives
[3:20:09] and children so that the multitude of
[3:20:12] those captives that were taken alive
[3:20:13] amounted that day to
[3:20:18] 10,000 he also burnt down the finest
[3:20:21] buildings and when he had overthrown the
[3:20:22] city walls he built a citadel in the
[3:20:24] lower part of the city for the place was
[3:20:25] high and overlooked the temple on which
[3:20:27] a county fortified it with high walls
[3:20:29] and towers and put into it a Garrison of
[3:20:31] macedonians however in that Citadel
[3:20:33] dwelt the impious and wicked part of the
[3:20:36] multitude from whom it proved that the
[3:20:38] citizen suffered many and sore
[3:20:40] calamities and when the king had built
[3:20:42] an altar an idle altar upon God's altar
[3:20:45] he slew swine upon it offered a
[3:20:46] sacrifice neither according to the law
[3:20:48] nor the Jewish religious worship in that
[3:20:50] country he also compelled them to
[3:20:51] forsake the worship which they paid to
[3:20:53] their own God and to adore Those whom he
[3:20:55] took to be gods and made them build
[3:20:57] temples and raise Idol altars in every
[3:20:59] city and V I tell you
[3:21:03] what he commanded them not to
[3:21:05] circumcised their sons he threatened
[3:21:07] punishment that any should be found to
[3:21:09] have transgressed his injunction he also
[3:21:11] pointed overseers who should compel them
[3:21:13] to do what he commanded and indeed many
[3:21:15] Jews there were also compiled with the
[3:21:17] king's commands either voluntarily or
[3:21:19] out of fear the penalty that was
[3:21:20] denounced but the best
[3:21:23] men and those of the noblest Souls did
[3:21:26] not regard him glory there comes a
[3:21:31] makabe there comes a Judah yes sir there
[3:21:35] comes a little ragtag family from the
[3:21:37] village of modin they did not regard him
[3:21:40] but did pay a greater respect to the
[3:21:42] customs of their country than concerned
[3:21:44] as to the punishment which he threatened
[3:21:46] to the disobedient on which account they
[3:21:48] every day underwent great miseries and
[3:21:50] bitter torments for they were whipped
[3:21:52] with rods their bodies Torn to Pieces
[3:21:54] they were crucified while they were
[3:21:56] still alive and breathed they also
[3:21:59] strangled those women and their sons
[3:22:00] whom they had circumcised as the king
[3:22:02] had appointed hanging their sons about
[3:22:04] their necks as they were upon the
[3:22:05] crosses and if there were any Sacred
[3:22:07] Book of the law found it destroyed and
[3:22:09] those with whom they were found
[3:22:10] miserably perished also and it goes on
[3:22:12] this is this is a historical record of
[3:22:15] what Antiochus did that day but
[3:22:18] God but
[3:22:21] God but God Zechariah 9:13 this
[3:22:24] scripture comes to my mind every time I
[3:22:26] look at the story and I'm closing for I
[3:22:28] have bent Judah for myself as my bow
[3:22:32] fill the bow with Ephraim as my arrow
[3:22:35] and will stir up your sons o
[3:22:39] Zion against your sons oh Greece
[3:22:42] and will make you Israel as the sword of
[3:22:45] a mighty man Hallelujah you believe the
[3:22:47] prophet saw it coming you believe
[3:22:49] zachari who often prophesied about the
[3:22:51] end of time and things not yet fulfilled
[3:22:53] do you believe that he knew what he was
[3:22:55] prophesying here when he said I've
[3:22:57] tooken Judah for me what Judah mean
[3:22:58] praise put it back for me would you
[3:23:00] Judah means praise I've taken Judah for
[3:23:02] myself as my bow fill the bow with
[3:23:04] Ephraim as my arrow and will stir up
[3:23:06] your sons oion brother sister it's time
[3:23:11] for the sons of Zion to be stirred
[3:23:15] up we saw one stirred up this morning in
[3:23:19] his
[3:23:20] praise I see them every time I gather
[3:23:23] here together the sons of Zion being
[3:23:25] stirred up not laying down bowing down
[3:23:29] to the to the spirit of
[3:23:37] compromise it started with one
[3:23:40] priest
[3:23:45] Mattias or in Hebrew mahu mahu metu it's
[3:23:49] hard to
[3:23:50] say the son of John from the village of
[3:23:54] moden and five Sons the most well known
[3:23:56] being Judah now as to Judah M known now
[3:24:00] referred to as Judah mccabes in the
[3:24:03] temple and altar to Zeus was erected and
[3:24:05] sacrifices were to be made at the feet
[3:24:07] of an idol in the image of the king
[3:24:09] against that desecration
[3:24:12] these macbes began to rise up Judah
[3:24:16] became the leader of the anti-greek Jews
[3:24:19] he led and aroused the hians or
[3:24:22] hasmoneans as a Guerilla war and several
[3:24:24] times they defeated the general can you
[3:24:27] imagine a family and a few called in to
[3:24:29] help many times defeated the general
[3:24:33] Antiochus and his generals that he had
[3:24:35] appointed to deal with the uprising stay
[3:24:37] with me just a moment but in December of
[3:24:40] 164
[3:24:42] he was
[3:24:43] able December of 164 he was able to
[3:24:47] enter the Holy
[3:24:48] Temple tear down the
[3:24:50] altar this was
[3:24:53] macbes Judah in December of 164 he was
[3:24:58] able to tear down the altar of Zeus and
[3:25:00] begin to reconsecrate the temple now
[3:25:04] just to show you by comparison we're
[3:25:07] talking about a few hundred men gathered
[3:25:09] under the hasmonean revolt
[3:25:12] can I tell you what Antiochus had at his
[3:25:15] command we know because the recorded
[3:25:18] history tells us that in
[3:25:21] 166 two years before this he filed a
[3:25:26] record of his army that had gathered at
[3:25:30] Daphne near Antioch and this was his
[3:25:33] possessions
[3:25:35] 46,000 foot soldiers how do a couple of
[3:25:39] hundred men overcome
[3:25:42] 46,000 foot soldiers among them a
[3:25:46] Macedonian flank of 20,000 men and 500
[3:25:51] mercenaries equipped with Roman
[3:25:54] arms followed by
[3:25:57] 8,500 men on Mighty war horses and let's
[3:26:01] not forget last but not least
[3:26:06] 36 armored
[3:26:10] elephants
[3:26:13] and a couple of
[3:26:15] hundred
[3:26:18] Jews it's a Miracle of
[3:26:21] Miracles so the the
[3:26:26] oil not recorded in any of these
[3:26:29] records only recorded in from talmudic
[3:26:33] times so many people believe it's a
[3:26:36] legend you know what I say it doesn't
[3:26:38] matter if they didn't find oil and if it
[3:26:41] didn't miraculously last for eight
[3:26:42] nights I kind of believe it did cuz that
[3:26:44] just reminds me of my
[3:26:46] God but if it didn't we already had a
[3:26:49] great miracle happen here just a few
[3:26:52] little Rebels said
[3:26:55] wait a minute Mr Antiochus wait a
[3:27:00] minute we're going to stand for the word
[3:27:03] we're going to stand for the god of
[3:27:10] Israel
[3:27:20] so that I don't have to read this this
[3:27:24] evening would you read for me David I
[3:27:27] won't preach anymore I'm done
[3:27:31] preaching would you read 1 mccabes 4:
[3:27:34] 36-
[3:27:36] 59 I want you to see the
[3:27:39] scene then said Judas and his brother
[3:27:42] Judas is Judah Judah his name was
[3:27:46] heniz Behold our enemies are discom
[3:27:49] fitted let us go up to cleanse and
[3:27:52] dedicate the
[3:27:54] sanctuary upon this all the hosts
[3:27:56] assembled themselves together and went
[3:27:59] up into Mount Zion can you see
[3:28:02] it can anybody stretch your mind to see
[3:28:07] it not a well equipped
[3:28:10] Army not fine armors and fine weapons

[3:28:39] someone busted the window here
[3:28:43] a young man come come here high strung
[3:28:47] out walking down this highway and he he
[3:28:50] came there Hawke actually saw him later
[3:28:52] didn't know that he had damaged the
[3:28:53] church and took him to his
[3:28:55] home later we discovered that he was
[3:28:58] cold and he wanted to get inside and the
[3:29:00] door was locked of course it was and he
[3:29:02] went and got a brick from off the pile
[3:29:04] and burst that window out but never got

[3:29:10] glass shattered clean out here into the

[3:29:21] out here in the aisle and we're down on
[3:29:23] our knees picking up that glass I want

[3:29:29] window before I even noted that window
[3:29:31] was out and replac and brother gy bought
[3:29:33] another window to replace it was it was

[3:29:41] if it was done to your home so violated
[3:29:45] the devil how could the devil get by
[3:29:48] with coming on to this property and
[3:29:50] bursting out a
[3:29:52] window you you know I'm an emotional
[3:29:54] person it ripped me it angered me it
[3:29:59] wounded me how would you feel if I come
[3:30:01] up the hill over there with you David
[3:30:03] and we found your home burnt ravished
[3:30:07] stolen and you found out it was only
[3:30:09] because you went to New
[3:30:12] hope you didn't wrong anybody steal from
[3:30:15] anybody cheat anybody but they found out
[3:30:18] you went to this church so they went up
[3:30:20] there what if Ashley had been
[3:30:24] taken the baby in her arms I want you
[3:30:27] before we go home today ask yourself
[3:30:30] these questions how would you feel now I
[3:30:33] want you to see if you can see these
[3:30:34] little Jews walking up the hill come on
[3:30:38] like David would walk up the hill like I
[3:30:40] would walk up up the hill like you would
[3:30:42] walk up the hill if you'd had enough
[3:30:44] enough is enough is
[3:30:46] enough if you don't stand for something
[3:30:48] you'll fall for anything and they saw
[3:30:51] the sanctuary desolate pigs Blood on the
[3:30:54] altar Gates burned up read and the
[3:30:57] shrubs growing in the quarts as in a
[3:30:59] forest or in one of the mountains yay
[3:31:02] and the priest's Chambers pulled down
[3:31:04] cuz they were pretty busy for three
[3:31:05] years fighting the enemy now they get
[3:31:08] around to re re cleaning up things and
[3:31:11] they rent their clothes and made great
[3:31:13] lamentation and cast ashes upon their
[3:31:15] heads and fell down flat on the ground
[3:31:18] upon their faces and blew an alarm with
[3:31:21] the trumpets and cried toward heaven
[3:31:24] then Judah appointed certain men to
[3:31:26] fight against those that were in The
[3:31:27] Fortress until he had cleansed the
[3:31:30] sanctuary still enemies lingering still
[3:31:32] lingering enemies uh you know hovering
[3:31:36] over the
[3:31:38] damage so he chose priest of blameless
[3:31:41] conversation such as had pleasure in the
[3:31:44] law who cleansed the sanctuary and bear
[3:31:47] out the defiled stones into an unclean
[3:31:49] place and when he and when as they
[3:31:53] consulted what to do with the altar of
[3:31:54] burnt offerings which was perined they
[3:31:58] thought it best to pull it down lest it
[3:32:00] should be a reproach to them because the
[3:32:02] Heathen had defiled it wherefore they
[3:32:05] pulled it down and laid up the stones in
[3:32:08] the mountain of the temple in a
[3:32:09] convenient place until there should come
[3:32:12] a prophet to show what should be done
[3:32:14] with them and they took whole Stones
[3:32:18] according to the law and built a new
[3:32:20] altar according to the former and made
[3:32:22] up the sanctuary and the things that
[3:32:24] were within the temple and hollowed the
[3:32:27] hallowed the courts they made also new
[3:32:30] holy vessels and into the temple they
[3:32:32] brought the Candlestick and the altar of
[3:32:34] burnt offerings and of incense and the
[3:32:37] table and upon the altar they burned
[3:32:39] incense and the lamb that were upon the
[3:32:41] candlesticks they lighted and they that
[3:32:44] they might have light in the
[3:32:46] temple furthermore they set the loaves
[3:32:49] upon the table and spread out the veils
[3:32:51] and finished all the works which they
[3:32:53] had began to
[3:32:54] make now on the five and 20th day of the
[3:32:58] ninth month which is called the month
[3:33:01] KES in the 148 year they rose up bed
[3:33:06] times in the morning times and offered
[3:33:09] sacrifice
[3:33:11] according to the law upon the new altar
[3:33:13] of burnt offerings which they had made
[3:33:16] look at what time and what day the
[3:33:18] Heathen had profaned it even in that was
[3:33:21] it dedicated with songs and sits and
[3:33:25] harps and symbols symbols drums then all
[3:33:29] the people fell upon their faces
[3:33:31] worshiping and praising the god of
[3:33:33] Heaven who had given them good success
[3:33:36] and so they kept the dedication of the
[3:33:38] here is what the word word Hanukah means
[3:33:43] dedication read and so they kept the
[3:33:46] dedication of the altar eight days and
[3:33:49] offered burnt offerings with gladness
[3:33:51] and sacrificed a sacrifice of
[3:33:53] Deliverance and
[3:33:54] praise they decked also the Forefront of
[3:33:57] the temple with crowns of gold and with
[3:34:00] shields and the gates and the chambers
[3:34:02] they renewed and hang doors upon them
[3:34:05] thus as was there very great gladness
[3:34:09] among the people for for that the
[3:34:11] reproach of the Heathen was put away
[3:34:14] moreover Judah and his Brethren with the
[3:34:16] whole Congregation of Israel ordained
[3:34:19] that the days of the dedication of the
[3:34:21] altar should be kept in their season
[3:34:24] from year to year by the space of eight
[3:34:26] days from the 5 and 20th day of the
[3:34:29] month of Kes Lev with the my and
[3:34:32] gladness with mirth and
[3:34:36] gladness it was so
[3:34:38] holy to them
[3:34:41] it was so sacred to them to be used by
[3:34:46] God to haul off the bloody Stones right
[3:34:51] get with me a
[3:34:52] moment they didn't even want to clean
[3:34:55] the stone the stones had
[3:34:57] been washed with
[3:35:00] blood and they took the dirty
[3:35:03] Stones off into the
[3:35:05] valley and they brought back the things
[3:35:08] that they could get their hands on to
[3:35:11] reestablish the order in the temple to
[3:35:14] worship God and it was so holy to them
[3:35:17] that they called all the congregation
[3:35:19] together and said we must celebrate
[3:35:21] eight days we will celebrate and Let It
[3:35:24] Be Remembered throughout all generations
[3:35:27] that for eight days we will remember
[3:35:29] this day that the altar of God was
[3:35:36] captured
[3:35:39] cleansed and
[3:35:44] rededicated it's a message to
[3:35:47] us it's a call to us to do the same
[3:35:53] am he doesn't dwell any longer in a
[3:35:56] house made with
[3:36:00] hands he now lives in a house that's
[3:36:03] made up of
[3:36:04] lively Living Stones right how many of
[3:36:08] you one of those houses musicians are
[3:36:10] coming amen I'm one of those who

[3:36:26] altar maybe you've got a little bit of
[3:36:28] the world that's spilled over in your

[3:37:06] load it's what we have to do it's the
[3:37:10] reason why we take time every year to

[3:37:16] make it very very
[3:37:20] personal Lord

[3:39:01] day that we would face the same kind of
[3:39:06] persecution I'd like to think that I
[3:39:08] would not be one
[3:39:11] who would quit honoring Sabbath because
[3:39:14] it was
[3:39:16] outlawed I'd like to think that I would
[3:39:18] not be one that shaved my beard
[3:39:22] because I was
[3:39:25] confronted to fit
[3:39:28] in I'd like to think that I would not be
[3:39:31] one who would stand by and allow the
[3:39:34] Antichrist
[3:39:35] Spirit to offer false
[3:39:39] offerings on the altar of the most high
[3:39:43] God I'd like to thank Lord that I would
[3:39:46] have been
[3:39:47] a one of those
[3:39:50] macbes and yet sometime fear grips my
[3:39:56] heart and courage is far from
[3:40:02] me I don't know for
[3:40:06] sure exactly what I would have done
[3:40:11] Lord strengthen us your
[3:40:15] people we have opportunities now to
[3:40:19] stand for your word for your
[3:40:23] truth to love people but not compromise
[3:40:27] with their
[3:40:29] sin oh
[3:40:34] God help
[3:40:36] us to
[3:40:38] recapture the temple
[3:40:45] lies have tried to inhabit the
[3:40:49] house soldiers have tried to March
[3:40:52] against the
[3:40:56] house the spirit of the world has tried
[3:40:59] to
[3:41:01] influence the
[3:41:05] house may we stand today
[3:41:08] as ser vants of the Lord and Warriors of
[3:41:12] the faith may we refuse to
[3:41:16] swallow the compromise of the
[3:41:20] hour make us passionate for
[3:41:25] truth I'm tired of defending our
[3:41:28] worship I'm tired of Defending gifts of
[3:41:31] the Spirit in this last day I'm tired of
[3:41:36] defending the fact that we still believe
[3:41:38] the Holy Ghost is NE
[3:41:41] necessary to have a
[3:41:44] service help us Lord rather to turn
[3:41:46] inward
[3:41:48] and find the influence of
[3:41:52] Babylon my God may we find the
[3:41:56] influence of the Greek
[3:42:01] mentality may we be stirred like sons of
[3:42:06] Zion passionate for the word
[3:42:10] to take worship more serious to take
[3:42:14] Church attendance more serious to take
[3:42:18] backing the preaching more
[3:42:22] serious to take our prayer life more
[3:42:29] serious we can only cleanse what we
[3:42:33] recapture we can only rededicate what we
[3:42:37] cleanse we need your help
[3:42:41] yes you alone Are

[3:56:49] mccabes while he lingered in the

[3:57:05] right sometimes it takes a Judith
[3:57:07] mccabes

[3:57:31] head you better run you
[3:57:33] devil I'm so thankful for women of God
[3:57:36] and Men of God who are not afraid to
[3:57:38] stand for the word
[3:57:41] and we pray always especially during
[3:57:44] this time for the Jewish people I've
[3:57:48] been admonished and rebuked uh several
[3:57:50] times this week publicly and told that
[3:57:54] we should not pray for their military
[3:57:56] success you you do you I'll do
[3:58:01] me every time Israel didn't obey the
[3:58:03] Lord and let their enemies live they
[3:58:06] have continued to deal with the same
[3:58:09] thing over and over and over and over
[3:58:12] [Music]
[3:58:14] again don't let someone show you a a map
[3:58:18] of what Israel is supposed to look like
[3:58:20] it'll blow your
[3:58:22] mind it'll blow your mind and one of
[3:58:24] these days God will give
[3:58:27] them every
[3:58:30] inch of land that he promised them we
[3:58:33] believe that thank you for your
[3:58:36] attention you know I I can only say uh
[3:58:39] thank you for your attention if we had a
[3:58:42] Sunday night service we could have been
[3:58:44] done hours ago and finished it up
[3:58:46] tonight but we don't but we do have a
[3:58:50] gathering if you didn't know about it
[3:58:52] you're still welcome to attend I feel
[3:58:54] sure there will be plenty of food we're
[3:58:56] going to meet in a little while at
[3:59:00] Philadelphia Baptist Church Fellowship
[3:59:03] Hall behind the church building go
[3:59:06] around to the back door where we were
[3:59:09] where we were last
[3:59:11] Saturday we're going to come together
[3:59:14] tonight
[3:59:15] and if you've got a real problem with
[3:59:18] what we're celebrating well you stay
[3:59:23] home the donuts are for
[3:59:26] me we've never done this before but
[3:59:30] we're my wife with the help of a few
[3:59:32] sisters they're going to after we eat
[3:59:34] our meal they're going to make homemade
[3:59:37] donuts hot on the scene I can't imagine
[3:59:41] the
[3:59:42] task there's 160 Donuts to be cut out in
[3:59:47] fied I can't imagine but you're going to
[3:59:49] get to taste the real
[3:59:51] deal we're going to have a wonderful
[3:59:53] remember it's solemn when we're
[3:59:55] preaching this but but but the
[3:59:57] remembrance of the rededication was to
[3:59:59] be a happy time celebratory
[4:00:02] time and it's just so
[4:00:05] ironic did you see the young man
[4:00:10] who son-in-law I think I may be wrong
[4:00:13] who said to his to his mother-in-law I I
[4:00:17] think maybe the grandmother of his wife
[4:00:20] I I I'm sorry for the detail slipping me
[4:00:22] but she wanted
[4:00:24] something from her home she was
[4:00:28] displaced and she sent him back and he
[4:00:31] did not have the heart to tell her that
[4:00:33] her home that she had built lived in was
[4:00:37] burned and
[4:00:39] destroyed knocked
[4:00:41] over and in the mess he still didn't
[4:00:44] tell her but he refused to go home
[4:00:47] without finding something of hers in the
[4:00:51] rubble and all he could find was dust
[4:00:56] and broken rock and concrete and twisted
[4:01:00] rebar he kept staying and kept lingering
[4:01:02] and kept digging on his hands and knees
[4:01:05] and all he could find was to
[4:01:07] hukum two minoras that are used at
[4:01:10] Hanukkah time one was badly
[4:01:12] twisted and he brought those to her not
[4:01:15] yet telling her everything else was
[4:01:17] destroyed and they lit those
[4:01:21] lamps and when I saw the picture of that
[4:01:24] lamp being lit those candles being lit I
[4:01:27] said this is why I observe this is why
[4:01:31] because the spirit of God's
[4:01:33] people cannot be broken for long we
[4:01:39] because we're grafted in we carry the
[4:01:41] same
[4:01:43] resilience to keep on keeping on the
[4:01:46] devil may knock us down but we get right
[4:01:48] up and keep on keeping on no I'm not
[4:01:51] going to hold you any longer father
[4:01:53] thank you for our time together may we
[4:01:56] long remember what you have spoken to
[4:01:59] us may we long remember what you have
[4:02:02] spoken to us we'll give you praise and
[4:02:06] honor and Glory for it's in the name of
[4:02:09] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[4:02:11] Saints said amen where's my wife I saw
[4:02:14] her a minute ago she's oh you're running
[4:02:16] the sound
[4:02:20] now it is uh 3:00 2 minutes till
[4:02:26] 3
[4:02:30] 5:30 they want to do they want to just
[4:02:32] make the tables nice but uh I'm going to
[4:02:37] have to have a turkey sandwich before
[4:02:39] night time before we get over there but
[4:02:41] about
[4:02:42] 5:30 if you happen to be there a little
[4:02:44] early you could probably jump in and
[4:02:46] help but could we plan to eat at
[4:02:49] 5:30 I know that's odd the way we're
[4:02:51] doing it but that's because the food is
[4:02:54] is going to be hot that way and if you
[4:02:57] want to stick around in Fellowship then
[4:02:59] you know in the vestibule or whatever
[4:03:01] I'm sure there'll be somebody with a
[4:03:03] that can help close up or stop back by
[4:03:05] or do something to make sure we get
[4:03:06] closed up let's come
[4:03:08] tonight uh let's light the hanuk and
[4:03:11] let's uh let's remember the grace of
[4:03:15] God over a little family that said we
[4:03:18] won't just watch the enemy take
[4:03:19] everything that belongs to us and really
[4:03:22] I see a lot of mcabees here today I do
[4:03:25] thank God for you God bless you you're
[4:03:27] dismissed to go in the name of the Lord
[4:03:29] if we could go home and not do a lot of
[4:03:31] fellowshipping now we could have three
[4:03:34] or four hours to Fellowship together
[4:03:36] this evening uh at the fellowship hall
[4:03:40] don't run out on us and not help clean
[4:03:42] if we're going to do a community thing
[4:03:44] it takes the whole Community to make it
[4:03:46] special make it work we'll see you at
