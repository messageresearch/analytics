[0:00] God has a plan
[0:03] he has a destiny he has a purpose for
[0:08] your life
[0:16] among the gods there's one God who is
[0:20] Alive forevermore and I want to remind
[0:23] you that Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[0:27] Jesus of the New Testament
[0:29] that they're not two gods they're
[0:32] certainly not three Gods hero Israel the
[0:36] Lord thy God is one
[0:40] the Bible said there are three that bear
[0:43] record in heaven the Father the word and
[0:45] the spirit and these three are one
[0:50] and so it seems that while the church
[0:53] emphasizes that God is three the word is
[0:57] emphasizing that God is one
[1:00] got a choice will you stick with your
[1:03] church or will you stick with the word
[1:06] I don't know about you but I'm going to
[1:09] take my stand with the word of God he's
[1:11] one
[1:12] and he's able to do whatever we need him
[1:16] to do tonight he is Jesus Christ the
[1:19] same yesterday and today and forever he
[1:24] changes not
[1:26] if he ever delivered an addict yes still
[1:29] a deliverer
[1:30] if he ever heal the sick
[1:33] still a Healer so among all of those
[1:36] things those idols
[1:38] those you know fables that men may call
[1:43] gods
[1:44] there is only one true Living God God
[1:49] has a plan
[1:51] he has a destiny he has a purpose for
[1:56] your life
[1:58] and if you're wasting your life now you
[2:01] need to awaken yourself and you need to
[2:04] recognize you weren't born here to be
[2:07] who you think you ought to be
[2:10] you were born here to be who God created
[2:13] you to be which is above and beyond
[2:16] anything that you could ever think about
[2:18] yourself
[2:20] what God has called you for what God has
[2:24] chosen you for what God wants to do
[2:26] through you in this end time is bigger
[2:29] than anything we could imagine
[2:31] you say well I'm just a housewife how
[2:34] could God use me let me tell you
[2:35] something he knows how to use anybody
[2:39] that will yield themselves to him you
[2:42] know God has a way of protecting our
[2:44] destiny he has a way of watching over us
[2:47] when we don't even know we're being
[2:49] watched over
[2:50] I want you to know he was sitting with
[2:52] you on that bar stool
[2:54] I want you to know some of you he went
[2:56] with to the crack house with you
[2:59] I want you to know there are people that
[3:02] lay on the abortion table and Jesus was
[3:05] there with them
[3:07] somebody said I can't even imagine such
[3:09] a thing as that you just don't know how
[3:11] jealous over you he is
[3:14] he watched over you he wooed you he
[3:17] followed you he protected you even in
[3:21] sin
[3:22] that's my God somebody said how could he
[3:25] do that because he knew who you were
[3:29] he knew your purpose and your destiny he
[3:33] knew that you were his
[3:36] before the foundation of the world the
[3:40] scripture said you have not chosen me I
[3:42] have chosen you saith the Lord
