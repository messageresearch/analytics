[19:29] let's give the Lord a shout of praise
[19:35] yes
[19:54] [Music]
[20:04] all right
[20:08] I think most of you
[20:10] just a minute
[20:12] I think most of you know that I don't
[20:15] have a lot of patience for being late to
[20:17] church
[20:19] I just really don't
[20:21] I've been going to church all my life
[20:24] and I've always found a way to be there
[20:25] on time
[20:27] somebody help me
[20:29] but I knew this morning
[20:32] at
[20:33] 222-2 22 minutes after two
[20:37] and then again at 55 minutes after five
[20:40] that's five five five that somebody was
[20:44] going to face a battle to get here this
[20:46] morning
[20:47] and when I see you dwindling in
[20:50] I realize that some of you not all of
[20:52] you some of you are consistently late
[20:55] you're going to be late for your funeral
[20:57] I hope so
[21:01] but I know there's a Warfare somebody
[21:03] has fought some stuff
[21:05] and uh when we were looking in the
[21:07] Monitor and sister Sharon was in jail or
[21:10] going after it before the service
[21:12] started somebody said they're on the war
[21:14] path that's exactly right
[21:16] that's exactly right the enemy doesn't
[21:19] want you to get anything out of this
[21:21] service today
[21:22] but you can determine what you take with
[21:25] you
[21:26] come on now
[21:28] I want to tell you a couple of things
[21:29] one is the wording of that song's a
[21:31] little strange to me
[21:33] because it's not talking about the city
[21:35] of God
[21:37] when it says going up to the high places
[21:39] it means going up to the land that's
[21:41] dedicated to the devil
[21:44] so if you're going to go into the
[21:46] devil's territory and take back what
[21:48] belongs to you you better be prayed up
[21:52] you better be prayed up you better have
[21:56] the right attitude in the right Spirit
[21:58] brother Branham told us it's better to
[22:00] have the wrong Doctrine and a right
[22:02] spirit
[22:03] than to have the right Doctrine and a
[22:05] wrong spirit
[22:06] so you better know that you've got
[22:08] everything under the blood if you're
[22:10] going to go to the devil's house
[22:12] and take back what belongs to you now
[22:15] that's not to strike fear in your heart
[22:17] because you ought to be able to go
[22:19] you we're going some of you are going
[22:22] just a minute ago but we ought to know
[22:24] who we are
[22:27] I was streaming the service last night
[22:30] from from the dedication Services of
[22:33] Happy Valley
[22:34] uh no longer called Happy Valley but uh
[22:37] you know where I mean and brother Ron
[22:40] we called him ronaldinh when he was
[22:43] growing up but his name now is Ron
[22:46] Spencer and and he's been fighting
[22:49] cancer now for several years and he just
[22:52] stopped writing his message he said do I
[22:54] look like somebody that's dying with
[22:56] cancer do I preach like somebody that's
[22:58] dying with cancer do I praise like
[23:01] somebody that's dying with cancer
[23:04] and he said this and I've heard him say
[23:06] it before and I'm gonna I'm Gonna Leave
[23:07] This with you because we're going right
[23:09] back to where we were just a second ago
[23:11] but he said I am not here to to argue
[23:15] with you about whether Muhammad Ali was
[23:17] the greatest fighter of all times
[23:20] but he said I will tell you something
[23:21] his trainer said
[23:23] his trainer said it is not my job to
[23:27] teach you how to fight
[23:30] he's looking at Muhammad Ali it is not
[23:34] my job it is not my responsibility to
[23:37] teach you how to fight
[23:38] you already know
[23:40] it's my responsibility to remind you who
[23:43] you are
[23:47] the greatest of all time
[23:50] it's my job to remind you that you're
[23:53] the one who floats like a butterfly and
[23:55] stings like a bee
[23:57] come on now
[23:58] and so it's it's not our job this
[24:00] morning to teach you how to fight you've
[24:02] been fighting a long time you know how
[24:05] to fight the enemy you know how to come
[24:07] against him using the word but we want
[24:09] to remind you this morning of Who You
[24:11] Are
[24:12] and more importantly than that whose you
[24:15] are and nothing can stand before you
[24:19] if you're coming in the name of the Lord
[24:22] Jesus Christ to defeat the enemy nothing
[24:25] can stand before you if you approach the
[24:28] high places with fear you will be
[24:31] defeated momentarily
[24:33] and your Victory flag will be broken
[24:35] handed back to you and you'll be sent
[24:37] back where you come from but if you know
[24:39] who you are and you know whose you are
[24:42] and you want to go today and take back
[24:45] something that belongs to you you can do
[24:47] it if you will

[24:53] you'll join with us we're going to sing

[24:58] enemy has stolen from your life
[25:00] sometimes it's your inheritance it's
[25:03] your heritage it can go either way but
[25:06] if you know the enemy has stolen
[25:08] something and you'd like to get it back
[25:09] today then here's the way to do it you
[25:12] dare dare go to the high places
[25:15] go with the blood of Jesus
[25:17] go with the word of God in your mouth go
[25:20] with the name of Jesus over your heart
[25:22] and you tell that enemy that he is the
[25:24] original kleptomaniac and that he has to
[25:27] give you back what belongs to you and
[25:30] not only does he have to give it back to
[25:31] you what he's stolen but he has to give
[25:33] it back with seven times on top of that
[25:35] because the thief is caught oh

[1:17:24] over their birthday do you

[1:17:29] week on Wednesday the 5th and uh God
[1:17:32] really blessed them he did it's an
[1:17:34] unbelievable uh the turn of events is

[1:17:41] a really an unbelievable
[1:17:43] 10-year anniversary vacation is that
[1:17:46] right was it 10 years
[1:17:48] and most people get that at about 35 or
[1:17:51] 40 a trip to Hawaii but I'm glad very
[1:17:54] very glad that they get to enjoy the
[1:17:57] beauty there and it's also one of our
[1:17:59] very faithful streamers birthdays on
[1:18:01] Wednesday the 5th Brother David Gossman
[1:18:04] so we send our love and greetings and
[1:18:07] happy birthday to you and Sister nakisha
[1:18:10] We're depending on you to take our love
[1:18:12] and birthday greetings home to your mom
[1:18:14] on Friday sister Audrey Lewis has a
[1:18:17] birthday so she's probably streaming But
[1:18:19] be sure to to let her know that we
[1:18:21] thought about her there will be no
[1:18:23] service here Tuesday night you're free
[1:18:26] to spend that time with your family we
[1:18:28] don't have anything planned here at the
[1:18:30] church uh on Tuesday but you you spend
[1:18:34] some time with your family and if you if
[1:18:38] you will take some time to thank God
[1:18:41] it's a broken Nation
[1:18:44] but it's the best Nation to live in
[1:18:48] with all of her faults and flaws and
[1:18:50] pimples and and and all the things wrong
[1:18:53] with her crooked nose and whatever else
[1:18:55] we're so thankful for the freedom that
[1:18:57] we have in America and it's because
[1:19:00] people fought and gave their lives and
[1:19:04] you know it's hard to believe where we
[1:19:06] are now when we think about the fact
[1:19:08] that the reason why we have a nation is
[1:19:10] because some people wanted freedom to
[1:19:13] worship God according to the dictates of
[1:19:15] their heart so you and I should take
[1:19:17] advantage of that blessing and of living
[1:19:20] in such a free place and uh and and
[1:19:24] enjoy and celebrate and be safe and we
[1:19:27] don't normally do that but I felt to do
[1:19:29] that this year and we will be back next
[1:19:32] Sunday if you are hungry for the word
[1:19:35] just go over to your sweet little phone
[1:19:37] and open the nhrm app and there are
[1:19:41] hundreds of hours
[1:19:44] hundreds of hours of sermons there all
[1:19:47] you have to do is is pick your pick your
[1:19:51] pick take your pick the sermon for the
[1:19:54] week uh coming out of Jeff for this week
[1:19:57] is the greatest battle ever fought and
[1:20:01] if you've never heard that sermon I
[1:20:04] strongly encourage you to hear it
[1:20:06] because that's where we are right now
[1:20:07] the greatest battle that's ever been
[1:20:10] fought is not Democrats and Republicans
[1:20:12] and
[1:20:13] Libertarians and uh and independents and
[1:20:17] all this kind of stuff it's not Putin
[1:20:20] and and his Antics it's it's if it's up
[1:20:23] here
[1:20:24] it's the battle of the mind and we win
[1:20:29] as the bride of Christ we win
[1:20:32] and so we want to uh to uh certainly
[1:20:37] take advantage of of what God is stored
[1:20:39] up for us would you continue to remember
[1:20:42] the Green family at the loss of Sister
[1:20:45] Green it made it all fresh again for us
[1:20:48] this week when uh July 1st comes it's
[1:20:52] Canada day so happy Canada Day to all of
[1:20:55] the Saints who are streaming in Canada
[1:20:57] but every July the first for a long time
[1:21:01] now I wake up and the first thing I
[1:21:03] think about is brother Perry green who
[1:21:06] was born in 1933 on July the 1st and
[1:21:10] brother Branham said to him one time he
[1:21:12] said now brother Perry that one in your
[1:21:15] name means that's July 1st that one in
[1:21:19] your name means that you are good at
[1:21:21] starting things
[1:21:23] and truly he passed away just short of
[1:21:28] his 50th year in the church that he
[1:21:32] started in Tucson and brother Branham
[1:21:35] was a happy man when brother green
[1:21:37] accepted the call of the Lord to leave
[1:21:39] Beaumont Texas he was a Borden milk man
[1:21:43] he owned a fleet of Borden milk trucks
[1:21:47] every time I see the cow anybody know
[1:21:50] Borden
[1:21:51] if you've if you've never drank board
[1:21:54] and chocolate milk you've never tasted
[1:21:55] chocolate milk
[1:21:57] and I think they've quit selling it
[1:21:59] around here someone told me around here
[1:22:02] you found some see brother Daniel after
[1:22:06] church he'll point you to the cow
[1:22:10] sometimes we're going down the road and
[1:22:12] we I we used to snap pictures of board
[1:22:15] and milk trucks and send them to Sister
[1:22:17] Green they mentioned at her funeral that
[1:22:20] when the call of the Lord came to
[1:22:23] Beaumont Texas to come to Tucson that
[1:22:26] they came in an old truck pulling an old
[1:22:29] trailer uh an old milk truck and a cow
[1:22:34] and I think a horse too and uh sister
[1:22:38] green said we look like The Beverly
[1:22:40] Hillbillies coming out of Texas I said
[1:22:43] was you sitting in a rocking chair and
[1:22:45] crocheting I was not
[1:22:49] but anyway we give God thanks for their
[1:22:52] life and for their Ministry and uh last
[1:22:55] Sunday just after her funeral the Tucson
[1:22:59] Tabernacle voted for the first time in
[1:23:01] seven years to have a pastor but they
[1:23:06] thought they would put him on a one-year
[1:23:08] trial basis and uh some of you met Young
[1:23:12] Daniel Evans and uh his dad uh brother
[1:23:16] Dan Evans who worked for so many years
[1:23:19] as Brother Joseph branham's right-hand
[1:23:21] man that the voice of God he was elected
[1:23:24] as the pastor of the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:23:27] and uh we're just happy that they have
[1:23:29] somebody that they can depend on in
[1:23:32] times like this I didn't mention Tuesday
[1:23:35] night but many of you were greeted by
[1:23:38] Saints in Tucson that know you so many
[1:23:41] said tell this one and tell that one and
[1:23:43] tell the other and time wouldn't allow
[1:23:46] us to do that but I I I've got some
[1:23:49] things I need to share there let's go
[1:23:51] ahead and thank God for the musicians uh
[1:23:53] we're just so appreciative
[1:23:57] we're so thankful
[1:23:59] [Applause]
[1:24:03] my wife and I are going to have a few
[1:24:05] days this week as empty nesters and uh I
[1:24:08] love my wife and I love spending time
[1:24:10] with her we had a wonderful time in
[1:24:12] Tucson but anybody that knows me knows I
[1:24:15] do not feel complete or at total peace
[1:24:19] when my kids are away so I don't mind to
[1:24:22] ask you again to pray for them that God
[1:24:24] will watch over them and keep them
[1:24:25] Benjamin and Jenna were due to be home
[1:24:28] tomorrow but they have extended until
[1:24:30] Thursday so that all of Jenna's family
[1:24:33] could be together and you know I can't I
[1:24:37] can't begrudge that because God gave us
[1:24:40] uh Jenna and they live in our yard
[1:24:45] so I can't really complain if they go
[1:24:48] home and and uh her precious grandfather
[1:24:52] brother asyler brother Gilbert
[1:24:55] jalbert brother jelbert sailor will turn
[1:24:59] 90 uh just around the corner and they're
[1:25:02] planning a get-together for him can you
[1:25:04] imagine
[1:25:06] 90 years
[1:25:08] and uh and strong and still still
[1:25:11] preaching the gospel and witnessing to
[1:25:14] to whoever will listen
[1:25:17] um I I
[1:25:22] I want to share this with you
[1:25:25] I think I'll do it before I read the
[1:25:27] scripture
[1:25:28] we are entering uh I mentioned Warfare
[1:25:31] this morning I mentioned the battle to
[1:25:33] get here for some of you I I mentioned
[1:25:36] uh praying particularly in times and
[1:25:40] seasons of spiritual transition and War
[1:25:42] and I know that there are still those
[1:25:45] that uh don't understand those kinds of
[1:25:48] things and I always feel bad for those
[1:25:51] who maybe don't understand
[1:25:53] but we have learned as a congregation
[1:25:56] now we've been together over 30 years
[1:25:58] and we have learned that these things
[1:26:02] matter
[1:26:03] and uh we've got to be be on our
[1:26:06] spiritual toes when we're called to pray
[1:26:10] we're entering this week a season of
[1:26:13] time that we have been watching now for
[1:26:16] for over 20 years
[1:26:19] um the Jewish people have been watching
[1:26:22] this period of time since uh about 19 I
[1:26:27] think it would have been I think it
[1:26:29] would have been the year 61. uh
[1:26:33] A.D the Jewish people call it CE Common
[1:26:38] Era so it goes all the way back to the
[1:26:41] year of 61 of the Common Era that there
[1:26:47] has been a unprecedented amount of
[1:26:51] trouble during a three-week period every
[1:26:55] year
[1:26:57] it is called many things it's called the
[1:27:01] three weeks
[1:27:02] it's called the Dire Straits
[1:27:06] it is also referred to as the season of
[1:27:10] the Basilisk
[1:27:12] the Basilisk was known in ancient
[1:27:16] mythologies
[1:27:18] and uh in ancient writings as the king
[1:27:23] of serpents
[1:27:24] and the Jewish people Mark the season of
[1:27:28] the Basilisk every year
[1:27:31] uh and they do it according to their
[1:27:34] calendar which is it begins on the 17th
[1:27:37] of the Hebrew month tamus and ends on
[1:27:41] the ninth of of
[1:27:44] and some of you might know that the
[1:27:47] temple was destroyed not once but twice
[1:27:50] on the ninth of of so there is a season
[1:27:54] of mourning that takes place uh during
[1:27:58] those three weeks it's crazy if you look
[1:28:02] at history it's crazy the amount of
[1:28:06] things that have taken place against
[1:28:09] Israel against the Jewish people during
[1:28:12] that three-week period because God has
[1:28:16] called us to be in alignment with Israel
[1:28:19] spiritually we have also experienced
[1:28:23] some pretty uh
[1:28:25] ugly stuff during that three-week period
[1:28:28] so we don't dread it in fear we prepare
[1:28:33] in the spirit hello
[1:28:36] I I don't know if you're listening or
[1:28:38] not we prepare in the spirit because we
[1:28:42] never know what the enemy uh would would
[1:28:45] plot Israel is in a particularly uh
[1:28:51] provocative season and she is being
[1:28:55] threatened as always but there has been
[1:28:58] a uh a shaking in the Serpent's tail so
[1:29:02] to speak uh recently with major threats
[1:29:07] against the nation of Israel so we want
[1:29:10] to pray for Israel we want to pray for
[1:29:15] the Jewish people and we want to pray
[1:29:17] for the bride of Christ for families
[1:29:21] because families are particularly
[1:29:23] attacked during this period of time for
[1:29:27] those of you who are note takers it
[1:29:30] begins this Thursday July the 6th and
[1:29:35] that is the 17th of tammuz on the Hebrew
[1:29:39] calendar and it goes from July the 6th
[1:29:43] to July the 27th which is a Thursday
[1:29:46] Thursday to Thursday and that that July
[1:29:51] the 27th is the ninth of of just let me
[1:29:56] give you this real quick uh on the 9th
[1:30:00] of well on the 17th of tammuz the day
[1:30:03] that the Dire Straits are the season of
[1:30:06] the Basilisk begins Moses it's recorded
[1:30:10] in the oral law that Moses smashed the
[1:30:14] tablets of the Torah uh at Mount Sinai
[1:30:18] not a very smart move if you know what I
[1:30:20] mean it was the day that daily
[1:30:22] sacrifices ceased we lead we read in
[1:30:27] history that apostomus burned a Torah
[1:30:31] scroll from the temple on the 17th of
[1:30:34] tammuz and Idol was erected in the
[1:30:37] temple that we read about in the Old
[1:30:39] Testament and it was the day that the
[1:30:42] Romans breached the city wall and that
[1:30:45] breaching of the walls of Jerusalem
[1:30:48] eventually led to the destruction of the
[1:30:51] temple and the destruction of the city
[1:30:53] how many of you remember that
[1:30:55] all right
[1:30:56] are you with me
[1:30:59] I'm going to preach in a moment then
[1:31:02] when we look at the ninth of of which
[1:31:05] would be uh
[1:31:07] corresponding with the 27th of July it
[1:31:11] starts in 1200 BC and it goes all the
[1:31:15] way up to modern history in 586 BC the
[1:31:18] Babylonian Army destroyed the Holy
[1:31:20] Temple in 70 A.D on the very same day
[1:31:24] Titus and the Roman army destroyed the
[1:31:28] temple in 1096 on the very same day the
[1:31:32] first Crusades began and when we say
[1:31:35] Crusades we don't mean Billy Graham
[1:31:37] salvation meetings we mean the
[1:31:39] crucifixion of the Jews the Crusaders
[1:31:42] marched into to Jerusalem and crucified
[1:31:46] Jewish people on Stakes leading all the
[1:31:48] way up to the Holy Hill of God in 1290
[1:31:53] on the same day the Jews were expelled
[1:31:56] from England on 1306 the same day the
[1:32:00] Jews were expelled from France
[1:32:03] 1492 on the same day King Ferdinand and
[1:32:07] Queen Isabella signed the expulsion that
[1:32:10] would rid Spain of all the Jews in 1914
[1:32:15] it was the Declaration of World War One
[1:32:18] took place on the ninth of off and on in
[1:32:23] 1942 on the ninth of of plans were
[1:32:27] signed that would call for the
[1:32:29] annihilation of Jews during World World
[1:32:32] War II and it goes on and on and on and
[1:32:36] on so let us be aware that we're
[1:32:40] entering a season where the enemy likes
[1:32:43] to shake his tail that O King of the
[1:32:47] serpents he likes to show himself but I
[1:32:51] want you to know there's a bride in this
[1:32:53] land who has authority over the enemy if
[1:32:57] you believe that same man
[1:32:59] I want to only say one more thing
[1:33:02] concerning this season and that is share
[1:33:05] with you two paragraphs of a dream that
[1:33:09] God gave me July the 19th of 2008.
[1:33:13] I had a dream and it was the first time
[1:33:16] that I ever saw this creature that has
[1:33:21] come to symbolize the three weeks or the
[1:33:25] weeks of dire strait the Basilisk he was
[1:33:29] slowly moving about as though stalking
[1:33:32] prey I then realized that he was moving
[1:33:36] toward a small wooden building and from
[1:33:39] the noise I heard coming from inside I
[1:33:43] realized that the building was sort of a
[1:33:46] chicken coop I then knew that the basket
[1:33:49] basilisk was going to steal the eggs and
[1:33:54] I saw that he would specifically suck
[1:33:58] the egg out of the shell I knew that I
[1:34:03] could sneak up on it from behind and
[1:34:06] perhaps deal a fatal blow I asked if
[1:34:10] this was what I should do but I was told
[1:34:14] by the spirit that I should not kill it
[1:34:17] because he listen now because he the
[1:34:21] Basilisk had not yet accomplished all
[1:34:25] that he was designed to accomplish but
[1:34:29] that I should drive the Basilisk away
[1:34:32] from the chicken coop so that he could
[1:34:35] not destroy the eggs does that make
[1:34:38] sense to anyone we have authority over
[1:34:40] him
[1:34:41] and every other demonic creature
[1:34:44] we have authority over the spirit of
[1:34:47] Sorrow we have authority over the
[1:34:49] Basilisk we have authority over every
[1:34:52] every Serpent and snake spiritually that
[1:34:55] likes to harass the bride of Christ I
[1:34:59] wish you were with me
[1:35:01] but I was said I was told don't kill it
[1:35:04] it hadn't yet finished what it was
[1:35:07] created for
[1:35:09] and we we get that don't we
[1:35:11] we get that because it took both Fishers
[1:35:15] and Hunters to drive Israel
[1:35:18] back as a nation to put the Jewish
[1:35:20] people back in the Homeland and we know
[1:35:23] that the the enemy is just a tool in the
[1:35:27] hand of God to perfect the Saints so
[1:35:29] sometimes we come against the tool when
[1:35:32] we ought to be praying that God protect
[1:35:34] us
[1:35:35] and help us have Grace to get through
[1:35:37] the trial or the Striking so uh I I
[1:35:42] should not drive him away from the
[1:35:44] chicken coop so that he could not
[1:35:45] destroy I should I should drive him away
[1:35:47] so that he could not destroy the eggs it
[1:35:50] is said that the mortal enemy of the
[1:35:53] Basilisk is a rooster
[1:35:56] God make me a rooster
[1:36:01] there's your Watchman God make you a
[1:36:04] rooster
[1:36:05] we need spiritual Watchmen Among Us who
[1:36:08] get the burden of the Lord is that right
[1:36:11] to help us know how to pray and when to
[1:36:14] pray
[1:36:15] I I get I get uh I I I I I I really get
[1:36:21] agitated sometime when I read the
[1:36:24] headlines that some Christians create
[1:36:30] you know it's amazing to me that two
[1:36:33] people can look at the same event or the
[1:36:36] same situation and report it so
[1:36:39] differently
[1:36:41] so I would say there is a fake news even
[1:36:44] in the church
[1:36:48] we need we need spiritual alertness we
[1:36:52] need some cock-a-doodle-doos
[1:36:56] I mean Among Us not just a preacher we
[1:36:59] need some cock-a-doodle-doo so say hey
[1:37:02] wake up cock-a-doodle-doo the Basilisk
[1:37:05] is trying to get in here and steal the
[1:37:07] egg
[1:37:09] and so I I've read I read that the
[1:37:13] roosters the mortal enemy thus
[1:37:14] explaining why he was stalking at night
[1:37:17] he didn't want to disturb the rooster
[1:37:20] and why he might be trying to eat the
[1:37:23] eggs now listen
[1:37:25] it's strategic
[1:37:27] if he eats the egg
[1:37:30] some of those this is what I was told in
[1:37:31] the dream some of those eggs are
[1:37:34] roosters
[1:37:37] some of them are chickens is this too
[1:37:39] much for you
[1:37:41] some of them I wonder I'm looking back
[1:37:43] I'm so glad that Brother David Shirley
[1:37:45] is here again today we've talked about
[1:37:47] him at my house almost all week and he
[1:37:50] didn't even know it and it was all good
[1:37:52] all good
[1:37:54] and and I said you think he'll start
[1:37:56] coming and Joshua said I don't know I
[1:37:58] think he might
[1:38:00] well we're very happy you're here again
[1:38:01] today and if everybody smiled as much as
[1:38:04] you do we'd have a happier Church
[1:38:07] I can tell you that right now for old
[1:38:10] friend of Nathan's and and also of
[1:38:13] brother Matt uh drost but anyway I can
[1:38:16] imagine what someone knew here is
[1:38:19] thinking about the preacher talking
[1:38:20] about basilisks and roosters and sucking
[1:38:23] eggs
[1:38:25] well if you don't get anything out of it
[1:38:27] get this you've never been to a church
[1:38:29] like this one
[1:38:33] good bad or ugly
[1:38:36] we're unique
[1:38:38] so I was shown in the dream that that
[1:38:41] that that basilisk was sneaking in at
[1:38:44] night and he was going to to suck out
[1:38:47] the life of the egg because he would be
[1:38:50] taking out some of his future threats
[1:38:53] Now isn't that just like the enemy he
[1:38:55] wanted to silence the roosters
[1:38:59] so I would say to you that during the
[1:39:02] season of the Basilisk this year watch
[1:39:05] and pray Watch and Pray make sure that
[1:39:11] nothing is able to come and steal your
[1:39:14] future victory
[1:39:15] everything comes to our lives in
[1:39:18] embryonic form
[1:39:20] everything God does in our family he
[1:39:23] starts doing it in embryonic form if the
[1:39:26] enemy can come in hear me
[1:39:28] if the enemy can come in and Destroy
[1:39:31] something before it comes to the birth
[1:39:34] then it's lost and if he can take out
[1:39:37] some of the roosters before they ever
[1:39:39] rise up to to sound the alarm then he
[1:39:43] has gained a victory in the stealth of
[1:39:45] the night but we say in the name of
[1:39:47] Jesus that our King is the victor
[1:39:51] and he's not King of serpents he's king
[1:39:54] of kings and Lord of the Lords and we
[1:39:58] decree that every devil every demon
[1:40:01] power must bow to the authority of the
[1:40:05] Lord Jesus Christ and we say the bride
[1:40:08] will thrive in this season of Dire
[1:40:11] Straits she will recognize who she is
[1:40:14] and get on the wall and sound the alarm
[1:40:18] in prayer we decree that in the holy
[1:40:21] name of our Lord let's stand
[1:40:25] yes Whoever thought in a church where we
[1:40:28] talk about eagles we would scream
[1:40:30] roosters arise
[1:40:33] Hallelujah
[1:40:35] oh oh my
[1:40:37] I can just see I can just see the Spurs
[1:40:46] just ready to take out the enemy come on
[1:40:49] whoa whoa
[1:40:53] Glory

[1:42:17] Joshua thank you so much you don't know
[1:42:19] what's going on this morning do you
[1:42:22] Joshua chapter 24 beginning in verse one
[1:42:26] and two I'm going to read a few and then
[1:42:29] I'm going to ask others to help and
[1:42:31] Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel
[1:42:36] to shechem and called for the Elders of
[1:42:40] Israel and for their heads and for their
[1:42:43] judges and for their officers and they
[1:42:47] presented themselves before God are you
[1:42:50] with me
[1:42:51] and Joshua said unto all the people thus
[1:42:55] saith the Lord God of Israel your
[1:42:58] fathers dwelt on the other side of the
[1:43:01] flood in all time even Kara or Torah the
[1:43:06] father of Abraham and the father of
[1:43:09] nehor and they served other gods
[1:43:15] interesting they served other gods now
[1:43:20] drop down in Joshua chapter 24 to verse
[1:43:24] 13 and I'm going to read uh several more
[1:43:29] verses if you need to be seated you can
[1:43:33] and I have given you a land for which ye
[1:43:38] did not labor and cities which ye built
[1:43:42] not and you dwell in them of The
[1:43:45] Vineyards and Olive yards which you
[1:43:48] planted not do ye eat now therefore fear
[1:43:54] the lord hello
[1:43:57] and serve him in what sincerity and in
[1:44:02] truth and listen put away
[1:44:05] I want to emphasize that
[1:44:08] put away the gods which your father
[1:44:11] served on the other side of the flood
[1:44:14] you're you're on the other side of the
[1:44:18] flood now
[1:44:19] and you've got to live like somebody
[1:44:21] that survived
[1:44:24] and in Egypt and do what
[1:44:27] serve ye the Lord
[1:44:30] and if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[1:44:33] the Lord
[1:44:34] choose you this day whom ye will serve
[1:44:43] isn't that good
[1:44:45] choose today whom you are going to serve
[1:44:49] whether the gods which your fathers
[1:44:51] serve that were on the other side of the
[1:44:54] flood are the gods of the amorites in
[1:44:57] whose land you dwell but as for me I
[1:45:00] can't answer for you
[1:45:02] hello I can't answer for your Bunch but
[1:45:06] for my bunch I'm gonna Hallelujah I'm
[1:45:09] going to answer for mine today for me
[1:45:12] and my house we will serve the Lord
[1:45:17] Hallelujah not half-heartedly not
[1:45:20] haphazardly not with compromise but with
[1:45:25] fervency and with dedication I want
[1:45:29] every husband every father in this house
[1:45:32] to read this with me but as for me and
[1:45:36] my house we will serve the Lord

[1:45:45] house we will serve what about you mamas
[1:45:49] let's do it but as for me
[1:45:54] amen
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:03] I had it in my notes here but I took
[1:46:05] time on the Basilisk but I had in my
[1:46:08] notes to open this sermon by
[1:46:11] re-emphasizing to you the importance and
[1:46:14] the power of the amen
[1:46:19] you know Sister Hattie right
[1:46:21] she learned the importance
[1:46:26] of the amen
[1:46:28] hers didn't sound like yours she said
[1:46:31] that ain't nothing but the truth brother
[1:46:33] Branham
[1:46:35] Hallelujah I don't care if you say that
[1:46:37] ain't nothing but the truth it may not
[1:46:40] be good English but it worked for Hattie
[1:46:42] right
[1:46:44] we cannot underestimate the power and
[1:46:48] the authority that comes when you
[1:46:51] sincerely say Amen to God's word
[1:46:56] it locks something you may be seated
[1:46:59] it locks something
[1:47:02] I heard brother Ronald Dean again I
[1:47:04] mentioned him already brother Ron
[1:47:06] Spencer preaching last night
[1:47:09] and I heard him retelling the story of
[1:47:13] the little blind girl that got a hold of
[1:47:16] brother Branham
[1:47:20] she got a hold of his tie
[1:47:23] she got a hold of the lapel
[1:47:26] and she began to tell what's going on
[1:47:29] with you and uh he's standing out and
[1:47:32] she said my my dad I heard this morning
[1:47:35] on the radio that the Healer was holding
[1:47:39] meetings here
[1:47:41] and I came to see the Healer
[1:47:45] and I've gotten separated from my daddy
[1:47:48] how many of you remember the story my
[1:47:51] daddy was here to help me try to get in
[1:47:53] to see if the Healer would pray for me
[1:47:55] but I've gotten separated from my daddy
[1:47:58] and I can't find him could you just help
[1:48:00] me find my daddy
[1:48:03] because I know my daddy will help me get
[1:48:06] to the Healer
[1:48:08] whoa and brother random said you really
[1:48:11] believe in that healing stuff
[1:48:13] she doesn't even know who she's holding
[1:48:15] on to
[1:48:18] she doesn't even know what she's got a
[1:48:20] hold of
[1:48:22] Hallelujah you really believe about
[1:48:24] healing stuff and she said sir I've
[1:48:27] tried everything else
[1:48:29] the doctors well he said well what about
[1:48:31] the doctor he said to the little girl
[1:48:33] they're fine doctors in the land now
[1:48:36] can't they have oh yes sir she said I've
[1:48:40] tried them and they can't do nothing for
[1:48:42] me
[1:48:44] hope I have is if a Healer will pray for
[1:48:47] me
[1:48:50] and brother Brian I'm just talking to
[1:48:52] her now not even telling her she has no
[1:48:54] idea she's got old finally finally she
[1:48:57] keeps saying to him if you'll just
[1:48:59] please sir help me find my daddy
[1:49:03] I gotta find my daddy because my daddy
[1:49:06] said he would do everything within his
[1:49:09] power to help me get through the Healer
[1:49:11] and brother random just looks down at
[1:49:13] the little girl he says I believe I'm
[1:49:15] the one you're looking for
[1:49:17] but I'm not the Healer
[1:49:21] come on I'm just here to cooperate with
[1:49:23] him
[1:49:24] I believe I believe I believe I'm the
[1:49:27] one you're looking for and God healed
[1:49:29] that little girl come on now he healed
[1:49:32] her because she got a hold of the Healer
[1:49:37] she wasn't gonna let him lose he tried
[1:49:39] to discourage her and she wouldn't turn
[1:49:41] loose of his clothes
[1:49:43] he realized if I leave her I'm gonna
[1:49:45] have to be taking her with me
[1:49:47] because she wouldn't turn Luke you ought
[1:49:50] to be just like that
[1:49:52] you ought to remember who you are today
[1:49:55] and you ought to get a hold of the
[1:49:57] Healer
[1:49:58] you ought to hear that song sung it's
[1:50:01] already done and your spirit ought to
[1:50:04] say Amen it's not just the amen that
[1:50:07] comes out of your mouth it's the one
[1:50:09] that comes out of the depths of your
[1:50:11] spirit that God is looking for Soviet
[1:50:14] [Applause]
[1:50:20] as for me and my
[1:50:24] we will serve the Lord
[1:50:29] whoa
[1:50:30] and the people answered and said God
[1:50:33] forbid
[1:50:35] that we should forsake the Lord to serve
[1:50:38] other gods for the Lord Our God he it is
[1:50:42] that brought us up and our fathers out
[1:50:45] of the land of Eden I want you for a
[1:50:48] moment to get this sense
[1:50:51] of
[1:50:53] of nostalgia
[1:50:56] I want you to imagine that you are there
[1:51:00] and that Joshua has just said it's time
[1:51:04] to make the choice
[1:51:07] I want you to imagine that you heard the
[1:51:11] prophet of God say uh choose today whom
[1:51:16] you'll serve
[1:51:18] but as for me in my house we will serve
[1:51:20] the Lord and as as the word of the Lord
[1:51:24] begins to come here out of these
[1:51:26] scriptures I want you to reminisce
[1:51:29] I want you to become very nostalgic and
[1:51:33] I want you to begin to reminisce and I
[1:51:36] want you to begin to rehearse the
[1:51:38] faithfulness of God to you in your past
[1:51:42] I'm not asking you to believe a God you
[1:51:44] don't know
[1:51:46] I'm asking you to put your trust in a
[1:51:49] God who has already proven himself to
[1:51:51] you time and time and time and time and
[1:51:56] time again you and I have absolutely
[1:51:58] nothing to lose
[1:52:01] somebody said well I got to protect my
[1:52:03] reputation I hate to tell you you ain't
[1:52:05] got one
[1:52:07] [Applause]
[1:52:08] there's people there are people already
[1:52:10] think you're crazy
[1:52:12] [Applause]
[1:52:14] you don't even have to post on Facebook
[1:52:16] you just get mixed up with this word
[1:52:22] you were labeled a cult before you ever
[1:52:25] started
[1:52:32] somebody said to me well that sounds
[1:52:33] like a cult well I don't know the
[1:52:36] biggest one I know of are the followers
[1:52:37] of Jesus Christ
[1:52:40] because they almost beat all the
[1:52:42] criteria that the world uses so
[1:52:45] somebody's going to think you're crazy
[1:52:48] remember in South Carolina when God told
[1:52:51] us to anoint rocks
[1:52:55] he said I'm gonna let you use these
[1:52:57] rocks as a point of contact this is the
[1:52:59] one I I didn't anoint this one way back
[1:53:01] then but this one says uh I see on it
[1:53:08] because this is the one that I anointed
[1:53:11] for the high season they took it home to
[1:53:13] Tucson with them and laid it on the
[1:53:15] front lawn of their property and
[1:53:17] instantaneously nearly by my Miracle God
[1:53:20] allowed that property to sell so that
[1:53:22] they could move here to serve the Lord
[1:53:24] with us
[1:53:27] but I just started using this in South
[1:53:29] Carolina as a point of contact my mother
[1:53:32] was getting more and more committed to
[1:53:34] the Lord and she wanted to move to South
[1:53:36] Carolina where God was moving in the
[1:53:38] church and her her work didn't want her
[1:53:41] to transfer and she needed a transfer
[1:53:43] she she couldn't just quit and start
[1:53:45] over she needed a transfer so she
[1:53:48] brought a rock and we anointed it with
[1:53:50] oil and we went to South Carolina and
[1:53:52] put it in the branch that told her there
[1:53:54] were no openings
[1:53:56] and we went to Columbus and put it at
[1:53:58] the branch that told her she would not
[1:54:00] be able to get a transfer and we waited
[1:54:03] about a week
[1:54:06] she got a call from Columbus that said I
[1:54:09] think we might can do a transfer and got
[1:54:12] a call from South Carolina and said we
[1:54:13] just had a teller job open would you
[1:54:15] like to have it
[1:54:16] see but people don't understand they
[1:54:20] don't understand per clause
[1:54:26] are you with me
[1:54:28] don't forget your amen
[1:54:30] it's a power of agreement
[1:54:37] we had gotten a little low
[1:54:40] because I had been giving out so many
[1:54:42] prayer cloths lately that brother
[1:54:43] Branham had prayed over and we had
[1:54:46] gotten a little bit low
[1:54:48] and I have a whole sheet and I I really
[1:54:52] didn't want to
[1:54:53] to use it just yet
[1:54:56] and
[1:54:57] we were out at sister greens
[1:55:01] look there's some green ones
[1:55:04] we were out at sister Green's house with
[1:55:06] Karen and
[1:55:07] Karen was giving my wife a sweater
[1:55:11] that sister green wore to every Harmony
[1:55:14] that I was ever in it with her and Stacy
[1:55:16] said I probably won't be able to wear
[1:55:18] that sweater sister green was about a
[1:55:20] two size two
[1:55:22] and she said I might not even be able to
[1:55:24] wear that sweater and I said well you
[1:55:26] take it and remember Sister Green and
[1:55:28] just remember I told it it more than she
[1:55:30] ever wore it
[1:55:32] because when we were taking care of her
[1:55:34] she'd say here Steve take my sweater
[1:55:38] and it was an honor
[1:55:40] I I loved it I I loved it I'm going to
[1:55:43] miss toting that black sweater around
[1:55:44] but my wife has it so if I ever need to
[1:55:47] tote it I can tote it again because
[1:55:48] she's got it
[1:55:49] when we were leaving the house
[1:55:52] brother Bobby wanted to see the red hat
[1:55:54] that he had given the family that
[1:55:57] brother Branham and brother green wore
[1:55:59] in the hunting trip to up on the Alaskan
[1:56:02] Highway
[1:56:03] and he wanted to see it the family
[1:56:05] wanted to hold on to it and he was okay
[1:56:07] with that but he wanted to see it and so
[1:56:09] she got it out for us to look at again
[1:56:11] and as we were going out the door she
[1:56:14] said I found some more prayer cloths
[1:56:17] would you like to have some to take home
[1:56:25] son if I keep giving them out this way
[1:56:28] I'm going to have to I'm going to have
[1:56:30] to go into my very reserved
[1:56:35] don't judge
[1:56:40] don't judge
[1:56:43] I can feel you
[1:56:47] you judgers don't ask me for one of
[1:56:49] these prayer clothes
[1:56:52] why do we have prayer
[1:56:57] called Miracles wrought by having a
[1:57:01] piece of the clove
[1:57:03] that belong to the apostles
[1:57:06] those prayer cloths that brother green
[1:57:08] got brother Branham to pray over the
[1:57:10] night before the morning of the accident
[1:57:12] it was really the morning of the
[1:57:14] accident
[1:57:15] brother green took those prayer calls to
[1:57:18] South America and remember the man took
[1:57:20] one and unraveled it and started
[1:57:23] swallowing it for an inoperable case of
[1:57:26] stomach cancer and God healed him
[1:57:29] not because there was healing in the
[1:57:32] cloth but there was faith
[1:57:34] that the same God who had moved before
[1:57:37] wouldn't move again
[1:57:39] amen and so when when they began to hear
[1:57:42] that we had anointed a rock
[1:57:44] they said well that's a cult that's not
[1:57:47] in the Bible you you can't anoint rocks
[1:57:50] and give them out and what kind of crazy
[1:57:52] cult is that and said in fact I heard
[1:57:55] that they got down on their knees and
[1:57:58] crawled around with a with rocks on
[1:58:01] there on their back and chanted the name
[1:58:03] of a dead man
[1:58:07] I said I've never heard of such an all
[1:58:09] my life first of all I've never crawled
[1:58:11] around on my back with raw my hands and
[1:58:13] knees with the rocks on my back chanting
[1:58:16] the name of anybody
[1:58:18] much less a dead man isn't it crazy how
[1:58:21] lies can be told
[1:58:24] there's a God in here who knows the
[1:58:26] truth
[1:58:27] there's a God in here who can turn on
[1:58:29] the lights
[1:58:30] I tell you I appreciate what Joshua said
[1:58:33] this morning he said I made up my mind I
[1:58:36] made a commitment that I was gonna do
[1:58:38] what God told me to do no matter how it
[1:58:41] felt no matter who it made in math I
[1:58:44] wasn't going to miss the Lord again
[1:58:47] we ought to everybody everyone have that
[1:58:49] kind of an attitude so I want you to be
[1:58:51] very
[1:58:53] variance we go over a few of these
[1:58:55] things as quickly as possible uh give me
[1:58:57] my verses back
[1:58:59] for the Lord Our God he it is that
[1:59:02] brought us up out of our fathers excuse
[1:59:04] me up and our fathers out of the land of
[1:59:07] Egypt from the house of bondage and
[1:59:10] which did those great signs in our sight
[1:59:12] and preserved Us in all the way wherein
[1:59:15] we went and among all the people through
[1:59:18] whom we passed and the Lord drave out
[1:59:21] from before us all the people even the
[1:59:24] amorites which dwelt in the land
[1:59:25] therefore will we also serve the Lord
[1:59:29] this is their answer
[1:59:32] can I paraphrase that and tell you that
[1:59:35] they said he's never given us any reason
[1:59:37] to doubt and so we have no problem
[1:59:40] brother Joshua just declaring with you
[1:59:43] that as for us
[1:59:47] we'll serve the Lord too
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:52] I'm preaching this morning on our sacred
[1:59:55] heritage
[1:59:56] I'm subtitling it a Divine minority
[2:00:00] you didn't know who you were
[2:00:02] but you are a Divine minority
[2:00:08] and how many of you know when you are a
[2:00:10] Divine minority with God you become a
[2:00:13] majority
[2:00:15] the Old Church of God used to sing a
[2:00:17] song in their yearly song book they put
[2:00:19] out and then they'd have singspirations
[2:00:21] and people would go to learn the new
[2:00:23] songs that came out in the new song book
[2:00:25] every year and I remember that one year
[2:00:28] the song was one man and God can Triumph
[2:00:31] for a thousand one man and God put Satan
[2:00:35] on the run so be careful weary pilgrims
[2:00:38] stand up for God and see one man and God
[2:00:41] can win the victory you may feel like a
[2:00:45] minority but you're a Divine minority
[2:00:49] when you're holding on to God
[2:00:52] when he's the one you refuse to let go
[2:00:54] so he said we will also serve the Lord
[2:00:57] for he is our god let's move
[2:01:00] and Joshua said unto the people you
[2:01:02] cannot serve the Lord for he is Unholy
[2:01:05] God he is a jealous God
[2:01:10] somebody said well that's Old Testament
[2:01:12] so you no longer think he's jealous for
[2:01:14] you he is
[2:01:17] ain't no wall he won't climb up or kick
[2:01:20] down or whatever the words are come on
[2:01:23] now she's coming after me he's coming
[2:01:26] after me he's coming after me he's
[2:01:29] coming after me he's a jealous God he
[2:01:32] will he said now uh uh ye cannot serve
[2:01:35] the Lord for he is Unholy God he is a
[2:01:37] jealous God he will not forgive your
[2:01:39] transgressions nor your sins if you
[2:01:42] forsake the Lord and serve strange gods
[2:01:48] it's happening all around us
[2:01:50] people poking all these holes in their
[2:01:53] bodies and doing all these crazy things
[2:01:55] it's insanities loose in the world today
[2:01:58] it's paying homage to false gods you
[2:02:02] can't serve the god of Eternity and
[2:02:04] serve strange Gods at the same time you
[2:02:08] don't have to say Amen
[2:02:10] it's the truth anyway
[2:02:12] then he will turn
[2:02:15] you better read it or you won't believe
[2:02:17] it
[2:02:28] you want to know everything about his
[2:02:30] nature
[2:02:31] you got to know everything about his
[2:02:33] nature he's a jealous God you start out
[2:02:36] to serve him you better not pick up
[2:02:38] other gods along the way for if you do
[2:02:40] the same God who ran after you will run
[2:02:42] after you
[2:02:47] the same God that did you right
[2:02:52] he knows how to bring hurt
[2:02:54] he knows how to consume you somebody
[2:02:56] said that's not New Testament it's Bible
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:00] and it's not to cause you to fear God
[2:03:02] it's to cause you to walk in the fear of
[2:03:04] the Lord
[2:03:06] which is reverential fear after that he
[2:03:09] hath done you good are you still with me
[2:03:11] and the people said unto Joshua and they
[2:03:13] no
[2:03:15] but we will
[2:03:18] serve the Lord
[2:03:21] so let's do this this morning I want
[2:03:22] everybody in here to know
[2:03:24] that if you get off the path
[2:03:28] you're gonna find some hurt
[2:03:32] if you get everybody look at me
[2:03:35] that can
[2:03:38] you decide that you're going to pick up
[2:03:40] sin
[2:03:42] you're going to live your own life
[2:03:43] instead of The Godly life the way of the
[2:03:46] Lord you're going to find out that it
[2:03:48] hurts
[2:03:51] it may take you years to get to the end
[2:03:54] of you
[2:03:55] but if you were ever his in the
[2:03:57] beginning he'll find you come on now
[2:04:00] he'll chase after you
[2:04:02] he will have you
[2:04:06] and even knowing that about him I want
[2:04:08] to know is there anybody in here that
[2:04:10] would answer the same way the children
[2:04:11] of Israel that day and say no we heard
[2:04:14] it all
[2:04:15] but we will serve the Lord
[2:04:19] can you say you'll serve him even if you
[2:04:21] know that you may find harm if you Stray
[2:04:24] From the Path can you trust God that he
[2:04:28] will not allow more on you
[2:04:31] will you trust that he is sovereign
[2:04:35] will you trust him like brother Branham
[2:04:37] said that God will put a harness and a
[2:04:40] bit on your trouble
[2:04:42] [Applause]
[2:04:44] he will restrain your troubles
[2:04:48] he will drive them like a man drives a
[2:04:51] chariot
[2:04:53] they will not overcome you they will not
[2:04:56] take you under they'll only bring you
[2:04:59] again and again and again and again to
[2:05:01] the foot of the cross can you trust a
[2:05:03] God Like That
[2:05:04] [Applause]
[2:05:07] you see this is where the church world
[2:05:09] has it so wrong
[2:05:11] because they're so upset with how God
[2:05:13] has been presented that they are
[2:05:15] presenting a God that's not even the god
[2:05:17] of the Bible
[2:05:19] when you hear people say God don't care
[2:05:21] how you dress and God don't care how you
[2:05:23] live and God don't care how you're
[2:05:24] baptized I want you to know that is a
[2:05:27] false god
[2:05:28] [Applause]
[2:05:30] that's not the god of the Bible
[2:05:32] the god of the Bible is very specific
[2:05:34] about how you conduct yourself how you
[2:05:37] live your life the god of the Bible is
[2:05:39] very specific about how you should be
[2:05:41] baptized in water
[2:05:42] not in the name of titles
[2:05:50] but in the Dame
[2:05:52] and yet knowing all that there is to
[2:05:54] know
[2:05:55] have you seen anybody suffer did you
[2:05:57] know Christians get cancer
[2:05:59] did you know Christians lose loved ones
[2:06:02] did you know Christians go through some
[2:06:04] heartache and high blood pressure and
[2:06:06] did you know Christians go through some
[2:06:07] stuff can you still serve a God that
[2:06:09] would allow that to come on your life
[2:06:12] knowing that he has not allowed it to
[2:06:15] destroy you he has allowed it to bring
[2:06:17] you to the end of you
[2:06:19] so that you can surrender and let him
[2:06:21] take over in your life
[2:06:23] come on now oh I got us I gotta I gotta
[2:06:27] I gotta go on
[2:06:30] nay but we will serve the Lord what's
[2:06:32] the next verse
[2:06:33] and Joshua said unto the people you're
[2:06:35] witness is against
[2:06:43] some light bulbs are going off
[2:06:46] I'm going to remind you of this
[2:06:49] when you tell me you can't hold on any
[2:06:51] longer I'm going to remind you of this
[2:06:53] day
[2:06:54] I'm going to tell you the God who
[2:06:56] brought you this far
[2:07:00] is the same God that'll take you to
[2:07:02] rapture
[2:07:03] [Applause]
[2:07:05] I'm going to remind you that when it
[2:07:06] looks like or feels like you're going
[2:07:08] down the last time there's a God in
[2:07:10] those waves
[2:07:12] there's a God that sits on top of the
[2:07:14] flood there's a God that rides the winds
[2:07:17] and the waves Hallelujah and he's cut
[2:07:20] into your rescue
[2:07:21] because that's who he is
[2:07:25] so we Are Witnesses against ourselves
[2:07:29] that we have chosen the Lord to serve
[2:07:32] him and they said we Are Witnesses let's
[2:07:36] say that we are witnesses that come hell
[2:07:39] or high water we are going to serve the
[2:07:41] god of the Bible
[2:07:46] we'll stand against the oppression of
[2:07:49] government or whatever we have to say
[2:07:51] we're going to serve the god of the
[2:07:52] Bible
[2:07:53] we're going to serve him according to
[2:07:55] the dictates of his word
[2:07:57] not just the feelings or impressions of
[2:07:59] our hearts
[2:08:00] now therefore put away
[2:08:02] the strange gods
[2:08:04] which are among you
[2:08:06] you can't sit in front of that idiot box
[2:08:11] and fill your mind full of the Slime and
[2:08:14] garbage of the world all week long and
[2:08:17] expect to step out of that
[2:08:20] and hear from God
[2:08:23] you're gonna have to watch what you led
[2:08:26] in the eye gate
[2:08:27] you're gonna have to watch what you led
[2:08:30] in the ear gate
[2:08:31] come on I believe a holy ghost-filled
[2:08:34] believer ought to be able to censor
[2:08:36] himself
[2:08:40] I believe a Holy Ghost Field believer
[2:08:42] ought to be able to know when he's when
[2:08:44] he's overboard
[2:08:46] when he's gone too far when he's
[2:08:48] spending more time with the world than
[2:08:50] he is the kingdom of God
[2:08:53] I believe we ought to be able to know it
[2:08:55] I believe we ought to have strength to
[2:08:56] do something about it
[2:09:00] I think for most people the best thing
[2:09:02] you can do is not have a television at
[2:09:04] all
[2:09:07] but if you're going to keep one on your
[2:09:09] phone
[2:09:16] you see that's what I'm saying you'll
[2:09:18] never be able to get out from under the
[2:09:21] influence of that stuff until you make
[2:09:23] up your mind I'm not going to let that
[2:09:25] contaminate my spirituality
[2:09:27] I'm not going to get my imagination so
[2:09:30] stirred by the world that I can't hear
[2:09:31] from the spirit
[2:09:33] I got to have a clear channel here so by
[2:09:36] the Holy Ghost we ought to be able to
[2:09:38] discern and know when we're going too
[2:09:40] far when we're crossing a line when
[2:09:42] we're meddling with things that that we
[2:09:44] shouldn't meddle with when we're playing
[2:09:46] with Strange Fire when we're serving
[2:09:48] strange gods
[2:09:50] you see there's a lot of people out
[2:09:51] there don't know that some of the things
[2:09:53] they do with their hair
[2:09:54] and some of the things they do with
[2:09:56] their bodies
[2:09:58] is giving homage to strange gods
[2:10:03] because nobody wants to tell them
[2:10:08] because most preachers know what will
[2:10:10] happen when you try to start setting
[2:10:12] people's lives in order
[2:10:13] talking to them about their ear Bobs and
[2:10:16] piercings and all the rest of this stuff
[2:10:17] you start saying something like that and
[2:10:19] when you know what will happen they'll
[2:10:21] be turned off the church you know and
[2:10:23] they won't come back and you've got to
[2:10:25] make sure that you're
[2:10:27] so it's better to ignore the fact that
[2:10:30] in their ignorance their serving and
[2:10:32] worshiping strange gods
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:37] at some point you're going to have to
[2:10:39] make up your mind but as for me in my
[2:10:41] house
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:10:43] is that too rough
[2:10:46] maybe you shouldn't preach that hard
[2:10:47] with visitors here I didn't know all of
[2:10:49] you was coming
[2:10:50] I wasn't sure who'd be here
[2:10:52] I didn't choose my message around you
[2:10:57] now therefore put away said he the
[2:10:59] strange Gods which are among you and
[2:11:00] incline your heart unto the Lord God of
[2:11:02] Israel
[2:11:04] and the people said unto Joshua the Lord
[2:11:06] our God
[2:11:08] will we serve and his voice will we obey
[2:11:12] who wants to say that out loud with me
[2:11:15] let's go back there it is the Lord Our
[2:11:18] God will we serve and his voice will we
[2:11:22] obey do you mean it
[2:11:24] so Joshua made a covenant with the
[2:11:27] people that day and set them a statute
[2:11:29] and an ordinance in shechem
[2:11:32] and Joshua wrote these words in the book
[2:11:34] of The Law of God and took a great Stone
[2:11:36] and set it up there under an oak that
[2:11:39] was by the sanctuary of the Lord and
[2:11:42] Joshua said unto all the people behold
[2:11:45] this Stone shall be a witness unto us
[2:11:47] for it hath heard all the words of the
[2:11:50] Lord the stone The Rock heard the words
[2:11:54] yeah
[2:11:55] isn't that what he said
[2:11:57] don't we now know that's the truth
[2:12:02] don't we now know that anything that had
[2:12:04] life has recording ability
[2:12:10] through sound through through light
[2:12:12] through vibration
[2:12:15] don't we now know that in fact if a
[2:12:17] device could be created or invented that
[2:12:20] we could release the sound out of this
[2:12:22] pulpit
[2:12:23] because as long as this wood was alive
[2:12:26] it was a recording device
[2:12:28] somebody said well what about the rock
[2:12:30] there's no life in that rock unless God
[2:12:33] touches it
[2:12:35] this is somebody said this is all
[2:12:37] metaphoric it is to a certain degree
[2:12:40] metaphoric but it's also a witness to us
[2:12:43] so that we will know that when we make
[2:12:46] these glorious confessions of how we're
[2:12:48] going to serve the Lord
[2:12:51] that the least we can do is not forget
[2:12:53] what we promised God
[2:12:57] for he had heard all the words of the
[2:12:58] Lord which he spake unto us this Stone
[2:13:00] it shall be therefore a witness unto you
[2:13:03] lest ye deny your god let's go on so
[2:13:06] Joshua let the people depart every man
[2:13:09] unto his inheritance is that what it
[2:13:12] says and they went
[2:13:15] and they went now I've got to give you
[2:13:17] one more judges too
[2:13:19] 7 through 12 and then I'm going to call
[2:13:22] on these brothers
[2:13:23] and the people serve the Lord all the
[2:13:25] days of Joshua all the days of the
[2:13:28] elders that outlived Joshua who had seen
[2:13:30] all the great works of the Lord that he
[2:13:33] did for Israel and Joshua the son of
[2:13:36] noon the servant of the Lord died being
[2:13:38] 110 years old
[2:13:41] and they buried him in the border of his
[2:13:44] inheritance in Timnath Harris in the
[2:13:47] Mount of Ephraim on the north side of
[2:13:49] the Hill gosh
[2:13:50] and also all their Generations were
[2:13:54] gathered under their fathers and their
[2:13:56] arose hello
[2:13:59] and there arose another generation after
[2:14:02] them
[2:14:04] if somebody doesn't preach it if
[2:14:07] somebody doesn't embrace it if somebody
[2:14:10] doesn't believe it if somebody doesn't
[2:14:12] hold on to it
[2:14:14] there will arise another generation
[2:14:17] after this one who will forsake the god
[2:14:19] of their fathers how many of you know
[2:14:22] it's already happening
[2:14:23] [Applause]
[2:14:25] so that should behoove you and I to hold
[2:14:28] on to God more
[2:14:29] not less
[2:14:32] he said and there arose another
[2:14:34] generation after them which knew not the
[2:14:36] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[2:14:38] for Israel
[2:14:40] and the Elders of Israel did evil in the
[2:14:42] sight of the Lord and served
[2:14:45] by El
[2:14:46] and they forsake the Lord God of their
[2:14:48] fathers which brought them out of the
[2:14:50] land of Egypt and followed other gods of
[2:14:53] the Gods of the people that were round
[2:14:55] about them and bowed themselves unto
[2:14:57] them and provoked the Lord to anger now
[2:15:01] now just real quick here what has
[2:15:03] happened a generation has passed that
[2:15:07] saw the works of the Lord
[2:15:09] that saw the Miracles well I don't like
[2:15:12] to go to church and hear you always
[2:15:13] talking about brother Branham let me
[2:15:15] tell you something the generation that
[2:15:17] saw that Ministry is leaving us swiftly
[2:15:21] if somebody doesn't remember who God was
[2:15:25] they'll never be able to know who God is
[2:15:29] you don't embrace the Now by rejecting
[2:15:31] the past
[2:15:33] you embrace the Now by building a
[2:15:35] foundation on that which has already
[2:15:37] happened
[2:15:38] the god of yesterday is the god of today
[2:15:41] and he will be the god of tomorrow if
[2:15:44] you believe that's amen we have a Divine
[2:15:47] heritage
[2:15:49] we have a Divine and sacred Heritage as
[2:15:52] a Divine minority in this hour
[2:15:55] now what did the generation of Joshua
[2:15:57] see well we talked about some Miracles
[2:15:59] we could have said in our day the last
[2:16:01] generation the generation of the Prophet
[2:16:03] they saw Miracles like that that little
[2:16:05] girl who grabbed a hold and said I just
[2:16:08] want to or the little black lady over
[2:16:09] there in in in Tennessee Holding On
[2:16:12] Believing God
[2:16:14] God would send to Parson to pray for her
[2:16:17] son who was dying of venereal disease
[2:16:19] hello
[2:16:20] so we rehearse of what we know that God
[2:16:23] has done not because we think that he
[2:16:25] can't still do but because we want to
[2:16:27] remember that he's the same yesterday
[2:16:29] and today and forever are you still with
[2:16:32] me so I want us to go real quick I want
[2:16:35] to remind you of what that generation of
[2:16:37] Joshua saw they were in Goshen first of
[2:16:41] all uh Elias are you ready Genesis 47 27
[2:16:45] Genesis 47 27 brother Shaw Exodus 8 22.
[2:16:51] they'll put it up I think
[2:16:56] that's it even though the the site is
[2:16:59] not there that's that is it they won't
[2:17:00] have any way of knowing it if we don't
[2:17:01] remind them that is Genesis 47 27 stand
[2:17:04] up
[2:17:05] read it and Israel dwelts in the land of
[2:17:08] Egypt in the country of Goshen Goshen
[2:17:11] and they had possessions therein and
[2:17:14] grew and multiplied exceedingly so the
[2:17:16] generation of Joshua leave it so the
[2:17:18] generation of Joshua found God's
[2:17:21] protective hand even though they were
[2:17:23] dwelling in the land of Egypt God gave
[2:17:26] them Grace in Goshen somebody say with
[2:17:28] me Grace in Goshen
[2:17:31] and though Egypt was under a terrible
[2:17:33] time and would eventually lead to all of
[2:17:36] the plagues God was taking care of his
[2:17:38] people where in Goshen because there's
[2:17:41] Grace where
[2:17:43] in Goshen and guess what they they grew
[2:17:46] and they multiplied exceedingly be
[2:17:49] seated Elias brother Shaw stand up if
[2:17:52] you will and read Exodus 8 22.
[2:18:00] and I was ever in that day the land of
[2:18:02] Goshen in which my people dwell that no
[2:18:05] swarms of fly shall be there

[2:21:11] aren't you here today because he did
[2:21:14] and then God let me tell you what else
[2:21:16] the generation of Joshua saw they saw a
[2:21:18] cloud by day and a fire by night brother
[2:21:21] Daniel read for us Exodus 13 21 and 22.
[2:21:25] and the Lord went before them by day in
[2:21:27] a pillar of a cloud to lead them to lead
[2:21:30] them the way and by night in a pillar of
[2:21:33] fire to give them light to give them
[2:21:37] life to go by day and night that's right
[2:21:40] he took not away the pillar of the cloud
[2:21:43] by day yes nor the pillar of Fire by
[2:21:45] night from before the people thank you
[2:21:47] brother
[2:21:49] that's what the generation of Joshua saw
[2:21:52] a god who's able to protect them from
[2:21:54] the heat of the day and guide them
[2:21:56] through the Darkness at night come on no
[2:21:59] under the generation of Joshua were
[2:22:01] believers
[2:22:02] we could just go back one generation ago
[2:22:05] and say they saw a man who could tell
[2:22:07] him the name of their doctors and turn
[2:22:09] his back and give them the address and
[2:22:11] tell them what was wrong with them and
[2:22:12] pronounce them healed
[2:22:14] that generation that generation saw
[2:22:17] Supernatural events and and an angel of
[2:22:21] the Lord writing a a drawing a diagram
[2:22:24] on the wall of the church and
[2:22:26] a supernatural Cloud vindicating that he
[2:22:29] was about to release a message to his
[2:22:31] bride and come on a pillar of fire
[2:22:34] hanging over a prophet's head and that's
[2:22:36] what the generation of William random
[2:22:38] saw
[2:22:39] no wonder they believed no wonder so
[2:22:42] many could Embrace in that hour
[2:22:44] all right
[2:22:46] Exodus 14 brother Austin Hodges uh I
[2:22:49] want you to read 19 through 22. this
[2:22:52] talks about the crossing of the Red Sea

[2:22:57] in the angel of God which went before
[2:23:00] the camp of Israel removed and went
[2:23:02] behind now listen to that listen to that
[2:23:04] and the pillars

[2:23:15] he removed from from leading them and
[2:23:18] look what he did he came right back here

[2:25:13] go back by a strong East Wind that's
[2:25:16] right all of the night and made the sea
[2:25:18] dry land in the water water divided
[2:25:21] that's it and
[2:25:23] and the children of Israel went into the
[2:25:25] midst of the sea upon the dry ground and
[2:25:28] the waters were a wall a wall unto them

[2:26:04] brother Daniel no who was supposed to be
[2:26:06] yeah brother Daniel read Exodus 16 4 and
[2:26:09] 5 because they got hungry got hungry the
[2:26:12] generation of Joshua got hungry
[2:26:14] then saith the Lord unto Moses behold I
[2:26:17] will reign bread from heaven for you
[2:26:19] bread from heaven
[2:26:22] and the people shall go out and gather a
[2:26:24] certain rate every day biscuits from the
[2:26:27] sky that I may prove them
[2:26:29] whether they will walk in my law or no
[2:26:31] yes and it and it shall come to pass
[2:26:34] that on the sixth day that they shall
[2:26:35] prepare that which is they bring in and
[2:26:38] it shall be twice as much as they gather
[2:26:40] daily look at that you're not supposed
[2:26:43] to gather on the Sabbath so
[2:26:45] supernaturally miraculously God's gonna
[2:26:47] come he keeps his own calendar
[2:26:50] he's going to come in on the sixth day
[2:26:52] and make sure that he gives enough so
[2:26:54] they don't have to be gathering on the
[2:26:56] Sabbath day supernaturally God does that
[2:26:58] when they tried to get ahead of God you
[2:27:00] know that didn't work did it they tried
[2:27:02] to gather more than they were going to
[2:27:04] need the Bible said it it uh uh it
[2:27:07] spoiled
[2:27:09] it stank and bred worms
[2:27:13] it rotted and created maggots hello
[2:27:17] now if you just do it God's way he'll
[2:27:19] give you all you need
[2:27:21] he'll provide for you if you'll trust
[2:27:23] him but you get smart and leave God out
[2:27:26] and leave your tithe out and leave your
[2:27:27] giving out and save it for yourself
[2:27:30] you'll never enjoy it
[2:27:34] the tax man will get it the mechanic
[2:27:37] will get it
[2:27:39] somebody will get it you won't have

[2:29:55] behold I will stand before thee there
[2:29:57] upon the rock in horrible and thou shall
[2:30:00] Smite The Rock and there shall come
[2:30:01] water out they got thirsty
[2:30:04] they needed some water
[2:30:06] and God could have let them down they're
[2:30:08] in the desert first of all God could
[2:30:10] have led him to a stream
[2:30:12] but God had a provided way he led them
[2:30:15] to a rock
[2:30:17] they're thirsty so what does God do he
[2:30:19] leads them to a rock
[2:30:21] then he gives him strategy sorry brother
[2:30:23] read on
[2:30:24] and there shall come water out of the
[2:30:27] Rock
[2:30:28] who's ever heard of such water out of
[2:30:31] the rock read on that the people may
[2:30:33] drink the people are going to drink the
[2:30:34] water that comes from the Rock
[2:30:37] and Moses did so in the sight of the
[2:30:39] Elder and that's exactly what he did now
[2:30:41] read for me before you sit down read
[2:30:43] numbers 20 and 8. I wished I had time to
[2:30:47] preach on this a little bit but I don't
[2:30:48] so take the rod take the rod and gather
[2:30:51] thou the assembly together thou and
[2:30:54] Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the
[2:30:56] rock before their eyes
[2:30:58] and it shall give forth his water and
[2:31:01] thou shalt bring forth to them water out
[2:31:03] of the rock so Thou shalt give the
[2:31:05] congregation and their
[2:31:07] I want you to look at that thank you
[2:31:09] brother
[2:31:11] pillar of cloud by day Pillar of Fire by
[2:31:14] night
[2:31:17] Passover
[2:31:19] go shouldn't Grace
[2:31:21] protecting his people
[2:31:23] Manna three times a day
[2:31:25] all the quail they wanted it was all you
[2:31:28] can eat meat Buffet
[2:31:31] then they needed water and God said I'll
[2:31:33] just give you water out of a rock
[2:31:36] so so God has the prophet to take his
[2:31:38] staff and smite The Rock which was
[2:31:40] Christ
[2:31:42] if you don't understand that you can
[2:31:44] read First Corinthians chapter 10 where
[2:31:46] it talks about that rock that followed
[2:31:48] them that rock was Christ it was out of
[2:31:51] Christ the symbol of Christ that the
[2:31:53] water flowed and you know brother
[2:31:56] Branham tells us something interesting
[2:31:58] about this we don't have time to preach
[2:32:00] about it but he said here here God has a
[2:32:03] a an updated plan
[2:32:06] they're they're thirsty again and God
[2:32:08] said this time I don't want you to Smite
[2:32:10] The Rock I want you to
[2:32:13] speak to the Rock Moses in his anger
[2:32:16] because of the people that he had to
[2:32:18] Pastor
[2:32:19] not making excuses for Moses but I feel
[2:32:22] you brother
[2:32:26] he said I'll show you how to get water
[2:32:29] out of the he struck it again and
[2:32:31] brother Branham said he threw the whole
[2:32:33] thing out of cater because the rock
[2:32:35] represented Christ and Christ was never
[2:32:37] to be smitten but once but what did God
[2:32:40] do God allowed water to flow anyway God
[2:32:44] did not embarrass the prophet in front
[2:32:46] of the people but I tell you what he did
[2:32:48] do he didn't let him have the
[2:32:50] inheritance
[2:32:52] he took him up on the top of Mount Nebo
[2:32:54] and said look at all of it I want you to
[2:32:56] see it all because this is as close as
[2:32:58] you're going to get to the promise you
[2:33:00] don't want to find yourself looking at a
[2:33:01] promise that you can't take an embrace
[2:33:04] come on now you don't want to let your
[2:33:06] anger your frustration your prejudices
[2:33:09] your bitternesses your jealousies your
[2:33:12] pettiness you don't want anything to
[2:33:14] disqualify your promise
[2:33:18] you don't want to be on the mountain
[2:33:19] looking at what you could have had
[2:33:21] anybody with me
[2:33:23] [Music]
[2:33:27] all right I can't read these
[2:33:30] I could read I could have another
[2:33:31] brother to read Exodus 15 22-26 when the
[2:33:35] water got bitter God had a way to purify
[2:33:37] the water
[2:33:39] generation of Joshua saw
[2:33:41] they saw the justice of God they saw the
[2:33:43] Earth open up and swallow the naysayers
[2:33:46] in Numbers chapter 16 verses 23 through
[2:33:48] 24. and what does God say to them who
[2:33:52] else will read for me I'm not quite done

[2:39:59] that he might bring us in
[2:40:03] [Music]
[2:40:07] God didn't bring you out to leave you in
[2:40:09] the wilderness
[2:40:11] he brought you out to take you into the
[2:40:15] promise don't you let the let them steal
[2:40:18] don't you let the devil steal your
[2:40:20] promise that's right

[2:41:09] [Applause]
[2:41:16] the children of Israel out of Egypt to
[2:41:18] let him die in the wilderness he brought
[2:41:20] him out of Egypt to take him into the
[2:41:21] Promised Land
[2:41:23] God didn't bring you out of dark
[2:41:25] denominationalism to allow you to form a
[2:41:28] denomination around the truth
[2:41:30] he brought us out to take us in
[2:41:35] Hallelujah the Third Exodus leads us to
[2:41:38] the promised land if you believe that
[2:41:41] same man now listen now now we're almost
[2:41:44] to a place that we can come to an end in
[2:41:46] a moment
[2:41:47] but here's the thing you need to
[2:41:48] understand only one generation passed
[2:41:53] Joshua's generation so all these things
[2:41:56] Joshua's generation got all these
[2:41:58] instructions and the Next Generation
[2:42:01] arose
[2:42:04] somebody didn't remember
[2:42:11] they say remember what God has done
[2:42:13] remember how I brought you out remember
[2:42:15] how I fed you with the Manna remember
[2:42:17] how I gave you water from the rock
[2:42:19] remember remember remember remember
[2:42:20] remember remember remember
[2:42:25] because if we don't remember what do we
[2:42:28] do we forget
[2:42:30] and there arose a generation after
[2:42:32] Joshua who forgot
[2:42:35] we have a sacred heritage
[2:42:39] that we cannot forget
[2:42:41] God's been good to us as a bride people
[2:42:45] to bring us out of dark
[2:42:47] denominationalism to bring us to life
[2:42:49] brother surely
[2:42:51] psalm 106.
[2:42:54] 6 through 15 do not forget is the theme
[2:42:57] of this verse read it for us brother
[2:42:59] I'll try to show you the kindness of not
[2:43:02] interrupting you much
[2:43:06] wait a minute let's see what's going on
[2:43:08] with his mind
[2:43:10] there you go
[2:43:11] we have sinned without our fathers we
[2:43:14] have committed inequity we have done
[2:43:16] wickedly come on our fathers understood
[2:43:19] not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered
[2:43:22] not the multitude of thy mercies come on
[2:43:24] but provoked him at the sea even at the
[2:43:27] Red Sea come on nevertheless he saved us
[2:43:30] he saved him for his name his name sake
[2:43:36] they should have all been destroyed it
[2:43:40] wasn't their goodness that got them
[2:43:42] through the Red Sea it was his goodness
[2:43:44] it wasn't their ability to obey that got
[2:43:47] him in good standing
[2:43:49] it was his Mercy his goodness now
[2:43:52] everyone should have drowned in the Red
[2:43:54] Sea if you and I got what we deserved if
[2:43:57] we got what was coming to us by our
[2:43:59] sloppy living
[2:44:01] we would have already been destroyed
[2:44:04] nevertheless read that one again
[2:44:05] nevertheless he saved them for his
[2:44:08] name's sake that he might make his
[2:44:11] mighty power to be known oh that's good
[2:44:14] he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was
[2:44:17] dried up
[2:44:19] so he led them through the depths as
[2:44:22] through the Wilderness same way he
[2:44:24] brought him through the Wilderness he
[2:44:25] brought him through the depths of the
[2:44:27] sea come on
[2:44:28] and he saved them from the hand of him
[2:44:31] that hated
[2:44:32] and redeemed them from the hand of the
[2:44:35] enemy oh that's good that's good that's
[2:44:37] good and the waters covered their
[2:44:38] enemies come on there was not one of
[2:44:41] them left what enemy what enemy what
[2:44:44] army what Pharaoh come on
[2:44:48] then believed they his words they sang
[2:44:52] his praise sang his praise
[2:44:55] they soon forget his words okay here we
[2:44:58] go
[2:44:59] hmm
[2:45:00] they're dancing on the red Seashore
[2:45:02] they're having a Pentecostal Jubilee the
[2:45:04] Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing
[2:45:06] they're having a great time wonderful
[2:45:09] Services wonderful praise when people
[2:45:11] first come out of denominationalism to
[2:45:13] follow this message the people were free
[2:45:15] the people were happy they rejoiced in
[2:45:18] their Newfound freedom
[2:45:21] but here's the problem
[2:45:23] read it brother they soon forget his
[2:45:26] Works they soon forgot his Works they
[2:45:28] waited not for his counsel
[2:45:32] but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness
[2:45:35] and tempted God in the desert
[2:45:38] and he gave gave them their request
[2:45:42] but but sent leanness into their souls
[2:45:45] thank you brother thank you so much you
[2:45:47] can read for me anytime your voice is
[2:45:50] very soothing
[2:45:52] how many of you think you ought to do an
[2:45:53] audio book
[2:45:57] [Applause]
[2:46:00] they got leanness
[2:46:03] because they forgot
[2:46:05] we've got to remember Galatians 5 1
[2:46:08] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[2:46:10] where the Christ made us free be not
[2:46:12] entangled again with the yoka bondage
[2:46:13] Hebrews 2 1. therefore we ought to give
[2:46:15] the more Earnest heed to the things
[2:46:17] which we have heard lest at any time we
[2:46:20] should let them slip Satan is after this
[2:46:23] generation he wants them to accept
[2:46:25] psychology intellectual conception
[2:46:28] instead of a living personal
[2:46:30] relationship with a living God a
[2:46:32] generation that does not recognize God
[2:46:34] will be enticed by other gods they
[2:46:37] become attractive to those who have
[2:46:39] never encountered God for themselves it
[2:46:42] is not enough to know the stories of
[2:46:44] God's past exploits they're carefully
[2:46:46] and lovingly preserved for us so that we
[2:46:49] can better recognize the attributes and
[2:46:51] characteristics of a personal God but we
[2:46:54] should know how he works and what he
[2:46:57] desires from his people it is them that
[2:46:59] we can adjust and make necessary steps
[2:47:02] to align our lives with his Divine will
[2:47:05] and purpose we have a generation alive
[2:47:07] now that have in many cases never had to
[2:47:10] depend on the Lord for their provision
[2:47:13] like generations of yesteryear can
[2:47:15] anybody say Amen to that they've had
[2:47:17] most things handed to them
[2:47:20] but the one thing that we as parents
[2:47:22] cannot just hand over to our children is
[2:47:24] our born-again experience every man
[2:47:27] woman boy or girl must come to a real
[2:47:29] born-again experience for themselves the
[2:47:32] new birth is as essential to this
[2:47:35] message as being able to recognize the
[2:47:38] messenger for this day
[2:47:41] in the in in the church age book
[2:47:44] Satan is the greatest sophist
[2:47:47] a philosopher one who is more concerned
[2:47:49] with superficial reasoning rather than
[2:47:51] using a sound argument he has never been
[2:47:54] overcome in the shrife of words
[2:47:57] you can't talk the devil you can't
[2:48:04] of men are usually heard more than the
[2:48:06] word of God each one Chatters as he
[2:48:09] pleases or kills Time by learn
[2:48:11] disquisitions and disproving the views
[2:48:13] of others of the new birth and how a man
[2:48:17] must be changed into the likeness of
[2:48:19] Christ to become partakers of the divine
[2:48:21] nature second Peter 1 4 scarcely
[2:48:24] anything is said
[2:48:27] this is more true today than in the
[2:48:29] years it was written of the power of the
[2:48:31] keys the church has almost lost the
[2:48:33] power of binding and only the power of
[2:48:36] losing remains I want to remind you that
[2:48:38] the church age book says almost lost the
[2:48:40] power
[2:48:42] and we're not talking about the church
[2:48:45] we're talking about the bride's
[2:48:46] Authority if you're with me say Amen

[2:48:52] get to this spot

[2:48:56] the musicians to come

[2:54:54] and I want you that will to listen
[2:54:56] carefully as they play something
[2:55:01] the other morning
[2:55:02] I was laying in my bed this is Brother
[2:55:04] Branham
[2:55:06] and I'd been asleep
[2:55:09] and I dream that Joseph was sick
[2:55:12] and I had picked him up to pray for him
[2:55:16] and when I woke up I was very upset
[2:55:20] I said well maybe Joseph is going to be
[2:55:23] sick
[2:55:26] a little bit louder on the music so I
[2:55:28] can hear you
[2:55:29] and I look going before me in a little
[2:55:32] dark shadow
[2:55:33] rather of a brownish color it seemed
[2:55:36] like it was me
[2:55:38] and I watched it and coming behind it
[2:55:40] was someone White
[2:55:42] and it was him
[2:55:44] I looked over to my wife see he's not
[2:55:47] asleep anymore
[2:55:48] he's in Vision now I looked over to my
[2:55:51] wife to see if she was awake that I
[2:55:54] could show her if she could see the
[2:55:58] vision
[2:55:59] but she was sleeping
[2:56:02] I said oh I'm sorry Lord
[2:56:06] but that's been my life
[2:56:09] you had to drive me to everything that I
[2:56:16] done can someone help me hear the music
[2:56:18] can someone Luke can you help me
[2:56:30] I said oh I'm sorry Lord
[2:56:34] but that's been my life
[2:56:36] you've had to drive me to everything
[2:56:39] that I've done
[2:56:40] every time anything would happen I'd
[2:56:43] think it was you doing it and I realized
[2:56:46] it was Satan trying to keep me away from
[2:56:52] it
[2:56:53] I said if you if you could only live me
[2:56:58] and as I looked I seen the prettiest
[2:57:01] face I ever saw on a man he was in front
[2:57:05] of me looking back he raised his hand
[2:57:07] and got a hold of mine and started
[2:57:09] moving this away the vision left me
[2:57:13] last Sunday morning
[2:57:16] I was had waken up early that was on
[2:57:19] Saturday this vision
[2:57:27] I've always worried
[2:57:30] I've always thought of dying at me being
[2:57:33] 50.
[2:57:34] my time is not didn't think was too long
[2:57:37] and I wondered what I would be in that
[2:57:39] theophany that Celestial body Stay With
[2:57:42] Me
[2:57:44] would it be that I would see my precious
[2:57:46] friends and say a little white fog going
[2:57:49] by and say there goes brother Neville or
[2:57:52] Hell or they or he couldn't say hello
[2:57:54] brother Branham and when Jesus come then
[2:57:56] I'd be man again I often thought that
[2:57:59] he's trying to imagine what eternity
[2:58:01] would be like
[2:58:02] I was dreaming that I was out west and
[2:58:05] was coming down through a little
[2:58:06] Sagebrush place and my wife was with me
[2:58:09] and we had been trout fishing and I
[2:58:11] opened up the gate and the skies were so
[2:58:13] pretty they didn't look like they do
[2:58:15] over the valley here
[2:58:17] they were blue in the pretty white
[2:58:18] clouds and I said to my wife I said we
[2:58:22] ought to been out here a long time ago
[2:58:24] honey for the children's sake we should
[2:58:26] have been Billy and I woke up
[2:58:29] this is a little confusing if unless you
[2:58:32] follow
[2:58:33] he thought I'm Dreaming so much I wonder
[2:58:36] why
[2:58:37] and I looked down
[2:58:39] down like laying by me
[2:58:41] and I raised up on my pillow as many of
[2:58:44] you people have done it put my head on
[2:58:46] the headboard of the bed and put my
[2:58:48] hands behind me and I was laying there
[2:58:50] like this
[2:58:51] and I said well I just wonder what it
[2:58:54] will be on the other side I'm already 50
[2:58:57] and haven't done nothing yet if I could
[2:59:00] only do something to help the Lord now
[2:59:02] listen this is a man who had one of the
[2:59:05] greatest Ministries the world ever saw
[2:59:08] he's still feeling like he's
[2:59:10] accomplished nothing for the Lord and
[2:59:13] he's still embarrassed by the fact that
[2:59:15] anything he did ever do for the Lord the
[2:59:17] Lord had to drive him to do it
[2:59:19] so he's contemplating eternity here
[2:59:23] if I could only do something to help the
[2:59:25] Lord for I know I won't be mortal half
[2:59:28] of my time is gone at least or more than
[2:59:30] half if I live to be as old as my people
[2:59:33] still half my time is gone
[2:59:36] and I looked around this is powerful I
[2:59:38] hope you can hear it I was laying there
[2:59:40] fixing to get up it was about seven
[2:59:42] o'clock and I said I believe I'll go
[2:59:44] down to church this morning if I'm
[2:59:46] hoarse I'd like to hear Brother Neville
[2:59:48] preach
[2:59:49] and so I said are you awake honey and
[2:59:52] she was sleeping very soundly and I
[2:59:54] don't want you to miss this it has
[2:59:56] changed me I can't be the same brother
[2:59:59] Branham that I was
[3:00:01] and I looked
[3:00:03] and I heard something kept saying you're
[3:00:06] just starting
[3:00:07] press the battle
[3:00:10] just keep pressing I want to read that
[3:00:13] one again
[3:00:15] I heard something kept saying
[3:00:18] you're just you're just starting
[3:00:20] press the battle just keep pressing
[3:00:26] I shook my head a minute I thought well
[3:00:29] I I probably just me thinking like this
[3:00:30] you know a person can't get some
[3:00:33] imagination and I I said I just probably
[3:00:35] imagine that and it said press the
[3:00:38] battle
[3:00:39] keep going
[3:00:41] keep going
[3:00:42] I said maybe I said it I put my lips
[3:00:47] within my teeth and I put my hand over
[3:00:49] my mouth and there it came again just
[3:00:52] keep pressing Church
[3:00:57] I want you to hear this
[3:01:01] maybe you've been there
[3:01:03] or you felt like that
[3:01:06] everything you've ever done for the Lord
[3:01:08] he had to drive you to do it he had to
[3:01:10] push you to do it
[3:01:12] maybe you heard Joshua's testimony where
[3:01:15] he said I'm just not going to worry
[3:01:16] about it anymore I'm just going to do
[3:01:18] what he lays on my heart to do maybe you
[3:01:20] feel that way
[3:01:22] but you've been so discouraged
[3:01:25] some of us have forgotten what God has
[3:01:28] done for us already
[3:01:30] he said there it come again just keep
[3:01:33] pressing if you only knew what was at
[3:01:36] the end of the road
[3:01:38] seemed like I could hear Graham Snelling
[3:01:41] or somebody sang the song they sing it
[3:01:43] here
[3:01:44] I'm homesick in blue and I want to see
[3:01:48] Jesus
[3:01:49] I'd like to hear those sweet Harbor
[3:01:51] bells chime it would brighten my path
[3:01:54] and vanish all fears Lord let me look
[3:01:56] past the curtain of time you've heard it
[3:01:59] sang here at the church
[3:02:01] and I heard something say would you like
[3:02:05] to see just beyond the curtain I said it
[3:02:08] would help me so much
[3:02:12] just a glimpse
[3:02:14] just a glimpse beyond the curtain of
[3:02:16] time
[3:02:18] I looked in just a moment one breath had
[3:02:20] come into a little place that slanted I
[3:02:22] looked back and I was laying there on
[3:02:24] the bed this is a strange thing I said
[3:02:28] now I would not want you to repeat this
[3:02:30] this is before my church or the sheep
[3:02:32] that I'm pastoring whether it was I was
[3:02:34] in the body or not whether it was
[3:02:36] translation it wasn't like any Vision
[3:02:38] I'd ever had I could look out there and
[3:02:40] I could look here
[3:02:42] and when I hit that little place I never
[3:02:45] seen so many people come running and
[3:02:47] screaming oh our precious brother
[3:02:51] and I looked and young women maybe in
[3:02:53] their early 20s 18 to 20. they were
[3:02:56] throwing their arms around me and
[3:02:58] screaming our precious brother
[3:03:01] Here Comes young men and the Brilliance
[3:03:03] of Young Manhood their eyes glistening
[3:03:06] and looking like stars on a darker night
[3:03:08] their teeth as white as Pearl and they
[3:03:10] were screaming and grabbing me and
[3:03:12] screaming oh our precious brother and I
[3:03:16] stopped and I looked and I was young and
[3:03:18] I looked back at that old body laying
[3:03:20] there with my hands behind my head and I
[3:03:23] said I don't understand this
[3:03:26] and these young women throwing their
[3:03:28] arms around me now I do realize this is
[3:03:30] a mixed audience I say this with the
[3:03:32] sweetness and the melowness of the
[3:03:34] spirit man cannot put your arms around
[3:03:36] women without a human sensation but it
[3:03:39] wasn't there
[3:03:42] there was no an oyster day
[3:03:44] nor tomorrow
[3:03:46] they didn't get
[3:03:48] I never see
[3:03:50] sin all my life they had hair way down
[3:03:52] to their waistline long skirts to their
[3:03:54] feet they were just hugging me it wasn't
[3:03:56] a hug like even my own sister sitting
[3:03:59] there would hug me
[3:04:01] they were not kissing me and I was not
[3:04:04] kissing them
[3:04:05] I I I I haven't got the vocabulary I
[3:04:09] haven't got the words to say perfection
[3:04:11] wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even
[3:04:13] touch it nowhere it was something that
[3:04:15] you just have to be there
[3:04:18] and I look this way in that way and they
[3:04:20] were coming by the thousands
[3:04:23] and I said I don't understand this
[3:04:26] it's gone
[3:04:28] here come hope
[3:04:30] that was my first wife
[3:04:33] remember the one who passed away
[3:04:35] she run and never said my husband
[3:04:38] she said my precious brother and when
[3:04:41] she hugged me there was another woman
[3:04:43] standing there that had hugged me and
[3:04:44] then hoped hugged this woman and each
[3:04:48] one and I thought oh this has to be
[3:04:51] something different I thought oh I I
[3:04:54] ever want to go back to that old carcass
[3:04:56] again
[3:04:57] I looked around then and I thought what
[3:05:00] is this and I looked real good and I
[3:05:02] can't understand this but hope seemed to
[3:05:04] be like a guest of honor she was no
[3:05:06] different but just like the guest a
[3:05:08] guest of honor and I Heard a Voice when
[3:05:11] they spoke to me that was in the room
[3:05:12] said this is what you preach was the
[3:05:15] Holy Ghost this is perfect love and
[3:05:19] nothing can interhear without it are you
[3:05:23] still listening I know you're tired I
[3:05:25] know you're tired
[3:05:27] I am more determined than and ever in my
[3:05:31] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[3:05:34] there there was no jealousy there was no
[3:05:37] tiredness there was no death sickness
[3:05:40] could never end there mortality could
[3:05:43] never make you old
[3:05:45] they could not cry it was just one Joy
[3:05:49] oh my precious brother and they took me
[3:05:52] up and set me up on a great big high
[3:05:55] place I thought I'm not dreaming I'm
[3:05:57] looking back at my body laying there on
[3:05:59] the bed
[3:06:00] and they set me up here and I said oh I
[3:06:02] shouldn't sit up here
[3:06:04] and here comes women and men from both
[3:06:07] sides just in their Bloom of Youth
[3:06:08] screaming one woman was standing there
[3:06:10] screamed oh my precious brother oh we
[3:06:13] are so happy to see you here I said I
[3:06:15] don't understand this
[3:06:17] and then that voice it was speaking from
[3:06:19] above me said you know it is written in
[3:06:22] the Bible that the prophets were
[3:06:23] gathered with their people and I said
[3:06:25] yes I remember that well this is when
[3:06:28] you will gather with your people
[3:06:30] I said then they'll be real and I can
[3:06:33] feel them oh yes
[3:06:35] I said but there's Millions
[3:06:37] there's not that many branhams
[3:06:40] and the voice said they're not branhams
[3:06:43] they're your converts that's the ones
[3:06:45] you led to the Lord and said some of
[3:06:48] them women there that you think is so
[3:06:49] beautiful or better than 90 years old
[3:06:51] when you led them to the Lord
[3:06:54] no wonder they're screaming our precious
[3:06:56] brother you see he's looking beyond the
[3:06:59] curtain of time and they screamed all at
[3:07:02] once if you hadn't went uh have went we
[3:07:05] wouldn't be here I looked around I
[3:07:07] thought well I I don't get it oh where
[3:07:09] is Jesus
[3:07:10] I want to see him so bad
[3:07:13] and they said now he's just a little
[3:07:15] higher right up that way someday he'll
[3:07:18] come to you you were sent for a leader
[3:07:20] and God will come and when he does he'll
[3:07:23] judge you according to what you taught
[3:07:25] them first whether they go in or not
[3:07:27] we'll go in according to your teaching I
[3:07:31] said oh I'm so glad I did Paul does he
[3:07:33] have to stand like this does Peter have
[3:07:35] to stand like this the answer was yes
[3:07:37] I said then then I preached every word
[3:07:40] that
[3:07:40] word that I never divided from it one
[3:07:43] side to the other were they baptized in
[3:07:45] the name of Jesus Christ I did too where
[3:07:48] they taught the baptism the Holy Ghost I
[3:07:50] did too whatever they taught I did too
[3:07:53] and then people screamed and said we
[3:07:55] know that and we know we're going with
[3:07:57] you someday back to the Earth said Jesus
[3:08:00] will come and you'll be judged according
[3:08:01] to the word that you preached to us
[3:08:04] and then if you were accepted at that
[3:08:06] time which you will be then you will
[3:08:08] present us to him as trophies of your
[3:08:11] ministry you will guide us to him and
[3:08:13] all together we'll go back to the Earth

[3:08:22] but keep pressing on I looked and I
[3:08:25] could see the people as far as I could
[3:08:27] see still coming waiting wanting to hug
[3:08:29] me screaming our precious brother
[3:08:33] sent a voice said all that you ever
[3:08:36] loved and all that ever loved you God

[3:44:20] boy this is wonderful there's so much
[3:44:22] that could be said
[3:44:27] let's pray again
[3:44:29] Heavenly Father
[3:44:32] and all the times in my life I've
[3:44:34] thought about being a father I never
[3:44:36] imagined it'd be the two twin girls
[3:44:40] but this is your doing and it's
[3:44:42] marvelous yes
[3:44:45] and I do Marvel at it yes
[3:44:50] father you have brought together in
[3:44:52] these two
[3:44:53] two Trails of Faith yes
[3:44:56] one through their grandmother or
[3:44:58] great-grandmother who is here today
[3:45:00] one through my
[3:45:03] my great hand Pearl that I never knew
[3:45:06] but lived a life of faith
[3:45:11] but has come down
[3:45:13] to my grandmother to my mother and to me
[3:45:15] that's it I'm here today holding these
[3:45:19] girls because of
[3:45:21] the life she lived yes thank you Jesus
[3:45:27] when
[3:45:28] Jacob in the Bible was at the end of his
[3:45:31] life
[3:45:32] he said to his sons you know what I've
[3:45:35] lived for you know what I've stood for
[3:45:38] my girls here today are at the beginning
[3:45:40] of their lives
[3:45:42] they don't understand those things just
[3:45:44] yet
[3:45:45] but you Lord you know in all my
[3:45:47] faltering ways how I've tried to live
[3:45:50] and how I've tried to stand
[3:45:55] believing that you are the same
[3:45:57] yesterday today and forever yes
[3:46:01] I asked you write this upon my little
[3:46:04] girl's Hearts yes Lord let that seat of
[3:46:06] Faith would go into them and produce a
[3:46:09] harvest
[3:46:13] that would produce more than I can
[3:46:15] imagine so I can't even ask because I
[3:46:17] don't even want to set that kind of a
[3:46:19] limit right no limits
[3:46:22] but no matter how life May
[3:46:25] be difficult at times for them no matter
[3:46:28] how the enemy May rage
[3:46:30] I asked the Lord that they will always
[3:46:32] know that you are Jesus Christ yes the
[3:46:36] same yesterday today and forever that's
[3:46:38] right
[3:46:39] I dedicate them to you Lord yes Lord as
[3:46:43] gifts from you yes
[3:46:46] please father bless them keep them make
[3:46:49] your face shine upon them and be
[3:46:51] gracious to them may you always lift up
[3:46:53] your accountants upon them and give them
[3:46:55] peace
[3:46:58] and last of all father for their mother
[3:47:00] and I Lord
[3:47:02] we don't ask for riches or worldly
