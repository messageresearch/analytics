acquainted with dad's church one didn't go one did daughter and or a lady and her daughter the lady fighting cancer she was supposed to go this past Monday to get staples out from where she'd been operated on and that very day her daughter 44 years old died of cancer but on the same day when I was in church a man gave a testimony of how a year before he stepped up for prayer and asked Dad and I to pray for him and he was cancer-free I don't understand the mind of God but I Want To Praise Him in the good times and in the bad times when I see that someone is cancer-free and when I see that he chooses to take them by the way of the Grave God is good all of the time and all of the time God is good he knows what's best for me he knows what's best he knows the path ahead so I worship I'll

true [Music] foreign we knew all those things but we did not know that it was those things that was keeping her bound so after and and due to her due to her uh her handicap that Satan has Bound for all these years she was not even able to understand what brother Shelley was saying at the time but I understood so when I explained it to her it all made perfect sense praise the Lord so we just continue in the Lord amen hey man well we give the glory to Jesus we give the glory to Jesus we give the glory to you Lord you wonderful and worthy what you started you're more than able to finish [Music] what you started Lord you are more than able to finish [Applause] Lord Jesus not for our feelings God for our glory Lord any of ours but For Your Glory we're asking you to finish what you have started [Music] oh praise be to God praise be to God [Music] the Lord showed me one of the greatest revivals that was to come was to the plain people showed it to me years ago when I had only met strangers who were Amish but I began to hear about a prayer meeting that was taking place a secret prayer meeting that was taking place in Lancaster County and I began to pray for the plain people for the anabaptist people and God began to show me a Revival coming to those people and I believe it is yet to come and I believe this these that have come and joined fellowship with us through these last couple of years I believe they're part part of what God's going to do the first time brother elim told me about these Saints in Ohio my heart went out to them brother Elam you know it did I'm not just making that up my heart went out to them and and there we prayed that God would continue to reveal himself to them and I prayed then selfishly Lord bring some of them to us and let us meet them and last night that prayer was fulfilled and I hope we get to meet the rest of you all and I hope that what the Lord does there my my Holmes County is that is that where it is say it tell it brother praise God praise God right praise God praise God praise God Hallelujah we believe it praise the Lord Hallelujah I saw myself in a vision riding in the back of an Amish open Boogie where the Bible and brother Brandon's spoken word book in my hand and I knew that it wasn't just a Revival of the spirit and receiving the baptism of Holy Ghost but I knew it would be a Revival of receiving the message of the owl and it may be hard work and it may be slow work but we know that God is able to accelerate that work Hallelujah and bless bless there there are brothers and sisters listen there's been no one like the anabaptist people who have paid a price for what truth had been revealed to them when they when they realized by the word of the Lord that they were not to baptize babies with sprinkling and they begin to stand against the Church of the day they were persecuted and murdered they were assassinated for their stand of the truth and they they stood for baptism upon accountability upon knowing what you were doing and understanding what you were doing and then there was groups through the years that saw that it should not be entitled that it should be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ again persecuted so we believe that about the time that Revival hits Asia as was prophesied by our Prophet that before that Revival could come back to Jerusalem it had to pass through the Asian countries on its way back and about the time we see and other places waking up to the message of the hour the restoration of apostolic faith then we know that whatever God's going to do he has to do it quickly because we still believe that there's a Rapture Resurrection for the bride of Christ Blossom Blossom I know you've been standing alive but would you slip back to your seats and remain standing for just a moment because when we read the word if you're able we like for you to stand because if there was anything anyone who should be honored and respected it's the word of God brother Branham told us that we honor the office of a man even if we can't honor the man and and I did not respect President Obama for many of the decisions that he made when he was in office but when I had the opportunity to be in the room with President Obama I stood for him and clapped for him as heartily as anyone in the room because I honored the office that he held brother Ram said if the Queen of England walked in the room you wouldn't you're not even British but just out of honor and respect for the office that she holds you would stand it would be it would be your duty and if all of these offices and positions are worthy now I did I did uh I did celebrate a little bit louder when prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu walked in the room I was a little louder and there may be a video somewhere on YouTube of me trying to get to a woman and pull her down off the table who was protesting president Netanyahu prime minister Netanyahu there may or may not be some physical evidence out there uh of me trying to get to her but before I could there was a young Jewish soldier that took her right off the table and pulled her down you can have all the opinions you want to have but in that moment you want to honor the office that somebody holds what should be honored more than the word of God chapter 10 for the sake of time I may add another nail in my coffin by doing this but to save time I'm going to read it only in the Amplified because you've been sitting sitting and standing so much and I want you to have a moment now in in just a second to relax so I'll just read this quickly and bring you what the Lord has for us this morning and I I will be mindful of the hour the best I can and try to remember that some of you will be traveling great distances today would you come back and join us April 1st and the second we're going to be having another long weekend here April the 1st and the second Saturday night and Sunday morning if the weather permits we'll share our lunch together and we'll have a wonderful time and we will be having these extra Services every other month and we would invite you to come those of you who are in interested in our annual camp meeting maybe you're here you'd like to take the date down or maybe you're streaming the service we will have our annual camp meeting during the Feast of Tabernacles and that will be October the 11th through October the 16th of 2023 that is a Tuesday night through a Sunday we already look forward to what God will do what he did last night what he's already done this morning makes me look forward to what he will do and and whether you realize it or not he's he's really really good to us most all the time we have some amazing Services here I'm thankful it's him we don't know how to do it it's him Hebrews 10 35 and 36 do not therefore fling away your Fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward for you have need of steadfast patience and endurance so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God and thus receive and carry away and enjoy to the fool what is promised did you get that for you have need of steadfast patience and endurance so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God and thus receive and carry away and enjoy to the full what is Promised how many of you are waiting on some promises from the Lord may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated just give me just a hair in the monitor please when I began to pray about this weekend I was looking for something a little more needy and there are some things that I have wanted to preach about now for for several years and when I sought the Lord he began to speak to my heart as he does that still small voice of leadership how many of you are thankful for it and he began to lead me and my my plan is to obey him no matter who could understand it and when I chose to go back to something that I had ministered in 2018 last night 2019 Maybe I thought you know reruns something has to really be good for me to want to hear it or see it twice I'm not a real I'm not a real leftover fan I eat leftovers but I like it when it's piping hot and fresh not microwaved why are you so quiet I know there are people who just rather have leftovers I'm not one of them but I eat them and I don't complain every time and somebody will say well would you like to see such and such of him I said no I've already seen that they said what do you want to see it again I can't understand why you wouldn't see it again I said no once was enough there are certain things I might watch like the Ten Commandments I've watched that many many times through the years and there are certain things that are worthy so I always feel for the people that might have to hear it again and then I knew what the Lord was saying and he directed me that we would spend the spring the rest of the winter the spring and the summer just as often as possible rehearsing and reviewing the things that God has spoken to us over the past few years and I'm asking the Lord that come around the fall time just about a month before camp meeting I'm asking the Lord for special Grace for us to be able to speak about some of the things that we've been preparing to say for many years but it's all in the Lord's timing and it's in his leadership there are some things that we want to know we want to know that are going to befall of the earth and the bride and there are some things about the great Revelations that the Lord has given to his servant that we want to understand as a body of Believers we want to make it very personal so I I struggle with the with the concept of reruns although I've done some since we have added some new folks to the body but last night before I went to bed a sister who was in the service sent me a text and she said even today I was pondering the story of the Gentile woman and God used the service tonight to speak to that to speak directly to what was in my mind and in my heart and I said okay Lord if only one person received what was needed in that service then it's worth it all yesterday when I sought the Lord he took me to these notes and if you would like to have a title I am going to speak for a little while on when Harvest feels become battlefields and if I would give it a subtitle I would call it guarding your Harvest and if I would give it a second subtitle I would call it fight or flight you see you're gonna do something in the hour that we're living in right now you're gonna do something you're either Gonna Fly or die you're either going to fight or flee amen when I woke up this morning the first thing that the Lord spoke to my heart was concerning an experience that I had many years ago and I couldn't find the original experience neither sister Alfreda nor I could find the original experience we have it I just couldn't put my hands on it but I found a place where I shared it in 2004 after returning from Israel and I want to share it with you before I get into the message is that all right we were visiting a place if I remember right Carrie Payne was with me and Steve Valenti was with me and does anybody else remember who was with me on that trip Eric Norman but wasn't there another person from here was that all it was anybody remember say that again okay all right all right so Eric Norman from Norway who is with the Lord and the brother uh Stephen Valenti who is Kendra's dad who is living in California now and Carrie Payne who moved off the campground today this is what came to my mind so strong we had a wonderful visit to Israel and I love to be there and I love to be there with people who are not familiar or who have never been before because I like details and when we're out like that most of the time the people will just let me run on and on and on and on and on and on and on never stop me they just let me talk about what I'm seeing and this particular day we had settled in a park a national park in Israel we were at the foot of the gilboa mountains mount gilboa from where we were at a spring einharod I could look across the valley and up the way and see Mount Tabor we were not too far from Armageddon megiddo where the battle of Armageddon will take place we were very close to the ruins of the city of batshion some of you have been there before one of the richest most beautiful places in Israel uh 30 minutes from the Galilee just a beautiful Valley and we were visiting the spring of Gideon it is an amazing thing to know that I have put my feet in a spring that Gideon drank out of to think that that spring is still there and I sat down on the edge of the pool there and some of you been with me there I sat down on the edge of a little pool that's been built around the spring my children when they were little ran up and down those those those little creeks those little little tributaries coming out of that of that to Spring I've sat there with brother and sister West and with April and and ginger and and so many others what a brother Greely and Jonathan and perhaps and so many others and as I sat down there the spirit of the Lord began to move on me and he reminded me of an experience that I had had where the angel of the Lord was showing a paper and on that paper I let me just read what I what I shared as I was sitting there and had my feet in the water the Sun was shining it was one of the most beautiful places I'd ever I'd ever sat the Bougainvillea was filled had filled the whole side of the mountain I don't know if you know what that is or not but that's that beautiful Crimson colored tropical Bush that had filled the whole top of the of the mountain and I could look around and see the yacaranda trees those beautiful purple blooming trees all around us it was such a beautiful spot and the water felt so nice was just kind of running through the story in my mind of Gideon and how his men were whittled down from the thousands to the 300. there was a test given to see who was serious about the Battle it's all right to be thirsty but you got to know how to drink your water and keep your weapon in your hands you got to guard your Harvest I want you to help me now you've got to guard your Harvest you can't lay down your weapons while you nourish yourself you got to have your weapon in one hand and you've got to learn to lap the water you reach right down like a dog if you have to but it's a lot wiser to have one hand on the weapon in one hand with your with your shoulder turned so that you can see what the enemy is doing and so as I was sitting there the Lord took me back to a very significant thing that had happened in the spirit concerning this story and when I told this I asked you does anybody remember I was standing where a list of names were being read and beside every name an answer was given to the side of the name and it either said Stephen Shelley fearful are faithful then the next name would have been called Austin Yantis and behind his name would have been fearful or faithful someone else's name was called and behind that name I heard either the word fearful are faithful and as I was sitting there I began to weep everything in my body began to tremble as I was sitting there with those brothers and I began to weep and I felt so solemn and so serious we've been having such a Carefree morning such a wonderful time taking in the land and all of a sudden it turned so serious as I began to weep I mean I began to weep and I thought about all the trials of life that we had come through all the battles of Church Life that we had been through I began to think about all the gains and all the losses those that God had added and those that God had taken away I thought about the victories and I thought about times that it even looked like we had been defeated times that it looked like we had succeeded and times that it looked like we had failed all of this was rushing over me that day all the comings and the goings of the ministry and I knew in the spirit that we were coming to the Final Chapter and we were hearing a call we were facing a test and as I told it that morning I said we're being shocked we're being surprised that's the way God does his business he's sometimes an unpredictable God the only thing we have to predict God by is his word if he's already spoken it we know how it's going to be it'll be just like he said it was but perhaps some that we thought would be faithful I'm reading have proven to have been fearful and some who we thought would be fearful are proving to be faithful it's not my judgment it's not your judgment come on now it's not our opinion we don't get to choose who flies and who dies we don't choose who who has the fight and who has the flight we don't choose who is faithful to guard the Harvest and who is so willing to leave the field that they have planted and sowed in behind to follow something else we don't get to know that ahead of time sometime in fact we're surprised the prophet has even let us know we're going to be surprised when we get to Eternity when God dealt with brother Randleman experiences he saw people in those experiences sometimes that he didn't in his mind he didn't think they would have made it all the way but he saw listen you and I don't know all there is to know we don't understand somebody else's Journey like they do are you with me so we have to put these things in God's hands I knew there was still time for a change I knew that some who were behaving fearfully would eventually become faithful and those who were behaving faithful now would eventually become fearful but that day weeping like a baby sitting on the side of that spring I looked at those brothers and I said men what will it be will you be faithful or In the Heat of the battle will you be fearful I want you to know that fear is rooted in Pride [Music] you may not understand that concept but fear is rooted in Pride it's that self-preservation that we have I I can't afford to trust because if I trust it means I have to surrender control so many of us struggle with fear because we struggle with being able to turn loose and Let Jesus be in control you can't drive as I said here Tuesday night I think it was there used to be a bumper sticker when I was a boy that said God is my co-pilot I knew even then that was kind of an ignorant thing to say you don't need a co-pilot through life you need a pilot you need somebody to Pilot your ship you'll need somebody who will help you get through the winds and the waves you'll need somebody that'll reach beneath the surface of the water and pull you out when in a moment's time you become fearful of what you had already conquered Peter had already defeated the winds and the Waves by keeping his eyes on Jesus but when he put his eyes on circumstances he began to sink this was there and as I mentioned last night the only way to get delivered from our fear is to grab a hold of him like Peter did when he pulled him into the boat and say don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go you understand what that took I mentioned last night his arms in the film he's a little short fella he has what I call short people syndrome always making up for his height you know he was written come on don't get mad at me I'm not looking at any particular people I don't know how many people last night sent me pictures of their dogs the dogs were well represented last night on my phone I meant you and your dogs no harm I mean you I challenge people today I mean you no harm but Peter was always acting in the film and I believe in real life he was always acting like he had something to make up for he's in control he didn't ever want to be out of control when he finds out in the film this is not in the Bible but when he finds out in the film that his wife has miscarried he's out of control he just deals with a situation that he had no control over and it turns him into a tailspin and he struts around showing everybody who he is and and letting everybody know like some of you here today letting everybody know he's got a chip on his shoulder [Music] you know some of us just swallow it some of us learn just took our stuff in and others want to wear it on their shoulder so everybody can see how how worn out they are and Peter didn't care in the film who saw his problem but I want you to know he was a weepy little baby when God got through dealing with him and if you've got any sense at all church folks and I know you do you will ask the Lord whatever it takes whatever it takes to make me like a weepy little baby with my arms wrapped around Jesus saying all with everything don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go because no matter what happens we cannot afford to graduate with a mark of fearful when this thing is over we've got to have been faithful to the call if you believe that same man now when I brought this message I didn't read any of that I didn't talk about any of that but when I brought this message some years ago I started off with a statement and I want to use it again this morning if you don't mind if you don't fight for your beings come on the devil will take your taco your burrito and the whole enchilada yeah that's it somebody said that that's not a very spiritual statement oh but it is you see it's not just the beans he's after he doesn't just want to take a little something from you he don't want to just take your pocket change he's out to destroy your life anybody with me he's not just interested in your change first you have he wants to leave you busted and broken and bruised with no help with no hope with no way out he wants to destroy your self-esteem he wants to cover you in shame he wants to sore arrest you that you feel that sister hope was talking about today I'm too dirty I want to tell you today you are not too dirty for the Lord you've not done too much are gone too far today that his hand won't reach beneath the wave you don't know like I know what he's done for me I want somebody to say that with conviction you don't know what I know some of you visitors some of you newcomers you don't know who you worship with you don't know what some of us were when when the Lord found us somebody said I found the Lord I didn't know he was lost you didn't find the Lord the Lord found you and he didn't find you only when you came to church he went looking for you he saw some of us in the crack house he saw some of us in the dark alley he shall some on the abortion table he was looking for you I want to tell you like they sung last night there's no place too dark there's no wall too high there's no mountain too big that he won't come over that to get to where you are [Applause] you see some of these I feel him uh you see some of these people running around here and talking in tongues and jumping up and down and acting like life has always been so good but you may not know that you're worshiping this morning with former prostitutes former drug addicts former Gigolos former you're really gonna say it like that absolutely because I want you to know that everybody here wasn't raised in church with a silver spoon in their mouth I want you to know there are people here that have served jail time and prison time right here this morning I want you to know their thieves and liars and robbers that God has gloriously saved and delivered and sometimes now sometimes you'll hear them raising the highest Hallelujah [Applause] there's divorces there's those who live with scrambled eggs trying to make her family and his family work together they're victims of incest there's victims of homosexuality victims of sexual abuse mental abuse physical abuse sitting right here in this little church today so you looking in as a visitor are you looking in as a casual Observer on social media don't you judge my praise [Music] thank you because you don't know like I know what he's done for me come on let's give the Lord Praise come on let's lift up the name of Jesus [Applause] you don't know like I know [Applause] there are those in this room who have lived in abusive situations when I was a child I lived in an abusive situation where my mother was physically beat multiple times sent to the hospital wore stitches to her bank job you couldn't afford to miss much work so she had to just cake on more makeup to cover the bruises and to try to disguise the stitches because somebody who was supposed to love her broker bitter wanted to kill her let me tell you something life has not been glamorous for most of us and we are not here to buy we are not here today to lick our wounds or to get you to feel sorry for us [Music] there's men in this room who never knew the love of a father they're good with sisters in this room that never knew it that he's loved there are people here today that never knew a mother's love there are people here who grew up in an atmosphere screaming and hollering and Dish throwing and door slamming and holes punched through the walls we're not here to rehearse we didn't all grow up in a spiritual Utopia we didn't all go to perfect little churches where everybody loved each other some of the deepest hurts I've ever known in my life have been in church where preachers run away with piano players and oh yeah deacons ran away with this and this and that and the other and and men that you trust to carry the word you find out they're alcoholics and drug addicts when you begin to find yourself having to cover or your preacher friends because they're high when they go to the pulpit something's wrong and I lived that way nearly 10 years of my life I know exactly what it feels like to have to cover for people who have never found their real Deliverance and yet the gift that is in their life is without repentance and God continues to use them even though they are really twisted messes on the inside and what would keep a man like that from getting his help there's no other word for it except Pride we love our reputation and we love the way people look at us and the way we love the way that people honor us but I want you to know something we're coming to an hour right now where you're not going to be able to fake it until you make it and that is there are people out there that have got to have God and they've got to have him now they don't want your hypocrisy they don't want your religion they want realness they want reality they want a god with skin on him guess what I've got good news that's exactly what God is raising up in this hour a little bride [Applause] a little charge he laughed around the world that could be god with skin on him the little child was terrified of the storm didn't matter how much Mama talked or daddy talked that Thunder would come that lightning would flash in and the little child would go tearing down the hall screaming I'm scared of the storm I'm scared of the storm and mother would go in time and time again Daddy go in finally one day Mama's sitting on the bed trying to comfort the little girl because she's so afraid sweetheart you know that God Is Watching Over You darling you know that everything is going to be all right you don't have to be afraid and little girl looks up and said yes ma'am yes Mommy I know that God Is Watching Over Us but sometimes I just need a god with skin on him [Applause] so mama let me hold you a little tighter brother that's not bless for me that's human need God very much are you here God very much understands our human needs for a god with skin on him if you believe that's amen sometimes people get so spiritual and so revelated we'll use it as a word so full of Revelation and so full of church talk and seal talk and thunder talk and manifestation talk and adoption talk and sons of God talk and all that they forget that there are people out there who just need to know that your life was bad and Jesus found you he wasn't lost you didn't find him he came seeking and to save that which was lost for they that are whole need not a physician it's those who are broken and needy and I don't want to get off this I need to but I'm going to get over just quite yet there are people in this room that could show you the track marks the scars people in this room that learn how to abuse the system and go from Doctor to doctor to doctor to get the pills they needed to feel good enough to get through another day of life and Jesus found them so I'm not here selling anything I don't have anything to sell I'm not here trying to talk anybody into serving God because if I talk you into it you won't last a half a day but if you make up your mind that you're not going to get away from him and you better know I better go ahead and tell you you can't run fast enough far enough Furious enough to get away from him if he's chasing for you you're going to come you're going to come to Christ if he's coming after you you're going to come to cry you're either going to come weeping and rejoicing are you going to come kicking and screaming but he will find you and claim you as his own why would he do that because of his love because of his love because of his grace because of his Mercy he didn't die to make you a church member he died to make you a child of God so if you don't fight for your beings the devil won't just take your beans he'll take your taco your burrito and your whole enchilada and he'll leave you holding a tortilla awesome I said I love tortillas I could live on tortillas you could unless you saw me eating my burrito then you'd want something else let me tell you something there's a few things I want you to remember about Harvest did we have those the quality and quantity of your Harvest is directly proportional to how you sow you're gonna reap what you sow some of us have suffered because we sowed seeds that bring harvests of suffering that God brought us through some of us couldn't pay our light bill because we wouldn't give God what belonged to him and he said I'm going to show you if you won't give me my part somebody said I couldn't serve a god like that that's your choice remember I'm not here to I'm not here to build a church I'm not here to sell you a religion I'm here to tell you the way it is if you can't God give God that tiny little portion of what he's asked us to give him if you can't sow that into his work and into his kingdom you'll stand in an empty Harvest field it's not just money we're talking about either we're talking about sowing all kinds of seeds if if you could only understand today the quality and quantity of your Harvest is directly proportional to how you sow the Bible said every seed brought forth of his own kind not plant turnips and expect to reap corn you can't plant tears and Seed of sorrow and expect to reap Joy so the quality and quantity of your Harvest is directly proportional to how you sow your seed determines your Harvest how many of you believe there's something to that so do you really want to be stingy with God you can't read reap what you don't sow in Luke chapter 6 verse 38 the Bible said Jesus said red letter give I'm not taking an offering we already did that give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down shake them together running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again that's what I just said I paraphrase that in my initial statement that they put up there the quality and quantity of your Harvest is directly proportional to how you sow your seed determines your Harvest that's exactly what Jesus is saying here for the same measure that you meet it shall be measured to you again now remember how God looks at that it's not it's not the monetary value of what you give it's according to your need I don't know this little brother from Indiana sitting back there with the glasses and I don't want the cameras there's no camera to go on even embarrass him in any way but he touched me today I don't know him I don't know his financial situation he might be a multi-millionaire if you are brother give some more [Music] but there was something brother Chris there was something about him walking down here early there was something about him walking down here early to put that out even when brother Greeley was still praying he walked down here to put his offering in and my first thought was I hope he doesn't feel embarrassed because he came early and came by himself and about that time here come brother up here and he didn't have to come by himself but there was something about that that caught my attention I have no idea what he put in that he may have put in a fake coin foreign I have no way of knowing what he put in but there was something about him walking up that aisle as a visitor early that grabbed the heart of God and it grabbed my heart that's what I want to say to you it's not whether you give a nickel or a hundred dollar bill we give according to what we have and God doesn't pay favors to those who give more he pays favors and blessings to those who give it for the right reason now wait till I tell you the church has got it all wrong because the church will tell you that you've never given anything until you give not expecting anything back I don't believe that lie in fact I think it's one of the dumbest things the church has ever said you would be a stupid farmer don't get mad at me I didn't say you were but you'd be a dumb farmer to to spend all day putting seed down not expecting to get something back you don't give to get but when you give you ought to give in faith you ought to give knowing that God is asking us to be faithful in our giving and you ought to give knowing that if you give one seed you don't receive one seed back please let me say again it's not about the offering plate I'm using that because that's what captured my heart more importantly captured the heart of God but it's giving of yourself it's working all day on Tuesday and coming to church anyway with a headache and playing the guitar it's working all day till seven o'clock on the computer at home and so easy it would be to miss a Tuesday night but to make up your mind I may not get there till eight o'clock and I'm going don't you know God that's a seed that's a seed that's a seed I'm only calling out of you it's also to the person that walks over a piece of trash and sees it laying in a church in the church floor and instead of saying I'm going to wait on scissors Jennifer to get that they reach over and put it in their pocket until they find a time to throw it away brother that's also sowing seed for the kingdom because whatever you do for God and for the least of his little ones that you have done unto me I've watched the blessings of God I've enjoyed trying to out give God I love watching what happens when you go above and beyond when you let the Holy Ghost speak to your heart and you pray a little more than you normally would or drive a little farther to help somebody than you normally would you see your brother and sister in the need and you don't close your bowels of compassion you got to be careful you've got to be real careful because brother random said there's one thing you don't want to be guilty of and that's praying off of somebody what God has put on them they want you to know there are things that God puts on his people sometime oh yes I know that I know that ain't gonna fill up the church but we might as well tell the whole truth there are some things that we go through because God wants to help us he wants to get to our heart issues so sometimes he has to offend our minds so that he can expose what's in our heart and you think you know what's in your heart you think you know what's in your heart you think you know what's in your heart until life takes a turn and then you start finding things in your heart you didn't even know was there oh God help me Lord Jesus forgive me oh God I didn't know that was there oh Lord I thought I had settled that years ago anybody with me I gotta hurry we're still doing okay for Tom you look a little tired but I understand second Corinthians 9 6 but I say this he which soweth sparingly she shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully remember that Bountiful seed is based on how many seeds you have to sow and so that day when Jesus was standing near the temple coffer and the publicans and the and and the wealthy and the religious were walking in dropping all this money into the offering and and and walking away I thank my god I've been able to really give a big offering today and Jesus was it not at all impressed but here come a little woman with two little mites you want to see one that big glass cabinet out there before you leave you go over to that big glass cabinet and you will see there a real widow's might from the time of Jesus found in an archaeological dig in Israel tiny little coin just about like that just a tiny little piece of metal coin they called it a Widow's mind it's less than a penny and she had a couple of those and she dropped them in and it caught the heart of God it caused Jesus to be moved with compassion for her and he used her faithfulness to sow as an example to teach others how important it is to be faithful with what God gives you now there's not a person in this room that wouldn't wouldn't appreciate being wealthy oh please this is not a time to pretend to be religious nobody in here is going to turn down the big fat juicy check from the government or from your employer and you who don't even celebrate Christmas you've never turned down a Christmas bonus I'll tell you that right now preach mother because we appreciate having pocket change and we appreciate having money to pay our bills isn't that right but I want you to know sometimes if God were to give you what you've asked for what you thought you'd like to have and if he were to fill up your bank account overnight or he might let one of your get rich quick schemes become successful and you should find yourself with more money than you know what to do with don't you know God sees your heart he knows already you don't know what you do with it you think you do but you may not but God knows exactly what you would do you know one time I was asking the Lord for some money and I said Lord I really need some I'd like to have some money I need some money there's some things I'd like to do I want some money and the Lord spoke to my heart he said I'll give you what I can trust you with so many many are are like me you you can know that you have what you can be trusted with and God's been good to me I don't want to complain God has been good to me he's helped me in many many ways to clear up dead in my life for my family he's been very very good to me but I want you to know that I truly believe the more he can trust us with the more he will release into our hands and he knows exactly what we'll do with what comes our way you see there's a little widow woman here in this church who has a grandson that sometimes gives her a little extra spending money and she always gets excited about that little extra spending money and I don't blame her do you but after my sermon last night she's just as excited to thrust into my hand the tithe of that little check that little bit of money that her grandson gave because she knows the way to continue to have favor with God is to give keep Covenant with God is to give God what belongs to him and just about every time that little widow woman will say to me whoa hope he'd give me some more so I can give it to the Lord I can give the Lord his part come on now so wait reap you've sown prayed waited nothing comes in fact for some of you it seems like a harvest is long overdue sometimes we get tired of waiting but I am here to tell you today whatever you do do not abandon your seed do not abandon your seed my mind goes back to 20 how old are you Benjamin you're not 25. I should have asked somebody that would know my oldest son doesn't know how old he is let's try this again how old are you Benjamin 24 my mind goes back to about 23 years ago or no really 24 years ago to a time that we are standing on the border of the United States in Canada and Benjamin and it's in his mother's arms and we have stopped at the Border in Maine to come across from where we were visiting her parents in Canada and we have filed all of our paperwork for my wife her petition is processing to become a citizen based on her marriage to me and we have filed all the paperwork that we have been told to file and we've paid all the fees that we were told to to pay but nobody told us that we couldn't go and visit her parents in Canada while that paperwork was processing so we go across the border nobody says anything America don't say anything Canada don't say anything we go have a wonderful time with their parents and we're driving the rental car back across the border or I know I think our parents were with us mom and dad and we get there and they tell us to come in and that man looks at me and he says sir I don't have any problem with you coming in because you're an American citizen but he said I am going to have to send your wife and little baby back to Canada I want you all to know the heat was on I wanted to come across the counter and give him a good old God bless you smack dab on the nose and I said sir you can't do that to me you you can't do that to me we were there you all led us across you can't do that to me he said I have no choice it's the law you have abandoned your petition you file paperwork and before it was processed you left he said you've got to start the whole process over again and now she is going to have to spend all that time in Canada the the land of her birth but but sir we didn't know we we really truly we're not trying to break the law you have abandoned it if he said it once he said it a dozen times you have abandoned your petition you file the paperwork and before it was processed you took it upon yourself to come to Canada and now she will have to stay in Canada with the newborn and you will have to go home and she will not be allowed to cross the border until both countries have cleared the paperwork how long could that take well because you'll have to refile the process starts all over again because you abandoned your petition he said it could be three months it could be six months it could be I said sir is there anything you can do I'm a pastor I'm not a drug Runner I didn't set out to break the law you abandoned your potential I said yes so you said yeah yeah yeah you've called that to my attention I was ever done my wife is standing beside me she's Pat me on my hand stay on your side of the counter I'm ready I'm ready he was arrogant I said you're you're I'm an American why would you treat me this way I'm not a Canadian trying to come into the country illegally and neither is she we file the proper paper yes sir but she abandoned her petition we must have stood there talking about the same thing 11 dozen different ways for 30 minutes and finally he said wait just a minute he said I I don't know what to do he said I have the law to uphold he goes into the back room and leaves the door a jar about that far I said pray well honey we got to pray we begin to plead the blood of Jesus oh God if you've ever helped us help us now please help us Lord give us favor we don't deserve it but Lord we need it we did not know we did not understand we need you to move for us and I watched that man through the crack of that door doing this talking to himself he'd walk a little much I said we're in trouble not only did we get an arrogant one we got one that's got big mental problems he just goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and finally he says and he comes out he walks over to me and he said you abandoned your petition get all of this paperwork he just starts doing like this stuffing it back in the envelope or the folder and he thrusted across the desk at me and he says get out now I'm going to pretend that I never saw you and I said thank you sir I'm going to pretend the same [Applause] can't file a petition and then on your own accord walk away from what you filed because you're tired of waiting you can't plant a seed and because it hasn't come up when you think it ought to come up you can't just abandon your seed I need somebody to help me somebody's got to have faith [Applause] you hear me sister Lily somebody has to guard that seed somebody has to say I planted it in faith and I'm gonna guard it in faith and one day I'm gonna repent [Music] [Applause] not in my timing [Music] but in the Lord's time Galatians 6 9 and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap read it I need help if we faint not another version of Galatians 6 9. said so let's not get tired of doing what is good at just the right time oh I can see your sister Crawford he kind of walked like this she's with Jesus now a van happens to be watching this you know I loved your mother her shoes sometimes got a little high for my liking I don't believe in high-heeled shoes on a woman twisting her her hips let's say she didn't twist she kind of stretch it I'd say come on says she always wore hats not always but some she would wear a beautiful hats come on sister Crawford and sing for us she'd make her way up there and she'd say you Can't Hurry God you just gotta wait yeah you gotta trust him and believe because he may not come when you want him but he's right on time no no he may not come when you want him but he is right on time let me tell you something I didn't start serving the lord yesterday he filled me with the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old called me to the ministry I started preaching at seven I turned 55 this year serving God is all I've ever known and if I haven't learned a lot of things there's one thing I have learned You Can't Hurry God but once you plant a seed I don't mean the point but once you plant a seed you can't run off and leave it because you're tired of waiting for it either because the thief the thief will come he'll dig up your seed he will steal your Harvest you know this dog came to me last night in the service when I looked around and some were missing and I knew they should be here this is where they belong to be the thought came to my mind oh God don't look at this like someone has abandoned their seed let it be God that you understand the reasons why people make the decisions they make but we should be very very careful about planting a seed and leaving it in the ground to go do our will we ought to be very careful with unsanctified Mercy God will tell you what to do if you'll listen to him but if you listen to your emotions they will not often lead you to obedience but you listen to the word of the Lord and the spirit of God in you he will lead you to obedience don't plant a seed and then walk off and leave it you stay anybody with me now we're never out of here till two o'clock do you need to stand up and do jumping jacks can you stay awake a little longer can I preach just a little while longer another ver another version said so let's not get tired of doing what is good at just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up don't give in don't give up the timing of your Harvest is often determined by what you do while you're waiting for it you can speed up a harvest it depends on what you do while you're waiting on your Harvest if you're bellyaching if you're grumbling and complaining if you're reciting all the things you don't understand forgetting all the things you do understand am I with me everybody has doubt everybody has to deal with that from time to time but don't you get caught up in that vicious cycle whatever you do be careful about your thoughts watch the words that come out of your mouth you've got a lot at stake you've planted many fields with seed you have prayed and planted seed for your family you prayed and planted seed for your co-workers you've prayed and planted seed for your children don't leave the field now I I don't even mean a geographical location I'm in a state of faith a field where you have put something in the ground believing that God is going to give you the abundance of what you're planning the multiplication of the seed anybody still here let me tell you the Bible tells us whoo I need a rest just a minute I'll be right back with you do jumping jacks if you need to get your blood flowing we don't care we'll be right here Psalm 67 verse five and six wait a minute go back I'm sorry I know Austin you want me to use that other verse and I have it here but I wasn't going to take the time but go back I have to Galatians 6 9 in the Amplified and let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right for in due time somebody look at your neighbor and say it's just about due time thank you son it's just about due time my Harvest is just about due my Harvest is just about due and at the appointed season my opponent season's coming You Can't Hurry God but it's coming at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint let us not go weary and well doing for you shall reap in due season if you faint not what you do while you're waiting on your Harvest is very important and if you look at Psalm 67 verse 5 and 6 and I'm going to hurry from here on out I got to because we don't have another service together we'll be back Tuesday night but many of you will be back in your homes so I got to get this in I want to give you something to chew on can somebody Benjamin read that out loud loud read that out loud to to us would you or you won't really greedy to you want to read it out loud let yes next verse then it's a good thing you wasn't born to a black preacher cause you'd have failed you'd not make a very good black Preacher's Son you're supposed to read that like you mean then shall the Earth if you praise the Lord while you're waiting on your Harvest [Applause] [Music] he said let the people praise thee oh God let all let all the people praise thee Now read it man then shall the Earth yield her increase [Applause] and God oh even our own God [Applause] shall do what shall blast shall blast foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] but I don't know when these go these greens are going to come up I've been waiting I've been waiting I've been waiting [Music] I done got my turkey necks ready oh you mad are you mad he's mad he'll be back thank you darling oh give him a hand [Applause] you know turkey necks is what kosher people use if you don't eat if you don't eat hog gel then you buy smoked turkey necks and that's what you season your greens with and if you Yankees don't quit turning up your nose over our greens I planted you [Music] the seed packet said it only takes so long I planted you yesterday and I don't have any greens to eat yet how many of you know do everything there is a season you can't rush the seasons you've got to accept the seasons if you want the favor of the Lord to fall on you in your waiting season you spend that time let the people praise thee Oh God let all the people praise thee then shall the Earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us so I want to say again don't you judge nobody's praise in here somebody's too loud you just you don't need to tell them I know you mean well but you don't need to tell them you let the spirit of God teach him you was wild one time too spirit of God had to teach you a thing or two he had to help us we learned what order is and what acceptability is and what the right way of doing it is you just let people praise God someone said I don't like it when they wave them Flags tough nobody asked you about the flag well I don't like it when they leap across it nobody cares what you like we didn't hand you a menu when you come in here and tell you to order what you like you shouldn't judge somebody else's praise I don't judge you because you sit there like a six foot icicle [Applause] I don't judge you because you look like you've been sucking on a persimmon sometime when the word goes forward I don't judge you because you can't even wiggle your finger when the spirit's moving I'm not judging you so don't you judge somebody else because you don't know what they've been through they're watering the seed that they planted in the ground hey that's good that's good we gotta go home and I hadn't even preach my sermon yet I'm going to have to read it because I'm losing my voice I'm going to tell you something if I get excited and spit this lozenge out of my mind I am not responsible for who it hits so I suggest you on the front rows be very alert in case it flies out because it could do it and it would be Benjamin's fault but it sure does soothe my raw throat we all know that King David was a great leader of men he combined in himself the qualities of bravery and compassion and integrity that other that caused other men to Rally toward him and to his cause the Bible tells us that within his army of soldiers there were 30 plus Warriors who who in might in today's terms they might be called the Special Forces the Bible calls them Mighty Men a small militia of extraordinary skilled Warriors I'm blessed I have some mighty men fighting in this battle with me these men were the best of the best the strongest of the strong the bravest of the Brave they were the ones who would not flinch Under Fire the men on whom you could depend if you were surrounded by the enemy I may or may not know any of these people but I made this effort to connect with pop culture hmm to put it in another context these 30 men combined the strengths of Rambo Bruce Lee Chuck Norris and The Terminator uh I may not even know who some of these folks are but I may I think I gave myself away by choosing such old Heroes these were David's go-to guys when things got tough and in second Samuel 23 their names are listed but above the 30 plus there were three men three soldiers who were leaders of the 30. you don't have to show it in all Israel you couldn't find better soldiers than the three men listed here one man was named your ship bashabath another was named eliezar and the third man that was named Shama each man had risen to Fame by virtue of a great Victory one against overwhelming odds in second Samuel chapter 23 verse 11 12 do I have a few more minutes after him was shama the son of a g the herit and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop there was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines but he stood [Music] but he stood but he stood in the midst of the ground defended it and slew the Philistines one man and God can Triumph for a thousand [Music] one man determined to guard his seed stood in the midst of the ground defended it slew the Philistines but he and it says and the Lord it only takes one faithful man guarding a field and the Lord will honor his faith his courage his obedience but if you can get two or three to come together they're strength in numbers when sisters join with sisters in prayer for lost loved ones when Brothers come together in prayer for a need among themselves it is the Lord it is not the men it is not Shama it's not a shamgar it's the Lord who wins a victory The New American Standard Bible says about Shema Sharma shama is really closer to the Hebrew pronunciation it says but he took his stand I'm wondering today before we go we gotta go I'm wondering who's going to take their stand [Music] aren't you tired of wading through the land of wishy-washy aren't you tired of wading through the through the land of in and out and up and down and on the top and underneath and on fire for God one minute and deader than the door now the next minute how many of you are ready to plant your seed and guard them water them with praise stay on top of the thing until the Harvest comes I cannot tell you the fields that we have abandoned through the years I cannot tell you the harvests that we have lost in our lives because we got tired of defending the field but there is really we're coming down to an hour punch your neighbor don't let him sleep we're coming down to an hour now where we can't afford to lose another field of harvest the Bible said the Philistines gathered together at Lehigh but he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines and the Lord worked a great Victory we don't know how big the field was but we know it was literally loaded with lentils lencos were legumes small Bean like balls growing in a pod usually a reddish brown color they were an important basic Staple in the middle and near East and they are still today these lintels were needed to provide food for the local now I know people in here that like lentils I like lentils I'll eat lentil soup when someone serves me lentil soup but I want you to know I like something a little more substantial than a lentil you can hardly chew a lentil it's just so little give me a bowl of pinto beans you eat the lentils give me some pinto beans you eat the lentils give me some lima beans give me some green butter beans and then my favorite of all of them is speckled butter beans you have the lentils will you you enjoy them I'll eat them I eat them at Passover time with some of you different ones but I I'm not a literal fan but lentils were a staple food they could be eaten fresh I can't imagine that to be very exciting they could have been eaten fresh or also dried in the Sun for later use most of the lentils that we have are dried and ready to be to be to be hydrated in a soup or something like that I want you to know the enemy is strategic he knows exactly when to strike because the Bible tells us that year after year Harvest after harvest the Israelites would plow the field plant the seed cultivate the growth hold the weeds water the plants fertilize with fish heads and whatever else they did in that time so just about the time the bushes are big the blooms have passed the shells are hanging the legume shelter hanging on and it's just about time for Harvest why why don't they come when the ground needs to be tended because the enemy is lazy his children want something for free they don't know what good sweat can accomplish the enemy will come in and try to steal your Harvest without putting any effort into what's going on he'll wait until it's just about ready to verse forth and the Bible tells us that year after year when the lentils were ready the Philistines would come up over the hill screaming like a bunch of wild Indians scare the Israelites and they'd run off in the bushes and rocks and hide and the Philistines would come in with their baskets and and pick the lentils I tell you that makes me mad I don't mind to give the Philly I love everybody you can have a basket of lentils if you pick them you lazy bum shouldn't you put a little effort into this I shouldn't say that foreign I don't know how many times sister West cultivates the ground plants the seed pulls the beans snaps them washes them puts them in a bag and brings them to us I don't know how many times she's planted the corn and shut the corn and cut the corn off the cob silk the corn cut the corn off the cob and put it in Basket in bags for us to go right in the freezer that's how good she's been to us and others of you have been that good to us through the years we have truly reaped where we did not sow and not give God thanks for that but there was no reason for these Philistines to come and steal the whole Harvest they didn't even leave a a handful on purpose for the for the Israelites they came in and stole the entire Harvest while the Israelites the mighty soldiers of the armies of the Lord were standing over there with their knees knocking together afraid of the enemy's intimidation tactics and shama watch this he why he heard this he might have even witnessed this a time or two we don't know he might have run too but all we know is this one particular year he had made up his mind you've stolen my Peas the last time when you come this year you're going to find me with my sword and I'm gonna chop off a head or an arm or anything else that I because I am not going to let the enemy come in here at the last minute and steal my Harvest anybody with me the Bible tells us that the Philistines banded together into a troop they mustered for battle they assembled their armies they prepared they checked their soldiers they inventory their equipment they assess their readiness for the upcoming fight in other words they came in attack mode they were well prepared the noun Philistines means immigrants those who wander in and out of a country this is the this is the the this is where the Palestinians have descended from it had long been the custom of the Philistines to Rob Israel of their Harvest in various ways I want you to know I've got a scripture I don't have time to read in first Samuel 23 where they would wait until the grain was being thrashed in the floor and they would attack the threshing floor and steal the Harvest they waited till the hard work and even the Harvest had been done we're facing the same kind of enemy church are you with me I'm hurrying I'm hurrying he's strategic he's well prepared he wants your Harvest he wants the fruit of your labor he watched you prepare the field he watched you sow the seed he watched you hoe and pull the weeds he watched your Kinder plants beginning to grow and he carefully timed his attack when some of your efforts were beginning to mature John 10 10 the thief come at not but to steal and kill and destroy Jesus said I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly verse 11 says the people fled from the Philistines his allies left him there as the Philistine Army came in the Israeli Army ran out Sharma finds himself standing in the midst of the lintel field absolutely alone his buddies favored a strategic withdrawal that means they ran I want you to think about the bean feel for a moment a large flat field with no cover no place to hide with Bean Vines almost knee-deep your feet get tangled every time you move Wherever You Stand The Enemy sees you you're an instant Target the enemy can attack from all sides at once in whatever numbers he can muster so it's easy to find yourself surrounded on all four sides by people who would rather kill you than say hello even some Christians may suggest that the bean patch isn't worth fighting for they're bigger Hills to die on but shama was tired of watching his part of the Harvest stolen away because it could bless and sustain his family okay devil when you start putting your finger on my family you need to tell him that about your lost loved ones when you see the enemy touching your Center family you ought to fight for them just like you'd fight for your safe children you've got a right to do it defending the mean patch may have seemed rather insignificant to onlookers or to others who didn't value the field but the Bible said he stood his ground he stood in the midst of the field he stood in the midst of the plot but from the middle of the field shama had a different Bean patch perspective I love the Sharma it wasn't just a fight in the P patch it was a fight over the P patch if you're a Believer you don't need to understand excuse me if you're a Believer you need to understand there's a turf war going on Satan wants to steal the bride's territory her jurisdiction and Dominion he wants to your serve her Authority to Sidetrack the bride from her destiny Satan wants to cut the bride off from her source of nourishment he wants you to spiritually Wither in the field that's why he's after the pastors he desires to weaken you so that he can simply walk off with your inheritance with your Harvest shama it was personal something had to be done he had a cause although he did not exactly have everything going for him he was not necessarily a likely candidate for this battle alone if you look a little bit in his family history you'll find out he was the son of a g and and a G's name means fugitive one who flees his daddy was a Fleer his daddy was a runner so standing firm wasn't necessarily in shama's natural DNA you add that to the meaning of his own name some of you ought to be ashamed for the names you hang on your children people naming their children after fairies and mermaids and superheroes fireflies you're going to name your child Firefly you're going to stick that on your child someone recently told me I'm going to name my daughter Firefly are you crazy can't you find something that has some meaning to it spiritual holy word based meaning you want to name them after demons furthermore shama's name wasn't very powerful either it means waste desolation astonishment horror so his father was a runner and he was one who knows desolation and horror furthermore shama and his family were harareites the Hebrew word for heal is horror the plurality of the noun means Mountain dwellers these were considered the country bumpkins of the Old Testament them heal people them people that live in the Hills so shama had several strikes against his personal confidence my daddy's a runner I'm one who knows desolation I'm considered a country bumpkin because we come from the mountains and when uh when the battle is Raging I am the only one left to fight aren't you glad he didn't believe all the things that had been spoken over him help me we gotta go help me aren't you glad there's somebody in this house that doesn't believe every word that's been smoking over their life every time they were called stupid no good good for nothing never accomplish anything aren't you glad that Jesus rewrites our DNA aren't you glad he changes our name aren't you glad he gives us a blood transfusion [Applause] you see Church sometimes you choose your battles musicians come slowly you have to put your shoes on that's too fast slow down that's good Josh sure now show them now show them how it's done David you're always walking slow love David somebody give him a name they didn't give him a name that means wasteful desolation somebody hung the name of God's beloved on him somebody hung the name of a worshiper on him come on somebody cared about what he would end up being not just what he was in the Cradle you see folks sometimes we choose our battles sometimes our battles choose us shamba didn't particularly choose this battle but this battle chose Shama he didn't have all everything going for him that some of the others who had beautiful holy wonderful names and wonderful lineages but he had something going for him he was tired of the devil's best he was tired of being robbed from him and stolen from and taken advantage of anybody here like that anybody had your belly full of the devil ruining what God has started in your life here's the key about shama he was willing to plant his feet and grasp his weapon and let the Lord do the rest God's looking for somebody that'll hold the weapon let me tell you something you just don't know what can happen when you're willing to hold the weapon because once God crawls in that weapon it don't matter whether it's a sharpened sword or the Jawbone of an ass God knows how to use the weapon that's in your hand if you just show up and be faithful [Applause] the Bible said he defended it that word defend means to save the rescue or to deliver shama boldly removed this field from the grasp of the Philistines and he struck them down one by one I won I don't guess we'll get to any of that will we let me let me tell you something folks it's time it's past time for us to make up our minds that when the enemy comes to huff and puff and blow our house down we're going to be faithful to God we're going to be faithful to his word we're going to be faithful to his house we're going to be faithful to his servants um we're gonna be ready to fight no matter what comes our way the weapons that we fight are not against one another we do not fight Flesh and Blood we fight principalities and spiritual Powers wickedness spiritual powers in high places we're fighting a spiritual battle a supernatural battle but how many of you know God's given us everything we need to defeat the enemy and the prophet told us that everything we need to make the Rapture is in us right now we have nothing to be afraid of the only thing we fear the only thing to be feared is fear itself and all that means is if you yield to fear fear will paralyze you but if you make up your mind that I'm going to be faithful when the Lord calls my name I'm going to be found faithful what does it mean to be faithful it means to be doing what you have committed to do you show up you show up when things are hard you show up when things are good you show up to praise whether you feel like praising or not you show up to pray whether you feel like praying or not you show up to give whether you feel like you can or not because it's not the amount and somebody says to me I don't have anything to give you know what I've told them privately if you truly don't have a nickel to put in the offering plate pick you up a rock on the way in here you go get you a pebble and you say Lord I don't have anything of any monetary value but I'm bringing this to you because I've already seen what you can do with The Rock God can use a rock he took a
