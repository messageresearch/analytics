Description:
"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand." Ephesians 6:10

times that's exactly right we let him have it when when things come along to assist in stealing our joy and we lean into that that's trying to steal it there's always something lurking around to steal your joy your happiness your your sanity there's something always to lingering around i mean there are spirits that are that have been loosed against us and they're there to steal stuff from us and they're just waiting for us to lean into a negative situation to be able to grab it from us but oh if we could rather lean into the lord and lean into his promises because he has said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you i'm with you always even to the end of the world oh i'm glad i have a guide in this life that he is guiding me from moment to moment to moment and we walk in faith when it when you can't see what's five feet in front of you that's when faith kicks in you say lord i'm trusting to your unseen hand because i don't know what is in front of me i can't see it i don't know what it is but i'm walking in faith being guided by the holy spirit amen we bless you today for giving of your tithe and offering and we have made known that the first sunday of each month we are receiving a special offering on the principle of the loan the mortgage of this property we started back in june uh at a word from the lord that we needed to put forth a concentrated effort to get rid of this debt that was on this piece of property so that we could really concentrate on what the lord wanted to do with this property and so we're here today to do that we're standing right now i believe you were given three dollars on tuesday night so we can say 141 000 dollars has been given toward this debt already and we're just giving god all the praise as i begin to think about this offering today uh there was a scripture that came to me and that was be not weary in well-doing for in due season you'll reap if you faint not be not weary in well-doing that's not just about this offering that's in whatever you've put your hand to for the lord because there's many times that it doesn't look like things are going anywhere it looks like maybe you're in a holding pattern but be not weary in well-doing for in due season i'm glad my lord has a due season for me in due season you'll reap if you faint not amen praise the lord i'm going to call on brother david mann and brother robert to come today can you give me this other bag back please we want to receive this offering everything that you give in this offering for the principal will go on the principle and we're thankful to the lord that the the the uh amount is coming down the debt is coming down the interest is coming down and we give god all the glory and all the praise if you have your offering i want you to hold it in your hand and i'm going to ask god's blessing over it and also over the tithe and the offering if you're watching this service or if you are in this service and you desire to give online you can give on the app uh there's a place for you to give there and there's also a place on the website that you can give as well if you desire to be a part of this effort that the lord has instructed us to undertake father i want to thank you for what you have been doing as i lay my hand on this number 141 000 that you have so blessed us to be able to get off of that uh mortgage i thank you for it lord i thank you for the reduction in the in the interest and lord we thank you as your people have brought their gift today we bring it with purpose for the kingdom of god because we know that there are promises over this land over this ground the property that you have given to us lord and we're holding to those promises and i want to ask you lord that you will just so bless your people as they give lord they've already given tithe and offering and we bless them for that and we ask you lord that that would be used for the furtherance of the gospel of jesus christ and as we give this offering lord may it be blessed and multiplied and we'll give you the glory and the honor for it's in the name of jesus christ that we pray amen amen amen amen the lord bless you as you come and give your offering today i would like to sing the old song hold to god's unchanging hand thank you lord [Music] time is filled with swift transition not build your hopes on things [Laughter] [Music] oh [Music] oh to god's unchanging [Music] hands on things [Music] this world's main riches [Music] that so rapidly decay seek to gain [Music] [Music] your journey is completed [Music] if to god you have been true [Music] fair will you stand with us today oh let us oh let us be our hopes on things [Music] unchanged [Music] [Music] oh [Music] unchanging [Music] would you give the lord a praise this morning oh how many of you are glad you found an unchanging hand you may be seated again this morning it's wonderful to see you in the house of the lord we're so delighted you're here and we're so thankful for every person who's streaming this service today we believe god has an appointment with us i said we believe god has an appointment with us hallelujah hallelujah i was just thinking as brother greeley was mentioning the principle there's a little bit of me every time we have to do it we're delighted for what god is doing but there's a little bit of me that feels embarrassed every time we take this offering and i think there are some things that sometimes people forget along the way and one of those things is we had a great crisis to overcome some years ago we did it by the blood of the lamb we are leasing an apartment in jerusalem for for a while we're releasing two apartments now we're leasing one apartment in jerusalem and that is very costly and we've been doing that very faithfully for all of these years god has made a way so a lot of finances have gone in that direction and by the time every piece of equipment and cord and light and battery and play-out system and everything was purchased for the studio there we were right at 150 000 paid most of that by cash by offering not having to put a whole lot of that in in a charge or anything so you know it's not like god hasn't been so good to us through these years and sister flo had been telling us a long time that god had been dealing with her and she wanted us to build a box and she just said i want i want a box built i want you to put that in the don't you be embarrassed sister flo uh i want that box built i want that box put out there in that vestibule and i won't ever want people to give toward the principle of that loan to to get this property all these 60 acres and church building and everything paid off and she said then you wouldn't have to mention it you just tell everybody from time to time go to that box well we didn't get that box built and god began to really deal with brother greeley and i believe it was march you said june and i believe it was march and uh it's very rare that i get to correct you on anything like that march the 7th because he's usually the one that gets it right and i don't but uh god really began to deal with him and if it wasn't the lord then why in the world is he blessing it like he is blessing it it has been an absolute joy every week every week now it's it's not nearly as much as when we concentrate on that first sunday like the lord gave him the strategy and i'm with it 100 not putting it on him but i want him to have the credit for hearing from the lord on that and it's a joy to watch it every week and i know people come through and there's visitors and streamers and i wish they wouldn't put so much emphasis listen you you do you you do you i'm like brother jackson said don't tell me how they do it at your church when you're sitting at mine when you're streaming our service don't tell us how they do it at your service you can you either just forget about it and don't let it worry you or just get on in here oh i found something brother branham said this week about the drum that i'd never heard him say before but i'm i'm not going into that this morning but it sure did encourage my heart and you know sometimes we stir up things not sometime all the time we stir up things now let me just give you uh a brief report and then i'm gonna sing a song that sister megan asked me to sing in honor of her sister without a miracle i guess she's slipping away very fast and she has fought a brave fight for many many many years i mean she has been through so many real physical attacks in her body for over 20 years and god's brought her through every time and she has streamed services many times and uh i'm not supposed to mention but she has been faithful to support the work of the lord even though she was not physically able to be here from oregon her heart has been behind what was happening here and she is without a miracle now you know we don't know what the lord will do but it certainly looks like that she is about to find out that it's more real than what she ever dreamed it could be she's got a dear mother a waiting on her and other precious loved ones waiting on her and uh well if you thought about it you could be a little jealous actually you could be because her suffering if nothing else the pain and suffering is over and then she gets to step into all of that so i'm going to sing a song in just a minute in honor of that and because we believe that god has given her a lot of grace through her life but i want to mention brother curry i want you all to know that the lord is doing something i don't know what to call it i don't know how to define it or classify it or explain it away but he is experiencing a miraculous touch of god in his body he really is he really is [Applause] there's no doubt about it i have pictures to prove there's flesh that's coming back on his bones [Music] for those of you who have asked it could it be swelling no it's not swelling he's dehydrated there's no buildup of fluid in his body at all they're giving him fluid just now for the first time since he's been home for two weeks where he was sent home to die immediately because they said every uh i don't want to say requirement but everything that would cause sepsis is present his bowel is perforated it's spilling his waist into an open cavity he does not yet have a fever but it's just a matter of time before the sepsis sets in the flesh over a period of six years and all of the treatments and gaining a little and losing more and gaining just a little bit losing more he was skin and bones and there were places this is kind of plain talk there were places in his anatomy that were concave you could put your fist in there if you wanted to because there was so much that had changed in his physical body so many tubes so many i don't want to say cords i don't guess he's plugged in but so many kidney drains and everything just unbelievable and therefore it left places concave in his body that should be smooth and those concave places have filled out in the last two weeks i have pictures of his arms a week ago and pictures of his arms today and you can see the flesh coming back on the bone when my wife and i and benjamin visited him tomorrow will be two weeks ago in the hospital uh his hair was almost gray it was gray there was a hint of red but it was mostly gray and today his hair is mostly flaming red orange red now i'm not sure how that hair can do that because it seems to me like it would take new hair growing in but the red hair is as long as the gray hair god is doing something now the truth is uh god is either healing and restoring him to take him because he doesn't want his name to be you know maligned here in the earth and he wants to show whoever would like to see i am a healer and i'm a restorer and somebody doesn't have to waste a way to die and then everybody say it was my will or he's about to raise him up to pastor his church we just don't know what god has and either way it's a miracle i didn't give them these pictures because some of them we couldn't possibly show he may be streaming he doesn't even know i have them so i better be we better be careful what we say here because he's still feisty it comes with that red hair i don't know if you can see it anybody see that now you all didn't see him maybe like we did on monday at the hospital can you all see how red it's almost orange red can anybody see that hair is coming back on his body his arms and legs where there's been no hair [Applause] where his because of all those treatments and everything he's been through which changes your chemistry and your hormones and everything has changed by all those chemicals and so his hair his skin was smooth and he did not have body hair and i can show you pictures now his arms covered with hair his legs covered with hair something is happening god's doing something and the they don't know what the nurses don't know what to think the cancer hospital doesn't know what to think about what's going on and uh so we should you know i'm we try to be careful what we say how we say we want to give god lots of glory for what he's doing we don't want to declare that he's going to live forever because i'm not but we know that god is doing something and i was on the phone again this morning with sister anita and she referred me to the prophecy that was given over them originally six years ago when this battle was raging in the beginning and there was a line in there i'm not prepared to read it to you this morning but there yet but there was a line in there that talks about god performing a miracle that would take him back to his youth i don't know what that was i don't know what that was i don't know what is happening but i know that it is it is not supposed to happen like this in the natural the the hospice you understand hospice is end-of-life treatment so now there now there's a battle going on because she wanted to make sure that he had fluids so now she's up against the system but i want you to know she's he's getting fluids today sometimes you just have to make a stand now i know some of you are not uh minded this way but there is a lot of witchcraft you would be shocked at how much witchcraft is coming against them and what has really increased against us as well and some of it started when we started opening up the stream because you may have all good intention but you need to know there are people out there that don't have good intention and they're looking for something to latch on to we just had one little one little comment this week uh i can't say what it was but very very filthy ex filthy filthy language uh cursing you your god your jesus your church and you think sometimes people are just in rebellion and angry like that and they get come across some but sometimes it's really a spiritual battle and there's witchcraft that goes behind it and so we need to cover one another in prayer we need to pray cover that family in prayer and if i told you some of the things that we have been involved with in the last three days some of you would not be able to get a hold of it it's that it's that out there but i want you to know there is a you have a destiny and satan doesn't want you to fulfill your destiny and so there's a lot of foul spirits that operate we have become a people it seems that don't understand that our enemy is not people our enemy is a spirit and we're going to talk about that in just a minute because i'm going to preach a message this morning the battle is raging and it is it's raging but guess what [Applause] hallelujah oh jesus is the victor the lord gave me this song many many years ago we sing this in honor of a life it's about to make heaven her home i was standing on a mountain looking toward the sky when i saw a storm approaching and i feared that i would die i saw god's creatures run and see a better place to hide [Music] and cried now the clouds were moving faster and the lightning was flashing bright and the clouds grew so dark they hit the light of the sun and it seemed that it was night when all at once there was a feeling like i'd never had before [Music] up above the storm you should have heard me sing god had given me [Music] [Music] here this morning so spread your wings little [Music] [Music] you were not born to live in that valley oh you

the ground just mount up with wings [Music] all at once spirit [Music] lifted me i was high above it all i didn't have to flap around my way i never even had to move my wings the holy spirit he took control just set your wings i was soaring high above my circumstances my confusion and all my pain and though i had spent many years in that denominational barnyard i was always an eagle [Music] by his name [Music] get up above your storm get up above your circumstances you were born to live in that old valley you were predestinated to soar to fly through the sky don't let your trials bring you

us to be able by his strength and power and might to get above all the circumstances of this life so that we can come into his presence and worship him give him one more handclap of praise hallelujah can we thank our musicians and worship leader and everyone who works the cameras and the streaming the sound the projector god bless you all ephesians chapter 6 beginning in verse 10 this thursday november the 11th is veterans day it's not memorial day to only remember those who have died in the service of their country but veterans day to remember all who have served in the service of their country may god honor their memory if they have gone on and may strengthen them and provide for them many times my heart goes out to those vietnam vets who have certainly lived their lives were for many of them their lives were forever changed by the most unpopular war that the united states has ever been involved in and many of them to this day remain homeless with mental illness with not enough provision and someone said well it's available to them and in many cases it is but their condition their emotional brokenness sometimes keeps them from getting from reaching out there they're certainly paranoid and afraid and so i pray for them when this kind of thing comes to my mind and any of you that are here any of you that are streaming this service and you have served our country in any way god bless you thank you for your service and today we say goodbye for uh three months and then we'll hope to see him a few days in three more months of training as jesse uh goes off and uh we've made it very clear that this was not any of our desire for him we would have kept him here all along but he had this desire and so we love him and we pray for him and we support him and we celebrate him and our prayer is that you will never ever have to serve one day in in a real dangerous place that god will spare you that because we love you so much and we wouldn't want that for you but everyone who goes that way knows that you are certainly taking that as a risk and so his bravery today should certainly be mentioned may god bless him any of the rest of you who have that kind of an idea forget it you're called to a higher army you have a higher responsibility you're you're you are called to defend a truth a gospel a person and god will always provide he will always make a way and there's coming a day that no army and no no marine corp and no air force and no navy is going to be able to protect this nation from what she has asked for so we pray about that as well don't we on that same day november the 11th sister hoyer's birthday and she will be 101 years old in her lifetime can you imagine being born in 1920 her life has spanned 101 years and she has seen many many hardships including wars and her husband our precious brother hoyer went home to be with the lord many years ago and she has fought alone so may god bless her and those who helped care for her sister miriam and those and amelia has a birthday the same day and so where is she is she in here millie how many years are you going to celebrate six six years old happy birthday to you god bless you [Applause] i don't know if jonathan hollis is streaming this morning but he has a birthday that day and for many many years we celebrated brother tremaine's birthday on november the 11th until he went home to be with the lord and their wedding anniversary so that's always been an important day around here ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might i don't have any new scriptures to give but how many of you know they can all be new when the holy ghost is on them put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you might say pastor i'm not in much of a battle it seems i don't really know what folk are talking about my life is relatively calm well i want you to know that that is the most dangerous place to be in today because if there's a target on your back it means that you've been bought with the price sealed by the precious blood of jesus christ and the old preacher used to say he's not fighting you it's because he's got you so i'll just leave you with that brother branham said something very similar ii timothy chapter 2 while you're still standing verse 3 and 4 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ there's gonna be some hard times there's gonna be some rough places sometimes the rough places are going to be more than the smooth places there is no place to run except into the strong arms of the lord jesus christ there is no retirement in this war there's no discharge in the army of the lord and so once you recognize that you are called to his service you must therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ it's not the one that starts it's the one who finishes the course amen endure it's he that endureth till the end the same shall be saved and now the next verse no man that wareth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier jesse is about to experience a different kind of life especially as he goes through training there's going to be some things that he and i you and i and he take for granted that he will uh temporarily have suspended from his life he won't eat when he wants to eat and sleep when he wants to sleep and as long as he would like to sleep for as brother jackson told him you were you really in the natural become the property of the united states of america for a period of time you don't get to pop on facebook or instagram when you get ready you don't get to call home when you're ready there is a there is a provision made for all these things but not according to your will your desire you have to do like you're told to do and there are people who won't make it through those first first little you know pains but there will be those who determine in them in their mind i'm going all the way ain't nobody going to say i didn't do my best and it's the same way in the army of the lord you cannot be too entangled i know you're standing you can't be too entangled in what's going on in life in anybody's life including your own life because you've got a higher walk to walk and a higher place to live you are called to an ascended life a life that transcends life on planet earth you're a dual being one who has contact with the earth and one who has contact with the heavenlies all at the same time so may god give us the strength to endure hardness and may he give us wisdom not to be tangled up in the problems of our own life so that we forfeit the call of god on our life and we are not faithful to do what he has charged us to do because the most miserable man in the entire world brother david mann is somebody running from the presence of the lord trying to get out of what god has placed upon him or called him or her because i'm not one of those who believes that women don't have a call on their life they do have a call on their life and they're just as responsible for that call as any mail in this house if you believe that same man pray with me father we thank you this morning that you are god's sovereign and you are god's supreme you see all and know all you have power to change all now lord i'm asking you this morning you have done this you have put this on my heart you have taken me down this trail all week long to get to where we're going to be this morning and it's not what i wanted to talk about but it's what you have arrested me to talk about so i'm asking for your help i'm asking you to anoint us to surrender to yield i'm asking you to anoint every hearer that this word may not be something shed to fall on somebody else but that it be something that's claimed to take charge and hold of it for themselves to see themselves in this great battle and lord i ask you for strength at the end of this to remind us that the victory is ours and it doesn't matter how hard it gets or how much we lose on the way that you have promised to restore you have promised to see us through every weary mile help us i pray today in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the saint said you may be seated i'm going to ask you to go out only when absolutely necessary this morning i want you to be still i want you to reverence god and his word if you are in the vestibule i want you to be quiet i don't want you out there chatting and talking this is not a time this is not social hour you know i don't say this often this is not a social hour you've got all afternoon to talk with one another if you're in the bathroom do your business and get out of there it's not a place to meet one another you'd think i would only be talking to children right but i'm not this is the most important time not because i'm involved but because he's involved somebody needs to know if you don't already know the battle is raging i want to say it real clear now so everyone can get a hold of it the battle is raging the battle for your health it's raging the battle for your freedom may god bless the fifth circuit court amen [Music] there's a lot of wickedness in that court may god help them for giving us a temporary stay on the overreaching mandate of our government may god continue to preserve freedom we don't know how long that will be to us or for us but we want to be we want to enjoy it and appreciate appreciated and celebrated as long as we possibly can if you don't have enough courage to protect yourself whatever you do protect your children it's our highest calling as a parent anybody want to say amen you don't mean that do you i mean it i mean it there's a battle raging for our health there's a battle raging for our freedoms there's a battle raging for our sanity the devil wants to run you t totally insane somebody said i can't aim in that you ought to because it's the truth and by amending it you're not going to claim it you're going to say i got my y eyes wide open preacher i know the enemy is after me one of these days the bride's going to recognize who she is she's going to get tired of running from the enemy and she's going to run toward the roar instead of him running us all over town we're going to run him this is what god has called us to do the bride of jesus christ should be shifting the atmosphere of planet earth we have authority to do that i'm not talking about taking seven mountains i'm not talking about all the distraction of the charismatic movement in this hour i'm not talking about stolen elections and false prophecies i'm not talking about any of that today i'm telling you that i can't get myself tangled up and entangled in what every prophetic person is saying i can't allow myself to drink at everybody's trough or to eat at everybody's table when god has done such a glorious job in this hour of storing up truth for the bride so that we might be prepared to face whatever it is that the enemy would throw against us we should be moving through the atmosphere in the realm of the spirit doing and undoing interceding when intercession is needed declaring when declaration is needing prophesying when prophecy is needed you take that word of god and speak it under the inspiration of the holy ghost you're not just talking the word you're not just quoting the bible you are prophesying into the atmosphere the word of the lord the word of the lord will shift a situation faster than fasting we need to be sensitive to the wooing of the spirit to fast we need to be more willing to push the plate away and hear from god but i want you to know using the word of god is a sold out holy ghost filled believer serving it right back into the nose of the dirty devil is more effective than any other spiritual discipline or exercise it'll move more devils than any hail mary ever moved come on now your personal sacrifice can move you in certain directions but remember these things are not to move god they're to move us there are people after all these years around the bride church who still believe that fasting is to move god hallelujah fasting is to move you it is to humble ourselves in such a way that we would be able to do exactly what god would have us to do here what he would want us to hear and when we don't know a decision we got a decision that's weighing on us we don't know what to do and we don't seem to be able to hear from god that's a great time to fast to pray to set yourself aside hide in him in him amen but fasting is not to move god fasting is to get you out of the way to get me out of the way if you want to see god move you pick up his word you start slinging it like a sword and believe it with everything you've got and god is duty-bound and obligated to move on behalf of that word you talk about rallying him off the throne you just let a little old believer it doesn't have to be a mighty giant just let it be the weakest christian get down on his or her knees and take god and his word and i want you to know angels stand at attention you want to move god off his throne do something like that the angels will start reporting and saying hey there's been a change in that little one there's been a change in your little daughter your son over there is taking authority that he's been forfeiting too long that'll get god moving your job is not to move god anyway your job is just to to discover what god would have you to do and get right in the middle of that and how do we get there we get there like brother greeley prayed this morning this is how we get there that we just say in earth in earth even as it is in heaven in earth even as it is in heaven and you can say in earth even as it is in heaven but i want you to know this is the earth that god's most concerned about you and i he made us from the earth he's most concerned about us are you here i believe you are for a few minutes so i got to hurry because i don't want to lose you in a message called the greatest battle ever fought what kind of a message about warfare would be complete without visiting that sermon it's really the bride's anthem i don't even know if there's a more important message for some of you to hear right now than the greatest battle ever fought because you're involved in that battle and you ought to know what it is you ought to know how to navigate the greatest battle ever fought and you ought to discover how to win it because i want to tell you that every devil in hell will tell you that it is not winnable but the word of god said you can win this battle you can overcome no matter how the battle is raging now do you know we've had wars after wars thank you ladies and rumors of wars and if the earth stands we'll have plenty more wars but do you realize that there's really only two powers in all the universe so i don't think communism is one of those two powers it's a part of one of those powers but if you want to know what the real battle and the real war is about he's about to tell us he said but do you realize that there is really only two powers in all the universe of all our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything it all mounts up to two powers put your finger right there a moment i don't have the the message quotes to give you but i was reading this week where brother branham was talking about the national spirit and what kind of a spirit germany has what kind of a spirit finland has what kind of a spirit the united states of america has don't you be satisfied by only carrying a national spirit it's possible to be patriotic and not carry a national spirit [Music] come on now you can be patriotic as an american without living under the influence of the spirit of america and she has one brother branham said even a church has a spirit and a pastor has a spirit he said sometimes you'll see a pastor jerk his head a certain way in the congregation we'll do the same that's not what it's going to take you're going to have to have more than an american spirit and more than a church spirit and more than a pastor spirit we're going to have to be sold out to the holy spirit and so this is not about persons or personalities it's not about the differences that we have with each other we're not all going to be just the same i'm not going to collect the things that you like some of you people like things that i don't like and i like things that you don't like not just food but a lot of preferences we have in life and some are not satisfied until everybody likes what they like now i want you to know that ain't going to do us any good in this hour everybody knows that kimchi is good you see all the deniers all of you living in denial anybody ought to know well can i say it this way it's good for you i had a few more supporters i like it every time i eat rotten cabbage i want you to know if you've never had any of miss stephanie's kimchi you need to schedule you a massage about the time she's making kimchi because i'm telling you she brings me a big old sack and when i take i haven't had it in quite a while but when i take that home the whole refrigerator if you don't tie it up real good the whole house will smell one time i was in the apartment in iceland brother eric was with me and sister christine had brought us kimchi and it was my job to heat up the meal that had been prepared for us and because you know eric didn't really know his way around the kitchen too much he he liked to say he did but i found out he was better in the microwave than he was anything else but i came out of there with the heated up food and he was happy to have all that i came out with some kimchi and he said that is the most awful foul smelling stuff that i've ever smelt in my life he said would you he was so serious he said would you please go into the bedroom to eat your lunch he didn't like it some of you don't like it i like it my idea is the more there's more for me if you don't like it there's more for me to have we are not all gonna like the same thing some of you are star wars fans i'm not some of you like i don't know we could just go up down the line uh there's a lot of things we don't have to get to the place where everything about us is just the same but what we need to recognize is it's the enemy who likes to magnify and amplify the differences among us instead of the similarities the holy ghost wants to anoint and magnify and amplify the things that we stand together on the enemy wants to blow everything else out of proportion [Applause] so that he gets more attention than the holy ghost i'm going to start calling names to make sure you're with me this morning i feel a little boldness here we need that sometime he said there's only two powers there's only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms all the rest the little minor things i'm going on now the minor things are connected with either one of those powers and those powers is god's power and satan's power now don't you forget that brother branham told us that the only power that satan has is the power we give him you don't believe that if you believe that you might not be as quick to blame him but you might search your heart and see where you are opening a door or keeping a door open to empower him to do what he's doing now this is for everybody you take your part this is for everybody if if the enemy is wreaking havoc you gotta find out why you have to find out sometime where is the open door where is the leaky cistern where is that weak place where am i allowing the enemy to stomp all over my emotions because otherwise he's just a tool in the hand of god to perfect the saints if you believe that same man he said that's what every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by god's power or satan's power because that's the only two powers there is and that is the power of life and the power of death now that's the only two powers if you believe that same man not three not four and a half two powers god's power satan's power everything else that moves among us is under the auspice of one of those powers it's either the working of god's power or the working of satan's power when we recognize this we should be able then to deal with him when he comes now one more here the third exodus i don't have any new scriptures now i only have a few quotes that i've never brought to you before most of them are going to be things that we have heard before but i'm asking you to give it your attention this morning perhaps in a way that you haven't in the past in paragraph 154 he said now remember there's only two don't forget this there's only two powers one is spiritual power of the holy spirit the other one is the devil [Music] he classifies the holy spirit as god's power and he puts underneath that the subtitle or subcategory spiritual power so god's power is holy spirit power and holy spirit power is spiritual power he said the other one is the devil working through don't miss the subtitle don't miss the sub category how does the devil work with his power he works it through intellectual power education is not of the enemy it can be hijacked and used for the enemy you can educate yourself right out of the spiritual life amen but it doesn't hurt you to have an education if you stay close to the lord if that becomes your number one goal in life you're going to miss what god has for you you're going to be an educated dummy when it comes to the things of the spirit there are too many educated dummies in the church world very very smart on many many many things but not practical enough to understand how the enemy is using them now god help us to understand what is motivating us this is not a time to sleep this is not a time to miss what god might say to you because there is a battle raging and it's broad but we win he said for that's where he entered in the garden of eden through intellectual conception or through intellectual powers to make eve believe in intellectual conception against the word just as plain as it can be the kids could get that see see and that's the way it's been all the way down had eve not have yielded to the intellectual interpretation of the serpent she would not have needed a covering because jesus god was already her covering but she needed adam because she yielded herself to intellectual conception and she was made to doubt ultimately that god is good and that he's for you and not against you it's one of the hardest messages to get people even around the message to embrace in this hour is that god is for you many of us still have a denominational or pentecostal or holiness conception of a god who gets up every morning ready to smoosh you like an ant he would not his kingdom that way he needs you somebody say i don't believe god needs anybody god said he did he needs a yielded vessel he needs somebody to work through satan needs somebody to work through it's not likely he's going to take a form and walk in here himself this morning but he will look for a form to work through he'll work through me he'll work through you and if we're not on the job if we're not very very alert in hours like this we'll find ourself fighting on the wrong side we'll find ourself advancing the wrong team hello brother sister you want to make sure that what you say in here what you do in here what you do in community with each other you do it to glorify god to advance the vision of this house because that's why god has you here come on now that's why you're here and we thank god for you in the first seal i'm reading this this morning i'm preaching this this morning well you're just quoting right now yeah i'm going to let all the blame go right on back to where this star this truth started brother random's got broad shoulders i know why some won't preach the message they don't want to be called an accountability for what the message says i am i'm willing i'm willing i'm not ashamed of original sin i'm not ashamed that god is one i'm not ashamed that talking in tongues is not the initial evidence of the holy ghost i'm not ashamed that that baptism christian baptism is in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm not ashamed to stand on those things because i know that this is truth it's not a truth anybody with me it's the truth the truth is going to stand when the world's on fire so we were singing megan was singing are you still with me sister megan was singing and uh me i don't remember if everybody was helping her on that one or not but she was single the battle is raging what's the next line huh the battle is raging the devil is raging i don't want to be sleeping when the battle is raging and they were also singing what's the other song david you all were singing praise him for the victory and we got a shofar blowing and i almost started slinging the sword but that's heavy that thing's heavy there was war it was praise war it was worship war it i love that line worship drives him out of his mind what does praise do praise gets him confused some of you if you were to start praising the lord you'd confuse us we wouldn't know what he got ahold of you when a believer praises with everything he's got it confuses the enemy the jews believe that the sound of the shofar is such a powerful voice that god speaks through the sound of the shofar in a language that satan cannot interpret and praise operates that way and worship drives him out of his mind and sometimes we get criticism so i had a few criticisms and they said i i just would like to mention that you all sure do a lot of warring and a lot of fighting somebody's on the devil's radar [Music] well don't you know brother branham said that true seed forgive me i'm gonna i just don't want to make fun of people but i want to laugh at the at the spirit of stupid that gets on some folks i know you don't like it they don't like it when i say jehovah's sneaky either but it is a it is it's it's a stupid statement people get carried away in in in their stupid ways sometime you're doing a lot of war and you're doing a lot of fighting we know that if you don't have a battle to fight there's no challenge there's no conflict something is just wrong if the devil's not after you something's wrong if he's not trying to afflict you something's wrong if he's not trying to stop you something's wrong i just wrote back and said we not only have to war for what the enemy wants to do in our own congregation but because so many of you don't even know there's a battle going on we have to war on your behalf we have to take up the challenge of the bride [Music] and sometimes press through believing god for breakthrough in your cemetery [Music] i'm not going to apologize [Music] for the fact that we don't sing three dead dry crusty songs and call it breakthrough worship remember every church is sovereign and the pastor is the highest spiritual authority in that church i'm just quoting i'm just quoting and so if you don't do it that way where you are i understand but there is a battle raging who wants to be found sleeping when the devil is raging i love the lines of that song we don't fight as one who shadow boxes [Music] that's what it means we don't fight as one who beats the air we know where the target is we know who the enemy is and we know the only way to defeat him is by the word of god and the only way to create an atmosphere to use the word as it's properly used is through praise and worship to get the atmosphere all cleaned out there's no need for you to go walk around the boundaries of this property and seal it with the blood of jesus as long as there's demon spirits on this property well you're just sealing them in all right it's going to get tough here in a minute there has to be a cleansing first now i'm using i'm using this place as an example but that's not that wasn't what i was dealing with this week we were dealing with some friends of ours who are experiencing unusual forms of witchcraft one that's very familiar to me i don't understand them all i haven't dealt with them all but some are familiar to me and this particular form of witchcraft is familiar to me and so in a desperation to try to find out what we can do to seal this thing off and to send these harassing demon spirits they were identified to me as harassing spirits that did not have the power to kill neither did they have the power to inflict pain all they have the power to do is harass and to hijack a root that's already present in someone's heart and so that's how the enemy harasses now there's other there's ranks and we know there's divisions in the in the in darkness just like there is in the kingdom of light we know that there are ranks and different divisions of angelic hosts the bible seems to teach us this and if that's so then there are also ranks of authority etc in the in the darkness and and most of the time we think we're really fighting i want to be honest with you most of the time we think we're fighting you know the prince of alabama and all we're really dealing with is those little spirits that have no power to do anything unless you're already in the middle of it don't act like you don't know what i'm talking about what they do is they find somebody who has a problem with authority carried it all of their life that demon can't put that on you he doesn't have the power to plant that spirit in you or that root in you all he does is he has the power to come fertilize it and blow on it and utilize it so that he so the enemy gets all the attention he didn't give you that you you're like me you've carried things in your life those little spirits come and don't you think they don't know what's being said this morning those little spirits will come and really all they can do is harass mock stir so you let somebody that's already prone to temper already prone to a little bit of jealousy already prone to a little bit of bitterness already be pro i don't know what to name you a little bit of religion that's already in them can't blame it all on satan some of it is just the way of life we've picked up things because we nursed what we should have murdered we kept alive what we should have killed come on we kept in our house what we should have driven into the wilderness [Music] so the enemy comes and he blows on and he anoints it and he uses it you know i'm you know what i'm talking about this is no this is not new to some of you people you know that uh you that have had problems of rejection or daddy issues or whatever el mama issues or whatever else you have you know the devil didn't put that in you just the shape of your life what you've experienced all part of god's plan that's where it usually gets quiet all part of god's plan don't you don't you try to tell me there's an enemy out there that's stronger than the god who created him don't you tell me his plan is is more executable than the plan of god for your life no no no no no all the things that god uses to mold us and shape us but we leave a little something unhealed on whole undealt with sometimes we adopt it as our identity and without that we're nobody remember if some people didn't have arthritis they wouldn't be nobody there's no need to call them john or or sally you could just call them who they are arthritis my arthritis my condition what i've been through we own those things until we become those things and then the enemy you you let witchcraft be at least are you listening you let witchcraft get stirred up like it is right now and what that what them little imps will do those little little harassers what they do is they will come and take advantage of those things that you're carrying and they'll make them look bigger than they've ever looked before and they'll make you feel so hopeless and they'll make you feel smothered and they'll make you feel panicked and they'll make you feel like you can't breathe come on that's exactly what they do and if you and i can recognize this ain't a new devil this ain't the prince of the power over alabama this ain't the highest devil in the united states this is just harassing spirit tormenting devils from hell that have come to take advantage of what i've been through in life that i didn't deal with and they magnify and amplified anointed and stir it up and cause it to get lots of attention so that the enemy is lifted up and jesus sits in the corner with dirty feet this is how the enemy works and he can't always work this way just in church entity but he sure can get in a community of bride and do everything he can to keep us focused on all the wrong things when we need to be focusing on the right things you don't have to say amen i've made it without your amen so far but it is the truth so i had to answer this and i didn't want to do it in the wrong spirit and i had to let him know that this message is truth it is the truth and if there is a spiritual war to be had in the world it's going to be had around this message the truth can anybody see why the enemy would hate it if it is the truth don't you see why the enemy would try to sabotage it and try to make you read some website somewhere that brother branham was a false prophet the truth is you don't understand it so shut up that mean it didn't mean to be mean the fact is you don't understand it so shut up well i don't know if there was really that many people fell off the bridge shut up i wasn't there either what are we going to do about the brown bear shut up that's what i'm going to do i'm not asking you to do anything i'm not going to do if i don't understand it i'm going to leave it with the one who said it but i'm not going to let a scarecrow that the devil hangs on the www i'm not going to let the devil keep me from the best strawberries in the patch because he hangs a scarecrow out there and tries to have some of your loved ones tell you you're in a cult you gotta make up your mind i didn't i didn't get in this thing to run from scarecrows i'm going to knock them right out of my way and find those strawberries because if there's going to be any fat birds sitting up on the line i'm going to be one of them fat birds gerald miller who was an editor of the magazine that followed the brownsville revival it was a magazine written and distributed across the whole world he interviewed paul keith and i one time about our association with brother branham what we believed about brother branham and he came here to one of our meetings one time and he wrote an article and in that article he wrote about those uh he wrote you want to check that he he wrote in his article uh about this story and about the strawberries and he said when i hear them preacher talk i just see them two fat birds upon the line let's eat all the strawberries because they weren't afraid of the scarecrows you see all the other little birds out there skinning because they let all the all the the websites and all the dissenters and all the skeptics the ones who throw around well that didn't come to pass that didn't come to pass that didn't come to pass i have them you have them whether you know it or not they get together not too far from this place they get together and they rehearse some of those things i wish they were as faithful to rehearse the things that god has already kept as they are to try to celebrate the things that haven't come to pass but the whole truth is this if you don't understand it you ought to shut up [Applause] because it's just like the scripture tells us you don't want to find yourself fighting against something that god has ordained it's up to him to bring his word to pass i'm not here i know it's i'm going to get off of this because it sounds like we're being defensive and that's not that is not i want to defend the message of truth i want to defend the truth that's what i want to offend i'm not here to defend this church it's got a lot of problems you want to see some of them look around because where people gather problems come you ever find the perfect church stay here you ever go out there and find a perfect church stay here we wouldn't want to muddle up what they've got right you wouldn't want to take your own imperfect self over there and mess up what they've been working for there's no such thing when you've got people together you're going to get all the bumps and warts skin tags all the things that come yes you are but we're not looking at the problem we're not looking at the differences we're looking to find what unifies us and what makes us one and what makes us one is we've been called to a word we've been called to a person and his name is not brother branham his name is the lord jesus christ and his word is going to stand when the whole world is on fire we're going to honor the messenger we're going to honor the man of god who gave the who gave the message who yielded his life and sacrificed so much i hate to tell you he wasn't perfect he wasn't perfect he said he wasn't perfect he said he made thousands of mistakes somebody sent me this week a question with a picture of brother branham standing there with his family and his daughters in little miniskirts practically and they said we get asked this question all the time how is it that a mighty prophet of god like that would let his daughter stand there with those short skirts on i'm just glad sister mita had a little longer one on that sunday because she had a tendency to it's kind of a fashion in that day fad you could see a little more of their legs than you needed to and some people use that as though they're going to discredit the ministry that god gave brother branham because there were things that he didn't catch don't be quiet in here now there's no dual there's no dual purpose in this what i'm saying this is just for the purpose intended to let you know that he was not a perfect man if he hadn't been a perfect man he would have sent that daughter right back in if he'd have seen it if he'd have seen it he'd have sent that daughter right back in and said it's time you're getting old enough now to cover your knee you're getting old enough now maybe that day they won't wear them to the ankles like i prefer but that is nothing i don't take it somebody said well you know the prophet had a christmas tree and the prophet did this and the prophet did that i want you to know something i'm not called to answer for him i'm only called to answer for me and as a pastor i'm called here to answer for you when i can sometimes there's no answer but when i can i will i'm more than willing to do that but i want you to know there's always an enemy out there that wants to discredit everything that you hold dear don't you let it i got to move on i want to read this in the first seal i want you to know why there's such a war raging it's 113 i need a little more time paragraph 63 notice what happens as we go along here is the plan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first what happens a seal is opened that's powerful what is that a mystery is unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds can somebody tell me what the trumpet sound does it declares a war the war is raging the message has caused a war to rage the revelation of jesus christ has disturbed the atmosphere and there is a war raging because of great precious truth that has broken into the earth he said a plague falls and the church age opened see are you with me he said what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god can't linger on this line too long or they'll accuse us of something else the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed anybody see that but when he does he catches the mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him that's exactly what our prophet did all right he goes on you you're here good praise the lord he begins to proclaim that message it goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim that message and when does it start a war a spiritual war are you really gonna text me and email me and ask me why so many of our songs last sunday were about war you're really gonna ask me that and you've got the answer right in front of you when truth is declared and when truth is decreed and when truth breaks out in the earth and breaks forth in the earth it causes a disturbance in the atmosphere that has been going now decade after decade after decade and what you sense now is not a new battle what you sense now is not a new war it's the same old war that's being amplified on the battlefield [Music] of the mind if you understand that say amen in the message testimony raising the dead boy this is page two i have ten ten or 11 pages i won't get to them because i want to make sure that you don't get so weary that you miss what's already been said testimony the racing of the dead boy in 1953 in florida paragraph 14. you've got to get you've got to go do it you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have why are y'all singing so many songs about war because not even a single solitary inch is going to fall into your lap without a battle every blessing you get there's going to be a war there's going to be a battle there's going to be an opposition to keep that out of your life you're going to have to fight for every inch of ground that you have you're going to have to make sure that you're able to deal with all of your stuff and stay out from under everybody else's stuff so that you can keep pressing toward the mark because if you don't you will be waylaid you will be off to the side and you will not find the strength that you need to overcome in this last hour he said you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the spirit of god knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground tow the mark with satan lined up you look over there to see who's running against you you are toe toed up with satan he is towing the mark right next door to you isn't that right friends this is not a picnic [Music] pretty sure i had that underlined and bolded there but you can see it this is not a picnic this is a battleground see we never come here somebody said well it's a tabernacle no he's preaching in west palm beach florida he's preaching in a perhaps auditorium i don't know church or an auditorium but it's a holy ghost meeting and people are gathered there in the name of the lord and he said we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle there's not always time to give you your bottle somebody ought to say man there's not always time to pet you it's just a fact we didn't come here this morning to eat cookies we came here to fight a battle not about flesh and blood not about people not about personalities not about differences that we have with one another not about the fact that you're not smart enough to know how delicious kimchi is there's no battle over that we're not here to fight over things that don't matter [Music] i'm gonna fight listen let me tell you something i'm gonna fight for souls i'm gonna fight for families i'm gonna fight for lives i'm gonna fight for my children and if you'll get out of my way i'll fight for your children this is a battle it rages [Applause] we're going to have to make a stand now last weekend god did some things for us just like he did at camp meeting just like he has time and time and time and time and time again i'm supporting it i tell you god sent brother dwayne jackson here to preach for us and i have come long enough on this journey that i don't let it hurt my feelings when you amen on your feet clapping your hands over things i have said for years and years in you you say why'd you mention it because i want you to know that i ain't a dummy and i know where the transcripts are and it does not it does not because it's a five-fold ministry [Music] [Applause] now the truth is i was asked to preach the banquet and i said absolutely not i want somebody fresh i want somebody that'll come in here and help the young people brother dwayne had never preached a youth meeting he had never preached a a youth banquet he'd been involved in youth banquets but never preached one but something dropped it in our hearts that he was the one for the job and was he oh he was when i left here tuesday when i left the pulpit tuesday night and i went back there i looked glanced down at my phone and brother jackson and sister brother dwayne and sister heather had been streaming the service tuesday night and weeping brother greeley said he was blubbering they had been weeping and rejoicing and praising the lord because so many times an evangelist will come and preach and never know the fruit that's why we try to i've always tried to text and tell them some of the things that we hear that god has done but nothing could have the effect and not only that he told me he'd listen to it again and not only that some of you have told me you went back and watched it again i've got about halfway through i've got the other half to get through but i've listened again to about another half of it and i cried at the same places i cried tuesday night and i rejoiced at the same places that i rejoiced tuesday night because i know it was sovereign and i know man didn't do it and i know you didn't do it and i know brother jackson didn't do it i know i didn't do it but i know god did but i want to bring a balance for you this morning and i want you to know he has before he has before and our leaky cisterns this is not to condemn no this is not even to whip this is not even to correct as a pastor this is to try to inspire i have to tell the reality of the truth so that you can be inspired to understand how powerful it is what you're holding in your hands this morning is more valuable and more powerful than what you realize because you are holding keys for next weekend and the next weekend and the next weekend we cannot wait until we have a special series of meetings to get excited about the truth but we must recognize that a snowball is rolling a holy one i'm going to say a fireball i can't hardly compare the spiritual to snow there's a fireball that's been rolling and like a snowball it just gains and gains and gains and gains and gains as long as it keeps moving [Music] but as soon as it stalls as soon as something doesn't go your way and you come in here mad at your wife upset with your husband disturb because of what you saw on facebook and get off of it if it moves you that emotionally get off of it don't let that steal your joy don't let that be the reason that you sit down when god wants you to stand up come on now i'm telling you what we have a pregnant moment our young people have a pregnant moment right now i don't want somebody's temper to flare on a volleyball court i don't want somebody smack talk i don't want somebody feeling like you didn't support my event i don't want anything to rise up among us that would impede slow down stall that rolling pillar of fire that is moving through this place last sunday morning burning out shaft and causing people to get above the things that have disturbed them for so long i don't know how many people come to me and say oh i wish that was better i wish that could get better i wish things could be different i wish things could be better i just wish that everybody got along i just wish that it wasn't like this i wish we could have unity let me tell you something there's a key get your eyes off the obvious get your eyes on jesus [Applause] leave your bottle at home don't you be guilty of putting a bottle to your neighbor's mouth in here don't you be guilty of petting somebody when they're wrong or sympathizing with them when they're yielding to demons you make up your mind let it blow let it go whatever comes it's my responsibility to keep the fire burning on the altar you you not just mine it's our responsibility to make sure that the ball keeps rolling and i don't mean emotionally i don't mean we got to keep each other pumped up emotionally i mean a desire and it ain't going to be easy some of you proved that when you came in this morning it ain't going to be easy because life happens and i've been actively involved as others have in helping deal with some of the witchcraft that's trying to harass a servant of god who's fighting for his life and it is not easy and it's not just an extra little prayer that gets the job done it's warfare it's absolute warfare [Music] and we need a people to to be sensitive to what the spirit of god is doing because in the middle of this battle i recognized that the same kind of harassing spirits operate here and we must make up our mind that even if the battle is raging jesus is going to be glorified in this house and we're going to take our sides with the word we're going to notify our face and our expression and our worship when we come to glorify the name of the lord and then and then maybe there will not be people from the outside who send notes and emails and text and say you you your everyone is clear is not with you and for you because we're streaming the service and we can see that there are people that are angry with you when you're trying to preach and even this week somebody sinned and said people rolling their eyes when you're speaking about supernatural things well i won't tell you something if people out there can recognize it and you cannot recognize it then we got a big problem and if that is truly going on and i have no reason to doubt it is it is simply because we've allowed the enemy to magnify our differences we've not cheered for one another like we should cheer for one another and it breaks down the atmosphere and it makes it harder to move forward with momentum i realize this gets close to home i realize that this touches families i realize it touches people that we love because we love every person in this room but somebody eventually is going to have to make a stand and i'm going to have to make that stand we've got to find how the enemy is able to keep the same old thing stirring and stirring and stirring and stir it and we've got to be able to deal with that because the battle that's raging is bigger than this little house it's a spiritual war that's going on across the world and the bride of christ is the target of an assassination attempt and the enemy would like to take you out [Applause] that don't have to happen that don't have to happen you can praise your way to victory you can get your eyes off of one another and get your eyes on jesus christ you can discover today you can find out today if you're carrying a spirit and you don't know it you can find out today you don't have to go another day trying to figure out if you're carrying a spirit we're not on a picnic now i'm going to close in a minute or two i want to because i'm getting pretty you know it sounds kind of rough and rugged and that's not what i'm here for but i am here to let the enemy know now i'm sick and tired i'm sick and tired we can turn our heads and pretend like there's not some there's problems and god is the only one who can solve the problem but you must be careful where you stand here's a here's a message that really stirs my heart anyway it's the message christianity versus idolatry god give me this verse to go with it second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices listen satan's not he's not the problem this morning i don't want you to think that anybody in this house i believe satan everybody in here even these visitors i've already come to love them you're god's children you're the people of god it's time we were acting like it but we're the people of god this is not a flesh blood battle this is a holy ghost spiritual battle for those of you that don't believe a woman can get anointed to testify don't you dare go back and listen to tuesday night's service because you can get anointed to testify there's just one problem sister april you pay a price later and you will if you haven't already you'll pay a price because what you were warring against is not people not flesh not blood but spirits no one could have said it better than someone from that generation who lived the glory who saw the fire who saw what god was doing even though they're critics who say they're just trying to prop up something that's already oh no if it's that close to collapse and let it fall if it's that fragile let it fall i was out on the road you know preaching the pentecostals and charismatics and everywhere i was going there say the church is dying the church is dying and they wanted us to try to breathe life into the church that was dying i said oh no let her die sometimes the leaders would say i don't know if you ought to say that or not because people are pretty sensitive about their church and you get up and tell people just let her die i said if she's built on man she's destined to die and until she dies jesus can't raise up his church come on now if this church is built on the on the personality of brother shelley it'll have to die it'd come as close to death in 97 as i thought it could ever come because god was dealing with some of those things but if this church today is built on my personality it needs to die right down to the root so that jesus can come and establish his work in our midst because he's perfect preachers ain't people's ain't pastors ain't but he is so don't you think that i'm busy trying to prop up something that god may want to bring to a change i want transformation from the pulpit to the back door i want a youth movement going on in this house that not that replaces the seniors but revives the seniors this was the cry this was the cry that april was giving us tuesday night we she said we need you we need this because some are battle-weary too intricately intimately involved familiar we need you we need you we need something going on i observe some things i'm not calling names it was good but i don't want to call names but i observe some things by streaming back the service of sunday morning and i caught some people from the back because you're on you know i don't want to make you feel nervous but you are on camera the world is seeing you you're gonna have a hard time denying that you haven't tried to stop what god desired to do a time or two and i'm looking all over this congregation because we've all been guilty we didn't feel good we had our nose out of joint like i said we had fussed with their wives the children had we'd yelled at the children god will forgive you honey i've been with them that's not the way to do it but god's not gonna throw you out when you get to where you just can't take no more on you to say they used to say i used to know some people up in the valley and they used to tell her children if you don't stop i'm gonna knock you to five points my mama used to say if you don't shut your mouth i'm gonna knock you into tomorrow we're not abusing our children we're big threats you know there's a right way to discipline our children in the wrong way and mistreating them is not the right way and abusing them is not the right way and picking up whatever you can get your hand on is not the right way and discipline them and not telling them why they're in trouble and what they can do different is not the right way that won't work it's a it's a full commitment because you got to go through the whole thing sometime come on now don't you allow whatever you're carrying in your life to follow you in here to such an extent that you squash your chance you know what happens most of the time you're afraid you your brother says maybe you got to set your wife wife god several husbands or children or you're afraid to worship the lord you're embarrassed to praise the lord because you know the family knows the conflict that you've had all the way over here it's a good thing some of you don't live too far away you don't have too much time to fuss and fight and fume against one another and you come in here and you're thinking oh i wish i could apologize oh i wish i could set that straight don't you tell me i'm the only one that's ever had that oh i wish i could make that right oh i wish i i i'm a good of mine just to take my wife out right now in the middle of the service and say honey i was wrong i'm so sorry i let that happen there are so many times that people come in here and they're fighting that kind of condemnation and they won't even try to enter in and so you say well i'll get that straightened out and by the next time i come i'll have my victory again folks we ain't got time we don't have time for that there may be somebody sitting next to you whose soul is hanging in the balance see if you don't care that don't mean everybody doesn't care somebody cares somebody come out to this place this morning because they wanted help i don't know why you're inviting people i don't know why jesse got invited i don't know why david's invited i don't know why rachel's invited i don't know why some of you invited people here but i assume you invited them because you hoped that a difference could be made in their life so you don't want to bring them into a house where so many people have their nose out of joint with what all they've been going through that they're coming here pouting and create a rotten atmosphere instead of a holy atmosphere you don't have to be a hypocrite you don't have to run out in the aisle you don't have to jump you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do but the least thing you could do is show a right spirit when you come into god's house and if you can't come in here and show a right spirit i have very little use for you i'll just be completely honest because it's not too much to ask of anybody to come with the right heart and a right spirit and to promote and to produce and to multiply let something ooze out of you besides a mule nature because i want you to know that old mule of hee-haw and he can make racket and so forth but he has no intention of doing what the word said but god's got a thoroughbred people he's got thoroughbreds that come under the influence and act like he-haul sometime but they just get their course corrected because they realize if i can't do it for myself if i don't care let me care for somebody that does care [Applause] what kind of a man would want to see his wife drug down buried down weighed it down because he is what kind of a wife would want her husband to be under alone that he couldn't break free of because she was what kind of a parent would want a child to be oppressed critical bitter because they are it seems to me like you and i need to get ourselves out of the way and we need to remember that some folk really need a breakthrough where do you find it by responding to the word where do you find it by gathering in the presence of god around the altar and crying out to the lord where do you find it by lifting your hands into the air and pouring out your heart to god god you know i don't feel like this you know i don't feel like doing this with every fiber of my being i don't even want to be here but i'm here for somebody else would you help me to get above all of my stuff and touch your throne christianity versus idolatry paragraph 79 he said that's right you've got to know the word stay on the word see the great battle is at hand now we've played church for years and years but the hour has come now that when jamborees and janice will withstand moses as the bible said they would and it's going to be what so you speak ignorantly when you go around and say things like i wish we could just all get along i wish we could just all look look folk that ain't the key we're not planning thanksgiving dinner that's when you need to all get along that's not what we're dealing with here we're dealing with something a thief who wants to cheat us and rob us out of every prophecy and every vision and every promise that god has made to us and the enemy wants you to train your attention and focus on people that's the problem people are not the problem the enemy this is a raging battle and the battle's bigger than just having good services are you with me this is what disturbs me the most i'm going to read this this is what disturbs me the most he said it's going to be spiritual battle conflict there will be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into domination and go on the way it goes i'm just telling you what a prophet said seems to me like it's right tattoo parlors in the church coffee shops and all those things that draw people and entertain them big old hang up a big buy a big old cooler in the youth so they can have all the soda pop they want and all the things they do to pull people get all this messed up music they sing we gotta appeal we gotta draw let me tell you something that denominational world is just going to keep moving on they're going to keep making their growth and their their mega church and they're just going to keep right on doing it little churches like this are going to be condemned because we're not a part of the social justice movement because we're not a food bank and because we don't do this and because we don't do that and that's because the denominational church believes that every church is the same and they all should have the same commission and they all should do the same thing and that is not the commission of this place that is not what god called us to if he should open doors for us to do any of that we are i'm willing and i believe there are willing people here but god told us to feed the bride that's what we're trying to do if you'll help us we can do it a whole lot easier and we can't maybe feed them all we can go beyond this house he's given us the grace to be able to do that that's right i know this has been a little bit tough he said it's going to be a spiritual battle a conflict there will be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into domination and go on the way it goes but i mean the real true believer is coming to that battlefield and you hadn't better be versed and know what you're doing you better know church look at me please you better know what you're doing you don't want to run out into a battle and not know what you're doing because it's possible that the enemy would strip you naked and hand your clothes back to you you want to know what you're doing when you run out into the battlefield when you're dealing with witchcraft when you're dealing with the demonic you want to know what you're doing these are spirits that have tried to take us out for years and it doesn't matter how much we wished it were not so we would love for it not to be true the truth remains that the enemy he doesn't take his spirit he sometimes changes his tool remember what brother braham said in the in the holy side god may take his man but he leaves his spirit it works the same way when an enemy is dispossessed that spirit does not just go away and hide it looks to find another vessel to work through he changes his mask through the years he's used women he uses men he uses all good precious people those of you who are afraid to amen your cowards i'm telling you right now this morning if you know i'm speaking the truth and you won't put an amen to it you're under a cowardly spirit why don't you let the enemy know it's not people why don't you let the enemy know where you're going to stand there are youth they're young people at stake souls at stake deliverances that need to take place now and what does the enemy do just changes his mask he'll just change his v he'll keep doing it too until you make up your mind i'm not going to be used why don't if everybody in this house we could solve it all if everybody in this house would sincerely repent this morning and say i'm not going to be used to disturb the atmosphere of a service anymore i repent of any part that i have played in that and i'm going to ask the lord to let me be an asset to this church instead of a constant dream i'm going to ask the lord to let me give it's vital it's vital let me finish this quote he said but i mean the real true believers come into the battlefield you're there you're there whether you want to be or not musicians are coming please and you had better be versed and know what you're doing i was about to make a bad mistake this week the cry had gone out would you get some folks together and come and walk the property line of our our house our place our property here and and pray over all these harassing things that are taking place and my heart was actively engaged in the battle and i know that that i've had to do that before and you have to how many of you have ever had to take authority over your own home did the spirits come back if they did we let them because the same one that had power to cause them to leave to make them leave is the one that has the power to guard the door and keep them out be careful what you watch be careful what you pull in be careful what you listen to be careful what you read be careful what you say about other people because all of these things create an environment for the enemy to thrive instead of the holy ghost to thrive i've allowed the enemy to intimidate me about something that i do know a little something about and that's deliverance and i've stayed off the subject because every time i do it stirs the enemy and it causes other people not to know where to stand but we have come to a place now where we got to get this thing right because we got a snowball or a fireball or a momentum or whatever you want to call it and i want to see somebody running along behind it with a finger saying r roll on roll on let's give the devil no space let's give him no room let's everyone repent that's all just repent and get it over with you it would make a world of difference oh it sounds like it's a rough place around here just on occasion it's not what i meant but i mean the real true believers coming to that battlefield and you'd better be verse i was about to make a bad mistake because i was about to go seal in some tormenting spirits because i was going to walk that perimeter of that line the borders of that house that yard and i was going to apply the blood i believe we have authority to do so i was going to apply the blood and plead the name of jesus the blood of jesus and and get that all sealed in and i'd prayed so hard that day i'd i i would need i i just really needed to hear from god i needed to get me out of the way and i woke up that next morning and he started dealing with me he said you'd be trapping those harassing spirits you've got to make sure everything is cleansed and there's not an open door i believe that goes for this house i'm talking about something i dealt with for friends this week but i believe it goes for this house here we are trying to seal the perimeter in the border and yet if there's an open door if somebody's standing in the door and allowing those harassing spirits to come in and out and harass and do their little dirty works just it's just noise just noise that the enemy likes to make and so the lord said don't you do that i'll tell you what to say now i'm i'm not i'm i'm not an expert i've yielded the things that god's had to help me with but i know a little bit about deliverance i know a little bit about demon spirits and i've allowed myself to be a little intimidated at times because i know there are folks who think that there's a that i think because they've said it that there's a demon behind everything under every rock and i want you to know nothing could be further from the truth but it becomes the nature of of of a person to not want to see what the real root is and so you start trying to repair and you start hoping to make a difference and you start thinking if i do this it will send this message and this will help and this will cause this to happen and so forth and a month rocks on in months rock on in years rock on and nothing is any different because the problem has never really completely been dealt with and we know enough from the message of the hour somebody i've even had people say won't you just deal with that spirit why don't you just deal with that well we know enough about what brother branham taught us about deliverance that number one the person has got to recognize that they've yielded to something they've got to repent of that and be willing to make it right i'm telling you that is hard to do number one and number two you've got to make sure that that person is not making a god out of the very spirit that drives them because brother branham talked about the maniac [Music] and he said he worshipped that spirit now i don't believe anybody is going to bow down and say holy to a false spirit but what we will do is yield to that until it becomes our truth and it's the only truth we can hear and when we do that we give that demon a voice in our life that only prevents us from coming to pure deliverance this is what we must not let happen he said you'd better be versed and know what you're doing and i confess there are times i don't i almost made a mess this week are you listen you would better be versed and know what you're doing or you could take you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know this is the danger transference of spirits this is the danger if you try to stand between the word and the spirit you're keeping deliverance at bay if you'll get out of the way and let the holy ghost do the work those of you who have said i don't see no way for some things to ever be settled or ever be made right or ever be straightened out or ever be better than they are right now you're not giving much room for what the holy ghost can do you're not giving god much room to work seem to me like you may be putting the spirit between you and you seem to me like you may be putting a little more power on the spirit than you should let me tell you something god knows how he can deliver us he can take those who are insane and put them in their right mind then he sure can deal with harassing spirits because the lord showed me these these things are harassing spirits and they can only operate where there's a root they can't put something on us and if you get confused by what i'm saying i'll be glad to bring you another session on this and i can go through the scriptures and the quotes where brother branham talked about the difference in demon oppression and demon possession he was clear it's one thing to be oppressed by a demon from the outside it's another thing to be driven by a demon from the inside most believers who fall under the influence of a spirit are oppressed of a devil not possessed of a devil therefore the deliverance should actually be easier in the presence of repentance there's no reason why a believer should have to struggle for years to get free of an oppressing spirit brother branham dealt with these things in the in the uh prayer lines and hunter and i were searching trying to find some of the things that brother brown said because would you believe for instance one of the things that brother dwayne jackson preached to us about was depression well you know brother branham said very little about depression most of the time uh he was talking about the period of time he lived in the depression but he said tons of things about being pressed down oppressed nervous you're real nervous you just get yourself worked up into a hissy or a tether now god wants to set you free from that and that could have been a number of spirits anxiety depression or whatever could have been a number of things but brother branham simplified it and put them under pretty big categories because stress was not a word they used so much and depression was not a word they used so much but he gave us some very powerful instructions about the difference between demons operating in the physical dimension and demon spirits operating in the spiritual dimension the physical dimension take form like a familiar spirit will take form it will crea it will not create a form but it hijacks a form a witch can carry all kinds of demon spirits that can operate through that witch but a lot of what's accomplished for darkness is not accomplished by that that possesses that that woman or man but it's by the familiar that works with them because that familiar spirit can go here and there and everywhere it can move beyond physical walls and and and bodies and so forth it can change its form it can take on any any form that it can find it can get a hold of and those kind of spirits sometimes will spy does that sound too crazy spy and then go back and report to the person working the witchcraft things that that person would have no way of knowing and they use that knowledge that they have gained about you to make you think that it's the operation of a spiritual gift of intercession when it was nothing in the world but a familiar spirit spying out the land to see what needed to be told just enough to catch your attention so that you would yield to that thing you got victory you don't have to be a pawn you don't have to be upon in in the devil's uh business do you the real true believers come into that battlefield and you'd better be versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word and here's what i want to leave you with i i know this has been strange for some thank you this has i only have one motive in reading this quote and that's magnifying the truth i don't have any self-serving motive here at all god knows that but i want to read this needs to be read on occasion it needs to be read from time to time we need at times we need positive things spoken about the leadership of the church needs to be spoken sometime just to kind of balance things out but that's not particularly what this is about except that last little paragraph but paragraph 80 love one another above everything love one another i want you to know that if you see a need and you s you sacrifice your life to pray for that need that is a demonstration of love there are times that you may not be able to extend a physical manifestation of the love you feel for that person there'll be others who can but i want you to know this greatest thing that you can do for somebody who's in trouble or who needs help is pray for them and you will serve them better by praying god's perfect will be done instead of telling god what needs to be done because we can be a mile off 10 miles off love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say oh it's late now you're all one big great sweet group now but remember my warning satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target notice that notice that don't you misunderstand that quote because you can read right over that and miss it he didn't say bring somebody in and make them the troublemaker he said bring somebody in and make them the target the enemy will use whoever he can use and if you're already struggling with depression or already struggling with uncertainty or if you're already struggling with whether or not your call is from the lord you become vulnerable enough that the enemy can work his way it's it's really wrong it's it ought to make every one of us angry that the enemy takes such advantage of people when they're already in a struggling place but he does and the only thing you might be able to do is help them now by prayer don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target you see that he'll bring some critic or unbeliever we're reading on now in and set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy making him the target satan is with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it i think that'd be satan brother bannon may be talking about the man yielding to that and carrying that around tails around but i think that that the enemy the real enemy needs to always be satan we need to always see that he's the one that's trying to operate and he'll start through the church with it now let's read on one more time i think don't you take sides with it you will starve the spirit out if you leave it be if you don't have power to bring deliverance if you don't have power to help set somebody free if you don't have a voice if you don't have the opportunity to do something for them then call as little attention to that kind of a spirit as possible i wish to as a pastor i had that privilege but when you see the thing beginning to move from person to person to person then you have no choice but to do something about it don't take sides with it you can love people without building the spirit up in them feeding the spirit in them legitimate legitimizing the spirit that's in them you say to somebody like that i get your point i understand where you're coming from and you don't know what you've done you have no idea what you've really done you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another which we have not always been pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another. and here's what i said i i think it needs to be said sometime but i don't want to say it in a self-serving way and stay with your pastor it's important if you cannot stay with your pastor you are duty bound to find a pastor that you can stand with see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and cause and cause he's ordained of god to do so if you're a person who no longer believes that god can use me as your pastor then you have a decision to make and you need to make it my desire is to see this body strong and to see it intact come on now but according to the message of the hour it's vitally important i think that anybody who's worked in management i think anybody who's worked with a group of people under them or with them or on a leadership team will understand the importance of having a unified leadership moving forward with a goal and having a people behind you don't have to think everything your leadership does is right i can save you the scrutiny i'm more of a man than most when i mean that i don't just mean my weight i mean i struggle like every other human being struggles and if you're looking for my mistakes you won't have to have a microscope but here's something you do need to know i have stood the test of time i have caused this church to move forward toward the word i have praised the lord no matter who was singing no matter who was worshiping no matter who was preaching i have done my best to support and push this thing forward and i will continue to do that but you need to understand there is a battle raging and it is a spiritual battle it can only be dealt with in the spirit by the spirit somebody said surely you're not going to leave this out there on the internet i absolutely am because i haven't said anything here that couldn't apply to any other group of people i didn't even start out to preach about our local church only i started out to say that a battle is raging and you don't want to be caught up in the storm you want to be able to recognize those harassing spirits and shut them off or they will run you silly they will run you absolutely silly i want you to know there's victory in jesus there's a way out of every tight situation you may find yourself in there's a way to be free you don't have to be bound you don't have to be miserable you don't have to wither away spiritually you can press in to the fullness of all that the holy ghost has for you and he does i don't see anybody in this house that he doesn't have something for if you'll get yourself out of the way and press into him how do you know i haven't if you're worse off than you were a year ago today you tell me if you're heavier more burdened more miserable than you were two years ago you tell me somebody has a pardon that has been written out in your name and the blood of jesus christ has been shed to set you completely and totally free from that spirit i've seen that thing standing years back right over and there i saw that thing standing behind some of the young people of this church i'm going to tell you something when the enemy can come in a house of god like that and stand over us like that that's something that'll really get you anybody ever had your house broken into or your car broken into i don't well i we had a had a break-in in jerusalem we had a break in here uh what was that indiana oh when we went to the wedding and they busted the window out and uh they would have stolen all kinds of stuff but we didn't have a gun and and the people that come out said they were looking for guns to run in the drug drug trade there but they did bust the wind of the vehicle but people that have had someone going through their drawers at home their shelves and cabinets and stuff and and having people toss their stuff around they tell me that that's one of the most awful feelings you feel so violated that the enemy could come into your house when you're not there and go through your stuff like that and look over your underwear drawer looking for jewelry or whatever and you all were in your place when somebody broke well that'll make you want to whoop the devil come on now and that anger that kind of arises first fear and grief and all the different things and then an anger that says i tell you what you better be careful when you come the next time something rises up in you every one of us should have something like that a passion that rises up in us and says wait a minute enemy wait a minute you dirty devil you've messed with my life long enough you've twisted my emotions long enough you have perverted my reality long enough your lies have bombarded me long enough and i'm raising up to do something about it and i want to tell you something else every one of you that recognizes that the enemy would not only do that to you or to your family or to your home but also to your church you ought to rise up with all the passion you can muster turn every arrow you've got and now every air and every bullet we've got is in this word and turn every bit of that against the enemy and let him know no more no more we're not going to let this battle keep us from receiving everything we got let these young people that i mean i've seen not just heard testimony i've seen changes and differences in people's lives and all i want all i really want is to see you running behind the ball of fire keep running roll on roll on roll on roll on we don't want you to diminish there's an enemy here that would like to steal your praise there's an enemy there's an enemy in the earth that would like to keep you from praising the lord bind you up and steal your freedom steal your joy this is his intent this is what he's after [Applause] you have the power to say no more lead us in worship come on let's worship the lord for just a moment let's create an atmosphere where every one of us can say there's a battle raging but i know who the victory is oh it's jesus christ living inside of me living inside of the believer he's the victory he conquered death hell and the grave [Music] defeated you're defeated oh let's push this thing on let's run with momentum hallelujah i know this has been the heart's cry of of the of the uh mature seniors and believers in this church god would stir a revival in the young people we've done all we've known to do we brought somebody to help we prayed we prepared we gave we sacrificed and now it's time that we tend we tend it it's like josiah and luke yovich poking that fire the ashes a little bit letting a little oxygen catch under there i tell you it was not a pl it was not for pleasure started out being for pleasure it ended up being for warmth there was a lot of playing going on a lot of volleyball going on and if somebody would have forgotten us in the fire around the fire that knew what they were doing we'd have been colder than we were but somebody came back and poked around and i'm not going to mention david i give him a real hard time because what he thought he was doing to help i'm not sure i'm sorry david i'm not sure that was helping but i give you a for effort and the fact that you cared there was an old stump that sat out there for i don't know how long and we run out of wood and and luke just started splitting that big old stump he found a way to keep the fire fueled and the ember stoked and if you think a pastor and an associate pastor can do that alone if you think a worship leader can do that alone if you think musicians or a staff can do that alone we cannot it takes everybody doing something serving if you can't put something up you can help take it down if you can't help cook a pie you can help wipe the table when the pie is eaten there's something that everybody can do to make the best effort to keep this thing moving i remember one time there was a stirring among the young people and there was an older sister she wasn't really that old she was just married and had small some small children and some teenage children and we were having a we were having a uh uh uh an assembly for the school and uh we were talking and preaching a little bit about the youth and putting some it well it was a youth meeting and we were putting emphasis on the young people and that woman was walking through the back of the church and she heard the emphasis on the young people and it struck a place in her and made her jealous she later had to come and repent and say i let such a jealousy it seemed to me like you were lifting the young people up and putting the young people down i mean the young people out putting the old people down i said you no no no no no no no no i was lifting the young people up you're right i wasn't putting nobody down that's how you felt that's where you were that's how you'd already been feeling and somehow that over that'll come come on you and you thought that we were there to put the old people down not at all of course the ones that are older now wasn't older then that was years ago i could see how the enemy used what was already in that woman she thought we were having a rally against the seniors and we were just preaching about a generation that were ordained to go all the way and i want you to know something that seniors in this church have the right spirit and let me tell you what they would tell you tonight today or this afternoon or whatever it is if you listen to them here's what they would tell you you march toward that victory you go with everything you've got and don't you let nothing hold you back and if something happens to me along the way they would tell you just pause a minute say your goodbyes but here's one thing you need to know don't you dare go and take that promised land without my bones if you're going in to take it you make sure you take me with you this is what joseph made the promise i may never see it with my eyes but don't you leave me over here make sure you let me come with you even if it's just in a box of bones let me come with you i want the inheritance as well let's worship the lord i know it's late and father i see that you are drawing the line let it live in me this is my prayer this is my plea and father i see that you are drawing [Music] just hold in your hand so let your kingdoms oh this is [Music] [Music] i'm surrendering my own i surrender to the kids [Music] give him everything you carry come on do it now let the [Music] [Music] yes hallelujah [Music] the song of your redeemed as the saints of every nation [Music] this is our song oh let the worshipers arise [Music] i surrender to the key [Music] [Music] see [Applause] [Music] i surrender to [Music] [Music] let the worshipers arise i'm surrendering my [Music] now here's our chance here's our chance we're standing around [Music] you don't have to reach very far to find somebody that loves you in this altar today [Music] and if there's anybody against you they better get it right because there's no reason for any of us to be against anybody who's standing around this altar these are god's children the ones he died for the ones he paid the price for it's not what this is about so you may feel alone but you are not standing here alone what you've done is you've gathered in his name without being called now i can't do it for you you can't do it for me you're going to have to say lord help me i'm sorry and i'm going to have to say the same thing there's just certain things we can't do for one another and repentance is one of them but it's the only way to start again you say well i already have look do it again the best thing to do is just stay in that attitude like the church age book said be just just be willing to scream out i was wrong i'm sorry and mean it and don't let the enemy talk you out of it he'll be busy with that after a while shut him up right now you tell the lord about it right now just bow your head and you tell the lord if there's anything in your heart that needs to be made right before him you tell him right now he's the only one that can do anything about it if you're carrying something if you have yielded yourself and you recognize it [Music] to an enemy that's really bigger than this little house and you want to cut off your relationship with that spirit and say no more you're going to have to find somebody else to use i'm done i'm done being a pawn of the devil i'm done being used to sow discord i'm done i'm done reigning on the parade in fact i'm gonna i want to be part of the solution and i want god to use me to help unify and draw the army together you tell the lord right now i can't pray for you i got to pray for myself but you pray right now and if we're gathered here in an atmosphere of love for one another there's no reason why we can't touch him when we pray here we are lord here we are lord your word has challenged us it's corrected us it's pulled us and lord here we stand today recognizing that in any situation of life it's impossible to be 100 right all the time so there's bound to be times that i have yielded to the wrong spirit there's bound to be times that i have misspoken that i have misjudged there's bound to be times that i've allowed the enemy to use me instead of the holy ghost but i stand lord before you today repenting and saying father you're the only hope we have for a better way you're the only way out to correct the course to push our young people forward into what you have started doing in their lives life-changing moves of god that go beyond the feeling of the flesh that go down into the very inner being to the root and start ministering to that i'm asking you right now to participate because you just pour this out to the lord do it you don't have to be loud you can do it right in your heart but you you you best do it now while you have an opportunity lord help me lord i believe help my unbelief lord i i know that what you say you can do my confidence is in you my hope is in you my trust is in you and there's a cry that goes out in this hour let the worshipers get up let the worshipers arise let those who see the value of the right atmosphere let them move forward now not regarding anything that would hinder or impede but saying lord let me go all the way let me yield all the way let me hold nothing back from you today let me lay it all down on the altar today hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lord thank you for your forgiveness thank you for the blood of jesus thank you for the grace of god that helps push us forward and make a way where there is no way if it were not for that grace we couldn't press our way in and on so we give this to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we surrender to you lord in this hour come on let's worship him now again come on let the worshipers arrive some of you're thinking too much don't do that let the sons and the daughters sing on him take on these things on [Music] i surrender to the key [Music] standing by your side holding your hand so let your kingdom come lord let it live in me this is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] let your kingdom come let [Music] this it my prayer oh this is [Music] [Music] sing it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] the sons and the daughters sing i'm surrendering my own [Music] [Applause] let the worshipers arise [Music] let the suns and the daughters sing we're surrendering our own [Music] oh let the worshipers arrive [Music] i'm surrendering my own [Music] lord we're surrendering to you [Music] every part of who we are we're surrendering it to the king we bring our praise

today lord we thank you for the life of the blood of jesus christ that cleanses us from all unrighteousness you said if we would confess the wrong and we would make it alright lord you would cleanse us from all of that stuff so lord as we have spent time in your presence today and we just loose ourselves from all of the past stuff lord even if it was last week or last year or last hour lord we're cleansing ourselves from it by the power and the life of the blood of jesus christ and we say you're behind us now and we're putting our face our eyes toward the promise of the lord jesus christ oh

lord for the victory [Music] as we were clapping the drums were playing my mind went to the scripture that talks about the three i believe it was three leprous men and they were hungry but they weren't allowed inside of the city they weren't allowed to get anything to eat and they finally said they knew the syrian army was over camped against their city and they finally said why sit we here till we die if we go to the city we're going to die because they're all starving already if we go to the syrian army maybe they'll at least give us something to eat but why sit we here till we die but what i was going to get to was when they got to the syrian army camp the syrians were already gone the camp was empty why was the camp empty because that god had sent a noise down through their camp that sounded like a bunch of horses coming toward them [Applause] and when we started clapping i don't know whether you paid attention to it but as more people joined their clap there was a different sound in it it raised the sound this is the same thing that we've been talking about for years the sound how that that sound can change the atmosphere you may not be saying anything out of your mouth
