[0:45] [Music]
[0:58] well hello to you I'm pastor Stephen
[1:02] Shelley from New Hope revival ministries
[1:04] in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming
[1:08] to you again today in partnership with
[1:11] brother Eric Erickson and all of the
[1:13] fine people at the gospel channel we
[1:16] appreciate the work that they are doing
[1:18] for the kingdom of God and we're we're
[1:22] not just partners in ministry but we're
[1:24] friends and we're brothers in Christ we
[1:27] appreciate brother Erickson he was here
[1:30] with us in Alabama several times through
[1:33] the years and he was actually here when
[1:36] we dedicated this studio to the glory of
[1:39] God it was such a delight to have him to
[1:42] come all the way from Iceland to Alabama
[1:44] and to pray over this equipment and help
[1:48] us to dedicate it for the use of the
[1:51] Lord Jesus Christ we love him we love
[1:54] his family his children and
[1:57] grandchildren and we pray for all of
[1:59] them
[1:59] just like they were our family and we
[2:03] love the staff at the gospel Channel
[2:06] they have treated me so many times like
[2:09] a king when I visit them in Iceland
[2:12] their hospitality is so warm and so so
[2:16] lovely so beautiful I have been fed
[2:19] amazing food and I learned to drink good
[2:23] coffee while I was there the first time
[2:26] and I've tasted a few things that well
[2:30] I've never wanted to taste them again
[2:32] but it was it was good at the time so I
[2:35] want you to know that the relationship
[2:38] that we have with the gospel channel is
[2:40] deeper than you just hearing me say
[2:43] we're in partnership with them we truly
[2:46] are and our folks at the New Hope
[2:49] revival ministries we pray for the
[2:52] gospel channel we want the Lord to
[2:55] continue to pour out his anointing and
[2:58] his direction
[3:00] it's a tremendous responsibility that
[3:03] sits on the shoulders of
[3:06] brother Eric Erickson and there are
[3:09] times when it gets down to what looks
[3:13] like very tight circumstances and we
[3:17] just go to prayer on occasion they will
[3:21] let us know it's time to pray a little
[3:22] more and we jump right in there and we
[3:25] pray and I want you to pray I want to
[3:28] invite you to become a prayer partner
[3:31] for the gospel Channel and if the Lord
[3:34] lays on your heart that there is
[3:36] something more that you can do to keep
[3:39] this beautiful Network on the air you
[3:42] reach out to the gospel channel you
[3:45] reach out to them and partner with them
[3:47] and I believe that it is a very fertile
[3:52] harvest field to give of your finances
[3:56] to I believe that the Lord will bless
[3:58] you I've seen how the family lives the
[4:01] staff lives there I want you to know
[4:04] that what they're doing for the kingdom
[4:06] of God is of a sacrificial nature and we
[4:09] get to be the beneficiaries even I on my
[4:13] computer from time to time I tune in to
[4:17] see what's going on at the gospel
[4:19] channel what a wonderful treat that we
[4:23] can do that wherever we are I can look
[4:26] at it on my phone on my computer at work
[4:29] or my laptop at home and so the Ministry
[4:34] of the gospel channel reaches farther
[4:38] than just the television and I
[4:41] appreciate that you can visit the
[4:44] website and stream let me also mention
[4:48] to you that we have a tremendous amount
[4:50] of free resources available to you if
[4:53] you have been blessed by our ministry
[4:56] and you want to know more or you want to
[5:00] listen to more or view more you can
[5:03] visit us on Facebook you can visit us on
[5:07] YouTube where you can subscribe to our
[5:10] Channel and have access to all of the
[5:14] programs that we do for the gospel
[5:17] channel as well as
[5:19] our services at New Hope revival
[5:22] ministries here in Alabama and we also
[5:24] have an app that we've been telling you
[5:26] about and quite a few of you have taken
[5:29] advantage of both subscribing to the
[5:32] YouTube channel and also downloading the
[5:35] app for your smartphone or your tablet
[5:37] you know we're not trying to build some
[5:41] sort of Kingdom and promote ourselves
[5:44] but I want you to know that we believe
[5:47] in what we believe in we believe that
[5:50] there is an unveiling of the Lord Jesus
[5:53] Christ from his word that the Holy
[5:58] Spirit of God is providing and has been
[6:01] providing eyesalve that we might be able
[6:06] to see the Word of God in a fresh way
[6:09] more clearly than we have ever seen it
[6:12] before I believe that it began with the
[6:16] Apostle John on the Isle of Patmos this
[6:20] apocalypsis this unveiling this
[6:23] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[6:26] I believe that even one generation ago
[6:29] there was a most significant download of
[6:35] that unveiling that revelation of Jesus
[6:40] Christ and you can find out more about
[6:43] what God did in that ministry on our app
[6:47] if you should so desire to download that
[6:52] app you will be able to hear some
[6:55] amazing preaching and teaching from a
[6:59] servant of the Lord one generation ago
[7:02] brother William Branham and you will
[7:04] also find a living witness at that time
[7:09] of his ministry who had beautiful
[7:12] insight knowing brother Branham on a
[7:16] personal level and having an opportunity
[7:19] to be with him travel with him go
[7:23] hunting with him and also to represent
[7:26] his ministry around the world and
[7:29] we have a lot of the recorded sermons of
[7:32] brother Perry green on our app as well I
[7:35] think that what God did in that great
[7:39] servant of the Lord is so significant
[7:42] even for the hour that we're living in
[7:45] right now that it would be a true
[7:49] blessing in your life to do a little
[7:52] investigating you know I'm that sort of
[7:55] person when I hear that something
[7:59] interesting exciting profound has taken
[8:02] place well I I may not have time to get
[8:06] all the details but I start on the
[8:08] journey and I start digging out and when
[8:12] you do that you're going to find about
[8:14] any particular subject you're going to
[8:16] find the positive and the negative
[8:19] anytime that God uses a servant of the
[8:22] Lord like brother Branham was used
[8:25] there's going to be criticism there's
[8:28] going to be misunderstanding there's
[8:30] going to be those who mock and even
[8:33] those who lie some are jealous of what
[8:35] God was doing and others have just
[8:38] completely misunderstood what the Lord
[8:41] was accomplishing in that ministry and
[8:44] then sometimes those who take up the the
[8:48] call that they recognized on another man
[8:51] of God's life and they they become
[8:53] followers of that ministry well you know
[8:56] people can go overboard and this has
[8:59] certainly been the case in the ministry
[9:02] of brother Branham there have been many
[9:04] of those who loved him but who have
[9:08] really taken their affection for him to
[9:12] the extreme I believe that we must let
[9:16] the Lord Jesus Christ have preeminence
[9:20] in all things but I believe it's very
[9:23] important to recognize the gifts and the
[9:26] offices the messengers that God has sent
[9:31] to those seven church ages and the
[9:34] relevance of their teaching and their
[9:37] preaching and their prophetic ministry
[9:39] and even though we're talking now about
[9:42] one generation ago I find tremendous
[9:46] strength and tremendous help and hope
[9:50] from the preaching that was done
[9:54] spanning the late 40s all the way up to
[9:58] 1965 so we have some of that available
[10:01] if you're scared off by criticisms and
[10:05] websites of criticism then you then you
[10:09] might not you might not be interested in
[10:11] digging in but if you're like me and you
[10:14] have a reason to believe that sometimes
[10:16] when the enemy tries to keep you away
[10:18] from something then there's something
[10:21] that's worth looking into and I'm so
[10:24] thankful for all those many years ago
[10:27] when God let me come in contact with
[10:32] that ministry it has shaped my life and
[10:35] I believe that I am better prepared to
[10:38] meet the Lord in rapture because of that
[10:42] unveiling ministry and let me say to you
[10:46] today that Jesus Christ is the same
[10:50] yesterday and today and forever he
[10:54] changes not I believe that all
[10:58] revelation is progressive I believe that
[11:02] the Lord has unveiled himself and is
[11:06] continuing to unveil himself one of the
[11:10] things that I remember brother branham
[11:12] saying about this subject that means so
[11:16] much to me is he talked about God being
[11:21] so multifaceted there there is so much
[11:25] in God there is so much of God that we
[11:29] barely understand and one time brother
[11:34] Branham was preaching and he said that
[11:36] our Lord Jesus Christ would still be
[11:40] unveiling and revealing himself for all
[11:44] eternity oh that is a mind-boggling
[11:47] statement but it's one that really gives
[11:51] me hope I want to know more about the
[11:54] Lord did you ever sing that song I want
[11:57] to know more about the Lord and I truly
[12:00] do and I I'm thankful for everything
[12:02] that God has revealed to me and made
[12:05] made personal to me by the Holy Spirit
[12:08] from the word but I'm still learning and
[12:11] to hear a statement like that when when
[12:14] you have learned all you can learn on
[12:16] this earth about the Lord about who he
[12:20] is about how much he's loved his
[12:22] children about how he has watched over
[12:25] us even when we were unaware of his
[12:28] watchful eye and then to think that we
[12:33] step into eternity and even in eternity
[12:37] hallelujah there's so much to know about
[12:40] him that in all eternity he continues to
[12:44] open up himself to reveal himself it's
[12:48] like it's like peeling the layers off of
[12:51] an onion one layer of skin at a time and
[12:54] you peel it off and there's one
[12:56] underneath this is the big God the
[13:00] wonderful glorious omnipotent God that
[13:04] we serve that there is so much in him
[13:08] that we are just scratching the surface
[13:11] but one day we will step out of time
[13:16] into the realm of eternity and for all
[13:19] of that eternity we'll continue to learn
[13:23] of him to sit at his feet to worship Him
[13:27] and to hear those words of life and
[13:31] truth that come out of his mouth I've
[13:35] always been fascinated by that verse of
[13:38] scripture that says that if everything
[13:41] that happened in the life of the Lord
[13:45] Jesus Christ everything that happened in
[13:49] his ministry would have been as
[13:51] carefully recorded as what we have in
[13:54] the four Gospels that the world would
[13:57] not be able to contain the volumes that
[14:00] could have been written about him I'm
[14:03] talking about a very short span
[14:07] of earthly ministry but so profound on
[14:11] so many different levels that the world
[14:14] could not contain the record of what was
[14:18] accomplished in his earthly coming his
[14:21] body coming to the Lord to this earth as
[14:25] the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:27] I tell you that makes me hungry it makes
[14:31] me hungry for more of him to spend more
[14:34] time with him now and in order to do
[14:38] that well we have to make some tough
[14:40] choices sometime and we have to
[14:43] recognize that we allow things to slip
[14:46] in they become important and they become
[14:49] priority and truly as a born-again
[14:53] spirit fill believer our Lord Jesus
[14:56] Yeshua he wants to be our number one
[15:01] reason for getting up in the morning our
[15:04] number one reason for pressing through
[15:07] life and I want to tell you if it were
[15:09] not for the Lord I love my wife I love
[15:13] my children I think I've said that on
[15:15] this broadcast before they mean so much
[15:17] to me I'm so delighted and I enjoy so
[15:21] much spending time with them but if they
[15:25] were the only reason if they were all
[15:28] that I had in this world I don't know if
[15:31] that would be enough I seriously doubt
[15:34] that that would be enough to to inspire
[15:38] me encouraged me to keep pressing
[15:40] through some of the battles of having a
[15:43] public ministry but it's my time with
[15:47] him it's those moments when he whispers
[15:50] to my spirit sometimes he speaks so
[15:54] clearly to us that it is as though we
[15:57] have heard an audible voice and at times
[16:01] he whispers so sweetly so peacefully and
[16:05] yet so profoundly to the inside of the
[16:10] inside sometimes we call it our know
[16:13] where he speaks to our knower something
[16:16] on the inside of us we just know that
[16:18] God
[16:20] has ministered strength to us he has
[16:24] whispered a word of encouragement he has
[16:27] reminded us of a particular passage of
[16:31] Scripture that we can just chew on this
[16:35] that sound too carnal or disrespectful I
[16:41] hope not because the Word of God is our
[16:45] daily bread and really we can meditate
[16:50] on it and ruminate in it and on it and
[16:53] be strengthened by it
[16:55] don't ever neglect God's Word in your
[17:00] life it's much more than a history book
[17:03] it is a written record of the Living
[17:08] Word of God when we were together the
[17:12] last time we were talking about a new
[17:15] season in life encouraging you that may
[17:21] be what you're going through right now
[17:23] is well it feels like you're sort of
[17:27] paralyzed maybe you feel like you're in
[17:30] a holding pattern that you're not really
[17:33] accomplishing very much for the Lord
[17:37] in fact it's sometimes that during those
[17:41] periods of time in our life we feel
[17:44] almost completely disconnected from the
[17:47] Lord but I believe and I want to
[17:51] announce it I want to declare it decree
[17:56] it to prophetically so it into your life
[18:00] I believe that your season is changing
[18:05] and I believe that the only thing that's
[18:09] holding you back is you've got to
[18:12] believe that you've got to accept that
[18:16] God allows these herbs and flows these
[18:21] seasonal changes remember that sometimes
[18:26] we get down in the valley but if it were
[18:29] not for at least two
[18:30] Mountains there wouldn't be a valley and
[18:33] so in the Christian life I think we're
[18:38] safe to say there's always going to be
[18:40] more blessing than trials but sometimes
[18:44] that old enemy
[18:46] he likes to magnify the trial he likes
[18:50] to magnify the heartache and the loss
[18:53] and sort of cloud our vision and affect
[18:58] our ability to remember the goodness of
[19:02] God in our life so I just want as a part
[19:06] of our ministry to you I want to come
[19:10] here as often as God will give us the
[19:12] strength to do it and I want to sow
[19:15] words of encouragement into your life
[19:18] that you who are born again of the
[19:22] Spirit of God you have power and
[19:25] authority in your life and I believe
[19:29] that there's authority in your God
[19:33] inspired words when the Spirit of the
[19:37] Lord breathes on you and you began to
[19:40] speak words of truth even into your own
[19:44] circumstances even to your own situation
[19:48] I I recently read something I'm not
[19:54] going to go into the detail of it it was
[19:57] very short it was just to comment that
[20:00] someone made but when I read it I just
[20:05] simply sensed fear
[20:08] I stood up from my desk and I walked
[20:12] down the hallway coming out of my office
[20:15] here at the New Hope revival ministries
[20:19] and I just began to talk to the Lord out
[20:23] loud my son works in the hallway in
[20:28] another room near where I work and there
[20:32] are other brothers who work in another
[20:33] area of of the church facility and I
[20:37] don't know sometimes they probably hear
[20:39] me talking to myself sometimes they
[20:42] probably hear me talking to the law
[20:44] but my son was going to lunch and there
[20:46] was nobody to hear me and I walked up
[20:48] and down that hallway just today saying
[20:51] over and over again I refused fear I
[20:56] pray Lord for the people of this church
[21:00] community that they will not be moved by
[21:04] fear but when the enemy tries to place
[21:08] fear over their lives because of a
[21:11] threat that the enemy may have have
[21:14] issued against them I pray that the
[21:18] peace of God and the love of God will
[21:21] rise up in every saint to defeat the
[21:25] fear I I continued to declare out loud
[21:31] I refuse to be paralyzed by fear I
[21:37] refuse to allow the enemy to cause me to
[21:41] change my plans my vision my burden my
[21:46] goals because of fear the fear of
[21:51] failure the fear of the unknown the fear
[21:55] of what might happen what could happen
[21:59] the possibilities and I just felt some
[22:03] encouragement
[22:05] nobody praying for me just praying for
[22:08] myself and for my people you're speaking
[22:11] it out over their lives I want to do the
[22:15] same for you I just decree and declare
[22:18] over you right now in the name of the
[22:21] Lord Jesus Christ that the next time
[22:24] fear moves in to try to paralyze you
[22:28] there in your home that you will
[22:30] remember that you are a blood-bought
[22:33] child of the Living God and if you don't
[22:37] know that you're born again you can fix
[22:40] that right now by inviting the Lord
[22:43] Jesus Christ into your life repenting of
[22:45] your sins and making your peace with him
[22:49] I just want to pray and believe that
[22:52] that in those moments when the enemy
[22:55] tries to overwhelm you with
[22:57] with the what-ifs the possibilities of
[23:01] what might be what could possibly happen
[23:04] that you will reject that and refuse to
[23:09] come into agreement I tell you that the
[23:13] enemy of our soul that old devil he's
[23:16] he's got a wild imagination doesn't he
[23:20] have you ever caught yourself on one of
[23:23] those bunny trails of thought if that
[23:26] should happen and then oh my that could
[23:28] happen and the next thing you know that
[23:30] that would then happen and and this
[23:32] could mean that and the other thing
[23:34] could mean one of the ways the enemy
[23:37] will get ahold of your mind to torment
[23:38] you is a feeling in your body some
[23:44] symptom in your body and then you go to
[23:46] dr. Google and you look up what that
[23:49] symptom means and my the next thing you
[23:52] know you'll be signing a contract at the
[23:55] funeral home making sure you've picked
[23:57] out the right casket this is how the
[24:00] enemy works and really it's to keep us
[24:04] paralyzed in fear so that we're just
[24:06] wasting time time that we need to be
[24:10] using declaring the goodness of the only
[24:14] true Living God Yahweh God our holy God
[24:22] the translation we have in English of
[24:25] his name Jehovah he is the great I am I
[24:30] am that I am the Lord Jesus Christ is
[24:35] that same God in body form the Word made
[24:40] flesh and there's so much that we need
[24:44] to be doing for him prayers that need to
[24:47] be prayed songs that need to be sung
[24:50] lives that need to be witness to
[24:53] testimonies that need to be shared and
[24:57] yet that old enemy he will get us on the
[25:01] bunny trail of thought I'm going to
[25:04] believe for you the same way I've
[25:06] believed for my own church people and
[25:09] when we move from the realm of fear to
[25:13] the realm of faith it not only changes
[25:15] our thoughts but what is a word a word
[25:21] is a thought expressed so if our
[25:24] thoughts change guess what else changes
[25:27] our confession what comes out of our
[25:31] mouth changes because our thoughts have
[25:35] been changed this is one of the most
[25:38] important things that I have to do
[25:42] brother sister I have to do it in my own
[25:45] life every single day I have to watch
[25:50] those thoughts because they will become
[25:53] words and once that comes out of my
[25:56] mouth it not only affects my life my
[25:59] health my destiny but it influences
[26:03] others around me God helped me have
[26:06] mercy on me and I pray the same prayer
[26:10] for you we need to change our thoughts
[26:13] because we need to change our vocabulary
[26:16] we need to be speaking a message of hope
[26:20] and life and truth according to God's
[26:24] Word not paralyzed in fear in our flat
[26:28] afraid to face life afraid to face today
[26:33] much less tomorrow when we know by the
[26:36] scripture perfect love casteth out fear
[26:39] and so again let me say to you there is
[26:44] a new season available for you if you
[26:46] can only believe if you can only allow
[26:50] your faith to reach up and say yes Lord
[26:53] yes Lord I take that new season and and
[26:59] I'm going to do everything within my
[27:01] power to live it as a new season
[27:04] ultimately we know it's up to the Spirit
[27:07] of God the Spirit of Truth to help
[27:10] change circumstances around us but all
[27:14] there is power in our confession there
[27:18] is Authority in our
[27:22] what comes out of our mouth what we
[27:25] confess
[27:26] remember friend the New Testament tells
[27:29] us that he is the high priest are you
[27:34] listening to me he is the high priest of
[27:39] our confession oh so we want to be
[27:43] careful right because what does a high
[27:46] priest do he takes the offering and he
[27:50] raises it up as an offering to God
[27:54] whatever was brought whatever the people
[27:58] provided he took that offering that
[28:01] sacrifice that blood and raised it up to
[28:05] God if the New Testament tells us that
[28:07] our Lord Jesus Christ is a high priest
[28:10] of our confession I'm so thankful that
[28:13] we have a high priest who is touched by
[28:18] the feeling of our infirmities and he
[28:21] lives he ever lives to make intercession
[28:25] to God for us thank you Lord that you
[28:29] are that great high priest and the high
[28:31] priest of my confession so I need to be
[28:34] careful what I'm what I'm offering to
[28:37] the high priest of my confession so I
[28:39] got to be careful what my confession is
[28:42] because my confession is then carried
[28:45] before the Eternal Spirit of the Father
[28:48] by my great high priest so there are so
[28:51] many reasons why we have to watch our
[28:55] thoughts and we have to watch our words
[28:57] we have to respond not in fear but in
[29:01] faith Lord I I received my new season
[29:05] and when the Lord continued to deal with
[29:09] us in our little church about this
[29:13] thought he began to speak to my spirit
[29:16] and he said I'm giving you a new season
[29:20] and you're going to need a new anointing
[29:23] for that new season oh I like that
[29:26] because I know there is power in the
[29:30] anointing and I want us to talk about
[29:33] that today
[29:34] in the in the Bible there's a beautiful
[29:38] passage of scripture in Isaiah chapter
[29:42] 10 it is in verse 27 Isaiah 10:27 and it
[29:51] shall come to pass in that day that his
[29:55] burdens shall be taken away from off thy
[29:59] shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck
[30:04] and the yoke shall be destroyed because
[30:10] of the anointing
[30:13] we've ministered that verse here on the
[30:17] gospel channel before it's such a
[30:20] powerful verse because the enemy he
[30:24] likes to place that yoke of burden of
[30:28] bondage on our shoulder maybe you can
[30:32] picture in your mind that yoke from from
[30:36] times past that would be laid on the on
[30:40] the shoulder of the oxen driving the
[30:44] cart or plowing the field the ox goad
[30:48] it's called sometime heavy piece of
[30:52] lumber of timber that would lay on the
[30:57] shoulder of that old ox and it gave the
[31:00] operator the farmer it gave him greater
[31:04] control over moving and stopping and
[31:08] changing the direction of that ox now if
[31:12] the enemy has a yoke on your shoulder
[31:16] what does that mean it means that the
[31:21] enemy has greater ability to cause you
[31:27] to move to stop to turn to the left to
[31:30] turn to the right at his will at his
[31:34] whim I don't know about you but I have a
[31:38] feeling that you're like me in the sense
[31:41] that you don't want the enemy to have
[31:44] that much control of your life I say no
[31:48] control I don't want to do the devil's
[31:52] bidding he's going to have to find
[31:55] another ox he's going to have to find
[31:58] another servant there is a way
[32:01] hallelujah that that yoke on your
[32:05] shoulder can be destroyed the scripture
[32:09] is clear and the yoke shall be destroyed
[32:14] because of the anointing oh praise God
[32:22] wonderful Lord I thank you for that
[32:25] anointing we can have a new fresh
[32:28] anointing for a new season that God is
[32:33] calling us into I want you to know that
[32:37] the anointing is not a feeling it's not
[32:40] an idea it's not an emotion it's not an
[32:45] atmosphere it's not the hair standing up
[32:49] on your arms the anointing is a person
[32:54] the anointing is a presence the presence
[33:00] of a person the person of the Lord Jesus
[33:04] Christ when when the Spirit of God
[33:08] promises I want to give you a fresh
[33:11] anointing for the new season what does
[33:15] it mean I believe it means that God
[33:18] wants you and I to experience the
[33:22] presence the person of Jesus Christ in a
[33:27] fresh way in a new way I believe that it
[33:32] is possible to have a fresh experience
[33:37] with Jesus Christ every day of our lives
[33:41] and that is my goal that is my desire I
[33:46] cannot say that I have experienced that
[33:50] every day of my life but it's possible I
[33:53] believe it's available and I believe the
[33:56] only thing standing in my way is me I
[34:00] believed
[34:02] it takes what we were speaking about
[34:04] just a few moments ago it takes a change
[34:09] of thought it takes a change of
[34:11] vocabulary
[34:13] it takes a rearranging of our priorities
[34:16] I want you to know that when we begin to
[34:19] understand who this is living on the
[34:23] inside of us I mean truly understand
[34:28] what it means to have the life the
[34:33] spirit life of Jesus Christ
[34:38] living on the inside of me living on the
[34:42] inside of you by the new birth then it
[34:45] becomes easier perhaps even quicker to
[34:51] connect with God when we are fully
[34:54] persuaded that we are not trying to get
[34:58] a hold of a God that lives a million
[35:01] miles away we are merely communicating
[35:06] reaching in to a God that has chosen
[35:10] hallelujah
[35:11] a God who has chosen to live inside of
[35:18] us by the power of the Holy Ghost and
[35:21] when we're reaching for him we're not
[35:24] reaching past the Milky Way we're not
[35:27] trying to get our prayers around Jupiter
[35:29] and Saturn and Mars so that we can find
[35:32] our our way into heaven we're reaching
[35:36] to a God who has chosen what house will
[35:40] you build me the scripture said God was
[35:44] temporarily pleased to dwell in a
[35:47] tabernacle made of badger skin the skin
[35:51] of goats God was temporarily pleased to
[35:57] dwell in a house made of Cedars one that
[36:01] was destroyed and then restored and
[36:04] rebuilt again the Holy Temple of God but
[36:08] God his original design his original
[36:12] purpose we
[36:13] know this from Genesis from the
[36:17] beginning from the book of origin his
[36:21] original design and desire was to have a
[36:25] people a person a family of sons a
[36:32] family of persons that he could come and
[36:37] live inside my eyes become the eyes of
[36:43] the Lord he desires to look through my
[36:46] eyes my hands become the hands of the
[36:50] Lord by feet become the feet of the Lord
[36:52] my body becomes the temple of the Holy
[36:55] Ghost and I'm waiting and watching and
[36:59] sensing what would you have me to do I I
[37:03] have to admit that there are times in my
[37:06] life that I feel like I've become slower
[37:08] about knowing the mind of God and the
[37:12] heart of God but I'm determined to keep
[37:15] pressing in when I was a young minister
[37:19] I I had oh my I don't know what kind of
[37:23] faith you'd call it it it was called in
[37:26] the great healing revivals bulldog faith
[37:29] faith was my first response when there
[37:33] was a tragedy faith was my first
[37:35] response when there was a problem faith
[37:38] was what came into my heart into my mind
[37:42] and out of my mouth before I had an
[37:45] opportunity to react emotionally I
[37:48] reacted in faith and I want you to know
[37:52] I want to go back to that place I'm I am
[37:56] going back to that place I'm on a
[37:59] journey back to that place you you may
[38:03] not appreciate what an inspiration that
[38:07] can be to other people that in the midst
[38:10] of a tragedy faith comes out of your
[38:13] heart
[38:14] and faith comes out of your mouth it
[38:17] inspires other people to look to Jesus
[38:21] instead of looking to the hardship to
[38:24] the sickness the infirmity
[38:27] the circumstances if we get our eyes
[38:30] friend if we get our eyes on the
[38:33] circumstances we'll go to bed we will
[38:36] and we won't want to get out of bed
[38:38] we'll be like you know somebody pulling
[38:41] the covers up over their face and trying
[38:43] to hide from life but my goodness we
[38:47] can't do that we can't hide from life
[38:50] neither can we let life pass us by
[38:53] because we only have one life to live
[38:56] here in this dimension of time one day
[39:01] we will lay this dimension of time down
[39:03] and the body that we have chosen to live
[39:05] in that God has placed us in and we will
[39:09] step into a place a dimension where
[39:12] there is no time only eternity but we're
[39:16] living in time now and I hate to be so
[39:20] plain but the clock is ticking your time
[39:24] is ticking away it doesn't matter
[39:27] whether you're a teenager or a senior
[39:30] citizen we're not promised of tomorrow
[39:33] if we should all live a long healthy
[39:36] life it's still coming quicker than what
[39:40] we would like for it to come so can I
[39:43] afford to spend days of my life hiding
[39:48] from life no sir I can't i myself have
[39:53] made a commitment to get back to that
[39:55] place where faith is my first reaction
[39:59] and my first response in fact I'm
[40:03] claiming that as part of the new
[40:05] anointing in this new season that God
[40:10] will so help my mind that it becomes
[40:15] very automatic when I am presented with
[40:18] a need with a problem with the tragedy I
[40:23] want the Lord to so touch my thoughts
[40:26] that the first thing I think of is God
[40:30] has got a plan he has a plan and he is
[40:37] working all things out for the good
[40:41] of them who loved the Lord of them who
[40:44] are the called according to his purpose
[40:47] I believe that you're watching this
[40:52] program and many of you are a part of
[40:55] the called according to his purpose but
[40:59] you've been living life really from from
[41:04] the covers from underneath the covers
[41:07] some of you have been letting life pass
[41:10] while you have been taking a little nap
[41:14] in the closet so to speak it's time for
[41:17] you to come out of the cave it's time
[41:20] for you to arise and shine it's time for
[41:25] you and I to agree today that the
[41:28] anointing of the Lord a new and fresh
[41:31] experience with Jesus Christ on a
[41:34] personal level can destroy the yoke that
[41:40] the enemy has placed on your shoulder
[41:43] because of the anointing the yoke shall
[41:49] be destroyed I love that word destroyed
[41:52] I love this expression it's not just
[41:56] broken I think I've shared this on the
[42:00] program already but I'm just trying to
[42:01] follow the leadership of the Lord today
[42:04] it's not just broken because I think
[42:07] most of you know that old enemy is very
[42:09] determined he doesn't give up that quick
[42:12] and if we should just pray a prayer to
[42:15] break the yoke you know he would just
[42:17] get out superglue he would do anything
[42:20] and everything he could to patch that
[42:22] thing up make it a little heavier and
[42:25] slap it right back on your back to
[42:27] control you like a farmer would control
[42:30] the oxcart but because of the anointing
[42:34] the yoke that the enemy has used will
[42:37] not only be broken says the Lord through
[42:41] the prophet Isaiah but it shall be what
[42:45] would you say it destroyed utterly
[42:50] destroyed so that it is
[42:54] irreparable irreparable it cannot be
[42:59] repaired
[43:00] that's the goodness of God and that is
[43:04] what he wants you and I to be able to
[43:08] experience with him and in him well if
[43:12] we don't know that it's available then
[43:15] we don't know what to ask for what to
[43:18] believe for so that's one of my jobs
[43:21] that's one of my responsibilities it's
[43:24] one that I take very serious I want to
[43:27] be here I want to be faithful I want to
[43:31] be helping to share with you little keys
[43:33] small pieces of inspiration that you'll
[43:37] be able to grab ahold of and say hey
[43:39] I'll try that in my own life and I won't
[43:44] try it expecting that it won't work or
[43:47] that it won't make a difference
[43:49] but I will apply that believing that
[43:53] because it is based in truth and in
[43:55] faith that it will work in in Psalm 92
[44:01] and verse 10 there is an unusual verse
[44:06] of scripture it says but my horn shalt
[44:11] thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn I
[44:15] shall be anointed with fresh oil in the
[44:23] amplified version of Psalm 92 10 it
[44:26] reads this way but my horn and in
[44:29] parentheses emblem of excessive strength
[44:33] and stately grace you have exalted like
[44:37] that of a wild ox
[44:39] I am anointed with fresh oil there's no
[44:44] such thing as a unicorn Bible
[44:47] Translators have all they have argued
[44:50] for years about whether or not that is
[44:54] a rhinoceros or whether that is some
[44:56] kind of cape buffalo with horns with a
[45:00] large horn maybe some kind of of
[45:03] antelope with one one horn but it
[45:07] doesn't really matter what species was
[45:09] used here because it was a symbol of
[45:12] power and authority and the psalmist is
[45:16] saying you have exalted my strength my
[45:20] authority and my grace and I shall be
[45:26] anointed with fresh oil no one is
[45:30] hearing you and if they are who cares
[45:33] why don't you make this confession with
[45:36] me right now
[45:36] I am anointed with fresh oil let's say
[45:44] that again
[45:44] I am anointed with fresh oil here's a
[45:49] verse of scripture that I can take a
[45:51] hold of you've promised Lord a fresh
[45:55] anointing for the new season
[45:58] I'm learning that the anointing is a
[46:01] person Immanuel God with us the Messiah
[46:05] the Christ the Anointed One and I want a
[46:10] fresh encounter with you Lord with him
[46:15] the anointing is a knowing it is an
[46:20] assurance that comes by revelation when
[46:26] God opens up his word to you and it
[46:29] drops from your head to your heart it
[46:32] gets down in the inside of the inside
[46:34] and becomes a part of who you are I was
[46:38] listening to someone speaking today for
[46:41] just a few minutes while I was eating my
[46:43] lunch on YouTube and one of the things
[46:47] that was said was very very similar to
[46:50] that knowing and that revelation and
[46:53] this person said once God reveals
[46:56] something to you it becomes a part of
[47:00] you well I made that same statement
[47:02] yesterday in our church in Smith Station
[47:05] Alabama or our
[47:08] on Saturday night in one of our services
[47:10] I believe that I believe that's why
[47:14] revelation is so important the more we
[47:18] allow the Spirit of God to give us
[47:21] understanding of revelation of and we
[47:24] have to present ourselves for revelation
[47:28] we have to make ourselves available for
[47:31] revelation we can't run here and there
[47:34] chasing this and that and expect God to
[47:37] reveal his word to us we have to
[47:40] position ourselves in prayer we have to
[47:43] position ourselves to look at God's Word
[47:46] prayerfully to read it prayerfully and
[47:50] pray that God will speak we need to be
[47:54] led to ministries that we can have
[47:56] confidence in that's what I was sharing
[47:59] with you at the opening of this program
[48:01] today God connected me sovereignly to a
[48:06] ministry and when by the time I found
[48:10] out more I realized that the man that
[48:14] God had used so mightily had died three
[48:17] years before I was ever born and yet
[48:20] I've learned more from listening to that
[48:22] man preach and teach and minister in the
[48:26] supernatural than I could have perhaps
[48:28] learned from a mentor that I was sitting
[48:31] around the coffee hour with every day
[48:33] God allowed and arranged that for me I
[48:36] have confidence in how God used him and
[48:41] how his words tied connected dovetailed
[48:46] with the scripture you and not need that
[48:49] we need that in our life somebody that
[48:53] we can listen to learn from glean from
[48:56] help point us in the right direction I
[49:00] know that ultimately you and I have to
[49:03] have our own relationship with Jesus
[49:05] Christ by the Holy Spirit but when we're
[49:09] hungry for revelation when we're praying
[49:13] for an encounter with the spirit of
[49:16] understanding it's good to know that we
[49:20] have a source
[49:21] we have someone that we can listen to
[49:24] and feed from and if it's someone that's
[49:27] alive that you can visit with but if not
[49:30] I believe that God has been good to
[49:33] preserve resources and materials for us
[49:37] that we can feed on and feast on the
[49:40] ultimate purpose of doing that is to
[49:42] have not more knowledge in the in the
[49:47] sense of of information but knowledge in
[49:52] the sense of intimacy the Bible speaking
[49:57] about Mary the Virgin girl the mother of
[50:01] our Lord so to speak the one who carried
[50:03] him in her womb she knew no man that
[50:08] didn't mean that she didn't know any men
[50:11] she knew a family member she had perhaps
[50:14] brothers and a father and there were
[50:17] neighbors and she knew people men and
[50:21] women but that is a knowing by
[50:25] introduction or by association but when
[50:31] the scripture said she knew no man it
[50:33] means she was not intimate she had not
[50:36] had sexual relations with a man that
[50:41] kind of knowing is that deeper knowing
[50:44] that's the kind of knowing that you and
[50:47] I desire from the word not just to be
[50:52] introduced to it and fellowship it on
[50:55] surface level but I want to go deep
[50:58] I want that word to go deep in me
[51:00] because I believe that the revealed Word
[51:03] of God changes us
[51:04] I believe we're change one molecule one
[51:07] cell at a time I do
[51:09] I believe there's nothing like sitting
[51:12] under the anointed Word of God and the
[51:17] more of that word that is revealed to us
[51:20] the more that we can fellowship with
[51:22] that word on an intimate level the more
[51:25] we are changed from the inside out and
[51:28] the more of that
[51:29] word that becomes a part of us and I'm
[51:33] telling you something you know you can
[51:35] try to defeat the enemy with hearsay and
[51:38] that might work for you part of the time
[51:41] but there's something better than
[51:43] hearsay there there's some truth that
[51:46] has been made known to me that it didn't
[51:49] just I didn't just hear it from the
[51:50] preacher and say that's it that's right
[51:52] the Spirit of God quickened that word
[51:55] truth to me the Spirit of God made that
[51:59] revelation alive in my heart then that
[52:01] becomes a part of me and so that then
[52:05] becomes part of my weapon part of my
[52:07] arsenal against the enemy we need that
[52:10] revelation that unveiling of the word
[52:13] and that comes to us every time we
[52:17] encounter the genuine anointing of the
[52:21] Holy Spirit
[52:22] he quickens more and more of the word of
[52:25] the truth to us do you remember the
[52:28] verse of scriptures well several verses
[52:31] of Scripture that we used in our series
[52:34] on in the fullness of time that was
[52:37] found in Galatians 4 let me read only
[52:41] one verse of that to you reminding you
[52:43] of it Galatians 4:6 and because you are
[52:48] sons God hath sent forth the spirit of
[52:53] his son into your hearts crying Abba
[52:59] Father
[53:00] oh my we covered that in that series on
[53:04] the fullness of time this spirit of his
[53:09] son the Holy Spirit Jesus said I will
[53:12] not leave you comfortless I will come to
[53:15] you in another place he said I will pray
[53:18] the father and he will send you another
[53:20] comforter that other comforter was a
[53:25] different dimension of that same spirit
[53:29] that was in the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:31] it was now going to be taken and divided
[53:35] among believers initially 120 gathered
[53:39] in the upper room on the
[53:41] a Pentecost but look how many have
[53:43] encountered the power of the Holy Spirit
[53:45] all the way up till now 2019 where we're
[53:49] living now many many many many many have
[53:52] had personal encounters with the power
[53:55] of the Holy Spirit I'm here to tell you
[53:57] I have had a personal relationship and
[54:00] encounter with that Holy Spirit of God
[54:03] the Holy Ghost of God and because the
[54:07] spirit of his son that's the same spirit
[54:10] because it was sent into my heart it
[54:13] brings me into relationship son ship it
[54:20] looses in my life and covers me with the
[54:25] spirit of adoption and it's by that
[54:28] spirit of adoption that I can cry out to
[54:32] the father the same father that our Lord
[54:35] led us in prayer our Father who art in
[54:38] heaven hallowed be thy name but when the
[54:40] spirit of his son is sent into your
[54:44] heart you can know him in a more
[54:46] intimate level than our Father hallowed
[54:49] be thy name you can know him as the
[54:52] scripture says here Abba Father Abba
[54:57] Father this is an intimate knowing of
[55:02] God to really know him and be known of
[55:06] him it's like saying Papa oh my papa
[55:12] my Abba oh how you love me and because
[55:19] you love me I'm able to love you and I
[55:24] want to love you more I believe that
[55:28] that could possibly also be your prayer
[55:30] to know him more to love him more and I
[55:36] believe this is a good season for you to
[55:40] experience that kind of love that
[55:44] knowing that assurance father I thank
[55:48] you for your presence today I thank you
[55:51] for the gift of the Holy Ghost and how
[55:54] all he has come into my life and has
[55:56] given me such joy and strength I desire
[56:00] for all of my friends to have that same
[56:03] experience with you and so I pray Lord
[56:06] that as they look to you in faith and as
[56:09] they agree with me in prayer that you
[56:12] will fill them that that you will fill
[56:15] them that they will come to a place of
[56:17] obeying your word and be filled with the
[56:21] Holy Ghost I pray Lord that that life
[56:24] your life in them would give them the
[56:28] strength to embrace this new season
[56:32] because of the anointing we decree and
[56:36] declare that the yoke of bondage that
[56:39] the enemy has placed on their neck their
[56:42] shoulder it must be broken it shall be
[56:46] broken we declare it we prophesy it we
[56:49] press into that truth for every one who
[56:53] has faith to believe right now whether
[56:56] it's healing or whether it's family
[56:59] problem or whether it's finances or a
[57:01] warfare whatever they are facing today I
[57:05] pray that the enemy will no longer be
[57:07] successful in using that yoke to control
[57:10] them to direct them to drive them I pray
[57:13] that even now the anointing of the Holy
[57:16] Spirit will break and destroy that yoke
[57:19] so that it can never be repaired and
[57:22] used against them may they grow in grace
[57:25] and may they find a ministry that they
[57:29] can connect to that will help point them
[57:32] in the direction of Revelation and may
[57:35] the spirit of understanding come and
[57:38] make your word live in the hearts of men
[57:42] and women we ask this in faith believing
[57:45] in the wonderful name of Yeshua in the
[57:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[57:52] amen
[57:54] man I've enjoyed being with you today
[57:57] tune in again next time god bless you
[58:00] bye-bye
