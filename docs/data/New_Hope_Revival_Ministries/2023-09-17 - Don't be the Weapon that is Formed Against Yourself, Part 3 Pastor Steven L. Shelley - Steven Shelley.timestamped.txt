[1:01:25] what a day we had yesterday
[1:01:29] Josiah and Jennifer we welcome you all
[1:01:32] to your first service as a newly married
[1:01:35] couple that must have been the shortest
[1:01:38] honeymoon in history thank you all for
[1:01:41] being back already
[1:01:42] [Applause]
[1:01:49] takes dedication
[1:01:52] and the desire to be faithful to the
[1:01:55] Lord and to his house to choose to be
[1:01:58] together
[1:01:59] with Saints the day after your wedding
[1:02:02] and we appreciate that so much we only
[1:02:05] call attention to it because we believe
[1:02:08] it's been marked in heaven
[1:02:10] I believe God marks things like this the
[1:02:13] Bible said that there that we know that
[1:02:16] there's a book of of a record a book of
[1:02:18] memory written and uh especially he
[1:02:22] keeps up with those who meet together in
[1:02:24] his name and I believe it pleases the
[1:02:27] heart of the Lord when a couple says may
[1:02:30] not be the easiest thing to do but this
[1:02:32] is what we're going to do and may God
[1:02:34] bless your trip that you're about to
[1:02:36] make your honeymoon may God bless you in
[1:02:38] a wonderful way and be with you and give
[1:02:41] you a great time off work and and I wish
[1:02:44] you could have three months I wish that
[1:02:47] it was possible that you could do that
[1:02:49] but may God let the days that you have
[1:02:51] be a blessing to you what a beautiful
[1:02:53] wedding
[1:02:54] if I I could just say if there's one
[1:02:57] thing New Hope can do right they can do
[1:02:59] a wedding that that was absolutely
[1:03:02] outstanding
[1:03:04] it was put together so beautifully every
[1:03:08] part of that wedding glorified the Lord
[1:03:11] and I sat at the reception with some of
[1:03:14] the best wedding food I have ever eaten
[1:03:17] in my life
[1:03:19] and was so blessed and thankful for it
[1:03:22] and I looked around the room and I
[1:03:24] thought oh I feel like the proudest Papa
[1:03:27] in the room
[1:03:29] to see this great church
[1:03:31] this great family of God
[1:03:34] together loving one another and honoring
[1:03:38] Josiah and Jennifer and their commitment
[1:03:41] to one another so for everything you did
[1:03:44] to make yesterday an absolute amazing
[1:03:47] day I even want to thank the butterflies
[1:03:51] they cooperated
[1:03:54] although many of us were prophesying
[1:03:56] their defeat they took flight
[1:04:00] and we were thankful for that there
[1:04:02] wasn't a bit of sun to be had but they
[1:04:04] they were so glad to be out of that box
[1:04:09] finally I thought to myself they're
[1:04:11] either going to all be dead or they're
[1:04:13] going to fly
[1:04:15] and they flew and the kids couldn't have
[1:04:18] been happier about it I mean that was
[1:04:20] that was very special for them the music
[1:04:23] was wonderful and the anointing and the
[1:04:25] presence of the Lord and and I I don't
[1:04:28] like all those speeches and things that
[1:04:30] that you all kind of brought that here
[1:04:32] from Canada but uh uh you know when I
[1:04:37] was growing up in the South you got a
[1:04:39] piece of cake you got some pastel
[1:04:42] colored mints
[1:04:44] and a bowl of nuts
[1:04:46] and some punch and that was a reception
[1:04:49] but we you get you get mixed in with
[1:04:52] these Canadians and they start bringing
[1:04:54] influence and then everybody wants to
[1:04:56] keep up with the next one and before you
[1:04:58] know it we all got a really nice time
[1:05:01] out of it and even though I'm not fond
[1:05:04] of all those speeches I have to say that
[1:05:06] you all did absolutely outstanding
[1:05:09] yesterday you captured these two and you
[1:05:13] glorified the Lord and you kept the
[1:05:16] jokes to a minimum thank you David and
[1:05:19] uh we just had a great time and better
[1:05:22] than that I got home at 8 30 last night
[1:05:26] that was the only request that I had in
[1:05:29] the in the discussions that I had with
[1:05:31] the couple is have the wedding early
[1:05:33] enough that the reception can be early
[1:05:35] enough that we can get home and some of
[1:05:39] these receptions are like eternity they
[1:05:41] just go on and on and on and on and then
[1:05:44] I'm the one who pays the price the next
[1:05:46] day because I've got a sleeping
[1:05:48] congregation
[1:05:50] uh but at 10 o'clock last night they
[1:05:52] were still in here you may not think
[1:05:55] that that thing is heavy but that that
[1:05:57] rack on this platform is heavy and they
[1:06:00] were taking it down putting everything
[1:06:02] back and you know I never had to worry I
[1:06:06] didn't drive over here today worried
[1:06:08] that something wouldn't be back that
[1:06:10] something wouldn't be done I have that
[1:06:12] much confidence in this church and these
[1:06:15] young people who work so hard that I
[1:06:17] knew that everything would be back
[1:06:19] everything would be clean and everything
[1:06:21] would be in order for the service today
[1:06:23] and I commend all of you for your
[1:06:26] faithfulness to be here what good would
[1:06:29] it do us to be gathered together had he
[1:06:31] not come but he came with his presence
[1:06:34] there was something moving in a deep
[1:06:37] deep place in the spirit today and I
[1:06:41] challenge you not to go home like you
[1:06:43] came you must go home different than
[1:06:46] what you came today you must respond if
[1:06:50] there's a deep calling how many of you
[1:06:52] know there's a deep that has to respond
[1:06:55] and I believe you're carrying that today
[1:06:58] and sister Alfreda maybe you felt a
[1:07:01] little bit out of place but we didn't
[1:07:03] think you were we thought you deserved
[1:07:05] that honor and you looked amazingly
[1:07:09] beautiful
[1:07:10] and not for your age for you you looked
[1:07:14] amazing
[1:07:16] I'm not going to put a tag on there for
[1:07:19] your age because she looked as I'm sorry
[1:07:22] you young ladies she looked as beautiful
[1:07:23] as any of you
[1:07:25] and that is because her life has been
[1:07:28] dedicated for the kingdom of God and to
[1:07:30] his work and I thought what an honor and
[1:07:33] Her speech about friend friendship with
[1:07:36] God it's powerful and that's exactly
[1:07:39] what we saw we saw that friends of God
[1:07:42] enjoy being with friends of God
[1:07:46] and it was just amazing I mean I could
[1:07:48] talk on all day but I don't think you
[1:07:51] want me to just chit chat with you but I
[1:07:54] could because I felt that blessed uh
[1:07:56] they had a lot of food left over and
[1:07:59] they have invited us to have lunch here
[1:08:02] on the campground today and you are
[1:08:04] welcome to do that different ones took
[1:08:06] some home with them and we'll we'll uh
[1:08:09] after the service they will go home and
[1:08:11] heat it up they live close and we'll
[1:08:13] bring it back and we will share uh if it
[1:08:16] would be almost as good as yesterday it
[1:08:19] will be amazing and worth your worth
[1:08:21] your stay
[1:08:23] we may need drinks and may need to some
[1:08:26] send some of you for ice and drinks and
[1:08:28] what have you but if you don't want to
[1:08:31] stay you didn't know about it you don't
[1:08:32] feel like you can we understand but we
[1:08:35] heartily invite you to stay and and just
[1:08:39] spread it out when I heard that they
[1:08:41] were going to be here the Newlywed
[1:08:43] couple would be here this morning I said
[1:08:45] well that's Wonder wonderful it gives us
[1:08:47] a whole nother day to celebrate them and
[1:08:50] to let them know what they mean to us
[1:08:52] and these families I I Jennifer your
[1:08:56] family were they were a pleasure to be
[1:08:58] around we enjoyed them so much your dad
[1:09:00] uh was especially thoughtful he came
[1:09:03] over to my table and he said brother
[1:09:05] Shelley I want to thank you that was
[1:09:07] holy and sacred and you know that's what
[1:09:10] we wanted it to be I looked sometime I
[1:09:13] glance up and I see the faces of the
[1:09:15] visitors and and they're looking like
[1:09:17] wow this is a big deal
[1:09:21] you know they're they're they're signing
[1:09:23] their lives away well they are
[1:09:27] this is a big deal
[1:09:29] you you don't get two or three chances
[1:09:32] you've got to get it right in the
[1:09:34] beginning and you've got to take it
[1:09:35] serious and this couple took it very
[1:09:38] very serious and uh so anyway his
[1:09:42] presence was with us and I I'm so
[1:09:45] thankful for that and uh we are looking
[1:09:47] forward to camp meeting I got the
[1:09:50] arrival uh itinerary for Brother Juan
[1:09:53] arnoldus which by the way his birthday
[1:09:55] is today and uh they were coming from
[1:09:59] South Africa it was a 20-year dream of
[1:10:02] theirs to attend our camp meeting and we
[1:10:05] have no we've been in touch with them
[1:10:07] for a little over 20 years and never met
[1:10:09] them face to face and what a joy and and
[1:10:13] then the Lord began to deal with our
[1:10:15] heart and we knew that he was to have a
[1:10:17] part in these meetings I don't know what
[1:10:20] the Lord is going to do but I sensed all
[1:10:23] over again this morning when that deep
[1:10:26] spirit of God was moving
[1:10:32] oh it's almost so deep in my spiritual
[1:10:36] belly that the body doesn't have time to
[1:10:39] react it's like a groaning uh uh a
[1:10:44] roaring
[1:10:46] I might get happy now like a roaring and
[1:10:51] and if you'll ever you really I
[1:10:52] encourage you not to look at other
[1:10:54] people
[1:10:55] when you're in a moment like that but to
[1:10:57] look to the Lord but I'm a pastor and a
[1:11:00] papa and I look around at other people
[1:11:02] sometime and I want you to know you look
[1:11:06] perfect
[1:11:08] I forget all of you that I know about
[1:11:14] all of your Hang-Ups
[1:11:17] all of your idiosyncrasies and do you
[1:11:20] ever have a lot of them
[1:11:22] I forget all of that
[1:11:25] because when that presence of the Lord
[1:11:27] comes you're as perfect in his presence
[1:11:30] in his sight as you're ever going to be
[1:11:34] when sister Peterson wrote that song so
[1:11:38] many years ago it has ministered to me
[1:11:42] countless times through the years oh
[1:11:45] praise the lord it's Jesus that I see
[1:11:48] the son of man revealed in you and me
[1:11:52] I'm so glad that I'm part of the family
[1:11:55] where the people of God are perfect as
[1:11:59] can be when you get under that blood
[1:12:02] filter and you get in the presence of
[1:12:05] the Lamb you're just as perfect as you
[1:12:07] are ever going to be in this life if you
[1:12:10] believe that same man well I'm going to
[1:12:13] sing a song no one else turned in a song
[1:12:16] so I'm going to sing a song
[1:12:24] I didn't know that my little dance with
[1:12:26] the children was was captured
[1:12:29] it wasn't pretty but it was sincere
[1:12:33] I was thankful to be able to have the
[1:12:36] strength to do it
[1:12:38] I thought the dancing was beautiful
[1:12:40] I I there was a lot of a lot of concern
[1:12:43] about how to pull it off with a mixed
[1:12:45] crowd and different thought it was it
[1:12:47] was perfect and and I know there were
[1:12:50] some of you that got up and celebrated
[1:12:52] in the in the in the Jewish dance that
[1:12:54] that's not your cup of tea that's not
[1:12:56] your thing but you did it anyway to make
[1:12:59] it special and I believe God was
[1:13:01] glorified that's why we dance we dance
[1:13:04] because we have something to dance about
[1:13:07] amen we weren't doing the Boogie
[1:13:10] I didn't see any discoing going on we
[1:13:13] don't do like that I didn't see any slow
[1:13:15] dances or Waltz either
[1:13:17] but I tell you I but I will say one
[1:13:20] carnal thing I believe that Jennifer and
[1:13:22] Josiah have practiced
[1:13:26] no response out of either one of them
[1:13:28] except except big eyes from Josiah
[1:13:31] uh no you didn't you didn't practice
[1:13:33] because it sure looked like it I would I
[1:13:36] hope somebody captured when you all were
[1:13:38] in the center and the and the folks were
[1:13:40] dancing around you it was beautiful it
[1:13:42] was Precision well God is good
[1:13:45] any good
[1:13:46] well I had a song in my mind but I
[1:13:48] forgot what it was
[1:13:52] not awful
[1:13:55] why are you folks getting so old
[1:14:00] oh He Didn't Throw the Clay Away
[1:14:04] this was Sister Tebow song
[1:14:07] she loved this song
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:18] I came back to him
[1:14:23] a vessel unworthy
[1:14:28] I was so scarred
[1:14:31] by sin
[1:14:34] but he did not
[1:14:37] despair
[1:14:39] he started over
[1:14:42] again
[1:14:44] and I bless the day
[1:14:49] he didn't throw
[1:14:52] the Clay Away
[1:14:55] [Music]

[1:18:46] a vessel
[1:18:50] unworthy I was so scarred

[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:11] and it's all
[1:20:14] because Jesus
[1:20:17] Didn't Throw the Clay Away
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:33] aren't you glad you didn't do it
[1:20:37] would you give these musicians and
[1:20:39] worship leaders been
[1:20:41] outstanding job
[1:20:43] what a blessing
[1:20:48] turn to Isaiah 54 one more service
[1:20:53] where this is our theme
[1:20:55] Isaiah 54 and verse 16 and 17 in the
[1:21:01] Amplified Bible we'll just go right
[1:21:03] there since we have already read it in
[1:21:04] the King James
[1:21:06] but no weapon
[1:21:11] no weapon
[1:21:13] now notice he didn't say it wouldn't be
[1:21:16] formed
[1:21:17] it it's like that verse that says and
[1:21:20] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:21:23] against it it didn't say they wouldn't
[1:21:25] March against it it said they wouldn't
[1:21:28] win how many of you know the Gates of
[1:21:31] Hell will never win against your life
[1:21:33] praise God and the promise is no weapon
[1:21:38] that is formed against you shall prosper
[1:21:41] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:21:44] you in judgment you shall show to be in
[1:21:47] the wrong
[1:21:49] the peace righteousness security triumph
[1:21:53] over opposition is
[1:21:56] the heritage of the Servants of the Lord
[1:22:02] those in whom this is so important those
[1:22:07] in whom the ideal servant mashiach
[1:22:11] that ideal servant of the Lord is
[1:22:14] reproduced those in whom the ideal
[1:22:18] servant of the Lord is reproduced
[1:22:22] This Is the destiny of the bride of
[1:22:26] Christ we are here in the earth to
[1:22:30] reproduce the life of Messiah
[1:22:35] it is our calling and we have everything
[1:22:38] we need to reproduce Jesus in the Earth
[1:22:42] because we have the seed of God and the
[1:22:46] seed of God has come to life as the son
[1:22:51] not s-u-n that's Catholicism
[1:22:54] s-o-n has risen in our lives and the son
[1:22:59] has drawn out the germ that life that is
[1:23:02] in the seed it has caught there has been
[1:23:05] some dying of the outer shell
[1:23:08] there's been some dying off of the outer
[1:23:11] shell so that the germ of Life the
[1:23:13] kernel of Life inside the seed could
[1:23:16] come forth and not only sprout
[1:23:19] but that it might come into Union with
[1:23:23] the very nature of God that the very
[1:23:25] nature of God be duplicated in the life
[1:23:27] of the believer now that's not Church
[1:23:30] entity folks that's not denominational
[1:23:33] Christianity people oh no that is Bridal
[1:23:37] Paradigm it's the sons of God coming
[1:23:40] forth in the last day all of creation is
[1:23:43] groaning
[1:23:45] the Earth beneath our feet the heavens
[1:23:48] above our head groaning for the
[1:23:50] manifestation
[1:23:52] of the sons of God oh Hallelujah that is
[1:23:56] the righteousness or the Vindication
[1:23:59] which they obtain from me this is that
[1:24:03] this is so wonderful this is that which
[1:24:06] I impart to them as their justification
[1:24:09] do you know what your justification is
[1:24:12] it's imparted righteousness
[1:24:14] it's the imparted righteous you could
[1:24:17] not keep the law
[1:24:20] there is no Temple
[1:24:22] that means that quite a few of the over
[1:24:25] 600 Commandments could never be kept in
[1:24:28] this day because we have no Temple and
[1:24:31] there's no need to keep all of those
[1:24:33] Commandments that that apply to
[1:24:36] sacrificial system that which applies to
[1:24:38] the offering system because we have no
[1:24:41] Temple but there is something that we
[1:24:43] receive that is a gift to us if we abide
[1:24:47] in the word if we abide in him and he
[1:24:49] abides in us he imparts
[1:24:52] he imparts to us a righteousness that
[1:24:56] says You Are Holy
[1:24:58] you are acceptable
[1:25:01] you are redeemed and my Guiltless
[1:25:05] blameless
[1:25:07] now I want you to know when you start
[1:25:09] singing like you sung this morning and
[1:25:11] you begin to realize that's who you are
[1:25:14] I will never leave you
[1:25:16] I will never forsake you
[1:25:19] I'm right where you are did you hear the
[1:25:21] words of that I'm right where you are
[1:25:25] the righteous God is among us today he's
[1:25:28] here with us
[1:25:30] and when we leave here we're taking him
[1:25:33] with us and he's going to meet us
[1:25:35] tomorrow
[1:25:37] he'll be with us even to the end so come
[1:25:41] what may in the streets of this nation
[1:25:43] Our God will never leave us
[1:25:46] he will never forsake us now Lord we
[1:25:49] approach your word with fear and with
[1:25:52] trembling we didn't just come to hear a
[1:25:55] lecture we came to hear from you and I
[1:26:01] pray that your anointing and your glory
[1:26:04] will fill this place as your word Goes
[1:26:08] Forth in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:11] Christ we pray and the Saints said
[1:26:15] you may be seated turn around and wave
[1:26:18] at the sound booth and wish charity a
[1:26:21] happy birthday today
[1:26:25] happy birthday
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:28] today on Tuesday of this week Wesley
[1:26:32] Miller has a birthday and we've been
[1:26:34] remembering him in prayer because of the
[1:26:37] prayer request that was turned in on the
[1:26:39] app for him already but let's remember
[1:26:42] him especially this week and then on
[1:26:45] Wednesday he's out but on Wednesday Ben
[1:26:48] Ellsworth has a birthday so let's wish
[1:26:51] him a happy birthday as well
[1:26:55] it has been said that you are Your Own
[1:26:59] Worst Enemy
[1:27:01] and if that be the case then if God's
[1:27:05] word says no weapon formed against you
[1:27:07] shall prosper that means that even you
[1:27:10] are not going to be successful in
[1:27:12] forming a weapon against yourself
[1:27:15] he's going to come to the rescue he's
[1:27:17] going to correct your thinking he's
[1:27:19] going to let you come under some
[1:27:20] teaching he's going to speak to you out
[1:27:23] of his word so that you will learn
[1:27:25] strategy to stop being Your Own Worst
[1:27:28] Enemy you know I could hear the spirit
[1:27:31] of the Lord saying this morning get out
[1:27:33] of my way get out of my way get out of
[1:27:36] my way you're just in my way
[1:27:38] and I want you just to get out of my way
[1:27:41] so I can have my way
[1:27:44] it's a yielding it's a yielding process
[1:27:47] that we're in we're learning we're
[1:27:50] learning and we're yearning to yield to
[1:27:53] the Lord how many of you want him to
[1:27:56] have the right of way in your life then
[1:27:58] you're going to have to turn loose so
[1:27:59] some of your stinking thinking
[1:28:02] you're going to have to go to what the
[1:28:03] scripture talks about in Tuesday night
[1:28:06] we we looked at this verse in
[1:28:08] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 8 if
[1:28:11] you'll put it up again we learned last
[1:28:14] week that that science is currently
[1:28:18] telling us
[1:28:19] that there are three T's that cause
[1:28:23] disease and they're telling us that
[1:28:26] between 75 and 98 of all current mental
[1:28:32] physical and emotional even behavioral
[1:28:35] illnesses today are are a product of
[1:28:39] your thought life
[1:28:41] now does anybody stagger at the hugeness
[1:28:44] of the number
[1:28:45] 75 to 98 percent of all current mental
[1:28:49] physical emotional and behavioral
[1:28:51] illnesses today come from thought life
[1:28:54] so it seems that we have been quite
[1:28:57] concerned about toxins and poisons and
[1:29:00] we should be because our bodies are
[1:29:04] being bombarded in the world that we
[1:29:06] live in today with all kinds of
[1:29:07] chemicals that were never designed to
[1:29:10] come in contact with the human body
[1:29:12] and we slather them on our skin which is
[1:29:15] the largest organ of our body and uh
[1:29:19] because of the of the miracle of being
[1:29:22] able to receive something that way
[1:29:24] subcutaneously
[1:29:25] we are actually poisoning ourselves with
[1:29:30] all kinds of if you don't don't read the
[1:29:33] ingredients if you don't want to know
[1:29:36] right
[1:29:38] have you seen that label going around of
[1:29:41] of the genetic of the genetically
[1:29:43] modified ingredients in Bluebell
[1:29:51] isn't that funny you can't even get an
[1:29:54] amen out of this ice cream eaten bunch
[1:29:58] I know it's your favorite and I know
[1:30:00] it's the nectar of the Gods
[1:30:09] I know I'd lose church members if I
[1:30:12] started preaching against Bluebell
[1:30:14] but you'd just be shocked
[1:30:17] even the Beloved Chick-fil-A
[1:30:22] I'm thankful that Zaxby's is even worse
[1:30:24] than that
[1:30:27] if you start reading the ingredients
[1:30:29] that they used to season the things
[1:30:32] to give it flavor but the reality is
[1:30:35] that only 2 to 25 percent
[1:30:38] of all diseases
[1:30:41] whatever mental physical emotional
[1:30:44] Behavior it's only 2 to 25 percent that
[1:30:47] actually comes from toxins and Trauma
[1:30:50] the the three T's thoughts toxins trauma
[1:30:54] so the biggest part of this ease in the
[1:30:58] body is because of the way we think
[1:31:02] I tell you that really is a blessing to
[1:31:04] know
[1:31:05] because that means I can improve my
[1:31:08] physical health my mental health my
[1:31:11] emotional health and even my behavioral
[1:31:13] problems
[1:31:14] and not only children have them
[1:31:17] adults can have behavioral problems too
[1:31:19] I can do something about that
[1:31:22] even if I can't afford the most
[1:31:24] expensive doctors in the world
[1:31:27] I get people who write me often who want
[1:31:29] me to fly to to a doctor in Florida who
[1:31:32] or who want me to fly to a doctor in New
[1:31:35] York City because they care about me and
[1:31:37] they want me to be able to get some of
[1:31:39] the pain under control and even if I had
[1:31:41] the kind of money that it would take to
[1:31:43] do something like that I have the grace
[1:31:46] of God to know that I can change a lot
[1:31:48] of things in my body by changing my
[1:31:51] thought life
[1:31:52] the scripture said finally Brethren
[1:31:55] whatsoever Things Are
[1:31:56] true whatsoever things are honest
[1:32:00] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:32:03] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:32:05] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[1:32:09] report if there be any virtue power and
[1:32:13] if there be any praise think
[1:32:16] amen thank
[1:32:22] on these things
[1:32:25] did you know that that the average
[1:32:27] person has at least 35
[1:32:29] 000 thoughts a day
[1:32:31] and for some people it's even higher
[1:32:33] than that it goes up over a hundred
[1:32:35] thousand and did you know that of the 35
[1:32:38] 000 thoughts that you're going to think
[1:32:40] today around 97 of those thoughts are
[1:32:43] the same ones you used yesterday
[1:32:47] so we're not very original thinkers
[1:32:50] hello we just keep thinking the same
[1:32:53] negative junk over and over and over and
[1:32:56] over again
[1:32:57] now when I say thoughts I don't mean the
[1:33:00] automatic program behaviors like
[1:33:01] brushing our teeth you don't have to
[1:33:04] tell yourself or think about what the
[1:33:06] next step is when you're brushing your
[1:33:08] teeth you just grab the toothpaste you
[1:33:10] you just go about I'm going to brush my
[1:33:12] and you do those are not the kind of
[1:33:14] thoughts we're talking about we're
[1:33:16] talking we're talking about thoughts
[1:33:17] that we just bring into our mind
[1:33:20] and most of them are the same thoughts
[1:33:22] that you thought yesterday and if you're
[1:33:25] not seeing change in your life you've
[1:33:27] got to think for change
[1:33:29] hello
[1:33:32] what you hear directly affects what you
[1:33:35] think
[1:33:36] so you've got to be careful what you're
[1:33:38] listening to look this way and help me
[1:33:40] preach
[1:33:41] somebody said well that's not the
[1:33:43] scripture what you're preaching now
[1:33:45] you're just trying to give us some good
[1:33:46] positive advice I want you to know the
[1:33:48] Bible is full of this
[1:33:50] and the message of the hour is full of
[1:33:53] this I want you to know that brother
[1:33:55] Branham preached more on the mind and
[1:33:57] the thought life probably than any other
[1:33:59] subject
[1:34:01] we have several hundred pages of notes
[1:34:04] and quotations of brother Branham
[1:34:07] talking about the attitude
[1:34:09] and the mind and the ability that we
[1:34:12] have to change our circumstances by
[1:34:14] changing our thinking
[1:34:16] and he tells us that that there's a
[1:34:19] great battle and the greatest battle
[1:34:21] ever fought is fought not on the
[1:34:23] Battlegrounds of of of world dominions
[1:34:26] and Powers but he said the greatest
[1:34:29] battle that a man ever ever fights is
[1:34:31] the one in his own mind
[1:34:34] so if you and I could get a hold of
[1:34:36] these thoughts and we could bring them
[1:34:39] into subjection to the truth of God's
[1:34:42] word if we could start wiring out the
[1:34:46] negativity bias
[1:34:48] and start wiring in thoughts of faith
[1:34:51] and virtue and lovely thoughts and
[1:34:54] Powerful thoughts and true thoughts and
[1:34:57] honest thoughts we could burn out the
[1:35:00] rest
[1:35:02] how many of you want some new dendrites
[1:35:05] to form in your mind you want some
[1:35:07] healthy trees you want to get rid of
[1:35:10] some of those gnarled and twisted
[1:35:12] thoughts so if you will put some extra
[1:35:16] effort into thinking right and working
[1:35:20] on grubbing out and digging out the old
[1:35:23] paradigms that you keep repeating the
[1:35:27] behavior that you keep repeating you
[1:35:29] will absolutely see the scripture come
[1:35:31] to pass in your life no weapon
[1:35:33] even my thought life is a weapon that
[1:35:37] the enemy tries to form against me and
[1:35:40] as long as I'm cooperating he's going to
[1:35:42] drag that process out just as long as he
[1:35:46] absolutely can I want to I want somebody
[1:35:48] in this church to catch a positivity
[1:35:51] bias
[1:35:52] I want you to be biased
[1:35:57] you know that the world says you
[1:35:59] shouldn't be biased
[1:36:01] shouldn't be bigoted
[1:36:02] the world says you shouldn't you should
[1:36:06] be tolerant and you should be this
[1:36:07] another but I want to tell you I want
[1:36:09] you to have a bias
[1:36:11] I want my children to have a bias I want
[1:36:14] it to be to a Prejudice but I want it to
[1:36:17] be toward the word of God I wanted to be
[1:36:20] a positivity bias instead of a
[1:36:23] negativity bias you can do this I'm
[1:36:27] telling you today you can do this
[1:36:30] you can win this battle
[1:36:33] and how do we win it one thought at a
[1:36:35] time
[1:36:39] if you sat in that room yesterday and
[1:36:41] looked around and saw everybody else's
[1:36:43] faults
[1:36:44] you've got a negativity bias
[1:36:47] you need to pull that thing down plunge
[1:36:50] it under the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:36:53] catch a quick glimpse of God's people
[1:36:55] with imputed righteousness on their head
[1:36:59] I am not a perfect man but you don't
[1:37:02] know it
[1:37:04] think you know it but you don't know it
[1:37:07] because imputed righteousness is on my
[1:37:09] head
[1:37:11] and so a lot of what you think about me
[1:37:13] is a lie
[1:37:15] a lot of what we think about each other
[1:37:17] is a lie because we like to brag I
[1:37:20] really know I know what she said but I
[1:37:22] know what she meant I know what he said
[1:37:24] but I know what he meant you don't know
[1:37:27] nothing
[1:37:30] you're in a church this morning with a
[1:37:33] bunch of people that are walking around
[1:37:34] with the imputed righteousness of God on
[1:37:37] their head and when we stray he reminds
[1:37:40] us
[1:37:41] come on when we fail he convicts us
[1:37:45] and we repent and we don't lay all night
[1:37:47] in the altar to repent because we know
[1:37:50] who we are
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:53] I'm always with you
[1:37:56] he said I'm with you to the end of the
[1:37:58] Earth
[1:37:59] he always desires to stay close to us
[1:38:03] and help us with the problems of Life do
[1:38:06] you believe that nothing is more
[1:38:08] contagious than negativity
[1:38:11] I want to I want to read the quote that
[1:38:13] we had Tuesday night and then we're
[1:38:15] going on to something else
[1:38:18] brother banham he said here's an old
[1:38:19] slogan I want you to remember it it's
[1:38:21] testimony raising the dead boy it's the
[1:38:25] name of the sermon
[1:38:26] he said here's an old slogan I want you
[1:38:28] to remember do right that's your duty to
[1:38:31] God think right that's your duty to
[1:38:33] yourself and you're bound to be right
[1:38:36] I like to put it in the order that it
[1:38:38] was spoken think right that's your duty
[1:38:41] to yourself do right that's your duty to
[1:38:44] God and you're bound to be right now
[1:38:48] brother banham is telling us that that
[1:38:50] our thinking determines our doing
[1:38:53] that's right
[1:38:55] that's right because the Bible said as
[1:38:57] the man thinketh in his heart
[1:39:00] so he is
[1:39:01] so is he so you've got to think of
[1:39:04] yourself as an overcomer and you've got
[1:39:07] to think of yourself as someone who
[1:39:09] cannot survive one second without the
[1:39:13] blood of Jesus
[1:39:15] Oh The Blood the blood the blood I've
[1:39:17] got to have the blood I've got to have a
[1:39:20] life
[1:39:21] that's in the blood
[1:39:23] I've got to have it over me I've got to
[1:39:25] recognize this righteousness that's been
[1:39:28] put on my head and I've got to do my
[1:39:30] part in living a life of surrendered
[1:39:33] obedience in fact we have to do what I
[1:39:36] heard the spirit of God saying today
[1:39:37] we've got to get out of his way
[1:39:41] I want you to look at your neighbor I
[1:39:42] know how you hate doing that that's why
[1:39:44] I keep asking you to do it
[1:39:46] I want to break you out of that old
[1:39:48] cycle I want you to look at your
[1:39:50] neighbor and I want you to say get out
[1:39:52] do it just just do it do it with a
[1:39:54] little somebody do it with a head shake
[1:39:58] get out of God's way come on
[1:40:05] get out of God's way
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:12] do what
[1:40:14] get out of God's way and fast
[1:40:16] well you fast today
[1:40:19] [Applause]
[1:40:25] somebody can have Austin's but oh no you
[1:40:28] bit speed
[1:40:32] you met quickly
[1:40:35] do it as fast as you possibly can get
[1:40:39] out
[1:40:40] of God's way
[1:40:42] I want to tell you something you've only
[1:40:43] got October November and December to get
[1:40:46] out of God's way
[1:40:47] will you take that as a challenge
[1:40:50] because we're coming to the end of a
[1:40:52] supernatural year
[1:40:57] and I know that God has already done
[1:40:59] some outstanding and Supernatural things
[1:41:01] I know the camels that we've been
[1:41:04] praying for for about 10 years finally
[1:41:06] started showing up
[1:41:08] amen provision and finance finally
[1:41:11] started showing up
[1:41:13] I thought when the projectors were going
[1:41:15] crazy earlier in the service I thought
[1:41:17] uh oh we're fixing to have to put in a
[1:41:19] big screen up there to take care of this
[1:41:21] problem because these projectors are as
[1:41:23] old as the church building
[1:41:25] and they're not going to last forever
[1:41:27] and they were a pretty penny when we put
[1:41:30] them in and eventually we're going to
[1:41:32] have to do something else but you know
[1:41:33] what we know how to call in the camels
[1:41:38] you just got to realize they don't
[1:41:39] always show up when you expect them
[1:41:42] but they come and I'm telling you
[1:41:44] there's more on the way
[1:41:46] because God's going to provide his he's
[1:41:48] listen he's going to make provision for
[1:41:52] the vision that's what God does
[1:41:56] and he's going to do that in your life
[1:41:59] as an individual if you will keep
[1:42:01] faithful Covenant with him he's going to
[1:42:05] show up for you with provision
[1:42:09] for the vision God is not responsible or
[1:42:13] obligated to finance my own ideas
[1:42:18] but he is responsible and obligated to
[1:42:23] finance
[1:42:25] and to provide for his own ideas
[1:42:30] and he will
[1:42:32] and you're going to see it so utilize
[1:42:34] October we got a couple more weeks of
[1:42:37] September utilize October November in
[1:42:40] December to get rid of
[1:42:43] whatever it is that keeps you standing
[1:42:47] in God's way
[1:42:48] you know it's really a shame that God
[1:42:50] has to get me out of the way before he
[1:42:51] can move
[1:42:54] what a shame that he has to bother with
[1:42:57] that process of moving me shouldn't I
[1:42:59] recognize when I'm not in his way when
[1:43:02] I'm in his way when I'm not in his will
[1:43:04] should not be able to recognize that on
[1:43:06] my own and move myself
[1:43:08] I'm preaching to the church today
[1:43:12] Hallelujah
[1:43:14] amen I should be able to recognize it so
[1:43:17] we think right that's our duty to
[1:43:19] ourself we do right that's our duty to
[1:43:22] God and then we're bound to be right
[1:43:23] everything else about you is bound to
[1:43:27] turn out right
[1:43:28] if you think right and do right somebody
[1:43:31] said that's not easily done no but you
[1:43:33] have everything you need provided for
[1:43:36] you to be able to do it by the imputed
[1:43:39] righteousness of Jesus Christ if you
[1:43:41] believe that same man the enemy is
[1:43:43] constantly trying to disturb our peace
[1:43:45] and we close we close with Isaiah 26 3
[1:43:48] Tuesday night thou will keep him in
[1:43:50] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:43:53] thee
[1:43:54] because he trusteth in thee if you're
[1:43:56] always looking at your circumstances
[1:43:58] you'll miss your God
[1:44:00] if you're looking at the bigness of your
[1:44:02] problem you'll miss the greatness of
[1:44:04] your God if you believe that same man
[1:44:07] now punch your neighbor and tell them
[1:44:09] sleep later
[1:44:11] this time doesn't belong to you come on
[1:44:13] do it
[1:44:15] this time doesn't belong to you this is
[1:44:17] God's time
[1:44:19] so one of the ways that we become a
[1:44:21] weapon against ourselves is the way we
[1:44:23] think number two one of the ways that we
[1:44:26] become a weapon against ourselves is by
[1:44:28] carrying offense
[1:44:32] he offended me
[1:44:35] you know I don't mean to make light but
[1:44:37] sometimes I just want to say whoopee do
[1:44:40] I do I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:44:43] sometimes I do
[1:44:45] sometimes I just want to say okay big
[1:44:48] whoop
[1:44:50] happens all the time and whether you
[1:44:53] realize it or not you've offended half
[1:44:55] the crowd
[1:45:01] thank you thank you I believe I will
[1:45:06] then we have a little Jew juice here and
[1:45:08] see if something
[1:45:13] a fan I'm offended he hurt my feelings
[1:45:18] she hurt my feelings
[1:45:20] oh
[1:45:21] I'm ready to be paid for my feelings
[1:45:23] being heard aren't you I've had mine
[1:45:26] hurt so many times I'm I'm I'm standing
[1:45:29] in line for the payday
[1:45:32] If We Hold The Grudge
[1:45:35] we're holding ourselves in limitation
[1:45:40] if we're holding a grudge we're in God's
[1:45:42] way
[1:45:43] punch your neighbor somebody's trying to
[1:45:45] sleep
[1:45:51] Psalm 119 165.
[1:45:57] great peace
[1:46:00] great peace say it with me great peace
[1:46:03] great shalom
[1:46:05] have they which love thy law and
[1:46:14] you fall in love with God's word
[1:46:18] you fall in love with God's word and
[1:46:20] that's going to matter more than anybody
[1:46:22] else's opinion more than anybody else's
[1:46:25] Behavior
[1:46:30] I had to deal with this last night
[1:46:34] when I got home and realized that Chad
[1:46:36] Jernigan
[1:46:39] had not spoken to me
[1:46:43] at the wedding yesterday
[1:46:47] he just strut it in
[1:46:51] as only he can
[1:46:54] and strut it out
[1:46:58] and I was so offended
[1:47:02] that I realized I was going to lose
[1:47:04] sleep over that
[1:47:07] if I didn't let that thing go
[1:47:11] so I just read his thoughts
[1:47:15] and he was thinking pastor's busy so I
[1:47:18] won't go over there and he's he's
[1:47:19] stalking other I won't I won't say
[1:47:21] anything and you know what I just let
[1:47:23] all my offense go
[1:47:25] until this morning when he strutted in
[1:47:28] my office
[1:47:29] and I said hey you come to repent didn't
[1:47:32] you
[1:47:35] now I'm being silly
[1:47:37] and I'm making a joke but don't you act
[1:47:41] like you don't go home from church
[1:47:42] sometime
[1:47:46] thinking some stupid thought like that
[1:47:53] why she shook everybody's hand in the
[1:47:56] room but mine
[1:47:58] now I'm going to tell you she ought not
[1:47:59] to done that but but do you want to put
[1:48:02] her in a box so that she can't shake
[1:48:04] anybody's hand because she's afraid she
[1:48:07] might miss somebody
[1:48:08] you don't want to box her in
[1:48:12] you don't want to try to control
[1:48:14] somebody's nature in the way they are
[1:48:17] if I A lot of times when I walk in a
[1:48:19] room uh I I I feel so listen I told the
[1:48:24] brothers the other night we went to
[1:48:26] celebrate Josiah at the restaurant and
[1:48:29] it was kind of crowded in there and any
[1:48:31] of you who have this little uh oddness
[1:48:34] about you when I'm in a crowd I
[1:48:37] automatically feel like I weigh 500
[1:48:39] pounds
[1:48:41] it's just something that happens to
[1:48:44] large people I guess
[1:48:46] a fluffy extra fluffy people
[1:48:49] and you just all of a sudden feel like
[1:48:51] you're the fattest biggest largest
[1:48:53] person in the room and you'll never be
[1:48:56] you know everybody's going to be looking
[1:48:58] at you and you're ever always in
[1:48:59] somebody's way and you're always excuse
[1:49:02] me I'm sorry excuse me let me sorry
[1:49:03] sorry so when I am in a situation like
[1:49:07] that sometimes I just sit down
[1:49:10] and I'm not particularly choosing who's
[1:49:12] sitting with me or who I'm sitting with
[1:49:14] I'm just getting out of people's way now
[1:49:16] I know that I weigh a few pounds shy of
[1:49:19] that
[1:49:22] and I know that I'm not always the
[1:49:24] largest person in the room but it's a
[1:49:26] mentality I'm telling you mine
[1:49:30] don't want to hear yours
[1:49:34] I'm telling you mine because we can
[1:49:37] think the dumbest things
[1:49:40] and and thank God I don't carry it a
[1:49:43] step further like some people do I won't
[1:49:44] even go there won't be room for me
[1:49:50] the chair won't hold me or whatever else
[1:49:52] will get in your mind you cannot let
[1:49:55] something like that keep you from
[1:49:58] fellowshipping with the Saints
[1:50:00] I I get nervous in a crowd
[1:50:04] my wife will tell you if I don't have an
[1:50:07] assigned seat I get very nervous
[1:50:11] because I don't want to take somebody
[1:50:13] else's spot
[1:50:15] I don't need a special spot I just need
[1:50:18] a place that I know I'm supposed to be
[1:50:21] so I try to get there as quick as I can
[1:50:24] and sit down
[1:50:26] and it's not that I don't want to move
[1:50:28] around the room and fellowship with
[1:50:29] people it's just one of my own little
[1:50:33] careful what you say one of my own
[1:50:35] little
[1:50:37] quirks that's the best thing I can think
[1:50:39] of you are entitled to yours I'm
[1:50:42] entitled to mine until we let it hinder
[1:50:45] us
[1:50:46] from boot doing and being what God has
[1:50:49] called us to be
[1:50:51] so if if something happened yesterday
[1:50:53] that you didn't get recognized enough or
[1:50:57] or or or I didn't shake your hand or let
[1:51:01] me ask you a question who who in this
[1:51:03] room did Chad Jernigan Shake Your Hand
[1:51:08] hahaha
[1:51:20] thank you
[1:51:22] I am devastated
[1:51:29] great peace I have
[1:51:33] I love the law of God
[1:51:35] and nobody
[1:51:37] is going to offend me
[1:51:41] nobody wants that
[1:51:44] you don't want to carry that kind of
[1:51:46] thing from day to day to day
[1:51:52] my my wife
[1:51:54] she's a little bit of an odd creature
[1:51:57] you can laugh
[1:52:01] she gets something on her mind
[1:52:14] oh my goodness you people
[1:52:19] was I bragging on you all earlier
[1:52:24] it had to be a man that did that
[1:52:29] I am so offended
[1:52:31] by whoever put that backwards
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:38] now we're making light you're at least
[1:52:40] you're awake now
[1:52:43] we're making light but you know what the
[1:52:45] enemy can do
[1:52:47] with an offense
[1:52:50] it turns out that you get your feelings
[1:52:53] hurt
[1:52:54] and that hurt takes root in you and you
[1:52:58] start filtering everything out of that
[1:53:01] hurt and out of that wounded place and
[1:53:05] therefore people can never win with you
[1:53:09] because you've already stacked
[1:53:11] everything against them
[1:53:17] I got to a place where I was quite tired
[1:53:19] we had an elderly sister here who was
[1:53:22] always saying to my wife uh uh well
[1:53:26] you finally shook my hand
[1:53:30] and one day I caught her to the side
[1:53:33] and I said we honor you and respect you
[1:53:37] as a senior but that's my wife
[1:53:41] what you need to do is go and shake her
[1:53:43] hand
[1:53:44] you need to go greet her instead of
[1:53:47] getting your feelings hurt if she misses
[1:53:50] you in the crowd and who in the world
[1:53:53] would try to mend offense or to make a
[1:53:57] relationship by looking at somebody in
[1:54:00] the face and saying oh
[1:54:03] it's like brother Tremaine meeting
[1:54:05] people at the door we had to stop him
[1:54:09] because he would meet people at the door
[1:54:11] and what he meant to say was we have
[1:54:14] really missed you
[1:54:17] that's what he meant but what he ended
[1:54:20] up saying
[1:54:22] where have you been
[1:54:26] and we had to stop him
[1:54:28] we had to say brother Tremaine you
[1:54:30] cannot welcome people to church
[1:54:34] by telling where have you been well we
[1:54:38] hadn't seen you in the Month of Sundays
[1:54:40] now you and I knew him and loved him and
[1:54:43] we could interpret
[1:54:48] but if someone is already feeling bad
[1:54:50] about missing some Services the last
[1:54:53] thing they want is somebody at the front
[1:54:55] door saying huh you showed up finally
[1:54:58] did you well even
[1:55:00] no no no no no no that's not the way to
[1:55:03] approach somebody
[1:55:05] if you want a man then you want to heal
[1:55:08] and you want to make whole how many of
[1:55:10] you want to fill in the holes
[1:55:13] may God anoint you to be a whole filler
[1:55:16] and a gap stander
[1:55:19] somebody who wants to draw and Pull and
[1:55:24] this was kind of Jennifer this was kind
[1:55:26] of the kind of her name this was kind of
[1:55:28] what her name symbolizes someone who
[1:55:31] wants to pull things pull people
[1:55:32] together and this is really our nature
[1:55:36] otherwise we we get bogged down with
[1:55:40] with offense
[1:55:42] with hurt feet or I feel you I won't
[1:55:45] tell you I feel some of you
[1:55:47] I feel you right now and some of you are
[1:55:50] thinking you know I just don't
[1:55:51] appreciate my feelings not being
[1:55:53] validated
[1:55:55] well when I look at my job description
[1:56:01] I never read the phrase
[1:56:03] about it being my responsibility
[1:56:06] to validate your feeling
[1:56:10] it is my responsibility to warn you
[1:56:14] that if we don't get rid of offenses
[1:56:18] and we don't get rid of grudges we're
[1:56:21] going to stop the flow
[1:56:23] how many of you want to open up The
[1:56:25] Floodgate
[1:56:28] Hebrews 12 15 tells us this looking
[1:56:31] diligently
[1:56:33] lest any man fail of the grace of God
[1:56:39] lest any read it for me
[1:56:42] root of bitterness
[1:56:45] springing up
[1:56:47] trouble you and thereby many
[1:56:55] be defiled
[1:56:59] if we allow a root of bitterness to
[1:57:02] produce a crop
[1:57:04] it's not just our life are you with me
[1:57:07] today
[1:57:10] you see there's women who've had a bad
[1:57:13] marriage
[1:57:15] who decide that all men are dogs you're
[1:57:18] wrong
[1:57:22] all men are not dogs
[1:57:25] you see men who have bad experiences
[1:57:27] with women and they think all women are
[1:57:30] cheap and can't be trusted you're wrong
[1:57:33] you're basing life and the opinions of
[1:57:36] your life on some things that you've
[1:57:38] been through which proves that there's
[1:57:40] still a root
[1:57:45] there's something wrong you you've been
[1:57:47] mistreated and let down by preachers or
[1:57:50] other churches so you come here
[1:57:52] expecting that it's going to happen
[1:57:54] again the problem with that kind of
[1:57:56] attitude is you create situations
[1:58:01] with your bitterness that cause
[1:58:04] circumstances to align with your
[1:58:07] expectation
[1:58:12] because the law of attraction is really
[1:58:14] something that operates
[1:58:17] and we not only attract with our
[1:58:20] personality but sometimes we attract
[1:58:22] negativity
[1:58:27] with our distrust we attract other
[1:58:29] people who have trust issues
[1:58:33] the next thing you know we form a little
[1:58:36] league
[1:58:38] around our root of bitterness
[1:58:41] shutting other people out
[1:58:44] while spreading our poison Undercover
[1:58:48] hello
[1:58:50] that word bitterness that's in front of
[1:58:53] you there in Hebrews 12 15 it means
[1:58:55] harshness
[1:59:00] did you know that harshness is a
[1:59:03] personality trait where bitterness Lays
[1:59:10] it means resentful spirit
[1:59:19] are there things that you resent
[1:59:22] me too
[1:59:25] but I cannot afford resentment to feed a
[1:59:30] root of bitterness
[1:59:33] in the message the ten virgins and the
[1:59:35] 144 000 Jews brother Branham says in
[1:59:38] paragraph 71 oh not that constant burden
[1:59:42] for the loss that sweetness
[1:59:44] don't never let anything rise up and put
[1:59:48] bitterness
[1:59:51] in your soul
[1:59:54] notice that's where bitterness lie it
[1:59:56] doesn't have it doesn't get in your
[1:59:57] spirit your spirit is regenerated by the
[2:00:00] Holy Spirit
[2:00:01] it's not in your spirit
[2:00:03] it's in your nature it's in your
[2:00:05] personality which lies in the realm of
[2:00:07] nephesh which is your soul
[2:00:11] don't you let bitterness
[2:00:14] don't let anything rise up and put
[2:00:16] bitterness in your soul mind will and
[2:00:19] emotion no matter how bad anyone ever
[2:00:22] treats you or anything don't ever
[2:00:25] don't be guilty of letting that thing
[2:00:30] anchor in your soul
[2:00:33] it'll grieve the holy spirit away from
[2:00:38] you can anybody say Amen
[2:00:40] it'll grieve the holy spirit away from
[2:00:43] you it certainly will how many of you
[2:00:45] can agree with that and in the same
[2:00:48] sermon eight paragraphs later in
[2:00:50] paragraph 79 he said see always keep all
[2:00:54] roots of bitterness out of you
[2:00:58] resentfulness out of you no matter what
[2:01:02] anyone does to you
[2:01:04] just have God in there
[2:01:07] that'll keep all evil away
[2:01:10] from you did you know a soul that is
[2:01:13] saturated in God
[2:01:15] when your mind and your will and your
[2:01:18] emotions are saturated in God
[2:01:21] there is no room in your mind or your
[2:01:25] will or your emotions for bitterness
[2:01:29] it just gets starved out every time
[2:01:34] you know when we get bitter we look for
[2:01:36] somebody to be bitter with us
[2:01:39] and we test our water like putting a toe
[2:01:41] in the water to the bath water to see if
[2:01:43] he's just right we say little things in
[2:01:45] front of people to see where they stand
[2:01:47] and if they shut us down instead of
[2:01:50] entertaining our bitterness you know
[2:01:52] what we do we cut them off
[2:01:55] because we're not looking for somebody
[2:01:56] who'll stand against us we're looking
[2:01:58] for somebody who
[2:02:02] we're not looking for conviction or
[2:02:04] correction
[2:02:06] we're looking for somebody who'll get in
[2:02:08] the boat with us
[2:02:09] hello you can't believe everything you
[2:02:13] hear
[2:02:17] you can't believe everything you see
[2:02:21] come on
[2:02:23] amen you can see some things
[2:02:26] and filter them through your own
[2:02:28] paradigm
[2:02:29] you can think you're seeing what you're
[2:02:31] not seeing
[2:02:33] you can see a situation there and think
[2:02:35] there's some some kind of wonky going on
[2:02:37] when actually it's just as innocent as
[2:02:39] it possibly can be so you've got to be
[2:02:42] careful what you say and what you do and
[2:02:43] how you act how you treat one another
[2:02:45] because you don't want to be a part of
[2:02:47] the weapon that the enemy is trying to
[2:02:49] form against your own life no weapon
[2:02:51] somebody say no weapon
[2:02:54] now in Christ is the mystery of God
[2:02:56] revealed paragraph 86 and 87 this is a
[2:03:00] powerful powerful powerful ver verse or
[2:03:04] quotation he said if the brother you
[2:03:07] think he's a little wrong or the sister
[2:03:11] Lord don't let me never have that root
[2:03:15] of bitterness spring up
[2:03:19] because it'll affect him
[2:03:22] hi
[2:03:24] not only will it affect me
[2:03:26] it will affect a multitude
[2:03:29] and it'll take for Christ
[2:03:33] right out of my life
[2:03:35] how many of you know you can't afford
[2:03:37] for Christ to be removed from your life
[2:03:39] you have no reason to believe to breathe
[2:03:41] then you have no reason to live then you
[2:03:44] can't afford to let that happen he said
[2:03:45] that poison acid
[2:03:49] of malice
[2:03:52] and jealousy
[2:03:55] and hatred
[2:03:57] that will just take the Holy Spirit
[2:04:00] right away from you now listen Folk
[2:04:03] listen folk don't listen to other
[2:04:05] people's amends and get offended
[2:04:09] I know how people use their amends
[2:04:14] I've been in church a long time did you
[2:04:17] know this week I'm gonna I'm gonna
[2:04:18] celebrate 48 years
[2:04:21] a full-time ministry that's a long time
[2:04:25] 48 years of solid full-time ministry
[2:04:30] that's all by the grace of God I've seen
[2:04:32] most anything anybody can see
[2:04:36] been through an experience just about
[2:04:38] anything that anybody can go through and
[2:04:41] experience and I still don't know near
[2:04:44] what I believe God has for me to know
[2:04:48] because he constantly is revealing
[2:04:50] himself but I have lived long enough in
[2:04:53] Ministry to know that jealousy and
[2:04:55] hatred and bitterness will destroy a man
[2:05:00] it'll destroy a woman he'll take the
[2:05:02] Holy Spirit right away from you now
[2:05:05] listen it will run him from the
[2:05:07] Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[2:05:10] God or drive it away from here hurt your
[2:05:14] pastor
[2:05:15] it'll do everything see don't you do
[2:05:19] that and here's the key here's the key
[2:05:22] here's the key here's the key come
[2:05:26] when you don't feel comfortable
[2:05:30] come anyway
[2:05:32] go to the baby shower woman
[2:05:39] go
[2:05:45] I'm not comfortable go
[2:05:49] I get nervous in a crowd go
[2:05:53] I'm preaching to this church
[2:05:55] go
[2:05:57] go to the baby shower go
[2:06:02] well I I'll feel like an odd bird
[2:06:05] I'm not in the click

[2:06:11] oh I'm preaching
[2:06:17] I'm preaching go
[2:06:22] well where do you base that on here we
[2:06:24] go right here
[2:06:26] you just waxed that much closer together
[2:06:29] when you know the enemy is trying to
[2:06:32] divide the body
[2:06:33] when you know the enemy is trying to
[2:06:36] stir a stink
[2:06:39] you pouting ain't gonna change anything
[2:06:44] you lying over yourself and telling
[2:06:46] everybody I'm an introvert
[2:06:49] that's a lie
[2:06:53] I don't believe in introverts
[2:06:57] see how quiet it gets
[2:06:59] because people have used that excuse
[2:07:01] their entire life to withdraw
[2:07:05] and the only way to defeat the enemy who
[2:07:07] wants to cause Division and stink among
[2:07:09] God's people is to wax closer together
[2:07:16] oh I wished I wasn't on stream now I
[2:07:19] want to say something but I can't say it
[2:07:20] on stream because it sounds so ugly
[2:07:25] no don't try to tempt me to
[2:07:29] I thought you people was for me not
[2:07:31] against me
[2:07:35] let me just see if I can say one thing
[2:07:38] and you'll get the point without me
[2:07:39] saying it buttercup
[2:07:44] you get it
[2:07:46] now do you know what I wasn't going to
[2:07:48] say that I wanted to say but I'm not
[2:07:49] going to say buttercup
[2:07:52] does Buttercup help you to find it
[2:07:55] by saying Buttercup do you get the point
[2:07:58] sometimes you just have to do that
[2:08:00] buttercup
[2:08:03] you just have to pull yourself up
[2:08:07] put your big boy
[2:08:10] and say I'm gonna do this thing I'm not
[2:08:14] gonna let the devil cut me off from the
[2:08:16] life of the body of Christ I need this
[2:08:19] church I need my brothers and sisters I
[2:08:23] need the atmosphere here and I need the
[2:08:26] fellowship
[2:08:31] you're gonna want us to celebrate you
[2:08:33] and yours
[2:08:37] so you don't let the enemy cause you to
[2:08:40] pull apart wax closer together draw up
[2:08:45] take the buckle
[2:08:47] as the brother testified
[2:08:50] a minister here the other night
[2:08:52] now this was my friend
[2:08:55] brother Branham is talking about one of
[2:08:57] the dearest friends that I've ever had
[2:08:59] in life brother Gerald Cleveland
[2:09:02] and brother Gerald Cleveland is the one
[2:09:04] that had the dream about the belt buckle
[2:09:07] and the belt buckle appears
[2:09:09] supernaturally in the film excuse me in
[2:09:13] the photo where the lilies grow
[2:09:15] you've seen the supernatural photo
[2:09:17] brother Branham is behind the pulpit
[2:09:19] there are lilies on the on the front and
[2:09:21] the fire comes down and the lilies grow
[2:09:24] how many of you seen the picture they're
[2:09:26] over the pulpit
[2:09:28] and in that in that second shot that was
[2:09:30] taken and in that it's that that brass
[2:09:33] or Golden Belt Buckle that brother
[2:09:35] Cleveland saw in a dream he went to the
[2:09:38] Tabernacle and he gave that and remember
[2:09:41] that's what it looked like when it
[2:09:43] appeared in my hotel room in Tucson
[2:09:48] when I when I saw it
[2:09:51] and took a photo of it which some of you
[2:09:53] have seen
[2:09:54] when when it showed up
[2:09:57] I thought I was looking at that that
[2:10:00] belt buckle in fact I called Brother
[2:10:03] Cleveland from the hotel room in Tucson
[2:10:07] to talk to him about his experience
[2:10:09] because when it first came in the room
[2:10:12] it appeared on the wall just like a
[2:10:15] brass or a golden belt buckle and then
[2:10:17] it started vibrating and moving
[2:10:21] and and as it continued to move it
[2:10:23] opened up and I realized that what I was
[2:10:25] seeing was a window of Heaven Aruba in
[2:10:28] Hebrew I was seeing what what some
[2:10:30] people call today a portal but it was an
[2:10:32] opening into the heavenlies
[2:10:34] and the blue of truth that beautiful
[2:10:36] blue color of the tehelid it was it was
[2:10:40] behind that that that invitation and we
[2:10:45] have just come in is this 5784 is that
[2:10:48] where we are right now we've just
[2:10:49] entered into the Hebrew year of 57 84.
[2:10:53] today is the second day of the Hebrew
[2:10:55] year 57-84 which is a which is a a year
[2:10:59] of the opening of the door
[2:11:02] and when I think of that open door I go
[2:11:05] to Revelation chapter 4 and I receive an
[2:11:07] invitation that says come up here
[2:11:11] because you can't see what you need to
[2:11:13] see if you live down there in the
[2:11:16] lowland I'm preaching now help me a
[2:11:19] minute if you live down there in the
[2:11:21] lowland with your feelings heard and
[2:11:23] your bitterness growing and all that you
[2:11:25] will never be able to get up above the
[2:11:27] problems of life and see what God wants
[2:11:30] you to see if John the Revelator was a
[2:11:33] type of the bride of Christ then it
[2:11:35] wasn't just John that was invited to
[2:11:37] come up and see the Heavenly realm it
[2:11:40] was the bride
[2:11:42] it's our invitation get up above the
[2:11:46] gunk
[2:11:48] don't you stain your robe with politics
[2:11:55] in a time like this
[2:11:57] keep your robe clean
[2:12:02] if the church
[2:12:04] should have learned anything
[2:12:06] in the last election
[2:12:09] it would be don't dirty your clothes
[2:12:13] with politics
[2:12:15] because
[2:12:17] Prophet after profit after profit
[2:12:22] prophesied all over the world that
[2:12:25] Donald Trump will be exonerated
[2:12:28] and placed back in office before Biden
[2:12:31] is able to finish his first term
[2:12:35] now they have have uh you know in
[2:12:38] politics they use this term walking it
[2:12:40] back
[2:12:43] this is a little colored lady that we
[2:12:45] see all the time who's trying to defend
[2:12:48] the indefensible
[2:12:50] and she's constantly making statements
[2:12:53] that are untrue and the next day
[2:12:56] she's walking it back she's called a
[2:12:59] press secretary who in the world would
[2:13:01] want such a low down job
[2:13:05] what could be any more low than to have
[2:13:08] to lie to the American public
[2:13:10] for the sake of politics and then they
[2:13:13] back it up
[2:13:15] and they back it up and they back it up
[2:13:18] and they try to cover it over don't you
[2:13:20] get caught up in that in this coming
[2:13:21] election
[2:13:22] you vote and you vote your conscience
[2:13:24] and you vote what God tells you and
[2:13:26] here's what he has told me there's three
[2:13:28] things
[2:13:30] that he cares about more than all the
[2:13:32] rest when it comes to a leader for this
[2:13:34] nation that's the sanctity of life
[2:13:38] the sanctity of human marriage that's
[2:13:41] between a man and a woman
[2:13:43] and it's Israel
[2:13:47] those are the things that are dearest to
[2:13:49] the heart of God in an hour like this
[2:13:50] the rest of it let me tell you something
[2:13:52] I hate to hurt your feelings but he
[2:13:55] doesn't really care about unemployment
[2:13:57] rates and inflation rates and Social
[2:13:59] Securities and
[2:14:01] these things don't really bother the
[2:14:03] economy of God because he knows he's
[2:14:06] going to take care of his folks
[2:14:08] [Applause]
[2:14:11] no matter what they do
[2:14:14] I'm an old man and I've never seen the
[2:14:17] righteous forsaken nor God's seed
[2:14:19] begging for bread don't you let this old
[2:14:23] stuff make you bitter
[2:14:26] don't let it make you paranoid
[2:14:31] God is going to take care of his little
[2:14:33] people
[2:14:34] amen and we may have to do without some
[2:14:36] things but God is going to take care of
[2:14:39] us
[2:14:40] it will stay right with him if we'll
[2:14:43] keep the bitterness out and the and turn
[2:14:45] loose of The Grudge and get filled up
[2:14:48] then no weapon
[2:14:52] so that uh that belt buckle brother
[2:14:56] Cleveland had this dream
[2:14:59] and there were there were a belt buckles
[2:15:01] there was an ordinary looking belt
[2:15:03] buckle laying there
[2:15:04] and a hand came and picked up that
[2:15:07] golden belt buckle
[2:15:09] and placed it over the top
[2:15:11] of the ordinary belt buckle
[2:15:14] and it was changed
[2:15:16] into into a golden belt buckle and
[2:15:20] brother Branham was not to be in the
[2:15:23] service that night
[2:15:25] Brother Cleveland went anyway not
[2:15:27] knowing until that afternoon that
[2:15:29] brother Brandon wasn't going to be there
[2:15:30] he went to the service anyway he had
[2:15:32] traveled all the way from Anderson South
[2:15:34] Carolina to Jeffersonville Indiana to be
[2:15:37] in the service
[2:15:38] and he said about the time they start
[2:15:41] taking some testimonies
[2:15:44] brother Branham opens the door of the
[2:15:46] study walks out and pulls a folding
[2:15:49] chair a straight chair Off the Wall
[2:15:52] there and unfolds it and sits down on
[2:15:54] the platform and leans back in that
[2:15:56] chair and is listening to the testimony
[2:15:59] and brother Cleveland is the one
[2:16:01] testifying about this dream and now in a
[2:16:05] in a service or two later brother Brad
[2:16:07] and brother Branham got up in the
[2:16:08] service and interpreted what that meant
[2:16:11] and he talked about it being the the
[2:16:13] Buckle that buckles on the armor of God
[2:16:17] and how important that is that Buckle
[2:16:20] has got to be cinched and it's Gotta
[2:16:22] it's got to be operational because it's
[2:16:25] holding on it's holding something in
[2:16:27] that that belt we need that belt don't
[2:16:31] we and uh so brother Branham got up and
[2:16:34] interpreted that dream and now he's
[2:16:36] referring to it and he's referring to it
[2:16:39] in the reference of what can happen when
[2:16:42] we let the enemy divide us
[2:16:45] and he said you just wax that much
[2:16:46] closer together take the Buckle the
[2:16:48] brother testify to minister either not
[2:16:50] uh seeing it in a vision just that
[2:16:53] buckles on
[2:16:55] the whole armor of God
[2:16:59] just pull her own
[2:17:01] tighten up
[2:17:03] somebody read that for me
[2:17:08] move right up close to one another love
[2:17:11] one another and and this is a huge word
[2:17:13] there uh oh how huge that word is can
[2:17:17] somebody tell me that that good old
[2:17:19] southern word there
[2:17:21] anyhow
[2:17:24] talk nice
[2:17:31] well this can be a challenge
[2:17:36] we have to be creative sometime to think
[2:17:39] of something nice to say
[2:17:41] but we can do this
[2:17:43] because it brings the holy spirit in in
[2:17:46] in our presence when we learn to say
[2:17:49] something edifying
[2:17:57] say nice things about one another and
[2:18:00] then somebody read that rest sentence
[2:18:03] and then God will bless you in the
[2:18:05] pergamian church age
[2:18:07] this is not the church age book but the
[2:18:09] preaching of the church ages paragraph
[2:18:11] 17 brother Brandon said try to do
[2:18:13] something good
[2:18:15] and just keep being good
[2:18:19] you knew that you could do the smallest
[2:18:22] gesture
[2:18:23] and brighten somebody's life
[2:18:29] wouldn't you want to do it
[2:18:32] as a servant of Christ
[2:18:36] Chad if you knew
[2:18:42] that you were going to cut me like a
[2:18:45] knife by not saying hello to me wouldn't
[2:18:48] you want to do it
[2:18:54] wouldn't you want to stand in line if
[2:18:57] you had to
[2:18:59] and say hello
[2:19:01] oh Lord
[2:19:05] he's got the slowest head nods in the
[2:19:07] church
[2:19:08] he's got a process it all before he
[2:19:10] knocks and his little wife nervous
[2:19:12] little Jennifer is looking at him don't

[2:19:16] Darren play alone play along play along
[2:19:19] she knows what she lives with play alone
[2:19:23] Oh No Malice no grudges don't let any
[2:19:26] bitterness no matter how bad the person
[2:19:29] is and how bad they talk about you
[2:19:35] don't you never think evil in your heart
[2:19:38] against them because right there the
[2:19:40] devil will set right in and work up
[2:19:43] something right there
[2:19:46] just keep it all covered up with Godly
[2:19:49] love confession and making right and do
[2:19:52] good to those who do evil to you if you
[2:19:55] only do good to those who do good to you
[2:19:57] why Jesus said don't the publicans do
[2:20:00] the same
[2:20:02] see the Sinners anybody can be good to
[2:20:05] those that's good to them
[2:20:06] hello we're getting to the nitty-gritty
[2:20:09] but be good to those who are not good to
[2:20:11] you do something for those that would
[2:20:13] not do anything
[2:20:16] who would do nothing for you
[2:20:21] somebody said I I you know uh someone
[2:20:24] give me a birthday little birthday I I
[2:20:26] couldn't I can't afford to give them all
[2:20:28] something you know you don't want to get
[2:20:30] caught up in that vicious trap of
[2:20:31] expectation
[2:20:33] but but I found out that you can write a
[2:20:35] note on a plain piece of paper and give
[2:20:38] it to somebody on their birthday and
[2:20:39] brighten their life
[2:20:40] you can pick up a dollar candy bar at
[2:20:44] the dollar store and pick up somebody's
[2:20:45] life you don't have to get a bouquet you
[2:20:48] can get a single flower for just a
[2:20:50] couple of bucks and brighten somebody's
[2:20:52] life
[2:20:53] and be good to somebody and and and do
[2:20:57] more you you do more to create Unity you
[2:21:02] do more to get rid of all the stuff by
[2:21:06] some little act of kindness or gesture
[2:21:08] of love than what you recognize sometime
[2:21:11] what you realize you don't realize how
[2:21:14] effective it is to show just the just a
[2:21:18] little bit of love and consideration
[2:21:21] well I know what'll happen if I do
[2:21:25] he'll just hurt me again
[2:21:28] I know what'll happen if I do she'll
[2:21:30] just step all over me again she might
[2:21:34] she might
[2:21:36] well she's the one that needs some work
[2:21:38] it sounds like
[2:21:39] he he might he might he he's the one
[2:21:42] that needs a little bit of work but I
[2:21:43] want you to know that's not what you're
[2:21:45] not obligated to keep his Spirit right
[2:21:48] you're not obligated to keep her spirit
[2:21:50] right what are we obligated to do
[2:21:53] keep our own Spirits right and I'm
[2:21:55] preaching to you and if I need to call
[2:21:57] names I was told recently that if I need
[2:22:00] to call names I can because I have in
[2:22:03] the past
[2:22:05] and it happened to be from someone who's
[2:22:07] had their name called
[2:22:09] speak a good word for the man that would
[2:22:12] speak evil against you and that way you
[2:22:14] keep all the bitterness out of your
[2:22:16] heart and you're always in love with
[2:22:18] everybody then as long as you what
[2:22:21] stay in love we're not talking about
[2:22:22] just that that filial love that that
[2:22:25] human the we're talking about in the
[2:22:27] love of God
[2:22:28] oh that's some powerful love that's the
[2:22:31] changing love brother Branham said in
[2:22:33] 1957 May every root of bitterness be
[2:22:36] grubbed out
[2:22:38] by God's sharp grubbing hole
[2:22:43] and then closing
[2:22:46] another way that we can
[2:22:49] well let me let me do this first
[2:22:51] concerning grudges
[2:22:53] Mayo Clinic
[2:22:55] released an article what are the effects
[2:22:58] of holding a grudge
[2:23:02] if you're unforgiving you might pay the
[2:23:05] price
[2:23:06] repeatedly
[2:23:08] by bringing anger and bitterness into
[2:23:10] every relationship and into every new
[2:23:14] experience
[2:23:15] your life might become so wrapped up in
[2:23:18] the wrong
[2:23:19] that you can enjoy the present has
[2:23:22] anybody ever been there holding a grudge
[2:23:24] you might become depressed or anxious
[2:23:28] holding a grudge you might feel that
[2:23:30] your life lacks meaning or purpose or
[2:23:32] that you're at odds with your own
[2:23:34] spiritual beliefs you might lose
[2:23:36] valuable and enriching connectedness
[2:23:41] with others
[2:23:43] now I said some things Tuesday night
[2:23:46] that I want to justify before we before
[2:23:49] we close
[2:23:51] because I know what some of you did
[2:23:54] I know that some of you went to Dr
[2:23:57] Google
[2:24:01] you heard me speak about soul ties
[2:24:04] and I know that some of you went to Dr
[2:24:07] Google and you were very alarmed
[2:24:10] because the first 12 or 15 articles
[2:24:13] about soul ties will tell you about how
[2:24:16] unbiblical the concept is and how New
[2:24:19] Age it is and how there's no scriptural
[2:24:22] truth in it well I want you to know I
[2:24:24] absolutely emphatically refute all 15
[2:24:27] articles
[2:24:29] and what I would like to tell you is
[2:24:31] this there is a new age concept of a
[2:24:35] soul tie that is called the
[2:24:37] fragmentation of the human psyche or the
[2:24:40] human soul
[2:24:42] and that we do not believe we do not
[2:24:44] believe that a soul tie takes from you a
[2:24:49] portion of your own soul physically
[2:24:53] that is the New Age idea it's kind of
[2:24:56] like the old expression that we say
[2:24:58] sometime you better be careful how many
[2:25:00] pieces of your mind you give away
[2:25:03] you know some people are always saying I
[2:25:05] gave him a piece of my mind I gave her a
[2:25:07] piece of my mind and we have to remind
[2:25:09] people sometime you've about giving it
[2:25:11] all away
[2:25:13] and that's kind of what that Soul
[2:25:15] fragmentation of the human psyche is
[2:25:17] about it's this this metaphysical and
[2:25:20] and New Age idea
[2:25:22] that you're actually losing apart
[2:25:24] physical part of your of your soul when
[2:25:28] you create a soul tie which leaves you
[2:25:30] with some holes in you this has no
[2:25:33] scriptural uh Foundation whatsoever
[2:25:36] but the concept of a soul tie is a very
[2:25:40] spiritual and scriptural concept and I
[2:25:44] want to take just 10 minutes here maybe
[2:25:45] and and help you because uh I I had not
[2:25:49] looked at it in a long time and after I
[2:25:52] spoke that I went to Dr Google because I
[2:25:55] woke up just knowing that somebody was
[2:25:58] checking me out and I want you to do
[2:26:00] that but I don't want you to refute what
[2:26:03] you hear simply because you found the
[2:26:05] negative article
[2:26:06] has anybody ever Googled brother Branham
[2:26:11] we don't get our information about
[2:26:13] brother Branham from Google we get it
[2:26:15] from what we hear him say
[2:26:18] out of his own mouth and we get it from
[2:26:20] those who knew him the best
[2:26:22] from Witnesses who walked with him and
[2:26:24] ministered with him we we're not
[2:26:27] interested in Wikipedia
[2:26:29] see so if you read something like that
[2:26:31] and you throw the baby out with the bath
[2:26:33] water you'll miss the whole truth of the
[2:26:36] concept and so let me give you a couple
[2:26:39] of verses of scripture we're going to
[2:26:40] need somebody up there because I did not
[2:26:43] uh give them these verses
[2:26:47] this is a verse that you are familiar
[2:26:49] with in second Corinthians chapter six
[2:26:53] and verse 14 in the Amplified Bible
[2:26:57] second Corinthians chapter 6 and verse
[2:27:00] 14. this is always used concerning
[2:27:04] marriage
[2:27:05] but there's actually nothing in it that
[2:27:08] says that it's a verse exclusively
[2:27:10] pertaining to marriage
[2:27:13] I want you to look at how they Amplified
[2:27:15] takes the word and the phrase and makes
[2:27:19] it quite interesting do not be unequally
[2:27:24] yoked with unbelievers
[2:27:30] now now look at how the Amplified
[2:27:32] amplifies
[2:27:34] do not make
[2:27:37] mismatched alliances with them
[2:27:41] or come under a different yoke
[2:27:46] with them
[2:27:48] inconsistent with your faith
[2:27:52] when you're looking for a business
[2:27:54] partner you need a believer
[2:27:58] when you're looking for a companion in
[2:28:01] life
[2:28:05] you need a believer
[2:28:07] what is wrong with somebody I'd like
[2:28:09] somebody to help me understand what is
[2:28:12] wrong with a believer
[2:28:14] that is so soulishly lonely
[2:28:17] that they would choose a marriage a
[2:28:20] covenant with an unbeliever
[2:28:23] and expect that they're going to have
[2:28:25] anything in the world other than two ox
[2:28:29] pulling against each other
[2:28:32] it's never going to be anything other
[2:28:35] than that as long as you have a two one
[2:28:39] a Believer and one a non-believer in the
[2:28:42] Covenant of marriage together it's never
[2:28:44] going to be any different than that in a
[2:28:46] business
[2:28:48] you you're expecting the scripture to to
[2:28:52] adapt to your choices
[2:28:54] you're never going to have a productive
[2:28:56] business by going into business with an
[2:28:58] unbeliever you're not going to have the
[2:29:00] same principles
[2:29:02] you're going to tithe on half the
[2:29:04] business
[2:29:06] you're you're going to make decisions
[2:29:08] babe some people don't care how they
[2:29:11] twist arms how they manipulate how they
[2:29:14] use witchcraft to get sales
[2:29:18] but a Believer cares a Believer doesn't
[2:29:21] want to be guilty of using witchcraft to
[2:29:23] pump up their paycheck
[2:29:26] and the world out there anybody helping
[2:29:28] me the world out there is going to
[2:29:30] expect you to do all those kinds of
[2:29:32] things all right and so we have to even
[2:29:36] be careful with our friendships
[2:29:42] or you're going to have one Ox pulley
[2:29:44] one way and the other Ox pulling the
[2:29:46] other way
[2:29:48] so to say that a non-believer is your
[2:29:51] best friend is a dangerous statement to
[2:29:53] me
[2:29:54] because this scripture is not only
[2:29:57] referring to marriage it actually says
[2:29:59] do not make mismatched alliances with
[2:30:03] them unbelievers or come under a
[2:30:07] different yoke with them
[2:30:10] inconsistent with your faith for what
[2:30:13] partnership have right living and right
[2:30:16] standing with god with iniquity
[2:30:21] and lawlessness
[2:30:24] I'm not really interested in putting
[2:30:25] beer money
[2:30:29] I need a little more time here
[2:30:31] I'm not really interested in putting
[2:30:33] beer money in somebody else's pocket
[2:30:36] I'm not really interested in putting
[2:30:38] drug money in somebody else's pocket
[2:30:41] I'm not really interested in playing
[2:30:43] dumb while somebody defrauds the the IRS
[2:30:48] [Applause]
[2:30:50] because I've been told to render under
[2:30:52] Caesar what Caesar and unto God what's
[2:30:54] God's
[2:30:55] and you may think people you may think
[2:30:57] God don't see the money this past the
[2:31:00] cash that's under the table
[2:31:06] but God sees that
[2:31:09] and if you're in that kind of a
[2:31:10] situation you may have found yourself
[2:31:13] unequally yoked together with an
[2:31:16] alliance that is mismatched and in doing
[2:31:21] so you may have formed a connection
[2:31:25] with somebody else's Soul life
[2:31:29] mind will and emotion
[2:31:32] and if you have created that kind of a
[2:31:35] connection that person can actually use
[2:31:39] that to their advantage
[2:31:41] by manipulation
[2:31:44] by the spirit of control
[2:31:47] I want you to know there are some people
[2:31:49] who are so good at control they can
[2:31:53] control you and you don't even know
[2:31:55] you're being controlled
[2:31:59] and that is not a part of a marriage
[2:32:03] anybody with me
[2:32:05] husbands and wives are not entering into
[2:32:07] that kind of a covenant so they can play
[2:32:10] mind games with one another
[2:32:14] have you ever known somebody who has a
[2:32:17] way of giving you their opinion
[2:32:20] and the next thing you know five minutes
[2:32:23] later
[2:32:24] you've turned loose of everything you
[2:32:26] thought
[2:32:28] and you have embraced someone else's
[2:32:31] contrary opinion
[2:32:33] before you know it you've been
[2:32:35] completely swayed
[2:32:37] to choose something or to make a
[2:32:39] decision that you have never made before
[2:32:41] and you don't even know walking away you
[2:32:44] don't even realize walking away you've
[2:32:47] been manipulated
[2:32:50] these are soul ties
[2:32:53] they need to be broken
[2:32:56] did you know the scripture said he who
[2:32:58] joins himself to a harlot
[2:33:00] has become one bot or a prostitute in
[2:33:03] King James I mean uh in other versions
[2:33:06] harlot in King James prostitute in other
[2:33:08] versions it says he who has joined
[2:33:10] himself to a prostitute becomes one body
[2:33:12] with that with that prostitute
[2:33:16] did you know that if any of you men have
[2:33:18] had that kind of a relationship with a
[2:33:20] with a hired woman
[2:33:23] or or man whatever the situation is do
[2:33:26] you know that if you've ever entered
[2:33:27] into that kind of agreement a soul tie
[2:33:30] an emotional connection
[2:33:33] could have been I don't know if it
[2:33:35] always was but it can be formed
[2:33:40] and if it was formed that in itself can
[2:33:44] Lodge in your memory
[2:33:48] until you feel and find yourself being
[2:33:52] pulled back into that kind of a behavior
[2:33:55] because you've become one body with a
[2:33:57] prostitute
[2:33:59] I'm not getting a whole lot of help but
[2:34:01] I think you're listening finally
[2:34:03] now I'm just telling you what the
[2:34:04] scripture is saying don't tell me
[2:34:06] there's no such thing as a soul tie
[2:34:08] because here it is right here unequally
[2:34:10] yoked together with unbelievers
[2:34:12] this is a soul tie this is describing
[2:34:14] what happens when you become emotionally
[2:34:17] attached to someone that you're not in
[2:34:19] Covenant with
[2:34:20] and if they're a non-believer you can't
[2:34:22] be in a Godly Covenant with them
[2:34:25] you can't be in a contract with them
[2:34:29] now I'm thrilled that there's a a thrill
[2:34:32] that there's a stirring that took place
[2:34:34] on the campus of Auburn I'm thrilled
[2:34:37] that 5 000 young people were gathered
[2:34:39] there in a worship night and many made
[2:34:42] their way to the water and I'm thankful
[2:34:44] that they finally have a coach
[2:34:46] who cares enough about their soul to
[2:34:49] talk to them about eternal life
[2:34:51] but I can only measurably Delight when I
[2:34:55] know that they're being baptized into a
[2:34:57] system that has no life
[2:35:03] and who scripturally can easily make
[2:35:06] them a two-fold child of hell
[2:35:08] instead of a real son of God
[2:35:11] so what I do when I read something like
[2:35:14] that I go wild in prayer
[2:35:17] instead of blasting it and becoming so
[2:35:20] critical about it on social media I get
[2:35:23] on my knees
[2:35:24] and I say Lord it only takes one
[2:35:29] all you got to do is talk to one about
[2:35:31] Jesus name baptism all you got to do is
[2:35:34] reveal it to one two three four and let
[2:35:37] them begin to tell their friends
[2:35:39] [Applause]
[2:35:41] so we Rejoice anytime darkness is pushed
[2:35:45] back but we want to get a hold of this
[2:35:47] thing in the spirit and pray that a
[2:35:50] shaking will come to that campus
[2:35:54] and that it will belch out like hell
[2:35:56] Souls
[2:35:59] for the kingdom of God
[2:36:01] because it's a corrupt Institution
[2:36:04] like all the rest of them
[2:36:06] very very monetarily driven and corrupt
[2:36:12] so much so that they can hide from the
[2:36:14] news
[2:36:16] there's so much money and power and
[2:36:18] influence in a university like that that
[2:36:20] they can hide truth from the news and we
[2:36:23] never really know the violence that
[2:36:25] takes place on campus
[2:36:26] come on now
[2:36:28] they had a measure a measurable
[2:36:30] influence over a fight that took place
[2:36:32] last weekend in Auburn that was
[2:36:35] absolutely hideous and horrible where
[2:36:37] someone followed someone else home from
[2:36:39] a bar and beat them and most of the
[2:36:42] licks that the person took they took
[2:36:44] them while they were unconscious who in
[2:36:46] their right mind that's the thing they
[2:36:48] weren't in their right mind
[2:36:49] but immediately the school goes in like
[2:36:52] every other they go into major
[2:36:54] protection mode and and won't do favors
[2:36:57] and do everything they can to keep the
[2:36:59] truth from coming out so that Justice
[2:37:01] cannot really be served and the
[2:37:03] reputation of the school be marred I'm
[2:37:05] asking God
[2:37:08] to get in the midst of that and let a
[2:37:11] breaking forth take place he's given us
[2:37:14] Authority in the spirit over this region
[2:37:16] why don't we believe that God will do
[2:37:19] something
[2:37:22] I believe he will
[2:37:24] nothing no extra charge for that I just
[2:37:27] wanted to get that out
[2:37:29] so you may Google it and think there's
[2:37:31] nothing to it but the Bible talks about
[2:37:33] David and Jonathan
[2:37:37] and the Bible uses this terminology it
[2:37:40] says there's though they were knit
[2:37:42] together in their souls
[2:37:47] now I've read articles trying to prove
[2:37:49] that they were homosexual lovers
[2:37:51] and I want you to know nothing could be
[2:37:53] any sicker
[2:37:55] or farther from the truth they weren't
[2:37:58] knitted together physically they were
[2:37:59] knitted together in mind will and
[2:38:02] emotion
[2:38:04] there was a relationship form that was
[2:38:06] positive and righteous and Powerful that
[2:38:10] made them comrades and gave them a
[2:38:12] brotherly and fraternal affection for
[2:38:15] one another that's part of the stature
[2:38:17] of the perfect man
[2:38:21] did you know it's part of our promise as
[2:38:24] broad that we will be filled with such
[2:38:27] brotherly kindness
[2:38:31] that word is can be translated from the
[2:38:34] Greek fraternal affection
[2:38:37] which is like a Band of Brothers
[2:38:40] and anything Satan can do
[2:38:44] just a minute
[2:38:45] anything Satan can do out there in the
[2:38:47] negative he has to be basing off of
[2:38:50] something positive in the spirit
[2:38:54] so if if God tells us that we can be
[2:38:58] joined in Soul or spirit with a Believer
[2:39:01] then we know that it's the enemy's
[2:39:03] desire to join us to something else
[2:39:06] whether it be a harlot or whether it be
[2:39:09] an unrighteous unbelieving partner of
[2:39:11] some kind
[2:39:14] my bestie
[2:39:16] really
[2:39:19] someone who won't serve the Lord really
[2:39:24] that's really the best you can have for
[2:39:26] a friendship now you don't want to
[2:39:29] mistreat anybody you shouldn't mistreat
[2:39:31] people you should be friendly and you
[2:39:33] can make friends
[2:39:35] but these are not people that you deeply
[2:39:37] confide in
[2:39:38] every time you lay your deepest
[2:39:40] confidence in someone it's another way
[2:39:43] that a connection is formed between the
[2:39:45] two of you and a lot of manipulation
[2:39:47] that takes place around the church
[2:39:50] the church world
[2:39:52] is because of someone who's spoken to
[2:39:55] someone else in confidence
[2:39:57] and that is a vulnerability that is
[2:39:59] exposed and it's a way that the enemy
[2:40:02] can often use to manipulate behavior and
[2:40:05] cause someone to stay locked in a cycle
[2:40:08] that the holy spirit is coming to break
[2:40:10] you out of can anybody follow along with
[2:40:12] what I'm saying and let me give you let
[2:40:15] me give you this in in First Corinthians
[2:40:18] charity verse 6
[2:40:22] and 15 16 and 17 in the Amplified and
[2:40:26] then we'll move we'll move back to this
[2:40:27] and close it's 1 33. I know you're tired
[2:40:32] see nobody said a word
[2:40:34] I know you're tired
[2:40:39] nobody's going to lie and say I'm not I
[2:40:41] don't want you to but
[2:40:43] I'm not quite through
[2:40:48] is that First Corinthians 6 that I say
[2:40:50] something else what'd I say
[2:40:53] First Corinthians 6 verse 15 16 and 17.
[2:40:57] no ye not I want that in the Amplified
[2:41:04] First Corinthians 6 15 16 and 17.
[2:41:09] do you not see
[2:41:11] and know that your bodies are members
[2:41:15] bodily parts of Christ the Messiah
[2:41:19] am I therefore to take the parts of
[2:41:21] Christ
[2:41:23] and make them parts of a prostitute
[2:41:27] never
[2:41:28] never
[2:41:30] or do you not know and realize that when
[2:41:34] a man joins himself to a prostitute he
[2:41:37] becomes one body with her
[2:41:44] the two it is written shall become
[2:41:48] one flesh
[2:41:50] but the person who is United to the Lord
[2:41:56] becomes not one soul
[2:42:00] not one body but we know the other
[2:42:02] scripture tells us we're members
[2:42:04] individual members of his body but those
[2:42:07] who are united to the Lord joined to the
[2:42:10] Lord to King James says becomes what
[2:42:14] now that's the Oneness that's the Yoke
[2:42:18] that's the relationship that we're all
[2:42:21] looking for what we give ourselves to
[2:42:25] becomes a vulnerable place where a soul
[2:42:28] tie can be connected and we renounce
[2:42:31] that when we recognize did you know
[2:42:34] there there may be relationships that
[2:42:36] you have moved on from
[2:42:39] but the memory
[2:42:41] of the connection that you had may still
[2:42:44] be affecting you in your relationships
[2:42:47] today because the root was never removed
[2:42:49] God help us
[2:42:53] God help us
[2:42:55] we don't want that going on in our life
[2:42:58] now in in in closing again second or
[2:43:02] third close this ought to be it
[2:43:04] Mark chapter 11.
[2:43:07] verse 25 and 26 King James
[2:43:11] and this is the third way the last and
[2:43:15] the third way that you can participate
[2:43:18] as a weapon formed against yourself
[2:43:20] number three is to remain in
[2:43:23] unforgiveness
[2:43:24] number one is to continue in stinking
[2:43:27] thinking number two is to not deal with
[2:43:29] the grudge that you're holding in your
[2:43:32] life and number three is to remain in
[2:43:34] unforgiveness and when you stand praying
[2:43:36] forgive
[2:43:40] you you're not supposed to pray
[2:43:43] with unforgiveness toward anyone in your
[2:43:47] heart
[2:43:48] hello
[2:43:50] and when you stand praying forgive
[2:43:53] if you have ought against any
[2:43:55] that your father also which is in heaven
[2:43:58] May forgive you your trespasses now does
[2:44:03] anybody understand from that verse of
[2:44:04] scripture
[2:44:06] that your forgiveness
[2:44:09] is intricately and directly connected to
[2:44:13] your ability to forgive am I making that
[2:44:16] up am I stretching that verse it sounds
[2:44:19] to me like Jesus is saying if you want
[2:44:22] forgiveness to flow
[2:44:24] you've got to open up the Flow by
[2:44:28] forgiving we all know the little
[2:44:30] catchphrases that are so so used in our
[2:44:33] generation and and it's so very true
[2:44:35] that forgiveness is not about the person
[2:44:38] that wronged you
[2:44:40] forgiveness is not setting them free in
[2:44:43] fact they may need to pay before God for
[2:44:45] their bad decision but it sets you free
[2:44:48] because you are no longer limited by
[2:44:51] their behavior towards you hear me
[2:44:54] you are no longer limited by your their
[2:44:56] behavior toward you but if you do not
[2:44:58] forgive
[2:45:00] verse 26 neither will your father which
[2:45:04] is in heaven forgive you your trespasses
[2:45:09] Matthew 18 33 should is not thou also
[2:45:12] have had compassion on thy fellow
[2:45:15] servant even as I had pity on thee has
[2:45:19] God ever shown you great grace and pity
[2:45:22] has God ever filled you with compassion
[2:45:24] when you didn't deserve it then the
[2:45:26] least we can do is treat one another
[2:45:28] with the same respect can the Saints
[2:45:30] amen Ephesians 4 31 let all bitterness
[2:45:33] and wrath and anger and clamor
[2:45:37] when I hear that word clamor it's like I
[2:45:41] see somebody's false teeth clacking
[2:45:43] together
[2:45:48] it's just so much noise
[2:45:53] just shut it
[2:45:59] obsessive rattling on about nothing
[2:46:05] can have an effect on your spiritual
[2:46:08] life
[2:46:10] nobody likes picking on people any more
[2:46:12] than I do
[2:46:14] but when people
[2:46:16] keep on
[2:46:18] and on
[2:46:20] and on and on it becomes detrimental to
[2:46:24] the atmosphere
[2:46:26] it becomes distracting to the atmosphere
[2:46:30] we wouldn't want our well meaning or
[2:46:34] well-intended fun to disturb the Peace
[2:46:37] of the spiritual atmosphere over this
[2:46:40] place so let all bitterness and wrath
[2:46:43] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[2:46:45] be put away from you with all malice
[2:46:47] make sure we get that grubbed out
[2:46:50] get rid of all of that
[2:46:55] forgive people in your life
[2:46:57] even those who are not sorry for their
[2:47:00] actions
[2:47:05] you know what I found out if you're
[2:47:07] waiting on some people to apologize
[2:47:13] your hair is going to fall out
[2:47:16] you're going to need some of them false
[2:47:18] teeth
[2:47:19] to get through because some folks they
[2:47:22] don't see they cannot see they're
[2:47:24] blinded by their own delusions they
[2:47:27] don't care really they don't really
[2:47:29] really care how many people they step on
[2:47:31] as long as they can survive
[2:47:34] it's that dog eat dog mentality of the
[2:47:37] world around us and if you're waiting on
[2:47:39] that kind of a person to come and
[2:47:41] apologize to you
[2:47:42] may never happen
[2:47:45] you've got to do the right thing
[2:47:47] and let me tell you how important it is
[2:47:49] in closing
[2:47:51] what was that four
[2:47:53] perfect faith
[2:47:55] paragraph 19. oh you're keeping up with
[2:47:58] that are you keeping up with my good
[2:47:59] points or just my closing
[2:48:02] good thank you
[2:48:04] praise the Lord Brother Austin's fasting
[2:48:06] today for for getting out of God's way
[2:48:11] Hallelujah
[2:48:15] I love coming to church with you people
[2:48:21] praise God let me just take my time
[2:48:26] now Faith this is perfect Faith
[2:48:28] paragraph 19 faith
[2:48:31] faith
[2:48:33] is
[2:48:34] based on
[2:48:36] hello
[2:48:38] forgiveness
[2:48:40] and then as we said this morning trying
[2:48:42] to get the church into the place where
[2:48:44] we could really see Apostolic times
[2:48:46] moving Among Us
[2:48:48] that's what we all hunger and it's just
[2:48:51] laying
[2:48:53] oh
[2:48:54] 57-84
[2:48:57] so you're the open door
[2:48:59] it's just laying where
[2:49:01] right at the door we see it but we want
[2:49:04] to see more of it
[2:49:06] we wanted such a flow that it'll be a
[2:49:09] help to us
[2:49:10] and what else flow out
[2:49:14] to others
[2:49:17] for you date Watchers this is August of
[2:49:20] 63. the seals have been preached and the
[2:49:24] prophet is still crying out for more
[2:49:28] Apostolic times
[2:49:29] moving Among Us
[2:49:32] oh God we've got to have it
[2:49:35] we've got to have it
[2:49:37] I'm closing
[2:49:39] fifth time
[2:49:40] last paragraphs
[2:49:43] in the message the Great Commission
[2:49:45] Chattanooga Tennessee I want you to
[2:49:48] stand with me
[2:49:50] musicians are coming
[2:50:11] find the song that Ben is going to lead
[2:50:13] us in in worship and play that softly if
[2:50:16] you will
[2:50:18] research has shown that carrying a
[2:50:21] grudge
[2:50:22] or harboring unforgiveness is bad for
[2:50:24] our physical health
[2:50:26] and our mental where well-being
[2:50:29] there's an old saying that holding a
[2:50:31] grudge is like drinking poison and
[2:50:32] waiting for the other person to die
[2:50:37] holding on to a grudge takes work
[2:50:40] it's an active process during which we
[2:50:42] consciously recall the initial insult or
[2:50:45] replay the event over and over and over
[2:50:48] again in our mind and allow the anger
[2:50:51] heard in resentment to control our
[2:50:53] thoughts and feelings I'm going to read
[2:50:54] that one more time because some of you
[2:50:57] have already turned off your brain turn
[2:50:59] it on I want you to hear this
[2:51:01] holding a grudge takes work it's not
[2:51:03] even easy
[2:51:05] it's an active process during which we
[2:51:08] consciously recall the initial insult or
[2:51:12] replay the event over and over again in
[2:51:14] our mind and we allow the anger the hurt
[2:51:16] and the resentment to Bubble Up and
[2:51:19] control our thoughts and feelings all
[2:51:20] over again how many of you have ever
[2:51:22] relived these moments I'm not looking
[2:51:24] you've relived those hurtful moments
[2:51:27] you've relived those harsh words
[2:51:31] only Jesus can come and separate you
[2:51:34] from the memory
[2:51:35] but he wants to do that
[2:51:37] he wants to do that
[2:51:43] long-term effects the Mayo Clinic says
[2:51:46] that long-term long-term effects of
[2:51:48] carrying a grudge can range from
[2:51:50] depression
[2:51:51] to cardiovascular ailments even
[2:51:54] diminishing a person's outlook on life
[2:51:58] and overl Over All
[2:52:01] well-being
[2:52:03] paragraph 12 of The Great Commission if
[2:52:06] I have found Grace in your sight through
[2:52:08] God
[2:52:10] you take my word for this Brethren this
[2:52:12] is God's servant
[2:52:14] if you want to be a blessing
[2:52:17] and get a blessing
[2:52:19] when a man has done you wrong
[2:52:21] he's absolutely justly he I mean he has
[2:52:24] done you wrong and you know that he's
[2:52:27] done you wrong he's done you evil
[2:52:30] don't mention that
[2:52:35] that's one of the hardest requests
[2:52:38] that's ever been made of us
[2:52:41] you take him to prayer before God
[2:52:46] and may I say God get him is not the
[2:52:50] kind of prayer you want to bring to God
[2:52:54] you know you want to say Lord help him
[2:52:57] and most of all help me because I'm
[2:52:59] having a struggle toting this thing
[2:53:01] around I need some help here don't take
[2:53:05] it in a way of just a selfish well I'm
[2:53:08] supposed to do this but stand with your
[2:53:12] shoulder to his shoulder stand in the
[2:53:15] presence of God our Father way of prayer
[2:53:18] should be made in the presence of God
[2:53:20] say father here's my brother
[2:53:22] he deserves punishment he's done me evil
[2:53:26] and I don't see why he did it
[2:53:29] then let God go to talking to you
[2:53:33] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[2:53:36] been through
[2:53:40] Leviathan the devil has Twisted him up
[2:53:44] somewhere and caused him to do that
[2:53:47] though he's absolutely wrong
[2:53:51] before you leave the Throne of God
[2:53:55] I think you're gonna have to read that
[2:53:57] last sentence I don't know if I can get
[2:53:58] it out
[2:54:04] Mercy Lord
[2:54:06] Mercy Lord
[2:54:11] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[2:54:14] let's go on
[2:54:16] and when you get back down to Earth
[2:54:18] again
[2:54:20] you'll go over that brother and shake
[2:54:21] his hand because you know what he's been
[2:54:23] through
[2:54:24] you can stand with a mortal in the
[2:54:26] presence of God and condemn you can't
[2:54:29] stand with Immortal in the presence of
[2:54:32] God and condemn anybody
[2:54:34] I don't believe no sir even if he's a
[2:54:36] rank sinner
[2:54:38] and what about a brother that's made a
[2:54:40] mistake
[2:54:42] folks I'm telling you
[2:54:44] when it's a believer
[2:54:45] when it's someone who knows the God you
[2:54:48] know it puts everything in a different
[2:54:50] perspective and in a different category
[2:54:53] we don't choose we cannot choose just to
[2:54:56] ignore it
[2:54:57] though I say he's wrong sometimes he's
[2:55:00] accused wrong when he's not wrong
[2:55:03] but if he is wrong well if he'll take if
[2:55:06] we will take him to the throne of God
[2:55:08] stand there shoulder to shoulder with
[2:55:10] our brother knowing he's Immortal and
[2:55:14] maybe his destination rests
[2:55:19] it's about to get quiet
[2:55:23] ER quieter
[2:55:25] and maybe his destination rests Upon Our
[2:55:29] attitude towards him
[2:55:31] when we come back from the Throne of God
[2:55:34] we'll realize that we're every one
[2:55:37] guilty that's where I want the amen to
[2:55:40] be
[2:55:42] and we all need help
[2:55:45] one from the other
[2:55:47] and look at what he closes with and the
[2:55:51] best way to do is pray
[2:56:00] we are standing perhaps
[2:56:04] in the most pregnant moment
[2:56:07] than we have ever stood in spiritually
[2:56:10] in this body
[2:56:12] there are Promises of God in gestation
[2:56:16] right now forming
[2:56:26] hoping
[2:56:28] Josh are
[2:56:30] carrying a little baby well hope is
[2:56:32] carrying it
[2:56:36] might look otherwise but she is the one
[2:56:40] who's carrying that little life
[2:56:47] and I have that little note on my desk
[2:56:52] and the other day I took that note out
[2:56:54] and I googled
[2:56:56] I looked at the
[2:56:58] at the when the due date was and I
[2:57:01] googled to see what that little
[2:57:04] sweet baby looks like
[2:57:09] in her womb
[2:57:12] and I watched as I looked and read down
[2:57:15] the list
[2:57:16] where they have taken natural things
[2:57:18] that you know of and and you can it from
[2:57:22] a from a poppy seed
[2:57:25] to a sesame seed
[2:57:28] was one of the one of the changes I saw
[2:57:31] over a week can you imagine that that
[2:57:34] little baby can go from a poppy seed to
[2:57:36] a sesame seed
[2:57:39] poppy seed you can hardly see and the
[2:57:42] next thing you know it'll be a little
[2:57:43] butter bean
[2:57:47] and and you read the little notes Stacy
[2:57:50] and I had our children in another
[2:57:52] century
[2:57:55] and we didn't know a lot of things like
[2:57:57] that
[2:57:58] but we had we didn't have apps
[2:58:03] we had VHS tapes too
[2:58:06] and we had boomboxes
[2:58:09] but anyway
[2:58:14] I had a little flip calendar that
[2:58:16] somebody gave me she might have given it
[2:58:17] to me and I got to look and see a little
[2:58:20] image of what what our babies would look
[2:58:23] like during that week and it's so
[2:58:25] precious to think of that
[2:58:28] so precious to think of the Miracle of
[2:58:31] Life That's forming in the body
[2:58:34] and it caused me to think about the
[2:58:36] spiritual implication of the Season
[2:58:38] change
[2:58:40] and a new Hebrew year opening up for us
[2:58:45] and and I began to feel something in my
[2:58:48] own spiritual womb
[2:58:50] that reminded me that the promises of
[2:58:53] God
[2:58:54] have gotten little eyelashes on them
[2:59:01] started off with little Nubs and now
[2:59:03] fingers and toes and uh are farming and
[2:59:07] limbs are forming look at it you mamas
[2:59:10] how many of you mamas have read read
[2:59:12] something like that or seen the changes
[2:59:14] that take place in a little bit it'll
[2:59:16] it'll it'll get you excited
[2:59:19] because spiritually I I was thinking now
[2:59:22] my promises has eyelashes
[2:59:25] what God is doing is farming here and
[2:59:28] some little legs and arms are uh and and
[2:59:32] and eye colors being determined
[2:59:34] different thing I want you to know that
[2:59:37] oh there's never been
[2:59:39] a more pregnant moment in the spirit
[2:59:42] than the moment we're living in right
[2:59:43] now
[2:59:45] eternity is unfolding
[2:59:47] and the invitation is get up here
[2:59:51] get out of God's way so you can get up
[2:59:55] here and let me talk to you about your

[3:00:08] that's breaking forth in the bride of
[3:00:10] Christ
[3:00:11] and we don't want any stinking thinking
[3:00:14] or any grudges
[3:00:17] or any unforgiveness to disqualify Us in

[3:00:24] to come and worship the Lord with me I
[3:00:27] want to invite you to come present
[3:00:29] yourself to the Lord in this new Hebrew
[3:00:32] year and I want you to believe

[3:01:13] we're going to let him know that we
[3:01:15] don't come here because we're all clear

[3:07:26] we invite you to come in right now with
[3:07:30] your pruning Fork
[3:07:32] to go right down into that vulnerable
[3:07:35] place in our lives where we may have
[3:07:39] allowed grudges or unforgiveness to
[3:07:43] abide
[3:07:44] Lord we want to leave it around this
[3:07:46] altar today
[3:07:49] we know the enemy's Wild
[3:07:51] we know that he rages
[3:07:54] we know that he's seeking whom he may
[3:07:56] devour but thank you Father you've given
[3:07:58] a strategy against the enemy
[3:08:01] thank you Jesus we take on the Belt of
[3:08:04] Righteousness we we belt ourselves Lord
[3:08:07] with your great armor in this hour we
[3:08:10] tighten up and we draw closer together
[3:08:13] knowing that the closer we get to one
[3:08:16] another the least Advantage the enemy
[3:08:19] will have
[3:08:20] to be able to take one of us out Lord I
[3:08:23] ask you right now to surround us with
[3:08:25] your love and care
[3:08:27] draw us in
[3:08:29] draw us in
[3:08:32] lest there not be one wounded sheep
[3:08:34] among us
[3:08:35] that catches the attention of the enemy
[3:08:37] that he could come and draw that one out
[3:08:40] and destroy that life
[3:08:42] draw us together right now pray with me
[3:08:44] Saints
[3:08:45] draw us together right now Lord
[3:08:48] draw us that we might stand as one body
[3:08:52] before you Lord let our souls be knit
[3:08:55] together in the ways of righteousness
[3:08:58] and Truth may we identify any connection
[3:09:01] spiritual or emotional that has been
[3:09:05] made with those who are not of precious
[3:09:08] faith and if so Lord give us the grace
[3:09:11] to repent for allowing that connection
[3:09:14] to form and cut it off in the authority
[3:09:18] of Jesus Christ teach us how to have
[3:09:21] connection and friendship with those who
[3:09:24] are not in the faith show us the
[3:09:26] boundaries Lord that you would have us
[3:09:29] to walk in
[3:09:30] help us find the balance of showing them
[3:09:33] Your Love Without forming Unholy
[3:09:36] alliances with them Ishmael
[3:09:40] Ila mahandaya Lord in this new year
[3:09:44] May each one of us examine our alliances
[3:09:51] may we examine who we have formed
[3:09:53] Covenant with
[3:09:56] and if there are those things that need
[3:09:58] to be dealt with provide the acts
[3:10:02] we can sever ourselves from the weight
[3:10:06] from the millstone
[3:10:08] that we might be free to move
[3:10:11] in the Realms of spirit and glory
[3:10:14] Lord show us your glory in every
[3:10:18] situation Lord I Thank you that in
[3:10:21] relationships where the enemy has
[3:10:23] desired that we walk in unforgiveness I
[3:10:26] thank you that you will show us your
[3:10:28] glory
[3:10:30] in relationships where grudges have
[3:10:33] formed I ask you to show us your glory
[3:10:37] as you separate us from our sin
[3:10:40] and you allow us to be drawn together in
[3:10:43] the unity of the faith forgiveness is
[3:10:46] the foundation of Faith Lord help us
[3:10:48] right now to turn loose of it
[3:10:51] I agree I agree I agree Lord with your
[3:10:56] ability and Grace to free us free us
[3:11:02] Lord if there's any person under the
[3:11:05] sound of my voice that has become has
[3:11:08] become one flesh
[3:11:10] with an unbeliever
[3:11:12] and never completely repented and cut
[3:11:15] that out of their life I ask you to
[3:11:18] provide Grace
[3:11:20] let it be as simple as possible
[3:11:22] let it let it let it be as peaceful as
[3:11:25] possible
[3:11:26] Lord that it would not have to continue
[3:11:28] to destroy present relationships but I
[3:11:32] ask for the grace to settle that thing
[3:11:35] right now in the name of Jesus
[3:11:39] if there is any person outside of those
[3:11:43] that we are in Covenant with that has
[3:11:45] any hold or connection or influence over
[3:11:49] us because of Soul tie we ask you right
[3:11:53] now in the name of Jesus to let that be
[3:11:56] destroyed
[3:11:59] if the enemy has found any way of
[3:12:02] controlling or manipulating us through
[3:12:05] Unholy intercession or witchcraft I ask
[3:12:07] you right now to break
[3:12:11] break

[3:14:19] who reigns with wisdomen with power
[3:14:24] bless the Lord
[3:14:28] who Reigns my life with so much love
[3:14:35] I want to say something
[3:14:38] this was not in my mind I didn't have
[3:14:41] this thought not any time during the
[3:14:44] preaching but it came to me as I was
[3:14:46] standing there if you are here and you
[3:14:49] owe someone something
[3:14:52] if you've borrowed money or you owe
[3:14:54] someone money for something let me
[3:14:58] encourage you to do everything you can
[3:15:01] to pay that debt
[3:15:04] because many times that is another way
[3:15:09] that a soul tie can be formed the Bible
[3:15:12] said oh no man nothing
[3:15:16] anything except to love
[3:15:20] and it's not necessarily that that
[3:15:22] person would ever use that or take
[3:15:25] advantage of you it's not that that
[3:15:27] would necessarily be their desire but
[3:15:29] the enemy is looking for anything and
[3:15:31] everything that he can use to put his
[3:15:33] finger on your life so let me encourage
[3:15:36] you and let me let me say this if you
[3:15:38] can't if you're in a position that you
[3:15:40] can't just touch base with that person
[3:15:42] if if need be if you haven't done that
[3:15:45] in a while touch base with that person
[3:15:47] and say I recognize that I still owe you
[3:15:51] and by God's grace I have every
[3:15:54] intention of making that right and maybe
[3:15:57] even by doing that you'll set something
[3:16:00] loose that needs to be loosed may God
[3:16:03] just give us Grace and wisdom to
[3:16:06] recognize any door or any window that
[3:16:11] the enemy would have opportunity to hold
[3:16:13] us in our lives sing it one more time
[3:16:16] being bless the Lord bless the Lord I
[3:16:19] had to say that

[3:17:04] wisdom and with power bless the Lord who
