[1:32] um but no it really is an honor to have
[1:34] you on and
[1:35] thank you for thank you for first of all
[1:38] I'd like to thank you for when I brought
[1:40] you this idea for running with it with
[1:42] me it meant a lot
[1:44] um even I have to remember when dad
[1:46] asked well who's going to be doing it
[1:47] and you know you said well Joshua came
[1:49] to me with the idea I think he wants to
[1:50] do it and you had full confidence in me
[1:53] and I really appreciate that and I
[1:54] couldn't have done it without you I
[1:56] would say you're natural well I'm trying
[1:58] I wouldn't try
[2:00] um but I I want to start
[2:02] get your testimony today and just talk
[2:04] about your life how you came here to
[2:06] this ministry
[2:08] um what the Lord is doing in you
[2:10] um but let's just start out back from
[2:12] the beginning where you were born uh and
[2:15] what it was like growing up
[2:17] well it's always encouraging to go over
[2:21] your testimony because it's
[2:25] it's so encouraging to to look back and
[2:28] see what God has done in your life
[2:30] um
[2:31] I'm born and raised in Iceland
[2:34] it's uh it's a tiny little island in the
[2:37] middle of Atlantic between North America
[2:39] and Europe
[2:41] you know
[2:42] geographically we belong to North
[2:45] America and Europe politically we belong
[2:49] to Europe
[2:50] but we're kind of mixture of America and
[2:54] Europe it's interesting uh
[2:58] growing up
[3:00] was interesting
[3:02] I
[3:04] I would say I grew up in a dysfunctional
[3:07] home
[3:08] I'm born 1982
[3:10] and at that time you know I had a mom
[3:13] and a dad that lived together
[3:16] and
[3:18] I want to be real
[3:20] and but I don't want to
[3:22] dishonor my parents yeah for sure you
[3:25] know but the reality is they struggled
[3:29] both with alcohol
[3:31] and when I'm
[3:35] around four years old to get a divorce
[3:38] but leading up to that uh
[3:42] my dad
[3:43] started doing some questionable stuff
[3:45] and got known on this
[3:49] tiny little island that only at that
[3:51] time was maybe around 300 000 people
[3:55] he was known for uh
[3:59] some stuff that I know he is not proud
[4:02] of and he would be called the like porn
[4:05] king of Iceland like headlines I didn't
[4:08] know it at the time I just knew that I I
[4:11] lived in a chaotic home
[4:13] and uh and so
[4:16] my Mom leaves him
[4:19] and she's just trying to struggle for
[4:22] life
[4:23] you know and she ends up meeting a man
[4:28] that became my stepdad
[4:30] for a long time
[4:33] but
[4:36] I remember moving a lot I went to
[4:39] different schools and and my dad was
[4:44] kind of absent most of my child did
[4:47] he
[4:49] he later
[4:51] like
[4:52] got saved and and God did a work in his
[4:55] life
[4:56] but he always struggled he had always
[4:59] his ups and downs
[5:01] ah I remember you know you know I had a
[5:06] lot of
[5:07] like identity issues my mom was not
[5:11] there for me like emotionally
[5:13] and at that time it's hard especially at
[5:16] such a young age yeah and she she ended
[5:18] up being in and out of rehab and and
[5:21] using you know I remember
[5:24] she using some pills and stuff and so
[5:26] often in the evenings it was kind of
[5:28] numb
[5:29] and so you can really you know connect
[5:31] with her uh I actually asked my brother
[5:34] not long ago like I remember my mom
[5:38] going for extended rehab
[5:41] and uh vaguely I don't have clear
[5:44] memories and I was like where was I when
[5:47] she was gone because my stepdad was
[5:48] often
[5:49] not home yeah he was often just you know
[5:53] working for weeks at a time
[5:57] one good thing about my step that he
[5:59] provided for me uh even though he wasn't
[6:02] like a dad or father to me I did not
[6:04] have a connection with him
[6:07] but he did provide for me and looking
[6:09] back I'm thankful for that uh were you
[6:12] and your brother close grown up we were
[6:15] but he lived with my grandparents okay I
[6:17] don't think I didn't know that uh he so
[6:19] I have
[6:21] I have two brothers
[6:24] and two sisters but my oldest brother he
[6:27] is the only one that is we have both the
[6:30] same that's the one we stayed at right
[6:32] when I went yes okay and I'm very close
[6:35] to him today you know
[6:37] he's funny yeah I actually absolutely
[6:39] love him yeah you know and I love
[6:42] talking to him I love being around him I
[6:44] can't get enough of it and I'm super you
[6:46] know thankful for him
[6:49] uh so growing up
[6:52] I
[6:54] I was always in trouble
[6:57] I was a troubled kid
[6:59] and and because I've you know I felt the
[7:03] absence of my dad
[7:05] and the in my mom being an alcoholic and
[7:09] not being there for me you know I I kind
[7:13] of lived on the street what I mean by
[7:15] that I didn't like being home yeah you
[7:17] know I just didn't like it
[7:19] and and then during school I was the
[7:21] troubled kid you know I was the black
[7:23] sheep every school I went to so I was
[7:26] the friend of the principal not really a
[7:29] friend but I was always there ended up
[7:32] going to the psychiatrist of the school
[7:33] uh
[7:35] then
[7:37] I remember when you know
[7:40] parents of other kids would like not
[7:43] want their kids to be with me you know
[7:46] they that affected me for sure you know
[7:50] I didn't know how troubled that was I
[7:52] have to be honest you know at that time
[7:54] I didn't know
[7:55] uh
[7:57] but
[7:59] I got violent and angry and
[8:03] and then leading up to my
[8:06] I would say early teen I would be
[8:11] scared to death
[8:12] like scared to death I put up a front
[8:15] you know trying to be tough
[8:19] but I was because
[8:22] I was afraid of responsibility I didn't
[8:24] have any good habits I was confused my
[8:28] life was chaotic I didn't like to be at
[8:31] home
[8:32] and you know in my identity was being
[8:36] the black sheep or the trouble kid that
[8:39] was always in trouble
[8:41] and in that kind of formed who I was and
[8:45] then
[8:47] in my teen years like
[8:50] how I
[8:52] faked it put up a front you know I'm
[8:55] almost just be honest I was
[8:58] a tiny little kid inside scared to death
[9:02] so I'll start smoking weed
[9:07] just very young drinking very young
[9:11] you know eight ninth grade I'm doing
[9:14] drinking and smoking
[9:16] uh and then I start to work out
[9:20] I played sport most you know I was
[9:24] hyper all my life like I was always like
[9:27] ADHD my mom tried to get me on medicine
[9:29] but said I always fooled the doctor
[9:32] uh
[9:34] but
[9:36] in my early teens
[9:38] that's where things got really sour
[9:41] so you mix a confused kid
[9:44] it doesn't like his reality
[9:47] with
[9:48] an anchor with drugs alcohol alcohol and
[9:53] then
[9:54] steroids I started using testosterone
[9:57] steroids pretty young
[9:59] and uh and so that was my mechanism to
[10:02] survival like I'm just gonna be big and
[10:05] mean yeah weren't and weren't you at
[10:07] some time at some point like the
[10:09] strongest kid in Iceland in your age
[10:10] group or something like that well
[10:12] oh you there's no way to measure it but
[10:15] I remember just being 14 15 like if I
[10:18] heard somebody was like approaching you
[10:21] know what I was doing in bench press or
[10:23] something like that I would like up that
[10:25] was just that was like your motivation
[10:26] just to like yeah you know I'm gonna
[10:28] just be strong yeah and mean and I was
[10:32] that's that will that's what you were
[10:34] trying to build to be yes
[10:36] but
[10:39] I went for further and further in drugs
[10:43] and so I end up uh
[10:47] like I have 10th grade education
[10:51] the school system is a little bit
[10:52] different in Iceland
[10:54] uh you you are in school until 10th
[10:58] grade and then there's like a in between
[11:00] like 11th and 12th grade technically
[11:03] yeah like here in between where you are
[11:07] like choose a path where you're going
[11:09] and then College
[11:10] I finished 10th grade but I tried to go
[11:14] to another school
[11:16] but I didn't have the ability to do
[11:19] homework to do the classes like I was
[11:22] just
[11:24] I was
[11:25] so
[11:27] what would you say troubled yeah and and
[11:31] I did not like my reality so I went into
[11:36] more and more drugs went to worse and
[11:39] worse like
[11:42] worst crowd yeah
[11:44] and I and I think you told me before too
[11:47] like the drugs over there are super like
[11:49] easy to get and everything so it's
[11:50] always around you is that right or
[11:54] at that time it was yeah and it's even
[11:57] worse now that's yeah much much worse
[12:01] and what happens uh
[12:05] the sad thing that happens when you are
[12:07] in that world
[12:08] is your conscience gets numb
[12:11] and you you get you get used to
[12:16] doing worse and worse stuff yeah and
[12:20] I ended up being pretty violent and so
[12:26] um
[12:27] I'm going deeper and deeper into uh
[12:31] addiction and I remember
[12:34] when
[12:37] when I'm realizing that my life is just
[12:41] starting to be pretty bad it's just a
[12:43] mess it's just a mess
[12:45] and
[12:49] and it was like it was living a
[12:52] nightmare yeah because everything that
[12:56] you did was illegal
[12:59] and
[13:01] I never like
[13:04] went to prison
[13:06] unless it was like overnight
[13:09] and it was usually for violence like for
[13:11] you know iodine or something yeah
[13:14] and I went to court a few times for
[13:16] literally bringing this was all still at
[13:18] a pretty young age wasn't it yeah like
[13:20] 17 yeah 18.
[13:23] and
[13:25] I remember
[13:28] the only plants that I had was like
[13:31] illegal my like my vision for life was
[13:35] to make money illegally yeah you know
[13:37] it's crazy that was just the kind of
[13:39] crowd that you were in right yeah and I
[13:41] didn't know anything else yeah
[13:43] and
[13:47] I I remember you know being in in
[13:51] Denmark you know and I and I Was
[13:54] preparing huge shipments of drugs over
[13:57] to Iceland yeah
[13:59] and and I would get lost for weeks at a
[14:03] time just
[14:04] somewhere in Europe you know and I would
[14:08] come back home to Iceland and it was I
[14:11] was completely wasted completely wasted
[14:14] and emotionally
[14:17] and physically
[14:19] at that time I was just in such a bad
[14:22] shape
[14:24] because I wasn't the best criminal
[14:28] I couldn't handle it yeah you know I was
[14:31] just used to stuff we forgot money you
[14:34] know I spent the money you know so it
[14:36] was just it created chaos
[14:39] even more
[14:41] um we're used to like really angry like
[14:42] an angry person that around this time
[14:44] still yes because I remember you telling
[14:46] me you're not trying to backtrack but I
[14:47] remember you telling me a story uh a
[14:49] long time ago about
[14:51] you were a little kid I think
[14:53] and you were at maybe a cousin's
[14:56] birthday party or something like that
[14:57] and you got like real mad at something
[14:59] and you ended up walking like miles home
[15:01] you were like 10 or something like that
[15:02] I think is what you told me yeah it was
[15:05] actually at a Christmas party okay
[15:07] and uh I got Furious and he's like
[15:10] walked like how many I mean it was a
[15:12] long ways if I remember correct probably
[15:14] uh 15 miles
[15:17] and you were I mean you were little yeah
[15:20] it was just so much anger built up yes
[15:22] that's crazy
[15:24] which is and before you people that's so
[15:27] crazy to me because
[15:28] like I could never see like that type of
[15:31] person like you tell me these stories
[15:33] and stuff and I've heard your testimony
[15:34] before and it blows my mind because like
[15:37] you were the nicest person I know so
[15:40] what happens is like I was just so
[15:43] broken emotionally yeah and physically I
[15:46] was the anxiety that I felt was crazy
[15:50] and fear fear of the future fear of was
[15:53] like uh you know it was torment
[15:56] and and I and this is probably where I'm
[16:00] like 19 20 years old
[16:02] things just get worse and worse I get in
[16:04] more and more trouble like I get
[16:06] things around them and just get darker
[16:08] and darker and emotion like in my
[16:11] internally I you know I get in really
[16:14] really bad shape
[16:15] and and really no hope out of it and I
[16:19] there was and at that time
[16:21] I remember
[16:24] saying to myself I remember it
[16:26] that like I'm so wasted and far gone
[16:31] that I'm never gonna
[16:34] I have a wife because I'm I'm in sort of
[16:37] bad shape I'll never be able to have
[16:40] children because you know
[16:42] I'm I'm so far gone emotionally
[16:46] and
[16:49] all my future plans at that time and I'm
[16:52] thinking this like have to do with
[16:55] illegal activities
[16:57] and so I say to myself like
[17:01] this is it you know
[17:03] that you know that's that's my fate
[17:06] that's my destiny to be a criminal
[17:09] and it was surreal it really was
[17:13] um
[17:15] but
[17:16] it was after that
[17:19] that God sovereignly
[17:23] starts to visit me
[17:25] I was renting a place
[17:28] with a friend and I would say I had
[17:31] lived in a few different places you know
[17:33] I I left fairly Young from from home
[17:37] and
[17:39] and I remember
[17:42] living with a friend
[17:45] and I actually I loved my friend and I
[17:48] actually care about him today
[17:50] we totally split ways and uh
[17:55] and I always think about him I've
[17:57] dreamed about him a lot and I prayed for
[18:00] him
[18:01] uh he was a really really nice guy
[18:04] but
[18:07] while I was in that state that I just
[18:10] described to you
[18:12] I would the only like this is the only
[18:15] way how I can explain this
[18:17] this is just how it is I don't have all
[18:20] that you know
[18:23] complete understanding of how the Lord
[18:25] did this but I know the spirit of God
[18:29] visited me at that State
[18:32] I would I would hit the pillow as soon
[18:36] as I hit the pillow I shot out of my
[18:38] body
[18:39] and
[18:41] I would be free completely free
[18:45] I would fly
[18:48] all around this Earth
[18:50] and I would go to different places each
[18:53] night
[18:55] and sometimes I was just you know it's
[18:57] crazy to talk about but I would fly over
[19:00] the oceans of the Earth different oceans
[19:03] uh Mountain uh different mountains
[19:07] cities and
[19:11] and I remember
[19:13] that one day when like I'm
[19:18] I'm awake and I'm hyper sensitive to the
[19:23] realm of the spirit
[19:25] I wasn't seeing in the spirit but I was
[19:27] like there was something in me like a
[19:29] knowing that was like I know
[19:32] there's more to this that I can see
[19:35] like awareness yeah and uh before before
[19:39] like all that started happening had you
[19:40] ever had like have you ever been to
[19:43] church or anything about God or
[19:45] um
[19:46] my exposure to church remember when I
[19:50] told you that my my dad had had like an
[19:54] encounter with God
[19:57] so
[19:59] maybe when I'm like seven or eight years
[20:01] old I don't remember exactly all of that
[20:04] is kind of blurry to me
[20:06] my you know my dad is in a questionable
[20:09] business
[20:10] and everybody knows about it in Iceland
[20:13] and but he gets saved and a week later
[20:17] he goes to Sweden for a Bible School
[20:21] and I remember
[20:23] that I went to visit him when I'm like
[20:26] seven or eight years old
[20:28] it to Sweden
[20:30] uh
[20:32] and I I think I I went I know I went to
[20:36] church I don't remember it yeah but I
[20:39] went to church a few times there okay I
[20:42] didn't realize what was going on with
[20:43] your dad at that time but I have like
[20:46] faint memories of that time
[20:49] my dad you know
[20:52] didn't have the ability to like walk out
[20:56] what God was doing to him I actually
[20:58] believe he had a great calling of God on
[21:00] his life
[21:01] because he's a
[21:05] he's a very convincing person he said
[21:08] he's a likable guy yeah he you know and
[21:12] and but he ends up moving to Talent he
[21:17] goes from Sweden he actually
[21:20] uh my brother
[21:22] was conceived in Sweden
[21:26] you know and I never knew my brother
[21:28] until he was a teenager
[21:30] their brothers really I didn't realize
[21:32] and his name is Daniel
[21:33] oh and he's a great guy I don't really
[21:36] have a
[21:39] close relationship with him but I see
[21:41] him when he visited Iceland
[21:43] so I would have to say I do have some
[21:47] exposure even though I didn't grow up in
[21:49] a Christian home yeah Christian values
[21:52] like the opposite but it wasn't nothing
[21:54] like you were experiencing when like
[21:57] like when you started having the
[21:58] supernatural yeah because I would say I
[22:01] would not like growing up I didn't
[22:03] really have a
[22:04] a Biblical world view yeah there was
[22:08] something in me that kind of believed
[22:09] there was a god
[22:11] even though I didn't really confess it
[22:14] um
[22:15] but at when this is happening with me
[22:18] when I'm
[22:19] like
[22:21] awakened
[22:23] to the realm of the spirit
[22:26] I had no idea what was going on the
[22:28] total honest yeah
[22:30] but and then I'm not sure exactly for
[22:33] how long this was happening this
[22:36] happened maybe maybe a month it could
[22:39] have been two months but I really yeah
[22:41] but after a series of dreams you know
[22:45] where I'm like I'm telling you I could
[22:48] not wait to go to bed
[22:51] just the experience that again feel free
[22:54] it was freedom total freedom and uh
[22:57] because I used to go and
[23:01] use drugs to to escape my reality yeah
[23:05] now I went to bed
[23:08] and got free wow
[23:12] uh the terminology that I would use now
[23:14] after Walking with God you know the Holy
[23:18] Spirit was brewing over me you know
[23:22] preparing me to receive him and how old
[23:25] would you you said you're like 18 19.
[23:28] there I'm probably 20 actually so still
[23:31] pretty young though yeah really
[23:33] about your age
[23:35] about your age
[23:36] [Music]
[23:37] um
[23:37] and and so what happens is
[23:41] I wake up like out of a bad dream after
[23:44] this after this season and I'm like what
[23:47] just happened to me and I'm like five
[23:50] years gone by in
[23:53] just craziness you know
[23:55] escalated
[23:57] but now I'm just like I wake up and it
[24:00] was like I I woke up from a bad dream
[24:02] everything was blurry everything was
[24:05] like
[24:07] I didn't I didn't remember
[24:09] what just happened yeah several years
[24:12] just going by like this and I'm like
[24:14] what just happened
[24:15] and and I say goodbye to everybody that
[24:19] I was fellowshipping with really you're
[24:22] live at that time is your friends yeah
[24:24] and I actually was in different groups
[24:28] you know
[24:29] somewhere like
[24:31] hardcore criminals some not that bad but
[24:35] life to me was just my friends and
[24:38] partying and stuff like that
[24:41] and
[24:42] by the grace of God I walk away
[24:47] completely shut off all communication to
[24:51] everybody and that I mean that would be
[24:52] hard to do yeah but there were I'm
[24:55] telling you it was the grace of God for
[24:57] sure like there is no explanation why
[25:01] why did I do yeah because I mean that's
[25:04] you know quote-unquote that's what you
[25:05] lived for is you know that's what you
[25:07] were doing like that that was like you
[25:09] said that was your life and so I stopped
[25:11] drugs alcohol everything totally
[25:15] delivered from that
[25:17] uh and a move into my grandparents
[25:21] and
[25:24] and at that time
[25:27] you know I'm still not a Believer but
[25:30] I'm like super
[25:33] interested and I would say consumed
[25:35] about what is going on around me
[25:39] like like what in the world is happening
[25:42] in the other Realm it's only like yeah
[25:45] and and so I start to look a little I
[25:48] would say a little bit into
[25:50] the new age not deep but that was
[25:53] intriguing and because
[26:00] I was I was trying to find truth if I'm
[26:05] just being honest I remember at that
[26:09] time this is before I'm saved I remember
[26:12] uh after
[26:15] this happened to me this Awakening
[26:18] all my passwords at that time had the
[26:22] word truth in it
[26:23] well because I was like I need to find
[26:26] the truth
[26:28] and it's interesting that I used yeah
[26:30] and it kind of just a random word I mean
[26:33] and what was so amazing is that my
[26:37] grandmother always believed in me
[26:39] you know I don't know why yeah and uh
[26:43] and I actually
[26:44] I loved her deeply
[26:47] and she never gave up on me and she
[26:50] provided me a home
[26:52] and that was kind of safe place
[26:55] and
[26:57] and I have to say that I don't know
[27:01] like how long it took for me but I
[27:04] remember my dad is more in Iceland at
[27:07] that time and had been for a while and
[27:09] I'm getting
[27:10] like more and more connected to my dad
[27:15] um
[27:16] but again I remember one time
[27:20] shortly before I get saved but still
[27:23] after this Awakening yeah my dad said
[27:26] the wrong thing and I absolutely flipped
[27:29] and I remember again I think I walked
[27:32] again like 10 50 miles just to get off
[27:35] all the anger off oh I had forgotten
[27:38] about it but until now
[27:41] uh because
[27:46] in my mind like I I felt like he
[27:49] betrayed me you know he wasn't there for
[27:51] me he wasn't there too like do daddy
[27:54] stuff yeah uh
[27:57] but
[27:58] like I love him today I love talking to
[28:01] him today
[28:02] well I think I only met him that one
[28:04] time but like when I met him he's a
[28:05] super nice guy super likable
[28:08] um
[28:09] net now do you think that
[28:12] has helped you
[28:15] become a better father to your kids
[28:17] because you didn't want that absence in
[28:20] their life
[28:21] like you wanted to be there for them no
[28:23] matter what yeah but it's taking time
[28:25] yeah I don't feel like I was the best
[28:28] dad in the beginning for like I have
[28:31] three children yeah and uh
[28:34] but at at this point in time 100
[28:38] like 100
[28:40] uh
[28:44] I was
[28:47] like I remember
[28:49] this is so interesting I remember when I
[28:52] was growing up
[28:53] I was like I don't want to be like my
[28:57] parents I was determined not to be like
[29:00] my parents but I ended up being like my
[29:02] parents really it's interesting how it
[29:04] works yeah because that's the only thing
[29:06] you can see like you you get molted into
[29:09] the image of your surroundings and so in
[29:13] my mind I'm like no I'm I'm not going to
[29:15] be like that and I ended up being like
[29:18] that you know and so the environment
[29:21] that you uh create for your children is
[29:25] so important sure because they've become
[29:28] what they see
[29:30] and
[29:32] and it I just remember like I'm I'm not
[29:35] going to be like them I'm not and then
[29:37] and but
[29:40] as I'm being acquainted more and more
[29:42] with my dad
[29:44] uh
[29:46] I remember that I was
[29:50] in a like an office space
[29:53] and it was connected to uh Christian
[29:56] television network which we'll talk more
[29:58] about in a minute sure uh connected to a
[30:02] Christian television network in Iceland
[30:04] and so my dad
[30:06] he had an old friend and I actually had
[30:09] a few memories of my Dad's friend his
[30:12] name is Eric Erickson
[30:14] and I had a few memories off of him of
[30:17] him or Eric
[30:19] but now my dad is doing some kind of a
[30:22] business
[30:23] with Eric Erickson
[30:25] and I'm coming to this office to see my
[30:29] dad
[30:30] and and there's a brother his name is
[30:33] brother goodminder he is working with
[30:36] Ericsson
[30:38] at the station
[30:40] and I think this was on the third floor
[30:44] and I'm just sitting there and my my dad
[30:47] is there and I remember a friend of my
[30:50] dad and I didn't know him a friend of my
[30:53] dad is there and brother Goodman there
[30:55] he he's a pastor in Iceland for the good
[30:57] mother is there
[30:59] it hadn't I didn't know brother Goodman
[31:02] then yeah
[31:04] uh and I'm just overhearing so I'm like
[31:07] in this
[31:08] awakened State spiritually you know
[31:11] seeking truth
[31:13] and I over here but the good mender
[31:16] explaining baptism water baptism
[31:20] to for my Dad's friend
[31:24] and for some reason I
[31:28] I have no idea why
[31:30] something perked in me thank you
[31:32] attention yeah I'm not a believer I'm
[31:36] you know
[31:36] I really don't know anything about the
[31:39] Bible
[31:41] and and are just there was something in
[31:44] me and I turned around to goodmander
[31:48] brother goodminder and I was like hey
[31:51] cannot get baptized
[31:54] and he was like what he was shocked like
[31:57] but he got kind of excited it's like
[31:59] yeah come come to a Bible study next
[32:02] Wednesday and uh and after the Bible
[32:05] study we will
[32:07] get baptized that's awesome and so he
[32:10] was going to baptize this man
[32:12] and I remember I go to uh
[32:17] I go to the Bible study
[32:19] and there's maybe 15 20 people it wasn't
[32:23] big
[32:26] but they were all
[32:28] significantly older than me
[32:31] and it's it was and so it's fun a little
[32:34] bit funny to think about it like I'm
[32:36] sitting there I'm 20. maybe 21. I can't
[32:38] remember exactly you know your age and
[32:42] all these people way older than me I'm
[32:44] in a Bible study and I'm like I was like
[32:48] what are you doing there yeah
[32:51] that's exactly how I felt and I could I
[32:54] I'd be honest too like I had no idea
[32:56] what he was talking about yeah no idea
[32:58] but I was I feel like I was being
[33:01] sovereignly led
[33:04] I was there for a reason and I knew it
[33:07] interesting
[33:09] and so I go after this uh the Bible
[33:13] study to another church and it's like a
[33:16] Pentecostal church that was lending us
[33:19] the baptistry their baptistry
[33:22] and I get baptized and uh and that that
[33:26] at that point I didn't know that he was
[33:28] baptizing me in the name of the Lord
[33:30] Jesus but you know what's funny later on
[33:33] I go to him like how was I baptized
[33:36] because later on I started the message
[33:38] and I wanted to make sure that he
[33:40] baptized me the right way
[33:42] anyway
[33:44] so I get baptized
[33:46] and I'm driving away from my
[33:50] from from the baptism and then I call
[33:54] pretty much the only friend that I had
[33:56] at that time
[33:58] we were on a similar Journey uh we were
[34:00] just
[34:01] trying to figure out life and he was an
[34:04] old school mate he wasn't with me in
[34:06] like in the drugs like I got I I got
[34:09] acquainted with him again after years of
[34:11] of not
[34:13] being around him
[34:15] and uh
[34:16] and I remember I called my friend I was
[34:20] like hey you don't you can't believe
[34:21] what I just did I just got baptized
[34:25] and I feel amazing and he's like you've
[34:29] lost it like I have no idea what you're
[34:31] talking about uh
[34:33] and that started me on a journey
[34:37] so
[34:38] slowly I started being
[34:41] uh around my dad more and around that
[34:47] television network
[34:49] and I can't tell you like one specific
[34:53] time like oh this is where I got born
[34:56] again
[34:57] this is where like I accepted God
[34:59] because when I went to the channel
[35:03] the station
[35:04] I was in my mind like I was full of life
[35:08] and full of energy and positivity
[35:11] and not saved and I go in but I loved
[35:14] going to the channel I loved going
[35:16] talking to the people
[35:18] and I was feeling sorry
[35:21] for them
[35:22] because
[35:23] I feel like I have this Awakening
[35:25] Spiritual Awakening in this you know
[35:28] there's a realm around me that is like
[35:32] infinite yeah and but they put
[35:34] everything in this one little book
[35:37] and in my mind's like man you're missing
[35:39] out literally and I told them and they
[35:43] knew my my stand
[35:44] ah but the more I was around them I knew
[35:48] they had something that was real
[35:50] and Eric Erickson he had like joy and
[35:55] peace about him that really affected me
[35:58] like impacted me
[36:00] and
[36:02] and then I was introduced more and more
[36:04] to the gospel
[36:06] and what was interesting at that time my
[36:10] mind was like God became a man the
[36:14] Creator like like I I couldn't I
[36:18] couldn't grasp it but my heart could not
[36:21] get away I'm telling you it was like I
[36:23] was drawn I was drawn to it and I
[36:27] couldn't escape it like I could not
[36:29] accept it
[36:30] but it took time
[36:33] and I remember
[36:36] when I finally surrender and this
[36:39] Revelation hit me is like
[36:42] there is a God
[36:44] and he is the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:47] and I I just surrendered I was like I
[36:51] was blown away
[36:53] uh
[36:55] you know I was forever changed because
[36:58] all the confusion all the problems that
[37:01] I have had finally I had identity
[37:05] like you know because I had been so
[37:09] confused and so scared and now the truth
[37:13] that I was seeking
[37:15] was open to me you know and I saw that
[37:18] it was my heavenly father that was doing
[37:21] all this stuff in my life yeah and I was
[37:24] like looking back now I see he was doing
[37:28] it
[37:29] uh
[37:31] and
[37:33] at one time
[37:36] I I just felt I wanted to be involved in
[37:40] what they were doing on the channel I
[37:43] wanted to help
[37:45] I started go to services and uh
[37:49] and because we know this ministry built
[37:52] on uh the Revelation that was given
[37:55] to brother Brown up
[37:57] so
[38:00] at that time
[38:02] I did not know there was like
[38:05] a messenger to the leadership like no
[38:09] great and I had no great that the owner
[38:12] of the television station
[38:14] believed that there was a message for
[38:17] the bride
[38:19] and uh
[38:22] but I was absolutely in love with God
[38:26] absolutely in love just
[38:28] with Jesus and I was so thankful
[38:32] and I remember one time
[38:35] that I am walking there's like a little
[38:38] hallway and there was all it was full
[38:42] both of tapes videotapes and there were
[38:45] some books
[38:47] and I remember I was arrested I'm
[38:49] walking I'm arrested and I feel like and
[38:52] I take I take like a I would call it a
[38:55] booklet it didn't look like a book okay
[38:57] because it was like printed on uh
[39:02] this size paper you know like from a
[39:05] printer yeah that you have in your
[39:07] office it wasn't like a real book it was
[39:08] like a booklet
[39:10] and and I take it and uh and I take it
[39:14] home
[39:15] and it was the life story of Bertha
[39:18] Bradham really yeah
[39:20] but still
[39:21] I had no idea that they knew about what
[39:25] out of all the books that were standing
[39:27] yes and I remember
[39:30] I actually take it home living with my
[39:33] grandparents at that time
[39:35] and I'm in my living room and I sit down
[39:38] and I start to read
[39:40] and it was the most unattractive book in
[39:43] the show I'm not kidding I'm not making
[39:44] that up that is the truth
[39:47] and I started
[39:50] reading the book and I actually cried
[39:54] for the first time
[39:56] since I was a teenager
[39:59] I just bald and bald and bought
[40:02] and I was like
[40:04] I knew somehow I was I was another was
[40:09] continuation of my story yeah
[40:12] and I was blown away with this
[40:16] and I remember I take the booklet and I
[40:19] go to
[40:20] uh brother Goodman or that I just told
[40:22] you about in Erickson's like
[40:25] do you know what this is
[40:27] and they were blown away they were
[40:30] absolutely blown away because they had
[40:31] kind of been in hiding because they had
[40:34] gone through so much persecution
[40:36] of believing
[40:38] what we call the message
[40:41] and because there's been like you know a
[40:44] lot of extreme uh feticism and confusion
[40:49] around it and uh and there's a lot of
[40:52] stigma in Iceland about uh
[40:56] brother Brenna
[40:58] and they had actually
[41:00] encountered a lot of uh opposition
[41:04] persecution from different denominations
[41:06] and pastors because because of it so
[41:09] they were not openly uh talking much
[41:13] about yeah the message at that time so I
[41:16] had no idea I had no idea that they were
[41:19] following a certain truth and
[41:22] but I was blown away and they were blown
[41:25] away
[41:26] that I was excited
[41:28] because it was like a breath of fresh
[41:31] air to them that you have a 20 year old
[41:34] a 21 year old you know somebody
[41:36] interesting in that
[41:39] and
[41:40] and that kind of
[41:42] let me on a journey of
[41:46] like started reading and listening
[41:49] to brother Branham
[41:52] so uh
[41:55] at that time I started to just work full
[41:59] time
[42:00] and I would with the with the Channel TV
[42:04] station yes and I remember like one of
[42:06] my favorite times was when brother
[42:09] Erickson would invite me to his home
[42:12] and just tell of the amazing stories
[42:14] that God had done in his life that was
[42:16] like I loved it yeah I kind of was fed
[42:18] by his faith and his you know
[42:21] sometimes when you're you know
[42:23] in your early stages of your walk with
[42:26] God yeah so you get you you get strength
[42:28] from other people's walk with God for
[42:31] sure as you're getting more stable
[42:34] and uh
[42:37] and one thing that is kind of
[42:39] interesting that I want to share is when
[42:42] I'm I think I'm 14 years old
[42:45] and I remember
[42:47] because of a little bit of my conflict
[42:49] with my dad
[42:51] he gives me
[42:53] a Bible
[42:55] or Christmas
[42:57] and at that time
[43:00] I did not appreciate it
[43:02] I actually was offended that he gave me
[43:05] a Bible you have this man that is not
[43:07] very involved in my life and he randomly
[43:10] just gave me a Bible and
[43:13] I I
[43:15] pack it away no idea what what I did
[43:19] with it but I remember
[43:23] that
[43:24] I
[43:27] after I get saved I remember that I had
[43:30] a Bible we are talking about
[43:33] seven years later years later and I
[43:35] moved from my home and so I have no idea
[43:37] and now I'm living with my grandparents
[43:40] and my
[43:43] and because of what was going on in my
[43:45] life my brother it affected my brother
[43:48] so much that he started to go into
[43:50] meetings he had I would say some
[43:54] experience with God before I think but
[43:57] now when I was you know all on fire for
[44:00] God and he saw what happened in my life
[44:03] you can ask my brother yeah you know he
[44:05] saw like the the total 180 in my life
[44:10] then
[44:12] then I remember I had a Bible
[44:15] so my brother's visiting my grandmother
[44:19] and here he wrote saying hey I need to
[44:22] find
[44:24] a Bible because he got that same
[44:26] Christmas got a Bible too from my dad
[44:29] and
[44:31] he goes so my grandmother lives on the
[44:35] sixth floor
[44:37] and it's in the basement they had like a
[44:40] storage unit
[44:41] and my my brothers like I wonder if my
[44:45] Bible is in that storage unit and he's
[44:47] like oh my Bible could be there too
[44:50] you know
[44:51] could you look for me
[44:53] and he's like yeah I'll look he goes
[44:55] down
[44:56] takes the elevator down comes back and I
[44:58] remember he's like no I do not find your
[45:00] Bible
[45:01] and I got disappointed but there was
[45:04] something that rose up with me
[45:06] no it is it is there your Bible is in
[45:09] there
[45:10] and at the same time Eric Erickson had
[45:13] give given me a big box we were talking
[45:17] like
[45:19] close to 100 cassette tapes of preaching
[45:22] brother Brown
[45:24] but I had no way of listening to it I
[45:26] didn't have a cassette player
[45:28] and and so I have this box in that
[45:33] apartment
[45:34] my Grandma's apartment it's not right
[45:36] there in where I slept
[45:38] so what I do I
[45:42] I go
[45:43] right right then when my brother said he
[45:46] couldn't find my Bible I tell him like
[45:48] Hey I'm gonna I feel like it's there I
[45:52] go down take that elevator down and then
[45:56] I open up the storage unit
[45:59] there's a little box right chest height
[46:02] first box that I see like I literally
[46:04] open and I'll open it up there's my
[46:08] Bible and a cassette player wow side by
[46:10] side and then I was like
[46:15] how annoying it was like a sovereign
[46:18] moment in my life that God had
[46:21] everything under control I used to have
[46:22] the Bible yes uh
[46:26] I use it every day
[46:27] and uh my wife for my birthday on time
[46:31] had it found in leather oh so is it the
[46:34] one that you that you carry around there
[46:36] yes I didn't realize that was the first
[46:37] one wow yeah it's very special to me
[46:40] yeah like I'm very sentimental to that
[46:43] Bible like extremely I understand uh and
[46:47] so
[46:49] I'm just an awe
[46:51] at that time of the sovereignty of God
[46:53] I'm just I feel like I'm in the middle
[46:57] of his perfect will everything is just
[46:59] amazing
[47:00] and and so now I'm gonna
[47:04] kind of start into how I got acquainted
[47:06] with your dad
[47:08] to this ministry yeah because
[47:11] at that time I'm working at the station
[47:13] and a lot of things is happening
[47:16] very fast in my life a lot of changes
[47:19] and I remember and what's amazing my
[47:23] grandmother sees what's going on in my
[47:25] life
[47:27] and see start to come with me to Bible
[47:29] studies yeah and to services and I
[47:33] remember she would serve and clean and
[47:35] cook you know help there and and and I
[47:39] remember also my my grandpa
[47:42] who I actually did not like
[47:46] previously after I got saved we became
[47:49] best friend because he dealt with uh he
[47:52] was an alcoholic
[47:54] and
[47:56] and I remember my Grandma coming with me
[47:58] to Bible stories and my grandpa calling
[48:03] station cursing screaming like freaking
[48:07] out you know
[48:09] absolutely freaking out
[48:10] but you know what happens he ended up
[48:13] coming to bible studies and washing
[48:16] dishes wow yeah like it's incredible
[48:19] dude that's crazy and uh
[48:23] like I said I'm telling you that was a
[48:24] miracle yeah absolute miracle and uh
[48:29] and I'm I like looking back one of the
[48:32] one of the things that I'm most thankful
[48:34] for is that my grandma
[48:36] I know she got saved you know I 100
[48:40] believe that
[48:42] and uh
[48:44] because I loved her so much and because
[48:46] he she never like gave me up hoping me
[48:51] the only one pretty much like that meant
[48:55] so much to me yeah
[48:57] um and so when I'm at the channel
[49:00] in an in that is
[49:02] something that marked me too was media
[49:06] for the kingdom of God and that set me
[49:09] on a path where I'm I'm still on today
[49:12] doing media for the kingdom of God
[49:16] and uh
[49:19] and I would start to film
[49:22] various programs different pastors
[49:24] different talk shows for Eric Sanders
[49:27] for Omega that the channel
[49:29] and there at that time there was
[49:32] actually a lot of things going on with
[49:33] the channel
[49:34] they were the first 24 7
[49:37] station for Scandinavia
[49:40] they were in the Middle East they were
[49:42] the third most popular channel in the UK
[49:45] for a period of time like it was a it
[49:48] was unbelievable yeah
[49:50] um
[49:51] but for Iceland for Omega I would film a
[49:55] brother named Olaf
[49:57] Johansson
[49:59] and I just referred to him as brother
[50:01] Olaf and from the Bible and I can tell
[50:05] you before I got saved I would I had an
[50:08] attitude towards Jewish people in Israel
[50:11] uh but but I was that was a very isn't
[50:14] that a very common thing in Iceland for
[50:16] a lot of Icelandic people very common
[50:18] yeah and I would say that is the the
[50:23] the attitude of the nation yeah you know
[50:25] very sad
[50:27] the newspapers are pretty biased and and
[50:31] also just the news and I can you can
[50:34] also for most part sense it on the
[50:36] people yeah
[50:38] and
[50:39] without knowing it I was influenced by
[50:41] it
[50:42] but you started filming the programs
[50:45] with brother Olaf they were called
[50:47] Israel today
[50:50] he from the scripture
[50:52] taught me to love the nation of Israel
[50:55] and love the Jewish people
[50:57] and and I became a good friend
[51:01] with brother Olaf you know
[51:04] and
[51:08] I'll remember he he would go one or two
[51:13] times a year times a year to Israel for
[51:16] extended time
[51:17] from one he comes
[51:19] back from one of the trips and he is
[51:23] saying like oh I need to
[51:27] I need to tell you about this brother
[51:29] who is from Alabama
[51:31] but is
[51:33] traveling back and forth from
[51:36] Alabama to Israel
[51:38] several times a year
[51:40] and you would be very interested in
[51:43] because he believes similar things as
[51:44] you and he loves Israel
[51:47] and that just perked my interest and so
[51:51] I go on the website revival.org how old
[51:54] were you around this time still maybe
[51:55] 22. okay so still really young yeah this
[51:59] is happening very fast yeah uh
[52:03] yeah I think 22 to 23. yeah I mean this
[52:06] is not like years have gone by this is
[52:08] like months they are happening very fast
[52:12] and I remember that
[52:15] I'm a go to revival.org and I read some
[52:20] of the experiences that Pastor Shelley
[52:22] your dad had
[52:24] and one of them was an angel talking to
[52:28] him about instructing people how to walk
[52:32] in the spirit and how to be be prepared
[52:35] for the end times and for the last
[52:37] harvest in Heavenly places
[52:41] and because of like my
[52:44] interest in the Supernatural and what
[52:46] what how I was led to God I was so
[52:49] excited
[52:50] I can tell you and something in me was
[52:53] like oh that's a part of your destiny I
[52:56] just there was a knowing and
[53:00] there's there's a brother he brother
[53:03] siki
[53:04] who I got acquainted with during that
[53:07] time
[53:07] I knew him from uh back in the days from
[53:11] being in drugs and stuff but I got to
[53:15] know him after I got saved I went to
[53:17] some meetings Christian meetings and
[53:20] he was there and we got acquainted again
[53:22] God was doing something amazing things
[53:24] in his life
[53:25] and I remember
[53:27] contacting Ziggy and it's like hey
[53:30] check this out you know this is like
[53:34] on an epic uh
[53:37] scale but you know because he he got
[53:40] interested in in brother Branham too you
[53:43] know I gave him the Supernatural series
[53:44] and uh
[53:47] and God was just doing amazing stuff in
[53:50] both of our lives at that time
[53:52] and so I I got super excited about you
[53:55] know
[53:56] going Before the Throne of God
[53:59] being taught by him prepared by him face
[54:01] to face encountered like I was like sign
[54:04] me up like I'm ready uh
[54:08] then
[54:09] I go to Eric Erickson
[54:13] and I'm like you have to invite this
[54:16] brother here and you have to contact him
[54:18] and
[54:20] and I don't remember how often I asked
[54:25] like still a little bit foggy like all
[54:28] the details everything I'm telling you
[54:30] is like I don't remember like
[54:32] great details it's like an overview you
[54:36] know when I'm trying to put all these
[54:37] things together sure then uh
[54:41] I know that
[54:42] he calls
[54:45] your office
[54:48] the New Hope office
[54:50] and actually my wife
[54:53] today she picked up the phone and she
[54:56] was I don't know if I ever knew that or
[54:58] if I did I forgot it and she was
[54:59] actually in the meetings in Jerusalem
[55:02] when brother Ola was there and so she
[55:05] hears brother Olaf talk about Iceland
[55:08] and Eric Erickson and
[55:11] and there was something in her that
[55:13] kinda picked her heart perked her heart
[55:16] I wonder why yeah
[55:19] um
[55:19] but so she knew
[55:22] who he was when he was he was called
[55:24] yeah and and
[55:26] I remember you know your dad talking
[55:30] about it
[55:31] like he she transferred the phone calls
[55:34] and I don't think your dad liked to take
[55:37] every phone call but she knew he was
[55:39] interested in the phone call so he picks
[55:41] up the phone and the thing he said like
[55:43] what took you so long
[55:46] to call
[55:47] and I think because Perry green had
[55:50] talked about Eric Erickson yeah I think
[55:53] maybe a decade earlier I don't know uh
[55:57] and so he knew about Eric Erickson from
[56:00] that time and so now Eric Erickson is
[56:03] calling
[56:04] but it's crazy to think about it took
[56:06] you a 22 year old you know young man
[56:10] yeah to get the ball rolling yes I mean
[56:13] it's crazy that it really is crazy thing
[56:15] but because with I mean sure it made it
[56:17] would have happened later on down the
[56:18] road but without you pushing and pushing
[56:20] this studio wouldn't be here today
[56:23] yeah it it's sovereignty yeah you you
[56:27] can't explain it other way I mean I mean
[56:30] like like I said a 20 20 22 23
[56:34] straight out of drugs out of alcohol
[56:36] you know like you said your life is a
[56:38] mess you find the Lord you come you know
[56:40] and all this yeah and now here we are
[56:42] sitting today yeah in the studio doing
[56:44] an interview talk about your life but
[56:46] like I said without it you know Dad may
[56:49] not have ever been connected with that
[56:50] with both Erickson or the studio there
[56:53] and then none of this would have been
[56:55] possible
[56:56] yeah I mean you're right like it's it's
[56:59] it's crazy to think about it's hard to
[57:01] wrap your your you know for me it's hard
[57:03] to wrap my my brain around it like
[57:06] uh
[57:08] I know
[57:11] I was super excited about your dad
[57:13] coming to Iceland and I remember I had a
[57:16] dream just before he came
[57:18] that he stepped out of an airplane
[57:20] with like a silver plate full of stakes
[57:23] uncooked like raw like almost like you
[57:26] see in a cartoon in perfect shape you
[57:29] know the fat around it juicy red steaks
[57:31] like you had a platter on them and uh
[57:35] and he comes to Iceland with
[57:38] one of the brothers from here
[57:40] and
[57:42] and I was I was pumped like I was so
[57:45] excited you know
[57:47] because I connected with the promises
[57:49] even though I hadn't been here just
[57:52] uh I connected with the promises that
[57:55] were for this place then
[57:58] uh what I liked about what you you would
[58:02] your dad brought was
[58:07] the freedom in the spirit
[58:10] like I love the brothers there like I
[58:13] love brother the Goodman but
[58:17] there was like there was an anointing
[58:19] that your dad carried that it was
[58:24] life-changing to me like it like it
[58:27] opened up something for me
[58:29] and because even though I'm like
[58:33] sold out to God literally you knew there
[58:36] was something more yeah like I had like
[58:39] I didn't do anything
[58:41] wrong at that time like I was just I was
[58:44] trying to sanctify myself like reading
[58:47] the word listening to preaching praying
[58:48] like this that was much yeah like
[58:51] walking with God I was like I was sold
[58:54] out you know
[58:55] and
[58:57] but your your dad brought something like
[59:00] it the more of the the spiritual uh side
[59:04] of of the equation
[59:07] at that at that time yeah and
[59:11] he came actually a few times
[59:14] and again I don't remember your dad
[59:17] actually came a lot of times to Iceland
[59:19] he's been there A lot of times and he
[59:21] did that in the beginning quite often he
[59:23] would he would come and film a lot of
[59:25] programs and there would be uh subtitled
[59:29] to Icelandic and they were also aired on
[59:31] you know in Europe
[59:34] then
[59:35] I end up
[59:39] coming here do you remember when like
[59:42] what year that was I think that was the
[59:44] first time I came with 2004 in 2005. so
[59:48] 2004 I would have been 22. really yeah
[59:53] if I think about it
[59:55] because I think it was like a
[59:58] I think it was a New Year's meeting when
[1:00:01] I came the first time
[1:00:02] okay say I would have been three well
[1:00:05] okay yeah that's crazy yeah it's crazy
[1:00:07] to think about yes
[1:00:09] uh
[1:00:12] yeah I'm I'm on I didn't realize you
[1:00:15] ever came here when you were that young
[1:00:17] yep I don't know why I thought I didn't
[1:00:20] remember I'm like I'm 90 sure yeah
[1:00:22] that's the meeting
[1:00:24] but still you came here when you're
[1:00:25] pretty young I mean I I guess I didn't
[1:00:28] realize that
[1:00:29] uh
[1:00:31] then I do remember your your dad came
[1:00:39] I said okay
[1:00:42] I'm trying to remember it could have
[1:00:43] been the year year after that but I'm
[1:00:45] not sure but in in one of the the
[1:00:48] meetings that I that I came
[1:00:51] I remember that
[1:00:54] your dad prophesied over my life and so
[1:00:58] do you know God has done a lot of things
[1:01:00] in your life you know
[1:01:03] you've experienced a lot he's you know
[1:01:05] met you and yeah changed you Etc but he
[1:01:09] wants to feel you he wants to do more he
[1:01:11] wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:13] previously I wasn't sure if I had the
[1:01:17] holy ghost or not because of
[1:01:20] the Deliverance I had because of
[1:01:22] Revelation I feel like I was receiving
[1:01:25] you know I was like I I probably have
[1:01:27] the Holy Ghost right like
[1:01:31] there's been so much
[1:01:33] in my life I must have the Holy Ghost
[1:01:36] but I wasn't sure
[1:01:38] and I I didn't have that like knowing
[1:01:40] that we made that are talking about
[1:01:42] exactly I did not have that and I can
[1:01:44] tell you that you know I hadn't talked
[1:01:46] to your dad about that yeah at all
[1:01:49] but he prophesied in a New Year's
[1:01:51] meeting like hey God wants to fill you
[1:01:54] with the Holy Ghost uh and I remember
[1:01:59] account for another summer camp meeting
[1:02:01] and uh and during that summer camp
[1:02:04] meeting I kind of things started with me
[1:02:08] in Mary Beth
[1:02:10] who is my wife now
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:13] it's actually a funny story how uh your
[1:02:16] dad found out about
[1:02:18] that she was interested in me
[1:02:21] okay go ahead um
[1:02:24] so in one of the meetings that I'm here
[1:02:28] like like camp meeting uh
[1:02:31] she was she was working with some of the
[1:02:33] videos and you know I'd worked at the
[1:02:36] church for a while
[1:02:38] uh she had taken a screenshot of
[1:02:42] one of the videos
[1:02:44] and put it as a screensaver on her
[1:02:46] laptop
[1:02:47] and then and then your dad wanted a
[1:02:50] meeting I know I'm not sure what the
[1:02:52] meeting was about and so she brings the
[1:02:55] laptop to his meeting had totally forgot
[1:02:58] that my face was on the screensaver she
[1:03:01] opens up don't you ever do that
[1:03:04] and see
[1:03:06] she got pretty embarrassed that's funny
[1:03:09] and I think you're that and I think your
[1:03:11] dad was uh shocked I'm sure and like you
[1:03:15] know
[1:03:16] I think maybe his response like do you
[1:03:19] realize you know his past you know what
[1:03:22] what kind of guy he was so do you
[1:03:24] remember that the first time you came I
[1:03:27] do do you yeah and I had just to be told
[1:03:30] uh just to be honest I think your dad
[1:03:33] shared about her and others
[1:03:38] before I'm ever matter in something in
[1:03:41] me yeah like
[1:03:44] but I don't know how to explain it there
[1:03:46] was something in me that just had I I
[1:03:49] got curious and yeah I mean and she had
[1:03:51] been here like I said working for the
[1:03:53] church or whatever and she had traveled
[1:03:54] around the world with Dad and Mom and
[1:03:57] our family for a long time
[1:03:59] like with see what's in in Jerusalem
[1:04:01] yeah see my brother Laurel when your dad
[1:04:03] met brother Olaf
[1:04:05] Okay so
[1:04:08] we could we get
[1:04:10] start talking a little bit
[1:04:13] we may have started talking before that
[1:04:18] again it's still the details yeah but uh
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:26] in one of the trips to Iceland your dad
[1:04:29] talks about he is going to Israel the
[1:04:32] fall uh one in the fall of that year
[1:04:34] that is 2006. I know that for sure
[1:04:38] um
[1:04:40] so
[1:04:42] he and he extends like an invitation
[1:04:45] like you guys can come to to Jerusalem
[1:04:48] and spend some time with us
[1:04:51] um
[1:04:52] and I was like oh man absolutely 100

[1:04:58] brother Shiki came with us uh brother
[1:05:01] Magnuson and brother Ayo we all went to
[1:05:04] Israel together and met with your dad
[1:05:06] and another brother
[1:05:08] uh from this ministry
[1:05:12] and I was pretty excited and one one
[1:05:14] thing I remember I think I got a call or
[1:05:18] an email
[1:05:19] and saying like Hey we're gonna be
[1:05:21] staying at the Sea of Galilee
[1:05:24] and uh
[1:05:25] would you want to share a room with
[1:05:28] pastor and
[1:05:31] and for the carry
[1:05:33] and my first response was like no I
[1:05:36] don't want to bother them like
[1:05:39] and then I was like
[1:05:41] wait a minute yeah I want to
[1:05:43] and like there's something like I I want
[1:05:46] to

[1:05:59] in Mary Beth like we started talking
[1:06:02] like on a serious note
[1:06:05] um and then Feast of Tabernacles
[1:06:08] 2006 I'm in Israel
[1:06:11] and
[1:06:14] and it was an amazing trip
[1:06:18] there there was a lady that kind of was
[1:06:21] handling things for our ministry sister
[1:06:23] Nancy at that time
[1:06:26] and I remember like I would give
[1:06:29] Faithfully towards that Ministry like
[1:06:32] the ministry the Jerusalem side of the
[1:06:34] ministry you know in the beginning I
[1:06:38] would always every month try to to send
[1:06:40] money to help her with what was going on
[1:06:43] there
[1:06:44] and
[1:06:46] I go to
[1:06:48] Israel had
[1:06:50] three weeks and one thing about sister
[1:06:53] Nancy she would have a schedule from
[1:06:56] morning to evening pretty much and we
[1:06:58] were like go go we were go go go but
[1:07:02] uh an experience of a lifetime you see
[1:07:04] so much you know with a person that
[1:07:07] lives and knows everything about yeah
[1:07:10] you know being there
[1:07:12] and at the end of the trip uh
[1:07:16] we go to CEO Galilee

[1:07:22] towards the city of Gala we actually
[1:07:23] stop at the River Jordan
[1:07:26] and your dad was going to baptize some
[1:07:29] of us
[1:07:31] and
[1:07:33] all on the way to
[1:07:36] to being baptized in my heart I'm like
[1:07:39] Lord I'm doing this now knowing what I'm
[1:07:43] doing because I have been baptized yeah
[1:07:46] having no idea what was going on
[1:07:49] and but in this time I'm going to be
[1:07:51] baptized in uh
[1:07:54] fully my heart is fully in
[1:07:57] what I'm doing

[1:08:01] the baptism
[1:08:02] and
[1:08:04] we get baptized and we go then shortly
[1:08:08] after that to the Sea of Galilee
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:13] I stayed with your dad in his room
[1:08:17] and I remember
[1:08:19] thinking how
[1:08:22] exhausted I was
[1:08:25] I don't remember if it was the first
[1:08:27] night or the second night but I'm gonna
[1:08:28] think this happened in the first night
[1:08:30] the first night
[1:08:32] I am just I'm tired
[1:08:35] after just being going going going
[1:08:39] and and
[1:08:41] going to bed
[1:08:45] it was actually freezing
[1:08:47] we icelanders don't use ACS and your dad
[1:08:50] was blasting that day and I was so cold
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:55] but then I wake up
[1:08:58] that morning
[1:08:59] and uh and I wake up and I'm full of
[1:09:03] energy literally you had an ice bath
[1:09:06] though yeah and
[1:09:09] your dad is going out of the room but
[1:09:11] brother Carrie we're three staying in
[1:09:13] the in the room and
[1:09:16] and I tell brother Kerry I tell him like
[1:09:20] I feel different like I'm vocalizing
[1:09:23] this
[1:09:24] what I'm about to tell you why I believe
[1:09:26] it is because
[1:09:28] I'm vocalizing how I feel before I know
[1:09:32] what really happened
[1:09:34] so I'm telling like yeah I just feel
[1:09:36] different I'm I have so much energy I
[1:09:40] feel so good
[1:09:41] you know and he kind of acknowledged it
[1:09:44] like yeah I think I think maybe me too
[1:09:46] you know
[1:09:48] and then just two minutes later five
[1:09:50] minutes later your dad comes just like
[1:09:53] walking in like it's like oh by the way
[1:09:56] there were three angels in the room last
[1:09:58] night
[1:09:58] and I look at brother carriers like ah
[1:10:03] and now I was so happy
[1:10:06] that that I stayed in the room
[1:10:09] and
[1:10:12] the angel that came to your dad there
[1:10:15] were three angels
[1:10:17] one by her dad one by me and one by
[1:10:19] Brother Carrie the Angel by your dad had
[1:10:21] a message for him
[1:10:23] and but then your dad noticed that the
[1:10:26] Angels were doing
[1:10:28] hand motions over our bodies and it was
[1:10:31] odd to your dad
[1:10:33] and he's like what
[1:10:34] what are they doing and he felt an
[1:10:37] inspiration or the angel talked to him
[1:10:39] saying like ministering to their needs
[1:10:43] and
[1:10:44] again to this day no doubt in my mind
[1:10:47] because I I felt the change yeah
[1:10:51] this was at like last part of our trip
[1:10:54] to Israel
[1:10:57] maybe two three days later I'm back in
[1:11:00] Iceland
[1:11:02] again don't remember exactly yeah but at
[1:11:06] that time I'm actually renting a bedroom
[1:11:10] in uh
[1:11:12] in brother Olaf's apartment so I moved
[1:11:15] out from my
[1:11:16] grandparents and renting a bedroom
[1:11:20] at brother Olaf's apartment
[1:11:23] and brother Ola was actually in Israel
[1:11:26] at that time so
[1:11:28] I go back home and I'm by myself in the
[1:11:30] apartment
[1:11:31] then
[1:11:35] I'll go to sleep
[1:11:39] and I wake up
[1:11:41] not realizing what was going on
[1:11:44] but I was like man I am full of energy
[1:11:48] not connecting the dots I'm full of
[1:11:52] energy
[1:11:53] what should I do
[1:11:55] and
[1:11:57] I used to work out I mean I still do a
[1:12:00] little bit but back then I would work
[1:12:02] out it's like man I have to go to the
[1:12:04] gym get rid of this energy how often do
[1:12:06] you wake up like yeah that's not common
[1:12:08] no I was young but still
[1:12:11] so
[1:12:12] I I take my stuff I throw some pants and
[1:12:17] t-shirt at my gym bag and
[1:12:20] and then I think I pick it up and I'm
[1:12:23] walking out of the room there was
[1:12:24] something like they hit my belly
[1:12:26] like where are your priorities
[1:12:30] and so to soothe my conscience you know
[1:12:33] I'm gonna like oh I'm gonna read a
[1:12:36] chapter of the Bible and then you go to
[1:12:38] the gym then I'll go to the gym so I
[1:12:40] started reading but then I started
[1:12:42] talking to the Lord and then I started
[1:12:44] praying and then the spirit of prayer
[1:12:46] just comes on me
[1:12:48] and then I just I go on my knees
[1:12:52] and after I'm praying then I started
[1:12:55] just worshiping God just God you're holy
[1:13:00] you're awesome and
[1:13:02] like
[1:13:04] boom
[1:13:05] I'm not exaggerating like an explosion
[1:13:09] my my belly started pulsating
[1:13:13] I started vibrating I started crying I
[1:13:17] started wailing
[1:13:19] and I started wailing in tongues
[1:13:22] and and I could feel just a river coming
[1:13:26] out of me and it got so loud and the
[1:13:29] voice that the tone of my voice
[1:13:32] I'd never heard it before it was
[1:13:34] different
[1:13:35] and in my mind what was interesting when
[1:13:39] that happened
[1:13:40] is like
[1:13:43] I was worshiping it wasn't just like it
[1:13:46] was unvoluntarily yeah but I was just
[1:13:49] yielding to what was happening
[1:13:51] but at the same time
[1:13:53] uh like what I believe now I believe
[1:13:57] There Was An Angel by my bed that night
[1:14:01] helping me
[1:14:03] to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:14:05] because I was so dry
[1:14:08] I mean I like icelanders are the
[1:14:11] European they're so dry you know they
[1:14:13] have a hard time opening up for the
[1:14:14] realm of the spirit but I know
[1:14:18] I have just a feeling the same angel
[1:14:20] that was in Jerusalem was there like
[1:14:23] help this poor kid he needs it and I
[1:14:26] think he was preparing
[1:14:28] my spirit and uh
[1:14:32] I know
[1:14:35] like in my mind's eye I can see that
[1:14:37] what happened I can feel my that was
[1:14:39] your knowing that was like it was so
[1:14:41] powerful yeah and in my mind I'm like
[1:14:44] can I stop this
[1:14:45] this is what I've been waiting for
[1:14:48] and I remember man I'm going to have a
[1:14:51] miracle ministry like this is what's
[1:14:53] happening this is so powerful like uh
[1:14:55] like my life is going to be changed
[1:14:57] forever
[1:14:58] uh
[1:15:01] and in my mind like I was like can I
[1:15:03] stop this how long will this take all
[1:15:06] the neighbors are going to hear me all
[1:15:08] of this is going through my mind while
[1:15:10] I'm just wailing like in in tongues
[1:15:14] and I can tell you because
[1:15:17] I had
[1:15:18] heard some negative stuff
[1:15:22] from some of the sermons of brother
[1:15:25] Branham
[1:15:26] not that he didn't believe in it in in
[1:15:28] praying in the spirit speaking in
[1:15:30] tongues
[1:15:31] it was just you saw some people doing it
[1:15:34] not living the life yeah oh Christ you
[1:15:38] know and so that's what he was against
[1:15:42] and so me being an immature believer
[1:15:45] like when you hear something negative
[1:15:47] like I got a little bit critical of it
[1:15:49] yeah but you couldn't tell me right now
[1:15:51] there's no way like that was so super
[1:15:54] nice I wasn't trying to come up with
[1:15:57] words like I was literally being
[1:16:00] baptized in the Holy Ghost
[1:16:02] and I can that
[1:16:06] changed my life for two reasons for
[1:16:09] multiple reasons
[1:16:11] but two main reasons it gave me
[1:16:15] I would say Like a Prayer life and
[1:16:18] I would actually say it would Mark me as
[1:16:21] a
[1:16:22] I would I would say an intercessor
[1:16:26] and number two it helped me to be more
[1:16:29] open worshiping
[1:16:32] in the spirit raising my hands being a
[1:16:36] little bit more free yeah not that I
[1:16:38] could of course I could be more free but
[1:16:40] that really changed how worship God
[1:16:44] so
[1:16:47] then I I felt after that I was so happy
[1:16:50] I'm telling you I was so happy
[1:16:53] because
[1:16:56] in the meeting where I had had the
[1:16:58] prophetic word like God wants to fill
[1:17:00] you with the Holy Spirit
[1:17:03] you you can see that I didn't just
[1:17:05] listen to that I was like oh I hope that
[1:17:07] happens yeah no I was playing yeah I
[1:17:10] wanted it I've been praying for it I've
[1:17:11] been asking you know multiple times
[1:17:15] so I that was
[1:17:18] um a major milestone in my life
[1:17:20] right after that Israel trip but at the
[1:17:23] same time I am gearing up in my mind and
[1:17:26] in my heart to move to Alabama
[1:17:29] so you had already kind of made up your
[1:17:31] mind that I don't remember at what point
[1:17:35] I did it but I had started talking to
[1:17:37] your dad about it uh
[1:17:40] and talking to Mary Beth about it
[1:17:44] because there was a little bit of a
[1:17:47] conflict because I was so excited about
[1:17:49] just the promises of God there was for
[1:17:51] this place
[1:17:54] because I really wanna
[1:17:57] have free access to the spirit
[1:18:00] to the throne of God and be prepared for
[1:18:02] the final Harvest I have to just be
[1:18:04] honest like that was like that's what I
[1:18:06] want
[1:18:07] uh I want to be used in that capacity
[1:18:11] uh
[1:18:12] but at the same time I loved brother
[1:18:16] Eric Erickson and I love what was going
[1:18:19] on there
[1:18:20] so I was and they had bought a really
[1:18:23] nice property
[1:18:25] like
[1:18:26] in the countryside a huge School nice
[1:18:30] land three houses
[1:18:31] and even being offered a house there you
[1:18:35] know so
[1:18:37] I was I was struggling a little bit just
[1:18:40] saying goodbye for sure because they had
[1:18:42] marked my life you know and not only I
[1:18:45] mean not only all that you're that's
[1:18:47] where your family is I mean even though
[1:18:50] you know growing up it wasn't the best
[1:18:52] situation still your family yeah again I
[1:18:55] wasn't
[1:18:57] that close to them you know
[1:19:00] and
[1:19:02] so I I have to say that wasn't my
[1:19:05] struggle at the time no
[1:19:08] um
[1:19:10] but I just it's a pool that you can't
[1:19:12] get away from you know
[1:19:15] then
[1:19:16] I come
[1:19:18] for another New Year's meeting I come
[1:19:22] here
[1:19:23] and I kind of have made up my mind that
[1:19:26] I want to go
[1:19:27] and
[1:19:29] and I remember that
[1:19:32] there was a sister
[1:19:34] that was visiting this place originally
[1:19:37] from South America
[1:19:39] not sure exactly what country but she
[1:19:41] lived in Florida
[1:19:43] Caesar Adelaide
[1:19:45] uh
[1:19:47] spoke broken English
[1:19:49] I would say very prophetic
[1:19:52] and funny
[1:19:54] always smiling laughing she was it was
[1:19:57] actually pretty amazing do you remember
[1:19:59] her I was trying I don't think I mean I
[1:20:01] know the name but I don't think I
[1:20:02] remember her oh that's I was just
[1:20:04] thinking about I don't
[1:20:06] anyway so see
[1:20:09] she calls
[1:20:11] somebody to try to get a hold of me it's
[1:20:14] like I have to see brother Hawk and uh
[1:20:17] then
[1:20:20] I'm going somewhere I think with Mary
[1:20:22] Beth and she comes
[1:20:25] she asked me to go meet with her so I'll
[1:20:27] make it on point to go see sister
[1:20:28] Adeline
[1:20:30] and see
[1:20:32] see started talking to me it's like
[1:20:35] I wasn't thinking about you I wasn't
[1:20:37] praying for you I was praying for my
[1:20:40] family I think her son
[1:20:43] but then all of but then you stood in
[1:20:46] front of me while I was praying and I
[1:20:47] could just see you and the Lord just
[1:20:50] spoke to me that I'm gonna transfer you
[1:20:52] from the army of the Lord
[1:20:56] in Iceland to the army of the Lord in
[1:21:00] Alabama
[1:21:01] and and that gave me a tremendous piece
[1:21:06] and I remember her coming to that was
[1:21:08] like it's very good that you're
[1:21:11] identified in the army of the Lord yeah
[1:21:14] she thought that was neat and I actually
[1:21:16] really appreciated it yeah because it's
[1:21:18] a big move going from one country to
[1:21:21] yeah to another country you know you're
[1:21:23] not just doing really different states
[1:21:28] and a culture shock yeah
[1:21:31] but
[1:21:32] at the same time I'm excited yeah it was
[1:21:36] literally Living in a Dream
[1:21:38] the whole process was like living in a
[1:21:40] dream
[1:21:41] and so that started my journey
[1:21:45] of being here as I move here in
[1:21:49] March
[1:21:52] of 2007. when did you get married
[1:21:56] June 2007.
[1:22:00] awesome yeah that is and now you have
[1:22:02] three kids and now I have three kids and
[1:22:04] I want to say I want to say this well
[1:22:06] because I know here I'm sure he'll watch
[1:22:08] it the way
[1:22:10] you were talking about how
[1:22:13] um
[1:22:14] like growing like you you were turning
[1:22:16] into your dad because if you know that's
[1:22:19] how you had watched yeah and it made me
[1:22:22] think about Joseph because he has
[1:22:25] watched you you know
[1:22:27] I mean honestly give your life to this
[1:22:29] ministry in in a way I don't want that
[1:22:32] to sound bad but you know exactly what I
[1:22:34] mean
[1:22:35] um and you see him stepping up now I
[1:22:38] mean
[1:22:39] whatever whatever you ask him to do or
[1:22:42] whatever he needs to do he's there if
[1:22:44] it's running the front camera if it's
[1:22:45] running the the back stuff now and now
[1:22:48] it's playing the drums like Joseph I I
[1:22:51] joke around with him all the time
[1:22:52] calling him what Joseph you're a beast
[1:22:54] and but I'm I'm being serious I mean the
[1:22:57] way he has stepped up
[1:22:58] you know is is unbelievable and that is
[1:23:01] because of you and the influence and the
[1:23:04] the
[1:23:05] um
[1:23:06] uh his his mom is a big part of that too
[1:23:10] yes but like with the media part and
[1:23:12] stuff like he saw you do this for years
[1:23:15] and of course Mary Beth is Mary Beth has
[1:23:17] been and her family has been in this
[1:23:18] ministry for years and and he's
[1:23:21] definitely all three of us are
[1:23:22] surrounded by great parents but I just
[1:23:24] said Joseph because Joseph here lately
[1:23:25] I've noticed his stepped up and it's
[1:23:28] it's I don't know what we do without him
[1:23:30] at this point he's actually like that at
[1:23:32] home too really yeah he's very
[1:23:33] thoughtful
[1:23:35] um helps a lot I've always said if
[1:23:37] someone's gonna be a millionaire in our
[1:23:38] church oh judge is going to be that
[1:23:41] person if he is he actually has some big
[1:23:43] plans
[1:23:45] but you know the Lord has blessed you
[1:23:47] with three beautiful kids now and
[1:23:50] uh I I mean I've I if so one of the
[1:23:55] interesting this is an interesting story
[1:23:57] quick yeah
[1:23:59] um
[1:24:02] my there's a
[1:24:04] there was there was actually a prophecy
[1:24:07] after one of the transvisions uh that
[1:24:10] your dad had
[1:24:12] talking about
[1:24:14] Esther
[1:24:15] and that the bride was like Aster that
[1:24:18] she would you know come before the
[1:24:20] Throne of God In Praise uh
[1:24:23] and there was that prophecy that
[1:24:25] actually quickened me of naming my
[1:24:27] youngest girl Esther Esther but I
[1:24:30] actually uh
[1:24:33] fought it
[1:24:34] disaster is not really a Hebrew name
[1:24:38] and
[1:24:40] there's some negativity around it but I
[1:24:44] couldn't get away from it yeah
[1:24:45] uh
[1:24:48] and so I pray and I pray and I pray and
[1:24:50] then I finally I settle like but her
[1:24:53] name is supposed to be asked her
[1:24:55] and sure enough
[1:24:58] she was born
[1:25:00] at Purim
[1:25:02] that celebrates the victory yeah that
[1:25:05] Esther was absolutely how old is she
[1:25:07] she's she just turned four she says
[1:25:09] turned four now yeah
[1:25:11] that's crazy to think about yeah
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:13] um
[1:25:14] but I mean like I said you you
[1:25:18] you and Mary Beth both but since you
[1:25:21] know you're on the podcast I'm talking
[1:25:22] about you you have been such a help in
[1:25:24] this ministry I mean I know Dad would
[1:25:26] agree with me he couldn't thank you
[1:25:27] enough for all that you've done and and
[1:25:30] not only helping this Minister you've
[1:25:31] been a true friend and not only me but
[1:25:33] to our whole family I mean I've talked
[1:25:35] to you about stuff that I've been going
[1:25:37] through I mean I've talked to you more

[1:25:40] parents because I know I can I can come
[1:25:42] to you I can trust you and you're going
[1:25:44] to give me not only an honest answer as
[1:25:47] a friend but also a spiritual answer and
[1:25:50] help me and guide me and I couldn't
[1:25:51] thank you enough for that Hawk I mean
[1:25:53] you you're truly a I mean it's just a
[1:25:56] pleasure I mean and we've also had the
[1:26:00] opportunity now to travel the world
[1:26:01] together so we've been you came to
[1:26:02] Israel with us when our whole family

[1:27:03] so what I did is like I I really prayed
[1:27:06] about it and I felt like I heard God say
[1:27:08] like yeah you should go
[1:27:10] and and I actually love this brother
[1:27:13] he's a great man great guy
[1:27:16] and
[1:27:18] so I go
[1:27:20] and meet him in Mexico
[1:27:23] it was a convention with quite a bit of
[1:27:26] people and it was
[1:27:28] split into like kids youth
[1:27:32] and adults okay and my friend his name
[1:27:35] is Magnus
[1:27:37] he uh
[1:27:38] he always preached the youth he's done
[1:27:41] it now for two three years
[1:27:45] and so I would go to the meetings that
[1:27:47] he would go with the youth and it was
[1:27:49] actually
[1:27:51] extraordinary meetings people were so
[1:27:54] hungry for God for the presence of God
[1:27:57] to encounter God
[1:27:59] um
[1:28:01] but what we walk into the first meeting
[1:28:04] and
[1:28:07] and during the first meeting
[1:28:09] all the speakers are being like
[1:28:11] introduced
[1:28:13] but I'm dragged to the states too
[1:28:16] and then my my friend actually did like
[1:28:19] the the overseer of the meetings like
[1:28:21] hey Magnus why don't you come and
[1:28:23] introduce your friend let him comment
[1:28:25] and then my my friend is like oh give a
[1:28:30] short testimony put on the spot and
[1:28:33] there's several hundred kids and most
[1:28:36] people that know me
[1:28:38] I actually do not like speaking in front
[1:28:41] of Gods like it's one of my things uh I
[1:28:44] actually really dislike it I can't help
[1:28:46] it you know I'm trying to overcome it
[1:28:48] but you know yeah that's just the fact
[1:28:50] and so I was like I'm put on the spot
[1:28:53] but I I gave a short testimony there
[1:28:58] and after that meeting
[1:29:03] there's a young man I think maybe it's
[1:29:05] the following meeting there's a young
[1:29:06] man that approaches me it's like but he
[1:29:09] doesn't speak English
[1:29:10] and he's trying to give my attention
[1:29:12] like I have to talk to you I have to
[1:29:13] talk to you
[1:29:14] and then he finally finds an interpreter
[1:29:17] and and I'm able to speak to him it's
[1:29:19] like hey
[1:29:20] uh
[1:29:25] I how did how did you get away from
[1:29:27] drugs like it's all around me you know
[1:29:30] it's Mexico yeah and it's like it's all
[1:29:32] around me like how can I
[1:29:35] I need help
[1:29:37] and how did you do it and for for me it
[1:29:41] was was Supernatural like there was no
[1:29:43] method too yeah but uh
[1:29:46] but on
[1:29:48] I felt like I I could help him so I just
[1:29:51] started speaking into his life I said
[1:29:54] you know
[1:29:56] I actually started asking questions
[1:29:58] trying to figure out where he was but
[1:30:00] then I just started talking to him like
[1:30:04] the place that you're trying to fill
[1:30:05] with drugs
[1:30:07] you you need to allow God to feel it
[1:30:12] and because he wants to
[1:30:15] and and I feel like
[1:30:18] and then I started asking him like
[1:30:22] do you feel like betrayed like do you
[1:30:24] feel rejected and then you start
[1:30:26] answering me
[1:30:27] it was like you have to forgive and you
[1:30:30] you have to believe that God is for you
[1:30:35] you cannot believe that God is against
[1:30:36] you yeah and he took all of it in and so
[1:30:39] and I talked into his life
[1:30:42] the best that I could
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:46] and then I think following day
[1:30:50] I mean there's lots of things going on
[1:30:52] in the meeting
[1:30:54] and maybe 10 feet away I see the boy he
[1:30:58] doesn't know that I'm there there's
[1:31:00] several hundred kicks 500 at least I
[1:31:02] would say yeah
[1:31:04] and uh
[1:31:05] so this young boy I see him walking 10
[1:31:09] feet away from me and then he just dives
[1:31:11] into the ground
[1:31:13] and he is Wailing sobbing just and like
[1:31:17] I could see him like this on the ground
[1:31:19] and I knew that he was having an
[1:31:22] encounter with God like I really matter
[1:31:25] and I'm so happy I saw it yeah I mean
[1:31:28] because the thing I'm thinking about
[1:31:29] that out of all the kids that are there
[1:31:31] he ended up walking like 10 feet past
[1:31:33] you yes uh and I thought about that yeah
[1:31:36] then
[1:31:38] not that service but I think maybe the
[1:31:41] next service he tries to
[1:31:43] find me like he looks me up and he's
[1:31:46] dragging and interpreted with him
[1:31:48] and he's like gracias gracias
[1:31:51] like he did it he filled that place he
[1:31:54] felt that he's like tears in his eyes uh
[1:31:57] like he was so happy
[1:32:00] and for me that just made my trip yeah
[1:32:04] you know yeah I mean that that just that
[1:32:07] one experience I feel like made the trip
[1:32:08] worth it yes absolutely it's because
[1:32:10] when you come in contact
[1:32:13] with your father yeah who created you
[1:32:15] the reason why you're here there's not
[1:32:18] there's nothing like it you know
[1:32:21] he is the reason for what we would not
[1:32:25] be able to talk to each other right now
[1:32:27] if it wasn't okay you know sure he's the
[1:32:29] reason for absolutely everything
[1:32:33] touch on this a little bit and you know
[1:32:36] get your thoughts behind it
[1:32:38] I know you you have such a
[1:32:42] burden still for all the people in
[1:32:44] Iceland yes
[1:32:46] um because like I said like you said and
[1:32:48] like we talked about drugs are so easy
[1:32:49] to get
[1:32:50] and stuff like that
[1:32:51] and
[1:32:54] for I mean when I when I went and
[1:32:56] visited it was amazing to see this so to
[1:33:00] see you know your hometown we would be
[1:33:02] walking down the street and you could
[1:33:04] Point somebody on the street and tell me
[1:33:05] I used to do such and such with that guy
[1:33:07] yeah that guy you shouldn't mess with
[1:33:09] don't let you know yeah and it blew my
[1:33:11] mind but you know just to be able to go
[1:33:13] over there
[1:33:14] to see where you grew up and stuff was
[1:33:16] amazing but you have you know you have
[1:33:18] such a burden for uh for Iceland and
[1:33:22] um
[1:33:24] for for me I wanted I do want to say
[1:33:26] this I think
[1:33:27] I I loved it when I went over there but
[1:33:29] when
[1:33:32] when uh when Daniel passed away yes
[1:33:37] which is brother Erickson's son for who
[1:33:39] I don't know
[1:33:40] when he was killed I think for me that
[1:33:43] hit me hard because
[1:33:45] like it needs something needs to change
[1:33:49] and something's got it I mean
[1:33:50] something's got to change
[1:33:52] and when that guy got I'm not trying to
[1:33:55] get too deep into this I'm not but like
[1:33:56] when that guy got away with you know a
[1:33:58] slap on the wrist that was
[1:34:01] yeah that that that hurt me so bad
[1:34:03] because
[1:34:05] you know I love I mean you were a whole
[1:34:08] lot closer to Daniel than I was but the
[1:34:09] couple times I got to meet him hey I
[1:34:11] love Daniel I loved him to death and he
[1:34:14] was doing so he was doing so good from
[1:34:16] what I had heard and for something like
[1:34:19] that to happen it you know of course
[1:34:22] it's hard to like that's so unfair God's
[1:34:24] got a plan though and God may have been
[1:34:26] saving himself from something way worse
[1:34:28] down the road and that's what I tried to
[1:34:29] think about I think you're 100 right
[1:34:32] about that yeah
[1:34:33] and like but like I said you have do you
[1:34:36] have any
[1:34:37] like I said I know something's got to
[1:34:39] change over there it does
[1:34:41] and
[1:34:42] you have I know God you know God has to
[1:34:44] do it I understand that but do you have
[1:34:46] any plans or do you have any desires
[1:34:49] that you you know you wanna
[1:34:51] that you're wanting to do over there or
[1:34:54] any thoughts or
[1:34:58] what I do
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:00] um
[1:35:02] it happened like many many years ago
[1:35:05] and I'm not going to go into all the
[1:35:07] details because it gets a little
[1:35:08] complicated because I'm trying to figure
[1:35:10] it out yeah
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:12] but it started with you know I would get
[1:35:15] a burden for Iceland
[1:35:17] nah
[1:35:20] and I would just start to pray and pray
[1:35:22] and pray
[1:35:24] and uh and now remember one time it's
[1:35:28] like hey
[1:35:29] God you have to take this just out of me
[1:35:33] or show me what to do yeah like I can't
[1:35:36] take it because it was overwhelming
[1:35:39] uh
[1:35:40] and then
[1:35:43] it was actually at lunch I was working
[1:35:45] for this church I go home from lunch and
[1:35:49] I go back I just lock myself in my
[1:35:51] bedroom
[1:35:51] go on my knees and say God I can't take
[1:35:54] it like it's
[1:35:57] I don't know what to do about it yeah
[1:36:00] and uh
[1:36:02] either take this out of my heart or show
[1:36:04] them what to do
[1:36:06] literally an hour later I get a phone
[1:36:09] call
[1:36:10] from Eric Erickson the the one that
[1:36:12] we've been talking about and he asked me
[1:36:14] can you come to Iceland
[1:36:16] I'm like
[1:36:18] really yeah I was like can you come in
[1:36:21] two days I was like no
[1:36:23] there's no way
[1:36:25] but I talked to your dad and we made
[1:36:27] Arrangement and I actually went like
[1:36:29] three weeks later something like that
[1:36:31] actually the whole story around that
[1:36:33] that would take two hours because I had
[1:36:35] serious dreams
[1:36:37] and
[1:36:39] but it's just too much to go into but
[1:36:42] basically I went on
[1:36:44] a journey that God was calling me to do
[1:36:49] something in Iceland yeah
[1:36:50] and I would say it's still vague but I
[1:36:54] know it has to do with truth
[1:36:58] and
[1:37:00] media for the kingdom of God yeah for
[1:37:03] sure you know
[1:37:04] and so I have to just what I would love
[1:37:07] to see I would love to have
[1:37:10] like a studio like this in Iceland and
[1:37:15] get
[1:37:16] more people involved like my generation
[1:37:20] you know to step up and speak truth
[1:37:23] because what's happening in America it's
[1:37:26] it's happening around the world it's
[1:37:28] happening you see there's so much
[1:37:30] confusion
[1:37:32] people are so confused and it's all
[1:37:35] people don't know who they are
[1:37:38] you taught Evolution you just hear it
[1:37:41] because of
[1:37:43] a coincidence yeah there's no purpose
[1:37:45] there's no consequences and people are
[1:37:47] out of control but people they don't
[1:37:49] know who they are
[1:37:51] and they're trying to change their
[1:37:52] gender they're trying to change who they
[1:37:54] are they're trying to find identity and
[1:37:56] everything and that's how I was
[1:37:59] identity is the main problem that people
[1:38:03] have it's not just evil they're just
[1:38:05] people don't know they're made in the
[1:38:06] image and likings of God they don't know
[1:38:08] it for sure and so
[1:38:10] when I knew that God literally was my
[1:38:14] dad
[1:38:15] that changed everything yeah you know
[1:38:18] uh still
[1:38:20] a lot of stuff going inside of my my
[1:38:22] soul my heart that has to be dealt with
[1:38:25] and worked on
[1:38:27] but that
[1:38:29] set the path form alive and so if we can
[1:38:31] speak to that to the younger generation
[1:38:37] clarify that
[1:38:39] they're not here because of a mistake
[1:38:42] for sure and uh
[1:38:44] and that there is a loving God like that
[1:38:47] would probably be
[1:38:49] my simple answer
[1:38:51] and I know it's I know it has to do with
[1:38:54] media yeah you know and then in truth
[1:38:58] and
[1:39:01] but I'm I'm trying to figure it out
[1:39:03] because
[1:39:06] one of the things that I I started to
[1:39:08] tell my family
[1:39:11] like
[1:39:13] my wife I was like Hey God is dealing
[1:39:15] with me that we should start to go to
[1:39:18] Iceland
[1:39:19] and we would should just start going
[1:39:22] over a period of time over the summer
[1:39:26] you know just to try to figure things
[1:39:28] out yeah this has been years in making a
[1:39:30] lot of prayers for sure and a lot of I
[1:39:33] would say striving in agony because I
[1:39:35] don't have the answers I'm trying to
[1:39:37] figure out the answers and when you
[1:39:39] don't have the answers very
[1:39:40] uncomfortable just be honest uh
[1:39:44] and uh
[1:39:46] and then I tell my family and I actually
[1:39:48] gave this testimony on Tuesday
[1:39:51] I I tell myself my kids my wife like
[1:39:56] God has given me to 2022 for us to go to
[1:40:01] um
[1:40:02] to go to Iceland and I actually the
[1:40:05] reason why
[1:40:07] like I had been working here for the
[1:40:09] ministry like full time
[1:40:11] for a long time
[1:40:13] and then with my friend my I would say
[1:40:17] my best friend and uh amazing amazing
[1:40:21] guy he's like I'm telling you he's
[1:40:24] absolutely amazing do you think we
[1:40:26] should get on the podcast
[1:40:28] I would I would love that
[1:40:31] but he is like he he is an inspiration
[1:40:34] to me and he's been
[1:40:37] an amazing friend like I can't I can't
[1:40:40] say enough about it yeah like I will cry
[1:40:42] like I ever talk about him I'll cry
[1:40:45] um
[1:40:46] but we started branching out uh and
[1:40:49] started our own video production company
[1:40:52] and
[1:40:54] in my motive was so I could go
[1:40:59] to Iceland in the summer and start to go
[1:41:03] to this path it was uncomfortable it was
[1:41:05] the unknown I'd have been so attached to
[1:41:08] what was going here on here every day so
[1:41:11] it was very emotionally uncomfortable
[1:41:13] for me
[1:41:15] to Branch out like that yeah you know
[1:41:17] you're in your comfort zone things are
[1:41:19] familiar but you know starting in your
[1:41:21] own video production business
[1:41:23] it was exciting but like who knows
[1:41:26] what's gonna happen long story short
[1:41:30] uh
[1:41:31] because of that
[1:41:34] supernaturally through what I did
[1:41:37] with that company
[1:41:40] I was able to go to Iceland last year
[1:41:44] with my family for several weeks
[1:41:47] but it wasn't because I had earned
[1:41:50] enough money
[1:41:52] so
[1:41:55] spring 2022 I'm supposed to go to
[1:41:59] Iceland telling my wife and my kids
[1:42:03] and I'm starting to feel a little bad
[1:42:05] because
[1:42:06] I didn't have it I did not have
[1:42:09] you know tickets housing cars all that I
[1:42:12] didn't have it
[1:42:14] and uh and I remember my wife's like you
[1:42:18] know we should Benjamin got married last
[1:42:21] year
[1:42:22] and and I I had told myself I'll never
[1:42:26] do a wedding video again uh hold up Hawk
[1:42:28] you gotta do at least one more uh okay
[1:42:31] okay
[1:42:32] and uh
[1:42:36] and I remember like I had told myself
[1:42:38] and I knew but because there's a lot
[1:42:41] that goes into it yes
[1:42:42] it's not my favorite thing to do yeah
[1:42:45] but because it was Benjamin like I
[1:42:47] wanted to do it you know
[1:42:50] and then I was like struggling like
[1:42:52] buying tickets to go to Texas and all of
[1:42:55] that but you know you you your family
[1:42:57] provided housing for us it should work
[1:42:59] all out but my wife says like I think if
[1:43:01] we go to wow
[1:43:03] that wedding like I feel like God is
[1:43:06] going to do something for Iceland
[1:43:09] and so we did we went to
[1:43:13] we went to the wedding and God
[1:43:14] supernaturally
[1:43:16] me telling my family for two years like
[1:43:18] Hey we're going to Iceland all of us in
[1:43:20] 2022 we got supernaturally provided for
[1:43:23] me last year
[1:43:25] and
[1:43:27] coming this spring
[1:43:29] I'm like I feel so strong I'm supposed
[1:43:31] to go back to Iceland with my family
[1:43:34] feel it very strong but financially like
[1:43:40] to make too much to take on and uh
[1:43:46] I actually I go before God it's like
[1:43:49] Lord if you want me there
[1:43:51] this summer and take one family you're
[1:43:54] gonna have to do it yeah four days later
[1:43:58] tickets car and apartment everything
[1:44:01] taken care of
[1:44:02] that's amazing I mean it really is and
[1:44:04] so
[1:44:05] that's just give me like it another
[1:44:08] confirmation I'm on the path you're
[1:44:10] doing what you're supposed to be doing
[1:44:12] yeah for sure that's awesome man I mean
[1:44:15] I can't wait to see I mean I know you
[1:44:18] you you have big ideas and stuff so
[1:44:21] I just hopefully I mean I pray for you
[1:44:24] and hope it all works out and everything
[1:44:25] for sure
[1:44:26] so I'm just speaking it out there like
[1:44:28] like a nice studio in Iceland to to
[1:44:32] reach the young people sure yeah because
[1:44:34] the young people I mean I mean like you
[1:44:35] said it's everywhere the young people
[1:44:37] over there they need help they do
[1:44:39] I mean because a lot I mean a lot of
[1:44:41] them are like how you were growing up I
[1:44:43] would say
[1:44:44] yes so absolutely and it's worse now
[1:44:47] yeah oh for sure it's way worse
[1:44:50] it's uh it's sad but you know we know
[1:44:53] who can take care of it that's for sure
[1:44:54] yeah
[1:44:56] um
[1:44:56] do you have anything else that you'd
[1:44:58] like to share I thought I mean I think
[1:45:00] I've covered everything
[1:45:01] I know you have a scripture that you
[1:45:03] want to share
[1:45:04] oh yeah I was going to share it in the
[1:45:06] beginning because your dad's like like
[1:45:08] we have to have a scripture so it's like
[1:45:10] I'll take one well I want you I want you
[1:45:12] to share it um but do you have anything
[1:45:13] else before you share it
[1:45:16] that you want to say or nothing nothing
[1:45:19] specific let me ask you let me ask you
[1:45:21] do you have if you had to give
[1:45:24] just a small phrase or not I say phrase
[1:45:27] but a couple of sentences
[1:45:30] I I we when I came to you with this idea
[1:45:32] I told you I was targeting you know of
[1:45:34] course all age groups but especially my
[1:45:36] age group and the younger people if you
[1:45:38] had
[1:45:40] you know like I said there's a little
[1:45:41] couple of things that you would say for
[1:45:44] the younger people in this than the
[1:45:46] message and this church what would it be
[1:45:50] I don't mean to put you on the spot no
[1:45:51] it's fine
[1:45:54] so
[1:45:56] it's okay
[1:45:58] to know about God
[1:46:00] and I would say probably a lot of people
[1:46:02] in the message know a lot about God
[1:46:05] then they're they're here preaching all
[1:46:07] the time
[1:46:10] but you can't know him personally
[1:46:12] without spending time with him
[1:46:15] the truth uh my biggest transformation
[1:46:19] is when I am by myself
[1:46:22] talking to him and he talking to me
[1:46:26] because that's when it becomes real to
[1:46:28] me amen yeah uh
[1:46:30] I have learned so much from like from
[1:46:33] your dad
[1:46:34] I would say like he has been the problem
[1:46:36] not probably he's the biggest influence
[1:46:39] of Truth in my life
[1:46:41] you know
[1:46:43] but
[1:46:45] it's not real to me to hear somebody
[1:46:47] else talk about God
[1:46:49] and when I hear him talk to me
[1:46:53] and then I act on what he tells me and
[1:46:57] then it becomes reality
[1:46:59] that's when I feel like life makes sense
[1:47:03] yeah
[1:47:04] and having a personal encounter with God
[1:47:07] is the greatest thing that anybody can
[1:47:10] have for sure
[1:47:12] um
[1:47:15] for me it's not I would say it's not
[1:47:18] easy
[1:47:19] you have to prioritize
[1:47:21] God
[1:47:23] and there is no meaning without him if
[1:47:27] you think about it yeah like he created
[1:47:29] us
[1:47:30] he has a plan for us
[1:47:32] and then we gonna live our life
[1:47:35] ignoring him yeah he created us and then
[1:47:38] he died for our sins so yeah
[1:47:40] yeah like I mean he's everything yeah
[1:47:42] and so my encouragement is like really
[1:47:45] seek him until you find out the path he
[1:47:48] has for your life for sure because that
[1:47:50] is the greatest Adventure you can be on
[1:47:52] and and it's the greatest fulfillment
[1:47:55] you will ever have in your life
[1:47:57] when you know that he loves you
[1:48:00] when you know personally that you're
[1:48:04] accepted
[1:48:06] and
[1:48:08] it's so worth it yeah it is so worth it
[1:48:12] the scripture I was going to share is I
[1:48:15] remember I spoke here for the first time
[1:48:17] and this is the scripture that I felt
[1:48:21] like
[1:48:21] as I was supposed to supposed to share
[1:48:24] when I spoke first time at New Hope okay
[1:48:31] I waited so it's Psalm 40 verse 1 to 3.
[1:48:36] I'll wait it patiently for the Lord
[1:48:40] and he inclined to me and heard My Cry
[1:48:43] he brought me up out of the pit of
[1:48:47] Destruction
[1:48:48] out of the Maori clay and he set my feet
[1:48:51] upon a rock making my footsteps firm he
[1:48:55] put a new song in my mouth a song of
[1:48:58] praise to our God many will see and fear
[1:49:02] and will trust in the Lord amen
[1:49:06] that's good and so I can absolutely
[1:49:09] that's my testimony yeah you know he put
[1:49:11] me on a on a path that has been firm and
[1:49:14] I'm so glad yeah that's amazing Hawk I
[1:49:18] mean
[1:49:20] it's just sit down I mean I've heard
[1:49:22] bits and piece of your testimony before
[1:49:24] you've shared it here in church or to
[1:49:25] sit down with you and talk to you about
[1:49:26] everything like this has been a great
[1:49:27] honor and like I said this this part not

[1:49:45] Iceland in 2016 and we were seriously
[1:49:48] that like your dad was like yeah we have
[1:49:50] to do it we're gonna do it and then in
[1:49:53] 2017 we did it
[1:49:56] it's amazing to see what God's doing
[1:49:58] that's for sure and like I said it's
[1:50:00] just with this itself it's encouraging
