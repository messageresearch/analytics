TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award praise the Lord this is Pastor Steven Shelley from the new hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama I have good news for you today Jesus is alive and well I want you to know that he loves you and he desires to help you in your time of need in fact he paid a price the ultimate price the supreme price for your life and that was with his own blood and I believe today that the blood of Jesus Christ still avails there's still life in that blood if you will repent of your sins and invite him into your heart he will come in with his life and not only live in you but he will live through you we are coming to you again today in partnership with the gospel channel and I know that many of you are blessed by the good Holy Ghost programming that is available to you here on the gospel channel and we just consider it a privilege to be partners with them in helping with the end time harvest we want to remind you that this is a program where we invite you to call in or write in with your prayer requests because we believe not only in the power and blessing of prayer but we believe in the power of God to meet your need I believe that the Lord Jesus is still a healer and he is still a deliverer he is still a savior and I have in front of me a whole stack of your needs your prayer requests and we're hearing from new friends that we haven't heard from before and we are taking these prayer requests before the Lord he tells us that we should come to him that we should cast all of our on him because he cares for us I know sometimes when you're in the heat of the battle it's hard to feel cared about or loved but I want you to know that your heavenly Father does care and he does love you he's asking only one thing of you today and that is that you would surrender your will that you would allow him to come in and wash you with his blood and redeem you and live in you and through you as we said a moment ago total surrender it's it's it's sounds very easy but in practicality it may be a little harder than it sounds because there's always the will of the flesh there's always that Adamic nature that wants to pull us away from surrender to the Word of God and so we we fight a battle just like the Apostle Paul of old we're fighting a battle but guess what we win through Jesus Christ let me share this verse of scripture with you and then I want to introduce you to my very special guest today who is all the way from well born in Zimbabwe but now living in Zambia in on the continent of Africa a full-time evangelist and my what a blessing he has been to our local church body over the past few days and I'll introduce him to you in a moment but this was the verse of scripture that I woke up with this morning and I'm going to read it from the amplified version of the Bible and I say a chapter 54 and verse 17 but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper now this is a promise to the children of the Lord and you are his child if you have repented of your sins and believed him for the salvation of your soul that makes you one of God's children and if you will walk in covenant with him obeying his word striving to the best of your strength to live the life that he is calling you to now that's not trusting in your righteousness we're trusting in his righteousness but if you can say that this is my life this is what I'm trying to do to the best of my ability through faith then this is yours so you take it with you now but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong the peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the servants of the Lord that's what we are we're servants of the Lord those in whom the ideal listen to this those in whom the ideal servant of the Lord is reproduced now I love the way this classic amplified version of the Bible brings that out because Jesus is the ideal servant and his life is being reproduced in us this is the righteousness or the vindication which they obtain from me this is that which I impart to them as their justification says the Lord I love the way that reads God is imparting to us justification through salvation and redemption it is a gift to us if we can only believe I'm anxious to hear what the Lord will say to all of us today through our precious brother Caleb Nene all the way from Zam via Africa god bless you brother welcome to our program today thank you very much pasta Shelly good to meet you god bless you so much we are so blessed in the last few days with your not only your preaching your preaching has been a real blessing but I've enjoyed getting to know you and having a little more fellowship with you we well we've been social media friends for a long time but we only met just a few months back in in Easter time in Ghana West Africa where we were preaching and I felt honored that you would take a little time out of your schedule to come and be in our meetings that's very true you know you're younger than I am yeah and I'd like for you to tell the people your age and I would also like for you to just begin to share how you came to the Lord I know you were raised in a Christian home but that doesn't automatically make us Christians does it we have to make our own decisions and I especially love your testimony of how you really had no thoughts of being a preacher right but God had a better thought about you than you had about yourself that's so what you just shared with the people a little bit about you and and your call thank you so much viewers like he said I'm brother Caleb noe from born in Zimbabwe but currently residing in Zambia which is the next country I came to the Lord I'm 27 years old and I came to the Lord in 2013 but I was born and bred in in the message but being born in the message does not make you a believer I have to have a personal encounter with God amen I'm born from a pastoral family and I also felt there is something that I needed more than just become than just being a pastor son right so I came into the Lord and I never wanted to preach because I could see what my father would go through so preaching was never my thing I vowed to God that if I want to serve God let me just do music and I can praise him through music praise and worship but that was not God's plan right God wanted me to Minister the gospel and that's why I'm here absolutely right so in 2013 I had gathered some musicians from different churches they started seeing my leadership qualities when I was too young and I gathered them together we have music days like weekends on Saturday I'll pay for the studio and out gather the youth they would sing so travel sometimes to churches different churches trying to bring unity because we believe that where there is unity God commands a blessing so I remember we used to go for conventions or weddings they would hire us sometimes to do it for free and just to bring you need to among the young people I remember I was driving on the 31st of December 2014 traveling to do one of our music it was an overnight service so I remember that day I was driving to a place called bin Dora and I was cruising because I was late and the choir members have already already arrived and I'm supposed to be there so I was under pressure so I was moving at a 160 km/h and it was raining and the road was too sloppy Omar and I approached a certain cave and the certain colleges cross the white line and then I panicked and then the cars veered off the road and I hit the bridge and I of attended three times why but the second time I was thrown out by the window and I landed in the bridge on the rock but I was wearing a suit so the water would come inside of me and I remember it was a terrible thing also hatred I went flat I went unconscious right there and they I don't even remember what happened I only remembered that the car just over tend and then I lost control I lost my mind and I went unconscious so they took my body they put it on the side of the road so that's the time when what's up was introduced it's quite common in Africa but I remember people were taking pictures on their phones instead of taking me to the hospital they were taking pictures with their phones and sending on whatsapp I said in drunken man just came and said wow like this this guy why can't you take him to the hospital and these ladies and these people who had just arrived they said he's already dead there's no need for us to rush my and my other brother who was in the car he was in shock he was just crying crying that I'm dead and he's confused it's in shock so this drunkard was driving a truck he just took me put me in the truck and then straight away we went to the hospital a private hospital called Shashi private hospital in Ventura it's about ten kilometers away from the city so we went there and I remember they put me on a stretcher my bones were broken so the first thing they wanted to make sure was to check if I'm if I'm well I remember I had a cell phone in my pocket and I had a small phone in the big phone but the big phone we lost it so I had a small phone we call it got you know you know you know you know a country it got forward those small small phones so they tried to call my dad he was the last person I dialed so normally my dad before he preaches normally switches off his phone that day he forgot to put it on flight mode Wow and he was about to go and preach mmm he found a phone call coming and his life was calling me this time that was around 7 or 8 p.m. normally in our country when we have 31 December we do in a crossover service right so he was about to go and preach so he receives a call and these people are saying this is we are calling from the hospital we have your son he has been involved in a horrific accident mine and my father has to say how is the situation and they didn't want to disappoint him you know how they talk they're so sweet he's not so bad he's not good it's not bad so my dad just said okay is he talking and then they said we can't say that now my dad says okay remember I'm still unconscious I'm on the stretcher they asked and said okay just put the phone on his right ear I don't need to pray for him he was in a place which is about 140 something miles away Wow and he prayed for me on the phone and I came back to life Wow Wow I started hearing noise around you know I was standards like what am i I was thinking of dreaming and I wake up I ask where am I and I'm on the stretcher so they wanted to do some x-ray to check if I have maybe broken bones or black clothes or inside bleeding so they took me into a special world and then they started checking on me but they realised that the legs were already broken it was really bad and after that what happened was I slept they injected me some injections so that my body could cool down and some people were ahead about the accident they also had to come and see me and some people were also praying that I I could recover so well but I remember to cut the long story short I remember I slept after midnight and then after sleeping it's like I was more like in a dream more like a vision and I was I really truly saw my body lying on on the on the world on the stretcher on the bed and I literally saw my body and my spirit I felt lifted up and I studied feeling like I'm in the clouds and I'm feeling like I'm dreaming then these things are happening literally and then I heard a voice and I was thinking of going up or coming down so what I simply did because that time was already staying alone and I was thinking to say if I die like this what about my mother because I promised my mom to say I'll see you next year meaning tomorrow I was like a job right so I was like I'll buy you some chocolates because I love her so much and she was also think - waiting to see me after a long time because that December we had a busy program so I started thinking if I go without saying goodbye how is she gonna take it so I had a voice which says okay if you go back on earth go and win souls for Christ go and break the good news and win souls for Christ remember I never wanted to preach right I just wanted to be a musician but I'm being told to go and minister so within a split of a second I came back into this body and I felt so heavy and I scream and literally I was sweating that time and then the neces came running oh and they are wondering what's happening with this brother and then I said I want to rush to the restroom because I really need to release myself right now so they told me that okay we're gonna push in a stretcher and we're gonna ask the male nurses to help you I said I want to walk I want to walk right now they said no you can walk you walk tomorrow trying to comfort me right they knew I can't walk because these bones are broken Wow with that power after that experience I just came out of the bed and literally walked but it was slow but I worked and went to the bathroom they were shocked they said what I hid them so me myself I did they never told me your legs are broken and but I couldn't feel my legs before so I went to the restroom then I came little by little I came I walked and then I came back so I had these nurses they came to me and asked me who are you mmm what is happening to you so they had to sit me diet to explain the experience that I then they said this court that yourself is too much we watched it they showed me the the x-ray papers I remember giving a testimony in a mount in my country different churches sharing those x-ray papers and showing how my bones were broken but from that experience it was just a paradox something incredible but yet it's true so the bones in your legs were just mended back together they were mended back together supernatural supernatural so I came back in this body and then I started feeling okay I was supposed to stay in the hospital for two months while they are monitoring me but because of the supernatural in the next morning the first of January I left the hospital Wow overnight overnight and remember I couldn't walk though I had a swollen head but I recovered within a few days my birthday's on the 7th of January remember this is 1 January so I thought I was not gonna celebrate that birthday but I celebrated that birthday I remember wearing a gray suit yeah and people came and I was laughing with them and I told myself that I'll never drive again now that you know after an accident normally people say I'll never drive again but on the third or fourth day I was already driving so that was a supernatural miracle so since then I I was in Zimbabwe then I had to be transferred back to Zambia I went to Zambia and now I want to explain a bit about how I started preaching please now this is the most interesting part now I went to Zambia I reached in Lusaka and I met one of the brothers called pastor piri and he told me that I know your dad is a pastor and could you preach for us I never had preached before and I'm thinking okay what am I going to speak about so he said it was on a Friday he said tomorrow make sure we have home cells and you should come prepared at 2:00 p.m. we gather as families and you're gonna preach for us now basically messages of faith they are very very easy to preach on so I remember I preached about faith and I went there I was so nervous I had so much stage fright and I was so scared to stand before people and I preached and people were literally blessed course they were and after getting blessed what happened was the pasta was so much taged he says you're taking tomorrow service so from home cell into the pulpit on a Sunday morning and I went there and I preached I remember I preached a message called redeeming the time because the days are evil I increase that message it was a blessing altogether and the pastor said you know what we need to promote this gift he called one of the friends in Chama and he connected me to that pasta that pastor asked me to come the next weekend I went on a Friday they received me so well I reached there and it was tremendous after that we had an altar call weird we were to pray for the people so I met a certain businessman and God gave me a revelation to talk to that man and I spoke to him and I told him things that I met him for the first time and he was literally shocked because even if I was being if someone had told me there was some serious is sensitive information that even no one would know and God gave him a revelation I spoke to him and he was literally touched he had a university he needed the license for him to start operating on the University and he was struggling for almost two years the government was not issuing them the license so I also told him that you've been praying for something but from today I'm praying that God will change your situation yes and he believed it and after believing it he went back myself I just went back to the pastors who are supposed to travel back to the capital city then they asked me to extend probably a day or two so I can minister also on Tuesday so on Monday this is Sunday on Monday the government guys higher education of Zambia they code this brother they said we've been quiet but we have thought of you know coming and doing some inspection on your University just make sure we're sending our guys during the week make sure the windows are there the water is running and the toilets are functioning we and the way you obtained you have painted all the buildings we are coming and to inspect Wow the next day he gets this go got the cracker waiting a long time yeah Nick literally called me he said where are you I said I'm still in coma he's like okay I'm sending my driver to come and pick you send me your passport he needed my my debt of bet and the full names he got me a ticket to fly to Lusaka he said now you're staying with me so we went to Lucifer he asked me how much do you get I told him where I was working he said okay I'm gonna pay you double but we're gonna start staying together well I'll give you a company car I'll give you everything but you'll be staying at my house I can't leave this kind of grace Oh so from the we got a lot of testimonies to share but I'm just sharing this one because it has really contributed to where I am today so I met his wife and the children there in the capital city they're so wonderful family and that was now in 2015 now 2015 was going on and on and we were doing so well with this brother and then he saw me as his son because he's got two sons but he saw me as probably his firstborn and he would treat me so well and but the only challenge was now he made me a manager I was now so busy doing a couple of things and I couldn't find time to have church men to go to church I couldn't find time to go and preach a game but I was getting a lot of money so it was not my bed and to remember to say I was supposed to I was told to go and preach right I'm making money but so now yeah to win souls but now I don't have time then I talked to him can I please weekend's go out you'd say yes but of course the the kind of work we were doing construction plus University I was managing kept me so busy that sometimes you travel 900 miles away from the capital city you go very far near the border you're working you're there for two weeks and I'm thinking I'm supposed to win souls I'm getting money but not I'm not attending church I'm not going to church I'm not preaching so I kept on asking him then I asked him so I decided to go this other weekend to try another rural area and I went to the second guy they told me no they are very very good people can just put people together so he put people together and we went he was translating to from English to the local language but some people they don't understand English they're old people so I'm taking too much no you're fine all right so we reached there I preached and after that we had deliverance and people demons would manifest we cast out people as sick when delivered I remember there was an old woman I once posted it on Facebook she was she had rheumatism she couldn't stand for she couldn't walk on her own for almost five years we went there there was deliverance treated up and that was a miracle in that area so we said we're gonna plant a church here and this brothers would be coming since they they really know these people next weekend we try to go to another village but still my boss would say no we need you this weekend so what I simply did we'll post him on Facebook and one of the sisters from Uganda I'd never met her she just sent me a message and say who we attached by the testimonies much she had a business proposal but at the same time she wanted me also to come to their church in Uganda in Kampala so what I simply did accepted to go then I asked my boss my boss said no what you gonna do gonna get you a ticket then I'm gonna preach but what he did because he didn't want me to go he was so scared so he studied like he was no longer paying me because he was scared that if I pay this brother he might not come back so he must not go there so what I simply did he kept on promising he was a sweet talker no you're gonna add no don't why are we gonna do it you're gonna do it you see just a matter of time so two months passed and I'm thinking we age I gotta go that side and he's no longer paying me so what I simply did I just taught this sister know I'm coming but there are some few commitments that I have this is the suspected that probably maybe he doesn't have the ticket so she asked me can I get you a ticket I said yeah sure if you can so she asked for my details I sent her she got me a ticket I told my boss I'm going he's like no no I said I'm going but I'm coming back I went to Uganda the first week was phenomenal testimonies we do some meetings I pre remember preaching Monday Wednesday friday-sunday tremendous people who had spiritual husbands in Africa we have a lot of those kind of things spiritual husbands we have people who some of the issues I can't discuss but they are quite sensitive people were delivered and the pastor was so touched he said I want this gifting to go to South Africa I have friends there but you're gonna get you a ticket to go to South Africa so I called my boss I'm not coming back now like please please I can't even increase the salary I said now I have to do my father's business my I flew to South Africa and tremendous things happened and start getting connections here and there people started calling each other and we had this have we had about this young man have we had how God has been doing tremendous stuff and that's how it started so I never went back then now we're in 2016 and I remember in 2016 God also started doing some tremendous blessings towards the end 2017 2018 2019 and God has been so faithful and I'm telling you the truth I've never suffered or never been never a beggar the Bible says I've never seen the righteous forsaken no begging for bread and land to suffer so God has been so good and we've been doing a lot of missionary work going out planting churches I work with a lot of Ministers you in Zambia and of course around the world just to make sure we win souls because we were waiting for that one one person remains to enter so basically since then and that's how we've been traveling and also I had about pastor Steve good testimonies tremendous testimonies and I wanted to meet him so I remember I think I traveled to India if I'm not mistaken and they told me he was in Kenya and I missed to go there so when Pastor they told me that you'll be coming for the convention and for the dedication in our during Easter convention this year I said God I really want to meet this man of God I just felt I'd never talked to him I'd never inboxed him on Facebook but I just prayed and when we went to Kenya my spirit just to Ghana I just loved him and his two sons we had a good time he was ministering so well and many many I remember there was a meeting when I was not feeling too well and pastor Sheila was preaching and he says our God can even heal you right now and there was a sweet spirit and immediately I was healed I've never shared with his gun I was going to do that so I just loved the man and up until when God opened doors for me to come to the United States I elected him on what's up and then he told me that you be very glad to receive me very very happy it was very good news for us amen and we're very glad to be a part of your first trip to the United States I'm really really humbled I pray it won't be the last Amen you know there was something in her testimony this time that stood out to me right and it reminded me of the prophet of the Old Testament right who was getting his refreshment from the broom right and he got quite comfortable there right and all of a sudden the brook ran dry rags because God wanted to move him to the next place that's true it's time for you to move on that's true and it sounded to me like the Lord using this employer of yours the Lord was kind of cutting off the string for a little bit soon as you would go back to what he had called you to do that's the time of your accident that's very very it's so important for those who are watching the program - yes to be obedient - to surrender to the call of God that's very true because it can be devastating to us if we if we keep fighting God's perfect will that's very true I'm glad that you have surrendered and now you're in the full-time ministry yes sir and so that is a different life it's a life by faith that's minutes you're living by faith and I appreciate the Lord for doing that and why don't you just take a verse of scripture you know we still have some time and why don't you just take a verse of scripture or something that's on your heart and just share it with those folks out there who are anxious to hear what the Lord would have to say to them today okay I'm going to share from Festus and Aliens five verse 17 the Bible says pray without ceasing so whatever situation that you have the scripture is telling us pray without ceasing right do not doubt the power of prayer amen when you pray God will change your situation yes the Bible says in 1st 2nd Corinthians 10 verse 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds some 60 1 verse 2 the Bible says from the end of the eighth I will cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to that rock that is higher than I that's a beautiful one that's a very beautiful one and that rock is Jesus Christ the proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run it into it and is a safe we are safe in God's hand no matter what's personal matter what's pursuing us can I read more yes please play okay all right Jeremiah 1 verse 5 before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained you so God knew us before we came I believe that and that's why we are here today and some 3 verse 3 but thou art all Lord at my shoe for my glory and the lifter of my head man I'll just read maybe two more to just encourage maybe one or two viewers right Philippians 4 verse 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made unto God prayer supplication and thanks thank you everything and let your requests be made known known unto God is that because he doesn't know what we need he knows everything he already know already knows everything why does he ask us to make it known why does he ask us to tell him about our need he wanted to be specific you want you to spirit it yes yeah so we are more than conquerors in all things the Bible it tells us that be strong and courageous yes you never leave you nor forsake you amen one of my favorite Isaiah 49 verse 15 it says can a mother forsake a suckling child no I will not forsake you that's what God is telling us today amen that he knows our needs he knows what we want and you never forsake us and be strong and be courageous just pray and God will change your situation absolutely absolutely what if somebody is watching today and maybe they've been raised around the church and they know a lot about Christianity maybe they've been disappointed in churches and and people you know sometimes folks come up with this excuse I've seen hypocrites and so forth so maybe there are people watching who who have never really invited the Lord they've never really surrendered to the Lord to even be a Christian they know so much but they they've experienced so little what would you say to someone who has not yet taken an opportunity to really invite the Lord into their life I want to say be strong encourages our God can do everything I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me him and myself I am a testimony and I've seen God working in my life in the ministry and in many people's lives don't be discouraged I know there are people who might have been discouraged I've tried this I've gotten there I've tried this but nothing is working in my life there is another chance here this morning what do never leave us nor forsake us try him and your life will never be the same that's why he's encouraging us say pray without ceasing Amen we can eat a lot we can run a lot but you can never pray enough that's true that's true that's absolutely the truth yes and and what about healing what do you what do you think about divine healing I mean in your ministry you've seen people healed yes what if someone's watching the program today and they've been really suffering with something for a long long time they prayed and prayed and and still there seems to be no answer what would you say to encourage that person you've already said be strong and courageous and don't quit praying and this is very good advice but what would you say to someone who says I really need a miracle if you need a miracle the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for right the evidence of things not seen now you can see the symptom symptoms every day exactly and you say I keep on getting this headache I keep on having this but just believe mint just say I am healed by His stripes I am healed one time there was a woman who had a goiter here and she kept on believing that I'm already healed I'm already healed and one time she was spreading her bed and she touched here she found the goiter had disappeared or a scar so never lose faith don't focus on these symptoms just believe that my healings day last thing there's a guy called John Ryan John Ryan was a blind man and he kept on saying I can see I can see I can see one time I was sitting in the barber shop and people were just saying this brother is crazy and they cut it they were trying to cut his hair guess what he his eyes just opened and he started running even the barber had to follow him you know with that big and so just keep confessing that touching that diabetes it's finished that depression was no longer my curse amen because our God that we serve his extra fat that God he can raise an 18-inch hammer to strike a B which is about to strike you Wow I think that's exactly right so your advice to us is when we have prayed and believed in our heart yes trusted in God's ability and power to heal us yes then we should begin to confess yes I am healed instead of Lord please heal me lord please heal me I am you know once we've asked right do you think it's important then that we just start giving praise to God for healing Lord I thank you for healing me that's it that's it because the moment you praise God in advance for what he's done I need to see a miracle in your life I like it prays in advance yes praise Him in advance God's worthy God's worthy and God has already done it amen that's why he says by His stripes we were huge finished not we are huge we were healed right by his stripes amen so it's past tense right so it's already done just believe keep on confessing and declaring that I'm healed and focus on something else and you really give a testimony you see a miracle in your life absolutely I believe that right we're getting a lot of people from across Europe who are watching the program watching the gospel Channel yes and many are noticing some oppression in their life some are even in these requests here some are saying that they can feel some battles and warfare going on you know sometimes we Christians can sort of present the Christian life as though everything is rosy yeah and it's not always that way there is a battle alright why is that is that because there's an enemy out there I guess who doesn't want us to surrender our life to the Lord so he he wants us to is that does that make any sense he started just gonna lay down and play dead while we take God at His Word so what would you say to someone who feels like that there is a real spiritual warfare going on in their life maybe the demonic is manifesting and some people feel like they're under maybe generational spirits and and and I hesitate to use the word curses but but we know it can be true that the enemy can move from generation to generation until someone says enough is enough what would you say to someone who feels like they're really fighting against another power darkness okay that's a very good one and the Bible says the enemy cometh to steal cue and destroy that's right but I come that you might have life long life abundance more abundantly and the Bible also says us to resist the devil and you flee arrested flee yes now the first verse that as I spoke about the enemy coming to steal your joy cue and destroy it was God he says I come that you might have life in abundance more right now what the devil tactics is to make you feel like you're to show you symptoms the devil wants you to to lack faith but just keep on believing that a modern Conqueror amen and once you believe that your life will never be the same again now there are cases where we have generational curses where you can trace probably let's talk of sugar diabetes you can find a generational maybe from your grand grand dad to your grand to your father and then it's a family chain it's a family pattern I remember one of the times I was preaching a message code refused to be a victim of circumstance sometimes you have to refuse to be a victim of what follows your family example to follow you oh yes you must refuse like in my family I have on the cousin sites they are drunkards and they take drugs but myself I refuse to be a victim of circumstance excellent I said myself I am a master of every circumstance because if you know who you are you don't live under privilege come on now that's right so I just want to encourage someone that be in generational cases be it any situation that's too difficult drug addicts whatever the case might be I'm telling you the moment you just refuse to be a victim of those things and resist the devil you flee away from you the more the more thinking because as a man thinketh in his heart so easy so the more we think to say no things are so difficult this is what happens in my family these spirits they choose themselves and jump and say you have accepted that is so true yeah the Bible says you're snared by the words of our mouth exactly so sometimes we we have more faith expect that we're going to yea have the same problems that are our fathers had we have more faith in that than we do in God's power to break that to break the cycle right I like the way you explain you use your pattern yes and sometimes that's what's the enemy he's just looking to take advantage of the next year that's very true that's very but we can say no more it's not yes here right here underneath the blood of Jesus yes even if those who are watching live you can get healed right now yes if you only believe absolutely yea let me take just a minute to share a few of these prayer requests because we're going to go off the air today by having you to pray not only for these needs but the needs of every person who is watching this program this weekend if it airs again the same God that can move for you today can move for you in the rerun of this program because he is ever more power and evermore the same does this is a caller who has reached out from the program she didn't leave her name but she gave her phone number she watches the program she is very encouraged by some of the faith messages here and she was recently at the doctor and received a diagnosis that she is not happy about in this note she doesn't mention the diagnosis which i think is very good she just said a recent diagnosis that I'm not happy with and I'm asking for faithful people to pray with me that I can be delivered so I like that she didn't put emphasis on what the disease was or the infirmity was and she just said I need people praying with me that's right Lillian has called from the United Kingdom and she has a granddaughter that at the end of the last school year was really being bullied and mistreated by classmates and the summer was okay but now that it's time to go back to school she's going through some anxiety and she she doesn't want to have to deal with those bullies that's a big problem in the world today right it certainly is and also we should remember that many of our young people are going back to a new school year and they need to be remembered some have testimonies that Jesus is Lord of their life and the enemy is certainly not going to be happy with that and I believe that God can use students with a light the light of Jesus to shine in in their classmates life and they can lead them I know when I was in school I was leading people to the Lord all the time I even led my teacher to the Lord I let my principle to the Lord and because we have something that everybody needs right it doesn't matter rich or poor or young or old they need Jesus don't say here is someone who has called hazel has called in and she's really under some pressure taking care of a husband who is not well and she needs to be remembered to the Lord and the enemies you know pressing her and lying to her and I want God to do something for hazel today Rosa Dean is calling because she's on some medication that has some terrible side effects and she needs some strength and from the Lord you know she's got some problems including weight gain and and it worries her and I know people will have a problem like that and sometimes the devil will say well that's your fault and you can't pray about that but right I believe God is concerned about everything that concerns us that's true and she just needs strength and I believe God can give her that and Rosabelle these two ladies here are their faithful callers because they believe in the power of God her son is not well he's still having some problems in his eye it looks like these two have been targeted it seems like picked out to be picked on and I'd like for the Lord to give them some freedom and Richard is called in from the northern part of the northeastern part of the United Kingdom and his mom has passed away many years ago he was kind of transferred into that area and there's some depression and some panic attacks he mentions a sister who is fighting with her health a brother a blood brother who's fighting with his health and he's called in all the way from that part of the UK and Irene from Scotland praise the Lord here is someone calling us from Scotland who's fighting an attack it sounds demonic and you know sometimes people are in churches that don't understand that's true they don't understand so they look at people like they're just crazy but I want you to know the kingdom of light is the most powerful Kingdom that's but there is a kingdom of darkness that's true and the enemy can do a lot of things to to attack people because here is someone who has a torn meniscus in their knee that can be very painful and they're not able to get around so there's a lot of sadness and depression that's coming and they just go on and on God sees every one of these here is someone by the name of Creed II who has a son and a daughter away from God a 28 year old and a 22 year old okay you can understand that because you're in-between those ages there right and they're in bad relationship this particular woman has been estranged from her family and she would like to see so she's repented and she's tried to make that okay but she'd really like for the Lord to give her some grace in that area Celia is asking for prayer for her self and her young sons she's a single mother in the United Kingdom raising those children I was raised by single parent my parents were divorced brother Caleb when I was five years old and my mother raised me alone and it wasn't easy so my heart goes out to Celia I believe the Lord's heart goes out to her amen and here's one more this is an arene II who is calling from London and God has moved for her before she knows in the power of God she believes in it and she knows what the power of prayer can accomplish and she's reaching out and it goes on look here some of them are turned in different directions because I spread them out before the Lord when I pray God sees it these aren't these are lives these aren't names on a paper right these needs are legitimate and God sees these needs that's what blesses me he cares about them that's very I'm a pastor of a little congregation here in Alabama and I'm concerned about my sheep but the Lord has given us a bigger outreach right and he has opened these doors for us so these are I feel like these are some of my sheep too and I want God to move for them that's would you just speak some more just a little more faith and then lead us in prayer we've got about nine minutes left just speak a little more faith over these since I've told you some of these needs and then lead us in prayer thank you so much we've had the prayer requests I know there's some requests that are not returned right but God knows what's in your heart this is common to me all that I have in Laden and I'll give you rest so God wants us to have rest and that rests is the Holy Spirit you want us to set to sit God does not want to see his children sick no God does not want his children crying depressed the devil jumping up and down in their lives no God wants to see his children happy amen and like I always say that once we why we are still here on earth we are not going to heaven by running away from depression from sickness heaven is not a refugee camp for cowards it's a less the oven for egos ylist we are here on earth we must overcome we must cause dust to the face of the devil before we go to heaven a man and all this sickness all these infirmities our God is the healer he is the greatest doctor ever that I've ever met it's true his name is dr. Jesus a man never lost a case right he died for us on Calvary and all by His stripes we owe this and from you we worry hugely so I just want to encourage you who are watching that all this request there are some who have probably not be able to send some requests I want to guarantee you that our God he doesn't he knows no distance he can touch you wherever you are by the power of the spoken word so and the power that we are going to speak right now I believe that you are going to be changed and you're going to be here completely already thank God in advance and I know that things would get and you give a testimony that will shock your life and excite you at the same time amen so I'm going to enter into prayer and just raise your faith wherever you are just believe all things are possible amen so we are going to put our hands on these papers as point of contact and wherever you are watching just believe our God is able to heal us yes let us pray our Heavenly Father we thank you for this wonderful time that we have had Almighty God share the testimonies of God Father we have been encouraged by your words or God by word father we thank you for this time we know that people

of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen any man I don't know if you can feel where you are what I'm feeling but just an atmosphere of faith has just covered us here in this studio right and I pray that it can be transferred to you that you can feel that atmosphere of faith because in that atmosphere everything is possible amen and we don't always feel that it's not about feeling it's about faith but in it wonderful when we when we just know that we know that God is answering prayer and I know that right now and some of your needs are being answered right now right and so why don't you just lift your hand up where you are and just go ahead like our testimony we heard yes praise God in advance lord I thank you that I'm healed yes I thank you that I'm deliverer thank you that you have

can feel free to contact us we keep these requests we don't destroy them we keep them because we want a point of contact it's not necessary but but it's so helpful to me to have something to lay my hands on and and believe sometimes I beat on them lord I thank you that the work is done and it is done today when you're praying pray for the gospel channel that God will continue to bless our brother Eric Erickson and expand his ministry and most of the time there are needs because television especially by satellite across the world is very very expensive and maybe you know there's not a lot of flashy techniques to raise funds and to get people to partner so I want you to help us pray that God will sustain the ministry of our brother and the staff and just continue to send it out into the airwaves because there are still lives that need to be touched with the gospel if you feel impressed today to partner with this network you know how to reach out to them and they would be happy to hear from you we're just partners in the work of the King one of these days brother Caleb it's gonna be over and God's gonna take his little bride out of this world but until then you said we've got to kick up some dust in the rebel space yes sir I like that I like that disturb the devil yes yes the devil always disturbing us that's right thank you for being with us thank you so much I really appreciate may God bless you thank you so much brother and may God continue to bless your ministry and send you to the nations of the world thank you and thank you for being with us today and tune in
