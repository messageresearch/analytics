the voice of Triumph Hallelujah Hallelujah He reigns He reigns you can make your way back to your seats He reigns forevermore he is alive you may be seated he is alive he is well he is worthy to be praised amenok amen as the sun goes down this evening we once again remember the time of Sukkot The Time Of Tabernacles it's one of the feasts that the Bible says will be perpetually celebrated before the Lord that means when you stand with him in the New Kingdom you will still remember the time of in gathering you will still celebrate it is the Feast of rest it is the Feast of Joy it is the Feast of the open book we have a lot to be thankful for how many of you are glad the book is open the seals are loosed and we have a revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ and so we look forward to it the prophet told us that it types a great Millennial Reign where we dwell with him and we look forward to that but we look forward to the days and months ahead as we prepare to receive our King amen he's doing great things I want to say it again see if you'll help me he's doing great oh my what a wonderful weakness has been and I am very much aware that many of you are fighting symptoms and sickness in your body my wife is unable to swallow hardly just just barely swallow this morning and uh Joshua as well and we just know like you know when you get attacked we know that the enemy's mad you know and and in some ways it makes us glad when the enemy's mad it's like my old granny said and I mentioned to someone in my office this week granny used to say well if uh if the devil's after you that's a good thing it means he hadn't got you if he leaves you alone if the devil leaves you alone you better worry that means he's running you around that means he's got the reins that means you've given him a saddle to ride your back how many of you want to remove all saddles so that the enemy has no place to ride you want to be rather the horse that the king rides in on we want to bring the king in amen so officially according to the calendar camp meeting starts Tuesday night but how many of you feel like it's starting this morning we're just claiming that we're here we have come to the season of our joy and we believe that God is going to move I want to begin this morning and get this out of the way because I want to say to you from the bottom of my heart how incredibly sorry I am for those of you who were here Wednesday night helping us and who received chemical burns on your knees I want to tell you that I am so sorry and I have carried it very heavy this week and I have felt like I wasn't a very good leader because if I was then maybe I would have realized but I didn't realize and neither did those who were gathered around that night to help and I want to tell you from the bottom of my heart I would have never had you to have those sores or burns on your knees and some were really bad some who already had allergies to those kinds of chemicals and cleaning um really bad and Ariel ended up at the Amer emergency room and I'm so very sorry honey I want you to know that from the bottom of my heart it really really hurt me that you all were here doing something for the Lord and you got injured doing it and that's why when we went to put the tent up yesterday I just prayed Lord make let there be no harm done let there be no emergencies let there be no accidents but let everything be done all of that being said I don't know how to thank you enough because that 30 if it was built in 85 I confirmed that if it was built in 85 that makes it what 30 37 year old tent I had that tent built 37 years ago and finally the the man who built it for me texted me last night answered my inbox and he said anything that you can use to stick it together with that'll that ought to work he's almost 90. he said just stick it I said we got it handled Luke wise on the job and uh he was I don't know brother Greeley will talk about that when it's his turn but uh the patching and the cleaning you you folks made a 37 year old tent look brand new I almost smacked a little kid that come up under there yesterday and said it sure is dirty under here I'm kidding I'm kidding I wasn't even tempted to hurt anybody but it was because there were leaves from the wet grass that were stuck up there and they're stains folks some of you that's got shirts you've had for 40 years you know that things just get stained and when we can't make it brand new again but oh what a blessing and it went up and anyway I'm I'm kind of stealing Thunder and I don't want to do that because these brothers have worked so hard Nathan built brand new stobs for the front and we're just amazed at finding so many of the of the axles and the side wall poles and other Greeley painted them up bread the center poles and it was just a wonderful feeling and I I'm sorry that the enemy just you know stirred itself here on Wednesday night I pray that most of your that got into that or recovering well today and then yesterday morning I was here I got here about 10 after nine and there was already a crowd here picking on me for being late and it was just amazing how it went up it I've I've been where that tent was put up many times I wouldn't I wouldn't feel that I was exaggerating to say 300 times and I thought about it last night and I would have to say it's been that many and don't know that I've ever seen it go up as good and when brother Greeley mentioned here Tuesday night that we needed strong men everybody was strong and everybody that was weak and and sisters too and brothers too and I was thinking to myself well we probably don't need all those sisters here but but you know we did they held the wall poles and they laced together and they grunted and groaned and got it done and and it felt good you know sometimes people say uh well we don't get enough fellowship at New Hope well I want you to know that you're the minority because the rest of us get about all the fellowship with one another we can take it's a choice people who say that don't stay for picnics and they don't come to work days and they don't make the effort to be here when the body is gathered together outside of a service so you miss you miss it's on you how beautiful how wonderful it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity and when you're working side by side with the kingdom with the with the members of the kingdom of God there's a feeling there's just a feeling of peace and and the presence of the Lord was here and we're just so thankful and we want to say to the seniors that Nathan went last night for us and we had more needed more tables and we bought some more comfortable chairs and we we only bought 16 and what did we how much did they end up being a piece Nathan the chairs are about 25 a piece plus tax and the church is going to take care of those 16 chairs and the four tables but I just had said to brother Greeley last Sunday I'm gonna I want to buy at least one table full of those more comfortable chairs for the seniors and I said I think when everybody sees them and sits in them and and sees how much better they look I don't think we'll have any trouble replacing them all may take a while but I don't think we'll have any trouble so we won't do it tonight today but we might just have a chair auction in here and somebody said well if they buy one they can put their name on I said no they can we don't want their name on the chair because if we do they'll be digging through the pile to find their chair but uh if you will leave those white bottom chairs for the seniors at the picnic today and let them know how much we love them and appreciate them and eventually we'll get you one it'll all work out but just there's just no way to talk about all the things a need comes up and somebody says I'll be right back and they run off to buy what's needed you know nobody come around and said do we have the money can can you write me a check can you everybody just says let's get it done we worry about all that later how many of you know that's what family does so I want to commend every one of you I felt bad that you were worn out and Scattered in the evening when brother and sister minkos moving van got here and I don't know that they had very much help at all but I appreciate those of you who are able did you make it all right and we want to thank God that they have we don't want to say moved in because you know that means boxes unpacked and everything's neat we want to say unloaded right I I'm just sure there's plenty to do but let's thank God that they have were able to get in their place and unloaded let's give God thanks for that [Applause] we want to go to the Lord in prayer and again I want you to remember my wife it's very unusual for her not to be here and and it's hard for me I'm I I really uh it makes a difference for me so would you ask the Lord to raise her up mightily today and strengthen her and Joshua also sister Beverly is finding something very similar I saw where sister Tiffany is also fighting and we want to remember them to the Lord and there's probably even I won't ask who needs a touch from God today because if I do you'll raise your hand and somebody will shun you say well I don't want to get too close to them they raise their hand they were sick so I'm not I'm not going to do that but I'm just going to say may the Lord touch you today and heal you today and protect us let me ask you a very practical question uh uh who has been taking extra vitamin C let me see your hand all right wonderful how about some extra vitamin D let me see your head all right the rest of you are just depending on prayer there's nothing wrong with that but you know the Lord gives us some common sense he really does and you would be surprised I just finished some more research on vitamin C and what it does for the body and how it fights cancer and how it lowers uric acid in the bloodstream and how many how many different in infirmities and sicknesses are connected to uric acid I didn't know there were so many it's something I've struggled with in my body and I didn't know that there are so many things including heart disease and lung disease and and so many other things that can be controlled by controlling uric acid and vitamin C is a powerful thing nothing is more powerful than prayer but a little precaution along the way when you're entering into meetings like this would be wise and it would be smart and you'd be glad because you don't want to miss one service come on now you don't want to miss one because this is the one time a week that we are gathered together like this fully concentrated to get What the Lord Has for us Sister Evelyn Fox reached out and asked for some extra prayer for her traveling down here tomorrow and many others are traveling sister Rebecca has 15 members of her family making their way for the camp meeting this week and we won't ever coming from different places we want every one of them to be remembered those who are flying and and we want to see the place full not so we can brag about a full house but so that every person can be encountered by a living God have a touch in their life sister Sharon's friend Paula is heading south for surgery on a growth on her thyroid and we want to hold her up to the Lord in prayer brother Billy has had some uh uh really Health difficulties lately and we want to hold him up to the Lord and his uncle Richard brother Tebow's brother-in-law a fell off of a ladder and and is in ICU and he broke several bones and really was in pretty serious shape and we want to hold him up to the Lord in prayer all of those who are not here today we want to lift them up if you have a need on your heart would you just hold up your hand across this building you know God sees that we're not dismissing that as non-important because we didn't take time for you to call it out God sees that and we want to see the Lord move on your behalf for the thing that you are concerned about if it concerns you you can rest assured it concerns him I believe that I believe that the smallest thing that's why when someone says would you pray for my pet it doesn't bother me one bit to pray for somebody's animal because if they care about it I know God does whatever you care about he cares about and I want us to stand today and I want us to go to the Lord in prayer and I want us to believe that God is going to help these needs minister to them that he's going to anoint brother Greeley today and use him in a mighty way to build this body up I came in a little lighter today than I normally come in on a Sunday they're still burdens there's still things to be concerned about and things to get done but I came in and walked down the hall a little lighter and I heard somebody say what's going on with Pastor he seems a little lighter today a little happier today yes I'm not preaching I took 15 minutes to drink my coffee it's rest just enjoying myself look took a little extra time on my beard and cleaned it up a little because I I didn't have the responsibility of the word today but I I was praying for the one who does may God use him I feel the Lord right now may God use him in a profound way to speak to our hearts may this be the the greatest camp meeting time that we have ever had together we have we've raised the tent for fellowship and for food because we're going to be serving food after every service beginning Wednesday night and um we're doing that to be a blessing to those who travel and to give you an opportunity to have fellowship with them and so many have been cooking already and buying already and preparing already there's so much to be done but we don't want to be so busy that we miss our blessing and that we miss our opportunity to serve when we come in here what a blessed week we're entering into right now and we want to give God all the glory we want to believe that the word will come forth every night to accomplish exactly what God has sent it to accomplish that there will be deliverances take place this week and lives baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire and healing Miracles take place Among Us may this be the week that creative Miracles begin in the house why not believe God it's coming it's coming so why not believe now amen so we want to pray for the musicians and uh preachers and those who serve in the audio and video and and singing and because they're going to need strength and anointing and physical healing and help from the Lord we want to lift every one of them up amen let's just go straight to God right now father we come to you in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you that you are a Great and Mighty and that your power is so strong even among us today we sense your presence and as we sung and celebrated who you are it lifts us up out of our problems out of our circumstances out of our own symptoms and aches and pains and how we thank you today that you've allowed us these moments in your presence Lord we're not finished engaging with you we want your word to come today and speak to our hearts and challenge us to move up to a higher realm in you we want you to use our brother today from the Oracles of God with a call from off your altar that he would speak directly to us and we would have faith and courage to receive your word and to act upon it as quickly as possible I pray Lord for those who bring their stuff into the house of God today I pray that it will not hinder them from hearing the word I pray that it will not hinder them from their healing from their help from their Deliverance may they find Grace to lay the stuff down and allow you to be God in their lives and allow you to bind us together in this place with no ISM and no Schism but we become one under the anointing of the Holy Ghost may we press in with everything that we we possess until we touch and tap your unlimited resources on our behalf and we will give you the praise and the honor and the glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen sing that with me again you are great before we are seated in just a moment sing a little more [Music] because there is [Music] no [Music] singing [Music] like you [Music] again I want you to [Music] our you do [Music] miracles there is [Music] for you are great [Music] praise God how many of you glad you serve a miracle working God amen you may be seated again [Music] it's wonderful to see you in the house of the Lord it's wonderful to see Jonathan you go what 20 years it seems like and you don't see the him and then now we've been blessed to have him with just a few weeks between visits and he's here for the week so we feel very happy all the way from Indiana we feel good about that we just don't hardly know what to think about having brother Daniel and sister Anna two services in a row with hundreds of miles in between we're so glad that God has brought them back in Sister West you know what it means to us to see you come in we feel very very blessed today let's love her and thank God for her miss Ann we're glad to see her today she has missed a few times but we're so glad that you're here yes very very glad [Applause] did I miss somebody well we're glad for you to be here whoever you are all of you you that are streaming this service we are so glad and now that I've rattled on so much you know why they don't usually call on me to lead a service that's why uh you know tomorrow is a a big birthday day uh sister Weems is having her birthday tomorrow and we want to say happy birthday to you we love you very much [Applause] and there's a yovich having a birthday tomorrow Miss Lily where is she there she is happy birthday to Miss Lily [Applause] Mr Anita had her and I saw where tomorrow would be how many years was it 50 57 years would have been uh the 57th anniversary for brother and sister Tebow and uh well we could we could have a celebration here but how could it begin to compare with the celebration they're having over there I wonder if she's still saying bill bill or he's probably still saying that's Rose I believe they're at peace in the presence of the Lord and we sure miss him here and then Thursday of this week it's like some kind of jackpot of birthdays it's like several all at one time Elizabeth Ellsworth has a birthday on Thursday oh and Kendra wants to make sure we know it's 31. your friend great friend what does that matter I literally have tents older than that probably have socks too if the truth were told and Rebecca radiant hoxson has a birthday hold up your hands so everybody can see her how old are you going to be not 31. how many how many 10 years old happy birthday to Rebecca we love you I could say I could say uh Elita Elita but no one would know who that was they think it was Mimi so I won't say that I'll say more rains she's having a birthday also on Thursday we want to say happy birthday to her we love her and brother Steve is not here today but his birthday is on Thursday so the next time you see him I hope he'll be soon be sure to say happy birthday to him how many all on one day like that that's really something isn't it let's give our tithe and offering to the Lord do you believe he deserves what's his I believe he deserves what's his and I believe he deserves a part of what is ours that's the tithe in the offering when we give God our tithe we're not giving him anything but what already belongs to him how do you say that preacher because the Bible said the tithes is it belongs to him we're only stewarding what already belongs to God and we are a blessed church because this is a giving church and we are so thankful for those of you who are so faithful in your giving we give offering because we want to thank him first one thing and then another How He blesses us all along the way and someone came and gave me a wonderful testimony this week where there were this morning actually where there were needs and things were tied and they made a decision to sow a hundred dollars into the into the insurance offering last weekend and all of a sudden six hundred dollars appears in the bank account you know that's God that's just how it works and and I said to him that's a very good sign because when those things begin happening in the body so that you can actually put your finger on where the increase why the increase has come that's a sign that it's about to break out that's a first fruit I've watched that happen so many times and that one testimony will become a dozen testimonies because that's how God works I had another one just remembered looking around had another one this week uh sister Kathy where she had the same kind of thing God ministered and worked a miracle for her she sowed a little more and trying to trying to figure out how to make it work and just gave it and God poured that right back into her it just works that way I I I just have watched it too many times so may God bless you for your giving today I believe he has already and I believe he will let's have Josiah and Elias to come they're standing here why don't you go around I was going to have the people come but why don't you go around to them and serve them let's give us unto the Lord God bless you as you give today I was standing on a mountain looking toward s the sky when I saw a storm approaching and I fear that I would die oh I saw God's creatures [Music] a better place to hide heard the Thunder Rolls down in my soul then I bow my head and cry [Music] now now they were moved [Music] right the clouds so dark they hid the light of the Sun and it seemed that it was not when all once there was [Music] above the storm you should have heard me sing God [Music] knows let him do that for you this morning [Music] you work for him you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials [Music] all at once his Spirit lifted me I was high above it all I'd never even had to move wings the Holy Spirit he had control Hallelujah I was sorry high above all my circumstances my confusion and though I had spent many years in that old denominational Barnyard I was always an eagle by his name spread your wings so spread your wish [Music] you were not born to live down in a depressed Valley no you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials or drive your spirit to the ground up with wings [Music] made this feel weak little eagle [Music] called spread he always [Music] every Destiny to soar through

helped this week in getting the tent cleaned and getting it up and I too am very sorry for those that suffered from the chemical burns been praying that God would just minister to you and give you a quick recovery from that uh I want to say thank you to all of you who are so quick to change your plans when I stood here on Tuesday night and said seven o'clock and then charity comes and said Dad it'll be nearly dark and she says I think we need to back it up to five o'clock well I'm not a part of that group text and she immediately sent it out and you responded and I'm so grateful and I thank you for your effort to help to get that tent clean and then yesterday to be here at nine o'clock to help us to get the 10 up would you bring these lights down I would just like to show this time lapse video that charity got of the tent going up because it was um it was it was amazing how quickly it went up the main body of the tin is in three pieces and it has to be laced together and the outside poles put in place then the center poles man that looks so fast foreign that's a repeat all right [Applause] wait just a minute wait just a minute now as we were lacing this tent brother Shelley told us that he had recently watched a video that after the tent is put up that they send somebody up on top of the tent to lace or to to put the flaps over the laces well we did it while it was on the ground but give you this other picture Somebody went up on top of that tent that is Luke yovich and I want to say thank you to Luke yovich who ordered the material to repair that tent the holes and took care of getting it repaired on Thursday night but we found more holes yesterday and yesterday afternoon he spent fixing those holes and so I want to thank Luke well it is not but I just thought it was kind of comical after brother Shelley said that they send somebody up there I what a thought nobody's gonna get on top of that tent but Luke yovich did look [Applause] so we appreciate everything that you are doing to make this camp meeting possible to see that it is um the best that we've ever had that is what we're expecting there is an expectation that is in the air that I don't know whether you've been feeling it or not but I have if you'll stand with us today I'm going to try to control myself as best I can if I let go you not go hear me preach hahaha there was a spirit of intercession that came last night while I was by myself any of you that ever done an ab workout that's what it felt like there was something powerful there's something that is moving in the spirit now I want to tell this local congregation I'm going to preach to you today you that are watching on the stream you're welcome to partake in any way that you can but I want this local body don't miss your visitation this week don't become so involved in all of the stuff that we must do to serve that you miss your visitation when you come in here leave all of that outside and enter into the things of God and let's get everything that we can I want to start in Leviticus chapter 20. 3 Leviticus chapter 23 brother Shelley already said that the Feast of Tabernacle starts this evening at sundown that's where I'd like to start in the scripture Leviticus chapter 23. I am thank you sorry so sorry Leviticus chapter 23 starting in verse 20 in verse 33. and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel saying the 15th day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord on the first day shall be and holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord on the Eighth Day shall be in holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein these are the feasts of the Lord which you shall Proclaim to be holy convocations to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering and a meat offering a sacrifice and a drink offering everything upon his day besides the sabbaths of the Lord and beside your gifts and besides all your vows and besides all your free will offerings which you shall give unto the Lord also in the 15th day of the seventh month when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast under the Lord Seven Days on the first day shall be a Sabbath and on the Eighth Day shall be a Sabbath and you shall take you on the first day the bowels of goodly trees branches of palm trees and the bowels of thick trees and Willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days and you shall keep it a feast under the Lord seven days in the year it shall be a statute forever in your Generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month you shall dwell in booths seven days all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths that your Generations may know that I made the that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt I am the Lord your God and Moses is declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord let us pray before you're seated Our Father how grateful we are to be gathered in your presence today with fellow believers who are pressing in to all that you have for us oh God and we are we are just yielding ourselves everyone under your Mighty hand to for you to do in and through us what you desire to do now Lord we've gathered today on this first day of the week at the beginning of the Feast of Tabernacles but oh God we are making preparations continually for what you are doing what you are unfolding this week God we believe that you're already unfolding things and we honor you for that and so we are just here to absorb what you desire to do in our lives get honor and Glory Lord I pray that you will rest our pastor and that you will rejuvenate him and that you will pour energy and strengthen to him for the days ahead Lord and we're decreeing it over his entire family and over this body oh God that you will just pour into US Supernatural energy God that we can be all you've called us to be and it's in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord you may be seated today for the past several weeks the Lord has been uh just speaking to me those two words that we read there in Leviticus chapter 23 the words holy convocation that this was not just going to be a uh just a typical camp meeting where we would gather and rejoice but there was something sacred about it something holy something set aside something extraordinary that he was going to do in our midst that we were not to take it lightly that we were not to come as a haphazard and something thrown together but that we were to make preparation for it because God was going to meet us he's going to speak to us and then as my mind began to think about the Holy convocation about a meeting where God just shows up and he he does Supernatural things was because so many times as human beings we get in to a place where that we become uh just accustomed with one another and with our surroundings and with these pews that we sit in we become accustomed to sitting in the same place we become accustomed to parking in the same spot we become accustomed to singing the same songs wearing the same clothes doing the same things and leaving the same way but God is calling us to a holy to a set aside to a convocation a real meeting with him one that is separate from all of the other times one that is different from the other times and God is already working setting things in motion speaking to people drawing people causing people to fast to pray to set themselves aside because they feel it on the inside something is different something is moving something is happening and so this this holy convocation that God set aside for the children of Israel it was uh the first day was the Sabbath the last day of Sabbath but it was to be a time of rejoicing a time of rejoicing in the Lord for the goodness that he had showed to the children of Israel all of their days that he did not make them to remain in booths but he well he gave them a home eventually in a Promised Land but every year they were to go and to dwell in these booths to remember that they had dwelt that way once upon a time then my mind began to think about the Tabernacle in the wilderness and how that God gave instruction to Moses and Moses went on the mountain to hear what God had to say about this Tabernacle because the Tabernacle was not a permanent Dwelling Place it was a place where that it could be picked up and moved just the same as the people's tents that they were dwelling in with their families it could be picked up and moved but something Supernatural happened inside of that movable Tabernacle the because the children of Israel were murmuring and they were complaining and then they were trying to decide Who's Who and God said I want every man to take a rod and I want them to bring it to the door of the congregation this is number 17. I want them to bring it to the door of the congregation each tribe is to bring their rod out of the head of that tribe and bring it along with Aaron in his tribe and I want you to put them in the holy of holies I want you to put them in that place where I am going to meet with you it is in that place where God promised Moses I'm going to meet with you and so as Moses takes these sticks they're just dry sticks dry nothing uh parent about them nothing any more special in one man's stick than the other man's stick it was just a the the staff that these men carried and they were dry there did not seem to be any life in them it just stood to reason because they those sticks had been disconnected from their life source they had been disconnected from their life Source when they were taken into the holy of holies and left overnight something Supernatural happened not to all of them but only one of them that Rod was the rod of Aaron and is said that not only did that Rod bud but it bloomed and it brought forth almonds the supernatural power of the Living God God in that rod and when it was in that presence there's something Supernatural happened because God had put his hand upon the tribe of Levi that they were supposed to serve in the Tabernacle why was that tribe supposed to serve in the Tabernacle if you go back in the scripture you can see all the way back to the night when God was bringing them out of Egypt it was to be God said I want you to sanctify the firstborn that was God's original choice according to the scripture the firstborn but when they came when God Sanctified them and the blood was put over the door and if it was not put over the door of down the lentil and the doorpost that firstborn of that house any of them that would been there would have died but because the blood the token was applied because the token was put on the lentil and the doorpost there was something that happened that night that was Supernatural it was above the natural and so when when the death angel passed over and he first born that was under the blood was spared their lives were spared that was God's choice but when they came out of Egypt and they went over across the Red Sea and they got out in the wilderness and they began to murmur and complain and they began to uh just a Wonder where's God's man what's going on he brought us out here to die we've got to have a leader what's going on we've got to have somebody Aaron why don't you lead us okay Aaron he began to listen to the people and as he's listening to the people they're wanting a God to serve not realizing that the man that has been chosen to lead them is in the mountain talking to the Living God and they're down here playing around in the valley wanting somebody to lead them and wanting a God that they can follow Now by Aaron when Moses came off the mountain Moses was angry and he had every right to be and Aaron looks at him and says they brought all their jewelry and I threw it in the fire and this is what come out down we say dumb things when we're under the when we're under the microscope we say some dumb things but Aaron Aaron told him said now Moses now look the people wanted something to follow they brought all their earrings they brought all their gold and we just threw it in the fire and this God come out and here we are we're just circling around and we and Moses said who is on the Lord's Side who is on the Lord's Side let him come unto me and it wasn't all of the firstborn that came to him the Bible said it was the Levites that came to him and so now we have when the The Stick of the of the House of Levi the rod of the House of Levi the priesthood now this Rod has been taken with all of the other dead sticks in behind the holy of holies [Music] something going on now and God does something in that rod and we get Buds and Blossoms and uh almonds now and God said I have chosen the tribe of Levi and God I'm only telling you all of this because God said I will meet you in there I will meet you in there friends there's something Supernatural something incredibly Supernatural I have been I have been pondering the lights of God for quite some time because we talk about don't let the light go out and I Ponder I Ponder how is it that this seven Branch Candlestick can never go out because the Wicks have to be trimmed and oil has to be added and I'm telling you it's not the right light it's the Shekinah in the holy of holies the light of God that never goes out that's the light that we're looking for we're looking for light to be so evident inside of us that it never goes out we have our ups we have our downs we have our sunny days and we have our cloudy days and we have to keep the weeks trimmed and be refilled with oil but oh if we could ever get inside of the holy of holies and be so endued with power from on high the Shekinah the light of God that will forever change us we have talked for years around here about the difference between the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the refillings and the final seal of God something that cannot be taken away something that cannot diminish because it is what God has placed his seal Upon Us in such a magnitude that nothing no circumstance of life no circumstance that we Face could ever cause it to me to diminish anymore we have UPS we have downs but the power of God is coming into us more and more and more and more because he wants us to be so steady so uh solid and and on the rock of the Revelation that has been given to us that we cannot be moved off of it we can see people that have said I have a revelation I have a revelation of who Jesus is and there have been things that have come along and caused them to be knocked on knocked away and I don't know what the end result will be only God does but I have seen people be knocked to the left and I've seen people be knocked to the right and there's more shaking that's coming I'm quite sure of it because we're still here there's more shaking that's coming and I want to be so solid and so steady in the word of God that if this one falls off and that one falls off Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell will never Prevail against it that's the rock I want to be anchored to rock that we need to be building upon so this Tabernacle in the wilderness that God has caused his people to erect and now the this uh this Dr dead dry stick has blossomed and God has told Moses I'm going to meet you in there I don't even begin to understand the calling in Moses and the leadership skills that it must have taken to lead all that people now you can you can say that it was all Supernatural but I really believe that some of his training in Egypt the natural training gave him an edge what he learned in Egypt gave him an edge but God had to take him to the back side of the desert to knock all of the pride of Egypt out of him so that it could bring him and he he poured himself into Moses and then he came back to lead the children of Israel out and Moses if he would have tried to lead the children of Israel at the end of his 40 years his first 40 years he would have ended up doing to the people as he did before he fled Egypt he would have become angry and he would have said away with you right I am not going to deal with you but God chose to take him to the back side of the desert to take him into a place he didn't really know anything about and to put in him something that was so above the ordinary because it was going to take that Supernatural element inside of him in order to overcome all of the things that were going to come at him now that is not just for a leader that is for the Bride of Jesus Christ at large all of that desert that you have felt like that you have wandered through and you felt like you had no friends and you felt like you were depressed and you were anxious and you were angry and you were all of this stuff and God just continued bringing his word to you and letting you go through low times and valleys and deserts friends it's because he's trying to instill something Supernatural in you because you're never going to conquer this world you're never going to be the complete Overcomer that God called you to be just operating in the natural realm because there are more people in this world that have tenacity and self-will more than some of us have who would would with with grit would overcome many many things but when it comes up to Pentecost when it comes up to a real experience with the Lord Jesus Christ they would be like Judas and say I've come all I'm going to come I'm through but there's something inside of you and there's something inside of me that predestinated seed of God that just continues hungering and thirsting and hungering and thirsting for more of God and God just keeps pouring it out yes preacher but I still have I still have anxieties and I still have low days and high days oh yes we do we're still walking in humanity but there's something inside of us that keeps saying press on press on press on press on press on keep moving keep moving and then through another why should I keep moving everybody else seems to be quitting let them quit let them quit there's something on the inside of me and I know it's on the inside of most of you and by the end of this week I'm expecting it to be throughout this whole congregation in such a move of God until that we are lifted up we are raised up into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus higher than we've ever experienced before now friends I want you to know I am not here to Hype you up today I am not here to Hype you in fact if I could have some kind of a a trip meter here something to stop the hype I would do I would set it because many times people get hyped up for something and then they get disappointed because they got hyper rather than expectant they got hyper and I don't want us to get hyper I want us to have such an expectation of the Living God until that every service we come in we've already left outside our anxieties and our fears and our anger and our rage and our disappointments with one another we just leave it all outside and come into the house of the Lord and say Lord ah I've dealt with all of that stuff today maybe I don't understand no we got to work our jobs before we come to the meeting and we're going to deal with stuff but we want to leave it aside you say preacher I don't know how to leave it aside how do I how do I leave aside this stuff that's going around in my head and it and it's just consuming me how do I do it the simplest way that I know to tell you is to walk through the door saying Lord I'm yielding myself to you I give myself to you today any of those words that I've just mentioned any of those things that may be going through your head Lord I'm laying them aside for the moment because it's my determination to press into God to see what he has for me because I am not going to miss my visitation from the Living God I am not going to miss my opportunity it even came to my mind you mamas that get so involved in taking care of your babies sometimes you're just gonna have to hand them off to somebody else new musicians that might feel so connected to your instrument you may have to just step out and we may have to sing without music we may just have to we may just have to sing acapella for a while because God wants to do something for every one of us every one of us and we can just bring the babies right into the presence of the Lord right I will meet you there there's something Supernatural that happens in that place behind that curtain those of you that have been here for some time that little room that little room where it's just you and Jesus you say this is a great big groom how can it be me and Jesus this is Tabernacles my friend this is the time where that you can have people in front of you in back of you beside of you and still by the grace of God you can create a tabernacle around you you can create a little cocoon around you in such a way till that everybody else just Fades into peripheral everybody else Fades out of your view and you just allow the Holy Spirit to do what he wants to in you Ezekiel chapter 47 verse 1. afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold Waters issued out from under the threshold of the house Eastward for the Forefront of the house stood toward the East and the waters came down from under the right from under the right side of the house at the south side of the altar then he brought me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh Eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and he brought me through the waters were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me son of man have you seen this that he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when I had returned behold at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other then he said unto me the waters issue out toward the East Country and go down to the desert and go into the sea which bring being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth withersoever the river shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these Waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and everything shall live wither the river cometh and it shall come to pass that the Fishers shall stand upon it from and Getty even to an eglium they shall be a place to spread forth Nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many but the Mirey places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given to salt and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow up trees for meat whose leaves shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their Waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf thereof for medicine revelation 22 verses 1 and 2 he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clearest Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on the either side of the river was there a tree of life the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations I wanted to read that into the record because I want you to again see that this pure River of Water of Life ushers forth from the Throne of God and when Moses brought the tabernacle into the earth when he brought it into the Earth it was because he saw the pattern of it when he was in the mountain he had already been up on the mountain to talk to the Lord and the Lord was talking to him and he's taken in all of this that he was supposed to bring down into the Earth and in how his mind I I don't know did he draw it out did he have did he put it on the stone like he did The Ten Commandments I don't know but he brought it down to bezelil and bezeliel was God's chosen instrument to be able to understand Moses to be able to put together a work team to be able to construct the Tabernacle according to what Moses had seen in the mountain that he had pulled down from heaven and in the holy of holies God instructed them to put the Ark of the Covenant where those Cherry Beam with the wings touching oh were over the the the Ark of the Covenant and in that place was the Shekinah remember brother Shelley told us on Tuesday night talking about the day of atonement it was the only day of the year that the high priest only could go behind that curtain and there with the incense he could experience the glory of God but it was that one time where he brought the blood and he put it upon The Mercy Seat one time a year but when the precious lamb of God came to the earth when that precious lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the world came into the Earth and he shed his blood that we could have life and having more abundantly it was put on the altar once and for all there was not a necessity for another bull to be killed there was not a necessity for another lamb to be killed there was not a necessity for another turtle dove to be brought to be killed because that one sacrifice was brought for war for all people for all time there never had to be another one but then and when that lamb died at Calvary that curtain was rent from top to bottom and it was an open invitation for the believer to come into that place where the Shekinah of God the Shekinah Glory of God was yes but people have been too afraid too afraid too afraid you know why we've been too afraid because we've been sold a bill of goods by the enemy that tried to continue to tell us that we were not worthy to come in that we had too many sins in our life that we had too many scars in our life that we had too much hanging on us that we could not go behind there but my friend we have an open invitation and you don't have to get good enough our lamb was the best he was the perfect lamb and he invited us in behind there when he invited us in behind that curtain that curtain that was in the Tabernacle then on in the temple it was no longer there no longer there according to historians they're not even sure that the ark was there but I want to tell you something today when you find yourself in that little room he made a promise to you I will meet you there if you have met the requirements that he gave in his word if you repent and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and there is something behind that Veil that Veil that was ripped from top to bottom that's not the veil that I'm talking about there is a veil that the enemy has tried to put in front of us to keep us out but the word the revelation of the of Jesus Christ has come and unveiled to the people of God thank you now this unveiling was not to the crowd at Large when this unveiling takes place it's an unveiling to an individual because in a crowd this size and smaller God can bring a revelation of his word and one person get the Revelation and the one sitting right beside of them think well that's the craziest thing I've ever heard one person can leave a meeting saying another person can leave send me a buzzard it's because it's an individual Revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ but I am calling to this body and to anybody that will listen to me do not miss your hour of visitation because the Holy Spirit wants to move Among Us and is moving Among Us and has been moving Among Us and people have been pressing in and coming as close as they can to the fire because they realize I'm not going to be left behind this church is moving forward I'm not going to be left behind I am not going to sit in my seat of misery while everybody else is getting something I'm just gonna step up and see if I can get something I don't feel anything right this second what do feelings have to do with it what do feelings have to do with it but everybody else is getting in and I'm not feeling a thing maybe you're still in the outer Court maybe you're just in the inner Court I'm not trying to Badger you I'm not trying to no I'm not trying to make you feel bad but I'm trying to give you some encouragement than when people are moving forward toward the pillar of fire you ought to get up and move get up and move I'm tired I don't feel like moving did you watch Benjamin today when he walked over his shirt was soaked because he'd give it everything he had what I recognized in him was that whether you moved or not he was going to [Applause] if you watch your pastor when he preaches and gives everything and we feel tired he does too his body aches doesn't feel good sometimes but he comes and gives everything because he's not paying attention to you he has got a boss that's higher than he is and if you and I could ever get a revelation an understanding that he's not the boss [Applause] I'm not the boss we've all got a higher boss [Applause] if the Lord doesn't come he may be taken off the scene but God is still on the throne and he's still going to be looking for believers believers who are willing to give everything well I can't give everything every time foreign I understand Humanity but many years ago some of you newcomers many years ago God spoke in this place I believe it was while we were still in Columbus I think that it was two minutes in the presence of God would be like eight hours of restful sleep two minutes can you give two minutes do you have two minutes [Music] just two two minutes but I'm tired two minutes can I call you to work some overtime two minutes if I have that wrong I'm sorry but I know it was very short amount of time two minutes will you work some overtime you may be off the work clock but will you work some overtime because I believe if we come in with that kind of attitude God there's something Supernatural that I'm being told about and I don't feel it right this second as I'm getting out of my car and I'm trying to get energy to walk in that building but God I heard that preacher say that two minutes and God I'm coming I'm willing to give three minutes of overtime because I believe that if I can ever get in that two minutes then time won't matter and you won't care about the overtime anymore you'll be so grateful for the power of God that surges inside of you that you will go away saying oh how good it was to be in the presence of God so Ezekiel has this vision of the water that's coming from the Throne of God Hallelujah now when something originates from the Throne of God [Music] and the water came from the Throne of God and when Ezekiel Saw It he saw this one with a measuring line in his hand and this one goes and he measures out a thousand cubits we don't talk in qubits in 2022 that is approximately 1476 feet those of you that understand football it's approximately four lengths of the field 1476 feet so this one measures out a thousand cubits this water this holy water that is coming ushering forth from the Throne of God and the first measurement he gives and Ezekiel says it was to my ankles and then he measures out another thousand now we are at three thousand feet approximately and when the when he steps out into that water the water it says that it was to my knees and then he steps out another thousand cubits and and Ezekiel says then it was to my loins and when he says I said when he measured the fourth time out into those Waters he said it was Waters to swim in it was no more splashing around just feeling good on the feet or up to the knees but there was Waters to swim in so the the river of God that was coming out from under the Throne of God ushering forth Ezekiel was seeing this and Ezekiel to my understanding was not just satisfied to stay on the sidelines Ezekiel knew that there was healing in that water Ezekiel knew that there was something in that water that was Supernatural because it originated at the Throne of God now I want you to turn with me to Genesis chapter 2. Genesis chapter 2 and verse 1 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant in the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was no man to till the ground and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul verse 8. and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and watered I'm sorry in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil ten and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from fence it was parted and became into four heads the name of the first is pishon that is it which compasses the whole land of havilah where there is gold and the gold of that land is good there's bedellium and the Onyx Stone the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia and the name of the third river is hideko sometimes called Tigris that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria and the fourth river is Euphrates now I would just like to point out to you these four tributaries from the one River it all originated from the Throne of God we see in the World in Eden the garden that God made it was another symbolism of what was in Heavenly places and the water issuing out of this one River and then it parted into four tributaries and I would like to call it the ankles the knees the loins and Waters to swim in the the word Pichon means increase that's pretty good and it is from the world from uh Strong's number 6335 meaning to spread to grow up to grow fat or scattered then we have the river gihon meaning to burst forth or to Break Forth then we have the river hideko or Tigris meaning rapid and the last one Euphrates meaning fruitfulness now I find it interesting that when you look at the word Euphrates in the Hebrew the Hebrew transliteration is not anywhere near to Euphrates it's perath meaning to break forth or rushing in this water that is coming through the land of Eden and coming from the Throne of God we have increase we have spreading or growing up or growing fat we have breaking forth or bursting forth we have rapid and when I think of Rapid uh you know we we think if you if you get to thinking about Rapids you start thinking dangerous but here is where my mind went when I begin to think about rapid we have had prophecy after prophecy in this house about acceleration and that is what we've looked for it for years friends and the word of God standeth Shore he will not leave us well without a witness he will not leave us here to uh be filled with doubt but he will always have somebody who is going to hold on to a promise and say I'm going to see that fulfilled I'm going to see it fulfilled I'm looking for that this week I'm seeing it already that God is doing things speedily he's very be a before you can even ask here it is what if I don't ask you probably will now you probably will ask but I am looking for that time where the thought crosses my mind and as it's making my way to my lips and it's coming out of my mouth it is now a spoken word manifest in front of my eyes what is the theme of Cam meeting come and see come and see you doubt come and see amen you don't think it can happen come and see you come with your critical attitude I already asked you to leave it outside of the door and come planning to give a little overtime just a little overtime preacher you don't have any idea what I'm going to encounter before this week is out none of us do none of us have any idea what's going to what we're going to encounter before this week is out but every test that you have come into your pathway and into your visual it is because God has once again said you are here for the test and you are also the one who will walk away with the testimony I have one I have one or the other choice here I can be that one who comes under the test and I can resist the devil and he'll flee from me and I'll walk away with a testimony or I can be like some others and I will walk away just as doubting as I was when I came it's either Faith or doubt am I going to respond to the word of God am I going to respond to the worship am I going to press in with everything that's within me so that God can move Among Us well what if I don't get anything are you am I am I willing to work and to serve so that others can receive from the hand of God that's what musicians do that's what service leaders do worship leaders preachers audio video technicians you that are helping to cook all this food and make sure that the the guests are taking it's it's serving are you willing am I willing to serve and am I willing to give what I have and then after I feel like that I've exhausted myself to come in and give a little overtime say Lord here I am I'm willing to press in a little bit more because I am not satisfied to be up to my ankles I am not satisfied to beat just to my loins but I want the river of God to so consume me so envelop me because I realize that what is ushering out of the Throne of God my mind went to and brother Brandon was talking about that ocean he said you can take a cup full of that ocean water and in that ocean water are all of the chemicals of that entire ocean in that cup it's all the same chemical makeup even though you only have a cup and friends that is what God is doing for us and has done for us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he poured out the Holy Ghost on the 120 in the upper room he wanted to let them know the power that was in Jesus Christ and raised him up from the dead was there to Quicken them there to Quicken them it wasn't just to make them feel good although it did it wasn't there just so they could walk away and say wow that was a powerful meeting oh because all of these things from glory to glory he's changing me his likeness and image he wants to perfect in me and if we will allow the river of God to flow from the Throne of God and flow into our lives we're not talking about this building we're going to call this building today an inanimate object one that when we are taken out of here and the Earth is cleansed this is going to be turned to ashes but you I we are of a different material we are of a different substance we are of the same substance of that that is Flowing out from the Throne of God the very same life the life that was in that blood cell that he gave that day at Calvary that life has come back to the believer and indwells us in such a way that we cry out for more [Music] because we realize that there's more to be had I got my cup full but I want another cup full and then I want the gallon jug full and then I want the 55 gallon barrel full and then I want the ocean full I want all that I can get from my Lord because he is the inexhaustible fountain there you're not going to exhaust the the life that flows out of him because it's inexhaustible and it's for you now what if a man this is from the restoration of the Bride tree now what if a man is planted in such a thing as by the river where the Springs nine different Springs feeding into him oh my what an establishment he has and a man that's planted by the river the rivers of water one water one Spirit there are Gifts of healing Same Spirit Gifts of Prophecy same spirits Same Spirit but many gifts one Giver now David saw him and he was planted by this tree now he could not die now notice why he had life in his roots where is the roots or the life of the tree stays in the roots certainly comes up and bears its fruit all right now I do want to remind you of that stick that had no roots no roots but it got behind the veil it God embedded in the River of Life that was behind the veil Where the River of waters are flowing from there it was immersed and I don't understand why the other ones didn't bloom I can only go back to by his foreknowledge he did predestinate me to be conformed into His Image that's the only thing I can tell you because the Levites were predestinated to be conformed into the Earthly priesthood and I and you have been ordained to be transformed into the image of the Living God why is that because there's something that pulls us back to that living fountain in behind the veil David saw him and he was planted by this tree now I could not die notice why he had life in his roots where is the roots or the life of the tree stays in the roots certainly comes up and bears its fruit all right watch his roots had life in them to bring forth his fruit and season now remember this tree will not cast its fruit listen this tree will not cast its fruit now you take a tree and put it away from water the first thing you know you got little apples they're all naughty and warm eaten but it'll cast its crop that's what's the matter with the churches today you've done God away from the river got away from them gifts of the Spirit they got a church natural friends there's too many Church Naturals they just got church natural and they got away from spiritual gifts and the spiritual things and they cast their fruit what do they do their Believers live with the world act like the world steal cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble have bunco parties in the church to pay the preacher and everything else soup suppers and dances see they cast their fruits it's just like the world now see God didn't call us to be Baptist methodists episcopalians lutherans he didn't call us to be that he called us to operate under that Pentecostal blessing not the denominational Pentecostal bless I'm talking about our acts Pentecost that blessing that God called us to walk under that blessing and and this blessing is not just to be a blessing to us and we walk away and we forget it but we are to live by the rivers of Living Water where that we are constantly getting life but there are too many people who come and they stick their ankle in and then they pull it back out and they end up they end up stealing and cheating and lying and smoking and drinking and gambling and having bunco parties and gossiping and backbiting and having hatred and strife and anxieties and all of these things because we just keep coming and dipping our toe in the water rather than living in the Fountain of Living Water where there is bursting forth and there is acceleration and there's fruitfulness the river of God that is coming from the very River of God and brother Branham finishes this quote and the unbeliever looks and say there's no difference between that person and me now if all we're doing is we're coming and sticking Our Roots in and then we're pulling Our Roots out listen to me you parents you go from one Church to another and you put your children in and you take your children out you don't think it's necessary to be here every service your children are in and your children are out and you are too and your roots get dry and all of the sudden we have naughty wormy apples because the life is not there but oh my God if we could ever if we could ever get a past if we could ever get a past looking at one another we've been told over and over again three ways the three steps to get more like Jesus is to take your eyes off of people put them right on Jesus Take Your Eyes Off of people put them right on Jesus Take Your Eyes Off of people and put them right on Jesus I tell you friends we will see a difference in our lives we'll see it in this house and then it'll go outside of these four walls and it'll go outside of the normal spectrum that we're used to and we will see people's lives change because the unbelievers will no longer be looking at us and saying there's no difference between you and me you have the same problems that I have you have the same anxieties that I have you've had the same diseases that I have you backbiting gossip and you do all sorts of things you you go to parties and you drink just like I do you know there's no difference between you and me but if we ever fully immerse ourselves in that River there is something that will happen that will be so Supernatural for us and in us that we will no longer have the unbeliever saying there's no difference between you and me but the unbelievers will be then becoming insane what is that that you have what is that that you've got that calls I I mean I I can see that you're going through uh terrible health issue but I see such joy in you that is so overwhelming you that even though I know that you're fighting a battle in your physical body there's a Radiance about you that is so Supernatural I want to know what you have I want the musicians to come as I finish up today Joel chapter 2 verses 15 through 32 blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet let the priests the Ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the Altar and let them say spare thy people O Lord and give not thine Heritage to reproach that the Fetters the Heathen sorry should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is there God then will the Lord be jealous for his land and pity his people yea the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you corn and wine and oil and you shall be satisfied therewith and I will know more make you a reproach among the Heathen but I will remove far off from you the northern Army and will drive him into a land Barren and desolate with his face toward the EC and his hinder parked toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill savior shall come up because he hath done great things fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things Be not Afraid ye Beasts of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness to spring for the tree Bethel fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength glad your children of Zion and rejoice rejoice in this week of rejoicing Rejoice rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat you remember what I told you about the river out of that River there's fruitfulness out of that River there's well there's acceleration acceleration and the floor shall be full of weed and the Vats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years [Music] [Applause] [Applause] whoa [Applause] [Music] I will restore I will restore I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm it's all the same bug it's all the same bug and it has been around for years and years destroying it started out to take the life out to destroy the bark and to get into the very innermost part of the tree but I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you you know what that means friends you can't even be mad at God because of everything that he's put you through to bring your Perfection because it's the great Army that he sent among you because it was to test you and to try you and he says I will restore and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed never again will the unbeliever say there's no difference between you and me because the shame has been lifted all of the years that the Locust and the caterpillar has come in either way I will restore saith the Lord foreign [Music] and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams your young man shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heaven and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion into Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call can I see some hands of candidates in this place who will say Lord I am a candidate I feel like that I have had some stripping away I have felt like that I have had the four stages of this of this this caterpillar this insect that is Stripped Away things in my life the Lord I will not remain angry I will not remain disappointed I will not remain with hope deferred but I will rise up and know that it was your army that you sent and at the appointed day at the appointed time at the appointed hour of acceleration yeah because I've been called back to the river because I've been called back to the supernatural because I've been called back to something that is above this natural life that I've been living that I've been trying to uh just fake myself out with and say it's all I'll ever be it's all I'll ever see I want you by the grace of God to say that is not me anymore I have been called to be a supernatural believer I have been called to be a supernatural believer I have been called to be something above the ordinary above the ordinary Church this today is for you those that are coming in are going to receive some of what you got some of what you are after but this is for you today this is to this is for you if you have been feeling like you have just been so Stripped Away so stripped and even times that you have been disgusted because there was such a delay we have used the term around here hope deferred you felt like when is it ever going to come I'm not trying to help you uh hype you up today to tell you that it's coming this week but I have such an expectation inside of me I don't know what you'll get this week but I have already been fed I've already been fed I've already been experiencing well what did Jude what did you do preacher what did you do the Holy Spirit was here on Tuesday night you know what I did when I go home I got rid of Facebook just got rid of it turned it off and I looked at any of that stuff this week that's all I did differently but there was something about that act I don't know what your stone will be I don't know what your rock would be I don't know what you'll throw in the air I don't know what you'll choose to throw in the air as an act of obedience toward God to say I cannot remain in this place that I have been in I can't do it I have got to do something I am going to throw a rock in the air I don't know what you'll do maybe you'll go outside this afternoon when you get home and just go outside your home and pick up a rock and throw I don't know but I want you to do a motivated different thing than you normally do and say God I am doing something to activate the spirit of the Lord I've got to activate the spirit of the lord inside of my life and I cannot do it in and of myself but I need Melchizedek to come by I need El Shaddai to come by [Music] sing Benson ha ha ha [Music] feet together [Music] the river of God sets my feet to dancing cause we Rejoice for the rivers here or the river of God sets my feet to dancing the river of God fills my heart with tear the river of God fills my mouth with laughter we rejoice [Music] and over the fields there [Music] the river of God fills my heart with cheers for the river is here oh the river of God sets my feet to dancing the river of God fills my heart with cheer the river of God fills my mouth with laughter and we Rejoice for the river is here down the mountain the river flows it brings refreshing wherever it goes through the valleys and over the fields river is rushing the river is here the river of God it's my feet to dancing the river of God fills my heart with cheer the river of God fills my mouth with laughter Oh we Rejoice for the river is here oh the river of God sets my feet to dancing the river of God fills my heart with cheer the river of God fills my mouth with laughter Oh we Rejoice for the river is here up the mountain we love to go to find the presence of the Lord along their Banks of this River we run after giving praise to the sun oh the river of God sets our feet to dancing the river of God fills my heart with tear the river of God set my feet to dancing and we Rejoice for the river is here it's here it's here it's here it's here it's here it's here it's here [Music] Rejoice for the river is here we Rejoice for the rivers here jumping jumping jumping jumping jumping jumping and we Rejoice for the river is here [Music] for the river is here the river of God fills my mouth [Music] the banks of this room [Music] and we rejoice for the rivers here it's down the mountain the River Falls it brings [Music] here [Music] [Applause] [Music] we rejoice [Music] some of us are going to have to let go of a phrase that we like to use often it's not fair [Music] it's not fair it's not fair ask the Holy Spirit to help you to eliminate that phrase from your vocabulary you know why I'm saying that because the canker worm and the Palmer worm the caterpillar that great Army it was one that he sent he sent it he said it so when we say it's not fair we're really saying Lord I despise this Army remember he despised the shame but for the joy that was set before him who was the joy you me and in order for this joy that was set before him to come to completion he had to send this great Army to bring about the completion in US so we need to just get rid of it's not fair and say Lord all that that's come hearts that I allowed in my life because of my discouragement and My Hope deferred and then I embrace the next stage of that bug that insect but it was all a part of God dealing with me because he did not want me to tap in to a broken cistern but he wanted me to be connected to the river of Living Water the one that ushers forth from the Throne of God press in with everything that's within you friends and let's watch God move not Tuesday night but from this day forward we'll watch him move I've given you everything I've got [Laughter] a hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus I think some of you came around the Altar and maybe you wanted to moan or groan a little bit or cry and intercession a little bit but I want you to understand that bridal bridal repentance may not look like what we have expected or thought in the past but what you need to catch a hold of right now is this last some of the last things that brother Greely was saying this throwing the rock in the air or doing something a little different than what you've been doing you know it's Insanity to keep doing the same things that you've always done expecting to get something different if you always do what you've always done you'll always be what you've always been but we have an opportunity and so we start off with a song that almost sounds like it doesn't fit the moment but it actually did fit the moment it was a little bit of it was a little bit of a whiplash for you but it really does fit the moment because God is giving us this opportunity to do something a little different than what we would normally do and see if he will do something a little different if he will meet us a little different and then what when brother Greely was talking about we have to be careful about this life isn't fair because we're really despising the army that God sins well let me tell you what what the Army looks like let me describe the Army to you that Army has familiar faces that Army looks like your family that Army looks like your brothers and sisters in Christ that Army looks like people you work with it looks like people you know that you've been familiar with and it looks like we we often say well the enemy is is using them and the devil is doing this and a bad spirit is doing the other and the devil's got a hold of them come on what we need to realize sometime is God has harnessed them and he's using them as his army he's using them as His hit the strike against the hardness of our own hearts and to bring us to a place where we can worship him I want you to come back now that we have set the tone for the song I want you to come back and sing that and I want us to enter into the best of our ability for we have surely heard the word of the Lord today amen the river of God sets my feet [Music] Rejoice for the river is here [Music] in town [Music] we rejoice [Music] choice for 14. the river of God is [Music] God because my heart with you the river of God fills my mouth [Music] Mountain we love to go to find

somebody to tell you what's wrong with you when he's here you just need to touch him and he is here he's still here he's wonderful and worthy to be praised isn't he praise God so if you are streaming this service today let us remind you that we will be here Tuesday through Sunday we have one night to rest one night off and that's the night that a lot of people are traveling in so Tuesday night at seven o'clock Wednesday night at seven o'clock Thursday night Friday night seven o'clock Saturday afternoon six o'clock Sunday morning 11 o'clock we don't have a schedule so much but brother Greely starting us off we're going to see what the Lord has oh I can hear that old song I got just what I needed I got just what I needed I got just what I needed from the Lord he knew just what I needed it he knew just what I needed I got just what I needed from the Lord word don't you love it when you can feel that way I got just what I needed I got just what I needed I got just what I needed from the Lord I got just what I needed I got just got just what I needed from the Lord oh I got just what I needed I got just what I needed I got just what I needed [Music] just what I needed and I got just what I needed from the Lord of time [Music] I got just what I needed [Music] he knew just what I needed so I got just what I needed [Music] oh [Music] I don't know but that old red and white sitting out there in the parking lot it might have got on me just then that all their memories Hallelujah well some have hoped that we would have a service underneath the tent and I know that would be lovely but God gave us this place he moved us from the Tabernacle here and we had a temporary dwelling place now we have a permanent Dwelling Place and we might sometime in the future have a series of meetings Under the Tent but I prayed just like I told them I would do and I don't want to discourage anybody but I prayed just like I told them that I would do and I felt like in my heart we did not want to interrupt what God is already doing there's an entirely different uh atmosphere when you're out in the open like that it's a tremendous amount of work and I know that a lot of you don't understand that and you think it's just Toten if we can just tote it out there and we we don't even have to worry about Toten because we've got plenty of toters it's not the toting that changes things it's all the work that goes into plugging it up and making it work and we're already having problems with two brand new microphones and so we don't want to go we don't want to go out there and then it's squeal and it holler and it cry and go through all of that and the streaming the people that are planning to stream we want that to be flawless they asked caulk and he said well sure we can stream out there but we can't guarantee that it would be Flawless and these people who cannot be here want to be here and the only way they can be here is through the streaming so please don't be disappointed with me I feel like the Lord settled it for me and when he did then I didn't have any other thought of it I just thought this is what we will do but God's going to move he's going to move and you're not going to want to miss it amen so you be here we have this kind of a meeting once a year and you say well I didn't know when it was yes you did yes you did you can never use that excuse because it's Tabernacles week it's been Tabernacles week now for the last few years it'll be Tabernacles week next year October 3rd through the 8th it might fluctuate between September and October but it's real easy to Google when Tabernacles is that's a good time to take a knot off work if you can but you have to go ahead you have to plan ahead and get that done and that's why we announce it far in advance I know some of you will be tired you will come in here tired like brother Greeley said but I believe God will meet you here when the Holy Ghost fell in Blue Springs and my grandmother was sharecropping and her husband died and left her with 15 children she would work all day in the field she would plow the field Like a Man Behind The Mule and she would carry a hundred pound sacks of Guyana fertilizer to the field and distributed herself and never missed a service when the spirit of God was moving when they called meetings she was there and they said sometimes she would come in 10 minutes late and she still had dirt on her forehead and she'd be wiping the wispy hairs out of her eyes and she would drag to the Pew in the church people would feel so sorry for her because they knew how hard she had worked that day in the field in the hot Alabama Sun but they said that when she would get to her Pew sometimes she'd sit down bow her head and pray a little prayer and when she come up this was my great-grandmother and when she would come up she'd come up with the light of the Lord on her face she'd come up with her hands in the air she danced more than anybody shouted more than anybody hollered Hallelujah more than any one they said Not only did God give her that recharge but she'd get up the next morning refreshed and go and do it all over again now listen God can help us we may have eaten a whole lot more hybrid food than my great-grandmother did but he can strengthen us if we'll let him if you start getting this mentality I heard someone say this week I'm going to stop saying I'm going to stop confessing that I'm getting old I'm going to quit confessing that I think we should because if you convince yourself I know it's a reality out there I'm not a dummy but if you convince yourself of that then you'll start claiming things you'll start acting like it Felix was here and he was singing Happy Birthday in Publix to a 90 year old woman said it was her birthday and he told her I don't know that boy but he told her he said at this rate you're going to outlive the queen not planning that's [Music] have a plan not to let these things hinder us don't look in the mirror and start expecting it to get worse every day we're so close to The Blessing of Abraham now come on till you might look in the mirror and say hey I'm looking a little better and I've been looking look what God's doing you believe he can do it I know he can amen goodbye to the streamers we love you thank you for being with us we're going to go
