[34:59] Lord Jesus Christ.
[35:09] He who thought it not robbery
[35:13] to be equal with God.
[35:16] But he humbled himself,
[35:20] bowed himself down, came into the earth,
[35:23] and surrendered himself to the cross
[35:28] even to death.
[35:32] But oh, he rose again.
[35:36] The Father hath highly exalted him,
[35:40] and given him a name,
[35:43] that at the name Jesus,
[35:46] every knee should bow
[35:49] and every tongue should confess

[36:12] of the hand?
[36:16] We will take them to our Lord Jesus.
[36:21] The highly exalted one
[36:24] who paid the price at Calvary.
[36:27] He saw the hand and he sees the need.
[36:31] We received a request for Olivia
[36:34] Ellsworth. She is not well today at
[36:36] home. Let's ask the Lord to give her
[36:38] complete healing in her body.
[36:41] Remember all of the requests that have
[36:43] been put on the app this week. God sees
[36:47] every one of those needs. Particularly,
[36:50] let's remember Michael and Crystalin and
[36:53] their family to the Lord. They sure have
[36:57] been, like a few of the other families,
[36:59] in a real battle for health.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; But I I know he's able. Amen.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon and and her mom both need
[37:07] our prayers this morning. We know that
[37:10] God is more than able. Remember brother
[37:13] Gabriel Toari, Sister Elizabeth Murphy
[37:17] to the Lord that God will intervene
[37:20] concerning her pain.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul Drown uh is uh believing
[37:25] God for great manifestation of his
[37:29] miraculous healing power. I'm believing
[37:31] with him with everything that I possibly
[37:34] can.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Sister Audrey, uh, sometimes I fail to
[37:38] mention, I think I probably should
[37:40] mention her every service. She needs
[37:42] healing and and strength in her body and
[37:45] we love her and we miss her and we want
[37:47] to see her her well.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Uh, remember Josiah to the Lord in
[37:52] prayer today. Remember the lighthouse
[37:55] for Jesus. God knows the need and he
[37:58] knows how to move.
[38:00] uh as only he can. We have fellowship
[38:03] weekend coming up. Let's ask the Lord to
[38:05] move among us in a profound way. I am
[38:09] waiting on uh a piece of information. I
[38:12] hope everybody will hear this. I'm
[38:15] waiting for a piece of information from
[38:17] Jerusalem. It could come any day. And
[38:20] based on that information, it will
[38:23] determine whether I have to leave
[38:24] immediately or not to go. So, there's a
[38:27] possibility that I wouldn't even be here
[38:29] for the fellowship weekend. God sees the
[38:32] situation.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; And he knows how to move.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; I'm ready for the Lord to settle it.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Elelliana Jane came home feeling okay
[38:44] and then within a day was really, really
[38:48] sick. She has been very sick the last
[38:51] few days. Today was doing a little
[38:53] better. Let's ask the Lord to give her a
[38:55] complete healing. I'm glad to have her
[38:57] home sick or well, but it's very hard to
[39:00] see her sick.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, of course.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; She needs the Lord's help. And remember
[39:04] Jenna, who's I'm sure like all mama's
[39:07] tired, not getting good sleep, but God
[39:10] is able to restore.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; I think it's all of them that I had
[39:16] wrote down. out across the stream. The
[39:18] Lord sees the needs that you have
[39:21] &gt;&gt; and he is well able to meet every one of
[39:23] those needs according to his riches in
[39:27] glory.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Would you sing this little course with
[39:29] us as we're getting ready to pray today?
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Sweep over
[39:38] my soul.
[39:41] Sweep over
[39:44] my soul. Oh, sweet spirit,
[39:50] sweep over
[39:52] my soul.
[39:58] My rest
[40:00] is complete.
[40:03] While I sit
[40:06] at your feet,
[40:12] sweep over
[40:15] my soul. Brother Daniel, will you come
[40:18] and pray today? Sing again.
[40:21] Sweep over
[40:23] my soul.
[40:26] Sweep over,
[40:30] sweet,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; sweet spirit.
[40:35] Sweep over.
[40:39] I thank you, Lord, for the rest that you
[40:42] give.
[40:44] My rest
[40:46] is complete
[40:49] while I sit.
[40:53] You said all of the struggle, Lord, when
[40:57] we sit at your feet, sweep over my soul.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Can we pray together this morning? Oh
[41:06] lamb of God, what a privilege it is to
[41:09] return to your feet today. To be able to
[41:13] cast all of our burdens before you,
[41:16] &gt;&gt; knowing, Lord, that there's nothing too
[41:18] difficult for you.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; There's nothing too hard.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; There's no price too great, Lord.
[41:26] There's nothing you can't do. So, we
[41:28] rest in that today. We rest that every
[41:30] struggle, Lord, is complete in you. and
[41:33] that that your purpose will be
[41:35] fulfilled. We're asking for everything
[41:37] that was spoken before you this morning,
[41:40] Lord, and for every unspoken prayer
[41:42] request. May we have the confidence that
[41:45] was written to the the Philippian
[41:46] people, Lord, that you who began a good
[41:49] work will be faithful to complete it.
[41:51] And whatever the outcome, Lord, that we
[41:53] see in this life, all things are working
[41:56] for our good. And you're not going to
[41:58] stop short. You're not going to do
[42:00] something incomplete. You can't do
[42:03] anything halfway. You can't fail today.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; And we rest in you. And we thank you for
[42:09] that sweet spirit. We thank you, Lord,
[42:10] that your word never changes. We thank
[42:13] you that you're transforming us. We
[42:15] thank you, Lord, that the hair is
[42:17] beginning to grow.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; And we're in expectation, Lord, of you
[42:22] moving in a mighty way in our lives as
[42:24] we continue to surrender our will, our
[42:26] will, our thoughts, Lord. Anything
[42:29] unlike you, we want it washed away. We
[42:31] want it cleaned away, Lord. We want the
[42:33] groves of our mind to be pure, Lord. We
[42:36] want no dendrite of unholiness. We want
[42:38] no paganism, Lord. We want nothing that
[42:41] would displease you or would cause you
[42:43] to veer away or look at us, Lord,
[42:45] through stern eyes. But we just want
[42:47] your peace and your love. For we know
[42:49] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[42:51] forever. And that your purpose will be
[42:53] fulfilled. So we look to you for these
[42:55] things as we pray in the name of above
[42:58] all names our Lord and Savior Jesus
[43:00] Christ.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; We give you praise Lord.
[43:14] You may have your seats today.
[43:19] It is certainly good to see you in the
[43:21] house of the Lord. the Lord healing and
[43:24] strengthening and blessing and bringing
[43:27] the saints back. We are still missing
[43:29] some, but we're glad that the Lord has
[43:32] helped and and given strength to those
[43:34] that have been out. We're very happy to
[43:38] welcome home Brother Eddie and Sister
[43:40] Janet Miller.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:47] Glad that Brother Daniel and Sister Anna
[43:49] are back safely with them.
[43:52] got them moved in. I suspect that all
[43:54] the boxes aren't quite unpacked yet, but
[43:57] uh we're we're glad that they're here
[44:00] and just asking the Lord to strengthen
[44:02] them and help them. We're glad that
[44:04] Benjamin and Jenna and Elelliana are
[44:06] back, although we're missing Jenna and
[44:08] Elelliana today.
[44:13] God is good and faithful in every way.
[44:16] And we're blessed to know that he's
[44:18] looking out after us. He's taking care
[44:20] of us. He is everything that we have
[44:23] need of. And we're blessed to be sitting
[44:25] in the house of the Lord today where
[44:28] we're privileged to hear the fresh word
[44:31] of the Lord. What he has on his mind at
[44:34] this moment. We are here to hear that
[44:38] and let it change us. We don't want it
[44:40] just to go in our ear and become
[44:42] intellectual knowledge. We want it to go
[44:44] into our spirit ears and become a part
[44:47] of who we are that we can become more
[44:50] like him every day. We're going to
[44:52] invite brother Cade to the piano and and
[44:55] uh help us to continue to worship as
[44:57] we're getting ready for the preaching of
[44:59] the word today. I'm going to call on uh
[45:02] brother IAS and brother Aaron Graves.
[45:05] We'll let these brothers come to you
[45:07] today and uh give uh the offering. Uh,
[45:11] can I ask a favor of you as our brothers
[45:13] come to you that you help to pay
[45:15] attention as the bag is passed to you
[45:18] that the that the offering bag can be
[45:21] passed from one end to the other so that
[45:23] the offering is completed and taken and
[45:25] those that want to give can give.
[45:28] Because we're not just giving to give
[45:30] away our money. We're giving to be
[45:33] pleasing to the Lord and to keep
[45:35] covenant with him and to see that the
[45:38] purposes of God are are carried on in
[45:41] the earth in the end time. And when we
[45:43] give our finances to him, we're blessed
[45:46] to know that he is doing his work and
[45:49] that we are a part of that. We're an
[45:51] integral part of what he is doing in the
[45:54] end time. Brother Cade, God bless you as
[45:57] you help us to worship.
[46:15] Lord, we are the ones called by your
[46:19] name.
[46:23] We humble ourselves now as we pray.
[46:31] renouncing every sin in wicked way.
[46:40] We lift our voice, seek your face and
[46:45] say,

[54:40] Let's go ahead and thank him for the
[54:42] rain. We thank you for the Holy Ghost
[54:45] rain. We thank you for the Holy Ghost
[54:49] rain.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Woo. Isn't he wonderful?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me, is he wonderful?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Give Give him another hand clap of
[55:03] praise. I don't know why I don't.
[55:14] He's wonderful. You may be seated this
[55:17] morning. It's a grand privilege to be in
[55:21] the house of the Lord.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; To have our health,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; to have our strength,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; and and have a desire.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Uh so many people are lacking in the in
[55:33] the area of desire,
[55:35] &gt;&gt; so I feel blessed this morning that I
[55:38] have a desire to serve the Lord.
[55:41] With everything that I have, I want to
[55:43] serve him. And the longer I serve him,
[55:48] the sweeter he grows. Is that just a
[55:51] song or is there some truth to that?
[55:54] &gt;&gt; There is some truth to that. If you
[55:56] believe that, say, "Amen."
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Uh, I think that will do for the music.
[56:00] I I have enjoyed it and I I think
[56:03] that'll do. Let's give them a great
[56:04] thank you.
[56:10] Luke Yovich, I wonder if I could have
[56:12] you to open those two doors there uh
[56:15] that are closed and prop them open so
[56:18] that I can see right out through there.
[56:21] And I would appreciate that so very
[56:23] much. Uh it is wonderful to know who we
[56:27] are and whose we are.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Uh it is good to see more of the folks
[56:31] making it back. Sister Megan has had
[56:33] quite a time. She's still partially deaf
[56:35] in one ear, right, right ear, but we
[56:39] know that the Lord can open that up.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; He's more than able.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody believe he's more than able?
[56:47] &gt;&gt; He is more than able. Uh I'm not going
[56:49] to ask you to stand because it's not my
[56:52] text, but I want to read you uh from the
[56:56] psalm for just a moment. We um for for
[57:01] several years now we have looked at uh
[57:06] the prophetic significance of a psalm
[57:11] for the year.
[57:13] And uh I go all the way back here to
[57:17] about 20 uh let me see 20
[57:23] 16
[57:26] 2010
[57:29] 2009 2008.
[57:32] So we go all the way back to 2008.
[57:35] And in 2008 the psalm was 108.
[57:40] And so the spirit of the Lord quickened
[57:42] that. He made that real. Was spoken by
[57:46] someone who I believe is extremely
[57:50] prophetic.
[57:51] And I said, "Well, Lord, I'm going to I
[57:53] agree with that. There's something in my
[57:55] spirit."
[57:57] Um Luke, we can find there's I'm sorry
[58:00] to just talk out in church like this,
[58:02] but there's one in the back. Take one
[58:04] out of my door or whatever. You all just
[58:06] borrow one. They disappear. Uh, if you
[58:10] ever just happen to look up and see one
[58:11] of those doors stops that belongs to us
[58:13] at your house, would you bring it back?
[58:17] Um, I can only imagine how they leave,
[58:22] but they do.
[58:24] Uh, we've had about six to disappear and
[58:27] I just buy more. But, but you know that
[58:30] uh there's there's a better solution for
[58:32] that. Uh, out of my pocket, I bought a
[58:35] set of silverware for the back. Not not
[58:38] silverware. What do you call it now?
[58:42] Flate wear. Well, it's not flat, but
[58:45] uh I don't like plastic.
[58:49] Um I know that it's the best we can do.
[58:52] Uh hard enough to get things cleaned up
[58:55] after a meal. And and I know that's the
[58:57] best we can do for the sometime for the
[58:59] fellowship, Paul. But I don't like
[59:01] plastic forks and spoons. I don't
[59:04] believe it's God.
[59:08] I don't like paper plates. I use them
[59:11] when I have to, but I don't like paper
[59:13] plates. Um, there are just certain
[59:16] things that don't work well. But I found
[59:19] out if you put a my wife, well, she just
[59:21] got on to me because I would get a real
[59:23] plate and put it under my paper plate.
[59:25] She said, "I was still going to have to
[59:26] wash it." Well, I don't know what to
[59:28] say, honey, but some things you just
[59:31] can't eat good on a paper plate. So, I
[59:33] bought flatwear for the back and people
[59:35] will come in on Tuesday night. These
[59:37] wonderful musicians and I don't want to
[59:40] reflect on them in any negative way, but
[59:42] they uh bring their lunch sometime or
[59:45] the quick supper uh in a little
[59:47] container and they use a flatear and
[59:51] well, didn't take long and I had one
[59:54] fork and one spoon.
[59:58] So, I bought another set and I've
[1:00:02] already saw that I'm missing a fork
[1:00:05] and a spoon. And I'm going to just start
[1:00:08] doing like Bobby Connor and calling it
[1:00:10] back in the spirit. Bring me my fork.
[1:00:13] Please, Lord, bring it back. Anyway, you
[1:00:17] you'd just be surprised the perils of a
[1:00:19] pastor.
[1:00:21] The things we go through. You think I
[1:00:23] just sit around and and do nothing, but
[1:00:25] I I I I I try to figure these mysteries
[1:00:29] out sometime. But anyway, moving along.
[1:00:32] You're you're doing you're you're a
[1:00:33] little looser than you were. Uh let's go
[1:00:36] to Psalm 126 because that's where we
[1:00:40] are. And I think you're going to like
[1:00:43] it. I like it.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; I like it. Now, I'm I'm going to read
[1:00:49] real quick here. uh 20:25
[1:00:54] uh Psalm 125. Just real quick, it's just
[1:00:56] five verses.
[1:00:59] I want you to understand that we're
[1:01:00] we're not uh changing our method here.
[1:01:03] We're we're just going in secession. If
[1:01:05] the Lord said this is the psalm for this
[1:01:08] year, we didn't go and try to find one
[1:01:10] we like better for the next year. We
[1:01:13] just went in in order.
[1:01:18] But I have watched God 2020. You ought
[1:01:21] to go back and read that one. I have
[1:01:23] watched the Lord use various aspects of
[1:01:27] the Psalm of the year in our life, in
[1:01:30] our families, in our church. And I just
[1:01:33] want you to be aware of it because we
[1:01:35] don't always usually we read it at least
[1:01:38] once, but we don't always.
[1:01:41] I I want to read 125 just to show you
[1:01:45] that again that was that was for the
[1:01:47] last season. They that trust in the Lord
[1:01:52] shall be as mount Zion. This is 125.
[1:01:55] This was 2025.
[1:01:57] Shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be
[1:02:00] removed but abideth forever. How many of
[1:02:04] you know that you've been taught well
[1:02:06] that Zion is not just a place,
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; it's a people.
[1:02:11] As the mountains are round about
[1:02:14] Jerusalem, so the Lord
[1:02:17] is round about his people from
[1:02:19] henceforth even forever.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And if you've ever been to Jerusalem and
[1:02:25] stood with me on the hos prominade
[1:02:28] looking over the old city, you can
[1:02:31] you're standing on a on a mountain
[1:02:33] range, a small mountain range, and you
[1:02:36] can look all around the the city.
[1:02:40] the particularly the old city but also
[1:02:43] the new city would be on your left. Old
[1:02:46] city would be on your right and a little
[1:02:48] bit in front of you from the hos
[1:02:50] prominade or prominade whichever you
[1:02:53] prefer. That's just a few blocks away
[1:02:56] from the uh the place where I knelt down
[1:03:00] several times on an empty city block and
[1:03:04] prayed in the spirit and called for the
[1:03:07] embassy of the United States to be moved
[1:03:10] to that block and it sits there today.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And regardless of what you think of our
[1:03:18] president uh present administration, he
[1:03:22] is the only one
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; uh if he's never remembered for anything
[1:03:26] else, may he be remembered as being the
[1:03:29] only one
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; who followed through. It wasn't even his
[1:03:33] promise.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; The promise started many generations,
[1:03:37] many administrations before his. But he
[1:03:40] said, "I will renew the promise and I
[1:03:42] will get it done." And it's done. When
[1:03:45] you're standing a few blocks from the
[1:03:47] embassy on the hos prominade, looking
[1:03:50] out over the city, you can tell that the
[1:03:53] whole city of Jerusalem is compassed
[1:03:55] about by mountain ranges. It reminds me
[1:03:58] of the view of Tucson because Tucson is
[1:04:03] also surrounded by mountains and sits
[1:04:05] down in the valley. And so this is a
[1:04:09] powerful image in my mind as the
[1:04:12] mountains are round about Jerusalem. So
[1:04:15] the Lord,
[1:04:17] I want you to just see him surrounding
[1:04:20] his people.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; So the Lord is round about his people.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; What a defense we have.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; No wonder the Psalmist said, "I will
[1:04:31] lift mine eyes unto the hills from
[1:04:34] whence my help comes."
[1:04:37] It comes from the Lord. And where is he
[1:04:39] when he makes such a statement? He's in
[1:04:41] the holy city looking up around the
[1:04:43] mountains that surround Jerusalem. So
[1:04:45] you are surrounded by the one who has
[1:04:48] strength and power to protect you. And
[1:04:52] every other mountain may crumble. Every
[1:04:54] other mountain may fall. Earthquake may
[1:04:57] finish them all. But but the Lord is
[1:05:00] saying to us, they that trust in the
[1:05:02] Lord shall be like Mount Zion, which
[1:05:05] cannot be removed, can be shaken,
[1:05:10] but can't be removed.
[1:05:12] Verse three, for the rod of the wicked
[1:05:14] shall not rest upon the lot of the
[1:05:16] righteous, lest the righteous put forth
[1:05:19] their hands unto iniquity. So we should
[1:05:23] not find ourselves lusting after or
[1:05:26] desiring the lifestyle of the rich and
[1:05:29] famous
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; or the wicked.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's synonymous.
[1:05:35] Do good, O Lord,
[1:05:39] unto those that
[1:05:42] be good. Isn't that a little odd thing?
[1:05:45] Because we say the Lord is good to
[1:05:47] everybody and loves everybody the same.
[1:05:50] Even though the scripture doesn't teach
[1:05:51] that,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; It's not what the Bible says, but it
[1:05:55] sounds nice when you're trying to sell
[1:05:57] uh sell Christianity, but it isn't what
[1:06:00] the Bible said. Lest the righteous,
[1:06:03] okay, he said, "Do good, O Lord, unto
[1:06:04] those that be good." Not do good. Be
[1:06:08] good. And to them that are upright,
[1:06:11] finish in their hearts. As for such as
[1:06:15] turn aside unto their crooked ways, the
[1:06:18] Lord shall lead them forth with the
[1:06:21] workers of iniquity. Watch this. Look
[1:06:24] carefully.
[1:06:26] As for such as turn aside unto their
[1:06:31] crooked ways. Now, this word crooked
[1:06:35] simply means not straight. Yes,
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; this is not uh uh reflecting on uh
[1:06:42] someone's crooked scheming
[1:06:46] uh sly character.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; That's not what is being described here.
[1:06:51] It isn't. It isn't. It simply means as
[1:06:54] for such as turn aside unto their
[1:06:57] nonstraight ways. There's a straight way
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; and and and it goes straight into
[1:07:04] eternal life.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] uh narrow it is and straight. But then
[1:07:10] there's another way and it has all kinds
[1:07:12] of turns and so forth. It is not a
[1:07:14] straight way. It is a wide way. It is an
[1:07:17] appealing way. And some will leave the
[1:07:21] path there on. And it just simply says
[1:07:23] turn aside unto.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that for prolonged
[1:07:29] periods of time they will walk in that
[1:07:31] way, but something has caused them to
[1:07:33] turn to that way. And unto means to be
[1:07:37] joined to for at least a season. They
[1:07:40] are joined to a way that is not
[1:07:43] straight.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Uh listen now. And he said, "As for
[1:07:47] them, the Lord shall lead them forth,
[1:07:50] the backslider, the distracted.
[1:07:53] He shall lead them forth with the
[1:07:55] workers of iniquity.
[1:08:00] But peace shall be upon Israel."
[1:08:03] It doesn't just mean natural.
[1:08:06] We've yet to see that. But spiritual. I
[1:08:10] don't believe in replacement theology,
[1:08:12] but I do believe that we've been joined
[1:08:15] into a covenant. That's what Romans
[1:08:17] tells us. So, we have been joined unto
[1:08:20] Israel.
[1:08:21] And uh so God is saying to us uh
[1:08:25] prophetically through the year that if
[1:08:28] we are one who is turned aside unto a
[1:08:32] way that is not the straight way,
[1:08:34] temporarily distracted and walk upon it
[1:08:36] even a short distance,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; we're going to be brought forth with the
[1:08:40] workers of iniquity.
[1:08:42] So the Lord is saying to us to walk in a
[1:08:45] backsliden condition is not good.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:50] And remember that's not about what you
[1:08:52] do. That's about the condition of your
[1:08:54] heart.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; You heard the greatest message on on
[1:08:59] powerful grace. You see, there is an
[1:09:01] answer to greasy grace.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Powerful grace.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Uh how many of you were here Tuesday
[1:09:08] night?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; How many of you were not here Tuesday
[1:09:11] night? Let me see your hand. Almost as
[1:09:13] many. And how many of you have be honest
[1:09:17] now I I because there's no no uh you
[1:09:20] know there's no sack of coal for you if
[1:09:22] you if you haven't yet. I just want to
[1:09:24] make a point. Uh how many of you maybe
[1:09:26] were not here but you streamed the the
[1:09:28] whole sermon?
[1:09:30] The whole sermon all of it from start to
[1:09:32] finish Tuesday night. Well, that's a
[1:09:34] whole lot less of you. A and and is
[1:09:37] there anybody in here who went back
[1:09:39] since Tuesday night to see it in the
[1:09:41] archive? That's that's a better number.
[1:09:44] Let me encourage you
[1:09:46] uh from the bottom of my heart.
[1:09:49] You don't have to eat the kind of
[1:09:51] pickles I eat. You don't have to like
[1:09:53] the kind of cake I like. Uh you don't
[1:09:56] have to like my tie.
[1:09:59] There are just things I don't care
[1:10:01] about. But there are things I care
[1:10:03] about. And I am strongly urging you
[1:10:08] even if you heard it, even if you were
[1:10:10] here to go back and hear it again
[1:10:13] because it is perfect balance.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; It is not telling anybody you can
[1:10:18] continue in sin
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; and be under grace. That is not what
[1:10:21] he's preaching. He couldn't preach that
[1:10:23] from the word. But he's preaching to us
[1:10:26] the difference between cheap grace
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; and costly grace,
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; passive grace and active grace, powerful
[1:10:36] grace. And uh if you want to know where
[1:10:38] that theme kind of comes from, it comes
[1:10:40] from the the Bible. Number one. Number
[1:10:43] two, it comes from the message of the
[1:10:44] hour. Brother Bam said, "Have you ever
[1:10:45] met her?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know her?"
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Her name is Grace. Have you ever met
[1:10:51] her? He like the writers of old
[1:10:54] personified
[1:10:56] the the mystery of grace. He placed it
[1:10:59] with a person and with a personality
[1:11:01] because he wanted us to know that she
[1:11:04] should mean something to us.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And and you know he he
[1:11:09] stressed to us that our salvation could
[1:11:12] come in no other way than through the
[1:11:16] grace. That's the powerful grace. Hear
[1:11:18] it. Hear it. Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hear it, read it, go back to it, beat
[1:11:25] the devil with it.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; This poor uh brother has been, it's been
[1:11:33] told on him all over this nation that
[1:11:36] they don't follow the message and all
[1:11:39] kinds of lies, just lies.
[1:11:43] And uh I spoke with him for hours
[1:11:46] while he was here, multiplied hours. And
[1:11:50] there was never any suggestion,
[1:11:53] indication, hint, suspicion. I had none
[1:11:58] of that that he had left the message. In
[1:12:02] fact, I think he probably has a better
[1:12:06] embrace and handle on the message than
[1:12:09] most people I know.
[1:12:13] because it's not what they made it.
[1:12:17] So, you know,
[1:12:20] boo devil.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Lying on people. At the end of the day,
[1:12:25] what does it matter if he's going in the
[1:12:28] way of the other churches or not? That
[1:12:30] has nothing to do with truth.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to know that you should
[1:12:36] go back and hear that. And I want you to
[1:12:38] know that I found him to be an
[1:12:40] outstanding man of highest character. I
[1:12:43] delivered to him a very serious and
[1:12:45] painful word from the Lord. And I want
[1:12:47] you to know he took it like a soldier.
[1:12:50] And may God give him strength. And I I I
[1:12:54] he's made it home. They had a wonderful
[1:12:56] stop at the at the ark encounter. Is
[1:12:59] that what you call it? And then uh I he
[1:13:02] sent a picture of them pulling in there.
[1:13:05] Boy, it's a long trip.
[1:13:07] pulling in their uh garage garage
[1:13:11] uh for the weekend. Now, let's look at
[1:13:15] 126. I haven't started preaching yet.
[1:13:19] When the Lord turned again, this is
[1:13:22] 2026. Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] When the Lord turned again, the
[1:13:27] captivity of Zion,
[1:13:30] Zion is a people, remember here it says
[1:13:32] it. And Zion has been in captivity.
[1:13:36] She's not going to fall. She's a
[1:13:38] mountain. She's not coming down. She may
[1:13:42] shake, but the Lord is going to surround
[1:13:45] her. She cannot be removed, but she can
[1:13:49] be taken captive.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; When the Lord turned again the captivity
[1:13:54] of Zion, we were like them that
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; dream.
[1:14:02] This is almost like the
[1:14:03] dispensationalists
[1:14:05] who are always looking for another
[1:14:08] dispensation. You can only have so many.
[1:14:12] All right. Then was our mouth filled
[1:14:18] with laughter and our tongue
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; not with gossip.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; with singing.
[1:14:25] Then said they among the heathen,
[1:14:29] the Lord hath done
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; great things
[1:14:36] for them. Hallelujah.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; The Lord hath done great things for
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; us.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Is that about as personal as it can get?
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:14:58] Turn again
[1:15:01] our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in
[1:15:06] the south, where
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; they that sow in tears,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; shall reap what?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Enjoy.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; How? Enjoy. He that goeth forth and
[1:15:22] weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
[1:15:26] doubtless come again with rejoicing.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Bringing harvest,
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; bringing his sheav
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; He goes forth weeping over the seeds
[1:15:45] that he bears.
[1:15:49] Do you understand
[1:15:51] that's not a seed that you buy at the
[1:15:53] store and throw out of a basket? That's
[1:15:56] one that comes out of your innermost
[1:15:59] being. You're bearing a seed. You're not
[1:16:02] sewing or scattering one. It's one that
[1:16:05] is being born from the inside. He that
[1:16:08] goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious
[1:16:11] seed also re referencing tears shall
[1:16:14] doubtless come again. Come back. Return
[1:16:19] from exile.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Return from bondage. How?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; With
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; rejoiceing.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; That's not a moment of denominational
[1:16:32] praise.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; It's more than that. bringing sheav,
[1:16:40] bringing harvest, bringing lives changed
[1:16:45] with us, with them. That's the goodness
[1:16:48] of the Lord to us, isn't it?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. I'll hurry the
[1:16:54] best I know how.
[1:16:59] Turn again to the book of Judges.
[1:17:03] Chapter 16.
[1:17:06] I'm going to glance here because I want
[1:17:08] to decide where to start.
[1:17:13] Uh, someone help uh her find a seat.
[1:17:19] Judges chapter 16
[1:17:23] and let us start at
[1:17:29] 21.
[1:17:31] It's not my text, but let's just start
[1:17:34] at verse 21. But the Philistines took
[1:17:37] him
[1:17:39] and put out his eyes.
[1:17:42] I I read this week that it was a violent
[1:17:46] act of the Philistines. It was something
[1:17:49] that they did over and over again to
[1:17:52] prisoners that they took and that it was
[1:17:55] not a surgical procedure
[1:17:59] but a violent and painful act. Sometimes
[1:18:04] leaving the person brain damaged or dead
[1:18:08] because they're going in with something.
[1:18:11] Not just fingers, but going in with
[1:18:14] something. This is terrible. If the
[1:18:17] enemy is able to to take the the view,
[1:18:22] the vision, the sight, the foresight,
[1:18:26] the spiritual sight of the church. She
[1:18:30] has no idea where she should be,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; what her position should be, where she
[1:18:37] is, who she's with. She becomes
[1:18:41] extremely vulnerable to every attack of
[1:18:45] the enemy. Can you say amen?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Put put out gouged out his eyes and
[1:18:55] brought him down to Gaza and bound him
[1:18:58] with feathers of
[1:19:01] no more ropes of flax.
[1:19:06] No more
[1:19:08] ribbon rope.
[1:19:10] This was with feathers of brass.
[1:19:15] And he did grind
[1:19:18] in the prison house.
[1:19:23] And I won't even tell you the
[1:19:26] implication
[1:19:28] of what
[1:19:30] the Philistines
[1:19:32] would do to their prisoners
[1:19:37] that had nothing to do with
[1:19:41] wheat or corn or grain. This was part of
[1:19:46] the humiliation,
[1:19:48] but it was much more than this. And he
[1:19:51] did grind in the prison house.
[1:19:55] How be it, this is our hope, this is our
[1:19:57] joy, this is our potential. How be it,
[1:20:01] the hair of his head
[1:20:05] began to
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; grow again after he was
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; shaven. He didn't go from bald to head
[1:20:13] to seven locks overnight, but it began.
[1:20:19] Then the lords of the Philistines
[1:20:22] gathered them together for to offer a
[1:20:25] great sacrifice unto Deeon their god and
[1:20:29] to rejoice for they said our god little
[1:20:34] geon
[1:20:36] hath delivered Samson our enemy into our
[1:20:40] hand. They're having a praise service
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; to a false god.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Sickening.
[1:20:48] And when the people saw him, they
[1:20:51] praised their God, for they said, "Our
[1:20:54] God hath delivered into our hands our
[1:20:57] enemy, and the destroyer of our country,
[1:21:01] which slew many of us." You're right. He
[1:21:04] did, and he hasn't finished. And he was
[1:21:09] believed to be the destroyer of the
[1:21:12] Philistine people. They knew if we don't
[1:21:14] destroy him, he will surely destroy us.
[1:21:19] And it came to pass when their hearts
[1:21:21] were merry that they said, "Call for
[1:21:24] Samson." The party started before Samson
[1:21:28] was ever brought out.
[1:21:30] Call for Samson that he may make us
[1:21:35] sport. in in uh a better translation it
[1:21:39] would be that he might perform for us.
[1:21:44] Now, what kind of performing is Samson
[1:21:46] able to do? To he, I'll tell you, to
[1:21:50] stumble,
[1:21:54] to drop his head,
[1:21:57] to shuffle,
[1:21:59] to blindly grope.
[1:22:04] And the people cheered. He wasn't deaf.
[1:22:07] He could hear their mocking and their
[1:22:10] cheers. Uh they were laughing at him
[1:22:13] like he was a comedian and all he was
[1:22:16] doing was just trying to get in place.
[1:22:19] This was the entertainment as he
[1:22:21] performed for them and the performance
[1:22:23] was just you know coming as called and
[1:22:27] they called vers Samson out of the
[1:22:28] prison house and he made them sport
[1:22:32] entertainment and they set him
[1:22:36] between the pillars.
[1:22:40] Now, we know
[1:22:42] from archaeology
[1:22:45] that the temples
[1:22:49] of Deeon and other gods that the
[1:22:52] Philistines worshiped were designed such
[1:22:57] that there were always two main pillars
[1:23:02] that hold up the entirety of the roof.
[1:23:07] There are much weaker cross structures
[1:23:11] to try to hold everything in place. But
[1:23:14] the entirety of the weight of the roof,
[1:23:18] which was usually a half roof, was
[1:23:21] determined. It was strengthened only by
[1:23:24] two huge pillars with stone bases and
[1:23:30] normally cedar plank for the post.
[1:23:37] He is standing
[1:23:39] between the two pillars
[1:23:41] whereupon he said unto the lad. Verse
[1:23:45] what verse is that? 26. And Samson said
[1:23:49] unto the lad that held him by the hand,
[1:23:51] suffer me that I may fill the pillars
[1:23:54] whereupon the house standeth. And listen
[1:23:58] at this not to alert.
[1:24:02] Samson knew.
[1:24:04] The little boy knew that the whole
[1:24:07] building was held up by those two
[1:24:08] pillars.
[1:24:10] Not to alert them. He wants to lean on
[1:24:13] them. He wants to rest on them. I'm just
[1:24:17] going to take some load off. I'm going
[1:24:20] to rest a little by leaning on these
[1:24:23] pillars. But there was a whole lot more
[1:24:27] to the story than that.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] And
[1:24:33] let's go on one more verse. Now the
[1:24:36] house was full of men and women, and all
[1:24:40] the lords of the Philistines were there.
[1:24:42] And there were upon the roof
[1:24:45] about 3,000 men and women that beheld
[1:24:50] while Samson made sport.
[1:24:54] So, this was a temple
[1:24:57] that now included a um observation deck,
[1:25:03] we would call it, to be able to look
[1:25:06] over. The temple itself would have never
[1:25:09] held 3,000 men and women, but
[1:25:14] God knew exactly how to line this up.
[1:25:18] Yes, he did. And they beheld while
[1:25:22] Samson made sport. Let's get one more
[1:25:24] verse. You you you you may be seated. Go
[1:25:27] ahead. I want you to rest. Forgive me.
[1:25:29] And Samson called unto the Lord and
[1:25:33] said, "Oh Lord God, remember me." Didn't
[1:25:36] we touch that about Thanksgiving time?
[1:25:38] We did, but we're not done with it.
[1:25:40] That's why we're back here today.
[1:25:43] Oh Lord God, remember me. I pray thee.
[1:25:46] And strengthen me, I pray thee. Only
[1:25:49] this once,
[1:25:52] oh God. Brother Brandham always said,
[1:25:55] "Just once more, Lord,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; that I may be at once, at one time
[1:26:04] avenged
[1:26:07] of the Philistines for my two eyes."
[1:26:13] Should I read on? Yes.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And Samson took hold
[1:26:18] of the two middle pillars
[1:26:21] upon which the house stood and on which
[1:26:25] it was borne up, of the one with his
[1:26:29] right hand and of the other with his
[1:26:32] left hand which was about six feet
[1:26:34] apart. So he had he had quite a wingspan
[1:26:37] here
[1:26:39] to be able to wrap around the pillars.
[1:26:42] I'm just going to believe what it said.
[1:26:43] How about you?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And Samson said, "Let me die with the
[1:26:47] Philistines." And he bowed himself with
[1:26:50] all his might. It didn't matter whether
[1:26:52] he used all of his might or not. He
[1:26:53] could have not done it. It could not
[1:26:56] have been accomplished by the strength
[1:26:58] of any average man,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; but with all of his might. And the house
[1:27:02] fell upon the lords and upon all the
[1:27:06] people that were therein. So the dead
[1:27:08] which he slew at his death were more
[1:27:11] than they which he slew in his life. Now
[1:27:15] don't say
[1:27:18] suicide
[1:27:20] because that is not what Samson did.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is clear other times in
[1:27:27] the message that there is a sacrifice.
[1:27:33] This these there are many. This was a
[1:27:38] sacrifice for the cause.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; It was not a premeditated I'm going to
[1:27:44] take my life and see what happens. The
[1:27:48] Bible talks about uh thou shalt not
[1:27:52] kill.
[1:27:54] That word in Hebrew is not the word for
[1:27:58] kill. It's the word for murder.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; The scripture looks at suicide like
[1:28:05] murder.
[1:28:07] This is not what Samson did. Do you
[1:28:11] understand that?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He did kill and in turn himself. He also
[1:28:18] was killed.
[1:28:21] But to murder means without a cause. And
[1:28:24] if there ever was a cause, a man was
[1:28:27] born for a purpose to begin to deliver
[1:28:30] the children of Israel out of the hands
[1:28:33] of the Philistines. We're not living in
[1:28:36] the Old Testament. We're living in the
[1:28:38] New Testament. But there's so much we
[1:28:41] can learn from the Old Testament. So
[1:28:43] this is not suicide. I don't care how
[1:28:45] many leading ministers, Baptist
[1:28:47] ministers, denominational ministers will
[1:28:50] write long treatises about Samson
[1:28:53] committing suicide. This was not
[1:28:56] considered suicide because it was not
[1:28:59] considered murder.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; But he killed. Yes. with the same with
[1:29:04] the same inspiration
[1:29:07] that others in the Old Testament killed
[1:29:10] under the instruction of the Lord. Kill
[1:29:12] them all.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "How could a loving,
[1:29:17] gracious, merciful God instruct someone
[1:29:20] to kill?" Because in in the mind of God,
[1:29:24] killing and murder is something entirely
[1:29:27] different. You won't know that unless
[1:29:29] you look at the
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; original language.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; So someone said, "How could we celebrate
[1:29:36] Samson?" Well, he's very celebrated in
[1:29:38] Israel
[1:29:40] and other countries. By the way, one of
[1:29:42] the biggest statues of Samson is in
[1:29:44] Krakow, Poland.
[1:29:46] So he is celebrated in many nations of
[1:29:49] the world. not as someone who ended his
[1:29:52] life in defeat, but rather someone who
[1:29:55] got off course, got off track, and in
[1:29:58] the very end finished his commission
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; to begin the deliverance of the children
[1:30:03] of Israel. We can understand that in in
[1:30:06] the in the thought process of grace.
[1:30:09] We're New Testament thinkers now and
[1:30:11] we're thinking of a covenant that this
[1:30:13] would just not be the way things are
[1:30:15] done. But we have to place ourselves and
[1:30:18] remember we are just a a small few years
[1:30:23] away from the dynasty of David
[1:30:27] when Samson dies. It's only a few small
[1:30:31] years. In fact, Samson was a
[1:30:33] contemporary of uh of both uh Eli
[1:30:40] and Samuel the prophet.
[1:30:43] So, uh, being Samuel being the prophet
[1:30:46] who anointed David, Saul first, then
[1:30:51] David. So, do you see how close their
[1:30:54] lives were together? And oh my, a
[1:30:59] dynasty is about to unfold that will
[1:31:02] become an eternal kingdom.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; For there will be a king who sits upon
[1:31:06] the throne of David for all eternity.
[1:31:10] So, we're in a very pivotal time in
[1:31:13] Bible history when when the Philistines
[1:31:16] have been given 40 years over the
[1:31:20] children of Israel. And then God said,
[1:31:22] "I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready to
[1:31:26] raise up one who will begin the
[1:31:29] deliverance." So, this is a a very
[1:31:32] important period of time.
[1:31:35] I want you to look with me this morning
[1:31:37] back to the rejected king for just a
[1:31:40] moment and then we will move on. Oh yes.
[1:31:45] Paragraph 82. They wanted this king. And
[1:31:48] when they got the king, then the enemy
[1:31:51] began to put the eyes of the people out
[1:31:54] and they couldn't see where they were
[1:31:56] going. You understand who the king is,
[1:31:58] don't you? He's talking about Saul. All
[1:32:00] right.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You know this whole sermon is about a
[1:32:05] rejected king. Who is the rejected king
[1:32:07] in the sermon?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Almighty God.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; You know his his heart
[1:32:16] is broken because he is his leadership,
[1:32:20] his authority as king over this nation
[1:32:24] that he has brought so far and been so
[1:32:27] gracious to. Now, they said, "We, you
[1:32:30] know, it's been nice knowing you, king,
[1:32:32] but we'd like to have a king, one just
[1:32:35] like all the other nations."
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And they got it
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; just as crooked.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; He ended up being just as crooked,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; just as uh vulnerable to pride,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; just as human and flesh as any other
[1:32:55] king.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, they wanted a king." And
[1:32:58] when they got the king, then the enemy
[1:32:59] began to put the eyes of the people out.
[1:33:02] And then they couldn't see where they
[1:33:04] were going. That's the first thing the
[1:33:06] devil does. When he can get a servant of
[1:33:08] God, he blinds him. He blinds him to the
[1:33:13] fact that he's lost. He's lost his way.
[1:33:17] He's got off the north star.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He's no longer on the absolute
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; and he can't see it because he's lost.
[1:33:26] His eyes are put out. That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Serious business.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; He couldn't see. That's the first thing
[1:33:32] the enemy done when they got Samson,
[1:33:35] another judge. Remember, he judged
[1:33:38] Israel for 20 years. In fact, he is
[1:33:41] considered by most Bible scholars the
[1:33:45] last judge of Israel. He's definitely
[1:33:48] the last judge in the book of Judges.
[1:33:51] But there are some scholars who place
[1:33:54] both uh Eli and Samuel as a judge
[1:33:58] because of their spiritual authority.
[1:34:01] But I think we're safe to say that the
[1:34:03] judges were finished with Samson who
[1:34:06] judged Israel for 20 years. He didn't
[1:34:09] judge like the other judges.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:13] If you if you go back through those 14
[1:34:16] men, you'll find they all had a
[1:34:19] different way, a different call, if you
[1:34:22] will, of judging Israel. Some were very
[1:34:26] actively involved in solving disputes.
[1:34:30] Some were very actively involved in
[1:34:33] helping to divide the spoil.
[1:34:36] And yet there was one who came at the
[1:34:38] end who was very much involved in
[1:34:41] helping destroy the enemies of Israel.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Still a judge. Bible said so. 20 years.
[1:34:48] Come on.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Never sat on a judge's seat.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; But he was an executor
[1:34:55] of God's judgment.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; No doubt about it.
[1:35:00] Are you with me? Yes.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; He goes on, "As soon as the enemy of the
[1:35:04] Philistines came in upon Israel, let's
[1:35:07] not forget God did that.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; They put their right eye out so they
[1:35:12] couldn't see good where they were
[1:35:14] going." When the enemy comes into a
[1:35:16] church,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; when the enemy comes into a church, what
[1:35:26] does he do? He puts their eyes out to
[1:35:29] the real facts that the Holy Spirit is
[1:35:31] the one who rules
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; and governs the church.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, discipline is brought by the Holy
[1:35:39] Spirit.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I could say the words that
[1:35:44] would make it go home to the right
[1:35:47] place. See that? It never would leave.
[1:35:50] Clench it. Clinch in there. God gave the
[1:35:54] Holy Spirit to rule and govern the
[1:35:57] church. Hallelujah. He certainly did.
[1:35:59] The Holy Spirit,
[1:36:02] God deals with an individual, not with
[1:36:05] groups. We heard in the third Exodus.
[1:36:09] I want us to go on for just a moment. Uh
[1:36:13] I think we did. Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:36:16] So, let's go to paragraph 49 of Oh Lord,
[1:36:22] just once more. It must have been a
[1:36:24] lovely afternoon. Something like we're
[1:36:27] enjoying today here on the campground.
[1:36:29] Maybe we maybe we read this one. I don't
[1:36:31] remember exactly everyone we read
[1:36:34] because sometimes I I I think, well,
[1:36:36] that's redundant. I'll grab another one.
[1:36:38] And so, I didn't go back and mark them
[1:36:41] all. And I don't even care that I didn't
[1:36:43] because
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; it won't hurt us.
[1:36:47] Why do you have to read? Because I want
[1:36:49] you to know what I believe.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Want to make sure you understand.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Want to make sure all the faithful folk
[1:36:56] understand. I want to make sure all the
[1:36:58] critics understand. I want to make sure
[1:37:00] that everybody understands. We believe
[1:37:02] God sent an inspired message to us. And
[1:37:06] we use that to line up with the word.
[1:37:08] And when it lines up with the word,
[1:37:10] we're going to stand on it until we
[1:37:12] transfer
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; from this kingdom to the next. still be
[1:37:16] standing on truth way over there. Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Enjoying the day here on this campground
[1:37:21] here in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Hope that
[1:37:25] doesn't make anybody sad. And there was
[1:37:27] a great celebration going on, but very
[1:37:31] much contrary than what the celebration
[1:37:33] is today.
[1:37:36] There was about 3,000 Philistines
[1:37:38] looking down from the galleries to a
[1:37:41] strange pair that entered the great
[1:37:43] arena and highly honored warlords and
[1:37:47] their fancy jeweled deck ladies was all
[1:37:50] sitting in position. Almost sounds like
[1:37:53] a fall meeting or something.
[1:37:56] And as it was then there was oh
[1:37:59] something like a mushroom there. the
[1:38:01] buildings setting upon pillars that went
[1:38:03] out. Something like maybe a modernistic
[1:38:05] type of architecture and all these
[1:38:08] Philistines gathered up there and had
[1:38:10] placed themselves up for this great
[1:38:13] event. Brother Brandham tells us, we
[1:38:16] can't verify it through history, but he
[1:38:19] tells us there was even sacrifices going
[1:38:22] on. This is
[1:38:25] very, very pagan carrying on
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; filth.
[1:38:30] Sexuality and filth was part of the
[1:38:33] celebration. And they were in that great
[1:38:36] celebration and all eyes were centered
[1:38:40] to this middle of the arena. There must
[1:38:41] have stood up to get a better They must
[1:38:43] have stood up to get a better look at
[1:38:45] the event was just about to take place.
[1:38:51] Sounds like some kind of event, doesn't
[1:38:53] it? Go to 58.
[1:38:57] Humiliated he was. Let me double check.
[1:39:00] Yes, same sermon. Humiliated he was in
[1:39:04] the midst of the time that he lived. And
[1:39:06] I see Samson standing there, a symbol of
[1:39:09] a fallen, morally corrupted nation and a
[1:39:14] morally fallen corrupted church cuz he
[1:39:17] both symbolized listen Israel as a
[1:39:20] nation and the power of God which
[1:39:22] belongs
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; in church
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. So he represents a fallen
[1:39:28] nation and a fallen church. Sad, isn't
[1:39:31] it? It was certainly a pathetic sight as
[1:39:34] we see him stand there after all his
[1:39:36] bringing out there and this lad leading
[1:39:39] him. No eyes.
[1:39:42] If the enemy can only blind your eyes
[1:39:45] from the real thing of God, you'll walk
[1:39:48] right over the top of it
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; and not know it.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You hear him? No matter what God does
[1:39:55] and vindicates it by his scripture and
[1:39:57] proves it by his power, if your eyes are
[1:40:01] not open, oh, why can't they hear it?
[1:40:04] Why can't they believe it? Why can't
[1:40:06] they see it? Because if your eyes are
[1:40:08] not open to the things of God, you'll
[1:40:10] walk right over it as blind
[1:40:14] as you can be. Can anybody say amen?
[1:40:17] because you've seen that in your own
[1:40:20] story, how people just walk right over
[1:40:23] something that's made so clear and so
[1:40:26] plain to you. And there he stands. So it
[1:40:31] must have been a breathtaking time as
[1:40:33] these drunken soldiers and women with
[1:40:36] their cocktail glasses in their hands. I
[1:40:39] I I can hear it echo across the halls.
[1:40:42] So this is Samson, the mighty man of
[1:40:44] God, the mighty man of valor, the great
[1:40:46] warrior, standing in that condition. I'd
[1:40:50] imagine through those warriors as they
[1:40:52] stood with their arms around their
[1:40:55] modern Hollywood sweethearts, their fine
[1:40:58] tinsel jewelry dingling the members of
[1:41:01] this great church of Deon. I imagine
[1:41:04] some of them could remember by the name
[1:41:07] of Samson. His very name shook them.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; His very name brought fear upon them.
[1:41:16] For he was anointed of God. And many of
[1:41:19] them
[1:41:21] remembered it. Many of them soldiers
[1:41:22] standing there could remember seeing him
[1:41:25] standing with a jawbone of a mule in his
[1:41:27] hand. A thousand dead Philistines laying
[1:41:30] there. How could it happen when the
[1:41:33] jawbone of a mule hit one of those
[1:41:34] helmets practically an inch and a half
[1:41:37] thick of solid brass while you strike
[1:41:39] that helmet with the jawbone of a mule?
[1:41:41] That mule's jaw would fly to thousands
[1:41:44] of pieces. We read that paragraph when
[1:41:47] we were uh looking at those verses.
[1:41:50] Verse uh let's go on then to paragraph
[1:41:53] 62. They remembered seeing the jawbone
[1:41:55] in his hand and saying, "Who else wants
[1:41:58] some of this?
[1:42:04] Woo! I like it.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Who else wants some of this?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; He He's He's uh He's stirred, isn't he?
[1:42:14] He was a man who could speak. He was a
[1:42:16] man who was anointed of God. God
[1:42:18] promised to bless him. He was in the
[1:42:20] strength of Jehovah.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, no doubt. There's many here can
[1:42:25] remember back listen when the church
[1:42:28] stood in that kind of strength but now
[1:42:30] all broke up all kinds of denominations
[1:42:33] one fighting the other one the old
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; go back please the old all night prayer
[1:42:38] meetings is not heard of
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; no more you don't remember it most of
[1:42:44] you but when they put the tent up or
[1:42:46] when they put the brush arbor up they
[1:42:48] didn't ask what kind of group is this
[1:42:51] what kind of church is this they just
[1:42:54] passed down those old country roads and
[1:42:56] when they saw meetings going on, they
[1:42:58] wanted to stop and hear what was being
[1:43:00] said. Yes, sir.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; But it was shortly thereafter that they
[1:43:04] began to put, you know, official signs
[1:43:06] on everything, labels on everything,
[1:43:08] names on everything. What ended up
[1:43:12] being, it was a simple way of
[1:43:14] identifying one group of worshippers
[1:43:16] from another, but it ended up being
[1:43:18] blasphemous names. Yes.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Names that would boast of knowing a God
[1:43:23] that they didn't know.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Knowing a power that they had never
[1:43:27] experienced before. And God was not
[1:43:30] pleased with it. Anybody here?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; All kinds of denominations. One
[1:43:35] fighting.
[1:43:37] The other one, the old allight prayer
[1:43:39] meetings is not heard of no more. Let's
[1:43:41] go on. Street meetings absolutely gone.
[1:43:44] Obsolete. We We've got our structure.
[1:43:47] We've got the framework. But where is
[1:43:50] the God of miracles? Frankly, many deny
[1:43:53] it. Even denying divine healing, many.
[1:43:58] He said, "Right here in this state, I
[1:44:00] had a church man with a great church
[1:44:02] said, "I wanted to get some seats to put
[1:44:04] here in hot springs at the armory when I
[1:44:07] was here, me and brother Moore." And a
[1:44:09] Pentecostal man said, "I wouldn't even
[1:44:10] let he wouldn't let me have the seats."
[1:44:16] didn't even want to loan him the chairs.
[1:44:18] He said, "I wouldn't let anybody sit on
[1:44:20] my seats that believed in divine
[1:44:21] healing.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; What kind of not on a log is this?"
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Really, I I'm not even going to loan my
[1:44:29] seats to someone.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; I understand if you're talking about
[1:44:32] something, you know, Antichrist doctrine
[1:44:35] or something. He just believed in divine
[1:44:38] healing and the man was stingy over his
[1:44:42] seats. It's I don't know how many 10,000
[1:44:45] times worse than that today.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? No doubt about it.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; He said that that's not only here, it's
[1:44:53] everywhere. What's the matter? Prejudice
[1:44:55] because of sponsorships and other
[1:44:57] organizations forgetting that we are
[1:45:00] God's people by birth, not by what we
[1:45:03] join.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Give you the right hand of fellowship.
[1:45:07] What a joke.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] Samson had forgot that also. I'd
[1:45:14] remember he said I guess while he was
[1:45:17] standing there there was some of them
[1:45:18] remember that night at Gaza how that man
[1:45:21] could pick up the gates of Gaza lay them
[1:45:23] up on his shoulders when they tried to
[1:45:25] fence him in. Woo. You can't f listen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; You can't fence the anointing of God in.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; No organization
[1:45:39] can hold it. God saves those who he has.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, the father.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Well, they've got to hear the name
[1:45:55] Brandom. No such thing. They've got to
[1:45:57] hear the name Jesus.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[1:46:02] Lord.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's what the scripture says.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Anybody here?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 157. Still in hot springs.
[1:46:11] Notice as he stood there thinking the
[1:46:13] warlord's half drunk standing there. I
[1:46:15] remember that great person. I remember
[1:46:17] when he I encourage you to hear the
[1:46:19] whole sermon.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; He's tearing hot springs up.
[1:46:24] He said, "I remember when he stood with
[1:46:25] a jawbone of a mule in his hand. I
[1:46:27] remember when he folded up the gates of
[1:46:29] God and walked to the top of the hill. I
[1:46:31] remember all these things. What that
[1:46:32] lion roared after him, that little bitty
[1:46:34] fellow, and the spirit come upon him and
[1:46:36] he just tore the line in two with his
[1:46:38] hand and there he stands bound by a
[1:46:41] little kid leading him around."
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Listen, this was not just any ordinary
[1:46:47] kid. This was a servant boy.
[1:46:51] Do you know how these servant boys were
[1:46:54] treated in civilized cultures? Do you
[1:46:58] know how then they must have been
[1:47:00] treated in uncivilized
[1:47:02] cultures?
[1:47:07] He had no doubt never mind.
[1:47:14] He was a servant.
[1:47:17] He didn't even have his own freedom.
[1:47:21] Think about it.
[1:47:29] I'll read on in a minute.
[1:47:33] And our God, that fish god Deegon has
[1:47:36] won the victory over him. Could you show
[1:47:39] us that? Did you do you have the
[1:47:46] does anybody see anything in that that
[1:47:49] make you want to
[1:47:51] leave the god you know?
[1:47:56] They started making his head to look
[1:47:59] like Zeus
[1:48:02] because they wanted him to be the
[1:48:04] supreme of the gods.
[1:48:08] You know how God handled him.
[1:48:10] When they took him there before the ark
[1:48:12] of the covenant, don't you?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Chopped him in half, threw him on the
[1:48:16] ground, he had to bow, took his hands
[1:48:18] off.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; God was going to show him who the real
[1:48:23] God was. Let's go on. And our God, the
[1:48:26] fish god Deegon has won the victory over
[1:48:28] him. Paragraph 158. There you are. The
[1:48:30] world has creeped into the church. Has
[1:48:32] won the victory. It's undressed our
[1:48:35] women.
[1:48:41] It's undressed our women. It's put a
[1:48:44] desire in the people's heart to stay
[1:48:46] home
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; and watch television
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; instead of going to the church
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; and the
[1:48:55] love of the world has creeped in and
[1:48:58] took our Pentecostal church for a
[1:49:00] hellbound ride. Oh dear God have mercy.
[1:49:03] If you can read that and not cringe a
[1:49:05] little, I don't know what's wrong with
[1:49:07] you. I cringe because I know the glory
[1:49:11] and the power of the true genuine
[1:49:14] Pentecostal move of God. I know what God
[1:49:18] was accomplishing through a genuine
[1:49:20] outpouring of his spirit. And to think
[1:49:23] that just a short time, not even 50
[1:49:25] years later, they had already laid their
[1:49:28] head into Delila's lap, sold out the
[1:49:30] power, undressed the women.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:33] Come on, give them a Kennedy haircut
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; and moved on.
[1:49:38] It's
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; very, very serious business we're
[1:49:41] dealing with today. Now, I'm going to
[1:49:43] another one here once more. Chicago,
[1:49:47] 1963.
[1:49:49] There must have been about 3,000
[1:49:51] Philistines looking down from the top of
[1:49:54] the gallery of this great arena when the
[1:49:57] people entered the arena that afternoon.
[1:49:59] I want you to make sure you try to get a
[1:50:00] picture of this because the temple is at
[1:50:02] one end where a stage it would be like a
[1:50:05] stage of an amphitheater and then on the
[1:50:09] other side would be this gallery and
[1:50:13] above seating.
[1:50:16] So it was like a amphitheater that was
[1:50:19] you know kind of placed here at this
[1:50:22] temple and I could tell you why but it
[1:50:25] would make you vomit.
[1:50:28] what they were watching,
[1:50:31] the filth that they would come to see.
[1:50:34] No wonder God said, "I'm going to let
[1:50:37] them handle my people for 40 years, and
[1:50:39] then I'm going to deal with them like
[1:50:40] they've never been dealt with. I'm going
[1:50:42] to put a stop to some of this." There
[1:50:44] must have been about 3,000 looking down
[1:50:46] from the top of the gallery, this great
[1:50:48] arena, when the couple entered the arena
[1:50:50] that afternoon. Must have been a hot
[1:50:52] day.
[1:50:53] All day long, they had been out there.
[1:50:56] And in that great and this great company
[1:50:59] on top of this great arena that was
[1:51:00] built something on the order of an
[1:51:02] upside down mushroom and the center post
[1:51:04] in the middle that went out something
[1:51:06] this way and held the two post holding
[1:51:08] all the spectators around. Highly
[1:51:10] polished warlords
[1:51:12] and every time he says it
[1:51:15] and they're fine jeweled women. The
[1:51:18] scripture in the New Testament is clear
[1:51:21] that a woman should not adorn herself
[1:51:23] with silver, with gold,
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; pearls.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Costly array.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:30] Script.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; It's not Old Testament.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; It's New Testament church teaching
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; that the church at large has rejected.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] center post, two post holding, highly
[1:51:46] polished warlords and their finejeweled
[1:51:48] women all leaned forward at this certain
[1:51:50] event for they wanted to get a good look
[1:51:53] at what was taking place. Listen, in
[1:51:57] almost all likelihood, just let me leave
[1:51:59] this with you. I don't want to
[1:52:00] elaborate, but let me leave it. I hope
[1:52:02] I've somehow painted at least the
[1:52:04] understanding that this was a place of
[1:52:07] filth. And uh when they got through with
[1:52:10] that day, it would have been a filthy
[1:52:12] thing, ungodly sexual thing. Samson
[1:52:16] would have been horribly treated,
[1:52:20] grossly defiled.
[1:52:23] It would have been more than I would
[1:52:25] want anyone to even imagine.
[1:52:27] It was of high necessity that this thing
[1:52:31] come to an end before before the sun
[1:52:33] went down.
[1:52:34] They had preliminaries, all the
[1:52:38] entertainment. Probably had little
[1:52:39] monkeys that played little tricks, had
[1:52:41] different things that they entertained
[1:52:43] themselves with, you know, probably hot
[1:52:45] dogs and peanuts and Coca-Cas and
[1:52:47] whatever else. I was just taking a
[1:52:50] little liberty, brother. I thought I
[1:52:52] would. And they had different things
[1:52:55] that they entertained themselves with,
[1:52:56] fighting, wrestling, and and maybe
[1:52:59] dueling to death. I'm glad he didn't
[1:53:01] read a lot of the commentaries.
[1:53:07] I'm glad he just left it and many other
[1:53:09] things that they had been entertained
[1:53:11] with all day for it was a great day. But
[1:53:14] now the main event come stay with me.
[1:53:18] You know how we all wait patiently while
[1:53:20] the preliminaries are going on and they
[1:53:23] wait for the main event and that's when
[1:53:25] everybody sets up and takes notice.
[1:53:27] Sometimes sometimes so we watch it in
[1:53:31] our religious services or when we have
[1:53:33] our singing and our testimonies
[1:53:36] testimonials and the preaching and so
[1:53:38] forth. But the main event is see what
[1:53:41] the Lord is going to do.
[1:53:46] See what he has gathered us together
[1:53:48] for. We're all under anticipation to see
[1:53:51] just what the end is going to be. The
[1:53:54] main event. It's the It's that way in
[1:53:56] anything. We always watch for what?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; The main event. And they all raised up
[1:54:03] to look forward to see what was taking
[1:54:06] place because the main event
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; was being brought to them.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; And what did they see?
[1:54:15] But a blind man
[1:54:18] being led by a little boy. Not just any
[1:54:22] blind man. a champion,
[1:54:26] their enemy.
[1:54:28] The halls had echoed all afternoon with
[1:54:30] drunken revalry. How they passed the
[1:54:32] whiskey and their high drinks and fine
[1:54:36] painted up jeweled women and great
[1:54:39] dignified warlords and all. It was a
[1:54:42] great celebration. They were celebrating
[1:54:44] the victory. Oh, how I hate to say this.
[1:54:48] The victory that the fish god Deeon had
[1:54:51] got
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; over the servant of God. It just goes
[1:54:54] plumb down to the bottom of me
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; to have to say that. But it's truth.
[1:55:00] Celebrating such a way as a victory over
[1:55:04] Jehovah's servant. They do it today.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; They celebrate the fall of God's men now
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; just like they did in this pagan
[1:55:14] culture.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:17] And if they're not falling, they're
[1:55:19] lying about them.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; So nobody seems to know who to have any
[1:55:24] confidence in.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Celebrating such a way as this victory
[1:55:28] over Jehovah servant. What a shameful
[1:55:29] thing. Drinking,
[1:55:32] revalry, painted women.
[1:55:35] If you want to see where brother Random
[1:55:36] puts his makeupwearing, jeweled church
[1:55:39] world, he puts him right in there with
[1:55:41] drinking and partying and carousing.
[1:55:44] same spirit and the great dignitaries of
[1:55:48] fires was burning under the fish god and
[1:55:51] what a celebration it must have been.
[1:55:54] But the heartbreaking part as thousands
[1:55:56] of years later we have to think back of
[1:55:58] such an event as that when the great God
[1:56:00] of heaven who had purposed in his heart
[1:56:02] to destroy that nation because they were
[1:56:04] heathen
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; and had sent a man to do the job and
[1:56:08] here the fish god idol was celebrating a
[1:56:10] victory over Jehovah's servant. Jehovah
[1:56:13] what?
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Never lost the servant that he sent to
[1:56:18] do it.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Lost the victory.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't lose his call,
[1:56:27] his position, his place, his destiny.
[1:56:31] He He He lost something though,
[1:56:35] and it was important. He lost the
[1:56:40] victory. What a sight. What a shameful
[1:56:43] thing it was. The lad, the lad led the
[1:56:48] stumbling blind man across the hall to
[1:56:50] these big centerpost where on all the
[1:56:52] upside down where all the great upside
[1:56:55] down mushroom or umbrella-like set where
[1:56:58] the people looked down like this from
[1:57:00] the great palisters palasters run up and
[1:57:03] held the thing in order laid by stone
[1:57:06] that could not be reproduced again
[1:57:08] today. He's giving us quite an
[1:57:12] understanding of what this looked like.
[1:57:14] No one could build it like that. But
[1:57:16] what a great thing it was. Thousands of
[1:57:19] the celebrity priests who had served an
[1:57:23] idol with their chest all swelled out
[1:57:25] and all their ceremonies and rituals
[1:57:27] over the idol. They had conquered
[1:57:29] Jehovah. What a great day it was.
[1:57:31] Drinking, revalry, and carrying on. Did
[1:57:34] he keep saying it over and over again?
[1:57:35] Yes. Not only in this sermon, every time
[1:57:38] he mentions Samson, which I'm beginning
[1:57:40] to think he may have mentioned him more
[1:57:42] than any other Bible character as much
[1:57:45] as most any other Bible character,
[1:57:49] paragraph after paragraph after
[1:57:50] paragraph, telling the story. And if you
[1:57:53] just do a search for Samson, you won't
[1:57:55] find that. But if you go to the context
[1:57:57] of the quote, you'll find that he just
[1:57:59] kept on. It was it was meaningful to him
[1:58:02] because he felt like he was reliving it.
[1:58:05] He was seeing it again just 50 years
[1:58:07] after Pentecost.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Here comes Jehovah's servant, blind,
[1:58:13] stumbling, led by a little boy out of
[1:58:15] this great post to make sport. The main
[1:58:19] event of entertainment was to make sport
[1:58:22] out of Jehovah's ordained purpose to
[1:58:25] destroy the nation. See, you're not just
[1:58:27] mocking Samson now.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; You're mocking God.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; No wonder Samson was allowed to do what
[1:58:33] he did. Right.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And yet the nation had taken the thing
[1:58:41] that God had placed in to destroy them.
[1:58:43] And now they had conquered him and was
[1:58:45] making sport out of him. Their main
[1:58:46] event at their celebration. Brother Bam
[1:58:49] said, "Doesn't that just kill you nearly
[1:58:51] to have to look at that?
[1:58:55] to think what could.
[1:58:59] This story never really should
[1:59:05] had to be told,
[1:59:08] but it was probably told for our
[1:59:11] admonition.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Wrote that way. Humiliated, broken,
[1:59:16] standing, now defeated, right between
[1:59:19] the two post that held the building.
[1:59:23] What a symbol that is of the church of
[1:59:27] this day.
[1:59:30] What a symbol it is of a fallen race of
[1:59:33] people that is sold out into the world.
[1:59:37] And the very thing they were here, the
[1:59:40] very thing that we're here.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; I better do it again. I apologize for
[1:59:48] the stumbling. What a symbol that is of
[1:59:51] the church of this day. What a symbol it
[1:59:53] is of a fallen race of people that is
[1:59:55] sold out into the world. And the very
[1:59:57] thing that we're here to, oh God,
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; have mercy.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; We must.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; We must.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; The bride of every age was commissioned
[2:00:14] to rise above and overcome the spirit of
[2:00:16] their age.
[2:00:19] My goodness. How can they say, how can
[2:00:21] they place us way off in a millennium
[2:00:24] somewhere?
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of the age of Leodysia
[2:00:28] is stronger in this hour than it has
[2:00:30] ever been in history.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And it has not only affected the
[2:00:35] backslid denominational church, it has
[2:00:37] affected the message churches.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; The not heads.
[2:00:47] Amen. It's
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; very sad.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; I can say it and I will say it. And like
[2:00:54] I said to brother Greley in the office
[2:00:56] just before coming out, it doesn't make
[2:00:58] me feel good to say it.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; But the reality is this. The the the
[2:01:03] movement
[2:01:05] today doesn't hardly resemble
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; the movement I
[2:01:12] come among
[2:01:17] Amen.
[2:01:19] We've got to have this because the
[2:01:21] Pentecostal church down the road has
[2:01:23] this. We got to have this banquet. We
[2:01:24] got to have this festival. We got to
[2:01:26] have this. We got to do this. We got to
[2:01:27] do the other cuz we understand that
[2:01:29] they're all doing it. What is the
[2:01:31] difference? They ought to hear rejected
[2:01:33] king again. What is the difference? What
[2:01:36] do you think the king is doing when he
[2:01:38] stands out over there and hears them
[2:01:39] preach more brother Brandon than than
[2:01:41] him?
[2:01:43] doing anything.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; just looking for more ways that they can
[2:01:49] Oh, dear God, help us.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; We can't change them, but we can change
[2:01:54] ourselves.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; We can hear the cry. We can get in step.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; We can come back to the word.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; We can come back to living like we say
[2:02:03] we believe.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:06] What a symbol. What a symbol. Fallen
[2:02:08] race of people sold out of the world.
[2:02:10] And the very thing that we're here to to
[2:02:14] conquer the church sold his morals. So
[2:02:18] the Bible sold his strength. So s Yes.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Even in these ranks.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Sold our Bible.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; I've got clips. I can show you. I can
[2:02:30] show you
[2:02:32] when they say this was the absolute.
[2:02:36] I've seen it
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; until God sent this.
[2:02:44] I
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, I don't even know
[2:02:46] why you bothered to be here today.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz we've never stood for because he
[2:02:52] didn't preach that.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; That's not what he taught us.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine someone saying we we now
[2:02:59] have a higher absolute? Well, that goes
[2:03:03] right against the whole premise of the
[2:03:05] message absolute. That's right.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; He kept saying things like, "You can
[2:03:08] only have one."
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Well, they say, "Yeah, that's right.
[2:03:13] That's why we know what it is." Well, I
[2:03:15] can show you so many times.
[2:03:20] Wouldn't take long or at least 300 times
[2:03:23] I have documented. I can show you at
[2:03:26] least that many times where it hasn't
[2:03:28] risen above the absolute.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing to make statements
[2:03:34] like that.
[2:03:36] Because we're all human. We're all
[2:03:38] flesh. We can all make mistakes.
[2:03:41] Sometimes I misspeak and I uh uh I don't
[2:03:44] see it until I'm home. Well, don't what
[2:03:45] what good does it do me know when I'm
[2:03:47] home? Well, you could come the next time
[2:03:50] and and say you you you know put the
[2:03:53] wrong name in the story or something. I
[2:03:56] I could if I remembered, right?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; But I can't always even remember to go
[2:04:01] back and do that. So, we we give lots of
[2:04:03] grace. I hope you do
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; because there are so many distractions
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; that so I I I think about brother
[2:04:13] Brandham, brother Green telling me that
[2:04:16] brother Brandham really had this burning
[2:04:18] on his heart, this message rapture
[2:04:22] and all the distractions.
[2:04:25] And finally, Brother Green just started
[2:04:27] waving money around. He said, "If you'll
[2:04:28] just leave us alone and just go out and
[2:04:31] give us a few more minutes." He said,
[2:04:32] "There's more $100 bills where those
[2:04:34] come from. We have got to hear what what
[2:04:38] he has on his heart to say to us." And
[2:04:40] and we're sorry that we didn't realize
[2:04:42] we we didn't realize that we were going
[2:04:45] against the policy and we had to let
[2:04:48] people come and start clearing the
[2:04:51] plates and cleaning up while the
[2:04:53] preacher is still preaching. We we
[2:04:55] didn't understand. And and so you can
[2:04:59] hear him stumble
[2:05:01] because he was a human.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's why we have one north star.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we have one absolute so that
[2:05:12] we can always come back as our tiepost
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; to that.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; You'll never be disappointed.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; You'll never be disappointed. You may
[2:05:23] find that it could have been translated,
[2:05:26] you know, to a little more modern
[2:05:27] English. Yes. And sometimes when they do
[2:05:29] that, they water down the meaning. Now,
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; so you you you got to decide, do you
[2:05:35] want easier flow or do you want to try
[2:05:38] to hold to the meaning, the best meaning
[2:05:39] of something? So, but it's our absolute.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; It's a written record of a living word.
[2:05:45] We better hold on to it. All right,
[2:05:47] enough of that. Enough of that.
[2:05:50] The church sold his moral, sold the
[2:05:52] Bible, sold his strength, so surrendered
[2:05:55] its sword.
[2:05:56] And standing humiliated in the hour when
[2:05:58] the approaching signs of the coming of
[2:06:00] Jesus Christ is at hand, when she ought
[2:06:02] to be washed, not a spot or a wrinkle,
[2:06:05] standing, oh Jesus,
[2:06:09] standing to receive her bridegroom.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what it's all about? Yes.
[2:06:16] What a picture we see here. You're a
[2:06:18] symbol of moral decay that rest upon the
[2:06:20] nation. This nation, I'm not going to
[2:06:23] try to stay with my scriptures too long
[2:06:25] so I can get through quick. But I could
[2:06:28] symbolize that with the church, with the
[2:06:30] nation, with politics, with everything
[2:06:32] you can put your hands on today. Besides
[2:06:34] God's Bible, besides God's Bible,
[2:06:37] morally decayed, human race itself,
[2:06:39] terrible condition, and they're under
[2:06:42] the atheist
[2:06:44] and unbelievers that can point their
[2:06:46] finger into the face of the church who
[2:06:47] should have the message for today and
[2:06:50] asking them, "What does all this mean?"
[2:06:51] And they listen, the church. And they
[2:06:54] don't have the answer.
[2:07:01] They don't have the answer. Why? They
[2:07:03] did like Samson did.
[2:07:06] They still hoop.
[2:07:09] They still holler.
[2:07:12] But they did like Samson. They've
[2:07:14] surrendered
[2:07:15] because if they let the Holy Ghost
[2:07:18] manifest himself in the gifts of the
[2:07:19] spirit in a pure way. I don't mean
[2:07:22] exhortation.
[2:07:24] There is no in the nine gifts of the
[2:07:26] spirit. There is not a gift of
[2:07:28] exhortation.
[2:07:31] That doesn't mean that you can't be
[2:07:32] gifted for exhortation. You certainly
[2:07:35] can, but it's not one of the nine gifts
[2:07:37] of the spirit and shouldn't be treated
[2:07:38] as though it was one of the nine gifts
[2:07:40] of the spirit. They're listed there.
[2:07:43] Their function is listed there. And if
[2:07:45] brother Brandham said anything about the
[2:07:46] gifts of the spirit beyond what Paul
[2:07:48] said, you would have to go back to what
[2:07:51] Paul said. He said so.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I preach anything other
[2:07:57] than what the first church age messenger
[2:07:59] preached, it's a cursed."
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; So, you can keep your little quotes. I
[2:08:08] know. I get them.
[2:08:13] They've surrendered.
[2:08:18] Paragraph 51 of Oh Lord, just once more.
[2:08:20] How much time do I have? I have a little
[2:08:22] more time. Good. I'm going to use it to
[2:08:24] read.
[2:08:28] Well, I didn't come here for reading.
[2:08:29] Well, if you heard it yourself,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be real clear with you this
[2:08:34] morning. There are many of us who don't
[2:08:37] we have we have seven days out of the
[2:08:39] week and there are many of us who claim
[2:08:41] that this is what we believe and we
[2:08:43] don't even hear his voice in the course
[2:08:45] of of a week.
[2:08:50] Well, didn't you just say it's Jesus?
[2:08:51] Sure. Sure it is. It's Jesus for the
[2:08:54] world. No doubt about it. He came to
[2:08:58] seek and to save that which was lost.
[2:09:00] But I'm putting on a I'm trying to put
[2:09:03] on the overcomer's garment.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; And and the only way to overcome is to
[2:09:07] know what you've got to overcome.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; And and this message, boy, gives me such
[2:09:15] an outline of what I got to get up
[2:09:17] above.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 51. Oh Lord, just once more
[2:09:21] back to hot springs.
[2:09:24] And now as we sit here this afternoon,
[2:09:26] let's see if we can with imaginary mind
[2:09:28] place oursel in that position to look at
[2:09:31] this scene coming moving out of the
[2:09:32] center of the arena. Come a little boy
[2:09:35] holding the hand of a blind man
[2:09:37] stumbling, staggering along. They had
[2:09:39] monkey shows, little tricks and so
[2:09:41] forth. But now has arrived the time for
[2:09:43] the main event, the thing they'd waited
[2:09:44] for on so long. The main event of the
[2:09:46] day, preliminaries were over. halls that
[2:09:49] echoed all afternoon with drunken rey
[2:09:51] for they were celebrating the victory.
[2:09:53] Is it Did we just read those?
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we did skip some there, didn't we?
[2:09:58] Yes. Good. Here's the fill in. We We
[2:10:00] skipped down to 58. Now we're filling
[2:10:02] in. Coming
[2:10:04] uh for I'll get it. For they were
[2:10:06] celebrating the victory of Deegon, their
[2:10:08] fish god over the ark and the promise of
[2:10:11] Jehovah.
[2:10:15] The reverse. What a disgraceful sight
[2:10:19] it is. As we can imagine such a thing
[2:10:21] taking place. The fish god of a heathen
[2:10:24] nation celebrating the victory over the
[2:10:26] servants of Jehovah. All because of the
[2:10:29] failure of the man. Oh dear Lord.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; All because of the failure of the man
[2:10:36] to carry out the things that he had been
[2:10:41] ordained
[2:10:44] to do.
[2:10:46] And here was a heathen drunken brawling
[2:10:48] out jeweled women painted faces modern
[2:10:51] Hollywood celebration bringing the
[2:10:53] servant of the Lord God bound in
[2:10:55] shackles for the main event of the
[2:10:57] afternoon. The lad
[2:11:00] must have drugg along there stumbling
[2:11:03] this great mass of human flesh. Both
[2:11:05] eyes out hair hanging down his back tied
[2:11:08] and bound to make entertainment for a
[2:11:11] drunken brawling bunch of unbelievers.
[2:11:13] He must have stumbled to the post where
[2:11:16] they were going to make the fun start
[2:11:20] from.
[2:11:21] When I think of that, I think about a
[2:11:23] church that was ordained of God to do
[2:11:26] something for God and it suffered the
[2:11:28] enemy to blind its eyes from the word of
[2:11:34] the living God.
[2:11:38] I want to read this for those of you who
[2:11:39] seem to hate the Old Testament and the
[2:11:43] commandments
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; of God
[2:11:47] and to the task that it was ordained of
[2:11:50] God to do
[2:11:56] only to be sport in a hiding place for
[2:11:59] drunken Here we go again. Painted face,
[2:12:03] jeweled deck, shortwearing, bobbed hair.
[2:12:07] Women and men. Oh my.
[2:12:11] Not just the women's sorryiness.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Men too.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Showing your ugly knobby knees to the
[2:12:22] world around you.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; A church that ought to be shining in the
[2:12:28] power and the strength of the Lord.
[2:12:31] What a disgrace.
[2:12:34] How humiliating it must have been for
[2:12:36] Samson with all of his framework made up
[2:12:40] that was more than able and it proved
[2:12:42] God had his strength through his
[2:12:44] framework and every muscle that he ever
[2:12:46] had still was in his body.
[2:12:50] Oh my, everything is in place.
[2:12:56] The top five are booked for the fall
[2:12:59] meeting.
[2:13:03] The menu is determined.
[2:13:07] Every framework is in place. I scratched
[2:13:10] his back in the spring. He'll come and
[2:13:14] scratch mine in the fall.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; An old good old buddy system
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; has invaded the church.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt about it.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to be so critical this
[2:13:29] morning. I'll be glad to be off of this.
[2:13:31] But but but here's the reality. Because
[2:13:34] I listen,
[2:13:36] you don't have to guess what they're
[2:13:37] going to preach.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a variation of the same
[2:13:44] 10 sermons.
[2:13:47] Year after year after year, you're going
[2:13:51] to hear the same out of tune singers
[2:13:59] sing the same songs
[2:14:02] that do not sometimes even line up with
[2:14:06] the word.
[2:14:09] Everything in place.
[2:14:13] Framework all there.
[2:14:18] Sunrise
[2:14:19] service
[2:14:22] all planned.
[2:14:24] Every detail,
[2:14:26] the framework, the muscle still there.
[2:14:30] But the blessings
[2:14:34] of the Lord,
[2:14:36] he was still like Saul, the anointed,
[2:14:41] the chosen,
[2:14:43] but the blessings of the Lord
[2:14:47] had left him.
[2:14:54] This is serious.
[2:14:57] We may have all of our framework. We may
[2:14:59] have our denominational rituals. I just
[2:15:02] named some of them. We may have our
[2:15:04] names in the papers and on the ledgers,
[2:15:06] but I wonder today if the Pentecostal
[2:15:08] church isn't standing about the same
[2:15:09] place, its eyes poked out from the word
[2:15:12] of God. And for the purpose that Jesus
[2:15:15] died, that we together could fellowship
[2:15:20] around the word
[2:15:25] and
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; the things of God.
[2:15:33] Are you still here?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Good. I'm getting a lot of notes out of
[2:15:38] the way.
[2:15:41] Couldn't you just condense them?
[2:15:44] I tried.
[2:15:48] 1963, same sermon, same theme once more.
[2:15:53] New York, New York. I'm telling you,
[2:15:55] from Hot Springs, Arkansas to Chicago,
[2:15:57] Illinois to New York, New York. They had
[2:16:00] no excuse.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; He was indicting
[2:16:06] the outcome of Pentecost.
[2:16:09] Paragraph 59, New York. What a sad
[2:16:11] sight. Must have been a hot afternoon.
[2:16:14] Sunshining, great celebration. 3,000
[2:16:17] felistings looked down the galleries of
[2:16:18] the stadium as the pair entered. High
[2:16:21] honored warlords, finejeweled ladies
[2:16:23] lean forward to get a good look. And the
[2:16:26] boy and the boy led this blind man.
[2:16:31] The halls had echoed all afternoon with
[2:16:32] drunken revalry, celebrating, here's
[2:16:34] what hurts me, celebrating the victory
[2:16:36] of their fish, God day over Jehovah's
[2:16:38] servant. What a disgrace. What a thing
[2:16:40] had happened. The man had failed. Not
[2:16:42] God had not failed.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; And what Jehovah must have been thinking
[2:16:47] as he looked down and see all this going
[2:16:49] on. Drunken conglomeration of women half
[2:16:52] stripped
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Finejweled.
[2:16:59] You know, I should have at least one big
[2:17:02] diamond.
[2:17:03] Fine jeweled and decorated and fixed up.
[2:17:08] their drunken husbands drinking,
[2:17:10] celebrating to a god, a fish god, an
[2:17:14] idol that had took the victory over
[2:17:15] Jehovah's sermon. That's pretty sad.
[2:17:20] Still in New York 101. But now he stands
[2:17:22] hopeless.
[2:17:24] All stripped of power.
[2:17:27] It's the same thing now. The church
[2:17:30] stands the same way where once the
[2:17:32] church used to cast out devils. The
[2:17:34] church used to raise up the dead. The
[2:17:36] church used to do the things that Jesus
[2:17:38] did. Sin. Oh God, help us.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody say us.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:17:59] Be careful.
[2:18:05] Sin could not dwell among them. The Holy
[2:18:07] Spirit came in and condemned it. If a
[2:18:10] man done something secretly and belonged
[2:18:12] to this Christian group, as soon as he
[2:18:14] come in, the Holy Spirit revealed his
[2:18:16] sin. and he either repented or perished.
[2:18:20] But you see, we don't have it no more.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; And they won't receive it no more. And
[2:18:27] when it does come, they try to call it
[2:18:28] an evil spirit
[2:18:31] that they might receive that much more
[2:18:34] condemnation.
[2:18:36] Something has to condemn them. Notice
[2:18:40] strip of power. What must have went
[2:18:41] through the man's mind? Once that kind
[2:18:43] of a warrior and now a little boy has to
[2:18:45] lead him around. Why? He's blind. He
[2:18:48] can't see. He has nothing to see with.
[2:18:53] The reality is if Samson would have
[2:18:55] lived another 20 years, he would have
[2:18:57] still had to depend on somebody.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; To lead him around.
[2:19:05] God have mercy upon us. The church is so
[2:19:08] denominated and so far away till the
[2:19:10] devil is poked out the eyesight, the
[2:19:12] spiritual side. They don't even
[2:19:14] understand. sitting right here this
[2:19:16] morning, sitting right in this church,
[2:19:18] they don't even understand the hour that
[2:19:20] we're living in.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; They don't understand the vicious cycle
[2:19:25] that they have refused to break out of.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:33] If it's a cycle, it means they're doing
[2:19:35] the same thing.
[2:19:42] Still slided. still sly.
[2:19:53] This is the word of God, not a creed.
[2:19:55] It's the word and God is duty bound to
[2:19:57] produce air. Lie. They still lie.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Stop lying.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:07] If you find that you are in a cycle of
[2:20:12] lying
[2:20:14] and you don't even know why when it's
[2:20:15] over,
[2:20:17] you need more than a New Year's
[2:20:20] resolution.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; You need a mighty deliverance. And the
[2:20:26] mighty deliverer is available to you if
[2:20:30] you will call on him.
[2:20:35] Not a creed. It's the word. And God is
[2:20:39] duty bound to produce everything that he
[2:20:40] promised in this Bible.
[2:20:43] Way we believe. You haven't got no
[2:20:46] belief coming. If it's contrary to this,
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; the mind of Christ in you. You believe
[2:20:51] the things that Christ wrote because
[2:20:53] this is Christ the word. But look at the
[2:20:55] condition. Look at the parallel. When we
[2:20:58] see that it would be wrong of me to
[2:21:01] stand here
[2:21:04] uh
[2:21:05] 73, 83, 93, 2003, 2013,
[2:21:11] 2023,
[2:21:14] 63
[2:21:16] years later. And not mentioned
[2:21:20] that even a remnant who came out because
[2:21:24] of these messages of truth, many of them
[2:21:30] have found themselves
[2:21:32] back in the condition that they were in
[2:21:36] in the beginning and have never
[2:21:39] acknowledged it.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; They took the gifts off the floor. They
[2:21:45] stuffed them in a back room and now
[2:21:48] they've put them entirely out of the
[2:21:49] church.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean gifts that just come to
[2:21:52] say an encouraging word. That's the kind
[2:21:54] we flock to hear.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; I mean the kind that come and say, "I'm
[2:21:58] about to send the waters of separation
[2:22:00] through this house." And you think now
[2:22:02] you know on which side someone will
[2:22:05] stand, but you may be surprised.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about that kind of a gift.
[2:22:10] One that says, "Go ahead. Brace
[2:22:12] yourself. Prepare yourself because some
[2:22:14] real times are coming.
[2:22:19] Ananas,
[2:22:22] you you'll figure it out. You'll figure
[2:22:24] it out before it's over. Uh why somebody
[2:22:27] is stirred up about it. Why somebody's
[2:22:30] disturbed about it?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Because we don't want anybody to pack
[2:22:34] you out of here.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Is that too rough to say?
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Well, it ain't nearly as rough
[2:22:42] as I said it in the 90s.
[2:22:47] The mind of Christ and you you got to
[2:22:49] believe the things Christ wrote cuz but
[2:22:52] look the parallel. We must have went
[2:22:54] through his we must have went through
[2:22:56] his mind. Let's see what went through
[2:22:58] his mind. We see what went through the
[2:23:01] Lord's warlord's mind of the fear that
[2:23:04] they once had of his name. They were
[2:23:07] scared to do anything. They just
[2:23:09] mentioned Samson. Everybody was gone
[2:23:13] because there he was saying, "You want
[2:23:15] some of this?" But now standing a victim
[2:23:18] under Deegon, the fish god. Oh, they
[2:23:21] must have had a big time. A Jew that
[2:23:24] despised idols was standing a victim
[2:23:26] under one because he had failed. God
[2:23:30] Samson standing there. No doubt. Let's
[2:23:33] search his mind for about three or four
[2:23:35] minutes. Let's do it.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; You willing?
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am. He must have thought of all
[2:23:39] the victories he had. There he stands,
[2:23:42] what he had done, how the Lord had
[2:23:43] blessed him. How that he once was a
[2:23:45] great man as long as he was in the
[2:23:47] kingdom of God, keeping the promise of
[2:23:48] God, how he was one of the right-hand
[2:23:50] men,
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; how everything revolved around him. Now
[2:23:54] notice, he had thought of all his
[2:23:56] victories and then there must have went
[2:23:58] through his mind how he had failed God's
[2:24:01] people.
[2:24:03] It ought to be a shame to a minister
[2:24:04] that will sit and read this Bible, then
[2:24:06] walk out before his people. The world is
[2:24:08] full of lots.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that the sins of Sodom
[2:24:13] vexed his righteous
[2:24:16] soul.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; But he didn't have the courage to stand
[2:24:21] up and rebuke that sin.
[2:24:24] And there is many men today in my my
[2:24:27] absolute favorite punctuation
[2:24:32] dot dot dot
[2:24:35] and I say this with reverence only with
[2:24:37] with love but just to say truth we may
[2:24:40] never meet again. There's many man that
[2:24:44] reads this same Bible that we read sits
[2:24:46] in his office preparing his message and
[2:24:48] run upon these truths of God and have to
[2:24:51] bypass them. He would be afraid to
[2:24:54] preach against the women cutting their
[2:24:55] hair. His organization would turn him
[2:24:57] out.
[2:25:00] That's why the Jacksonites came along
[2:25:02] with you can cut it as long as you cut
[2:25:04] it an inch at a time.
[2:25:08] And now if you take a big look around,
[2:25:11] there is no hair. I see them. They're
[2:25:13] dying in New Brunswick like flies
[2:25:16] because the old-timers are getting
[2:25:18] older.
[2:25:20] they're passing away. And they took that
[2:25:23] doctrine of Raymond Jackson and uh
[2:25:27] inched it at a time until there was
[2:25:29] none.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; It started to turn white and they didn't
[2:25:33] want it to look yellow. So they started
[2:25:35] blue blue tinting it.
[2:25:41] So we lived for 15 years with
[2:25:44] blue-haired women in the message.
[2:25:49] And now all of a sudden, suddenly after
[2:25:53] 40 years, it's black again, brown again.
[2:25:58] It's the oddest looking thing. It's
[2:26:01] going to be quiet,
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; but it's the oddest looking thing to me.
[2:26:04] all these wrinkles like the like the
[2:26:07] like the tributaries of the Grand Canyon
[2:26:11] and and black jet
[2:26:17] bottled
[2:26:18] hairdo.
[2:26:20] You see what happens?
[2:26:25] I wish wherever whoever has him would
[2:26:27] send him back
[2:26:29] and let him tell him, "No, no, no, no,
[2:26:31] no, no, no. Leave it be. It's your glory
[2:26:34] on the top of your head. It's a sign of
[2:26:36] your submission to your husband. It's a
[2:26:39] sign of his authority over you and God's
[2:26:42] authority over the both of you. Leave it
[2:26:44] alone.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; A message so strong that even the
[2:26:49] Baptist preached it
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; for several hundred years.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Until they couldn't anymore.
[2:27:01] So, it wasn't that God was not giving it
[2:27:04] to them. If he ever gave them the sermon
[2:27:06] in the first place, he must have still
[2:27:08] been giving it to them, but they
[2:27:09] couldn't preach it
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; because the people wanted to do it.
[2:27:15] Their wives,
[2:27:17] somebody go get the delivery.
[2:27:22] Not you. Not you. There's people in the
[2:27:24] back.
[2:27:27] Thank you for being willing.
[2:27:32] It's a sad thing. They couldn't preach
[2:27:35] it because their wives wanted to do it.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; And these silly questions and answers.
[2:27:45] God, you know, sent a messenger to
[2:27:49] turn hearts and on and on and on, a
[2:27:52] message of restoration. And they start
[2:27:54] asking these silly questions. What about
[2:27:56] fingernails? Well, I guess if you don't
[2:27:58] have some, you could put some on.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Really?
[2:28:04] Have you ever seen anybody that didn't
[2:28:06] have any? Not not not
[2:28:08] average. Not average.
[2:28:12] I could tell you the funny stories about
[2:28:15] toenails.
[2:28:18] But I won't
[2:28:22] cuz they'll sure rip them off if you
[2:28:24] keep having trouble. And you you look
[2:28:25] you look like a funny thing. been. So,
[2:28:28] I've never seen anybody didn't have any
[2:28:29] fingernails. I mean, some people bite
[2:28:33] them down to the quick.
[2:28:35] So, do you really think the Holy Ghost
[2:28:37] is leading somebody to go put on plastic
[2:28:40] ones? I don't think so either.
[2:28:44] And then, well, what about you know,
[2:28:48] woman pay? Well, I guess if she didn't
[2:28:49] have any color. Listen, that's what CM
[2:28:52] Ward,
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; that was the radio preacher of the
[2:28:56] Assembly of God. That's what he said 50
[2:28:58] years ago. I guess if an old barn didn't
[2:29:00] have paint, you could go put another
[2:29:02] paint. Now, to think that we have almost
[2:29:04] the same kind of quote in the message,
[2:29:06] just a little cleaner.
[2:29:11] And now look at them.
[2:29:14] They look dusty.
[2:29:22] Is that really so wrong? I I have a
[2:29:24] feeling that the reason why it is
[2:29:28] is because it is a reflection of a
[2:29:32] bigger problem,
[2:29:34] a heart problem,
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; a heart issue. Now, I don't mean a
[2:29:39] woman, she has a little pimple or
[2:29:41] something and but you've got to be so
[2:29:44] careful because you know here's one,
[2:29:47] there's one, there's one, there's one,
[2:29:48] there's one.
[2:29:55] That's what they used to call holiness
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; preaching. The critics called it
[2:30:00] closline preaching.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; The believers called it holiness
[2:30:04] preaching, separation preaching.
[2:30:09] You just got to be so careful. You mean
[2:30:11] even now in 2026? So careful
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; because the enemy will fool you.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I guess if she didn't have any
[2:30:18] eyebrows, I mean, I guess she could.
[2:30:23] And so now they go from brows to lashes
[2:30:27] and they buy them and they look like
[2:30:28] spiders. And it's not just the
[2:30:30] African-American people. It's a it's the
[2:30:33] white man and and every man and
[2:30:37] They all have to look you I I've been at
[2:30:40] red lights
[2:30:41] and look over and have to
[2:30:46] I say a normal woman to be slapping her
[2:30:48] face
[2:30:51] because it looks like tarantulas
[2:30:53] or sleeping on her eyelashes on her
[2:30:56] eyelids.
[2:30:57] It it it doesn't stop. It just go go go.
[2:31:00] Dresses get tighter. Slits get higher.
[2:31:03] I'm going to tell you how I preached it
[2:31:05] for many, many years. Your uh uh skirt
[2:31:08] and your dress length ends at the top of
[2:31:11] your slit.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Not at the bottom of it. At the top of
[2:31:16] it. So, if you shoot it all the way up
[2:31:18] your thigh, you you are wearing a
[2:31:19] miniskirt to me.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it touches the ankles.
[2:31:24] If it's got a split that goes all the
[2:31:25] way up when you walk, it shows the very
[2:31:27] thing that the Bible says that a man
[2:31:30] shouldn't show it while he's doing the
[2:31:32] service of the Lord.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; And if a man shouldn't show his legs on
[2:31:37] the approach to the altar,
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Are these salvation issues? I'm not in
[2:31:44] any way trying to make them that, but
[2:31:46] they are reflective of the heart.
[2:31:54] Woo! They're shouting, "Run in the
[2:31:55] aisles."
[2:31:57] The same God who says that a woman
[2:32:00] should have long hair as her covering
[2:32:03] says, "Even nature itself teaches you
[2:32:07] that it is a shame
[2:32:10] for a man to have long hair."
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; I dare somebody to ask me how long it
[2:32:14] is. You know, you know, brothers, you
[2:32:18] know, I have sons that know. I have
[2:32:22] church people that know. You know,
[2:32:28] I hear uh preachers preach against it
[2:32:31] when it's turned up on their collar.
[2:32:34] And I'm thinking, well, what's wrong
[2:32:35] then? Ponytail. You got to have a
[2:32:37] ponytail. No. If you're going to preach
[2:32:41] it, you you must be an example of it.
[2:32:44] whether you look good or not.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to keep mine as short as I
[2:32:48] can because I want to be able to say
[2:32:51] exactly what the word says. Nature tells
[2:32:54] us nature. You don't even need the Holy
[2:32:57] Ghost.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Just the very nature of men and women.
[2:33:02] Something on the inside will teach you.
[2:33:05] I'm not against a woman who feels that
[2:33:07] she needs to wear a head covering. I It
[2:33:09] does not offend me. It has never
[2:33:12] offended me. But if she chops it off so
[2:33:15] that she can cover it up with a rag, I
[2:33:18] am 100% against that.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; And that's what messed up.
[2:33:26] That's what messed up what we had in
[2:33:29] this area
[2:33:32] because you keep putting something on
[2:33:34] top putting a prayer uh cover veil or
[2:33:39] whatever you might call it because they
[2:33:42] get they get so now till it's just a
[2:33:44] band. I saw it. You saw it just a band
[2:33:46] of something. You see all the hair
[2:33:48] except just a band of something. Is does
[2:33:50] that qualify?
[2:33:54] The Bible said a woman's long hair is
[2:33:56] given her for a covering, but I don't
[2:33:58] mind,
[2:34:04] but you better stay with it.
[2:34:07] It's not that that testifies of the
[2:34:11] authority and power that's on your head.
[2:34:13] It's it's it's how long it's what's
[2:34:14] tucked under it.
[2:34:17] They tried to get that going through
[2:34:19] here one time. Do you remember
[2:34:24] I've pulled one in
[2:34:27] some years ago to my office and I said,
[2:34:29] "You better get a hold of that daughter
[2:34:30] of yours. She had better not look at my
[2:34:33] son one more time
[2:34:37] because I've got a feeling
[2:34:41] this is not going to stand.
[2:34:45] You can't cut it off and cover it with a
[2:34:48] cloth and think you're under submission
[2:34:51] to anything
[2:34:53] except man's some kind of man idea.
[2:34:55] Anybody still here?
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; So, leave it alone. Cover it if you
[2:34:59] will. If you don't, don't. But keep it
[2:35:02] long.
[2:35:04] And And I don't have any If you think
[2:35:06] that I do, I don't I don't mind a bit.
[2:35:08] It's up to however that family feels and
[2:35:11] that person feels, I wouldn't care. It
[2:35:13] wouldn't hurt my feelings. It wouldn't
[2:35:15] upset me. It wouldn't bother me. I don't
[2:35:18] care how plain somebody wants to dress.
[2:35:21] I don't care how modest somebody wants
[2:35:23] to dress. I have said that before. Make
[2:35:25] sure. Let me say that again. If if
[2:35:28] anybody in this church puts pressure on
[2:35:30] anybody else to wear the style they wear
[2:35:34] or or the pattern they wear or the way
[2:35:36] they think they ought to wear it, you
[2:35:37] let me know
[2:35:41] because that's none of their business to
[2:35:43] do that. I don't care.
[2:35:48] Brother Green had anything from leather
[2:35:51] skirt.
[2:35:52] I saw it in the 90s to a
[2:35:57] to Sister
[2:35:59] Miles and Sandre with denim to the
[2:36:01] ground and rolled up sleeves. And he
[2:36:05] said, "I'm not going and you better not
[2:36:07] say nothing to them either. Let
[2:36:09] everybody have their standard. Just
[2:36:11] don't let yours be lower than what's
[2:36:13] preached from this desk
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; because you have an obligation then."
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; You don't go to Sam's and do it your way
[2:36:20] or Walmart or anywhere else.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; You want to be a part of something, you
[2:36:24] have a obligation. Anybody with me?
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; My I'm getting hungry now.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; I've worked. I'm I'm not I'm not either.
[2:36:35] Just kidding. I'm I'm almost done. 1:30.
[2:36:39] Let's have church tonight and I'll
[2:36:40] preach another two or three hours.
[2:36:43] All right, I'm coming back to this. Woo.
[2:36:45] Where are we? Hallelujah.
[2:36:47] A Jew that despised idols.
[2:36:51] Uh he had failed. Got rid of the
[2:36:53] promise. There he stands. Where was I?
[2:36:55] Anybody remember? Oh, there we go.
[2:36:57] There's many men that reads the same
[2:36:58] Bibles we read in his office, preparing
[2:37:01] his message, run upon these truths of
[2:37:03] God, have to bypass them. He would be
[2:37:05] afraid to preach against the women
[2:37:06] cutting their hair. His organization
[2:37:08] would turn him out about them wearing
[2:37:10] immoral clothes and committed spiritual
[2:37:13] adultery. Spiritual adultery.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and about the man that takes a
[2:37:18] sociable drink on Christmas and gets out
[2:37:21] and has a little clean America fun,
[2:37:23] tells dirty jokes, still maintains the
[2:37:25] office as deacon.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; They know those things are wrong.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; You don't need a Bible or a preacher in
[2:37:38] 2026 to tell you they're wrong.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; But they're as it was in the days of
[2:37:43] Lot. We are back to that sinful place
[2:37:46] again. See,
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; you say, "What are you preaching that in
[2:37:49] here for?" Because it goes beyond here.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; And you and I need to hear it, too.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, how Samson must have reminded by
[2:37:57] must have been reminded by the Holy
[2:37:58] Spirit that how he had failed God's
[2:38:00] people and failed God himself. Now he's
[2:38:02] a prisoner. Oh, dear Lord. Now he is a
[2:38:06] prisoner of the very thing that God Oh,
[2:38:10] dear Lord. Are you dramatic? I am I feel
[2:38:14] very dramatic now. He's a prisoner of
[2:38:17] the very thing that God raised him up
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; and gave him power
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; now. He's enslaved.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; No wonder Brother Brandham tells us,
[2:38:32] "You better destroy that thing before it
[2:38:33] destroys you."
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, how Samson must have been reminded
[2:38:37] by the Holy Spirit how he failed God's
[2:38:39] people and had failed God himself. And
[2:38:41] now he's a prisoner of the very thing
[2:38:42] that God raised him up and give him
[2:38:45] power to destroy. A and I'm a member.
[2:38:49] I'm in this with you. Not a member of an
[2:38:50] organization. God forbid. But I'm a
[2:38:52] member by grace in the body of Christ.
[2:38:54] I'm your brother. I have no selfish
[2:38:56] motive motives. My motive to achieve
[2:38:59] anything personally. I'm only zealous
[2:39:01] for the Lord God. And I say this with
[2:39:03] all my heart. The very thing that you
[2:39:04] were called out of, you've gone back
[2:39:07] into it again. And as the Bible said, a
[2:39:11] s goes to her wallow, a dog returns to
[2:39:13] his vomit. And if the vomit made the dog
[2:39:16] sick in the first place, won't it make
[2:39:18] him
[2:39:22] and watch what he says?
[2:39:26] It's a greater
[2:39:29] sin.
[2:39:32] Somebody said, "I don't find that in the
[2:39:33] Bible." Oh, yes you do.
[2:39:35] If I build again the things that I once
[2:39:37] tore down, I make myself a transgressor.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; Now, that's according to the scripture.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's not things that you said on one
[2:39:45] of your whims
[2:39:47] or one of your religious fits.
[2:39:51] That's what you said that was according
[2:39:53] to the scripture because I've had the
[2:39:56] fits
[2:39:58] just like you've had the fits. And you
[2:40:00] God is not going to hold you responsible
[2:40:03] to a fit.
[2:40:05] Thank you, Lord.
[2:40:07] But he will hold you responsible to his
[2:40:10] word.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Now, they had him doing tricks to
[2:40:14] entertain them, and that's just about
[2:40:16] the way he's got way. It's got instead
[2:40:18] of a Holy Spirit. When someone raises up
[2:40:21] and gets arrogant,
[2:40:23] the Holy Spirit is obligated to God to
[2:40:26] shut that thing up.
[2:40:34] I've seen them pack them from the
[2:40:35] meeting, paralyzed, blinded, dumb, even
[2:40:39] die in the meeting. Right in the
[2:40:40] meeting, drop dead while they're trying
[2:40:42] to rebuke it. God in heaven knows that's
[2:40:44] right. Many of you here have been in
[2:40:46] other meetings and witnessed the same
[2:40:47] thing. Brother Weey dropped dead in the
[2:40:49] meeting at Brandom Tabernacle because
[2:40:51] Brother Brandham had called him out
[2:40:52] about something and it had made him mad.
[2:40:55] He said it.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:40:58] He said, brother, brother brother Bam
[2:41:00] said about brother Edway that he had a
[2:41:02] complex
[2:41:04] and he's sitting there thinking, "Ah, he
[2:41:06] ought not to have said that. They're
[2:41:08] going to think this, that, the other."
[2:41:11] And he died
[2:41:13] and had to be raised from the dead.
[2:41:17] And thank God he was. Were you there?
[2:41:19] No. But I know some that were. And I
[2:41:22] have power. I mean, I have confidence in
[2:41:24] the power they carried.
[2:41:26] And they'd never give me a reason not to
[2:41:28] believe that what they were saying was
[2:41:29] the truth. But I will tell you this. I I
[2:41:32] can confirm that he died. But I can
[2:41:34] confirm that he lived beyond that. You
[2:41:36] know why?
[2:41:38] Because I'm sitting in a basement in
[2:41:39] Jerusalem. No, I think we were probably
[2:41:41] still in the chapel on Nashibi Street in
[2:41:44] Jerusalem. And they bring in an older
[2:41:46] woman one day and they introduce me to
[2:41:49] her and they tell me her name is Sister
[2:41:50] Emmy.
[2:41:52] And I come to like her very much. I come
[2:41:55] to find that she is an outstanding
[2:41:57] little sister from uh Denmark or Sweden
[2:42:01] or or or or
[2:42:03] somewhere European
[2:42:06] and uh began to talk to her a little bit
[2:42:08] and I began to find out that she may be
[2:42:11] the only one in Jerusalem listening to
[2:42:13] brother Brandham's tapes for years.
[2:42:17] And I said, 'Well, how in the world
[2:42:18] would you have ever heard the name
[2:42:20] Brother Brandham if you've lived in
[2:42:21] Jerusalem all these years and kind of
[2:42:23] isolated and sort of living a life very
[2:42:26] similar to that of an Orthodox Jew?
[2:42:29] Who would you have been around that Oh,
[2:42:30] she said there was a brother and sister
[2:42:32] who came here from Jeffersonville many
[2:42:34] years ago, brother and sister Wade,
[2:42:36] and he baptized me in the name of the
[2:42:38] Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:42:41] and I got to be her pastor until she
[2:42:43] died.
[2:42:44] Now, you think about that a minute.
[2:42:47] Praise God.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; That he didn't leave here with some
[2:42:51] little funny feeling he got during the
[2:42:53] service.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; I'm glad. I'm so glad I I went and
[2:42:57] prayed for her in the hospital on Purum.
[2:43:00] You've heard the story. I won't repeat
[2:43:02] it, but I went to pray for her in the
[2:43:04] hospital and I'm standing over a room
[2:43:06] thinking this may be the last time.
[2:43:07] Maybe maybe is she the one we prayed for
[2:43:09] a purum? I can't remember for sure 100%.
[2:43:12] But anyway, I was at the hospital more
[2:43:14] than once. But I'm praying for her and
[2:43:17] and all of a sudden I just get filled
[2:43:19] with this
[2:43:21] feeling of walking in something that you
[2:43:24] that you like a like a vision that you
[2:43:27] didn't have, like a dream you didn't
[2:43:30] have, like perhaps you've stepped into
[2:43:31] somebody else's dream or stepped into
[2:43:33] somebody else's vision. And all I could
[2:43:35] do was just stand there thanking God
[2:43:37] that somebody came a generation before I
[2:43:40] was able to go. Somebody came and told
[2:43:44] her the truth and she was baptized in
[2:43:45] the name of Jesus Christ. It's powerful.
[2:43:49] Last paragraph here. There ought to be a
[2:43:51] holy power surrounding and in the church
[2:43:53] that will make demons flee
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; instead of it. It's become a
[2:43:58] laughingtock.
[2:43:59] The mechanics.
[2:44:04] The mechanics instead of the dynamics. I
[2:44:08] believe he said we needed both
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; and now he's doing tricks.
[2:44:17] Oh, Lord have mercy.
[2:44:20] Now he's doing tricks. Musicians are
[2:44:21] coming.
[2:44:30] I don't want to leave you hopeless.
[2:44:32] It's about to get good.
[2:44:37] Can Can you show them the picture? I
[2:44:40] I don't know how to use AI very well for
[2:44:43] pictures or anything really, but I made
[2:44:46] one.
[2:44:47] uh he's sitting in the prison
[2:44:50] at a table
[2:44:53] because I found out that the image that
[2:44:54] brother Brandham had and the image that
[2:44:56] I always had in my mind of Samson
[2:44:59] couldn't have happened the way my mind
[2:45:02] saw it happening
[2:45:04] because the the rotary
[2:45:07] grinder
[2:45:09] kern had not been invented
[2:45:15] in the time of Samson. They were still
[2:45:17] using the handdrawn one.
[2:45:21] You see that one?
[2:45:24] Can you go back and look in the folder?
[2:45:26] No. Yes. Well, that's not Samson by any
[2:45:28] means. Uh, that is an Egyptian woman.
[2:45:32] Uh, will you go back and look in the
[2:45:34] original place and see if you happen to
[2:45:36] see that one there? Now, I'd like for
[2:45:37] the people to see that as we as we
[2:45:39] close.
[2:45:41] I added it later. Maybe I added it later
[2:45:43] and you took them from there or
[2:45:45] something along those lines.
[2:45:48] I was I thought it was kind of good. I
[2:45:51] thought I did pretty good.
[2:45:55] Oh yes. Oh yes. Ain't that good? I told
[2:46:00] I told that thing I said, "No, he's got
[2:46:03] too many muscles."
[2:46:06] And he I kept No, he's still got too
[2:46:08] many muscles. I reduced him down
[2:46:12] and then I said, "You put all his hair
[2:46:13] back on." No, he was shaven when he went
[2:46:17] in there.
[2:46:20] Don't give him a full head of hair. Give
[2:46:23] him the kind that you just rub and like.
[2:46:30] All these years in my mind, and brother
[2:46:32] Brandham also mentions this thing, all
[2:46:34] these years in my mind, I think about
[2:46:36] this rotary kind.
[2:46:39] But but it wasn't even invented
[2:46:42] for many many years after that. Kind of
[2:46:44] makes it sad when you think about it. So
[2:46:47] here he is in a prison house
[2:46:51] doing women's work.
[2:46:54] This is humiliating work.
[2:46:57] Only women did this kind of work and the
[2:46:59] prisoners.
[2:47:01] And he is literally on a stone grinding
[2:47:05] by hand every kernel
[2:47:09] by pushing that thing and applying
[2:47:12] pressure back and forth and back and
[2:47:15] forth and back and forth. It's hard
[2:47:17] work, laborous
[2:47:22] hate just uh they're mocking.
[2:47:26] It was humiliating. He can't see.
[2:47:30] Somebody had to keep coming in and
[2:47:32] helping him at it.
[2:47:35] Bible scholars say perhaps the lad.
[2:47:39] Perhaps he was a servant at the prison
[2:47:43] and he had to come in and help Samson
[2:47:48] to even know how to get more grain. Of
[2:47:51] course, you see it sitting close there
[2:47:53] like that. But they said there's a
[2:47:56] possibility that he had to be helped.
[2:47:59] That's the bad news. It was rough. It
[2:48:01] was tough. The champion now humiliated.
[2:48:04] Oh, that's bad, sad news. But the good
[2:48:07] news
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; is on his head
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; because it's growing back
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; and shortly he's going to the show
[2:48:21] led by the little lad.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[2:48:26] And God's going to restore the mission.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to stand with me and I want
[2:48:32] to say again,
[2:48:35] it's bad out there, we've got to make
[2:48:38] sure that we are standing on the word
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; in here
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; because we're also to benefit
[2:48:48] when the hair grows back
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; and the prayer is screamed just once
[2:48:54] more. Amen,
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:48:58] And he sends that final wave.
[2:49:01] I said to brother Gley,
[2:49:04] then they were all looking for more.
[2:49:10] Now they have to make excuses
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; for why it didn't happen that way.
[2:49:18] And instead of just saying God has a
[2:49:21] timing and we're still waiting on the
[2:49:24] fullness like the church has always had
[2:49:26] to say,
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; For hundreds of years
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; waiting on God to perform his word. But
[2:49:31] when he does, he does.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; How does he do it? Gradually, gradually,
[2:49:35] gradually, gradually, gradually,
[2:49:37] suddenly,
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; and that's why the Bible said, "He that
[2:49:42] endeth to the end, that's
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; the same shall be saved." Amen.
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; In those days, the ministers would tell
[2:49:49] us, "We don't understand it all. We
[2:49:52] don't see it all yet. It's laid out
[2:49:55] here. The framework is here. We're
[2:49:58] waiting to understand
[2:50:01] something else in those thunders. We're
[2:50:03] waiting to understand something else in
[2:50:06] that seventh seal. And then according to
[2:50:11] the third seal message, the bride's
[2:50:12] revival will break out." Well, it hasn't
[2:50:15] happened like that.
[2:50:18] And so they have to come now and say
[2:50:20] it's all one big revival. Woohoo.
[2:50:25] Then why are the people going back?
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; Why would we go back to Egypt
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; if we're in the middle of the last final
[2:50:34] great move of God? What would be
[2:50:36] attractive to us about going back to
[2:50:39] denominational systems? I don't
[2:50:41] understand that. And I don't know if you
[2:50:44] do, but I don't understand that at all.
[2:50:47] And so I cry out, Lord, more
[2:50:50] understanding, more revelation.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; We just keep walking in what you have
[2:50:55] showed us to walk in and wait.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to wait in backsliding
[2:51:01] condition. Do you?
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; I want to wait full of the fire of God.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; I was telling brother Gley about a
[2:51:09] service in Arizona, northern Arizona.
[2:51:12] When the Lord spoke to my heart, Brother
[2:51:16] Green had got up after the preaching
[2:51:19] and he had said, "This I believe with
[2:51:21] all my heart, this is just a beginning
[2:51:24] of what God promised us or this last
[2:51:28] move." And he began to say some positive
[2:51:31] things like that. It made one of the
[2:51:32] old-timers
[2:51:34] from the gang pretty upset.
[2:51:39] and he was talking loud while brother
[2:51:41] Green was giving this little report on
[2:51:44] what he thought about the meeting we had
[2:51:45] just had was pretty powerful meeting and
[2:51:48] that brother was sitting back there
[2:51:51] alongside of brother Patterson
[2:51:54] and they were just oh they were just
[2:51:56] having the biggest time criticizing what
[2:51:59] had just been said neither one of them
[2:52:01] thought very much of brother Green and
[2:52:03] they certainly didn't think very much of
[2:52:04] me I was to them that little lad that
[2:52:06] got in the way not the one that didn't
[2:52:09] help. And so
[2:52:12] that uh one of the gangs said, "I'd like
[2:52:14] to test I'd like to testify. Can I
[2:52:16] testify, Brother Perry?"
[2:52:18] And sure,
[2:52:20] you've been talking loud anyway.
[2:52:24] And he just said, "I just want y'all to
[2:52:26] know it's just been one great big ball
[2:52:28] of revival, Holy Ghost fire revival
[2:52:31] since the prophet was here. I don't even
[2:52:33] know what these folks are talking about
[2:52:35] waiting on anything.
[2:52:37] It's all here.
[2:52:40] And uh Brother Green leaned over. He
[2:52:43] said, "He's deceived." Just like that.
[2:52:45] He's deceived.
[2:52:48] This was the first person I'd ever heard
[2:52:50] say anything like that. We're in a great
[2:52:52] midst of a great revival and have been
[2:52:53] since the 60s because the churches were
[2:52:56] dusty dry and they were crying out for
[2:53:00] something. The people wanted something
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; and uh they were beginning to get a
[2:53:06] little drink of water and and here
[2:53:09] somebody wants to remind us of what it
[2:53:11] was. And the spirit of the Lord just uh
[2:53:13] revealed uh I don't know how God can
[2:53:16] reveal anything. Uh only way I know of
[2:53:19] about God revealing the past is if it is
[2:53:21] not under the blood.
[2:53:23] And God just began to describe this
[2:53:26] gentleman to me. and he worked pretty
[2:53:29] hard there for a few few years
[2:53:32] to hinder,
[2:53:34] but he had a change of heart.
[2:53:39] Anything is possible.
[2:53:41] And when I got through preaching Brother
[2:53:43] Green's funeral, he was standing in the
[2:53:46] aisle
[2:53:47] and he when I saw him, they told us, "We
[2:53:50] have to rush out. You've got to go out
[2:53:52] and be out of here before anybody else
[2:53:54] so that we can get to the cemetery
[2:53:56] first.
[2:53:57] I I grab my wife and we start up the
[2:53:59] aisle and he steps out in the aisle, a
[2:54:02] big old man. He steps out in the aisle
[2:54:05] and his arms are like this and I'm
[2:54:06] thinking, "Oh Lord, I remember you.
[2:54:11] I don't have time for this.
[2:54:16] You're just probably just as mad as you
[2:54:18] were 30 years ago." But he wasn't.
[2:54:22] He threw his arms around me and began to
[2:54:24] cry. He said, 'Oh, brother Shel, to
[2:54:27] think we have gone on now and you've
[2:54:30] gone on and done your thing. I've gone
[2:54:32] on and done mine and here we stand and
[2:54:34] God has given me the opportunity to look
[2:54:37] you in the eye and say, "I am so sorry.
[2:54:44] We so desperately needed
[2:54:48] what God was doing in those meetings."
[2:54:51] And there was just one thing that stood
[2:54:54] in the way and that was our pride.
[2:54:58] Will you forgive me?
[2:55:01] That that wasn't even a necessary
[2:55:03] question.
[2:55:05] But here's the point.
[2:55:08] We need then to go back and tell the
[2:55:10] people that we've coached out of the
[2:55:11] move of God.
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; We need to go back and say, "Be hungry
[2:55:15] for the for the for the dynamic
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; that comes on the mechanic. Yes.
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; You You've got the framework. Now you
[2:55:23] need the fire.
[2:55:24] &gt;&gt; You've got the framework. Now you need
[2:55:26] the rain.
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; You've got the framework. Now you need a
[2:55:31] fresh wind to blow.
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; It's not not at all out of order to ask
[2:55:36] God to come again and perform his word
[2:55:38] in us. That's right.
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; And for us,
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; I believe it's going to take that for
[2:55:45] those who are hung out there in in sin,
[2:55:49] in bitterness, in a backsliden
[2:55:51] condition, failed by the church, but not
[2:55:53] failed by God.
[2:55:55] Oh, it don't look good.
[2:55:59] It don't look good.
[2:56:02] But
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; the same he is yesterday
[2:56:10] and today
[2:56:12] and forever.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you ever did it once,
[2:56:17] &gt;&gt; you have the power.
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; Just like Rachel asked, sing the song,
[2:56:24] Brother Shelly,
[2:56:27] he'll do it again.
[2:56:31] It wasn't just her cry. It ought to be
[2:56:34] every one of our cries. Do it again.
[2:56:38] Show yourself again.
[2:56:40] &gt;&gt; We're going to serve you right on
[2:56:42] regardless. But oh God, move in this
[2:56:47] house
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; again
[2:56:50] without the weirdness, without the
[2:56:53] strangeness,
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; but just the sincerity of heart. May we
[2:56:58] get under the pillar of fire and not run
[2:57:01] on until we're changed and cleansed. May
[2:57:06] we drink from the water.
[2:57:10] May we get our priorities straight
[2:57:14] while the hair is growing.
[2:57:19] May we uh find ourselves
[2:57:23] again
[2:57:26] thrilled
[2:57:28] with what you're doing.
[2:57:32] Oh God, we don't want to treat you like
[2:57:34] a performer
[2:57:37] saying we piped unto you and you didn't
[2:57:39] dance.
[2:57:42] We want it to be your way,
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; your will
[2:57:47] in your timing,
[2:57:50] but we cry out again, Lord, once more.
[2:57:57] Let our hearts be turned back now
[2:58:01] to our fathers.
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:58:04] &gt;&gt; To those who paved the way for us.
[2:58:09] May we grab the faith
[2:58:12] that they
[2:58:14] showed us, modeled for us.
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:58:18] May we live it out
[2:58:21] to the best of our ability.
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; In the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[2:58:26] Christ, we pray.
[2:58:29] &gt;&gt; And the saint said, "What?"
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you pray for our dear
[2:58:35] friend, brother Bill, who will turn 82
[2:58:39] tomorrow,
[2:58:43] not in good shape, the first year
[2:58:46] without his wife.
[2:58:49] Would you bless brother and sister
[2:58:51] Miller younger younger
[2:58:55] brother Daniel and sister Anna for their
[2:58:58] 31st anniversary
[2:59:02] and Sister Anna Christine has a
[2:59:06] a beautiful birthday one with a zero on
[2:59:09] the end on Friday. Let's bless her.
[2:59:12] Let's pray over her. I know this isn't
[2:59:15] uh for everyone, but I noticed that on
[2:59:18] this coming Saturday 17th, our dear
[2:59:21] precious Ma went home to be with the
[2:59:24] Lord in 2001. Who would have ever
[2:59:28] thought we would have been here 25 years
[2:59:30] later.
[2:59:33] I thought when she left here, I was
[2:59:35] going right behind her.
[2:59:37] But I couldn't give up.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; And we couldn't quit, could we? We just
[2:59:42] had to keep pressing through
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; and we'll do it again for the next few
[2:59:47] years if that's what God will have. But
[2:59:50] we're going to cry out. We're going to
[2:59:53] reposition ourselves. Lord, send the
[2:59:55] Holy Spirit like the little lad to get
[2:59:58] us at the right position.
[3:00:00] Oh, don't get distracted now.
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on the prize. Pray for
[3:00:06] this younger generation.
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Pray for the young
[3:00:10] married couples. Pray for them. They've
[3:00:13] got to grab it and they've got to model
[3:00:15] it for their children.
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; Pray for them.
[3:00:19] Hold them up.
[3:00:21] Criticize less and pray more.
[3:00:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that'll help us all?
[3:00:45] Lost are saved
[3:00:48] and find their way
[3:00:52] at the sound
[3:00:56] of your great name
[3:01:00] and all condemned.
[3:01:04] I feel no shame
[3:01:08] at the sound
[3:01:12] of your great name.
[3:01:16] And every fear,
[3:01:20] it has no place
[3:01:24] at the sound
[3:01:27] of your great name.
[3:01:31] the enemy.
[3:01:35] He has to leave
[3:01:39] at the sound
[3:01:43] of your great name.
[3:01:48] Jesus,
[3:01:52] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:01:57] for us.
[3:01:59] Son of God and men, you are high and
[3:02:04] lifted up.
[3:02:07] All the world will praise your great
[3:02:11] name.
[3:02:17] Oh Jesus,
[3:02:22] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:02:27] for us.
[3:02:30] Son of God and man, and you are high and
[3:02:35] lifted up,
[3:02:37] and all the world will praise your great
[3:02:42] name
[3:02:48] and all the weak
[3:02:52] find their strength.
[3:02:55] Oh, it's at the sound
[3:02:59] of your great name.
[3:03:03] And hungry souls
[3:03:06] receive their grace
[3:03:10] at the sound
[3:03:14] of your great name.
[3:03:17] The fatherless,
[3:03:21] they find their rest
[3:03:25] at the sound
[3:03:28] of your great name.
[3:03:32] Oh, the sick are healed
[3:03:35] and the dead are raised
[3:03:39] at the sound,
[3:03:42] the sound of your great name.
[3:03:48] Jesus,
[3:03:51] worthy is the lamb that was slain for
[3:03:56] us.
[3:03:58] Son of God and men and you are high and
[3:04:03] lifted up
[3:04:06] and all the world will praise your great
[3:04:10] name.
[3:04:16] And all the weak
[3:04:19] they find their strength.
[3:04:23] Oh, it's at the sound
[3:04:27] of your great name.
[3:04:30] And hungry souls
[3:04:34] receive their grace
[3:04:38] at the sound
[3:04:41] of your great name.
[3:04:45] The father lives.
[3:04:48] Oh, they find their rest
[3:04:52] at the sound
[3:04:56] of your great name.
[3:04:59] Oh, the sick are healed
[3:05:03] and the dead are raised
[3:05:07] at the sound
[3:05:10] the sound of your great name.
[3:05:15] Jesus,
[3:05:19] worthy is the lamb that was slain for
[3:05:24] us.
[3:05:26] Son of God in men and you are high and
[3:05:31] lifted up
[3:05:33] and all the world will praise your great
[3:05:38] name.
[3:05:44] Oh Jesus,
[3:05:48] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:05:53] for us.
[3:05:56] Son of God in man and you are high and
[3:06:00] lift.
[3:06:03] &gt;&gt; And all the world will praise your great
[3:06:08] name.
[3:06:15] Redeemer,
[3:06:17] my healer, Lord Almighty,
[3:06:23] defender,
[3:06:24] my Savior. You are my king,
[3:06:30] redeemer. You're my healer, Lord,
[3:06:34] Almighty,
[3:06:37] defender.
[3:06:39] You're my savior and you are my king,
[3:06:45] redeemer. You are my healer, Lord, all
[3:06:50] my king, defender. You're my savior. You
[3:06:56] are my king,
[3:06:59] redeemer,
[3:07:01] my healer, Lord Almighty,
[3:07:07] defender. You're my savior and you are
[3:07:12] my king.
[3:07:16] Oh,
[3:07:21] and Jesus
[3:07:25] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:07:30] for us.
[3:07:33] Son of God in man and you are high and
[3:07:38] lifted up
[3:07:40] and all the world will praise your great
[3:07:45] name
[3:07:52] and Jesus
[3:07:56] worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:08:01] for us.
[3:08:04] Son of God in men and you are high and
[3:08:09] lifted up
[3:08:11] and all the world will praise your great
[3:08:16] name.
[3:08:22] Oh Jesus,
[3:08:27] worthy are you. Lamb that was slain

[3:08:35] Son of God and man, you are high and
[3:08:40] lifted up
[3:08:42] and all the world will praise your great
[3:08:47] name.
[3:08:59] Worthy is the lamb that was slain
[3:09:04] for us.
[3:09:06] Son of God in men and you are high and
[3:09:11] lifted up
[3:09:14] and all the world will praise your great
[3:09:19] name.
[3:09:25] And all the weak
[3:09:29] find their strength
[3:09:33] at the sound
[3:09:36] of your great name.
[3:09:40] And hungry souls
[3:09:44] receive their grace
[3:09:48] at the sound
[3:09:52] of your great name.
[3:09:55] Oh, the father lives.
[3:09:59] That's where they find their rest
[3:10:04] at the sound
[3:10:07] of your great name.
[3:10:11] The sick are healed
[3:10:14] and the dead are raised
[3:10:18] at the sound.
[3:10:21] The sound of your great name
[3:10:27] Jesus.
[3:10:31] Worthy is the lamb that was slain for
[3:10:36] us.
[3:10:38] Son of God. Amen.
[3:10:41] You are high and lifted up
[3:10:46] and all the world will praise your great
[3:10:50] name.
[3:10:52] Don't let it lay on the ground. Pick it
[3:10:54] up. Pick it up.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; Don't let it lay on the ground.
[3:11:01] Pick up every promise.
[3:11:05] &gt;&gt; Pick up every promise.
[3:11:09] Pick up everything that was dropped.
[3:11:12] You are high.
[3:11:14] Pick up what the generation before you
[3:11:17] drop. The world will praise your
[3:11:20] &gt;&gt; pick up what runners ahead of you drop.
[3:11:25] &gt;&gt; Pick up what soldiers ahead of you drop.
[3:11:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let it lay on the ground.
[3:11:31] &gt;&gt; Don't let him become spoiled of the
[3:11:34] enemy. Pick up the promise. Defender.
[3:11:38] Pick it up. You are my king.
[3:11:43] &gt;&gt; Pick it up. Redeemer,
[3:11:46] my healer, Lord Almighty,
[3:11:51] defender.
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; It's got to be now.
[3:11:54] &gt;&gt; It has to be now.
[3:11:57] &gt;&gt; It has to be now.
[3:12:01] &gt;&gt; You got to pick it up now.
[3:12:04] mighty.
[3:12:05] &gt;&gt; It can lay there any longer with no one
[3:12:08] to make a claim.
[3:12:10] &gt;&gt; You are mighty. Take him now. Redeemer,
[3:12:15] my healer, Lord Almighty,
[3:12:21] defender,
[3:12:23] my savior. You are my king.
[3:12:31] Oh,
[3:12:36] and Jesus.
[3:12:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Worthy is the lamb that was
[3:12:44] slain
[3:12:45] for us.
[3:12:48] Son of God in man. And you are high and
[3:12:52] lifted up.
[3:12:55] And all the world will praise your
[3:12:59] grace. Oh God, free every one of us.
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; Free every one of us who are living
[3:13:06] under the influence of the lie. Free us
[3:13:10] all, Lord.
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; Free us right now. Let us break free.
[3:13:15] Let us come loose. Let us come out from
[3:13:20] under the influence
[3:13:22] of any lie that the enemy has spoken
[3:13:25] over us. May we come out from under it.
[3:13:28] May we break free. May we resist its
[3:13:32] hold on us. And may we now pick up the
[3:13:37] promises of God that have been forfeited
[3:13:41] along the way, dropped along the way by
[3:13:44] generations before us
[3:13:47] &gt;&gt; who wanted to be accepted more than they
[3:13:50] wanted to be anointed. So Lord, we ask
[3:13:53] right now that you let us identify what
[3:13:56] is laying around us. And may we not step
[3:13:59] over it anymore. May we not walk on
[3:14:02] anymore. May we recognize what has been
[3:14:06] dropped. What did our fathers drop? What
[3:14:08] did our grandfathers drop? May we pick
[3:14:11] it up, Lord, and claim it as our own.
[3:14:15] May we take a hold of every promise. May
[3:14:19] we take a hold of every promise.
[3:14:23] &gt;&gt; May we take a hold of it now in the name
[3:14:27] of Jesus
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; and own it.
[3:14:38] May we not make excuses
[3:14:42] &gt;&gt; any longer
[3:14:47] but grab a hold.
[3:14:52] We do so much talking when we're not in
[3:14:55] here. We do so much talking. We we
[3:14:59] barely have time in a busy week to let
[3:15:03] the impact of your word fall on us.
[3:15:10] Some of us make such a pitiful effort to
[3:15:14] show up physically and spiritually and
[3:15:18] it sets such a low standard in this
[3:15:23] house. Father, may there be enough of
[3:15:27] us. Pick up,
[3:15:30] Jacob. I believe the Lord is calling to
[3:15:32] you.
[3:15:37] Don't lay let anything lay at your feet.
[3:15:47] May God help you identify
[3:15:50] anything that's been dropped.
[3:15:54] that you might claim it, that you might
[3:15:57] pick it up.
[3:16:03] My dad stood in a
[3:16:07] man-made lake
[3:16:09] in Foresight, Georgia at a youth camp
[3:16:14] as a teenager,
[3:16:20] convicted,
[3:16:24] promising God.
[3:16:28] so lost in the inspiration of the Holy
[3:16:31] Spirit that he staggered out into the
[3:16:33] water alone
[3:16:37] and promised God, I'll preach your word.
[3:16:40] I'll carry your gospel. I'll do whatever
[3:16:43] it is that you've called me to do.
[3:16:48] I believe he meant it at the moment like
[3:16:51] hundreds of others I know.
[3:16:54] But he got back to high school
[3:16:57] and my mother was pretty
[3:17:00] and she was a Baptist girl.
[3:17:03] And he dropped his co his calling, his
[3:17:06] commission,
[3:17:08] not because she forced him to, but
[3:17:10] because it was quite convenient to do
[3:17:12] it.
[3:17:15] And he lived a miserable life because of
[3:17:17] it.
[3:17:20] And look what God did for me. He's given
[3:17:22] me 50 plus years
[3:17:25] because somehow I don't understand how
[3:17:27] all these things work but somehow I not
[3:17:30] only carry my calling but I picked up
[3:17:32] his
[3:17:35] and I'm carrying it forward
[3:17:38] and I hope to give it to this
[3:17:39] generation.
[3:17:42] It doesn't make anybody a bad man.
[3:17:44] Doesn't make him a bad man or anybody
[3:17:46] else that drop.
[3:17:49] May God just show us, I mean
[3:17:52] individually and corporately. May God
[3:17:54] just show us anything that he wanted to
[3:17:56] do and the commission got dropped or the
[3:18:00] burden for it got dropped or or or the
[3:18:03] zeal for it got dropped and may we just
[3:18:05] sisters too.
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; Sisters too because their mothers had no
[3:18:11] doubt desires and burdens. We're not
[3:18:13] talking about preaching but we're
[3:18:15] talking about evangelizing. We're
[3:18:17] talking about sharing the word with with
[3:18:20] your life.
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:18:22] &gt;&gt; If you've let that slip. If you've let
[3:18:24] your testimony slip, pick it up.
[3:18:29] &gt;&gt; If you've got under the influence of
[3:18:31] somebody's negative talk, cut that off
[3:18:33] today and call them out. Call them out.
[3:18:38] Hush your mouth. I don't want to hear no
[3:18:40] more of your defeated talk. I don't want
[3:18:42] to hear no more of your destructive
[3:18:44] talk. Just make sure you're not guilty
[3:18:46] of the same
[3:18:48] and pick up what the Lord would let you
[3:18:50] find and run with it.
[3:18:53] It's time to run with it. It doesn't
[3:18:56] just rest on two shoulders. It rests on
[3:18:59] all of our shoulders.
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; I don't even feel a rebuke. I feel an
[3:19:04] invitation.
[3:19:06] &gt;&gt; I feel like the Lord's just inviting us.
[3:19:08] &gt;&gt; Do you want it? Do you want what you
[3:19:11] what's yours? And do you want what's
[3:19:13] been left? I do. I do. I do. I want it.
[3:19:16] I want the fullness of it
[3:19:20] &gt;&gt; without the weirdness. I want it. I want
[3:19:22] the pure, pure, unadulterated
[3:19:27] &gt;&gt; right out of the mouth of God. That's
[3:19:29] what I want.
[3:19:31] &gt;&gt; May we keep positioning ourselves by the
[3:19:34] spirit.
[3:19:36] I don't know why, but I just felt
[3:19:38] strongly like uh part of that was for
[3:19:41] Jacob and for for his generation and
[3:19:44] others like him. Why don't some of you
[3:19:46] brothers just lay hands on him?
[3:19:51] His dad had so much calling and so much
[3:19:53] potential
[3:19:55] and he kept putting it off and putting
[3:19:57] it off and putting it off until there
[3:19:59] was no more time left to put it off. I'm
[3:20:02] not trying to be critical. I'll answer
[3:20:04] for that. I'm not afraid to answer for
[3:20:06] that. It's a truth.
[3:20:07] &gt;&gt; It's a truth.
[3:20:10] &gt;&gt; And maybe that's why he came to me so
[3:20:12] strong there, Jacob, is is because he of
[3:20:15] what he represents. Uh would you want to
[3:20:18] if you leave it behind, would you want
[3:20:20] somebody not to touch it? No. You want
[3:20:22] somebody to get it and run on with it.
[3:20:26] Father, as he is uh lay as we lay hands
[3:20:29] on him and as these brothers pray over
[3:20:31] him right now, I pray, oh God, that he
[3:20:34] will represent a generation who will
[3:20:37] pick up things that have been forfeited,
[3:20:40] dropped, and left behind. He's in a
[3:20:43] precarious position. But oh God, he
[3:20:46] represents not only himself, but he
[3:20:49] represents a generation of others.
[3:20:52] Father, may we be mindful to pray for
[3:20:56] him and for those around him to pick up
[3:21:01] what has been dropped along the way and
[3:21:03] run, run with deliverance, run with
[3:21:06] freedom in the name of Jesus.
[3:21:10] May we make you a place, Lord. May we
[3:21:13] clear room in us for you to come and
[3:21:16] occupy the throne of our inner man,
[3:21:19] Jesus. Brother Gley, I know you're sick
[3:21:22] in the Lord. I don't want to disturb
[3:21:24] you, but would you lay hands on Jacob?
[3:21:33] I I just keep feeling to say it again.
[3:21:36] He He represent. It's not just his life,
[3:21:39] but it's it's who he represents
[3:21:42] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[3:22:06] Jason, do you do you and do you and
[3:22:09] Jacob get along? All right, come around.
[3:22:13] Would
[3:22:15] &gt;&gt; would you just represent the generation
[3:22:17] before him? Would you just symbolize
[3:22:19] that generation before him right now and
[3:22:22] just join your faith together with his
[3:22:24] in the name of Jesus.
[3:22:27] &gt;&gt; Now Lord, we've got one representing a
[3:22:29] generation before.
[3:22:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[3:22:45] May both of these generations jump in.
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; May they jump in.
[3:22:53] May they quit playing around on the
[3:22:55] shore.
[3:22:57] &gt;&gt; May they quit putting their toes in. And
[3:22:59] may they jump in.
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; These two men represent two generations,
[3:23:05] Lord, that we cry out for right now.
[3:23:09] &gt;&gt; Two groups of people.
[3:23:13] God, you said through your prophet, you
[3:23:15] don't have any grandchildren.
[3:23:19] &gt;&gt; Here are representatives of two
[3:23:21] generations that must have their own
[3:23:24] experience with you.
[3:23:28] Howus
[3:23:40] say
[3:23:56] &gt;&gt; come Come on, reach your hand this way
[3:23:57] and pray a prayer of faith. Let's don't
[3:24:00] despise small things. Let's get on this
[3:24:01] for just another minute. Some of you is
[3:24:04] trying to figure out how that's possible
[3:24:07] that they represent two generations
[3:24:09] because of their family connection
[3:24:12] because technically they're they're of
[3:24:14] the same gener. But I'm talking about
[3:24:17] Jason has grown children, grown men with
[3:24:21] children of their own.
[3:24:24] So I'm placing him
[3:24:26] in this
[3:24:28] &gt;&gt; in the same generation,
[3:24:31] &gt;&gt; even though it's not quite there
[3:24:34] &gt;&gt; with Jacob's dad.
[3:24:37] And I believe it's the Lord. And I
[3:24:39] believe there's some redemption that I
[3:24:41] want to claim right now in the name of
[3:24:44] Jesus.
[3:24:48] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[3:24:54] Hallelujah.
[3:25:03] &gt;&gt; Sister Flo, you come and put the third
[3:25:05] one. Put the third generation there.
[3:25:09] &gt;&gt; We're just we're just pretending that
[3:25:11] Jason is is a son, but he has been.
[3:25:20] &gt;&gt; Now, three-fold cord is not easily
[3:25:22] broken.
[3:25:24] And we're not just praying over a
[3:25:25] natural family. We're praying over
[3:25:27] something spiritual now
[3:25:30] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[3:25:35] &gt;&gt; It matters.
[3:25:37] &gt;&gt; It matters.
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:25:53] together.
[3:25:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:25:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[3:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We join.
[3:26:25] &gt;&gt; We put our faith in there at the sound
[3:26:31] of your great name.

[3:26:40] &gt;&gt; Worthy. Worthy is the lamb that was
[3:26:44] slain
