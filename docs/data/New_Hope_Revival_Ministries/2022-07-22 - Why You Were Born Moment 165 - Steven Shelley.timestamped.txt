[0:00] i want you to know your origin
[0:09] even those that have been in church
[0:11] though all their lives
[0:13] sometimes have an identity crisis
[0:17] and they fail to know who they are
[0:21] and they fail to understand
[0:24] why they were born
[0:26] do you know why you were born maybe you
[0:29] would say like the old song i was born
[0:31] to serve the lord and i agree with you
[0:34] 100
[0:35] but i think it's important sometime for
[0:37] a person to have a revelation to really
[0:40] begin to understand why
[0:42] you are here and who you really are i
[0:46] want to talk about this morning just a
[0:48] little bit i want to talk about who you
[0:50] really are i want you to understand who
[0:52] you are and where you came from i want
[0:55] you to know your origin
[1:00] i want you to know you you're older than
[1:03] your birthday
[1:05] i want you to know you existed before
[1:08] you were ever born
[1:09] in the mind of god we were his thoughts
[1:14] we were among his attributes
[1:17] and we were there in a form that had the
[1:20] ability to praise him then
[1:23] i know that the sons of god they danced
[1:26] and shouted before the lord in
[1:29] eternity's past
[1:32] maybe by some expression or maybe only
[1:36] in the thought processes of the living
[1:39] god but it blesses me to know that i was
[1:42] a praiser before i was ever born
[1:45] it blesses me to know that i
[1:48] acknowledged and worshiped the creator
[1:50] before i was ever expressed on the earth
[1:53] you see i've recognized who i am
[1:56] i've recognized where i come from and
[1:59] i've recognized what my duty what my
[2:01] commission what my mandate here is on
[2:05] planet earth and i want every one of you
[2:07] to be able to experience that for
[2:09] yourselves you can't catch it
[2:13] it's not contagious
[2:15] but you can understand that it's
[2:17] possible and in fact it's nearly
[2:20] necessary
[2:22] for you to understand that you are here
[2:24] for a purpose
[2:26] i want you to know why you were born
[2:28] i want you to know why you were born now
[2:31] i want you to know why you're living in
[2:33] this age
[2:35] i want you to know that god placed you
[2:37] here not just to be a husband
[2:40] not just to be a wife
[2:42] not just to be a hard worker
[2:45] but he placed you here for a purpose
[2:48] for a calling for a reason
[2:51] it's not just preachers that have
[2:53] commissions
[2:54] every true son of god is here on a
[2:58] mandate
[2:59] you are here on the commission
[3:02] you are here for a reason
[3:05] oh he saw he saw your your
[3:07] predisposition
[3:11] he saw your generational stuff before
[3:13] you were ever born don't you think god
[3:15] saw it coming down through the
[3:16] bloodlines don't you think he knew that
[3:18] if addiction was coming down through
[3:20] your bloodline that it would touch your
[3:22] life in some way
[3:23] but he already made a plan to get you
[3:25] out
[3:26] i'm telling you right now he has already
[3:28] made a plan to get you out
[3:30] just because daddy wasn't granddad he
[3:32] wasn't great-granddad he wasn't
[3:34] great-great-granddaddy was
[3:36] doesn't mean you have to be
[3:39] because we are awakening to who we are
[3:42] and why we were born
[3:44] we do not come in our own authority and
[3:47] power we come in the power and the
[3:49] authority of the lord jesus christ
[3:52] king of all kings and lord of all lord
[3:55] you are here to manifest what the father
[4:00] hath spoken
[4:02] [Applause]
[4:03] you are a part of what the father has
[4:07] spoken
[4:14] you
