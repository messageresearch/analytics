[0:00] there are certain difficulties and
[0:03] situations and trials that only
[0:05] Believers
[0:07] face and here is the reality of the
[0:10] believer you don't mind as much when you
[0:14] recognize hell is persecuting you you
[0:18] don't mind as much when you realize your
[0:20] enemies are against you you don't mind
[0:23] as much when the world doesn't want
[0:25] anything to do with
[0:26] you because what Fellowship
[0:30] have light with Darkness but where the
[0:34] believer is often
[0:37] trapped it's when the hurt when the
[0:40] trial when it comes from the
[0:43] Brethren betrayals even more difficult
[0:46] when it comes from brothers friends
[0:49] family ask
[0:51] Joseph Joseph was so by his
[0:54] Brethren betrayed by his own
[0:57] family blood
[1:00] all blood
[1:03] related and yet Joseph is a nearly
[1:09] perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13] Judah could have starved to death had it
[1:16] not been for
[1:18] yourself had it not been for his brother
[1:21] Judah would have died there's a problem
[1:23] with
[1:24] that it's from the loins of Judah that
[1:27] Jesus came right had he died Not only
[1:32] would salvation have not come to all the
[1:36] children of
[1:37] Jacob but Salvation wouldn't have come
[1:40] to you and
[1:42] I well couldn't have God raise somebody
[1:44] else up he could have but he already had
[1:46] a plan through
[1:47] Judah so God preserved his life and
[1:50] guess what he used a Brother Joseph who
[1:53] could have been offended who could have
[1:55] been bitter who could have wanted
[1:56] Vengeance who could have wanted to take
[1:58] revenge who could have killed them all
[2:01] and been Justified even under the law
[2:03] for doing so but he chose rather to take
[2:07] God's perspective and God's perspective
[2:10] said I got a plan in all of this I
[2:13] haven't left you
[2:16] Joseph I'm taking you from the pit to
[2:19] the Palace I've got a
[2:25] plan I've got a plan for your life it
[2:31] hurts you're bleeding on the
[2:34] inside the Betrayal feels more than you
[2:37] can
[2:38] bear the Bible doesn't talk to us much
[2:41] about the time that Joseph spent in the
[2:44] pit but it wasn't a
[2:47] party oh it
[2:50] was I'm sure there were days of pity
[2:53] party you ever had one don't you look at
[2:57] me like you've never had a pity party
[2:59] some of have you been in one a whole
[3:01] week he called me to train
[3:05] you that's what he said 50 years ago
[3:08] when he called me to this work to train
[3:11] you because you've got something to
[3:14] do and you don't always train with a
[3:18] carrot thank God for every carrot he's
[3:21] ever given me to keep me moving along
[3:23] but it wasn't the carrot that brought me
[3:26] to my knees it was the staff it was the
[3:30] rod it was the
[3:32] Whip and you don't even despise the rod
[3:36] when you understand its purpose when you
[3:40] understand that to be trained means to
[3:43] be
[3:44] told and then an example set before you
[3:49] that you can follow that's what training
[3:51] looks like so I have to practice this
[3:56] when I don't feel like when I don't want
[3:59] to
[4:01] it's my
[4:02] responsibility to
[4:04] wna you got to make yourself W sometime
[4:08] for somebody
[4:12] else sometimes what we think we
[4:16] want or
[4:18] deserve is not what we need at
[4:23] all sometimes we need somebody to look
[4:26] us right in the eye and say suck it up
[4:28] buttercup
[4:34] get
[4:36] up just get up and press on
