service where the word will be delivered we're praying for our pastor our brother as he steps behind this desk that there would be extra grace and strength that would just flow down through his physical body and that he would be able to deliver with freedom the word of the lord that is for this service and i'm praying for grace for the hearer lord that our ears would be tuned our hearts

another praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may take the rest of your seat again oh how wonderful the lord is he is my lord my god my redeemer my strength my friend he helps us through every low place and every high place he gives us the strength to go up and over he gives us strength to go through he gives us strength to go around whatever his roadmap is i want to stay right on the roadmap because whatever obstacle is in on that road map he is going to give me the grace to go through it he didn't bring it to stay he brought it to pass and and and i don't want if i'm in the heat of a battle i don't want to just get through it so i can face the next day i want to learn what the holy spirit wants me to learn i want to get all of the all of the material that i'm supposed to get for that season i don't want to hope that i get it in the next season i want all of his training that he's taken me through in this season to have its preeminence and to get inside of me so that i can face the next season and i realize that this life is a series of tests it's a series of battles it's a series of overcoming but then i realized that that is the very reason i was placed on the earth to overcome whatever was put in my path if i had not had that blessing put on my life i would be like the rest of the church world at large i would do whatever pleased self but by the grace of god by the goodness of god he's the one that put on me overcomer so therefore when the test comes he gives me grace to go through it go around it go over it whatever the road map says i want to be right in the middle of what he's doing and let him speak his love and his life over me hallelujah praise the lord there's your sermon before the sermon hallelujah grace for every need praise the lord austin

he is doing it and i want to give him praise i want to be faithful to give him praise because he is the one who is supplying for every need amen amen amen grace for every need it's written in one flat

the country whether we can or not i it just takes me way back to hear those harmonies everybody in the church when i was growing up they knew their part they knew what to sing and even the ones that didn't sing good sung loud and you know what it would make the rafters ring when those little parts start parts would start coming in and it's just a wonderful feeling to hear it just hear a little bit of it we'll surely take you back we brother greeley and i have sung harmony together going down many highways in many different nations and if we hadn't thought we'd get to put off the plane we we'd have probably done it on the plane it will keep you you sing a song of praise for the lord it'll keep you it'll keep your mind at peace sing in the shower sing in the living room singing the automobile sing wherever you can lester sumrall used to say that when he was around water anytime he was around water it brought him into the spirit realm so he said i would just go stand in the swimming pool waist high and just enter in and praise the lord and sing praises to god standing waist high in the swimming pool i don't know i've experienced something similar to that before god is good this morning no need for you to be quiet god is good this morning hallelujah he is may be seated he is all the time good let me get my note off of there we we do miss those that are out uh chad and uh levi are gone today and may god give them travel and mercy i think paul may be with them is that what somebody said so we pray for them to have uh safety on the dangerous roads and what a blessing it was to look up and see luke here he come across a platform working doing something this morning and and i was thinking for a minute that he would had gone with him and i know he'd had a great time but i'm glad he's here this morning and uh sister tebow's grandson zach is a traveling nurse and uh it was just about time for them to have a wedding if you know what i mean and they finally got to it and uh so a lot of the family is gone today we miss them and uh we just didn't know what what would be and who would get to be here today because of the of the birth this morning hallelujah 7 47 i think it was was that right i think that was the time our time uh i think it was 747 and believe what nathan said and uh you know she did amazing i'm hearing i wasn't there but she did amazing and god's grace was upon them and we are so thankful for that and it was almost finished at home almost finished at home but uh the change of atmosphere and the change of location on the way over there it just finished the rest by the time she got there she was ready to just go ahead and get here just come right into this world and i'm so thankful and i'm gonna have to write the name down and practice getting it all in and uh but i'm so thankful and i i just congratulate uh sister joyce and brother greeley i haven't heard what you're going to be called yet do you know i mean you whatever she says is what you'll answer too uh honey what is it somebody my wife is out i think what is it that uh that sister trish baggett's little fella calls uh kisses kiss her he calls he calls trisha's mom kiss her because she when he come in when she would get him every time she would go in for the kisses give give me kisses and so as soon as he could start putting the name to her he called her kisser i said i've never heard of that but i think that's outstanding and that's what grandmas are for is to kiss that's right and the love and the spoil and to be there when when mom and daddy need help so congratulations to both of you and uh brother greeley he's decided he didn't need a modern uh kind of fufu name grandpa just worked fine granddad you say grandpa who knows who knows

given it to brother billy paul as a gift which i was so touched by because i don't know when i would have ever had an opportunity to do that and uh a letter came in the mail and he said brother shelley even though we've not had the privilege of meeting yet he said i wanted to tell you what a blessing your your uh cassette boy that was a long time ago your cassette was to us and he said uh we listened we were all gathered at christmas time with the family and we listened to your cassette over and over again and he said i'd like for you i'd like to buy 10 i don't remember if it was 10 or 12 uh copies of that cassette because i want to give it to all the family members that was gathered with us there at christmas i want to give it to them as presents because they all enjoyed it so much and he said but i have a favorite song of all the songs that were on the uh the album what an album the cassette i have a favorite song and you know that meant a lot to me because it was one of the songs that i got in trouble for when i came to the message and it ended up being brother billy paul branham's favorite song so i said i'm going to tell that boy when they'd call me to come and sing in meetings and revivals and things when i wasn't preaching i'd say can i say something before i sing this i wanted to run that little disclaimer so they would so they'd at least clap their hands with me

that were a little bit new to me but we got through it anyway i'm thankful whoa i'm a little out of breath though [Music] in the lord good let's thank god for the musicians praise the lord for every sacrifice praise god i don't know but i need your prayers like everybody else to get through this i need the lord's help i had an hour and 45 minutes sleep last night but god was good and all of that and he's stretching it how many of you know he'll stretch it and he'll give you strength hallelujah i said lord i can't sing that this morning i don't have the strength but he's got the strength you just have to let him i'm not ashamed of pentecost because for me it was not a denomination i only held license with the denomination just a very short period of time about 18 months and when they began to tell me what i could preach and what i couldn't preach and what i ought to preach put their hand on it and say that's offensive and that won't work and that's not just right then i had the grace of god i pass it all the time in phoenix city when i go to the uh synovus i uh a benjamin takes it for me a lot but he was busy this week and i took the payment and i passed down by the old post office and see the old assembly of god first assembly of god church sitting there you know it's on the highway now but it used to be in downtown phoenix city i pastored just around the corner at uh 12th street in 12th court it's where our church sat and the pastor calvary temple for almost three years and it was during that time that the denomination started putting a little pressure on us and the deacon board was even putting some pressure on us and they said well you know the bible didn't say how long is long and the bible didn't say how short is short and if you're going to be a part of a denomination i heard an our church our denomination then you ought to use evangelists that are licensed with our organization when they begin to say that i said well there really is no liberty then i draw a small check and i carry the title and i work like a dog but i don't have freedom to preach what the holy ghost gives me i said that don't sound like much of a oh i forgot i did get to drive free a beat-up volkswagen van it was browned i thank god for it but it was ugly and when i wanted to go up a hill i had to stand up i had to stand up because you couldn't get the pedal to the ground any other way the only way to get the pedal down all the way was to stand up so i climbed many hills standing up to get up the hill and then i know you're standing i'm gonna be i'm standing too and we'll be along on you uh then the former pastor of the church sued the church and so i was caught in the middle of something i had nothing to do with they trashed the parsonage and sued the church and it come time to ask that the headquarters would come down and protect us and stand for the defense of the church and uh i said to the deacon lord well you all did this you voted him in you voted him out i had nothing to do with this i don't think this is my business they begged me men of integrity that i love begged me to go and speak on their behalf at headquarters so i showed my boys the other day when we were coming through montgomery i said you see that building right there that's the building i had to go meet the overseers they call them superintendents then and i had to beg them to come and testify and i had a subpoena in case in case the begging didn't work i had subpoenas in my hand from the attorneys and they sat there and begged me not to subpoena them please do not force us to get involved and if you want basically if you want to hold your credentials then you will take that subpoena back with me and i said okay and tossed it in the floor in the trash tosses the bean and drastic i said just know this men and brethren just know this if you are not willing to stand for your church jesus will he'll stand for it and we'll be all right without you we'll call you and let you know how it all goes down and you know god was good to those people he helped them he helped us get through it and then the pressure started coming about what to preach and who could preach for us so i remember the day very well that i took my little plastic card i was so proud of uh uh licensed in the assemblies of god so proud of my little license i was so thankful to be able to go and lay that on brother comer's desk and i said you can't take from me what i'm giving you i'm more than delighted to hand it to you because you'll not be able to tell me what to preach you'll not be able to make me try to interpret how long is long and how short is short and i'll be able to ask whoever i desire as long as it's godly and right and the church is in agreement i won't have to just use your preachers i'll let the holy spirit lead and direct me and guide me and you know what i felt like a bird leaving there i wasn't ugly they weren't ugly to me but i felt like a little bird that'd been let out a cage you think i'd go get mixed up in babylon like that again i wouldn't want to get it mixed up in that for all the money in the world to be free to be free to be obedient to the lord and he has given me that freedom here and i don't take it lightly i'm thankful for it and so glad to be delivered from all of that stuff that likes to put the pressure on he's just a good god he's a good god he's going to see us through turn in your bibles uh to second don't rush me ii chronicles chapter 20 uh beginning in verse one you stay awake too and if you've got somebody next to you sleepy see if you can help them say you couldn't be any sleeper than the preacher so you stay awake too we're in this thing together it's a it takes a team it takes a family to do it i my kids said last night they said daddy you've prayed for people all day long said i've never had no never known you to have so many calls for prayer but you know what that's what we do that's what we do because we know the power of god and we know how to call him on the scene and he comes how many of you believe he comes he doesn't play games with us he doesn't play hide and seek with his people he comes woo glory verse one it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle and then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in tamar which is getty and gedi we know where that is many of us have been there together and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord this was the king and the king was afraid but he didn't ring his hands all night hear what i'm saying he didn't look for a carnal way out to calm his fear he didn't look to the arms of flesh he looked to the lord he set himself to seek the lord and he proclaimed a fast throughout all judah israel was divided the nation of israel the nation of judah it was a divided house but god was about to do some things that are very supernatural and judith gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord hallelujah even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord how many of you know it's powerful when people move together when they move together with a purpose then god can take people of limited means when they move together under the inspiration and leadership of the spirit god can move in those people and he can provide 206 497.26 because the people heard the cry and they moved together now here is a biblical example of of of a king a leader calling the people together to seek the face of the lord and proclaiming a fast and they came in and stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and said oh lord god of our fathers are you with me church art not thou god in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee does anybody hear the prayer strategy do you get it do you realize that they were preparing the heart of the lord they were reminding him of what he is capable of doing and so we could call this a praise moment because ever say oh god isn't there power and might in your hand so that none is able to withstand thee art not thou our god let's go let's stroll down memory lane who did us drive out the inhabitants of the land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend forever and we're going to verse 13 and they dwelt therein and have built there a sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand oh hallelujah oh no matter what comes against us we know where to stand we stand before oh i don't know we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house oh church we can't take it lightly where god desires to place his name when he puts his name there on his word it makes any old shed a holy place i told you about granny's honky tonk what made it holy was the name of the lord placed there it sanctified and set it apart oh for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help oh lord hearing help whoa i was praying with sister anita on the phone last night when i hung up the phone the spirit of the lord came in the room again and i prayed out and that was exactly what i was saying forgetting about these words in my text but i said lord hear us and help hear us and help hallelujah and he does and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou would hast not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou has given us to inherit oh our god will thou not judge them for we have no might listen there's an enemy that we have no might against there are things that we have no control over there's diseases and things that we have no control over we can do the best we can but we have no power to flood it or to stop it and the best thing to do is just realize that in ourselves predominantly meaning in our flesh we have no power against this great company that cometh against us neither know we my god why don't you be honest why do you want to lie about it why don't you just tell it like it is we don't even know what to do we've done everything we know to do and we still don't know what to do but there's one thing we've we've got right we know where to look hallelujah our eyes are not cast down our eyes are turned to the hills to the mountains from where our help comes from our eyes are upon thee and all judah oh judah you remember who judah is don't you all judah stood before the lord with their little ones get your children in get your little ones into praise somebody told me the other day said we've been so dry so long and and just barely getting by and all of a sudden i call my my family's house and my little grandchildren running through the house praising god worshiping the lord and singing the holy ghost will set your feet to dance get them involved oh the critics have come here and had something to say about the little children running get them involved well i just don't think they understand it all they probably don't and you must not either there's a lot i don't understand yet either but let's get them to a place where they're not ashamed let's get them to a place where they're not embarrassed let's get them to a place where we don't have to break them out like we need to break some of you out but they just come knowing what's going to be when they get here we're going to praise the lord and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children lord jesus we come to you today thanking you that you have given us away you are a provided way for us lord even now you have provided a way out of depression and you have provided a way out of fear you have provided a way out of depression an oppression you have provided a way out of anxiety you've provided a way out and lord we want to thank you for that today and we want to come before you with a with a a real unified purpose and that is to give praise give worthy praise to a worthy god now lord we need you today i'm not the only one we need your action we need your anointing to press in a little bit today and we're depending on you now lord we're depending on you now lord come and help us may your name be glorified may people in this house their needs be ministered too lord and may everyone who is streaming this service may they also be ministered to in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen you may be seated i know that it's hard to stay focused when someone is reading long portions of scripture when you're seated but i gotta read a little more of this so will you try to stay with me best you can then upon yahazeal the son of zechariah the son of benanaya the son of jael the son of metania a levite of the sons of asaph came and you remember those sons of asaph don't you they were praisers they even wrote some of the psalms didn't they and so now they have come and upon them came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation my god is choosy about where he puts his spirit i'm very thankful that he put his spirit in the midst of this needy bunch of people that we're reading about now i'm very thankful that he came this morning and placed his spirit in the midst of a needy people because he said i tell you i feel something i might jump a pulpit here in a minute i don't i feel an unction hallelujah thank you lord we need it i need it and instead the spirit of the lord came in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye ah what verse all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude crowd multitude of enemies surrounding them don't be dismayed when you feel surrounded nor when you feel crowded in pressed in upon be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude i tell you this is too good for me to read how about you reading it for the la [Music] hallelujah you said doesn't take much for you to get excited about brother sister that's much that is much going into any battle into any trial into any tough situation in lie it's a glorious thing to know that the battle doesn't belong to you but you have connected to the god of battles and he knows how to win oh he knows how to win for the battle is not yours but gods let's read them through 19 now and tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of zis and you shall find them at the end of the brook between the wilderness of urel you you shall not need to fight oh oh oh oh oh oh there's going to be a war there's going to be a battle you're surrounded by a multitude get your eyes off the multitude the battle doesn't belong to you the battle belongs to the lord you can't fix your family troubles the battle's not yours the battles the lords if you get out of the way quit putting your two cents in take them out you're broke you need them take your two cents right back and say this does not belong to me this is the large battle he knows how to right the wrong hear the word of the lord said you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves give me just a tad more in this monitor if you will because my voice is straining a bit set yourselves i want to make sure you understand that's an e and not an eye it didn't say sipped yourself now it's easy to do that when we get weary but it didn't say sit in the easy chair or the lazy boy and expect things to turn out all right it says set yourself up find the proper posture for your life in times like this and position yourselves right there set set yourself tune yourself you're setting the station you're setting the channel you're making sure that you're in the right place doing the right thing having the right posture not looking at your circumstances the bigness of your problem but looking at the bigness of your god focused on it focused on him and he said set yourselves three words read hardest three were hardest three words for warriors fighting in the spirit is just what we do it's who we are we deal with things not in the natural like people like to do we deal with things in the spiritual because what we have learned is if you try to solve a problem that's spiritual in a carnal way and with carnal technique you'll make more damage cause more confusion and shut up the heavens the one thing we don't want to do in this hour is offend the holy spirit and shut up the heavens we want to keep the heavens open over our lives over this house over our family because we have needs and we don't know how great the need might be we don't know what might come we don't know what we might face we don't know how we might feel pinned in him then surrounded by an enemy army and so in that hour we're going to need to make sure that there are no dead cats on the line and that we're keeping everything all right and one of the things to remember in times like this is praise is always the right response there's never a time that praising god is not the right response might be a little awkward the phone call come granny has drawn her last breath might be a little awkward but your response should be as david's was the lord be praised the lord be glorified the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord it doesn't mean that we don't hurt it doesn't mean that we don't ache it doesn't mean that we don't understand the time but what it means is that praise and acknowledging the sovereignty of god through worship is always the right response you're never going to get in trouble giving god praise that he deserves can you help me a little bit you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourself make sure you're doing what you're supposed to do and then stand ye still don't get in god's way get out of your self-help book let the holy spirit lead you god didn't call this bride to be led forward by trinitarian theologian that's a little weak he didn't call his bride to be led forward by psychologists [Music] dr spocks he called his bride to be led forth by the spirit in the truth of the word you know brother branham said some powerful things about trying to divide the word from the spirit you can't do it you've got to have them both brother branham said if you take either the word or the spirit away from the people i'm paraphrasing now because i don't have the quote prepared he said if you take either the word or the spirit away from the people then you have to offer them some sort of substitute he said any form of substitution spells balaamism which is can be an illegal operation of a genuine gift you don't want that you don't want to try to illegally access a genuine gift you want to access it rightfully and legally by the course of heaven any mind with me and so this is what a lot of people have done they they have taken one and tried to leave the other the charismatic church has taken the spirit and tried to leave the word behind oh don't look at me like i don't know what i'm talking about i've been in their meeting i've sat in in their conferences and spoken at times with men who said it doesn't matter how you're baptized now is that not is that not taking away from the importance of the word didn't the word tell you how to be baptized your past folks on the way to church heading off to the baptist church or heading off to some denominational church somewhere and and i can't help in my mind but wonder how does somebody who has a revelation of jesus name baptism go sit in a lodge it's going to get quiet go sit in a lodge where god is divided into three pieces and where baptism is after the catholic church they do it because they're accepting one or the other and rejecting god's provided way and some are going to wake up and they're going to realize the hour that they're living in you know i i have friends around me who are saying to me often that that we are in the closing hours and i mean they said i'm not even saying days and months and year they've there are many friends and many people who believe the message of truth who are saying boldly that we are in the last hours of the coming of the lord that he is coming and that the rapture is closer that to us than we have ever even imagined that it was and you know what do you say i say be ready i say we better be ready for in such an hour as you think not i tell you it's not going to be the big the big announcement that a lot of people think it is so you can't take the word and just keep the gifts and the power and the spirit and the jerking and the and the goosebumps and the hair raising up and the sensations as brother branham would say you can't reject the word and take the oil in the hand and the blood in the hand you can't take some manifestation like gold dust or gold teeth or angel feathers or some of the things they talk about today you can't take that and reject the word and it is never a vindication of a man brother branham didn't need miracles to vindicate his ministry the vindication of his ministry was he stayed on the word and if you and i can stay on the word everything will be all right but you can't reject the spirit but you've got to have a taste of the original manna anybody listening boy i got to get to my notes but you've got to have a taste of the original manna every man who dare stand behind this sacred desk better know beyond the shadow of a doubt that he has tasted the original manna and not some kind of substitute or trusted in some kind of emotion or a feeling but he knows that he knows that he knows that he knows that he's had a taste of the original the holy ghost i'm telling you it's very very powerful and so what happens is some cling to the spirit and the gifts and the tongues and the feelings and then there are those and they reject the word don't matter what you believe they say oh doctrine i never been around people but i like this but was around some as i traveled not all of them but some of them as i traveled that doctrine was a curse word when i came around the message people some of them i found out that pentecost had become like a curse word and you had to be careful to justify it every time you said pentecost you had to make sure that you explained that you're talking about an experience and not a church or a denomination now i came around these folks and found out that the word doctrine has become a curse word and they see doctrine many of them as an obstacle something that stands in the way of spiritual freedom you know brother branham was a pretty smart man in the things of the spirit wasn't he because he actually saw a head he saw a day like this day where people would cling to the spirit and reject the word but he also said you can't take either one and reject the other they're together you take them together you receive together the word comes by the spirit the word is administered and appropriated and applied and delivered by the unction of the spirit or it's nothing but a dead dry letter produces more funerals than it does resurrections but you put the life with it i'm telling you you'll get a resurrection every now and again it's not all about funeral anymore it's about anaesthesias it's about a reproducible resurrection in the heart of a believer and that's what we're working toward anybody want to help me didn't mean to get into all that you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still see the salvation of the lord with you oh judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you well let's read on and joshua that bowed his head with his face to the ground humbled himself the leadership got down on the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshiping the lord now on the other hand of what i said just a moment ago you can't take the word and reject the spirit because the spirit prepares men's hearts to receive the word and the spirit helps to keep the church clean we got to have that we've got to have every administration of the spirit amen and the anointing is very very important because the anointing is not a feeling the anointing is not an emotion it doesn't even always sound the same i know people that try to discern the anointing by the sound it doesn't always sound the same sometimes it's like a lion on a hill roaring the word of the lord sometimes it's like a still small voice in the heart of a prophet be still be still be still but same same anointing same word same god same holy ghost no doubt about it joshua bowed his head to the ground with about his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshipping the lord what a great posture and the levites and the children of the coethites and the children of the korites stood up to praise the lord god of israel we're the whisper because we don't want to disturb their church mice we don't want to disturb the sanctity of the word we don't want to disturb the sanctity of the house let me tell you something i can't speak for every house but this house wasn't built to be a mortuary yesterday in my memories i saw a photo that nathan had posted years after when because when the church was built we we there wasn't much social media to be had but years later he posted a picture of the uh promises of god and the prophetic words that had been spoken over our lives and this ministry had been buried in the foundation of this new building and before the concrete the cement was poured god's precious word and his precious promises to us we're laid in the foundation of this house i don't take that lightly that's a pretty powerful promise we're standing on his truth we're standing on his word unmovable unshakable in uncertain times like this we have an anchor hallelujah and we're still believing for the full fruition of everything that god has said hallelujah are you awake everything that god has said you've got to remember sometime you've got promises to fight for well i'm just going to sit back and see how it goes you're not a warrior then well i'm not going to sit back and see how it goes because i know what the enemy can do he can he can cause the whole train to derail you're just sitting back not warring you've got a war sometime you've got to stand up for the promises of god you've got to intercede and pray you've got to call on angel help lord i need angels don't say i just don't know you okay sit back and hope to come sometimes i have to say lord i need you to sin some more amen i don't have to see them i just need to know that the that the hills around us are full of angels fighting for us hallelujah there's more fighting for us than fighting against us spiritual when i caught a vision a few week couple weeks ago i caught a vision of the spiritual nature of the war between russia and and ukraine i know a little bit about it in the natural and read a little bit and looked at the history of it a little bit and saw exactly uh in in in repeat of what has already happened but in the spiritual it looks totally different than it looks in the natural and it's a train all right it's a train coming down the tracks at breakneck speed fulfilling the word of the lord and every time a picture comes up in my feet of an old granny with a lap blanket on and a wheelchair being wheeled off the airplane as a ukrainian refugee coming home to israel my heart leaps within me no wonder i got friends that say we're living in the last hours before the rapture we don't really believe that because if we did we'd be certainly living different in our private and personal life and it would certainly make a difference when we come together in the corporate world in the corporate church as a corporate body corporate body wouldn't it sure it would now let's read um they stood up to praise the lord the god of israel with a loud voice on high and that was verse 19. let's go to verse 20. you're still with me my my mind this is a very very long reading isn't it now we're going to read 20 to 30 10 more verses they rose early in the morning and went for and i'm not doing that because i don't have notes i've got plenty of notes and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper let me tell you this any man or woman who's willing to acknowledge that god sent a prophet that brother branham is a prophet sent from god any man who's willing to swim woman a two that's willing to swim against the tide of popular opinion and swim against the tide of google searches and recognize in their heart not because mama said it or daddy said it but come to their own revelation and understanding and you believe the message that he brought as it lays in the absolute foundation of the word you are promised a prosperity that the world can never offer you believe his pr but don't miss the s don't miss the ass because god still speaks believe his prophets saw and this particular verse doesn't distinguish between one whose ministry is prophesied in the word and one who's not it doesn't distinguish between what they like to call a word prophet in a new testament or an old testament prophet and a new testament prophet there was no new testament here of course i understand that but it just says but and only one prophet was prophesying to joshua but the s is here believe is prophet so shall ye prosper it's like revelation 10 where they where they get that s a little mixed up sometime put the s in the wrong place when they're preaching revelation 10 don't do that understand that god knows exactly where his children are today he knows exactly how to reach him with his word he's doing it in profound ways so believe his prophets and so shall you prosper the king is decreeing and declaring this over the people let's read on and when he had consulted with the people he appointed cannons catapults what kind of king is this he was looking for the opera singers bring in the singers and he appointed singers unto the lord they sang for a solid 55 minutes this morning did we stop at 55 you go back in time and on the stream because if we stopped at 55 we'll do 60 next time if god is in it there's only one limit here and that's the mind of god let the mind of god limit it no disrespect to three songs no disrespect sometimes that's all you need amen but let me tell you something god himself knows the importance of what singing does you like i said last sunday you don't even have to be able to sing the same you just start making melody in your heart and it starts coming out your mouth come on now and what an atmosphere so the king said i'm going to put this in order here and i'm going to first thing i'm going to do is i want you you you and you i know how olivia got up there out here the last time i wouldn't got her and i did it under the inspiration of the holy spirit and i didn't know that brother greeley was standing over there in the corner hidden and interceding for them as they as they sung i didn't know that and i felt bad a little bit as i as i did in fact i said to brother greeley later i didn't do that to get her away from your prayer i didn't even see you there i did that because i could feel the enemy and i wanted to show the enemy by the way the enemy doesn't wear britches or a skirt i'm not talking about people don't you dare misunderstand that i don't know how she got up here today i was back there praying you brought her somebody said i just don't like one being elevated over the other or or stuck out there in front of the other even one person said i don't think we need three backup singers one of the churches that i i listen to sometime i ain't going to talk about it because it's not a message church and i know that some people think nothing good could ever go on in a church that wasn't a message church but it keeps me going many times they keep me going and you know what they come out there's about 10 or 12 13 14 of them they're not they're backing nobody they're they're leading away boy sometimes i get excited they call it a team and i've heard people even around the messages say praise team you ought to be careful don't you know the word don't you know that jehoshaphat got up that day he didn't just say all right who wants to sing the bible said he appointed singers unto the lord he did it with leadership he did it with strategy because there was a war there was a war that had to be won and this time it wasn't going to be one with swords it was going to be one with songs ain't that good isn't that great it sure is oh he said he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness holiness i believe in holiness but the holiness i believe in is his and the only holiness you've got is the one he lets you have he puts that on you now i've already spoken recently about modesty and i believe in modesty i believe the church women of this world would be better served and would better serve the kingdom of god if they would dress more appropriately in his house and out there in the world and they would be doing it if it wasn't for part of that women's lib thing you know that gets up and says the man is responsible because they believe the woman gets blamed for everything so they say that the man is the one that is responsible but brother branham came and put that in balance and he said clearly that a woman who showed her underneath garments it's quiet he said a woman that showed her underneath garments that means foundations that means things that are underneath to serve you not for me to see where will he go where will he go where will he go that means every strap every clasp every bit of it it's underneath garment people shouldn't be walking around with their underwear showing right he said if they if you do that if you go out and you're and you've got your underneath garment showing and he said that right there is enough then a man see that lust in his heart you're going to be also held responsible just telling you the balance you don't believe that do you brother shelly i certainly do [Music] now a man ought to know his limitations he ought to know what belongs to him and what doesn't belong to him he ought to be especially a godly man a church man ought to be able to control his urges and deal with his lust right i believe that with all my heart because it's not it's not we're not immune to it here i've seen men watch women go down the aisle that didn't belong to them right here because men are men and women are women and human nature it's human nature and so everybody's got to deal with that amen so a sister needs to tuck it in covered up amen and a man you need to control your eyes women too thank you they're preaching in the pews now ain't it the truth because it's my place to handle the word and not a sister i'm going to repeat what it was saying because i believe it's absolutely the truth a man should also not and let me tell you something sister it don't have to just be skinny jeans i've seen men in full cut jeans that needed a bigger size so it's not just about how the legs look it's about the whole whole thing and so that's right if you find yourself dressing that way to attract attention somebody said i do that for my wife well your wife is not the only one out there or i do that for my husband your husband is not the one i don't even think these things ought to be preached well folks too bad because we're living in an hour where we have to be reminded you say amen owe me whatever you need to say all right now when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord that they should praise the beauty of holiness and holiness is not something that can be legislated i would like to say one more thing while we're on the subject and that is the scripture that we look to in deuteronomy 22 and 5 is not distinguishing particularly or exclusively between a skirt or a pair of pants it says pertains to i've seen women in combat boots i've seen women in shoes that look like men's shoes and men and shoes that look like women's shoes there are things that we need to be thoughtful of in a wicked hour like the one we're living in now it says pertains to so you let the holy spirit direct you and lead you and he will you mad at me i didn't hear anybody say yes that don't mean they're not does it it's true anyhow praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army before the army before the army before the army and here's what the singers are to do say praise the lord for his mercy and do it forever talk about vain repetition praise the lord first mercy and do it forever praise the lord for his mercy and doeth the river praise the lord verse mercy and dirt forever praise the lord verse mercy and death forever praise the lord verse of mercy under favor judah first praise the lord for his mercy and death forever praise the lord first mercy and death forever then the army comes behind and they were ready to do battle they were ready to do the bloody stuff but praise went first praise had to go first praise has to go first praise has to be preeminent in an hour like that got to go forward got to go first i tell people praise before you pray jesus did our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name he came praising before he came petitioning never gonna go wrong with that let's read on i gotta hurry and when they began to begin to sing and to praise the lord i'ma look around now and see who's sleeping the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon and moab and mount seer which will come against judah and they were there were some angels doing war there were some holy god ambushments that were set against those enemies that brought destruction and it wasn't because judah had a mighty army it was because the right protocol was was used praise went first praise the lord for his mercy and do it forever hallelujah for his mercy and death forever first mercy and do it forever let's read on a little bit more all the way to 30. uh yeah 30. and when they began to sing i'll do this one again and when they began to sing and to praise the lord the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which are come against judah and they were smitten for the children of ammon and moab stood against the inhabitants of mount seir what to slay utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seer everyone helped too you see what the lord did he blocked their path he blocked their plans he confused their their their military strategies their generals got confused everybody got confused they didn't know what to do next they are not used to a singing shouting dancing praising army if they'd have come out there ready to do battle they'd have met him right down towing the line but they did not know what to do with the people that wouldn't do anything until they praise the lord i'm telling you the world around you are you with me the world around you doesn't know what to do with somebody that meets every situation by praising the lord they don't know what to do with somebody that praises the lord in every situation you know at all times no matter what the enemy tries to do they don't know what to do with you all right let's read on and when judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness they looked under the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escaped every enemy slain because they slayed themselves they put themselves god's the people praised god set ambushments the people killed one another enemy against enemy they defeated each other fell all of them none escaped let's read on and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away [Music] praise releases abundance [Applause] it does it releases abundance it releases favor more than they could carry away and they and they were what three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much wasn't god good he just delivered the riches right into their hands by setting ambushments against the enemy and causing them to destroy themselves let's read on and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of baracha for there they blessed the lord that's the valley of blessing for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of barack unto this day glory glory let's read on and then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem [Music] how'd they go for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies [Music] here they are praising the lord and the lord turned their praise in such a manner that they were rejoicing over their enemies and getting their pockets filled with spoil and they came to jerusalem with psalter the church of christ wouldn't like this they came with musical instruments how worldly sultries and harps and trumpets now trumpet is not a soft instrument salt trees and harps and trumpets but they knew better than to disturb the sanctity of the house of the lord so they did this all in the parking lot they had a pavilion they pitched a tent and they sung praises outside and played the trumpets and harps and had a great time but when they come into the house of the lord they all folded their hands and waited for the preacher no that's not what it says at all the joy that brought them down from the battlefield went with them into the house of god you hear me anybody hear me what they had just seen the lord do then they didn't come to church and sit on their hands stuff their mouth they brought that joy all the way in to the house of the lord and begin to play these instruments unto god read on the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of these countries those countries when they had heard that the lord fought the lord fought the lord fought the lord fought the lord fought against the enemies of israel and all they did was praise all they did was set themselves with the right heart or right attitude a right spirit they let god do the fighting now they they were very much involved they fought with the song they fought by declaring the word of god by declaring the word of the lord hallelujah and when the enemies around and the countries that surrounded they began to hear that the lord fought against the enemies of israel i want you to know it changed a lot of people's opinions didn't it is that the last one no we got one more don't we so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet wouldn't that be lovely oh it wasn't for you you wouldn't like a little quiet wouldn't you like four or five days without battle without opposition without fighting something through in the spirit without getting whacked upside the head in the spirit world not knowing what it's all about wondering what you're going through and what somebody else is going through and i reached out to somebody this week and i said i know that we had a we had an appointment to speak in a few days but i can't take it anymore i need to speak to you now because you're you're getting heavy and i'm getting tired of carrying you like this load is heavy and i believe i can get some of this lifted if we just speak them in it and you know god gave us an opportunity to do that and and it helped relieve some of that pressure because god will lay an assignment on you and it'll consume you anybody understand it will consume you somebody thanks me for watching in prayer but i want to tell you that the truth is there were there were many watchmen on the wall with me last night in that good the goodness of god and the provision of god that we didn't have to pray it alone but others were also praying maybe some didn't even know why when we started talking about not sleeping well last night or not getting much rest over others who might not have even known the intensity of the battle or what was really going on but many said i didn't rest well either it's just because things get stirred up in that other dimension and in that other realm and that's why the prayers that that go forth from this house and from this property are very very vital and important prayers so those of you that have been meeting weekly and and praying in the parking lot or wherever you find your assignment on this property thank you for doing that and and the prayer chapels are there and even during renovation you could go into the sisters brother greeley told you that even though there's some storage in there because the men's uh it's cleaned out but but you don't have to be yesterday was the day you didn't have to be locked inside to pray it was so beautiful outside and every time you send a prayer up it helps to ease some of that load and some of that burden and what we call some of that swirl that takes place because when god's people pray there are armies that are activated in both realms when god's people pray i hear sister anita as i said that i can hear her song praise puts him out of his mind so what are we doing praise him for the victory praise him for the victory the weapons that we use are not bombs and guns worship is the way that the battle is won oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] we were blessed uh tuesday night by the ministry of brother caleb amen and i've been getting that text every day i'm an overcomer hold up your hand i'm an overcomer look back everybody look back brother caleb told her to text me every day and say i'm an overcomer i got one tuesday night i got one wednesday got one thursday got one friday got one saturday have you sent mine yet today good i just missed it she done sent me one today i'm an overcomer i'm an overcomer yes you are darling yes you are yes you are yes you are an overcomer yes you are you can overcome because he has [Music] you can overcome all the opposition of the enemy before the service today norah millie and uh tally were in the office there right at the end before they come out before so we can pray and they were back there in the office and nora said look pastor he said i've got a new dance for praise and i come i come around the desk and i said let me do it with you i got one too [Applause] then i looked at her and i said how did you know i was going to preach on dancing she looked at me kind of shocked i said did the holy spirit tell you that pastor was going to preach on dancing she said yes you say you ought not to prompt her to say something like that well sunday after sunday after sunday after sunday after sunday after sunday she's in there and she never said i got a new dance for praise today to worship god with today never said that before she said it on the day now i can't help it if i've preached on the foundation and hadn't gotten to the dance but it's coming hallelujah i don't have but a few minutes left this morning but i'll be here again praise god praise god praise the lord amen amen amen amen i want to go to thirst again thirst thirst whoa i know i know in i know i ought to not read it again because of the time that i have but i'm going to read it again one more time one more time today wait till that satisfaction comes the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the holy spirit comes in then these joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit will come you won't have to do it by the music praise be to god you will do it when you're going down the road in your car you'll do it when you're sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving nails in the wall with your carpenter work wherever you are [Applause] the joy unspeakable and full of glory hallelujah in a message called the seven church ages 1954 paragraph 73 stay with me i know you're tired now as god poured out the manna there in the natural and it lasted as long as they were in the journey a beautiful type and the day they entered the promised land the manna ceased and on the day of pentecost the same thing read on look at pentecost to moses from pentecost to moses they looked back and they seen the enemy was dead and what happened miriam can anybody find me a tambourine we got one in here somewhere it used to be in the somebody got one here oh brother brooks go get brother brooks it's anointed brought brother brooks at tambourine and he signed it for us we were going to send it home with him and let him bring it back he forgot he was the first year he come and he said no you just leave that there for me i'll be back so it stays right there on the shelf so that when he needs it he can come right back and use it it'll be here for him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah love you all for such a gift new hope thanks from brother isaiah brooks isn't that wonderful miriam grab a tambourine and begin to beat it [Music] very dignified but brother she didn't just scream she screamed beat the tambourine and danced and ran down the bank think about it just think about it the women followed her and they were doing the very same thing oh i guess i can do it all i don't know if i'm that coordinated or not glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory that's what they did that is what they did what they did and brother branham wasn't out of the word he was talk taken quoting just what the word said exodus 15 20. and miriam the prophetess [Music] better not touch that with the 10-foot pole let's let's you think only men can prophesy you think only men can hear the word of the lord then we'd be in trouble in this house i don't believe that only men can have the word of the lord neither did brother annam he mentioned sister argan bride he mentioned several in the church that had the gift of interpretation when tongues are interpreted he said that becomes prophecy i understand there's a difference in the gift of prophecy and the and the office of a prophet i totally understand that but here is a a woman a sister who who was not perfect she got in some big trouble didn't she but this day this day the joy of the lord overwhelmed her and the word of the lord began to pour out of her mouth and even moses the staunch prophet of god even moses began to sing a spiritual song one that had never been sung before whoa my my my my my well that was all testament praise doesn't know a difference between old testament and new testament [Applause] just like that quote i read you a minute ago from thirst is 1965 september the 19th 1965 so evidently speaking in tongues does not know an exploration in 1963 i know everybody didn't get that but for those of you who know you know tongues didn't expire when the word was revealed joy bells didn't expire when the word was revealed dancing before the lord didn't expire i don't see here where the spirit of god moved on miriam and all she could do was dance i don't see where god jerked her around and then and we can say that the spirit of the lord took charge and took control and she had no choice the word just doesn't say that it says in miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances i know what people say i'm closing after a while i know what people say they say that's jewish culture mighty interesting to me that on the day of pentecost there were a lot of gentiles gathered there and they must have learned the hebrew culture in a hurry because when the holy ghost fell on them they start staggering around like drunk men speaking in other tongues just tell them what the word said it wasn't a purty dance like miriam's but it was a dance none the same because they couldn't hold their selves up steady because that which had been prophesied oh who could contain the joy of knowing that you're living in a day when the word of the lord has been fulfilled that'll make everybody have a little joy to know that you're living in the consummation of the ages that the word is restored and revealed and made known that didn't ought to make anybody get a little happy with it oh back to the quote thank you the women followed her doing the same thing and moses threw up his hands and sang in the spirit stay with me stay with me just stay with me i'm moses see my finger i'm praising it got so good that the preacher got involved the prophet couldn't keep himself oh i wish you'd look at me like you don't like me because i got a quote for you he couldn't help himself it wasn't just miriam's enemy floating in the water it was the enemy of all israel [Applause] oh i believe anybody that could see the devil floating in the pond would get excited about it [Music] if you could realize that he is defeated [Applause] you'd find a spring in your step hallelujah hallelujah and moses go back uh moses threw up his hands and sang in the spirit and we've got some of the we got some of the words of the song of moses it's in the bible we know some of the things that moses sung in prophetic praise oh hallelujah to the lamb thank you i'll read on now 75 at pentecost 120 million brother branham says the women come out staggering i don't know where they was they must have been peeking in the windows and got under the inspiration they must have been like them old drunks at azusa street that used to get down like this and peer in the lock holes of the old door of the old livery stable so they could look in and see them pentecostals jerking around in time after i feel the holy ghost and time after time after time after time the spirit of god would come right through that keyhole any good any good god didn't send the holy ghost to keep him in a box god didn't send the holy ghost to lock it up in the upper room either he didn't send the holy ghost to keep it in azusa street he sent the holy ghost to let it go out and go out and go out and bring in those that the spirit is calling three 000 in one day go get them holy ghost go get them holy ghost go get them so somewhere the women was around they come out staggering and jumping that is definitely not ladylike they were jumping like olympic jumpers whoa glory be to god you know how brother came in and kind of made a lot of the kangaroo anointing you just let me be a kangaroo because i understand there was kangaroos on the day of pentecost because the prophet who had the mind of god he could look all the way back and describe the scene you either believe that or you don't i do and here's what he said they were staggering and jumping and dancing and what is carrying on me i don't know what that means carrying on peter stood up in the midst of them and recognize this isn't trash this isn't wildfire this is not a bunch of maniacs this isn't people who despise the word or reject the message well they might have been pentecostal babies they could have been because you got to be a baby before you can walk hallelujah but there's a few things you don't want to lose as you mature you don't want to lose your praise you don't want to trade your freedom for dignity just have dignity with your freedom boy i wish i wished i was where you are and somebody was preaching this to me i mean that i wish you and i were swapped places you were preaching this and i was out there showing you how to amend it you men of judea and you that dwell in jerusalem let this be known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk you be careful what you say you stream a service and you see something that you don't understand or like you be careful what you say for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it's the third hour of the day this is that which was spoken of by the prophet joel it shall come to pass in the last days saith god a out my spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] god [Music] i'll pour out my spirit on what [Applause] on what [Applause] oh inner man soul and spirit no all flesh god's not picking and choosing he's pouring his spirit out on all flesh you don't have anything to react to that with but the body he give you to react in and if god didn't want body praise his book of psalms could be plucked out of the word because the book of psalms talks about praise and every time it mentions praise it gives you a physical posture every time and i know we gravitate to the ones that make us the most comfortable or the ones we're most used to but there's nine davidic forms of praise and you need to broaden your horizon a little bit you need to expand your genre just a little bit and you need to learn there's more than one way to praise his name and to give him glory hallelujah now in closing closing two i am going to read two quotes because i want you to know that you cannot trust in a feeling or in a sensation or just in some kind of reaction to guide you there's only one thing to stand your life on and that's not a feeling because feelings come and feelings go i feel like praising him i don't feel like praising him i feel like praising him i don't feel like praising him you know my philosophy on that there's only two times to praise the lord anyhow when you feel like it when you don't feel like it and if you really want to help from god praise him when you don't feel like it praise him when you feel like napping praise him when you feel like quitting make a sacrifice of praise take your tongue off your off your sores quit licking your sores scrape them with a pot sheared so they'll bleed out all the corruption let god put some healing on your source you jump up from there and bless the name of the lord you jump up in there from there and say i've sat on this ash heap long enough i'm gonna get up here that i had a pen of iron sounds like praise to me that i could write these words i know i know i know my redeemer living amen it's better than a nerve pill praise will do you better than that but i want to read these two quotes because i know what people say i know how they talk i'm going to read them both and i want you to notice the dates i'm going to be fair about this because i think it's only right the first one is improving his word los angeles california we were putting together a collection of quotes sometime back and they asked me do we have to put where it was preached and i said no no i guess that don't really matter but the spirit of the lord kind of quickened my heart a little bit later and i don't ever take a quote off the off the table without typing in my notes where it was preached because i believe it matters i believe it matters i believe a prophet could tell a lot about the atmosphere of a city and i believe he presented things sometimes in a certain way because he understood the spirit that was over that region and over that area you watch carefully the things brother branham said over los angeles watch it carefully because every bit of it will come to pass before this thing's over you watch carefully the things that brother branham said in jeffersonville because the biggest the biggest uh multitude and gathering of demon spirits in any city in the nation for many years was jeffersonville indiana and the reason for that is because there were more demons being cast out of people in jeffersonville because he was there most often there were more demons being cast out in that city than any other city in the country so they like to gather there and you'll hear him say things you'll hear him say things about demonology that he said right there that he didn't say anywhere else in the message because there was a gathering of spirits there with a certain nature about them that he could recognize as one who saw into that other dimension so i noticed that this was preached in los angeles california he said and in the wilderness when many of them come out dancing in the spirit when miriam beat the tambourine eating manna out of heaven listen that moses sing in the spirit watching the miracles and signs go forth but here's the balance but when it come to a showdown to believe the whole word of god all the promise read it they failed you cannot afford i cannot afford to be that person what you've heard today just now i'm not bragging on myself i don't deserve it but what you've just heard so far today is a balance because i've preached to you the importance of praise the liberty of dance the way that we should express ourselves to the lord brother branham said in september september the 19th 1965 the joy bells the full experience the holy ghost speaking in tongues all of that 65. then i've come here now to tell you that when it came to a showdown those that danced in the spirit and those that prophesied and those that sung in the spirit everyone when it come time to make make a full decision for the whole whole word of god all the promise they failed you and i cannot afford to be those people somebody said what's brother i'm talking about first corinthians chapter 10 they all ate the same spiritual meat they all drank the same spiritual drink verse 5 but with many of them god was not well pleased so you can never take your sensation your feeling your rejoi whatever you get whatever you have it's liberty liberty my god i'm not selling it i'm not giving it away i'm holding on to my freedom i'm holding on to my liberty i'm going to encourage you to have some but you're not getting mine there's nothing i don't know anything i haven't found anything in this message that told me i shouldn't shout i shouldn't praise the lord i shouldn't speak in tongues i hadn't found any of that he said when you get the completion of it they'll be speaking in tongues said it so so i haven't found it but i believe it's only right to bring the balance he bragged on miriam many many many times bragged on what they were doing up and down that river he he didn't say anything here critical about what they were doing then he just called our minds to the attention to to to remember that when this thing come down to a showdown and it's true nothing could be more true you can't meet the devil at the end of this thing the final test is not going to be whether you danced or whether you spoke in tongues or whether you had a shiver up your spine the final test is going to be the word test have you accepted the full word of god for your day and will you stand on that and not compromise amen it is a man i wanted to bring that i want to bring uh the next paragraph is short he said only two of them believed it out of all of israel only two of them believed it it was joshua and caleb why don't you be a joshua why don't you be a caleb why don't you make up your mind i'm going to be one of them that don't give up i'm not giving up my freedom to worship i'm not giving up my shout i'm not giving up my joy unspeakable and full of glory i'm not giving up my dance i'm not going to give up talking in tongues but i am going to make sure that when the word comes i'm going to be a joshua and the caleb i don't believe this church will ever be filled i don't believe that all of these promises and prophecies and things that were spoken will ever come to pass i believe it'll always be like it always was you believe what you want to believe but i might stand over your grave why would you say a thing like that because i'm telling you what happened in that story god dealt with every one of those naysayers who said the giants are there and we can't take it we'll never be able to make it come on you know the the one thing the jewish people they remember that every year they commemorate this whole season of of how those uh uh spies rejected and gave a bad report and and spread a negative report about what they saw i mean really they were being as honest as they could be at the moment but they were forgetting who's god they were who's god who who their god was and who they represented and they weren't there just to see it from the negative they were there to see it from all aspects and they came back and said we'll never they're they're bigger we're like grasshopper which was a terrible exaggeration but we're like little grasshoppers all they have to do just look at us we die but two come back and they said we are well you be the joshua somebody hear the word of the lord you'll be a caleb you'll be a joshua you'll be one of them that says we can if god said it that settles it he will perform his word he will take us through the turning of the corner he will fill up like he said he would and deliver like he said he would he's not a god that he should lie and they brought back the evidence [Music] one time i was was prophesied over me by by a pastor that had come out of pentecost into this message many years before i was born and he said thus saith the lord like a joshua and caleb you have gone across over into the promised land and you had no intention or desire to come back empty-handed and it is your burden and vision to bring something back to prove how good it is over there may god give me the grace to fulfill such a commission i want to do that with all my heart i want to tell you there's a good land over there and i can't tell you they're not wall cities because there are and i can't tell you they're not giants because they're there but i can tell you this if you'll sell out if you'll surrender everything you have to the lord we are well able to take the land if you believe that same man if we can only do that and the last one i didn't really get to preach on dancing come back i'm going to i'm going to that's what i struggled over last week when i told you that i had struggled all day because i was going to jump into the to the dancing part of this and i wasn't able to do it and until i until i heard the inspiration send judah first so we'll get to it but i want to read this and and i may read one more and then we'll go this is jesus keeps all his appointments paragraph 258 only and how many of you believe he does brother branham said don't make that mistake don't you trust in speaking in tongues for the holy ghost but listen some of you are reading ahead he said holy ghost speaks in tongues you'll find him saying that anybody that receives the baptism of the holy ghost at some time or another they will i believe that i believe he's right i believe he's right when he said it i don't believe it's the initial evidence and i don't believe that somebody has the holy ghost because they speak in tongues because demons can do that i've seen it demons can do that you anybody can mimic that but i believe when you receive the genuine baptism of the holy ghost it will produce the fruits of jesus christ in your life and at some time or another you'll you'll be blessed by the gift of being able to speak in tongues he said but don't you trust that to see a bikini on saturday and a dress on sunday and speaking in tongues he said don't trust that don't trust that drunk on saturday night and speaking in tongues in church on sunday morning don't trust that no no no no no but don't you trust that in doing the things that you're doing dancing in the spirit some kind of a sensation you see what brother branham was so against is people thinking that because they could do that they were right or because they could do that they had the holy ghost there's no substitution it the fact is it's the life able to live the word of god that's the evidence that the holy ghost is there but but because he said it this way so many people thought he was against these things that's why we can show you these other quotations to prove to you he wasn't against any of it he was against trusting it oh oh i got to get this i got to bring the balance brother read i have to i know there are people who believe that because they speak in tongues or because they prophesy or because they dance in the spirit or because they praise like a wild man that they have the holy ghost i want you to know that's not evidence of the holy ghost it's more than that you believe that now i want to be the balance hear me now well those people who go around and say i know i have the holy ghost because i believe brother branham is a prophet i couldn't believe brother branham was a prophet unless i had the holy ghost that's not right you're just as deceived as the one who thinks his jerking and sensation and moving around gives him the holy goal you're just as deceived you can believe that william branham is the greatest prophet that ever lived in the last church age messenger and all the things that you want to say about him and still not have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost somebody said i don't believe that's possible the bible said it is the bible said demons believe in tremble i want you to know if you could interview the devil today if you had an opportunity to ask the devil was william branham a prophet if you were to ask the devil okay some of you is getting a little touchy if you were to ask the devil was jack cole a mighty servant of god who had a gift of bulldog faith if you asked the devil that what do you think he'd say oh no he was a bluff oh no that's what the devil told jack cole but the devil would have to tell you the truth he'd probably tell he sure was yeah i tried everything i could do to stop him right all the things we know negative things you could say about oral roberts but if you were to ask the devil did he have a gift of faith did he serve a purpose was he sent from god the devil had to say the truth if you you know you might have pinned him down but the devil knows my point is the devil knows so if you could get the devil to be honest for a second you know it's like good luck with that but if you could pin him down he believes in trembles all the demons believe and tremble the devil knows he recognized he saw he didn't blind it anymore he wants there were a lot of things he didn't know he knows it he's got it he blinds our minds sometimes the god of this world blinds people's minds from seeing the reality right we have to pray about that being lifted and broken don't we but if the enemy if the devil was forced and could you give him a good shot of tooth serum or something and he had to tell the truth he would tell you without any hesitation that william branham was a prophet sent from god because he believes it he saw it he was an eyewitness now if what people say about i have the holy ghost because i believe brother branham i know i have the holy ghost because i believe brother bran was a prophet then the devil has the holy ghost if the sa if that reasoning could carry all the way over then you could say the enemy has a holy ghost now we will tell you what the prophet said if you never heard him he said if the devil were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he'd be born again repent of his sin and straighten out his life he'd be born again he said did no longer be the devil he'd be your brother somebody said i don't believe that's going to happen neither do i but you know what he's talking about what he was talking about the power of the blood the power of obeying the word it works somebody said works [Applause] you're just preaching a lot of things lately yeah because i realize that there's somebody out there somebody's listening somebody needs to hear some things and wants to hear some things hallelujah god bless you in belgium god bless you sister in berlin sister martina our old friend our

the folks are gonna let me cause they love me pardon i got some more to go with this but i'm going to read this one and then the next time i preach on and come up here about oh no no no no let me not do pardon hmm can't they're long everlasting life and how to receive it paragraph 146 about 15 years ago tonight i was standing on this platform here with a big chart teaching my it's interesting there was a little pentecostal group come from louisville and i never did believe in them people dancing the way they did you see brother branham was a independent baptist not pentecostal originally he wanted to preserve the dignity i'm just i'm not putting words in his mouth there's three quotes here and i'll only read one but i will share the others and there was a little lady come up here to play the piano and they was going to play a special and beat on a little thimbles thimbles on a washboard you know what a thimble is a little protector over your fingertip to keep your needle from piercing your finger you know what a washboard is half of us have never held a washboard they put thimbles on their fingers and bring that washboard to church and stroke it like this not very baptist not very dignified they're more pentecostals from louisville wrong side of the river they come over here to jeffersonville messing everything up there come a little lady up there to play the piano they was going to play a special thimble's on a wash board and some of them beat on a tin can i don't know how that sounds i don't know how to do that i was very much listen no no no no no i was very much a critic of that of it so i thought what's going to happen and the woman came up to play the special she got to playing the lady got to beating on the washboard this little blonde headed girl jumped out of here on the floor and began to dance in the spirit [Applause] and me what did the word say do not sit in the seat of the scornful but brother branham was a human being a man just a man chosen by god he had the same reactions that we have sometimes people screaming in here waving flags and hollering and telling people who can pray and who can't all the things we do sometimes and he said me sitting in the seat of the scornful he said now i said now i wish you would look at that and i had been telling my church till they was all wondering what i was going to do about it just showing you want you to get it here's brother branham sitting he's thinking this is my now i'm i'm telling you something but it's not in this quote it's in another quote i'll read them all for it's over but he in one of the quotes he said this is my tabernacle he said this is my tabernacle i'm not going for such as that in here so he's sitting over there in the seat of the scornful and here's a blonde headed girl she's done gone to dancing and granny and somebody's beating on a tin can no funeral home music playing cause you cannot play the the washboard to funeral home music it was probably something like everybody will be happy over there come on and he said now i wish you'd look at that and everybody in the church looking at brother branham waiting on him because he'd been preaching on the spirit it gives the spirit and things of the spirit he said you know we're just seeking the lord to see how to handle that here he was looking for answers because you know when you get mixed up you're a baptist preacher you get mixed up with pentecost you've got to decide how much of that you're going to let go on in your meetings he said it i'm telling you what he said i just went through i just went through every quote i could find of brother branham in a preaching on the gifts of the spirit meant talking about the gifts of the spirit he was struggling to find the proper balance because he had a problem there in jeffersonville like no other he had to deal with some stuff because the people were constantly interrupting the preaching with supposed gifts he said in me sitting in the seat of the scorpio i said now i wish you would look at that and i've been what about you musicians making your way this way would you and i have been telling my church till they was all wondered what i was going to do about it i'm sure they were already imagining brother branham coming to the pulpit and saying now listen here we don't have such tummy rot in here we don't have such carrying on in here they're expecting that he was trying to formulate how he was going to handle it he said i kept looking at her and i thought look at that now if that isn't something listen to what he said making a tavern out of my church now let me just clarify this and help you to understand something here had brother branham been raised in a pentecostal church dancing in a service would have been very common for him but he wasn't his upbringing was independent baptist so for him his only concept of dancing was the ger like the girl that brother branham talks about often who who got healed and what did she do she wanted to go back to the taverns and dance with her dance partner and win the contest so his concept of dancing was what goes on in the in the juke joint or the honky tonk but had he been raised in the pentecostal church he wouldn't have had quite the same reaction because he would have been used to that happening at least occasionally but he was not reacting well this is his confession no one is criticizing him we're just reading what he said he said making a tavern out of my church and i was sitting there what not knowing any better i wasn't saying nothing but in my heart nothing out loud but in my heart i was thinking it you still with me so i watched her there while she was dancing just whatever she was doing he remembered she had blonde hair he said the first thing you know i said now wait a minute let's look at this by the word we can't look at this by the church we were raised in that's not a proper measuring stick we've got to look at this by the word not always fun but it's always right he said i wonder if that lady's got any scripture for that and i begin to think about the scriptures i said where was dancing ever ordained at the first place in the bible that's right and i thought what made them dance sometimes he kind of said dance i seen the children of israel [Music] when they cross the red sea maryam look back oh my god help me miriam look back and seen all those task masters drowned i wonder if they recognized one that had beat them on the back harassed them mocked them shamed them drove them beat them locked them up and now they're floating in the water when she looked and saw all those seen all them taskmasters drowned she picked up a tambourine see she had not been raised in the independent baptist church dance was a regular expression of praise to god for the hebrew people they danced in egypt they worshipped somebody said how do you know that you wasn't there i'll tell you how i know it because i know how they celebrated the feast in the concentration camps of auschwitz and birknow and all the rest i know that if they kept the feast and celebrated the festivals of the lord under hitler's threat in concentration camps i guarantee you they celebrated the goodness of god over there in egypt before he revealed all those things to him what they were supposed to do i guarantee you they had some times she picked up a tambourine and began to dance and beat this tambourine and run down the shores dancing not by herself i i just i'll just be honest with you i hate to see anybody praising the lord by themselves something in me wants to help them i know they're not doing it for me but when i see somebody alone trying to press in it just makes me want to jump up and press in with them for them because of them and beat the timber of this tamarind run down the shores dancing and the daughters of israel followed her dancing i thought reread it just a minute just a minute making my church a tavern i'm not going to have that in here a few seconds later that's victory the holy ghost will override your opinion if you'll let him you take it back to the word and if it doesn't meet the word if it doesn't match the word you're wrong he said i thought that's victory whoa that's victory he said when david slew in that the next one no sorry wrong wrong quote he said if you don't like that oh sorry 151 i seen david he's just taken a stroll they're dancing he's thinking holy spirit's just taken him at least you're not in the seat of the scornful anymore he's letting god reveal the word to him indeed i'm tired he said i seen david when his sweetheart sitting up there behind this van a fanning looking at her cute little boyfriend david standing out there and here comes the ark that brother graham talked about a while ago coming across the hill that would probably be graham snelling wouldn't it maybe because he was at the where he was at the tabernacle he said coming across the hill when david seen it coming he danced you looked at me funny the other day brother venom said he danced around and around and around [Music] come on hallelujah why she said why why why she said you embarrass me let's read on he said if you don't like that he just quote he just gives us the scripture i'm done nearly if you don't like that watch this and around and around and around he went again he said you know what god god god looked down out of heaven and said david you're a man [Music] [Applause] you want to know what god thinks about a man dancing somebody said well the holy ghost come and jerked him up and made him dance that is not what the scripture said when he saw the ark when he saw the ark when he saw the ark coming up the road coming home coming home coming back home he jumped up and began to dance before the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah david you're a man after my own heart you ever want to know what god thinks about a man you a michael christian you want to know what god thinks about you david you're a man michael you're a man after my own heart because you do it whether you feel it or not you do it whether you're good at it or not and i'm not saying you're not good at you've got a lot of practice service after service after service after service after service after service sister jeffrey when he first started he stumbled over his own feet but he did it and if anybody knows him they know that that awkwardness that he carries sometime it took everything he could muster but he overcame it that's right that's right that's right that's right [Applause] was that dancing in the spirit it was dancing before the spirit it was dancing before the lord i'm sure there were times he felt the spirit of god fall on him but it wasn't all about a feeling it was about doing what i can to bring myself under submission and subjection to the great holy ghost because i want him to talk to me and i want him to help me and i want him to lead me and i want him to guide me anybody still here [Applause] um we're nearly done and i thought you know there's one thing that's the matter with me i i'm just not a dancer i just can't get up there with people watching me i just can't do it unless i feel it church ain't for that this is not this is not the place for that kind of moving around and dancing and carrying on and brother branham recognized his problem you won't like it you won't like it that he said it preachers won't quote it but here's what he said you know there's one thing that matter of me i haven't got enough victory maybe and i got sitting there and i got my methodist foot padding what his method is now that was i tell you that was a step in the right direction he left the starch of the baptist and he got the pet in his foot like a methodist come on now there's a way being made there's a way being made there's a way being made and the first thing you know god might judge listen this is not a man being silly this is a man being very serious he now says god by judge for i knowed what i was doing he went all the way baptist methodist one of them old pentecostals from louisville across the river next thing you know he said hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god for i note for i knowed for i knowed before i knew what i was doing because there are times that god says i've just got to take you a little bit out of your head got to bring you just a little bit further than your head and let you get caught up before you know you're caught up that's what happened he got caught up before he realized he was caught up he said before i know what i was doing i was out on the floor here dancing around i don't think he meant like this with her do you but on the floor with that girl at the same time he was dancing and praising god god brought him out all the way out of the seat of the scornful and gave him liberty to worship god hallelujah you can't even say according to the dictates of his heart because it wasn't originally in his heart to worship god that way but he said there could be only be one thing wrong with me i don't have enough victory so there could only be one thing wrong with the church that has put all that out and decided we don't need liberty anymore you don't have enough victory but i tell you in the name of the lord there's victory to be had because jesus is the victor jesus is the victor jesus is the victor two more paragraphs same quote he said then i said go god he's already out on the floor or down the floor let's stand you need to stretch you've been sitting so long you need to stand i need to sit you need a stretch i need to draw up he said then i said god take me out of the seat of the scornful let me look at anything sensibly [Music] before i ever pass a judgment anymore amen i'm not going to read the next sentence it might be a bit self-serving i'll let you read it one more time god does things and we better be glad because some of us are peculiar he said i don't believe in a lot here's the balance i could cut that off but i'm not he said i don't believe in a lot of nonsense i don't believe in a lot of tommy rot but i believe in the real genuine spirit-filled holy ghost word of god being preached in power and demonstration amen he said for that's the thing that saved me that's the thing that brought me thus far that's the thing that helped me when the doctor said i was dying that's the thing that saved me in the hour of my death that's the thing that'll resurrect me we're reading on and that's the thing i'll go to heaven with if i ever get there i'll have to go buy it because i don't know nothing else but that and don't want to know nothing else but that that's right so there's no disclaimer there brother branham didn't understand it either until god taught him showed him right there where is it found right there in the word we're going to stop here but i will bring i'll come back because i'm not nearly done with the subject i never thought there be a day that you'd just take a whole text on on uh dancing but the day's here the day's here now two years ago or last year sometime i preached on dance or die and there is a time where you feel like if i don't get out of my rut if i don't get out of my rut brother branham said it runs a grave with the ends kicked out of it if i don't get out of my rut i'm going to lay here and die there there comes a time where you've got to be like those four little lepers men and say i cannot sit here and die without trying to save myself [Music] i can't i've got to break forward send judah first praise has to go before us now what do you want to do do you want to say i think we've probably sung enough of uh uh of speak the name of jesus so you've got something else isn't this a nifty stand i've found in vault benjamin to hold his ipad for those times that he has to lead from the drums they are just somebody out there smarter than i am i wished i'd have thought of that [Music] father i see that you are drawing a line in the sand and i want to be standing on your side [Music] come on worship [Music] standing on your side [Music] holding your hand so let your kingdom come and let it live in me this is my prayer this is my plea if the worshipers arrive let's tell him how good he's been let's tell him he's given us freedom and liberty i'm serious let's worship the
