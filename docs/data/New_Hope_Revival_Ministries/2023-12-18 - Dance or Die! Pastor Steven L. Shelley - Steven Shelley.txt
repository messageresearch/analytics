Praise yes you want to lift up a Shout to the Lord with me right now hallelujah hallelujah oh you're wonderful and worthy woo you may be seated for a moment or two this morning we're blessed to be in the house of the Lord we've had a couple of cloudy days now but it doesn't have to be cloudy in here it can the sun is shining the s o n has risen in my heart and I've got so much to thank God for so much to praise him for if you can draw a good breath and and you have somehow so far navigated all the sickness around you and you're still doing well you've got something to be thankful for amen we didn't mention sister gird and sister Terry being out this morning I did forgot to write it down but sister gerd was not doing well earlier in the week and uh she had a positive test and has had a lot of congestion and so forth and so we want to believe God I mean I just believe I just believe it's done but we need it to manifest so that she can be free uh of course at her age it gives us more reason to pray and and uh to to be concerned only to the point of praying more right and also I heard uh through Joshua I think it was or Benjamin somebody mentioned that there was sickness at RJ and Emily's house so let's hold them up to the Lord in prayer and believe that they will quickly shake that off uh I I brother gy I get confused every time is Sister Louis's birthday before your just the day before yours or or is it not it was wrong on Facebook and I I just can't be sure Sister Louise uh I don't have any idea when your birthday is Sister it might possibly be this week but uh there were a couple different things on Facebook and I have I've meant to find out and I and I haven't done it when I'm when I mention it when I see it then I think of it and other times it leaves my mind if by chance your birthday sister we is on Tuesday of this week happy birthday if it's not you get extra love and prayers anyway and then on Wednesday of this week is brother Grey's birthday and uh so let's remember to wish him a happy [Applause] birthday I I think he'll be 44 I mean 54 is that right and uh so may God bless him and strengthen him and he shares a birthday with a friend of mine Caleb Deron and so I always pray for brother gy and Caleb on the day of their birthday and then Saturday of this coming week RJ has a birthday and we always like to pray for sister Rebecca's son Matthew his birthday is also on that day so let's lift him up to the Lord did I miss any birthdays or anniversaries this week all right so I know some people don't don't even want theirs called out but too bad if we remember we're going to sometimes we get carried away and we don't get a chance to do that we're glad that brother Josiah and sister Katie are still with us and uh we're looking forward to it we have some more visitors coming in in over the course of the next couple of weekends so let's let's uh protect ourselves from sickness and try to be here amen we believe that God has something for us uh I guess you know that this has been a really sad week in Israel an unspeakable tragedy has taken place and that three hostages were uh you know it's hard to say it it's hard to speak it out but they were accidentally killed and uh you know I can't call it Friendly Fire because there wasn't anything friendly about it it was just a terrible mistake and the Rules of Engagement were broken and it's easy to criticize when you're sitting in your uh easy chair at home but these young men have been drafted off the street with uh two years of training and and it takes a whole lot longer than that to make a skilled Soldier and uh so uh they they just really believed and and what makes it so complicated is when you're dealing with an enemy that has no morality at all uh hardly any any human instinct and they like to fool they dress up and in many of the bus bombings in Jerusalem the Palestinians have dressed up like religious Jews so they could get on the bus and blow it up and so uh they felt like that they were that they were trying to lure them in I think you heard the report last week that a four-year-old child was sent out into a field in the wee hours of the morning to lure the soldiers in and uh miraculously they were able to go and save save the little child without being killed but the purpose of sending the child out was to draw them in so that they could kill them all and uh something happened and they weren't able to make the attack and so you can't trust and so when these men came out without their shirts on uh it it appeared that that there was more to it than what was being said and of course according to the Rules of Engagement they should have not fired a shot but you're dealing again with all the nerves and with all of the stress and with all of the tension that's going around you and mistakes are made and uh it's an awful thing and of course the world is upside down about it um but that's just the way it works and uh I heard a commentator and this may sound like cursing and if it does you forgive me it's a famous quote but he's telling the truth he said war is hell and and if it sounds like I'm cursing well I I didn't mean to but I I whole heart edly agree that it's not good in any circumstances do we want war but we do believe that Israel like all other nations has a right to protect themselves and their children need to be protected and we are afraid that before o it's over that many more of the hostages will uh uh either lose their lives or we will come to know that they have lost their lives but we are still believing and praying for them every day and checking our list and believing that this thing will eventually be over and when it's over praying that there will be no more Hamas and the the situation in the north is getting worse and uh you know when when when Hezbollah if you think Hamas is well equipped uh Hamas as far as we know they have no cited missiles and what that means is they usually fire cam rockets and these Kasam Rockets are are uh are are not uh sight guided and so they just put them in the loader maybe you've seen the footage they put them in the loader the loader shoots them and wherever they land is where they it's where they land but we know for sure that Hezbollah in the north is much better equipped and we know that they have laser guided missiles with nuclear uh some warheads and uh this becomes a very serious situation in the north when when h can send a uh drone over yesterday into Northern Israel and kill a man with a drone uh a soldier then you realize that you're fighting a different kind of War than Israel has ever fought before and I maybe I am taking too much of your time but but this is this is something that we have a responsibility of course to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and uh so that that's why we have no apology for saying let let it be accomplished all that needs to be accomplished for her to have peace one of these days there's going to be peace in the whole earth SAR Shalom is coming the Prince of Peace is coming until then it will be hit and miss but when he gets here oh Hallelujah I blocked a message preacher this week on on Facebook from Africa who was berating and uh belittling and uh and and acting like a wild man himself and I just thought you know what I don't have to argue with you uh if if this was happening in your nation it would be a different story all of us would certainly change our minds but God is a good God and he knows how to bring peace to this madness uh would you thank God for these musicians and we're so [Applause] blessed I hope you all will gather back with us as soon as you can seems like sometimes they they get a little carried away with their with with their break I'd like to see them in here because there's you can say Amen because there's nothing like sitting under the atmosphere of the word maybe I'm just jealous that I don't get a break halfway through the service but whatever let's stand let's see what God has I don't want to preach this morning but it's my responsibility to and any preacher will tell you that there are times when we want to and time s when we don't want to but when we don't want to we have to anyway and it's not uh not that it's a hard message it's an easy message but it just seems like we've covered it from every angle and I am so anxious to to move on to some other subjects but I really know I know that the Lord is is sort of making me do this again so I'm I'm I'm o I'm being obedient but I'm reluctantly obedient I know you don't have that problem I know that when God tells you to jump you ask how high on the way up but I don't always ask how high on the way up sometimes I have to ask how high and then jump but here we are second Samuel chapter 6 beginning in verse 13 and you know I'll just say this uh the worship this morning was good it could have been much more and and it it can be uh I I knew the problem I could sense the problem and feel the problem some of you you didn't mean to I know you didn't mean to bring your chaos with you this morning but you know we do and I could just sense that there had been some harsh words spoken to for you to get over here and uh you know that it's hard to recover and but you should because the Bible says enter into his gates with Thanksgiving in your heart into your courts with praise I'm not going to tell you it's been a long time it's been a long time but I'm not going to tell you that there hasn't been a time that I was mad at my wife or she was mad at me on a Sunday morning but I want you to know that I would just often say honey forgive me we will settle this but right now I've got to go to church and do what I'm called to do and we'll get it straightened out and don't you let it hinder you and I'm not going to let it hinder me that's the only way you can enter in everybody look this way that's the only way you can you got to settle that but now you've got to make up about it and you got to try to get it taken care of because some of you brought it with you this morning you don't want me to point I see some blushing faces don't bring it here get it straightened out and look it ain't worth it I don't care what it is it's not even worth worth it somebody said well we got to talk it out you know what I believe in that I believe in that but sometimes I don't even think that's really necessary I know women are going to have a hard time with me saying that but sometimes you just get over it for love amen and you just press on and of course you're rushing around I could really tell you a lot of things if you'd listen you go to bed too late on Saturday night your children are up way later than they need to be up and you won't listen you won't listen to me you say I think maybe in your mind you think that's none of my business well I'm only trying to help you you get up late you don't have an alarm if you do you live by a snooze you're just habitual snoozers come on now I didn't say losers I said snoozers and you get on up and you get out of bed and you provide a something for your family to eat so they're not starving to death at 2:00 when the preacher gets through maybe three today and and you have things L would you believe that you can even pick your outfit would this just blow your mind if I told you that it's possible to pick what you're going to wear the next day and lay it out lay it out so that you don't have to go around the house know where your keys are get you a basket W I'm on a roll get you a basket and put it by the front door or a nail when you come in the house when I come in the house my keys go right there then I don't have to look for them on Sunday morning nobody has to run through the house where are the keys all of that makes a difference when you get to God's house some of you have been here over 20 years and haven't learned a thing from [Music] me it's obvious but we went as high as we could with all that hanging on us and next time we'll go higher that's exactly right I I can't take it personal Benjamin can't take it personal musicians can't take it personal it is what it is but next time we vow we're going higher you if you have to reach over and give her a peck on the cheek or whatever you have to do to make it up so that you don't get intimidated to come and stand in your position 2 Samuel amen Pastor 2 Samuel chapter 6 beginning in verse 13 and it was so that when they that bear the Ark of the Lord these are the carriers of the glory god spoke to us here in this Church many years ago and said I've called you to be bearers carriers of my glory that means wherever we go we're to take the glory of his goodness with us as we were singing about this morning and when they that bear the Ark of the Lord had gone six Paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings I don't know if you know this or not but that means every six paces then he offered to the Lord oxid and fatlings six paces oxid and fatlings so this was a ceremony yes sir sometimes people say you know you all get too it's too much of a thing turns out to be like a production well I want you to know this day was a day of of something that kind of looked like a production but it was all for the right reason and David danced didn't I just finish this nine Hebrew words of Praise yes sir didn't I just follow up on December 5th a Tuesday night uh follow up on Dancing yes sir well here I am again I can't help myself I have to obey him sir and David dance before the Lord with all his might everything he had in him he spent it with his praise and David was girded with a lenen EOD now that's not a whole lot of clothes so David and all the house of Israel brought up for the Ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet help me out and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David Mel Saul's daughter looked through a window David's wife King Saul's daughter was looking through the casement and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord like sister Katie saw here she was just looking through the casement and oh she's over here wasn't she playing the piano she's just looking through the casement and all of a sudden it's like a spring boing boing it's right it's never hurt anybody unless you land on them leaping and dancing before the Lord and she not Katie Mel right despised him in her heart what a woman there's a reason for that father we have come today to worship your name to hallow your name in a wicked World our hearts grow heavy with the news we are caught up in the emotion of the struggles of our families and our neighbors around us we wear the tragedies and traumas of other people's lives and we must remember that when we come into your presence we have to it it it's a requirement that we lay all of that at the feet of King Jesus and we say Lord I can't sort all the details out right now I've got to praise I've got to worship I've got to come under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and while I'm under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit perhaps Lord you'll help me so that when I come out from under that inspiration I have wisdom and strategy and I have peace about how to make a decision for what's going on in our life lives father I don't believe that anybody suffers when they lay these things at your feet and come for a few hours and forget about it all I believe that instead of suffering I believe they gain I believe it's a great Victory when we're able to do that so if we failed this morning if some of us didn't quite pass that test I pray that you will strengthen each one in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't let anybody leave here with the attitude well I guess I could have just stayed at home for doing such a thing as that is breaking the word of God we don't want to do that either we want to press through all of the doubt and all of the struggle and we want to come and praise you with all of our might with all of our strength because you are more than wonderful you are more than worthy help us now in our time in the word and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said you may be seated isn't he good he's good I don't know charity if you if you did all those separate or if they're all together those Hebrew words are they all together they're separate all right so we're going to go over four Hebrew words that have just appeared in these three verses the Bible said first in verse 14 and David danced before the Lord with all his might and the word for might there is O and it's spelled in English transliteration it's spelled o but it's pronounced oo and it means strength and might it can even mean power and stamina with everything that was within him I want you to know that if you're going to do something for God you ought to do your very best if you're going to vacuum the floor for God you ought to vacuum it with perfection anything we do as unto the Lord we do it with everything that we have there's no ha halfway praise there there's no you know I'll just give it my best shot no no no your best you know th this whole concept they used to sing a song in Pentecostal churches that oh just praise the Lord anyhow Just Praise the Lord anyhow you know I don't even like that I've told you before I understand the concept in everything give thanks but it's not an old anyhow praise or I'll just you know praise him anyhow praise him anyway no no no praise is a serious serious exchange it's a serious occupation I am a professional praiser I want you to know I'm called to be a praiser I'm called to be a worshipper I was created for such a purpose as that and so you may have as part of your destiny success in business and you may have as part of your destiny to be a teacher to impart knowledge know and wisdom and you may have as part of your destiny the calling to be a parent but there is no calling that's any higher on your life or any destiny that is any higher on your life than that that you were created to worship and to praise the Lord and maybe we get weary with hearing it but I find that it's something that we have to be prompted on and reminded of because sometimes we think that it's better on our emotions or how we're handling a present situation but I want you to know that's not the way we do it at all when we lose we praise when we win we praise when we're on top of it all we praise when we feel like it's all on top of us we praise because it's who we were created to be you may not realize it but that kind of Praise brings you into a flow of obedience a praiser a worshiper is more likely to obey when God speaks to them because praise keeps the channels open and it keeps the communication between you and your creator flowing and it gives you Grace to speak to him and it also releases Grace for you to be able to hear him because he's always talking that's right can I say that again he's always talking you know sometimes we think about when God is silent we get this idea from Jon ofar God is silent these voices that once guided me that once spoke to me I can't hear them and when I needed God he was silent I don't really believe that that is the case what I believe is that God doesn't always speak to us the same way but he's is always talking it's one of the reasons why we need to hear the messages that make up the message of the hour the sermons that have been recorded and preserved for us and reserved on our behalf as spiritual food in due season I don't understand how anybody could feel a part of the bride of Christ that doesn't hear that voice that doesn't hear those sermons through through the week because it's what strengthens us and it it enhances us and it supplements us your pastor can't give you everything you need the fivefold ministry can't always provide for all of your needs and so we have the messages that God gave brother brandham and we say that without apology to sustain us to feed us to guide us to to direct us if you can listen to brother brandom preaching and not hunger for the word if you can listen to him and think that he is the one deserving the preeminence you haven't really listened to him because on every tape he's lifting up one and telling us that the word is our life the word is our foundation amen we can't live on our worship we not changed by our worship but our worship helps position us to receive the word that will then change our lives I've Been Changed by the word of God I want to testify to you the word of God has changed my life not once but again and again and again and again so whatever you do for God do it with all your sweat put all the Sweat Equity you in and listen I want you to know that there is an expectation in the world to respond a certain way to everything that happens when your loved ones die you're supposed to to uh to look sick and walk funny I don't know what that has to do with death and uh not smile not look anyone in the eye I'm not making light of grief what I'm telling you is we should not be living by the expectations of those who don't have the faith that we have don't you let them tell you how to grieve don't you let the world's expectations tell you how to respond am let the word of God tell you how to respond we respond in Praise the Lord is given the Lord is taken away does it mean it doesn't hurt no it hurts it's like a rip it's like a rip in our heart it's more than we can stand in the natural and that's why we've got to get in the spirit let me have a little water while you see law if we get in the spirit we can be lifted above our human real action and we can respond Spirit to Spirit and we need to we must this little brother who lost his wife to breast cancer after a couple year battle when he was here just a few weeks ago and when I greeted him for the first time in the line on Saturday for lunch he said I feel like I ought to know you brother because of all the services we've streamed I feel like I ought to know you but now it's my first time uh meeting you and I and I said to him what we englishes would say to one another I said I'm very sorry for your loss and he looked at me like I I don't know if you're going to be able to take what I'm about to say or not and so I just looked deep in his eye and he said don't don't be sorry he said you brother you don't have to say that to me don't be sorry he said I don't know if you can understand this or not but he said I what I mean and really because you don't know me but he said I I I I have peace I grieved while she was suffering but when she was released he said I decided to Rejoice to give God praise and to raise my family what more could he do what more should a Believer do it doesn't mean that we don't go losing jobs you know I've known of people losing a job and and uh going into the throws of depression and needing medication and and constant counseling and and I'm I'm not surprised when people respond that way out there but a Believer a believer I'm preaching to Believers today we don't grieve like those who have no hope we know that if God takes this job he's got another one waiting on us somewhere and in the interim we know we won't hunger he'll Feed Us it might not be our favorites but it will be enough to sustain us until God makes another Grace deposit in our account if you know what I'm saying this morning say amen amen am I real crooked sir good cuz it's really getting on my nerves no I'm trying to leave it [Music] on David he danced before the Lord with all of his strength with all of his might it goes on to say uh David and all the house of Israel verse 15 brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting so that word shouting there is tra and and and it's spelled uh t e r u a h tra and it is a word that describes the sounding the the uh the Cadence the Cadence of the trumpet there are several three different words I think in Hebrew that describe the sounds that are made on the chaar and one of them is and one of them is two amazing you didn't know I made such a good Rams Horn do you and the other one and all of them needed a word because Hebrew is one of the most poetic and picturesque uh languages in the history of the world so this this tra is is a word that that sort of gives the impression of oh oh oh oh oh oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know the kind of Praise that gets on your nerves did you know that that it's easy to miss if you never look at what what word is used which word is being used for shouting then then you might not know that there was a specific word chosen based on the kind of shouting that was going on so hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah like I said the kind that'll get on your nerves but God must like it right because he he gave us a word to describe that kind of of shouting a shout or a blast of War an alarm or Joy it can be celebratory or it can be an alarm to call to action and its last definition there is a battlecry one that says God is giving us the victory he has he is and he always will that's right are you with me and then it says and with the sound of a trumpet the reason why it mentioned that two different words here expressed in two different ways is because the sound of the shouting was so similar to the sound of the trumpet or the chofar that the riter wanted to make sure we understood there was a voice that was doing it and there was an instrument that was doing it do you follow that and and then it goes on to say King David was leaping and dancing before the Lord that word leaping is Paz Paz and it means to bound are you with me still hello don't you say you are get there when it says to bound it does doesn't mean to be bound it doesn't mean to be binding it means to bound wow some of you who have a lot less to lift than I can really get up there but it means like a spring to bound and to rebound it means to be Supple or agile or nimble oh David was he was giving it everything he had he was shouting while the trumpets were being blown and he was leaping around as agile as a deer right and then it says dancing and the word dancing there is corer ker and it mean it's only used two times and it means to whirl about did you notice as we taught a few weeks ago that almost every word that dancing is or every word that is translated in English is dancing almost every one of them speaks of a circular type whirl to whirr about to dance to move around to then surround to enclose see again you've got the circular to recur like turning a mill or this kind of meal that's turning this is what David was doing you can call it not sacred you can call it disrespectful you can call it not according to church order somebody said wait a minute brother they weren't in church oh yes they were they weren't in a building but remember every six Paces come on every six paces they they worship by giving a slain offering now anywhere you're giving offerings to God if you know anything about the order of the Old Testament it's called a tabernacle or a temple or a place that God dwells you can't just do this in your own home they were not allowed to give sacrificial offerings like that slaying animals shedding blood in their own homes it always took place in the Tabernacle or in the temple yes sir so this was not the Tabernacle the mishon in the wilderness this was not the Temple of Solomon but what it was is it it was a temporary place of worship as David was bringing the ark yes back to where it belonged to be it was a move hear me now I don't want to bore you on he hear me they were moving in restoration am amen I'm telling you God's moving today yes he is and he's doing it in restoration because so much has been lost now just just for the record here I am studying this week since Friday I am studying the things that brother brandham said about the shook because I I I appreciate that I appreciate what he said you can find the the um majority of that in the sermon the seed shall not be air with the Shu but he mentions that Shu or shock several times many times actually and it's so funny to me because when I hear people referring to the Shu it's always with a little twist of the lip and a little disdain come on but I wonder if they remember that that's what he said about Mary now let me tell you what the I I can't preach this this morning but my mind is on it blessed art thou among women blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus you're a pretty special gal highly favored and chosen of the Lord and so I don't believe that brother brandham would have referred to her as the carrier or the shook of the seed if it was always to be taken in such a Negative form remember he said the shook didn't have the life but the shook carried the life all right so when we hear brother Brandon referring to to Pentecostal as a shook every time so far that I have found he's speaking and even clarifies either three or four paragraphs before or three or four paragraphs after he he clarifies that he's talking about denominational Pentecostals right I can't find anywhere where he's calling the sh Pentecostal shook as the experience because if I remember correctly brother brandom is talking about the birth and he said every birth is a mess and every birth comes with three issues yes sir water blood and life and I believe he typed the Holy Ghost to the life so when I hear him talking about the Shu and Pentecostal I understand he he's saying things like they went to shook or or to to what was the other word seed which is not a proper word for for the explanation that he was giving on tongues now if you take that out of context you can preach as I've heard people recently preach that tongues is just Pentecostal shook but that's very much out of context so you know it's not always so good I remember the Brethren telling me 30 years ago we're not sure if this computer business is going to be good for the bride or not can you imagine being so old that I remember the first computer that the message was on and nobody really realized you could buy a computer and have it on there because uh you know brother Neil wasn't really selling them that way back then he was selling them with the message loaded on them already so he and he deserved it if you think I'm uh saying anything negative I am not he deserved it for all the work that he had put in to creating folio views that's what it was that was the software that was being used in that day but and I bought one in fact I had several and I went through all the stages I had the Sony ebook anybody have a Sony ebook when that came out and I even had a thermal printer so I had traveled all my years of ministry I had traveled Chad I'll tell you he toted it enough with a fulls size not fulls size like like ours up there but but a but a full-size paper printer so I had a laptop and a printer that was like that that I took everywhere I went in the world well when that ebook came out we didn't always have to have the laptop anymore and we didn't have to have a full-size printer because they made a little printer about that big and we could print the quotations out on thermal paper like a adding machine so imagine us oh I wish I had a picture standing somewhere in the third world remember just be on a roll can you imagine doing like that to try to find the quote you were looking for because you printed out more than you needed and you're trying to find it the Brethren back then said I don't know if this is going to be our our Glory or if it's going to be our death and I didn't understand what they meant I was so thrilled to have it as a resource to be able to search everything he said about a particular subject and to do it in a very relatively quick manner stay with me how many times will I need to say that today before we're done I hope not too many more and so uh I didn't understand what they meant I was so thankful for technology and so forth and uh and they said you see if if you are doing doing queries that's what they called them on folio views if you're doing a query it will only pull up the paragraph with that word in it and so if preachers start basing their supplemental quotes on one paragraph we see the potential you know I thought they were being legal I honestly thought they were being kind of brandom itish but they had a lot of wisdom that I didn't have they said I'm afraid that they will just read the paragraph where the word showed up and not the paragraphs before and the paragraphs after and if you're not careful you will present something as whole truth when it's only part truth can you follow me and so that's what's happening about those those shook quote tongues just Pentecostal Shook and when he when and I show you it I I'm working on it and I'll show it to you when when he when he says that he's talking in context if you go a few paragraphs before or after he's talking about when the doctrine became that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost he said then it went to shook but here's what are you listening I'll call I know your names on brother there's nothing more important in your papers there than what I'm saying right now very important because where Pentecost made their mistake is when they took tongues and they made it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost so the doctrine of tongues being the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost that was just shook the seed went on brother BR said you get a magnifi find glass and go down you'll find a little you'll find a little blade of Life coming coming out of there down there Bottom by by the bottom where the Shu comes into the to the ear you'll find a little Life coming up through there he said that's the seed that represents the germ life this other has been to protect and to keep so for preachers to stand up today and tell us that Pentecost is just a shook as though it's easy to snatch off the corn and throw away you forget what he said he said though the Shu had no life the life life came through the Shu now why is that an important uh uh observation because the Holy Ghost is life everything the Holy Ghost does is life producing there's no death in the Holy Ghost there's no death in a Pentecostal experience there may be death in taking a Doctrine to a Shu there may be death been making some little part of the picture the least of the gifts he said there may be some problem if we if we take that as though we have reached the Pinnacle this is why brother Brandon was so against the Pentecostal movement in those latter days is because they said this is this is it we talk in tongues we have reached the highest point and brother brandom said oh no woo there's so much more out there for us are you me there's so much more out there for us so let me get off of the sermon I'm not preaching and get on the one I am preaching and let's move on David was not going to get it wrong again he'd already been through some things he'd already changed the way the glory was carried it was to be carried on the on the shoulders near the heart of the levitical priesthood David said I I see it being such a hard task and so he wanted to design a new cart that he could put the Ark on that would make it a little easier to be stabilized and if you remember it it worked but not entirely because the heart would shake and the Ark would shake and the Commandment to the Levites was don't touch the ark you can move it by the Rings you can move it by the staves but don't put your hand on the ark I'm telling you amen I'm telling you brother sister be careful how you put your hand on the glory be careful how you put your hand on the Pentecostal experience be careful how you put your hand on somebody else's spiritual worship be careful because usza reached his hand to balance the ark and God smote him dead and David carried the guilt David was under the conviction and condemnation of the death of usza the priest because God said I'm showing you that my way is the best way my way is the right way my way is the only way does anybody hear God say that today I do my way is the right way so David was going to he wasn't going to get it wrong again he wanted to do everything according to God's order and protocol would you give me verses 9 and 10 of 2 Samuel I've got to hurry and David was afraid of the Lord that day and said how shall the Ark of the Lord come to me so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David but David carried it aside into the house of Obed Edom the GTE now I mention to you that I have stood on the ruins of the House of OED Edom why because how do you know how could you possibly know that because it has been preserved from generation to generation to generation there have been several Church is built including one Byzantine massive church was built on the site now now in Ruins but another church sits there and it's such a popular place the Acoustics are so beautiful in the church over the H ruins of the House of OED Edom that Jewish people come from everywhere to a church which is not something that Jews generally do to hear the music concerts because the concerts that that are given there in in a church that's quite old it's not the first not the original but it's a church that's quite old the concerts are so amazing and I mentioned to you that the area the city the town is called kirat yarim and it's an Israeli Arab town and you can stand on top of kirat yarim of course you can go right down into the little village of abago and you can have the most wonderful food you've ever tasted in your life let's not forget the food in abago amazing Chad do you remember it is amazing the most wonderful upside down dumped right out on your table the most wonderful meal and you can look right down over the restaurant but but we're being spiritual now food is very spiritual but not in the moment and you're looking over to the city of Jerusalem and you're thinking about the the the the conflict that's in David's mind I want to take it all the way but I didn't have so so good a success so I'm going to put it over here into the house of OED Edom and I'm going to let him watch over the ark but there came a time that David was stirred Again by the spirit of the Lord to get the ark where it really belonged back to the city of Jerusalem what stirred him he began to hear that wherever that Ark was the blessings of God were where the freedom of the holy spirit is the blessings of God are poured out where God is free to move to talk and to have his way that's where I want to be I want to be right there in the middle of that I don't want want to spend my life sitting somewhere where Jesus has been banished to the corner with dirty feet I'm not going to live my life in a lifeless church I'm not going to live my life in a place where the Holy Ghost is not free to move too late too late he filled me with the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old I am too spoiled by the Holy Ghost to be able to live my life in a place where there is more structure than anointing I'm not opposed to God's order it's man's order that troubles my spirit anybody with me cuz if man is not working in tandem with God right he may find himself touching what does not belong to him to touch and he may find himself on the ground or pushing up lies in the in the cemetery you just don't ever know I don't want to touch that all this was a strong indication to David that God's anger had begin to subside and quiet down and he said you know it might be about time for me to move that Ark a little closer because the Bible tells us that David pitched a tent for the ark to sit in it was called The Tabernacle of David it's referenced several times in the Bible in fact the Bible prophesies that in those last days I will rebuild the Tabernacle of David and the main difference there were several differences but the main difference hear this between the Tabernacle of Moses and the Tabernacle of David is the Tabernacle of David had no Veil so the worshipper was not banished to the outer Court the worshipper could come right up if he had Clean Hands in a pure heart he could come right up into the presence of God and worship before the Ark of the Covenant come on no Veil to keep him out that was a that was a pre- shadow of what would happen with Christ when when he died on the cross and the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom what David had what David was operating in what David was administering on the on the uh on Mount Zion was a was a pre-type of what you and I can experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this was really in the heart of David to get that to get that Ark back to to the city of Jerusalem specifically to the city of David which is the same as Mount Zion and he thought you know if God is really blessing Obed Edom and there seems to be you know maybe the temperature maybe you know he's checking the temperature spiritually and he said I think God is is no longer angry with me for what I've done he said I may just I may just get see if I can get that Arc put back to where it belongs and David wanted to do it with such protocol he wanted to do it with such order he'd already messed up really really really really bad and so David wanted it to be sacred and he wanted wanted it to be holy and he wanted to be stiff cuz he didn't want to end up like usza but something happened to David he didn't set out to turn this into a holy ghost meeting oh he lined up those that would help do the sacrifices he lined up those that would chant the Psalms he lined up those that would help move things along every six Paces he had it all figured out and was going to make the most beautiful parade that Jerusalem had ever seen but he wasn't counting on that joy that was about to fill him from the top of his head to the souls of his feet and what ended up happening is David became overwhelmed with the joy of seeing the ark lifted up and returning to Jerusalem after all of these years back to where it belonged to be and so he forgot about protocol he forgot about s cimity he forgot about sacredness and he was overwhelmed with his joy and he began to LEAP right and dance with all his might I didn't hear David say this but I've got a feeling the joy was so powerful on him that day that he kind of had this attitude though he slay me that's what job said on maybe David had a little of that on him that day though he slay me I'm going to praise him anyway I cannot miss this opportunity to let this Joy bubble up within my spirit come on now the scripture then immediately calls our attention to how David danced and how he dressed to dance an ephod was a Priestly upper garment worn over a simple robe more like a loose tunic or vest the Bible said in 2 Samuel 6:14 in the complete Jewish Bible then David danced and spun around with abandon that's without restraint before adoni wearing a linen ritual vest I don't want you to see something as short as mine I want you to know that it was a longer vest that would have gone down just below his knees the problem with this is the Bible doesn't specifically say that he had the undergarment with it it says only that he danced with the ephod in 2 Samuel 6:14 in the NLT it says and David danced before the Lord with all his might wearing a Priestly tunic so I want you to understand that what he was wearing that day is something that he would not have normally wore alone it was a layer of of several garments that he would have worn when he appeared in public and the Bible is is clear to mention this to us it wasn't exactly his underwear as I've heard some describe but it was not a garment that went all the way to his ankles either this was the most humble of the garments that all common priest would wear before the Lord such a garment was a symbol that everyone recognized as being the Garment of a servant unto the Lord are you with me don't let him sleep next to you wake him up amen this was the king he would have been all right to wear the Royal garments that he was used to wearing every day nobody would have thought a thing if he would have even had a big fancy crown on his head and I don't know what all he could have had it all on but he chose that day hear me he chose that day to only dance in the servant's tunic the one that identified him as first and foremost not the king of Israel but a servant unto the Lord does anybody get anything in that in 1 Chronicles chapter 15 it tells it like this verse 27 and 28 and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the Levites that bear the ark and the singers in Shanah the master of the song with the singers David also had upon him an ephod of linen so normally there would have been more thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the cornet and with trumpets and symbols making a noise with Sultry and harps this would have been the normal protocol but Samuel tells us that David was humbling himself before the Lord and the returning Ark of his glory David was identifying himself in the eyes of the people as a simple servant of Jehovah there were no other kings to be adored that day David said I don't want the attention to be on me I want everybody to see the king of glory are you here David was making sure that on this day God received all the glory and all the honor David was far from naked and he was as he was accused but it is true that only on this day he laid aside his Imperial and Regal robes and that day David had no Pride I'm waiting on you no Pride everybody's got a little pride that day David had no Pride don't tell me that we don't all have a little bit of Pride well most of us do anyway we glanced in the mirror at least once some us some of us did everything we did in front of the mirror some people put their shirt on and their dress on and everything in front of the mirror cuz they didn't want to miss a detail they didn't want to miss a button they didn't want to miss a zipper most everybody that did their hair it's clear to see that some of you skipped that step but most everybody that does their hair they want to make sure they do it in front of a mirror we all have a little bit of pride in in the way we look and the way we present ourselves and it's not wrong to care about that because we are ambassadors for the king but that day David just simply didn't care he didn't care if his bangs were out of place he didn't care if his if his uh epod was disheveled uh can I just tell you I don't want to be too plain here but he just didn't care that there was probably way too much you know hanging loose Etc you know he didn't care it wasn't for women he was dancing to the Lord and he did it with all of his might in the message Pride brother brandham said and that's campbellville Kentucky brother brandham said oh Pride such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride in the message the unwelcome Christ brother brandom said what a horrible curse pride is oh you're too good sure we go to church that knows better than that we don't believe in Divine Healing a we have nothing to do with that FY he said Jesus is in your town somebody got mad the other day because I used the term Pharisee when I was speaking about the ministers it shut down the moving of the spirit brother vandom used that term in the very same same line Pharisee Jesus is in your town amen Ain him love him Embrace him love him don't let pride get in your way in the message the unwelcome Christ same message paragraph 248 he said oh my pride is such an evil thing in a message called I stand at the door and knock brother B said there's another little door called Pride oh what a horrible little black Devil's all pinned up in the heart of Pride thinking you're better than somebody else don't get quiet on me now well I wouldn't send my children over there they don't dress right the people who goes there in my class if Christ is Lord in your heart we're all one class because of hello can't you squeeze an amen we're all I'm not asking you to amen me I'm asking you to amen the word yes we're all baptized into one body Pride feels just a little a little complex you have there you go oh you don't want Jesus to touch that because it would degrade your social standing in the community you know we have to watch ourselves in the community right then then to go on he said I'd rather degrade my social standing in the community than to rub my name off the Lamb's Book of Life he said but they won't let him in that little pride holds him out come on now brother Shelly can you tell me why the gifts of the Spirit don't operate in the churches today yes I can because they won't let him in that little pride holds him out do you know brother Shelly can you tell me why there's not more Worship in the churches I sure can because they won't let him in that little pride holds him out there it is in the words of the prophet in the message is the queen of the South brother Bram said the same thing was thought when Jesus was born in Bethlehem they never sang hosan is when the king was born but the Angels sung it not the Kings and potentates but the Shepherds on the hillsides he wasn't born in a fine decorated hospital room with pink dressings hanging down come on he was born in a stinking manger how could they ever go to hear a man like that no matter what he' done you see what pride and selfishness does does it shuts you out from the kingdom of God so have enough Pride to comb your hair will you have enough Pride to make yourself presentable when you go out you're representing the King of Kings but please don't have enough pride and selfishness that you allow it to shut you out of the kingdom of God because you're afraid to praise the Lord you're afraid you're going to lose control David wanted control that day David wanted order that day but the joy of the Lord overtook [Applause] him the faucet's Bible dictionary says it like this David brought it up the ark stripping off his Royal robe in the presence of the symbol of Jehovah's Throne the true king and in a Lin and ephod to mark his assuming the Priestly along with the kingly function dancing before the Lord with all his might in other words he he unidentified himself as the king that's right and he identified himself as a Priestly servant unto the Lord you and I may have to unidentify ourselves as a as an esteemed family in the message come on you know the names he's a she's a we might have to unidentify ourselves from some of that the royalty of the message it's not just the Windsor that are royalty come on we have royalty even around the message of the hour you just name a name I remember dreading for my children to get old enough to know and care because of course I would have liked for them to think they came from a from a fine uh Elite family name imagine they're surprised when they found out that that I am so low among the Brethren that they don't even use the term brother or mister or Pastor or Reverend for me I have found myself at times so low among the Brethren they don't even use my first name they just say you you you you know Shelly you go to Shelly's Church uh you're a shell to my children I'm so thankful that most of the time they've said yes I pray they haven't been too often tempted to be like Peter and say what are you talking about I don't know anything about what you're saying no did I say Shelly I meant Shell House no no no Just sh not shell you must be mistaken Mel Saul's daughter accused David of dancing like a common man and beneath his station in life no robe no Crown to set him off is more important than others she did not care that he was dancing come on she cared that he was embarrassing her right she cared that he was lowering himself and his esteem and making himself a commoner he traded everything heavy do you know how heavy come on Royal robes can be come he didn't want anything weighing him down praise God I'm going to bound I'm going to rebound I'm going to dance with all my might I'm going to spin around and whirl I'm going to shout shout shout shout shout my praise I don't want anything holding me down so he laid aside that heavy confining Royal robe that Iden ified his position for a tunic that was loose and less confining for dancing it's time to dance he said there's a time to sit on a throne with a royal robe and a crown on my head but there comes a time when all I really want to do is Just Dance for Joy now notice he didn't say dance in the spirit I'm going to wait on the spirit of the Lord to take a hold of me force me to dance next thing I knew now brother brandom says it that way he said next thing I knew I was out there dancing right ahead of her but I would have to tell you that in my understanding of this somewhere along the way he had to make a decision what I find about getting in the spirit is there's a decision to be made oh I will I will I will not be moved I will I will I will not be moved I'll sit right here and hinder those around down me I will not be moved see the Bible said there'll come a time they'll stand in the door W hear me hear me they'll stand in the door and they won't go [Music] in come on and they won't let others go in if you think you're going to get by God like that sir you don't have to go in stay out keep your religious robes and your crowns of gold but get out of the way there's a servant of Christ there's a humble bride I don't want Pentecost as a denomination I don't want just that which was the carrier or the shop but I want the life it's the life that's going to cause us to overcome in this last day it's always the life the great Prince Matthew Henry said the great Prince thought it no disparagement to him to appear in the Habit in the tunic of a minister to the ark just let me serve the glory just let me serve the god of the box he wasn't worshiping the box he was worshiping the god of the box at that moment of David's Triumph when the ark had successfully entered into Jerusalem his wife Mel took exception to all this religious excitement and display her idea seemed to have been that the king should avoid mixing with the people that's how someone can attend a church from the time they're toddlers and not shake the pastor's hand until their wedding day I think I need another s swaller there are times when we just can't I just can't there are times I just can't but I try to make times when I can the king I'm not a king by I'm not saying that I'm just saying this Elite thing kind of hangs around on the message and now it used to be that the preacher listen this is this is how I I know you this church doesn't even really want to hear this but but let me tell you how they misuse Church order they love that quote that says the minister should stay in the back until he comes out to minister so that there's no distraction but what they don't tell you is that if it's in a convention or a camp meeting or a fellowship meeting all the preachers go back and they talk the entire time and sometimes just before the preacher is called to the buit the Entourage of preachers will come out and take their little place on the platform and I'm supposed to think they've been back there hearing from the Lord the whole time you see how people pick and choose what parts of church order they like and what parts they don't like and what and and condemn me because I like to come out and worship God like a commoner when I stand here behind this pullit I'm your pastor and his servant when I'm there I'm just his servant when I'm worshiping him I'm just his servant I'm just I'm just like you as a servant of the Lord that's right so uh Mikel she took exception to all this religious excitement and display this is tindell's commentary her idea seems to have been the king should avoid mixing with the people she despised him for the very qualities that made him great namely Devotion to the Lord and spontaneity In Worship the Bible said he was also playing an instrument 2 Samuel 6 20-23 then David returned to bless his household and Mel the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said how glorious listen she's not bragging on him how glor today she's not only the queen of Israel she's the queen of sarcasm how glorious was the king of Israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncover himself and David said unto Mel you know Mikel has a lot to be thankful for she could have had her cheek smacked that's I'm not saying that would be right but remember we're not talking about 2023 culture we're talking about a culture where you you better know there was a distance between you and the man you were in insulting it was before the Lord he said which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord over Israel therefore will I play yeah therefore will I play before the Lord and I will yet be more let's see what that word means that's not a nice word is it it's kalal contemptible trifling Swift pretty serious word isn't it yes sir vow if this shook you up woman and I will yet be more vile in thus and will be base in my own sight and of the maid servants which thou has spoken of of them shall I be had in honor therefore Mikel the daughter of Saul had no child don't ever forget there was a penalty for judging David's worship she was struck Barren now never able to Bear a child specifically because she mocked she judged she evaluated the worship of King davidow don't wor don't evaluate or judge or play around with your words when you're talking about somebody else's worship if you don't understand it turn the other way if it distracts you close your eyes you're not supposed to Gaze on somebody else's worship is anybody with me you're not supposed to be looking closely at somebody else David led the choir uncovered Easton's Bible dictionary wearing only the ephod or linen tunic he thought only of the honor of God and ple being pleasing to God and forgot about himself can you imagine being so lost in your desire to please God that you forget about who you are just because a jealous individual says that someone is doing wrong doesn't make it so brother brandham said the curse was put on her that day that she could not bear children from the punishment Mel received it is obvious that she was the one in the wrong be careful what you're ashamed of if there's a husband here that her his his wife would maybe really Break Forth into freedom and that would embarrass you to the point of saying something to her you better be careful because her only relationship with God is not through you I know that's what they teach brother I know that's what they teach you can access God through your husband well I want you to know the Bible doesn't teach it that way you better have your own relationship with God you better understand the order of the home you better remain submissive to your husband but you don't have to wait on him to get on fire for God you may be waiting for eternity huh praise is the highest occupation of any being and here's a simple key don't ever miss this simple key in questions and answers number two paragraph 104 brother brandom said you go to the church you read it for me you got that's right you're still upset with one another coming over here on now then you're not really going to find your freedom in worship because you're in the spirit of Confrontation sir you're you got your feelings hurt you want him to know it you want her to know it you want them to you want him to look over there at you and see you all downtrodden and getting nothing out of the service so he'll know how deep the wound is is you know I'm telling the truth when you come in here you better forget who you are you better forget who who what man you belong to what woman you belong to you better remember that when you come in here you're a servant of the most high God and you better if you want to worship you better get in the spirit of worship that's hard to do when you stand around in the vestibule and talk until church time I got a camera on you I know who's in here and I don't know how many times we've said to one another well my we're not going to have very many today and then I come out here and it's full where was you where were you did you only get here at 5 till or were you standing around somewhere I don't know I'm I'm not out there I don't have a camera in the vestibule that's the next step I don't want to run this like some kind of military school but I want to tell you something you don't you don't you may not make it here 30 minutes before a service that's Church order too you may not make it here that early but when you get here you ought to spend a little time in anyway in your seat or around the altar decluttering your brain defragmenting your computer asking the Lord to forgive you for how you talk to your wife on the way to church whatever it is that you need to do come on because if you're going to come into worship you've got to get in the spirit of worship what wise words from the prophet now I want want you to want to move on with this to understand the situation one needs to go back and learn about Mikel this woman was Saul's youngest daughter you read that in 1st Samuel 14:49 and was given to David by Saul for David's defeat of the Philistines when David was in Exile I want you to hear this when David was in Exile she was given away again to Fel in 1st Samuel 25:44 and then bargain back to David from Abner as a part of a political move to strengthen his claim to the throne now how would that make you feel while you're gone in Exile your wife has taken from you given to somebody else's and the only reason why she's given back to you is because a man it's an election year and Abner wanted to be in position for the king so this woman Mel was a part of a political establishment and then all always lived in a politically correct environment when she sees her husband take off his kingly garments and Crown and become like everyone else and especially when she sees David participate in an undignified celebration she is incensed David's lack of political correctness is so bad that the Bible says she hated him she despised him in her heart which means to disdain with contempt in verse 22 of the the same chapter David responds to Mel by saying to her that the servants would hold him in special honor because of this conduct basically what you hate me for they honor me for today some of the greatest heroes in America are people who have defied political correctness to do what's right and fair we think of somebody like Rosa Parks not a not a not a a a you know a a woman with all kinds of accolades and degrees but just one particular day she was fed up with status quo she was commanded by City statue and by state law that when a white person came onto the bus she was supposed to give them her seat there were a few rows in the bus reserved for men and women of color in the back of the bus she chose her receipt that day and she refused to give it up and that's why she was given the great honor of Li lying in Repose in the capital building of our nation not a politician not a former president not a former president's wife but a hero nonetheless because she decided that I'm not going to be status quo and I'm not going to be politically correct today I'm going to keep my seat Mel believed that an emotional display is reserved for the lower class citizens that's how it was in the 50s and 60s in this nation when Pentecost was burning like a fire yes sir and the people mocked them and made fun of them and said they put itching powder on them and that's why they act the way they do did you know there were uh young Pentecostals early Pentecostals that were tarred and feathered tied up held captive painted with tar and rolled in chicken feathers because of the way they worshiped do you think that I would read a history like that and then let the devil get my praise in 2023 no way she was a slave to status Mikel was a slave to Pride she was a slave to putting on airs she had to be careful how she acted because the cameras were always on her so to speak right but David didn't care care he didn't care in the message all the days of our life sounds like a slop Hopper doesn't it brother brandom said in paragraph 24 now we hear so much today about we are free oh we live in a beautiful America we're free oh the air is full of it books are wrote of it thousands of them but you're a million miles from being free brother Bram said you're not free don't you be deceived by that America's one of the greatest deceived Nations and in more bondage than any place I know of he said they're worse in bondage than communism could put them wait a minute communism can only hurt the body they can only put the body in bondage but when the Devil comes in he puts the soul in bondage anybody with me and man is a slave America is a bunch of slaves slaves you may be a SL slave to Pride you might walk up and down the streets and go through every store in every fashion that you can see on television and go from store to store trying to buy something you become a slave to it you become a slave to your dressing amen you can become a slave to your money amen that's the only thing that you you think of it is to make money grab and put it up here if you do that you're a Slave in the message Jehovah Gyra in paragraph 32 he said what ought all our conduct to be not like the world but we should act like Sons and Daughters of God conduct ourselves like King's children come on not like listen listen very carefully not like slaves of Fashions and slaves of passion and slaves of Pride did you know that the root of homosexual sin is not gender confusion did you know the root of homosexual behavior is pride yes sir did you know the Bible specifically tells us that that the reason that Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed was not who was sleeping with who but it was the pride it was the worship of the human body did you know that the reason why this thing begins to come and now it's loose and now it runs from generation to generation come on now yes sir and now we not only have to deal with the spirit of homosexuality but we even have to deal with what the Bible call CS an eminent Spirit men who are not actively engaged in any kind of perversion but who act so feminine in all of their behaviors and the Bible doesn't say that's because he was raised by his mother the Bible says that's that is not pleasing to God and it has to be dealt with you know in our society it runs in music The Spirit uh uh of the effeminate Spirit and the pride Spirit and the homosexual spirit is is rampant in the musical industry and that's why it makes its way all the way to the church and it's pride and it has to be dealt with or it'll steal a generation of gifted talented young men gifted talented young women and pull them into slavery amen a spirit that didn't start with abuse as a child or rejection by a male figure but a spirit that was rooted and grounded and has its origin in Pride America's become slaves of fashion slaves of passion and slaves of Pride and we should be Sons and Daughters of God and act like it and conduct ourselves that way let our conversations and everything be what se but David didn't pay any attention to his wife's warnings David is beside himself the ark is coming home he can't control himself he can't stop furthermore he doesn't want to stop he's excited and it must be in display of his worship the way you express your joy May create misunder understanding it is likely that someone may misunderstand why you dance ecclesiast eses 3:4 there's a time to mourn and a time to dance and you may misunderstood what time it is in my life but I'm going to dance anyway David remember what he said it was before the Lord who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler of the Lord's people I will celebrate before the Lord I will become even more undignified than this and I will be humiliated in my own eyes but by these slave girls you spoke of I will be held in honor David said probably if I had to watch this in replay I would hang my head in embarrassment for how I acted I didn't mean to show out when people are in love they don't keep it to themselves they show it on the outside when people love the Lord hard they don't sit on their hands in church they show it on the outside they notify their face they notify their hands they notify their arms they notify their feet they notify their legs anybody with me dancing will cost you I'm going to tell you something people don't dance they don't worship like that because they know it's going to cost them something you better be willing to pay the price when I'm talking about dancing I'm not just talking about physical moving I'm talking about all forms of expression of joy and excitement and worship it wasn't a mere dance what David was doing was a sacrifice it was as much as a sacrifice as the animals that were being slain David was stepping out of his comfort zone hello sir now there's a Woman by the name of Anne Graham Loz you know who that is don't you the daughter of Billy Graham she says it simply this way this is where I got the title I brought this message in 2019 but I updated a little bit for today here's what she said well isn't she a woman preacher well she might be I I I don't follow her Ministry but she's not an idiot she said something powerful here she said a Christian will dance or die amen you know I hear message people quoting Muhammad Ali I hear them quoting all kinds of sports figures and common uh uh uh current interest folks but they might have something to say about me quoting a woman preacher I do it a lot I was raised by one a Christian will dance or die this what she said a Christian will dance or die you have no other choice you dance before the King of Kings or sit on the PE and be critical of those who do on and she said as soon as you're critical of those who do you die you either shout amen or you sit quietly and criticize those who do there's no neutrality in here when we enter into this holy and sacred place you're one or the other you're a dancer or a Dy you're a worshiper or a stick in the mud as we all know she said she goes on to say you can't even watch others dance and get by it's do it or die I want you to know there are moments in our life where if we don't dance if we don't worship if we don't press in we die maybe not physical death but spiritual death and isn't that worse to be sitting on a Pew spiritually dead isn't that worse than being physically dead I think so as we all know your dignity image and reputation are intangible assets but in some ways they can be far more valuable than money often we would give anything to protect and defend our our image what we're seeing in David's dance is that the man came to a place in his walk with God that he was so overwhelmed with gratitude so full of adoration and love for God that he took off his dignity royalty respect reputation and image and threw them all at the feet of God David's dance truly belongs in the domain of genuine worship but only because he sacrificed everything that had made him a king right there he gave it all up to God we may have to lay aside much of what we have used as our identity in the coming future the shells and facades that we have hidden behind the costume right that we have used to give us a false confidence Jesus has a different robe that he wants us to wear Isaiah 61:10 are you still there yes sir I will rejoice greatly in the Lord my soul shall be joyful for my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deth himself with ornaments and as a bride adorne herself with her Jewels he wants you to lay aside the the the Garment of Pride the Garment of dignity the Garment of of royalty let me remind you of what brother brandham said in the message Is possessing all things I just shared this with you recently but I'm closing musicians are coming what a wonderful day to try to preach something like this when our worship was more sedated than usual Joshua I need another water son please this is a a two bottle day David danced before the Lord when the ark was brought back to its resting place amen when David saw the word it it wasn't just the ark it was what was in the ark the tables of stone brought back to its right place Hallelujah when the word is restored to its rightful place David saw it and he rejoiced by dancing before the Lord David rejoiced and danced in the spirit and even brother brandom somehow understood the word around and around and around why why did he dance because he felt it because the music moved him no all the word well they wouldn't be dancing like that they wouldn't be dancing like that if it wasn't for the beat of the drums oh they wouldn't be dancing like that if it for the tempo of the music oh they wouldn't be dancing like that let me tell you the dance that God put down in my heart yes I don't need no music I don't need no Tempo I don't need no drums hello well if I were African-American I would dance like that if I was African I'd dance like that if I was Spanish I'd dance like that if I was Brazilian I'd dance like that if I was from South America or Central America I would dance like that uhuh you wouldn't you do just what you do now set David saw the word he danced simply because the word was back in its place now how are you going to tell me we're beyond that kind of worship and how are you going to tell me it was all Pentecostal Shook and how are you going to tell me that we shouldn't have life in our services when David saw the word back in its place so they say things like you know don't carry on like that we've got the word well brother sister that's why we can carry on like that we've got the word the word is back in its place what the world needs is not out of some Seminary some theological mixup but an oldfashioned godsent preacher behind the pool pit with the word seeing God Vindicated proof then David said glory to God this is it and around and around and around and around his little stuck up wife don't you be her don't you be her little stuck up wife sat there set up there being the King's Daughter said why he embarrass he he he embarrasses me and David said you don't like that watch this and around and around he went again come on now come on now come on now devil if you don't like it you better look out I don't think that's the right spirit I don't think you ought to worship to spite somebody I don't either I think you ought to worship to glorify by God but if you can spite somebody in the process did I just say that if you can just shove it in the devil's face the old Pentecost say give that devil a black eye Hallelujah If You Can Dance un the Lord and give the devil a black eye at the same time why not go around and around around and around and around and around around why not why not why not what if we all did that at the same time it'd be an oldfashioned Pentecostal Revival I can answer that for you David said you don't like that watch this and around around went yeah oh my what a time he had you know God looked down out of heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart why he had done lost all Pride he had done lost all of this yes he was married to a king's daughter but that wasn't even considered then he know that he was acquainted with the possessor of heavens and earth and here was the word of God coming right back among them again and David was so happy who he danced he just danced as hard as he could Miriam she grabbed the tambourine and went down the bank dancing on the other side after she had come through the Red Sea and seen her enemies drown then she could dance in the spirit oh Hallelujah that's right now see after after the battle's won then the glory of God comes down that's right you can wait till it's all over and then dance little selfish or You Can Dance In the Heat of the battle I believe I'm going to dance in the battle enticing Spirits David danced before the Lord and his wife laughed at him and looked down out of heaven and God looked down out of heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart but his motives listen now we're nearly done his motives was right his life was right behind it remember remember Church remember that's where the word comes in you've got to live as high as you jump you you got to live like you're dancing and you're not dancing to the sway of the music that's right you're not dancing to be seen you're not dancing to draw attention to yourself and you know you won't do it if everybody's worshiping they won't even have a time to watch what you're doing that's right come on now now uh uh let me see I might not read that one because it's long and I just read it so I'll read a shorter version which I've also read in in in from the message only believe brother brandham said I never was at a dance in my life remember I just read this a few Tuesday nights ago but I heard only a holy dance one time in church I never forgot that when we was still a Baptist Church that's part of the problem right there I would always criticize kind of in my my heart he inherited criticism of dancing from the Baptist influence of his life why can't we just say that move on is that taking away from the prophet I hope not I think God knew exactly where he was going to find him sir he knew exactly where he was going to be so I don't think that's being critical to say this was his idea he said I'd always kind of criticize in my heart I wouldn't say it out loud out because I'd be afraid to do that anything that God does dot dot dot I always kind of thought it was kind of strange to see when I seen first got acquainted with the Pentecostal people to see them dance you know dance around I thought now you know that ain't in the Bible what what are they dancing about and then one day I was teaching from a chart on Daniel in Revelation well you know teaching on a chart ain't in the Bible either but it's a good way to express what you want to say it was a New Year's night I was going to teach on the chart until midnight it wasn't a chart like a Blackboard I was teaching and there was some Pentecostal people had come from Louisville uh they had awesome sisters a sister oh a sister pastored a church over there and she had a they had washboards and thimbles bless God we don't believe in Drums but we'll have washboards and Thimbles why to keep the Rhythm you need a little percussion in your sound and all kinds of little things to make rackets with and they all got harmonizing some way I don't know what it was and they she started playing the piano and all these girls got up there got the hitting with these simbl on the washboards and thing they got the they was playing that song there's going to be meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by well that little girl that was playing little lady Pastor she just turn white just like chalk and she just began to play in in such a way I I'd never seen anything play like it in my life and I thought now what's that and then one on the washboard she got to doing the same thing then here two or three got up and a little blond head got to dancing right in the floor and I thought oh my right up and down the floor as hard as she could just to dance in that way like the little old girl about 16 18 years old I was just a young fellow myself now isn't that something right here in my church how I'll ever live that down and watching her like that and I thought what do they do that for there are people so foreign to it among the 333,000 people that have viewed the real it is so forign to some people they sayh are they swaying oh my goodness swaying you bunch of lunatics swaying can you imagine but but if you if you don't know about it you don't know about it they said why are they swaying Lord have mercy if swaying offends people I am in trouble what can I do that I won't offend and another person says I wish there was a church like this near Washington and another person said I wish we had a little more of that in my church and then somebody says I hope they don't think there's a God who sees them there's not even a God and there they are dancing before a God that doesn't even exist and somebody else sees and says it makes me want to praise the Lord like I've never praised him before come on it's according to the seed that's in you well how I ever live that down watching her like that and I thought why do they have to do that for why do they have to do that why couldn't they just played their music you know like a preacher like a six-foot icicle who's doing no more than blocking a picture of the baptistry the picture hanging on the back of the baptistry not feeding the body come on everywhere no anointing why do they do that for couldn't they just play their music and went on let it alone like that I thought well that's terrible I got to thinking now in the Bible is there such a thing as dancing and I remember that David danced around the ark when he saw the ark coming see he danced before the Lord and the Lord said he's a man after my own heart hello I thought well now did he what did he dance for well they had a victory yeah yeah and Miriam when they crossed over the Red Sea Moses sang in the spirit Miriam took a tambourine and began to beat it and they went down along the bank all the daughters of Israel dancing in the spirit is that right he said and I seen that dancing was when they had Victory I got to thinking well maybe I haven't got Victory enough that's one of your examples you said I don't have enough Victory I got to thinking about you know after a while I got to patent my foot Lord have mercy you might as well call that a Revival in a message church I got to patting my foot what did I do to it and before I knowed I was out there hello read it you got to have the context of the quote if I just took a portion of that I could preach that brother Brandon was out dancing with the girl he just meant I was sharing an aisle with her brother when the Holy Ghost moves and you feel freedom to dance you might share an aisle with somebody else that has the victory are you telling me if I don't Worship the Lord I don't have the victory that's exactly what I'm telling you I didn't say you had to dance to have a victory I said if you don't Worship the Lord you don't have the Victory and if you get enough of the victory you may have to do like David did and lay your pride down I'm closing psalm 16 8-11 no you're not well maybe I'm not but I think I am I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved go back I want everybody to see it that is not the same as the song I sung a minute ago right sir I'll sit right here and hinder those around me I shall not be moved this is because I want to see the Lord I've set the Lord before me I'm not looking at my neighbor I'm looking at the Lord therefore I shall not be moved by anything that goes on around me in my life therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh shall also Rest In Hope for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither Willl thou suffer thine Holy One to seek ion thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand there PL in thy presence there's fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more am let me read this the fourth seal let's just take a moment let's think about David he said he got all stimulated too I want you to hear what what stimulated David he said my cup is running over he said I believe he really had a great event in his life what caus him to do that now listen what brother BR when he was in the spirit for he was a prophet we know he was the Bible said so he's talking about David Prophet David now for he was a prophet he was in the spirit and look what he saw what I just read to you that's right brother random said he saw he seen the resurrection he said if you'd like me to read it Psalms 168 to11 that's what I just read moreover My Flesh was made glad I rest in Hope because you'll not leave my soul in Hell neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption brother brandom is saying that as David worshiped he was caught in the spirit and saw the resurrection no wonder his cup got to running over he said and after I tell you that his cup got to running over because he seen no matter what it was oh he seen the resurrection and he was really his cup Run Over Again David had another running over in 2 Samuel being that you got your pencils out 2 Samuel 6:14 there had been a dry spell they had took the Ark the enemy had come in and got the ark took it down and set it up before deeon deeon that's the fish god of the Philistines and deeon fell on his face and took it to another city and plagues broke out that was the hottest thing that had ever they'd ever had on their hands down there the word and they couldn't get rid of it cuz it was out of its place now when they put it on the ox cart and started back and when David saw the ark coming you know what he did he got so full so he's telling the different things that we we mentioned this morning he got so full and his cup got to running over you ever had your cup run over and his cup got to run and over and what did he call that remember what he says the stimulation of Revelation praise be to God when he seen the word being revealed back into Israel again he danced in the spirit all around and around and around and around and around like that his cup got to running over you see why he saw why he saw why are you rejoicing if you're rejoicing for any other reason you may miss the Mark if you're jumping for any other reason you may miss the mark But if you have rejoicing in your spirit because the word has found its proper place in in me yeah in you he said and I think that would make anybody anybody oh my preachers included come on that would make anybody get a little stimulated when they see after all these years and then the True Word by the promise that it would be being brought forth and Vindicated what a time what a time now when was this fourth seal still talking about David dancing in the spirit last quote I will restore De Moines oh no there's two more they're short if I don't get them I'll have to take another service on dancing and I'm I'm I'm tired of preaching on Dancing I'm just ready to dance see where it started in Genesis here their fundamental ritualistic beautiful big churches Orthodox people my in their beliefs sure but there's no signs following that'd be a problem wouldn't it Jesus said these signs will follow them it come from Genesis and going into Revelations the same thing what signs following all the way through the book Genesis to Revelation same thing I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them by the grace of God by one of who those that have it from Genesis to Revelation signs following wouldn't swap it for nothing in the world oh sure they call me this and that or the other that don't make any difference what they call me God calls me his son amen that's the main thing you see I seen that little girl that time David's wife that hid behind her fan Fanning like that she thought David her sweetheart was the cutest little thing but when oh honey she only saw him as her way into the palace he could have had a ward on his nose and she wouldn't have cared she was looking out for herself not for David but he was maybe attractive to her in some way but when the ark come in and David saw it read that a Revival was in session praise God little Lord David went down there and danced around the ark as hard as he could go why she said you embarrass me why you embarrass me my well I'll have the general Council to put you out we'll call the Deacon board you embarrass me he said if you don't like that watch this and down he went around and around and around and around the ark he went rejoicing happy shouting praising God and rejoicing Hallelujah said if you don't like that God looked down out of the heavens he said David you're a man after my own heart how many of you'd like God to say that about you so it don't make any difference what the world says what the message clicks say right it's What God Says amen my last one demonology now of everything that God has the devil has a counterfeit you go and whatever you want to do you find like these old dances is of the devil I want everybody to read this one together 1 2 3 but God well I can't dance because the world dances well I can't dance because I see in the charismatic churches and women up there swaying and dancing that's just other excuses right God has a holy dance people the Bible said so listen what brother random tells about himself I was one of the greatest Critics on that you ever seen till God told me just what to do I found out that Miriam danced in the spirit David danced when he had the Victory and all many time all of it was through was Victory it was dancing that stand holy dancing what makes it holy what makes it holy Dancy what's the difference between holy dancing and worldly dancing holy dancing is unto the Lord it's not rock and roll based it's not sway Cadence of the music based it's not just excited to be excited based it's remembering God has give us the word we go to we get to go to heaven God has given us the word isn't he good give him a hand clap give him [Applause] [Music] the river of God sets my feet to dancing the river of God fills my heart with tear the river of God fills my mouth with laughter
