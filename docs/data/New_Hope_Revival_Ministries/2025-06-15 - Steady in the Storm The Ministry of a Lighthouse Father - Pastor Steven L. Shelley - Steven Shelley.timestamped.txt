[33:31] sin and shame and guilt and condemnation
[33:34] for our healing and every other thing
[33:36] that would plague the human race and he
[33:39] would go back to the father. He sent the

[33:48] here among us indwelling us. And I give
[33:52] him praise. He's worthy. Can you give
[33:54] him another shot of praise today?

[34:16] his presence today. As we get ready to
[34:19] pray, we we know that he is well able to
[34:22] handle every situation that we have. We
[34:25] want to remember the nation of Israel
[34:28] today. We have been praying for them,
[34:30] asking the Lord to protect her as she is
[34:33] defending herself on many fronts. We are
[34:36] asking the Lord to be with Sister Flo
[34:39] today. She's not feeling well. Ask God
[34:41] to strengthen her and help her. There
[34:44] are some others who are sick and um
[34:47] little something trying to go around.
[34:49] Let's believe that it will just stop and
[34:53] God will raise up there. There are some
[34:55] who are here today and some away for
[34:58] extended time and need to all be lifted
[35:00] up to the Lord and always remember
[35:02] Sister Audrey if you will. She's
[35:04] fighting a battle still, but God is good
[35:07] and faithful. He is faithful. Yes. Amen.

[37:48] your own blood. That is your provided
[37:51] way today. That's right. And we come
[37:54] before you, oh king, to worship you and
[37:57] to adore you, to bless your name and
[38:01] lift you up. That's right. because you
[38:04] are worthy of all of it because you gave
[38:07] your own life for us.
[38:13] There was something in the song earlier
[38:15] that said you're not in need of anything
[38:18] that we could give.
[38:21] But there is something that tells me
[38:23] that you're in need of something and
[38:25] that is our love, our affection. And so
[38:29] right now we tell you, Father, we love
[38:32] you.
[38:34] We honor you for who you are.
[38:37] And we bless your name.
[38:40] Father, we thank you for the nation of
[38:42] Israel. Yes, sir. We thank you for the
[38:45] promises for the Jewish people.
[38:49] We thank you for the covenant that we
[38:51] were grafted in with your blood. That is
[38:54] right. We thank you for the promises
[38:56] that one day you will come to the city
[38:59] of Jerusalem and and establish your
[39:02] throne as king. But right now they need
[39:07] the strong hand of the Lord of hosts.
[39:10] And we ask that you would watch over
[39:14] Israel. You would watch over Jerusalem,
[39:16] the city of the great king. Would you
[39:19] protect them? Would you hold them in
[39:22] your right hand? Oh God, would you give
[39:25] wisdom and leadership by the spirit?
[39:29] We lift up Benjamin Netanyahu. Oh God,
[39:33] would you give him supernatural wisdom,
[39:36] know what to do and when to do it. Give
[39:38] him the grace to make righteous
[39:40] decisions. Would you protect your
[39:43] people, oh God? Would you protect the
[39:46] people of Iran?
[39:51] But would you bring down that evil
[39:53] empire?
[39:58] [Music]
[39:59] Oh God,
[40:02] but Lord, your word is coming to pass.
[40:06] You your plan is unfolding. You're a
[40:08] sovereign God. But Lord, would you raise
[40:11] up your people today? May we step into
[40:15] position in you.
[40:18] Give us the grace to follow you. Yes,
[40:21] sir. And take the authority that you've
[40:23] given.
[40:25] Execute authority in the realm of the
[40:27] spirit.
[40:36] There are going to come sons
[40:40] that are going to please their father
[40:43] fully obedient
[40:45] to the voice of God
[40:48] and bring glory to his name.
[40:53] The world is going to see
[40:56] Jesus Christ manifested on this earth
[41:00] through people that have been redeemed
[41:02] by the blood of Jesus.
[41:08] But Father, there are some that are
[41:10] fighting in their bodies.
[41:13] You are a heal. You never change. You
[41:15] will never change. You've always been
[41:17] the same. You're a supernatural God. And
[41:21] we just pray for healing for the bodies.
[41:24] That's right. There are fighting
[41:26] sickness.
[41:28] So in the in the name of Jesus, we just
[41:31] talk to that sickness to leave their
[41:33] body and speak healing and wholeness in
[41:36] Jesus' name.
[41:40] We just bless you, Father. We thank you
[41:43] for in this this Father's Day. We we
[41:45] just thank you for life, for your love,
[41:48] and for your care.
[41:51] And we just pray for the service that
[41:54] you would just accomplish something for
[41:57] eternity in the hearts of your people in
[42:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[42:07] Thank you Lord.

[55:22] this morning, but uh I'm in
[55:26] and you're in and he's in. And we're
[55:29] praying for those of course who uh could
[55:31] not be with us. Cade is uh in Indiana
[55:35] this weekend for his sister's graduation
[55:37] and for his dad and uh we miss him of
[55:41] course and others who are not able to be
[55:44] with us but uh there's something in the
[55:46] air. I think I know what it is. I think
[55:49] it's him and I think he's worthy. He's
[55:53] worthy to be praised. He's so good.
[55:56] Amen. Today is Nora
[56:00] Ellsworth's birthday. Stand up Nora. No,
[56:04] stand up Norah. Oh, you are standing.

[56:22] You may not be the you may not be the
[56:24] star attraction right now with a brand
[56:27] new baby here, but you're you are still
[56:29] a star. you and Millie both. Brother
[56:33] Shane, I saw that tomorrow is your
[56:35] oldest daughter, Abigail's birthday. And
[56:37] so, we're uh calling that out. Even
[56:40] though we don't get to see her very
[56:41] often, we're calling it out to give
[56:43] everybody here who knows her, who met
[56:46] her, an opportunity to lift up her name
[56:49] to the Lord in prayer that God will be
[56:51] with her, and minister to her needs.
[56:54] Amen. Wednesday, Michael. Oh, you're
[56:58] getting ever so close
[57:02] to be to another even number birthday. I
[57:06] saw in fact this is your last year in in
[57:10] one decade
[57:12] and you're moving into the next decade
[57:15] and I would just say happy 39th
[57:17] birthday. Oh. Oh,
[57:21] to you on Wednesday.
[57:23] And uh I would say that uh most of us
[57:26] would really enjoy being 39 again. So
[57:29] enjoy it for us. And it's not old and
[57:34] maybe you all are chasing twins and
[57:36] that's enough to make anybody feel old.
[57:39] But um God knew what he was doing. He
[57:43] didn't give them to me.
[57:46] He knew where they needed to go. And I
[57:49] foolishly thought at one time that's
[57:51] what I would like because my grandmother
[57:53] was a twin. And uh but I have
[57:55] experienced enough to know that it takes
[57:58] a special somebody.
[58:00] Uh Megan, I hope you got it.
[58:06] I would say with the big collection
[58:07] you've got already, you'll make it
[58:09] through somehow. Uh when brother Gley
[58:12] was welcoming brother Matt and Sister
[58:14] Doris, I was thinking, well, they I
[58:16] don't know uh all that much about them.
[58:18] I've only known him a few years, but I
[58:20] know one thing. They they raised two
[58:22] good daddies,
[58:24] and I don't know uh I don't know Matthew
[58:27] as much as I know Luke. But I know the
[58:29] kind of daddy that Did I say it right,
[58:32] Matthew? Uh but I know the kind of daddy
[58:35] Luke is. and uh you all did quite well
[58:39] uh with him and uh we're thankful very
[58:42] very thankful to see you all. Uh on
[58:45] Thursday of this week is uh my wife's
[58:48] dad's birthday. Poppy will be 82 years
[58:51] old. We love him and we pray for him. He
[58:54] needs a lot of prayer. Perhaps not
[58:56] physically but but in other ways that he
[58:59] would uh uh stand up and do what the
[59:03] word of God teaches us to do. It's a
[59:05] It's not a good idea to start getting in
[59:07] your tweening ears and slack up. That's
[59:11] right. So, take Thursday uh if you think
[59:14] of our poppy because we do love him. If
[59:17] you think of him, pray for him that God
[59:20] will give him strength to end well. It's
[59:24] important.
[59:26] Uh somebody else is having a birthday.
[59:29] First of all, let me say quickly, uh,
[59:32] Axel, what's your real real name? J.
[59:35] Jaden. Uh, we don't Did I say it wrong?
[59:39] Jaden. Is that right? We don't really
[59:41] know each other well enough for me to
[59:43] poke on you, but brace yourself.
[59:48] Get ready. My heart skipped a beat when
[59:51] I saw you come in today. And I want to
[59:54] tell you, you clean up very, very well.
[59:58] [Applause]
[1:00:03] I knew,
[1:00:05] Jason. I knew that somewhere underneath
[1:00:07] that shag was a good-looking boy.
[1:00:11] Goodlook, handsome, nice, smart,
[1:00:13] intelligent young man. And I don't know
[1:00:16] the circumstances of how it happened,
[1:00:18] but praise the Lord
[1:00:21] because you're shining this morning. And
[1:00:25] uh maybe your dad is encouraging. I have
[1:00:28] no idea because he may be in a little
[1:00:30] bit of a crisis this week because he's
[1:00:32] going to turn uh 45.
[1:00:36] I think
[1:00:38] that that is uh you know that is just
[1:00:42] about the place where the hill breaks.
[1:00:47] But we're thankful.
[1:00:50] I'm thankful they no longer wait to see
[1:00:52] whether nanny can get here or not. I'm
[1:00:55] glad they're here. Thank you all for
[1:00:57] coming all the way from the Graange. God
[1:01:00] bless you.
[1:01:02] That's Friday.
[1:01:04] And Bethany, uh, she is still just a
[1:01:09] young lady, but she's having a birthday
[1:01:11] with a five on the end of it, too. Not
[1:01:15] 35, but 25 on Friday, the same day. Uh,
[1:01:20] and we want to wish her ahead of time a
[1:01:23] very, very, very happy birthday. God
[1:01:26] bless you, Bethany.
[1:01:32] And, uh, our youngest daughter, Mariah,
[1:01:34] is having her little graduation get
[1:01:36] together on Friday as well. And we had a
[1:01:40] homeschool catalog come to the house
[1:01:42] yesterday. It made its way to my stack
[1:01:45] of mail. And I started to go and ask my
[1:01:47] wife if she wanted to burn it.
[1:01:51] You reckon she would just like to set it
[1:01:53] on fire and uh uh and and jump up and
[1:01:57] down like a crazy woman to think that
[1:01:59] the last one is uh has made it through.
[1:02:03] God is good.
[1:02:05] Amen. He's faithful. He deserves the
[1:02:09] praise.
[1:02:11] Uh so today after the service, we'll
[1:02:13] have lunch together for those of you who
[1:02:15] want to. I realize that some people like
[1:02:18] to have a smaller get together for
[1:02:20] Mother's Day or Father's Day and of
[1:02:22] course you're always free to do that.
[1:02:24] The restaurants are usually sort of full
[1:02:27] and uh because everybody remembers all
[1:02:30] of a sudden they have a mother and all
[1:02:31] of a sudden they remember they have a
[1:02:33] father so they try to get them to the
[1:02:35] steakhouse or whatever. So uh those of
[1:02:38] us uh who uh didn't want to fight that
[1:02:40] crowd, we're we're going to be having
[1:02:42] lunch together today. And um you know
[1:02:45] it's just for for some of us, brother
[1:02:48] Gilly, it's just really like another day
[1:02:50] as much as I enjoy being a father
[1:02:52] because we know where we have to be and
[1:02:54] what we have to do and and uh so we just
[1:02:57] do it. And if that's the case in your
[1:02:59] house, do a little something extra for
[1:03:02] dad another day. if if your whole day is
[1:03:05] spent at church and then do a little
[1:03:08] something for him because I want you to
[1:03:10] know um that it's a blessing to have a
[1:03:15] dad who would encourage you to go to
[1:03:17] church and who doesn't just send his
[1:03:20] family to church but comes with them. Uh
[1:03:25] I mean I don't have a whole lot of
[1:03:26] confidence in somebody never have who
[1:03:29] who is all the time uh telling the
[1:03:32] family they ought to go
[1:03:34] you know, you you pull up your
[1:03:36] bootstraps and go too. You can sit
[1:03:38] through anything for a couple hours. But
[1:03:40] we are thankful and blessed to have some
[1:03:43] men who understand the importance
[1:03:45] uh of being a father and of setting an
[1:03:48] example. You can't just tell somebody
[1:03:50] what to do. You've got to show them. And
[1:03:53] we're blessed in that regard. And I'm
[1:03:56] thankful. I'm blessed to have these
[1:03:58] musicians today. They they are they're
[1:04:01] the the cream of the crop to me and I
[1:04:04] want to thank them for their service
[1:04:07] to the Lord to us.
[1:04:10] Would you stand and sing this little
[1:04:12] chorus with me before we look to the
[1:04:15] word today? Just the chorus I think of
[1:04:18] uh and I thank God for the lighthouse. I
[1:04:20] don't know what key that would be, but I
[1:04:23] want you just to sing this little chorus
[1:04:24] with me a couple times and then we will
[1:04:27] go right to the word. Amen. Amen. Sister
[1:04:29] Kathy, good to have you home. And and I
[1:04:34] thank God
[1:04:36] for
[1:04:38] the lighthouse.
[1:04:41] Will I owe my life to him?
[1:04:48] For Jesus
[1:04:50] is
[1:04:52] the lighthouse.
[1:04:55] And from the rocks of sin,
[1:05:01] he has shown
[1:05:04] his light around me
[1:05:08] so that I
[1:05:11] might clearly see.
[1:05:15] If it wasn't
[1:05:18] for the lighthouse,
[1:05:22] tell me where would this ship be. And I
[1:05:29] thank God
[1:05:32] for
[1:05:35] Oh, you've been that lighthouse. I owe
[1:05:38] my life to him.
[1:05:43] King Jesus.
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:49] Oh, and from the rocks of sin,
[1:05:56] he
[1:05:57] has shown the light, his light around
[1:06:02] me,
[1:06:04] so that I
[1:06:06] might
[1:06:08] clearly see.
[1:06:10] If it wasn't
[1:06:14] for the lighthouse,
[1:06:17] tell me where would this I think I want
[1:06:22] us to sing the second verse. Everybody
[1:06:26] that lives
[1:06:29] around me,
[1:06:31] they said, "Why don't you tear that old
[1:06:34] lighthouse
[1:06:36] down?
[1:06:38] You know the big ships, they don't sail
[1:06:42] this way anymore. There ain't no use in
[1:06:47] that old thing hanging around.
[1:06:52] Oh, but can my mind goes back to that
[1:06:57] stormy night
[1:07:00] when just in time
[1:07:03] I saw the light. It was the light from
[1:07:09] that old lighthouse,
[1:07:13] the one that stands
[1:07:15] up there on the hill. And I thank God
[1:07:23] for Oh Jesus.
[1:07:26] Oh Jesus.
[1:07:30] I owe my life to you.
[1:07:34] Lord Jesus
[1:07:38] is the lighthouse
[1:07:41] and from the rocks
[1:07:45] of sin
[1:07:47] he has shown the light
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:55] so that I
[1:07:57] might clearly see.
[1:08:02] And if it wasn't for that old
[1:08:06] lighthouse,
[1:08:08] tell me where would this ship be?
[1:08:16] Would you praise the Lord for the
[1:08:18] lighthouse?
[1:08:21] Praise God.
[1:08:24] Praise God.
[1:08:27] Let's do this real quick. We'll have the
[1:08:29] fathers to come at the end and get a
[1:08:32] little just it's just a little token
[1:08:34] gift from the church to let you know we
[1:08:36] appreciate what you do. Um but let's do
[1:08:39] this real quick. Uh brother Shaw, you
[1:08:43] have to tell your age. This is one day
[1:08:44] out of the year you have to tell your
[1:08:46] age.
[1:08:48] 66.
[1:08:50] Is there any fathers here older than 66?
[1:08:53] Most of them are in heaven, right?
[1:08:57] Oh.
[1:09:00] We give brother Shaw a time because we
[1:09:02] at one time we had some older daddies
[1:09:05] here but they've gone to the Lord and we
[1:09:08] miss him but and so we give brother Shaw
[1:09:10] a hard time. He's always praying. You
[1:09:12] know why he does so much witnessing on
[1:09:14] the street and all. He's hoping he can
[1:09:16] win an older dad to the Lord to bring
[1:09:18] him over here to bring him over here to
[1:09:21] church.
[1:09:23] So, at the end of the service, get one
[1:09:25] of these uh bigger bags, would you? Just
[1:09:28] a little a little gift. What about the
[1:09:29] youngest dad? Uh Benjamin, how old are
[1:09:33] you? Is is is that is is there a father
[1:09:37] 26 or younger?
[1:09:40] You know, that's that's kind of uh
[1:09:43] that's good.
[1:09:47] Much younger than that, you're you're
[1:09:48] you're a baby yourself. So anyway,
[1:09:52] Benjamin, be sure you get one. Uh, happy
[1:09:55] Father's Day to both of you brothers,
[1:09:57] older and younger.
[1:10:01] Uh, and then the father with the most
[1:10:03] children present is the way we like to
[1:10:06] do it. Brother Skip greeted me this
[1:10:08] morning and uh, told me he wouldn't be
[1:10:11] in the service with us, but uh, but he,
[1:10:15] you know, commented about it and and
[1:10:17] about our families and so forth. Brother
[1:10:20] Robert, uh,
[1:10:23] you only have one biological child, but
[1:10:25] you've been a daddy to, I would say, all
[1:10:29] of Sister Teresa's, but but it would be
[1:10:32] even larger than that, wouldn't it?
[1:10:34] Brother Shane, how many of your children
[1:10:37] are here today? Biological children.
[1:10:41] How many is that? Uh,
[1:10:43] four. Uh, Luke, how many you got now?
[1:10:49] Five and two on the way.
[1:10:53] That is Let Let me just make sure I make
[1:10:55] this clear. That is completion.
[1:10:59] Seven.
[1:11:02] We're not Catholics.
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:10] Did I just say that?
[1:11:13] He knows. He knows we're going to love
[1:11:14] him if he has a dozen and then we're
[1:11:17] going to send them right back where they
[1:11:19] belong. Five. Who? Anybody else have
[1:11:22] five
[1:11:24] in the ser? I mean, the man deserves
[1:11:26] something
[1:11:27] much more than it's in this bag. I'll
[1:11:29] tell you that right now. Anyway, that'll
[1:11:32] be for you, Luke. Uh, what about having
[1:11:33] the Holy Ghost the longest? Uh, uh,
[1:11:36] Brother Shaw, you've already you're
[1:11:37] you're knocked out of this. Uh, who who
[1:11:41] has had the Holy Ghost? What father here
[1:11:44] has had the Holy Ghost, the baptism of
[1:11:46] the Holy Ghost uh for for over 25 years?
[1:11:49] Let me see your hand. Well, that's quite
[1:11:52] a few of us. That's even Michael there.
[1:11:54] Uh how many of you have had the Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost over 30 years? Let me see your
[1:11:59] hand. That would be Brother Robert and
[1:12:01] myself and and Brother Greley. And we're
[1:12:04] we're kind of out of it, aren't we? Do
[1:12:06] how many years have you 37. How many
[1:12:10] years for you? 44. So, Brother Roberts,
[1:12:13] you come and get the the bag and we have
[1:12:16] an extra one that'll be yours. And uh
[1:12:19] today, aren't we blessed to have all
[1:12:22] these men?
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:27] All right. Thank you. Thank you. Psalm
[1:12:31] 127 beginning in verse three. If you'll
[1:12:34] just try. I know you've been standing.
[1:12:36] Sorry about that. Uh but let's keep
[1:12:39] standing if we're able for the reading
[1:12:41] of the word. And if you're not, well
[1:12:43] then you just rest.
[1:12:46] Verse three says, "Lo
[1:12:48] children are inheritage of the Lord." I
[1:12:54] like that. "And the fruit of the womb is
[1:12:57] his reward."
[1:12:59] Uh that's an interesting way for the
[1:13:02] psalmist to express that the fruit of
[1:13:05] the womb is his reward,
[1:13:09] the father's reward. That's pretty
[1:13:12] interesting. As arrows are in the hand
[1:13:16] of a mighty man, so are children of the
[1:13:21] youth.
[1:13:23] Happy
[1:13:24] is the man that hath his quiver full of
[1:13:27] them. Uh I would guess that that is when
[1:13:30] they're older.
[1:13:32] That they shall not be ashamed, but they
[1:13:36] shall speak with the enemies in the
[1:13:38] gate.
[1:13:40] So that's why I said I would think that
[1:13:43] this would be older. Speaking with the
[1:13:45] enemies in the gate means that they will
[1:13:48] they will be intelligent and wellversed
[1:13:50] and able to communicate. Brother Robert,
[1:13:53] that's the kind of kids we want to raise
[1:13:55] in this world is children who can speak
[1:13:59] and give account for for their for their
[1:14:02] faith as they get older to be able to
[1:14:05] not debate but be able to to tell the
[1:14:08] truth and speak the truth and not be so
[1:14:10] backward that they can't speak when you
[1:14:13] speak to them. This is what we want to
[1:14:16] do. And then let me read uh two more
[1:14:18] verses before you're seated. 1
[1:14:20] Corinthians chapter 16 verse 13 and 14.
[1:14:24] Watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit
[1:14:30] you like men.
[1:14:34] Be strong. This is 1 Corinthians 16. The
[1:14:37] this should be the second uh scripture.
[1:14:40] Watch ye stand fast in the faith. Quit
[1:14:44] you like men. Be strong. Let all your
[1:14:48] things be done with charity.
[1:14:52] Father, we thank you today that you have
[1:14:55] given us an opportunity most of all to
[1:14:57] come and worship you and lift you up.
[1:15:01] But we thank you for godly men in the
[1:15:03] house. And we thank you for godly men
[1:15:06] who are streaming this service today.
[1:15:09] We're living in a society where a godly
[1:15:13] man is sometimes looked over and
[1:15:16] seldomly celebrated. But I believe it's
[1:15:19] the church's responsibility to correct
[1:15:22] that among ourselves
[1:15:24] and bless these men who have chosen
[1:15:28] rather to serve the Lord than to follow
[1:15:32] in the way that is easier. May you
[1:15:36] strengthen them. Not just natural
[1:15:39] fathers,
[1:15:40] but may you strengthen every man of God
[1:15:44] here because by virtue of gender,
[1:15:49] we are almost expected to be leaders. So
[1:15:55] Lord, we lead. Whether we lead from the
[1:15:57] pulpit or whether we lead from the easy
[1:16:01] chair in the living room, we're leaders.
[1:16:04] strengthen each one I pray today and
[1:16:07] give us grace to hear a message that
[1:16:10] will both bless, value and encourage but
[1:16:15] will also challenge every man here to
[1:16:19] continue to be everything that you have
[1:16:22] asked us to be even in the midst of
[1:16:25] Satan's Eden. and we will give you all
[1:16:28] the honor and the praise and the glory
[1:16:30] for it's in the name above every name,
[1:16:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:16:35] pray. And the saint said, you may be
[1:16:38] seated. I'd like to read those two
[1:16:41] verses if you can find them again in 1
[1:16:44] Corinthians chapter 16. I'd like to read
[1:16:46] both verses in the Amplified because I'm
[1:16:50] always disturbed when I hear someone
[1:16:53] uh reading quit ye like men
[1:16:57] and and not explaining it a little bit
[1:17:00] because the last thing we need is for
[1:17:03] men to quit being men, right? And that's
[1:17:06] not what it means. It meant something
[1:17:08] different in 1611 that it means in 2025.
[1:17:13] So, I'm going to read it for you in the
[1:17:14] amplified, which just catches all the
[1:17:17] different meanings of the word. Be alert
[1:17:20] and on your guard.
[1:17:24] Is that a good word of encouragement and
[1:17:26] instruction to fathers and to godly men,
[1:17:30] be alert. I want you to know one second
[1:17:34] looking away. When you've got a toddler,
[1:17:37] you can't look away for two seconds.
[1:17:41] You'd be surprised. Benjamin told me
[1:17:43] this week, he said, "Dad, we we came in
[1:17:47] late one evening and we I said, "Maybe
[1:17:51] Jenna, you get your shower and I'll I'll
[1:17:53] make the baby a piece of toast before
[1:17:55] bed." And he said, "I looked away just a
[1:17:58] couple seconds. She's standing." I just
[1:18:00] sat her right down out of my arms right
[1:18:02] there and to put some jam. I don't know
[1:18:07] if that's the best idea or not because
[1:18:09] then she just licks the jam off and uh
[1:18:12] but anyway and he said I didn't look
[1:18:15] away but just just enough to dip the
[1:18:18] knife in the jam and she had already
[1:18:20] pinched her finger and and I said you
[1:18:24] know that that is just that's the way it
[1:18:26] is when you've got a curious toddler.
[1:18:28] You don't know how long she was in his
[1:18:31] arms looking down at that cabinet door.
[1:18:35] And to her it looked very interesting.
[1:18:38] And she was very glad to be free, wasn't
[1:18:40] she? Just long enough to get down there.
[1:18:42] And she didn't know that wasn't a place
[1:18:44] for her finger to go. I think she found
[1:18:46] that out also a few weeks ago in the in
[1:18:49] the air return. She found out that's a
[1:18:52] little narrow to get your finger down
[1:18:54] in. You you really when they're little,
[1:18:56] you cannot dare look the other
[1:18:59] direction.
[1:19:00] Uh what age does that stop
[1:19:06] when you die?
[1:19:09] When daddy's gone. Because when you're
[1:19:12] not watching them physically,
[1:19:15] then you get the real responsibility.
[1:19:18] And that means you're watching them
[1:19:20] spiritually.
[1:19:22] If you're under the impression that when
[1:19:24] they grow up and move out, you no longer
[1:19:26] have a spiritual responsibility, you're
[1:19:29] wrong. You may not have the same voice.
[1:19:33] You may not have the same liberty. You
[1:19:36] may not even have the same authority,
[1:19:38] but there's more than one way to
[1:19:40] establish authority. And one of those
[1:19:42] ways is by prayer and intercession.
[1:19:46] You're watching for them even when you
[1:19:48] can't physically be with them all the
[1:19:50] time. So, as important as it is to make
[1:19:54] sure they don't burn themselves and they
[1:19:56] don't stick their finger in the wrong
[1:19:58] place and get stuck and they don't fall
[1:20:01] off the porch and they don't stand up in
[1:20:03] the chair and fall over backward, it's
[1:20:05] even more important to make sure that
[1:20:08] you're watching for them spiritually.
[1:20:11] And if you've had a dad who who cared in
[1:20:15] the least,
[1:20:17] I mean in the least about your spiritual
[1:20:20] life, you're more blessed than the
[1:20:23] majority of the population.
[1:20:25] I didn't have that. And I I know there
[1:20:28] are many in this room and watching this
[1:20:31] service that didn't have that in their
[1:20:33] life. So maybe he wasn't all you wanted
[1:20:36] him to be or maybe all you thought that
[1:20:38] you would like for him to be or all that
[1:20:41] he needed to be. But if if he had any
[1:20:44] kind of influence over you toward
[1:20:47] spiritual things,
[1:20:49] if he ever prayed over you one time,
[1:20:52] you've got something to find that you
[1:20:55] can celebrate. Are you with me? Be alert
[1:20:59] and on your guard. Stand firm in your
[1:21:01] faith. your conviction, respecting man's
[1:21:06] relationship to God and divine things,
[1:21:10] keeping the trust and holy fervor born
[1:21:15] of faith and a part of it. Now, instead
[1:21:18] of quit ye like men, it actually means
[1:21:21] act like men. Right.
[1:21:25] That doesn't mean make sure you can fix
[1:21:27] a car, although that's a wonderful thing
[1:21:29] to be able to do, but but it doesn't
[1:21:32] just mean uh act like a man and be sure
[1:21:35] you know how to deer hunt. It it means
[1:21:39] uh uh spiritually speaking uh as the
[1:21:43] forefront
[1:21:45] act like men be courageous
[1:21:48] and always growing in strength because
[1:21:52] you're not only needing that strength
[1:21:55] personally, but you've got somebody
[1:21:57] looking to you for strength. If you're
[1:22:00] here and you feel like that is the
[1:22:02] truth, we'll wait on your amen. Amen. I
[1:22:05] want to tell you a story and I want your
[1:22:07] undivided attention. That's why you're
[1:22:09] here, right? Did you come for the word?
[1:22:12] Good. Then then let your attention be
[1:22:14] right up here. In a storm battered
[1:22:18] coastal village in the 1870s
[1:22:23] in the New England region of our nation,
[1:22:27] there was a lighthouse keeper whose name
[1:22:29] was Thomas.
[1:22:32] He stood as the sentinel of a
[1:22:34] treacherous shore where jagged cliffs
[1:22:38] claimed countless ships and countless
[1:22:42] lives.
[1:22:44] If you know anything about that rocky
[1:22:46] region of New England, you'll understand
[1:22:49] how that could have certainly been the
[1:22:50] case, particularly in the 1870s.
[1:22:54] Night after night, Thomas ascended the
[1:22:57] towers creaking iron stairs
[1:23:01] with the seas roar echoing below. His
[1:23:05] calloused hands trimmed the wick of the
[1:23:10] lantern
[1:23:11] to shear away the blackened ends.
[1:23:16] He polished the fresnal lens until it
[1:23:19] gleamed like a crystal. and he poured
[1:23:22] oil to fuel a flame that would pierce
[1:23:27] even the darkest fog. His children Sarah
[1:23:31] 10 and Caleb 8, huddled by the base of
[1:23:37] the lighthouse tower,
[1:23:40] watching the beam sweep across the
[1:23:44] horizon of the sea. Their eyes were wide
[1:23:48] with wonder, and their bodies were
[1:23:51] trembling gently at the noise of the
[1:23:55] storm.
[1:23:57] One wild November night, a gale howled
[1:24:01] with such intensity that waves were
[1:24:04] pounding the rocks like thunder, and the
[1:24:08] lantern's oil had begun to dwindle. and
[1:24:12] the weak neglected in the chaos of
[1:24:17] preparation for an oncoming storm.
[1:24:19] Remember, they didn't have weather
[1:24:21] channels.
[1:24:23] The lens began to smoke.
[1:24:26] Its light began to flicker as the supply
[1:24:31] of oil began to dwindle. Thomas, already
[1:24:35] weary from all of the day's work and the
[1:24:39] preparation for the oncoming storm,
[1:24:42] soaked to the bone, hauled a heavy oil
[1:24:47] canister up the spiral stairs.
[1:24:51] His breath was ragged. His strength was
[1:24:55] fading. And at the top of the stairs, he
[1:25:00] immediately began to trim the darkened
[1:25:04] ends off of the barely lit wick. The
[1:25:11] flame began to leap back to life, its
[1:25:15] beam cutting through the storm once
[1:25:19] again to guide a distant ship to safety.
[1:25:24] Exhausted,
[1:25:26] he began to wipe off the lens of the
[1:25:29] lighthouse tower to make sure that any
[1:25:34] smoke or smut had been removed so that
[1:25:37] nothing would uh impede or impair the
[1:25:43] light from the lighthouse that was now
[1:25:45] desperately needed just off the coast of
[1:25:49] America.
[1:25:50] He made his way, exhausted, back down
[1:25:53] the stairs to find Sarah and Caleb
[1:25:58] waiting, nearly hiding in the edges of
[1:26:02] the bottom of the staircase. Sarah,
[1:26:04] clutching her shawl, whispered, "Papa,
[1:26:09] why do you climb the tower in such a
[1:26:12] storm?
[1:26:13] Didn't you feel it as it moved back and
[1:26:17] forth in the intensity of the wind? Oh
[1:26:22] yes, he said. I could feel it as I have
[1:26:26] felt it many times before.
[1:26:29] Papa, aren't you afraid?
[1:26:33] Why would you nearly risk your life
[1:26:36] night after night in the time uh in the
[1:26:40] in the season of storms?
[1:26:44] Thomas knelt his weathered face soft but
[1:26:49] resolute. And he said to his children
[1:26:52] Sarah and Caleb, "My darlings, this
[1:26:55] light is a ship's only salvation.
[1:27:01] Without its beam, they would all crash
[1:27:04] upon the rocks, their lives to be
[1:27:08] claimed by the merciless deep. But more
[1:27:12] than that, children, I keep this light
[1:27:15] burning to teach you a truth that you
[1:27:18] will carry the rest of your life and
[1:27:22] beyond if you pass it on to your
[1:27:25] children in future times.
[1:27:30] As you grow, as you face trials as
[1:27:34] Christians, one day you're raising your
[1:27:36] own families, you must understand the
[1:27:40] importance of never letting the life,
[1:27:43] the light of your faith go out. Amen.
[1:27:49] In the good weather and in the bad
[1:27:52] weather, it will always be your
[1:27:54] responsibility
[1:27:56] to breathe fresh life into your faith.
[1:28:01] Amen. Trim the wick of your faith
[1:28:06] through prayer and obedience to God's
[1:28:08] word and let your lantern shine for
[1:28:12] Jesus no matter what the storm looks
[1:28:15] like. And then your children after you
[1:28:18] will do the same and they will be able
[1:28:21] to find him even in the midst of their
[1:28:25] own storms.
[1:28:28] Years later,
[1:28:30] Sarah now serving with her husband as
[1:28:34] missionaries in a distant land and
[1:28:37] Caleb, a pastor who also served by
[1:28:40] preaching revivals across the United
[1:28:43] States, returned to the lighthouse.
[1:28:46] its beam still sweeping the sea. A
[1:28:51] testament, a reminder of their father
[1:28:54] Thomas and his unwavering loyalty to his
[1:28:58] commission duty. As they stood by his
[1:29:02] grave, quietly shedding tears,
[1:29:07] they saw that it was marked with a
[1:29:10] carved lighthouse lantern. They wept
[1:29:14] knowing their father's trimmed wick,
[1:29:17] polished lens, and storm divying defying
[1:29:22] faith had lit their path to Christ. A
[1:29:26] legacy that would shine for many
[1:29:29] generations.
[1:29:31] How many of you like that story? I like
[1:29:33] that story. This morning, I want to take
[1:29:37] a little time and if I should choose a
[1:29:39] title, it would be steady in the storm.
[1:29:42] the ministry of a lighthouse. Father, as
[1:29:46] technology has changed, the importance
[1:29:50] of that old lighthouse, it's
[1:29:52] insignificant.
[1:29:54] It's not the way they do it anymore. But
[1:29:56] it used to be something that was a very
[1:29:59] important, maybe like you would call a
[1:30:02] uh an air traffic controller's
[1:30:04] importance today, an old lighthouse
[1:30:06] keeper. He had a great importance in
[1:30:09] those days, early days of our nation.
[1:30:12] How many of you understand that? My
[1:30:15] mother-in-law
[1:30:17] used to tell me that in her childhood
[1:30:21] and in her uh parents' childhood, the
[1:30:26] lighthouse keepers of that part of the
[1:30:28] world made very little money. and they
[1:30:32] were given a place to live in the
[1:30:34] lighthouse as a as a stipen as an
[1:30:37] addition to their meager salary. And she
[1:30:41] said that the fishermen would feel so
[1:30:44] sorry for them because they lived in
[1:30:46] such a meager fair that they would be
[1:30:50] out trying to net fish to go and sell
[1:30:53] the fish and make their own living
[1:30:55] because most people living in that area
[1:30:58] were fishermen at the time. And every
[1:31:00] now and again a lobster
[1:31:03] would get caught up in the net and that
[1:31:06] was considered trash.
[1:31:10] Nobody wanted that thing. And so the the
[1:31:13] boats would pull up to the shore of the
[1:31:15] lighthouse and throw these big old
[1:31:17] lobsters up on the shore for the
[1:31:20] lighthouse keeper and his family. And
[1:31:23] you know that just kind of makes me
[1:31:24] chuckle because now that's the delicacy.
[1:31:29] the the the old lighthouse. He didn't
[1:31:31] have a lot of money. The keeper didn't
[1:31:32] have a lot of money in his pocket, but
[1:31:34] he had fresh lobster quite often during
[1:31:36] the year because somebody brought it to
[1:31:38] him. I wonder if he thought it was just
[1:31:41] trash or if he thought, "My, those
[1:31:43] people don't know what they're missing."
[1:31:45] I don't know because I don't eat them.
[1:31:48] But I I I find that to be quite
[1:31:51] interesting. Did you know I I have come
[1:31:54] to understand that a father is to be a
[1:31:58] lighthouse keeper in his own home? I I
[1:32:02] really really love the analogy in Psalm
[1:32:06] 112
[1:32:08] verse 1 and two. It says, "Praise ye the
[1:32:10] Lord. Blessed is the man that fearth the
[1:32:14] Lord, that delightth greatly in his
[1:32:18] commandments, his seed, that's his
[1:32:21] children, That's those who follow after
[1:32:23] him shall be mighty upon the earth. The
[1:32:27] generation of the upright shall be what?
[1:32:31] They shall be blessed. Verse three,
[1:32:34] wealth and riches shall be in his house,
[1:32:38] and his righteousness endureth forever.
[1:32:42] The testimony of his uprightness will
[1:32:46] pass from generation to generation to
[1:32:49] generation. Amen. Un uh up un unto the
[1:32:53] upright, excuse me, unto the upright
[1:32:56] there ariseth light in the darkness. He
[1:32:59] is gracious and full of compassion and
[1:33:02] righteous. A good man showeth favor and
[1:33:05] lendeth.
[1:33:09] He will guide his affairs
[1:33:13] with discretion.
[1:33:15] He's not depending on somebody else to
[1:33:18] provide.
[1:33:19] But he is doing everything that he can
[1:33:22] do. I have known situations
[1:33:26] one generation ago and some in in my own
[1:33:29] generation
[1:33:30] where where a man has worked multiple
[1:33:33] jobs.
[1:33:34] He wasn't very present at home. There
[1:33:37] was no way that he could be. But he
[1:33:40] worked multiple jobs because of having a
[1:33:43] large family and needing enough supplies
[1:33:46] to feed them all and to take care of
[1:33:48] them all and to put shoes on them all.
[1:33:51] He had to work uh over 14, 15, 16 hours
[1:33:57] a day with a little bit of rest. I'm
[1:33:59] thankful for the hour we're living in
[1:34:01] right now. That's hardly necessary
[1:34:04] anymore. Ain't God good? He's good.
[1:34:08] Amen. He's good. He will guide his
[1:34:11] affairs with discretion. Surely, he
[1:34:14] shall not be moved forever.
[1:34:17] The righteous shall be an everlasting
[1:34:20] remembrance. He shall not be afraid of
[1:34:22] evil tidings. His heart is
[1:34:26] Hallelujah.
[1:34:28] Oh God, give us a fixed heart, trusting
[1:34:32] completely, totally in the Lord. His
[1:34:35] heart is established. He shall not be
[1:34:38] afraid until he see his desire upon his
[1:34:42] enemies. He hath dispersed. He hath
[1:34:46] given to the poor. His righteousness
[1:34:49] endureth forever. His horn shall be
[1:34:52] exalted with honor. His authority shall
[1:34:55] be increased. The wicked shall see it
[1:34:58] and be grieved. He shall nash with his
[1:35:01] teeth and melt away. The desire of the
[1:35:04] wicked shall perish. It is the will of
[1:35:07] God to so bless and to favor the home of
[1:35:12] a righteous man that he would have need
[1:35:15] of nothing.
[1:35:17] I'm telling you that's what the
[1:35:19] scripture says. If a man will walk
[1:35:21] upright before the Lord with discretion
[1:35:24] in all of his affairs, it's the desire
[1:35:28] of the Lord to bless that man with
[1:35:30] favor. Amen. When we sense the favor of
[1:35:34] the Lord withdrawing from our lives, and
[1:35:37] I have on more than one occasion uh
[1:35:40] during my life, when we sense his favor
[1:35:44] withdrawing from us, that's not the time
[1:35:47] to get bitter. That's not the time to
[1:35:49] get cold and indifferent. That's the
[1:35:52] time to go to the altar. In fact, that's
[1:35:54] the time to be chained to the altar,
[1:35:58] grabbing a hold of the horns of the
[1:35:59] altar and saying, "Lord, I won't be
[1:36:02] moved until you show me what it is in my
[1:36:05] life that's caused your favor to
[1:36:07] withdraw." I want you to know the love
[1:36:10] of the Lord will never leave you. But
[1:36:12] the favor and the blessing of the Lord
[1:36:15] will leave you high and dry if you're
[1:36:18] not walking in his ways and his
[1:36:21] commandments. So when one of these young
[1:36:23] fathers says to me, "Pastor, I got a
[1:36:26] dollar a raise." I rejoice with them.
[1:36:30] Somebody said you would rejoice over a
[1:36:32] dollar. I would rejoice over a quarter
[1:36:36] because remember you you multiply that
[1:36:38] quarter times however many hours you
[1:36:40] work. And that was that much more than
[1:36:42] you didn't have. So when I see God, and
[1:36:45] I'm telling you something, if you're
[1:36:46] faithful, if you're faithful with the
[1:36:49] quarter raise,
[1:36:53] if you give God his part first and
[1:36:55] foremost above everything else, then you
[1:36:58] can expect that he's got a better raise,
[1:37:00] a bigger raise, a better opportunity for
[1:37:03] you. The Bible said, "If a if a man's
[1:37:06] ways please the Lord,
[1:37:09] he he's not only to bless and provide,
[1:37:11] able to do that." But he's also able to
[1:37:13] make his own enemies be at peace with
[1:37:15] him. That's the goodness of God. I'm
[1:37:19] thankful for it. Godly fathers in this
[1:37:22] hour are like lighthouse towers, rooted
[1:37:25] in the word. They've already weathered
[1:37:28] their own personal storms. They have
[1:37:31] found themselves a place of being
[1:37:33] steadfast, unmovable in their faith.
[1:37:36] They're not looking for the trends and
[1:37:39] the newer ways, but their roots go down
[1:37:42] deeper. The more the winds blow, the
[1:37:44] more the adversaries come, the deeper
[1:37:46] their roots go down in their faith.
[1:37:49] They're not nearly as emotional
[1:37:53] as they get more mature.
[1:37:56] Is that right? Amen. Their fears are
[1:37:59] fewer and farther between because
[1:38:02] they're learning to put their whole
[1:38:04] trust and their whole hope in the Lord.
[1:38:07] I want you to look at your godly father
[1:38:10] sitting in this house today. If indeed
[1:38:13] he's here and if indeed that's what he
[1:38:15] is to you, I want you to see him as a
[1:38:17] lighthouse. I want you to understand
[1:38:20] that God's given him that kind of a
[1:38:22] ministry that he would always uh uh you
[1:38:25] you might could say if you don't want to
[1:38:28] make him a a a lighthouse, you can make
[1:38:30] him the lighthouse keeper and and you
[1:38:32] can pray for him that God will always
[1:38:35] give him discernment and wisdom to watch
[1:38:37] out after the enemy because the enemy
[1:38:40] will come and he'll try to steal what
[1:38:42] belongs to us. How many of you have ever
[1:38:45] uh had to go before the Lord and say,
[1:38:48] "Wait a minute. Take your hands off of
[1:38:53] my family.
[1:38:55] This is not only a mother's duty. It is
[1:38:58] primarily the duty of a father. You back
[1:39:03] up, you foul spirit. I won't have it
[1:39:06] because somebody else agrees with it. I
[1:39:08] won't have it because somebody else
[1:39:10] accepts it. I'm going to stand on the
[1:39:13] word and believe that God will drive
[1:39:15] back the forces of hell and take the
[1:39:18] devil better take his hands off of my
[1:39:20] children, my family, my grandchildren.
[1:39:24] Come on. I'm telling you, we can do some
[1:39:26] business in the spirit. We want to
[1:39:29] acknowledge this morning every father in
[1:39:31] this house who prays for his children.
[1:39:34] And I don't mean a mambby pami lay me
[1:39:37] down prayer. I mean, the kind that
[1:39:39] rattles the bars of hell and rings the
[1:39:43] bells of heaven. One that says, "I've
[1:39:47] got the faith of a bulldog and I'm going
[1:39:50] to put my jaw down on the promise of God
[1:39:53] and I'm going to believe for my
[1:39:56] children." Should I wait until they're a
[1:39:58] teenager to do that? I don't think so.
[1:40:02] I don't think so.
[1:40:04] I I think sometimes in a f Are you with
[1:40:07] me? I think sometime in a family uh
[1:40:11] community of faith like this, I think
[1:40:13] that people sometimes get a little slack
[1:40:16] and they depend on others a little too
[1:40:19] much to take care of their own.
[1:40:24] I love the ability and the gift that God
[1:40:27] gives certain people to be able to not
[1:40:30] only take care of theirs, but to take
[1:40:32] care of somebody else's. But I don't
[1:40:34] think it should ever be taken for
[1:40:36] granted. Amen.
[1:40:38] I think we should pray for our mamas and
[1:40:41] support them the very best way that we
[1:40:43] can. Do anything that we can to help
[1:40:45] them, but I don't think that we ought to
[1:40:47] take the load off of them because
[1:40:50] they're training they're training for
[1:40:53] reigning and they're training children
[1:40:55] who are going to train to rain. You see,
[1:40:58] and if they don't understand uh what
[1:41:01] it's really like, then it becomes like a
[1:41:04] fairy tale. I think there are fathers
[1:41:07] sometime
[1:41:08] that depend on pastor's prayers or or
[1:41:12] some other spiritual mentors prayers for
[1:41:16] their own children. But I want to tell
[1:41:17] you something, nobody can pray with the
[1:41:20] tenacity and with the faith bulldog
[1:41:23] faith that a man can for his own
[1:41:27] children. And I don't think I would
[1:41:29] wait, as I said a moment ago, I don't
[1:41:31] think I'd wait until they start facing
[1:41:33] teenage problems. I think I would do it.
[1:41:36] Now, I want you to understand that a
[1:41:38] godly mother does not take the place
[1:41:44] of a godly father. They both have their
[1:41:47] own roles and they both need lots of
[1:41:50] prayer.
[1:41:52] I want to acknowledge the sacrifice that
[1:41:54] every hardworking father has made in
[1:41:57] this church today. You you work hard to
[1:42:01] provide to protect to take care of your
[1:42:06] families. And I know that you get weary.
[1:42:10] And I know that you feel sometime
[1:42:13] overlooked and undervalued. But I want
[1:42:16] you to remember, you're not just doing
[1:42:18] it for your children. You're not just
[1:42:20] doing it for your wife. You're actually
[1:42:23] serving the kingdom of God. When you
[1:42:26] serve your family and you raise them in
[1:42:28] the right way and you take good care of
[1:42:31] them spiritually and physically, you're
[1:42:35] not just building a family. You're
[1:42:37] building up the kingdom of God because
[1:42:40] one day your back's going to wear out
[1:42:43] and you're going to get the easier chair
[1:42:45] and your children are going to be the
[1:42:47] ones providing, taking care of their
[1:42:50] their children and the next generation
[1:42:52] and the next generation. Did you know
[1:42:55] that uh not having a good father is not
[1:42:58] an excuse for not being a good father? I
[1:43:01] so appreciated a testimony that Justin
[1:43:04] the Barber posted on Facebook. I I don't
[1:43:07] know why I even saw it because I only
[1:43:09] had just a minute to even glance, but it
[1:43:12] was the first thing that I saw. In fact,
[1:43:14] nearly the only thing. I think I closed
[1:43:16] it down after that. And he testified
[1:43:18] with transparency about his own life.
[1:43:20] And he said, "I didn't have a good dad.
[1:43:22] I didn't have a godly example. I was
[1:43:24] raised by an alcoholic. And he went on
[1:43:27] through his things. And maybe somebody
[1:43:29] reading that would say, "Well, he's just
[1:43:30] really whining." No, he said, "But I
[1:43:33] want you to know, I didn't hear I love
[1:43:35] you every day. I didn't sit on my
[1:43:37] daddy's knee and learn what it feels
[1:43:39] like to be embraced and valued and
[1:43:41] spoken into, but I made up my mind.
[1:43:45] I want Justin to know he's not alone.
[1:43:49] I made up my mind to make sure there
[1:43:51] wouldn't be a day go by that my children
[1:43:53] wouldn't hear out of my own lips. The
[1:43:56] words.
[1:43:58] The words.
[1:44:00] You see what I've learned about a love
[1:44:02] language is uh you you you have a love
[1:44:05] language. There is a particular way that
[1:44:08] you uh receive love
[1:44:12] and there is a particular way a
[1:44:15] particular demonstration
[1:44:17] that says to your wife you're loved and
[1:44:21] it's not always the same. Did you know
[1:44:24] there are some women, let's talk about
[1:44:26] women too. There are some women that uh
[1:44:30] h a single rose
[1:44:33] from the gas station,
[1:44:37] not the flower cart,
[1:44:40] the gas station. Course, you know,
[1:44:42] sometimes they have them up there at the
[1:44:44] at the counter, you know, just a bucket
[1:44:46] of water with some roses in them. There
[1:44:49] are certain women that that rose
[1:44:52] from the gas station, not a dozen, not
[1:44:55] two dozen, not three dozen, but one
[1:44:58] little simple gift of love and
[1:45:00] thoughtfulness
[1:45:02] sends her to the moon.
[1:45:05] Oh, she's googly eyed over you again.
[1:45:08] She felt valued. She felt appreciated.
[1:45:11] See, and and there are some men who say,
[1:45:14] "I work hard and I I wear myself out and
[1:45:17] I provide the soup and the crackers for
[1:45:20] everybody in the house and I I give them
[1:45:23] a place to live and and so forth and
[1:45:26] etc." And and I I want my family to know
[1:45:30] I love them, right? And that's the way I
[1:45:34] show them that I love them. But here's
[1:45:36] what I've learned about love.
[1:45:39] Just because you choose a certain way to
[1:45:41] give it
[1:45:43] doesn't mean that it gets received in
[1:45:45] that way.
[1:45:47] That's why I take these young couples
[1:45:49] and I say we've got to discover right
[1:45:51] away how it is that you acknowledge and
[1:45:55] receive love and you you boy
[1:45:59] because that's what they are by the time
[1:46:00] they're in my office. They're still boys
[1:46:03] usually. I have had the exceptions,
[1:46:07] but they're still pretty young. And uh
[1:46:11] you you you've got to discover uh you
[1:46:13] know uh sometimes for some it's a little
[1:46:16] affection.
[1:46:18] Even men uh a touch on the arm.
[1:46:23] Let's just see how quiet it gets.
[1:46:26] You know, it's not always the bedroom.
[1:46:29] I'm gonna have to have water if I go
[1:46:31] there.
[1:46:40] Just let me take my time.
[1:46:43] Sometimes
[1:46:46] it's just a a pat.
[1:46:51] You not in public.
[1:46:55] Nobody wants to see your pat and your
[1:46:57] wife on the bottom in public.
[1:47:01] That is rude.
[1:47:03] That's not good Christian behavior.
[1:47:06] Amen.
[1:47:08] Uh you're not making out in public. But
[1:47:12] a br just brush by grab her arm or or or
[1:47:17] hold his hand or her hand or his hand or
[1:47:21] or or stop what you're doing and look
[1:47:24] him in the eyeball
[1:47:26] instead of always saying I love you on
[1:47:28] the way out the door. Take a minute,
[1:47:30] like we do when we're in a hurry, which
[1:47:32] is every day of our lives. Take a minute
[1:47:35] and look at them in the eyeball and say,
[1:47:37] "I love you, and I want you to know that
[1:47:39] I love you." And we may not always
[1:47:41] agree,
[1:47:43] but I love you. Did you know always
[1:47:46] agreeing about something is not a
[1:47:48] prerequisite for love? If it is, nobody
[1:47:51] would be getting any love.
[1:47:54] There going to be things that you see
[1:47:56] and view different and handle different.
[1:47:58] But if if a husband can discover his
[1:48:01] wife's love language and vice versa, if
[1:48:04] a father can discover what says I love
[1:48:07] you to their children and and do it and
[1:48:11] say it, you are not only sewing into
[1:48:15] their life, but you are preparing them
[1:48:18] to be a better parent. Amen. Amen. I I
[1:48:22] think those of us who didn't have it
[1:48:24] understand more the importance of making
[1:48:28] sure that we don't pass that dysfunction
[1:48:31] along to our children.
[1:48:35] If you're a warrior, if you're acting
[1:48:38] like a man, you definitely don't want
[1:48:41] your sons to grow up feeling like you
[1:48:44] felt.
[1:48:47] You definitely don't want your daughters
[1:48:49] growing up
[1:48:51] in a way like you felt you want to end
[1:48:54] that. I I believe that every one of us
[1:48:57] have the power. We have the authority by
[1:49:00] redemption to end the vicious cycle.
[1:49:05] Somebody said, "But I didn't know all
[1:49:07] that when my children were little."
[1:49:08] Don't you fret yourself. You can
[1:49:11] accomplish so much on your knees.
[1:49:15] You just go to papa and say, "I failed
[1:49:17] miserably in so many ways, but I know
[1:49:20] you are a redeemer and I know you know
[1:49:24] how to prepare." Well, I'm not a father,
[1:49:27] so this message is doesn't really do
[1:49:29] much for me. I'm not even married, so
[1:49:31] this message doesn't do very much for
[1:49:33] me. It can.
[1:49:35] It can.
[1:49:37] In fact, it may be why some aren't
[1:49:39] married.
[1:49:42] It can.
[1:49:44] Because if there's one thing you've got
[1:49:45] to see crucified,
[1:49:49] it's selfishness.
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:53] That's got to die right up front. Every
[1:49:56] every morning about six o'clock, you
[1:49:58] better kill that thing because it's not
[1:50:01] this 50/50 stuff, is it? It's 100.
[1:50:06] And uh listen folks, the atmosphere.
[1:50:08] Thank God. Thank God for the fathers in
[1:50:12] this house that choose worship music o
[1:50:16] over a country uh oh cheating song.
[1:50:21] You men that play a godly song of
[1:50:24] worship to the Lord in your home and you
[1:50:28] choose that on the radio in your
[1:50:30] automobile. God bless you and strengthen
[1:50:32] you and keep you and don't fall into
[1:50:35] that vicious cycle of who's cheating who
[1:50:38] and who's being true and whose car is
[1:50:41] parked next door. That don't help
[1:50:43] anybody
[1:50:44] build an atmosphere at home and in the
[1:50:47] car and wherever you go.
[1:50:51] And some of you that's who you are.
[1:50:55] That's what you do. I know it is because
[1:50:58] some of you send some of those songs to
[1:51:00] me and I know you couldn't send them to
[1:51:02] me if you weren't listening to them.
[1:51:04] Just make sure you're filling your home.
[1:51:06] I don't care if it's a palace or a
[1:51:08] mobile home. You fill it full of an
[1:51:11] atmosphere both mom and dad that will
[1:51:16] that will entertain invite and entertain
[1:51:20] the presence of the Lord. Amen. If
[1:51:23] you're not a lover,
[1:51:26] if you're not a hugger, if you're not an
[1:51:28] embracer, I don't want you to be
[1:51:30] condemned,
[1:51:32] but I don't want you to accept that as
[1:51:34] your sentence either. I want you to know
[1:51:38] you can change that today. I'm not
[1:51:41] comfortable with that because I didn't
[1:51:43] get it. Did anybody ask you
[1:51:46] what you were comfortable with?
[1:51:48] This is not woke society over here. We
[1:51:52] don't do it because it makes us
[1:51:53] comfortable. We do it because our
[1:51:55] children need it.
[1:51:59] Yes, sir. God bless.
[1:52:03] God bless
[1:52:05] these daddies.
[1:52:10] Every daddy that takes his little girls
[1:52:12] out on a boat. Lord have mercy.
[1:52:17] You can't fish with squawking girls.
[1:52:21] like Nora and Millie.
[1:52:25] But God bless every daddy who just gives
[1:52:27] up the idea of catching anything and
[1:52:31] goes anyway
[1:52:34] because that's all they talk about for a
[1:52:36] week or two or three or four.
[1:52:39] I went fishing with daddy. I went
[1:52:40] fishing with daddy. Went fishing with
[1:52:41] daddy. Went fishing with daddy. They
[1:52:43] don't ever get around unless you ask
[1:52:44] them to of telling you what they caught.
[1:52:47] But it just means so much,
[1:52:49] folks. Uh, God bless you men who go and
[1:52:54] sit at those hot,
[1:52:57] stinking, sweaty playgrounds.
[1:53:03] You deserve a medal.
[1:53:06] A man that'll go sit on a bench and
[1:53:08] watch his children slide. In the world
[1:53:11] we live in today and in the humidity of
[1:53:13] the South, you deserve some celebration
[1:53:17] here today. It matters.
[1:53:21] It means something. Did you know that
[1:53:24] our spiritual words and our spiritual
[1:53:27] instruction will be more valuable to our
[1:53:30] children if we're providing for them
[1:53:33] emotionally first?
[1:53:35] Then they trust us.
[1:53:38] Did you know even the littlest child
[1:53:40] comes into this world
[1:53:43] a little skeptical? It seems these days
[1:53:47] there is a fallen Adamic nature that has
[1:53:51] to be broken and redeemed by the blood
[1:53:54] of the lamb.
[1:53:56] And children, as the scripture said,
[1:53:58] come into the world speaking lies.
[1:54:01] No one ever teaches them to lie. Isn't
[1:54:04] that interesting? No one ever has to
[1:54:06] teach them how or explain to them how.
[1:54:09] They'll stand there with the cookie
[1:54:10] crumbs all down their clothes and shake
[1:54:13] their head no. And when they can talk,
[1:54:15] they'll tell you, "I didn't take a
[1:54:17] cookie out of the jar." And who taught
[1:54:19] them to do such a thing? It's that
[1:54:21] fallen nature. And it's up to you and I
[1:54:24] to cause them to feel safe. Did you know
[1:54:27] I think one of the most valuable things
[1:54:29] a father can provide, a godly father can
[1:54:32] provide, is a safe environment.
[1:54:37] I want to tell you folks, I love home.
[1:54:41] My home is so so old
[1:54:44] and so small and there's so many things
[1:54:48] wrong with it, but it's home.
[1:54:52] It's home. And I like to be home. And
[1:54:55] you start understanding as you get older
[1:54:57] the value of home and how important it
[1:55:00] is to have an environment in your home
[1:55:03] where everybody can feel safe, loved,
[1:55:06] valued, seen. That's not woke. That's
[1:55:09] Bible.
[1:55:11] You're a lighthouse keeper.
[1:55:14] Thank God for you who take it serious.
[1:55:17] And this church is full of those men.
[1:55:19] Thank you, Lord, for that. Amen. This
[1:55:21] lighthouse of Thomas had endured many
[1:55:24] decades of storms because he took his
[1:55:27] responsibilities and duties most
[1:55:29] seriously.
[1:55:31] He maintained that old tower, repairing
[1:55:35] cracks and painting walls and
[1:55:37] reinforcing the base.
[1:55:40] Lot of the duties of a lighthouse keeper
[1:55:42] are far from glamorous or even exciting.
[1:55:46] But every task was vital, and many lives
[1:55:49] were depending on his faithful duty and
[1:55:52] loyal service. Thomas trimmed his wick
[1:55:56] daily, nightly as he would begin to
[1:56:00] light the lamp, cutting away the charred
[1:56:03] ends so that the light would burn
[1:56:05] bright. He meticulously wiped and
[1:56:07] polished the lens of the glass of the
[1:56:10] old lighthouse night after night after
[1:56:12] night so that that beacon would appear
[1:56:15] bright and clear. His daily duties
[1:56:18] unglamorous but vital. There were no
[1:56:21] vacations. And I need to tell you there
[1:56:23] are no vacations from being a father.
[1:56:28] There are no holidays from being a
[1:56:30] parent or from being a spouse.
[1:56:34] It's 24 hours a day. 365 days a week uh
[1:56:39] a year.
[1:56:41] I may not be good at math, but I know
[1:56:43] what I'm talking about.
[1:56:48] Fathers today, like like Thomas, his old
[1:56:52] callous hands,
[1:56:54] he didn't understand a whole lot about
[1:56:56] what was going on out there in the world
[1:56:57] because his whole world consisted of one
[1:57:00] little point and one little lighthouse.
[1:57:03] He lived there and he would die there
[1:57:07] and he would be buried there. It was his
[1:57:10] whole world and so he couldn't maybe
[1:57:13] teach his children things that were
[1:57:15] going on across the ocean.
[1:57:17] I doubt he was perfect. If I understand
[1:57:21] very much about him, he was sometimes
[1:57:24] tired and weary and his temper would get
[1:57:26] a little short up here.
[1:57:31] He'd raise his voice sometime.
[1:57:35] He was not a perfect man,
[1:57:38] but he was a dedicated man.
[1:57:41] Let me tell you something. Dads aren't
[1:57:43] going to be perfect. I don't know any I
[1:57:47] don't know any I don't know any perfect
[1:57:48] children. So, that's good.
[1:57:51] They're not going to be perfect. They're
[1:57:53] not always going to get it right. But if
[1:57:55] they are there for you,
[1:57:58] that's something to celebrate.
[1:58:01] If they won't compromise with your sin,
[1:58:06] that's something to celebrate. If
[1:58:08] they'll tell you the truth instead of
[1:58:10] what you want to hear, that's something
[1:58:13] to celebrate. We've got some dads like
[1:58:15] that around here. To be the father that
[1:58:18] you're called to be, you've got to learn
[1:58:20] to relate first and foremost to your
[1:58:23] heavenly father. And this is where
[1:58:25] things break down.
[1:58:29] In order to be a good father,
[1:58:32] you've got to know you have one.
[1:58:35] And you've got to understand that he's
[1:58:37] not out to destroy you.
[1:58:40] He's out to build you up here.
[1:58:44] He's out to build you. To make you
[1:58:47] somebody. To make you something. To give
[1:58:49] you strength to be everything that he
[1:58:51] has created and called you to be. Amen.
[1:58:54] A man who doesn't have a good
[1:58:56] relationship with his heavenly father
[1:58:58] will struggle in everyday fatherhood.
[1:59:03] The more you fall in love with your
[1:59:05] heavenly father. The more you learn to
[1:59:08] relate with your heavenly father and
[1:59:10] hear the heart of your heavenly father,
[1:59:13] the better father you'll be to your
[1:59:14] children. It's just a fact. God help us.
[1:59:19] Isaiah 64:8 said, "But now, oh Lord,
[1:59:23] thou art our father. We are the clay,
[1:59:27] and thou our potter, and we all are the
[1:59:31] work of thy hand."
[1:59:34] If you can discover that he's not the
[1:59:37] white-wiged one we talked about
[1:59:38] recently, who would would love to see
[1:59:41] you so utterly crushed that you couldn't
[1:59:44] uh even hold up your head. That's not
[1:59:46] who he is. His anger is toward
[1:59:49] unrighteousness, but his great love is
[1:59:52] toward his bride.
[1:59:54] The fear of the Lord that we have must
[1:59:57] have the beginning of all wisdom is
[1:59:59] reverential fear. It's not fear of
[2:00:02] destruction. It's fear of wounding his
[2:00:05] heart.
[2:00:12] It's so easy to break the spirit
[2:00:16] of your children
[2:00:20] and it's hard to heal.
[2:00:23] It's hard to heal it.
[2:00:26] A child that grows up believing they're
[2:00:28] the problem in the home
[2:00:30] and they're the reason for the confusion
[2:00:34] will never be able to value themselves
[2:00:37] unless God rescues them somewhere out
[2:00:39] there in life. They'll never see who
[2:00:42] they can be or who they could be because
[2:00:45] they live every day under the pressure
[2:00:47] of feeling like I'm the blame. I'm the
[2:00:49] cause. I'm the reason.
[2:00:53] That is a thousand times complicated in
[2:00:55] the home of a narcissist.
[2:01:02] We have too many out there, too many
[2:01:06] fathers who have become narcissist
[2:01:09] who believe that it's their
[2:01:11] responsibility to break everybody's
[2:01:14] spirit and that's how you get real
[2:01:16] submission. I want you to understand
[2:01:19] that nothing could be more unbiblical
[2:01:22] than that. Breaking the spirit. Now,
[2:01:25] dealing with the will is an entirely
[2:01:27] different thing. And there's a way to
[2:01:29] discipline and deal with the will
[2:01:31] without breaking the spirit.
[2:01:37] Telling a little child, you're you know,
[2:01:39] you're you're you're just you never
[2:01:41] listen.
[2:01:44] You never listen.
[2:01:48] Guess what that does?
[2:01:52] It sets up a child to never listen.
[2:01:57] Did you know you can say the same thing,
[2:01:59] just choose words a little differently?
[2:02:00] Now, you're not listening to daddy,
[2:02:03] but I know I know that you've got ears
[2:02:06] to hear, and I know that you can. Did
[2:02:09] you know there's a way to do what needs
[2:02:10] to be done and speak words of life
[2:02:13] instead of words of destruction?
[2:02:15] And and I want to tell you where we miss
[2:02:17] it. So many time as parents, we look at
[2:02:19] somebody else's children and the way
[2:02:21] they handle their children and we think
[2:02:22] that's the ideal way. You know what a
[2:02:25] real mom and dad will do in this hour?
[2:02:26] They'll discover who their children are.
[2:02:29] Cuz I'm telling you, they don't all come
[2:02:30] like cookie cutter uh all learn the same
[2:02:33] and like the same and do the same. But a
[2:02:36] parent who will take the time to
[2:02:38] discover who their child is and deal
[2:02:40] with them accordingly.
[2:02:42] It's not just creating more peace in the
[2:02:45] home, but they're building fathers for
[2:02:49] the future and mothers for the future.
[2:02:53] That's right.
[2:02:58] I'm trying to give you a little bragging
[2:03:00] here.
[2:03:01] If all you hear is the negative, you'll
[2:03:04] miss the fact that you are highly valued
[2:03:08] in this wicked society. You are a rare
[2:03:12] jewel. A man who cares. I mean really
[2:03:16] cares about his family more than he
[2:03:18] cares about his control is a rare rare
[2:03:22] jewel.
[2:03:24] My God, thank you for men like that.
[2:03:27] Help us to see more men raised up like
[2:03:31] that. Not perfect men, but men
[2:03:34] surrendered to a perfect God.
[2:03:37] I want to honor all fathers today.
[2:03:39] biological fathers, adoptive fathers,
[2:03:42] stepfathers, grandfathers,
[2:03:45] mentors, which are spiritual fathers.
[2:03:52] Children are like magnets
[2:03:55] to love.
[2:03:58] They don't have to be yours,
[2:04:01] to know when they're loved.
[2:04:03] If you want a collection of them, all
[2:04:06] you got to do is love.
[2:04:09] just a little bit of love, little bit of
[2:04:11] attention, little bit of affection, and
[2:04:13] you'll you'll gather more than you can
[2:04:15] handle.
[2:04:16] And you'll have to say to them, you're
[2:04:18] going to, like I said to one beautiful,
[2:04:20] beautiful girl recently, if you come
[2:04:23] running at me like that again, make sure
[2:04:25] I can stand up strong before you do or
[2:04:27] I'm going to fall on you. And when I
[2:04:29] fall on you, you're going to be broken.
[2:04:30] I mean crushed.
[2:04:41] There are single dads. This world is
[2:04:44] it's not not as rare as you think
[2:04:46] anymore.
[2:04:50] A dad wakes up to a note that says, "I'm
[2:04:54] gone.
[2:04:57] The children are yours.
[2:04:59] They're your responsibilities."
[2:05:02] I read this week about one such single
[2:05:04] dad. His name was Mark.
[2:05:08] He made up his mind. He He thought,
[2:05:10] "I'll never do it. I cannot do it. I
[2:05:12] don't know how I will do it by myself."
[2:05:15] But he made up his mind. I'll have to
[2:05:17] make the best of it. I have no choice.
[2:05:19] It's my responsibility.
[2:05:22] Not only was he a provider and a a
[2:05:26] homekeeper,
[2:05:28] but he ended up having to be a lunch
[2:05:30] packer.
[2:05:33] And so he had to pack lunch for both of
[2:05:35] his daughters every morning.
[2:05:38] And he made up his mind, I'm going to
[2:05:39] put more than a sandwich in.
[2:05:42] I'm going to take the time to put in a
[2:05:45] verse of scripture.
[2:05:48] The first one he wrote, "The Lord is my
[2:05:51] shepherd.
[2:05:53] I shall not want." Psalm 23:1
[2:05:57] in the amplified it says, "The Lord is
[2:05:59] my shepherd to feed, guide, and shield
[2:06:03] me. I shall not lack."
[2:06:10] The children, the little girls get to
[2:06:12] school and they open up their lunch and
[2:06:14] they find their sandwich and their
[2:06:16] Cheetos,
[2:06:18] maybe a apple or some other kind of
[2:06:21] fruit.
[2:06:23] And at the bottom they find the little
[2:06:25] note
[2:06:28] with a scripture verse and a signature
[2:06:31] that says love dad.
[2:06:36] It means so much to them in the
[2:06:38] beginning but they don't want anybody
[2:06:40] else to see it. So they tuck it down in
[2:06:44] their lunchbox before anybody gets to
[2:06:46] see it. But it's not long before they
[2:06:49] begin to appreciate that so much. The
[2:06:53] consistency of a dad who not only
[2:06:55] provides a a bed
[2:06:58] and food
[2:07:00] and who tries to fix their hair, can you
[2:07:03] imagine?
[2:07:06] But who also takes the time to speak a
[2:07:09] word of life into them.
[2:07:12] Years later at his retirement party,
[2:07:17] his daughters stood up and began to
[2:07:19] share how those shaky handwritten notes
[2:07:23] meant so much to them through their
[2:07:25] life. It was in fact like a light that
[2:07:29] lit a path for them to walk through in
[2:07:32] their teenage years.
[2:07:34] The time that he took meant more to them
[2:07:40] than they had words to express.
[2:07:43] It was not forgotten.
[2:07:45] Deuteronomy chapter 6:es
[2:07:49] 6 and 7 says, "And these words which I
[2:07:52] command thee this day shall be in thine
[2:07:54] heart, and thou shalt teach them
[2:07:58] diligently." Diligently, thank you,
[2:08:00] David, unto thy children, and shall talk
[2:08:03] of them. Listen, folks,
[2:08:07] and shall talk of them,
[2:08:10] when thou sitest in thine house,
[2:08:13] and when thou walst by the way, and when
[2:08:17] thou liest down, and when thou rise up.
[2:08:20] What do you think the message is
[2:08:23] all the time?
[2:08:26] If you will teach diligently your
[2:08:29] children and talk of the goodness of God
[2:08:32] all the time, sitting down, rising up,
[2:08:36] walking by the way, laying down,
[2:08:42] you will never regret it.
[2:08:45] How many of you can say amen?
[2:08:48] You'll never regret it. In fact, if you
[2:08:50] get on the other side and realize how
[2:08:53] many opportunities you missed, that's
[2:08:55] when the regrets come. Believe me, I
[2:08:57] know fathers are called to diligently
[2:09:01] teach God's word in everyday moments. It
[2:09:04] doesn't always have to be about a Bible
[2:09:07] study.
[2:09:09] It doesn't always have to be about a
[2:09:11] devotion,
[2:09:14] which I somehow
[2:09:16] nearly despise.
[2:09:21] I know I'm going to get
[2:09:24] stones, imaginary stones thrown at me.
[2:09:29] But I believe if you take this scripture
[2:09:31] in context, you will understand that any
[2:09:34] moment you seize
[2:09:38] can be a devotion.
[2:09:40] Any moment that you seize can be a
[2:09:43] lesson. And lessons can be fun.
[2:09:47] And lessons don't have to be full of
[2:09:49] threats. If you don't quit wiggling, I'm
[2:09:52] going to whip you with a belt. Now,
[2:09:54] let's talk about the love of the Lord.
[2:09:59] I told you, sit down. Shut up. Now, I
[2:10:03] want to talk to you from the scripture
[2:10:05] about kindness.
[2:10:09] Do you understand the confusion?
[2:10:12] I believe I want to tell you something
[2:10:13] about spanking. I believe in it, but I
[2:10:16] don't believe it should ever be used
[2:10:18] without an explanation.
[2:10:20] And if a child isn't old enough to
[2:10:22] understand the explanation,
[2:10:30] they only learn one thing.
[2:10:32] That hitting is the way to communicate.
[2:10:37] Let me have some water. That's not what
[2:10:40] you want to teach them.
[2:10:45] We don't ever want to discipline them in
[2:10:46] anger
[2:10:48] or out of frustration. You never did,
[2:10:50] pastor. Oh, I did.
[2:10:53] I did.
[2:10:55] And I deeply regret it.
[2:10:58] I deeply regret every time that I didn't
[2:11:00] calm myself before I tried to teach an
[2:11:03] important lesson. You see, discipline is
[2:11:06] not just about correcting behavior. It's
[2:11:09] about building them for a life. That's
[2:11:12] right. It's the kingdom we're building.
[2:11:16] Anybody with me?
[2:11:18] You don't have to be an earthly father
[2:11:20] to somebody either. You can just be a
[2:11:23] spiritual voice in their life. If you
[2:11:26] take the time to build relationship with
[2:11:28] them, they've got to feel trust, your
[2:11:30] trust in them. They've got to learn to
[2:11:33] trust you.
[2:11:35] Fathers have to teach God's word
[2:11:38] diligently, not their theories.
[2:11:41] Your theory is not going to help your
[2:11:44] child face life. Your conspiracies,
[2:11:52] your your ideas of reincarnation or
[2:11:55] whatever is your last fad.
[2:11:58] That's not going to build your children.
[2:12:01] That's not going to prepare them to face
[2:12:04] the trials of life and run to Jesus
[2:12:07] instead of running away from him. The
[2:12:09] simplicity of the gospel.
[2:12:12] The simplicity of the gospel is what's
[2:12:16] going to build a foundation for them
[2:12:18] that they'll keep building on the rest
[2:12:20] of their life. Thank you for it,
[2:12:21] brothers. Thank you for it. Thank you
[2:12:24] for it. It's not your responsibility or
[2:12:27] mine to teach our small children the
[2:12:29] mysteries of the universe or the
[2:12:32] philosophies of the sages,
[2:12:34] but it is our responsibility above all
[2:12:36] others to teach them the simple gospel
[2:12:39] and the faithfulness of God.
[2:12:44] Somebody said, "And make sure you give
[2:12:45] them a brother Brandham coloring book."
[2:12:48] Well, you can do that if you like,
[2:12:51] but please understand that is not the
[2:12:54] foundation of their faith. That's not
[2:12:56] what they're going to build on. Uh that
[2:12:58] will keep them unshakable and unmovable.
[2:13:02] You tell them later, they're they're not
[2:13:04] understanding and grasping the church
[2:13:06] ages at six,
[2:13:09] but they can understand Jesus loves me.
[2:13:12] This I know.
[2:13:14] Oh, I know some of you can't sing. Sing
[2:13:16] anyway. Kids don't know the difference.
[2:13:19] Sing to them. Thank you, papa. Thank
[2:13:22] you, daddy. Thank you, brother, for
[2:13:24] singing to your children and to somebody
[2:13:26] else's children.
[2:13:28] I can thank uh Paul,
[2:13:31] because he's the one while I was away in
[2:13:34] Taiwan, he's the one who pushed Benjamin
[2:13:38] into leading worship the first time he
[2:13:39] ever did. Not me. I was scared to death.
[2:13:43] I was afraid he would freeze. I was
[2:13:46] afraid he would get the wrong key and
[2:13:48] try to sing a whole song in the wrong
[2:13:49] key. But Paul said, "He can do it,
[2:13:52] brother Shelley. He can do it. I go away
[2:13:55] to Taiwan so that I can't say no."
[2:13:59] And the next thing I know, it's done.
[2:14:01] You know, I can't help but appreciate
[2:14:04] Paul for that because he spoke
[2:14:06] confidence. I had the fear of a father.
[2:14:10] He spoke confidence. He's not a father,
[2:14:12] but he spoke with the confidence of a
[2:14:14] father. You can do it. You can do it.
[2:14:17] You see what a what a role you can play
[2:14:19] in somebody else's children's life,
[2:14:21] somebody else's young kids' life. Amen.
[2:14:25] Thomas, the lightkeeper,
[2:14:28] he didn't just light the lantern. He
[2:14:31] also taught Sarah and Caleb how to light
[2:14:33] the lantern. He explained its mechanics
[2:14:36] and purposes during the quiet evening.
[2:14:38] He taught them how to trim a wick, how
[2:14:41] to clean the lens, explaining how that
[2:14:44] each task is small and seems
[2:14:47] insignificant, but all of those tasks
[2:14:50] together
[2:14:52] without missing any of them. That's what
[2:14:55] saves the ship. That's what saves lives.
[2:14:58] He used practical lessons as spiritual
[2:15:02] metaphors to ignite their faith even as
[2:15:05] very small children. And those lessons
[2:15:08] shaped their character and taught them
[2:15:10] about a greater light that shines to
[2:15:13] every son and daughter of God in the
[2:15:16] midst of their stormy life. In the book
[2:15:18] of Timothy
[2:15:20] chapter 1 verse 5, Paul speaks to
[2:15:23] Timothy and says,"When I call to
[2:15:26] remembrance the unfeigned faith that is
[2:15:28] in thee, which dwelt first in thy
[2:15:31] grandmother Lois and thy mother Ununice,
[2:15:33] and I am persuaded that it is in thee
[2:15:36] also." Well, that's women's influence.
[2:15:39] That's the faith of a mother and the
[2:15:41] faith of a grandmother. But imagine
[2:15:43] this, a father figure in his life.
[2:15:45] Perhaps someone in the synagogue, an
[2:15:48] elder in the church, a brother, or even
[2:15:50] Paul, the apostle himself, who took
[2:15:54] Timothy under his wing, teaching him to
[2:15:57] pray the Psalms and to trust in the
[2:16:00] promises of God. Look at it with me.
[2:16:02] Second Timothy 2, the first four verses.
[2:16:05] Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the
[2:16:09] grace that is in Christ Jesus, and the
[2:16:12] things that thou has heard of me among
[2:16:15] many witnesses, the same commit thou to
[2:16:18] faithful men, who shall be able to teach
[2:16:21] others. What's that word?
[2:16:25] Thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[2:16:28] soldier of Jesus Christ. I don't know
[2:16:30] where Timothy's father was. He's never
[2:16:34] mentioned here. only his mother and his
[2:16:36] grandmother and only the influence of
[2:16:39] the Apostle Paul who saw something in
[2:16:41] him that he didn't see in himself.
[2:16:45] He said you you commit these things to
[2:16:48] your own heart and then pass them on to
[2:16:51] somebody else. Endure hardness as a good
[2:16:54] soldier in Jesus. No man that warth
[2:16:57] entangleth himself with the affairs of
[2:16:59] this life, that he may please him who
[2:17:02] hath chosen him to be a soldier.
[2:17:06] Every little boy, every little girl
[2:17:08] desires to please their earthly father
[2:17:12] and their earthly mother. You and I must
[2:17:14] set an example before them of wanting to
[2:17:17] please our heavenly father.
[2:17:20] Paul's charge to Timothy shows a
[2:17:23] fatherly role in passing the torch.
[2:17:26] Timothy's ministry would then spread the
[2:17:29] gospel across the entirety of Asia
[2:17:32] Minor. Paul hitting a few stops along
[2:17:35] the way. Timothy and his ministry
[2:17:39] saturated the rest of Asia Minor even
[2:17:42] after Paul was off the scene.
[2:17:45] This is the legacy
[2:17:48] of someone who didn't have perhaps an
[2:17:51] earthly son but chose a young man that
[2:17:56] he had confidence in to pour into. I
[2:18:00] want to thank you brothers
[2:18:02] for doing that. I want to thank you all
[2:18:05] for taking a a a young boy, a a growing
[2:18:09] young man who has no dad to hunting or
[2:18:12] or camping as you all have done, hiking,
[2:18:15] even if they give out halfway up the
[2:18:17] hill, take them anyway. Let them
[2:18:20] experience those things and the fact
[2:18:22] that you would take time for them. That
[2:18:24] reminds me of the importance of pouring
[2:18:28] in.
[2:18:30] There's so many even in this small
[2:18:32] church who don't know and did not know
[2:18:36] the positive influence of a godly
[2:18:39] father. It's up to you and I to help
[2:18:42] fill in that gap, to fill in that void.
[2:18:46] If you believe that, say amen.
[2:18:50] It would be a a good piece of advice to
[2:18:52] pass along to you because uh when I
[2:18:55] think about the wick of the of the
[2:18:57] lighthouse, I think about how that hard
[2:19:01] black edge forms on the top of that
[2:19:05] wick. And anyone who's ever lit a lamp,
[2:19:08] a kerosene lamp or a coal lamp, coal oil
[2:19:11] lamp, you understand that that hard
[2:19:13] part. Sometimes you can just kind of
[2:19:15] burn that off. But other times it just
[2:19:18] seems to increase and grow until it
[2:19:20] almost chokes out the flame. We're
[2:19:22] talking about a huge flame on a
[2:19:25] lighthouse lantern. And the importance
[2:19:28] of trimming that wick and never letting
[2:19:30] a day go by that it wasn't trimmed in
[2:19:33] time. Trimmed in time so that at the
[2:19:36] beginning of the of the dusk, the the
[2:19:40] wick could be lit without having to do
[2:19:42] it. Then it's kind of a lesson that I
[2:19:45] need to learn. Maybe we shouldn't put
[2:19:47] off for later.
[2:19:50] What needs to be done right now?
[2:19:53] Because there there is a time frame. We
[2:19:55] don't always know what the time frame
[2:19:57] is, but the scripture said we should
[2:19:59] work while it's day for night cometh.
[2:20:03] No man knows that day or the hour, but
[2:20:06] when that night comes, no man will be
[2:20:08] able to work. So, we are teaching our
[2:20:12] families the importance of keeping
[2:20:15] everything trimmed
[2:20:17] carefully watched over and making sure
[2:20:21] the soot gets off the lens.
[2:20:25] That's that that's that glass
[2:20:28] that goes around the top of the
[2:20:30] lighthouse. It gets smoky in there
[2:20:32] sometime if the wick isn't trimmed
[2:20:34] properly or if the oil supply gets low.
[2:20:38] And it's not fun. I wouldn't imagine it
[2:20:40] would be fun cleaning that glass. But
[2:20:43] somewhere out there was a was a captain
[2:20:47] in in a storm in a battle for his life
[2:20:50] who appreciated the faithfulness. No
[2:20:52] wonder he threw a lobster up on the
[2:20:54] shore. He appreciated the faithfulness
[2:20:57] of somebody
[2:20:59] under underpaid and hardly appreciated
[2:21:01] but
[2:21:03] vitally vitally important.
[2:21:06] In the message, the world is falling
[2:21:08] apart. I'm I'm nearly done this morning.
[2:21:12] The world is falling apart. Brother
[2:21:14] Brandham said in paragraph 179, those
[2:21:17] who were predestinated to eternal life,
[2:21:20] they got it. No man can come to me, said
[2:21:23] Jesus, except my father draws him and
[2:21:26] all the father hath given me will come.
[2:21:29] Ain't that right? But listen,
[2:21:33] that doesn't negate our cooperation with
[2:21:38] God's plan. He goes on to say, "We just
[2:21:41] got to
[2:21:45] even though somebody is predestinated
[2:21:49] and if they're not fornown,
[2:21:52] they cannot come. It's our
[2:21:55] responsibility not to know who is and
[2:21:57] who is not. It's our responsibility to
[2:22:00] scatter the seed and to do what?" Throw
[2:22:04] the light. Oh, each one of you, brother
[2:22:07] Brandham said, each one of you ought to
[2:22:09] be a lighthouse. Every father, every
[2:22:12] mother, every child of God, scattering
[2:22:15] the seed
[2:22:17] and shining the light. God, give us
[2:22:20] grace and strength to do that. 1 Timothy
[2:22:26] 6 verse 11 and 12. But thou, oh man of
[2:22:30] God, flee these things and follow after
[2:22:35] righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
[2:22:38] patience, meekness.
[2:22:42] Fight the good fight of faith.
[2:22:45] This is Paul's instruction to his
[2:22:48] spiritual son. Fight the good fight of
[2:22:51] faith. lay hold on eternal life where
[2:22:54] unto thou art also called and hast
[2:22:56] professed a good profession before many
[2:22:59] witnesses.
[2:23:01] These verses make up what's called the
[2:23:04] pastoral epistles. They're written from
[2:23:07] Paul to Timothy to emphasize the
[2:23:10] necessity of spiritual leadership. But I
[2:23:12] want you to know that spiritual
[2:23:14] leadership doesn't only come from a
[2:23:16] pullpit.
[2:23:18] It can come from daddy's chair.
[2:23:21] It can come from mama's chair. Did you
[2:23:24] know your children don't have to get the
[2:23:26] Holy Ghost up here? Did you know your
[2:23:29] children can get the Holy Ghost at home?
[2:23:32] Did you know every every one of my first
[2:23:34] cousins received the baptism of the Holy
[2:23:36] Ghost in my grandmother's living room on
[2:23:38] a New Year's Eve?
[2:23:41] None of them in a Pentecostal church. My
[2:23:44] granny didn't care whether they went to
[2:23:45] where where they went to church as long
[2:23:47] as they went to church. But when they
[2:23:48] come to her house, she was going to
[2:23:50] build an atmosphere that made it
[2:23:52] possible that they could reach up for
[2:23:54] something more. And I watched my first
[2:23:56] cousins
[2:23:58] come under the influence of the Holy
[2:24:00] Ghost at home and not in the church.
[2:24:03] Wouldn't it be wonderful?
[2:24:05] I remember times that the presence of
[2:24:08] the Lord would come sweeping in the van
[2:24:11] as my wife and I would ride along with
[2:24:13] our children singing songs. And we have
[2:24:16] literally sat in the yard. We'd already
[2:24:19] got to the house, but we sat in the yard
[2:24:22] and continued to praise the Lord. Our
[2:24:25] children with us, not wanting to open
[2:24:29] the door and let it out, not wanting to
[2:24:32] disturb the presence of the Lord. It's
[2:24:35] possible. But how many of you know that
[2:24:37] atmosphere doesn't come when mom and
[2:24:39] daddy's fighting?
[2:24:42] Never does.
[2:24:45] In World War II, there was a soldier
[2:24:48] whose name was Robert
[2:24:50] who wrote letters to his children from
[2:24:52] the front lines.
[2:24:54] He was slightly older than most of his
[2:24:56] buddies. And in each one of those
[2:24:59] letters, he included a verse. And the
[2:25:01] first verse that he wrote was reported
[2:25:05] to be Joshua 1:9. Have not I commanded
[2:25:08] thee? Be strong and of a good courage.
[2:25:10] Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed.
[2:25:13] For the Lord thy God is with thee,
[2:25:15] whethersoever thou goest.
[2:25:17] He was facing the storms of war. He
[2:25:19] feared he'd never return, but he kept
[2:25:22] writing to his children to put their
[2:25:24] confidence in God, to pray, to trust
[2:25:28] God, to believe that if it was his will,
[2:25:32] he would spare Robert and let him come
[2:25:36] home to his family. Robert survived.
[2:25:41] Every one of those letters kept,
[2:25:44] preserved, and read for generations
[2:25:48] at family dinners,
[2:25:51] inspiring his sons and daughters, every
[2:25:54] one of them, all nine,
[2:25:57] to dedicate their lives to ministry.
[2:26:03] I read a story this week also of a dad,
[2:26:06] a dad of a teenage daughter
[2:26:10] lost his temper.
[2:26:12] No.
[2:26:14] After a tough day, snapping at her over
[2:26:18] a messy room.
[2:26:21] I don't think it's a good idea
[2:26:25] to let them have a messy room,
[2:26:28] but you should make sure yours is kept
[2:26:30] pretty neat
[2:26:33] if you're teaching them the same. Hello.
[2:26:37] Right. And I do believe there are things
[2:26:39] that matter more.
[2:26:42] That's just me.
[2:26:45] He really lost his temper, snapped.
[2:26:49] Later that evening, he was unable to
[2:26:51] sleep.
[2:26:53] He knocked on her door at midnight.
[2:26:56] He apologized and prayed with her and he
[2:27:00] showed her this psalm. The psalm that we
[2:27:02] have mentioned here so many times. Psalm
[2:27:04] 51 verse 10. Create in me a clean heart,
[2:27:10] oh God, and renew a right spirit within
[2:27:15] me. That moment of humility,
[2:27:19] that moment of heartfelt apology. You
[2:27:23] see, all the I'm sorryries in the world
[2:27:26] will do no good
[2:27:29] until there's a change of behavior.
[2:27:34] Some people have a hard time
[2:27:35] apologizing. Some people apologize all
[2:27:38] the time and it means nothing.
[2:27:41] What your kids are looking for in you is
[2:27:44] the ability to say, "We got it wrong.
[2:27:48] That wasn't the way to handle that." My
[2:27:51] wife is here and she can tell you the
[2:27:52] big amen that we've had to do it
[2:27:55] multiple times. I wish we hadn't handled
[2:27:58] that. I I not too long ago said
[2:28:00] something to Joshua and I didn't even
[2:28:03] mean it. And he's a grown man, so to
[2:28:05] speak,
[2:28:07] with the fresh haircut. Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:13] We were driving home from church on a
[2:28:15] Sunday and I said something to him. It
[2:28:18] just came out. I don't even know why I
[2:28:22] said it because I didn't really even
[2:28:24] mean it in the way that it came out and
[2:28:26] it crushed my heart.
[2:28:34] I heard how cruel it could be taken.
[2:28:38] Honestly, I didn't even mean it cruy,
[2:28:42] but it the sound of my own voice
[2:28:46] saying those words
[2:28:49] sounded so cruel to me
[2:28:52] that it broke my heart.
[2:28:55] And I apologize to him. I'm so sorry. I
[2:28:57] didn't even mean it the way it could
[2:29:01] easily be taken. "It's all right, Dad,"
[2:29:04] he said.
[2:29:06] But before we got home, I only lived
[2:29:08] four miles. Before we got home, I'd
[2:29:10] apologize at least three more times.
[2:29:14] We got home to change clothes and I went
[2:29:17] back in his room before I could even
[2:29:19] finish what I was doing. and I grabbed
[2:29:21] him and I hugged him and I said, "I am
[2:29:23] so very very sorry.
[2:29:29] Can't promise that I won't ever hurt you
[2:29:31] again, but I'll do my best.
[2:29:36] Words matter.
[2:29:40] None of us are above it.
[2:29:45] We've got to watch it, don't we?
[2:29:48] I'm glad for every daddy in this house
[2:29:50] that cares enough to go back and say,
[2:29:54] "I'm really sorry and I'm really going
[2:29:57] to change my way and do it."
[2:30:01] Change behavior is what makes a
[2:30:03] difference. Right? When that when that
[2:30:06] dad got down on his knees with his
[2:30:08] rebellious
[2:30:10] teenage daughter,
[2:30:12] she'd really been giving him some
[2:30:14] trouble. And it was easier for him to
[2:30:17] snap at her because of it. But he went
[2:30:19] in and got down with his Bible and read
[2:30:21] by her bed. Created me a clean heart, oh
[2:30:24] God. That moment of humility and sincere
[2:30:28] apology. And her dad, it was like a
[2:30:31] chisel going into that rebellion. It
[2:30:33] just started cracking it open.
[2:30:37] And later she said, "It was not until
[2:30:40] that night that I ever understood what
[2:30:45] grace looked like." His apology
[2:30:51] to her was so sincere and so heartfelt
[2:30:54] that she began to spew
[2:30:58] all of the reasons, all the feelings and
[2:31:01] the emotions that she had shut in and
[2:31:04] had eventually led to her ultimate
[2:31:06] rebellion against her parents. It all
[2:31:09] come washing out of her in that one
[2:31:11] moment. May May God give every one of us
[2:31:14] who need that kind of a moment with our
[2:31:18] children. May God give us an
[2:31:20] opportunity.
[2:31:21] You that have small David, I pray you
[2:31:24] never have to have that. You You're
[2:31:26] small. Benjamin, I pray you never have
[2:31:28] to have that. But if you ever do, may
[2:31:31] God grant you that moment, the wisdom,
[2:31:35] the strategy to start cracking away that
[2:31:38] rebellious heart. Because if it doesn't
[2:31:41] get broken, it only expands.
[2:31:45] It grows.
[2:31:48] So today, this is what I want us to
[2:31:50] leave here with.
[2:31:52] A scripture that says in 2 Corinthians
[2:31:54] chapter 13:5,
[2:31:57] my brothers and sisters, if we're called
[2:31:59] to be lighthousekeepers for our own
[2:32:01] family,
[2:32:02] then first we have to do what 2
[2:32:05] Corinthians 13:5 says, examine
[2:32:07] yourselves.
[2:32:09] Whether you be in the faith, prove your
[2:32:11] own selves. Know ye not your own selves,
[2:32:14] how that Jesus Christ is in you,
[2:32:18] except you be reprobate,
[2:32:21] looking inward
[2:32:24] instead of outward,
[2:32:27] checking up to see what we could do
[2:32:29] different instead of always dealing out
[2:32:32] what everybody else can do different.
[2:32:35] That's going to be the most effective
[2:32:37] way. Trim your wick,
[2:32:41] wipe your lens,
[2:32:44] haul your oil
[2:32:46] to the top of the stairs.
[2:32:49] Don't let that light go out.
[2:32:53] Make up your mind.
[2:32:56] Matthew chapter 5 verse 16. Let your
[2:33:00] light, this is red letters, so shine
[2:33:04] before men that they may see your good
[2:33:07] works and glorify your father which is
[2:33:11] in heaven.
[2:33:12] I cannot stress enough the importance
[2:33:19] of learning to trust.
[2:33:23] You can't trust your parents.
[2:33:26] Who can you trust?
[2:33:29] If you can't know they're going to be
[2:33:31] there for you, who will?
[2:33:36] In the message in closing,
[2:33:39] the uncertain sound,
[2:33:42] brother Brandham had found his way up to
[2:33:44] the top of the Statue of Liberty.
[2:33:51] Paragraph 74, he said, "Down through the
[2:33:54] ages, she never varied.
[2:33:57] at little old church that believe that
[2:33:59] word of God weighed right through every
[2:34:03] persecution there. They tried to stamp
[2:34:05] it out, burn it out, persecute it out,
[2:34:08] kill it out, drown it out. And what
[2:34:11] happens? She wades on.
[2:34:13] He said some time ago standing in the
[2:34:15] Statue of Liberty, a little bunch of
[2:34:18] sparrows laying dead.
[2:34:22] He's standing literally in the torch
[2:34:26] of the Statue of Liberty.
[2:34:29] It was opened for visitors at the time.
[2:34:33] And he sees these little dozens of dead
[2:34:36] sparrows laying all around. He said,
[2:34:38] "What's the matter?" And they said to
[2:34:40] him, "There was a storm last night and
[2:34:43] that big light was beaming out across
[2:34:46] the water and every one of those little
[2:34:48] birds
[2:34:50] were lost.
[2:34:52] He said if they just knowed to took the
[2:34:55] light,
[2:34:58] if they could have just taken the light,
[2:35:01] that light would have guided them to
[2:35:04] safety.
[2:35:06] That light was there to say to the
[2:35:09] ships, "Don't come any closer.
[2:35:13] You're going to run around if you do."
[2:35:17] The little birds
[2:35:19] didn't understand the message.
[2:35:22] He said, "What was they trying to do?"
[2:35:24] They tried to beat the light out. What
[2:35:27] did they do? They beat their brains out
[2:35:29] trying to put out the light. The light
[2:35:32] that was sent to help them.
[2:35:38] You cold formal Pentecostals, you cold
[2:35:40] formal Methodists, you cold formal
[2:35:43] Baptists, you cold formal message
[2:35:45] believers. I just added that you
[2:35:48] unbeliever that's trying to beat Christ
[2:35:50] out of the nation, trying to put
[2:35:53] education and science instead of the
[2:35:55] Holy Ghost, you'll beat your brains out
[2:35:58] and the light will still beam on and on
[2:36:03] and on and on. Yes, sir. Let's stand.
[2:36:07] The musicians are coming. Do you know
[2:36:08] what the problem was?
[2:36:11] Those little birds didn't trust the
[2:36:12] light.
[2:36:16] If you're going to be a successful
[2:36:18] lighthouse to your family,
[2:36:22] you're going to have to show them
[2:36:24] through your years of endurance and
[2:36:26] faithfulness
[2:36:28] that they can trust you.
[2:36:32] It's it's the most important thing.
[2:36:35] If you want to speak into somebody's
[2:36:37] life, you can only do it when there's a
[2:36:40] trust.
[2:36:42] I am uh extremely thankful.
[2:36:48] I am close enough to some of these
[2:36:51] families to know
[2:36:53] that uh these dads aren't perfect, but
[2:36:57] I'm very thankful that they are
[2:36:59] dedicated,
[2:37:00] committed
[2:37:02] to leading by example,
[2:37:08] bringing their families to church.
[2:37:13] If you sit back when the spirit of God
[2:37:15] is moving,
[2:37:17] a lot of times your children will too.
[2:37:21] Don't send them to the front. Bring
[2:37:23] them. Come with them. Show them that
[2:37:27] humble heart. Teach them how to approach
[2:37:30] God that way. That's one thing you'll
[2:37:33] never be sorry of. You'll never be
[2:37:36] ashamed. and you'll never regret the
[2:37:38] times that you pointed them toward the
[2:37:40] Lord. He's the best kind of papa I know.
[2:37:44] Faithful in all of his ways. Lord, I
[2:37:47] want to thank you right now. My heart is
[2:37:50] a bit full today and my mind searches
[2:37:53] this house.
[2:37:56] Not just fathers that are here, but even
[2:37:59] fathers that have gone before us.
[2:38:03] Some of them not living the best of
[2:38:06] lives.
[2:38:07] in their younger years, but finding you
[2:38:11] and changing everything.
[2:38:15] They've gone before us.
[2:38:17] We're going to go along behind them one
[2:38:19] of these days. And Lord, may we reach
[2:38:22] higher than they reached. May we go
[2:38:25] deeper than they went. May we be even
[2:38:28] better examples than they were.
[2:38:34] I was thinking
[2:38:37] that without you, Lord, none of us would
[2:38:39] be able to do this. It's only by your
[2:38:42] grace.
[2:38:44] Will you touch these great men? Will you
[2:38:47] fill them with more of the Holy Ghost
[2:38:51] and fire?
[2:38:53] Will you touch their homes, their
[2:38:56] children, their wives? Will you
[2:38:58] strengthen them? May you give us grace
[2:39:01] to build stronger families
[2:39:04] because in building a stronger family,
[2:39:07] we're building the kingdom of God.
[2:39:10] We'll give you praise and honor and
[2:39:12] glory for it's in the name of Jesus
[2:39:14] Christ that we confess our failure to
[2:39:17] you and ask for your help. And the saint
[2:39:20] said,
[2:39:22] "Amen."
[2:39:24] When I came in here this morning, I was
[2:39:26] thinking of Jonathan
[2:39:29] and I was thinking of brother Marin
[2:39:30] Hollis,
[2:39:34] Jonathan's dad.
[2:39:37] He was a short fellow with the big
[2:39:40] guitar.
[2:39:42] I'll never forget the first time I ever
[2:39:44] saw him heard him sing
[2:39:48] the guitar bigger than he was.
[2:39:52] He really looked like a just a little
[2:39:55] short fellow with a big guitar and he
[2:39:57] was singing a song that says, "If you'll
[2:39:59] move over just a little bit, I'll help
[2:40:02] you carry your load."
[2:40:05] And I'm sitting there thinking, "Man,
[2:40:07] brother, you don't look big enough to
[2:40:08] carry your load.
[2:40:10] How are you going to carry somebody
[2:40:12] else's load?"
[2:40:15] Ninth grade education.
[2:40:18] Never never finished high school. worked
[2:40:20] hard, didn't even have a driver's
[2:40:23] license,
[2:40:26] but loved the Lord and his word and this
[2:40:30] message with everything that was in him.
[2:40:34] He saw it. He didn't just hear it. He
[2:40:36] saw it. He sat in Shreveport
[2:40:40] and saw the glory and presence of God
[2:40:42] come down in those meetings, changing
[2:40:45] his life forever.
[2:40:47] I I went on to discover how that little
[2:40:50] short fella was going to help me carry
[2:40:53] my load
[2:40:55] and help his kids carry their load. He
[2:40:58] was going to do it in prayer.
[2:41:02] No driver's license, but he had a place
[2:41:04] of prayer on the creek.
[2:41:08] And he was coming back from that place
[2:41:10] of prayer. I promise you, Jonathan,
[2:41:12] Sharon, and Rachel, I promise you, I
[2:41:16] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that
[2:41:20] he called every one of your names
[2:41:23] at the creek that day. I believe he
[2:41:26] called my name at the creek that day.
[2:41:30] The last testimony that he ever gave in
[2:41:33] church,
[2:41:35] he stood up and he just started. They
[2:41:39] just started to our church. But he stood
[2:41:42] up and gave this testimony. He said, "I
[2:41:44] want to thank God for a pastor with a
[2:41:47] backbone like a saw log. I know he
[2:41:50] called my name that day in prayer."
[2:41:54] That's the legacy
[2:41:58] that he left.
[2:42:00] I wished you could have had him in Jod.
[2:42:02] I didn't call Jod's name. I wish you
[2:42:05] could have had him. Uh,
[2:42:08] I wish that he could have stayed here to
[2:42:10] be an old grumpy man
[2:42:13] that you'd have had to
[2:42:16] whatever to take care of him, cut his
[2:42:18] toenails.
[2:42:20] But the Lord had another plan.
[2:42:24] He did. He took him. What a legacy he
[2:42:27] left behind. I can't physically carry
[2:42:31] anybody else's load, but I know where
[2:42:33] the answers are.
[2:42:35] I'll go down to the place on the creek
[2:42:36] and pour my heart out to God. He'd come
[2:42:38] he come along that way
[2:42:42] and a
[2:42:44] car come along. Somebody drinking and
[2:42:46] carrying on and
[2:42:48] ran over him and pinned him to the tree
[2:42:53] backed off and left him to bleed there
[2:42:55] to death.
[2:42:58] I was in the courthouse when the trial
[2:43:00] came up and I I heard Jonathan's mother
[2:43:03] who's with the Lord now.
[2:43:06] Country and plain and simple. And
[2:43:10] I I doubt she graduated from high
[2:43:12] school. Did she? She did.
[2:43:19] She looked and she said
[2:43:21] to those who were responsible, I want
[2:43:24] you to know I forgive you
[2:43:28] because Jesus has forgiven me. Oh Lord
[2:43:32] of mercy,
[2:43:35] I lost the dearest thing to me.
[2:43:39] But I want you to know the forgiveness
[2:43:41] of the Lord and the grace of God.
[2:43:45] That's the legacy that mama left behind.
[2:43:48] I just I got overwhelmed. I just looked
[2:43:51] over and saw
[2:43:53] Jonathan shiny head
[2:43:56] and I thought, "Oh my goodness.
[2:44:00] Oh my goodness.
[2:44:04] Anything good that you can accomplish
[2:44:07] for the Lord is by his grace and by the
[2:44:11] legacy."
[2:44:13] I don't know that they understood it all
[2:44:15] because I don't.
[2:44:18] But what they knew, they believed with
[2:44:19] all of their heart. Folks,
[2:44:24] if you can't leave anything behind but
[2:44:26] the but the example of taking it to the
[2:44:30] Lord in prayer. Do that for your kids.
[2:44:34] Jason, you ought to let Axel hear you
[2:44:37] raising the rafters every now and again,
[2:44:40] not fussing.
[2:44:43] praying,
[2:44:46] calling on the Lord.
[2:44:48] That's the lesson.
[2:44:53] Come and sing a worship song. I'm I'm
[2:44:57] too mushy to talk now and I've talked
[2:45:00] enough.
[2:45:02] Thank God for all these wonderful godly
[2:45:06] fathers.
[2:45:13] I'
[2:45:15] [Music]
[2:45:21] think you're like, but I
[2:45:26] tender whisper of love
[2:45:31] in the dead of night. Can you tell me
[2:45:37] that you're pleased that I am never
[2:45:42] alone?
[2:45:44] [Music]
[2:45:46] You're a good, good father. It's who you
[2:45:50] are.
[2:45:52] It's who you are.
[2:45:55] It's who you are. And I'm loved by you.
[2:46:00] It's who I am.
[2:46:03] It's who I am.
[2:46:06] It's who I am. You're a good good
[2:46:10] father. It's who you are. Yes, you are.
[2:46:14] It's who you are.
[2:46:16] It's who you are. And I'm loved by you.
[2:46:22] It's who I am.
[2:46:24] It's who I am.
[2:46:27] It's who I am.
[2:46:29] [Music]
[2:46:31] Oh, I see many searching for answers
[2:46:39] far and wide. But I know Jesus, you are
[2:46:47] that
[2:46:49] and you proide. Cuz you know
[2:46:54] just what we need before we even say a
[2:47:00] word. You're a good good father.
[2:47:05] Who are
[2:47:07] you are? Oh, it's who you are. And I'm
[2:47:12] loved by you. It's who I am.
[2:47:17] It's who I am.
[2:47:20] It's who I am.
[2:47:23] Oh, I see many searching for answers
[2:47:32] far and wide. But I know that Jesus, you
[2:47:39] are that
[2:47:42] and you proide cuz you know just what we
[2:47:49] need before we even say our word. You're
[2:47:54] a good good father. It's who you are.
[2:47:59] Oh, it's who you are.
[2:48:02] It's who you are. And I'm loved by you.
[2:48:07] It's who I am.
[2:48:10] It's who I am.
[2:48:12] It's who I am.
[2:48:15] Because you are perfect in all of your
[2:48:19] ways.
[2:48:21] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[2:48:26] Oh, you are perfect in all of your ways.
[2:48:31] Oh Jesus.
[2:48:35] Oh because you are perfect in all of
[2:48:40] your ways.
[2:48:42] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[2:48:47] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[2:48:52] Jesus.
[2:48:54] Sing that again. Because you are
[2:48:56] perfect. Because you are perfect in all
[2:49:00] of your ways.
[2:49:03] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[2:49:08] You are perfect in all of your ways,
[2:49:13] Jesus.
[2:49:14] [Music]
[2:49:18] Oh, it's love so
[2:49:22] uniable.
[2:49:26] I can hardly speak. Peace so
[2:49:32] unexplainable.
[2:49:35] I I can't hardly think as you call me.
[2:49:43] Deeper still as you call me.
[2:49:48] Deeper still as you call me.
[2:49:53] deeper still into love. Oh love, love.
[2:49:58] You're a good good father. It's who you
[2:50:03] are.
[2:50:04] It's who you are.
[2:50:07] It's who you are. And I'm loved by you.
[2:50:12] It's who I am.
[2:50:15] It's who I am. Oh, it's who I am. You're
[2:50:20] a good, good father. It's who you are.
[2:50:25] Oh, it's who you are.

[2:50:33] It's who I am.
[2:50:35] It's who I am.
[2:50:38] It's who I am. Sing this part. And
[2:50:42] you're perfect in all of your ways.
[2:50:47] You are perfect in all of your ways.
[2:50:52] You are perfect in all of your ways, oh
[2:50:57] Jesus.
[2:51:01] Lord, we're not we are not perfect in
[2:51:04] all of our ways. No daddy, no mama, no
[2:51:08] husband, no wife, no human perfect in
[2:51:12] all of their ways, but you are. And we
[2:51:16] want to thank you for it.
[2:51:18] We want to thank you for the perfection
[2:51:20] of the sacrifice that was offered on our
[2:51:24] behalf. We want to serve you and love
[2:51:27] you with all that we have. Lord Jesus,
[2:51:30] may we bring glory and honor to your
[2:51:32] kingdom. We want to have every father to
[2:51:36] come and stand here just a moment. We
[2:51:38] want to pray over you. We're going to
[2:51:40] make room for you. Come on.
[2:51:44] We're going to ask your family to come
[2:51:46] and stand behind you.
[2:51:50] Those of them that are here, and if you
[2:51:52] don't have anybody here,
[2:51:55] somebody get around Brother Shaw. And
[2:51:58] he's been a daddy to a lot of folks.
[2:52:06] Oh Jesus,
[2:52:10] strengthen.
[2:52:13] Let's get you all to come down. You
[2:52:15] daddies, come down.
[2:52:19] Let your family stand behind you.
[2:52:27] [Music]
[2:52:40] I usually say this and I haven't said
[2:52:42] it.
[2:52:44] I thank God for every mama
[2:52:48] who had to be both.
[2:52:52] My mama was both.
[2:52:55] She had to be a mama and a daddy to me.
[2:53:00] And I appreciate that sacrifice. God
[2:53:03] didn't build a woman like that.
[2:53:07] But what a woman has to do sometimes,
[2:53:10] she just does it.
[2:53:13] And my mother did that and I'm thankful
[2:53:14] for her. So if there are mothers here
[2:53:17] that had to be both, God bless you. God
[2:53:19] bless you. God bless you. And may we may
[2:53:24] we not continue that tradition, but may
[2:53:26] we we be everything we can for our
[2:53:28] children because we had a mama who did
[2:53:30] it all. Amen.
[2:53:33] Father, would you come now, Lord Jesus?
[2:53:38] Would you touch these men of God?
[2:53:42] Would you fill them Lord with strength
[2:53:45] and with grace
[2:53:49] and courage?
[2:53:54] May they today
[2:53:56] feel valued by their families,
[2:54:00] by their community.
[2:54:03] What would we do without their strength?
[2:54:07] What would we do without their amens?
[2:54:10] And not just the ones that come from
[2:54:13] their mouths, but the ones that also
[2:54:16] come from their lives.
[2:54:21] What would we do, Lord, without them?
[2:54:24] Would you just surround them today?
[2:54:29] [Music]
[2:54:31] Make us better dads
[2:54:34] and granddads.
[2:54:42] Let your word burn in our hearts.
[2:54:49] Give us
[2:54:51] wisdom
[2:54:53] to teach it
[2:54:56] to set an example with it
[2:55:00] to be all that you have called us to be.
[2:55:06] Lord, let all of our daddies today, let
[2:55:09] us everyone trim our wicks and polish
[2:55:12] our lenses and
[2:55:15] haul the oil to the top of the
[2:55:17] lighthouse and make sure that we are
[2:55:20] constantly consistently sending out a
[2:55:24] light
[2:55:26] to those around us. As brother Vanham
[2:55:28] said, every one of us be a lighthouse.
[2:55:31] And the first place to be a lighthouse
[2:55:34] is to our own families.
[2:55:36] to every stepdad, to every foster dad,
[2:55:39] to every adopted dad. Strengthen them,
[2:55:43] bless them, fill them.
[2:55:46] Lord, you see uh men among us who have
[2:55:52] not yet had the opportunity to have a
[2:55:55] child of their own.
[2:55:58] But I don't know any of them to be
[2:56:01] selfish men. I see every one of them to
[2:56:04] be
[2:56:05] givers and lovers and
[2:56:10] they adopt somebody else's and
[2:56:14] ride them on the tractor and
[2:56:18] hug them and embrace them and love them
[2:56:21] and
[2:56:23] Lord strengthen these men. I pray
[2:56:35] [Music]
[2:56:38] You know, that's perfectly all right.
[2:56:40] That does not disturb me at all.
[2:56:43] Reach your hand toward Josiah, who may
[2:56:46] perhaps have the most difficult task
[2:56:48] among us.
[2:56:52] Thank God for the help that he gets, but
[2:56:54] that doesn't always relieve the burden.
[2:56:57] Strengthen our brother today, Lord.
[2:57:05] single dad, but a loving father and one
[2:57:09] who desires the very best
[2:57:13] for Charlotte. And we ask you today,
[2:57:16] Lord, to pour into him when his oil gets
[2:57:19] to running low and his wick gets a
[2:57:22] little burned over. Would you stir him
[2:57:24] and pour into him? And would you help
[2:57:28] others to
[2:57:30] [Music]
[2:57:32] help him along the way. Not only just in
[2:57:35] the physical, but but emotionally and
[2:57:37] spiritually. May we pour into him,
[2:57:44] Lord. There may be an overwhelmed dad
[2:57:46] here today. Would you just fill them and
[2:57:52] give them strength to run on? Uh-huh.
[2:57:56] There may be some broken relationships
[2:58:00] represented here today.
[2:58:04] Disappointments and regrets. Would you
[2:58:06] heal, Lord? What can be healed?
[2:58:11] Give fresh starts to what needs to start
[2:58:14] again.
[2:58:18] Grace for closure
[2:58:21] when things need to be closed.
[2:58:25] What a good papa you've been.
[2:58:29] None of us thought we could and we
[2:58:32] realized quite quickly we couldn't
[2:58:35] without you.
[2:58:38] But you have provided what we need
[2:58:43] and we praise you.
[2:58:47] I don't ever remember it being so noisy
[2:58:49] on Mother's Day.
[2:58:52] Why? Why is it that on Father's Day
[2:58:55] they're all stirred?
[2:59:00] Oh Jesus. I wished I could have done
[2:59:02] better this morning in the delivery. And
[2:59:05] I wished I could have taken out of my
[2:59:07] heart, laid it here on the pull pit so
[2:59:09] you could have seen what was in it.
[2:59:14] I just want all of you to know we love
[2:59:16] you and we are so
[2:59:19] excited.
[2:59:32] I couldn't have done no good if I didn't
[2:59:34] work up a good sweat.
[2:59:36] But may God strengthen every one of you.
[2:59:41] I don't want to tell your families how
[2:59:42] to do it, but I hope I hope before you
[2:59:44] go to bed at tonight, I hope you feel
[2:59:50] valued and seen and important in your
[2:59:54] kids' life,
[2:59:56] cuz you are. Now, Charlotte, you be sure
[2:59:58] to tell daddy all those things I just
[3:00:00] said.
[3:00:05] You men are blessed. You've got good
[3:00:07] wives to stand with you and bless you
[3:00:10] and support you. A lot of you do love
[3:00:12] one another, would you? Let's go home.
[3:00:14] Let's be dismissed today in the name of
[3:00:15] the Lord Jesus.
[3:00:19] Happy Father's Day.
[3:00:26] Love you.
