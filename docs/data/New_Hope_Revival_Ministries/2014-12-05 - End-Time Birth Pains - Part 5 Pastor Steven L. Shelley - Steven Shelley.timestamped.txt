[0:23] thank you
[0:26] foreign
[0:52] hello I'm Pastor Stephen Shelley and I
[0:55] want to welcome you to the Eagles cry
[0:57] broadcast I'm coming to you from the New
[1:01] Hope Revival ministries in Smith Station
[1:03] Alabama United States of America I don't
[1:07] know where you are around the world but
[1:09] I want to say what a great privilege it
[1:11] is for me to be able to speak to you
[1:14] today in the mighty name of our Messiah
[1:17] the Lord Jesus Christ it is a real joy
[1:21] to be living in the hour that we're
[1:23] living in knowing that we are
[1:26] approaching the coming of the kingdom of
[1:28] God to this earth and things are dark
[1:32] there's no doubt about it I'm not going
[1:34] to pretend like things are not bad
[1:36] around us the enemy is Raging heathens
[1:39] are raging like the scripture says but
[1:42] it's time for the bride of Christ to
[1:45] arise and shine and let the light of the
[1:49] Glorious gospel be reflected in our
[1:51] lives and that's part of the Mandate on
[1:54] the Eagles cry I truly believe that God
[1:59] is sending a message a revelation of the
[2:02] Lord Jesus Christ that will help prepare
[2:05] and position a true elect bride a
[2:09] remnant bride those who will not be
[2:12] satisfied with meager church annity or
[2:15] the trappings and icons of religion but
[2:19] those who desire to lean on the Lord's
[2:22] chest to put our ear to his chest
[2:26] Desiring to hear the heartbeat of God I
[2:30] want to know what he is concerned about
[2:32] in this hour I want to know what he
[2:35] loves I I want to discover what he hates
[2:38] I want to know everything there is to
[2:41] know about the Lord and I remember
[2:44] hearing one time a man of God a prophet
[2:47] of God brother William Branham who left
[2:50] the scene in 1960 65 but I want to thank
[2:55] God for the grace that he has given us
[2:57] to be able to preserve many of his
[3:02] sermons and they are recorded in digital
[3:05] format and print format you can listen
[3:09] to them stream them over the internet
[3:11] and so forth and I remember hearing him
[3:14] say in in one of his sermons so so many
[3:18] wonderful things about the nature of God
[3:21] and one comes to my mind right now he
[3:24] said that God is so big and so
[3:27] multifaceted so holy so powerful there's
[3:31] so much that we don't know about him
[3:34] that he would continue to reveal himself
[3:38] to us throughout all eternity can you
[3:41] imagine God being so multifaceted his
[3:46] personality being so vast his attributes
[3:50] being so many so new numerous that it
[3:53] would take Eternity for him to reveal
[3:56] himself to us layer by layer like
[4:00] pulling the skin and the layers off of
[4:02] an onion God continually
[4:05] unfolding and unveiling himself if there
[4:10] were no other reason to know that you're
[4:12] redeemed to know that when you leave
[4:15] this earth you're going into the
[4:16] presence of the Lord that would be
[4:18] reason enough
[4:19] I want to thank you for contacting our
[4:22] ministry the New Hope Revival ministries
[4:24] we try to give you the contact
[4:27] information every week on the broadcast
[4:30] our website is
[4:33] revival.org that's
[4:35] revival.org you can go on and look at
[4:38] some of the resources that we have
[4:40] available for sale I know that you would
[4:43] be blessed and when you purchase some of
[4:46] those Ministry items you are a real
[4:49] blessing to us that's one of the ways
[4:52] that we're able to maintain the small
[4:54] staff that we have I I kid with all of
[4:58] them because really the the small amount
[5:01] of money that they receive they're
[5:02] really on a volunteer basis but if you
[5:06] Avail yourself of some of those
[5:07] resources it would be a great blessing
[5:09] to our ministry and to our staff we want
[5:12] to be faithful to pray with you over
[5:15] your prayer request I believe in the
[5:18] power of prayer and I dedicate cated my
[5:20] life to the Lord many many years ago in
[5:23] 1975 I gave him my whole life and and
[5:28] surrendered to the call of ministry as a
[5:31] seven-year-old boy and I committed
[5:33] myself to be an intercessor to pray for
[5:37] the saints of God and you know people
[5:39] say well you've been here and you've
[5:42] been in so many countries and you've
[5:44] done this and you've done that but but I
[5:47] want to say that the greatest privilege
[5:49] and perhaps the greatest accomplishment
[5:51] of my Ministry has been the time that
[5:54] I've spent in prayer on behalf of the
[5:56] people of God all over the world and so
[5:59] we are deeply committed to pray for your
[6:01] prayer request send them by email by
[6:04] letter or by phone call we would be more
[6:07] than happy to hear from you and I assure
[6:10] you that your prayer request will not
[6:13] find its way to the garbage bin but it
[6:16] will be seriously held before the Lord
[6:18] we even have people who send in their
[6:21] prayer requests and weeks later send
[6:24] back a testimony to say God answers
[6:27] prayer God delivers again and we have
[6:31] had amazing Miracles take place in
[6:33] people's bodies and in their lives
[6:36] salvations deliverances people baptized
[6:39] with the Holy Ghost healed from all
[6:42] manner of incurable diseases because
[6:44] Hebrews 13 and 8 is our theme Jesus
[6:48] Christ Yeshua our Messiah the same
[6:52] yesterday and today and forever guess
[6:56] what that means he will not change it
[7:01] also means that if he ever healed the
[7:04] sick body a sick body he is still able
[7:08] to heal the sick today if he ever saved
[7:11] a lost soul or delivered someone from
[7:14] the oppression of the enemy he is still
[7:17] able to do that today so what we read
[7:19] about him doing in the four gospels and
[7:22] what we read about him doing through the
[7:25] apostles in the book of Acts I want you
[7:27] to know I believe with my whole being he
[7:31] is still doing those very same things
[7:34] today I want you to pray for the fine
[7:37] Christian networks who are airing the
[7:40] Eagle's cry the gospel channel and Angel
[7:43] TV pray that God will continue to
[7:47] prosper them and expand them as he is
[7:50] positioning those networks to be Mighty
[7:54] instruments of his glory in the last
[7:56] days and those men and women of God need
[8:00] our prayers as they make decisions as
[8:03] they commit to expanding the networks so
[8:07] that we can reach more people with the
[8:10] with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:12] and both of those networks are streaming
[8:15] on the internet which is added expense
[8:18] but it certainly expands the Outreach of
[8:22] the broadcasts that are on those fine
[8:25] Christian networks so let's be faithful
[8:27] to pray now let's continue our Series
[8:30] today on the birth pangs of the Messiah
[8:33] or the coming of the Lord what we would
[8:36] sometimes refer to as the second coming
[8:39] of the Lord I I made clear to you in an
[8:42] earlier broadcast that I do believe that
[8:45] there is a resurrection Rapture for the
[8:49] bride of Christ that will it will
[8:52] absolutely take place before the great
[8:56] wrath when I say the great wrath I mean
[8:59] the last three and a half years of the
[9:01] tribulation period where the where the
[9:04] most harsh
[9:06] events are going to take place as God
[9:09] seeks to purify and cleanse the Earth
[9:12] and then after that is that amazing one
[9:15] thousand year Millennial reign of Peace
[9:18] where the prince of peace SAR Shalom
[9:21] will come and sit on the throne of his
[9:25] father David and talk about an amazing
[9:28] thing the scripture said he will sit in
[9:31] the millennial Temple the temple that
[9:33] Ezekiel Saw sitting once again on the
[9:37] Holy Mountain of Moriah and from that
[9:40] Temple our Messiah will sit and teach
[9:44] the Nations so I talk about a thousand
[9:48] year seminar I it just doesn't get any
[9:51] better than that when you sit at the
[9:53] feet of the Savior the King of Kings and
[9:56] the Lord of lords and learn all of the
[9:59] wonderful truths that he wants to share
[10:02] with his bride with his elect during
[10:05] that time of Peace it's going to be an
[10:08] amazing event somebody said some skeptic
[10:11] you know said well it sounds like a
[10:13] fairy tale well it may sound like a
[10:16] fairy tale to you but I find it in the
[10:18] word of God God and I believe that this
[10:22] word of God is the absolute truth and I
[10:24] believe that God wants to give us deeper
[10:27] Revelation in this hour of of the
[10:31] scripture so that we can we can sort of
[10:33] filter out traditional teaching the
[10:36] things that we've been that we've
[10:38] believed just because it was passed down
[10:40] to us from generation to generation and
[10:43] asked that the Holy Ghost would come
[10:46] anointing our eyes with ice ABS so that
[10:49] we could see the reality of the truth of
[10:51] God's word minus uh the traditions of
[10:55] man and all of the different
[10:58] um you know Slants and dogmas and Creeds
[11:01] and uh whatever else you might you might
[11:04] want to call it it's just according to
[11:07] how plain we want to get you know uh the
[11:10] just shall live by faith don't forget
[11:12] that we're not here on planet Earth
[11:14] paying for our sin let me tell you
[11:17] something our sin did debt has been
[11:20] settled by the Precious Blood of the
[11:24] sacrificial lamb Our Redeemer the Lord
[11:26] Jesus Christ and so it is no longer
[11:30] necessary for us to try to to appease
[11:33] God or to make some sort of sacrifice
[11:37] for our own sins
[11:39] um you know with Penance let's just say
[11:42] it that way with Penance we're no longer
[11:45] having to to repeat some magic words or
[11:48] or climb the steps of the Cathedral on
[11:51] our knees or something like that because
[11:54] the just shall live by faith the sin
[11:56] dead is paid when you've been Justified
[11:58] it is just if I'd never sinned and we're
[12:02] daily being Washed by the Water of the
[12:06] word that's the sanctifying process
[12:09] whereby we're cleansed and then we're
[12:12] empowered with the Holy Ghost and when
[12:15] the spirit of God when the Holy Ghost
[12:17] comes and lives inside of us it it puts
[12:20] that go ye in us it's the Zeal for the
[12:23] things of the Lord and and it's hard to
[12:26] contain ourselves sometime you know I
[12:28] get so angry at the Devil when I see his
[12:32] attempt to steal the joy of the saints
[12:35] of God and I mean there are a lot of
[12:38] people moving uh in in this life without
[12:42] joy and I'm telling you you need Joy
[12:45] because the joy of the Lord is your
[12:47] strength and somebody said well you know
[12:49] how can I have joy I've got cancer my my
[12:54] son is on drugs I have all of these
[12:57] different adverse circumstances going on
[12:59] in my life well I want you to know if
[13:01] there ever was a time to tap into the
[13:03] joy of the Lord that's the time you want
[13:05] to do it Paul and Silas beaten bleeding
[13:10] dripping bruised in the Roman jail and
[13:13] at the Midnight Hour they lifted up
[13:15] their hands and they begin to sing the
[13:18] high praises of God God the the joy of
[13:21] the Lord began to well up in their
[13:23] spirit and guess what happened God shook
[13:26] the jailhouse talk about Jailhouse Rock
[13:29] the whole jail began to shake and God
[13:32] delivered his holy men out of that
[13:36] prison and so whatever prison you're in
[13:39] today the joy of the Lord that's
[13:42] released in sincere praise and worship
[13:45] can be an amazing tool to bring you to
[13:49] that place of Joy where the jailhouse
[13:52] shakes the bars break and you have
[13:55] freedom you know the Bible said he whom
[13:58] the son sets free it's not just free
[14:02] we are free indeed I want you to know
[14:05] you're free indeed if you've been set
[14:08] free by the power of God now we've been
[14:11] talking about these birth pains and
[14:13] we've been counting them down this is
[14:16] the Fifth Fifth program in this series
[14:18] we've been counting them down
[14:20] backward from 10 down to one and number
[14:24] 10 is signs in the sun and the moon and
[14:28] the stars as Jesus speaks about in both
[14:31] Matthew 24 and in Luke 21 and then we've
[14:36] covered that pretty good and then we
[14:38] started talking about the the prediction
[14:41] that there would be violence upon the
[14:44] whole earth Luke 17 26 tells us that
[14:47] exactly the way it was in the days of
[14:49] Noah that's how it's going to be in the
[14:51] days of the coming of the son of man so
[14:53] we go to Genesis 6 and we discover just
[14:56] how it was in the days of Noah and we
[14:59] can certainly say that violence
[15:02] unprecedented violence it seems is is
[15:05] breaking out all over the world where
[15:08] people have no regard for the sanctity
[15:11] of human life for innocent women and
[15:13] children and people are willing to
[15:15] commit themselves to their ideologies to
[15:19] the extent of committing Sue suicide and
[15:22] wiping out dozens or hundreds of
[15:24] innocent people this is the kind of
[15:27] world that we're living in now and it
[15:30] tells us that we are in the birth pangs
[15:33] of the Messiah and as we have pointed
[15:36] out in the prior broadcast uh the reason
[15:40] why Jesus chose this analogy of a woman
[15:43] in travail of Labor is those
[15:46] contractions start mild and they are uh
[15:51] substantially apart there's quite a
[15:53] quite a distance between those
[15:55] contractions when labor is just in the
[15:58] onset stage but when it begins to
[16:01] transition into a heavier kind of Labor
[16:04] then those pains grow more intense and
[16:07] they grow more frequent so what we're
[16:10] seeing right now in 2013 is we're seeing
[16:13] a an increase in the frequency of these
[16:18] birth pains on the planet and and in the
[16:21] intensity and that's not going to stop
[16:23] or slow down now it's only going to
[16:26] continue to grow and so violence is
[16:29] going to continue to fill the whole
[16:31] earth and that's why we need a bomb
[16:33] shelter and I'm not talking about
[16:35] necessarily a hole in the ground we we
[16:38] have Psalm 91 we have the promise that
[16:41] we can find our safety under the shadow
[16:44] of the wings of the almighty I'm telling
[16:48] you that's a good place to hide let him
[16:50] cover you with his feathers let him wrap
[16:53] you up in his wings is the analogy that
[16:56] the psalmist David gave and it'll work
[16:58] for me I long to be wrapped up in his
[17:01] care and in his protection and and as I
[17:04] have traveled the nations of the world
[17:06] for all of these 30 plus years I've
[17:10] needed his wings and let me tell you my
[17:13] personal testimony is he is sufficient
[17:16] I've been on I've been on airplanes
[17:19] across Africa with with holes in the
[17:22] fuselage that would drop hundreds of
[17:24] feet at a time I've been in places where
[17:27] mobs were coming to kill us I have ran
[17:31] literally run for my life because we
[17:35] were being pursued in a foreign country
[17:37] and I have seen the hand of God take
[17:40] care of us time and time again you know
[17:43] there's no greater life than serving God
[17:45] that there is no greater life and I I'm
[17:49] relatively a young man 44 years old but
[17:53] I've given the Lord my entire life since
[17:55] I was at since I was seven years old and
[17:59] so I've got a lot of years of ministry
[18:01] and I want you to know I don't regret a
[18:03] mile I don't regret one mile but I've
[18:06] traveled for the Lord I don't regret one
[18:09] time that I've made any amount of
[18:12] sacrifice and I don't want to indicate
[18:14] that my sacrifices have been huge in
[18:17] comparison to to some people I haven't
[18:19] had to sacrifice advice much at all but
[18:22] I want you to know anything I've had to
[18:24] give up to follow Jesus Christ I would
[18:27] give it up again I would gladly lay it
[18:30] down there is no other life other than
[18:33] serving him and I don't know why I'm
[18:35] taking time to say these kinds of things
[18:37] today except perhaps that the Lord is
[18:40] having me to speak to somebody's heart
[18:42] who feels discouraged who feels like you
[18:46] can't go on I want you to know that I'm
[18:48] asking the Lord even now to send the
[18:51] power of the Holy Spirit to let his
[18:53] presence hover around you and settle
[18:56] down over you right now bringing a
[18:59] calmness to both your soul and your
[19:02] spirit and I'm asking that your body
[19:05] created by God began to line up in even
[19:08] the systems of your body right now line
[19:11] up in the authority of Jesus Christ with
[19:14] the plan of the Creator so that you can
[19:17] begin to walk in health and I'm praying
[19:20] right now and just sort of releasing
[19:22] this anointing right now for people who
[19:25] are dealing with heavy anxiety even
[19:28] panic attacks and what what we would
[19:31] call nervous spells and that awful
[19:34] confession keeps coming out of your
[19:36] mouth I'm losing my mind you need to
[19:39] quit saying that you need to stop saying
[19:43] that quit prophesying your own condition
[19:45] and begin to declare by the word of the
[19:49] Lord with his stripes I am healed and
[19:52] begin to prophesy into the atmosphere
[19:55] the scripture promise that says I will
[19:59] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
[20:03] stayed on me put your mind and your
[20:07] affection and your attention and your
[20:09] focus on the Lord and let him give you
[20:11] the strength that you need to look away
[20:13] from your present circumstances right
[20:16] now and look to him
[20:18] you perhaps are even on medication uh
[20:21] for for the condition that you're going
[20:23] through right now and I encourage you
[20:25] not to be condemned by the fact that you
[20:28] need medication but I'm asking the Lord
[20:30] to heal you I'm asking the Lord to
[20:32] deliver you and to eventually bring you
[20:34] to a place with some proper monitoring
[20:37] and care and some accountability that
[20:40] maybe you don't have to depend on those
[20:41] things but don't you let the enemy
[20:44] condemn you because you've reached out
[20:46] to try to get help and that has required
[20:49] some medication uh you do what you need
[20:52] to do for now but I'm asking the Lord to
[20:55] give you freedom and victory I guarantee
[20:58] you that I'm speaking into people's
[21:00] lives right now who are watching this
[21:02] broadcast ordered of the Lord for you to
[21:06] have some hope and and God God wants us
[21:10] to be filled with hope and of course the
[21:13] enemy wants us to be hopeless and so
[21:15] we're we're not going to satisfy the
[21:18] enemy we're going going to put our hope
[21:19] and our trust in the Lord so there is
[21:21] going to be violence on the Earth but we
[21:24] have an Ark of Safety we have a place of
[21:27] shelter underneath us or the Everlasting
[21:31] Arms of God and then number eight we
[21:34] talked about last week famines
[21:37] pestilences and earthquakes and we took
[21:40] that from Matthew chapter 24 verse 7 and
[21:44] Luke chapter 21 verse 11 where it talks
[21:48] about I even gave you some statistics
[21:50] about how that there are many more
[21:53] earthquakes 8.0 and above when you
[21:57] average it out according to decade I
[22:00] noticed that the U.S Geological Survey
[22:03] was averaging it out for for 50 60 70
[22:07] years at a time and so it doesn't look
[22:10] like there's been that much increase
[22:11] when you break it down into decades you
[22:14] can see that it has been an amazing
[22:17] increase in earthquake Quakes and
[22:19] especially the deaths in fact from in in
[22:22] from the year 2000 to the year 2009 uh
[22:27] we have seen almost a quadruple in the
[22:30] amount of deaths caused by earthquakes
[22:32] and so these things are going to
[22:34] continue and our hope and our confidence
[22:38] needs to be in the Lord and not in in
[22:42] you know natural uh protection and what
[22:45] we see
[22:47] these things are not going to cease
[22:49] they're going to continue and and so
[22:52] what we need to do is just draw up real
[22:54] close to the Lord just get as close to
[22:57] him as you possibly can and let God use
[23:00] you to spread the light of God of the
[23:03] gospel and he'll take care of us and
[23:06] like I said it in the broadcast last
[23:08] week look if if it takes me you know if
[23:12] if uh if if I fall victim to a natural
[23:15] disaster a hurricane or or Earth
[23:18] earthquake listen God knew that from the
[23:20] beginning it wasn't a mistake and I'll
[23:22] tell you this to be absent from the body
[23:25] is to be present with the Lord I'm like
[23:28] you I want to live as long as I can I
[23:30] want to continue to raise my four
[23:31] beautiful children I want to continue to
[23:34] to live and and peace with and happiness
[23:36] and enjoy my wife I want to keep
[23:39] enjoying the ministry and but listen if
[23:41] he calls me I know where I am and
[23:44] there's no greater peace in all the
[23:45] world than being able to lay your head
[23:47] on the pillow at night and know that
[23:50] you're ready to meet God I want to get
[23:52] to number seven quickly we'll have to
[23:54] cover it in in Greater detail in next
[23:57] week's broadcast but number seven in our
[24:00] countdown of the birth Pains of the
[24:02] Messiah is that Nations will be in
[24:05] distress with perplexity
[24:08] that is in Luke chapter 21 and verse 25
[24:12] Jesus is speaking and he said and there
[24:15] shall be signs and upon the Earth
[24:17] distress of nations with perplexity the
[24:22] Sea and the waves roaring and so uh we
[24:27] can say that this is already definitely
[24:29] full swing the nations are in distress
[24:32] with great perplexity now that word
[24:36] perplexity means without understanding
[24:38] confusion and and when we look at the
[24:42] world situation what's going on and uh
[24:45] with with uh different leaders in
[24:48] different nations and regimes being
[24:51] raised up we're living in an hour right
[24:54] now where uh there is a nation in the
[24:57] world more than one where a leader the
[25:00] leader of the nation is massacring
[25:02] murdering his own people and and it must
[25:06] produce a a tremendous amount of
[25:09] distress and
[25:11] perplexity and confusion in people's
[25:14] minds as they fear for their life many
[25:16] of them not knowing that they have hope
[25:18] by trusting in the Lord Jesus so we want
[25:21] to pray for Nations like Syria and many
[25:24] many others in Egypt and other places
[25:27] where there is uprisings it is a
[25:31] definite sign of The Nearness of the
[25:33] coming of the Lord and unfortunately
[25:35] it's going to continue to to be that way
[25:40] and I think again it's going to grow in
[25:44] frequency and in intensity so we want to
[25:48] pray for the Nations
[25:49] if you are a Spirit-filled believer an
[25:52] intercessor uh you can pray for the
[25:55] nations of the world my prayer for the
[25:57] Nations is is uh not as much about peace
[26:01] as it is about salvation I want to see
[26:04] people saved I don't want people to die
[26:06] lost I want them to be prepared to meet
[26:09] God I want the gospel to be able to
[26:12] penetrate uh every lie and every regime
[26:16] and every false religion that tries to
[26:19] keep the truth at bay that's what I want
[26:22] to see and you say well I'm just a
[26:24] little a little lady living here in
[26:26] England or I'm I'm just a brother here
[26:27] in Scandinavia or or whatever and I'm I
[26:31] I have no influence over the Nations let
[26:34] me tell you Satan trembles all of Hell
[26:37] shakes when the weakest Christian gets
[26:40] down on their knees and begins to call
[26:43] on the name of the Living God and so you
[26:46] can do a whole lot more damage to the
[26:48] kingdom of darkness than you realize
[26:49] eyes in your prayer and you can
[26:52] accomplish some pretty spectacular
[26:54] things when you pray in the spirit I
