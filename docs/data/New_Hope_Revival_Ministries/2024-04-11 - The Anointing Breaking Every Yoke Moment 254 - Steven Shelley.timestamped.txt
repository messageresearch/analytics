[0:00] how many of you know what Colossians
[0:02] talks about holding the head of
[0:04] Christ that head is the most important
[0:07] head that's the most important Authority
[0:09] more important than your pastor more
[0:11] important than your Apostle more
[0:13] important than your Prophet more
[0:15] important than your organization or your
[0:17] little denominational version of this
[0:19] message somebody ought to help me your
[0:23] head is Christ and if you've got a weak
[0:28] neck if your neck is weak you can't
[0:32] properly support
[0:35] cooperate Embrace Hold On To The Head
[0:40] the enemy wants to weaken your
[0:45] neck he wants to squeeze out your
[0:49] anointing he wants to weary you with the
[0:52] Yoke of Assyria and Egypt and
[0:56] Babylon but this was the word of the
[0:59] Lord the yoke Oh My People Israel the
[1:03] Yoke shall be lifted off of your neck
[1:07] and the Yoke will be broken because your
[1:13] neck has grown so
[1:16] fat that the Yoke that the enemy once
[1:19] used to drive you to control you to
[1:23] compel you will no longer be able to fit
[1:26] you anymore and the anointing in in your
[1:31] [Music]
[1:34] life don't we need the Holy Ghost
[1:37] baptism don't we need the Holy Ghost
[1:39] baptism don't we need the spirit of God
[1:42] in our midst don't we need a holy ghost
[1:48] service because that's what strengthens
[1:50] the neck the neck is what holds on and
[1:53] supports the head yes sir and God said
[1:56] I'm going to pour such anointing on your
[1:58] life that your neck will grow so fat
[2:01] that that old yoke that the enemy has
[2:03] used to control you will no longer be
[2:07] able to control you anymore because it's
[2:10] not just going to be
[2:11] broken God's trying to tell somebody
[2:13] here tonight I'm not just going to break
[2:16] the things so that the enemy can come
[2:17] along and glue it back together put it
[2:20] on your shoulder and control your life
[2:22] how many of you have ever been
[2:23] controlled by something have you ever
[2:25] been controlled by depression have you
[2:27] ever been controlled by gluttony have
[2:29] you ever been controlled by
[2:32] lust have you ever been controlled by
[2:34] nervousness depression oppression
[2:37] anxiety fear if you've ever been
[2:40] controlled by something you want out
[2:41] from under it and you don't ever want
[2:43] there to be any possibility or
[2:46] potential of that thing ever being used
[2:51] to control you to make you sub servant
[2:55] again God said that's what I want to do
[2:57] for my people I don't want to just break
[2:59] the Yol and let the devil come along and
[3:02] put it back on I want to send such an
[3:04] anointing such an experience such an
[3:08] encounter with the Holy Ghost that that
[3:11] yoke will be split destroyed annihilated
[3:15] in so many different little tiny
[3:17] insignificant pieces that the enemy will
[3:20] never be able to use it against you
[3:26] again
