[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope award
[1:00] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of the
[1:03] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:06] Station Alabama and I'm coming to you
[1:08] today on behalf of brother Eric Erickson
[1:11] and the entire staff of the gospel
[1:14] channel I'm so thankful to the Lord for
[1:18] the Ministry of the gospel channel and I
[1:21] know that many of you watching this
[1:23] program today are so blessed to be able
[1:26] to turn on the television and hear the
[1:30] gospel of Jesus Christ being spoken
[1:34] being announced we could say with power
[1:38] with anointing and with unction
[1:41] twenty-four hours a day and I want you
[1:44] to know that it's not possible without
[1:46] your gift without your partnership
[1:49] without your offerings and most
[1:53] importantly without your prayer I'm just
[1:56] going to invite you to partner with the
[1:58] gospel channel as a prayer warrior and
[2:01] as a giver as God lays it on your heart
[2:05] I don't mention that too much when we're
[2:07] together because I won't of course
[2:10] emphasize the word of God and the effect
[2:14] that the Word of God can have in your
[2:15] life but it would be a terrible thing if
[2:18] you came to your television set one day
[2:21] and you turned it on and there was no
[2:23] signal there was no gospel channel it
[2:26] would be a real shame and I believe that
[2:29] many of you would miss the gospel
[2:32] channel tremendously by the grace of God
[2:35] he is providing and he is making away
[2:39] but there are times in the year when
[2:42] things get really tough and so you know
[2:45] I'm I'm an outsider so to speak I don't
[2:48] work for the gospel channel but I feel
[2:51] like I'm partners with them and I feel
[2:53] like I'm part of the gospel channel
[2:56] family and so on behalf of my family I
[2:59] want to ask you to continue in prayer
[3:02] and to ask the Lord if he would have you
[3:06] to so financially into the ministry so
[3:09] that the true
[3:10] can continue to be broadcasted into your
[3:14] home not only to your home but even on
[3:18] your portable device you can go on the
[3:21] World Wide Web and you can stream the
[3:24] gospel channel well it's just a delight
[3:27] to be with you again
[3:28] today we have had a couple of sessions
[3:31] together already on the subject of
[3:34] schemes and devices and we use as a
[3:39] theme for our study so far the scripture
[3:43] in 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[3:46] 11 it says lest Satan should get an
[3:51] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[3:55] of his devices and I know that that many
[4:01] people really do not like the idea of
[4:05] studying darkness and that's not what
[4:08] we're going to do today we're not going
[4:10] to study darkness but what we are going
[4:13] to do is expose the enemy for who he
[4:17] really is it's the will of God that you
[4:20] and I as overcoming children of the king
[4:25] understand the schemes and the devices
[4:29] of our enemy if we are able to
[4:32] anticipate how the enemy is going to
[4:36] show up how he's going to move in a
[4:39] particular situation then we can move
[4:43] offensively
[4:44] instead of defensively we can move first
[4:47] we can be on the cutting edge before the
[4:51] enemy strikes the one thing that we know
[4:55] about our enemy is he only has one bag
[4:58] of tricks and he just keeps pulling them
[5:01] out and using them over and over again
[5:04] the characters vary the circumstances
[5:08] may vary a little bit but the enemy
[5:10] continues to operate in the same cycles
[5:14] the same schemes over and over again
[5:18] what if we can learn them what if we can
[5:21] learn our web
[5:22] to combat the enemy and what if we can
[5:26] learn to discern the next move that the
[5:30] enemy is about to make then by the grace
[5:32] of God we can rise up and cut him off at
[5:36] the pass
[5:37] lest at the scripture said lest he have
[5:40] an advantage over us we'd like to make
[5:43] sure that the enemy cannot take
[5:45] advantage of any of God's children I
[5:49] truly believe that the answers we seek
[5:53] are in the Word of God and as we closed
[5:56] our study together the last time we were
[5:59] reading in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11
[6:02] and verse 14 in the amplified version it
[6:05] says and it is no wonder for Satan
[6:09] himself masquerades as an angel of light
[6:14] I'm telling you that really exposes one
[6:19] of the most significant schemes of the
[6:22] enemy he always comes under cover he
[6:27] always comes in a masquerade you know I
[6:30] think we mentioned when we were together
[6:33] the last time if you're looking for the
[6:35] devil to come in a red suit and a band
[6:38] pitchfork and a pointed tail you're
[6:41] never gonna see the devil show up in
[6:43] your life in that kind of a costume he's
[6:48] going to masquerade himself all right
[6:50] he's going to come as an angel of light
[6:54] he's going to present something to you
[6:57] that is so shiny that is so beautiful
[7:01] that is so enticing that if you're not
[7:04] careful you will swallow what the enemy
[7:07] offers hook line and sinker before you
[7:11] even realize that it was the enemy who
[7:15] was peddling whatever this shiny promise
[7:18] was all about it was the enemy doing it
[7:21] and so one of the things we can remember
[7:24] is watch for the enemy to move against
[7:28] through deception it's his job you know
[7:32] the one thing about being deceived is
[7:34] you don't know you're deceived and
[7:36] that's something that the enemy
[7:39] certainly takes advantage over and I
[7:42] find that the enemy becomes particularly
[7:45] successful in the life of a Christian
[7:47] when we begin to fall into that place of
[7:50] indifference passivity and
[7:53] prayerlessness when we are not watchful
[7:57] in prayer the enemy certainly is able to
[8:00] take advantage our enemy the devil is
[8:04] defeated he is a defeated antagonist but
[8:08] he will not just lay down and play dead
[8:12] he knows that because of the declaration
[8:15] of our Lord on the cross it is finished
[8:17] that he cannot change or manipulate the
[8:21] plan of salvation he cannot steal the
[8:25] gift of God's love from your life but he
[8:28] wants to do everything that he can to
[8:31] paralyze you to hold you back from
[8:35] stepping into the fullness of who God
[8:37] created you to be our strength is in the
[8:41] Lord our strength is in the Word of God
[8:44] our strength is in the blood of Jesus
[8:48] Christ and we need to use that in our
[8:51] daily battles we can win every daily
[8:54] battle with our enemy by recognizing
[8:57] that in order to fight Satan we must
[9:00] find him in the realm of the Spirit and
[9:04] there's a scripture that we may look at
[9:07] even later in our study together but I
[9:09] think it would be good to look at it
[9:12] right now because we're describing the
[9:14] arena by which the enemy works his his
[9:19] deeds you know he works in the natural
[9:22] realm there's no doubt about it
[9:24] but he works from the spiritual realm he
[9:28] he sits in the spiritual realm and he
[9:32] operates through the physical realm by
[9:35] using the natural circumstances of our
[9:38] life he's not only the great
[9:41] xever but he definitely is the great
[9:44] manipulator here's a scripture that I
[9:47] think is really good to remember
[9:49] Ephesians 6:11 put on the whole armor of
[9:54] God that you may be able to stand
[9:58] against the wiles of the devil and
[10:01] here's what I want you to remember for
[10:04] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[10:07] see here the Apostle is is letting us
[10:11] know that when we respond when we fight
[10:15] against the enemy when we war against
[10:19] him through the blood of Jesus Christ we
[10:22] must not war in the natural realm we
[10:26] must war in prayer in praise and in
[10:30] intercession it's not by for instance
[10:34] the enemy will use someone that you love
[10:37] and so you're recognizing that this is
[10:41] not my loved one this is the enemy
[10:43] that's trying to use them but quite
[10:45] often we go to war with our loved one
[10:48] and without really remembering that the
[10:52] enemy is just taking advantage of our
[10:55] loved one listen the devil will use you
[10:58] he will use me if I'm yielded to him if
[11:02] I'm not prayerful if I'm not vigilant if
[11:05] I'm not watchful and aware the enemy
[11:08] will use whoever he can use but in order
[11:13] to defeat the enemy we can't go fighting
[11:16] our loved one we have to fight in the
[11:19] realm of the Spirit every daily battle
[11:22] with the enemy can be won if we learn
[11:26] that our victory comes by warring in the
[11:31] realm of the Spirit again how do we do
[11:33] that through prayer through praise and
[11:36] through intercession these are the ways
[11:39] that we can operate against the enemy
[11:44] from the realm of the Spirit and we need
[11:47] to let our loved ones off the hook you
[11:50] know if we recognize that the enemy is
[11:52] using them while we might war
[11:54] them in love but we're not going to be
[11:57] able to defeat the enemy by fighting
[12:00] against our loved one or against our
[12:03] neighbor or our co-worker or someone in
[12:06] the church whoever it is that we discern
[12:09] that the enemy is using this is not a
[12:11] battle of flesh and blood Ephesians 6:12
[12:15] but against principalities see that
[12:19] takes it in to the realm of spirit
[12:23] principalities against powers against
[12:27] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[12:31] against spiritual wickedness in high
[12:35] places none of these things are of the
[12:40] earth realm or the natural realm they
[12:42] manifest in the natural but their origin
[12:46] is in the realm of the Spirit sometimes
[12:50] we refer to that realm where the Prince
[12:52] of the power of the air rules as the
[12:56] second heaven listen again its
[12:58] principalities powers the rulers of the
[13:02] darkness of this world against spiritual
[13:05] wickedness in high places all of those
[13:09] descriptions of what we wore against and
[13:13] all of them in the realm of the Spirit
[13:17] verse 13 wherefore take unto you the
[13:20] whole armour of God that you may be able
[13:23] to withstand in the evil day and having
[13:26] done all to stand now we'll look at
[13:30] these verses of Scripture a little later
[13:32] in our studies together but I just felt
[13:35] like it was important for you to be able
[13:37] to understand what do we mean when we
[13:39] say you're able to overcome and to win
[13:42] your daily battles with the enemy by
[13:45] recognizing that in order to fight Satan
[13:47] we must fight him in the realm of the
[13:50] Spirit so I hope that helped you a
[13:51] little bit spiritual things the Bible
[13:54] said are spiritually discerned not
[13:57] figured out by human reasoning you know
[14:01] we we just do a quick analysis of what
[14:04] we feel what we see what we experience
[14:07] sometimes we fail to recognize wait a
[14:10] minute this is not just a conflict
[14:13] between coworkers this isn't just a
[14:16] little human striving in a family but
[14:20] there is a principality behind this
[14:22] there is a devil with an agenda behind
[14:25] this and you know that can strike fear
[14:28] in in the hearts of a folk it certainly
[14:32] can but it need not you need not be
[14:35] afraid because if you know that you have
[14:37] been washed in the blood of the Lamb
[14:41] sanctified by the washing of the water
[14:44] of the word and filled with the baptism
[14:47] of the Holy Ghost and fire you have
[14:50] every right that qualifies you to use
[14:55] every weapon that God has stored for us
[14:59] placed for us in his arsenal you just
[15:03] pull it down and use it when you need to
[15:07] understand that the enemy will sometimes
[15:09] use human reasoning to get us focused on
[15:13] one another and so we're going after one
[15:17] another we're we're gossiping you know
[15:19] about somebody and my there there there
[15:22] just this and that in the other and we
[15:24] get some big stir going and and we think
[15:27] that by telling it we're gonna we're
[15:29] going to alleviate the problem but but
[15:32] often if we could just discern a few
[15:34] moments you know a close down our mind a
[15:37] minute you know we get all these
[15:39] thoughts tossing and turning in our mind
[15:41] and just begin to think on the on the
[15:44] situation and see if the Lord will give
[15:47] you some discernment to help you
[15:49] understand hey wait a minute this isn't
[15:51] just people problems there is a devil
[15:54] behind this there is a demonic agenda
[15:58] behind what's going on between myself
[16:01] and that individual and if it is demonic
[16:05] then it originates in the realm of the
[16:07] spirit and so the battle the victory
[16:10] must be won in the realm of the Spirit
[16:13] if we win the battle through prayer and
[16:16] praise and intercession we can rest
[16:20] shirred that the victory will quickly
[16:23] manifest in the natural realm the earth
[16:27] realm where we live our lives spiritual
[16:30] things remember are spiritually
[16:33] discerned
[16:33] they're not reasoned out by human
[16:36] understanding and in order to recognize
[16:40] and remain alert to we must recognize we
[16:46] must learn to recognize and remain alert
[16:48] to cycles to patterns to paradigms in
[16:54] attacks from the enemy or what are these
[16:58] things these are ways and means that the
[17:03] enemy uses to war against your life and
[17:08] what he does often is he keeps as we
[17:11] mentioned earlier he keeps pushing
[17:13] against us pushing against us pushing
[17:16] against us and every one of those
[17:19] attacks has a root there's a root behind
[17:23] it there's a cause behind it the enemy
[17:26] has found access to your life he's found
[17:31] a way to distract you from serving the
[17:35] Lord with peace you know that's really
[17:38] what the thief is out to do to disturb
[17:40] your peace when we when we greet one
[17:45] another from the Hebrew language we
[17:47] greet one another Shalom and Shalom is
[17:51] peace but it's it's also a question how
[17:55] is your peace how is your peace and you
[17:59] would answer Shalom Shalom my peace is
[18:03] full my peace is complete and I want you
[18:07] to know the only way that we could truly
[18:09] answer the question how is your peace
[18:12] how is your rest the only way that we
[18:15] could really answer that it's complete
[18:17] it's perfect it's finished is by knowing
[18:22] who we serve by knowing what this is
[18:27] living on the inside of our spirit man
[18:31] the life of Jesus Christ and I'm telling
[18:35] you when the life of Jesus Christ is
[18:37] living in you and manifesting through
[18:41] you you have peace oh yes there will be
[18:45] a tax or yes there will be on sloths of
[18:48] the enemy against your life but if you
[18:51] pause and discern there's a route behind
[18:54] this and I need to find that route and
[18:58] cut it off in the authority of Jesus
[19:02] Christ so we're watching spiritually
[19:05] we're Watchmen on the wall we must be
[19:08] alert to how the enemy moves and
[19:11] operates against us we're watching four
[19:15] cycles you know a cycle is it gives us
[19:19] the idea of something circular it has a
[19:22] beginning point and it continues forward
[19:26] on on on on and it's it rotates right
[19:30] back to where it begins and in most of
[19:33] the time what happened it starts right
[19:34] over and I've watched the enemy create
[19:38] cycles in my own life in areas maybe of
[19:42] anxiety or depression all of which
[19:47] originate from the same spot from the
[19:49] same place usually a thought process
[19:53] that opens up in my mind one that I have
[19:57] many many many times
[19:59] defeated absolutely ripped it down in
[20:04] the authority of Jesus Christ but that
[20:06] doesn't mean that the enemy will never
[20:08] use that again he'll pick it up
[20:11] he'll dust off his weapons he'll come
[20:13] right back his bag of tricks he'll loose
[20:16] them against you again starting in the
[20:18] same place the same thought process and
[20:21] that will cycle all the way around and
[20:24] many of us could look back over our
[20:26] lives I've even heard people who became
[20:28] very aware and very discerning of how
[20:31] the enemy has operated against them and
[20:34] they've even recognized cycles of three
[20:37] years our cycles of five years our
[20:40] cycles of seven years when the enemy
[20:43] comes back
[20:44] around with the same lies with the same
[20:46] tricks if we can recognize that we have
[20:50] authority by Jesus Christ to cut off
[20:53] that cycle so that the enemy cannot use
[20:56] it again the Bible said that because of
[20:59] the anointing the yoke is destroyed not
[21:05] just broken but destroyed the anointing
[21:09] of God in your life has the power to
[21:13] destroy the yoke that the enemy would
[21:16] like to place on your shoulder and what
[21:19] is the purpose of a yoke - to control
[21:22] you the enemy likes to place a yoke on
[21:26] our shoulder so that he can turn us in
[21:30] whatever direction he desires to turn us
[21:33] and how does he do that usually through
[21:36] our emotions but because of the
[21:40] anointing the yoke is destroyed if you
[21:44] can recognize that it's the enemy
[21:47] putting this heavy burden on you and not
[21:49] the Lord and you can claim lay hold of
[21:52] in faith the anointing that's working in
[21:55] your life by the Holy Ghost you can see
[21:59] that yoke not only broken but destroyed
[22:03] blown to smithereens if you will in so
[22:07] many timing little pieces and fragments
[22:10] that the enemy will not ever be able to
[22:13] glue it back together and use it against
[22:15] you again hallelujah that's the victory
[22:18] that Jesus is making available to us if
[22:22] we'll surrender our will and live the
[22:26] God life the life of Jesus Christ so
[22:29] we've got to remain alert we need to
[22:32] watch for cycles for patterns and even
[22:35] paradigms which we'll talk about another
[22:37] time so it's very important to remember
[22:41] that the victory that we win in each of
[22:44] those situations is a victory that must
[22:47] be maintained it's not one time and
[22:50] never again often because the enemy will
[22:52] just come back and and change if you
[22:55] detail
[22:56] he'll just change a few circumstances
[22:59] that the actors in the drama will be
[23:02] changed up a little bit the tone of
[23:04] something will be a little different and
[23:06] he'll try the very same old thing
[23:08] against you so if God gives you not if
[23:12] when you claim the victory that God has
[23:15] given you in your life you've got to
[23:17] maintain that victory and again how do
[23:19] we do that by the end first of all where
[23:22] do we do that we do that in the realm of
[23:25] the spirit now how do we get into the
[23:28] realm of the Spirit we get into the
[23:31] realm of the Spirit through prayer
[23:33] through praise through intercession so
[23:36] it's not only is prayer and praise and
[23:40] intercession and meditating on the Word
[23:42] of God etc not only are these weapons
[23:45] that we can use to stay alert against
[23:48] our enemy but they're also doorways that
[23:51] we can use to move into the realm of the
[23:54] Spirit where the battle is won and where
[23:58] the victory is maintained thank God it
[24:02] is possible how because Jesus is the
[24:05] victor he is the victor he has defeated
[24:11] the enemy on our behalf and it is now
[24:15] our responsibility to appropriate and to
[24:19] maintain that victory he's done it the
[24:23] work is done the battle is won so to
[24:27] speak but it is our responsibility to
[24:31] appropriate that victory and to maintain
[24:34] that victory and we do that by entering
[24:38] as often as possible into the spirit
[24:42] realm where we're living out of the
[24:45] inner man instead of reacting from the
[24:49] outer man or from the mind the will and
[24:52] the emotions now I want to talk to you
[24:56] for just a minute about strongholds
[24:58] because the Bible talks to us about
[25:02] strongholds in our life we know what a
[25:06] stronghold is
[25:08] in in the natural a stronghold that word
[25:11] is translated as a castle or a fortress
[25:15] and also it's translated as anything on
[25:20] which one relies or depends on so it is
[25:26] a fortified place that Satan can use to
[25:30] exalt himself in your life I like to say
[25:34] it this way a stronghold is any argument
[25:37] that sets itself up against the
[25:41] knowledge of God but God has given us
[25:44] victory over every stronghold over every
[25:48] fortress that the enemy would raise up
[25:51] the word stronghold is derived from the
[25:55] greek word echo and one of the meanings
[25:59] of echo is to have possession of the
[26:02] mind and the emotions let me tell you
[26:06] something that's what Satan desires he
[26:11] desires to be able to manipulate your
[26:14] mind and your emotions and many many
[26:18] times he doesn't have much of a vowel
[26:20] because we just surrender that authority
[26:23] to him very very quickly you see a mind
[26:27] that is stayed on the Lord he will keep
[26:31] those in perfect peace whose mind is
[26:35] stayed on the Lord we could say you will
[26:39] walk in Shalom Shalom if your mind is
[26:43] fixed on the Lord in the same way that
[26:47] you know how to to dial your channel you
[26:50] know exactly how to pick up this signal
[26:53] either by your Sky box or by satellite
[26:57] you know exactly how to dial it in it's
[27:00] not an automatic thing you know what
[27:03] number to look for and what numbers to
[27:05] turn past to get to the number you're
[27:08] looking for it's deliberate in other
[27:10] words and so is this grace of setting
[27:14] our mind on the things of the Lord oh
[27:18] let me tell you in this hour that we're
[27:21] live
[27:21] in the devil house he has voices
[27:24] everywhere and tons of distractions life
[27:28] is like a big carnival with everybody
[27:30] barking come over this way and let me
[27:33] sell you this and come over that over
[27:35] here and let me let me offer you a deal
[27:37] you can't refuse and this is how it gets
[27:40] some time even even spiritually the
[27:43] enemy's trying to lure us away after
[27:46] some craziness pull our attention away
[27:49] get us caught up in politics and get us
[27:52] caught up in all kinds of issues that
[27:55] are distracting really to the child of
[28:00] God especially if we're looking to
[28:02] maintain victory so it's important that
[28:05] you and I take possession of our mind
[28:10] and our emotions and we do that by
[28:13] putting on the mind of Jesus Christ by
[28:17] taking his mind
[28:19] we are exalting him as Lord and as
[28:24] Victor and giving him the the position
[28:28] of being able to to steer to move in our
[28:33] will in our mind and in our emotions let
[28:37] me tell you something when your enemy
[28:39] takes possession of your mind by giving
[28:42] you lying thoughts that you embrace that
[28:45] you receive I believe every lie that the
[28:48] enemy whispers in your ear
[28:49] needs to be rejected every one of them
[28:52] every one of them when he tells you
[28:55] you're ugly you're unattractive you'll
[28:56] never have a companion you need to tell
[28:59] the devil that he is a liar that God
[29:01] doesn't make junk that God knows exactly
[29:04] what he's doing in your life and and if
[29:08] indeed you're a candidate to have
[29:10] someone he has the right person set
[29:14] aside for you or he tells you you're a
[29:16] failure or you're so unworthy that you
[29:19] could never really be a child of God I
[29:22] don't know what the enemy is telling you
[29:24] but I know he won't stop until you stop
[29:28] him I know that he won't quit until you
[29:31] force his hand and the only way that we
[29:33] can do that
[29:34] get in that place in the spirit not in
[29:38] the natural not not trying to fight this
[29:41] thing with flesh and blood but enter in
[29:44] with prayer enter in with praise and
[29:46] worship let God direct your prayer with
[29:49] intercession let him give you strategy
[29:52] I'm telling you God if you tuned in to
[29:55] that spirit realm you may find the
[29:57] Lord's voice telling you to do something
[29:59] he may give you leadership he's not
[30:03] going to lead you to do anything that's
[30:06] against his word I can assure you of
[30:09] that right now
[30:10] the only thing that God is bound by is
[30:13] by his word if he has spoken it to us if
[30:17] he has declared his word to us he's not
[30:20] going to deviate he's not going to vary
[30:23] there from that word not even one little
[30:27] tiny jot or tittle or IO de he's gonna
[30:31] stay right on that word so if you feel
[30:33] like you're being instructed to do
[30:35] something against the Word of God it's
[30:37] not God talking to you you need to be
[30:40] able to discern the difference in the
[30:42] voice that is not God if it's telling
[30:46] you to do something against the word but
[30:49] he may give you some strategy he may
[30:52] tell you to do something you know I
[30:54] remember years ago when when I was
[30:58] pastoring a church in another state as
[31:01] really a young man barely barely a young
[31:05] man you know just an older teenager
[31:07] really but but moving toward 20 19 20
[31:12] years old something like that and my
[31:15] mother who was really raised me as a
[31:20] single parent
[31:21] my parents were married but they
[31:24] divorced when I was five years old and
[31:27] so my mother raised me as a single
[31:29] parent and now God had moved me from my
[31:33] home to another state and he had given
[31:36] me instructions of what I was to do in
[31:39] that area and oh it was a little bit
[31:42] lonely I didn't know a lot of people in
[31:44] that area
[31:45] I was making it by the grace of God but
[31:49] in reality my mother was very lonely and
[31:52] she missed me being around and so she
[31:55] decided that that she would like to move
[31:58] to the place that I was living the state
[32:01] that I was living in but she'd been
[32:02] working for quite a few years at the
[32:05] bank and it looked impossible it didn't
[32:07] look like there was any way in the world
[32:09] that she could start over in a new place
[32:12] but you know we began to pray and there
[32:15] was a one branch of the bank that my
[32:17] mother was working for at the time in
[32:20] the city where God had moved me and one
[32:22] day I had been in prayer and the Lord
[32:25] spoke to me now you may just turn off
[32:28] the television and you may say that's a
[32:31] nutcase preacher but I'm gonna tell you
[32:34] the Lord spoke into my spirit and I can
[32:38] say that with boldness even as crazy as
[32:41] it sounds to some people because I know
[32:43] there are people watching this program
[32:45] that understand what it means to discern
[32:48] that in internal voice of God the
[32:53] leadership of the Spirit of God and he
[32:56] told me that I should anoint a rock I
[33:00] said oh my what is this you know what
[33:04] kind of leadership is this that I should
[33:06] pray over a rock and anoint it with oil
[33:08] and that I should go up and take it to
[33:11] the to the branch of the bank in my new
[33:14] city where I was living and put that in
[33:17] the in the on the property somewhere and
[33:21] do it as a memorial that I believed that
[33:25] God could open the door for my mother to
[33:28] have a job at that Bank even though her
[33:31] initial inquiries had made it sound like
[33:34] an impossible transfer I said alright
[33:37] Lord hope nobody sees me but I'll do
[33:41] exactly what you have put in my heart I
[33:43] know that it's you because there's
[33:46] nothing in me that would have ever
[33:48] thought about doing something like that
[33:50] so I took that rock I I poured oil over
[33:54] that rock
[33:55] I prayed over that rock and I said Lord
[33:58] let this rock be a symbol of my faith
[34:01] that I know that you're a God of the
[34:04] possible with men things are impossible
[34:08] but with you all things are possible let
[34:12] this rock be a testimony that I Steven
[34:16] Shelley believe that even though the
[34:19] enemy has sealed up the doors and every
[34:23] person she has spoken to said it's not
[34:26] going to happen I believe that you oh
[34:29] god you are going to open the door for
[34:33] my mother to transfer to this bank and
[34:36] not only that let it be a testimony that
[34:39] I believe it's going to be in the next
[34:42] 30 days now when I said that 30 days I
[34:45] didn't hear that in in my inner voice
[34:48] the inner voice of the Lord speaking to
[34:51] me my faith said that I believe the Lord
[34:54] told me to take the rock to a North Iraq
[34:56] where to put the rock and I believe that
[35:00] he inspired me to call it a memorial of
[35:02] my faith but when I said and and let it
[35:06] be known it will happen in the next 30
[35:09] days it shocked me that was my faith
[35:12] talking and so I decided the best way to
[35:17] get that job done was to do it and then
[35:20] tell some good Holy Ghost fill people
[35:22] what I had done that's a little bit of
[35:24] accountability and so I I'll never
[35:27] forget it I drove up to the bank and I
[35:30] and I got out and I had it in my pocket
[35:32] and I I walked around back and forth
[35:35] it's a wonder they hadn't arrested me
[35:37] for loitering but I found just the right
[35:40] spot in the front of the bank under some
[35:43] shrubbery in the landscape and some pine
[35:46] straw up against there and I thought if
[35:49] I put it under here it'll stay here no
[35:51] one will think it's there by mistake
[35:53] they won't see it I'll fix it just good
[35:55] so I walked over kind of you know
[35:57] casually whistling or something and and
[36:00] placed it in there and I felt I can tell
[36:03] you this I know it must sound silly
[36:06] some of you but I could feel the
[36:08] presence of the Lord I could feel the
[36:10] presence of the Lord
[36:11] confirming to me you know it's like God
[36:14] saying that's right that's right son
[36:17] you'd be obedient because he had given
[36:20] me this strategy in the realm of the
[36:22] Spirit and so I did it and I'm telling
[36:26] you I've got to make a long story short
[36:27] but I want you to know it was not only
[36:30] less than 30 days it was less than 5
[36:33] days it was about 3 days that a phone
[36:37] call came and the answer was we are
[36:41] going to change this rule we're going to
[36:45] make you the exception to the rule we're
[36:48] going to let you transfer even though
[36:51] they had told her there's nothing to
[36:53] wait to hear it's done the decisions
[36:55] made now all of a sudden without her
[36:57] ever calling back she gets the phone
[37:00] call and they said not only that we were
[37:03] going to break another rule we're going
[37:05] to let you transfer at your same level
[37:07] at your same position at your same
[37:10] salary and there's some training that
[37:13] needs to be done when you get there and
[37:15] we're gonna give you a bonus for helping
[37:18] take some of this understanding of the
[37:21] equipment and the software to the bank
[37:23] there they've not had anybody to help
[37:25] them and so we're going to give you a
[37:27] bonus for helping for being able to help
[37:30] and train because of the knowledge that
[37:32] you have in less than 30 days everything
[37:36] was settled the moving truck had already
[37:38] come and in less than 30 days my mother
[37:41] was living in the same city that I was
[37:43] living so sometimes we enter in in
[37:47] prayer we enter in in praise we enter in
[37:50] intercession and sometimes God drops a
[37:53] little strategy he drops I hope for you
[37:56] it won't be as as what would some people
[38:00] would think silly I hope it'll be
[38:02] something you know that that sounds
[38:04] better that looks better feels more
[38:07] important for you but God knew me he
[38:10] knew what it would take he knew that
[38:12] that was going to stretch me a little
[38:14] bit and what if I told you that I have
[38:17] used that strategy more than one time in
[38:20] faith just in faith it's not in the
[38:23] Bible the Bible didn't save you an honor
[38:25] and go and stand and make a testimony
[38:27] although God is a God of memorial and
[38:30] he's a God of remembrance but he didn't
[38:33] say I'll do this and that but you know
[38:35] what I have heard that unction that
[38:38] inspiration and I have moved in faith
[38:41] more than one time and I have seen God
[38:44] work let me give you this example the
[38:47] Bible says that God is Jehovah Rapha he
[38:50] is the healer the Bible says in Isaiah
[38:53] that he was wounded for our
[38:55] transgressions he was bruised for our
[38:58] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[39:01] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[39:05] healed that is the promise of the word
[39:08] of God but in the New Testament it says
[39:11] are there any sick if so let them call
[39:16] for the elders of the church to come and
[39:19] anoint with oil and pray over them and
[39:22] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[39:24] and if they've done any sins they'll be
[39:27] forgiven that's a New Testament promise
[39:29] if healing is already provided in the
[39:33] atonement why is it necessary to call
[39:36] the elders why is it necessary to lay
[39:39] hands on them why is it necessary to
[39:42] anoint them with oil this is because God
[39:45] is asking us to demonstrate our faith if
[39:49] you really believe I am Jehovah Rapha if
[39:52] you really believe I am the Lord God
[39:54] that heals all of your diseases this is
[39:58] the method by which you can access in
[40:01] faith that promise of healing called the
[40:04] elders of the church and so that's why
[40:06] we invite people call the prayer line
[40:09] call and leave a message if it's not
[40:12] during our open business hours so to
[40:15] speak then leave the message of what you
[40:18] need us to pray about if you don't mind
[40:21] give us your name and your location you
[40:24] don't have to give us any more personal
[40:26] information than that and tell us what
[40:28] your need is
[40:29] or send us an email because in doing so
[40:32] it's a little different than if you're
[40:34] in a local church of course you're going
[40:36] to do that but we hear from people all
[40:39] the time who don't have a local church
[40:41] family and so today by calling in your
[40:45] prayer requests you're doing what the
[40:46] scripture said call for the elders of
[40:48] the church and if we were there we would
[40:51] be more than happy to anoint you with
[40:54] oil but I believe that that act of faith
[40:57] calling on the elders is a way of
[41:00] accessing the promise so many times even
[41:04] though the victory is ours
[41:06] God leads us or instructs us to move in
[41:10] something that will demonstrate our
[41:13] faith to demonstrate that we believe
[41:17] that God is indeed a rewarder of those
[41:22] who diligently seek Him if there is a
[41:25] stronghold in your life a place that the
[41:29] enemy has used against you a situation
[41:33] that the enemy has used against you over
[41:37] and over and over and every time he does
[41:39] he's successful it continues to be an
[41:44] issue then I could almost without a
[41:48] doubt I can say that is a stronghold and
[41:51] God wants to give you victory and
[41:54] deliverance of every stronghold in your
[41:57] life I tell you that these weapons that
[42:00] God has have give has given us our
[42:02] mighty through God to the pulling down
[42:06] of every stronghold any place where we
[42:12] have allowed Satan to reign in our mind
[42:15] to control our thoughts can be
[42:20] considered a stronghold and like all
[42:23] other spiritual battles a stronghold is
[42:25] not pulled down by carnal methods it's
[42:30] only pulled down by spiritual weapons
[42:33] and in the realm of the spirit I'll tell
[42:37] you let me give you an example of a
[42:39] stronghold that the enemy is using on a
[42:42] lot of people
[42:43] in the body of Christ today it's in
[42:46] proverbs chapter 13 and verse 12 and it
[42:51] says Hope deferred makes the heart sick
[42:57] Hope deferred makes the heart sick that
[43:03] word sick if you look at it it means to
[43:09] have an unstable mind Hope deferred
[43:12] makes the mind unstable when you look at
[43:18] that word deferred Hope deferred here it
[43:22] does not simply mean delayed now what we
[43:26] often take the scripture to mean is that
[43:30] when we pray and we pray and we pray and
[43:34] we don't see the answer immediately to
[43:38] our prayer and we pray and we pray
[43:41] sometimes we pray for years
[43:43] without seeing the real fruition or
[43:48] fulfillment of what we've been believing
[43:51] God for and we do it for many years with
[43:56] faith standing on the word standing on
[43:58] the promise believing God but if the
[44:00] enemy can move in and start reminding
[44:03] you heal heal start chanting in your ear
[44:05] well do you think God's ever gonna
[44:08] answer your prayer you think God really
[44:12] loves you haven't you prayed yes and
[44:17] this an unselfish request where is God
[44:20] now aren't you tired of saying the same
[44:24] silly prayer over and over again with no
[44:26] results I'm telling you he'll lie he
[44:30] will he will come with every kind of
[44:33] creative thought to discourage you from
[44:37] prayer to make you feel like God's
[44:40] forgotten God is forsaken
[44:43] there's this delay it's more than I can
[44:46] stand but this word deferred here
[44:49] doesn't just mean delayed a promise that
[44:53] has been delayed or an answer to prayer
[44:56] has been delayed it actually translates
[45:00] seized hope that has been seized a
[45:07] promise an answer to prayer that has
[45:11] been seized
[45:13] which means violently taken ahold of
[45:17] doesn't that sound like the enemy didn't
[45:21] that sound like the original
[45:23] kleptomaniac the thief cometh not but
[45:26] for to steal to kill and to destroy it
[45:31] is his great desire to silently seize
[45:37] all hope in your life it is the enemy's
[45:42] desire to violently lay hold on every
[45:46] promise that God has ever made to you
[45:50] through his word it is the enemy's
[45:53] desire to paralyze your faith and your
[45:57] hope so that you give up and you operate
[46:01] in Hope deferred which leads to an
[46:04] unstable mind too unstable
[46:07] thinking this scripture tells me that
[46:11] the enemy is not just simply planning a
[46:14] delay
[46:15] he doesn't just simply want to delay a
[46:17] promise but he desires to steal to seize
[46:21] the promise he's after every promise in
[46:25] your life every dream every breakthrough
[46:29] that you've been crying out to God for
[46:31] he comes to steal and to kill and to
[46:35] destroy
[46:36] if Satan can seize and steal your hope
[46:39] he builds a structure of death over your
[46:43] life and then he howls in your in your
[46:46] in your ear he howls in your inner man
[46:50] and and listen he'll try to convince you
[46:53] there is no God
[46:55] not only is there no answer coming to
[46:58] your prayer there is no God I want you
[47:01] to know he doesn't just tell people
[47:03] outside the church those lies in fact
[47:05] he's more actively telling people who
[47:08] believe in God he
[47:10] more actively fighting against the
[47:12] believer seizing our dreams our hopes
[47:15] our promises reminding us of words and
[47:19] death structures that have been spoken
[47:21] over our lives even from childhood maybe
[47:25] someone has spoken over us you'll never
[47:27] amount to anything
[47:29] you'll never be anything you're just a
[47:32] failure you're just a loser well I want
[47:34] you to know that that through the power
[47:37] of Jesus Christ by recognizing the
[47:41] schemes and devices of our enemy by
[47:44] utilizing the weapons that God has given
[47:48] us in this holy spirit arsenal we can
[47:51] defeat the thief we can stop the enemy
[47:55] in his tracks and we can hold on to our
[47:57] promises hallelujah I'm feeling excited
[48:00] we can hold onto our hope we can let our
[48:04] faith be strengthened and be strong and
[48:07] instead of running from the promise we
[48:10] can we can run the devil out instead of
[48:13] you and I throwing our hope away and
[48:15] throwing our promise away and running
[48:18] back and hiding somewhere we can strike
[48:21] fear in the enemy and let him know
[48:24] greater is He that is in me than he that
[48:28] is in the world he doesn't listen the
[48:30] devil doesn't want you to have a vision
[48:32] of Hope he doesn't want you to believe
[48:35] that God cares about the personal
[48:38] details of your life he'll try to
[48:41] convince you if he can't convince you
[48:43] there is no God he'll try to convince
[48:45] you that God's too busy to care about
[48:47] you he's a liar and the father of all
[48:51] lies he wants to build structures of
[48:54] death over your life by stealing your
[48:56] vision by killing your dreams by taking
[49:00] your hope from you these structures are
[49:03] not only built over individual lives but
[49:06] I've watched the enemy build death
[49:08] structures over entire communities over
[49:13] entire congregations over entire
[49:17] families convincing everyone
[49:20] who's a part of that community that
[49:22] family that church group convincing them
[49:28] that they're never going to see the
[49:31] breakthrough that God has promised well
[49:33] I want you to know somebody's got to
[49:35] stop the enemy somebody has got to be
[49:38] aware of how he operates and somebody
[49:41] has got to rise up in the name of the
[49:44] Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah and
[49:47] stand on the promises of God we must do
[49:52] that because those death structures are
[49:55] holding back the harvest those death
[49:59] structures that the enemy likes to build
[50:02] those strongholds those castles that he
[50:05] likes to raise up as fortresses that
[50:08] seem almost impenetrable you you can't
[50:14] penetrate them you can't break them down
[50:17] but I want you to know you can if you
[50:20] come into agreement with God's Word you
[50:23] can't do it your way you can't do it
[50:25] with human reasoning or carnal ideas but
[50:29] in the realm of the Spirit God can show
[50:31] you the route of how this death
[50:34] structure has been built over your life
[50:37] over your finances over your health over
[50:42] your church community it can go over
[50:45] your business it I tell you when the
[50:49] enemy is successful in building that
[50:51] thing it's death to your vision its
[50:54] death to your success its death to your
[50:57] hope its death to your faith but I'm
[51:00] telling you Jesus he did something to
[51:03] death didn't he he conquered death in
[51:06] every shape in every form in every
[51:09] fashion in any way that death desires to
[51:12] operate in you Jesus paid the victory to
[51:17] conquer the enemy and including the
[51:21] enemy of death whatever is not releasing
[51:24] life in you must be recognized as
[51:28] possibly releasing death and so we
[51:31] called it a death structure it's
[51:33] is that the enemy keeps using and you
[51:36] keep believing it's situations that the
[51:39] enemy keeps setting up in your life and
[51:42] instead of being able to finally
[51:44] recognize this as the enemy and doing
[51:46] something about it
[51:47] we just kind of you know fall into the
[51:50] same trap over and over again into the
[51:53] same addiction over and over again
[51:54] because he comes to steal he comes to
[51:58] kill he comes to destroy let me read you
[52:02] in the time that we have left
[52:03] let me read Romans chapter seven verse
[52:06] five if you will when we were living in
[52:09] the flesh our mere physical lives this
[52:13] must be in the amplified the sinful
[52:17] passions that awakened that were
[52:20] awakened and aroused up by what the law
[52:24] makes sin were constantly operating in
[52:28] our natural powers in our bodily organs
[52:31] in the sensitive appetites and wills of
[52:34] the flesh so that we bore fruit for
[52:39] death the enemy wants us bearing bearing
[52:43] death fruit instead Jesus wants us to be
[52:48] bearing life fruit and not only living
[52:53] fruit but the living fruit of the Spirit
[52:57] the life of Jesus Christ when we're
[53:00] caught up in our own passions in our own
[53:04] physical lives you know we're just
[53:06] completely focused on on bills or human
[53:11] relationships and and you know what's
[53:15] going on on the job and what's happening
[53:17] with the mortgage sure we have to
[53:20] definitely we have to take care of these
[53:22] things we have to give them some of our
[53:25] attention of course we do but the enemy
[53:27] wants us to get so caught up in those
[53:29] things that we have no time to develop
[53:32] the spiritual man the inner man listen
[53:35] Jesus Christ longs to have fellowship
[53:39] with you he longs to have relationship
[53:44] with you so that you
[53:45] can produce fruit of spirit fruit of
[53:48] life and not death I want to pray with
[53:51] you right now father
[53:53] I thank you for this opportunity that
[53:55] you have given me today to speak words
[53:58] of truth some of it may not have been
[54:01] easy to hear some of it may be new
[54:04] material for someone watching the
[54:06] program may be coming from a background
[54:09] that that has not dealt with some of
[54:11] these schemes and cycles of the enemy
[54:14] but yet I believe that there are those
[54:16] watching this program right now whose
[54:18] hearts have been somewhat awakened by
[54:21] what they have heard today and they're
[54:23] beginning to understand they're
[54:26] beginning to see how the enemy builds
[54:29] these structures and strongholds and
[54:31] fortresses of death over our life I pray
[54:34] that they will also understand the
[54:37] victory that you have given us and the
[54:40] weapons that you have given us to defeat
[54:42] the enemy so I come against in the
[54:44] authority of Jesus Christ strongholds
[54:47] and death structures in the lives of
[54:50] believers I thank you Lord that you said
[54:54] in your word we shall know the truth and
[54:56] the truth shall make us free I'm asking
[54:59] that by the truth going out today by the
[55:02] enemy being exposed today through the
[55:06] Word of God I'm praying and believing
[55:08] that this truth will penetrate the
[55:11] darkness in somebody's life right now
[55:14] that you Oh God will give them strength
[55:17] to pull the loose thread and to begin to
[55:20] unravel what the enemy has been using
[55:24] against them Lord I want us to be able
[55:28] to recognize that the enemy comes to
[55:31] steal our hope to seize our dreams to
[55:34] take and hijack our promises but Lord
[55:37] would you give grace right now to every
[55:39] viewer would you release anointing to
[55:42] every viewer right now who comes to you
[55:45] in faith believing I know they're
[55:47] skeptics that we'll watch
[55:48] I know there are unbelievers also who
[55:51] will watch but Lord to those who can
[55:53] believe
[55:54] your word to those who can take you at
[55:56] your word I asked today that you will
[55:59] activate this word that they have heard
[56:02] today and that you will use it to
[56:05] execute victory and deliverance over
[56:08] death structure and stronghold and
[56:11] paradigms that the enemy has used to
[56:14] keep them back
[56:15] I say freedom in the name of the Lord
[56:18] Jesus Christ I declare that Jesus is the
[56:23] victor in my life and I announce him to
[56:26] be the victor in your life Lord we ask
[56:29] you to come and confirm your word in the
[56:33] lives of those watching this program
[56:36] right now and we ask it in the mighty
[56:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[56:44] Messiah a man and the saints of God
[56:49] around the world said a man he is your
[56:53] victor he didn't just come to give me
[56:56] the victory he came also that you might
[56:59] have the victory all believe on him put
[57:03] your faith and confidence in him today
[57:06] determine to search the scripture and
[57:10] let the Spirit of God awaken you to the
[57:14] truth of the enemy's schemes and devices
[57:19] and may God give you grace to raise up
[57:22] every weapon that the Lord Jesus has
[57:25] made available for you and I to win this
[57:28] battle pray for the gospel channel that
[57:32] God will prosper them and expand them
[57:36] and pray for new hope revival ministries
[57:40] as well thank you for your attention
[57:42] thank you for letting us share with you
[57:45] what God is placed so deeply in our
[57:47] hearts and though we may not know all of
[57:50] you we may have never seen you in the
[57:53] natural I can say and mean it from the
[57:56] bottom of my heart I love you because
[57:58] you are desiring the things of God and
[58:01] that makes us brothers and sisters
[58:04] in Christ god bless you bye bye for now
