[0:05] [Music]
[0:08] listen the blood of all the Bulls and
[0:10] the Lambs and the goats and and the
[0:12] turtle does and everything else all it
[0:14] could ever do was cover
[0:18] sin and if you remove that blood the sin
[0:22] the same sin the sin that was always
[0:24] there would have been there all
[0:27] along and so what did they have to do
[0:29] they had to come back the next time and
[0:31] bring another offering more
[0:35] blood but every drop of that blood that
[0:38] was spilled was
[0:41] prophesying every time the lamb lost his
[0:43] life every time a goat lost his life
[0:46] every time a turtle Dove's neck was rung
[0:49] and the blood drained out of his body
[0:51] every drop of blood prophesied there's
[0:54] coming a seed there's coming a seed
[0:56] there's coming a seed there's coming a
[0:58] seed there is a blood there is a blood
[1:01] there is a blood this blood will do for
[1:04] now but there is a blood that's
[1:07] coming Hallelujah and when that blood
[1:09] gets here it will not just cover man's
[1:12] sin like a blanket on top but it will so
[1:16] remove as a propitiation for sin it will
[1:19] so remove even the blot even the stain
[1:23] of
[1:24] unrighteousness and because of that
[1:26] blood mankind will be infused with a
[1:29] right ousness of God that he could never
[1:32] attain even if he kept all the works of
[1:35] the law even if he obeyed every
[1:37] commandment in the book of the law he
[1:40] could never be as righteous as he will
[1:42] be when that blood does its
[1:46] job and I want you to know if you came
[1:49] to those Grace Junctions those truth
[1:52] Junctions in your life you didn't come
[1:55] there one minute
[1:58] late
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] now if God would have had a rather he
[2:03] might would have rather you come earlier
[2:05] but he knew all along when you would
[2:08] finally see that and if God knew from
[2:11] the beginning when you would see that
[2:13] truth or see this truth or the other
[2:15] truth make another step in the right
[2:17] direction if God already knew that how
[2:19] could you be late to the
[2:21] party you got there right on time and
[2:26] that means that even though there was
[2:28] things that you did and believe and and
[2:30] participated in that were not right that
[2:33] were not the best for you they were only
[2:36] types and shadows and and and pieces of
[2:38] Truth all of that you have no guilt
[2:42] before God today somebody should hear me
[2:44] you have no condemnation before God
[2:47] today because if you have found the
[2:50] blood if the blood has found
[2:53] you Hallelujah then all the Wasted Years
[2:57] and all of the mistakes in the journey
[3:00] and any lie that you might have believed
[3:02] and any Twisted truth that you might
[3:04] have embraced and any outward form of
[3:07] righteousness that you might have
[3:08] trusted in instead of the inward work of
[3:11] Grace God knew
[3:14] it and he wants me to tell you it was
[3:17] all
[3:19] right God is not going to say you sorry
[3:22] man how why did it take you so long I've
[3:25] been standing here at this junk waiting
[3:27] on you you drugg your feet you had so
[3:29] much pride that would have been the
[3:31] truth but he's not going to meet me with
[3:33] that he's just going to say I'm so glad
[3:37] you have
[3:40] arrived how do you know that I know that
[3:43] because my sins are not just
[3:47] covered my sins are
[3:51] taken separated as far from me as the
[3:55] East is from the
[3:58] West
