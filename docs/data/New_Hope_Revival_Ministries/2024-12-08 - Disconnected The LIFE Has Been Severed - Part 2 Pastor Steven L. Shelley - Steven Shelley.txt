========================================

Description:
“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” John 15:7

Pastor Shelley speaks about staying connected to Christ using John 15’s vine analogy. He emphasizes that any disconnection from God comes from us, not Him. The sermon focuses on overcoming spiritual battles by confessing sins, rejecting the devil’s legal rights through unconfessed sin, and making faith declarations based on God’s Word. He encourages believers to “write spiritual checks” based on God’s promises and stay connected to the divine life source regardless of feelings or circumstances.

served us so well what a sacrifice they make for the kingdom of God may God reward them and bless them and multiply his grace to them for everything they do aren't we glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning you you seem a little tired but I believe that the Lord will uh certainly give you an IV if you're in need of one today just grab a hold of him and he will revive us and resuscitate us and restore us and uh my voice is a little little shaky but I know that the Lord will help us uh today because we're gathered here by a Divine appointment we're here because he called us here amen would you turn in your Bible if you have it with you uh again to the Book of John chapter 15 and I want to read this morning again beginning in verse one all the way to verse 7 I want those of you who were uh here last night to know that thank you so much for pulling on the word and your faith and how that you let the Lord come and meet you at the end of the service and I believe God did something for somebody's more than one and I know that he did something for me he did somebody said I was so blessed I said I was too there's nothing like his presence we need that daily connect with his presence is that right I want to say before we read the scripture God bless you to all of you who are streaming this service around the world and uh we just appreciate it uh someone said I'm listening from the road in Iowa today God bless you brother writers in South Africa Cape Town uh the the van hoodens in the Netherlands and uh Indiana Kenya God bless you and uh sometimes we don't know where you're from if you don't tell us but God bless every one of you who are tuned in with us through the stream today what a blessing it is that we have this connection Jesus said I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman let there be no uh uh misunderstanding about who holds the pruning shears it is the eternal spirit of God God is the one who does the pruning God is the one who separates the unfruitful full Vine from the branch every branch in me that beareth not fruit he the father taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it or prth it that it may bring forth more fruit praise God now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you and as sister Emily sang to us so beautifully today Jesus said abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye read it abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me I like this so much without me you can do nothing nothing again let there be no dispute without him I can't do anything that's with him I can do everything whatever he needs me to do I can do it if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered if you separate a branch from its Life Source it won't take long and every leaf will wither and all the life sap is gone and you'll find it ready to be thrown into the fire he says it's withered and Men gather them cast them into the fire and they are burned they're they're really good for nothing else he said if ye abide in me it it must not be automatic because if it was an automatic transaction there would be no necessity for an if but since it is not an automatic transaction there is an if involved and the if is a matter of your conscious decision the if is a matter of your will you've got to will it today and you may have to will it again this afternoon you may have to will it again tonight because there are enemies who desire to separate you from your life source is that right now brother this is one way to make sure you are not sleeping is you're you're standing so so I'll just preach let's do it this morning I'll preach while you're standing no I'm kidding but just a few more moments brother Cade was singing there's not enough demons right there's only so many and there's not enough demons to keep me from my place at the homecoming table because he saw me there before the foundations of the world were laid and so they huff and puff and they try to blow down the house but they're just liars like their father amen am am Jesus said if ye abide in me a conscious decision today this afternoon tomorrow when I wake up this morning in the morning I need to have that kind of a thought in my mind today Lord I want to abide in you I want your words abiding in me I don't want there to be any disconnect hello you shall ask if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask now now you need to understand that if his words are abiding in you you're going to ask according to the word you're not going to ask to consume it of your own selfish lust you're not going to say something stupid like uh uh you know I want to win the lottery oh it's quiet it's been a while but many years ago there used to be a lottery ticket or two dropped in the offering and you're always wondering who who who bought it well we just toss them we wouldn't know what to do with them I'm not going to watch out for the lottery I I we used to have a a racetrack Greyhound track and they tell me Christian people is what kept it going as long as it as it was go oh my goodness you you're looking in the wrong direction oh Lord I want a million dollars well you you may get it if God wills it to be so but what you're going to be asking for if the word abides in you is your daily bread according to your riches and and I'll tell you God will allow you just what he can trust you with if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask oh I've got more attention with you standing we may be on to something if my words abide in you you shall ask what you will not to consume it of your own lusts but but according to the word that dwells in you and what did Jesus say and it shall be done unto you do you believe that father we believe we're gathered today we are Bonafide Believers Lord I ask this group of people do you believe this and they testified with their mouth yes I believe believe that then Lord show us how to abide in you show us how to make sure that your words are abiding in us so that when we pray we pray according to the will of God and we see the results of the blank check that you have already signed on our behalf and we will give you glory and honor and praise Lord dry back the distracting and weary spirits of the enemy and may we find strength today to receive from your word and we'll give you praise honor and glory for it's in the name exalted above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said I want you to do something different I want you to shake somebody's hand or fist bump them if you're afraid of germs cuz you know no germ can transfer your to your fist I'm kidding it's only your open hand no no no it's either God bless you and then be seated part two disconnection the life has been severed we talked about this expression I I don't remember hearing it much as a child or a teenager but in the last years we hear of this emotional condition of feeling disconnected I'm sure that we experienced it then we just didn't know what to call it because we didn't understand what Wireless means you know I I I had one of the first cellular phones but it had a cord the handset was connected to the receiver by a cord even if it wasn't completely cordless now we just answer the phone and keep riding down the road so maybe we just didn't know what to call it back then but all of us have experienced a moment of suddenly feeling alone in a crowd of people so many good things happening around you and you feel like you're standing on the outside of your own life life looking in it can happen to anyone but it's particularly disheartening when it happens to a Christian then it is more than just a disconnect socially or a emotional sort of thing it becomes a spiritual condition and to feel that God is a million miles away or to feel that when you pray he is silent and every time I use that expression silent I I'm sorry for where my mind goes maybe it's something you you can't relate to but my mind goes always to Jonah Arc because she was led by visions and experiences and when she was arrested and ready to die she found herself disconnected you remember from the ingred Bergman movie as that right is that who it was you will remember that when she knelt to pray where were the voices that had inspired her to lead the French Revolution silent where were the Visions there were none where was God when she needed him the most and in anguish she cried out so mistreated brutalized raped by guards really feeling forsaken but when she needed his strength the most he comforted her all the way through her death where was he when she needed a vision where was she when she needed to hear a voice where was she when she needed Le where was he when she needed leadership he was always right there there are times that we don't feel him but we must remember he hasn't changed his proximity he's still right there again as close as the mention of his name I don't like it when we have this tendency to to put it on God as though he is failing Us in some way I don't know about you but I would rather accept all responsibility than to allow my mind to attribute any blame to my Creator because to be honest he's just been too good I don't want anybody to think that he's not what he says he is because he is and I've got a feeling that if there's any responsibility it's it's on me because somewhere down the line I have hung the phone I have cut myself off I didn't heed the advice of the word that that tells me when I when I feel alone when I feel brokenhearted then I pour my heart out to you and you draw near to me you are near to those with a broken and a contrite spirit is that the word but we forget get that sometime a and we have a tendency to judge a a a dark place in our life by how we feel but feelings are are are fickle and they come and they go has anybody ever woke up in a good mood a uh you know you the bluebird some of you won't won't remember but the bluebird is singing on your shoulder some of you have never seen it because we live in a woke society and you'll never get to see the old film Song of the South but some of us remember Mr Bluebird singing on our shoulder seems like the butterflies are are fluttering around and and the grass is Greener and the sky is Bluer and life couldn't get any better and suddenly Bluebird is gone and blue skies are gone and and gray skies have repl and you go from feeling like you're on top of the world until now you are underneath the weight of the world it can happen in a moment our feelings can change but the reality Remains the Same we serve an ontime God who knows who cares who understands he doesn't look at you with condemnation in his heart he doesn't look at you with judge even when we are wrong that's right even when we have failed even when we have rebelled even when we have refused to obey he loves us his love his care his concern his provision is not based on our performance it's not based on our Behavior it's not even based on whether or not we get the uniform just right he loves us right where we are but if you're not in a good place he loves you so much that he doesn't want to leave you in that bad place he will always extend a hand of mercy of compassion of help one of the greatest scenes in the the the film series The Chosen and I know there will always be fault finders because there will always be something to find you know if if somebody could make a series you know just like brother brandom described it we might all be happy but even that's open to interpret ation at times but but they don't know what you know and so they do it according to their inspiration some people just threw out the whole concept of the passion movie because it was so Catholic and it was but it didn't change the impact for me anyway of seeing visually a representation of his suffering and I don't know about you it's been a long time ago but I felt like it was all my fault it was made so real that I took responsibility in that moment and realized my sin is what put in there in in the chosen there will be some things that you know that may be add or take you know a poetic light but I've been blessed anyway my favorite character is Peter he has short person syndrome that's why he has to have such amazing biceps it's because he's compensating for being so short he has a short stature and a short fuse but nobody should doubt that he is the kind of friend you want to have Jesus was blessed to have a friend like Peter now Peter was more blessed if you had a friend even with short people's syndrome like I do sometime I have some you're blessed because they can be true blue Peter is full of fear he is full of [Music] insecurity he's full of guilt he's full of so much that is not light it's dark and yet he has come to a place of not being able to not believe Jesus made it so real there was no room for doubt it became so real to him and in that moment that he is out on the sea and the wind is blowing and the waves are dashing yes my favorite scene I watched a clip of how it was even made that that really fascinated me Jesus comes to him on the water and Peter no one else said I'd like to get out there where you are just shorty you know no I'd like to do what you're doing I'd like to be out there come on and and I wonder how many of us would have said no no I'm just kidding but Peter did what everybody has to do he made a decision to get out of the boat somebody said it didn't turn out too good for him it turned out wonderful for him because he learned that day that his strength was not in his bicep his strength was in his relationship with the one who had been revealed to him who do you say I am Thou Art the Messiah the Messiah the anointed one the son of the most high God blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock not short person with big bicep but on this Revelation I will build my church and the gates of hell they will March they will howl they will rattle against it but they will not Prevail against it and Peter sinks because he gets his eyes this is your disconnect when Peter stepped out Jesus didn't turn around and head for the shore he stayed right there to watch over it all Peter's doing good you know you do you do you do how many of you have ever done good for a while well it's not so hard after all and then the distractions somebody said I want to Min are you hearing me today I want to minimalize the distractions in my life oh you do you carry most of them in your hand for somebody that keeps saying I'd like to minimalize the distractions in my life life somebody said well preacher seems to me like you always have yours in your hand I really have very little choice because that's how you reach out but there are times let me tell you something if I leave mine in the chair to go to the bathroom when I get back to the chair there will not only be a text but it will say well are you there dot dot dot you must be busy dot dot dot come on it's how people reach out but if I was a person who said I want to minimalize distraction in my life I believe what I would do is disconnect myself from some of the R ractions do you really have to have them all oh it's so quiet you know some quiets disturb me and some quiets bless me and that quiet blessed me because I knew I was on the trail do you really have to have Facebook Instagram Twitter oh no X Snapchat Tick Tock what's the one where everybody stops and takes a picture at the same time you know be real oh please I hope you don't think you're being real that's not real I want to tell you it's not being real now I want to say Emily you're if she were on I'm not on I don't know if she's on but she would be real because that's the kind of photographer she is but I've been with people on the be real and they take it three times to get the chin right I I'm going to be honest there sometimes I I I mean I say look please don't post that one there I I I don't know that I have a good side but surely there's got to be something better than that one you see you don't really have to have them all I might miss some you don't have to see every reel you don't have to follow every Rabbit Hole every Rabbit Trail come on now if you really want to minimalize distractions you've got to make up your mind to do it and do it right just a minute Amen brother none of it is wrong in itself but if it's distracting you from what really matters and that would you're the only one who knows CU you may discipline yourself you may really have it under control so if that doesn't distract you the enemy will find something else [Music] he'll he'll addict you to busting Bubbles and crushing candies and monopolies go and help me out somebody what's that give me another one what Solitude on and on and on if that's not what there'll be something else oh it's quiet in other words you are disconnected not because he moved but like Peter we get our eyes on that that flashes and moves and changes around us and when Peter took his eyes off the one that made sure he stayed on top of of the water he began to sink is that right and you and I do the same yes we may never change the way we talk about him but our relationship our fellowship with him has changed and now it's about this or it's about that or it's about the other and we start going under slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly and Jes Jesus reaches out his hand Peter takes a hold of the Lord and and he he's immediately back on top of things I like this part the best Jesus starts him toward the boat you may not read it like that in the gospels but I got a feeling that Peter once he had a hold of him he had a hard time turning him loose anybody with me and when he I wished I had it I would just play it for you this morning give some critic something else to criticize us for when he walked him back to the boat and Peter grown man grown man with pretty good biceps grown man he's crying out hom me don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go that's the Cry of the rescue that's the Cry of the saved of the redeemed of those who know what it's like to sink and they know what it's like to be saved to be rescued and their cry it's not just walk me back to the boat help me get back up on top it's don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go so it's never the Lord who disconnects from us no no no I'm okay don't call the don't call the emergency I did not fall it's never his fault it's always something in us that we need to see he never hang up he never tries to play hide and seek as some preachers seem to describe this game of hide and seek that may be the experience of church anity but there is no hide and seek in the bride he doesn't want to play with your emotions he's not trying to play with you and show you who's boss he's always there what he is trying to do is help us to know we don't live by feelings we don't live by great surfaces we don't live by prayer lines only we live by faith we don't live by Goosebumps Sensations we don't live by dancing in the spirit we live by faith faith in the word if we get to dance praise God if we get a chill bump Hallelujah if the hair stands up on our arms praise be to God it's good to feel the Lord but we're not living by Feeling by by an experience we've had we must live by faith and there are times that we go through that are godd designed that we don't feel what we have felt and God is trying to train us yes not punish us train us that this is by faith you see brother brandom realized that that the prayer lines and the prayer cards would not always work it took more and more out of his physical stamina he got weaker and weaker as the Visions opened and he had a harder time shutting them down so weary in Mak Georgia that he was standing uh barely one leg one leg sinking and only one knee one leg holding him up he's sinking like a rag dish rag as he prayed for the last one brother Billy Paul comes and Taps him on the sides sister Wes's dad was the sponsor of that meeting in mon Brother Cleveland who witnessed to me was in the meeting tapped brother brandom on the side as a signal that had been pre-arranged that it's enough and he starts backing brother brandom up off the platform he's prayed for as many as he can physically ministered individually ministered to as many as he possibly could and yet there were hundreds more that had needs you see what that opens up and even human compassion would compel him to do more than he had physical stamina and strength to do could God not have strengthened him absolutely but God wanted brother brandom to know what you and I need to know your strength is totally dependent on him and when it's done it's done when God says that's enough it's enough but just about the time they start him down the step because it's moved to the stadium now out of the out of the uh uh the Civic Center whatever the building I've been there whatever the building is there in in mon they've moved out to the ball field now and the platform is sitting out on the green they're taking him down and brother brandham stops and he stiffens like a log and he says wait just one more somebody's little faith a little child sitting in the audience with Twisted feet about two or three rows from the front so close and not in the prayer line he saw a moment of Vision that little child running with those crippled feet he speaks to the parent there's actually a little box of shoes there that have never fit those deformed feet do you believe the mom or dad said yes we believe little child not its head and brother brandham says Satan turn it loose I don't remember if it was a boy or a girl and when he said that brother Cleveland was sitting just a few seats over and he said brother Shelly I heard those bones it sounded like they were on the loudspeaker as they started popping and cracking snap snap snap and I saw those feet that were bent back and deformed I saw them when they straightened out and I saw that little child stand to its feet running across the the front of that of that field healed by the power of God Brother Cleveland said I saw F I saw chairs folding chairs that people were sitting in they began to fly over people's heads because people began to Rejoice because they had seen a miracle well brother brandom knew that his strength would not always last and that there would be more who would need prayer and more who would need a vision and a discernment and more who would need their Miracle sir and so he started talking about a new ministry he started talking about a new demonstration he started talking about the power of the creative spoken word that would not take the strength and the virtue of the vessel but it would move in such Authority that it wouldn't even be necessary hello to have a prayer line where a need was revealed and a name was called and we say oh God we'd like to see that again what I would like to see is you you raise up into the manifestation of the Son of God that you were created to be I don't need to be the one I want to see you you must be talking to Brothers I'm talking to Brothers I'm talking to Sisters I'm talking to Children I'd like for every one of us to rise to that place where we win come on now I could have use a little help here where we win this mind battle where we once and for all realize that God hasn't left us or forsaken us because we have an off feeling right and we just start doing what Sons do calling out to Papa I don't feel you I don't hear you I don't see you but I know that you're here you're not only with me you're in me and I'm depending on you oh great Vine oh John 15 Vine I'm depending on you for my life Source you see everybody's got a ministry right they don't all look the same and I don't hear anything in this man I don't hear I just be honest with you I don't hear what some people hear I don't even know where they get it I can hear the quote they read and then wonder where they got it because when they talk about it it doesn't seem to be saying the same thing you see I'm not one of those who believes that the full manifestation of the third pool was only for the ministry of William brandom oh no I don't believe that at all I believe every Ministry goes through those pools you go through those Cycles you go through those seasons in your life you do you do you do they don't look like his mine doesn't look like yours yours doesn't look like mine but there is es and flows there are ordained moments there are ordained Seasons there are ordained Cycles in all of our lives but the goal is to get us to that place where we have totally surrendered I'm going to preach if you don't ever get a turkey the goal is to get us to a place where we realize who we are because of who who he is no matter how we try we to not do it we still keep putting him up high in the sky brother GRE we we put him there and and and if he wanted to dwell there he'd stayed there the prophet said he has a corporate body somewhere I don't know he said it's somewhere in one of these days he'll pick it up again and he'll come back and receive his bride but he's not bodyless Jesus Oh somebody hear it Jesus is not Bess in this hour he's found a body he's found a body he's found a body he's found a body he's found a [Music] body Hallelujah to live in in this hour disconnected how do you disconnect from the essence of who you are we need a shaking and we've just had one we need some time a big old I don't mean to you're already I'm already losing some of you I don't want to lose the rest of you but sometimes we just need a slap hallah I wish the Lord would release me into that Ministry don't you think I'd be good at doing it I I I just believe I'd be the most anointed slapper the world has ever seen pow get up from there grany I I don't want to brag on myself there's nothing here to brag on I can assure you of that but I mentioned last night that when I met him at 7even years old it took I can feel people getting tense sometime when I say that but I just want you to know that it can take it can go deep enough you see I'm concerned about just getting him on your feeler because that I want you to know when when the going gets tough you start feeling the tough stuff you're not feeling him anymore sometime so it's not enough to have the Spirit on your flesh it's not enough to have it in your emotion but there is a rubbed in anointing there is an anointing that goes beyond the flesh beyond the Mind beyond the will beyond the emotion and totally regenerates that inner spirit that a man comes here with his Fallen human Spirit now totally regenerated transformed no longer a human Spirit at all but now occupied by The Same Spirit that's why the scripture said the Apostle understood it he said the life that I now live is not my life I'm not living by the human spirit that I came here with oh hear me somebody I'm now living by a new spirit I'm living I'm living this is not replacement this is this is transformation regeneration this is God quickening that that is dead and Earthly that which is not of heaven and and transforming it into that which is Heavenly I'm now living by another Spirit I'm now living by something else there's a life in inside of me that my mama didn't give me my daddy didn't give me the doctor didn't help me get here no no no I'm living by something that was birthed in Me by the spirit of almighty God and I don't have anywhere to go I don't have anywhere else to go go back go back go back where if I go back anywhere it has to be to Pentecost so that I can make my way all the way back to the Garden but how could I ever go back to to sin to denominationalism to the things that satisfy for a moment and leave when when I found him it took it changed my life he became my desire he became the reason I live I'm so far from perfect ask my family but the reason I live is for Jesus as my family they'll tell you that I'm not perfect but they'll also tell you that I don't just do this on Sunday and on Tuesday because I know you're going to see me this is what I have learned to do every well if you had to work a public job you wouldn't have the opportunity to do that you may use that as your excuse but I want you to know it'll come up short when you come up short when you come up short your excuse will come up short you can't let that be your reason for not fellowshipping with the one the reason you were born is to have fellowship with him who hung up the phone somebody said the devil has so isolated me he has so cut me off there you go again making him more powerful than the God who lives inside of you they tell about an old testimony service that took place you know we we have to be careful with those even around here because this church is pastored by a person who who loves bunny trails and my anointing Falls on testifiers and they get up to testify and that but they got three stories going at once and and if you've got 50 people on a Tuesday night or whatever you have and everybody took three minutes you you're you're you're sleepy by the time you're done you know but anyway they tell me of an old testony service this woman got up and she was just telling the the whole congregation how how the devil had treated her now the only reason why she would take time to do that is because she thought she was the only one you get to a place sometime where your troubles your trials your hardship is all you see David got there I'm preaching David got there and he learned his way out and his way out wasn't to tell everybody how bad it is his way out was to pray for somebody else when I was afflicted when I was in trouble instead of letting it drive me I I I Afflicted my own soul with fasting in prayer for somebody else and guess what happened he said my prayer returned to my own bosom isn't that the way it works you want out of a a hard place pray for somebody else amen try to see somebody else's struggle intercede for somebody else's need woo this woman she was just you know he the devil has been on my back he's been running me around he used that old husband of mine he cussed me every day this week he broke a broom handle over my hip he this is not prayer request gets pretty scary too this testimony you just giv God praise I mean what are you really saying praise the Lord the my husband broke the handle of the broom over my hip glory to God thank you Jesus Hallelujah and she went on and on and on and on and on and finally she realized that she hadn't said anything to glorify God and she sat down and there was a about a half saved person in the back who stood stood up and this was all they said the devil has been so good to me praise His holy name and sat down I'd never say that that's just what she said 20 minutes she rattled on at how how how what a good job the devil was doing in her life she didn't say praise His holy name but she could have because she had taken the moment set aside to give God glory for what he's done and used it to edify and glorify how good the devil was doing his job I need a little help you don't need to brag on the devil he doesn't need your validation he is seeking roaming around seeking whom he may devour and as I often say he doesn't just want to take a a a hunk out of you he wants to eat you up he's seeking whom he may devour but greater hallu get your eyes off the waves and the winds and the storms get your eyes off that mean husband of yours get your eyes off of aches and pains and circumstances and and feelings that try to tell you that God doesn't even know where you are and you begin to remember who you are by the promise of the word and you begin to use this mouth this is a creative mouth God has given you you are a creator because you came from the great Creator and this little bride was given creative Authority because of the word that's in her mouth and if she ever really realized who she was there's enough Authority in her in the word that has been given to her that she could speak a word and create a world and step out into that world and inhabit it well I want you to know that's what you have to do let me preach to the few of you that are listening to me that is exactly what you have to do you've got to create a world you've got to create an environment somewhere that you can live in you've got to make you a place where the word is is the reality and everything else is lie we live in a world now in an atmosphere now where the LIE is the reality and the woke is the reality and the weirdness is a reality and the word is the weird thing you stand up for the word you're not just a Christian you You' got to be a fundamentalist you've got to be a fanatic you've got to be an extremist an Evangelical extremist what is that deeply religious you're labeled listen the reason why you don't belong in this world this is not your home we're only passing through this world and we don't have to live in it while we do somebody said do you mean we don't have to live in it of course we live in it we move here we we work here we have oh yes we do but let me tell you something that's not the reality the prophet told us this is the negative that's the positive why don't you just make you a better world to live in somebody said how will I do that by the power of God that's in your mouth by the word of God that's in your mouth you just start coming into agreement sir this isn't name it and claim it blab it and grab it this isn't just Word of Faith stuff this is bible stuff you make up your mind like we sing here even when I don't feel him he's working even when I don't see him he's working uhhuh say it with me even when I don't feel him he is working even when I can't see him if you you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will the trouble is he tells us last night we mentioned the greatest battle ever fault the trouble is we're standing in here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside oh it starts changing your your your environment it starts changing your atmosphere it starts changing what you've accepted as reality the devil is out to get me that's true but he can't unless I let him that's true that's true did you know that if you have repented of your sin and you are not living today with unconfessed sin the devil has no legal right none if he does anything he does it by permission and most of the time you're the one who signs the hall pass I'm the one who signs the hall pass because every time I focus on him he says uhhuh yeah see I thought I could get I thought I could get his mine yeah I thought I could catch her yeah I thought I could yeah and look look look look look look look what she's focusing on now look what he's running after now look what he's googling now and boy when you do that it opens a door and that unconfessed sin in your life gives the enemy a legal right to squat anybody with me are you sure you're with me 1 John 1:9 if we confess [Music] somebody said what's that mean tell them I got to tell them I got to tell oh please I've been in those meetings I've been in Pentecost a long time I remember those things that would come through and conviction would fall and people would stand up and start confessing their sin hello wake up preaching to you because I love you that can get uncomfortable in a hurry you see I was only about 22 23 years old the spirit of the Lord comes sweeping through the church in Columbus I'm not a married man but I certainly didn't have my eye on anybody the spirit of the Lord comes sweeping through there and a woman a pastor's wife a preacher's wife a missionary's wife jumps up in the middle of the service and starts confessing her sin what I didn't know what to do I'm just learning here I'm just learning just trying to learn what to do with people when they start spilling it all you think some of our testimony Services make you nervous and to punctuate everything that she had said she ended her testimony by this and if that's not enough I'm in love with brother Shelly you were there sister Flo you could have knocked me over with a feather I wanted to die there was no part of me attracted to any part of her she was five kids later the thought had never crossed my mind she had never acted toward me in an unforward way were you there Billy she had never acted toward me in an unforward way so I don't want that kind of confession take that one to the altar don't stand up and say it out loud and my office is not a confession Booth there's a Time the scripture said we confess our faults one to another but not our sins we're not Catholic this is confessing it to the only one if we read it for me would you if we he is faithful and just if there it is again if it's not automatic if we confess our sins he there's no reason for us to live with unconfessed sin well I don't want to tell nobody don't want to tell nobody don't want to tell nobody it's easier if you realize you're telling the one who already knows it then why do I have to confess it because you've got to own it right you've got to identify with your sacrifice yes yes in the Old Testament the sin was symbolically transferred over to the head of the animal and the animal was slain so there is an identification that takes place between your sin and the sacrifice you are identifying you are confessing to the one that already knows and he I can just feel sometime in the service that people's thumb is itching to scroll and they just want to scroll right past what I'm saying and find something more interesting no wonder preachers in modern churches today are preaching in chicken suits and dressing up like Barney F and doing all kinds of things to capture the attention of the people because they realize that we have programmed ourselves I'm constantly told no one has the ability to comprehend that much that's why it's magnetically recorded that's why it's digitally recorded so that you have an opportunity if you so desire there's no there's no requirement no one checks on you to see if you do but if the spirit of God and I will tell you this the people who testify to me of their Victory the people who testify to me of overcoming something are always those who have spent some time going back to the word I was listening to such and such I was listening to such and such I was watching such and such I went back and heard such and such and it has so encouraged me well weren't you there the first time I was well did it encourage you then yes but not like it did now there's something about going back that's why I'm thankful for the spiritual food in due season from the last generation that God has preserved for us us we need it it's a way that we meditate on the word so that we can stay connected to the vine if we confess if we confess our sins he is faithful come on Austin and just it's been so long since I've been able to poke at Austin faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from what Romans 109 through1 I've got to move on that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart mind will emotions not blood pump we're guarding our heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved without the messenger absolutely without reading the church age book absolutely absolutely we've taken what we believe right out of the word and tried to stand it in the corner and it will not stand on its own it has to be based and built on the foundation of the absolute scripture and this is what the scripture said you may not overcome you're not going to have the Overcomers reward if you don't overcome I know that we live in a society where everybody gets a ribbon Just for participating but in that day you're not going to get a trophy just cuz you tried it's only to the Overcomer right these things there's only one company of Believers that's going to sit with him in his throne and that's those who overcome the spirit of their age and here's what you need to know we're not only overcoming the spirit of leod deia but unfortunately this last day bride is facing the evil of every Church age compounded into leoda but that's okay because the Lord made me a promise and he said in the same manner that the leodan bride will face the evil of every age she shall also know the overcoming portion that I poured out in every age oh my my my and what more do you need than the than the Overcomers anointing the Flying Eagle anointing what more do you need than to be lifted up above your circumstances to look down and see that God's got a bigger plan catch the lifeline somebody catch the lifeline somebody catch the John 15 line somebody yes sir Thou shalt be saved if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth but here it means something more than that he said for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture sayith whosoever believeth on him shall not be but you need to know what confession means confession did I give you that confession means to commit oneself to so it's not just saying it it's coming into a covenant it's coming into agreement if you believe that Jesus died and rose again he paid the debt for your sin then it's not just a sinner's pray joining a church making your way to a system there's a commitment that follows to commit oneself to to acknowledge something usually public a profession of Allegiance confession means to say the same thing he he he will cleanse me from all unrighteousness that's what he said what do I need to say the same thing greater is he that is in me that's what the word said what do I need to say greater he this in me come on come on come on come on come on my God shall supply all of my riches all of my needs excuse me I sounded like a TV preacher all of a sudden God shall supply all of my needs some of my wants according to his riches and glory is that what the word says then what do I need to confess my God shall supply all of my needs according to his riches and Glory sister Joyce stand up would you please I want you to make one of those confessions that you you testified to us about I want somebody to hear one of those confessions I just want you to recite it out John n do it again do that one amen give me another one that's all right you I I I might even have the list I didn't mean to embarrass you I said to her I want that I saw she was reading it the night she gave it I want that I want a copy of that one that one stayed with me she testified of a struggle that had followed her her entire life and she just found scriptures that tell the truth about that struggle and she just made it a practice every day somebody said I can't do it from memory you don't have to you can read it it will mean the same the devil don't know the difference you don't have to be able to memorize it to read it but what you do have to do for it to be a confession you've got to mean it you've got to commit to to it you've got to agree with it and that's where the battle is and is all of my unrighteousness really cleansed I've got to believe it is I've got to believe it is in order for that confession to be a confession in order for that to be activated in my life in order for his words to abide in me say it I'm your jar I'm your jar if my goal if if you say I'm your workmanship then I yield I yelled to the strong and capable hands of the great Potter if I'm not and I I'm not I am not what you what I want to be what you desire for me to be then I put myself in your hands again make me what you desire for me to be don't focus on your loneliness don't focus on your numbness it'll come it'll come sometime I'm no Superman brother gley is no superhero Marvel could never touch my life my kids say to me sometime dad you've experienced so much you've met so many people so many things have happened to you you've been in court you've been in TV you've been in hauntings in Georgia you've been I'll never forget the day that Wanda Davis calls my wife and says I was getting my nails done we just had met them I was getting my nails done and I looked up at the screen and there was Steve on the Discovery Channel Marvel could never touch my life it could never touch your life I want you to know there are Li there are people in this room whose lives have been more Supernatural than man could imagine and try to portray it come on lots of UPS lots of downs lots of Spidey moments and lots of nerdy kid moments his grace his grace when you've gotten to the place where you can sing Amazing Grace as though you were telling somebody else's story you've turned loose of the vine it's your story you still with me it's your story confession means to say the same thing in the message expectation paragraph 32 I said well that's up to them I don't know but I said you never know no matter how much you scream yeah how loud you scream how much you pray brother B said you can punch them you can kick them you anoint them and it won't do a bit of good that Devil's got a legal right to stay right there and he will stay there too that's right he's got a right to stay there not only that if but if you supposed to have done something and didn't do it he has a legal right of disobedience he said so there's what it is combing that person you find out just what the cause is then you know where to start for the curacy it's unconfessed sin many times we need to say it we need to preach that we need to be reminded of that sometime so you watch what you say stomping this one out and stomping that one out see that's right faith will move but not when he's got a legal right Satan knows what his rights is and what he has what he has what he hasn't got a right to do or to that's right clean yourself up before God and come before him pure and holy ask then it's 120 see and now search your life out does anybody understand that so you come the preacher prays anoints you with oil you growl you you're you you feel you know something it looks like you feel better but you didn't do what is required and that is to confess your sin not to the preacher not to the one praying to the one who is faithful and just with unconfessed sin Let me just be real real legalistic here because that's what they like to call it if you're carrying unconfessed sin in your life look this way folks you have no business on this platform not even to clap your hands you have no business in the sound booth because I see that as an extension of this platform do you see how high it sits up above everybody else I consider that an extension of this platform when you are up higher you have made those steps up you are looked at as a leader whether you're a leader or not maybe a guitar player is not a leader but really they are I know there are churches and whole movements out there that if anybody can play anything from spoons to they want them on the platform form but I grew up in a church brother Jason where we had trouble with guitar players we had some of the best you talk about picking it out you know why they could do us good cuz God gave them a gift and they got all their practice at the hunky Tonk didn't live so clean but got under that anointing and played so well and there are people who have this mindset that if you can just get them involved you know let's have a ball team and let everybody play on the ball team and that'll get them involved let's do this a we come on but you forget sometime that if everybody's looking up toward you're you're up here you are a leader whether you have signed up to be one or not and you have no business up here come on now with unconfessed sin in your life that's right what if I told you as a Believer you have no business sitting where you're sitting with unconfessed sin in your life because you want to know that you are connected to the vine and if you have uncon it's so easy it's so quick it's so easy it doesn't take you you've already repented of your broken Fallen condition you don't have have to start from scratch you don't have to go back to birth you know what's unconfessed in your life you know what you've allowed unbelief to do don't pretend take a minute because if you will confess he will forgive and if you have confessed it he gives Grace to turn from it you can't keep in it you've got to make up your mind I'm going I'm coming out you may not come out all at once but you're in you're heading in that direction you're committing but don't get in this mindset you wean yourself off of unbelief right that's not the way it works come on the old church had something right oh yeah they preached it like that if you don't if you don't confess if you don't get that unbelief dealt with then it doesn't matter who prays for you who anoints you with oil who Shakes You jerks you ja ja Jaws over you you may get a feeling you may get a moving you may cry there used to be a time folks where we could we could almost judge something by tears but that's not the hour we live in now cuz I've seen demon possessed people cry like repentant Sinners and it wasn't even them crying but them demons was crying out in them trying to fool them into thinking something that wasn't so come on so it's not by tears that you can judge someone's sincerity best thing to do is keep your mind and mouth off of somebody else let God make it let God judge let God take care of his business come on we can shake you you can fall out you can roll you can talk in tongues but if the enemy has a legal right because of unconfessed sin he goes right back to the automobile with you and brother random didn't just say unconvincing he said even if there's something that God told you to do and you don't do it that gives the enemy a legal right and he'll stay I'm telling you he'll stay but once you have if you will confess in the message things that are to be look at this one Satan you are defeated oh yeah you say the devil cut you off you say the devil has got you in a fix where you can't feel the Lord you say the devil is the one who who caused the hang up Let Me Tell about your enemy Satan you are defeated you are defeated being Jesus Christ conquered you at Calvary you have no power no power Whoever thought it was a good idea to make a wool

Depression was born under something and I know what it feels like it doesn't have to be based on circumstances everything can be going good and suddenly but I'm sick and tired of hearing it expressed as though we have no choice but to live under anxiety and live under depression there may be a church world out there that didn't have much of a choice but you didn't come here to be defeated by the spirit of this church age you came here to overcome in all things and I'm not in any way condemning I I want you to know I know what this stuff is and I'm not in any way condemning you if you feel that way today if you're depressed and in the throws of Despair today I am not here to judge you to condemn you to cause you to feel guilty but I am here to tell you that one of these days your faith will take a new level and you'll realize where the battle is and you'll realize how it's won and you've laughed at people for making biblical accl uh biblical affirmations you've said that was New Age

crystal or whatever it belongs to the bride I believe in making positive affirmations but I don't believe in just making them uh you know out of the air I mean I don't stand in the mirror every day and say you are goodlooking was that wouldn't be the truth and there'd be no reason to say something like that but I can stand every day in the mirror if I so desire and say I am a child of God I a blood bought believer I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ filled with the walk and talking Holy Ghost I have a Target on my back and Satan would do everything he could to try to destroy me

of God he's absolutely legally de defeated go on the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere the devil cut you off the devil hung up on you the devil has made you feel that way the devil

it for me I heard you he had a beginning guess what guess what Pastor the devil had a beginning he's got an ending oh I love it I love the thought I love the thought I know for a thousand years he's going to Tumble in a bottomless abbis in a bottomless pit he's going to Tumble for a thousand years while the Earth experiences Millennial peace somebody said yeah but don't forget after that he's going to be loosed he's going to try one more time to deceive the Nations that have that have come through the Millennium that's exactly what the word said but after a thousand years just think of this after a thousand years of living in a kingdom where Jesus is the king do you think that he will be very successful do you know he's what stands between a lot of people in getting help you lock him up and let him tumble for a th years do you really think the nations are going to continue to spiral when Jesus is the Lord of lords and the King of Kings when the lion is laying down with a lamb and your little baby it's playing on the hole of the ASP the animal kingdom has surrendered to the Dominion and sovereignty of King Jesus and there is no ambition except to come once a year into the City and see you because where the king is what if this were my last sermon I better give it all I got I better wear you out I better not cut it if he didn't say cut it yet had I the curse is gone oh they're going to be planting Vineyards and so forth the scripture says but can you imagine what's going to happen to planet Earth when the curse is lifted and they're going to come you people who hate the Jewish feast the Hebrew Feast the biblical Feast you people that have such a problem with that you people who ignore what brother brandham said you absolutely ignore what he said our concern for Israel should be you absolutely ignore what he says about the Feast of scripture and how they all point to Jesus please don't forget that according to scripture and your Prophet there's going to be a a commemoration of the Feast of Tabernacles every one of those 1,000 years in the Millennium so God must have not thought they belonged to the Jews that's right he must have thought they had some redeeming value because all the nations are going to come up to Jerusalem and give praise and honor to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords Hallelujah somebody said I hope they stop by my house on their way honey don't you know where he said you could live to him that overcometh well I grant that he should sit with me in my throne even as I have sat down with him in his throne they're coming to see you they're coming to see the king and M King Hallelujah you don't really believe that do you with every cell from the top of my head all the way to the end of my stubbed toe this morning I kicked the tub so hard somebody said I know you wanted to just cuss I have to tell you that was the farthest thing from my mind keeping Consciousness is what I was fixed on it didn't just hurt my toe it hurt every bit of me you ever had it happen I believe it with every cell of my body he's just a devil he's just a password he just serves a purpose he can't stop us from going in or out he hasn't got no legal right to any man that are one man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ I'm going to give you the honor of reading those last two words Devil Run me all over town Devil's been riding my back devil beat me up the devil sure makes me have anxiety the devil sure give me depression the devil's sure de the de you sound you sound you sound just like that bless His holy name he didn't do it you've got a Lifeline yes I was sitting at the table last night I'm closing you know that's a very relative term was sitting at the table last night I wanted to wanted to turn to charity and give her just a little more de uh detail of the experience that had something to do with her she happened to be the reason why I prayed for her last night I'm telling her business she happened to be the first one I noticed oddly her face in the water she was the closest to the boat and she ended up being the first one to take a hold of the lifeline and I knew then God wanted to rescue her from wherever she was whatever she was walking through whatever she was feeling at the moment he he loves you the same he didn't love her more and then as I told I I wanted to tell one more detail just to those who are listening and I forgot to mention this last night when I looked at that vine when I looked at the Rope I thought this rope this can save everybody I mean it was it was a it was a rope I I looked up there and I saw something that could that rope could attach to and all it would take is somebody with one man's strength just crank that thing there'd be no way that anybody couldn't be hauled in and all at one time if need be they could get to the Rope they could get to the liveline but all of a sudden that big old rope changed and it turned into a little little winding Vine no thicker than a than a Virginia creeper or a or a a a poison oh Vine just maybe a little maybe a little thicker and I looked down at it and I thought why this will fall apart in people's hands this I'll never be able to rescue anybody with this I didn't realize it was John 15 right I was just seeing it as a little little Vine but here's what here's what I didn't mention last night I left out quite a few details based on the crowd but I squeeze that little Vine that looks so insignificant really and in both hands I felt the heartbeat Hallelujah I could feel the blood pumping through that little Vine it wasn't it wasn't my blood it wasn't it wasn't plant blood it was a John 15 it was his blood it was his lifeline he was finding a way to get his life to the perishing how many of you are are perishing at times I don't mean cuz you're hungry some of you feel like you're perishing right now he's swept he hasn't no got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's swept in sickness he swept in disappointments he swept he swept in death he can't scare me he can't scare you right that's all he is you ought to point your bony finger and tell him you're nothing but a shadow paragraph 107 of working of the Holy Holy Spirit we didn't get very far and I challenge 107 and I challenge the enemy who has challenged them and we bring back not in our own strength but the blood of the Lord Jesus and say to him Satan I I I didn't put it in my notes this morning but brother bram's coming to parine one time he's preaching wait he said just wait a minute I won't talk to Satan a minute I wouldn't make that my daily habit if I didn't have to but he knew who he was when you know who you are you've got authority to say get out of here you don't have to be black to have that Authority why are you saying that because every time I think of authority in prayer I think of the little mama from from the Kendrick Brothers War Room some of you folks have seen every episode of Little House on the Prairie and you have haven't bothered you've you've watched a lot of junk and you haven't even bothered to see a a Christian inspirational film that come if you're going to if you're not going to watch in anything that's all right but but if you are going to see something on occasion especially with your family it ought to be something some of you couldn't handle the forge oh this world needs that message it's in that film The Forge but in the War Room how many of you have seen the War Room you don't have to be [Music] ashamed there's a black mama black granny she's really not that old she's made up to look old and she's got her a war room in her house and she post promises on her little closet door woo to remind her when she's praying who she belongs to yes and she goes through her living room how Jesus and he hears her she might not dress like you or look like all of you or believe everything you believe but he hears her the message is screaming loud Mama's got Authority you've got Authority she helped that one family that one woman her husband was going astray and getting in trouble and crooking and doing whatever else he was doing and and that woman got so so inspired that she got her a broom my marriage is is bad so I I'm just disconnected and Satan just folks you won't get no over that she knew that wasn't going to work she had children dependent on her she just let her faith begin to rise the next thing you know she is sweeping right out of the house yeah well you don't think it it it works that way well no I don't think he's like a Dust Bunny on your carpet but I think that he gets the message sir you let a woman like like Risa make up her mind you're not going to have my my my boys I can't bring them back to life but I don't have to stand here and and watch these buzzards pick the flesh off their [Music] bones we need a risper we need a mama that'll take a broom to the devil we need somebody in this house that'll take authority over the thing that's been running you around and you start running it around you can't do it by yourself but he's throwing out a Lifeline you're defeated you are defeated Jesus Christ strips you of everything you had at Calvary did Calvary finished it you haven't got one legal right Christ has redeemed everything that Adam lost hallelujah our health yes hello our strength our eternal spirit was lost in Adam it fell in Adam but Christ Hallelujah has given it back to us again freely somebody say freely fre freely Luke Jernigan freely on he's giv it back to us freely you don't have to win the victory he won the victory you just grab a hold of the victory until you can feel the blood pumping through it and he's here tonight Among Us a alive working doing signs and wonders sometimes you can see them sometimes you don't see them but he's here he's doing his doings one more and we're going to go I love the title of this one Jesus Christ the same you may not understand the seals or the Thunders let me just reassure you the preachers don't either they're no further ahead of you than I'm no further ahead of you we we're all just waiting on God to bring it to pass when we don't understand it we just say oh God I know it's right because I've seen it in the word but the theme of this message is Jesus Christ if you try to make it about a man other than Jesus Christ you've missed the mark Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Salem Oregon he said Satan we turn to you you great small SM educated philosopher deceiver Church age book calls him the greatest sophist trying to contradict the word of God the words been made manifest listen to this we now brother brandom is the one exercising this Authority but he had no desire to go there without you he was standing before a Congregation of people he wanted them all to meet the challenge he didn't want to be the only one your pastor doesn't want to be the only one the one sitting on the other end of your pews don't want you don't that they don't want to be the only one we come to meet your challenge musicians will you come and help us we come to meet your challenge in the name of Jesus Christ who was crucified died rose again the third day triumphed over every devil which one did he leave out which one did he not stomp on which one did he not Crush triumphed sister Sheila every one of them every one of them he triumphed over every devil G every demon every power that the devil ever had stripped you from every legal right you had unless there's confessed sin or unbelief present cause he paid the price and brought his church back hear me brought his church back say it again bye now whosoever call upon the name of the Lord and confess can be saved but we're not talking about salvation we're talking about something bigger than salvation we're talking about Redemption somebody said what could be bigger than salvation oh Redemption because Redemption doesn't just save you out of your circumstance and leave you there salvation saves you out of your present circumstance but there is something that does more than that Redemption Redemption doesn't just save you out of your present circumstance it takes you somewhere Redemption takes you all the way back to God's original thought yeah about you and he saw you holy he saw you healed he saw you sane I want somebody to say he saw me sane he saw me in my right mind he saw me overcoming high blood pressure he saw me overcoming depression he saw me overcoming Anxiety he saw me overcoming gallbladder issue he saw saw me overcoming joint issue he saw me overcoming arthritis he saw me overcoming daddy issues he saw me overcoming abuse whether it's word abuse physical abuse mental abuse sexual abuse he saw me he saw me overcoming a broken marriage he saw me he saw me overcoming addiction he saw me Redemption takes you all the way back to what he saw about you in the beginning did I do that long enough to make somebody mad he paid the price he brought his church back by Redemption is that the end of that one and tonight or today it's almost tonight we are people I'm G to look at you yeah yeah I believe the word's right you give me cause to believe that the word's right because you don't look like defeated people to me just looking at you right now I would never know that you'd ever had a problem I would never know that you've had a test if I didn't know some of your story I would think that you were born in the church underneath the Pew and that the Christian Life is the only life you'd know and that you married the perfect person had a perfect marriage and and have only given birth to perfect children if I went by what I saw as I look across this room it would be much easier for me to believe what I've preached today because I'm taking him at his word you see you choose what you see you do I can see you broken and I can see you depressed if I choose to see your scars they'll show if I choose to see you defeated in my mind if I want if I should so desire as a wicked hearted man that you didn't make it I could almost see you in that condition but I choose today to see you as you have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb you are a redeemed people I am a redeemed person I'm part of a redeemed bride hello hello hello hello hello hello uh tonight or today we're redeemed people

somebody even without hands laid on you come on brother brandom knew that day was coming that the crowd would outgrow the prayer line and he started trying to point people to a Time that healings and
