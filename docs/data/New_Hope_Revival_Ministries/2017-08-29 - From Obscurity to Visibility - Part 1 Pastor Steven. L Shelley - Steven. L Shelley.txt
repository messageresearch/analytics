TRANSCRIPT
========================================
assemble oh Jacob all of the I will surely gather the women of Israel I will put them together as the Sheep of bosra as a flock in the midst of their pasture they shall make great Noise by a reason of the multitude of men praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steph Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and I want to tell you that I'm excited about the day and the hour that we're living in this is truly an exciting hour to be alive why because Jesus is doing great and marvelous things through his people for his people in his people well we can almost say that Bible days are here again in because the reports of Miracles deliverances salvations even raising the dead these kind of Miracles are coming in from the nations of the world and although it's just in seed form now we believe that there's a great acceleration and a great multiplication that's about to take place we believe that truly the Lord Jesus Yeshua our Messiah is bringing his little bride his people from obscurity to visibility and that's what we're going to talk about on the broadcast today from obscurity to visibility that's the motion of the spirit it's like the blessing of elevation that we talked about in the life of Abraham where God is bringing us out um we're going to give you some scriptures some from the song of songs or as we know it in our King James version of the Bible the Song of Solomon we T we read where he talks talked about that beautiful bride leaning on her beloved coming up out of the Wilderness and anyway the next few broadcast we're going to share some exciting things with you so you be sure to stay tuned and let's see what the Lord has for us I want to just invite you quickly to go and visit our ministry website on the worldwide web at revival. G that's revival. G you'll find some some interesting information and resources available for you there there's preaching both audio uh perhaps some video and also in transcript form prophetic words and visions that the Lord has spoken to us in our local church and uh in different places where we have ministered around the world some pictures and so you might get to know my family and some of the Saints who are a part of this ministry here and uh also there is a place where where you can follow a link that will take you to iTunes to be able to download free on your computer the podcast we call it an Eagle Cast it's a uh uh it's in fact it's these broadcast that you're watching here on this network we're releasing them now right over the computer and so you can download them uh in video and audio right onto your computer and if you have one of these little fangled mp3 mp4 players then you can put it right down onto that download it right on to your little player and take it with you wherever you go we're excited we're just getting started in this part of the Outreach but we're very excited about it because we believe it's an unbelievable opportunity to take the gospel in a portable means you know there's a lot of people perhaps you even have friends and loved ones who are not able to see the Eagles cry on this great Network that you're watching right now but they have a computer and you'd like to share it with them in fact people are even downloading them burning them on to DVDs and passing them around and I give you permission to do that because we want to share some of the Insight that God is giving us in this day by the Holy Spirit we want to share it with all who have an ear to hear the more we get it around the better and so we're just excited there's lots of exciting things going on we also realize that this program is aired in many places of the world where people are are challenged in their finances where they are really needing more provision and a more of a release of finances in their lives and we're praying of course that God will help you to overcome uh that you will receive what you have need of both spiritually and of course in the natural but if you're watching this broadcast in a place and God speaks to your heart and you have the means that you could partner with us then we'd like to invite you to do that you just visit the partner button on our website or you can write us a little letter the address is given at the bottom of the screen or call us and let us know that you'd like to send a monthly amount uh of really any amount that you would like to sew into the Eagles cry broadcast we have just not ask for money we don't try to come up with little ways of getting your support but I think every now and then it doesn't uh misle the Lord or unleas the Lord not please the Lord if we would give you an opportunity if he so speaks to you to help us because we believe in expansion we believe that we're just scratching the surface right now of what God has for us and we want to be able to expand and to reach out and to see what God has you know this is a tremendous opportunity that God has given us one that we were not expecting one that we were not looking for but God opened the door for us to just share our heart um it's not glossy it's not glamorous uh you see that it's very simple just me in my chair but many times the anointing of the Lord will come and it will be so strong the presence of the Lord as we tape these broadcast and we get the comments we get the emails we get even a a a snail mail letter every now and again that says the anointing of God filled my home as you were sharing especially we've had tremendous response concerning the prophetic and some of the visions and the open portal and some of those wonderful things that we shared in previous broadcast and so also if if you're uh listening in a place where you have the means and you'd like to order a DVD of some of the broadcast you can go on the website or contact us and we would be happy to uh help get that in your hand maybe you'd want to share it we had people asking for the episode where we shared the portal picture the open Heaven picture and we'd be happy to get that to you we want to share it and get it out so enough of that let's get right into the word of God today let's see what the Lord would say let's prepare our hearts because we don't want to just be hearers of the word we want to be doers as well amen we want to walk it out we want to live it out we want to take it to the streets and I believe that's the thrust I believe that's the paradigm shift that's coming right now to the body of Christ that we're being empowered and filled up with the precious Holy Ghost and we're going to be launched from the church house right out into into the street into the marketplace into the community working the works of Jesus Christ and truly it's going to seem like the book of Acts all over again I believe that I believe there's great apostasy I believe there's been a great falling away from truth but I also believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is receiving her wakeup call her marching orders amen and I believe that we're about to see some great things accomplished in a quick short word and then the Lord is going to keep his word and keep his promise and receive his people unto himself all right let's look to the word of God in the book of Isaiah Chapter 58 I want to read several verses uh to you or with you I should say in uh Chapter 58 beginning in verse 5 and I think we'll go down to uh verse 14 the last verse of Isaiah Chapter 58 so beginning in verse 5 is it such a fast that I have chosen you know that's not a very popular word anymore to fast to miss a meal for Spiritual reasons to set aside some time to seek the face of God to say I'm going to push my plate back and I'm going to sacrifice this time that I would normally be eating my lunch and I'm going to give this lunch hour if you work a job where you receive receive a portion of time allotted for a lunch hour I'm not going to eat my lunch today but I'm going to use this time to spend with the Lord and you know I believe if uh many of us would start adopting that practice into our lives on a weekly basis and we just did it maybe once a week just one lunch hour a week and we said Lord I'm going to give you that lunch hour I it it's kind of hard to imagine what kind of spirit spiritual results could take place if enough of us would Covenant and agree together to give God one hour of our work week for instance if you're a 40-hour uh worker and you and you have a one hour lunch out of your eight hour work day and you just said okay on Wednesday I'm going to give my lunch hour I'm going to read God's word I'm going to pray I'm going to go get quiet somewhere and and and just soak in the presence of the Lord and if enough of us did that and started receiving from his hand I believe that he would give us Revelation from his word and the blessing of his presence there's no telling what would happen so I think that we should remember that fasting is a part perhaps more than a lunch hour perhaps you'd say Lord I want to give you a 24-hour period that I'm going to just use as much of that time seeking you praying interceding believing turning my faith loose and perhaps God would even launch you into something longer but let's hear again what the prophet Isaiah is saying here is it such a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bull rush and to spread sackcloth and Ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord listen at verse six is not this the fast that I have chosen a question to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed Go free and that ye break every yoke God said this is the fast that I have chosen this is the result that I'm looking for from your fasting and from your devotion we want to see Heavy burdens undone amen we want to see the oppressed the demonized the depressed the discouraged Go free and we want to see every yoke of bondage that the enemy has placed across your back to bind you to restrict you to keep you from fulfilling the purposes of God in your life we want to see those yolks broken and not only broken but destroyed the prophet Isaiah says in another place that because of the anointing the Manifest presence of the Living God the Yoke was destroyed so we want to see such complete and total Deliverance in the body of Christ whether it's alcohol or drugs or illicit sexuality or lust or or a gambling addiction or overe eating addiction or whatever the problem is I believe that God wants his people free he doesn't want us laboring under these oppressive uh yolks bondages habits things that we just can't get rid of so let this be the hour let this be the season where we as individuals just begin to focus on what it will take to see the oppression gone out of our lives and and when we begin to come up into that place of Liberty and Freedom the first thing you want to do when you get help the first thing you want to do when you get set free is to go help somebody else get free that's what's so wonderful about the loss of multiplication in the body of Christ when you get saved and your life is turned around upside down the things that youve once hated you now love and the things you once loved you now hate like the Apostle Paul said old things have passed away behold all things have become new I'm a new creature he said and when that happens in your life you you know I've heard people give testimony where they said uh the day after I got saved I woke up I went outside the grass was greener the trees were taller the flowers were more beautiful the birds sung more sweetly well I know exactly what that feels like that's the joy of the Lord uh it multiplies it it reverberates it ricochets back and forth in and out of our spirit man and we do really uh have that freedom to rejoice and so forth when we first come to the lord it's just like everything has changed and we don't want that to become common we don't want our relationship with him to become common we want to keep that freshness and that newness I heard a great uh teacher a great prophetic leader in the United States a fifth generation Pastor a father to many people spiritually across the world his name is Bill Johnson and I heard him say uh a very interesting thing his church is uh the it's uh bethl Church in Reading California and I heard him say an interesting thing on a CD of a conference where he was speaking recently that I don't think I'll ever forget he said I want to tell you how that you can stay encouraged be encouraged and stay encouraged every day of your life not getting discouraged but being encouraged every day of your life I'm telling you I reached over and turned up the volume because we all face discouragement we all face battles and when we're going through heavy trials and burdens well we get discouraged and we question and we wonder hey what's God up to and why is it taking him so long to get to my rescue and uh does he love me I mean you know according to our maturity in the spirit uh that's just how far the enemy can go with stirring up a spirit of question and doubt in our in our minds but for as many years as some of us have served the Lord we've been through the whole gamut we we have heard the the uh innuendos of of Satan and then we've also had him screaming in our face to cause us to doubt the promises of God and their effectiveness in our lives but there is a way he said Bill Johnson said there is a way that you can be encouraged every day of your life and here is what he said he said by remembering what God is doing right now and by remembering what God has done he said where where people get discouraged is when they Park their car now I want you to kind of see that it's an illustration and a good one we he said people have a tendency to park their car out there beside what God hasn't done yet the promises that are yet unfulfilled you know the Bible talks about Hope deferred and how it makes the heart sick and so if we park Our Lives you understand what I'm saying if we park our car if we drive our state down out there uh next to the things that God has not yet done and every day we Ponder see uh we meditate on what God hasn't done yet what he hasn't fulfilled yet in our life what we haven't seen him do yet that's where we uh entertain where we we invite and where we entertain a spirit of discouragement in other words you can't uh be discouraged unless you invite a spirit of discouragement into your life and and that Spirit of discouragement cannot stay unless you entertain it now now that's what I've added to this subject you know because I'm feeling inspired I'm feeling the spirit of the Lord on that and I think it's just feel like it's absolutely true in my own life and perhaps in your life if we start pondering on unfulfilled prophecies unfulfilled promises things that God hasn't done yet it's like inviting a spirit of discouragement and then as we continue to ponder and think and and meditate on those things forgetting forgetting what God has already done forgetting what God's doing right now oh come on missing the glory of what God is doing right right now because we're reaching and that's very good to reach it's very good to reach forth to reach out to lean into what God has promised that he's going to do and we believe it by faith and we stand on it by faith even when we don't see the Fulfillment or the reality I believe in all of that but I believe that we need to be more attached we need to be more an Ed to what God is doing in our life right now and what he has done somebody said well where do you get an idea like that I mean are you sure this will work well God must have thought it would work because how many times in the scripture in the Old Testament and also uh in the ministry of the Lord Jesus but especially in the Books of Moses the the Torah the first five books of the Bible how many times do we we hear God giving instruction through the prophets to remember remember remember remember remember build a memorial remember build an altar make a memorial remember remember remember teach these things to your children remember them and teach them to your children and your children's children cause them to remember the exploits of God the miracles of god the provision of God why do you think that was so important that God would would uh reiterate it over and over and over again I believe it's a key I believe it's a key I believe that it's hard to stay discouraged when you start thinking on the faithfulness oh Hallelujah when we start meditating on the faithfulness of God in the Years of our life and how he has never ever ever ever failed us he has always been there oh Hallelujah well I'm just getting excited because it's true in my own life he has always been there and I'm telling you you know uh I I used to preach a sermon that that uh said this was the title of the sermon God's delays are not God's denials there are times that the answer is delayed but it doesn't mean that the answer is no it doesn't mean that God has denied us it doesn't mean that God's not going to do it but there are reasons for delay uh for instance what about Lazarus when he died Jesus could have come immediately healed Lazarus of his infirmity and he would have never died but did God get more Glory I think he did I think God through Jesus received more Glory by Waiting by taring by delaying a and coming after Lazarus had already been dead three or four days because now he wasn't just healing Lazarus from his infirmity oh no he was all the body of Lazarus was dead and stinking and breeding worms Oh but the voice of the Resurrection was heard that day Lazarus come forth and Resurrection Life transforming metamorphosis life changing can you imagine it was like the Breath of God the ru of God was released and brought Lazarus right back to life restored him and he lived years after that we believe imagine what his testimony was so uh how was it was God more glorified in the fact that Jesus delayed he didn't come immediately uh but he waited and Lazarus finally died and then was raised from the dead or would it have been more glorifying to the Lord to just come and heal him as another sick man well it must have been the L the latter the former I I should say really I guess it it really would be that God received more Glory from the fact that he delayed or he wouldn't have done it you know what he's God and he doesn't make mistakes so this is how we learn we learn by observing how God has done it and so I feel really good about sharing this I feel really good of uh as though I'm speaking to somebody specifically I know I'm speaking to somebody that's why I'm sitting here but I feel as though I'm speaking to somebody uh specifically who has been so weit Ed down with discouragement the the spirit of discouragement has been so heavy on your life that you didn't feel like you could hardly breathe at times in fact I'm feeling a little bit like uh perhaps you have become so overwhelmed that you've been battling with anxiety and perhaps even some panic attack like symptoms and just uh couldn't get your head above water well I want to tell you something move your car you you've had your car parked next to things uh thoughts and promises and prophecies and and uh desires and Destiny words that have not yet come to pass and you you've lost your connection H you've lost your connection to the faithfulness of God in your past and in fact you're missing what God's doing for you right now you're missing it and so I believe that there's Deliverance for you and countless other people watching this program I I just feel like that we should take authority over the spirit of discouragement and despondency I know that circumstances may not be good uh situations may not be good right now in your life things may be going lousy but I know God and I know his faithfulness and I know how he loves his children and I know that with the help and by the grace of God you can get out of that place of discouragement and despondency we just speak to that spirit in the authority of Yeshua the Messiah and we tell it to go that's what Jesus did when he was dealing with these Spirits he just said go and because of the authority that he carried what they do they they they sat down and ate peanut butter sandwiches no they had to go and I believe that spirit that has you bound has to go oh Hallelujah I'm feeling good it has to go and I want to just encourage you quickly again um stay encouraged by staying connected to what God is doing right now and by staying connected to what God has done look where he brought you from look where you were look where you've been brother sister look where you could have been think about it you know if you would have continued on the road that you were going down some of you would be dead some of you would have died tragic deaths uh totally undone and left a a a multitude of grieving people behind but God In His Infinite mercy and wisdom and love reached out to you pulled you up up out of the myy stuff that the the we used to say the myy clay the muck of sin and and redeemed you not just with some uh price some corruptible price but he redeemed you with an Incorruptible price his blood his blood was the token his blood was the price for your Redemption and then look how he's been faithful faith faithful faithful look how he has provided look at the times that he has healed your body look how God has come to your rescue time and time again so I just loose you right now I got I've got to pray my time is gone so let's just agree right now in prayer I I just loose you I I just loose you in the name of Jesus Yeshua the Messiah I just loose you from that Spirit of discouragement and despondency you are not going under brother sister you're an overcomer you're coming over the top we just release an anointing of Faith to you right now oh Hallelujah that you'll just be strengthened and raise up because this is your you know you're getting ready to step in I mean we know this the people of God and you're part of that huh we're getting ready to step into our finest hour from obscurity to visibility well I've got a lot to talk to you about so you better tune in please please tune in to
