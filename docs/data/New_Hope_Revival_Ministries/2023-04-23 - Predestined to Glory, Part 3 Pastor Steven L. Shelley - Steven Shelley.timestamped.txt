[1:09:51] you people shine

[1:10:00] few lights on in there you're shining

[1:10:12] I've been doing it all my life and some
[1:10:14] of you have too and uh here's the thing
[1:10:17] we don't always have reason
[1:10:19] circumstances to be happy and sing
[1:10:22] joyful songs we have sorrow we have
[1:10:25] grief we have troubles we have pains we
[1:10:28] have anxiety sometimes sickness to deal
[1:10:30] with depression come on lost loved ones
[1:10:34] bad economy I better hush now had my bad
[1:10:38] economy inflation they're fighting the
[1:10:41] the experts are fighting about whether
[1:10:43] this is fixing to spin into a recession
[1:10:47] all right we've been in inflation and
[1:10:49] now the ins and and and if it's
[1:10:52] recession will it be depression
[1:10:54] they're they're just but you know what
[1:10:57] if you don't have any other thing going
[1:10:59] for you if you know that your sins are
[1:11:02] gone
[1:11:04] Hallelujah
[1:11:06] you can know that with a sick body
[1:11:11] things aren't going well if you know
[1:11:13] your sins are gone you've got a reason
[1:11:16] to praise him
[1:11:17] you've got a reason to praise him I want
[1:11:20] to commend every one of you who made the
[1:11:24] extra effort
[1:11:25] to be there yesterday and stand with
[1:11:28] sister Anita and she certainly
[1:11:31] appreciates it greatly and that you
[1:11:34] really surprised me I knew that some of
[1:11:36] you would be there but I didn't know
[1:11:39] that so many of you would be there and
[1:11:42] it means a lot
[1:11:43] we we have to remember that her her
[1:11:46] journey has been a very painful Journey
[1:11:50] and I won't she's not here this morning
[1:11:52] but I wanna I wanna say this again one
[1:11:54] one more time maybe the last time but I
[1:11:58] want to say that uh I've never seen
[1:12:01] anybody serve their husband
[1:12:03] in his great illness any more than she
[1:12:08] did day and night night and day and
[1:12:12] believed she never wavered she she never
[1:12:15] doubt it she never spoke doubt she only
[1:12:18] spoke his healing and his and God healed
[1:12:21] him that's right God just healed him
[1:12:23] just not the way we wanted it
[1:12:26] we did not know the Christian family all
[1:12:29] that well we knew Regina from the home
[1:12:32] school uh program but we knew that so
[1:12:35] many of you knew them so many of you
[1:12:38] were involved with them through the
[1:12:40] homeschool co-ops and things and when
[1:12:42] the news came to us some few years ago
[1:12:45] that that Regina had uh covid and was
[1:12:50] going to go on a ventilator I will I I
[1:12:54] don't know why really why it struck me I
[1:12:57] think it was because of knowing you all
[1:13:00] knowing her and and I had some
[1:13:02] conversations with her even on the phone
[1:13:04] home school related and uh but I just
[1:13:08] wept and we all cried out to God her
[1:13:11] family cried out we prayed as a church
[1:13:13] and the Lord healed her he just didn't
[1:13:15] heal her the way that we wanted him to
[1:13:17] do it we wanted her to be here and so it
[1:13:20] was a special time yesterday
[1:13:22] and and we recognize that it will not be
[1:13:25] an easy walk that they have because they
[1:13:28] are a large family larger now than than
[1:13:31] like like Aaron one of the boys said it
[1:13:34] we're growing a speck
[1:13:36] and and I don't remember I I lost count
[1:13:39] of how many children they will have
[1:13:40] together
[1:13:41] uh is it hum do you remember
[1:13:44] 12.
[1:13:45] a dozen
[1:13:48] you know that's a lot a lot
[1:13:51] and and he's I don't know if it's uh I
[1:13:54] don't know if it's grandchildren and
[1:13:55] great-grandchildren or no maybe no
[1:13:58] great-grandchildren yeah because the
[1:14:00] oldest grandson stood up in the wedding
[1:14:02] and is in Bible school but I think they
[1:14:05] said there was almost 20
[1:14:07] grandchildren you reckon
[1:14:10] anybody know the number
[1:14:12] 18.
[1:14:13] I don't remember the number exactly but
[1:14:16] that is a huge family and they're going
[1:14:18] to need the grace of the Lord because
[1:14:20] there's still a lot of grief there
[1:14:22] and uh there are younger ones that have
[1:14:25] come along that are very uh confused and
[1:14:29] needy
[1:14:30] and our prayers are going to remain with
[1:14:33] them but I am so thankful that so many
[1:14:36] of you were able to be there and and you
[1:14:38] you just you were just a bright light
[1:14:41] there was a a an apostle there they call
[1:14:44] him an apostle his name was Ballard and
[1:14:48] it was his father that the school itself
[1:14:51] was named after
[1:14:54] I think his father must have been passed
[1:14:56] on
[1:14:57] and you know what he said to me he said
[1:15:00] I love the standard that you people have
[1:15:07] he said my grandmother was a Holiness
[1:15:09] woman and we were heathen
[1:15:13] he said we didn't serve the Lord at all
[1:15:15] he said I was uh uh a police officer in
[1:15:20] either Opa-locka or Auburn lost without
[1:15:24] God and my grandmother held on to God
[1:15:28] and her prayers and her faithfulness to
[1:15:31] the word changed my whole family
[1:15:35] so he said I just want to respect and
[1:15:38] honor honor your church and your group
[1:15:40] and that makes me feel wonderful because
[1:15:43] you wonder sometime you you see people
[1:15:45] whispering
[1:15:48] you see people in the crowd you know
[1:15:50] Whispering a little bit there's him
[1:15:52] skirt women and
[1:15:59] and even a better lip reader
[1:16:03] and I see him sometime watching the
[1:16:05] women go by
[1:16:07] you know if you were to be in the crowd
[1:16:09] like that and interview those men
[1:16:12] those husbands and ask them their
[1:16:15] preference of how they would like for
[1:16:17] their wife to look did you know that a
[1:16:19] lot of those men would say just like
[1:16:20] them Godly women over there
[1:16:24] come on now
[1:16:25] because they respect that
[1:16:28] and uh so when you go and you're not
[1:16:31] embarrassed and you don't carry yourself
[1:16:33] awkwardly but you just go in and be who
[1:16:36] you are you're a bright light for Jesus
[1:16:38] Christ and we're it's it's important and
[1:16:41] I know there are people I don't want to
[1:16:42] make nobody mad here this morning but I
[1:16:45] know there are people who think that
[1:16:46] Holiness is optional but I'm not one of
[1:16:49] them
[1:16:52] I'm not one of them I'm like the
[1:16:54] old-timer used to say it's Holiness or
[1:16:55] hell
[1:16:57] I didn't get many amens
[1:17:00] but it's a truth anyhow the fact is I
[1:17:03] don't need your amen because I know it's
[1:17:05] the truth now I know there are different
[1:17:08] convictions and standards and things
[1:17:09] like that and I'm not talking about
[1:17:11] salvation laying in those things but I'm
[1:17:14] telling you if you're a part of the

[1:22:43] slip out before this service is over you
[1:22:46] are not going to offend us
[1:22:48] I've been on the road and I know what
[1:22:50] it's like to have to travel but brother
[1:22:51] I'm so glad I don't believe I've got to
[1:22:53] meet you
[1:22:55] but I'm so glad that you're here with
[1:22:57] your boys your family your wife and I'm
[1:22:59] so glad that somehow you all have taught
[1:23:02] those young men to Worship the Lord
[1:23:06] I want you to know it got me in a good
[1:23:08] way when I saw those two young men
[1:23:11] worshiping the Lord
[1:23:13] and you get that because there's a mom
[1:23:15] and a Daddy who were worshiping the Lord
[1:23:18] we must don't get me started
[1:23:21] we must be the example
[1:23:25] we must be the example for our children
[1:23:29] we put labels on them
[1:23:31] we call them introverts and extroverts
[1:23:34] and we give them all kinds of confusing
[1:23:37] terms and and we say stupid excuse me we
[1:23:41] say stupid things to them like you know
[1:23:44] you're just like your mama you're quiet
[1:23:46] you're backward you're bashful you're
[1:23:48] awkward
[1:23:49] don't say things like that over your
[1:23:51] children don't even confess it over your
[1:23:54] own life
[1:23:56] lead them by example to the things of
[1:24:00] God because they're going to need it
[1:24:03] they're going to need him and so I
[1:24:06] commend you all I do I really do I honor
[1:24:09] you all thank you thank you for being
[1:24:11] willing to worship with us today Romans
[1:24:13] 5 1 therefore being justified by faith
[1:24:19] now notice not by works
[1:24:22] not by uniform not by hairstyle
[1:24:27] by faith we have peace with God
[1:24:31] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:34] by whom also we have access it's getting
[1:24:38] good we have access by faith into this
[1:24:44] grace
[1:24:45] wherein we stand
[1:24:48] I have entered into Grace
[1:24:51] by the doorway of faith and I'm standing
[1:24:54] in Grace today
[1:24:56] does that sound too super spiritual to
[1:24:58] you I'm standing in Grace that's what
[1:25:01] the word said by whom also we have
[1:25:04] access by faith into this grace wherein
[1:25:09] we stand and rejoice in Hope of the
[1:25:14] glory of God that's that full change
[1:25:17] that's coming to our body so spirit is
[1:25:20] saved the soul is in the process of
[1:25:24] being saved that's mine will and
[1:25:25] emotions according to the Greek of the
[1:25:28] New Testament you are you are Body Soul
[1:25:31] and Spirit Spirit on the inside
[1:25:33] according to the scripture and so that
[1:25:36] soul is mine will and emotions that's
[1:25:38] where we struggle the soul has been
[1:25:40] redeemed by the blood of the lamb and
[1:25:42] the new life of Jesus Christ has
[1:25:44] regenerated that old soul it's brand new
[1:25:47] but that mind and will and emotion that
[1:25:50] struggle sometimes so it's in the
[1:25:52] process of full Redemption but what is
[1:25:55] being talked about here is a is that
[1:25:57] last Glory that last Glory that will
[1:26:01] change this body
[1:26:02] how many of you believe the body is
[1:26:04] going to be changed by whom also we have
[1:26:07] access by faith into this grace wherein
[1:26:10] we stand and rejoice in Hope of the
[1:26:12] glory of God I got to read and not
[1:26:15] comment
[1:26:16] and not only so but we glory in
[1:26:19] tribulations also
[1:26:23] I'm going to put my finger up here
[1:26:26] because I want to come in but I'm trying
[1:26:28] to read so you can sit down
[1:26:31] you we've got a glory
[1:26:34] we've got a glory in the hard times
[1:26:37] we got a praise in the hard times
[1:26:41] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:26:43] his word you may be seated
[1:26:45] we got to praise in the in the rough
[1:26:47] times
[1:26:48] if you come in here and you see somebody
[1:26:51] praising the Lord and you sit back there
[1:26:54] and say oh they must have an easy life
[1:26:58] or they couldn't act like that
[1:27:00] I want you to know that's never been the
[1:27:02] truth
[1:27:03] it's always appalling of Silence that
[1:27:06] Praises him
[1:27:07] it's always somebody that's been whipped
[1:27:09] and beaten knocked around slapped around
[1:27:11] talked about criticized condemned judged
[1:27:15] ostracized reject it come on
[1:27:18] they're the ones that have the highest
[1:27:20] praise
[1:27:21] they're sometimes the ones that have the
[1:27:23] loudest praise
[1:27:24] because they've understood the principle
[1:27:27] we don't wait for things to go good to
[1:27:30] give praise to God We Praise Him in
[1:27:32] Tribulation
[1:27:34] also knowing that tribulation is for a
[1:27:37] purpose
[1:27:38] it worketh patience
[1:27:40] I I advise you like the old-timers used
[1:27:43] to advise us I wouldn't pray for
[1:27:45] patience if I were you
[1:27:47] because they say that's praying for
[1:27:48] tribulation you don't have to pray for
[1:27:50] tribulation it's coming
[1:27:53] hardship is coming troubles trials are
[1:27:55] coming but through that if you learn the
[1:27:59] joy of praising God for who he is in
[1:28:03] spite of the storm in spite of the
[1:28:07] stripes and the bruises and the cuts you
[1:28:10] will understand that it's working
[1:28:12] patience in your life oh praise God
[1:28:15] let's go on
[1:28:18] and patience experience
[1:28:22] I I hear those uh I hear those and
[1:28:25] naysayers saying you know those those uh
[1:28:28] Full Gospel people Pentecostal people or
[1:28:31] sometimes message people they say that
[1:28:34] are always preaching about experience
[1:28:37] oh you you've got to have some
[1:28:39] experiences
[1:28:41] you've got to go through some things
[1:28:45] both in the negative
[1:28:47] create patience in us and you've also
[1:28:50] got to have some God encounters
[1:28:52] you remember folks God doesn't have any
[1:28:54] grandchildren
[1:28:56] you don't get in on Mama's Faith or
[1:28:58] Daddy's walk you must have your own
[1:29:01] born-again experience baptized in the
[1:29:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Sanctified
[1:29:07] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:29:09] filled with the walking talking Holy
[1:29:11] Ghost you must encounter God for
[1:29:14] yourself
[1:29:15] and experience coming through something
[1:29:18] getting to the other side of something
[1:29:21] and looking back over the hill all down
[1:29:24] through the valley where you've come it
[1:29:26] puts hope in you
[1:29:28] that if God has brought you thus far he
[1:29:32] will see you the rest of the way
[1:29:35] I'm persuaded
[1:29:37] that we can trust God to carry us all
[1:29:39] the way come on now
[1:29:42] I just love what I just love what what
[1:29:45] the psalmist said I was I was young once
[1:29:48] I'm an old man now
[1:29:49] I've seen some stuff I've been through
[1:29:52] some things but I've never seen the
[1:29:55] righteous
[1:29:56] whoo I've never seen the righteous
[1:29:59] forsaken I want you to say that I've
[1:30:02] never seen the righteous forsaken you
[1:30:05] won't ever see the righteous forsaken
[1:30:07] remembers sharing his righteousness that
[1:30:09] gives us any we wouldn't have any
[1:30:12] righteousness at all if he didn't share
[1:30:13] his with us
[1:30:15] one more
[1:30:17] form that gives you righteousness
[1:30:19] we don't do those things to get saved
[1:30:22] we don't do those things to stay saved
[1:30:25] we do those things because we have been
[1:30:27] saved and we want to shine his light to
[1:30:30] a lost and dark world around us so
[1:30:33] coming through some experiences both in
[1:30:36] the natural through hardship and and
[1:30:38] suffering and also in the positive
[1:30:41] through God encounters and experiences
[1:30:44] with the supernatural don't you ever
[1:30:46] lose hope and faith that God wants to
[1:30:50] give you something in the realm of the
[1:30:52] spirit in the Supernatural realm we are
[1:30:55] a supernatural people
[1:30:58] we were Supernatural before we were
[1:31:00] natural
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:03] we existed in the mind of God before we
[1:31:06] ever got into this body that's what the
[1:31:08] word said so we were Supernatural before
[1:31:11] we became natural and we really had to
[1:31:14] come down a long way to get in this
[1:31:16] natural body from being in the mind of
[1:31:18] God who'd want to come from the mind of
[1:31:20] God down into a natural body anyway but
[1:31:22] we had to because in him were the
[1:31:25] attributes of Redeemer and savior and
[1:31:28] heart regulator and deliverer and healer
[1:31:31] and he couldn't do any of that and
[1:31:33] express who he was had we not come here
[1:31:36] in a lost condition
[1:31:38] it is absolutely watch this it's
[1:31:41] absolutely his Delight
[1:31:43] it's absolutely the Lord's pleasure to
[1:31:45] bring you to him
[1:31:50] don't you love to eat when you're hungry
[1:31:54] some of us like to eat when we're not
[1:31:57] you there's just nothing like it you
[1:32:00] know
[1:32:01] brother Roger uh from the from the
[1:32:04] church up in LaGrange he he gets a lot
[1:32:07] of joy in cooking he looks a little
[1:32:09] stress sometime but he gets a little joy
[1:32:11] in cooking and and and and I love it I
[1:32:15] think he's a tremendous cook and a real
[1:32:16] servant and he come to the reception
[1:32:19] last night he walked behind and and he
[1:32:22] and well to be honest with you sister
[1:32:25] Anita had sent me a text and said you'll
[1:32:27] be real happy because brother Rogers
[1:32:28] doing the reception you'll stay I know
[1:32:30] you'll stay and eat eat with brother
[1:32:32] Roger
[1:32:34] so that's how she taught me into staying
[1:32:36] and he come by and he said it's better
[1:32:38] than usual brother Shelley I said well
[1:32:40] praise the Lord and he's always loading
[1:32:43] people up and sending them home more he
[1:32:44] gets a lot of pleasure in that and there
[1:32:47] are things you enjoy
[1:32:49] you enjoy some of you really enjoy
[1:32:52] gardening and some of you really enjoy
[1:32:54] watching the birds and you get joy out
[1:32:57] of working with your hands and being
[1:32:59] creative and and making balloon arches
[1:33:01] and and doing some of the things you
[1:33:03] people get pleasure from not just a job
[1:33:07] to you but I want you to know the Lord
[1:33:10] has pleasure the Lord has that sheer
[1:33:14] height in bringing you to himself oh he
[1:33:18] loves it and and I don't just mean once
[1:33:20] in Salvation I mean he just keeps wooing
[1:33:23] us hallelujah he just keeps
[1:33:28] into a closer relationship with him and
[1:33:31] every time you say yes every time you
[1:33:33] say yes Lord I will I'll draw closer
[1:33:36] I'll come closer I'll lay down some
[1:33:39] things that are hindrances oh my dear
[1:33:41] I'll straighten up some of my decision
[1:33:43] making Lord I'll come closer it just
[1:33:47] gives him so much pleasure and so much
[1:33:50] delight and God has been so good to give
[1:33:53] us so many beautiful things in our life
[1:33:54] doesn't it make you feel good when you
[1:33:56] think about being able to give him
[1:33:58] something back
[1:34:01] it got rebuked one time because I was
[1:34:03] always talking about blessing the Lord
[1:34:06] and one streamer many years ago wrote in
[1:34:09] and said I don't know what would make
[1:34:10] anybody thinking little peon-created
[1:34:13] creatures
[1:34:15] could bless the Lord
[1:34:17] and I said you clearly don't understand
[1:34:19] Redemption
[1:34:21] I just answered a little hostile
[1:34:23] you clearly don't understand even the
[1:34:26] psalmist talked to his own self
[1:34:29] and he said Soul mine will and emotions
[1:34:32] I want you to bless the Lord I want you
[1:34:36] to worship God when you praise him you
[1:34:39] bless him you bring him pleasure you
[1:34:42] bring him to light oh bless the Lord O
[1:34:46] my soul and all all that is within me
[1:34:51] he's been so good blessed His holy name
[1:34:54] so yes even you and I bring him blessing
[1:34:58] cause him to smile I love that we better
[1:35:01] read patience experience and experience
[1:35:03] hope
[1:35:06] next verse
[1:35:08] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[1:35:13] love of God is shared abroad in our
[1:35:16] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:35:20] unto us
[1:35:22] you know you can't really fathom the
[1:35:25] love of God until you have the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost
[1:35:28] and you know I preach it pretty rough I
[1:35:31] preach you're not fully born again until
[1:35:32] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:34] Ghost I believe that
[1:35:36] I believe it's that important I believe
[1:35:38] being baptized in the name of Jesus is
[1:35:40] that important I believe receiving the
[1:35:42] Holy Ghost is that important I don't
[1:35:44] believe the new birth is finished
[1:35:46] because in a natural birth there's water
[1:35:49] blood
[1:35:51] and in life
[1:35:53] that life that you get is when the Holy
[1:35:55] Ghost comes and so according to this
[1:35:57] scripture you can't fully fathom
[1:35:59] appreciate or understand the love of God
[1:36:02] until the Holy Ghost
[1:36:05] causes it to be shed abroad he causes it
[1:36:08] to be multiplied and Amplified and
[1:36:12] illuminated in your life and then you
[1:36:14] say oh the love of God all the love of
[1:36:18] God and here's what's beautiful the Holy
[1:36:21] Ghost never just makes truth Universal
[1:36:23] when you receive the Holy Ghost he makes
[1:36:26] truth personal
[1:36:29] and when that personal revelation of
[1:36:32] Truth strikes your heart nobody no
[1:36:35] preacher no Theologian no atheist
[1:36:39] no humanist no school teacher or college
[1:36:43] professor will ever be able to talk you
[1:36:46] out of the love of God because the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost
[1:36:51] has caused it to be shed abroad in your
[1:36:54] heart let's read on I got a lot of
[1:36:56] verses to get to for when we were yet
[1:36:58] without strength
[1:37:00] in due time
[1:37:02] Christ died for the ungodly don't you
[1:37:07] ever forget
[1:37:10] that they who are whole
[1:37:12] need not a physician
[1:37:16] it's those who are sick it's those who
[1:37:19] are broken and the Bible tells us that
[1:37:22] we were all born in sin
[1:37:25] in iniquity came into this world
[1:37:27] speaking lies I don't have to give you
[1:37:30] the example your parents
[1:37:34] you know what amazing children you have
[1:37:36] you know they're nearly perfect
[1:37:39] but they come here lying
[1:37:43] someone said well that's abusive you
[1:37:44] shouldn't say anything like that well
[1:37:46] it's the truth
[1:37:47] nobody has to do well he lies because
[1:37:49] his mama lied his daddy lied oh nobody
[1:37:52] had to lie in front of them
[1:37:54] they come with a fallen nature
[1:37:58] you you just they'll be standing there
[1:38:00] with a cookie in one hand
[1:38:02] crumbs on the chin
[1:38:05] pile of crumbs on the floor and chewing
[1:38:09] and you said to him did you take that
[1:38:10] cookie I told you you'd had enough
[1:38:12] cookies you didn't get another cookie
[1:38:14] did you no ma'am
[1:38:19] no ma'am
[1:38:20] come on who taught them that
[1:38:23] it's the scripture fulfilled they're
[1:38:27] shaping an iniquity formed in this kind
[1:38:29] of Fallen condition and come forth into
[1:38:32] this world speaking lies but Jesus came
[1:38:36] to find the ungodly to find the Fallen
[1:38:39] of Adam's race
[1:38:40] and to redeem them from the from the sin
[1:38:44] of the fall all the way back to the
[1:38:47] original thought that God had about you
[1:38:50] in the beginning when God thought about
[1:38:52] you in the beginning you were perfect
[1:38:54] you were holy you were righteous you
[1:38:58] were in His image
[1:39:00] you've been fighting your whole life to
[1:39:03] get back to what God thought about you
[1:39:04] in the beginning give
[1:39:06] in church
[1:39:08] keep on running this race
[1:39:11] don't you give up now
[1:39:13] I'm holding back here little
[1:39:15] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:39:18] one die yet per adventure for a good man
[1:39:22] somewhat even Dare To Die
[1:39:24] but God commendeth his love toward us in
[1:39:28] that while we were yet sinners
[1:39:34] he knew how rotten we were
[1:39:38] before we were ever born
[1:39:40] he knew our addictions
[1:39:44] you see I I'm I'm a few things I won't
[1:39:47] budge on one of them is sovereignty
[1:39:50] God is Sovereign and if you get a
[1:39:53] revelation of the sovereignty of God you
[1:39:55] don't ever have to say something like if
[1:39:57] if he would have had a better doctor
[1:39:59] he'd still be here
[1:40:04] if they were to give him that expensive
[1:40:06] medicine he'd still be alive
[1:40:08] that's not sovereignty talking
[1:40:11] that's not understand the standing the
[1:40:13] sovereignty of God now we make choices
[1:40:16] and there are repercussions for our
[1:40:18] choices but none of that changes the
[1:40:20] sovereignty of God you can have the
[1:40:22] lousiest doctor in the world in the
[1:40:24] dirtiest nastiest Hospital in the world
[1:40:26] taking the best medicine the world has
[1:40:28] ever given and close your eyes and die
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:32] because precious in the sight of the
[1:40:34] Lord waiting
[1:40:36] valuable in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:40:39] death of the Saints all of our days
[1:40:41] written in his book before we were even
[1:40:43] formed in our mother's womb and so your
[1:40:46] days are already numbered I don't want
[1:40:48] to upset you but you God's already got
[1:40:50] the last day your last day written and
[1:40:52] recorded
[1:40:54] for some of us it may be sooner than
[1:40:56] others but the truth is the reality is
[1:40:59] before we come here every day is already
[1:41:01] recorded in God's book you know so it
[1:41:03] don't matter about the doctor doesn't
[1:41:05] matter about the medicine no matter well
[1:41:06] if I if he'd just went don't you hear
[1:41:08] this one all the time if he'd just got
[1:41:10] it checked out sooner
[1:41:13] don't you think God could have done the
[1:41:15] prodding don't you think especially the
[1:41:17] righteous the children of God don't you
[1:41:19] believe a prophecy could have come a
[1:41:20] dream could have come don't you believe
[1:41:22] that God could have pushed that person
[1:41:23] toward doing something for themselves
[1:41:27] it always gets quiet when you preach
[1:41:29] sovereignty
[1:41:32] but I believe what the word said
[1:41:35] I believe God knows everything he
[1:41:38] doesn't always interfere
[1:41:40] but he has the power to interfere
[1:41:42] because he knew it before it ever
[1:41:44] happened I gotta hurry God commended his
[1:41:46] love toward us and that while we were
[1:41:48] yet sinners Christ died for us let's go
[1:41:50] on much more than being now Justified
[1:41:55] by his blood
[1:41:58] we shall be saved from Wrath
[1:42:01] through him
[1:42:03] now now why are we on this subject and
[1:42:05] I'm not done reading that but can we put
[1:42:07] up another verse even though I'm not
[1:42:09] through with those Romans 8 29 and 30 is
[1:42:12] where we are for these last few weeks
[1:42:14] for whom he did for
[1:42:21] eign
[1:42:22] you hear people around the church
[1:42:24] churches say I don't believe in
[1:42:26] predestination it don't matter what you
[1:42:28] believe
[1:42:31] you think that matters
[1:42:33] you think that changes God's word
[1:42:37] even brother Branham called it kind of a
[1:42:39] curse word in the church when you use
[1:42:41] the word predestinated I use it because
[1:42:43] the Bible said it
[1:42:45] but you must understand that
[1:42:48] predestination is always based on
[1:42:51] foreknowledge
[1:42:55] you had a choice
[1:42:59] God knew your choice before you ever
[1:43:03] made it
[1:43:04] but you had a choice
[1:43:07] and because he saw you making that
[1:43:10] choice he gave you a destiny
[1:43:14] that's what the word I'm just reading
[1:43:15] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:43:19] go ahead and say that ugly word
[1:43:22] predestinate to be conformed whoa
[1:43:26] I tell you my destiny
[1:43:30] Destiny is to be conformed to the image
[1:43:32] of his son
[1:43:36] it's like he
[1:43:37] [Applause]
[1:43:40] here win winner
[1:43:42] when our troubles and trials
[1:43:45] we'll soon be done with Temptations and
[1:43:48] tests will soon be done with all of the
[1:43:51] heartaches troubles and trials of life
[1:43:55] we're one day going to sit down with
[1:43:58] King Jesus
[1:43:59] Chic glad hands with the elders and tell
[1:44:02] my Kindred good morning
[1:44:05] scroll down Glory Boulevard with Isaiah
[1:44:09] Amaya and the prophets of old
[1:44:13] and our lifetime at the feet of King
[1:44:15] Jesus
[1:44:16] serving him and worshiping him come on
[1:44:18] down
[1:44:19] and when I leave this world of Sorrow
[1:44:22] you need to know this I'm leaving here
[1:44:24] just like him
[1:44:28] my destiny according to God's
[1:44:31] foreknowledge of me he pre-assigned
[1:44:34] he prefixed me a destiny
[1:44:37] and that Destiny is revealed in
[1:44:39] Scripture
[1:44:40] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:44:43] that he
[1:44:46] might be the firstborn
[1:44:48] among many brethren
[1:44:50] you see Jesus passed the test
[1:44:54] uh sister Anna
[1:44:56] Hodges who's not here away for the
[1:44:59] wedding
[1:45:01] is she does most of our social media now
[1:45:05] and what I mean that I don't mean the
[1:45:07] moments that's Hawks department and the
[1:45:10] website RJ's Department
[1:45:12] but she does the
[1:45:14] memes and the and the graphics and the
[1:45:18] and the reels
[1:45:21] and
[1:45:22] they get a lot of traffic
[1:45:26] you just recently posted one she takes
[1:45:28] them from sermons
[1:45:29] even the memes are taken from sermons
[1:45:32] and sermon notes and scriptures and
[1:45:33] things that inspire
[1:45:35] and she mentioned in one of them
[1:45:37] yesterday or recently
[1:45:39] I miss them sometime
[1:45:41] and have to find them later
[1:45:44] she mentioned about laying down our
[1:45:46] rights
[1:45:47] that some of the things like
[1:45:48] unforgiveness I I don't remember exactly
[1:45:51] what he said could somebody find it for
[1:45:53] me you bring your phone to church with
[1:45:55] you just like it's your Bible
[1:45:57] so you might as well use it somebody
[1:45:59] find that for me would you
[1:46:01] find that for me I I don't want to I've
[1:46:04] got too many people greeting me here God
[1:46:06] bless every one of you in the
[1:46:08] Netherlands Indiana
[1:46:10] Canada
[1:46:12] Ontario Canada Kenya uh
[1:46:17] oh my so many
[1:46:20] so many here South Africa England
[1:46:25] some I don't Morocco
[1:46:27] in that wonderful
[1:46:29] Morocco
[1:46:31] and I don't I can't even see where some
[1:46:33] did anybody find it
[1:46:38] often pride is at the root
[1:46:42] of our unforgiveness
[1:46:44] anger
[1:46:46] bitterness now what did the before that
[1:46:48] not on the picture but the description
[1:46:50] what did the description say
[1:46:57] Pride tells us that we have the right to
[1:47:02] hold on to our unforgiveness our
[1:47:04] bitterness our anger
[1:47:07] the gospel tells us
[1:47:11] that we have given up every right
[1:47:17] as we choose to yield Our Lives to
[1:47:20] Christ and a precious friend of mine
[1:47:22] wrote on there where does the bible say
[1:47:24] that
[1:47:27] and I love my friend and she may be
[1:47:29] watching and I love her but there I
[1:47:32] started looking for I thought I can't
[1:47:34] it'd take me an hour and a half
[1:47:37] I can't just give one verse it would
[1:47:40] take me an hour and a half to tell you
[1:47:43] what the New Testament says about laying
[1:47:45] down your eyes
[1:47:47] but here is the summary let me give you
[1:47:50] the little little summary of it all
[1:47:52] Jesus is our example
[1:47:55] he gave up every ride he ever had
[1:47:59] he left the Splendor of Heaven
[1:48:03] the deity that was within him the
[1:48:06] kingdom The Authority the throne he left
[1:48:11] it all to condescene
[1:48:14] and he entered into this world and he
[1:48:16] laid down his rights to speak up for
[1:48:18] himself
[1:48:19] to defend himself LED like a sheep to
[1:48:23] the slaughter uh yeah the uttered not
[1:48:26] his word the accuser stood there and
[1:48:29] lied against him and he never said one
[1:48:32] time that is not the truth
[1:48:34] when they finally peeled him pinned him
[1:48:38] down all he could say was I am he
[1:48:43] he couldn't deny who he was
[1:48:46] and he
[1:48:49] 'd Eat to Live
[1:48:51] he gave up his right to be married
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:57] to have children
[1:49:00] somebody said well that wouldn't be much
[1:49:01] of a privilege if you're God you forget
[1:49:03] who he was
[1:49:05] I know some people out there under this
[1:49:07] false impression that he was 50 God and
[1:49:10] 50 man but that's not what the word my
[1:49:13] word the Bible I read doesn't teach me
[1:49:15] that he was half God and half man
[1:49:17] somebody said what in the world was a
[1:49:19] hundred percent God
[1:49:21] and 100 man
[1:49:25] because if you're under the other
[1:49:27] delusion you probably think marriage is
[1:49:29] 50 50.
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:33] help me preach somebody
[1:49:37] God is not 50 50. he's a hundred hundred
[1:49:42] he was a hundred percent God when he
[1:49:45] cried out come out of that grave Lazarus
[1:49:48] he was a hundred percent man when he
[1:49:50] slept in the bow of the boat
[1:49:52] he was a hundred percent God when he
[1:49:55] stepped up and spoke to peace be still
[1:49:57] it just kept turning over and over he
[1:49:59] was always God always man so he gave up
[1:50:02] the Bible said in fact then he was
[1:50:03] tempted and every manner like we are
[1:50:07] he was tempted by lust
[1:50:12] yet without sin he was our example in
[1:50:16] all things marriage is not 50 50.
[1:50:22] not a successful one
[1:50:24] it's a hundred one hundred
[1:50:27] some have never had a successful
[1:50:29] marriage
[1:50:33] because they've never been a hundred
[1:50:37] a hundred and a hundred it takes giving
[1:50:40] everything oh yes
[1:50:43] and if it took that in the 50s what do
[1:50:45] you think it takes 2020s
[1:50:49] well we could just change the math it
[1:50:52] takes 200 percent
[1:50:55] it's giving everything
[1:50:58] it's hard
[1:50:59] s our rights but as Christian we cannot
[1:51:03] hold on to our rights to be angry
[1:51:08] we gotta let it go
[1:51:10] is it oh you said it's easy no sir
[1:51:14] bitterness isn't is is hot
[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:19] you let a root of bitterness get in you
[1:51:22] and it'll become a tree and your it'll
[1:51:24] there'll be a tree sticking out of you
[1:51:27] bitterness don't stay in root form it
[1:51:30] takes on all kinds of form it grows it
[1:51:32] flourishes you've got to cut that thing
[1:51:34] at the root you can't cut the top of the
[1:51:36] tree a bitterness often expect it to die
[1:51:38] it'll come back again and again and
[1:51:40] again again you've got to let the word
[1:51:42] of God
[1:51:43] I'm preaching to somebody
[1:51:45] you've got to let the word of God go
[1:51:47] down there and lay the ax to the root of
[1:51:49] that thing and it's going to hurt coming
[1:51:51] out
[1:51:53] where you're preaching so hard yeah it's
[1:51:55] going to hurt coming out
[1:51:57] when God removes that root of bitterness
[1:51:59] out of your life it hurts coming out
[1:52:01] it's like it's worse than a surgery it's
[1:52:03] probably like giving birth
[1:52:06] that thing is pulling on everything
[1:52:08] you've had you've been holding on to
[1:52:10] that and you cannot we can't hold on to
[1:52:13] anger we can't hold on to unforgiveness
[1:52:15] we have to lay it down our example laid
[1:52:18] down all of his right somebody said I
[1:52:21] can't really believe that Jesus wanted
[1:52:23] to live
[1:52:24] and and the life he was living on Earth
[1:52:26] and and if he did
[1:52:29] uh then then I mean if he could not do
[1:52:33] that if if he didn't want to live is
[1:52:35] what I'm trying to say I'll get it in a
[1:52:36] minute some some people have a struggle
[1:52:39] believing that Jesus was giving up
[1:52:42] anything when he surrendered to the
[1:52:45] Cross but I want you to know because he
[1:52:48] was a hundred percent man he enjoyed the
[1:52:50] life that he was living here on Earth
[1:52:52] and he was willing to lay that down
[1:52:54] no greater love hath any man than this
[1:52:57] that he's willing to die willing to lay
[1:53:00] down his life for someone else for his
[1:53:02] friends not just his family
[1:53:05] the Bible said while we were yet sinners
[1:53:08] while we were ungodly way before we
[1:53:10] deserved him but here's how I know that
[1:53:13] he didn't want to change his presidency
[1:53:15] state
[1:53:15] because of what he prayed in the garden
[1:53:21] he prayed it in the garden the the
[1:53:23] spirit is willing
[1:53:25] the god part of who I am is willing but
[1:53:29] the man part of who I am is weak
[1:53:31] and he's struggling under the law if at
[1:53:34] all possible
[1:53:36] if there's any other way he wasn't given
[1:53:39] up on us
[1:53:40] he said if there's any other way
[1:53:43] let this cup pass from me but the
[1:53:45] old-timers used to tell me the sweetest
[1:53:47] words ever spoken
[1:53:50] nevertheless
[1:53:52] not my will
[1:53:54] but your will be done he struggled in
[1:53:57] that agonizing prayer until great spots
[1:53:59] of blood begin to pour through the sweat
[1:54:02] that give away and drops of blood uh the
[1:54:05] the the very organs of his body were
[1:54:07] already rupturing before he ever went to
[1:54:09] the cross
[1:54:10] there's a possibility that that the the
[1:54:12] the the the
[1:54:14] fluid around his heart was already
[1:54:16] leaking through because of the agony and
[1:54:19] the stress it's per it's perhaps in that
[1:54:22] moment of great Agony blood vessels were
[1:54:24] bursting in his body already under the
[1:54:27] agony of what was coming
[1:54:30] the Mind battle you talk about mind
[1:54:32] battles he had them too
[1:54:35] all manner
[1:54:36] he had them too
[1:54:39] and and look at his
[1:54:41] Inner Circle
[1:54:42] are you in me
[1:54:44] what were they doing
[1:54:46] sleeping
[1:54:53] sometime here on Sunday morning I get in
[1:54:55] that mood I feel it I feel it
[1:55:01] I just want to look at some of you I
[1:55:03] really want to throw a song back at you
[1:55:08] and I want to say won't you Tarry
[1:55:12] when
[1:55:13] it's already our two usually by then
[1:55:15] what's your Taryn
[1:55:19] body was rat with pain
[1:55:22] and yet he said nevertheless not my will
[1:55:25] but thy will be done he laid down
[1:55:27] everything and we're going to have to
[1:55:28] lay it down to be conformed to the image
[1:55:30] of his son for whom he did for know he
[1:55:33] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:55:35] image of his son that he might be the
[1:55:37] firstborn among many Brethren there's
[1:55:39] some more coming I'm one of them that's
[1:55:41] coming he was the firstborn of a
[1:55:43] righteous fully adopted son Hallelujah
[1:55:46] but there's coming a generation oh yes
[1:55:50] oh yes
[1:55:52] give me the next verse excuse me just a
[1:55:54] moment
[1:55:57] more moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:56:01] then he also called
[1:56:04] and whom he called then he also
[1:56:08] Justified remember how they used to say
[1:56:11] just if I'd never sinned
[1:56:17] that's not covering sin
[1:56:21] the blood of bulls and goats and Lambs
[1:56:23] covered sin in the mind of God
[1:56:26] it was the plan of God for a season
[1:56:28] but his blood did more than cover your
[1:56:30] sin his blood so far removed your sin
[1:56:34] from you Hallelujah
[1:56:38] that it was remitted
[1:56:40] forevermore
[1:56:42] and whom he justified read it read the
[1:56:44] rest
[1:56:46] then we also glorified go back to Romans
[1:56:48] 5 for me charity and I'm I'm going to

[1:57:08] he and you and
[1:57:10] Carter know how to hurry
[1:57:13] I don't know sometimes I'll look at you
[1:57:15] and you Lumber
[1:57:22] you notice children lumbering these days
[1:57:25] don't get upset with me parents

[1:57:50] be like everybody else's but I'm
[1:57:51] hurrying right now
[1:57:54] give me verse uh verse 8 again verse 9
[1:57:59] excuse me verse 9. more more much more
[1:58:03] than being now justified by his blood
[1:58:07] just if I'd never sinned we shall be
[1:58:10] saved from Wrath
[1:58:12] through him
[1:58:16] there's a new trend in charismatic
[1:58:18] Christianity
[1:58:20] I don't know how much is spilling over
[1:58:22] into the Pentecostal world
[1:58:23] I lose track of those camps sometime
[1:58:27] but there's a new trend among the
[1:58:29] charismatic world that they're preaching
[1:58:32] that the the the bride or the church
[1:58:35] will will go through the tribulation
[1:58:39] and and I want you to know they're right
[1:58:45] there is a church
[1:58:48] there is a church it will
[1:58:52] I remember I'm not talking about
[1:58:53] building now
[1:58:55] don't you think I'm talking about a
[1:58:56] building
[1:58:57] there is a church that doesn't have the
[1:58:59] whole truth
[1:59:00] and the Bible said they're going through
[1:59:02] the tribulation to cleanse the spots on
[1:59:04] their garments that's what the Bible
[1:59:06] said
[1:59:07] amen so those that don't have the
[1:59:09] godhead like the scripture has it
[1:59:11] and the baptism like the scripture has
[1:59:13] it many of them are going to miss the
[1:59:17] rapture
[1:59:18] that's what the Bible teaches they're
[1:59:21] going to prove their love for Christ in
[1:59:24] the tribulation
[1:59:26] the Bible said laying their head on a
[1:59:28] chopping block
[1:59:31] somebody said the holy spirit will give
[1:59:33] them the strength excuse me for my voice
[1:59:35] they said the Holy Ghost the holy spirit
[1:59:38] will give them strength to do that not
[1:59:39] so
[1:59:41] because the Holy Spirit leaves planet
[1:59:43] Earth
[1:59:44] when the bride Church leaves
[1:59:47] Holy Ghost goes wither
[1:59:50] somebody said how do you know because
[1:59:52] the scripture said so
[1:59:54] but now let it will land until he be
[1:59:56] taken out of the way referring to the
[1:59:58] Holy Spirit that's the restrainer did
[2:00:01] you know that if it were not for the
[2:00:03] presence of the holy spirit in the Earth
[2:00:04] today the whole world around us would be
[2:00:06] totally insane
[2:00:09] I could have said that to some folks 10
[2:00:12] years ago they wouldn't have grasped it
[2:00:14] but in 2023
[2:00:16] people can grasp that a little bit
[2:00:18] easier because they see the insanity
[2:00:20] around them
[2:00:25] I watched a discussion
[2:00:27] online this week concerning gender
[2:00:30] dysphoria
[2:00:33] and confusion
[2:00:35] and I saw a little woman standing up
[2:00:39] an educator and not a conservative by
[2:00:42] any means
[2:00:43] but standing up
[2:00:45] for her uh thoughts and opinions
[2:00:49] on waiting
[2:00:51] before presenting this kind of
[2:00:53] information to children
[2:00:56] because there was a panel there that
[2:00:59] wanted children to be presented with the
[2:01:02] idea of gender dysphoria at age four
[2:01:10] I'd like to know I want you to know I'm
[2:01:12] not going to call any names
[2:01:14] but I want you to know there are some
[2:01:16] girls around here
[2:01:18] that look like ladies
[2:01:20] this morning
[2:01:22] that were kind of tomboyish
[2:01:25] when they were girls they took their
[2:01:28] skirts in climbed a tree
[2:01:32] aren't you glad somebody didn't sit them
[2:01:35] down at four
[2:01:38] I hope you'll help me
[2:01:41] aren't you glad somebody didn't sit him
[2:01:43] down in four and say now you know you
[2:01:44] may not really be a girl
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:47] that is what they want to do and they're
[2:01:50] no no no it's what they're doing
[2:01:53] in public schools
[2:01:55] and here was this lone educator that
[2:01:58] said at least
[2:02:00] at least wait until they're 12 years old
[2:02:03] they laughed at her
[2:02:06] they laughed at her they made fun of her
[2:02:08] she was an expert in her field not a
[2:02:10] conservative not a born-again Christian
[2:02:13] she said at least
[2:02:15] just before puberty
[2:02:18] I I could I could allow something like
[2:02:20] that but please
[2:02:24] don't fight and they vowed to her we're
[2:02:26] going to keep fighting we're going to
[2:02:27] fight until every four-year-old is
[2:02:29] presented
[2:02:31] where the unicorn toy
[2:02:34] that has both
[2:02:36] parts
[2:02:41] we're gonna keep fighting until this
[2:02:43] curriculum
[2:02:45] is brought to all the schools preschool
[2:02:48] and if there's not a preschool program
[2:02:50] kindergarten five-year-old
[2:02:52] and we're going to show this little dog
[2:02:55] and we're going to explain to the
[2:02:57] children that sometimes
[2:03:01] a lady told Stacey and I a Godly Holy
[2:03:04] Ghost Phil Pentecostal woman
[2:03:07] from another state told us
[2:03:10] Friday night
[2:03:12] that she recently met
[2:03:14] someone that she hadn't seen since her
[2:03:16] childhood
[2:03:18] and got a hurry to tell this
[2:03:21] but
[2:03:22] she said to him what
[2:03:26] you're a boy
[2:03:29] are you a boy or a girl he said I'm a
[2:03:32] boy
[2:03:33] she said uh
[2:03:36] she said I I hadn't seen him in so many
[2:03:39] years
[2:03:40] and she said I'm remembering that when
[2:03:43] we were all in church together
[2:03:45] my nephew used to make fun of this
[2:03:48] person
[2:03:49] because they said that was one of the
[2:03:52] ugliest little girls they had ever seen
[2:03:55] in the dress
[2:03:57] she said we got on to our children our
[2:04:00] nephew don't you say that about her
[2:04:03] and come to find out he began to tell
[2:04:05] his story
[2:04:06] his mother in the church
[2:04:09] of God in Christ in the church
[2:04:13] wanted a little girl
[2:04:16] so it didn't matter his Plumbing
[2:04:19] it's quiet in here
[2:04:22] they dressed him in a skirt
[2:04:24] and told him he was a girl
[2:04:29] and for years he went through the shame
[2:04:31] of being the ugliest girl in the class
[2:04:34] and the ugliest girl in the church
[2:04:36] because he wasn't born to be a girl
[2:04:38] he was born to be a boy
[2:04:40] and he said when he got out from under
[2:04:42] that and you know what her question was
[2:04:43] she said what about the preacher
[2:04:47] what about the pastor in that church
[2:04:52] what about those that knew what kind of
[2:04:55] child that woman had given birth to did
[2:04:57] they just turn their head
[2:04:59] that's what they do
[2:05:01] and watch them dress him up in a skirt
[2:05:05] folks
[2:05:07] we're living in perilous times
[2:05:10] the church cannot compromise
[2:05:15] we must not compromise
[2:05:21] this generation must know the word
[2:05:26] we must not budge from it
[2:05:31] no matter what
[2:05:33] so much confusion out there so much and
[2:05:36] let me tell you something it would be
[2:05:39] totally insane
[2:05:40] if the bride church was gone
[2:05:43] because the Holy Ghost is leaving with
[2:05:45] her the Bible said some are not
[2:05:47] appointed unto wrath I want you to know
[2:05:48] I am one of those
[2:05:52] I'm one of those not opponent that
[2:05:54] around doesn't mean I'm not going to
[2:05:55] have some hardship doesn't mean there
[2:05:57] won't be perilous times troubles and
[2:05:59] trials but what it means is you're not
[2:06:01] going to live the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:06:03] is not going to live through the darkest
[2:06:05] part of that tribulation he's coming the
[2:06:07] bridegroom is coming to take his bride
[2:06:11] the scripture even says here we shall be
[2:06:15] saved from Wrath
[2:06:18] through him
[2:06:21] for if when we were enemies we were
[2:06:23] reconciled to God by the death of his
[2:06:25] son much more being reconciled we shall
[2:06:28] be saved by his life
[2:06:31] I I don't mean to offend anybody
[2:06:34] who has family that struggles or has a
[2:06:37] loved one who who's confused
[2:06:40] but I will be honest with you and tell
[2:06:42] you that sometimes the confusion can end
[2:06:45] if a demon is cast out
[2:06:50] but the the society and the psychiatrist
[2:06:54] has scared parents
[2:06:59] into thinking that if you if you make
[2:07:01] them mad they get worse
[2:07:03] well sometimes there has to be a little
[2:07:05] provoking
[2:07:06] to get them in the right atmosphere
[2:07:08] where the demon can be cast out because
[2:07:10] I want you to know something the the
[2:07:12] regret
[2:07:14] one of the experts in this discussion
[2:07:16] that I was watching one of the experts
[2:07:18] says there are hundreds of thousands of
[2:07:22] testimonies now I have no idea I didn't
[2:07:24] search it I don't intend to search it
[2:07:27] there are hundreds of thousands of
[2:07:30] testimonies online from people that have
[2:07:32] made the full transition
[2:07:35] and who have been suicidal who have
[2:07:38] become addicts who have so regretted
[2:07:41] some have marched back to the doctor
[2:07:43] some have killed the doctor
[2:07:47] can you imagine
[2:07:49] some have gone back to reap Vengeance on
[2:07:52] the teachers and counselors and family
[2:07:55] members
[2:07:57] who push them
[2:07:59] into that direction
[2:08:04] so I want you to know we pray we pray I
[2:08:07] do pray I have I have compassion for
[2:08:10] someone who's Fallen under the confusion
[2:08:12] of this age but this bride's got to stay
[2:08:15] clear of that and we have to make a
[2:08:17] stand
[2:08:19] we have to make a stand we've got to
[2:08:21] make it fast
[2:08:23] we have to be careful who our children
[2:08:24] are with
[2:08:27] I know that sound I know I know I know
[2:08:29] there's somebody out there disconnecting
[2:08:31] the stream go ahead God bless you
[2:08:32] goodbye
[2:08:33] come see us again when I'm on a nicer
[2:08:36] subject
[2:08:38] but it's the truth
[2:08:40] these things are these Spirits somebody
[2:08:42] said well that's not contagious no but
[2:08:43] Spirits are
[2:08:46] just a minute amen pastor
[2:08:52] I just had some time help myself
[2:08:54] for if when we were enemies we were
[2:08:57] reconciled to God by the death of his
[2:08:59] son much more being reconciled we shall
[2:09:01] be saved by his life oh that's good news
[2:09:04] let's come back to the good news and not
[2:09:06] only so and I I'm I'm moving now and not
[2:09:09] only so but we also Joy in God through
[2:09:13] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have
[2:09:15] now received the atonement wherefore is
[2:09:18] by one man sinner sin entered into the
[2:09:20] world and death by sin and so death
[2:09:23] passed upon all men for that all have
[2:09:25] sinned for until the law sin was in the
[2:09:29] world but sin is not imputed
[2:09:32] where there is no law nevertheless death
[2:09:35] reigned from Adam to Moses even over
[2:09:37] them that had not sinned after the
[2:09:39] similitude of Adam's transgression who
[2:09:41] is the figure of him that was to come
[2:09:43] even before willful sin became a part of
[2:09:46] your life you by by the Fallen race of
[2:09:48] Adam you already had transgression you
[2:09:51] already had a need of a redeemer amen
[2:09:54] let's go on verse 15 but not is the
[2:09:57] offense so also is the free gift for if
[2:09:59] through the offense of one many be dead
[2:10:01] much more the grace of God and the gift
[2:10:04] by Grace which is by one man Jesus
[2:10:07] Christ Christ hath abounded unto
[2:10:10] unto many a few more verses
[2:10:13] and not as it was by one that sinned so
[2:10:16] is the gift for the Judgment was by one
[2:10:20] to condemnation but the free gift is of
[2:10:23] many offenses
[2:10:26] unto justification put them all in there
[2:10:32] they're covered
[2:10:34] I'm not leaving here today planning on
[2:10:36] sinning
[2:10:38] I'm not I'm not making any any way I I'm
[2:10:41] not making any plan to go do those
[2:10:43] things because I pray that I've pushed
[2:10:46] unbelief out of my life because unbelief
[2:10:48] is what pushes us to those kind of
[2:10:50] behaviors and activities anyway we
[2:10:52] preach that sin is really unbelief and
[2:10:55] all these other things are the
[2:10:56] attributes of unbelief I'm not planning
[2:10:58] to do that but I want you to know that
[2:10:59] if I Should Fall by the way
[2:11:01] because many have
[2:11:03] I want you to know that if I should lose
[2:11:05] my way those sins that unbelief is also
[2:11:09] covered
[2:11:13] boy you Pentecostals don't get very loud
[2:11:15] about that do they
[2:11:17] you better hope it's true
[2:11:20] because there's people sitting in this
[2:11:22] room today that are on try three
[2:11:26] or try four
[2:11:30] started out to serve the Lord ended up
[2:11:32] serving self
[2:11:34] came back to God
[2:11:37] went out and served self some more
[2:11:39] came back and served God God saw that
[2:11:43] are you saying there's no hope of course
[2:11:46] I'm not saying such a thing
[2:11:48] you've been welcomed into the family of
[2:11:50] God because you always were a part of
[2:11:52] him
[2:11:53] you talk about confusion you were the
[2:11:56] one confused it wasn't gender confusion
[2:11:59] it was it was spiritual amnesia
[2:12:04] you forgot who you were
[2:12:06] and you came back and I want you to know
[2:12:09] may you never may you never stray again
[2:12:11] no you never fall by the wayside again
[2:12:13] God hope holds you and keep you because
[2:12:16] the hour is getting dark but if you
[2:12:19] should
[2:12:21] and you're a part of him there's a
[2:12:24] father standing With Arms Wide Open that
[2:12:28] says you are mine
[2:12:32] I will never leave you I will never
[2:12:36] forsake you how many of you are glad
[2:12:38] there's a way back
[2:12:40] whoa
[2:12:45] I sat out there on the platform brother
[2:12:49] may be listening today and
[2:12:53] if he is my heart and my prayers are
[2:12:56] with you both
[2:12:58] today I know is a very sad anniversary
[2:13:01] and I've already sent you a note to let
[2:13:03] you know I was thinking about you
[2:13:06] but I sat out there on the platform
[2:13:08] in Tucson
[2:13:10] at uh Harmony
[2:13:12] there was a beautiful young lady
[2:13:15] one that I care about
[2:13:18] who was singing a beautiful song
[2:13:20] about being home or coming back home or
[2:13:23] being back
[2:13:25] being back where you belong
[2:13:27] and something so moved me
[2:13:30] I knew she wasn't serving the lord to
[2:13:33] the best of her ability it was obvious
[2:13:37] but there was something that moved over
[2:13:40] me as she sung that song she sat down I
[2:13:43] took her by the hand and I said it's
[2:13:45] never too late there's no place like
[2:13:48] home
[2:13:50] I want you to look at your neighbor and
[2:13:51] tell him right now there's no place like
[2:13:53] home come back to Papa
[2:13:56] let's let's Don't Preach it let's Don't
[2:13:59] Preach it in such a way that people miss
[2:14:02] the idea
[2:14:03] that if they fall they're they're
[2:14:05] they're they're you know hopeless
[2:14:09] let's preach it in such a way that
[2:14:12] people will know he's always willing
[2:14:16] he is not willing that any should perish
[2:14:19] but that all should come
[2:14:25] but don't do like brother Josh's song
[2:14:27] Don't Waste Your Grace
[2:14:30] take advantage
[2:14:33] take advantage of your grace
[2:14:36] today
[2:14:38] let's let's go on
[2:14:42] did I read this verse yet
[2:14:44] let's go on to the next verse if we can
[2:14:50] we have a few more 17. for If by one
[2:14:54] man's offense death reigned by one much
[2:14:57] more they which receive abundance of
[2:14:58] Grace and of the gift of righteousness
[2:15:01] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[2:15:06] therefore by as by the offense of one
[2:15:10] judgment Came Upon all men to
[2:15:12] condemnation even so by the
[2:15:14] righteousness of one free
[2:15:17] the free gift came upon all men unto
[2:15:21] what
[2:15:22] there it is again foreknown
[2:15:25] predestinated called
[2:15:29] Justified glorified
[2:15:33] I read it I've been reading at every
[2:15:36] service Romans 8 29 and 30. it's five
[2:15:39] steps to full Redemption
[2:15:42] you must have been foreknown
[2:15:45] you must have been predestinated you had
[2:15:48] to have been called
[2:15:50] the calling is what makes it personal
[2:15:53] the justification is what he does on our
[2:15:56] behalf and the glorification is what
[2:15:59] brings us into the image of his son he's
[2:16:02] got this
[2:16:03] I want you to know folks as we come to a
[2:16:06] close I want you to know he's got this
[2:16:09] he knows how to bring his children all
[2:16:12] the way
[2:16:13] verse 19 I haven't I haven't I'm just
[2:16:16] reading my text
[2:16:18] I haven't preached my sermon but I'm
[2:16:20] stopping soon
[2:16:21] I haven't gone to One Note
[2:16:24] for as by one man's Disobedience many
[2:16:26] were made Sinners so by The Obedience of
[2:16:29] one
[2:16:30] you better hear this
[2:16:33] shall many
[2:16:36] be made righteous
[2:16:38] and you don't get to choose
[2:16:41] who is and who is not
[2:16:43] [Applause]
[2:16:46] we can't let our prejudices
[2:16:49] or our grudges determine who God covers
[2:16:53] and fills with his righteousness
[2:17:04] who hates all the children
[2:17:09] hits all the dogs with a broom
[2:17:14] don't even want anybody stopping in
[2:17:16] front of her house
[2:17:18] you don't get to choose whether she has
[2:17:20] the righteousness of Christ imparted to
[2:17:21] her
[2:17:22] she's the one you ought to reach
[2:17:25] she's the one you ought to pray for
[2:17:26] because she's very miserable
[2:17:29] people are behaving out of their own
[2:17:31] misery
[2:17:32] you know you if it were up to us all
[2:17:34] right now let's make it personal some of
[2:17:36] us were mistreated in our life
[2:17:39] failed by parents
[2:17:42] failed by spouses
[2:17:44] let me tell you something what you're
[2:17:45] looking at we've got a lot of people
[2:17:47] missing this morning
[2:17:48] but what you're looking at here is a
[2:17:50] body of real people
[2:17:52] broken people
[2:17:54] some have come from broken marriages
[2:17:56] some have come from great addictions
[2:18:00] some have testified and used words I
[2:18:02] don't even like to use referring to
[2:18:04] people but they've done it they've just
[2:18:06] been honest and open about where they
[2:18:08] come from it's all the goodness of God
[2:18:12] it's all his grace if we were all born
[2:18:15] holy we wouldn't have needed a savior
[2:18:18] but we were born in trouble and already
[2:18:20] needed a savior when we got here come on
[2:18:23] now it's his righteousness
[2:18:26] it's his righteousness that makes us
[2:18:29] anything at all
[2:18:31] and so in this room there are people who
[2:18:34] have not had pristine lives
[2:18:37] [Music]
[2:18:39] some have had abusive husbands abusive
[2:18:41] wives
[2:18:44] some have had abusive parents
[2:18:47] I don't want to hurt you I don't want to
[2:18:48] bring anything up
[2:18:50] some have had family members commit
[2:18:52] suicide some have had it right in their
[2:18:54] home some
[2:18:57] have been emotionally abused
[2:19:01] some have been physically abused some
[2:19:04] have been sexually abused
[2:19:07] and it's hard sometimes
[2:19:10] to place that person
[2:19:12] in a position where they could receive
[2:19:14] the grace of God
[2:19:18] but we must
[2:19:21] we maybe you may be the only hope
[2:19:25] I don't mean you have to put your
[2:19:26] yourself in their life
[2:19:29] listen prayer is a very powerful too
[2:19:32] I'm not telling you you have to go make
[2:19:34] amends with your abuser no sir
[2:19:37] I'm not telling you that you have to go
[2:19:39] and reach out to your abuser and and
[2:19:41] give them the gospel but I'll tell you
[2:19:43] what you can do you can pray Lord
[2:19:46] you send somebody
[2:19:50] because the heart of a True Believer we
[2:19:52] don't want anybody to perish
[2:19:54] I don't care how Wicked they've been
[2:19:57] I'm just so glad you can't put me in
[2:19:59] hell even if you don't like me
[2:20:03] somebody said why don't we see the the
[2:20:06] spoken word of God manifested any more
[2:20:08] than we do why don't we see it like we
[2:20:11] believe it is to come
[2:20:13] I'll tell you why
[2:20:15] because we haven't come to that perfect
[2:20:17] love yet
[2:20:19] and we would use the word of God we
[2:20:21] would try to use that spoken word
[2:20:22] Authority in an abusive way
[2:20:27] it's not here to put a ward on your
[2:20:29] enemy's nose
[2:20:31] it's not here to call somebody you're
[2:20:33] mad at to fall you dig a pit for your
[2:20:35] brother you fall in it yourself
[2:20:37] come on it's here for other higher
[2:20:39] purposes than that
[2:20:41] it's not here to express your
[2:20:43] unforgiveness one of these days we're
[2:20:45] coming all the way up into that stature
[2:20:47] of the perfect man we're going to learn
[2:20:50] what it means to not only have his
[2:20:52] godliness in our life but we're going to
[2:20:54] know what it means to operate in his
[2:20:55] perfect love
[2:20:57] and when we do we're trustworthy
[2:21:00] then we become trustworthy musicians are
[2:21:02] coming to be used in whatever way God
[2:21:05] would see fit to use our lives
[2:21:07] so many are made righteous
[2:21:09] by The Obedience of one man
[2:21:12] two more verses isn't it
[2:21:15] moreover
[2:21:16] the law entered that the offense might
[2:21:18] abound
[2:21:20] you got to hear that
[2:21:21] I can't brush over that
[2:21:24] because some of the messianics deny the
[2:21:26] verse
[2:21:28] when you try to teach that the law was
[2:21:32] put in place to reveal man's inability
[2:21:37] to walk in righteousness there are
[2:21:39] messianics that get very mad
[2:21:45] but I didn't say it
[2:21:48] Jesus said it
[2:21:50] the reason why the law was so stringent
[2:21:53] is because God knew from the beginning
[2:21:55] that man would not be able
[2:22:00] to constantly keep he knew there would
[2:22:02] be no Temple for one thing
[2:22:04] he knew there would be a time that the
[2:22:06] red heifer could not be offered he knew
[2:22:08] there'd be a time that these things
[2:22:09] could not take place
[2:22:11] he knew that over 600 Commandments
[2:22:13] nobody would be able to completely walk
[2:22:15] in every one of those he did that so
[2:22:17] that sin would abound and so that man
[2:22:20] would be able to see his need
[2:22:23] of more than a covering
[2:22:27] Justified
[2:22:29] moreover the law entered that the
[2:22:30] offense might abound but where sin
[2:22:32] abounded guess what
[2:22:37] can I get you to read it again
[2:22:39] read that one more time but when where
[2:22:41] sin abounded Grace
[2:22:49] Hallelujah
[2:22:51] even in a world like ours
[2:22:54] where sin is about Grace is much more
[2:22:56] abounding grace is still predominant
[2:22:58] thanks be to God last verse
[2:23:01] that as Sin hath reigned unto death
[2:23:04] even so my grace Reign through
[2:23:07] righteousness unto eternal life
[2:23:10] by Jesus Christ Our Lord
[2:23:12] now I want to read you one quotation
[2:23:14] this morning in closing
[2:23:21] this is from the message and absolute
[2:23:26] paragraph 120.
[2:23:28] and again I want to mention this I don't
[2:23:30] want to offend anybody
[2:23:32] in the room or streaming
[2:23:34] because I'm quoting brother Branham you
[2:23:36] you can you can you can look at it
[2:23:38] anyway you don't have to listen
[2:23:41] but just to understand this that
[2:23:43] you you you hear Chuck Swindoll
[2:23:48] Spurgeon
[2:23:51] rice
[2:23:55] Stanley who just passed away
[2:23:58] Tozer
[2:24:00] quoted all the time
[2:24:02] so there shouldn't be anybody that takes
[2:24:05] such great offense in me I'm not trying
[2:24:07] to make him any more than a prophet
[2:24:08] that's what he was
[2:24:13] with a very special place in my life I
[2:24:16] don't know I really really couldn't
[2:24:18] thank God enough for letting me hear
[2:24:20] this word
[2:24:22] in the message and absolutes Shreveport
[2:24:24] Louisiana 1963 paragraph 120 he's
[2:24:28] quoting Romans 8 1 now therefore
[2:24:31] being justified by faith
[2:24:34] we have peace with God through our Lord
[2:24:37] Jesus Christ we find out I believe
[2:24:39] that's Romans 5 we find out
[2:24:42] is our justification
[2:24:47] what is our Justice Jesus
[2:24:49] who is our Jesus
[2:24:52] he is our justification God raised him
[2:24:56] up on the third day to justify our faith
[2:24:59] that we believe it
[2:25:01] because that faith became the door that
[2:25:04] we walked through so that we can stand
[2:25:06] in Grace
[2:25:08] now I want you to know something you
[2:25:10] don't you don't run in and out of the
[2:25:11] door of faith and you don't run in and
[2:25:14] out of Grace
[2:25:17] if you leave the truth if you leave the
[2:25:20] life that you are called to live
[2:25:22] here's what you need to know I don't
[2:25:24] want to encourage anybody to go away
[2:25:25] from God
[2:25:27] I want to encourage you to come home
[2:25:29] but let me tell you something you don't
[2:25:31] leave Grace here
[2:25:33] Grace will go with you
[2:25:37] he'll follow you Grace will follow you
[2:25:38] let's let's make her a she She'll follow
[2:25:41] you
[2:25:43] of course brother Brandon preaching away
[2:25:45] on Grace he said do you know Grace
[2:25:47] her name is Amazing Grace
[2:25:49] so I'll just call her a woman today
[2:25:51] Grace will follow you
[2:25:53] some of you are Mighty glad she will
[2:25:57] it won't never taste the same
[2:26:00] when Grace is following you
[2:26:03] the high won't never be as high
[2:26:07] the drunk won't never be the same
[2:26:12] your time with your head in the toilet
[2:26:14] will be more I hope
[2:26:16] but Grace will be covering you
[2:26:20] Grace will chase you down
[2:26:24] come on you hear sister Megan I just
[2:26:26] happen to hear her voice put up your
[2:26:27] hand Megan
[2:26:29] she said that is the truth
[2:26:32] because she was one of those who ran
[2:26:34] from Grace
[2:26:36] an addict
[2:26:38] a ruined life
[2:26:40] and Grace just kept chasing her
[2:26:43] yeah
[2:26:48] I know people that have it pretty easy
[2:26:51] and won't serve the Lord
[2:26:54] and then you hear a testimony like hers
[2:26:58] the grace of God should be dead
[2:27:02] by the world standards more than once
[2:27:04] multiple times
[2:27:09] kept following after her and Grace kept
[2:27:12] wooing her grace kept chasing her
[2:27:18] Peter the same way April's husband Peter
[2:27:20] who went to be with the Lord many years
[2:27:21] ago now
[2:27:23] Grace chased him
[2:27:27] he thought he could get out from under
[2:27:28] my preaching
[2:27:31] he could have peace
[2:27:34] hey I'm giving you his he told me this
[2:27:38] he said but you are always in my ear
[2:27:42] that wasn't me
[2:27:45] it sounded like me
[2:27:48] that was Grace
[2:27:53] he said I could see you puning your
[2:27:55] fingers I said that one my finger
[2:27:58] that was Grace
[2:28:00] oh somebody ought to praise him
[2:28:03] [Applause]
[2:28:09] somebody ought to praise him
[2:28:12] Hallelujah
[2:28:13] [Applause]
[2:28:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:28:20] [Applause]
[2:28:24] Hallelujah
[2:28:28] Hallelujah
[2:28:32] [Applause]
[2:28:34] let me read the rest of this you can be
[2:28:37] seated or stand I don't care what you do
[2:28:39] you do whichever you need to do but I'm
[2:28:41] going to finish reading this quickly
[2:28:42] here's our justification
[2:28:45] God raised him upon the Third
[2:28:48] their faith that we believe it and he
[2:28:50] raised him up to justify our faith what
[2:28:53] did he do then
[2:28:55] he sent him back
[2:28:57] the justifier
[2:29:00] because our faith believes that the Holy
[2:29:02] Spirit Christ come into it for our
[2:29:05] justification because we have raised
[2:29:08] from Death unto life you can't find any
[2:29:11] fault in that I don't care who said it
[2:29:13] and now we are Sons and Daughters of God
[2:29:15] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:29:17] Jesus
[2:29:19] divide Us by what
[2:29:23] that give us justification to know
[2:29:27] with the earnest of our Salvation within
[2:29:30] us now the very Life of Christ pulsating
[2:29:34] in US
[2:29:35] how then could we deny the word
[2:29:38] did you hear the song
[2:29:40] how could I deny any of the truth
[2:29:43] and how then could we deny the word
[2:29:45] which he is the word that gives us this
[2:29:47] assurance
[2:29:48] the holy spirit is there what is it it's
[2:29:51] still the North Star
[2:29:53] Christ is that North Star and the Holy
[2:29:56] Spirit is that justification that points
[2:29:59] the believer right straight to the North
[2:30:01] Star
[2:30:01] right the Holy Ghost will always point
[2:30:05] to the word
[2:30:05] [Music]
[2:30:07] you don't have to be afraid of the Holy
[2:30:08] Ghost he'll always take you to the word
[2:30:10] if it points to a Creed or a
[2:30:12] denomination
[2:30:15] it's not the Holy Ghost he couldn't do
[2:30:17] that pulling away from his word when he
[2:30:19] died to confirm that word and make that
[2:30:21] word a positive amen he died so he could
[2:30:24] come himself into that word he is the
[2:30:26] quickening life that makes that word
[2:30:28] live again
[2:30:30] my God appraise him a minute
[2:30:32] gotta praise him a minute Hallelujah
[2:30:34] that was his purpose of dying that he
[2:30:37] could still project himself through his
[2:30:38] church
[2:30:40] and make every word through every Age
[2:30:43] act just exactly the way it's supposed
[2:30:47] to act
[2:30:48] powerful he is the Dynamics of the
[2:30:51] mechanics
[2:30:52] the mechanics of the church was it what
[2:30:54] is it Apostles prophets teachers he is
[2:30:56] the
[2:30:57] dust that works that and it's worked by
[2:31:00] a certain Dynamic which is which is like
[2:31:04] he is the fire that fires off the gas he
[2:31:07] is the fire that's in the combustion
[2:31:08] chamber when the gas the word is poured
[2:31:11] over that combustion chamber he is the
[2:31:13] one that sets her a fire he is the one
[2:31:15] that confirms it he is the power of the
[2:31:17] Resurrection he is God he is the fire
[2:31:20] that's what he is
[2:31:23] how many of you believe you're justified
[2:31:26] by the Resurrection Life of Jesus Christ

[2:38:46] would you just keep your hands up for
[2:38:48] just a moment I want to just pray over
[2:38:51] the body right now everyone that's here
[2:38:53] and we're taught in the Old Testament
[2:38:55] that when a prayer or blessing was
[2:38:58] pronounced the way to receive that was
[2:39:00] to put up a hand or both hands and when
[2:39:02] it's finished to say Amen it means so be
[2:39:05] it I receive that into my life so I'm
[2:39:07] not trying to be formal but I just felt
[2:39:10] to ask you to do that father in the name
[2:39:12] of Jesus Christ
[2:39:14] these are your people all over this room
[2:39:17] from the front to the back these are
[2:39:19] yours they belong to you they're not
[2:39:21] mine
[2:39:22] they're not any preachers
[2:39:24] they don't belong to any building they
[2:39:27] belong to you and you see their needs
[2:39:29] you know that's that that is on the
[2:39:32] surface and you know that that is in the
[2:39:34] deepest part of who they are in the
[2:39:36] deepest recesses of their mind and of
[2:39:39] their soul you know that deep need and
[2:39:42] I'm asking you oh
[2:39:50] how do you say
[2:39:54] whoa
[2:39:57] I'm asking you to do for them Lord what
[2:40:00] they cannot do for themselves
[2:40:02] for what I couldn't do for them you can
[2:40:04] in a moment's time it doesn't have to be
[2:40:07] an hour in your present just one moment
[2:40:09] in your presence
[2:40:11] healing takes place
[2:40:13] confused Minds can find peace Lord I
[2:40:17] pray that a new determination will fall
[2:40:19] on this people right now to serve you
[2:40:22] with every fiber of their being
[2:40:27] would you sever any cords that this
[2:40:30] world has laid on them
[2:40:32] would you break every feather and every
[2:40:34] chain that this world has used to hold
[2:40:36] them in any way even the mindset I pray
[2:40:40] right now against mindsets that are
[2:40:42] anti-word
[2:40:44] like fear like anxiety
[2:40:47] like unforgiveness I pray against those
[2:40:50] mindsets right now in the authority of
[2:40:53] Jesus Christ fill us
[2:40:55] as your children
[2:40:57] fill us
[2:41:01] now the Lord is talking to me just in
[2:41:03] this moment about someone
[2:41:05] who is feeling very very unsettled in
[2:41:08] your in your in your inner man and you
[2:41:10] have for some time now just unsettled
[2:41:14] just unsettled not not quite satisfied
[2:41:17] not sure where to put your hand on it
[2:41:20] not sure exactly what to do about it in
[2:41:23] fact you're a little bit afraid
[2:41:25] to even think about what might be
[2:41:27] required to settle that that feeling of
[2:41:30] of it's really a hunger
[2:41:33] it's really a deep hunger at the noise
[2:41:36] of thy water spouts the Deep calls to
[2:41:39] the deep and and I want the Lord to help
[2:41:41] you this morning because you're on my
[2:41:43] heart I feel like the Lord has pointed a
[2:41:45] few of you out to me in my mind right
[2:41:47] now and I'm just going to pray for you
[2:41:50] from here for the moment that the Lord
[2:41:52] would would settle you that he would
[2:41:54] give you a peace that you would know
[2:41:57] exactly what he would have you to do
[2:41:58] that you would have the courage to do it
[2:42:03] I
[2:42:04] I feel like saying that for some it's
[2:42:07] your security
[2:42:09] you you you have grown accustomed
[2:42:12] to your security
[2:42:15] uh maybe it's a job
[2:42:18] maybe it's a a familiar place
[2:42:21] and the Lord is trying to squeeze you
[2:42:23] out of that in some way pull you closer
[2:42:25] to him
[2:42:26] and your human nature just like mine
[2:42:28] wants to hold on to the familiar and
[2:42:30] wants to hold on to the things that give
[2:42:32] us some sense of security and belonging
[2:42:34] and peace but I believe the Lord is
[2:42:36] going to see you through I'm going to
[2:42:37] pray again right now
[2:42:39] that may not be for everyone of you that
[2:42:41] are feeding that but at least one of you
[2:42:43] the Lord is speaking to your heart right
[2:42:46] now I pray he will confirm to you that
[2:42:49] he is talking to you through those word
[2:42:51] father in the name of Jesus every one of
[2:42:54] us have been in a similar Place some of
[2:42:57] us multiple times
[2:42:59] where with everything we have in the
[2:43:02] natural we're holding on
[2:43:03] and yet something higher is calling us
[2:43:07] higher something in you is calling us to
[2:43:11] a higher Play We Sing a Song sometime
[2:43:13] Zion is calling me to a higher place
[2:43:18] and Lord we have experienced that and
[2:43:21] we've learned the hard way
[2:43:24] the best thing to do is to yield woo
[2:43:28] the best thing to do is to yield to that
[2:43:30] so I pray for grace right now to every
[2:43:33] person in this room to yield to that to
[2:43:36] yield to the grace of God the courage to
[2:43:39] make good decisions

[2:43:44] to move forward into what you have for
[2:43:46] them in the name of Jesus in the name of
[2:43:49] Jesus

[2:43:55] place right now

[2:54:57] I'm not doing it
[2:54:59] for somebody God wants to open up the
[2:55:02] way out of the roundabout
[2:55:05] I just saw you
[2:55:07] I don't know if you're an alabamian or
[2:55:09] not but you'd make a good one because
[2:55:11] they don't know how to use roundabouts
[2:55:13] but I saw you just circling just
[2:55:15] circling not knowing where to get off
[2:55:18] and and that's all like like others
[2:55:20] coming in and filling up the roundabout
[2:55:24] spiritually but you're just still going
[2:55:25] around in circles just going around in
[2:55:27] circles smiling the whole time
[2:55:29] just kind of pretending like it's all
[2:55:31] right and that that's normal and that's
[2:55:33] what you're supposed to do no no no
[2:55:35] that's not there for you to keep going
[2:55:36] in circles but no Direction no
[2:55:38] leadership no no no
[2:55:40] may God point out right now may he point
[2:55:44] out for you your way out of that
[2:55:45] roundabout
[2:55:47] may God show you the way out Hallelujah
[2:55:50] I used to say it call it a gerbil wheel
[2:55:53] but the Lord let me see at that time in
[2:55:55] the spirit like a roundabout just going
[2:55:57] around and around and around and around
[2:56:00] Lord point the way out for whoever needs
[2:56:03] that
[2:56:04] pinpoint
[2:56:07] reveal
[2:56:09] speak
[2:56:12] when we were singing about the goodness
[2:56:14] of God that verse says I love your voice
[2:56:18] [Laughter]
[2:56:22] I love your voice
[2:56:25] when you speak to us
[2:56:28] it's the sweetest
[2:56:30] voice
[2:56:32] there's nothing like hearing your voice
[2:56:36] I pray for my brother sister
[2:56:38] may they hear your voice
[2:56:41] may they get out of that roundabout
[2:56:45] may they have Direction in leadership
[2:56:48] to follow you
[2:56:51] and to go in the way that you've called
[2:56:52] them to go uttata
[2:56:57] through the storm
[2:56:59] through it all
[2:57:01] your Lord of all
[2:57:04] I know how people are sometime about
[2:57:06] others laying hands on them
[2:57:09] if you're not comfortable with that then
[2:57:10] you can just tell somebody you're not or
[2:57:12] go back to your seat or whatever but I I
[2:57:15] know I know at most everybody here and
[2:57:17] if I don't know you in the natural I
[2:57:18] know you by the spirit I'm wondering if
[2:57:20] you just if you just touch one another
[2:57:23] the shoulder how it's appropriate
[2:57:24] brother to brother sister to sister and
[2:57:27] would you I just feel like that there is
[2:57:29] such a need of strength
[2:57:31] and I know sometimes it's physical
[2:57:33] strength sometimes it's spiritual
[2:57:35] strength emotional strength
[2:57:38] I don't know what the strength need is
[2:57:40] but I want you just to pray for one
[2:57:42] another if you're standing back and
[2:57:44] didn't come lay your handle your wife
[2:57:46] next to you you're the one standing next
[2:57:48] to you or somebody Hawk and Chad touch
[2:57:51] one another you just find somebody
[2:57:54] even as uh shoshana standing there with
[2:57:57] sister Jada and you in the sound booth
[2:58:00] I just want you to ask God for strength
[2:58:03] for the one you're touching strength
[2:58:06] strength the Lord
[2:58:08] strength
[2:58:10] strength to make a commitment if that's
[2:58:12] what's needed
[2:58:14] streak to find the born-again experience
[2:58:16] if that's what's needed
[2:58:19] strength to make the right choice
[2:58:22] if that's what's needed
[2:58:24] strength to serve the Lord
[2:58:27] with greater determination if that's
[2:58:29] what's needed physical strength if
[2:58:33] that's the need
[2:58:34] heal
[2:58:36] injuries
[2:58:38] [Music]
[2:58:40] heal joints
[2:58:43] heal muscle strains
[2:58:46] tears
[2:58:50] if it's healing physically let it come
[2:58:53] to my brother let it come to my sister
[2:58:56] you sense your word and healed us
[2:58:58] [Music]
[2:59:00] it's emotional strength nobody likes to
[2:59:03] say that
[2:59:05] but sometimes times we just get mentally
[2:59:08] exhausted
[2:59:10] and our emotions follow
[2:59:13] in a crash
[2:59:16] strengthen my brother
[2:59:18] strengthen my sister
[2:59:21] may they not be led by their emotions
[2:59:23] may they be led by the word
[2:59:27] may they not make decisions based on
[2:59:30] emotions
[2:59:31] may they may come by the leadership of
[2:59:33] the Holy Spirit
[2:59:36] if they feel trapped in anything
[2:59:43] to be free strength I speak strength
[2:59:48] I speak strength
[2:59:50] I speak strength
[2:59:53] drink to you
