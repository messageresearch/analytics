TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if one man can operate in the power and the unction of almighty god then a company of men and women can also operate in the fullness of the power of god you have been sent to time to carry out a plan of god a predestinated predetermined free fixed destiny plan on planet earth but you were originally created for eternity and so when time is no more and you step back into eternity you'll be back in the dimension where you were created to exist forever we not only have senses touch and feel and smell etc to keep us connected to the atmosphere and environment around us but god gives us spiritual senses so that we might be connected to the spiritual world to the heavenly world so that we might also bear the image of the heavenly i tell you this is what the bride is going to have to be in the last days she's going to have to bear the image of the heavenly there's enough earthy around us amen the world sees the world there's no transformation in seeing the world but you let them have a glimpse of the heavenly let them see that there's a people that will sell out to god that would rather be connected by the senses of the spirit to that which is spiritual than by the five senses to that which is earthy you just let them see that god will have a people fully adopted to carry his authority in the earth as he was the first fruits of the resurrection there will also be a harvest as he was the first seed to come to perfection there will also be a harvest of seed that's what it means that's what first fruits is all about it says if one man could be resurrected from the dead then many sons can also be resurrected from the dead if one man can operate in the power and the unction of almighty god then a company of men and women can also operate in the fullness of the power of god
