[0:00] David was not going to get it wrong
[0:04] again he'd already been through some
[0:07] things he'd already changed the way the
[0:09] glory was
[0:11] carried it was to be carried on the on
[0:14] the
[0:15] shoulders near the heart of the
[0:18] levitical priesthood David said I I see
[0:22] it being such a hard task and so he
[0:25] wanted to design a new
[0:28] cart that he could put the Ark on that
[0:32] would make it a little easier to be
[0:36] stabilized and if you remember it it
[0:40] worked but not
[0:42] entirely because the cart would shake
[0:46] and the Ark would shake and the
[0:49] Commandment to the Levites was don't
[0:51] touch the ark you can move it by the
[0:55] Rings you can move it by the staves but
[0:58] don't put your hand on the AR AR I'm
[1:01] telling you am I'm telling you brother
[1:04] sister be careful how you put your hand
[1:07] on the glory be careful how you put your
[1:10] hand on the Pentecostal
[1:12] experience be careful how you put your
[1:14] hand on somebody else's spiritual
[1:16] worship be careful because usza reached
[1:20] his hand to balance the ark and God
[1:22] smote him dead and David carried the
[1:27] guilt David was under the conviction and
[1:30] condemnation of the death of usza the
[1:32] priest because God said I'm showing you
[1:36] that my way is the best way my way is
[1:39] the right way my way is the only way
[1:42] does anybody hear God saying that today
[1:44] I do my way is the right way but there
[1:48] came a time that David was stirred Again
[1:52] by the spirit of the Lord to get the ark
[1:56] where it really belonged back to the
[1:59] city of Jerusalem
[2:00] what stirred
[2:03] [Music]
[2:05] him he began to
[2:08] hear that wherever that Ark was the
[2:11] blessings of God were where the freedom
[2:15] of the holy spirit is the blessings of
[2:18] God are poured out where God is free to
[2:21] move to talk and to have his way that's
[2:25] where I want to be I want to be right
[2:27] there in the middle of that I don't want
[2:29] to SP in my life sitting somewhere where
[2:32] Jesus has been banished to the corner
[2:34] with dirty feet I'm not going to live my
[2:38] life in a lifeless church I'm not going
[2:41] to live my life in a place where the
[2:43] Holy Ghost is not free to move too late
[2:47] too
[2:48] late he filled me with the Holy Ghost
[2:51] when I was seven years old I am too
[2:53] spoiled by the Holy Ghost to be able to
[2:56] live my life in a place where there is
[2:59] more more structure than
[3:03] anointing I'm not opposed to God's order
[3:06] it's man's order that troubles my spirit
[3:10] anybody with me cuz if man is not
[3:12] working in tandem with God he may find
[3:16] himself touching what does not belong to
[3:18] him to touch and he may find himself on
[3:21] the ground so this was a strong
[3:24] indication to David that God's anger had
[3:27] begin to subside and quiet down and he
[3:30] said you know it might be about time for
[3:32] me to move that Ark a little closer
[3:34] because the Bible tells us that David
[3:36] pitched the tent for the ark to sit in
[3:40] it was called The Tabernacle of David
[3:42] it's referenced several times in the
[3:44] Bible in fact the Bible prophesies that
[3:46] in those last days I will rebuild the
[3:48] Tabernacle of David and the main
[3:51] difference there were several
[3:52] differences but the main difference hear
[3:54] this between the Tabernacle of Moses and
[3:57] the Tabernacle of David is the
[3:58] Tabernacle of David had no
[4:02] Veil so the worshipper was not banished
[4:05] to the outer Court the worshipper could
[4:07] come right up if he had Clean Hands and
[4:09] a pure heart he could come right up into
[4:11] the presence of God and worship before
[4:14] the Ark of the Covenant come on no Veil
[4:16] to keep him out that was a that was a
[4:19] pre- shadow of what would happen with
[4:21] Christ when when he died on the cross
[4:23] and the veil of the temple was rent from
[4:25] top to bottom what David had what David
[4:28] was operating in what David was
[4:30] administering on Mount Zion was a
[4:33] pre-type of what you and I can
[4:35] experience with the baptism of the Holy
[4:37] Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[4:40] life everything the Holy Ghost does is
[4:44] life
[4:45] producing there's no death in the Holy
[4:48] Ghost there's no death in a Pentecostal
[4:53] experience there may be death in taking
[4:55] a Doctrine to a shut there may be death
[4:59] in making some little part of the
[5:01] picture the least of the gifts he said
[5:04] there may be some problem if we if we
[5:07] take that as though we have reached the
[5:10] Pinnacle this is why brother Brandon was
[5:12] so against the Pentecostal movement in
[5:14] those latter days is because they said
[5:16] this is this is it we talk in tongues we
[5:21] have reached the highest point and
[5:23] brother brandom said oh no W there's so
[5:26] much more out there for
[5:28] us
