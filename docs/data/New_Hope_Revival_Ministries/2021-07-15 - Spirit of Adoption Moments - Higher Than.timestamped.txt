[0:00] i believe with everything that's within
[0:02] me
[0:03] that there will be accelerated maturity
[0:05] in the last of the last days
[0:11] [Music]
[0:14] this is the lord praying this is jesus
[0:17] communicating with the eternal spirit of
[0:19] the father
[0:20] that was within him and he didn't say in
[0:22] that moment of great testing and
[0:25] agony our father he didn't even pray
[0:29] god of the whole universe if you know
[0:31] anything about jewish prayer
[0:33] you know that almost all jewish prayer
[0:36] begins by acknowledging god
[0:40] as as ha holam the god of
[0:43] the universe the universe the god
[0:46] of the whole universe but this is the
[0:49] word made flesh
[0:51] and he is communicating in intimacy with
[0:54] the father that lived within him
[0:56] he didn't say our father he didn't say
[0:59] god of all creation
[1:00] he didn't say god of the whole earth or
[1:02] the whole universe
[1:03] he said my father
[1:07] my papa my daddy
[1:10] all things are possible with thee
[1:14] take away this cup from me nevertheless
[1:18] not what i will but what thou
[1:21] wilt folks if we're not uh
[1:24] developing a relationship of intimacy
[1:28] like that with our lord we are missing
[1:31] out
[1:32] on what the spirit of adoption has come
[1:35] to do inside of us he's bringing us
[1:38] to a mature place he's placing us
[1:41] as a son and one of the greatest
[1:44] strengths of a mature son
[1:46] is knowing where he stands you see
[1:49] that means he recognizes where he has
[1:52] been placed
[1:54] and when we recognize where we have been
[1:56] placed
[1:57] we have to recognize who placed us there
[2:00] amen
[2:01] and then we begin to yield to all
[2:04] that god has promised to do in us
[2:08] and for us and because of the spirit of
[2:12] adoption
[2:13] the spirit of life and the spirit of
[2:15] truth
[2:16] i can yield myself to a relationship
[2:20] of intimacy that it's really still
[2:23] much much higher than any relationship
[2:26] we know here on the earth
[2:28] but we we can come in a familiar way
[2:31] not in a dishonoring way and not in a
[2:35] in a false sense of familiarity
[2:38] but rather in a revelation that he loves
[2:41] us
[2:41] so much he is a lot less
[2:45] easily offended with us as than we think
[2:49] he knows us already he knows what to
[2:52] expect out of
[2:53] us and so i think his heart
[2:56] delights when we can come to him
[3:00] from the depth of our inner being and we
[3:03] can love him
[3:05] like abba father his
[3:08] divine spirit has joined itself
[3:12] with our once fallen human spirit
[3:16] and that holy spirit cries out in the
[3:19] spirit
[3:19] man cries out for the more for the more
[3:23] for the more to be had that spirit
[3:26] within you will cause you to be grateful
[3:28] for the first fruits it'll cause you to
[3:30] be grateful for the earnest
[3:33] of what god has deposited in your life
[3:36] but that same holy spirit will cry out
[3:39] for the full manifestation for the full
[3:43] and complete adoption and we believe
[3:47] i believe with everything that's within
[3:49] me that there will be accelerated
[3:51] maturity
[3:52] in the last of the last days it will not
[3:55] be
[3:56] wisdom gained from years of experience
[3:59] but it will be wisdom given as a gift
[4:01] from almighty god
[4:03] maturity that not only comes from
[4:05] experiencing life
[4:07] but a maturity that comes as a gift
[4:10] from god to the believer how by the
[4:13] spirit of adoption
