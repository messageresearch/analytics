Jackson calls for boldness in overcoming these obstacles through trust in God’s promises, reminding the congregation of the power of praise and the spoken Word to bring deliverance and breakthrough.

he wants to and as long as he wants to we're just just enveloped in his presence and while he's close we take our needs to him do you have needs over the building by the lifting of the hand they're all over the building tonight out across the street the Lord sees the needs that you have and he knows how to meet them better than anyone else because he can see to the very deepest symptom and root and he's able to meet that need he's worthy to be praised isn't he amen I just wanted to uh give you a couple of prayer requests that have come in uh one that we've been aware of through the day and evening last night but we just uh had a little message here from Sister Sally Duke and uh brother Bobby is fighting shingles and it sounds like it's quite a battle how many of you know that the Lord is above it all he's bigger than every problem and he's bigger than every situation and we know that the Lord can how many of you were here last night we we we're just about to go to the Lord in prayer but what a meeting we had God just showed up I don't know what time you left but it was after midnight I think before we were pulling out of here in fact I think the church was locked at about 12:40 that's nearly 1:00 and uh we just saw God doing so many wonderful things and the same God is here tonight amen a lot of you most all of you know uh Luke and and Megan yovic who were here last night and their beautiful children and uh if there's ever been a mama who loves being a mama and a Daddy who loves being a Daddy it's that too and uh there are a lot of people who believe that it's all Megan you know that she's the one who wants all the children but I want you to know that means you just don't know them very well because if you did you would know that uh Luke also is very happy when the news comes that God is going to bless them with another baby we don't understand all of these things but we know that he is worthy to be praised so we gathered around last night without saying what the need was but they had gotten some very hard news uh yesterday morning a routine uh scan and there had been a little bit of concern uh because there there was seemed to be no movement all of a sudden and um but just believing you know that things were going to be better and uh so when they did the ultrasound unexpectedly they found out and said that the little baby had ceased to live uh perhaps even a a week or so maybe even a little bit longer and uh it was so hard you know for that little family all the children were there for the scan and so it was so difficult and uh Luke was just uh his response was faith I'm going to believe I'm going to believe you know Lazarus uh he was in the grave three days and three nights and even his sisters knew that uh things were bad and the voice of the Resurrection uh brought life to Lazarus and and so I didn't feel I didn't feel uh silly or uh I didn't feel like it was a crazy thing for us to agree with them and they didn't want to tell very many people you know why they said we don't want anybody meaning well of course but we don't want anybody speaking anything but life I want you to know that I am a pride and proud that's not a good word but I am a very very very proud Pastor tonight of their response that it wasn't panic and it wasn't bitterness their response was we're going to do nothing until we give God another opportunity to move and we've seen God move we've seen the resurrection power we know what God can do but unfortunately this morning when they uh went in and did another check and and did another scan they found also again that the little uh baby was not alive and uh they had already named the baby because she was what 20 20 weeks well that changes the whole Dynamics because that's uh pretty much halfway through or more and and so tonight there she's there in the hospital and and Luke is there and uh they're doing you know what they what they have to do and what they need to do so that her health is preserved and uh would you just believe God for the for the purpose and the why to bring forth a greater glory in their lives we don't always get to know why but you know sometimes we do and I had a little quickening in my heart today day that God was going to give them a why he was going to let them know and he was going to help roll them over this uh very very difficult uh situation they want to be here tonight they want to be singing and worshiping with us here tonight but uh it just wasn't it just wasn't possible for them to to be that so I wanted to bring you the seriousness of their need and tell you that we want to hold them them up to the Lord in prayer through a dark and a difficult time their testimony to me all day has been we trust God he is Sovereign he is Holy he never makes a mistake he never fails amen and and uh I I'm thankful for that the Lord gives and the Lord takes away and he does it for a purpose he does it for a reason and so would you particularly hold them up to the Lord tonight in prayer amen Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory glory and [Music] honor glory and honor and power for thou Hast created past all things created how has created all [Music] things and for thy pleasure they are created by th Art Worthy oh Lord sing it again I'm going to ask my son Nathan to come and pray over the needs [Music] Thou Art Worthy Thou Art [Music] Worthy Thou Art Worthy oh Lord [Music] to receive glory glory and honor glory and horor and [Music] power for thou Hast created has all things [Applause] created thou Hast created all things and for thy [Music] pleasure they are [Music] are worthy oh Lord let's pray oh Lord we love you thank you Lord that you've brought us together again in your house

back he stepped out we're glad that he came let's worship together as shosanna sings Tonight this song is not by accident I had no intentions of singing this camp meeting prise God glory because there's been a song the Lord's been brooding in my heart for the last year and I knew I couldn't sing it until after this week so I hadn't bothered to practice anything shortly after 4:00 this afternoon in my home the Holy Spirit impressed me so strongly Hallelujah said pick up your phone and text Benjamin tell them you're available this is the first song I ever sing in this church it's a song that got me through some pretty dark nights and before brother shell shared anything about Luke and make the Lord had impressed on my heart to share this he's still God still God when he takes the twins he's still God when the hurricane washes away the mountain he's still God when cancer looks like it's winning it's not it's just doing God's business he's still God he doesn't always save us from the fire he doesn't always take us from The Trial something that struck my heart so strong last night when Brother David was preaching was when the trial begins don't pray it away that's where your testimony is and it just struck me because I thought Lord how many times have I got on my face and said can you please take this cup for me right we do it doesn't mean the bloodline isn't strong it doesn't mean his grace isn't sufficient it doesn't mean he's not faithful when you don't get the answer you prayed for amen he's still God that's right exactly right even though my spirit is low and it seems I can't hardly go but still I see Victory many times I'm just walking by faith cannot see what lies before me but still I see Victory I've come here to tell you Satan you cannot cross God's [Music] bloodline because I'm still covered by his blood you may stare and you may fight but you already lost this battle tonight cuz remember you can't cross the [Music] bloodline many times our battles get hard yes it seems Saints we're fighting a lot oh but remember we're standing on the Solid Rock of [Music] Ages so Satan if I were you I turn around just give up to because I believe you're about to lose I've just come to tell you hated you can't cross God's bloodline because I am covered by his blood you may share and you may fight but you've already lost this battle tonight remember you can't cross the [Music] bloodline many times our battles get hot seems like we're just fighting a lot oh but remember we're standing on the Solid Rock of Ages so Satan if I were you I'd turn around just give up to because I believe you're about to [Music] lose I've just come to tell you Satan you can't cross God's bloodline because I am covered by his [Music] blood you may sare and you may fight but you've already lost this battle tonight remember you can't cross the [Music] bloodline you may stand you may fight but you're going to lose this battle tonight remember you can't cross the [Music] bloodline do you believe that there is a bloodline oh hallelujah it's it's it's not the chemistry of the blood it's the life you may be seated it's the life that's in the blood that's what stands in the way that's what keeps the enemy at Bay I I if you had a great big old jar tonight of the literal blood of Jesus the chemistry in that blood couldn't help you one little bit but the life that's in it and now that life has been transferred to us where is the blood of Jesus I'll tell you where it it's right here it's in me the life that was in that blood is now in The Believer oh the word has bled again you believe that don't you it's bleeding again in this little bride we carry that life with us us I I can't hardly wait to hear what God has to say to us this evening the time is getting away from us and if I take much more time brother Dwayne won't sing and we want him to sing before he preaches so I I just can't really say much I I mean he didn't tell me that but but but it's getting it's getting I I want him to have lots of time so go ahead and get ready to give would you do that right now would you uh reach in and reach over and uh dig deep tonight because there are expenses in hosting a meeting like this and the and one of the biggest is simply to bless these men of God a laborer is worthy of his hire I shocked brother I kind of shocked Brother David Templeton last night when I told him about my good friend brother Bill yach he knew brother Bill well but he sure was shocked when I told him that more than once brother Bill had to come and bail me out where I was preaching a Revival around this message and I needed gas money to get home now can you imagine that going and carrying the word and not even having enough to pay the gas bill to get home uh I I said can you loan me a little money to get home I didn't have a credit card in those days and he said no but I'll give you some if you'll come by our way have you got enough to get yeah I've got enough then he said we'll give you biscuit and gravy and fill your tank you know I'm so thankful for every time God used somebody like that when I was out there now these men are not destitute they have they have they have income but they have brought us the finest and they have yielded themselves and more serious than that they have become somewhat identified with us by preaching

wanted to be here since about 7:30 this morning he he has just been so rich he has been so rich to me today I was telling brother Steve it was about 3 o'clock this morning when I finally was able to slip away into a little rest and back up the Lord woke me up about 7:30 this morning and his presence was just so so rich and sweet with me I sat sat down at the table and fixed a cup of coffee and I was just just dwelling in his presence and reading scriptures and he come down in the room and I literally sat there at the table for over 30 minutes couldn't speak I couldn't do anything I was just trembling my body was trembling under his presence and under his anointing the thing is is I didn't leave it back at sister Sharon's house no sir I brought it with me he's with me right now he's with you right now and it's going to be amazing to see what he will do this evening I'd say you can be seated you're welcome to be seated for just just a moment I'm going to I'm to try to sing a song um I

Steve's testimony not my dad's testimony I love hearing my dad's testimony I love hearing my pastor's testimony but their testimony is not what gets me through that's I don't overcome by their testimony I overcome by my testimony and the blood of the Lamb there is a part we must play the blood of the Lamb I may have said it here before the blood of the Lamb is a constant this is an equation that we've been given that's I love mathematical equations they always work so it's an equation the blood of the Lamb is a constant the only variable in US overcoming is whether we're going to give our testimony or not so you can choose to overcome or you can choose to sit with your hands folded and still suffer the same thing over and over give me I think you said be flat I've got to sing so I

step out of the presence of God I can't understand it sir none amen thank y'all so much for the for the music and the worship you know the praise is our Warfare sir let's give God a thanks this evening for the ministry of music God bless [Applause] them see some people have never entered into that type of ministry brother Steve that many of you I'm not trying to to dampen your spirit but many of you have never been in a position that they're in see I I've I've been in in music Ministry for many many years at our church and I know if you truly want to enter in and you want to bring a people to worship you better have your music right and the lives of the musicians and those that minister in music better be right or you're not going to welcome his presence the way you're feeling tonight that's right so it is a Ministry and and and I I mean I don't I don't talk to these people I don't I I don't know how much time they spend but I can tell you they spend time you can tell it by the by by how they use their gift and see each one of you have a gift tonight each one of you been given a gift are you going to use it or are you going to lay it down we've got to pick up the gift whatever Talent God gave you and multiply that Talent don't just go and bury it and sit on it and say Well when he comes back I'll offer it back to him that's not he want not what he wants that's right he wants you to multiply the talent that he is that's not nothing with my my message this evening but it is right I wouldn't have said it if it wasn't right cuz I know you to correct me if I was wrong if y'all can't tell I love brother Steve I'm so thankful I can tell that you do and it's it's it's good to have a friendship of someone that that that you can you can justest with but it's it's it's still it's still [Music] clean you don't you don't have to worry that they that they're going to send you something on your phone that you're going to have to hide to make sure that somebody else don't see it no you know some some of the people that y'all that people I'm not I don't want to say y'all do but there are people that associate with other people in the world the ranks of the world and those people want to communicate negative things to you they want to send things that are that should never pass through these eyes and you'll sit there and you'll dwell on that and you'll look at that and all that's doing is taking you further and further and further and further and further away from his presence I'm not trying to repr preach the service for other night I'd like to invite you to turn with me to the Book of Romans chapter 8 and this is very very very familiar scripture Romans chapter 8: 38 and 39 I'll go ahead and tell you that um my message was preached um last evening during the prayer service I watched my message playing out in front of me last night during the prayer service after the ministering had been done my title for tonight is break through the barriers yeah that's right now again brother Steve never has called me and said now brother Dwayne this is what I want you to speak on I want you to to um to follow this path and I want you to try to do this and try to do he never once has done that and I didn't even tell him till just a few moments ago before he came out what my title was this evening and um you you'll you'll see how it connects a little bit later um brother Steve sent out a message to you all today and and he he chose to send it to me as well and he said you know I I sent this out to the church group in a in a private message and within his notes that he sent to you and I I talked to him about this and he said he really didn't even know why he was using the words that he was using he said NH HRM we have three more days of camp meeting to climb mountains don't stall or divert keep keep those words in in in your mind push onward and upward he is getting he's speaking of God he is getting the preeminence in all things total breakthrough is in sight and when I read that I'm looking at my notes I'm saying break through the barriers that that was that was what I was wanting to speak that's what the Lord was impressing me and that's what he was dealing with me this morning was breaking through the barriers and I know thank you Jesus I don't I don't say that I don't claim to have a spirit of discernment but God does allow me to see things at times and even in the service at the end of the service last night there are those that I fully 100 100% believe I witnessed a breakthrough Hallelujah am but there were others that got close yeah they got close and they pulled back they stalled yes they diverted yes come on now they did not continue to push through please don't let that be don't let that happen tonight brother Steve just told me don't worry about the time that's right so I'm going to tell you tell you don't worry about the time and I'm not saying don't worry about the time that I'm ministering I'm talking about don't don't worry about time when it comes to Eternal things if you're still trying to push through we're going to stay and push through with you why else would we be here our ultimate goal is to see you make it and if you continue to be repressed you you continue to stall you're never going to break through that barrier Romans chapter 8 verse 38 verse 39 reads for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and if you have him in you then that love of God is dwelling in you this evening also one more place as you're still standing and then I'll let you have your seat second Corinthians chap 10 veres 4 and 5 you could quote it without even turning to it I'm sure would you read it with me tonight for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen you can have your seats see I'm so thankful that you read it it came out across your lips tonight as well it wasn't just me reading it to you you were acknowledging that the weapons of our Warfare are not are not carnal the reason being is our Warfare is not carnal if our Warfare was carnal then he would give us carnal weapons to fight with but our Warfare is a spiritual warfare yes sir our Warfare is not to be with each other right it's not to be debating is this or is that I heard brother I was sharing with somebody the other day I said brother Dan Dey had a a very simple way of bringing things across and he said he he could take profound things and make it very simple something I could understand and and he said that that many times he would be in at preachers meetings and he said I didn't like going to them he said because they they just wanted to argue and fuss and fight over he said it was it was silly things and he said let me give you an example he said there are there are preachers that want to tell you and they are adamant that when God when when God comes back he's coming back on a white horse and he said I'll say Amen with them he says and then the person sitting next to him says no he's coming back on a white cloud and he said I'll say Amen to them and he said I don't care if he's coming back in a white Cadillac all I know is that he's coming back and I need to be ready so we could sit and argue and fuss and bicker and fight over how he's doing it that's right or we could take that time to make sure you're ready when he comes it doesn't matter to me how he does it I just want to know that my life is lining up with the word so when he does come I'm not going to be left alone I I I I'm not one of those people that that um years ago there was somebody that did a a series of books of called Left Behind never have read them I don't plan to read them I don't I have no need to take time out of my life to read a series of books called Left Behind if I saw a set maybe I give it to somebody else that I thought might need it maybe it would help them but it's not going to help me I don't plan on being left behind so what I want to do is make sure I'm doing everything I can to be ready to go amen I'm so thankful that I I'm in a group of people that agree on those things that's right first John chapter 4 verse 16-9 says and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world and and and verse 18 just is so bold to me there is no fear in in love all right so you you got to go back and you look it before that that that he if he dwelleth in you how many claims that he dwells in you yes absolutely okay then there is no fear that's right you just said that he dwelt in you and the scripture says that he is love and there is no fear in love so whenever you start to feel that fear creeping in kick it out you can immediate immediately know that is not of God whatever ever is causing that fear to come toward you and to come into your home and into your life immediately sever that and you're like well that might be one of my friends it might be one of your friends and maybe you need to check your friendships and I'm not I'm not trying to accuse nobody I'm not trying to tell you you need to call all of your friends and say you brother Dwayne said I can't be friends with you no more what I am telling you if they are hindering your walk be careful check it if there if anything is hindering your walk why would why would you want to fellowship with that because it's not drawing you closer to God it is drawing you further away from his presence there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear so that's your opport to to cast them out they try to bring that into your home you cast them out say no I'm not I'm not letting you bring fear I'm not letting you bring anxiety I'm not letting you bring worry I'm not letting you bring doubt see those are all types of things that become barriers in our life like I said I'm trying to speak to you on break through the barriers break through don't come up to them and stall out yeah he that fearth is not made perfect in love and I know in this flesh we struggle with things like that it it's so easy to fear and worry to to to come on come on you but it's at that moment that you have to recognize what's happening Hallelujah that's right I'm not saying that if you have Christ dwelling within you that you're never going to face a battle of fear but I'm telling you that you have a praise that you can give you have a word of God that you can give that can cast that fear out of your life and don't sit there and dwell on it I like I was telling someone the other day it's a little bit little bit back now I was telling them I said that you you know if if if you're dealing with something you're struggling with a certain thing in your life life be careful who you talk to about it cuz sometimes it's so easy to pick up that phone and call your favorite gossip I mean favorite uh person you share information with I want to call it gossip because somebody might get offended at me but you like to share information with and um and then that person wants to share that information with other people and it shared with other people and all it does is build negativity I I was so I was so thankful to hear what you were saying about the family of them they they they did not want negative talk and there's still no negative talk being being spoken now see what they exhibited is that they Trust In The Sovereign God what a God we serve and that is so hard for us to do in our flesh yes sir but the spirit if his Spirit dwells inside of you that spirit is what can call out to his spirit and that can agree those two can agree this flesh does not agree with that Spirit it doesn't but the spir if his Spirit dwells inside of you it can agree with his spirit and you can and it can say I trust in a sovereign God and his will his will is always perfect many times he allows our will as a permissive will and he'll allow you to even go through a permissive will and and receive some blessings even in a permissive will state but that is not my desire to stay in a permissive will my desire is to know his perfect will and it enter into his perfect will there there was a story in in in the Bible uh in the Book of Esther um chapter 4 and and I'm not going to read I've got it I've got it all written out and I could do that but if y'all would give me uh a a liberty to to just kind of paraphrase and and put it in in my words would that be okay I promise you I'm not going to take anything away from it I'm not adding anything to it I'm just putting it into uh a a more condensed version in the in Esther chapter 4 see Esther chapter 3 is whenever a decree was going out you know they were sending out a decree hmon was was going to have have all the Jews killed so in in Esther chapter 4 um you hear the story of Esther having a conversation with morai how many how many knows the story they they have a conversation and uh and so for for so many years brother Steve whenever I would listen to that that being preached on her I would just I would kind of just Breeze over that story in my mind I saw I go over here since you're sitting down right here in my M my mind's eye y'all can't see me over there I'm sorry I'm sitting down in the chair beside brother Steve I pictured Esther sitting down beside Mori and having a conversation and saying hey um you Mori says hey did you hear what's going on did you hear what uh what Hon's doing and Esther would say um no not exactly he said well hey look at this decree read read what they said what's going to happen and um and so in my mind I'm seeing this conversation played out that that uh Esther you know says to Mori something and morai responds back and she they just have they carry on a conversation just like brother Steve and I could while we're sitting here but read through chapter 4 you know what stood between Esther and morai hatak hatak was a messenger they did not sit down and share a conversation something that was leading her to potentially give up her life I mean it it could have been very detrimental for her to walk into the king chamber because that's what she was telling Mori she said hey you you do realize what you're asking me to do is against the law absolutely and I I'm sure the fear that she was feeling because she probably either had heard witness of it of them carrying that law out or there would have been no reason for a trembling there would have been no reason for a concerned if she did not I forgot I have this other thing on yall excuse me I I'm going to set that down now I can I can use both my hands now I can get comfortable praise the Lord so so you have Esther speaking to Mori having this conversation and yet the conversation was not in the same room Mori was out at the gate sack cloth and Ash he he was out there Esther was trying to get him some other clothes saying you know you don't need to dress like that here put put some some other garments on and they're hav't but everything that they spoke about was carried through a messenger how many times have you seen the little game played where you tell one person something and you want them to go tell brother Daniel you want brother Daniel to go back and tell brother Brian and and you you keep going around and and each one tells and it comes down to this side and then they say what the message was and typically it's totally different than what it started with over here that's how it works but see the thing was is hatak had no message of his own he simply carried a word from Esther to to morai Hallelujah and then he listened to what mori's response was and he took that response didn't add anything to it didn't put his own idea to it he took that response and went back to Esther but Esther had to have faith to trust in the messenger that was speaking to her if she would have failed to have faith it would have cost her her life I don't know if you're picking up what I'm trying to to put in front of you but sometimes no not sometimes all the time we must have faith in a messenger that God places in your life that when he speaks to you that he's speaking directly what God wants you and needs you to hear Esther could have sit there whenever hatat comes back to her and says morai said you need to go into the king's chamber even though you haven't been invited and Esther could have stopped and said that doesn't sound like something he would have said I mean I've I've known him a long time that's completely contrary to what he would have been telling me I mean he loves me he doesn't want me to to lose my life but no she had it wasn't that she was so much having faith in the message she had to actually trust the messenger that was bringing the message to her she had to trust that this person was only going to say what the other person said for them to say and it had to go both ways whenever Esther sent a message back to Mori they had to have faith that this person was only delivering what the other person said all right so bring it bring it on down to where I think in chapter 5 whenever she um she goes into the door see let's pull back a second let's let's let's think of her standing at the door uhuh yes what do you think was going through her mind when she stood maybe it was a door I don't know if the door was a 2in thick door if it was a 4 in I don't know I don't know how big the door was I don't how he how heavy the door was but I know for a moment she stood on one side of the door and a decision had to be made either I opened the door and I walked through you didn't know that I was going to say that either I opened the door and I I walk through or I stand on this side of the door and I receive fate whatever is going to befall me Mori was saying if you don't do it you're surely going to die surely going to die when she stood at that door she had to face the fear if I go beyond this barrier it could be death talk to us brother so the battle was at that barrier the pressure was at that barrier when she just got up to it right and and and she could she could have made a choice you know it's too risky I'm going to pull back I'm not going to continue to push through because I don't know exactly what is going to happen on the other side of that barrier that's standing in my way our fleshly desire wants to know the end oh yeah we want to know how God is going to do it amen we want to know when God is going to do it we want to know why he is doing it we want to know where it's going to happen that's the human nature of us I'm I'm not I'm not casting that aside I'm I'm recognizing that that is that's who we are as humans but we go deeper than being human sir if you have his life dwelling inside of you you've got to feed that life don't feed the flesh with fear don't feed the flesh with doubt don't feed the flesh with what you see with these eyes and all your eyes see is this this wall or this this door in front of me and I don't know if I push through that exactly what's going to happen what's it going to cost me right if I actually push through and I get a breakthrough what's it going to cost me in the in at the end so I feel like by what I read in the scriptures that she actually stood there and struggled with that I would I I I could imagine her standing there trembling do I do I do I trust what morai is telling me to do is that really what God wants me to do about it or or I'm safe right now I'm I'm safe right here there's I don't see anybody that's going to harm me that's going to kill me maybe I can I can break through and and break away from that and and I can save my life but see she got to that place and then she she had to push through yes that fear she had to overcome that doubt did and break through that door and it says she went in and she went into to the inner the inner chamber inner Court I forgot how it's I've got it written down um exactly I I I know that it was the inner Court of the King's house that's Esther 51 so where she stood whenever you look at inner Court of the King's house that was referring to the what we would it's it was referring to the middle wall of partition if you look at her and a herodian temple the way it was laid out that's what it was referring to which we would know it was a veil we would consider in the temple that's right that that was the veil that signified the veil but see we know in Ephesians he says that that it's been torn down Hallelujah I believe so now for us there's nothing that's standing between Christ and you except your own fear your own worry he has opened it up that is theuth called for you to come in to the inner chamber to have communion with him we heard about that last night to experience um unhindered communion hallelujah hallelujah that's his desire it is he has made the way possible he has taken down the middle wall of of a petition and opened it up for us to enter into his presence but too many people still think about things that was in their past well that wasn't the way we did it where I used to come from that wasn't the way that I've been taught for the last 40 years well get past your past come on accept what God has for you in this very moment step into his presence break through the barrier of your past many times that becomes one of the biggest barriers for people is our past and Satan loves to bring up your past right he wants to whether it's good what he would call good or negative or bad he just wants you to dwell in the past we don't need to dwell in the things of the past no sir that was back there I'm not supposed to look back look back Lot's wife she was told don't look back he's called you out of that why would you ever want to look back to where you came from Leave it behind you and walk into his glory that he has opened up to you through his word the freedom that he has invited you to come in he wants to commune Hallelujah he wants to have an intimate Hallelujah relationship that's what communion is talking about an intimate relationship with you that's right why would you ever want to push that aside how are you ever going to receive his word in your body if you never have that time of communion with your bridegroom you'll never receive it that's right you'll die you will die if you don't receive his word coming into you amen the message greatest battle ever fought sister charity I don't know if I'll use all my notes or not she she said I forgot to send my notes to her earlier and she said um you didn't use your notes Wednesday night so if you just winging it and um I said I'll try to send send you my notes especially the the the uh the ones the quotes it's a lot harder for them to pick that up that fast greatest battle ever fought says see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listen to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is he he wasn't leaving anything in there every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it brother Brown says now we know that's true a little bit later in that same message he he continues on that thought he said open up that mind that's good that's good that's the Battleground that's where the battle sits in Array right here in the front line that's right your mind open it up and say every doubt I doubt my doubts doubt doubts I recognize my doubts but I'm doubting them right sir I'm doubting my doubts now I'm believing God's word here I come Satan yes sir he said something is going to take place every time sure it will amen I I was reading um a little excerpt from uh Dwight Moody DL Moody and um he he had made a statement that um it says if you would believe you must crucify the question [Music] how if you would believe how many says there are believer Bel ver I'm not trying to play a trick on you if you're not a Believer don't put your hand up but if you are a Believer you must crucify the question how but see Satan wants you to try to reason it out and figure it out and I need to know how God is going to perform how God is going to bring his promise to completion it's not my place to find out how God is going to do anything his ways are Beyond finding out his ways are so far above my ways my finite mind could never comprehend the smallest amount of his mind all I can do is trust his word but I have to crucify the question how and I would add to it you got to crucify the question when it it it seems like it would apply that I've got to I I need to put all of the questions aside if I'm truly going to believe if I'm going to believe his word and I'm going to put my faith completely in him I need to lay all of the questions aside Hallelujah again that doesn't mean that you can't that we can't come to God and and say you know Lord could you show me me could could you reveal to me maybe why I'm I'm I'm going through the the battle I'm going to and I believe at times he chooses to to make that known to us and other times he chooses to hold that back that's right but I believe if he feels that it's in your best interest then he's going he's not going to withhold anything just like a a a your a natural father is not going to withhold any good thing from his son and he's so much greater than our natural father Yes amen yes amen so he's not going to withhold any good thing from you so I would say if it's something that's good it's something that's going to be encouraging it's something that's going to help you then yeah he might choose to reveal that to you or he may choose to withhold it again he's Sovereign we have to trust in a sovereign God we have to we have to accept that we that we know that he said all things work together for the good of them that love God we may not know how we I look at some things and I'm like exactly how is that going to work for my good and he says just be patient just stay with me a little while and and you'll see just believe and watch what he does in um You didn't tell me what time I started see you get you get here and you get in his spirit and you you um you just I I love being in his in his presence um how how many would would agree with me that unbelief can bring death unbelief and many times our unbelief is a strong barrier that stands in front of us and a fulfillment of a promise Satan wants to fill your mind with all types of things that would that would feed the unbelief that would feed the doubt and if we're not careful it would bring death to you there there was a story in 2 Kings 7 and for the sake of time I'm not going to read that entire um chapter um there's a lot of good things in there um but it was talking about um there was a prophecy that that went forth uh from Elisha and he was saying you tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flower be sold for a shekele two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of Samaria and um so there was an individual that was that was told to go and speak to them he was chosen um by the hand of the king um his hand the king leaned and answer the man of God and um so he this person kind of whenever he heard this prophecy he's like um ain't going to happen again I'm paraphrasing I'm putting put in in my lingo he's like how how in the world I I mean for that to happen I mean the skies are literally going to have to just open up and I'm going to watch this stuff fall out of the Skies I mean that's the only way that that could ever happen I mean attitude that was the attitude that he had many times when a promise is given to us right it seems so outstanding that we kind of fall into that category I'll believe it when I see pigs fly yeah you know I I'll see I I'll see it I believe it when I when I see literal Heavens split open and Mana fall down well see you you you go through that 2 Kings 7 and and you also it it it kind of adds in a little story inside there you have that prophecy being said and then all of a sudden it just cuts over and starts talking about these lepers and you know in my mind first whenever you start reading you're like I what happened to the rest of that story there I'm where's Paul Harvey I'd like for him to tell me the rest of the story I mean why did you what what was the purpose of just this little insert of these lepers well it was because of the lepers uhhuh and the trust and the belief that they had yes sir is what brought to pass having all the spoils that's right of the city that they came in and had all of this excess that's right and because of their faith and they're like you if we stay here we're going to die Hallelujah if we go in there might die but God was taking all these little things seemingly nowhere near connected [Music] CU I mean if you'd have stood there while it was going on he'd been like I don't I don't see the connection here well but he used them and in their faith and their belief that brought all of this excess to them to the to the city and then they were literally selling it just like Elisha said in the in the prophecy and the one who is doubting it who is had been placed there to watch over it and he was trampled by all the people coming in yeah to receive the Bounty of blessing you will see it and he saw it but he was not going to partake of it and his unbelief cost him literally cost him his life because of not taking what the man of God told him right and accepting it as truth amen amen it it it means something whenever your pastor stands up here and saysi have a word from the Lord to you it's just not frivolous words coming off of his mouth it it's not to make something some some pretty statement but when he stands here he says the word of through the word of the Lord this is what he has given to me for given to you through me brother Steve said at the at the beginning uh Tuesday evening he said a word had been given to to him how many remembers the word strive yes strive can I show you how that ties in with my break through the barriers how many [Music] knows how many and I'm I'm not sure where I'm at with my notes I'm probably just going to close them up how many knows what year the sound barrier was broken anybody have an idea of when the sound barrier was broken anybody know what the the speed is for to break the sound barrier about 76 some places say 761 some places say 767 somewh around 767 miles per hour to break the sound barrier so anybody any guesses on what year it was we we achieved that 1947 I I I I love things when they when they tie together what what is what's one of the first things that brother brandham says in faith is a substance in 1947 we have these new gadgets what is he talking about a recording the sound barrier was being broken on both naturally yeah and spiritually happening in the same year I'm sorry I don't find that as a coincidence maybe it was I just don't see it that way I believe God chose to allow that to happen Hallelujah that God's voice could be put on a recording Hallelujah the same year that we achieve breaking this natural sound barrier he broke a barrier that his voice because the scripture says in the days of the voice right I never got to meet him I never got to meet him in person I'm not old enough to have been able to meet him but I've heard a voice and I'm so thankful that there was a voice that was given and it it just so happened in my opinion it broke a sound barrier and I believe it it any anyway you can either believe it you don't have to believe it I believe it amen I believe it I believe that um in in um I was speaking about Ephesians um earlier Ephesians chapter 6:1 17 says take the helmet of salvation we were talking about the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal that take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the it's the Rama I know y'all y' y'all are y'all are a church that studies these things out because I I I I know brother Steve I know brother Wesley and they they bring these things out to you it's not the logos whenever it says the word that it was the Rama of God it was a spoken word so it it requires us to speak we we have to break that sound barrier we have to break it yourself and whenever you can speak his word it breaks every F his word amen will break every feder every shackle Hallelujah Every Chain everything that would put bondage on you his word when it's spoken it breaks it it cannot stand in the presence of the spoken word of godall and I would I would I mean I would say there there's a there's a a term that's called breakthrough you know we it's a it's a phrasal verb um which means break through a barrier and you succeed by passively going through it oh you didn't you didn't that doesn't ring true does it no you you succeed by forcing by Push by force in go back to what your pastor told you this morning in the little note that he sent out it's not it's not the time to set back we cannot stop at this at this point that we're in see speaking about the sound barrier whenever you you you look at a plane and and and brother Brown talks about this and I'm I'm probably just going to paraphrase again if that's all right um if you want to see what he said about it I've got it in my notes um I'll happily let you let you see it brother Brown talks about um he's describing when a plane is getting close to that sound barrier and I and I I read about it and I looked at the history on it and and how many different planes was completely torn apart and it broke the plane apart because it was not designed well enough to go beyond the barrier of sound because the sound waves become compressed at the closer you get to 760 milph as they're approaching that the sound waves get so compressed that it literally makes the the the vessel continually shake and tremble and if it's not designed properly it will fall apart bolts will start flying out of it the wings will start breaking off of it but see we have been taught that we are a specially built Bird right amen we're an eagle we have been designed to withstand all of the pressures that's trying to come at you don't sell yourself short don't accept say well I you know I I'm going to be I'm I'm okay to be a chicken or I'm I'm okay to be a Hulk or I'm okay to be a a buzzard or a crow no if you are born an eagle you are an eagle step into your position with the authority that you have that he has given in your life and you can break through H but you have to force through it right it can't be a passive thing even the the planes that are designed yeah to to achieve it uhhuh feel that same pressure sir the pressure is still going to be there it's just the nature of trying to break through it but they still feel a shape they still feel a a tremble of the pressure but they have the ability they have the strength they have the power to break through it brother Brown said whenever you whenever you break when you finally break through that sound barer he said you got 50 mil mil of Elbow Room Hallelujah you feel a freedom freedom he says it's unlimited speed then whenever you break through he's he was talking about the natural planes I I don't I don't know his full understanding of of planes and I don't know about the unlimited speed and all that but I know I can take it spiritually speaking whenever we can break through the barrier that's standing between us and his presence and the thing is you don't have to break it tell because he said I've already torn that Veil apart so literally all that is standing between you and him is this right here there is no literal barricade there is no literal Wall of Separation that stands between you and his presence there is no Veil that is hiding him from you now he took care of that he ripped it apart we ought to be thankful that he did he tore that apart to make himself available and he calls to you and invites you to come in and then your mind gets in the way your mind keeps you out of the presence of God because we continually listen to the little things that Satan wants to tell you and he says you're not worthy to be in his presence you know it's it's good for those other people and and you know you just need to you need to watch and and just observe and and see how God is blessing the other people and and and that's that's good for them and he can bless them but he can't bless you because of this in your life and that happened in your life and this was in your past if you had placed it under the blood never it exactly it never happened in the first place God it does not simply cover it hallelujah hallelujah it don't just cover your sins not in that meaning of the word cover [Music] it completely annihilated you you were you were speaking on I think just a week or so ago you're speaking on atonement at onement his blood completely annihilated when when you say I never did it in the first place what is the first place yeah it's the mind of God right before the foundation of the world yes sir I was with him I was in his mind sir before the foundation of the world and while I was in his mind guess what there was no sin there was no sin in him now in this flesh body that he has allowed me to come and dwell in for a period of time there is sin that's the nature of this flesh but in the beginning it was not so that's right it was not so and I continually remind Satan every single day of where my beginning is that's right yes and I can remind it where my ending is going to be cuz I came from God and I'm going back to God if you were ever with him the only way you can be redeemed is you have to have been with him in the first place you have to be his and if you are his then you are his now and you will always be his oh let's find something else to I talked about 1947 there's another there's another thing and I don't know if I can find it I had a um how many knows there was a statement that was made oh I really want to share this with you good anybody ever heard of a of a phrase that says the only thing we have to fear who said that Franklin D Roosevelt anybody know when he said only thing we have to fear is fear itself 1933 1933 was this country was deep in depression 1933 and it was at his inaugural address that Franklin D Roosevelt stood before the people and and I you know they they'll use that little excerpt of just the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and they stop it there well I'd like to read it in the context just a little bit before and a little bit after he says so first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself he didn't stop there he describes that fear nameless unreasoning unjustified Terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert Retreat into advance and I thought that was pretty astounding I I I like I I love reading things like that and just taking it and then applying it to my spiritual life because that's exactly what fear does it becomes unjustified Terror that literally not figuratively but literally will paraliz people you ever you ever met i' I've met people that become completely paralyzed they have they have no way to control thems the fear gets so strong in their mind again it's only in their mind it's not literal it's not something that's actually people um I don't know the the the word for it off the top of my head it's a type of phobia um where somebody they they're they always think that that something is wrong with them um hypochondriac thank you um I could I could see it but I couldn't think of it exactly but there are people that are that way especially they'll they'll see somebody else going through a a a trial or going through a struggle and automatically they start associating oh you know my my my back's hurting me too is that the okay um let me think of something else you hear somebody say they got a headache man my you know what my head's really been hurting me all day long I didn't sleep good last night just been a I wonder if it's a migraine and then they take it a fur a step further you know what I was reading the other day and this other friend of mine they thought that they had a tumor and that was what was causing them to have headaches you know what I might have a tumor it's unjustified Terror and I I'm I'm making you say you're making light of it I am trying to make light of it because but it's truly a serious condition that people allow themselves to continually stay in and it becomes a cycle of their life and just just because somebody else is having this problem Satan wants to say you know what you you've been feeling those same pains you you've been feeling that same thing oh I bet you're dealing with the same thing they've got no no don't accept that Terror whenever those things take a hold of you guess what it it paralyzes you to the point that you can't lift hands and start giving praise like we said earlier praise is our warfare that's how we can that's how we overcome things but whenever you become paralyzed now now your hands are kept by your side right people get so paralyzed through fear that it places Shackles on their feet and then they're unable to get up and get out of the house and come to the house of God and be in his presence where God can come down and help you break through come on because of fear it literally will paralyze you to and if you if you give into that and you continue to yield to that and you continue to talk about my this and my that and my whatever I don't first off I don't like to use my that's right ain't yours don't don't it ain't your cancer it ain't your TB it ain't your diabetes it ain't yours right you may be fighting against some of those things you may be you may be overcoming the those things but don't don't claim it and don't just go through and say oh man my my my you know my my migraines come on my my stomach problem my my this my that stop with the m tonight when you leave from tonight go forth from tonight and say you know what that's not mine that's something that Satan's trying to put on me and he's trying to make me sign for that box of rattlesnakes but I'm not signing for it I'm not receiving it I'm putting it right back to him and say I'm overcoming it it it matters the way we speak about things sure does power of life and death lies where in the tongue so either we choose to speak life or we choose to speak death we have to make that choice we have to make the choice that I'm not going to accept those things anymore right you know you talking about um our praise is a weapon yes you know the story of Paul and Silas sure whenever they were in in jail they were in prison it wasn't a nice prison like what we have it was a cell a stone area that's that's cut out and they place them back in these areas it's dark and they put them back in there and Paul and Silas sitting there literally in shackles and chains they couldn't move if they wanted to but they chose to take that opportunity to praise a sovereign God that's right and their praise did not only free them sometimes people come into church and they're having a difficult time breaking through amen they they have a a desire to breakthrough but maybe something has oppressed them to a point that they can't absolutely guess what your praise just like Paul and silas's praise that delivered all the rest of them that were there in the prison with them those other people doesn't say that they were worshiping with them doesn't even tell me that I don't know if they entered in at all who knows they might have been telling them would you guys just hush they they might have been saying y'all way too loud y'all are too y y'all are too rambunctious you need to quieten down I'm already I'm having I'm stuck in this hole I really didn't want to hear what you got to say I didn't want to hear you when you was on the outside I don't want to hear you now when you're in here but it was their praise that delivered all of them and it caused a Deliverance to the Jailer hallu he was present but it it didn't even stop at just those that was present it carried on their praise their praise is what delivered him and his house what it's amazing because he he comes in and he calls the the the Jailer Hears A noise he here here's here's a a voice and he calls for a light he hears this racket here's a noise so a noise is is presented and he calls for a light what do we what do we understand is light light is is understanding is revelation he calls for a light and then when that Revelation that light came to him it not only brought him freedom but it brought his entire family freedom because he listened to what was being said by Paul and Silas and he heeded the words that they said said to him and their praise took him completely to a different level it gave it gave him in his home salvation the Lord because he called for a life right he wanted that something needed to be shown in front of him I need to see what's going on here and they they gave him a whole lot more light than he ever thought that he was going to receive they gave gave him his light they gave him the light of the world they gave him Jesus Christ that came in and saved him and his family am we can and we will overcome fear we can and we will overcome worry we will overcome anxiety today can be your time for a breakthrough today is the time that you can move Beyond beond the barriers and maybe you'll sit here tonight and and as we worship in a in a few minutes as you worship don't you don't even have to pay attention to the other people that are around you but keep in mind my level of worship could help bring somebody else out of the prison of their mind so if I knew that my worship thank you thank just take a a moment for a second if I know based on scriptural examples that my level of worship could assist someone into eternal life why would I want to sit down on God because the inverse that could be then said if I don't give him all and I failed to worship him I could then be preventing somebody from Gaining that freedom that they need so I want to be free but not only do I want to be free I want everybody around me to be free and that's that's what I I so love when I when I watch the worship team here and then I I see that it goes from from them through you yeah that is not it's not left up just to brother Benjamin standing up here or those the maybe somebody else that would stand here and take that position it's not just left up to them that you are picking up that Banner as well and you're saying God you can use me too I'm going to give you all of my praise and I'm going to watch you deliver somebody through my praise it's it's great that that that the man of God can stand here the pastor can stand here and and through him and through the Deliverance of the word that Deliverance can come but the Deliverance can come and will come through you as well it's when the word Goes Forth and our praise enters into him it draws us into that presence and it can assist somebody around you to break through the barrier that is in their way if I knew that that I that there was somebody stuck in behind a wall and I heard them crying out and crying out and crying out and I wouldn't take the time to go over to that wall and do my best to break through the wall for them what good of a personel I last last night we got home call it home sister Sharon's home that's what we tell tell Liam we're going home and um so we we got we got to the house last night and we get out of the the car and and I didn't turn turn The the lights on in the in the um the garage there so I I had because the lights were on in the car and as we shut everything down it was getting dark and and there was a light in the hallway that we could see how to how to get through so I didn't take the time to turn all the bright lights on and we get in in the house and I'm I'm walking through the the the kitchen and Heather says where's Liam I said we got him out I mean he followed you didn't he and she said I didn't I didn't see him come in so I'm asking the kids where where's Liam I haven't seen him haven't seen him so in a frantic Panic I'm headed back toward the garage C I knew that all the lights were turned off and the door was closed closed and locked and as I was coming down the hallway I Heard a Voice saying Daddy Daddy Dad that pulls on you and I'm I'm I'm yelling his name out I'm I'm I'm on my way I'm coming I'm you're okay Daddy's right here and I go and I open the door and he's just standing there like you know he didn't know what to do because he was standing in the dark and there's so many people but I call the law it wasn't it was an accident and I wouldn't have been able to share it in my message tonight if it hadn't have happened but when we cry out to he does not hesitate to answer I don't care if it's been 10 years since you called out to him when you say father guess what he is right there right there to respond to you and I think many times we we just get we get lacad isical yes sir we get complacent in the life that we live and we don't take time to recognize number one Lord I'm standing in a dark [Music] place I don't know how to get out of this place and some people just decide just to stay there and take up a bod in a dark place of their life and they just stay there and they never take time to Simply call out oh Jesus this the thing is is he's just waiting when you call out to him he will respond amen doesn't matter I was only going out of the room for about two and a half minutes right but he was already calling wanting to know where daddy was because he trusted that if he kept calling my name that I was going to hear it and I was going to respond it may have been more than two and a half minutes for you it may have been more than two and a half years for you there may there there we may be sitting here tonight with with people that have have never cried out to him but all it takes is you turn to him and you call to our heavenly father and he is going to break down every wall that standed between you and him and he's going to make his way to you and receive you back to him he has given you the authority he's given you the the tools necessary to achieve a breakthrough it's in his word we have to place it we heard it again last night we have to place it within our own mouth amen and we have to speak thus sayith the Lord Lord whenever you speak what is in this holy word you are speaking thus sayeth the Lord I don't question any of it I don't understand all of it but I don't question it I know that his word is forever true it is forever settled in heaven Hallelujah there is a there there's a little statement that I want to I want to add in here and and and close the service um tonight um excuse me as I as I find it um oh forgive me I I'm so out of out of notes that uh with the musicians come this evening 1959 in the message Abraham's seed you have that one this this is a very sticky statement when a child of God here it is get it when a child of God begins to break through that Dark Mist of unbelief and gets a hold of God's promise and begins to draw from it you have to go back in that message he's talking about drawing from Emanuel he's the he's talking about I'm sorry drawing um from elhi um he he's so begins to draw from it draw from it it how many of us do that it shuts up about its sickness Hallelujah prophet of God said just shut up about it if you have given it over to God you have accepted that he's given you a promise and there's a promise in his word then why do you keep talking about it why do you want to keep bringing it up in your conversation in in in Dwayne Jackson's term he said just shut up about it enough's enough if you're going to take it to God and you're going to draw from him and you're going to trust him then let it go let it go shut up about your sicknesses don't continually bring it up again don't get on the phone and keep sharing about I'm dealing with this and I'm dealing with that and I'm dealing with the other I don't need to hear that I don't want to hear that Prophet said if you're going to draw from it uhuh then shut up about the sickness says it begins to draw from it it satisfied glory to he says they don't sell well my my hand's no different in other words I prayed for my hand but my hand's no different is don't even look at the hand anymore why it's looking at where its strengths coming from and my strength Cometh From The Lord so either either we trust in him or we don't either we leave it with him or we don't either we say God is taking care of me and I'm going to shut up about it from now on I'm not going to continually bring it up and keep talking about it and just rehearsing the problem that that I have because that all that does is feed doubt it feeds worry that's trth y'all y'all I don't know if I've shared it with y'all I probably have somebody might not have been here before the little phrase what if my definition of what if worry helps anxiety turn into fear you sit around and you let Satan fill your mind with what if what if what if all that continually does is feed the the anxiety and takes it to the next level which then becomes fear and fear has no place within you it brings torment exactly what it does unjustified Terror that becomes paralyzing again against us you know there's a there's a word that we can speak that can break through that it's the name of Jesus you can speak his name and it will break through any any struggle any problem I'm not telling you that struggles aren't going to come that's a part of breaking through that is whenever you recognize I'm going through a struggle just say I'm almost to that sound barrier I must be getting closer to that sound barrier because it keeps shaking and it keeps shaking me and I keep feeling the pressure and keep feeling the pressure that's not a time to stall that's not a time to say I'm going to pull back and I'm going to divert my cores that's the time that you say Satan on no matter what you throw at me on I know who I am I know the authority that has been placed Within Me by the word of God and I'm going to continue to push my way past the barrier that he wants to put in front of me and if all I can do is say the name of Jesus sometimes you're in a place nothing else can come to you and all all you have the strength to do is call out his name that's a truth you call it out call it out and you continually to call his name because whenever you call his name he will respond he will respond can y'all y'all seeing I just want to speak the name of Jesus G I think I do it in G I know but I have to do it in G I think can you do it in G because I have to do it low and then I go high y'all have the words to I just want to speak the name of jesusall I would invite you to stand with me Hallelujah this evening this is the way that we are going to

that are simply standing near the door father you showed it to me as plain as I can say they're standing at the door with a decision to be made will I enter in or will I stay on this side Lord you've told me that the only way the breakthrough will come is if the door is pushed open an effort must be made to enter into your presence Lord you have not shown me the individual or individuals that you were talking to me about but Lord you did reveal to me that there was those last night that were just so close so close to a complete breakthrough to enter into your sweet presence they felt the trembling they felt you near them they felt the tension and they diverted they stalled just before their breakthrough father would you come you're here you're here let's not rush him at this moment father you're standing on the other side of the door and you're actually beckoning for them to enter into your presence that they may finally find the peace that their heart desires [Music] s Lord

vomit why would you say that because he said so he said I would that thou W hot or cold but it's the religious that get lukewarm I'm I'm reading something into it I I'm guilty but you can get hung if you're if you're hot you're hot if you're cold you're cold but we get hung in the middle when we get hung up in our boundaries and we think because we hear the tapes or because we go to jur I know people around this truth that believe if if I can just get my children in church if they'll just be in service after service after service after service after service after service it's not about some performance it's about an experience amen and if you don't think that this message teaches us to have a an experience with God yeah I don't know what T I don't know what you've been listening to every man's got to have a pillar of fire experience for himself somebody said well I know the preachers have to have a taste of the original Mana before they can get in the pool pit you better have a taste you better have a taste of the original Mana that's right because when they stored it up and tried to make some kind of I don't know what I an easier way or a fast food way or something I don't know what they were trying to do but they tried to store it up because God said this is how it should be harvested and this is how it should be consumed but they thought well we'll just gather some extras we get toward the Sabbath and we'll be ready but the Bible said it it uh breed worms I'm not going to preach but if I wanted to I I would on brother you wouldn't have to stay there's no no uh in spite despite what some people say there are no locks on the doors you go and come as you please revolving door but I want you to know it uh it's it it it had maggots it bred crawling worms and it was rotten it stank one day before it was the gift of God one day before it was the gift of God to sustain the hungry people but because they misused and abused the manner that God had sent it bred maggots you like saying that don't you brother I do because if I say that out from under the anointing I gag that that's that's how that word affects me I can see them when I say them you understand sir but that's what that's how I want you to see it I want you to see that the thing that sustains you one day if you mandle it if you misapply it if you misappropriate it it can breed worms and be rotted the next day and bring death to you God never intended it to be that way he wanted it to be a daily h a daily bread give us this is Jesus Jus praying it it ought to be a good prayer if Jesus prayed it give us this day our daily bread you're not talking about the stored up word of the message are you no no not not not not uh in general in Broad terms but I will tell you that if you start trusting in a book or a tape instead of a real Jesus I mean a knowing with him a relationship with him it'll become religion to you it'll become religion to you and you'll find yourself lukewarm and and can you imagine Jesus saying I'd rather you be frozen than religious I'd rather you be frozen I would that thou W hot or cold but the lukewarm I'll spew out of my mouth folks don't you let yourself get in a lukewarm State amen you plug into him you don't have to have somebody pray for you you don't have to have a healing line all you have to have is faith to call on him I saw the Lord the let me just give you this as you leave the Lord did something for me tonight I saw his word come to pass in my heart in my life the the psalmist said when when uh uh I prayed for them I saw their trouble he talked about his trouble but when I saw somebody else and I prayed for them he said my prayer returned you with me to my own bosom and I I didn't know it but when I was praying for Hannah I was praying with every bit of faith I had like you were and I didn't know all I knew is the Lord wanted me to pray for her but I didn't know that at the same time I was praying that for her the Lord was lifting a heavy burden I didn't know it till it was done and I and I turned around and when I turned around I knew my heart wasn't heavy anymore that God had take cast all your cares look at your neighbor and say cast all your cares on him because he cares for [Music] you thank you brother thank you thank you why don't you love somebody near you as we get ready to [Music] go oh [Music]

whether she would live or die and he raised his scepter she bowed and just touched the tip of his scepter and she was more beautiful in that moment than she had ever been before she found favor in his sight and you saved your Covenant people because of a woman who recognized for such a time as this I can't depend on anybody else to do it this is my time I have to be the one I have to be the one
