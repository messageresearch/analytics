is going to lead us in worship in just a moment but i wanted to greet you as we start our service today i wanted you to know that everything is going to be all right because jesus is still lord hallelujah nothing has knocked him off of his throne nothing has taken his authority from him not even coronavirus jesus is lord yeshua is lord of lords and king of kings you may be watching this today and you may feel really ill really sick your symptoms may be really weighing you down but i just want you to do the best you can to enter in with us today you didn't have to get dressed up most of you you could just stay in your pajamas we are just a handful one two three four five just six of us here uh only absolute necessary staff we are doing this because so many in the congregation uh are fighting that old virus and we didn't want to do anything else for it to be spread any further and yet i'm excited to be here today i mean that from the bottom of my heart i woke up wanting to be here and i want to try to encourage you i want you to know that it's going to be all right god is bringing you through just like he has brought the rest of us through if you are fighting the virus and you're at home i want to just say to you that there are good days and bad days in the process we came through this in october and we didn't talk a whole lot about it but god was so gracious and the fever would come and go sometimes you'd wake up feeling better than you did when you went to bed and sometimes it'd be vice versa and uh there are all kinds of symptoms that go along with it headache would come and go and some of you have already lost your smell and your taste but it'll come back in jesus name i believe it will and so if you are feeling better one day and not so good the next day don't be discouraged and think that you got to go through the whole thing again it's a process jesus is lord over every bit of it i don't know why you have to go through it i don't know why i had to walk through it but i know that we came through stronger in his name and i know you will as well and of course i'm speaking primarily to the new hope revival ministries people but i'm just speaking to whoever is watching this today live on the new hope app or facebook or youtube and if you're fighting another battle maybe you're not fighting the virus but you're fighting other battles maybe you're grieving because you've lost a loved one and you need the help of the lord well i want you to know that he is as close as the mention of his name let's bless him let's sing bless the lord o my soul bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name or he alone is worthy today hallelujah even in sickness he has done great things [Music] oh he has done great things he has done great things bless his holy name lift up your hands and sing one more time bless the lord oh my soul and off that is within me

great he has done great things bless his holy name lord i want to thank you i want to thank you for who you are i want to thank you for the great things that you have done and how you have brought us through we want to go to the lord in prayer right now as we open our service today and then we're going to enter into a season of worship i tell you i feel his wonderful presence around us right now and i'm asking him to do the same for you that you would focus that you would put your heart here with us and you would begin to meditate on the goodness of the lord even in the midst of your sickness your weariness your troubles and i'm believing that god will manifest his presence in your home in your automobile your place of work wherever you may be seeing this whether life or by archive i want you to experience that wonderful presence of the lord that comes in that moment that we focus on him we forget the best we can about everything else around us and we let our faith lift him up to his rightful position oh he is strong and mighty he is a god of battles he has everything in his great big capable hands today and we want to dedicate this time to him let's pray father we come to you in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ we present our needs and we are not ashamed to say there are many there are many of our own church folks fighting the virus most of them with mild to moderate symptoms but nonetheless it's a battle and us not being able to gather together today is hard on some people more for some than others but there are people who depend on this corporate anointing and so lord i can only ask that by a supernatural power you would allow this sweet anointing that has come into this room today to be transferred through technology into any home that's making you lord right now that's focusing on you i pray for the sick and the afflicted in the name of the lord jesus christ we rebuke and resist the symptoms of this virus we ask you lord to let today

in our hearts when we think of the goodness of jesus when we think of all that you have done for us there's something on the inside of us that cries out we can't help ourselves we are a thankful people today to serve such a god the one true living god the god who really cares for his children oh bless his wonderful wonderful name [Music] what a joy it is to be able to worship the lord today in spirit and in truth and you would never know by what we feel you would never know that the building is empty today in fact i don't believe it is i believe what the word teaches us i believe that this room is filled with the angelic host of god they've come because we're lifting up and exalting the name of the lord who is worthy to be praised worthy to be praised i want us to go to the lord in prayer again in a moment and then i'm going to sing just a little bit of what a healing jesus and it's maybe in g but i'm not sure because no matter how you feel right now he hasn't lost his power to heal you or to deliver you from whatever has you in its grip i just want to say that god is with us today and we want his name to be praised i only have a little battery on the laptop here and we're in the process of moving things in and out of my office here at the church a little bit of not really a remodel but uh putting in a new desk and and so things are scattered and i don't know where my power cord is so i only have just a few minutes here to say hello to all of you who are streaming this service i'm not able to pull up right now all of your names on facebook but i see so many precious people and many of you are streaming on the app and if you don't have the app you can get the app just search for new hope revival ministries it's available in both platforms you can hold it then in the palm of your hand there's wonderful preaching there by brother branham and our services are also there we have some messages from brother perry green there's wonderful music on there that will also be a blessing and an encouragement to you and you can just have it right there on the app but many are watching by facebook and i just greet you all in the name of the lord from british columbia and from lagrange georgia about an hour up the road and over in columbus and uh sister marie i don't know where you're living these days but we greet you and remember the time that you were here with us all of my precious brothers from so many places brother tommy from ireland god bless you sir we salute you in the wonderful name of jesus i have also been getting texts and selfies of some of our congregation who just snapped a picture of themselves watching and they wanted me to know that the congregation is with me so i appreciate that so much we welcome virtual amends you can text them you can comment them on facebook or youtube and you say it doesn't make any difference it does make a difference in fact sometime when the enemy's beating us up during the week we just go back i i'm not ashamed to tell you i just go back and read the amens and i say to the enemy somebody was helped somebody got a touch somebody was encouraged and then in turn that encourages me so god bless you for that and we'll take more selfies of you watching the service today it just it does seem odd for the congregation not to be here but uh many families are gathered together and are worshiping the lord with us and uh i don't know the numbers you know i know they're they're fact driven people who need the numbers but i don't have the numbers i don't know exactly how many people in our congregation are fighting the virus but i want to say by the grace of god they're fighting it at home thus far not any of them are in the hospital and none of them seem to be in a life-threatening place this morning all to the glory of god i want to thank him for the way that he has ministered and moved especially to the elderly and those who may have some predisposition or already some uh you know different things in their body that make them a little more vulnerable maybe lung issues or blood pressure problems and god's just being so good and we want to give him praise we want to be mindful of others who are suffering who are in the hospital in other places some on life support and we just trust mighty king jesus he's able to deliver so we don't mind to say that we would like for you to pray and continue to pray for the families here who are touched uh in many cases one has had a test and the rest of the family fighting the same symptoms have not been tested but all quarantined at the same time hopefully to get all of this behind us the last time in the fall when some of these things begin to come it was such a stressful time such an unsure time and there was it was hard to come to peace it was hard to reach down and pull up any joy but i want you to know uh this week tomorrow will be a week ago that we realized there would be some spread among us one sister had probably already contracted it on her job and so last monday we realized there was going to be a spread because of the contact and from that moment until today i have had an unexplainable peace i i just want you to know that there has been a peace that has surrounded me now it's been a busy week and we've been we've been trying to reach out and stay in touch as much as possible with those who are fighting and that has certainly taken a lot of our time and our energy to do that but in all of that there's just been peace and the testimonies that have come back pastor god is with us he's helping us through things are a little better this evening than there were this morning all so positive and then this may be offensive to some please forgive me if it is but there's been a joy you know joy is not happiness you you can be happy but that's based on your circumstance usually but joy is something that for me it's god-given and the enemy hates it i mean he hates joy in the heart of the believer and somebody said well why do you think that is brother shelley well the scripture tells us because the joy of the lord is our strength and i have felt his joy this week deep down bubbling up a time or two just bubbling up knowing just i think it's the spirit of god just whispering to me i've got this i've got this everything will be all right the battle is hard if any of you other than our own congregation you've been through this you know the symptoms are hard and even those who have cases where they stay at home it's hard to get through it it's there's so much uncertainty about it and unknown about it but even in all of that god is leading his dear children along and i want to thank him for that and we do want to go to the lord in prayer and we want to ask for his special grace i know that many of you out there have needs and we want to lift those needs to you for you to the throne today we want to mention again that sister joyce greeley her mother passed away this week not from covid but she was battling for a long time and almost made it to her 90th birthday and what a testimony i streamed the memorial service for her yesterday and what a testimony she has left among her family and in the community and in the congregation there and it just i don't know i just felt so blessed and inspired by the words that were spoken over her life we want to remember sister joyce and her sister loretta and their families to god we want to remember sister joyce's dad brother ira that god would be with him and help him and uh i over 60 years i believe they were together married over 60 years and so they're going to he's going to need the help of the lord and we want to stand with him in prayer we want to lift up the family of sister pruitt brother tr tim pruitt's wife who went home to be with the lord after a lot of battles and a lot of victories and in god's sovereign will he just said to sister karen pruitt come on home and i know that family trusts god with everything they have but we want to lift up that congregation in louisiana today we want to lift up the man of god brother tim pruitt and we want to pray for his family and in other churches where there have been loss of lives we want to pray that god's comforting hand would be upon them i want you to pray for every home that's been touched among us with the covet virus that god will give them overcoming deliverance and a great testimony to follow while we are stream only for a couple of weeks we're not going to slack up in praising him worshiping him and preaching god's uncompromised word we want to remember sister audrey in our church and sister that has just had some treatment nerve treatments that god will quickly breathe uh recuperation and restoration into her and sister bonnie's been taking care of sick folk at her house and we want to ask the lord to strengthen her and give her special touch today and there are many others but god sees them and he knows them all let's bow our heads again and go to god in prayer we come back to you lord in prayer today knowing that you know more about these needs than we know you know exactly what each one is going through and what they're dealing with today and so we won't start to try to tell you how to help them we'll just say lord help we need your help we wave the white flag of surrender and we say lord you are sovereign you are mighty you sit above it all and you never make a mistake our hope is in you our trust is in you we know lord that you are more than able we have placed our faith in you and we thank you for what we've seen you do and we give you glory for ministering comfort to the grieving lord and where there are decisions to be made in families we lift up the name of jesus and we ask that you would undertake lord in those lives as they begin to sort out their life spouses losing their companions lord how they need you we pray for sister audrey sister bonnie and so many more who need strength today who need your help today we pray for every home that's been touched by this virus not only in new or revival ministries but in the little group in lagrange we lift up those people to you as well and we lift up every congregational god that's being touched by this may you bring them through with faith may the word go forth today in power whether it's in person or virtually we thank you that you've given us technology to be able to continue to declare the truth of god's word come now today lord help us in a moment or two as we approach your word give us special grace to accomplish everything that you would desire in the precious name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah we pray amen and all the saints said amen amen that's exactly right we didn't practice this but i want to just sing a little what i can remember without the words i want to sing just a little bit of what a healing jesus he's a healer you may feel so sick today but he's a healer he's still jehovah rapha he's the lord god who healeth all of our diseases that's who he is worship with me sing it with me if you know it while walking by the sea come and follow me jesus call and then all through galilee the sick and the diseased he healed them all [Music] now jesus hasn't changed his power is still the same as when he walked the shore this god of yesterday he's still the healing jesus now [Music] jesus i found in you yes i have what i hear jesus [Music] you restore refresh and renew your my healing jesus such a time as this arise on healing wings thou of shalt

your home there would you would you just thank these that have come brave soldiers mary beth and benjamin have come god bless you both i'd like to have a maybe another worship song at the end of the service if at all possible and god bless all of you who are here virtually for every amen for every comment for everyone that is claiming their healing right now to the saints in kenya we believe god to break through and bring healing to those who are suffering there from the virus so many wonderful friends are watching today and i don't want to take all that time brother joe writers in south africa god bless you brother so many and others in south africa as well just know that we love you each one greetings to my brother in uganda god bless you today we have been in a series that we have called the seven offices of the holy ghost i'm still not convinced that that is the best title it seems to me like these are ministries or administrations you say well you might could call them the workings of the holy ghost well there's so many more than seven of those the holy ghost is busy i'll tell you that the spirit of god is busy and he works in the life of the believer never sleeping but always there and always available in just a moment we're going to go to romans chapter 1 and we're going to read verse 1 2 3 and 4 so you can open your bible and get ready to read romans uh let me say i think i'll just do romans 1 verse 3 and 4. romans 1 verse 3 and 4 i'll read it in the king james and then i will read those two verses in the amplified as well let me mention here that uh we don't have a lot of birthdays this week on the calendar i hope i'm not missing somebody's birthday but i saw that next saturday is sister anita curry's birthday and i want you to pray a special blessing over her as she works so hard beside her husband who is in a battle for his life but satan is defeated and jesus is the victory and so we want to lift her up to the lord as they lead a little congregation about an hour from here and we want to be an encouragement to them and uh as far as we know right now we will be stream only virtual this coming tuesday night and the following sunday and the following tuesday night as well you say well that's a long time it is it's a long time but we're going to do everything we can to follow the leadership of the lord and if that's changed if god gives us another instruction or leads us to know what to do differently we'll do it so you be flexible if you're part of this local congregation but as we know right now we will gather in person together again on sunday august the 22nd and we're looking forward to that just taking just taking two sundays uh for the virtual service but we just strongly encourage our local believers to participate in every one of these services so that you can remain encouraged and you can stay ready for whatever god has i don't know how to explain this i don't really know how to talk about what i have been feeling i've tried in the last couple days i've sent out a few texts to or to try to explain what i feel but i feel like that we are crossing through something passing through something right now a time of difficulty it's not the only one we've ever had as a body but it it just feels targeted and when i say that i mean it in the best of ways it feels like that we are getting something behind us now you know in the natural we know that so many having this virus will help us in the long run uh it will create a hurt immunity among us that will be good for the future we have to be careful we need to be wise i have been told that by by a medical doctor that this variant of the virus what they're calling delta is more contagious than the first go-around of the virus and that every person who has it is likely to infect at least nine people and even though the death rate is lower uh it seems to be more contagious and going around each person who has the virus with a healthy body before will create antibodies that will strengthen the the immunities and the systems of the body for the future so i know that in the natural us coming through it as a body of believers is a positive thing i i know there are many who have said if you have the holy ghost you won't get the virus well you've come way too late to tell me that because i was there when it happened and i guess i ought to know i know the day that god filled me with the baptism of the holy ghost and i know that he has kept me and when i made mistakes he pulled me up and has led me into truth and i want to thank the lord for the work of the holy ghost in my life so i don't believe that and somebody said well the bible said no plague shall come nigh thy dwelling well i want you to know that doesn't necessarily mean we won't be touched with the same kinds of things that the world is touched with but there is a grace in goshen there is a grace when we are in christ and he helps us to overcome maybe it's inch by inch but we are overcoming daily and jesus is the victor he is lord over every circumstance and so i know naturally it's a good thing to get this behind us but it's spiritual that i'm sensing that we are coming through something as a body nothing gives you compassion for one another like you experiencing something and someone else experiencing the same kind of hardship there is a camaraderie there is a there there is something that that we can relate to one another with what i'm trying to say as a pastor to my local group to those who are a part of this ministry it's that i know god is bringing us through this for a reason and there's a reason for this season and his grace is all sufficient i feel like in some way it is a red sea experience we are passing out of something through a narrow place and we are coming in to something on the other side that will be a larger place and we have so much to give god thanks and praise for as we emerge just i don't know a few days from now a week from now whatever it is as we emerge from this place may it be said about us that we come through with more of the victory that we come through it with more love one for another more compassion one for another may it be that god accomplishes something in us during this season that a season of goodness or a season of all favor would not have been able to accomplish you know so many uh say when the when the going gets rough the tough get going or how does that go when the when the going gets tough when the going gets rough it's it's a tendency for people to run in another direction uh but i want you to know something i'm claiming today that it will be for you a determination to let your roots go down deeper into god's holy truth and realizing that our only place of safety and hope is in the solid rock of ages in god's precious holy and revealed word we are surrounded by uncertainties our nation and our world is upside down but i want you to know you've got somebody in you today greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and i am so thankful to know that i know that i know that i know in whom i have believed and i know that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day now we have been talking about those offices of the holy ghost and we talked about the spirit of life and we talked about the spirit of truth and we talked about the spirit of adoption today we're going to begin a study that will keep us busy for the next few services on the spirit of holiness so you that have not been with us in this study let me go ahead and give them to you again and you can write them down so that they can be a part of your prayer life i have made them a part of my prayer life lord fill me today with the spirit of life lord jesus thank you for the spirit of truth number two and let that truth continue to work in me and number three the spirit of adoption that's bringing us into a closer relationship with the father so that we may become his fully trusted sons and he might endue us with the power of the spoken word to decree and to declare a thing and then stand back and watch mighty god take care of it he's a creator and this spirit of adoption that we have been studying is working in us by the holy ghost to bring us into a deeper relationship and into a closer place of intimacy with the lord even in this wicked hour so today number four we're back to number four the spirit of holiness romans chapter 1 and verse 3 and 4 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh now we're talking about the natural body of our lord made after the son of david the seed of david according to the flesh and verse 4 and declared to be the son of god with power so in one way the son of david the seed of david in the flesh with a natural heritage but in the spirit much much more than just the seed or the son of david in the spirit declared to be the son of god with power and then here is the phrase according to the spirit of holiness let me read it again and declare to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness spirit of life spirit of truth spirit of adoption spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead now i'm going to read it again because i chopped it up concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection of the dead thank you lord for the work of the holy ghost the spirit of holiness that has declared jesus to be more than a son of david in the flesh but also to be the son of god with power he has been identified as the son of god by the power of the holy ghost stay with me now because i want us to go somewhere in our study today now let me read this in the amplified you may not have it but perhaps they're going to be able to pull it up there and we will read it in the amplified if not then that's okay you you can uh follow along with me or you might pull it up on your smartphone or something the gospel regarding his son who as to the flesh his human nature was descended from david now don't miss that it's a good thing to think of his human nature after the flesh was descended from david verse 4 and as to his divine nature according to the spirit of holiness was openly designated the son of god in power in a striking triumphant and miraculous manner it was all supernatural by his resurrection from the dead even jesus christ our lord the messiah the anointed one i think i could read that again verse 4 and as to his divine nature according to the spirit of holiness was openly designated the son of god in power in a striking triumphant and miraculous manner by his resurrection from the dead hallelujah even jesus christ our lord even jesus christ our lord the messiah the anointed one so it is by it is with power it is with power that jesus has been declared and demonstrated to us as the son of god it has been accomplished by one of the offices of the holy spirit of the holy ghost and the office or the ministry or the administration of the holy ghost that has revealed jesus to be the son of god by power is the spirit of holiness say that with me the spirit of holiness now this is a very important work a very important office that the holy ghost is keeping in our life we must experience a continual process of cleansing by the spirit of holiness that's working on the inside of the inside of the inside of who we are so many times when we hear the word holiness we get only an outward image in our mind and we see a particular dress code or a uniform that we have come to identify as holiness people but i want you to know it is that but so much more the spirit of holiness is not something that works on the believer from the outside in but the spirit of holiness works on the inside of the believer changing our heart and transforming us into a place of real relationship with jesus christ it is not religion that's going to cause us to draw closer to him it's relationship that's going to make a difference in this hour and it is god's will to operate in the individual's life by the spirit of holiness to bring us into a closer place you see we are moving from slavery to sonship we're moving from a place of bondage to a place of authority and we cannot do it without the word and the way the word works in our life is by the power of the holy ghost if we know about the word that the letter killeth but the spirit the breath of god is what makes the word even the letter of the word be quickened to life it's jesus christ the living word that is transforming his bride into his wife it is by jesus christ the living word that we move from a place of betrothal to a place of intimacy with him so that we become one there is a oneness that god desires to bring us through bring us into and one of the ways that this oneness is being worked in us is by the spirit of holiness so i want to thank god for that holiness is not about religion holiness is not just following a set of rules or restrictions it's so much more than that holiness is about relationship so we want you to understand that the holy ghost working in your life as a believer he will work by the spirit of holiness to bring you into a place where you're where your walkie walkie will meet and match your talkie-talkie do you understand you know we have we have lots to say but it's not what we say that's going to make a difference in the world we're living in now it's what we live it's what we display it's what we demonstrate and so what we do in our in our outward life is an overflow of what's going on in our inner life so don't you think for one minute that brother shelly is trying to say today that it doesn't matter how we present ourselves in the outward man it matters so much it matters even more now than it has ever mattered in the history of the world that we are distinguished as god's end-time bride by the way we conduct our business by the way we we live in society even by the way we dress by the way we conduct ourselves even in behavior where we go how we live what comes out of our mouth what kind of talk are you having these things matter modesty matters it matters in a world that has thrown morals out the window it is not the will of god for the bride of jesus christ to look like act like talk like dress like just the carnal the the secular person the the unregenerated sinner out there and it's not the will of god either for the bride of christ to conduct herself and to fashion herself like the churches of this world the denominational churches of this world who have forsaken all concept all concept of it mattering how you conduct yourself how you present yourself even how you dress yourself in a lewd and and vulgar way this goes on in the average church today but it's not happening among the bride of christ because she is being constantly dealt with ministered to pulled by the spirit of holiness that's working on the inside of her to bring her into the image and the character of the lord jesus christ are you with me so i know that when you hear holiness you may immediately think of the outward but i want you to begin to immediately think of the n word because what is on the inside is going to manifest itself on the outside the way you you allow the holy spirit to work in your heart it's going to testify by the way you present yourself in public we are we are of a different spirit we are i believe the bride of christ is called to an excellent spirit and i believe that she must present herself in the public with an excellent spirit on her she she is not presenting herself as the downtrodden and those who have no hope she is carrying herself as somebody who knows her god and as the book of daniel says those who know their god shall be what strong and they shall do what exploits in his mighty name and so when when the bride goes out into this world we're not going out with depression written all over us and uh hopelessness written all over us and our hair all hanging down in our face like we don't care how we look or how we present ourselves no we take some we take some effort to realize that we are ambassadors of the lord jesus christ and everything about us testifies of something now our focus in this hour must be on allowing the spirit of holiness to work in us the character of jesus christ and that is not an external work first it is an internal work first let the holy ghost and the spirit of holiness transform change our hearts change our minds and bring us into a better testimony a better reflection of who jesus is because holiness is about relationship it's not about rule keeping it's not about measurement all these things maybe church standards they may be the work of the holy ghost as he flows out of us to to maintain a testimony in a dark lost hopeless world but we must focus first on letting god shape our character and bring out integrity in the bride integrity in the hearts of the real believer getting out all dishonesty getting every bit of that out and the way that we sometimes spin the story that we tell because we have a motive in mind the holy ghost wants to work in us by the spirit of holiness to take out all the spin so that when we speak we let our yea be a and our nay be nay is anybody with me am i getting any virtual amens here yes i'm getting a few i'm getting some somebody is listening to me our yea ba our nay binay our language not be bitter and sweet all running together but may the trumpet give a distinction may the sound of the trumpet not be confusion then the troops they don't know whether to stand still whether to advance whether to retreat but if the wars trumpet gives a distinct sound and a distinct signal then the army will know what to do do we stand and hold the ground do we move forward into victory into battle or do we pull back just a little bit and take a moment to reflect on what we're really doing and what manner of people we are we need a very clear clarion call we need the holy ghost to help us in that manner and we need to make sure that there is consistency in our life in our behavior in our testimony on our job how we conduct ourselves without prejudice may god burn out of us by the spirit of holiness any kind of prejudice that we carry whether it's racial prejudice or prejudice against someone we don't like or someone's personality or behavior that we don't like and it skews us and causes us to be prejudiced toward that person and not really give them a fair chance to pull themselves up like you and i want the chance when we fail when we make a big old blunder we want there to be grace we want everybody to show us grace grace and then in turn brother sister we need to be willing to show that same kind of grace can i get an amen somebody hearing me now we want to in turn be able to minister that same kind of grace to others so holiness above all is about relationship our god and creator longed to have fellowship with his own created ones i want you to understand that we were not built like computers we were not built like robots without a will without choice without the power to decide how we wanted to to live our life when we speak of predestination we're not speaking of god forcing someone to serve him in a harsh manner and in a way that would really eliminate any free will or any choice that's involved this is not what we mean we mean by the scripture predestination is foreknowledge it's god seeing and knowing oh before the foundations of the world those who would who would actually use that choice that free will to choose him and when he saw in eternity that you and i would choose to serve him in that moment he gave us a destiny that is fixed for us one that he will watch over one that he will guard one that he will be jealous of one that he will get glory for his name in this is what i mean when you hear me mention predestination and it's so wonderful to know that we have been chosen by god and because of that we are here on the earth with a purpose and that is he was looking for a people that would become so much like him that there is no strain no stress no difference in their fellowship oh let me tell you something there are people that we are more comfortable with than others you can't deny it you can't deny it there are people that you are more comfortable with than other people there's something about their likes their dislikes there's something about the way they they demonstrate their personality maybe you like more quiet people maybe you like louder demonstrative people uh i i don't know exactly what to say maybe a certain kind of personality makes you nervous and so it's not that you don't love everybody i hope but it's that you have a tendency to fellowship with those who are of a different nature than the one that makes you nervous maybe someone a little more relaxed a little more chill like they say uh we have a tendency to gravitate toward people that we enjoy being with uh we don't always make the extra effort that we should to draw others in especially uh if if others uh are are disturbing us you know we have this tendency to to flock with those to click with those who uh really don't challenge us and that's not a positive thing that's a negative thing because sometimes we need a iron sharpening iron we do we need to be kind of bumped against one another sometime to help us grow up into the stature of the perfect man but god himself was looking to have real communion real fellowship real relationship with those who are of a like a likeness a oneness a like-mindedness of the god kind let's say it that way hoping that we won't cause any confusion of the god kind of the royal seed of abraham this is what god was looking for someone who would he could have real oneness real intimacy real friendship real fellowship with and uh this is one of the ministries of the holy ghost by the spirit of holiness is to shape us mold us into his image into his character so that we can so be one with him have real fellowship with him we cannot accomplish this without the holy ghost i want to say this again we cannot accomplish that kind of friendship that kind of fellowship that kind of relationship that kind of intimacy by simply willing it to be so wanting it to be so hoping it to be so it's only by yielding to the ministry of the holy ghost oh my what god we serve that he desired not to only be the god above us or the god to walk with us in jesus but he wanted to be a god that lived inside of us manifesting who god is in us so that we could have that oneness that adam enjoyed with god for a short season in the garden of eden but one that a bride is going to enjoy with him throughout all eternity did you hear what i'm saying today what adam enjoyed for a short spell you and i as his bride as we allow him to continue to transform us into his image we're going to spend an eternity in fellowship in relationship in oneness and intimacy with him and this is because the holy ghost is in us to transform us from revelation to revelation to revelation and each time we receive a revelation by the holy ghost we move up a little higher and we move up a little higher and we move up a little higher hallelujah so god didn't just leave us here and say hey you get you get to eternity the best way you can no he came into us by the spirit he came into us by the holy ghost baptism so that he could daily you can't get rid of him he's there to see all to know all and to work all he wants to work on every part of us you see our god and creator long to have fellowship with his own created ones as our relationship grows listen as our relationship grows with the father into maturity by the spirit of adoption that's what we were talking about it brings us into a revelation and into a realization of his holiness i'm going to read it again i only wrote that this morning i only added that to my notes this morning and it felt like some honey was dropping down when i wrote it as our relationship grows with the father into maturity by the spirit of adoption it brings us into a revelation and a realization of his holiness the bride of jesus christ must be filled with the awe of god someone recently said it might have been brother hawk or brother greeley i'm not sure who said it recently here but someone was referring to the ah baby brother greeley last sunday the awe and the reverential fear of god the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom i want you to know it's the beginning of prosperity when we enter into the fear of the lord but we have a false idea sometime about the fear of the lord you're not running around like a little hamster in an experiment afraid that at any time the great a scientist or our god is going to take you in his hand and squeeze the life out of you or stand over you with a hammer and he's going to smash you when you drop when you fail when you miss the turn in the maze or you don't run in the wheel let me tell you something that's not the god we serve that's not the relationship we have with him we are not afraid of god because he has the power to snuff out our life at any moment but he does he does have the power he holds our life in his hands but that is not the healthy fear of the lord the reverential fear in all of the lord that's fear like we've known it in life that's fear like we've known it and i'll tell you the enemy is the author of that kind of fear but the fear of the lord is a reverential fear once you have seen the holiness of god revealed and and i don't even know as a believer if i have seen the fullness i i think i probably have not because i know there's so much more in me that needs to be changed but every time i catch a glimpse of the holiness of god so holy so unlike humanity so above the very uh temptation of sin so holy that everything he thinks is holy and everything he does is holy and everything about him cries holy when you see him when you behold his works i mean even in the natural you can stand on a mountain and look out over the uh the grandeur the splendor of god's creation and it can fill you with an awe it can fill you with a reverential fear that says oh my god is an awesome god my god is a holy god a powerful god a glory none like him no other like him i tell you you can just really maybe god has moved in your life you've you've seen a miracle i realize that some people don't feel like they've ever seen a miracle but i'll tell you the greatest miracle that you will ever see in your life is the transformation of of someone gripped by the spirit of death gripped by the power of sin and the power of god reached down and touch them and the spirit of conviction draw them to repentance and god break every fetter and every shackle and every chain and every habit and every bondage of their life and recreate them into a display of his freedom and his glory you can stand back and say brother that's a miracle when you see a hardened drug addict or an alcoholic or a sex addict or someone so in the vice grip of sin and unbelief gloriously saved baptized in the name of jesus filled with the holy ghost and then you say who who is this all things have passed away behold all things have become new you see before your eyes a new creation a new creature and you say who are you i don't even know you i can't even imagine one once uh maybe in your life maybe you have met someone who will testify to you of who they were bc before christ what their life looked like and what their habits were and what they enjoyed and you look at him he said ah i can't see it i can't even imagine it my imagination won't even go there to to cause me to even begin to think of you in that condition you've seen a miracle when that happens you can say thank you jesus you've seen a miracle i'm telling you there's power in jesus there's power in his blood there's power by the holy ghost to transform the hardened sinner the hard cases those who don't even know today they need a savior but the finger of god touches their life and they are awakened to the reality that they're hopeless without him i'm telling you that's a miracle but if you say i've never i've never really seen a miracle i i don't i can't really say that i have so i don't really know what's possible i want you to know everything is possible to him that believeth if you can put your faith and hope and trust in the lord jesus christ he can do above and beyond what you can even imagine in your wildest dream in your wildest imagination he's a supernatural god and that great supernatural god that created the whole world in the whole universe we're just one little part of god's creation here on planet earth he created a whole universe out there there are milky ways after milky ways there are planets that we don't even know exist there there is a handiwork in the eternities in the universe that we don't even get a hold of in our little finite mind we can't we can't really understand how how wonderful how how splendor he's so full of splendor and glory and we have a hard time imagining because we don't know it all and we can't see it all one day we will but i want you to know he is everything that we can get a hold of and so much more if you can catch a glimpse of that it will fill you with such an awe and such a reverence i'll tell you what else it'll fill you with it'll fill you with such a thanks a thanksgiving a thankfulness and a gratitude that a god that big a god that powerful a god that magnificent and majestic would choose you he would choose me and he would care about my uh runny nose he would care about my headache he would care about what's going on in my life you know it it'll baffle you it'll cause you once you catch a glimpse of really how holy he is of his holiness of his glory you just shrink you you do you just shrink you just feel like a little part whoo a little part i want you to know you're an important part but when we see the fullness we we recognize i'm just a tiny part i'm just a small part and it fills us with with a fear of god that is healthy it's a reverential fear it's it's a fear that brings conviction and this is one of the works of the spirit of holiness in our life he comes to reveal to us the holiness of god let me say that again one of the works of the holy ghost in our life is the spirit of holiness and the spirit of holiness comes to reveal to us the holiness of god because holiness is about a relationship praise the lord it's about a relationship our god and creator long to have fellowship with his own created ones as our relationship as our relationship grows with the father into maturity by the spirit of adoption it brings us into a revelation and a realization of his holiness true holiness hear me today true holiness is a result of the holy spirit changing our hearts and our minds until living holy holy living becomes an automatic part of who we are the awe of god the reverential fear of god a glimpse of the holiness of god will begin to dictate to us the way we live our life it'll take the desire to cheat out of us it will it'll take the desire to expose the nakedness of our body out there in the world it'll take that desire right out of you brother sister it'll start working on the habit that's binding you and holding you in its clutches the spirit of holiness will begin to teach you how to walk and how to talk and how to conduct yourself you know i tell you it takes the holy ghost to keep the bride church out of the pools and the fads and the fashions and the trends you know people today including the church are living by what's trending they're more interested in what's trending than they are what god's word has said you don't have to say amen i'm saying it for you amen we are more under the influence of social media influencers than we are under the influence of the spirit of holiness that has filled our lives i'm telling you church i'm telling you bride that ought not to be so we should be more concerned about allowing the spirit of holiness to influence us in the way we worship in the way we work with one another in the way we come together in the way we live our lives when nobody's looking this spirit of holiness by the power of the holy ghost should be the biggest influencer in our life why because the holy ghost will never lead you off the word the spirit of holiness will never take you off the word it will always bring you back to the absolute of god's word are you with me praise god i believe it i'm just going to take a few more minutes here and and then we're going to close we're not going to go on like we would if you all were gathered here but i hope you're hearing something that you can meditate on this week true holiness i'm gonna read it again true holiness is a result of the holy spirit changing our hearts and our minds you know that's intricately linked together our hearts and our minds until holy living or living holy becomes a way of life to us it's not a strain anymore it's not bearing a yoke of legalism anymore come on it's not fear of the church anymore fear of the pastor anymore it's fear of god it's the fear of god's holiness it's the awe and reverence of who he is that makes us want to do things that please him it makes us want to change our ways and our life so that we're doing things that please him and we are stepping away from things that hurt him or displease him or dishonor him brother sister this is relationship this is relationship when you know that your companion doesn't like something and is really uh against a certain thing or or or has a pet peeve that they just can't hardly tolerate it looks to me like that you and i would make the extra effort if it's something we can easily change it looks like we would want to make the extra effort to please the one that we've given our heart to the one we love so much and it's that way in our relationship with him we love him because he first loved us it's hard for us to comprehend his love toward us i'm telling you because many of us struggle with loving ourselves and being able to to to see that god has built us and that we are not junk because we belong to him many of us because of the scars of our past spend more time trying to disqualify ourselves from belonging to him into being his chosen we spend more of our time trying to take ourselves out of the promises of god than we do using our faith to pull ourselves into the promises of god you know if you do that you're going to be in that constant grind and that constant struggle of never being able to please god but i want you to know you can break free of that today if you've received the baptism of the holy ghost you have the spirit of holiness on board he is already present in your life waiting for you to yield more waiting for you to allow him to talk to you to to uh you know he will push us in the right direction nudge us he will put his finger on it and convict us when we start going down a thought process that takes us away from the reality and truth of god's word that little little prick that little check of the holy ghost i've heard people say i've got to check in my spirit about that then you better listen you better listen to that that might be something else you need to be able to go then and say to our lord is this you and recognize his voice because there's a relationship that's being developed in us personal holiness and that's what we were talking about there for just a moment personal holiness the convictions the things that we do differently than the world around us the language that we use you know i i have come to to hear and to understand that the church world today and at large the the full gospel charismatic uh genre of church entity today they they many of of them will say things like you know uh oh the occasional curse word uh the occasional profanity you know that that's just a a part of being god doesn't i want you to know something my bible tells me something else my bible tells us that by the spirit of holiness in us that we should be able to control the words that come out of our mouth we should be able to cast down thoughts and pull down imaginations that are about to cause us to say things that will weaken the testimony that we hold with others it's by the spirit of holiness because the holy ghost can be a restrainer and it's by the spirit of holiness that we are being pulled back sometime from things that that we have made ourselves a part of language that we hear i want to tell you something if you constantly are hearing that kind of language it's going to be very difficult to keep that out of your vocabulary it's going to be much harder if you're all the time watching stuff and and putting yourself around people who talk like that all the time and never speaking up for truth or never saying hey i wish you wouldn't talk that way in front of me i'm not trying to be religious i'm trying to keep my spirit clean before the lord the church has seemed to accept this kind of thing the church seems to accept out there a lot of places social drinking and the occasional marijuana and drug a little bit of you know a little bit of upper or whatever well we all have to do what we have to do folks don't you understand that you've got what you need if you've received the baptism of the holy ghost you've got the helper you've got the convictor you've got the deliverer you've got the one who has come to teach you about the holiness of god and so there are decisions that we make that reflect a personal holiness there are there are things we choose to do and not to do that reflect a personal holiness and this is right but personal holiness develops as an overflow of your relationship and your intimacy with him the closer you draw to him in relationship the more you are willing to lay everything else before him and allow the spirit of holiness to evaluate it and show you i know that even sometimes christians and sometimes believers are are picking up clothing styles that that are are tighter and shorter and and uh sometimes you wonder if someone is on the inside of a dress fighting to get out or on the outside of a dress fighting to get in you see people even in church following these traditions and fads and things that are happening out there wanting to reflect that wanting to be modern wanting to be so forth etc but i want you to know if you will allow the holy spirit to work in your life by the spirit of holiness he starts on the inside he starts putting his finger on what it is that makes you want to present yourself that way now you sometimes hear people especially around the message of truth talk about high-heeled shoes and they say things against that and i want you to know something here did you realize that a person can walk barefooted or a person can walk in flats a woman can walk in flat but have such a seductive spirit on her that she's twisting her body and and advertising herself even though she doesn't have on any kind of a heel on her shoe because it's it's not the shoe now i think that that believers ought to be careful with those kinds of things i i do but i want you to know it's not the shoe it's a spirit that wants to get on somebody to cause them to move in such a seductive way and to attract attention in a seductive way instead of in a christ-like manner oh i know it's getting quiet out there now i know i must be stepping on somebody i know somebody must say oh listen to all that legalism but i want to tell you somebody has got to speak to their people and i'm speaking to mine today i'm so thankful for every visitor that's watching but i'm speaking to my own people there is a spirit of this world that wants to get on us and if we allow the spirit of holiness to work and put his finger on the root of the problem instead of always looking at the outward manifestation but find the inward problem and there's something wrong with somebody who feel there's something wrong with a woman there's something wrong with a man that feels like they have to always put their body on display in public there's something wrong on the inside do you hear what i'm preaching today and so the holy spirit by the spirit of holiness he wants to work on that he wants to help that because once you are able to identify that what god does for you on the inside it begins to manifest on the outside and you do not want to present christ in you that way you want to testify of him in in a way that shines with the glory of god and not with the glitter of this world is there anybody amending me out there uh my phone's getting a little quiet here i need to know that somebody is hearing what i'm saying today you see there is a true change that takes place in our lives our decisions our choices the way we carry ourself etc when there is a genuine change that takes place in our heart if you look up the word holiness that's used here in romans 1 according to the spirit of holiness and i'm nearly done there's four minutes till one now according to the spirit of holiness if you look up that word holiness in the greek it's uh it's strong's greek word 42. it's it's it's one of those uh low numbers it means the process quality and condition of a holy disposition and the quality of holiness in personal conduct that is the definition of the word that is used here in romans 1 as the spirit of holiness the process quality and condition of a holy disposition and the quality of holiness in personal contact you see his holiness resting on our lives is the principle that sets the believer apart from the world it's not our idea of what holiness is that sets us apart from the world around us it is an encounter with his holiness when we encounter his holiness and it transfers from the inside out that is what sets us apart from the world around us i like to use this example and i'm going to close and i thank god for helping me get all the way through page one that was about all the territory we covered but i like to use this example one day in scripture there was a mountain there was a hill there was a prophet and on that mountain there were many bushes i don't know if there were any tall trees or not because of the arid desert environment but there were many many scrub bushes there were many rocks and boulders and maybe even uh what we would call desert grasses various forms of vegetation and there were switchback sheep trails up and down that old dusty hillside where the goats and the sheep would make their way to higher places and eat the vegetation the old scrub bushes and and the grasses that would grow all the vegetation that would grow on that hill so it was very common to see a shepherd walking up one of those switchback trails with a with a pack a herd of sheep or goats looking for some vegetation especially in the dry season when there was no rain and one day god almighty elohim the eternal one decided today i'm going to have an appointment with a man i'm going to come down from my high place and i'm going to speak to a prophet i'm going to commission a shepherd i'm going to take one who has watched over the flocks of his father-in-law and i'm going to send him as a mighty prophet of god to deliver my people out of egyptian slavery how many of you recognize the story now we're talking about moshe we're talking about moses and when god made that appointment that day in his own mind he said i'm going down he chose the way that he would speak to moses you know i don't think you will find that i'm trying to be funny if i tell you that god could have used one of those sheep we have a record in the bible where god spoke out of a donkey so god could have chosen a sheep and spoken his message to moses but he chose rather to come down in a pillar of fire and to land in one of those bushes on that mountain that day and when he did i don't know how god chose which bush perhaps he chose it because of its proximity to where moses was walking with a herd but but but he did he chose a bush and the fire of god the almighty pillar of fire fell that day on an ordinary bush 30 seconds before the fire of god filled up that bush it was just a bush just an ordinary scraggly bush on a hillside in the land of god's people but in the moment that the pillar of fire fell on that old scrubby bush it was no longer just an ordinary bush it was now holy ground not only was the bush made holy because the pillar of fire fell on the bush but the ground around that bush became holy ground because a holy god had come down in his holiness in his power to reveal himself and his plan to moses what was so special about about that bush nothing was it more beautiful than the rest probably not was it healthier than the rest probably not what made that bush so special i tell you it was god's choice on it it was god falling on it in the pillar of fire that made it a special and chosen bush as i said 30 seconds before just a bush but now a chosen vessel that god was going to speak from that bush the fire was going to talk to moses and he said to moses take off your shoes for the ground that you now stand on is holy ground what made the ground holy what made the bush holy god's holiness fell that day on that bush and on that ground it was no longer ordinary bush it was no longer ordinary ground i'm going to ask the musicians to come it was now god's choice his holiness was now making it more than what it had ever been before this is what makes you holy this is what makes me holy now there is a way to walk in holiness there is a way to demonstrate personal holiness but all the good that i can do doesn't make me holy enough did you remember that the prophet of the old testament tells us that all of our righteousness is but filthy rags all tables full of vomit full of defilement so if you and i would live the best life you hear that phrase sometime living my best life i'm not sure i really understand what's being said because your best life is a surrendered life and it may not look like somebody else's best life you've got to discover what god wants to make of you you've got to discover what god wants to do in you and for you and through you and when you do that you have found your best life i want you to know we can live the best of our best do the best of our best make all right choices look right walk right dress right talk right and still not be a real reflection of his holiness because it's not our doing only that matters it's what is being accomplished on the inside it's an encounter with his holiness that makes the difference when he filled you with the holy ghost the holy ghost came to work in your life in all of these ministries in all of these offices and i'm only here to remind you of them because i think sometimes we forget who's really on board he will lead you and guide you into all truth he will so personally teach you and train you what is acceptable in his sight and what is not acceptable in his sight but in order to come to that place you have to lay all of your righteousness before him and say lord here's mine here's what i'm able to accomplish and i know none of it is enough so i'm asking you to come and live inside of me let your holiness be reproduced let your holiness be demonstrated by my life by my choices by my actions by the way i treat others by the way i conduct myself out in in this world let my life be a light shining out through the night the old song that we used to sing i want us to worship i want us to take just a moment to come back together in our hearts of worship and let's sing to the lord for just a moment and then we're going to release you for your sunday afternoon we're just going to take a moment to lift him up and to magnify his name he's worthy aren't you glad the spirit of holiness is in you by the holy ghost aren't you glad you've got a teacher inside of you who desires to help you and to lead you and and to help set your life in order you've just got to yield you've just got to say yes yes i yield yes i surrender to you what are we going to sing praises oh i've heard a thousand stories come on now they think you're like but i've heard a tender whisper of love in the end of night in tell me that you're pleased that i am never alone you're a good good father it's who you are yes it's who you are it's who you are and i'm loved by you it's who i am it's who i am it's who i am oh i've seen many searching for answers foreign [Music] [Music] you yes it's who i am yes it's who i am it's who i am because you are perfect in all of

that you're a good good father we know that you never make a mistake we know lord that you're constantly watching over your children that's how much you love us so lord if we speak out of our frustration if we say things like i don't know why this is happening lord it's just because we get weighted down but we want to say today we trust you we want to say today you're our healer our savior our deliverer our hope our salvation you are wonderful and worthy to be praised would you create in us a clean heart would you restore a right spirit in us how do we know we don't have the right spirit we need the spirit of holiness operating in us by the holy ghost to reveal to us you're operating in a spirit that's contrary to the holy spirit lord would you do that for us would you help us lord we just surrender our will to you today we lift up those who are suffering and sick and under all of the ugly symptoms of this virus lord i want to thank you that you allowed us to come into your house today and that your anointing has flowed out of here i want to thank you that you have strengthened us i want to thank you that you've touched bodies as we have prayed today we thank you for

coming from your hand what you allow you give grace to endure and to overcome cause us to be overcomers rise up in us because you are the overcomer and we'll give you praise and honor and glory deliver our brothers and sisters from this virus comfort the grieving today as only you can in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ let's sing created be a clean heart and we'll go today [Music]

renew a right spirit within me and renew a right spirit within me [Laughter] yes lord grant it today i want to just say to those of you that have sent in prayer requests not related to covid god sees those needs and we're going to continue to lift them up to him and believe god even those that have come in asking that the prayer request be kept confidential you've reached out in faith and i know that faith touches the lord he's our healer he's our helper he's our savior because we are not gathered today as a congregation in person i just want to remind you that you can give you can use the app you can go online to our website you can if you're local here i don't know exactly what our work schedule will be this week but there's almost always someone here nine to five or nine to four and uh monday tuesday and wednesday of this week i know for sure that there will be somebody here between those hours if you'll just send a text to benjamin to hawk to myself we will be happy to meet you at the door and uh receive your tithe and offering and put it in the bank and pay the church bills god is faithful he's never left us without enough our trust is in him but i know that there are those who will not remember if we don't just remind you today that it's just easy to go right on the app to go right on the website or to arrange to come when i got here today there was already people that already just stopped by and dropped off and god bless you for that but it's uh probably a good idea to do it when you know we're here for safety reason but i want to thank you for what was given today and that will go in i'm going to read a total now and that will the offering that was left here this morning for the principle will not be mentioned in this total yet but tuesday night we'll bring it last weekend was the first sunday of the month and brother greeley ministered to us and he received the offering for the principal payment and last week the offering was 5000 i want to thank god for every bit of that you are giving and every month we're chipping away so that we will soon by god's grace our loan renews in august of 2022 and we are praying and believing and hoping that we'll be able to pay off the mortgage of this property and continue to serve the lord and grow and build like he has called us to do and so those who are looking for the total so far since march since the first sunday in march you have given 120 193 dollars and 95 cent and when today is calculated it will put us over the 125 all by the grace of god thank you for taking a burden thanks to brother greeley for hearing the lord and he was speaking to him that if we would make a concentrated effort to put that debt down that he would make a way and he's faithful he's doing that and i'm speaking to our local body thank you so much for helping if you want to send an offering and you're from another body of believers you support your local church first and if god speaks to your heart to be a blessing here then we we will certainly receive that in the name of jesus but we want you to be faithful to your pastor to your church because we know that god will bless you for doing that well thank you for being with us in our service today and the lord willing we'll be back here tuesday night at seven o'clock stream only service but if the lord will come tuesday like he has come today then i can't hardly wait to be in his presence i love every one of you i'm praying for your victory we'll see you the next time god bless you bye-bye create in me [Music] [Music] and renew right spirit within me [Music] [Music] you
