TRANSCRIPT
========================================
take your place and take it now your family is at stake it's never too late for a man of integrity to go before God on behalf of his children God is looking for a great group of Daniels that will lead the families and will lead the church in prayer and intercession I believe that God is looking for a generation of David's who will lead the church and lead the family in worship and demonstrative praise I believe that we too often say I'm not built that way when we need to say I'm not that old man anyhow I'm a new man and life creation life resurrection life is on the inside of me and I have to cry out it's a demonstration of faith and so maybe maybe the delay you have a portion of responsibility in that it doesn't have to be that way anymore take your place and take it now your family is at stake let mother mother let mother be a mother and you be a warrior God saved you for that reason he delivered you for that reason you be a warrior
