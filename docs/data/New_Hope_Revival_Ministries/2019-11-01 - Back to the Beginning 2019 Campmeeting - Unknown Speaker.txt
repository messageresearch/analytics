Lord that you would have your way Lord and we give you praise and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says Amen let's get the Lord a good hand clap of praise tonight hallelujah praise the Lord can you say the devil is a liar amen tell the devil he's a liar amen God is the truth tonight amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll turn over to first John chapter 2 God has done done a lot of things forced to be able to be here tonight Steve kind of lets you aware of some of the things that's going on or sister Rebecca my wife her grandmother is is close to passing on and then we're looking forward to for her cross over she's a elderly lady in their 80s and she deserves to be going on over and but the Lord has just held it off for a few days I believe for us to be able to be here with you I didn't want to come out without my wife and I think God that he's he's blended all out we didn't know what to do and I just told her I said well I'm gonna pray in the morning and and and I'm gonna I believe the Lord is going to give us an answer so I picked up my Bible and prayed that morning and and I read over in the Old Testament read in Psalms and read in the New Testament and everything I read was life and everything I read was go and I thought all right yes that's enough for me to tell her to go with me he meant so I and it looks like that's what perfect what God has done for us so we're and and then you praying from our mother I appreciate you doing that she's come a long ways in the last four days that God has done great things for her it's just a complete turnaround and where she was having needing help through the night getting up and and and and sitting down and just in screaming and agony of pain trying to get out of the seat but God has turned that around that she can do it by herself now amen and the Lord has just done amazing work in the last three or four days and and it relieved me to be able to come so I you know I don't know what's going on in your life for these meetings is what no what the devil's trying to do but you know the devil wouldn't try to do something we Feeny thought something wasn't good gonna happen amen but we're here to block the eye of the devil tonight amen and we're expecting first John chapter two like to start at verse 24 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also shall continue in the Son and in the father and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you but denying what you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have what confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if we know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him a man I hope that stirs your heart here tonight we're just gonna believe this is where the Lord allow us to be father we come to you again Lord after the reading of your word now inspire our hearts to take this Lord and pray God that you would anoint and magnify - ass Lord and express to the earth Lord here tonight your faults Levis have tonight the mind that was in Christ Lord that our being us Lord and now pray God to childress stores everything Lord that the devil has tried to take away nor that we would Lord believe here tonight with all confidence Lord Jesus that were ready for a rapture that we're ready Lord at anytime to speak the word and it shall come to pass father troubles all around Lord different things has taking place all hell is against us but there's no weapon formed against us shop prosper Lord Father we believe Lord that you have cursed the devil father and we know that Lord we are Lord on the side of the righteous Lord you've blessed us Lord and we pray God that you just continued Lord to help us to grow in the manifestations of the sons of God giving you glory and praised here tonight in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you can be seated amen looking at that then the scripture there let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from where the beginning a man I believe that we can be identified with those scriptures here tonight because we have a message that has took us back to the beginning amen is not took us to traditions of man it's not took us back to Creed's to things that has has no meaning but we have a prophet a seer born the prophet a seer that has took us back amen it can go forward into the future and they can go back amen as far as God would allow him to go back is that right Amos 3:7 says I'll do nothing except I reveal it through my servants the prophets amen and that means nothing amen and so we got something here tonight because God has told us is that right amen and he says let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning and he says if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also shall continue in the Son and in the father and and so we want to think about I've been in a series of preaching they're at their place they're in Tennessee and it's just been a burning in our heart amen and so we're looking 'men some messages on marriage and different things for the young people and you know just looking at the what the prophet of God says teach your children to teach their children to teach their children and so is looking at those things and then God just reveals something to us and then it began to sit like that roman candle began to just explode and explode and explode and you know the prophet of god seen things that he says the bible became a you book to him a man I believe when we see a revelation brothers sisters it stirs our heart Amen it stirs our soul it's stimulation of the revelation and it just you know the scriptures dovetails with each other but you know when we see something we can take it back to the beginning and it should flow all the way through and I love it when it happens amen it just stirs our heart amen and it stirs a revival back down in her soul and so I was looking at that and and we was thinking about if we could just take our minds back in the Garden of Eden and we could think about Amen that first man Adam my we could just we could just talk all night about Adam and and think about where we're at where he was that in that Garden of Eden and if we could just think about where he started off that he didn't start off as a little baby a man he started off amen like a tree a man a grown tree his feet was planted into the garden and into the dirt and there and you know he stood there as a as a grown mature son of God is that right in the image of God and we think about how he was standing there and and God spoke life into him is that right and it became a living soul and we could just think about Adam oh my amen to all the great things that was taking place amen in the garden of this first man Adam was a man when he became he never was a baby he was created is that right he didn't even have a birth he didn't have a navel amen and so we think about he was spoken there he was he came as a spoken word is that right amen he was made in the likeness of God amen and we think about there was no nature of sin in him totally different from us there was no nature of sin in him amen no genes was passed to him as far as says it's the genes of sin that was passed down to him there was no knowledge of evil in him is that right Amen there was no knowledge of evil there was no memory handed to Tim that was of a bad memory all brothers and sisters could you think about if we could have right here tonight no memory that was handed to us Amen of our grandfathers what wrong that they done Oh a sin that they've done the property God says my grandfather's died with her boot song amen to through the sin and ancestors that was handed down to us and would Jean it down to this you know maybe alcoholic or or drugs or different things and and so there was none of that knowledge of evil no memory handed down to him amen we just think about he never cried for Annie as a baby would have to cry because it needs something it never hurt for pain as a child would from a boo-boo no thoughts of evil Ament Adam had no thoughts of evil praising oh I could trade with him right now what you a man I'm talking about in the beginning let's go back to the beginning in that garden Eden where Adam was he had no memory of sin no nature in him no thoughts running through his mind every second of where did that thought come from where did that come I don't like that fault amen and here comes a good fall amen just battling between the good and the negative thoughts he had positive thinking the whole time he was there it meant you know church if we don't go back and think of what it was in the beginning a man we can have an just no realization of what it's really gonna be when we get over there but if we can go back to the beginning and think why Adam was how good it was it's gonna want us to get out of here very quick and get to the state that God wants us to be in is that right amen hallelujah he had no thoughts of evil he hadn't regrets Oh church we so we're loaded here with regrets hey I wish I hadn't done it wish I hadn't said that today or yesterday I wished I hadn't done that made the wrong choice but he not had one regret of what he'd done his record was totally clean totally clean everything he thought was good amen you know thoughts of evil no regrets he was only can you say tonight only he was only positive could you imagine living in a body that's totally positive the whole time would you like to have a husband that was positive the whole time sisters Rose wouldn't you like to have a wife so positive the whole time children that's positive the whole time pastor wouldn't you like to have a church it was positive the whole time where would we be what kind of people would we be if we never thought of negative and was positive every second we would be explosive we would get things done the devil wouldn't have no word to get in between is that right the prophet of God said we could gird ourselves about with truth that there ain't no devil in hell can find where we're at praise the Lord I believe Adam was in that place amen he and he was only positive he was no hurry raised the Lord he was in no hurry there was no thoughts of time he was enjoying the moment Oh church we could just be here tonight and enjoy and say I'm here to hear the word however long you want to preach cuz I just love it rah hey hey man I got nowhere to be I just wanted to be swear ever the word is coming forth samurai amen he had no hurry no thoughts of time he was enjoying the moment the pulsating emotions was around him Amen of being happy the whole time never sad never negative never never just any other but positive I mean it was relaxing the whole time hmm he was enjoying the moments it was peaceful it was beautiful there was expectation all the time it was supernatural there was nothing but love everywhere praise the Lord love unity everything in one Accord the animals were in love the trees were in love everything around him was love raised the Lord Amen you know you can go into the cities and it's totally different but you get way up in the woods and into the country there ain't many and you just feel the peace that's in there that's because man's got to do with the cities but man ain't got nothing to do back in the mountains there were suta phul yeah right and it was love a man why was it was because Adam was a son to God is that right Adam knew who his father was Adam knew who he was Adam talked to God and God talked to Adam every day and Adam knew his position is that right amen and his position was to dress and keep the garden and he was fine with that right and Adam gave authority to the garden because God says this is your earth and he had authority over everything that was taking place he had authority with love he can speak to the wind with love not in a hurry not this not in an anxiety not were scared a man in authority with love praise the Lord Amen you know and it's so he could speak to the trees and we can say hey man he could do that he could speak to the animals a man he could speak to the wind a man and the God liked Adam giving control God like him taking his position and doing what he was called to do hey man he was having dominion and God and Adam was in accord one Accord in lightness oneness agree oh I mean I would just like to know that God was pleased with me every step that I took every choice that I made it was happy about it Amen every time I make a decision he say yes that's exactly right that's exactly what I thought when Adam named those animals that's gonna be aligned God says yes that's exactly what I thought that's gonna be a monkey yes that's exactly what row just riding the cord with God wouldn't you like to have one week like that that God is happy with everything you do hey man praise the Lord and you not have one work not one thought that God was displeased with what you done you know and so we look at that that's what it was in the beginning that's what it was in the beginning praise the Lord Amen I'd like for you to turn over to Matthew chapter 19 with me just a moment we're going up to Jesus's day here verse 1 and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings he departed from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan and great multitudes followed him in heel he healed them there the Pharisees also came unto Him tempting him and saying unto them is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said to them have you not read that he which made them at work made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder and they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away and he said to them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so let those things that you have heard from the beginning remain in you you see I'm taking you back to the beginning and see where everything was in its rightful position is that right amen and then we see all that that took place in the gardening it took Adam and Eve from the rightful position I can imagine as they was leaving that garden Amen hallelujah they had never seen a lamb slain before they had never seen a life died in front of them but when God took that first lamb and took a rock and cut that glams throat and they was saying death for the first time I'm sure it was a different thought than they've ever had it was all love it was all peace it was all just grace and mercy amen and just wonderful but here they seen a lamb dying he meant because they know the feeling messed up we've done wrong they got that feeling for the first time is that right amen and now they're having to see life leave a man their blood everywhere they've never seen blood because there was no you know nothing taking place like that but now something has happened and the prophet of God says and I can see Adam and Eve leaving the garden now amen with the lens of such skin slapping them on the back in the road and running down and Adam and growth there's a wife going out of the garden Oh what have we done how we've messed up Oh God amen they're having to leave that garden God is now amen driving them out of that place is that right amen and he has to put a flaming sword there to keep them from going back to that tree of life is that right because now they've tasted the tree of good and evil now they know what was good and now they know what is evil and now they're in between good and evil and that's where we're at today we're stuck between that good and evil and we're we're pulling our mind and we're saying oh god I can't stand this I can't handle this I need something that'll bring me back to that original creation back to that original word back to the original place with God a me that I could get partly away from this negative thing I could get turn away from anything that would be displeasing the gone hey man we're crying aim it for another step to take us back to that place is that right Adam and Eve always wanted to get back in there hey man praise the Lord and now we say Jesus is in in his day is that right you know I don't know I didn't know what the Lord was wanting me to preach here tonight well that's alright we're just gonna go step by step you know if you would read the janata G of Adam he doesn't keep up with Cain is their high because he wasn't interested in the Cain seat because that was that was the other seat that got planting inside there is that right but he keeps up with the sons of God is that right and we know that Adam lived 930 years and so Adam lived 930 years he gets to see a lot of generations coming for I mean he gets a seat Seth come from Comfort come and then he gets to see in us and then Canaan and then mahalia and Jared and Enoch and Methuselah and layman eight generations that he gets to see come to pass and I was thinking about this other day and and it says there when I got down to Enoch because they've got a revelation of who Enoch was and I got I see in the scriptures what he not got to do is that right and I think about all these children of this man of Adam and I thought did they know who their grandpa was was they interested in who he was did they read enough of the testimonies or whatever they had in that day to go back and and be interested in their daddy but I get up to Enoch and I look at his life and I think well here is Enoch and in and as I figured I'm not too good of a mathematic but did what I looked at in the Bible there I figured out Adam is 602 years old when Enoch is born I'm gonna tell you I may be a little wrong in this but as I configure he was six hundred two years old when Enoch is born Enoch is 65 years old when he has a son Methuselah and Adam is now six hundred sixty-seven years old amen and Methuselah is the seventh generation Adam is getting to see so Adam is 854 years old and gets to see eight generations and he dies when he's 930 years old and so I'm thinking about here's this Enoch coming along and Enoch is walking with God and I think about that and I thought you know it's amazing how you know if there's a seed in there it's it's it's a calling out there's a deep calling to the deep is there I mean I'm thinking that Enoch here he's a great great great great grandson and he can walk down here - great great great great great great Grandpa's house a man is set down in grandpa's living room and say what was it like in the beginning Amon as I can understand you was the first man on the earth what was it like in that place in the garden Eden where there was nothing negative everything was positive everything was beautiful everything was perfect and Adam could sit there and tell him what it was in the beginning and everything that Enoch would say I mean Adam will tell Enoch it was remaining in him he could not forget all the little other little grandsons and the boys he men were over there playing with her toys or something but something about that was in Enoch he was interested in what happened in the beginning I hope we're sitting here here tonight we're interested what happened in the beginning because it has not left my mind because I'm going to get back to what it was like that praise the Lord I'm interested there's something says amen I want to know I want to taste I want to get back to where that was bracelet or a Men hallelujah and so Enoch here's all the Adams talking about all of this how it was in the garden Enochs heart is stirred by hearing the richness of hearing the original man in the beginning he wants to hear more about the beginning more of that original more of that spoken word more about the thought authority he had more of that oneness he had with his wife in the beginning more of that oneness he had with God that everyday fellowship that he had and he was a Adam can you tell me some more is there something else you can tell me about him I can't you remember anything else he not hears that Adam passes on one morning and Enoch goes down there at the borough mourning over Adams is gone he knocked his sister by all that he has heard what was in the garden of that fellowship and Enoch a man was we understanding he takes what he hears the message that he's wrote down a man he takes it home with him and he begins to build something church we're building stone upon stone revelation of on revelation Enoch built that pyramid which was God's Amen second Bible as we understand by the message of the hour and that pyramid was stone upon stone I believe Enoch was getting revelation upon revelation and he didn't just leave it at church brother he was so interested he was so Amen that's elevated in what Adam was talking to him about a man he brought it home and he began to put one upon the other and one upon the other Amen before you know it he was building a masterpiece that God was saved that's my Bible that's my word is that right amen he would take it and place it Amen one stone upon a stone and the Bible says he walked with God II know whoa with God every day he walked with God he took what we he was hearing from the beginning and he began to desire in his life that fellowship is that right amen and he said the Bible says he walk with God every day he waited like Adam did till God came and they took a walk together is that right one day men as he got that a pyramid built up to so high Amen in any slant thinking that home Oh Lord amen I'm just about finished with this thing I mean I just about got it completed a man in God says he said but God I need your help today I don't know what else to do here and then God says that's alright I'm coming I'm coming and he says it's time for the capstone it's time for this cap off I'm at the top Lord what are you going to do for me God can I just have another revelation God says you're gonna get or give revelation today I mean God comes down Amen in the Adam talks walks out these door and he kisses his wife and his children amen how little it begins the walk God comes down that day a meaning he begins to walk was God aiming down to that pyramid and all of a sudden the capstone came down and took him home oh praise the Lord it was why he knock was here from the beginning that took him it with a walk with God that took him out of here I'm thinking if that power of that word Amen if we can hear from the beginning could we be like a Enoch that it'll take us and we'll walk a life they eat not lived Amy we'll walk with God will build stone upon stone revelation upon revelation Amen in one day we'll be not because God took us howl if it's a car wreck or whatever it is God took us hey man raise the Lord it stirs my heart him man he's Lord let's go years.they later down the road and here comes a second Adam here comes a second Adam and he didn't come like the first Adam he come at a baby why huh come as a baby praise the Lord this is God's choice this is God's character this is how God chose to come in the second Adam was that right hey man and how did he choose when he's gonna be born he didn't choose a hospital he didn't choose a beautiful place he chose a manure pile he chose a stable is that right I mean he didn't choose all the beauty this is his character I'm coming this way and when it comes he comes forth as a baby in the manger and the Bible says and he had no word to lay his head is that right amen and we see that here he is Amen in he's uh he had a bar he had a bar a womb to come in he had a bar e as stable is that right amen and then we see here that is found at 12 years old he's in the temple talking to teachers hey man is that right talking to grown men that knows the Bible from the beginning to the end and here he is 12 years old and he's telling them things that's blowing their mind because this man has been getting in the beginning this man just didn't show up because he was born in Nazareth or born in in a place in a stable this man had walked in the beginning he knew who that first Adam was God could talk us and take those men back to the beginning and there are less women they've never heard these things how does this young boy at 12 years old know these things oh ma raise the Lord and the Bible says here he goes and he goes out through Galilee he's teaching in their synagogues he's preaching the gospel of the kingdom and here he goes forth and he's healing all manner of sickness and all manner diseases among the people was their high amen and his fame went throughout all Syria Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those that were lunatic and those that had the policy and it says and He healed them all praise the Lord here's the second Adam a man and was his desire what is his character to bring man and restore him back to their health bring them back to their healthy bodies that that was lost from there's that right a man they lost their health they lost their eyesight they lost their their to a healthy body to be able to walk and hear Christ that second Adam is coming in and he's restoring them back into their healthy bodies he's restored them back to the right mind and their memory of what he had here he comes upon a blind man and the disciple says well law has made this man blind was that his mother or his father he said nothing made his mind none of that Amy but for the glory of today that I have come to heal his body it was born for our purpose being blind so that man Jesus could come by and heal him today I want to tell you I was like in the same shoes I was born lost I was born with the nature of sin I was lying I was stealing so that man Jesus Christ sing some glory to me and bring me back to my right mind I was totally out of my mind I didn't know who I was I had spiritual amnesia I lost my identity nobody ever told me I was a son of God listen Jesus didn't come not knowing who he was he knew who he was you know that was making fun of him in school huh his birth was made fun of when he was in school and all the kids are saying well my daddy's a plumber my daddy's a mayor my daddy's this my daddy's a cop my daddy's a theologian they looked over to Jesus and says who's your daddy and he said God he was telling the truth is there he created all these mountains he created all these trees all this earth that you're living on he created it oh I couldn't believe that but he was telling the truth is that high he was telling the truth he meant holiday I think about it you know I was at a gas station J other day and and I was pumping gas my wife leaned over and she said did you see his sign I said no so I leaned over and I looked at his sign and there's a young boy and he's Hawking on the road and he had his backpack and all of his gear there on the sidewalk there and just in his little corner there and he had a sign says I love weed and I was like Lord give me something to say give me something to say you know people needs to be talked to what good is a Christian go by and just look at him we need to say something we need to pray God give us something say there are so I walked in a gas station pay for my gas I went in the bathroom it's coming back now come around him I says you know I used to like that stuff too forgive me they said what happened I said I met Jesus he said ah he said there's a guy a couple hours tried to give me all of that stuff and he said I wasn't interested I said I wasn't interested in either I said I was interested in that stuff that you're liking I said and see and I don't blame you because you you're not interested in Jesus but I says that's what happened I wasn't interested in it I was interesting he said but I met Jesus I said so you can't help not being interested but if you ever meet Jesus you might get interested praise the Lord how many's interested in Jesus I'm interested amen he can go right by many people amen and not a lot of people's not interested but we're here tonight because we're interested I've met Jesus and I don't care for those things anymore Amen but I'm interested in the Lord tonight I'm reiterating in hearing for something that's tells me from the beginning I mean I'll tell you we got something in this hour that'll take us to the beginning it'll take us all the way to the very high low life that was in the beginning hallelujah here is becomes before a Centurion and the Centurions gotta I believe is a child and he says Lord I'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but Speak the word only in my service shall be healed so it's a servant see for I'm a man under Authority soldiers on me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to some dry servant do this and he do with it and when Jesus heard that he marveled and said to them that followed very us and hew I have not found so great faith no not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping gnashing of teeth and Jesus said unto the Centurion look the power look to the authority go thy way and as thou has to believe so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same our praise Lord this is that second Adam the first Adam forfeit the book he forfeit the rights is that right he forfeit Amen that book of life and he lost that to eat of the tree of good of good and evil there right amen but here comes the second Adam amen and he's eating the tree of life amen and he's speaking two things and it's coming to pass oh is that right a man and when Jesus comes into Peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her at that moment and she arrives and ministered unto him when the evening was come they brought in too many that were possessed with Devils cast out the spirits with his word and he healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying he himself took our infirmities and by our sickness Jesus has not only restoring health back to certain ones that would believe but he is restoring the promises of God back to the true believers God is a restorer that I come to restore us back to the Tree of Life Adam had a walkout there was a sword to God to guard them from that tree life but this adam says get back to it praise the Lord he meant he says there used to be a time that people could go behind the veil where the Shekinah glory is it was death is that right but he says but now it's a time that if you don't go back there it's dead it's spiritual death now God is saying I want you back eating that tree of life is that right praise the Lord Churchill is the second Adam he's the Tree of Life is that right he was in the garden and they couldn't touch him no more they couldn't go in there and touchy but now here's the tree of life walking around and he said touch me they have the ability to touch him they have the ability to top Platoon they had the ability to love him and they're calling him a belzebub a meaning they're calling this and that but they don't realize he's the tree of life oh they just realize he's the tree of life they can have that peace with God again they can be restored back to like Adam was but they didn't have the revelation like Enoch handy is that right a man hope this is okay and so here he comes up to some of these Pharisees and Sadducees and they come up to him now watch Jesus and they says Moses give us a law that we could do this there that we could put them on I don't put our wives away for any cost and Jesus says it was because of the hardness of your heart he had to put up with two million people by himself right full of complaints full of negativity full of all kinds of murmuring amen hallelujah and he just couldn't handle and God allowed him to do that but watch Jesus does he let him keep going in Moses's word and what Moses let him do he says it wasn't so from the beginning he's gone taking this back to what was in the beginning he's taking us back to what a true marriage was in the beginning is that right amen let's turn over to Genesis for just a second I'm not getting in the marriage of divorce I'm just getting you into amen the the of the truth in the beginning Genesis 5 let's look at this know Genesis 2 verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon who and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man she came were from him she was in him and Adam said listen who said it Adam this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman this is Adam talking because she was taken out of man right now verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife that shall be one flesh this is not Adam talking Adam new wall had taken place and he says this is now bone of my bones flesh in my flesh but when he gets to verse 24 who's writing the book of Genesis Moses under the inspiration of the holy ghosts and when it gets the first 24 and it says Moses is riding here therefore shall a man leave his father and his wife Adam didn't have a mother he didn't have to leave his mama's house he didn't have a mommy that give him birth that right this was God's Way of marriage in the beginning is that right for us knowing ahead what was going to do knowing ahead of what future marriage was so God's putting something in there what a man should do when he marries a woman and he says therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave unto who his wife his wife and they shall be what one flesh and they were in the new system but they're both naked man and his wife were not ashamed but so he says but they were one flesh this is what Jesus said was not so in the beginning this is what Jesus is referring to this is the original word this is the original marriage that this is his wife Adams wife and they were one together she came out of him he's trying to restore them back to what a real marriage was that you don't just put away your wives they're part of you I'm glad God won't put away his wife they mean that he's part of us Adam walked into there and saved his wife with his eyes wide open because he loved her and it was type of God coming the second Adam coming to save his wife there I look what God's doing he's not letting them go on into ignorance and going on in their own mess that they've made to just keep doing this what does the second Adam what's his intention his intention is taking them back to the word back to the original you marry a wife amen she's yours is the vial to keep her is that right amen you're one flesh she's his helpmate is that high amen he's brain him back to the rest' rest restoring them back to the word not only just doctrine but health and word and marriage and this and that he's restored them all back to the original God don't want us walking in ignorance he wants us back to the word they man that's the reason we needed a prophet in this end time hallelujah amen let's turn over to Matthew 7 Jesus wasn't interested in their money Jesus wasn't just interested in their friendship Jesus wasn't interested in their churches he was interested in getting man back to the original word is that why Jesus didn't come to build a home and as far as in that house he didn't come to get married there he didn't come just to have her friendship God at the end of the Jesus's Road he says are you willing to give up your friends are you willing to die for this earth are you ready to do this Jesus was at 30 years old don't you think he was enjoying life don't you think he was enjoying a man walking around on his creation with his friends sure he was that's reason he asked God let this cup pass from me but he had to remember what was I God had me to come here for her what is my purpose church were not just here to get rich and just have fancy houses and nice cars we're here for a purpose to get a revelation of why we're here where we come from what we're hearing where we're going and we got to get that restored back to and we can't get a restored back to us unless we're hearing something that'll take us back to the beginning we don't need some of the reformists back into its tradition take us out one thing and put us back into a tradition take us out of this church and put us in another church I mean just walking with no intentions we need something that'll give us not just a partial revelation but a total revelation that restores back and say now I know now I know why I'm here for to do what God has asked me to do just hoping you're understanding we're talking about restored back to the beginning Matthew 7 Jesus gives us a word here I'm yeah Matthew 7:7 he says I ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened ma that's powerful what man in his right mind would not want that - whatever he says it comes to him that right not because he's got money but just because he asked with his mouth what he speaks amen it comes to him is that right well he asks he receives well he seeks he finds and what he knocks a man it shall be open said or what man is there of you whom his son ask bread with him giving him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do even so to them for this is the law of the prophets amen so he's given them word to restore him back to like what Adam did to speak that word is that right to like maybe like Joshua had when he was needing more time to win this battle and then Joshua taps into something any men into some kind of power in some kind of desperation of a need to do something and all sudden he tells the Sun to stand still and it stops it totally stops and everybody's totally amazed here's a man that speaks the word and the Sun stand still oh that was a power of a word that Adam had in the beginning and now we finally get a man that's on the earth that can do it again but he's tapping in and he's tapping out tapping in and tapping out and we're tapping in and tapping out we're in and we're how here's Moses one time God told him to go down to that rock when they was thirsty and he said smite the rock with that rod and Moses takes the rod and he smites the rock and he gives forth water of abundance not something little hole that he could put your thumb on but this was a hole that created rivers by a smoke by being obedient what to God said by taking the rod and smote in it he's right but see God does this twice the next time God tells Moses go down and speak to the rock you know we need to listen to what God's trying to tell us sometimes God is telling us a man was something different not that his word changes but he's trying to help us to make the next step is that right amen this message has got some steps in it the church ages was seven steps Amen but when that church age last church age come amen in that pyramid we think about it in that seventh church age in the pyramid he's sitting with that seventh age was next to the prophet's chamber which had a step that nobody can make that step by himself Oh church we couldn't get out of these messes by ourself but the prophets chamber was there beside us too so that we could get help to get out of that traditional mass get out of those messed-up Lucien's and make that step out of those Church ages into a bride age we couldn't do that without a prophet church is that right so we see here lord help us that doesn't lost my father here we see Jesus is that second Adam and he's trying to restore us back so he tells Moses here we are Moses go down and speak to that rock is that right speak to the rock this time I wore Moses heard it right but listen he had a lot of frustration going on at that time he lotta had a lot of anxiety a lot of problems occurring at that time was that right I mean you know church we're standing in the same our frustrations everywhere problems here and there and coming amen just everywhere her trying to get us upset trying to get our mind off of what God's telling us but I tell you all the troubles come along we need to find ourselves more Church than we ever have we need to be playing to taste more than we ever had we need to be praying more than we ever had I don't care how much trouble see Davis says when trouble comes pray that's the weapon to pray is how high a man David always says he's my rock he's my fortress he's my street giver when troubles all around me so God tells Moses go down and speak to that wrong and all this trouble is laying on Moses his shoulders all this that he's hearing that the people's doing and he goes down to that rock and he takes out that rod and he smokes it and smokes it Oh church sometimes we going to church and listen to the message just frustrating weapon the weapon and God said I didn't tell you they get frustrated I didn't get tell you to get all excited and get out of whack I just told you to speak to your problem speak to the rock that's all you had to do Moses let's just speak the word let that come forth water God is telling us in this age with this message it's spoken word time it's back to the original see time I haven't left you up here in all this mess I've put you back to the beginning it's time to speak not smite each other and hit each other and get frustrated Sarah and see Moses broke the word broke the type when he smoked twiced he's supposed to speak to it list and it would have give what it did give water but he broke the time what did happen it calls Moses not be able to go into the Promised Land Oh Church don't get so uneasy don't get so bent out of shape that you're not listening to the message that you're not listening to the voice of God he's trying to make it easier on us is that right hey man it's not time to get more jobs and more things that's keeping our minds away from the word it's time to rest in the word it's time to find the focus in the word hear God's voice more and more than we ever had it son third Exodus coming it's time to leave is that right you know I was I did a river raft up there in West Virginia one time and and was coming up on a real bad rapid that the guy said he says now listen he said we're coming up on a rapid here and he says as a rock right in the middle of this river and he said with the force of the all this water that's going into that rocky if you get fall out of the boat he said you're gonna get right with the water and you're gonna go right into this rock and the rock was just a humongous rock and I think they called the Falls shipwreck or something like that and he said when we get around there he says there's gonna be people all over the sides of the bank and he said they're gonna be hollering at you to try to get you to get you away from my voice and they're trying to get you to mess up and turn over the boat buddy when he told me that I put my foot in every crack that I could I almost thought I'm not even going to paddle this one I'm just gonna hold on Freddie's alone I didn't want to get out of the boat I wanted to stay in the boat raise the Lord amen I want he says but you listen to my voice I'm responsible for you they are not you listen to me Oh Church this message is our voice Moses's voice was the voice to the people is that right amen hallelujah we come around now brother amen we was listening to his voice when he said right we went right we didn't go left we didn't say all he don't know what he's talking to Wow and went left no we did exactly what he said praise the Lord and they took pictures and then we at the end of it we say our pictures and we're eyes is really big we're scared to death we're not smiling this I want to tell you it's a troublesome time Church we don't know what's hitting us it's looks like a dangerous place where my could die any moment but I want to tell you I'm listening to his voice if he says follow if he says go to church I'm going to church if he says pray I'm gonna pray I'm gonna do everything he says to do that's the only way we're gonna get out of here all right there's other forces that screaming out do this and do that but they ain't responsible for you they're not your God was everybody even the prophet got to a place a man in the mountain one time he don't thought he didn't need a God praise the Lord but he found out pretty quick he needed a guide is that right hey man you know if we could just if Moses just would have listened to the voice he made it easier on him God don't want us just having to be fretting we got the power to speak the word now he said ask and ye shall receive knock it shall be open seek ye shall find who's he talking to us Church us I mean and I'm seeing our prayers I'm seeing results out of this more than I ever have in my life I'm praying Pryor's amen and I'm seeing results Amen I had car trouble other day ain't know what the wiring was messed up on it and I went out there and I spent all day on it and and so when I got done it was worse then I started I'll tell you and when I at the end of the day I like this this is really going to cost me take care of that guy to come in here not knowing where he's gonna start and fix this thing yeah you can take him days to figure out where all these wires are going as well but the next morning I was preaching in restoration restoring this back to that spoken word faith strike my heart this morning before I went out the door I grabbed my Bible and I prayed read some scriptures and in my prior said Lord I'm going out that door and I'm speaking to that car and I'm asking you God showed me where the problem is that give me the revelation to fix my car whenever I got up and as I was going out the door God says start where he left off praise the Lord God still speaks I went out there amen and I went to this little wire that was messed up and it wasn't hooked up like the other side and I had it hooked up like the other side and everything looked like you should have been hooked up but I hooked it up I unhooked it Rebekah's out there and I said start the car and it started right up I'd like this don't make sense the other side's hooked up but there was only a little black box that was in between it that somebody had lost and so I'll hooked it up like the other side bubbles bypassing the black box I hooked it back up the fuse block unhooked it started I started shouting now let me come around corners what's the matter daddy what's the matter I said praise God God spoke to me hey told me the answer I don't need a mechanic or own it a seek you shall find you shall be given it's time to get back to sons and daughters to God we had a Adams second Adam to come back and say I'm taking you back to the beginning when you shall speak not me just but you shall speak right praise the Lord amen I'm gonna go to this for just a moment you know let's go to a scripture here in the Bible here if I can find it this word well let me just read it because it might take me a minute to fund it you remember Jesus was walking one time they was on a journey and they was going to a certain place and Jesus looks down there down the road and he sees a certain tree had leaves on it he said and he was hungry he says perhaps when I get there I'll get some fruit off of it so he gets down there and there's no fruit this is the second Adam and he sees no fruit on the tree and he speaks for it and he says no man shall eat from this tree hereafter speaks it turn from it and they go on their journey and let that stop was probably said look at him he's talking to trees they go down here they go to the temple and do a few things spend a night and get up in the next morning they're coming back up and they get to the tree and Peter's Locke he said Jesus look at this tree it's withered up to the roots where you spoke yesterday right well let me take your mom back there was another tree one time the Satan tried to do the same thing and joy says there was a tree and says Satan come to that tree with these four little rum bugs and he says he began to eat on that tree he began to destroy the leaves take the fellowship from the tree take the fellowship from the church brothers and sisters you gotta have fellowship and the devil first thing he wants to do is make you mad and destroy your fellowship with one another but you'll die you've got to have that fellowship fellowship with the word fellowship with prior fellowship with church fellowship with one another and he went from the leaves to the park and all the way down trying to kill that tree he was trying to curse the tree is that right Amen I want to tell the devil he can trying he can try and all he wants to praise the Lord I mean he tried to do that to job one day he was one to cause Jo to curse God so he could die but God says you can't do it Satan you can't curse this tree devil says let me try he said you can try it and so Satan comes down and he destroys his barns he destroys amen everything of jobs got there amen a couple days he's got all of it destroyed in the fire a meaning even takes his children right and he comes before God and says he says I've done all this he says see he's a just man he said well let me have his flesh right Amen he said okay you can have it too but what he saying but don't you touch his life Satan and put balls all over his body from the head to his feet balls all over him all right he's itching he's got him all over he's got him places can't even get to maybe he's one day setting out there and he thought well aim in my wife's face to come outside with a glass of water maybe she'll get that one a niche that one for me she comes outside and looks at jokes she's like you look like a mess why don't you just curse God and die Satan he even got to his wife he said you speak like a foolish woman can you get this born into that one for me Joe wouldn't curse God and die he meant Satan was all over his flesh all over his property destroying everything Amy but God says I told you he's a just man he's a perfect man Satan tried to curse that tree but word is the life it's in the room Satan couldn't get to the root he couldn't get to the seed because the predestinated life fleas laying in there the prophet of God says I was always with God I was in his thoughts if I believe it with God eternal life then I always had eternal life st. trying to curse that life in tow but he could not touch that life but look at Jesus back up to Jesus when he cursed that tree his words went right out of his mouth into that tree straight to the root and killed the life of the tree showing you what Satan can't do and what Jesus could do as a son of God is that right Satan tried to curse Israel one time is that right he tried he got him a false prophet to go down there and look on all the mistakes of Israel look at this look what they're doing look at this putting on though all their failures and got a prophet down there to try to curse Israel and when that Prophet goes down there to curse not a little bit of changes his words he can't curse what God is blessed I don't care what they've done wrong I don't care what they're doing that's not right they could not curse what God is blessed Satan love be able to curse you and I they can might put this on you and put that on you but he can't get to the seed he can't get to the root where God is hey man God says I'll heal you of all manner diseases that means we will get some of these diseases but God shall deliver us some out of them that don't mean that we ain't gonna get them that means we're gonna get some of these but God's gonna heal us of all these things praise the Lord job had to get loosen everything but look what happened God restored job back of everything he lost and give him more is that right look at the children of Israel right after this after Moses mites the rock they're coming down to a place that they either see a hard way or see a easy way and so they went to those people and ate them whatever in the name of that place was and they said can we have permission to go this way instead of that way we won't touch your land we won't mess with your whales we won't we'll do this and they come out and says you're not gonna touch nothing you're not going through our land wouldn't give them permission that right come to another place the Moabites war ever got to the place and they asked can we go through your land and they said no you can't go through our land come out with battle and Israel with them what did they have to do they had to go across the hard way the rough side of the mountain praise the Lord sometimes we think we're gonna get through things real easy but it's not that way God don't want to scare the easy way it has to be the hard way sometimes God wanted to show them people down there that mighty army going around that big mountain while they're sitting down our second dirty and different things they seen them all men and then women with their babies and them old women going across that big mountain praise the Lord and here God was taking care of them going right through those hard mountains just like you and I we're going through those hard places hard times when we wanted to go that way but God says no you're gonna go this way because I'm gonna prove to them that y'all can do it praise the Lord I want to show them I give y'all street to do it is that right Amen hallelujah and when they come down that to the end of it of the road he mean he says God in the Bible he says he turned a blessing into a curse to them he said they should have met y'all with water they should have met y'all with bread when they come to you and let you cross through but because they didn't I'm gonna curse them that curse is you he told Abraham I will bless them that blesses you I will curse them that curse is you I want to tell you I'm in the Garden of Eden back in the beginning who was cursed not Adam not Eve Amos serpent was cursed up on his belly is that right he was cursed in the beginning and I want to take God has never took the curse off of Satan he's still cursed all right he said I'll bless them that bless you and curse them that curse is you and he's blessed here tonight we can't be cursed praise the Lord amen we're part of him we came out of him we're one with him there at the beginning it's a marriage this is a marriage we're one with Christ I mean we're adopted and sons and daughters of God coming to the reality of
