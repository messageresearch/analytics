[52:45] uh let me see Ashley how old are you
[52:49] 25 crystalline how old are you
[52:55] oh you thought I didn't know that

[54:09] come and get one of these hydrangeas and
[54:10] your dad will plant it for you
[54:14] or your mom
[54:17] we'd like to count on David but we know
[54:22] he's done his part he's done no I'm
[54:26] kidding he's the proudest Papa you've
[54:28] ever seen
[54:30] uh but I knew there was going to be a
[54:33] tie 25. that's about as young as I want
[54:36] it to get
[54:38] Jana how old are you
[54:40] we might make an exception
[54:45] I knew there was going to be a tie
[54:46] breaker and the Lord just blessed me to
[54:49] think well yes they're both the same age
[54:51] one or young another but one has most
[54:54] recently had the baby so that's three uh
[54:57] we've got youngest and we've got oldest
[55:00] and now we will get the mother who has
[55:04] the most of her children in the service
[55:06] with her this morning sister Teresa how
[55:09] many do you have
[55:13] stand up if you belong to Teresa let her
[55:15] because she may forget your name she
[55:17] might forget you Stephen get up

[55:29] seven
[55:32] eight
[55:35] are there any more of your own that we

[55:55] and then we have one for the mother who
[55:58] has had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:00] the longest which would also be sister
[56:03] Weems I believe so we'll move down to
[56:06] the next one sister Beverly I think in
[56:08] the past it might have been you how many
[56:10] years have you had the baptism of the
[56:12] Holy Ghost
[56:13] has anybody had the Holy Ghost longer
[56:16] than 52 years
[56:19] all right sister Beverly at the end will
[56:21] you come and get one of these hydrangeas
[56:23] and have Martha to help you get it
[56:25] planted and we want to say to all of the
[56:29] mothers but to these special Mothers we
[56:31] want to say again happy Mother's Day
[56:33] thank you all for worshiping with us
[56:34] today
[56:41] we have a gift here and I I know that
[56:44] sometimes it's not easy coming up but I
[56:47] really liked it this time
[56:50] um it is a it's a devotional but it's a
[56:53] prayer Journal it has lots of empty
[56:55] spaces for you to write your prayer
[56:58] names and prayer requests and your
[57:01] answered prayers
[57:03] I hope you have to buy another notebook
[57:05] to write all your answered prayers in it
[57:07] but about this time last year we were
[57:10] preaching on Joy so uh the pen you can
[57:13] have a journal and a pen to both of them
[57:16] say on their joy in the journey
[57:19] and I like that because there's a lot of
[57:22] other things in the journey but you've
[57:24] got to find joy in the journey so we're
[57:27] not going to have you to come right now
[57:28] we're going to do that at the end of the
[57:30] service but I wanted you to know that we
[57:33] have something for you this morning
[57:35] isn't the Lord good
[57:37] he's so good let's praise God again
[57:45] let me just do this real quick God bless
[57:47] every one of you who are on the Stream
[57:51] and uh
[57:54] I didn't even realize this till this
[57:56] morning
[57:57] that
[57:59] they uh go ahead and put the title
[58:03] on YouTube
[58:08] or it was there
[58:11] for the service this morning the title
[58:14] is there because I saw where
[58:16] sister Martha I thought
[58:19] am I looking at the right one
[58:21] give me just a moment sister Martha
[58:23] Miller said I already like the
[58:25] the name of the message this morning is
[58:28] fiercely faithful and anointed women of
[58:31] God
[58:31] fiercely faithful and anointed women of
[58:34] God
[58:35] guess what you all don't have to have a
[58:37] Mother's Day sermon on being submissive
[58:43] and dominating women
[58:47] I believe that we should be submissive
[58:50] sister should be submissive and I
[58:52] believe women do have a tendency to be
[58:54] dominating
[58:55] but I don't believe that all women are
[58:57] that way
[58:59] you're quiet
[59:01] I was just announcing the theme in many
[59:03] of our churches this morning
[59:06] there are many churches around this
[59:07] message that will be the message it'll
[59:09] start out happy Mother's day God bless
[59:12] all the mothers
[59:14] and then there will be about an hour and
[59:15] a half making sure the women remember
[59:17] that they're related to Eve
[59:21] that's rough talk I'm doing ain't it I
[59:24] must be getting old
[59:26] but I hope at the end they'll come on
[59:28] around to where we'll end today
[59:30] there was a woman who really got things
[59:33] out of whack
[59:34] but there was one in the end who said be
[59:37] it unto me according to Thy Word
[59:41] and you sisters are more related to Mary
[59:43] today than you are to Eve
[59:46] you are because the Holy Ghost has
[59:48] placed you there
[59:50] amen
[59:52] so let's bless all of these streamers
[59:54] here sister Martha Miller yes she saw
[59:56] the title I love this sermon already
[59:58] just from the title

[1:02:06] that's a long time
[1:02:09] that that has gone by quickly for for me
[1:02:12] I don't know about for you all but it's
[1:02:14] going by quickly anyway in gone good
[1:02:17] let's stand and get ready for the word
[1:02:19] nobody turned in a special song for
[1:02:22] those of you that don't know that's how
[1:02:24] we do it
[1:02:25] sometimes we'll have four in a service
[1:02:27] and we can't do that but then we'll have
[1:02:30] several in a row where no one has a song
[1:02:32] or turns it in we don't call on singers
[1:02:35] here our policy is if the Lord lays a
[1:02:38] song on your heart you let us know and
[1:02:40] if we feel like it fits the service we
[1:02:43] ask for the title because we feel like
[1:02:45] if it fits the service what we've got
[1:02:48] for worship what we've got for the word
[1:02:49] then we want to hear from the Lord and
[1:02:52] so if you feel that in the future reach
[1:02:55] out to Benjamin he that's his Department
[1:02:58] uh or you can reach out to me as well
[1:03:01] and we will get a song because we like
[1:03:03] special singing I don't want you to
[1:03:05] think we don't but we also want to leave
[1:03:08] plenty of time for the word this morning
[1:03:10] and uh I worried all week what I would
[1:03:13] preach and then it all came at one time
[1:03:15] and so I got a lot a lot to do 15 pages
[1:03:18] to do this morning
[1:03:22] we'll never get to them will we amen
[1:03:25] what can we sing to get people ready
[1:03:28] I used to sing a song but I couldn't
[1:03:30] sing it this morning when when Mama
[1:03:32] Prayed Heaven paid attention
[1:03:35] and I believe that I believe that we are
[1:03:38] many of us here are
[1:03:41] products uh results
[1:03:44] beneficiaries of mama's tears and Mama's
[1:03:48] prayers and my life was a little bit
[1:03:51] different I spent most of my life
[1:03:52] praying for my mama and then the Lord
[1:03:54] saved her and she spent the rest of her
[1:03:57] life praying for me and you know that's
[1:03:59] all right I'm thankful I I've had
[1:04:02] several nice texts sister Cindy that was
[1:04:05] so sweet of you brother Billy and others
[1:04:07] who reached out to me this morning
[1:04:09] remembering that it would be my first
[1:04:11] birthday knowing that my mother is not

[1:04:15] birthday Mother's Day not my first
[1:04:17] Mother's day without her being in
[1:04:19] service but but being on this Earth and
[1:04:21] all I can say is it feels a little a
[1:04:24] little sad but mostly good and mostly
[1:04:28] glad I wouldn't want her to have to come
[1:04:30] back to the body that she was living in
[1:04:33] I wouldn't want her to have to come back
[1:04:35] for nothing in this world and I look
[1:04:38] forward to seeing her in a new body amen
[1:04:40] and I know that you who have had a
[1:04:43] mother to die in faith you feel the same
[1:04:45] way you'd love to have one more
[1:04:47] conversation
[1:04:48] you know one more meal I'd like to have
[1:04:51] one more of my mama's meals
[1:04:54] uh but we'll have eternity
[1:04:57] well what a different atmosphere it will
[1:04:59] be and we're we're looking forward to
[1:05:01] that this morning uh I don't even know a
[1:05:05] song I don't have to be I can't even

[1:08:11] proverbs 31 verse 10 through 12 who can
[1:08:16] find a virtuous woman for her price is
[1:08:22] far above rubies
[1:08:25] the heart of her husband to safely trust
[1:08:30] in her so that he shall have no need of
[1:08:35] spoil
[1:08:36] she will do him good and not evil all
[1:08:41] the days of her life
[1:08:44] did you know that one of the biggest
[1:08:46] hindrances in relationships today is
[1:08:50] trust
[1:08:51] did you know that a lack of trust will
[1:08:54] hinder your relationship with the Lord
[1:08:56] Jesus Christ
[1:08:58] did you know that if there is no trust
[1:09:00] in a marriage you have a broken
[1:09:03] relationship
[1:09:04] and once trust is broken it is very very
[1:09:08] hard to build it up again but a vow is a
[1:09:12] vow
[1:09:16] a vow is a vow
[1:09:18] and we have to pray through until trust
[1:09:22] can be restored
[1:09:24] in verse in verse 25 we're skipping down
[1:09:28] to 25 through 31 strength and honor are
[1:09:33] her clothing
[1:09:34] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:09:39] she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in
[1:09:44] her tongue is the law of kindness not
[1:09:49] sharpness
[1:09:51] hello let's let's amen the truth
[1:09:54] not sharpness
[1:09:56] in her mouth is the law of kindness
[1:10:01] and just because you're over 50.
[1:10:04] doesn't give you the right not to
[1:10:08] operate with a tongue in the law of
[1:10:10] kindness
[1:10:12] no matter how many years God blesses you
[1:10:15] with on this Earth precious mothers and
[1:10:18] wives and Sisters of the Lord let the
[1:10:21] law of kindness be in your mouth
[1:10:24] not accusation not sharpness not
[1:10:28] bitterness come on you liked it while
[1:10:31] ago
[1:10:34] you liked it while ago now you get quiet
[1:10:38] we've got to make sure nothing gives us
[1:10:40] the right
[1:10:41] to carry the law of sharpness
[1:10:44] bitterness malice in our mouth kindness
[1:10:48] I tell you kindness in a home in a
[1:10:52] relationship
[1:10:53] both parties speaking kindly to one
[1:10:56] another can cover a whole lot of
[1:10:59] mistakes
[1:11:00] is that the truth next verse she looketh
[1:11:05] well to the ways of her household her
[1:11:08] household is her priority
[1:11:12] I'm preaching now not climbing the
[1:11:14] corporate ladder
[1:11:18] it's not that she can't
[1:11:20] oh a woman can do anything she sets her
[1:11:23] mind to do
[1:11:27] you'd be surprised how she can tuck her
[1:11:29] skirt and climb a tree if she has to
[1:11:33] situate her skirt and ride a horse if
[1:11:35] she has to
[1:11:37] she could lead a company I have no doubt
[1:11:39] in my mind that a woman could lead a
[1:11:41] company
[1:11:42] or a nation if necessary so don't you
[1:11:46] think that I think that but I just
[1:11:49] believe there's a higher calling
[1:11:51] higher than being a president or a CEO
[1:11:55] of a company and higher than being the
[1:11:58] leader of a Nation
[1:12:03] powerful when a woman dedicates her life
[1:12:06] to her household
[1:12:08] and she eated not the bread of idleness
[1:12:12] and I will tell you this that Instagram
[1:12:16] and social media uh has greatly hindered
[1:12:21] a virtuous woman in our day
[1:12:24] because she can certainly so quickly
[1:12:26] like men like anybody else can so
[1:12:29] quickly be distracted by those things
[1:12:31] out just slightly perhaps out of her
[1:12:35] reach an ideal life that doesn't exist
[1:12:41] a picture made of a clean countertop
[1:12:44] while the rest of the house is filthy
[1:12:47] and women will get attracted to that
[1:12:49] sometime just like a man can get
[1:12:51] attracted to sports scores and go right
[1:12:54] down the list and read and watch all the
[1:12:56] clips and so forth but but a woman who
[1:12:59] is dedicated to the cleanliness and
[1:13:02] orderliness of her household should be
[1:13:04] honored
[1:13:05] she should be respected
[1:13:08] and one who doesn't eat the bread of
[1:13:10] idleness we ought to salute her
[1:13:13] her children rise up and call her
[1:13:16] blessed are you with me
[1:13:18] her husband also and he
[1:13:22] God had his Blessing to the reading of
[1:13:23] his word you may be seated I want to
[1:13:25] preach
[1:13:26] he prayeth her
[1:13:31] did you know you get a whole lot more
[1:13:33] with honey
[1:13:37] than you do with vinegar
[1:13:41] did you know sometimes husbands don't
[1:13:43] get what they're looking for
[1:13:45] because they they serve more vinegar
[1:13:48] than they do honey
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:53] oh wish I had a wife that would do this
[1:13:57] and this and this and the other well you
[1:13:59] instead of instead of trying to yell at
[1:14:02] her to change her
[1:14:04] that'll never work
[1:14:06] you try to honor her and attract her
[1:14:09] with some sweet words and some kindness
[1:14:12] and you'll be surprised she was created
[1:14:15] to respond to that
[1:14:17] she was taken from inside the man she
[1:14:20] she craves being protected
[1:14:23] you just raise up and defend her come on
[1:14:26] brothers
[1:14:27] you just raise up and defend your wife
[1:14:31] all right
[1:14:32] even against your own mother sometime
[1:14:36] I'm already preaching and I hadn't even
[1:14:38] got to my notes
[1:14:41] you know you you may have a mother that
[1:14:44] is is a bit possessive like mine
[1:14:47] and there was a time that you have to
[1:14:50] stand up sometime
[1:14:52] you're my mama but that's my queen
[1:14:55] come on now and you'd be surprised how
[1:14:58] how far that goes in building a
[1:15:02] relationship
[1:15:03] amen her husband should praise her
[1:15:07] you you may have to creatively find the
[1:15:10] things to call out but you start doing
[1:15:12] that you'll realize they're a whole lot
[1:15:14] more than you realized before
[1:15:16] just a minute
[1:15:19] Amen brother Shelley
[1:15:21] shame on any of us Brothers making it
[1:15:25] hard on our wives to be what God created
[1:15:27] them to be
[1:15:29] and we think we could belittle them or
[1:15:31] abuse them into submission
[1:15:34] no there's only one way to cause a woman
[1:15:36] to submit and that is to love her and
[1:15:39] cherish her like Christ loved the church
[1:15:42] and gave himself for the church
[1:15:46] you come Father's Day I lift up the
[1:15:48] fathers don't you worry I think men are
[1:15:51] terribly belittled and devalued
[1:15:55] in our society so I'll preach to the
[1:15:58] fathers don't you worry but I'm telling
[1:16:00] you if you feel like your wife or your
[1:16:03] the mother of your children is somehow
[1:16:06] slack in any in any way
[1:16:08] the biblical way to help her get up to
[1:16:12] her highest height
[1:16:13] is to praise her there
[1:16:18] amen
[1:16:21] don't break your teeth
[1:16:24] but eat the biscuit
[1:16:30] and if you can't brag on it just do like
[1:16:32] I've had to do with some ugly babies
[1:16:33] along the way
[1:16:36] you just say oh honey
[1:16:40] I've never had another one just like it
[1:16:44] don't beat it on the table
[1:16:47] throw it at the dog
[1:16:51] her children rise up and call her bless
[1:16:53] her husband also and he praisetheth her
[1:16:58] oh my I wonder how long it's been since
[1:17:01] some of us have praised our wives
[1:17:05] now that's not the same devotion you
[1:17:07] give to God but it's the same word
[1:17:11] and you know what it simply means to
[1:17:13] lift up
[1:17:16] I'm telling you you will you will
[1:17:19] benefit it's a little sneaky but you
[1:17:22] will benefit
[1:17:24] in life if you will learn to lift up
[1:17:27] your wife and the mother of your
[1:17:29] children and your children even you
[1:17:31] grown children because there's a lot of
[1:17:33] grown children today that never got
[1:17:35] really grown
[1:17:37] you want more out of your mother you
[1:17:39] lift her up sometime
[1:17:42] that's right it's just the right way you
[1:17:44] see this is not a foreign concept
[1:17:46] because it's how Believers should treat
[1:17:49] believers
[1:17:51] we need to lift one another up
[1:17:54] you know it's never right for us to wag
[1:17:57] our head and say he got what he deserved
[1:18:00] that's my brother
[1:18:02] it may be he may be reaping what he
[1:18:05] sowed
[1:18:06] but I'd like to lift him up if I can
[1:18:09] if at all possible let's go on I can see
[1:18:12] that I'm going to have a time today
[1:18:15] many daughters have done virtuously
[1:18:18] but Solomon says in this but thou
[1:18:22] excellest them all
[1:18:25] every man should come to a place that he
[1:18:29] feels that way about the mother of his
[1:18:31] children
[1:18:34] thou excellus them all
[1:18:38] a couple more verses faith faith is
[1:18:40] deceitful
[1:18:42] and beauty
[1:18:43] is vain
[1:18:46] we've mentioned a little bit around here
[1:18:48] Tuesday night about the falseness
[1:18:51] of our society
[1:18:54] that's what we're dealing with in this
[1:18:56] hour
[1:18:58] it's not Beauty
[1:19:00] it's vanity
[1:19:02] it's phony it's fake
[1:19:05] the worst thing to me to see I'll be
[1:19:08] honest with you the most unattractive
[1:19:10] and nearly disgusting thing that I see
[1:19:13] in this world today is a woman who
[1:19:16] thinks she's a Barbie doll
[1:19:20] I don't have anything wrong with a woman
[1:19:21] being slim if she's capable of being
[1:19:24] that I'm not against blonde hair
[1:19:27] come on that's not what I'm talking
[1:19:29] about
[1:19:30] I'm not against her Living in a Dream
[1:19:33] boat and being married to Barbie
[1:19:35] that's not what I'm doing no no no no
[1:19:37] but I'm talking about phoniness Ken what
[1:19:41] did I say
[1:19:47] some of you know how prophetic I can be
[1:19:53] I don't know my children didn't play
[1:19:55] with Barbie dolls I didn't let my girls
[1:19:58] play with them
[1:20:00] so I don't know
[1:20:02] uh it was not something that I wanted
[1:20:05] them to ever see as real
[1:20:09] it's a mental disease
[1:20:12] it's a mental disease it's a mental
[1:20:14] ailment that women get sometimes that
[1:20:16] they want to look did you know it's it's
[1:20:18] been in the news at times that a woman
[1:20:20] would take one of those things from
[1:20:22] Walmart and go to the doctor and say
[1:20:24] this is what I want
[1:20:26] there's human Barbie dolls and if you
[1:20:30] folks are attractive to that if there's
[1:20:31] a man here that's attracted to that I
[1:20:33] know where you got that attraction
[1:20:35] go back and hear the sermon Tuesday
[1:20:37] night and you'll know where you got it
[1:20:39] that's not attractive
[1:20:41] favor is it's deceitful and beauty is
[1:20:44] vain but a woman that feareth the Lord
[1:20:49] I don't care if she Waddles when she
[1:20:52] walks if she fears the Lord
[1:20:55] I don't care if your complexion could
[1:20:58] use a little help if she fears the Lord
[1:21:02] I don't care if her nose is crooked and
[1:21:04] her lips are too thin
[1:21:07] if she fears the Lord she should be
[1:21:10] praised if we've got a wife who loves
[1:21:14] the Lord who wants to raise our children
[1:21:17] in the faith we should praise her and
[1:21:21] thank her and lift her up every
[1:21:23] opportunity that we can and it's Bible
[1:21:27] to do so
[1:21:28] and verse 31 give her of the fruit of
[1:21:32] her hands
[1:21:34] and let her own works praise her
[1:21:38] in the gates
[1:21:42] that's a virtuous woman
[1:21:45] I know virtuous women
[1:21:47] I know fiercely faithful
[1:21:50] and anointed women of God
[1:21:53] many of whom are mothers
[1:21:56] many of them have not yet had that
[1:22:00] blessing
[1:22:01] many will I have a friend on Facebook
[1:22:04] that I've known personally for many many
[1:22:07] years who never married
[1:22:10] a singer a songwriter a beautiful girl
[1:22:15] she wrote that little song Here I Am
[1:22:20] that one little lost lamb and here I am
[1:22:23] he went searching for that one little
[1:22:26] lost lamb and here I am she never
[1:22:27] married
[1:22:28] I read her post yesterday and she wrote
[1:22:32] about what kind of a mother I think I
[1:22:35] would have been
[1:22:36] what kind of a giver I think I would
[1:22:38] have been and how I think I would have
[1:22:40] but but it wasn't it wasn't she never
[1:22:43] married
[1:22:44] so she didn't give that opportunity and
[1:22:47] so she said I realized in my life that I
[1:22:50] would find another way to give
[1:22:52] and to give and to serve I'm not
[1:22:56] preaching only to mothers today
[1:22:59] I'm preaching to fiercely faithful and
[1:23:02] anointed women of God who should be
[1:23:06] honored who should be recognized who
[1:23:08] should be remembered and I like what
[1:23:10] brother Brandon said about Mother's Day
[1:23:12] He said they've made it made it a big
[1:23:14] commercial thing
[1:23:16] he said why can you imagine giving your
[1:23:19] mother flowers one day out of the year
[1:23:24] I thought you all liked the quotes
[1:23:28] he said can you imagine giving your
[1:23:30] mother he said every day ought to be
[1:23:32] Mother's Day
[1:23:34] you ought to honor and love your mother
[1:23:37] and we can say your wife as the mother
[1:23:40] of your children every day of the you'll
[1:23:44] have a lot happier life
[1:23:46] how many of you have ever heard happy
[1:23:47] wife
[1:23:51] how many of you have ever heard if mama
[1:23:54] ain't happy
[1:23:58] you don't even have to have a verse
[1:24:03] Society sometimes will tell us
[1:24:06] we can just learn
[1:24:08] so I'm preaching about fiercely faithful
[1:24:11] and anointed women of God and I'm also
[1:24:14] preaching about Mama bears
[1:24:18] in Exodus chapter 2 verse one through
[1:24:21] four I want to talk to you about a
[1:24:23] fiercely faithful anointed woman of God
[1:24:25] her name was yokabed
[1:24:28] she was a mother with a plan
[1:24:30] the Bible said there went a man out of
[1:24:33] the house of Levi and took to wife a
[1:24:36] daughter of Levi priest
[1:24:38] Priestly families both of them and the
[1:24:42] woman conceived and bear a son
[1:24:45] and when she saw him that he was a
[1:24:48] goodly child
[1:24:50] she hid him three months and when she
[1:24:54] could no longer hide him she took for
[1:24:57] him an ark of bull rushes and dobbed it
[1:25:00] with slime and with pitch and put the
[1:25:03] child there in and she laid it in the
[1:25:06] flags by the rivers Bank
[1:25:09] and his sister stood afar off to wit
[1:25:12] what would be done to him we know this
[1:25:16] story like we know our own story a
[1:25:19] decree was made that all the male
[1:25:22] children were going to be killed even
[1:25:24] first The Midwives were told that you
[1:25:27] should do away with the boys
[1:25:30] and now a decree goes out that says all
[1:25:33] the male firstborns excuse me all the
[1:25:36] male babies that are born are to die
[1:25:39] and uh the next thing you know here is
[1:25:43] Yoga bed or yogavid who is swelling in
[1:25:48] her belly and she realizes that she is
[1:25:51] going to be a mother and it is the most
[1:25:54] inopportune time
[1:25:56] it couldn't be a more inconvenient time
[1:25:59] to have a child in in the in the
[1:26:02] atmosphere in the political environment
[1:26:04] that they were living in right then
[1:26:07] knowing that if this child were a baby
[1:26:10] boy that he would not survive and yet
[1:26:13] she nourished that child and she took
[1:26:16] care of herself and she watched what she
[1:26:19] ate and she watched what she did and she
[1:26:23] was careful not to fall down and she was
[1:26:26] careful not to do something so dangerous
[1:26:28] because she was nourishing a lot not
[1:26:30] knowing whether exactly what was going
[1:26:33] on in her womb not knowing exactly what
[1:26:35] this baby was going to be but God began
[1:26:38] to talk to her
[1:26:40] talks to Mama sometimes
[1:26:42] and he began to talk to her about the
[1:26:45] destiny of her child and he began to
[1:26:48] tell her I believe with all my heart
[1:26:49] that he began to tell her a deliverer is
[1:26:52] coming in your womb
[1:26:54] and she began to thank God for that
[1:26:57] little baby and you know what I believe
[1:26:58] she began to talk to him
[1:27:00] now his name wasn't Moses then
[1:27:03] because he wasn't named until he was
[1:27:05] Drew out of the water that's what Moses
[1:27:07] means Moshe means to be drawn from the
[1:27:10] water I don't know what she was calling
[1:27:12] him when he was in her belly but but she
[1:27:14] was talking to him and she was telling
[1:27:17] him you've got a destiny ahead of you
[1:27:20] perhaps she already began to to speak
[1:27:22] words of life as some of you mothers
[1:27:25] have done and science has borne out the
[1:27:29] reality that the child can recognize its
[1:27:33] mother's voice if it constantly is
[1:27:35] hearing that in the womb I believe that
[1:27:38] a mama should bless that child and speak
[1:27:41] Words of Life to that child and tell
[1:27:44] that baby you're wanted
[1:27:46] your Mom and Daddy can hardly wait to
[1:27:49] get you here and I think you've got to
[1:27:52] practice being just as exuberant
[1:27:55] on number five
[1:27:58] as you were number one
[1:28:00] because the destiny of every one of your
[1:28:03] individual children is powerful and
[1:28:06] beautiful in the sight of God
[1:28:09] and they deserve your attention
[1:28:11] I preached very strongly that a mother
[1:28:14] shouldn't bear more children than she is
[1:28:16] able to devote herself to
[1:28:19] and the father should not expect to
[1:28:21] Father more children than he can
[1:28:24] financially provide for
[1:28:27] that number may be different in
[1:28:29] different homes and families like
[1:28:31] brother Branham told us about birth
[1:28:33] control that's an that's a that's an
[1:28:35] interview matter that's a matter I might
[1:28:37] discuss with you privately we'll talk
[1:28:40] about that uh privately there is no law
[1:28:43] that just comes right down in the
[1:28:45] community on certain things like that
[1:28:47] we're not in the Roman Catholic system
[1:28:50] but I don't think a mother should
[1:28:51] continue to have children that she can't
[1:28:53] nurt you and care for
[1:28:57] I knew this would be a little rough
[1:28:59] getting started just a moment Amen
[1:29:01] brother
[1:29:02] you you shouldn't child into the world
[1:29:04] and expect somebody else to nurture that
[1:29:06] child on your behalf
[1:29:08] my may God raise up lots of nurturers
[1:29:12] for your children
[1:29:14] I wanted mine to have as many loved ones
[1:29:16] as they could have I wanted as many
[1:29:18] people to love my children as possibly
[1:29:21] could love them
[1:29:23] because they need that they need a
[1:29:26] community
[1:29:27] but I didn't want to have any more than
[1:29:29] we could pour ourselves into as a mama
[1:29:31] and a dad and my my responsibility is
[1:29:34] pretty heavy here I wanted to to please
[1:29:37] God in those things and I encourage you
[1:29:40] young couples to do the same watch your
[1:29:43] life watch where you are watch where you
[1:29:45] are financially
[1:29:48] you speak into that life when that
[1:29:52] little baby is growing in the womb
[1:29:53] Hallelujah aren't we blessed to have
[1:29:56] three beautiful babies here and more on
[1:29:58] the way may God bless them
[1:30:01] every time you think of them will you
[1:30:03] pray for them that God will protect them
[1:30:05] from every disease
[1:30:07] every hindrance if you've got a fever
[1:30:10] will you love them from a distance
[1:30:12] if you've been sneezing and coughing and
[1:30:15] hecking and carrying on when you love
[1:30:16] them from across the room how many of
[1:30:18] you believe wisdom is an important
[1:30:20] virtue
[1:30:22] it don't always run in families
[1:30:28] wisdom sometimes comes by experience and
[1:30:31] we want to use all that we can because
[1:30:34] we're all Guardians I'll be honest with
[1:30:37] you they all belong to me
[1:30:41] come on
[1:30:42] you're I'm not their mother
[1:30:45] I'm not their father
[1:30:47] but there belonged to me in some ways
[1:30:49] I'm responsible to help shape their
[1:30:52] Destiny from this house I can't replace
[1:30:55] her daddy I can't replace their mother
[1:30:58] or their grandparents but I have a
[1:31:00] responsibility this church Community has
[1:31:03] a responsibility one of the things God
[1:31:06] told us when he placed Us in this
[1:31:07] building was to build stronger families
[1:31:11] and that's what we want to do we don't
[1:31:13] want to lose any of our teenagers to the
[1:31:16] world
[1:31:17] we want to submit them to God as early
[1:31:20] as possible and keep them there with
[1:31:23] everything that is within us hear this
[1:31:26] woman she said I don't know how it's all
[1:31:28] going to turn out but I believe God's
[1:31:31] going to use you little fella I may not
[1:31:33] know the extent of it but I know that
[1:31:35] God is going to use you one of these
[1:31:37] days and then the Bible tells us here
[1:31:40] that when she saw the child she said
[1:31:44] this is a goodly child
[1:31:50] it's a strange statement that I have I
[1:31:52] hope you will stay with me
[1:31:55] this is a strange statement that I have
[1:31:57] preached about multiple times through
[1:32:00] the years when you hear that word good
[1:32:03] or goodly it makes you wonder is there
[1:32:07] ever a mother that would see her little
[1:32:09] child and say he's he's bad
[1:32:13] no
[1:32:15] you see brother random knew there was a
[1:32:17] difference between being a baby mama
[1:32:20] and the mother
[1:32:22] he preached to us that there's women who
[1:32:25] bear children that aren't mothers
[1:32:28] he said it he talked about one throwed
[1:32:30] their baby in the river he said now that
[1:32:32] wasn't a mama that wasn't a mother she
[1:32:34] may be a woman that had a baby
[1:32:36] he understood and it doesn't seem
[1:32:39] reasonable that any mother would have a
[1:32:41] child and say you're a bad little baby
[1:32:45] why did the Bible record that yokovic
[1:32:49] said
[1:32:50] you are a goodly child
[1:32:52] because that's from the Hebrew word
[1:32:55] Tove and it means when you see something
[1:33:00] bringing forth
[1:33:03] a harvest
[1:33:05] of the destiny that was in it in its
[1:33:09] planting in its beginning
[1:33:11] when God started creation
[1:33:15] and he looked at it and he said it's
[1:33:18] good the word is told and it means I
[1:33:21] already see your future
[1:33:24] and you are already producing what I
[1:33:28] know that you will produce so she was
[1:33:31] prophesying hello
[1:33:34] she was prophesying over her baby you're
[1:33:37] a goodly child you're a Tove child I see
[1:33:42] you as a as a hero bringing forth the
[1:33:46] seed of your destiny as you grow older
[1:33:50] come on now
[1:33:51] that's why mother should never a father
[1:33:53] should never use words like you're
[1:33:56] rebellious
[1:34:03] you're a loser
[1:34:06] you're stupid
[1:34:08] oh that's not the way to cause them to
[1:34:10] bring forth tov
[1:34:13] I see you bringing forth life
[1:34:16] I see you serving God and raising your
[1:34:19] family in the fear of the Lord come on
[1:34:22] she was prophesying over that little
[1:34:24] child
[1:34:25] she as I told you a moment ago she was a
[1:34:28] a levite woman and she didn't wait until
[1:34:30] that baby was born until she started
[1:34:33] formulating a plan you get a mama with a
[1:34:36] plan and you've got something Brother
[1:34:38] come on she said I gotta figure a way if
[1:34:42] indeed this is a boy I've got to find a
[1:34:44] way to hide this child and she she
[1:34:46] started making her a little basket
[1:34:49] she began to weave the bull rushes
[1:34:52] together
[1:34:53] she began to pitch that thing with slime
[1:34:55] and tar she knew the day was coming that
[1:34:58] she wouldn't be able to hide that child
[1:35:00] anymore she couldn't nurse that child
[1:35:02] anymore can you imagine having to give
[1:35:04] your child up at three months old
[1:35:07] literally peeling that child off of your
[1:35:09] breast and laying him in a little basket
[1:35:12] and putting him in a crocodile infested
[1:35:14] River
[1:35:15] full of Whirlwind of whirlpools sorry
[1:35:18] full of whirlpools
[1:35:20] but she knew that there was a god
[1:35:25] who never makes mistakes
[1:35:27] and God didn't give her that baby in the
[1:35:30] wrong season
[1:35:31] he gave her that baby in a season where
[1:35:34] a deliverer was needed
[1:35:36] the whole world might have said what a
[1:35:38] sorry time for a baby to be born but God
[1:35:41] said this is right on time
[1:35:45] this isn't an ordinary baby this is a
[1:35:47] seed of Destiny this is a Prophet this
[1:35:51] is a deliverer he will be a forerunner
[1:35:54] of the Messiah
[1:35:55] come on
[1:35:57] he's going to lead his people out
[1:35:59] she had to peel that child off of her
[1:36:02] nursing breast Place him in a in a in a
[1:36:05] a basket of hope that she had crafted
[1:36:09] with her own hands and she had to lay
[1:36:11] him down in a body of water full of
[1:36:13] crocodiles and whirlpools brother
[1:36:15] Branham in that little in that little
[1:36:18] sermon the story of Moses where he
[1:36:20] dramatias is the story so beautifully it
[1:36:24] could capture anybody's attention he
[1:36:26] talks about a crocodile smelling that
[1:36:29] little baby in the in the basket and
[1:36:31] swimming over there and an angel of God
[1:36:33] comes down in thumps that old crocodile
[1:36:36] on the snout
[1:36:39] and say you get back over to that bank
[1:36:41] where you belong this is not your dinner
[1:36:43] this is my deliverer this is a deliverer
[1:36:46] for the people of God think about it
[1:36:48] and then then the little baby would
[1:36:51] float down float down float down toward
[1:36:52] Pharaoh's house and a little Whirlpool
[1:36:54] would catch that baby and it might begin
[1:36:57] to spin around like it was going down
[1:36:58] and an angel of the Lord would come with
[1:37:00] a finger and push somebody said I just
[1:37:03] don't know if I can get a hold of that
[1:37:04] or not you don't understand the times
[1:37:07] you don't understand the times that the
[1:37:09] angels of the Lord have fought for you
[1:37:11] and your babies mamas
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:14] mothers
[1:37:19] I
[1:37:21] I've thought of this many times
[1:37:24] I've thought about Hawk
[1:37:27] his mother Freda here today
[1:37:30] Hawk was not raised a Christian
[1:37:33] but raised by a loving mother
[1:37:36] I want you to know that goes a long way
[1:37:39] he got into trouble
[1:37:41] he gives his testimony it's not mine to
[1:37:44] give but he has told me things about
[1:37:46] himself that I don't believe
[1:37:49] he's told me that I was more full of
[1:37:51] hate than anybody I knew
[1:37:54] and I was angrier than anybody I knew
[1:37:58] that's what he thought about himself but
[1:38:00] I want you to know from the time that
[1:38:02] Miss Frida had hawk in her belly he was
[1:38:04] a seed of God
[1:38:07] he had a destiny to perform
[1:38:10] come on and I want you to know the drugs
[1:38:13] couldn't get it see for Moses it was the
[1:38:16] crocodiles that couldn't get him
[1:38:18] it was the whirlpools it couldn't get
[1:38:20] him for Hawk it was the drugs that
[1:38:22] couldn't kill him
[1:38:24] the fights couldn't kill him
[1:38:27] the poison that he was taking into his
[1:38:29] life couldn't kill him because there was
[1:38:31] an angel of the Lord
[1:38:34] that was fighting for his destiny
[1:38:38] come on now we could go all the way
[1:38:41] around this room
[1:38:42] and say mama can only do so much
[1:38:47] mothers can only do their part but it
[1:38:51] takes the army of the Heavenly Host
[1:38:56] to watch over these children
[1:38:58] to guard their destinies
[1:39:01] oh yes it takes a village sometime a
[1:39:06] spiritual Village
[1:39:08] not a worldly Village
[1:39:10] but a spiritual Community to help guard
[1:39:13] the Suri baharendama
[1:39:20] foreign the seeds of Destiny
[1:39:26] jacoved was a mother with a plan
[1:39:29] you're not no no no no no no no no no no
[1:39:32] Pharaoh's not going to have him no no no
[1:39:34] no no no the crocodile's not gonna have
[1:39:37] him the whirlpool is not going to drown
[1:39:39] him he's a goodly child with a huge
[1:39:42] Destiny ahead and I want you to know she
[1:39:44] was praying she put some legs on her
[1:39:46] prayers she sent her little daughter to
[1:39:48] run down chase that that basket I want
[1:39:51] you to watch where it goes
[1:39:53] oh can you imagine
[1:39:56] Miriam's Delight can you imagine her
[1:39:59] Delight when she saw that little basket
[1:40:01] float right up to the bathing pool of
[1:40:04] the daughter of pharaoh
[1:40:05] there are these beautiful Maids are out
[1:40:07] there in there in their you know lotus
[1:40:10] flowers are floating around I don't have
[1:40:12] time to be dramatic and but it's just a
[1:40:14] beautiful scene these beautiful maidens
[1:40:17] are around bathing in the water and
[1:40:20] Pharaoh's daughter maybe just standing
[1:40:21] there on the side I don't know exactly
[1:40:24] what the scenario was but all of a
[1:40:25] sudden this the spirit of the Lord the
[1:40:27] hand of the Lord the angel of the Lord
[1:40:30] just allowed that basket to float right
[1:40:33] in there and they took that little
[1:40:35] basket up and and oh she recognized you
[1:40:38] said this must be one of the Hebrew
[1:40:40] babies
[1:40:42] but God somehow put a love in her heart
[1:40:45] may I say to you today you don't have to
[1:40:48] be the biological mother of a child to
[1:40:51] love that child fiercely
[1:40:56] we have examples of that in our church
[1:41:00] community
[1:41:02] she drew that child up they named him
[1:41:05] Moshe being drawn up from the water and
[1:41:09] she said I must find a wet nurse
[1:41:13] among the Hebrew people perhaps that
[1:41:15] would would feed this little baby in
[1:41:17] Miriam's in the in the pecan through the
[1:41:19] papers you know
[1:41:21] and she's dares can you imagine the fear
[1:41:25] she's spying on Pharaoh's daughter
[1:41:28] and she speaks up and says across the
[1:41:30] ranch there she speaks up and says I
[1:41:33] know just the one
[1:41:35] this was not a coincidence
[1:41:39] this was not happenstance
[1:41:41] that little mother that had peeled that
[1:41:44] little child off of her nursing breast
[1:41:46] now gets to have him back for a little
[1:41:50] while longer
[1:41:51] she's called to the palace and she
[1:41:54] nurses her own child and continues to
[1:41:57] talk to him
[1:42:00] don't cry Moses you're a deliverer
[1:42:06] let Mama whip your slobber one of these
[1:42:10] days God's Gonna use your mumbling
[1:42:12] tongue
[1:42:13] to deliver his people
[1:42:17] come on that's a Mama
[1:42:19] that is a mother
[1:42:22] someone who refuses to look at
[1:42:26] circumstances and the environment
[1:42:30] maybe maybe a young mother here today
[1:42:33] could say well I don't know whether I'd
[1:42:35] really want to bring a baby into this
[1:42:37] world or not the question is not what
[1:42:40] you would desire the question is what
[1:42:43] God would desire
[1:42:44] and I want you to know if there's yet a
[1:42:46] seed to be expressed in the earth one of
[1:42:49] God's foreign own elected and
[1:42:51] predestinated why don't you
[1:42:56] why not you
[1:42:57] you let your faith continue to reach up
[1:43:00] to him and believe that all of his
[1:43:02] goodness is all around us his promises
[1:43:05] are yea and amen
[1:43:08] there was a mama now in a message why
[1:43:10] Christ speak
[1:43:13] paragraph 61 I've got to hurry
[1:43:16] God had called him from his birth
[1:43:18] put qualities in him of great faith and
[1:43:21] then come down with his presence and
[1:43:23] anointed that great something in him and
[1:43:25] sent him down with his word and he was a
[1:43:28] properly a Vindicated of his claims
[1:43:31] no matter how many quacks had raised up
[1:43:34] how many of these other things that
[1:43:36] happened God was speaking Moses was
[1:43:38] identified Moses what Moses said
[1:43:43] God honored I want you to never forget
[1:43:45] that word what Moses said
[1:43:48] because God's word was in Moses I'll be
[1:43:52] with your mouth it'll speak the right
[1:43:54] things now what God says he speaks it
[1:43:57] through Moses and it confirmed and
[1:44:00] Vindicated his claims
[1:44:02] also he was told by his mother of his
[1:44:05] mysterious birth and how that the time
[1:44:07] of hand come close to the hour that
[1:44:09] there was to be a deliverance amram and
[1:44:12] yogavid the Sons and Daughters of Levi
[1:44:15] began to pray to God to send the
[1:44:17] deliverer he was an answer to his own
[1:44:21] mother and Daddy's prayers
[1:44:23] take when you see the time of Promise
[1:44:25] drawing now sets people to praying and
[1:44:28] hunger and no doubt that your covet had
[1:44:30] told him many times his mother as she
[1:44:32] was his tutor also we know the story and
[1:44:36] had told him how that she had prayed in
[1:44:38] Moses when you were born son you were a
[1:44:40] proper child you were different there
[1:44:43] was something taking place at your birth
[1:44:45] see she's pouring into him
[1:44:47] brother Adam said I gave a drama on it
[1:44:49] for the children not long ago and and
[1:44:51] said while amraham was in the room
[1:44:53] praying he saw an angel pull his sword
[1:44:56] and point it toward the North and said
[1:44:58] you'll have a child and he'll take the
[1:45:00] children North to the promised land
[1:45:02] given a drama for the little fellas so
[1:45:04] they'd understand it uh that their
[1:45:07] intellect hasn't come up to the place
[1:45:08] that you adults and can grasp the things
[1:45:11] his holy spirit reveals it to you now
[1:45:14] though his mother had told him these
[1:45:16] things that he knowed this yet he needed
[1:45:19] another touch the teaching was fine but
[1:45:23] he needed a personal contact he needed
[1:45:25] his own experience now mama you can't do
[1:45:28] that
[1:45:30] God don't have any grandchildren are you
[1:45:33] with me today
[1:45:34] you can tell them over and over and over
[1:45:36] and over again what God's got for them
[1:45:39] but you can't make them be what God
[1:45:41] called him to be that's when you have to
[1:45:43] put them in your little basket and say
[1:45:45] now God they're yours
[1:45:48] I'm floating you in the river
[1:45:51] I don't know I don't know between now
[1:45:53] and then but I know that at the end of
[1:45:55] the end
[1:45:56] I know there's coming a Time
[1:45:59] I say that to you mothers and dads who
[1:46:03] have
[1:46:04] children who have gone astray
[1:46:07] they're no longer in your care
[1:46:09] you no longer have the biggest voice in
[1:46:12] their life
[1:46:13] but it doesn't mean that you have given
[1:46:15] up and it doesn't mean that God isn't on
[1:46:18] the case
[1:46:19] amen and God knows how to bring them
[1:46:21] right back to him
[1:46:23] he knows how to draw them back to
[1:46:25] himself and he knows how to fulfill
[1:46:28] every word that was ever spoken to you
[1:46:31] about their destiny
[1:46:33] he said that's what the world needs
[1:46:35] today that's what the church needs today
[1:46:36] that's what everyone needs Sons and
[1:46:38] Daughters of God in order to be that you
[1:46:40] need a personal contact see something no
[1:46:43] matter you know the word is true you
[1:46:45] know it's right but then when it
[1:46:47] contacts
[1:46:49] I could go back to Hawke's testimony
[1:46:53] If I Had the Time
[1:46:55] because he didn't even know what there
[1:46:57] was
[1:46:58] until God reached down then
[1:47:01] and put his finger on that seed made
[1:47:04] contact with his life how about you do
[1:47:08] you remember when God made contact with
[1:47:10] your life
[1:47:12] it's the most valuable thing that could
[1:47:14] ever happen to you when God puts his
[1:47:17] finger on your heart
[1:47:18] you see the thing done
[1:47:20] then you know you're on the right Road
[1:47:22] see and watch it'll always be scriptural
[1:47:26] it'll stand right with scripture because
[1:47:29] this did no matter let's go on
[1:47:34] was that the end of that one all right I
[1:47:36] I think there's one more a true sign
[1:47:39] that's overlooked just a short little
[1:47:41] paragraph there and so when amram and
[1:47:44] yokovid saw that it was time for the
[1:47:46] word to be fulfilled they went to prayer
[1:47:49] to God and it's usually those who pray
[1:47:52] is the one who's got the burden the one
[1:47:55] who gets something
[1:47:59] the one who prays the one who's got the
[1:48:02] burden
[1:48:03] is usually the one that gets something
[1:48:05] if anybody can testify of that same man
[1:48:08] it's those who pray
[1:48:11] that's ordained of God to do so
[1:48:16] then there was another anointed
[1:48:19] fiercely faithful woman of God that's in
[1:48:22] my heart
[1:48:24] her name was Deborah
[1:48:27] in Hebrew devorah
[1:48:31] I want you to see if you can picture her
[1:48:33] riding a horse
[1:48:36] she's riding out to battle
[1:48:39] like Joan of Arc
[1:48:41] he's leading 10
[1:48:43] 000 soldiers into the field
[1:48:47] she's waiting to hear God's voice
[1:48:50] she's realized that unless the leaders
[1:48:54] of her Nation act the Hebrew people are
[1:48:58] about to be annihilated
[1:49:01] it didn't matter how many times God had
[1:49:04] spared the Hebrew people before it was
[1:49:07] another day
[1:49:08] and another hour and another
[1:49:11] circumstances and what was needed was
[1:49:15] for the leaders of the nation to do
[1:49:17] something and when they wouldn't do
[1:49:19] something guess what God did
[1:49:23] he raised up a fiercely faithful
[1:49:26] anointed woman of God
[1:49:35] who said
[1:49:37] I'd rather you do it
[1:49:40] I'd rather you do it I'd rather you get
[1:49:42] the credit
[1:49:44] but if you won't move
[1:49:48] I'm going to move
[1:49:53] I don't believe in women pastors
[1:49:56] I don't believe the Bible
[1:49:58] the authority of the Bible is behind a
[1:50:01] woman pastor
[1:50:02] even a woman preaching to men I don't
[1:50:06] believe that that is the order that God
[1:50:08] has initiated but I want to tell you
[1:50:11] something this message
[1:50:14] is in the hands of hundreds of thousands
[1:50:16] of people
[1:50:18] not because of preachers
[1:50:23] but because of women
[1:50:27] foreign
[1:50:30] she didn't have to preach
[1:50:33] she didn't have to fill the pulpit
[1:50:35] she didn't have to block the baptistry
[1:50:38] picture
[1:50:39] all she had to do was witness at the
[1:50:41] wash line
[1:50:43] all she had to do was tell those that
[1:50:45] she came in contact with here I got a
[1:50:47] little booklet here but you like to
[1:50:48] would you like to re I've got a I've got
[1:50:50] a favorite preacher here on a cassette
[1:50:52] tape would you like to hear would you
[1:50:54] would you like to borrow this uh
[1:50:57] preacher has set my world on fire
[1:51:00] and I just wonder if you'd like to have
[1:51:03] it I only got one copy but I'm willing
[1:51:08] you got to let them know how precious it
[1:51:10] is
[1:51:12] you don't walk up to somebody say I know
[1:51:14] you're never going to listen to this
[1:51:17] you tell them this is all I got
[1:51:19] and I'd like to have it back if you
[1:51:21] don't want it it's precious to me but I
[1:51:25] love you and I'd like to share this with
[1:51:27] you hello
[1:51:30] and it went
[1:51:32] it went to the watering holes they
[1:51:34] gathered around rivers in Africa
[1:51:37] with no cassette players what you gonna
[1:51:40] do then
[1:51:41] what's a woman going to do when there's
[1:51:42] no cassette player to share a tape with
[1:51:45] her neighbor
[1:51:46] she's going to have to tell it
[1:51:51] it would have been more biblically
[1:51:52] appropriate if the woman at the well
[1:51:54] would have had a tape player and a tape
[1:52:02] she could have taken that from house to
[1:52:04] house in the town and said here I'd like
[1:52:06] to play you a sermon of a prayer but
[1:52:07] there was no need no time for that no
[1:52:10] technology for that
[1:52:12] so guess what she did Mahalia Jackson
[1:52:14] said it best she went running running
[1:52:16] running running
[1:52:22] she said
[1:52:26] the people
[1:52:29] why because she was fiercely anointed
[1:52:33] fiercely faithful and anointed and she
[1:52:37] told everybody come see that's not a
[1:52:41] woman Pastor hello
[1:52:43] that's not a woman preacher that's not a
[1:52:46] woman not being submissive
[1:52:49] that's a woman not waiting on her
[1:52:51] husband to witness the truth
[1:52:55] you can't tell what he did for your
[1:52:56] husband
[1:52:57] but you can tell what he did for you
[1:53:00] you don't have to do it in a preacher
[1:53:02] voice
[1:53:04] you don't have to say glory to God
[1:53:06] hallelujah thank you Jesus ah
[1:53:10] you don't have to do it Pentecostal
[1:53:12] Style
[1:53:13] you don't have to spit and sputter
[1:53:16] you can just share you better tell
[1:53:18] somebody you better tell somebody you
[1:53:20] better tell somebody woman of God you
[1:53:23] better share your life
[1:53:25] you better share your light you better
[1:53:28] watch your witness at Walmart you better
[1:53:30] watch your witness in your automobile
[1:53:32] you better watch your witness in your
[1:53:34] neighborhood
[1:53:37] because you are called to be fiercely
[1:53:39] faithful and anointed in this hour you
[1:53:42] don't have to be a pastor or an
[1:53:44] unsubmissive woman to do those things
[1:53:47] you're anointed to do those things you
[1:53:50] are called to do those things
[1:53:53] somebody said I I want my husband to be
[1:53:56] the priest of the home that's God's
[1:53:58] biblical order
[1:54:00] but don't you sit around and wait on him
[1:54:06] and let the TV raise your children
[1:54:10] while you're waiting on Bible order to
[1:54:12] fall
[1:54:13] you tell your children you raise your
[1:54:16] children you show your children
[1:54:19] come on now
[1:54:20] brother random said there's five Gospels
[1:54:23] Matthew Mark Luke John and mother
[1:54:29] you read it you share it you tell them
[1:54:32] you'll be the example
[1:54:35] and you don't have to usurp any
[1:54:36] authority to do it
[1:54:38] it's your responsibility their bone of
[1:54:41] your bone and flesh of your flesh and
[1:54:44] God gave them to you and you are
[1:54:46] partially responsible for their life
[1:54:59] a judge
[1:55:01] a
[1:55:10] I believe A Woman's Place as a mother is
[1:55:13] at home with her children
[1:55:18] I believe that's God's order
[1:55:22] it's not always 100 feasible
[1:55:26] it's more feasible today than it's ever
[1:55:28] been
[1:55:30] because there are so many opportunities
[1:55:31] that a woman can work from home
[1:55:34] somebody said how could that be
[1:55:35] according to the Bible did you read
[1:55:37] Proverbs I left out some verses there go
[1:55:39] back and read them
[1:55:42] the Proverbs 31 Woman is a is a woman
[1:55:45] who has a business
[1:55:53] I only love to preach that because I
[1:55:55] know how women get whipped
[1:56:00] I know how in so many places they get a
[1:56:02] whipping for being creative
[1:56:06] I know in so many places how they get
[1:56:08] kind of talked down to because they have
[1:56:11] a desire to help make a dollar or two
[1:56:13] for their home if you can't do it and
[1:56:16] raise your children and give them your
[1:56:19] attention I don't suggest it
[1:56:22] but how many of you know there comes a
[1:56:24] time when your children are in a place
[1:56:26] you've got one or they're getting old
[1:56:28] enough
[1:56:30] and you've got a desire
[1:56:35] you don't need 40 hours
[1:56:39] not with children at home
[1:56:42] but I don't I tell you what
[1:56:45] I like what my wife has done for our
[1:56:47] family
[1:56:49] as an entrepreneur
[1:56:51] and I don't trust her with real estate
[1:56:53] like the Bible said
[1:56:55] buying land and selling land
[1:56:58] that I've never seen but my money come
[1:57:02] on
[1:57:03] but I don't mind her doing the things
[1:57:05] that she does
[1:57:07] she she doesn't make a tremendous amount
[1:57:10] of income these days but she makes a
[1:57:12] substantial amount to take care of the
[1:57:14] supplements and oils that we use our
[1:57:17] children haven't suffered because of it
[1:57:20] she has been used in Ministry because of
[1:57:23] it it's quiet
[1:57:27] so I just wanted you to know that the
[1:57:29] the Proverbs woman The Virtuous Woman of
[1:57:32] the Bible was not one who just stayed
[1:57:35] around in darn socks
[1:57:39] she was one who had some ambition and
[1:57:41] desire
[1:57:43] not to climb corporate ladder and
[1:57:45] forsaker children
[1:57:47] not to make her husband cook his own
[1:57:49] supper listen your husband shouldn't
[1:57:51] have to come home and cook his own
[1:57:53] supper
[1:58:00] no sir he shouldn't
[1:58:03] you've got to figure a way
[1:58:07] when you're able you do plenty of
[1:58:09] cooking when you're able to do it you do
[1:58:10] all you can
[1:58:12] cook from Sun up till sun down
[1:58:15] buy you a freezer and freeze it
[1:58:19] because there will be times that you may
[1:58:21] not be able to do everything that you
[1:58:23] would like to do but a woman who's
[1:58:25] resourceful like the like the virtuous
[1:58:27] woman that's described there in
[1:58:29] Solomon's writings she finds a way maybe
[1:58:32] I should I read it
[1:58:34] I'll trust you to do the homework
[1:58:36] so be careful be careful folks
[1:58:40] how you judge somebody else's home
[1:58:43] because yours ain't running perhaps the
[1:58:45] way you'd like for it to run
[1:58:50] [Music]
[1:58:53] the Bible doesn't tell us
[1:58:55] that she ever had children of her own
[1:58:58] we don't know
[1:59:01] but the Bible calls her a mother
[1:59:04] anybody with me did you know you can be
[1:59:06] a mother with no children
[1:59:08] according to the Bible you can
[1:59:10] she was a judge she was a prophetess she
[1:59:13] was a warrior a soldier a leader in
[1:59:16] battle
[1:59:17] she was a woman of prayer she was wise
[1:59:20] she was Discerning she was Brave she was
[1:59:23] beautiful and she credited other women
[1:59:26] with helping to win the battle
[1:59:28] we don't know if she ever gave birth to
[1:59:31] a child of her own but Judges chapter 5
[1:59:33] verse 7 says this
[1:59:36] this is uh I I what I gave you was the
[1:59:40] complete Jewish Bible
[1:59:41] I just didn't put cjb but if you could
[1:59:45] if you are you able to pull that because
[1:59:48] the King James changes the the uh
[1:59:51] pronoun
[1:59:54] and no other translation does that
[1:59:58] so I looked at all the other
[2:00:00] translations King James makes it sound
[2:00:03] like Deborah singing about herself
[2:00:05] and I knew some people have a problem
[2:00:07] with that so I started looking into the
[2:00:09] pronouns in the original and found out
[2:00:12] that the King James is the only one that
[2:00:14] says I
[2:00:16] the complete Jewish Bible and Amplified
[2:00:18] and New American Standard and many
[2:00:21] others
[2:00:22] say more like this the ruler ceased in
[2:00:25] Israel they ceased until you arose
[2:00:30] Deborah devorah
[2:00:32] a rose a mother in Israel
[2:00:37] you know what that basically says
[2:00:39] it's it's like the hour we're living in
[2:00:41] right now
[2:00:43] let me sing you a little song
[2:00:46] our leaders have fallen asleep
[2:00:51] they need a pill to sleep and appeal to
[2:00:54] wake up
[2:00:55] and appeal to get through the day
[2:00:58] and we can't depend on them anymore
[2:01:02] and I don't know if we're going to have
[2:01:04] any better choices in the next election
[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:09] because we're not where we were six
[2:01:11] years ago
[2:01:14] what we need is a devorah ah
[2:01:19] what we need is a mother in Israel
[2:01:24] we need some Fierce fiercely faithful
[2:01:28] and anointed women of God to get on
[2:01:32] their prayer bones
[2:01:34] and call on the god of Israel because
[2:01:38] he's the only hope we have
[2:01:41] that's it
[2:01:43] that's what they were singing there when
[2:01:45] our leaders had failed us God God raised
[2:01:49] up a man like Barack God raised up a
[2:01:52] woman like devorah a mother in Israel
[2:01:59] she may have never had children from her
[2:02:02] own womb
[2:02:04] a mother the nation
[2:02:06] hello
[2:02:08] she mothered a nation
[2:02:10] in a season when nation needed a mother
[2:02:14] I want you to know we need mothers
[2:02:17] hello in this day spiritual mamas
[2:02:21] mothers in Zion
[2:02:24] spiritual midwives
[2:02:28] mothers in the nation who will call on
[2:02:32] the Lord
[2:02:33] in in in the message if God be with us
[2:02:36] then where are all the Miracles
[2:02:39] whether Bradham says in paragraph 33
[2:02:43] and this place here we just left a few
[2:02:46] years before this had been the
[2:02:48] prophetess Deborah and Barack
[2:02:51] brother Branham calls her a prophetess
[2:02:53] Bible calls her a judge and a prophetess
[2:02:56] and so much more
[2:02:58] and how that she had prophesied and told
[2:03:01] them what to do and it was just exactly
[2:03:04] right Barack the great warrior how that
[2:03:08] they made us strong of the triumph over
[2:03:12] the enemy it took a warrior like Barack
[2:03:15] and a mother in Israel like devorah to
[2:03:18] get the job done I want to tell you
[2:03:21] something if we are ever to fulfill the
[2:03:24] commission that God has placed on this
[2:03:27] church and on this community we're going
[2:03:29] to need baracks to rise up come on we're
[2:03:33] going to need men who will not be
[2:03:35] wishy-washy in the time of the battle
[2:03:37] hello we're going to need men who will
[2:03:41] not let their attitude keep them from
[2:03:44] doing what God would have them to do
[2:03:50] we're going to need men to raise up like
[2:03:53] Barack
[2:03:54] to war in the spirit
[2:04:00] let me bring this to proper balance
[2:04:05] we need mothers in Israel
[2:04:08] you don't have to be old to be one
[2:04:11] we need women who'll pray
[2:04:14] we need women who won't wait on somebody
[2:04:16] to tell them how to pray they'll let the
[2:04:19] Holy Spirit tell them how to pray
[2:04:21] they'll call on the Lord if this church
[2:04:23] is ever going to be what God has called
[2:04:25] us to be in the last days with a Pulpit
[2:04:28] to the Nations we're going to need every
[2:04:31] faithful fiercely faithful anointed
[2:04:34] woman of God regardless of your age to
[2:04:37] raise up and receive the commission of
[2:04:39] Prayer
[2:04:42] it'll take every one of you doing
[2:04:44] everything you can to help pray the
[2:04:47] promises of God into reality in this
[2:04:49] hour
[2:04:51] but here's the brutal truth
[2:04:55] you can have a church full of mothers in
[2:04:57] Israel
[2:04:58] praying on the prayer Watch
[2:05:00] and it will not carry the authority
[2:05:06] of one man of God
[2:05:12] somebody said I wished you hadn't said
[2:05:14] that I wished I didn't have to say that
[2:05:15] but it's not my order it's Bible order
[2:05:21] if somebody said does that devalue women
[2:05:23] if you took it that way you miss my
[2:05:25] heart
[2:05:27] I am very quick to tell you we are not
[2:05:29] here today because of men
[2:05:32] we are still here today because of women
[2:05:35] who have prayed who have sacrificed
[2:05:39] fasted for my life when I was so sick
[2:05:42] until their hair fell out by the handful
[2:05:44] fasting for me it was many many many
[2:05:46] sisters together holding on pushing
[2:05:50] through
[2:05:51] listen coming to church
[2:05:54] when their husbands stayed at home
[2:05:59] so yes I see the value that's what I'm
[2:06:02] here to preach about
[2:06:04] but one man
[2:06:08] you let one man surrender
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:12] so here's how we handle the truth that
[2:06:15] I've just told you here's what you
[2:06:17] sisters need to be praying for
[2:06:20] you need to pray for the men of God
[2:06:23] to rise up in this hour
[2:06:25] come on now
[2:06:35] by saying Lord we need man to raise up
[2:06:40] with Integrity in this hour
[2:06:44] we need men who will fiercely fight for
[2:06:48] their children in this hour
[2:06:54] I said to my grandmother
[2:06:58] you remember all those places that we
[2:07:00] went
[2:07:01] looking for the spirit and power of
[2:07:04] Elijah
[2:07:08] I found him
[2:07:10] I found the one that we were looking for
[2:07:14] she said his name wouldn't happen to be
[2:07:15] William Branham would he said of course
[2:07:18] it is
[2:07:19] how did you know and she'd give me the
[2:07:22] testimony if you heard the second
[2:07:23] podcast
[2:07:25] you heard me giving the testimony of how
[2:07:27] she came to hear and how she was
[2:07:30] confused by the gift that she saw
[2:07:32] operating so rather than to speak one
[2:07:34] word against it
[2:07:36] she put it away until the right hour
[2:07:39] and I said to my granny who had
[2:07:41] ministered
[2:07:43] since 1950
[2:07:47] and I said if that if that is the Elijah
[2:07:49] Prophet if that is a prophet that has
[2:07:52] the spirit and power of Elijah when he
[2:07:55] said thus saith the Lord and we take
[2:07:57] that back to the word and it lines up
[2:07:59] we're going to have to do what he said
[2:08:01] big mama wouldn't you say so she said
[2:08:05] yes honey
[2:08:06] we're going to have to do what he said
[2:08:07] and I said big mama brother Branham said
[2:08:10] according to the word women don't Pastor
[2:08:12] churches and they Don't Preach to men
[2:08:14] folks
[2:08:18] nobody loved their granny any more than
[2:08:20] I loved mine
[2:08:21] nobody respected their grandmother any
[2:08:24] more than I respected mine and feared
[2:08:26] her to a certain extent
[2:08:28] and I had had this discussion with her
[2:08:31] many times before but when that
[2:08:33] inspiration struck her heart of what I
[2:08:36] said
[2:08:36] all the years of arguing with me
[2:08:40] ain't no man I can tell you I can sound
[2:08:42] like her if you want me to ain't no man
[2:08:45] gonna tell me that God didn't call me
[2:08:49] but not this time
[2:08:54] she had a rough life
[2:08:59] my grandfather was a was a womanizer
[2:09:03] and when I was born he was living in the
[2:09:06] valley with another woman
[2:09:10] and in my files
[2:09:12] he was the supervisor at the Mill
[2:09:14] in Columbus where the where you girls
[2:09:17] have had your wedding
[2:09:19] receptions
[2:09:21] he was a supervisor in that meal
[2:09:24] and he was driving every day
[2:09:27] to the valley to live with a woman and
[2:09:30] drive him from the valley all the way to
[2:09:31] work
[2:09:32] and on occasion stopping by my
[2:09:34] grandmother's home where the family was
[2:09:36] and getting more clean clothes
[2:09:39] now I had an aunt married to my
[2:09:43] grandfather's brother who washed his
[2:09:45] clothes and packed his suitcase every
[2:09:46] weekend for him to go live with a woman
[2:09:49] but my granny said I'm drawing the line
[2:09:53] he said I I'm going to respect you and
[2:09:56] honor you you've always got a place at
[2:09:59] this table you've always got a bed here
[2:10:01] you're my husband I'm going to honor you
[2:10:04] but I am not going to wash your clothes
[2:10:06] to go sleep with somebody else on the
[2:10:08] weekend so she said you let her you let
[2:10:10] honey he called her honey
[2:10:13] you let honey wash your clothes
[2:10:17] I have the letter back there I'm not
[2:10:19] through I know where I am I have the
[2:10:22] letter back there that my mother wrote
[2:10:23] to my grandfather and said Mr Ralph
[2:10:26] you've got to meet your grandson
[2:10:33] he looks just like the shellies
[2:10:36] you've got to see him
[2:10:39] I know you're choosing another life
[2:10:41] right now but you've got a place in our
[2:10:43] lives and we miss you and we need you
[2:10:45] and we want you to come home and we want
[2:10:48] you to forget about that woman
[2:10:51] and come home to your wife into your
[2:10:54] children and your grandson
[2:10:57] and all the begging that had gone on for
[2:10:59] months and months and months didn't do
[2:11:01] any good but when that letter arrived in
[2:11:03] the valley
[2:11:04] he kept it
[2:11:06] and my and when he come home he brought
[2:11:09] it and handed it to my grandmother and
[2:11:10] she kept it and gave it to me when I was
[2:11:13] grown
[2:11:16] I'm telling you God knew what he was
[2:11:18] doing
[2:11:20] so she had a rough life
[2:11:23] she in that in that time period she
[2:11:25] would get had to get in an automobile
[2:11:27] she was pastoring a church before just
[2:11:30] before that in uh Blue Springs Alabama
[2:11:35] about 70 miles from here
[2:11:37] she herself was working in the cotton
[2:11:40] mill
[2:11:41] and was driving all the way down there
[2:11:43] to Pastor a church
[2:11:44] and all the way home and in him up in
[2:11:46] the valley living with a woman it was
[2:11:48] hard
[2:11:49] things were hard but she fought and if
[2:11:51] anybody'd say to her why don't you just
[2:11:53] quit
[2:11:55] she'd say you didn't call me man didn't
[2:11:57] call me God called me I'm going to serve
[2:12:00] him I'm going to do everything I can for
[2:12:01] him all the days of my life I was I was
[2:12:04] ready to get the whole story that day
[2:12:06] again
[2:12:07] I could have just said wait a minute
[2:12:09] granny I know what you're going to say
[2:12:10] but I'm glad I didn't
[2:12:12] because this time I said
[2:12:14] if that was the prophet with the spirit
[2:12:16] and power of Elijah we're going to have
[2:12:17] to do what he said to be right with God
[2:12:19] she said that's right
[2:12:21] then I told her what he said she hung
[2:12:24] her head and she said well
[2:12:27] and I thought she was getting a breath
[2:12:32] to blast me out of the living room
[2:12:35] she said well you mean to tell me
[2:12:37] I've done that all these years
[2:12:40] and it wasn't even my responsibility
[2:12:43] I said that's exactly right granny God
[2:12:47] honored everything you did in his name
[2:12:50] and he will reward you for your
[2:12:53] faithfulness to what you thought was the
[2:12:55] right thing but it was not your
[2:12:59] responsibility
[2:13:01] and she looked at me and said then I'll
[2:13:02] never do it again
[2:13:06] how could she do
[2:13:09] because her heart was right
[2:13:12] her Doctrine was wrong but her heart was
[2:13:16] right and when truth struck it's that
[2:13:19] inspiration struck her and she said then
[2:13:22] that is not my responsibility
[2:13:25] I want you to know something it's not
[2:13:28] your responsibility as a sister to fill
[2:13:30] this Pulpit but it is your
[2:13:32] responsibility to share this life
[2:13:35] share it wherever you go
[2:13:37] even even those of you I don't want to
[2:13:40] call names
[2:13:42] but I will
[2:13:44] sister Alfreda
[2:13:47] never married
[2:13:50] never had children of her own
[2:13:52] but has raised many
[2:13:57] I couldn't say and salute her but you
[2:13:59] see she has on a corsage this morning
[2:14:02] because somebody honors
[2:14:05] somebody sees
[2:14:07] that you don't have to be a biological
[2:14:09] mother to be a mother in Israel hello
[2:14:13] hello
[2:14:14] and you don't have to be a man to be the
[2:14:17] witness of the truth that God has made
[2:14:19] real to you you don't have to do it by
[2:14:22] handling the word all you have to do is
[2:14:24] say come see a man
[2:14:26] who told me everything that I'd ever
[2:14:28] done
[2:14:29] change my life my life and love me and
[2:14:32] my sin come on
[2:14:34] how many of you are glad
[2:14:36] that there's a place
[2:14:39] there's a place
[2:14:42] I've got to hurry I'm worn out and I
[2:14:44] hadn't even preached
[2:14:46] the Widow of Zarephath
[2:14:48] she was fiercely faithful and anointed
[2:14:52] she was Scavenging to make a fire for
[2:14:54] her dying son this starving woman
[2:14:57] encounters a stranger who appeared as
[2:15:00] though he hadn't missed a meal
[2:15:04] I don't think the prophet looked
[2:15:05] emaciated
[2:15:07] I think he was getting all the biscuits
[2:15:10] that had been handed to him
[2:15:13] but times were rough now
[2:15:16] and he was looking for something
[2:15:18] he needed to be sustained
[2:15:21] and his Supernatural meal had run out
[2:15:25] and God said go up to Zarephath or I've
[2:15:27] commanded a woman there to sustain you
[2:15:30] it wasn't so much that the prophet
[2:15:31] needed another meal
[2:15:33] it's that the woman was going to need
[2:15:35] another meal and so was her son so she's
[2:15:39] Scavenging around trying to make a fire
[2:15:40] for her dying son a starving woman
[2:15:43] encounters a prophet who asked her for
[2:15:46] food
[2:15:48] and although there is none despair she
[2:15:50] wants to give her son the attention and
[2:15:52] food he deserves
[2:15:54] she somehow finds resources
[2:15:57] to make a meal
[2:15:59] you know how the story goes I don't want
[2:16:01] to take the time to read it
[2:16:03] but you know how the story goes
[2:16:06] go on now and dress the meal
[2:16:10] make a cake
[2:16:13] she starts to walk away
[2:16:16] I'm just going to make this little meal
[2:16:18] and my son and I are going to eat and
[2:16:19] die
[2:16:20] we'll go right ahead and go make a
[2:16:22] little meal
[2:16:23] and As She's Walking Away what does he
[2:16:25] say
[2:16:27] just make me a little cake first
[2:16:31] the audacity
[2:16:33] the nerve can you imagine
[2:16:35] the woman has just told the prophet
[2:16:37] we're going to eat a little meal and die
[2:16:40] cause there is no more food
[2:16:42] and the preacher barely says he's sorry
[2:16:44] for you know he just kind of nods his
[2:16:45] head make me a little cake first
[2:16:48] you know everybody feels like preachers
[2:16:51] are fat and mostly lazy
[2:16:53] that must have been the thought in the
[2:16:55] day
[2:16:58] nevertheless
[2:17:00] she has very little to lose
[2:17:04] and most everything to gain
[2:17:09] she's fiercely faithful
[2:17:11] and she must have been anointed
[2:17:14] I want to read paragraph 35.
[2:17:17] through 41 in the reaction to an action
[2:17:21] Chicago Ohio read along with me in your
[2:17:24] mind and it was just a little bit just a
[2:17:26] little bit but it was all she needed
[2:17:29] God let this sink deep in the people's
[2:17:31] heart you may be down to your last
[2:17:33] handful
[2:17:34] I've heard people say I don't have much
[2:17:36] faith brother Branham
[2:17:40] I've also heard people say my faith is
[2:17:43] almost exhausted
[2:17:46] but what you've got if it's real faith
[2:17:50] here's how to get it to do something
[2:17:52] you take that little bit of faith that
[2:17:54] you've got left and you mix it with
[2:17:56] God's word hello
[2:18:02] I haven't mentioned it from the pulpit
[2:18:04] here I was going to the Sunday that it
[2:18:07] was announced because
[2:18:08] we've we felt so blessed that
[2:18:13] sister Heather and brother Dwayne
[2:18:14] Jackson called our house
[2:18:17] got on the phone last week
[2:18:20] wanted to tell us
[2:18:22] on the speakerphone
[2:18:25] we celebrated with them over the birth
[2:18:27] of Liam
[2:18:30] they had tried before
[2:18:32] couldn't have children
[2:18:34] they went for treatments and it failed
[2:18:38] and were unable to have children
[2:18:41] someone stepped forward and although
[2:18:43] there were many things against them
[2:18:46] someone stepped forward and said they
[2:18:48] would be willing to help pay
[2:18:50] or them to try again
[2:18:53] I'm sure there was fear in their hearts
[2:18:56] but they stepped out in faith
[2:18:58] we were so blessed to get reports all
[2:19:01] along the way
[2:19:03] I remember hearing that they that the
[2:19:06] eggs were viable
[2:19:08] hearing that they were fertilized and
[2:19:11] viable
[2:19:12] I remember getting the report how many
[2:19:14] male and how many female eggs were still
[2:19:16] viable
[2:19:19] they kept us updated all all along the
[2:19:22] way
[2:19:24] but because they had tried before and
[2:19:27] things had failed
[2:19:29] that heaviness still hangs in the air
[2:19:32] and she must have felt it the entire
[2:19:34] time that she was pregnant that battle
[2:19:35] between faith and
[2:19:38] a little fear come on
[2:19:41] God bless them
[2:19:44] I I'll still remember the day
[2:19:47] I remember getting the good news I
[2:19:50] remember him standing here and holding
[2:19:51] little baby Liam
[2:19:53] this church just worshiping with them
[2:19:56] and rejoicing with them and celebrating
[2:19:59] with them
[2:20:00] believing that they had exhausted now
[2:20:02] their only hope of having a child of
[2:20:04] their own after adopting two children
[2:20:09] and then the Call Comes
[2:20:11] last week
[2:20:13] before last now I guess
[2:20:17] are you sitting down
[2:20:21] said to Sister State brother Steve in
[2:20:23] the room could we get on here together
[2:20:26] they want to know if the kids were there
[2:20:27] they were not
[2:20:31] well I've been to the doctor today
[2:20:34] and I'm expecting a baby
[2:20:38] now the first time was a miracle
[2:20:42] a miracle that they were able to carry
[2:20:44] that she was able to carry it a miracle
[2:20:46] that all the you ought to know the hoops
[2:20:50] shots every day
[2:20:52] the routine that you have to go through
[2:20:54] to try to help your body stay in the in
[2:20:57] the in the right place to carry it it's
[2:20:59] a miracle man couldn't get the credit
[2:21:01] for that we could only give the credit
[2:21:03] to God
[2:21:05] and we did and people celebrated nobody
[2:21:08] nobody said well you know
[2:21:12] you know nobody said that they all thank
[2:21:14] you Lord you have been so faithful to
[2:21:16] them every preacher in the country took
[2:21:19] credit for praying the prayer
[2:21:22] and they let them all think
[2:21:24] they did that's the way they are they
[2:21:26] LED every one of us
[2:21:29] celebrate our little part
[2:21:33] she had it all memorized they had it all
[2:21:35] memorized you remember that service when
[2:21:37] you said so and so remember when brother
[2:21:40] so-and-so prayed remember when they
[2:21:42] looked at me and said such and they had
[2:21:44] it all memorized
[2:21:46] but they were not really expecting
[2:21:50] her words were it was a surprise
[2:21:54] not really sure how it happened
[2:22:00] I made a joke
[2:22:05] but now we're expecting a baby
[2:22:11] I remember Brent and Trish
[2:22:15] hesbrick
[2:22:17] how bad they wanted to have a little
[2:22:19] child
[2:22:21] and how they were believing God and how
[2:22:23] they were prayed for and how we had an
[2:22:25] opportunity to pray
[2:22:29] and I remember
[2:22:30] [Music]
[2:22:31] the attitude
[2:22:34] that sister Trish had and the attitude
[2:22:37] that
[2:22:39] Heather sister Heather had toward all
[2:22:42] these other mothers
[2:22:43] all these other friends of theirs who
[2:22:46] were getting pregnant and having babies
[2:22:47] it's so easy to let that build up in
[2:22:50] your heart
[2:22:52] in the grief
[2:22:54] and and the and the and and all that
[2:22:57] goes on I'm not a woman I I can only
[2:23:00] imagine in my mind
[2:23:02] what that would feel like
[2:23:04] but here's what impressed me with those
[2:23:07] women
[2:23:08] and I've seen it in this room
[2:23:10] I've seen this kind of an attitude in
[2:23:12] this church
[2:23:15] you don't withdraw
[2:23:18] and you don't get this thing God don't
[2:23:20] love me like he loves everybody else
[2:23:22] if you let that build up in your heart
[2:23:24] you'll never have a promise fulfilled in
[2:23:26] your life
[2:23:27] no no no no no no no no no no you be the
[2:23:30] first to buy the blanket
[2:23:34] many times have I
[2:23:39] am I going to have to buy
[2:23:40] I don't know how many births you're
[2:23:42] going to have to celebrate but here is
[2:23:44] one thing I know God is
[2:23:48] faithful
[2:23:50] to his word
[2:23:55] so here's what I would do because I
[2:23:58] wanted to address
[2:24:01] every situation
[2:24:05] I know that there are women who have
[2:24:08] grieved the loss
[2:24:11] of miscarriages
[2:24:14] I know there are those who are not
[2:24:17] natural mothers but mothers in Zion
[2:24:21] I know there are those today who have
[2:24:23] adopted children
[2:24:25] I know there are those who have lost
[2:24:27] their mother and so mothers they can't
[2:24:29] be quite as bright as it used to be
[2:24:33] I know there are also some of you who
[2:24:35] have to look really hard
[2:24:38] to find something
[2:24:40] to honor in your mother
[2:24:43] because your life wasn't
[2:24:45] just like the one sitting next to you
[2:24:48] that's reality may not be your reality
[2:24:52] but it's somebody's reality
[2:24:54] I wanted to think about all the women
[2:24:56] who wanted to be mothers and have not
[2:24:59] yet had that opportunity
[2:25:02] and I also wanted to honor all the mama
[2:25:04] bears that are men
[2:25:11] because not only can women be
[2:25:13] passionately fear fearlessly aggressive
[2:25:17] in guarding and protecting their cubs
[2:25:23] sometimes daddies have to be the same
[2:25:26] way hello
[2:25:29] so I wanted to leave the service today
[2:25:31] having mentioned all as many as I could
[2:25:35] think of
[2:25:36] the different things that might be
[2:25:38] running through a woman's mind in a
[2:25:41] service like this
[2:25:43] we once had a mother in our church in
[2:25:46] Columbus
[2:25:47] who was so grieving for him for a
[2:25:50] miscarriage that she wanted us to move
[2:25:53] the bathroom
[2:25:55] so that she didn't have to pass through
[2:25:57] the the nursery to get to the bathroom
[2:26:00] in the church in Columbus and I had to
[2:26:02] say to her and all the love I could
[2:26:03] muster as a young boy
[2:26:06] young Pastor it would be easier for me
[2:26:09] to pray the Lord's healing on your hurt
[2:26:12] and deliverance
[2:26:15] that you obviously need to carry
[2:26:18] than it would be to move the plumbing
[2:26:20] so come here let me pray for you that's
[2:26:22] how she got her help
[2:26:25] so I wanted to be mindful of all the
[2:26:28] different categories and thought
[2:26:31] but I also wanted to remember
[2:26:35] there was this woman here
[2:26:39] who had a child a healthy child
[2:26:43] and could no longer provide for this
[2:26:45] child
[2:26:46] and things were about to get very very
[2:26:48] bleak
[2:26:53] heard the word of the Lord
[2:26:56] and she did something about it
[2:26:59] so this is where I would like to offer
[2:27:01] my advice to anyone hearing this
[2:27:05] sermon
[2:27:07] who desires to be a mother and has not
[2:27:09] yet had the blessing to do that here's
[2:27:12] two things I would like to recommend if
[2:27:14] you have never heard them
[2:27:17] I recommend you doing what these sisters
[2:27:19] have done that I just mentioned that you
[2:27:21] celebrate every baby born to every
[2:27:25] friend that's in your life you celebrate
[2:27:28] if it's painful and it is
[2:27:31] do it anyway because God sees that heart
[2:27:37] that is the heart of a mother
[2:27:41] when there was famine and two women
[2:27:44] argued about whether or not this baby
[2:27:48] was theirs
[2:27:50] one mother said slice him in half
[2:27:56] you take your half I'll take a half
[2:28:01] and the other woman spoke up and said no
[2:28:03] no no no no you raise him
[2:28:06] he's yours Solomon didn't even have to
[2:28:09] be a wise man
[2:28:11] it was most obvious who carried the
[2:28:14] heart of a mother
[2:28:16] the one who said I'd Rather somebody
[2:28:18] else raise my child
[2:28:21] then for me to see his death hello
[2:28:24] so by celebrating the miracle
[2:28:27] in everybody else's life you are
[2:28:30] demonstrating and you should be
[2:28:31] celebrated for such
[2:28:34] you are celebrating the blessing of God
[2:28:37] in somebody else's life and
[2:28:39] demonstrating the heart of a true mother
[2:28:42] and I have another piece of advice
[2:28:48] if you're blessed enough
[2:28:51] to be anywhere near a prophet
[2:28:55] and you think he's thirsty
[2:29:00] you be the first
[2:29:05] put a cup of water in his hand
[2:29:10] we are without a word prophet in our day
[2:29:14] we couldn't get to brother Branham
[2:29:18] but there are five full prophets in the
[2:29:20] land
[2:29:22] and I would never want that Prophet to
[2:29:24] be thirsty
[2:29:27] if I had an opportunity to do something
[2:29:29] for that man
[2:29:31] I would do it and I would do it not unto
[2:29:34] him but unto the Lord
[2:29:37] and I believe those two things according
[2:29:40] to the scripture unlock a blessing
[2:29:43] you showing the True Heart of a mother
[2:29:45] guess what Solomon said oh no no no no
[2:29:47] no
[2:29:49] no we're not cutting him up
[2:29:51] we're going to give him
[2:29:53] to you
[2:29:55] I know who the real mother is that
[2:29:57] wasn't a gift particularly
[2:29:59] that was a very obvious demonstration of
[2:30:01] a mother's heart you let that be a part
[2:30:03] of who you are and see if God won't
[2:30:05] bless he will
[2:30:07] he will
[2:30:08] he will keep his word if you believe
[2:30:11] that same man not in my timing in his
[2:30:14] timing so you just keep holding on hold
[2:30:16] on
[2:30:18] because real mothers minister to others
[2:30:23] even in the midst of desperate
[2:30:26] circumstances
[2:30:27] here's what the woman of Zarephath did
[2:30:29] she made a cake let me read it I I I'm
[2:30:33] off
[2:30:34] out of order here a little bit
[2:30:36] so let me read it
[2:30:41] but what you've got it's if it's real
[2:30:43] Faith mix it with God's word look what
[2:30:45] it'll do
[2:30:49] you say well
[2:30:51] let me go on next next paragraph now
[2:30:54] get ready
[2:30:55] she stirred it up together
[2:30:58] that's the only thing between her and
[2:31:00] death
[2:31:04] that may be the only thing left for you
[2:31:06] tonight
[2:31:09] between you and death is what little
[2:31:11] spirit that you can muster up in your
[2:31:13] heart to believe it
[2:31:15] mix it
[2:31:19] you're hearing him
[2:31:21] my faith is almost gone
[2:31:25] I'm going to make my little meal and
[2:31:27] we're going to eat it and die
[2:31:29] mix it with God's Eternal Word
[2:31:33] when she did I can see her pull the
[2:31:36] little racket curtain back and look in
[2:31:39] the little boy's holding his little
[2:31:40] stomach mother mother are you ready to
[2:31:43] cook that little cake
[2:31:45] said Yes dear just wait a few minutes
[2:31:47] mother's mixing it up
[2:31:50] mother break it in two and you take half
[2:31:53] of it oh honey we'll take care of that
[2:31:56] what was it now the word
[2:31:59] the meal
[2:32:01] and the oil
[2:32:03] the spirit the oil mixed together
[2:32:08] she went out into the yard to get did
[2:32:11] you notice scripture says two sticks the
[2:32:13] cross
[2:32:15] always good hundreds or woodsmen know
[2:32:17] that the way to keep a fire burning is
[2:32:19] lighted in the middle two logs laid
[2:32:21] across and lighted all through the night
[2:32:24] you can keep pushing the ends as it
[2:32:26] burns and right in the center of the
[2:32:27] Cross is where the sacrifice of God hung
[2:32:30] she went into the yard she picked up two
[2:32:33] sticks she looked up the hot blistering
[2:32:34] winds not a leaf on the tree no grass in
[2:32:37] the yard where the old tree Once stood
[2:32:39] just two sticks left she picked them up
[2:32:41] to go in to make it
[2:32:43] it was famine
[2:32:45] what is it when self-sacrifice when you
[2:32:49] have mixed the word with the spirit or
[2:32:51] the spirit with the word and then ready
[2:32:53] to sacrifice yourself at the cross and
[2:32:56] you're ready to say whether I live or
[2:32:58] die is anybody listening
[2:33:01] whether I live or die Lord I've done
[2:33:03] everything I know how to do and I'm
[2:33:05] coming at the peak of Mercy
[2:33:08] sacrifice my own believing I'll not
[2:33:10] think of it anymore I'll not reason it
[2:33:12] anymore I'm casting off reasonings I'll
[2:33:15] just believe it Lord because it's your
[2:33:18] meal and oil your spirit your word your
[2:33:21] truth I'm throwing myself as a sacrifice
[2:33:24] on the cross that's what it was speaking
[2:33:26] of she picked up the two sticks to go in
[2:33:30] for the sacrifice
[2:33:34] when all this is completed
[2:33:36] God's a very present help in the time of
[2:33:39] trouble they that wait upon the Lord
[2:33:40] shall renew their strength they shall
[2:33:42] Mount up with wings like an eagle
[2:33:43] they'll run and not be weary they'll
[2:33:45] walk and not faint teach me Lord teach
[2:33:47] me Lord how to wait
[2:33:49] they that wait don't be weary
[2:33:52] is anybody with me
[2:33:55] if you've got the word and the spirit
[2:33:57] sacrifice your own belief laid it on the
[2:34:00] cross
[2:34:01] read it
[2:34:04] started walking back at about that time
[2:34:06] she heard a voice and as she turned to
[2:34:08] look there was kind of a look oh she
[2:34:10] said would you fetch me just a little
[2:34:12] drink of water maybe on her lip she was
[2:34:14] ready to say I'm both ends of the line
[2:34:16] God had showed Elijah Vision go down in
[2:34:18] the city for I've commanded not the
[2:34:20] Ravens this time to feed you but I've
[2:34:22] commanded a widow woman to sustain you
[2:34:23] and took him to the poorest of the
[2:34:25] Poor's I've commanded a widow woman to
[2:34:28] sustain you and she didn't even have
[2:34:29] enough meal in the barrel for her and
[2:34:30] her son to live that day but I've
[2:34:33] commanded I've ordained it blessed be
[2:34:35] the name of the Lord when God ordains
[2:34:37] anything it's got to happen it'll be
[2:34:39] there God will meet it
[2:34:42] hello God will meet it
[2:34:47] what is an amen
[2:34:50] it's the power of agreement
[2:34:53] I'm agreeing with that word
[2:34:56] when God ordains anything it's got to
[2:34:58] happen it'll be there God will meet it
[2:34:59] I've commanded a winner there to take
[2:35:01] care of you to sustain you he gave him a
[2:35:04] vision I can see him walking down the
[2:35:06] street the Lord must have told him
[2:35:07] there'd be an old woman looking old
[2:35:09] she's young
[2:35:10] her shoulder stooped
[2:35:12] her shoulders ragged her arms are out of
[2:35:14] her sleeve she'd be out in the yard with
[2:35:16] two sticks in her hand and Elijah you
[2:35:18] know what that means
[2:35:20] we'll be in about 800 years from now
[2:35:22] what will be in about 800 years from now
[2:35:24] and as he walked he seen the woman he
[2:35:26] leaned over the little fence and said
[2:35:27] fetch me a little drink of water she
[2:35:29] turned to say something and she thought
[2:35:31] that's a kind old man he speaks a little
[2:35:32] different from the ordinary man
[2:35:34] there's something about God's children
[2:35:36] that they know one another something
[2:35:38] that's always been they know one another
[2:35:40] my sheep know my voice said Jesus then
[2:35:42] she looked and she heard she looked at
[2:35:45] him she said there must be something
[2:35:46] Godly about that old man
[2:35:48] said fetch me a little drink of water
[2:35:50] she nodded her head she would do it as
[2:35:52] she started to go away what
[2:35:55] she heard the voice again and bring me
[2:35:57] in your hand a little cake for me to eat
[2:35:58] a morsel of bread
[2:36:00] and she said I have just enough for me
[2:36:03] and my little starving boy and I'm out
[2:36:05] here Gathering these two sticks I've
[2:36:06] just mixed together dressed it and now
[2:36:08] I've got two sticks to make a fire to
[2:36:10] make a cake and he and I will eat it and
[2:36:12] die nothing could sound more hopeless
[2:36:14] than that
[2:36:16] be more desperate than that
[2:36:18] than exaggerating there were
[2:36:20] there were lamps there Washington
[2:36:22] government assistance this was her last
[2:36:24] meal
[2:36:28] then she heard she started to turn again
[2:36:30] but bring me one first
[2:36:34] what do we learn here this is a lesson
[2:36:37] seek ye first are you good for a few
[2:36:39] more minutes
[2:36:40] seek you first
[2:36:42] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[2:36:45] read it
[2:36:47] all these other things come on
[2:36:52] but bring me one
[2:36:56] first
[2:36:57] look she didn't have to go down and get
[2:36:59] her last penny
[2:37:01] she had to go down and get her last
[2:37:02] piece of bread
[2:37:04] she didn't have to go for this or that
[2:37:05] or maybe change doctors or some little
[2:37:07] insignificant thing she had to go to the
[2:37:09] only thing that stood between her and
[2:37:11] death and her child
[2:37:12] bring me a little cake first in your
[2:37:14] hand I can see her not her head obedient
[2:37:17] that's what God requires folks here's
[2:37:21] the key
[2:37:22] here's the key
[2:37:25] no no no she could have said I'm going
[2:37:28] to eat my little bit my son's going to
[2:37:29] eat his little bit you eat whatever's
[2:37:31] left
[2:37:34] I'm obligated as a mother to my son
[2:37:37] first hello
[2:37:39] there's a lot of things she could have
[2:37:41] said
[2:37:42] when God's Prophet says a certain thing
[2:37:44] do it hold on to it she bowed her head
[2:37:46] yes sir
[2:37:48] she starts on then she heard the Swedish
[2:37:51] thing she'd ever heard that
[2:37:54] all-sufficient word that all of us
[2:37:56] listen for for their come across that
[2:37:59] gate a blast from that prophet's voice
[2:38:03] say it
[2:38:07] for thus
[2:38:08] saith
[2:38:10] the Lord
[2:38:13] amen
[2:38:14] that's what we look to hear thus
[2:38:17] saith the Lord
[2:38:20] the barrel will not go empty or the
[2:38:22] crews fail until the day that God sends
[2:38:24] rain on the earth there it was
[2:38:28] amen
[2:38:29] settled it
[2:38:31] I'm not going to argue with you over how
[2:38:33] God did it
[2:38:34] but I know how I think he did it
[2:38:37] I don't believe that she went to that
[2:38:39] meal Barrel the next time and found it
[2:38:41] full
[2:38:43] I don't believe she went to the cruise
[2:38:45] of oil the next time and found it full I
[2:38:48] believe that every time she went to the
[2:38:51] barrel there was just enough meal
[2:38:55] to make a cake however many cakes were
[2:38:58] necessary just enough oil to make
[2:39:02] however many cakes were necessary and
[2:39:05] then it looked like there was no more
[2:39:07] but she never had to worry again because
[2:39:10] God said it'll never be empty again so
[2:39:13] the next time she go she didn't have to
[2:39:14] be I wonder how many times she peeked
[2:39:17] probably a time or two she was human now
[2:39:19] well it's there
[2:39:22] how many of you believe after a while
[2:39:23] she didn't have to peek anymore
[2:39:27] it's not that she was a mother that
[2:39:29] makes her so great that was great but it
[2:39:32] said she was fiercely faithful and
[2:39:35] anointed and obedient as a woman of God
[2:39:39] and look how things changed
[2:39:44] then there was a syrophoenician woman
[2:39:49] I don't have time
[2:39:51] like I said I couldn't get nothing
[2:39:53] and then I got it all at one time
[2:39:57] real mothers are courageous and letting
[2:40:00] their children step confidently into
[2:40:01] their future
[2:40:03] I'm going to skip reading all the verses
[2:40:05] and I'm going to read the message
[2:40:06] desperations Hannah
[2:40:08] paragraph 98 Hannah you still with me
[2:40:11] Han I know you want to celebrate with
[2:40:13] your mother you can in a minute or two
[2:40:15] Hannah
[2:40:16] a barren woman in the Bible she wanted a
[2:40:19] son she got the fasting for him
[2:40:22] and she fasted and prayed until even the
[2:40:25] priest at the temple thought she was
[2:40:27] drunk
[2:40:28] she was in such desperation
[2:40:32] the Bible said she had cried out until
[2:40:35] her lips
[2:40:37] were moving trembling but no words were
[2:40:40] coming out
[2:40:41] she had prayed herself into a place of
[2:40:44] intercession
[2:40:46] where her lips were stammering
[2:40:50] she had stammering lips
[2:40:52] and even the priest of the most high God
[2:40:54] didn't know what was going on isn't that
[2:40:57] about how it is today
[2:41:00] some little sister in the church get
[2:41:02] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[2:41:03] and the first thing they think is a
[2:41:05] strange Spirit has got on her instead of
[2:41:08] thinking maybe the Holy Ghost is doing
[2:41:10] for her what he did for Hannah isn't
[2:41:12] that a sad shame What a Sad reality that
[2:41:15] it's easier for people to believe it's
[2:41:16] the devil
[2:41:17] what's wrong with the church
[2:41:20] than it is to believe it's God she was
[2:41:23] in so much desperation I know I've been
[2:41:25] so long I'm so sorry I'm not usually
[2:41:27] sorry but I'm sorry today I'm sorry I've
[2:41:29] been so long
[2:41:30] with the rest of the women watching what
[2:41:33] kind of a bonnet the other one had War
[2:41:38] that'd be like a sister one of your
[2:41:40] sisters feeling sorry for yourself
[2:41:41] because you didn't have on a corsage
[2:41:43] today and nobody gave you a croissant or
[2:41:46] something you letting that keep you from
[2:41:47] getting something from the Lord
[2:41:49] why that flower don't make you anything
[2:41:53] hello
[2:41:54] the word of the Lord is honoring you
[2:41:56] today
[2:41:58] your family might might look over you
[2:42:00] your family might forget your family
[2:42:01] might not follow that tradition
[2:42:05] don't you let nothing get in your mind
[2:42:07] like that we're talking about fiercely
[2:42:10] faithful and anointed women
[2:42:14] the tradition of my childhood was that
[2:42:16] every mother wore a corsage to church on
[2:42:19] its own Mother's Day as she bought it
[2:42:21] for herself
[2:42:23] that's how I grew up if nobody bought
[2:42:25] her once you bought one for sale she
[2:42:27] knew her husband
[2:42:30] you know your husband by now
[2:42:32] if you particularly wanted one you could
[2:42:34] have got it hello
[2:42:36] always quiet in here now
[2:42:38] I've uncovered so many things
[2:42:45] and let me tell you something a mother
[2:42:47] that's taking care of children she don't
[2:42:48] have no room for that flower anyway
[2:42:52] she's too busy
[2:42:55] juggling around
[2:42:58] when I was a boy not only did mothers
[2:43:00] wear them but every man in the church
[2:43:02] wore them
[2:43:03] every man in the church wore a
[2:43:05] boutonniere not a corsage
[2:43:07] they wore a flower one flower on their
[2:43:11] coat and they did it to honor their
[2:43:13] mother
[2:43:15] that is no longer the tradition
[2:43:18] so what
[2:43:20] don't let something like that get in
[2:43:22] your mind
[2:43:24] the word of God is honoring you now
[2:43:27] the house of the Lord is telling you who
[2:43:29] you are
[2:43:30] hello
[2:43:34] she was in such desperation the rest of
[2:43:36] the women were watching what kind of a
[2:43:37] bonnet the other one wore
[2:43:39] you know how it go let's see who got a
[2:43:41] new dress let's see who didn't get a new
[2:43:44] dress for Mother's Day
[2:43:46] what in the world is such a thing as
[2:43:48] that matter anyway
[2:43:50] wait a minute
[2:43:52] amen amen
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:43:58] my wife hands on a new dress but she's
[2:44:00] had it for two or three months
[2:44:02] you just finally wore it
[2:44:04] it wasn't bought for Mother's Day
[2:44:08] she could have gone to her closet
[2:44:11] and picked one out and it would look new
[2:44:17] because if you've got
[2:44:19] several
[2:44:22] you'll just bring them out and the
[2:44:24] husband brags on them all again like
[2:44:25] he's never seen them before
[2:44:28] hello
[2:44:30] the other one's seeing what kind of
[2:44:32] clothes they had on talking about things
[2:44:34] going on the farm but not Hannah
[2:44:37] she didn't have time to worry about who
[2:44:39] had on a corsage
[2:44:41] she didn't have time to worry about who
[2:44:43] had a Noob on it and if it was the right
[2:44:45] color and if it matched her shoes
[2:44:48] with the rest of the women watching on
[2:44:50] she was desperate
[2:44:54] with the rest of the women watching what
[2:44:56] kind of a bonnet the other one had worse
[2:44:58] you you know how it goes uh other ones
[2:45:00] seeing what kind of talking about the
[2:45:02] things going but not Hannah
[2:45:04] she stepped right through the whole
[2:45:06] crowd
[2:45:08] on her way to the altar somebody ought
[2:45:10] to help me now she'd been fasting she
[2:45:13] wanted her approach taken away what a
[2:45:15] difference it is today it's almost a
[2:45:17] reproach to have a child
[2:45:19] it was her approach in that day
[2:45:21] not to have one we're not living in that
[2:45:24] day
[2:45:27] and she got on her knees
[2:45:29] she never noticed the Dignity of the
[2:45:31] temple she never noticed a dignified
[2:45:33] priest as he walked out she was in such
[2:45:35] distress to her tears were rolling down
[2:45:37] her cheeks you may hear something in
[2:45:40] this I don't hear I do not hear a woman
[2:45:42] feeling sorry for herself
[2:45:46] I don't hear a woe is me attitude here
[2:45:49] I hear one who is desperate to get a
[2:45:52] hold of God's heart
[2:45:55] I hear one who knows what she wants and
[2:45:58] she's willing to get a hold of God
[2:46:01] the only one who can help her to get it
[2:46:03] oh Lord God give me a son
[2:46:10] maybe we ought to try praying that
[2:46:15] well we know we're going to love it
[2:46:19] boy or girl
[2:46:24] but Hannah had something in mind
[2:46:29] give me one who will serve the Lord
[2:46:33] give me a boy so that he can serve God
[2:46:36] and Minister unto the Lord and on behalf
[2:46:40] of the Lord this was her desire she
[2:46:42] could have had a girl
[2:46:44] she could have prayed Lord give me a
[2:46:46] baby
[2:46:48] she said Give Me A Sign give me a son
[2:46:52] and notice she wasn't selfish
[2:46:56] when God heard her and answered her
[2:46:58] prayer and gave her a son just look what
[2:47:00] she did
[2:47:03] I know it's late
[2:47:10] I didn't fall
[2:47:12] I thought it was being real calm then
[2:47:16] she gave her son back to God
[2:47:21] and because she was willing not to be
[2:47:24] selfish after God had answered her
[2:47:26] prayer look what he did
[2:47:31] he didn't just give her a son he gave
[2:47:33] her a prophet in Israel
[2:47:35] [Music]
[2:47:38] for so long an open Vision had been
[2:47:40] missing in the land she didn't just get
[2:47:43] a child she got a prophet she didn't
[2:47:47] just get a profit she got a a open eye
[2:47:50] vision Prophet she didn't just get an
[2:47:53] open-out Vision Prophet she got a
[2:47:55] prophet that the Bible said none of his
[2:47:58] words fell to the ground everything he
[2:48:02] prophesied came to pass just like God
[2:48:06] said it I would say that having a son
[2:48:10] like Samuel was worth the wait
[2:48:15] oh what an extra blessing
[2:48:18] he's just full of them those little
[2:48:19] extra things he gives
[2:48:21] let's go on
[2:48:23] not only a son but a prophet and there
[2:48:25] had been no open vision for many many
[2:48:27] years in Israel Samuel the first prophet
[2:48:30] for many years because a mother got
[2:48:31] desperate hello I want you to notice
[2:48:34] this he didn't say because a woman got
[2:48:38] desperate
[2:48:39] man
[2:48:41] her heart
[2:48:43] already testified that she was a mother
[2:48:49] before she gave birth
[2:48:52] and there are women like that
[2:48:56] Sometimes women like that will get their
[2:48:58] feelings hurt
[2:49:00] because we will say things in front of
[2:49:02] them forgetting about the fact
[2:49:06] that they're not a yet a natural mother
[2:49:11] because they carry
[2:49:13] motherhood
[2:49:18] they carry it
[2:49:20] it's a blessing
[2:49:23] it's not the ability to have a baby that
[2:49:27] I'm preaching about
[2:49:28] it's it's more spiritual than that that
[2:49:32] that ability to have a baby it's a
[2:49:33] natural thing I'm talking about
[2:49:34] something spiritual I'm talking about
[2:49:36] somebody who carries the nature of a
[2:49:39] nurturer
[2:49:41] to me there's nothing more Godly nothing
[2:49:44] more Godly than someone who carries the
[2:49:48] heart of a nurturer
[2:49:52] so even before she was a mother in the
[2:49:54] natural she was a mother who believed
[2:49:59] a mother got desperate that she could
[2:50:02] have no children and she was past the
[2:50:04] age of bearing probably 60 70 years old
[2:50:07] I don't know if that is is exactly how
[2:50:09] it was or not but here's how he's
[2:50:11] telling it
[2:50:12] because a couple of times he said she
[2:50:15] was bent over
[2:50:17] and but not that old
[2:50:20] she prayed with desperation
[2:50:24] she must have this child what was it
[2:50:28] God had spoke to her no doubt
[2:50:33] now that's what we need
[2:50:35] we need to hear from the Lord
[2:50:37] you can't be desperate
[2:50:40] till God speaks to you
[2:50:42] so you got to hear him today
[2:50:45] he said well I don't really have a word
[2:50:47] you do
[2:50:49] you're getting it right now if you
[2:50:51] didn't already have a word you've got it
[2:50:53] right now God's promises cannot fail you
[2:50:56] can't be desperate till God speaks to
[2:50:57] you oh Church rise men women children
[2:51:02] rise and Shake Yourself pitch your
[2:51:05] conscience wake yourself up in this hour
[2:51:07] we must be desperate or perish
[2:51:10] listen what he says there and notice
[2:51:12] this is the end of of 63 or or September
[2:51:16] of 63.
[2:51:18] seals have already come he said we must
[2:51:20] be desperate repaired there is coming
[2:51:22] forth something from the Lord I know it
[2:51:25] as thus saith the Lord
[2:51:28] there's coming forth something and we
[2:51:29] better get desperate it's between life
[2:51:31] and death now listen to this part right
[2:51:33] here
[2:51:35] this is what leaves preachers on
[2:51:37] different sides of the aisle just like
[2:51:39] politicians
[2:51:41] they failed to see this it'll pass
[2:51:44] through us
[2:51:46] and we won't see it
[2:51:49] brother Branham speaking about the bear
[2:51:51] vision
[2:51:52] the Silver Tip grisly Vision uses this
[2:51:56] language
[2:51:58] pass through me
[2:52:03] so we know the kind of language he's
[2:52:05] using when he says it'll pass through us
[2:52:08] it means we will miss what God has
[2:52:12] purposed we will miss it
[2:52:16] if we don't get desperate before the
[2:52:19] Lord it'll pass through us
[2:52:22] and we won't see it it doesn't mean it
[2:52:27] won't happen
[2:52:28] it means we won't see it
[2:52:31] hello
[2:52:32] because that she wasn't selfish
[2:52:37] she was given a prophet
[2:52:40] because let's let's get that quote again
[2:52:44] let me give you the word of the Lord
[2:52:47] because she wasn't selfish
[2:52:51] she was given a prophet because
[2:52:56] boys
[2:53:00] because she wasn't selfish
[2:53:04] she was given
[2:53:08] a prophet
[2:53:14] two more mothers
[2:53:21] one
[2:53:23] her name was Mary
[2:53:26] you can read it for yourself in Luke
[2:53:28] chapter 1 26-38 I'm only going to read
[2:53:32] verse 37 and 38.
[2:53:35] Luke 1 37 38.
[2:53:39] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[2:53:43] and Mary said
[2:53:44] behold the handmaid of the Lord
[2:53:50] the angel of the Lord Gabriel has just
[2:53:53] come and told her you're going to have a
[2:53:56] baby without knowing a man
[2:53:59] or she might not have been very smart
[2:54:00] but she biologically knew how things
[2:54:02] worked
[2:54:05] this was impossible
[2:54:08] the prophet of the Old Testament said
[2:54:10] behold God will do a new thing something
[2:54:12] that has never been done before
[2:54:14] a virgin one who had never sexually
[2:54:17] known a man is about to have a baby it
[2:54:21] has never happened that way before how
[2:54:23] did it happen because the Holy Ghost
[2:54:25] overshadowed her
[2:54:27] let me read you this quote and be done
[2:54:29] in a minute
[2:54:31] lean not unto thine own understanding
[2:54:34] 178 the Virgin Mary
[2:54:37] when the angel Gabriel met her and told
[2:54:39] her she was going to have a baby without
[2:54:40] knowing a man phew never been she never
[2:54:43] leaned upon her own understanding
[2:54:46] that a woman couldn't have a baby
[2:54:48] without having a husband
[2:54:49] she didn't lean upon that behold the
[2:54:52] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[2:54:53] according to Thy Word
[2:54:57] I want to say again I know what Eve did
[2:55:00] she did what she was created to do
[2:55:05] she was more obedient than some women
[2:55:07] are today
[2:55:09] I know what Eve did she did what she was
[2:55:12] created to do it did not catch God by
[2:55:15] surprise
[2:55:16] she received another seed
[2:55:20] into her womb
[2:55:22] and paid the price
[2:55:24] and you paid the price but there's
[2:55:27] another woman here
[2:55:29] seriously faithful and anointed of God
[2:55:31] her name is Mary and even though she
[2:55:34] would carry the stigma of a fornicator
[2:55:39] she was willing to let God do in her
[2:55:42] what he desired to do and she laid aside
[2:55:45] her human reasoning and she didn't say
[2:55:49] how am I going to do it and when will I
[2:55:51] do it and how is all this going to take
[2:55:53] place
[2:55:54] but rather she trusted the Lord
[2:55:59] let's go on
[2:56:01] the angel said the Holy Ghost shall
[2:56:04] overshadow thee and that Holy thing will
[2:56:06] be born of thee shall be called The Son
[2:56:08] of God she said behold the handmaid of
[2:56:10] the Lord she didn't take her reasonings
[2:56:12] that it couldn't be done she just said
[2:56:14] behold the handmaid of the Lord real
[2:56:17] mothers sometimes that great personal
[2:56:20] expense
[2:56:21] Say Yes to God
[2:56:23] and because of their yes the world is
[2:56:26] transformed
[2:56:29] be a Mary
[2:56:31] in a world full of Eves
[2:56:33] be a Mary
[2:56:35] and now I'm closing with this
[2:56:44] there came a Time
[2:56:48] that judgment would fall
[2:56:51] on the household of Saul
[2:56:56] and in order for that to happen his sons
[2:56:58] were slain
[2:57:01] even the sons of his concubine whose
[2:57:04] name was risper
[2:57:09] the Bible tells us in second Samuel
[2:57:11] chapter 21
[2:57:15] and I'm going to skip to read the right
[2:57:18] verse
[2:57:23] if I I don't even know if I put the
[2:57:25] right verse here
[2:57:27] just a moment
[2:57:28] yes verse 10
[2:57:31] Samuel 21 10.
[2:57:34] and risk for the daughter of A.I took
[2:57:37] sackcloth
[2:57:39] and spread it for her upon the rock
[2:57:42] from the beginning of harvest until
[2:57:44] water dropped unto them out of heaven
[2:57:47] and suffered neither the birds of the
[2:57:50] air to rest on them by day
[2:57:53] nor the Beast of the field by night
[2:57:57] and it was told David what risk for the
[2:58:00] daughter of AI the concubine of Saul had
[2:58:02] done and David went and took the bones
[2:58:06] of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his
[2:58:08] son from the men of jabesh Gilead which
[2:58:11] had stolen them from the streets of
[2:58:13] betsyon where the Philistines had hanged
[2:58:16] them when the Philistines had slain Saul
[2:58:19] in galboa how many of you remember the
[2:58:21] story
[2:58:24] seven sons of Saul hanging
[2:58:28] on the wall
[2:58:32] two of them the sons of rispah
[2:58:36] not a wife
[2:58:39] concubine
[2:58:41] what we might call today a kept woman
[2:58:44] not a prostitute
[2:58:48] she wasn't a prostitute she was a kept
[2:58:50] woman
[2:58:52] she lived
[2:58:54] in a place where she her needs were met
[2:58:56] and taken care of and she came in unto
[2:58:59] the king and bore him children
[2:59:04] certainly not the way we do things today
[2:59:07] but it was done that way then
[2:59:10] her sons had to die
[2:59:13] it was judgment on the household of Saul
[2:59:18] she knew that they were
[2:59:20] somehow paying a price
[2:59:23] for their own sins and the sins of their
[2:59:25] father and she could not necessarily
[2:59:28] defend them in their lifestyle
[2:59:33] but like any other mother
[2:59:37] she believed that they deserved a decent
[2:59:40] burial
[2:59:41] and she refused to allow the birds of
[2:59:46] the air and the Beast of the field to
[2:59:49] eat her boys
[2:59:53] I love it
[2:59:55] I love response
[2:59:58] there ought to be a little bit of
[2:59:59] respite in every one of us
[3:00:03] they disappoint you
[3:00:07] they don't always do the right thing
[3:00:10] they don't always show you the right
[3:00:12] love and the right respect you can't
[3:00:14] always be proud of their behavior
[3:00:17] sometimes they stray sometimes they get
[3:00:20] on drugs sometimes they swap lives have
[3:00:23] two or three marriages don't take care
[3:00:25] of their children like they should
[3:00:30] that's the reality that some others have
[3:00:32] had to deal with with their children
[3:00:36] but I want you to know it doesn't keep a
[3:00:39] fiercely faithful and anointed woman of
[3:00:43] God
[3:00:44] from doing everything she can to beat
[3:00:49] away every demon power every bird of the
[3:00:53] air every beast of the field that would
[3:00:56] come to devour her seed
[3:00:58] she wasn't just worried about dead
[3:01:00] bodies
[3:01:01] she was fighting for her seed she was
[3:01:04] couldn't been fighting for their life
[3:01:06] their life was over she was fighting for
[3:01:08] their legacy she was fighting for
[3:01:11] something that had been given to her and
[3:01:13] she refused to let what God had given to
[3:01:17] her be treated
[3:01:19] like food for the Bears
[3:01:22] like food for the vultures
[3:01:24] whoo
[3:01:26] so rispa
[3:01:28] she got a stick bigger than she was
[3:01:33] come on
[3:01:34] I preached this all over the world with
[3:01:36] a broom I don't have the energy to use a
[3:01:38] broom today
[3:01:40] but I preach it yeah come on Mama
[3:01:42] come on sister Annie show me how it's
[3:01:45] done
[3:01:46] that's how it's done somebody look at

[3:01:50] exactly how it's done you just make up
[3:01:53] your mind you ain't getting mine you are

[3:02:11] woman here
[3:02:13] somebody on a war
[3:02:15] [Music]
[3:02:16] [Applause]
[3:02:19] I saw April get up her son is sitting
[3:02:22] right here
[3:02:24] she knows she won't always be a little
[3:02:27] boy
[3:02:31] one day he'll be old enough to choose
[3:02:33] the world
[3:02:35] and she better not wait until then
[3:02:39] or get me a broom somebody out of the
[3:02:41] closet in there
[3:02:44] better not wait until they're grown and
[3:02:46] done
[3:02:47] until Satan's had his way with him
[3:02:50] to start beating back the shoot of a
[3:02:52] Hyundai deal of akaya
[3:02:57] Indiana
[3:03:08] I did it for my own mother
[3:03:12] I had to be a risper for my own mother
[3:03:14] when she served hell
[3:03:18] when she was drunk when she did the
[3:03:21] things of the world
[3:03:23] I had to beat back the darkness of hell
[3:03:25] for the Salvation of her soul and would
[3:03:28] do it again today because I loved her
[3:03:31] let me tell you something here's where
[3:03:33] spiritual midwives come in
[3:03:37] here's where a little woman lay down
[3:03:39] there down the hill
[3:03:41] didn't hardly know who she was
[3:03:44] but God was still using her in
[3:03:47] intercession not only for her own girls
[3:03:50] but for somebody else's girls
[3:03:53] that's how elfrida has so many
[3:03:55] visitations from the Lord them there
[3:03:58] below the hill without any natural
[3:04:00] children of Our Own
[3:04:02] she's having to be back the forces of
[3:04:06] hell
[3:04:07] oh shut up
[3:04:11] over somebody else's son
[3:04:14] off of somebody else's door
[3:04:17] off of somebody else's grandchild
[3:04:27] seven
[3:04:30] seven
[3:04:31] fiercely
[3:04:33] faithful and anointed
[3:04:36] women
[3:04:45] so forgive me
[3:04:48] if I don't spend a lot of time reading
[3:04:50] the quotes
[3:04:51] about a woman being the lowest down
[3:04:53] thing
[3:04:58] because I know how the devil takes that
[3:05:02] I was preaching about a fallen woman
[3:05:04] he's talking about a fallen woman
[3:05:08] said I'd rather see my wife
[3:05:10] drunk on the floor
[3:05:13] than to see her with a cigarette in her
[3:05:15] mouth
[3:05:17] that was brother branham's passion
[3:05:19] against that nicotine devil
[3:05:22] it was not his desire to see someone
[3:05:24] drunk
[3:05:26] because an overcomer doesn't drink an
[3:05:29] overcomer doesn't smoke an overcomer
[3:05:32] doesn't play around with pornography
[3:05:34] you're not overcoming you're not
[3:05:36] overcoming you're not overcoming if
[3:05:39] you're being overcome
[3:05:45] somebody said well how drunk do I have
[3:05:47] to get
[3:05:48] to be if you know you've had a problem
[3:05:51] you don't need more than a sip of
[3:05:54] communion wine
[3:05:57] because if you won't guard your life
[3:05:58] who'll guard it who will guard your life
[3:06:00] who will guard for you if you don't
[3:06:02] guard for yourself if you don't fight
[3:06:04] for yourself who will fight for you
[3:06:07] it is not your Children's Place to fight
[3:06:09] that battle I did for my mother because
[3:06:11] I loved her but it wasn't my
[3:06:13] responsibility
[3:06:15] I did it because I loved her you're the
[3:06:17] only one that can fight that thing
[3:06:20] come on come on come on come on come on
[3:06:22] so forgive me if I take a moment once a
[3:06:25] year to say to the women of this church
[3:06:30] I don't know where we would be without
[3:06:32] you
[3:06:35] I don't know where we would be without
[3:06:37] you sisters I don't know where we would
[3:06:39] be
[3:06:40] if you hadn't stood the test
[3:06:43] if you hadn't been faithful Against All
[3:06:45] Odds come on Edith help me
[3:06:47] Edith's helping me
[3:06:51] faithful Against All Odds faithful to
[3:06:54] pray when nobody else would pray
[3:06:56] faithful to push when nobody else would
[3:06:59] bush
[3:07:01] musicians are coming
[3:07:04] we are blessed of God
[3:07:07] we are blessed of God
[3:07:10] to have fiercely faithful
[3:07:13] and anointed women of God
[3:07:16] some of which
[3:07:18] happen to be mothers
[3:07:22] to every woman who has ever lost a baby
[3:07:26] my heart goes out to you
[3:07:29] it's part of your body
[3:07:31] it's part of your life
[3:07:34] it hurts and I hurt for you
[3:07:39] but God never makes a mistake
[3:07:43] for those of you who are still fighting
[3:07:46] and believing
[3:07:47] for a companion
[3:07:50] don't give up
[3:07:52] those of you who are believing for a
[3:07:55] baby don't give up
[3:07:58] keep fighting the good fight of faith
[3:08:03] try asking for a son
[3:08:09] don't give up
[3:08:12] to every woman who
[3:08:15] may have had a mother who was not a real
[3:08:18] example of motherhood thanks be to God
[3:08:21] you made it
[3:08:23] you made it anyhow
[3:08:26] there's one thing I'm sure of about your
[3:08:29] mother
[3:08:30] and I don't know her
[3:08:32] if she loved you to the capacity
[3:08:35] that she was capable of loving you too
[3:08:39] you came from her body
[3:08:41] she could not forget that
[3:08:44] Every Woman
[3:08:46] doesn't have the same capacity
[3:08:51] to love the way people need to be loved
[3:08:54] I'm sorry I'm so sorry
[3:08:58] I know that hurt
[3:09:03] was it Pleasant
[3:09:05] but look at you
[3:09:08] look where you are
[3:09:10] raising your children your grandchildren
[3:09:13] look at you
[3:09:14] you made it through may God bless and
[3:09:17] help the memory of your mother
[3:09:20] for every one of you that have lost your
[3:09:22] mother there's no way no words to
[3:09:25] describe it
[3:09:26] it can sometimes feel like the most
[3:09:28] lonely thing in all the world
[3:09:31] God was so good to me
[3:09:35] shortly after I was married
[3:09:38] my mother had cervical cancer
[3:09:41] I don't even know if you know that
[3:09:44] and she had surgery
[3:09:48] she had no other family but me
[3:09:51] I sat with her in the hospital for her
[3:09:53] surgery
[3:09:55] I went with her to every Cancer
[3:09:57] appointment
[3:10:00] and they believed that they had gotten
[3:10:02] it all
[3:10:03] I remember standing in the shower after
[3:10:06] being married just a short time and
[3:10:08] sobbing like a little baby boy
[3:10:11] and saying to the Lord you have been so
[3:10:14] good to me to give me a beautiful
[3:10:15] wonderful loving wife
[3:10:18] but I just can't lose my mama
[3:10:22] Lord please
[3:10:24] don't let me lose my mama now
[3:10:28] and I was with her
[3:10:30] some months later
[3:10:32] when the doctor said there is no sign
[3:10:36] left
[3:10:37] cervical cancer
[3:10:39] you don't have to have chemotherapy we
[3:10:43] have gotten it all
[3:10:45] God heard my prayer
[3:10:47] and he gave me my mother
[3:10:50] another 20 years
[3:10:53] how could I feel bad at him for taking
[3:10:56] her
[3:10:57] when she was no longer in her right mind
[3:11:01] but I miss the mother that I had
[3:11:04] when she was well
[3:11:06] so to all of you who have lost your
[3:11:08] mother I am so sorry
[3:11:11] it is pain
[3:11:13] it seems like other than a child or a
