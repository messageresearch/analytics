[0:00] this is revealing an order for the end
[0:02] time government of god
[0:11] we were born for this moment this
[0:14] is our moment this is our day
[0:17] you want to stay caught up in politics
[0:20] church politics and
[0:21] and national politics you want to stay
[0:24] caught up in the confusion that goes on
[0:25] around you don't you dare do it
[0:28] god is preparing you for this day
[0:31] he's building your life for this day
[0:34] because he wants to occupy people
[0:38] he wants to move in to a people and
[0:41] manifest itself
[0:43] in these last days he wants to heal the
[0:46] sick and cast out devils and raise the
[0:47] dead again
[0:48] in our day that's what the word says
[0:51] jesus hasn't changed do you believe that
[0:53] revelation 19 11 i saw heaven open and
[0:56] behold a white horse
[0:57] and he that sat upon him was called
[0:59] faithful and true and i want you to
[1:00] notice this
[1:01] and in righteousness there's an
[1:04] order that's about to be revealed here
[1:07] in righteousness
[1:08] he doth judge and
[1:13] make war there is a divine order
[1:16] for the end time and that is
[1:21] judge first
[1:25] and then make war
[1:28] he doesn't just come to make war
[1:32] he comes to first judge discern
[1:35] in all righteousness what is the truth
[1:38] and then his next reaction will be to
[1:42] make war this is revealing an order for
[1:45] the end time government of god
[1:47] somebody said what are you talking about
[1:48] well we're all talking about the kingdom
[1:51] this is the government of the kingdom
[1:52] being revealed to us
[1:54] there is a way to do it did you know the
[1:57] word we use
[1:58] for what happens to us when we are truly
[2:01] born again of the spirit we are
[2:03] we are justified do you know that
[2:06] justified is a judicial word
[2:10] it doesn't just mean there wasn't enough
[2:13] evidence to convict
[2:16] it's greater than an acquittal it says
[2:20] it never happened in the first place
[2:24] hallelujah so you may not be aware of it
[2:28] but there was a time
[2:29] that the accuser stood before the judge
[2:31] and called your name
[2:33] and said i'm sure
[2:36] that you're well aware of ronda
[2:41] she has joined the church
[2:45] she has changed her life
[2:49] she has become a christian
[2:54] but i know a thing or two about rhonda
[2:58] and i'm here to tell the court who she
[3:01] really is
[3:04] you may not realize it but your name has
[3:08] been called a time or two
[3:10] in that heavenly council of god
[3:13] [Music]
[3:14] oh he's heard a good sermon and so now
[3:16] he thinks
[3:17] that everything's all right
[3:22] the judge says excuse me just a moment
[3:27] i'm not sure what evidence you could
[3:29] possibly have
[3:32] because my record indicates that she
[3:35] didn't just have a change of mind
[3:38] but she has come the legal way
[3:43] she has properly appropriated the blood
[3:48] of jesus christ as paved in full
[3:51] for the penalty of her sin
[3:54] and because she has come the legal way
[3:57] you have no legal right you have no
[4:00] legal authority
[4:02] you have no evidence against her
[4:05] and i'm sure the judge then took the
[4:07] gavel and said
[4:09] ronda is justified
[4:14] now if you think that dumb devil runs
[4:16] off and never comes back
[4:18] with something on ronda you're wrong he
[4:21] comes again and the judge says you again
[4:23] yep ronda again yep
[4:28] do you know what she's done now
[4:32] he said well yes i i remember seeing
[4:36] uh another infraction i uh
[4:39] i remember at one point seeing that she
[4:42] had
[4:43] uh done something else contrary to the
[4:46] books of the law
[4:47] here but i'm having a hard time finding
[4:51] it oh yes here it is she repented but i
[4:56] don't even know
[4:58] what the infraction was because it's
[5:02] been sealed
[5:07] it's not only covered but it's been
[5:09] remitted and now sealed
[5:12] by the blood of jesus christ so i cannot
[5:14] tell you what it was
[5:16] or when it took place or who was
[5:18] involved but i can tell you you're
[5:19] wasting the time of this court
[5:21] get out
