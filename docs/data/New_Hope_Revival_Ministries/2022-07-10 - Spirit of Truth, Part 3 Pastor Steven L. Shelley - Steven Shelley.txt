[Music] [Applause] he's worthy [Applause] you may be seated i was shuffling around and i brought out the wrong notes so i had to go find them and i knew i printed them and we should be good till about five 34 pages today so we can spend our day with him it's wonderful to be in the house of the lord today and to feel his wonderful presence and our hearts are just delighted rejoicing that he has brought us all safely back together i wanted to mention that on the monday after the wedding jenna's precious grandfather and grandmother brother and sister siler he will be 89 shortly and she just will soon be turning 80 and they were uh on their way home to arkansas and they had taken some time driving because of their age and uh you know it's really a congested area there in the metroplex of of dallas fort worth and uh we had lunch with them on sunday after the service and we were blessing one another with safety and he said i know we're gonna make it he said we don't have to be concerned he said i know we're gonna make it brother shelly all the way back to where we come from he said because we're both following that bethlehem star he said that'll lead us all the way to eternity and it'll lead you back to alabama and it'll lead me back to arkansas that really touched me and it went deep in my heart the next morning they got up early to make their way back to arkansas and about 45 minutes away from where they were staying at with jenna's uncle and aunt they were in a major accident that totaled out their car completely totaled their vehicle and there was a dispute about whose fault it was but you know god sees he knows and it's no fun to tangle with an 18-wheeler i'll tell you that right now but you know they were fine sore bruised a little bit of sore neck spun the car spun around several times and yet they were taken to the hospital and checked out and told that they would be fine and they're already working on the vehicle and that was that bethlehem star somebody said well why didn't that keep them from having the accident i don't know i don't know why it didn't these things just happen but i want you to know no one could deny at their age that it was a miracle for them to be in a totaled out vehicle with an 18-wheeler and i think they made contact with the 18-wheeler more than once twice at least and spun them around in the highway and the and he's telling telling jenna's dad uh i'm not even i'm not upset i'm not it's all right that is the faithfulness of god i said that's a big old black eye for the devil he wanted to [Applause] god had been with us in such a precious way throughout the whole week and the enemy would like to have come and what a stain it would have been in our memory had they been broken not even to think about their lives have been taken but even even serious injury would have grieved us for a long long time thinking that they made such a sacrifice to be there and then that happened but they are back home safe in arkansas and uh jen jen uh jenna's i'll get it out in a minute her mom and dad took them back and they're safe back there and i wanted to give god glory for that we were very thankful [Applause] it was a wonderful privilege to be in service at jenna's church to see her up on the someone mentioned it recently upon the platform playing the violin and uh brother george smith uh was in rare form as he often is and he spoke that morning and it was wonderful being there with all those precious people and many of them said i hope you'll just go back and greet everybody for us and you may not know them but they're part of the great big family of god and we were just blessed i i don't often say a blast you know that sounds just like the young people in the world but i had a blast i had the most wonderful week of my life and that is the truth and uh it was just ordered of the lord and everything was so smooth and i'm i was so tired my wife and i were so tired when we got back we felt like great grandparents we did three days and i'm i'm not quite recovered yet but we hit the ground running we didn't even get to check in our our uh uh estate we uh went straight to eat with jenna's family when we landed and that is the truth we never slowed down uh much the whole week but god was good and what a joy it was to to go about with you precious people there and there were so many who said you mean there are over 50 of your church people that drove or flew to be a part of this wedding there were so many people just blown away by the fact that so many of you came and after we got home i was sitting there and my mind went back to that time when benjamin was born and i remembered the same thing being said by the nurses that day they said we've never seen such a support system she said there are over 50 people in the waiting room right now waiting for the news that that your son has been born you've got the most amazing uh support system and in those days you know you didn't take your baby and isolate them like like it seems uh people are doing these days anybody who stayed held benjamin the night he was born and those who didn't hold him the day was born they came back the next day and held him and the nurses just stand amazed they said we don't know we don't know who this baby is but there's a lot of folks that love him and love his family and so you proved again your love for our family and we appreciate that so very very much and then the thought of having to i told you when i was here the last service to see ben and kendra drive off in that sunset and know they were going on their honeymoon we wouldn't see them for a week and i just burst out in tears i didn't have to do that because we knew we were going to see them the next day [Music] that was such a blessing we all met at an old-fashioned pancake house in fort worth and somebody said well the food was just average i said it was exceptional to me because it was like it was like sitting in a vintage you know how how instagram is filled with vintage what we call old old garbage you know just old trash now it's vintage and rusty but it was the old atmosphere and uh i think charity called and got the room and we had our a room to ourselves and those people took notice of that they kept mentioning it we went up there to the someone among us paid the bill for everybody to eat breakfast what a what a wonderful thing to do for us and i i wanted a mug so i went up to buy my mug and the lady said i've never seen people like you she said i've never seen people like you she said there's just something about you she said it was as though when you come in the whole room just shifted and lit up she said i i just i've never seen anything quite like this and big tears come up in her eyes and i said it's jesus i tell you it's not us it's only him he's the only one that can make a difference like that and then we got to spend the day with him and then go to church with him on sunday and jenna's pastor brother mcgary he mentioned the fact he said we don't often see the newlyweds the sunday after the wedding and he said it was just special to us to have them here today and we saw god move we saw god do some things and we knew that it was him and he deserves the praise and we knew there were people back home praying for us and thinking about us and waiting to see pictures and videos and i know there are people oh wait you know there are people that look for a reason to be critical i just don't have time to study those people you know i don't i don't have time for that kind of negative negativity in my life and the thought come to my mind i know there's people ah there's another picture and i said i don't care i don't care don't look at them because i've got church people back at home that couldn't be here and i want them to know what's going on i want them to see it and we were just blessed who would have ever thought that sister flo would have flown to texas to be there she was determined to be there god was just good he was just good and we're just thankful and so far so good it's worked out real well i've enjoyed being a daddy-in-law now for over a week it's lovely it's wonderful i like it and i can't wait for what god no pressure no pressure but i'm getting ready you might as well get ready if it's an hour you're soon in the room might as well get ready i've only asked one favor and that is that they not wait until i'm too old to enjoy them which could be soon so hurry god is good you that are not uh we're not able to be here today we do have some traveling ian's birthday is this week and april and uh i'm just so glad to see maul here this i thought she was off with them and then i looked up and she's in service this morning and ginger and olivia are gone for a little uh birthday trip and um those of you i think you heard it tuesday night and by the way uh the uh listen i didn't get to hear tuesday night live but i've heard it since then and you did a remarkable job on tuesday night how many of you appreciated the word i really appreciated it it's a landmark and we don't want to let these things slip and it it impacted my life i appreciated it and i think brother greeley mentioned on uh tuesday night that god made a way for hawk and mary beth i mean when i say god made a way he made a way he made a way someone someone underwrote the trip and paid the expense for them to be able to go to iceland and spend a month of time there with his family and his parents got to see esther for the first time and he's going to be involved in ministry while he's there so we are praying for them that god will use them but they stayed with us in texas and it was just so wonderful and so warm and my my i couldn't uh hold back the tears when we i had to say goodbye so i stopped in up at their house uh after we got back and gave them a quick hug and and i couldn't kept help the tears again because we just appreciate them so much and we're really going to miss them for this whole month but god will be with us and he will be with them i'm just i'm just catching up with you i know you're rushing or you think i should hurry but uh i i can't hurry just yet i want to get a few things in we're looking forward to what god is doing he's doing some things shifting some things and don't miss tuesday night you're going to want to be here tuesday night i want to introduce you to a new family that god is sending us and we know that it's him and they're precious and they've made a real sacrifice to be here and they use the word urgency in their testimony you know unspiritual people don't understand the spirit's urgency but there are people in this house that can talk to you about urgency when the spirit of god says go and you don't even have time to plot your course you just go and if there was any dragging involved it was the holy spirit dragging pushing and prodding and doing whatever he has to do to get people where they need to be for this end time move of god and we were reminiscing about some of you that came through the years and you many of you came under the same urgency under the same mandate got to get there got to get there in a hurry and uh our labor and your sacrifices are not in vain because we're about to see we are seeing we are seeing the fulfillment and i don't mean to bring this up but i can't help it it's in my mind when the lord gave us this vision to place the studio here we knew that our numbers were not such that we would need those pews there and we felt like that we were coming into alignment with a vision where god had said we'll i'll give you a pulpit to the nations but over the course of that there were some negative ninnies among us there always are you got any in your family doesn't matter what god is doing somebody's going to be negative and there was a brother twins that's right and there was a brother who said i think we have all come to accept the fact that the church will never be full you know i never came to that fact because i had a word from the lord that he was going to fill this place and that he was going to bring people from other places to fill this place we've just been waiting on it and it's been discouraging and and and heart-wrenching and uh all that goes with it and despondency and up and down and you feel positive and then you feel low and you don't see how and you start trying to figure it out on your own but but god is faithful and you're about to see it happen [Music] yes it's happening it's happening already let's stand and go to the word let's thank god for these musicians we bless you all we thank you for what god is doing i'd rather be here right now than anywhere in the whole wide world i wouldn't want to be pitching my tent anywhere but right here why because it's where god called me and uh you know they say well you ought not to brag so much i think everybody ought to feel that way about where they worship everybody ought to have that same kind of passion and believe that this is the place hallelujah and there's no place i know like this place so this must be the place it's the place for me all right praise god is that enough of that acts chapter 16 i'm going to throw them off in the sound booth this was the first scripture on the new sheet and they told me there's something going on with that computer up there i never heard the explanation quite like they gave it but it appears that the computer is too smart for the software so i said well what am i supposed to do buy a dumber computer or how do i how do we make that work better so it seems that somehow this software is kind of bogging down a little bit and charity wanted me to know that ahead of time so i wouldn't apply too much extra pressure for for the scriptures and the quotes so they'll be here and we'll just have to be patient with them today until we can get that taken care of these fans are on because evidently this air conditioning has gone out again while we were away and maybe even during the storm we don't know what the problem is but but we'll get it working when we can and so it's a little cooler in the back i hope you'll forgive us and bring your fox and your mink and whatever you have your furs and wrap up and faux fur and whatever because we'll run it a little cooler to try to make a little bit of a difference up here acts chapter 16 and verse 14 and a certain woman named lydia i like that name it's a nice name lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worship god she was a god-fearing woman heard us and we're assuming that this is the apostle talking she heard us whose heart the lord opened i want you to read that phrase with me whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul i want to read it in the amplified version and see if you can can get a little something out of it there one of those who listened to us was a woman named lydia from the city of thytira a dealer in fabrics died in purple she was already a worshiper of god and the lord opened her heart she was already a god-fearer she already worshiped god she was already a follower of truth but the lord came and he opened up lydia's heart hallelujah and caused her to pay attention to what was said by paul the first church age messenger i've been where lydia was i've i've worshipped god all my life from the time that he visited me at 18 months old i have feared his name and i have worshipped him called me at the age of three to preach his gospel and filled me with the holy ghost at the age of seven and i have followed him the best way that i know how but one day the lord opened up my heart so that i would pay attention to the last church age messenger just like lydia's heart was opened that she would pay attention to the first church age messenger my heart was opened that i might be able to pay attention to carefully study and carefully hear the word that god was delivering to the last church age to call a bride out when god opens your heart he does it by revelation hallelujah and if you have ever had a revelation from god you got something to be thankful for today if he's ever revealed himself to you if he's ever opened up your heart and anointed your eyes with i saved and let you see something that you'd never seen before you ought to be the one to give him praise you ought to be the one to lift up your voice clap your hands and say lord i want to thank you i want to thank you father we thank you today for revelation you have taken your bride from intellectual faith to faith by revelation and what intellectual faith could not accomplish in us because it was a mental faith it was the origin of our faith it's where all faith begins all faith begins as a concept of the mind but when you pour the holy ghost on our faith and you reveal it to us we are no longer following christ because of a mental idea we're no longer living this sanctified life because of something that we have learned intellectually we are now following this christ we are now reflecting who he is because you o god have revealed yourself to us we may not always live like it we may not always worship like it but we want to tell you today thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you lord for revealing yourself to us thank you that you're you're not finished revealing yourself to us but you're still unfolding who you are before us as you expand our hearts oh we thank you now bless our time lord jesus together in your word and we will give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the church said amen i'm going to allow you to be seated and i'm going to ask for you to stay with me as much as you possibly can i want you to follow along because i believe the lord wants to remind us of a few things i want our minds to go back a little bit as we look at god's word and we remember a time that when maybe you thought you had it all maybe you thought you'd learned it all we understand that there are believers of this message who who feel that way they feel like that now that god has sent a perfect word they've got it all they're just walking in all of it but i even read where a minister recently posted on social media and said i don't understand all these people looking for personal revelation because god has revealed himself by the prophet well i want you to know that what god has done and who god has used is not good enough for you you've got to have a a personal unfolding a personal unveiling of jesus christ there has got to be an apocalypse of christ in your life the veil has to be parted over your life and the quickening power has to take this word and make it real to you because you can't fight the devil with william branham's revelation you can't beat the devil with shelley's revelation there's only one revelation you can defeat the enemy in your life with and that's what god makes real to you the prophet was so quick to tell us that uh any man who stands behind this desk should have tasted of the original manna for himself he said that's why god uh stored it in the pot in the ark of the covenant and in the in the pot of manna that was contained that was part of the contents of the ark of the covenant along with the table tablets tables and with a portion of aaron's rod that budded all beautiful tokens and mementos of god's supernatural power supernatural power so the word was represented in the ark by the tables of stone and the supernatural was represented in the ark by the pot of manna and by the the the rod or the yeah the rod that butted in almonds i'll get this out my tongue is a little twisted but i'll get this out so both word and spirit both truth and supernatural vindication was represented in the ark of the covenant now where's the ark of the covenant now i don't mean where is indiana jones trying to find the ark of the covenant somewhere in the earth i'm talking about where is the ark of the covenant it's the throne of god and where is the throne of god today it's in the hearts of men this is the throne of god this is where god sits this is where god dwells he doesn't dwell in a building made with hands he's not looking for stained glass he's not looking for steeples because all of those things become a part of the babylonian system and it's like old grandions uh i posted a little song on social media yesterday from from my friend brother leniel yance who wrote this song years ago and it was his dream to do a video and he even even asked he reached out about possibly doing it here in our studio but we weren't set up to do anything like they were able to do for him in south africa and we told him so but he traveled to south africa with a choir with with the musicians there in the church and they made a wonderful video as sort of a tribute to his life and the songs that he wrote and his precious old mother who used to play the piano and get so happy she would jump up from the piano and dance around clapping her hands and sit down and just keep right on playing she did that many times in meetings where i was she wrote that old song that i've never forgotten look out babylon you're getting ready to fall look out babylon you're getting your last call you deceived this nation long enough you've built your steeples tall but the name of jesus is getting higher the name of jesus is getting higher and babylon you're getting ready to fall hallelujah so he's not dwelling in in tabernacles and temples built with the hands of men he's building himself he has builded himself a home in the hearts of men and women and he sits here on the ark of the covenant and and he represents to us both the written truth of god's word and the supernatural power that quickens the word and makes it alive i don't believe you can make the rapture with an intellectual concept of the word alone i believe you've got to have a revelation of the word because it's not the written word that's going to get us there it's the living word and the living word is the person of the lord jesus christ and he hasn't left himself unrepresented in the earth he's got a bride i wish i had some help he's got a bride hallelujah she is genderless she's raceless she is a race of her own amen doesn't matter if her skin is darker or lighter there's no race in the bride there's no gender in the bride now there are offices i have to say this for some of my fans i say that facetiously some of my critics i have to say this for them i believe there are certain offices in the church for men and men only but i want you to know in the bride it's genderless what god wants to do in you brothers as his bride he wants to do new sisters as his bride and if if a woman can be a son of god then a man can be a part of the bride of christ it's a paradigm [Music] and it's not two paradigms it's sonship and union that's the truth that's going to take us out of here to be one with christ the living word it's not how many quotes you memorize it's not how many scripture verses you memorize it's not how much of god's words you go through it's how much of god's word goes through you because digestive in the spiritual is revelation it's god getting down in there and making it quicken until listen you can preach all day long of what god wants to do but you let somebody get a revelation he wants to do that for me it changes the atmosphere we can talk all day long about having the power of the creative spoken word but once you get a revelation you see i was told one time in the realms of spirit that i was born for that purpose i was told that the reason of for my birth was that i would manifest the power of the creative spoken word i'm waiting on that i know that is my destiny but it is not my destiny alone it was just the answer to my prayer i just prayed god why am i born why am i here what is the real purpose of my coming why what am i supposed to do just preach the word and he answered me in a very supernatural way you were born for the purpose of manifesting the creative power of the spoken word so i'm looking for that somebody said how could that come in handy well i'll let you figure it out all you got to do is look at the five examples of the spoken word and the ministry of brother branham and you'll find out how it could be very handy because it gives us authority over the elements and the power to tell storms to be still you just got to make sure that god didn't sin the storm that you're trying to quiet you get among some of the charismatics and they get to wanting to stop every storm you've got to understand i know the master of the wind i know nahum said he's the god of the whirlwind and sometimes we find ourselves trying to pray off of somebody brother steve what god has placed on them and you know that's antichrist that's moving in a wrong spirit if god is calling someone to repentance you don't need to be there trying to pray their way easier you need to be there praying get them lord however you need whatever you however you plan you would you just be sovereign in their life i want you to know i don't believe that god has to let somebody be in a car accident or that god has to put somebody in the hospital to save them i don't believe that i believe god can do that by one second one flash of his unction can come down and change a person's mind and cause them immediately to see their need for christ they're going along living for the world and for themselves don't even know they need god don't even know they need a savior and all of a sud and i've used the example of sister hattie wright's children that's exactly what happened to them there they are mocking the very god that manifested himself to bring them to salvation they're blocking laughing at the silliness of this story and all of a sudden god comes down the unction of god comes down and the word of the lord to the prophet give her what she wants brother branham said she could have asked for a million dollars one time 10 million dollars and it would have dropped out of the ceiling into her lap i don't want to be you i want to be the person that says sure he can sure god can whatever he wants to do he can do it i read yesterday where brother manhattan said that he could move and it didn't even have to be written in the word what he could do that's powerful isn't it he is the word he's not going to do anything contrary to his word but he may do something he's never done before oh i hear him nothing new under the sun i hear him now look brother sister this fight is not a new fight it's an old fight because once god opens your heart like he did lydia you are not satisfied with the peace of the word you are not satisfied with a dead dry discourse of a historical god you want to see a god who's just as real today as he ever was jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever right down in the nitty gritties are you with me i'm okay i didn't fall i will survive thank you for checking the lord opened her heart she was already a god fearer she already worshiped the god of israel and now as she sits under the words of the apostle paul something begins to burn in her and she says he's not like oral roberts he's not like billy graham he's not like w.v grant he's not like tommy osborne he's not like oh ja oil jaggers he's not like gordon lindsay there's something that happens to me when that brother paul preaches my heart expands give me the verse about enlargement of the heart would you psalm in the psalm where god talks about the heart being enlarged and i will run the way of thy commandments can we find that someone can call it out if you find it there it's in large heart it might not be enlarging the king james i can't remember but would you find that for me or are you in a real hurry good i want to take my time hallelujah psalm 1 psalm 1 psalm 119 verse 32 can you pull that one or is that going to throw you off 119 32 i will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart that's what happened to lydia her heart expanded her heart was opened up and she said well nobody ever talked about him like paul talked about him he made christ live when i heard this prophet i said he preaches as though he knew him he talks like one who walked with him and slept with him and and ministered with him it so struck me do you have that in another version there i will not merely walk but run the way of your commandments when you give me a heart that is willing the heart that is expanded is a heart that is willing no price i want you to stay with me now no price is too great when god opens your heart to the word let me say it again when god opens your heart to the word no price no requirement no standard no sacrifice is too much for you to give i worry about the vanity of this bride anybody with me i worry about the vanity of this bride i see coming to pass the ministry the sermon that i preached so many years ago i see it coming to pass in this hour the holy ghost of god was so grieved in in my heart uh last night through the night i i never slept deep because every time i started feeling a deep sleep i could feel a moan and a groan way down in my in my neither regions the inside of the inside i could hear the holy ghost going oh oh somebody said i i that sounds so crazy to me i don't know why it does because the bible said when we know not how to pray for as we all he the spirit will make intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered why is that so strange to you and i heard the holy ghost moaning all night long and i knew even a portion of why he was moaning he was moaning for those that have opened their hearts to the world because this is not an hour for the bride to be opening her heart to the world [Music] this is the hour for the bride to be opening her heart more and more and more and more and more and more to the world when you see the bride running after what the world is running after you can know that somewhere the holy ghost is groaning and grieving because this holy ghost is is desiring to bring us to the full manifestation of the stature of christ and by opening our heart to the world we contaminate the message of truth we contaminate the message of the revelation of jesus christ you remember charities baby doll the spirit of god has me to revisit that sometime three chairs on the platform i believe it was paul and brother west and the baby doll three representing three generations you see that what one generation devalues the next generation embraces compromise starts setting in when a value is no longer placed on the things that are valuable when you see the bride running after the things of the world wanting to be more elaborate and more more sophisticated help me now wanting to live above the look the bible tells a sister that she is to to desire to be shame-faced before god right and that her adornment is not to be the outward adorning of the planting of the hair the wearing of golden pearls and silver these things of the world her desire is to be toward her bridegroom and how she might be able to reflect his love and character to a world that's dying but every time you see a generation going farther and farther and farther to embrace the things of the world reaching for the diamonds reaching for the shiny things you read it you hear the message you know i got a shock a couple weeks ago i think it was sunday today was two weeks ago a friend of mine brother green's grandson is a friend of mine and he sent me a quote because he's digging in these days and he sent me a quote and i had just read part of it the night before where brother branham talks about the difference between shining and glowing the world is shiny the world likes the shiny things the character of this world is to like the glitz and glamour of this world it's all very attractive and we get blinded sometime by the by the lights of hollywood you don't have to say amen you don't change the truth by your silence it's still the truth we we get star gazed i've seen it happen to my own children where they look at these ball players like there's something to look at i want you to know very few of them are anything to look at they're not heroes i don't care how many home runs they hit and how many bases they steal if they don't treat their wives right when they get home they're not a hero of mine i don't care how many maseratis they drive if they don't serve jesus christ and make him lord of their life and honor god's word above their own desire i'm not following in that and i'm not going to be blinded by their stardom i happen to know i happen to know that one of the all-time and i'm not going to call the name some of you know the name but i'm not going to call the name but a friend of mine has been ministering to a real movie star unbelievable opportunity to speak life into a real movie star one that has won the awards and has captured the affections of women for years still today women are enamored by him and when you boil him down and use all of his money is laid on the shelf he desires the same thing this is god's grace to that man he desires the same thing that those that the rest of us do and that is to have peace he had an assembly of god influence in his life and he desires to go back to that church experience whoa that he knew let me tell you something his his beauty has not satisfied his picture on the front of the magazine has not satisfied the trophies on his shelf have not satisfied the the mansions that he owns have not satisfied way down on the inside of the inside he opened up his life and became vulnerable to a friend of ours and and said and even it was even in an interview out there in the public that he was looking for his roots what i'm telling you folks is we often get caught up with what the world gets caught up with and one more generation i heard brother greeley say something here and i don't know if you amend him or not but i did he said i don't think we ought to be looking like the upc church and i agree 100 because they some of those folks want to make sure they don't show their elbow but they walk around on them stilts out of balance just out of balance looking for a way to get along in this whole world what you and i better be looking for is a way to get in that word and let that word remake and reshape us into the image of jesus christ we better get our eyes off the glitz and the glamour and the shiny things somebody's going to help me i know they are somebody's going to help me because if we don't your children that are unborn your children that are unborn they will not have the godly influence and example you let granddaddy compromise and look what daddy ends up doing and then the third baby doll we just put a baby doll in there then it becomes and we can show it right in the scripture it went from fearing god about everything and walking before him in holiness it developed into a generation that everything was right they did what was right in their own eyes i'm telling you church we are living in the hour right now where everybody's doing what is right in their own eyes and very few are considering thus saith the lord somebody better wake up and that somebody's you and i we better wake up because what we've got they need and it's up to us to hold the line [Music] it's up to us i remember when god opened my heart i remember when he made me want to pay attention to what the last church age messenger was saying and it cost me something it cost me something i was preaching every day of the week on the radio and it cost me something i was preaching every saturday on the streets of anderson south carolina and it cost me something when i heard that messenger preach because i made up my mind i could never go back and do it my way i could never go back and do it how i had done it before i now had to make sure that i lined up with the word of god i thought i had it all i thought i knew it all and then god enlarged my heart you've heard paul keith when he did his series here on secretariat and if you come in my office you'll see some some plates of secretariat the horse i'm fascinated by i've got a little doll back there of secretariat that that uh the owner of secretariat and the trainer of secretariat signed the tag and i i enjoyed some of those things in in the day and you saw that triple crown winner and we don't have time to go through all that and when secretariat died you heard it told here that they did an autopsy on his body because there never had been a horse like that horse to this day not a horse quite like secretariat and they wanted to know how he was not favored to be what he was he was not predicted to be what he was but his creator had cheated a little bit on him his creator had given him an anomaly the heart larger than any horse heart that had ever been examined by man lord larger chambers pumping more blood giving more energy to run and stamina to stay the course and then you look at that scripture i will run the way of thy commandments for thou hast enlarged my heart let god enlarge your heart toe the line hold the landmark don't allow the glitz and glitter of this world to distract you in this hour is not worth it you see brother branham told them he said now i guess if you know your husband or your daddy or something give you a little chain and i i hear him i guess that would be all right to wear the problem with such a thing is this is the nature of the beast [Music] it's what i'm preaching if you've been amen and don't stop now if you've not been amen and you ought to start now it's just the nature of the beast because there's something when you go after that you feed something in your base nature you begin to be more concerned about your appearance you begin to be more concerned about drawing attention and attraction and so forth and the next thing you know you'll look like some of these message people today they look like clowns i'm going to be honest they look like clowns they don't no more just a little single chain but these big old dime store bubbles they wear it is the truth brother it institute and where did it start a quote some of them came out of holiness some of them knew better than to have those things but they picked that up because they had a quote for him i guess if you didn't have any fingernails he said you could put you some on that's a dangerous thing to say because that don't mean you chew them off so you can glue them on i'm just preaching holiness i know some of you probably never heard it in your life i'm just preaching the way it was preached to me seems to have worked you don't chew them off so you can glue them on look like a witch i see it and and and is it in itself sin he he said you didn't have any glumon so it must not be but that's feeding the nature of a beast and the next thing you know you got to have more you got to do more and you got to do this you got to do that and you got to pedicure that and manicure this poor old brother branham i love to hear him talk about how they how they manicured their eyes that's how much he knew about it he thought a manicure was something they did to their eye you know the bible is specific about that stuff when it talks about ahab's wife i'm not i'm not even gonna call her name i'm not even going to celebrate her name you know her name the bible specifically says she painted her eyes [Music] bible specifically says it didn't talk about her rouge uh foundation or all that specifically talks about her pain around she did that to be attractive she did that because she thought she would catch the attention of the prophet and that he would compromise that her beauty would strike him and he would compromise and only prophesy good things to ahab her husband whoa she didn't know the prophet that god had sent her brother branham said she didn't know that elijah was her pastor she never attended whoa i'm preaching now hallelujah i'm not on off of page one this ain't in my notes this is just fun we're talking about mrs dogmeat the queen of the land became food for the dogs because she thought her beauty if she manicured this and fixed that and and sucked that out and pumped that up she thought if she'd stole her botulism from the buzzards and inserted that into every crack and crevice that she would be able to present herself in such a way that the prophet would be enamored and attracted maybe she had no hope of sleeping with the prophet but she certainly wanted to water down his message she wanted to devalue the truth that he had stood for by the way she twisted herself around whoa but i want you to know god has a way it wasn't it she didn't just fall on her own out the window her own servants threw her down the eunuchs that had been trained to serve her perhaps the same ones that helped her curl her eyelashes we're the ones a prophet said throw her down you just don't get by god she never attended a service in elijah's church but the prophet said he was her pastor and she didn't even know it and god was going to hold her responsible for every word that he had preached down at the church that she had never attended because when god appoints a voice to a place that place is responsible to that voice that was not just for the bible days that is also appropriate and he carries it into our modern day and he said the same thing about the hour we're living in right now i saw where brother daniel i believe posted a quote about the kind old priest that's what they're looking for that's what they want for a pastor they want a kind of priest who will turn his eyes to everything and say nothing about anything as long as they have watermelon cuttings and soup suppers to supplement his salary they just want a condo priest to kiss their babies bury their dead and marry their children come on now they don't want somebody to come back and say hey get back to the landmark don't let these things slide [Applause] what was that brother greeley said tuesday night i'm just priming the pump for our pastor god opening our hearts for the word what do you think's gonna what do you think is gonna perfect this bride what do you think is going to move us into the last move of god and i want you to know i don't care what they say i don't care what they preach i want you to know there's one more blaze of god's glorious power that's going to surge through his bride on planet earth you've never seen god's glory somebody said how could you say that i can say it because i understand the law of sowing and reaping and i understand that one servant had to reach maturity and die so that 120 could come back on the day of pentecost i realized that just a generation ago one servant had to come to maturity and die so that a last-day bride could move into a quick short work not a church revival a rock bride's revival and though they preach sunday after sunday after sunday that we know the thunders we know the thunders we know the thunders i'm here telling you today exactly what he said the bride third seal bride has never had a revival yet it will take the revelation of those unknown thunders so we're waiting on something and we're not going to get it by opening up our hearts to the world [Applause] only when we open our heart to the word somebody said thank you for your help brother austin somebody said uh i thought you were on a series god's word calls for total separation or total separation is a prerequisite total deliverance requires total separation i thought you understand i am i'm still on the series i'm talking now about the difference between a mental and intellectual concept of faith and a revelation and once it becomes a revelation to you you'll never be talked out of it well i'm so glad some of that stuff never became a revelation to some of y'all it just became a learned doctrine so that when god comes along with truth and begins to open up your heart and let you see all you have to do is step out of error step right into the truth indoctrination is a plot of the enemy and there's just as much indoctrination around this message as there is any denominational system out there in the world that's how the enemy operates he's more concerned about what goes on around this message than he is what goes on in denominational circles because this message is what god sent to produce a bride and cause a rapture i think if god was going to focus on something he's way more concerned with what's happening around the little bride of christ wherever she is gathered to worship this morning around the world then she is keeping up with what's going on in the trends and the barna researcher questionnaires they pass out to find out trends and things you don't want you don't want to read the trends you don't want to read what's going on in the church you don't want to read those statistics less and less people are believing in a virgin birth a major charismatic leader came out this week and said it's no god no longer requires someone to pay their tithe so social media is blowing up i have an answer i wasn't even going to mention it because i don't even think that what they're doing out there is even really worthy of talking about in here i wasn't going to mention their foolishness but i think i will because they said well that's under the law and we're no longer under the law if you're going to have the law you've got to have all the law so probably paying tithe is under the law and so it's really not necessary to pay tithe of course we all know in here that paying tithe predates the law we all know that god required abraham to pay ties to melchizedek before there ever was a law and i got news for you those ties were more than ten percent because the amount had never been fixed and so now they're saying we so the church don't have to be worried about things like that i want you to know something if you don't give god what belongs to him you're a thief and a robber so all your shaking and quaking ain't going to get you nowhere [Music] it's the truth anyhow but but let me tell you what the new i love preaching this all right you don't believe in giving god 10 of your little measly 10 of your income fine you you say you want to do it the new testament way fine bring it all the book of acts said they sold everything they had and came and laid the money at the apostles feet come on let's do it you'll be so glad to go back and pay your little 10 percent ain't god got a good sense of humor and god must have taken it more serious than people take it today because ananias and sapphira they kept that comportion of their money they kept that comportion of their money and ended up giving their life for it because they lied to the holy ghost don't try to deceive the holy ghost i'm gonna close after a while don't lie don't think you can get by you may lie to the preacher you may lie to your parents you may lie to your fiance you may lie to your neighbor but don't you ever think you'll get by lying to the holy ghost because ananias and sapphire now if you take that to the message of the hour you'll find out that the prophet talks about an hour when that kind of the fear of the lord will return to the bride and he said and there will be ananias and sapphira's laying around and a few of them that's a quote and a few of them we're talking about a surge of god's holy ghost power where there will still be those who try to lie to the holy ghost and the same ones that carry the husband out of care of the wife same ones carry the wife will carry the husband out we're looking for a return of everything the word promised in the book of acts and the prophet of god has told us that if this vine ever puts forth another branch it must be exactly like the original same signs same wonders same miracles same power of god and i'm one who believes it will it won't be another book of the acts of the apostles it'll be another book of the acts of the holy ghost the holy spirit you're going to see some things you're going to see some things let me let me help you quicken it would you like to you know hasten it a little bit let me tell you how close your heart to the things of this world make up your mind if everybody mocks you when i received this message i told you a few moments ago my friends that would support me on the streets crossed over to the other side of the street when they saw me coming i had preached revivals for them they had preached revivals for me but when they heard that i had accepted this truth i'm walking down the down main street of anderson south carolina to get to my place to preach that saturday meet my guitar player down there to preach and on my way my very good friend one who had really been the best friend i'd had while i was in south carolina crossed the street and i started to say you're a jaywalker he didn't even wait till he got to the crosswalk he saw me coming and he just crossed over to the other side of the street he didn't even want to walk on the same side of the street with me you know what that's a reproach for the word i'm willing to bear that again and again and again and again and again somebody said but i don't understand that it is not required that you understand it is required of this bride that we obey the word i'm going to stay off of that john 15 26 anybody still here whoa let's see if i'm getting any amen oh yeah i'm getting some help here thank god thank god thank god thank god thank god yes i'm getting some help here too praise the lord but when the comforter is come whom i will send you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall what he shall testify of me the amplified said he will testify regarding me if the holy ghost shows up he's going to brag about jesus he's not looking for any glory because he understands this holy ghost you know we get it all kind of confused sometimes we've talked about it here we like to say it but the holy ghost is not it it's he the same spirit i will pray the father and he will send you another comforter i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you and what is it that the holy ghost comes to do to bring the spirit of truth to bring revelation not just information how many of you are hungry for revelation in your own personal life hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i want to give you this quote from the anointed ones at the end time are you ready paragraph 53 we read this when we were here two weeks ago what is faith hallelujah all the way back to the beginning of those notes what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you i heard this message preacher saying right on social media god has revealed everything he's ever going to reveal he did it to the prophet and those of you who are waiting on personal revelation you're wasting your time i said that's about the saddest thing i've ever read because you're not going to be you're not going to be held accountable for what god revealed to brother branham you're going to be held accountable for what god revealed to you and of course i i don't want you to misunderstand what i'm saying about this message it's truth it is our truth but the holy ghost has come to make that truth alive for you it's you're not going to get something contrary to the message you're not going to get some revelation contrary to the word we have an absolute but if faith is something that's revealed to you you can't please god without faith then you can't please god without a revelation because faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god so by revelation he said in the churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation i notice that some make an exception for their pastor they believe in the dogmatic teaching of some system by revelation abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified he was righteous and we covered that he said i hope you see that see where we're living see they are i was talking to a gentleman not long ago a christian scholar and gentleman and he said mr branham we refuse all revelations i said then you have to refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh unless you see it unless you see it unless you see it let me ask you a question does it matter if we know who jesus is or not it must i pray for those who believe he's the second person of a trinity i pray for them because they don't know who he is unless you see who he is you're lost i met people around the pentecostals and charismatics who say it doesn't matter how you're baptized it does matter of course it matters why would the bible tell us how to be baptized if it didn't matter course it matters jesus said except you believe that i am he you will die in your sin he is the revelation of god the spirit of god revealed in human form are you still with me you can't believe that you're lost you put him a third person second person or any other person besides god you're lost that's serious business except you believe that i am he you will die in your sins and look at how he how he accentuates and punctuates that last a revelation a revelation now we talked about how that it was a revelation of who god is and who god desired to be in brother branham's life that got him through the difficulty of losing his wife and daughter and the the congressman asked him he said uh bill how did you hold on to your religion during such a trial as that he said i didn't it held on to me how many of you are glad you've got a revelation that's holding on to you works is faith express paragraph 105. let's stay together now now faith is a revelation from god now faith is a revelation that's what i want to say there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith aren't you glad to know that you didn't work yourself up into faith if you've got real faith god gave it to you by revelation you didn't have to hold your mouth just right say so many hail mary's just right eat fish on friday go to church on ash wednesday thank you get your dogs blessed on whatever day they bless the dogs aren't you glad you didn't have to do all that god reveals it to you therefore therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon a revelation you see intellectual faith can deceive you because it's based on facts i want you to know there is a faith that is not always based on fact someone said what in the world does that mean i mean factoids do you know how the world tries to talk to us in factoids bullet points some people call them did i understand that the canadian government is now suggesting that people take a booster ever what honey every nine months factoids we have all come to question science in this hour brother branham was questioning it a generation ago we've all come to question science a little bit now because we realize that science is so fickle it really depends on the researcher i can say whatever i want to if i've got the pedigree after my name and it automatically can become fact that doesn't change the reality so sometimes faith is based on more than a factoid or what the world calls a fact they'll say well that's just a fact or you'll hear people say that's a fact with my hand up you don't know whether to go to the bank on that or not i wonder how they felt just north of the border this week when the entire electronic system shut down for an entire day nobody's credit card work nobody's check card work nobody's internet worked a whole single day of having to scramble around and figure out what you're going to do it's coming [Music] it's coming the first thing that people began to say across the nation was is this a glitch or is this an experiment coming through what we have been through in this hour i would say more likely an experiment than a glitch we have come to live like a cashless society every time i go to the bank i want to spit there is no coin shortage there never was a coin shortage it's something factoids made up the truth is they don't want to fool a coin do you know they charge this church to process our coins did you know they charged this church to process your cash we get a fee every month based on how much cash we deposit somebody somewhere is moving us into an existence that looks a whole lot different than the one we're experiencing now you better have you some cash because just after the bride gets out of here and there may be experiments before she gets out of here your cash is going to do you no good the bible said that in that great tribulation they'll throw their their money into the streets silver and gold in the tree worth nothing it could be devalued tomorrow the whole financial system of the world is about to shift it's already in place they're already ready chad was with me in in calgary preaching a conference in calgary and i had a meeting with a woman a chicken farmer who asked for a meeting with me who knew more about the financial systems of this world than anybody i'd ever met she began to tell me about top level meetings that she had been invited to chicken farmer because she found out some things and they found out that she found out and instead of killing her like they would have they decided to make her a consultant chicken farmer she learned what was going on in the islands of the sea she learned what was happening with the devaluing of currency i want you to know the spirit of the end time we're there the systems that will hijack the life as we know it it's there we're going to have to adjust some of our business even though we know these things are reserved for the exit of the bride if they run more experiments you see all the hacking shut down a banking system with a hack what about a power grid what would we have done in texas what would we do in this in this alabama humidity if they shut down the peregrine i want you to know something during the storm the other day the power flickers and goes off and i mean i go to tongues i did i was right by myself and it went off for just a few seconds and i'm in the floor oh god in the name of jesus i can't take it if the power goes off i melt don't you act like you don't enjoy it now you heard them sister beth they're all looking ah spoiled baby breath we're all a little bit small when it comes to something like that i mean i was ready to pray the world into salvation i mean i'm i said oh god let that tree roll off of the line calm the winds what would we do with some little wizard some of the demon possessed hoodlum sits down in a computer and shuts down the power grid we're living in an hour where the wickedness of men's heart is increasing and there's going to be a desperation strike the earth before the rapture and i know that because that's going to drive the final harvest they're going to run to you they're going to hope that you have an answer and you're going to have to have more than a quote well let me see brother branham said you're going to have to have a living word in you you're going to have to be able to pray the power and authority of god down you're going to have to be to move some things and shift some things whoa i i want you to know something i i saw my wife and i talked about we saw the favor of god in our in our trip unlike maybe ever before you're holding your breath you ever get this way you hold your breath because you know it's got to there's got to be a train wreck coming because everything's so smooth you're passing through immigration you're passing on the plane and people are actually kind again they can get oxygen they can breathe they're not oxygen deprived so you come onto a plane now some of them are a little on the unusual side i come this close to saying to this steward i don't really prefer the shade of your nail polish a deeper blue would have suited your outfit a whole lot better than what you had on but at least they were friendly to people welcome aboard so glad to see a few few months ago people shoving one another to get their bag in the and and i saw people helping one another like it used to be helping one another again and i'm thinking lord thank you thank you thank you for a little bit of relief and we just walked in favor and everything just fell into place and the rental car and everything we did and touched was just easy and you're bracing yourself because you're expecting it to all come crumbling down and i caught myself one day doing that and i repented before god and i said oh god i i should have expected this people are praying people are believing you to help us on this thing and you're helping us and we're just waiting on you to stop helping us or something i believe this little bride can walk under that open heaven and i believe she can experience the favor of god in unprecedented ways while the world outside house we can still prosper you believe that same man i want to read this quote here we'll we'll be done in a bit i i mean i've i hadn't preached in two weeks so i'm i hope you come with a snack leading of the spirit paragraph 62 there are so many super let let me read this first uh charity i'm sorry let me read first timothy 1 4 in the complete jewish bible can i do that first timothy 1 4 complete jewish bible this is a scripture that's a little bit baffling there as paul is talking to timothy about fables and endless genealogies and uh that that produce unnecessary questions and i like the way that the the dr stern translates this in the complete jewish bible he said have them stop devoting their attention to myths can i talk to you a little bit about it myths legends fantasies opening your heart to the world instead of opening your heart to the word i want you to be careful the holy ghost is grieved i don't want him grave with me i don't want him greed with you but as i told you earlier groaning and grieving i don't want to say too much about it i'd rather leave you prayerful about what kind of a situation would cause such a disturbance in the spirit world but it is when god sees his people opening their hearts have them stop devoting their attention to myths and never ending genealogies people get so caught up in this uh uh uh hebraic british thing and and uh studying about whether the royal family or jew or descendants of the jews and and what tribe what tribe someone is and and and how they scat they get all caught up in in in the podcast and in the books and in the websites and and they get all lost like my dear friend uh eric who who got so caught up in every conspiracy theory until you couldn't talk with him about logical reasonable things anymore even spiritual things there was a season where you couldn't even talk to him about spiritual things because he was so caught up these divert people this is a tremendous translation these divert people to speculating instead of doing god's work which requires trust you may not figure it all out you may wonder where somebody got his wife you may wonder about things you might give a reasonable amount of thought to some of these mysteries that we don't completely understand oh i i had to catch myself because my good friend hunter he he he he stays on top of a lot of things and he wanted to talk about some things and i would go so far and then i realized i had to pull back because uh you can get off you can slip off the slope when people start talking about reptilians and flat earths and mermaids and i've experienced some of these things i don't look at them the same way that everybody some people look at them and so it challenges me when i've told you before when i see children playing with things that i have dealt with in the spirit world it it worries me it bothers me i i understand how how curses are pronounced and how witchcraft can operate in churches and it makes you want to be a little like brother greeley said stay a little closer to the mountain a little farther away from the edge i didn't let my little girls play with mermaids because of experiences that i had had in the spirit because i didn't ever want that to become such a sweet thing when in all of my experiences it was demonic we don't want to open our hearts to the world until we get more used to the world then we do the word so paul is careful here to timothy he said have them stop devoting their attention to myths and never-ending genealogies that divert people to speculating instead of doing god's work which requires trust some things we may not understand but we just trust that god is going to help us get through them if you believe that same man there are so many supernatural elements to this message of truth that to be able to explain them all seems like an impossible task but once it is revealed to you then you understand what the prophet said when he talked about it needing we need both the word and the moving of the spirit to quicken and make alive that written word he said if you if you take away either you have to offer the people a substitution and he said any substitution any form of substitution is spells balaamism a mixture and we don't want a mixture so when you hear someone trying to take away the supernatural from the word it's a very very slick and sly demonic uh effort to divert our attention away from the things that really matter the quickening power that makes the word alive got to have it both got to have it both we've got to have a mo he said we must have them both and so don't get too caught up over there trying to figure out if if if you know who who assassinated jfk and i mean my goodness there's people who believe that george floyd is living on an island somewhere oh it got real quiet maybe some of you folks have been to visit him or something you know something i don't know the man that lay dead up there in the street murdered killed really by police officers i saw it there's no way in the world i could deny what i saw with my own eyes and even the justice system of our nation is making sure that that these things are not a common practice but there are people who believe he wasn't killed it was all phony and all faked and the videos were fake and he's living somewhere that people gave him money and he's living on an island somewhere uh i i if i had to bed i'm not a betting man but if i had the bed i'd say it's the same one elvis lives on because he hadn't been seen at the gas station lately he's probably over there with the loch ness monster and bigfoot too but be careful what you say myths and genealogies and questions that we can't all understand now you're wondering why i'm saying that here we go leading of the spirit of god campbellsville kentucky 1955 paragraph 62 and i'm gonna hush after that maybe oh my oh my oh my hallelujah he said i am not beside myself no but such a feeling to know that now right here stands jesus the one who raised from the dead the one who loves you so much he's speaking for me now i've been preaching about him he's talking now that's him excuse me lady i didn't mean to leave you i have to follow the way the spirit leads now here's a dark streak coming from a woman to another one what is it it's a devil i love this next phrase he knows his time has come now do i have just a few more minutes here when the enemy begins to sense that something is about to break through at nhrm he will stir somebody he will stir something to distract to divert he'll he'll cause some glitter to catch your eye he'll shoot somebody with poison he'll do anything and everything he can why because he knows his time has come hallelujah so what did this bride do we'll hang together we'll be unoffendable only by grace only by grace only by grace we'll be unoffendable and we'll press through this thing like bulldozers for the kingdom of god what god is going to do in the young married couples of this church is going to make a tremendous difference for the young people who are coming behind them and god is confirming that word to me by sending us more young married couples who have a hunger for the word of god [Applause] some months ago the lord spoke to me and he said i want you to make a list of kingdom couples and so i went through this church and i made a list of young married couples and the holy ghost called them kingdom couples and i've been praying over them every day calling their names out before the lord i'm just now mentioning it here for the first time but i've been praying for them and i've been asking the lord for confirmation and while i was in texas i had confirmation i don't think it would be necessary to share how it came but it came from jenna's dad he said something to me that confirmed to me something that i'd been holding on to about kingdom couples and then the news comes this week here's another couple and they're going to be persecuted by those who don't understand and they're going to be leave hurt feelings behind because families don't understand i'm telling you our own blood family sometimes doesn't understand that when the spirit says get out that we have to be have to be obedient we must be obedient anybody with me anybody with me don't let me lose where i am let me see if i can find this real quick just a minute just a minute just a minute hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus i would like i'd love to just hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you're still here praise the lord well this ain't it but i put this one in here yesterday it'll it'll be good to share it now 1956 revelation book of symbols he said wouldn't you love to live wouldn't you like to live where you're conscious that the unseen world's right with you all the time can i read that again and see if i can get a better amen wouldn't you like to live where you're conscious that the unseen world's right with you all the time to realize when you walk out of here and get in your car angels take their positions to the side of you glory be to god thank you lord for those angels riding with granddad and grandmom tyler [Applause] i'm not gonna be able to locate what i wanted to locate but i give you a good bonus but since you said that let me give you this one but it's not the one i'm looking for and i'll just forget and bring it here tuesday night full obedience this is 64 the token full obedience to the full word of god entitles us to the token no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word that's why you must shut your heart to the world and open your heart to the word no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it and added to it but what god said about it isn't that a good one paragraph 118 i couldn't find the one that i was looking for but the one i was looking for talks about when when you hear god speak do it right then go wait obey him you know why because if you wait those old thoughts will start gnawing gnawing nagging that demon was calling out for help we're back to paragraph 63 i've had too much fun and i'm all everywhere that little lady let's see 62 it's a devil he knows his time has come you're extremely nervous aren't you lady just hysterically nervous i see you trying to do things that you just can't you're just nervous mental nervous satan told you that you're going to lose your mind if you didn't get over it but he lied he lied to you he lied to you that that little lady sitting right there second one in the right back there she's bothered with nervousness too isn't that right lady see what i mean this demon knows if that woman do you hear what he said this demon knows if that woman will you can do it sister you can halfway believe you may not feel like you can believe believe believe all the way but you can have way belief and somebody said what in the world does that mean it means lord i believe help bow my unbelief lord i believe help thou my unbelief lord i believe helped out by unbelief lord i believe shikha yeah lord i believe help thou my unbelief see what i mean he said this demon knows if that woman will halfway believe that jesus christ the son of god and i'm his prophet that he'll have to leave her halfway believe and that demon was calling to the one to that one for help two women two nervous women two fighting with their nerves demons calling out to one another to strengthen their hold listen to this and that demon was calling to that one for help for help to accumulate unbelief you know why we've been bound so long because that's how things operate in the spirit world the influence of one over another spirits calling out to another spirit trying to be strengthened trying to hold on trying to tighten their grip and that demon was called into that one for help for the help to accumulate unbelief but he's lost the battle are you with me anybody with me he's lost the battle sure ass because instead of doubt and unbelief accumulating look what's gathering in the building now faith faith faith not intellectual faith not mental faith nothing but faith by concept faith by revelation very nervous upset you're bothered about somebody else too that's a man and that man's a soldier been a soldier he's a veteran of the war it's mental trouble it is your husband's brother your brother-in-law your husband has a habit too that he ought to quit smoking don't fear sister have faith in god come here for the blessing demons of hell not only going to cheat them two women out of their help but cheat the brother-in-law and the husband out of their deliverance by calling out to one another i lay my hands upon this sister satan you evil selfish ungodly spirit i challenge you in the name of jesus christ in a duel of faith wait a minute prophet said to the devil i challenge you in a duel of faith how's that possible because demons believe in tremble here's the problem they don't have a revelation of faith the only faith a demon has is faith by concept by intellect by mental thought they haven't had a revelation of faith i want you to know that every time a revelation of faith comes to a duel comes to a war with only a mental concept of faith faith by revelation will win every time that's why we've got to pray and pray and pray some more lord quicken your word to me until it becomes a revelation oh quickening let it become a revelation in my inner being hallelujah let me live out of revelation instead of out of my mental concept let me live out of my spirit instead of living out of my mind let me get above my mind my will and my emotions live in the super super race super gift of faith super sense of faith i lay my hands upon this my sister satan you evil selfish ungodly spirit musicians are coming i challenge you in the name of jesus christ in the duel of faith you're exposed come out of the woman in jesus name go in peace my daughter and may god be with you and bless you i wanted you to see this because this is a little bit about how demons can operate to distract to get our minds running down bunny trails of myths and genealogies and thought processes the church can easily be guilty well-meaning people calling this vaccination the mark of the beast and so that goes raging through social media and there's no truth to that wasn't the mark of the beast we've had a prophet come and tell us how the mark of the beast is going to operate if you say that it certainly opens doors and leads ways yes it shows you that all that has to happen is for the government to tell people what to do and they line up like little bunny rabbits i may get flagged i may get flagged hadn't i it shows us that the mark of the beast will not be a problem because people are just trusting we need revelation we need revelation i know it's been a bit controversial but i don't care if we just say what everybody else is saying i wanted you to see a little bit about how those demon spirits operate even in a service calling out to one another brother branham told us the worst kind of demon is the religious kind that's the kind that goes to church every service they don't miss a service you can count on the religious demons to show up every service and if they can't get a ride with who they usually hitch with they'll find somebody else to hit your ride with they'll show up they'll be here you can rest assured they will be here you want to overcome keep your eyes off people keep them on jesus he'll never fail he'll never let you down he'll never disappoint you he'll never compromise on what is right he is truth he doesn't just know truth he is truth i don't want any of us to be satisfied until we know that we are positioning ourselves for a revelation for god's word to be quickened and to be made alive in our hearts and lives so that when the wars come when the battles come when the testings come we have something to fight with you know i've used this example before those sons of skiva you know they got up there and they've seen it done many many times folks get like that they think it looks easy we've seen it done enough we'll jump up and just call the devils out too and they got up and they didn't even know how what to say so in the name of the one who paul preaches about they're they're just trying to figure a way well they come out all right they want it out of there because they wanted to show the preachers how foolish they were they come out all right they beat them sons of skiva up stripped them of their clothes and left them running through the streets naked you better know what you're tangling with and you better do it with a revelation it's not enough to say well i heard brother branham do it this way so i'm going to try to deal with this devil that way you better have a revelation of the one who lives inside of you before you grab a hold of the devil's toe once you know what's been revealed to you and you know that god's word is true and you're not looking at your life you're looking at his life yes there is no demon power that can stand in your way as a part of god's little bride if you believe that same man let's stand together praise god hallelujah there's a emergency prayer request here to pray i guess this would be the cousin of your children brother robert is that right she gave birth two days ago and has had a pulmonary embolism you had anything else since this this text come could we just pray for a young girl named hannah god sees her need right now father we don't know this one but you do we know lord that her body and mind have been vulnerable because of birth giving birth and we don't know the circumstances of her life but you do lord and we believe that it is our position and place to call out for mercy for her life mercy lord realizing that that little baby needs a mother so we ask you for mercy in the name of the lord jesus christ would you show mercy i want us to worship the lord together what do you have lead us in something and let's worship god let's present ourselves before the lord in worship let's ask him to quicken his word in us and give us more than a mind concept or a mental thought but may we have a faith that comes by such a revelation that we are not afraid to stand even against the wiles of the enemy in this hour firm on the word if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost you need the baptism of the holy ghost if you're wrestling with demons in your life you need to win the victory and the holy ghost can help you win the victory over those demon spirits you don't have to be bound by lust you don't have to be arrested by pornography you don't have to be contaminated by opening your heart to the things of the world you can shut off the world and open your heart to the word may god just do for you what he did for lydia may he just open you're already a god fearer you already worshiped the one true living god may he just come today and open your heart and enlarge your heart and fill you with a greater revelation of who he is grant it lord grant it oh god you heard the word at the beginning let's worship him one with god the lord most high [Music] you are christ what a beautiful name it is what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus christ my king what a beautiful name it is and nothing compares to this what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus you didn't want heaven without us [Music] [Music] my sin was great your love
