TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Hello, I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope Revival Ministries. I wanted to come to you today and just share with you a few things that the Lord has been doing in my life. Not because my life is so special or unique, but because I have always believed that if the Lord is dealing with one person in a particular way, there's got to be somebody out there somewhere that the Lord is dealing with in at least a similar way. Uh in 2015, at the beginning of the year, the Lord spoke to me about dealing with the junk in my life. Well, it wasn't a word that I exactly wanted to hear. We all would like to hear something maybe sounding a little bit more grand than that. But it led me on a journey. He followed that up by saying, "I want you to be a better reflection of the message that you carry." Now, that's a heavy word because it means that if we're going to preach the gospel, especially the full revelation of Jesus Christ, then we need to be able to come to the place where we can walk it out, where we can live it out, where everything about our lives is a good reflection of what we carry, what we believe, and most of all, who lives inside of us. So, 2015 was a year of dealing with my junk. started out in the physical with some sheds and some storage bins that the Lord showed me. I mean, he just brought them before my eyes and I went in and I'm telling you, the hours that I spent going through a life of memories and memorabilia, some of the things I found brought me a lot of joy and some of the things I found brought back a lot of pain, a lot of memories that were not so painful. You know how the journey goes. up and down and sweet times and serious times. But over that year, God really began to transform a lot of things about me by making me deal with some of the things that I had held on to, old hurts. In fact, the Lord brought me back to a place where I could pray for for those who had hurt me, maybe even those I thought I had let go. I had had forgotten about it, but God brought them back and he dealt with me in such a profound way. You've got to be able to pray for them until you can do it without the hurt, without the bad memories, without the bad feelings. Love them like I love them. I'll tell you, it's easy to say, but it's not so hard to do. And over the course of that year, he dealt with me about getting healthier and and he gave me the strength and the courage that I needed to make some positive changes in my life. That journey is not over yet either, but I'm still on the journey because I want to be a better reflection of the message that I carry. I want to be obedient to what the Lord is saying. This year, the Lord has been talking to us about more junk. This time, our thoughts, our attitudes, our perceptions, the way we perceive things. And it's been a journey again because God turns his search light on the good, the bad, and the ugly. But I'm so thankful that he does. I'd rather my father, the one who loves me the most, be the one who points out my shortcomings and failures than anyone out there. And I know a lot of people love me, but nobody loves me like my father loves me. Let me share this scripture with you. Ephesians 4:22 in King James verse 23 says, "And be renewed in the spirit of your mind." But let me read it in the amplified. Ephesians 4:22, 23, 24. Strip yourselves of your former nature. Put off and discard your old unrenewed self which characterized your previous manner of life and become and becomes corrupt through lusts and desires that spring forth from delusion. And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind, having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude. and put on the new nature, the regenerate self, created in God's image, godlike in true righteousness and holiness. I love those scriptures and I love the fact that the apostle says, "Be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind." It's not something you do one time and never have to do it again. We used to sing the song One Day at a Time, Sweet Jesus. But when you're walking through a journey like this process of God showing you the things that you think that are toxic, it's more like one second at a time, sweet Jesus. Because it's a journey and a process of constantly renewing the mind, grabbing a hold of those thoughts that are contrary to God's word, pulling them down and stuffing them under the blood of Jesus Christ. We have such power and authority to do that if we just trust him. There's so much more that I want to share with you that God has been teaching us and we'll do it another time, but I just wanted to give you this little word to get us started. You don't have to believe it just because you think it. That old accuser, our enemy, will lie until you believe what he has to say. Instead, choose today to believe what God's word has said about you. And it'll make your day go a whole lot smoother. I promise. God bless you until next time. [Music]
