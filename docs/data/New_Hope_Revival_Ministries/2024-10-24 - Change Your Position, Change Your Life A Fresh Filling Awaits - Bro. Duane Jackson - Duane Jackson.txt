Description:
Join us for an unforgettable message from the second session of our Campmeeting on Tuesday, October 16th, as Brother Duane Jackson shares an inspiring word. Using a powerful analogy about a coffee cup, Brother Duane illustrates how our openness to the Holy Spirit determines whether we are filled or bypassed. He challenges us to examine our position and remove any "lids" in our lives that block the continual filling of the Holy Spirit. Don't miss this message on spiritual renewal and living a life that pours out to bless others!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I like visuals visuals sometimes help with things now I don't know how many are you are old enough to have went to restaurants sit down restaurants whenever you used to go for breakfast I whenever I was a 13 years old my first job was working for a little restaurant in town um called the home food shop they had a uh they were they were famous in our town for their breakfast this was the position that the cup was when you sat down at the table now they would come around you'd be sitting there eating and the waitresses or the waiters would come around with a pot of coffee in their hand now at this restaurant particularly that I worked at they did not ask you if you wanted coffee if you wanted coffee when you got to the table you turned the cup up right that signified to them as they would come through I want coffee they wouldn't stop and say are you sure that you don't want some don't want coffee cuz I want to give you some coffee we made coffee we' made it all morning I really want to fill your cup with coffee sir they would never go to your table and turn your cup upright himself what they would do is they if they noticed that your cup looked like this and the person sitting beside you's cup looked like that they would come to you fill it up it this person they didn't even speak to church come on because they left their Cup in a position that signified I I don't want to be filled up people come in and this is the way they live their life exact wonder why and they'll be sitting beside a person that's right here and they'll be like what's the big deal I'm I'm in church too I came to the same restaurant I sat down at the same table but this person's cup got filled yeah and this person's cup got bypassed and all they had to do was change their position there it's all they had to do change the position Amen to allow themselves to become full but you have some that that that go to a restaurant and they had drink the cup was full and then all of a sudden over time it ran out and they say I want to be like that person I used to have the holy ghost in my life I was full at one time and so then you say well I'd be happy to give you some more and they sit in this condition can y'all see yes sir sir sir oh somebody saw it that's right there's a lid on it yes sir got and they come in and they sit there and they say fill me up Lord fill me up Lord but they keep the lid on and then the Holy Spirit comes comes through and the Holy Spirit says you know maybe you're struggling so I I I want to fill you up and it and it it starts trying [Music] to I'm not just making a fool of myself you might think I am but I am preaching right now you sure are the Holy Spirit wants to fill you up you can't go through life saying I was filled with the Holy Ghost 42 years ago yeah I remember when and I'm still living off of that experience exactly it has to be a continual refilling of the baptism of the holy spirit it's not just a oneand done come on you know they they say you could if you sat there long enough you could just continually refill this cup because then if your vessel is full then you can go and you can pour it out to some else and then say Lord fill me up again and I can share it with somebody else and I can keep allowing him to fill my life and I can pour it out and I can help somebody else [Music]
