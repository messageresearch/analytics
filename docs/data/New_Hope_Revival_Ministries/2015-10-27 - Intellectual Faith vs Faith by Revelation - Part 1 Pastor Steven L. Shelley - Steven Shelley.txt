TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Praise the Lord. I'm Pastor Steven Shelley and this is the Eagles Cry. I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and tell you again that I consider it a privilege to come your way, preach the glorious gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I hope you can learn something along the way. I'm still learning. God's still revealing himself and his word to me. And that's what keeps me pressing onward because I know that God continues to reveal and unveil himself to his hungry children. Don't ever get to the place where you're so satisfied that you don't hunger for more of God. In fact, for me, it seems like the more I have, the more I receive, the more I want. And that's exactly how it needs to be. God wants to enter into a personal relationship with you. The God I'm talking about is not a God of wood or stone, not an idol, not a statue, but a living God, a living reality. What we have here is a written record of a living God. And when we desire to have a real close relationship with him, he is available. He wants to reveal himself and make himself known to you in in a real way so that when your faith gets tested, you've got something to hang on to. You can say, "Wait a minute. I know I have found the living God, the only real God. Maybe you've heard someone say, "There are many ways to God." I want you to know that is inaccurate. That is not the truth. There's only one way. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." And if you find God, my friend, it'll be through Jesus Christ. That is the way that we can come to God and know him in fullness. That was the love gift that God gave us. He came in a fleshly body, walked among men, healed the sick, raised the dead, cast out devils, and then went to the cross and shed his life's blood so that you and I could be redeemed from the curse of sin and and death. Thank God for that. And rose from the dead on the third day and lives forever more to make intercession to the father on your behalf. Whatever your needs are, they have not escaped the Lord. He knows those needs and he desires to give you what you have need of. You come to him in prayer and in faith. If you want us at New Hope Revival Ministries to uh join with you in prayer over your prayer requests, feel free to pass them on by email or even by letter. We would be more than happy to pray with you, believe God for you. And then when the answer comes, I'll be the first to want to rejoice with you, and give God praise. He is truly, truly worthy. We're beginning a new series today. I want to talk to you about faith. But not just faith. I want to contrast something. I want to explain to you through the word of God that it is possible to have faith and it be only intellectual knowledgebased faith. But what we are really after in this in this hour is a faith that is not just intellectual but it has been transformed into something else from mental faith to supernatural faith which comes by a revelation of the spirit. And so, uh, there are many people who have faith, but I want to be able to know that I possess a faith that was revealed to me by the Holy Spirit so that when the enemy comes to test that faith, and don't you worry, he will. He'll come around and try to test you on what you really believe and whether or not you can hold on to God when the doctor says your days are numbered. whether or not you can hold on to God when your own child is afflicted. When you've got terrible tragedy and calamity happen happening around you in your nation, will you really be able to hold on to God? I believe there are things coming upon this world that will be of such uh a horrendous nature that it will take more than just a knowledgebased faith. It will take a supernatural revelation of faith that connects you to a supernatural and living God to be able to stand against the ws of the enemy right here in the end time. So, what we're going to believe God for is to show us in his word how to move from fact faith, intellectual knowledgebased faith to faith that comes by revelation. In order to do that, we're going to look first to the book of Matthew, the first gospel, Matthew chap 26. And we're going to begin reading today in verse 30. I'd like to read five verses. And beginning in verse 30, and when they had sung him, they went out into the Mount of Olives. Verse 31. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended of me this night, or because of me this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But after I am risen again, I go before you into Galilee. Don't miss that. This was Jesus revealing his resurrection promise. Verse 33. Peter answered and said unto him, "Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended." Oh Peter, be careful what you say. Verse 34, Jesus said unto him, verily I say unto thee, that this night before the cockcrow, thou shalt deny me thrice. That means three times Peter said unto him. Peter will never learn. It seems though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. It wasn't just Peter who decided he would never deny the Lord. All of the disciples said the same thing. We'll never deny you. But Peter said, I'll never even be offended because of you. Well, Jesus just said all men are going to be offended. All men are going to go. But Peter somehow excluded himself from the words of the Lord Jesus Christ. May I submit to you, it's never a good idea to exclude yourself from what Jesus says about you. You need to in fact agree with what the Lord says. He knows best, doesn't he? You see, Peter answered this way and he responded this way because he could not bring himself to believe that he could possibly be one who would deny the Lord. Peter saw his own strength, his own resolve, his own will. And in that will, he said, "I could never deny the Lord." Unfortunately, he had the right confession of his belief, of his faith, but he did not have enough strength to live out his own confession. That's where the need for spirit revealed faith comes in because you can have a a knowledgebased faith. Well, I know God's word is true. I know God will do what he says. And then you get in a situation where there's nothing but negative, nothing but doubt, nothing but words of death being spoken around you. And if only you have confidence or faith based on knowledge or what you've been told, boy, that shakes. Like Peter's here, that really shakes. Peter made this amazing profession, but it was based on what he knew about himself. He thought the strength that he had to be faithful to his dedication to the Lord, but he didn't have enough spirit revealed faith to have the strength that was necessary to live out that confession. I want us to see this through the scripture so that we can believe God for a faith revealed by the spirit. So that when we get tested and tried, we don't just make these big mouth confessions like Peter did, but we actually have the strength, the courage, the stability to keep that confession, to live it out. And God is able to give us grace to do that. Let's look at another place uh concerning Peter. Luke chap 22 uh beginning in verse 31 through verse 34. And the Lord said,"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you." Oh, that's not good news. That he might sift you as wheat. But this is good news. Verse 32, "But I have prayed for thee." Oh friend, Jesus said to Peter, you are going to be sifted as wheat, but I have prayed for you that what? Thy faith fail not. Do you know it could almost have been said that you have the right kind of faith? It actually says that thy faith fail not. But it could have easily have been worded that you have the right kind of faith. The kind of faith that lasts. the kind of faith that gives you strength to live out your confession. It's easy to say it. It's easy to make a confession of faith, but it's a little harder when you get in the stormy winds of life to live that out. Jesus said, "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not, and when thou art converted, uh-oh, when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." You see Jesus saw that Peter had a knowledgebased faith. He believed and based on his knowledge of believing. I believe he thought that was going to be enough. And the Lord looked deeper than that and saw there was something missing in his spirit. He needed a revelation. He needed God to open up his heart and fulfill this uh desire. You know, Peter had a burning desire to know the Lord, but he his heart needed to be opened up a little bit. And here's the rest of this. Verse 33. And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death. What? I'll go with you all the way to death. He said, and he said, verse 34, I tell thee, Peter, the shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. Here it is again, a great indictment, not against Peter, but an indictment concerning Peter's lack of spirit revealed faith. Faith by revelation. The reason why Peter had never failed like this before is because he'd never been faced with this kind of a situation or these particular circumstances before. New circumstances in our life and new situations in our life can often put us in very vulnerable places. In those moments, we must never rely on what we think we know. We must only rely on what we believe that has been revealed to us by the spirit. Not a belief up here, but a belief that comes from down in here. That's what the spirit of God does by revelation. It takes a a knowledge, a fact from the word that you have heard and it drives it down into your heart. Oh God, do that for every one of your children. Help us to take what we've received up here and let it be driven down in our heart where a friend of ours says uh may God take this truth and drive it from your head to your heart and then to your hands and feet so that you can live it out. That's what is necessary for faith to be lived. And in order for faith to be lived, it has to become a revelation. It has to be revealed to us by the spirit of God. We cannot rely on what we believe with our head, with our mind. We can only rely on a revelation that comes by the spirit from the word. Peter was leaning on his intellectual concept of faith and it failed him and that caused him to fail. His intellectual faith was not enough to hold him, but his revelation was enough to pull him back to truth. See, he did have a revelation. It wasn't a complete revelation, but it was a powerful revelation. And I want to share that with you. Let's look at Matthew chapter 16, beginning in verse 13, and let's read all perhaps all the way down to verse 20. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some say thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, that would be Elijah, and others Jeremas or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and said,"Thou art the Messiah." King James says, "Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee." See, this is not a mental concept. This is not someone teaching you and you heard it. Something bigger is happening here. Peter, flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. See, it was a heavenly revelation. It was a revelation that came from the heaven by the spirit to Peter. And he said, I say also unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock, not Peter, but upon the revelation, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. Now Peter had a revelation of who Jesus was, who Jesus is. And that revelation in itself was enough to pull Peter back when he almost lost his own life. Peter knew by revelation who Jesus was and he could never ever ever deny that. It would have been impossible for him to deny who Jesus was. But that's not what he was confronted with. If if you'll notice in the scriptures that we'll read in a moment, it wasn't who Jesus is that Peter was being tempted with, that was not the temptation to deny. It was something entirely different. As we just read, he went on to deny that he was identified with him. He denied his relationship with Jesus, not who Jesus was. A moment after Jesus confirmed Peter's revelation about his true identity, we see that he was still functioning in the strength of his flesh. See, Peter was hard to learn. Look at this verse with me quickly. Matthew 16 verse 21, 22, and 23. From that time forth, this was right after he gets this amazing revelation that Jesus is truly the promised Messiah. From that time forth, Jesus began to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day. Then Peter took him, listen to this, then Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee." See, Peter loved the Lord and he could not accept the fact that the Lord was going to have to suffer and that he was going to be killed. It was more than Peter could swallow. and in his passion and in his I don't know if it was frustration or what the right word would be to use here but in that uh heat of the moment in that passion of the moment instead of saying you know this this just can't be in fact he rebuked the Lord he it was almost like he was bringing an accusation against the Lord he was doing it in a way that was not very honoring and not very respectful but the Lord recognized it knew where it was coming from. And he turned and said to Peter, "Get thee behind me, Satan." Now, was Jesus calling Peter Satan? I don't think so. But Jesus recognized in Peter Satan's language, Satan's vocabulary. You see, the Lord already knew that Satan would do everything that he could to keep this whole scenario from uh coming to pass exactly like the Lord said it would. You see, it would have been the desire of Satan to kill the Lord and leave him in the tomb, but he didn't have power to keep him there. And so, this was really Satan's uh ambition was to prevent the whole scenario from from coming to pass. He didn't mind the Lord being killed, but he didn't want this resurrection stuff. And so Peter rebuked the Lord. He said, "This will never be." And Jesus said, "Get thee behind me, Satan. Thou art an offense unto me. For thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men." In other words, Peter, you're being selfish. You It's nice that you love me, but you can't get in God's way. and and what would make you think that you could stand up and get in God's way? This was a lack of maturity and it was it was proof positive that although Peter had a powerful revelation, it was not a complete revelation. There were some things that Peter still knew in his head. There were some things that Peter now knew in his heart, but there were still too many things that Peter knew in his head. Peter was actually still pretty concerned about his own reputation, his own standing in the community. But I want you to know a few moments later when that old rooster began to preach his sermon, Peter knew that he had indeed done the very thing he said he would never do. Said, "I would never deny you. I would never be offended because of you." Let's look at Luke 22:es 54-62 real quickly here. Then took they him and led him and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed a farar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said, "This man was also with him." And he denied him, saying,"Woman, I know him not." And after a little while, another saw him, and said, "Thou art also of them." And Peter said, "Man, I am not." And about the space of one hour, after another confidently affirmed, saying of a truth, this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the crew, the rooster let out his cockal doodle, didn't he? And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. Oh my. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him before the cockcrow, "Thou shalt deny me" thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly. The very words that Peter said, "I'll never do," were the very things that Peter ended up doing. Notice, not any of these questions was, "Is Jesus the Messiah?" Perhaps if they would have asked Peter that, he would have had to say, "Yes, he is." Because he had a revelation of that. Each one of these questions was, "Are you one of them? I think you're one of them. I think you have relationship with him." And so, Peter's confidence was in the Lord. But he didn't have enough confidence in his relationship with the Lord. That's where we're tested. We are tested on our fellowship, our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. That's what Satan is after. He'll do anything and everything. He'll use anybody that will yield to him to put a wedge between you and an intimate relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. This is why it is vitally important in this hour that we get a faith that comes by revelation. One that is driven by the Holy Spirit from our head, our intellect, our mental concept all the way down into the inner being of our spirit. So that when we face these kinds of moments where Satan is testing us and trying us, we have more than just a testimony of what we think we know. We have a noso. That's the way the old-timers used to say it. We need a not a think so salvation. They said we need a noso salvation. How many of you know the difference? I think I'm saved. I think I'm I'm right with God. And I know that I am. Well, some people say if you make such a statement, I know that I'm a child of God. That that's rooted in pride. I believe it's rooted in a revelation of faith. The Bible said they will know they're saved, not think they are. They will know they're saved by the quickening of their spirit or in their spirit. That word quickening means to come alive. It also means resurrection. So they will know they're saved because there's a resurrection going on in their spirit man. That is a revelation. That's more than a head concept. That's more than a mental idea. I'm going to ask God to give you more than a mental idea. You see, what Peter was missing was what God wanted to do for him in the upper room. He just hadn't gotten that far yet. Remember, it's a journey. We're not born again one minute and a mature, adopted son of God the next minute. No, this is a journey toward the kingdom of God. And there's going to be many hills and valleys. There's going to be many curves in the road. You know, I don't know if you've ever read the Pilgrim's Progress, but if you have, you'll identify your own life in it because there's going to be places of temptation, places of discouragement, places where you feel like you just want to throw in the towel and give it all up. But don't you dare do it, brother. Don't you dare do it, sister. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. I'm going to pray right now. We'll finish this uh another time or we'll get another installment of it the next time we're together. But right now, I want to pray that God will begin to open up a real revelation by faith in your life. Father, these are your children. And I love them. And that's why I'm here to minister to them. But I can only do so much. I can only show them the scripture, talk to them a little bit according to how you've revealed truths to me. But I I need you and they need you to come and take this message of truth that you've given us in your word and let it become a living revelation in us. Oh father, let not just our mind get a hold of it but let our spirit get a hold of it until it becomes a revelation of faith. Let our faith not be a mental concept only, but let it become a revelation from the heavenlies, from the spirit of almighty God. Release healing to those who need healing so desperately. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. I want to thank you once again for faithfully watching the eagles cry. And I want you to know that we're praying for you and believing God to perform his wonderful word in your life. Don't you dare give up on the brink of your miracle. The enemy will discourage you. He'll tell you it'll never come. We get awful tired of waiting sometime. And our hope feels like hope deferred. But I want you to know a joy comes in the morning. They used to say the darkest hour is just before the dawn when the sun comes up. I believe it's often times that way. Don't you forget the sun is going to rise again in your life. Thank you again for watching. Bye-bye. Until next time. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
