can't help but think about the fact that it's my mother-in-law's birthday and i know my wife still misses her mother a lot and there's hardly a few days in a row that go by in our home that we don't say nanny would have done this nanny would have liked that nanny would have made that so she is certainly not forgotten uh this is a week of a lot of celebrations you can have your seat just a moment because i want to take time to greet these who we have here on the list uh we missed tally last week i didn't mean to i had it wrote down but i wrote it in such a place on my note that i kept looking down and then i checked my calendar and i had her down for two days she's so special she was born 27th and 28th but we want to say happy birthday to tali last i guess it would have been thursday uh our precious sister fousey is having a birthday this week in japan god bless you sister fousey we love you right down the middle right through there just go straight down the middle sister beth polk right down the middle she's having a birthday this week too on wednesday god bless you sister and then on thursday paul west is having a birthday and also jennifer stark is that right this is just a week of a lot of celebration so happy birthday jennifer we want to thank you for praying for the funeral yesterday in valley uh there were a number of people who came down from the church at uh well where is the church is it conyers covington maybe i don't know up in that area but uh there were quite a few that came down there were about eight of us there representing uh sister carol's time with us i guess uh she was most faithful here for about seven years in the 90s we loved her dearly she came off and on through the years we still loved her like she was a part of us i still heard from her she still called we still talked and we had prayer together many times these last few years she's been unable to do that and it was very hard to see what arthritis had done to her body really it was a horror to see it the only only piece that i could have looking at that body was knowing she don't live in that house no more oh hallelujah [Applause] i know that must have been painful as that process was taking place i can't even get i can't even do that you can't even do that like like it was they were her hand was bent all the way back like that and even all she had been through there was still a glow i don't mean from the way they prepare the dead that inner glow and brother gibson danner i sang i'll see you in the rapture brother yes and dinner preached a wonderful message on the value of life and how the world values life one way and how the believer looks at life another way and here was just 30 of us all gathered just 30 people all the people that carol had known her whole life and steve was there and the cousin and and uh her sister's uh sister-in-law or something like that that was the only family that was there but it was a beautiful service and god was honored and brother gibson denner talked about someone like kobe bryant passing and the whole world just seems like just seems like shuts down to to grieve people were crying and didn't know why they were crying people that never met him i'm sure he was an outstanding fellow uh i do know that he did a lot of things for people and that was nice but to the world he was a basketball star and the whole world wept and grieved and laying up there in the valley was a child of god see and just a handful came it don't matter but just a handful came and uh brother gibson ander said the valley don't even know we're here they don't even know we've come there was only three people there from the valley the rest had come from the church in covington or here the valley don't even know what's laying over here oh i'm about to i'll tell you i'm about to shout something's building up in me here hallelujah but he said jesus does oh there was great celebration just a few days ago [Applause] and sister carol kept the faith i want you to know she was one of the strongest people in her faith through the years that i'd ever known she her life was changed when she met jesus it was changed again when she met the ministry of brother branham and she did it through i think it was the hollis had a role in that and i think she might have even been in shreveport in 65 on the wings of a snow white dove and her life from that moment on was a different life she just didn't fit in in church anymore and so she stood faithful it was a memory a stroll down memory lane for me because we stood there just not too far from where some of the hollis are buried and we stood just across from where we buried uh steve's dad's mother vera whitlow i had her service there many many years ago and i just had this thought one of these days this place is not gonna look like it does there's going to be a great change out here in the cemetery i believe that i still believe in the coming of the lord the great resurrection of the dead so i'm taking this time because some of you seniors would have loved to have been there those of you who knew sister carol way back and steve sent me a note and he maybe he's probably streaming this but he sent me a note and he said mother would have been pleased with her funeral service you know that means a lot and i'm so thankful that he felt that way and would you help me continue to pray for him that god will just give him the victory he says he's going to come and see us and i believe he will well it's not a solemn moment it's actually a happy moment because i i'm just so thankful for what the lord has done brother and sister we're so glad to have you all i know you i do but i don't remember your names brother i figure brother skip will fill in where i fail god bless you you won't you think i'll remember that the next time i'm gonna try my best brother peter god bless you both we're so happy you're here today is it all right if i call you all sandhill people is it or if i say that that's your heritage isn't it you're not ashamed of that and i don't i wouldn't be either uh i saw where sister judith is having a birthday soon i don't know if you people even remember birthdays but i saw it and she's been so precious to us these last few weeks we've had some quick moments of fellowship with her and we've enjoyed it so much i hope you all will feel at home once you get through the the the loudness and the and the music then you'll be all right you'll settle in i know you will let's all stand and go to the lord let's thank him for what he means to us unless i i want

thank you to the musicians thank you for everything you've done for the lord this morning thank you that went from the church here yesterday to the funeral sister laurel particularly playing for us to

and uh and yet he's going home two days later we're giving god the praise he's uh was in charleston and he'll be going home not too far from there we pray that he will have a wonderful recovery he was concerned this morning because he might be able to stream some as they were discharging him but he wasn't able to send me all the virtual amends that he normally does and he was concerned about that and i told him i was going to let him slide this morning you'll have to give some real ones we want to say to all of you who are watching this service across the platforms i better i better get your birthday greeting in from brother joe in south africa he's sending it and he'll he'll be hurt with me maybe if i didn't mention it and god bless you in trinidad in cape town god bless brother merle an old friend of mine from the west god bless you for being with us this morning and those who are watching in vancouver british columbia they want you to know they believe the lord is coming god bless them god bless brother linsley and so many more and that's just those on youtube hebrews chapter 10 verses 28 and 29 we're talking this morning on the spirit of grace we have covered four others this is the fifth and isn't that uh appropriate since grace is the number five five is the number of grace we have two more to go when we're through these are administrations or offices of the holy ghost in our lives we've had one session on the spirit of grace we will do our best to pick up where we leave off i want you to know that none of us would be here today if it were not for the spirit of grace we've had a few people reach out this week and said we didn't know grace was a spirit well it is an attribute of the spirit it's not some inanimate object somewhere or some just emotion or some missed or grace is a work of the holy ghost and i'm so thankful for grace he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace may you and i never be guilty of offending the spirit of grace in in john chapter 1 i want you to read verse 14 and then we will let you have your seats this is a very powerful verse of scripture that we quote so many times together verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us do you really believe that yes you really believe that's who he was the same was in the beginning with god i do too and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father would you tell me what he was filled with full of grace and truth you want to know where grace came from it came from him it came from the lord jesus christ that same spirit of god that was dwelling in him now dwelling in the believer and one of the works that he carries out in our life is he releases to us the grace that only comes from god there's no grace in this world it only comes from god let's pray just a moment our father we thank you today that you have allowed us by grace to be gathered in this house today we've come in your name we've come to lay aside everything that we have been through during the week and to focus our hearts and our minds and our attention on you and lord because you have come among us our coming is already most valuable we're already so thankful to have known your presence here but we believe now we're approaching the most important part of any service and that is when you by the foolishness of preaching choose to expound your word we as believers reach out for that word in faith we pull it toward us in faith and you activate that word in us by the power of the holy ghost we're not here today to put the word on somebody else we're here to take it for ourselves we see it as a gift of grace to us to be able to hear many people have ears but they do not have grace to hear lord i thank you today for giving each one grace to hear and grace to obey we'll give you the honor and the glory and the praise for all that you accomplish in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen you may be seated may god give you everyone grace to live such a life that you never bring insult to the spirit of grace it's a gift of god to us it is by what we're saved we're saved by grace not of works lest any man should boast somebody might be able to do a bigger work or a greater work than somebody else but we're not saved by works amen we're saved by the grace of god and because grace is a person because grace is a work of the holy ghost in our lives he gives us strength he gives us power to overcome every attack of the enemy and when the enemy would distract us or when he would try to pull us out of the way that spirit of grace is activated in our hearts by faith and he starts pulling us back to the word can anybody testify of how the grace of god is working not has worked not has worked is working in your life this grace of god is something we need to entertain every day we need to encounter the grace of god every day we need to recognize the grace of god every day in our life and we need to give him thanks for it amen we just need to get up thanking him for grace and go to bed thanking him for grace and thank him all day long because without that grace we're in trouble it's god's favor to us it's god's kindness to us it's god's blessing to us and none of us have ever deserved it not even one time if all of our righteousness was piled in here together around this altar a holy god come walking in our midst he would see all of that and it would still be filthy in his sight but once the believer recognizes what god has accomplished on our behalf and the blood that's laying on your altar begins to cry out for you and you take off the robe of your unrighteousness and put on the robe of his righteousness when he sees you he sees the blood when he sees you he sees his righteousness come on now when he sees you he sees his favor amen we're blessed we're blessed to have a savior who came to this earth full of grace and truth he is the source of grace and truth we we started talking last week about the fact that grace is not a substance because when we talk about grace sometimes we make it sound ethereal or or or you know like almost an emotion or or a feeling we say well by grace i do this by grace i do that but do we really understand what the spirit of grace is who he is and what he is accomplishing in our life i know that there are those who try to push the grace message beyond the scripture oh you don't have to do that the scripture's clear it's grace that saves us it's grace that keeps us it's grace that heals us it's grace that delivers us it's going to take rapturing grace to get out of this whole world it's going to take resurrection grace to be changed i need traveling grace i need grace to go to town we need that grace we understand that but because we have grace it doesn't dismiss us or let us off the hook we must obey the word of god we must cooperate with what grace is accomplishing in us we must say a man to the truth of god's word not just with our mouth but also with our lives if you believe that you can squeeze out another amen so grace is a work of the spirit i want you to write that down if you've got a pencil grace is a work of the spirit it's the spirit work it's a work of the spirit it's a force that leaves a tangible testimony that it has been somewhere and that it has accomplished the father's work when grace is loosed in our life it accomplishes the father's will if we will yield if we will cooperate with that however grace is more than just god's unmerited favor god's grace is what keeps us from getting what we deserve and gives us the things that we don't deserve let's drag that one out a little bit it not only keeps us from getting what we deserve but it provides for us things that we never deserve grace can be defined today as god's love for us in action grace has also been defined as god's ability to give us new desires that old man's dead when we come in contact with god's grace we don't want the same highs that we used to want we don't want the same experiences that we used to want we don't want the same life that we used to want so god's ability to give us new desires and then by the spirit he nurtures those desires and he begins to bring them forth in our life until his will is accomplished oh i want to tell you brother it's a setup it's a set up i hope that doesn't offend anybody it's a set up god has set you up to win somebody said is that just some positive manpower of positive thing are you just trying to build everybody oh no i'm just telling you like it is you have been set up by your creator to win you have to make the choice to cooperate with the word you have to make the choice to walk in faith to the word and with the word but you have been given i have been given everything he requires now you you come up with a more theological proper term and i'll listen to you but for me it's just like a setup i want this this this and this from you and if you'll trust me i'll give you this this and this and this what a contract now when we hear that phrase two times in scripture once in the old testament once in the new testament the spirit of grace we know that word spirit is pneuma in the in the greek in the new testament it's pneuma it means wind or movement or breath or life it means breeze it can means it can mean a current of air it can mean something that pertains to the divine spirit which is the holy ghost when we look at the word grace we see that it means a gift or a blessing it means favor it means kindness it means favor it means god freely extending himself toward people so we can say that the spirit of grace is god breathing over us his favor god getting to us his kindness god making a way for you and i to encounter the grace of god every day because we don't have to come to church to find it we don't have to be reading the bible to find it he now lives inside of us this holy ghost and with that we have received the spirit of life amen we have received the spirit of truth amen we have received all that god had the spirit of adoption we have received the spirit of holiness we have received the spirit of grace we have received the spirit of supplication we have received the spirit of glory how how is that possible because the holy ghost has come in and he brings all of his attributes with him and all of his works among us he brings that all into us so we don't have to go somewhere in the cave to find it we don't have to climb up and down the stairs of some church with a hail mary and a rosary bead in our hand we don't have to go sit in the booth and tell the preacher all about it we just have to believe it to accept it by faith and choose to walk according to what god's word is ask of us and when the way gets hard what do we do we depend on his grace i'm not going to try to tell you that serving the lord is the easiest thing that anybody's ever tried to do but i will tell you this it's it's a lot easier than the way of the transgressor the bible said the way of the transgressor's heart you think that's a great life out there you think that success is real success you think the christian life is a struggle that's the struggle brother because they have nobody to go to they have nobody to depend on there's nobody walking in them so you and i have the helper that we need we have the advocate with that we need we have the comforter that we need if you believe that's amen in the message the message of grace let me give you a quotation this shouldn't offend anybody paragraph 57 it says so in the deity of jesus christ if the lord god should i pause just a moment we're we're going back to something i think that we had in the notion last week paragraph 57 of the message of grace i didn't mean to pull something there you go how many of you appreciate these ladies i appreciate them now they're red so in the deity of jesus christ if the lord god could come there and confirm that this is the truth not only that but by his word he confirms it's the truth and by signs and wonders he confirms it's the truth then also grace is the truth he said then why could anyone criticize and say that grace is wrong that we're saved by works we are saved by grace and that through faith not by works works shows that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of god grace saves you i want us to understand this morning that works is a demonstration it is a confirmation of what has taken place on the inside of our life but our works do not save us make sure that we get that and that we know it and that we understand it because it's very important now i want to go to john 1. we were just there in verse 14. i want us to go to john 1 15 for just a moment i know we're studying a little bit but we're getting somewhere and we're going to go verse 15 through 18. john bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me we're not talking about just birth order now come on now we're talking about before abraham was i was amen i was i am he said now he was before me and then he goes on and of his fullness have all we received and i'd like for you to read those next four words grace for grace multiplied compounded grace does that remind you of zechariah's prophecy that the headstone will come forth with shouts of what grace grace what is that that's the fullness of jesus christ coming to cap that stature of a perfect man that he's building in his bride church there's no doubt about it verse 17 for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ oh hallelujah the law was given by god through moses and we appreciate the law because the law has a shadow of things that are to come it introduced to us a covenant that we we could not fully appreciate the covenant that we walk under today had we not seen what god's idea was in the beginning he was always after a separated people help me a little bit he was all always after a separated people and he was building and building and building and building to get that separated people to come forth and he was going to accomplish that all the time jesus coming and crew being crucified and paying the ultimate price for our salvation was not plan b it wasn't an afterthought it's what he had in mind from before the foundation of the world but he was laying line upon line and precept upon precept he was first god above us and then god with us and now god in us by the power of the holy ghost you cannot make it in this life if if there's someone streaming this service and this is offensive to you i challenge you get down on your knees lock yourself away for a while and ask god to fill you with the baptism of the holy ghost make sure you meet the prerequisite be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you can receive the gift of the holy ghost because we need the holy ghost some people say do you need it to be raptured do you need it to be resurrected do you need it to be this uh let me tell you something you needed to get out of bed every morning we need the holy ghost to live because that's god in us giving us strength and power to overcome in satan's eden that's part of the bride's destiny to overcome but grace and truth came how not by the law that was a shadow grace and truth came by jesus christ no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and i want you to know that's not just a declaring with the mouth because christ is the mystery of god revealed not just the mystery of god declared but the mystery of god revealed and i want you to know i haven't changed my mind through all of these years if jesus christ is the mystery of god revealed there is an end time bride that will be the mystery of christ revealed in the last of the last days somebody said you really believe that yes and i believe i'm looking at part of her i believe it's in you that he wants to manifest who he is i believe it's in us that he wants to declare the father's glory that's why god sent us the truth are you with me now oh there's so many versions and i don't i don't i don't preach out of all those versions but i do read them sometime and i always try to check them by the lexicon and and even brother daniel yesterday was quoting a little bit from the amplified so it must be all right to do that from time to time but as i was looking at this one verse in a few other translations i picked up a couple that i'd like to to just leave with you here i've already read it in the authorized king james version does everybody feel all right i established it to be first and foremost among us but another translation said from his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another now that's verse 16. in king james it said and of his fullness have all we received grace for grace another translation from his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another am i talking to anybody this morning has anybody here received grace for grace in another version it says we all live off his gender generous bounty gift after gift after gift grace after grace after grace after grace you see the spirit of grace in our life it gives us a divine enabling we are enabled by grace to do all things the scriptures require everything the scripture requires instructs a believer to do we are able to do that although some people will argue with you and they'll say i just can't live this believer's life i just can't live an overcoming life i know i know why listen anyone who says that to me i know why and you do too that's because you're trying to do it by yourself if you could have saved yourself jesus wouldn't have had to come and pay the price on our behalf you can't fight this fight alone you can't live an overcoming life alone you can't reflect jesus christ without having jesus christ by the holy ghost inside when the spirit of grace is operating in a man's life a woman's life it's god enabling us to do all things the scripture require and the same grace that enables us to do what the scriptures require gives us the grace to walk it out to obey it in all situations i guess among you seasoned believers here very few of you are ever tested in your walk with god as mature as you are you probably never have to hesitate to make sure you do the right thing you you've been doing it so long the right thing is so automatic you never have to pause you just live off the fly is that right well then i'm not worthy to be with you this morning because because i'm not that mature because i still need to take a minute the world sometimes calls that i don't want to be too early but it's kind of they say it's a chill pill somebody needs to take one i do sometimes i have to take one but i don't get it in a bottle i take a moment and i say wait a minute i know where this is going aren't you glad that you can recognize when the enemy is trying to derail you aren't you glad that by the spirit of grace you can identify that he's come with another mask he's come with another way of trying to pull you out of god's plan you know what he really wants to do is pull you into condemnation he wants to pull you back into guilt no siree there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh it's a choice it's a choice but by the spirit number two the spirit of grace helps us in the painful process of coming to the cross it's painful even though the price has been paid on our behalf there's a divine exchange that has to take place at the foot of the cross i like something brother gibson anders said yesterday at the funeral he said sister carol didn't just die he said there's no death like that to the believer carol whitlow died many years ago how many of you believe it's true i believe that for you you count it up and tell me how many years ago did you die you died to self you died to sin have you always got it right since then i think not but you invited the only thing that's going to help you get out of it the only presence the only power the only authority that's going to help us get up above the oppressor the one who comes to deceive and to destroy the thief that comes to steal and to kill and to destroy your life the only thing that's going to get us above that is trusting in that grace of god he helps us in that painful process of coming to the cross and exchanging our own sinful nature for the sinless nature of christ come on it's not always pleasant but it it's available to us by grace number three it forms the character of christ in us i want to tell you something this is something we're missing in many many cases in our lives and in our families maybe church family we miss taking that moment to say wait a minute i'm not here to get my way i'm not here to prove my point i'm here to try to manifest the character of jesus christ you know we laugh at the church world out there because they got so carried away some years ago with wwjd they wore it on their bracelets and they sung songs about it and they read books about it what would jesus do and a lot of holiness people you know we can easily kind of brush that off and think that that's a little bit silly but i want you to know something the way they go after it might be silly but the reality of it is necessary that divine pause that says wait a minute i've got another character that i've got to put on display here i've got another character that i've got to let move out of me up through me and out of me because a world is dying and going to hell around me and i'm the only bible that most people read so i've got to yield it and when you can't do it you can't bear the responsibility of the lost i want you to know if you get caught up in that burden that think that you could bear the responsibility for all lost mankind you cannot do that it is not your burden to bear it is not your responsibility but it is our responsibility to reflect the character of jesus christ and it's up to the holy ghost to put people in our life that we can make a difference it's up to us to follow the leadership of the lord and he'll send you to strange places sometime because he wants to get glory in your life and you're going are you still with me number four it sustains us the spirit of grace the breath of grace the wind of god's grace in our life sustains us in the most difficult situations that we will ever face in life the grief of losing a loved one the panic of a pandemic losing a job losing a home losing a loved one losing a spouse losing a child you could go on and on and on and think about all the darkest moments of your life did you get through if you got through you got through because the spirit of grace was operating in your life somebody said i wasn't even a christian then let me tell you something god didn't find you when you knelt in an altar he knew who you were before the foundation of the world his grace was already running after you his grace was already seeking you before you recognized it enough to seek him you believe that i believe that this spirit of grace number five it helps us in the mundane things of life and not just in hard situations and in difficult relationships but just everyday typical life of a child of god just the same old same old sometime in those moments when we don't feel like we're climbing mountaintops in those moments when we don't feel like we're chasing devils out of the way in those moments when we feel like we're barely treading water not really going forward afraid we might be slipping backward we're feeling a little anxiety because of where we are let me tell you something it's the grace of god that sustains us even in those moments it's his power that keeps us it's his grace that sustains us and number six that spirit of grace lives up a standard daily in our lives against the enemy and provides help in our time of trouble and gives us liberty and freedom i read this to you last sunday i'm going to read it quickly and move on without the spirit of grace we cannot live up to our profession we cannot copy the example of our beloved master we cannot keep his commandments we cannot love one another as he has loved us we cannot sympathize with lost sinners in the world around us we cannot keep god's glory in view in all that we do and say we cannot walk in high in holy fellowship with god without the spirit of grace we cannot meet death with peace and joy without the spirit of grace do you believe we need him i want to ask you how important is the spirit of grace in your life and how do we receive grace it comes to us as a breath of god it comes to us as a gift of god it comes to us as a release i want to present to you that grace affects every area of our life you believe that number one it affects our salvation i don't usually number things but i've numbered them in these notes you'll you'll forgive me and work with me ephesians 2 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god so the spirit of grace operating in our life is what brings us to salvation would you say that's important the most important and then in romans 3 24 they should be in order romans 3 24 being justified freely by his grace through redemption that is in christ jesus we are justified freely by his great do you need the spirit of grace yes by that spirit we are justified freely through the redemption that is in christ jesus the only way that you and i can enter into a relationship with god is because of his grace toward us if you call yourself a saved person a born-again person it is because of god's grace it's vital it's necessary i want you to look at genesis 3 21. you know this verse well this was the first demonstration symbolic of god's divine grace in the bible unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god this is a physical act did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them why did he do it he did it to cover up their nakedness the nakedness that just a few hours before they didn't even know they had it was god's grace how many of you can hear brother branham every time we talk about it we can hear the message where brother branham is preaching about adam and eve walking out of that garden with those bloody skins slapping the back of their legs where did they get those skins god himself came down and slew lambs he slew sheep and he made adam and eve all they could come together and figure out was some fig leaves i don't think fig leaves did much covering up i think people have gone back to fig leaves don't you you know people don't understand original sin like we do here and sometimes people will say well uh i'll tell you this uh eating an apple if eating an apple would cause you to know you're naked brother ram said we need to pass the apples how many of you know that's not the way it works they were naked but not ashamed because they were covered by the shekinah by the heavy glory of god they didn't know they had not been made aware of the of the of the knowledge between good and evil it was all good they didn't know evil existed hallelujah there was no shame in their nakedness now they've sinned against god and when god was coming in the evening for the next appointment of fellowship they wanted to make sure they didn't face him in their newfound nakedness so they grabbed them some fig leaves and started sewing them together and trying to figure out how they would cover god said that'll never work but i have a better way i have a grace-filled way i'm going to show you what it's all about it must there must be a lamb there must be a death there must be blood shed and then i'm going to take off those skin this is god i tell you what a tailor he was that he would come down in the garden of eden and make coats of skin and put them on adam and eve let me tell you something that was grace breaking forth in a garden that had just lost its way i want you to know the atmosphere of glory that had been in that garden was now gone it was a different place eden would never look the same it was gloomy and depressing and god shows up and he makes away by his grace where there is no way and he's still making the same way today provided a lamb that would provide for you a bloody cloth that you could wrap yourself in the clothes of his redemptive work that you would not stand before him naked what did it because you joined the right church because you recognized the right prophet because you said you believed a certain message no because you accepted the gift of god's grace hallelujah and you let that work in you don't ever stop his work don't ever stop letting grace do its job in you i want to thank god that grace is still working in me god's still using his grace to talk to my heart hallelujah he could have killed those first humans right there for their disobedience but rather than destroying them he chose to make a way for them to be right with him that pattern of grace continued throughout the old testament when god instituted blood offerings as a means to atone for sinful men it was not the physical blood of those sacrifices per se that cleansed the sinner it was the grace of god that forgave those who trusted in him hebrews 10 and 4 will tell you that sinful men showed their faith by offering offerings and sacrifices that god required it was pointing the way to another way to another day to a better sacrifice something else was coming that would do for us what the law of moses was unable to do in a message called israel and the church i'd like to give you a few paragraphs there if you'll permit me to do that i'm asking permission good paragraph 46 in the garden of eden when man sinned first look at the nature of a sinner hiding hiding somewhere in the dark the children of the evil one they like the darkness don't they because their deeds are evil don't be too critical because you and i have hid from god a time or two we thought he wouldn't find us oh what a dumb mistake we were making to think that god didn't know where we lived he knows exactly where we are at any given time he said but it should have been adam calling out to god but instead it was adam hiding and god calling to adam oh brother robert i tell you that thrills me it should have been me calling out to god it should have been me recognizing what was going on and calling out to him but before i ever called his name he was calling for me the prophet of god tells us no man ever sought god of his own mind at any time it was only when god was seeking man that there became this glorious we experienced christ because christ was seeking his own he came looking he came seeking sister jeffrey used to sing he came seeking for me adam was hiding he thought god may have come to kill him god didn't come down like that to kill adam he came down to dress him he came down to cover him with something that would make a way for him to have another opportunity down the road but it should have been adam calling god but it was adam hiding and god was calling adam adam where art thou brother branham asks you see it let's go on that's the nature of a sinner hide run away get behind something but god calling oh my grace amazing grace are you with me grace amazing grace god calling and now notice you say oh that was adam and eve it's always through the bible the same jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him is that right now that's the word and that's the way we want it the word then you know where you're standing aren't you glad for the word all right let's read on how many in here are christians tonight know that you're christians there's something in you says you are a christian yeah all right you see why you should be the happiest come on brother steve you should be the happiest people in the world i don't mean to be harmed too critical here but have you ever noticed that some holiness people [Music] are the most miserable looking people you've ever seen in your life do you think they've smelt one another or something and that's why they look as sour as they look i've been all over the world and i've ran into holiness people and i do my very best when i meet people who dare who dare swim in another direction than the direction the world is swimming in i honor that i don't care if they're amish or mennonite or pentecostal holiness or message or or whatever they are i honor anybody who who is willing to to stand and say i i want to testify with my life i want to testify with the way i dress i want to testify by the way i talk and the way i walk that i'm a separated child of god i want to be an ambassador of heaven on this earth i honor that but in my experience through the years i've seen some of the most miserable sad oppressed sour looking people that i have ever known in my life i have caught myself a time or two thinking i wonder what a a perm would do for that woman that's an awful thing to say and i wonder if she'd be different i wonder she'd be happier about her life if she was going another direction now i'm telling you here i'm not in any way suggesting that anybody should go and pattern themselves after the world but what i am saying is you and i who have been bought by the precious blood of jesus and saved by the amazing grace of an amazing god we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth somebody said what if you're going through a hard time paul and silas were what if you're going through a hard time miriam and moses and the children of israel had just come through the hardest time of their life but they looked up and saw the victory oh hallelujah and miriam had a tambourine and led a dance hallelujah in the presence of the lord it's not what you do in here that i'm talking about it's what we do out there let the joy of the lord be your strength i want to say something unpopular i believe it is not necessary to be grumpy because you're getting older there was five amens they all come from the shelley house if you wondered who those amens come from that was stacy benjamin joshua living right i don't want to be that grumpy old man you pray for me i want the spirit of grace to live me up above my grumpiness i want to live exactly like the bible said i can live exactly like the prophet of god told me i can live we ought to be the happiest people in the world they ought to be walking up to us and asking us why are you not why do you have long hair and i believe in it why do you have on a skirt and i believe in it but that's not what they ought to be asking us they ought to be walking up and saying why are you people so happy every time i see you you look so happy and then you can open wide i feel good then you can open wide your mouth and tell them because jesus lives on the inside of me and what i cannot do for myself he has done it on my behalf and it gives me not only joy but it makes me happy hallelujah we are we you should be the happiest people in the world he said you should just believe that my that's easy take god's word for it look at your neighbor and say take god's word for it thank you for doing it take god's word for it or you make it sound like it's easy you're you're talking about the wrong preacher i have never tried to make you think it's easy i have been as transparent before you as i possibly know how to be i have told you of my own struggles i just told you i don't want to be that grumpy old man that i can be sometime i'm not telling you it's easy but i'm telling you i have a whole lot easier part than the one who purchased this on my behalf and all i have to do is say lord it's not me it's you are you still with me let's see i got a little more time not a lot but a little more thank you it goes on we ought to be the happiest people he said now before you can become a christian god called you now you calling god not you calling god god called you now he called abraham and he's the father of us all the faith notice now he said abraham now it's election i want to know if you can say amen to that it is election election is god's choosing and god chooses based on what he knows about you before you are ever manifested in this earth hallelujah it's not that god didn't give you a choice it's that he knew your choice before the foundation of the world and by that choice he predestinated you and elected you to a grace that neither of us deserve he said i want to get on that election because it's the truth he said now you didn't become a christian just coincidence because you become a christian before you was in this world now don't don't think for one moment that he is teaching you you didn't have to have the grace of god in the blood of jesus christ no no no no he's telling you god knew exactly what you were going to do before you got here and your life was perfect there's very few of us that would say i've lived i've had a perfect life because we're measuring see how quiet it is because we're measuring perfection by what we had did i have a loving mother did i have a loving father did i had a steady home environment was there no alcohol were there no vices in my home did everybody love each other and smooch each other all the time that's what we're looking for in a perfect life that's not the one god promised you but i tell you if he knew your choice before the foundation of the world he gave you a life that would bring you to him in this critical hour you don't have to say man you can't change the word you're here this morning because god has led you this way by his sovereign grace you believe what you believe you testify of what you testify because god's allowed circumstances of your life to line up in such a way that sometimes he has led us and sometimes he squeezed us sometimes he led us gently and sometimes he squeezed us rather tightly to bring us to a place like this he had to do it for the children of israel are you still with me he said now but your he goes on he said oh you say is that right brother that's the truth god before there was ever before there was ever you before you knowed anything let me let me help the situation out there just a little bit before you note anything and that's the truth i believe it he goes on oh no that's the end of that one look at romans chapter 5 with me just a moment romans 5 17 how important is grace the spirit of grace in our life without it we're not saved that's what we're looking at right now romans 5 17 says for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ how many of you follow the word there for if one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ folks we have received an abundance of grace we have received a gift of righteousness we're a blessed people the amplified says it this way for if because of one's one man's trespass lapse offense death reigned through that one much more surely will those who receive god's overflowing grace unmerited favor and the free gift of righteousness putting them into right standing with himself reign as kings in life through the one man jesus christ the messiah and the anointed one i want to read this in in weymouth for just a moment i don't know if i i don't know if i gave you that or not but in the weymouth translation it says this way for if through the transgression of the one individual death made use of the one individual to see sovereignty all the more shall those who receive god's overflowing grace it's not a trickle of grace that you and i have received it's an overflowing and abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness we reign as kings in life through the one individual jesus christ the work is done romans 5 21 if you'll give that to me quickly i'll hurry in the in the king james that as sin has rained unto death even so might grace reign there's a redeeming authority in your life it's not death there's a reigning authority in your life it's not sin there's a reigning authority in your life it's not the old nature the reigning authority in your life is grace he said that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord by the spirit of grace you can show us in the amplified he said so that justice sin has reigned in death so grace his unearned and undeserved favor might reign also through righteousness which is right standing with god which issues which issues in eternal life through jesus christ the messiah the anointed one our lord contending for the faith look at this 1956. we are tempted you believe that all of us are tempted all of us sin there's none without sin every day we sin now you know if you have a traditional church mentality of what sin is you might not understand that message because i came from a pentecostal holiness tradition where everything was sin right we couldn't keep up with each other sin because we would go to one church and they believed that it was sin for a woman not to wear a hat this was pentecostal churches i believe it was sin and you'd go to another church and i heard them preach my grandmother was with me i heard them preach it for a woman to wear a hat in church with sin now what's a woman to do we were in churches where they preached that it was sin to drink a coca-cola but all right to have an rc cola don't laugh too hard it's the truth that's where some of us come from my granny tells a story i've told you many times through the year she had an evangelist in the church in blue springs he says before she came to the message and stepped aside but she was pastoring then and she had an evangelist there and he got up that night and he preached so hard on coca-cola he said the church is full of cocaine addicts and my granny was working in a cotton mill and driving all the way to blue spring springs alabama night after night after night for revival and coming home working the cotton meal and going back she was tired she said to the brother as they pulled in a little a gas station there on the highway coming home down through eufaula she said brother i'm so sorry i wouldn't offend you for anything but she said i don't drink coffee but she said i think if i could just she was doing the driving they're sitting in the back she said i believe if i could just get a cold coca-cola i believe it would help keep me awake and i could drive us on home this used to get her i wish you could tell it or it used to get her she turned purple when she tell it and she he said oh no sister mildred that won't offend us and all my wife and i'll have a double cola she said i said all right i shut the door and she said as i walked into that store a double coal cola double cola and she said i got in there and i got that double cola and it said twice the punch of a coca-cola she said i realized he was more offended by the name than he was the ingredient you see it was such a time period where everybody was looking for what they might do or not do because they didn't want to be offensive to the lord they were sincere in their heart one of the struggles i had when i came to hear brother branham's message was i heard him say one dime time early he said why there's only one sin i said not at my church there's only one sin i turned it off i thought sure this is heresy there could not be one sin we've got hundreds of sins and we don't wish some we're not sure about so there may be thousands of sin and you know what he brought us right back to the word this is important for somebody he brought us right back to the word and showed us what sin is some of these things may be the attributes of sin but sin is unbelief the bible tells us that the root of everything that is against god or ungodly is unbelief and so you may not struggle with whether or not to drink a coca-cola and you may not struggle with whether or not to do this to your hair do that or to do the other but i want you to know where the enemy tempts us as a believer on a on a fairly regular basis brother bantam said here daily is will you believe god's word or will you yield to how you feel will you yield to fear or will you take the high road of faith come on will you choose to take god's word over what the news says over what your body will tell you over what the enemy will whisper in your ear we are tempted every day to cooperate with unbelief and it is a believer's authority there's a there is an authority by the spirit of grace in you that will raise up in you if you yield to it and it'll answer that accuser it'll answer that suggestion it'll answer that temptation of the enemy every time i choose to believe god's word i choose to believe god's word i don't know about you but i know many people fighting covet and that pain that little tightness be in their chest and the devil would start whispering to him everything better be set in order you better make sure you sure did want to put in a garden next year all the things will start coming to your mind and if you cooperate with that more than 30 seconds if you cooperate with that thing it'll take you down a trail with so many switchbacks you may never find your way back to faith so you've got to shut that thing off you've got to cut the enemy off of the past is anybody hearing what i'm saying today and you've got to say wait a minute enemy wait a minute devil i'm going to stand on god's word i'm not leaving this world 30 minutes before god calls me no cancer no covet no accident no heart attack it's going to take me out of this life one minute before he calls me you tell him i'm not going to serve a god now this is bold no no you better let me do this i've told him this before lord i could not serve a god who created an enemy to be more powerful than he is it's quiet the prophet taught us he's just a tool that enemy is just a tool in the hand of god to bring the saints to perfection which is the fullness of faith gets a little sticky don't it let's keep pressing through it the enemy's defeated he'll tell you all kinds of tales if you listen he'll tempt you yes paul said we had to die daily what is that death i thought he died for us that's not the death we're talking about that's the truth that's making a choice i'm choosing every day to let what i want die and let his will live and prevail somebody said but i don't know his will you will always find his will in his word you don't find his will and a gift if there is a gift you must bring that gift back to the word if there's a dream the dream comes back to the word if there's a vision the vision comes back to the word if there's a prophecy the prophecy comes back to the word the word is the absolute it keeps us on the right path oh yes and if we say we sin and have no sin then the bible says we make god to lie and we could not do that so we sin daily that's unbelief we make the wrong choice we have to catch ourselves but it's grace god's grace that saves us and if and as we confess our wrongs god is just to forgive them and your can you listen to the holy ghost some of you might not need to be drinking coca-cola you heard the healthy friends didn't you amen i heard mimi amen i can just about tell you right now you don't need to you listen you listen to the voice of the spirit of god in you he'll he'll quicken you like i preached last sunday there are things the spirit of god will correct you on you need to do it you need to obey him you need to hear his voice and you don't need to look around to see what somebody else is doing about it you need to be obedient i don't want to hear no more but so and so does you're not so-and-so you're god's chosen he didn't call you to live by somebody else's standard he called you to live by the word so you listen to him and all those little things that god will talk to you about your life but i want to tell you something you're going to have a full-time job making the right choice to choose faith every time to choose the word every time because he's going to come he's going to come he'll tell you nobody's going to know he'll tempt you to click on something and tell you that nobody's going to know and he'll tell you because you know how to erase your history you've got it whipped but that's not deliverance that's what adam was trying to do he was trying to hide from a god that was not coming to try to kill him and destroy him he was coming to try to give him something to cover up his nakedness with your god walked as a man and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he knows what it means to live in a body all men are tempted as we are yet without sin though he were son yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered he understands let me tell this church and those streaming this service today you serve a god who understands your struggle don't you run to the bush to hide when you recognize you've made a bad choice run to the cross run to christ run to the altar and it doesn't have to be a piece of wood up in the front of the church you build an altar here don't you wait to revival you make peace with god you cooperate with that grace of god as we confess our wrongs god is just to forgive them and your confession as long as it holds good your salvation is perfect same as it is with divine healing it's your personal faith in a resurrected lord jesus how many of you have personal faith can i read another one thank you i'm hurrying i really am it's 105. i got an hour abraham's seed paragraph 17. now jesus said and we wouldn't argue with him jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first then it was god knocking at your heart not you seeking god it was god seeking you so you see the covenant is to you also a grace covenant because it's god's grace calling you see you never chose him he chose you somebody said now is that really accurate oh yes he saw your choice you never chose him he chose you somebody said well how does that fit how does that work it works like this you chose him you were able by grace to choose him because you were chosen somebody said well that sounds a little bit like calvinism to me well i want you to know something don't ever get this picture in your mind that god lined up humanity and go went down the you can you can't you can you can't you can you can't that is not predestination by election well that was man's effort to try to understand the conflict but this was god knowing before you ever came into this earth your life your choice and by that he made a way for you now because you couldn't save yourself what did it your choice or his it was his if you could have saved yourself your choice could have been where your salvation was but since you and i couldn't save ourselves if he hadn't chose us we could have never chose him does that help anybody he said you never chose him he chose you out of the millions in the world today he reached down and shows you because he put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world i believe that i'm not going to back up on that one he said that's what the bible said before there was a world jesus was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world because when god speaks anything it's so perfect it has to be to take and place and it's as good as done when god speaks it [Music] lord i believe when you speak it it's done it's finished i believe that with all my heart titus 3 7 can you show that to us i'll do this verse and one more quote and we're going to let you go for the day titus 3 7 that being justified that being justified how by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life being justified by his grace if you're looking for it in your bible titus 3 7 that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life in the message hebrews chapter 2 paragraph 172 he said man always feared death christ became sin made low to take death upon himself and he's not ashamed to be called our brother for he was tempted just like we are tempted you know i never heard this i never heard this growing up it was always in the bible i never heard a preacher i never heard it preached that christ was tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin because the the church couldn't reconcile their concept of him and what the bible said about him they didn't want anybody thinking that he could have been tempted in the same manner than a mortal man here on the earth could be tempted because they thought that would that would take him down that would that would cause him to look lower than the deity that he was they didn't understand the divine connection between god man they didn't understand that this was the word but the word chose god himself chose to condescend he chose the body that he lived in and it was a body of flesh and in that body he was tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin some people today still struggle with the idea you mean that christ god living in a man and that man could have struggled with what you and i struggle with if he could not have then we don't have a high priest he was created thus that his mind could operate in this earthly body that he was given it could operate like your mind operates and it could drift yet without sin he was tempted in all manners we are yet without sin for he was tempted just like we are tempted let's go on and he and he can be the right kind of an intercessor because he stood the same kind of a temptation that you stand and he took your place knowing that you couldn't take it yourself i think everybody ought to like that he took my place he took my place he took my place so don't you see brother sister the whole thing is what grace do you know grace grace who amazing grace the whole thing is grace all of it is grace it's not what you do anyhow it's what he's already done for you it's not on you brother now you can't do one thing to merit your salvation i know this just oh does this ever just go against the grain of all of us who have tried so hard to earn his salvation all of us who spent so many years of our life trying to make ourselves good enough and we just never to feel never ever could feel many of us were tormented in our minds i told you i would call my granny and she wouldn't answer the phone and fear would strike my heart i've missed it because i had no peace i did not understand what had been done i didn't know what i had done i i didn't have some big reason why i thought i missed it i just figured if she was gone she was gone i had more confidence in her walk with god than i had with my own evidently i had a lot to unlearn so that i could learn of him there may be some still struggling but i can just help you this morning by telling her this afternoon now i can just help you to tell you that on your best day you didn't deserve what you got you can follow all the rules and not deserve him the whole thing is grace all of it is grace it's not what you do it's what he's already done for you now you can't do one thing to merit your salvation your salvation is a gift christ became sin that you might become righteous don't you think for one minute that that grace gives you a license to choose what you want the grace that god gives us does not give us liberty to choose sin to choose unbelief to choose a life that points people away from the cross that grace gives us victory to live a life that reflects the character of christ and what he has done on our behalf now you can't do one thing to merit your salvation your salvation is a gift christ became sin that you might become righteous read on and he's the right kind of a chief captain for our salvation because he suffered just like we've suffered he's been tempted just like we're tempted and he's not ashamed to be called our brother because he knows what we go through with oh blessed be his name for verily he took not on him the form of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham oh my he didn't become an angel he became the seed of abraham and we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise see he never took on the form of an angel he never become an angel he became a man he become the seed of abraham and took the sting of death in his own flesh to reconcile us back to god and now sets there for an intercessor bye this is a great question my how could we reject it friend how could anybody reject the gift that he has given to us the musicians are coming this is not a license you must understand it is not a license i woke up this morning the scripture rolling over in my mind love not the world neither the things that are in the world or of the world because if you love this world there's an enmity there there is a warfare there is a strife that goes on because you cannot love god with your whole heart and love this world too is that right so what do i do if i find myself in that position you get a hold of grace you find where she lives and i say she only as the analogy for d.l moody asking he got to studying on that grace of god and he ran out in the street found the first person he came to he said hey do you know grace grace who amazing grace it's not something you go find somewhere it's something that's living in you by the power of the holy ghost how many of you are thankful for it let's sing amazing grace i'm going to let you i'm going to let you hold your seat just a minute i want us to sing amazing grace then we're going to sing something else see what the lord has for us my old friend brother merle said brother steve i tell people i'm the happiest guy on earth oh we ought to be how many of you can say i ought to be the happiest man when i look and see what the lord has done for me oh he's been so good for me amazing grace how sweet the sound that's a wrench like me [Music] i once was lost but now i'm found oh i was blind but now [Music] i see sing it out towards grace twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears [Music] that grace [Music] this is your story singing through many many dangers oils i have i have [Music] disgrace that's [Applause]

praise god if you're here this morning [Music] and you'd say brother i i feel a mess i just don't have peace i must not be yielding to the grace of god the spirit of grace that's in my life i know i'm his child but i don't have peace how many of you know if if you're his he brings peace now the enemy is a great disturber of peace he wants to disturb your peace there's no shame in in in having a disturbance but it'd be shameful for you to stay that way you absolutely do not have to i just wonder if you if you're just troubled you just have no peace right now you you need the lord you need the spirit of grace to just break forth in your life and you're willing to just say to him i gotta have help from you lord and i gotta have it now is there someone feels like that you just slip up your hand god bless you i see several hands there's no shame again i want to make sure you understand this there's no shame in this it's just fighting this battle we're making it and i know for every hand that went up in here there's dozens who are watching this service across the world i saw pakistan and india and iceland and ireland and japan it goes on and on canada and so many and i know that it's not just alabamians who have their peace disturbed at times what i feel led of the lord to do this morning is invite those of you who raised your hand you meant it i know you did and we've covered the fact there's no shame to say i gotta have a touch of his grace breaking forth in my life to bring me back to peace i'd like for you to just walk up this way just stand around we're not going to come and bother you in any way we're just going to agree with you that god give you peace i don't believe it's the will of god for his children not to have peace especially when they come together in fellowship with him and with brothers and sisters and we want to see peace in your life [Music] amazing grace how sweet [Music] anybody else want to join them like me i was was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see praise god praise god hallelujah i would like that every every brother standing here have at least one brother behind him maybe even two would you come and help us do that i would like to see that every sister here had at least one or two sisters standing behind them just to remind them you're not in this alone this is what we can do for one another praise god god we're just coming just soft we're just coming to show our love and support for one another we're not coming because we think we're superior and we don't struggle we're coming to say i've been there i know what it's like to have your peace disturbed and i want to join my faith with your faith and those of you still at your seat you can reach your hand this way and you can reach your faith this way toward the brothers and the sisters and let us believe right now that faith will rise up and overcome any doubt that the enemy might be trying to send we know the one who comes to disturb peace but lord we also know the one that comes to speak peace so we're praying right now let's do it together father in the name of the lord jesus christ these are our brothers and sisters the ground is level at the foot of the cross and there are no no big eyes and little yous there are no big saints and little saints we come today lord knowing that you love each and every one of us the same and you have called us to be overcomers and these precious brothers and sisters have said that the enemy is oppressing them in some way and causing their peace to escape them and causing a disturbance in their inner being and we're not surprised because that's the enemy and he's always on the job but we know today that we have something that we can do about that you have redeemed us by the blood of the lamb and these children of god that are standing before the altar today i personally know they have been to calvary i know they have called on the blood of the lamb i know they've been washed i know they have received full salvation and so now lord because the spirit of god dwells in them i'm asking you right now to give them strength to push doubt out of the way to push the enemy back into his place to decree in faith greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world we rebuke the devourer in the name of the lord jesus christ we take authority over his evil hand lord we pray for ian right now it's not always like him to respond this way something's going on in his little life but i'm asking you lord to come and stand with him today manifest who you are rise up oh god you love him so much and you want to show yourself strong in his life we resist the enemy we rebuke him in the name of jesus christ lord we pray for nathan right now we lift him up to you you know exactly where he's standing you know exactly where his peace has been touched and we're asking right now is a body of believers that you will wrap your arms around him in a tangible way that you will speak peace to him and scatter every lying imp of hell that would talk to him in the name of the lord jesus christ let courage let faith oh god i thank you and i thank you that nathan would not be one of those israelites standing on the mountain watching somebody else face the giant but i happen to know by his own life that he would have been one of those that would have said i'll go down it's not about me this isn't my battle this is the lord's battle and it's the lord who gives the victory so i ask you to strengthen my brother today [Music] in the name of jesus in the name of jesus [Music] touch one another you brothers lay your hands on one another don't act like you don't know what these struggles are like these battles are lie we're not new to warfare lord in the name of jesus let victory rise up let it rise up oh let victory rise up hallelujah let peace follow you're the peace speaker the peace will come sarah the peace will come when you tell the lord you only want his perfect will when you tell the lord with every part of who you are that you only want his perfect will god will fill you with his peace and when i say tell him i mean you've got to bring it from the very depth of who you are and when you when you express that to him he'll bring that peace that passes all understanding and endures forever don't enter into a tug of war with the one who loves you so much just take your hands off of it and say lord i'm trusting you i'm putting my hope in you to touch my body oh god and to speak peace lord into every troubling situation i trust you i trust you oh lord we pray for sister sandy right now oh god that you will undergird her that you will strengthen her lord that you will wrap her in the robe of your righteousness hallelujah that every dart of the wicked one would bounce right off as she stands here today dressed in the whole armor of god in the name of jesus oh let victory break through the gloom oh god let there be peace when there is uncertainty let your peace arise when our minds are troubled let your peace arise [Laughter] in the name of the lord jesus [Music] we cannot do this without you lord we cannot do this without you lord but because of you we can face whatever the enemy comes hallelujah hallelujah anybody anybody got something to praise the lord for i feel him moving yes sir [Music] [Music] brother robert is standing in for his son jake and also for some men that he works with who have been in the hospital some of them over a week and are fighting and battling and they need the help of the lord would you join your faith with ours father we stand here as your children lord we lift up jake to you oh god we know you're doing something in his life we know the enemy could never just stand back and allow that to happen without putting up a fight but oh god we're asking you to make a way where there is no way to bring him out lord let your voice be louder than any voice that would speak in his life let him come all the way through to a new birth lord let something happen in his life that he'd be able to put down a stake and say this is where the lord met me yes oh god we pray for these co-workers that are fighting for their lives you see every detail you know exactly what's happening in their body we stand in faith we don't have to take the doctor's report we know what you can do we've seen what a healer you are

sing to him benjamin we talked about let's stay around the if you that are able let's stay around here just a moment and worship just a few more moments i want you to sing this and i don't want you to sing it just following the words but i want you to sing it right between you and him i want this to be the confession of your heart you are confessing with your heart that you have met the requirement the requirement is to believe the requirement is to repent the requirement is to use your faith to accept what the lord has done the requirement is to yield to the breath the spirit of grace in your life and when you're doing that you can say it as well it is well if there's one word that i'd like to scream across afghanistan if there's one theme i'd like to scream in every intensive care unit

back to your seats god bless you hallelujah we're going to dismiss you this morning sister did you have something i'm sorry i remembered and then i forgot of to go get the course and then she has fear that she doesn't need to get the shot so there's a lot of wavering in here sure if she knew that you prayed for her oh well then i'm glad to do it how many of you will help me pray for sister sharon's mother that the lord will give her peace she's going through a lot in her body and we just want to believe god to speak to all that fear and just give her peace and direction lord in the name of jesus lord you see this mother this elderly mother and lord you see her heart to bless other people and you know lord everything that goes on in her mind in her life and you know how the enemy would try to hinder her in any way because he hinders us all it's just it's his work it seems but lord i know that you're peace and i know you're the peace speaker and i know that you can direct her footsteps you can lead her you can help her to know what you would have her to do most of all lord you can speak a word and drive the very root of that fear to the surface and out of her life for the glory of god lord you can anoint her faith in such a way that she will no longer agree with fear but that faith would come out of her mouth because faith is settling every issue lord jesus we ask you to surround her right now in this hour cover her with your grace oh jesus let there be peace of mind and heart no matter what happens around her in the name of the lord jesus christ amen we want to pray for those yes who are in the path of the hurricane you know how i feel about those things we get uh notes from all over the world people asking us to pray against it to speak to it to tell it what to do but what i believe is that god is a god of the whirlwind name the prophet said he was and i believe god speaks and i believe what we should pray is lord watch over and protect innocent life thy will be done on earth even as it is in heaven i know some of you have loved ones in the way of that storm may we pray that god will cause them to run to him for safety come on he's the only storm shelter i know of that you can hide and be safe he's the only answer for all of these things if that unction of the lord should come on you you pray how the spirit of god leads you but sister kathy's asking us to pray for those who are in the path of that storm and we don't know what shifting it might make but we know that god is able would you just come into agreement with me right now lord we saw the devastation and the lives that were never quite the same because of storms like katrina and now lord we know that there's a storm once again in the gulf seems that it is increasing and heading toward louisiana mississippi and unless that thing would shift it looks like that we would maybe miss the impact of this one rain and wind maybe but that thing is projected to move all the way up to tennessee and lord we just know that you are sovereign in all things but what we like to do is what you taught us to do thy will be done on earth even as it is in heaven may people call on you may they look to you may they find strength to do the right thing may they use wisdom in dealing with something as fierce as a storm like this we pray for your bride who may be scattered in those areas that they would find shelter in you underneath are the everlasting arms you're there to hold them up and the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are saved lord as we prepare to go today we thank you that you're going with us to keep us to deal with our hearts lord bless every person who's been a part of this service bless them for their efforts and give us grace
