[35:42] lord this morning amen hallelujah
[35:45] i'm so thankful to be gathered this
[35:47] morning
[35:48] amen it's been too long
[35:50] i know there are many needs this morning
[35:52] many many more than i can remember
[35:56] remember all their suffering with the
[35:58] virus this morning recovering i know
[36:00] it's it's a tough road for a lot of
[36:02] people that are recovering this morning
[36:04] so let's remember do you have an
[36:05] unspoken need this morning by the
[36:06] lifting of your hand yeah there are many
[36:09] amen
[36:10] would you remember sister pam hendrix to
[36:13] the lord in prayer that god will touch
[36:16] her in a mighty way
[36:17] it seems that the lord is helping her
[36:20] and her family is being strengthened to
[36:23] put their trust and faith in the lord
[36:25] and i'm in a a little group
[36:28] where jacob is so faithful
[36:31] to uh
[36:32] update us about four or five times a day
[36:35] and uh
[36:37] she's doing a little better every every
[36:39] report getting a little better so we
[36:41] want to believe the lord
[36:43] and i want you to pray specifically
[36:45] against blood clots i know that the lord
[36:47] is able to keep that
[36:49] out of her body and out of her life
[36:52] as they turn her back and forth this is
[36:54] a very dangerous part of the ventilator
[36:57] it's laying on your stomach is what they
[36:59] found to be most effective for covid
[37:02] when you lay on your back your lungs
[37:04] flatten against your
[37:06] the back of your rib cage and so when
[37:08] you're on the
[37:09] uh ventilator like that they like to
[37:11] turn you over and the problem is after
[37:13] someone
[37:14] lays like that all night long especially
[37:16] someone of size then when you turn them
[37:19] back over it's if if a blood clot is
[37:21] formed it has a tendency to move
[37:23] toward an extremity so may god bring her
[37:27] through
[37:28] with complete and total victory and may
[37:31] they be so on fire for the lord
[37:35] i was praying and i remembered how
[37:37] fired up they were when god healed casey
[37:40] hannah and i know that god can bring her
[37:44] through and give them that same kind of
[37:46] fire that's what we're asking the lord
[37:49] would you remember a friend of many of
[37:51] us
[37:52] the regina christian who is in the
[37:54] hospital and she was doing better but
[37:58] her oxygen levels are going up and down
[38:00] which is really sort of common when
[38:02] you're fighting the virus
[38:04] but they're offering her a ventilator
[38:06] and she's not ready to make that
[38:08] decision so could we ask the lord to
[38:11] stabilize those blood oxygen levels for
[38:14] her that she would not have to make a
[38:16] decision like that sister rebecca
[38:18] shepard needs to be remembered to the
[38:20] lord in prayer there i think they're
[38:22] doing better from all the other fights
[38:24] but her
[38:25] sugar level she has low blood sugar and
[38:28] it's causing her to feel very weak
[38:30] olivia
[38:32] ellsworth is running a low-grade fever
[38:34] and having a sore throat so we want to
[38:36] lift her up to the lord in prayer and
[38:38] ginger has many needs and she's been
[38:41] fighting a real battle with her vehicle
[38:44] and
[38:45] you know for me
[38:47] i just get mine repaired and i have a
[38:49] credit card if i have to do it but you
[38:52] know someone in in her position she
[38:54] would just
[38:55] turn purple if she was here
[38:58] it's a struggle because you're you don't
[39:00] know where to take it who to take it to
[39:02] and you you don't know how you're going
[39:03] to make it happen when it so would you
[39:05] just ask the lord to give her such grace
[39:08] and favor and victory would you continue
[39:11] to remember more reigns to the lord and
[39:14] and brother cary to the lord and so many
[39:17] others that are fighting the weakness
[39:18] and the fatigue and of course we're
[39:20] going to pray for those that that fought
[39:22] their way to get here today we folks we
[39:25] have so much to be thankful for
[39:29] so much to be thankful for if you don't
[39:31] believe it let me suggest a few websites
[39:34] to you later you come ask me privately
[39:36] and i'll suggest a few websites and you
[39:38] can go and visit our sister churches
[39:40] around the country and you'll see a
[39:42] funeral after a funeral after a funeral
[39:44] after a funeral in the last three weeks
[39:47] and we're so blessed we have nothing to
[39:49] brag about except jesus
[39:52] and and i know i know that they had the
[39:55] same jesus we do so so i am not in any
[39:58] way saying anything except your goodness
[40:01] is running after me
[40:04] all my life you have been faithful
[40:08] i said it in october when we lost our
[40:11] brother i would say it regardless of the
[40:13] circumstances god is
[40:16] faithful
[40:17] prayer works
[40:19] and god's will is being accomplished but
[40:22] we don't want to forget those that are
[40:24] battling it it is not an it is not an
[40:27] easy thing to go through
[40:29] and everyone is affected differently i
[40:31] just want to get all this out of the way
[40:33] before i take the pulpit everyone is
[40:35] affected differently and that worries
[40:37] people sometimes
[40:38] you know what i didn't have it like that
[40:40] or i had it worse or or you're just
[40:43] we're just different
[40:44] and it strikes us different it affects
[40:46] us different you don't have to feel like
[40:48] that if you're here and you think well i
[40:51] surely give it to somebody
[40:53] we have no way of calculating all that
[40:56] the way it looks to me in my mind it
[40:58] came to us in more than one direction
[41:01] from more than one direction
[41:03] and it had to happen this way now we're
[41:06] getting our antibodies up getting ready
[41:08] for camp meeting if that's the will of
[41:10] god
[41:11] there's a reason for all things so if
[41:13] you're here and you feel like well i
[41:15] surely give i know i hug so i know i did
[41:17] listen if you would have known that you
[41:20] would have never done something
[41:23] somebody said oh but i came to church
[41:24] with the fever i didn't know i didn't
[41:27] if you would have known
[41:29] i don't believe there's a person here
[41:31] this morning that would have wanted to
[41:33] give it
[41:35] especially after coming through it you
[41:37] wouldn't want to would you i know you
[41:39] didn't want to so there's no reason to
[41:42] spend too much time
[41:44] now anytime trying to figure it all out
[41:47] it's all the grace of god and god is
[41:50] speaking he is speaking he uses all
[41:53] things to talk and he is talking may god
[41:56] give us ears to hear eyes to see and
[42:00] come through this with great victory and
[42:03] and uh others i could go on that
[42:05] requested prayer but
[42:06] we all have unspoken requests for sure
[42:09] what about the rabbi
[42:11] i haven't had a report today from rabbi
[42:14] friedman but thank you for mentioning
[42:16] that he was on a ventilator he was not
[42:19] doing well
[42:20] the
[42:21] fires around the hills of jerusalem

[42:26] after acre the question is now saying
[42:28] now will will jerusalem's hills ever
[42:31] recover from this kind of a fire it was
[42:33] closing in on the on the hospital they
[42:36] thought they were going to have to
[42:37] evacuate the rabbi and all the other
[42:39] people but god made a way and they were
[42:42] able to turn the fire back but
[42:44] he's still critical and needs to be

[1:00:40] we certainly
[1:00:41] recognize that
[1:00:44] some of you are not able to be here but
[1:00:46] you are here anyway
[1:00:48] we will say for the sake of the video
[1:00:50] you are out of quarantine
[1:00:53] but you are not 100
[1:00:55] we acknowledge that we understand that
[1:00:58] and we give god praise for your faith
[1:01:02] and for you fighting your way to the
[1:01:03] house of god
[1:01:05] and i know that it honors the lord and i
[1:01:08] know that he will touch you because of
[1:01:09] that sacrifice
[1:01:11] i heard the prophet say today that we
[1:01:14] must be faithful
[1:01:16] we must push through everything that
[1:01:18] stands in our way we must be faithful to
[1:01:20] god and his house he said
[1:01:23] if you didn't believe that i know there
[1:01:25] are many of you who wouldn't be here
[1:01:26] today so may god bless you
[1:01:29] we will do our best to minister god's
[1:01:31] word to you and then let you go home
[1:01:34] and take your rest
[1:01:35] we understand that that is a very
[1:01:37] important part of this process
[1:01:40] i remember what it felt like to have
[1:01:42] good days and bad days
[1:01:44] and i don't want to say anything over
[1:01:46] you because everybody is different
[1:01:49] but i can tell you that three months
[1:01:51] later
[1:01:52] i could still have a bad day
[1:01:54] everything good everything good for all
[1:01:57] week and it just hit me sister beth is
[1:01:59] shaking her head they don't understand
[1:02:02] that part of the virus they don't
[1:02:03] understand why it does that way but as
[1:02:06] long as some of that remains in your
[1:02:08] system it can do that but we know that
[1:02:11] god can drive every bit of it out of
[1:02:14] your body for the grace of god
[1:02:18] we appreciate it we weren't sick this
[1:02:20] time but we got a lot of sympathy anyway
[1:02:23] in that something
[1:02:25] we had so many people text us and say we
[1:02:27] dropped the ball
[1:02:29] we had no idea what it felt like when
[1:02:31] you all were sick and we dropped the
[1:02:34] ball we wish we could go back and do it
[1:02:36] over again we would have at least called
[1:02:38] a little more
[1:02:39] there were those who took precious care
[1:02:41] of us and we thank you for that
[1:02:43] sister kathy was the first to arrive at
[1:02:45] the porch with all kinds of things to
[1:02:47] help us
[1:02:48] i pray that you have had what you needed
[1:02:51] we've tried to help or at least offer to
[1:02:53] help as many of you as we possibly could
[1:02:56] we know that others have been there to
[1:02:58] help you we know that some of you could
[1:03:00] have been in the hospital but god's
[1:03:02] grace
[1:03:03] kept you home
[1:03:05] we know that sister elfrida refused to
[1:03:07] stay
[1:03:08] they tried to keep her
[1:03:10] she had to sign her way out but she just
[1:03:13] signed her way out
[1:03:14] she went to the she went to the greely
[1:03:17] sick house
[1:03:17] [Laughter]
[1:03:20] and uh
[1:03:21] well i may or may not have seen a
[1:03:23] picture
[1:03:24] but i won't go into any details this
[1:03:26] morning but they were all under the
[1:03:28] weather and sister joyce had to to still
[1:03:32] try to take care of them as she could
[1:03:34] and make them breakfast and do things
[1:03:36] but they just were sick together and god
[1:03:39] made a way and as soon as they dropped
[1:03:42] sister elfrida off and she could get in
[1:03:44] her car she drove up here and she wanted
[1:03:46] to testify to me of the miracle that god
[1:03:49] had performed in her life she is not 100
[1:03:52] like most who are here but she knows
[1:03:54] that god has done a work and has brought
[1:03:56] her through we're believing the lord to
[1:03:58] finish that work for so many of you i
[1:04:01] know it's hard on menfolk i know it's
[1:04:03] particularly hard on them they're not
[1:04:05] used to being down they're they're used
[1:04:07] to working they're used to doing what
[1:04:09] needs to be done and sometimes it
[1:04:11] strikes them particularly hard but we
[1:04:14] know that god's going to bring every one
[1:04:16] of them through with the victory and i'm
[1:04:18] not kidding when i tell you this church
[1:04:20] is blessed
[1:04:21] and i i hesitated i had been hesitating
[1:04:24] to say anything much about it in the
[1:04:27] streams but the lord rebuked me and he
[1:04:30] said don't you be afraid to give me
[1:04:32] praise
[1:04:33] for bringing you through
[1:04:36] and so i said lord forgive me that
[1:04:38] wasn't my intention
[1:04:40] but we ought to give him praise
[1:04:43] i texted brother steve
[1:04:45] polk one day and he was already back to
[1:04:47] work and he said he called me right back

[1:04:56] ever heard in your life praising the
[1:04:58] lord he said you hear that
[1:05:00] that's what god has done

[1:06:29] and on saturday is martha west's
[1:06:32] birthday so we want to hold her up to
[1:06:34] the lord believe that god will touch her
[1:06:37] as of this morning
[1:06:39] uh you have given toward the principal
[1:06:45] eight 126
[1:06:45] and thirty two dollars and forty eight
[1:06:48] cents shouldn't we give god some praise
[1:06:50] for that
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:57] and uh you know when we started this
[1:06:59] process brother greeley told you up
[1:07:02] front in march
[1:07:04] that if there came a time that we got in
[1:07:07] a situation where we had to redirect
[1:07:09] that we would let you know
[1:07:11] and i'm only here to tell you this
[1:07:13] quickly
[1:07:14] and that is we will not be able to make
[1:07:17] the
[1:07:18] regular monthly payment
[1:07:21] in addition
[1:07:22] to the principal payments that we have
[1:07:24] been making this month
[1:07:26] we are a little bit low
[1:07:28] and that is simply because of the delay
[1:07:32] in the online giving so the payment is
[1:07:34] made but that is not an additional
[1:07:38] payment and uh we normally make a 4100
[1:07:42] payment extra
[1:07:43] above and beyond what you give toward
[1:07:46] the principle we will not be able to do
[1:07:48] that just now but as soon as we can uh
[1:07:51] we would like to do that because that
[1:07:54] just keeps dropping it down
[1:07:56] now of that 4 100
[1:07:59] payment that we make every month the
[1:08:02] principal is getting higher and the
[1:08:04] interest is getting lower so this
[1:08:06] month's principal out of the 41 the
[1:08:10] principal portion of that was 2
[1:08:12] 357
[1:08:15] and 2 cent
[1:08:16] so we can say that we're over half
[1:08:19] over half
[1:08:21] toward that
[1:08:22] payment from that payment over half of
[1:08:25] it now is going toward the principle so
[1:08:28] god is good if you feel led to help us
[1:08:31] in in some way then you you can
[1:08:33] certainly do that but but you people
[1:08:35] have done that again and again and i
[1:08:37] know our business is going out all over
[1:08:39] the internet
[1:08:40] but it's really we don't really have a
[1:08:42] private time to talk to you do we so
[1:08:45] this is what it is
[1:08:46] if you're able this morning i'd like to
[1:08:49] ask you to stand for the word i won't
[1:08:50] make any additional comments while

[1:11:05] a promise
[1:11:07] directly made to the children of the
[1:11:10] promise
[1:11:11] the children of israel the hebrew people
[1:11:14] but it's our promise
[1:11:16] as the royal and spiritual seed of
[1:11:19] abraham
[1:11:20] we also have a promised land
[1:11:23] and we're on our way to that promised
[1:11:25] land even this morning can you say amen
[1:11:29] one more place before we take our seat
[1:11:32] and that is hebrews chapter 10.
[1:11:35] and we're going to read a lot of
[1:11:37] scripture in the next few services so if
[1:11:39] you've got a real bible with you
[1:11:41] or or you have one you still own one
[1:11:44] bring it with you because you might want
[1:11:46] to underline a verse you might want to
[1:11:49] mark something
[1:11:50] hebrews 10 verse 28 and 29 he that
[1:11:54] despised moses law died without mercy
[1:12:00] under two or three
[1:12:02] witnesses
[1:12:04] i think that's an important verse i
[1:12:06] think it's important for you to know
[1:12:08] that in the time of moses there were
[1:12:11] those who despised the instruction who
[1:12:15] died and were punished for their for
[1:12:17] their denial for their rebellion for
[1:12:20] their sin everybody didn't trust the
[1:12:23] covenant that god had made everybody
[1:12:25] didn't follow the prophet that god had
[1:12:28] raised up and some lost their lives and
[1:12:31] they lost their eternal reward because
[1:12:34] of it now the apostle goes on to say of
[1:12:38] how much more
[1:12:41] sorer punishment
[1:12:43] suppose ye
[1:12:45] shall he be thought worthy
[1:12:48] who hath trodden underfoot
[1:12:51] the son of god
[1:12:53] and hath counted the blood of the
[1:12:56] covenant wherewith he was sanctified set
[1:13:00] apart
[1:13:01] an unholy thing and hath done despite
[1:13:07] unto
[1:13:08] the spirit
[1:13:09] of grace
[1:13:11] i need to read it again
[1:13:13] of how much
[1:13:14] sorrow punishment suppose ye
[1:13:17] shall he be thought worthy
[1:13:19] who hath trodden underfoot the son of
[1:13:22] god
[1:13:23] and hath counted the blood of the
[1:13:25] covenant wherewith he was sanctified an
[1:13:28] unholy thing
[1:13:30] and hath done despite
[1:13:32] unto the spirit of grace
[1:13:35] father we thank you this morning

[1:13:56] the believer even right now how we thank
[1:14:00] you for your word how it is unfolding
[1:14:04] how you are answering the questions of
[1:14:06] our heart and how you are giving us
[1:14:09] faith to exercise the word and now we
[1:14:13] need you to come and strengthen your
[1:14:15] people
[1:14:16] from the top of their head to the souls
[1:14:18] of their feet
[1:14:20] we pray that the anointing of the holy
[1:14:23] spirit would touch every cell
[1:14:26] we pray lord that you would touch every
[1:14:28] system
[1:14:30] we ask that your breath
[1:14:32] your life would go down through the
[1:14:35] respiratory systems of their body
[1:14:39] and that you would restore even damage
[1:14:43] that has happened because of this virus
[1:14:47] multiply good and healthy cells
[1:14:50] we speak to the fatigue
[1:14:53] to the weakness to the weariness to the
[1:14:56] heaviness physically and even
[1:14:58] spiritually that can hang on after
[1:15:02] coming through a trauma like this
[1:15:04] pandemic and we decree and declare in
[1:15:08] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:10] that there will be restoration
[1:15:12] and not only restoration but we speak
[1:15:16] that there will be restitution
[1:15:18] to everybody who has experienced this
[1:15:22] time

[1:15:34] ears to hear your voice

[1:15:41] voice and to move forward into what you
[1:15:44] have called us for
[1:15:45] we give you praise honor and glory
[1:15:50] beshem adonai
[1:15:51] hamashiach
[1:15:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:15:55] pray
[1:15:56] amen and the saint said
[1:15:59] amen you may be seated this morning
[1:16:01] those of you that have strength use it
[1:16:05] support your pastor and support the word
[1:16:08] and fill in for those who aren't able to
[1:16:10] do it this morning amen
[1:16:12] they would if they could
[1:16:15] now we are
[1:16:18] for
[1:16:19] in
[1:16:21] to our study
[1:16:23] last week the spirit of holiness
[1:16:27] we are moving this morning into number
[1:16:29] five of the seven offices of the holy
[1:16:31] ghost
[1:16:32] the spirit of grace
[1:16:35] we may come back tuesday night and
[1:16:37] finish a portion that we missed on the
[1:16:41] spirit of holiness
[1:16:43] but i felt like that it is by the spirit
[1:16:46] of grace that we are gathered here today
[1:16:49] and i thought that we should declare it
[1:16:51] just declare it we're here by grace
[1:16:54] we have come this far leaning on the
[1:16:57] lord are you with me trusting in his
[1:17:00] holy word he's never failed us to this
[1:17:04] point we have no reason to believe he
[1:17:06] will fail us in the future
[1:17:09] he's going to be faithful the question
[1:17:11] is not whether or not god is going to be
[1:17:14] faithful the question is are you
[1:17:17] are you going to be faithful i have to
[1:17:19] ask myself am i going to be faithful not
[1:17:22] just when it's convenient but in all
[1:17:25] things faithful to him he's a good god
[1:17:28] he's a good god
[1:17:30] we're just going to do just a moment of
[1:17:32] review here
[1:17:34] in the in the
[1:17:35] brief explanation
[1:17:38] of these spirits that we have covered
[1:17:40] thus far number one we preached on the
[1:17:43] spirit of life
[1:17:44] the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:17:46] functioning in you as the spirit of life
[1:17:50] is to create or to recreate god's divine
[1:17:56] life in you
[1:17:59] the spirit of life by the holy ghost is
[1:18:02] present in the believer
[1:18:04] to create or recreate
[1:18:07] god's divine life in us that sounds good
[1:18:12] to me
[1:18:13] number two the spirit of truth
[1:18:15] by the holy ghost
[1:18:17] brings us to a more perfect revelation
[1:18:22] of god and his word
[1:18:24] number three the spirit of adoption
[1:18:28] works patiently in us how many of you
[1:18:31] are glad for the patiently part
[1:18:33] he works patiently in us why how would
[1:18:36] he know how would he know that he has to
[1:18:38] be patient because god lived in a body
[1:18:40] of flesh
[1:18:42] god lived in a body with mind will and
[1:18:44] emotions
[1:18:46] god lived in a body who fought the
[1:18:49] things that the average man or woman
[1:18:52] fights today so the spirit of adoption
[1:18:55] by the holy ghost works patiently in us
[1:18:59] until we can be called the sons of god
[1:19:02] or until we can be called the sons of
[1:19:05] knowledge those who have
[1:19:07] come all the way up into the fullness of
[1:19:10] who god is and his word
[1:19:13] and then we covered the spirit of
[1:19:15] holiness
[1:19:17] and the spirit of holiness by the holy
[1:19:19] ghost causes our relationship to grow
[1:19:23] into the realization and the revelation
[1:19:27] of his holiness
[1:19:30] if it were not for the spirit of
[1:19:32] holiness working in you by the holy
[1:19:35] ghost you would never be able to catch a
[1:19:37] glimpse of who he is and how he is holy
[1:19:41] he is holy
[1:19:43] he's holy
[1:19:44] he's holy
[1:19:46] there's nothing in him that's not holy
[1:19:49] there's nothing he says that's not holy
[1:19:51] there's nothing he does that is not holy
[1:19:54] he is the highest holiness
[1:19:58] and so we glimpse that we catch that
[1:20:01] because there's a spirit of holiness
[1:20:04] working in us by the holy ghost
[1:20:06] now we come to the spirit of grace if
[1:20:09] you want to write this
[1:20:10] we come to the spirit of grace and the
[1:20:12] spirit of grace is working in us
[1:20:16] by the holy ghost to govern
[1:20:20] our attitudes
[1:20:25] to govern our attitudes and actions
[1:20:29] to govern the attitude and the actions
[1:20:33] of the believer
[1:20:35] who are learning to walk by the spirit
[1:20:39] and not by the flesh
[1:20:41] we're still learning
[1:20:43] we're still learning to walk by the
[1:20:45] spirit we have to make choices every day
[1:20:48] amen i just had all kinds of texts i
[1:20:52] just had all kinds of things happen the
[1:20:54] last three weeks
[1:20:55] can i share them
[1:20:58] will it offend you if if yours is
[1:21:00] mentioned
[1:21:04] i just had all kind of communication
[1:21:06] from people
[1:21:07] one day i don't know what the shift was
[1:21:10] but one day i had three people in 10
[1:21:12] minutes texting me and say are you
[1:21:14] worried
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:18] it's out of the blue are you worried
[1:21:23] can i just ask you don't tell me
[1:21:26] can i what would you like for me to
[1:21:28] answer
[1:21:31] someone's feeling a little uneasy and
[1:21:33] they text their pastor and they say
[1:21:35] brother shelly are you worried
[1:21:41] what do you want me to say
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:45] well what if i'm worried
[1:21:48] thank you for helping me thank you for
[1:21:50] having me
[1:21:51] what am i supposed to say
[1:21:56] if i am worried
[1:21:57] i can't lie
[1:22:00] so you know what i had to do i had to
[1:22:02] pray
[1:22:04] i feel i feel a little worn out myself
[1:22:06] this morning not like you i know but i'd
[1:22:09] be a little worn out i wonder if he gets
[1:22:11] tired of hearing from us
[1:22:14] because i had to i had to pray hard
[1:22:16] because i didn't want to worry
[1:22:18] because i didn't know if the next day
[1:22:20] i'd get the same text and i'd have to
[1:22:22] answer again i'm not worried and you
[1:22:25] know what he kicked in oh thank you lord
[1:22:29] only two times did the enemy overcome my
[1:22:32] mind for just a short period of time he
[1:22:35] overcome me for just a few minutes and
[1:22:38] then the holy ghost kicked in
[1:22:40] and i began to to speak and prophesy and
[1:22:45] got in the vehicle and rode up and down
[1:22:47] the roads and prayed over people's
[1:22:48] houses and believed that god would bring
[1:22:52] you through
[1:22:54] because really worrying didn't help us
[1:22:58] and i know we're human beings and when
[1:23:00] worry comes we have to do you have to do
[1:23:03] what i have to do you got to say but
[1:23:05] lord i know your word is right
[1:23:10] when you get texts that say so-and-so
[1:23:12] doesn't know me
[1:23:15] so-and-so is so confused they don't even
[1:23:17] know who i am
[1:23:20] what would you say
[1:23:22] how would you feel
[1:23:24] we're human beings aren't we
[1:23:26] and so our mind starts getting a little
[1:23:28] bit ahead of us and we have to stop that
[1:23:31] and we have to say wait a minute oh no
[1:23:34] devil
[1:23:35] you know i refuse to sing some of the
[1:23:37] lyrics this is no reflection on
[1:23:38] benjamin's songs this morning
[1:23:40] but i refuse to send some of those to
[1:23:43] sing some of those lyrics this morning
[1:23:45] there was a line in there and i may need
[1:23:47] to sing it next sunday but i said not
[1:23:49] today
[1:23:51] there was a line in that beautiful song
[1:23:53] that we sung toward the end that said my
[1:23:56] soul is barren and dry i couldn't sing
[1:24:00] that today
[1:24:01] i may sing that tuesday
[1:24:03] i may have to say that next sunday but
[1:24:06] if you've been praying like i'm praying
[1:24:08] you can't have a barren soul
[1:24:11] because the longer you stay connected to
[1:24:13] him the more your even your soul begins
[1:24:16] to get connected to what the spirit is
[1:24:19] saying
[1:24:20] and so just remember that when you get
[1:24:23] weary and you get weak and you begin to
[1:24:25] worry and you begin to wring your hands
[1:24:28] and you begin to cross bridges that you
[1:24:30] haven't come to yet you've got to catch
[1:24:33] yourself
[1:24:35] you've got to say wait a minute that is
[1:24:38] not who i am i'm not here just this is
[1:24:41] not some kind of jackpot i'm not i don't
[1:24:44] have my hand on a one-armed devil i'm
[1:24:46] not trying to gamble at a slot machine
[1:24:49] to see if i'm going to overcome this
[1:24:51] stuff or not
[1:24:52] this is no this is we're not throwing uh
[1:24:56] some card game or playing some kind of
[1:24:58] roulette will here
[1:25:00] we know that there's a divine god a god
[1:25:04] who has placed his divine life in us
[1:25:07] and even when we feel like death we
[1:25:10] don't have to receive it as a spirit
[1:25:12] from him because the spirit of life is
[1:25:15] in us
[1:25:16] we may not get up and run around the
[1:25:18] room and shout and speak in tongues but
[1:25:20] you're blessed to know that you've got a
[1:25:23] body
[1:25:24] you've got a family in christ that was
[1:25:27] doing that on your behalf because we
[1:25:30] knew that god wanted to bring you
[1:25:32] through
[1:25:33] well then why don't i feel 100 right now
[1:25:36] because your body hadn't caught up to
[1:25:37] your confession
[1:25:39] or either you're not making the right
[1:25:41] confession
[1:25:42] so don't text me this afternoon and ask
[1:25:45] me if i'm worried
[1:25:48] text me this afternoon and tell me where
[1:25:50] your faith is
[1:25:52] i'm coming out of this without a hiccup
[1:25:56] i'm not going to have a bad day three
[1:25:58] months from now
[1:26:00] come on
[1:26:02] we don't compare one case to another
[1:26:04] case
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:07] this is no competition here
[1:26:10] in the early days i heard a few people
[1:26:12] say things like i think i've got it
[1:26:14] worse than anybody else
[1:26:18] that's how you feel
[1:26:20] that's how you feel when you're in the
[1:26:23] throw of it
[1:26:24] but let me tell you there's somebody
[1:26:26] laying in a hospital today
[1:26:29] that had you beat
[1:26:31] that is not to diminish what you went
[1:26:33] through it's actually to celebrate you
[1:26:36] it's actually to tell you that you
[1:26:39] somehow held on
[1:26:41] when it didn't feel like you didn't feel
[1:26:43] like holding on you somehow held on and
[1:26:46] god is let's just make it a process god
[1:26:50] is bringing you through for his glory
[1:26:54] everything you need to overcome is in
[1:26:56] you this morning by the power of the
[1:26:58] holy ghost if you should get worn out
[1:27:01] tonight remember there's grace for that
[1:27:04] there's rest for that there's help for
[1:27:07] that there's strength for that
[1:27:11] yes the truth is i worry
[1:27:13] but i have i don't have the luxury
[1:27:16] of laying there along
[1:27:19] i can't
[1:27:20] i cannot
[1:27:22] it's my responsibility as a pastor it's
[1:27:25] my responsibility as a pastor to get out
[1:27:28] of that place as quickly as i possibly
[1:27:32] can
[1:27:33] come on now
[1:27:34] so i know sometimes people are offended
[1:27:37] by my answers
[1:27:44] because you want me to see it as serious
[1:27:46] at the moment as you do
[1:27:48] but if that's what we all did
[1:27:51] where what a faith
[1:27:53] what a faith
[1:27:55] this wonderful thing about being married
[1:27:59] you're two different people coming
[1:28:01] together
[1:28:02] in a god call
[1:28:05] if you're too much alike
[1:28:08] it's going to be more rocky
[1:28:11] i need a little help here
[1:28:13] you've got two different people coming
[1:28:15] together and hopefully that helps
[1:28:17] because when one is reacting one way the
[1:28:20] other one can have the grace to react
[1:28:22] another way
[1:28:24] when one is low hopefully somebody in
[1:28:26] the house is high
[1:28:28] and vice versa and hopefully you swap
[1:28:30] around and you keep believing there's no
[1:28:33] shame in being sick
[1:28:36] don't you feel shamed don't you feel
[1:28:38] like that you're you weren't as robust
[1:28:40] as you thought you were or or the enemy
[1:28:43] got one over on you that's a lie i don't
[1:28:45] believe that doctrine
[1:28:47] if god allowed that thing to touch our
[1:28:49] body he did it because he wants to talk
[1:28:51] to us
[1:28:54] he did it because he has something to
[1:28:56] say to us
[1:28:57] somebody said now you tell me what god
[1:28:59] could say to me when i feel like
[1:29:01] i feel real bad
[1:29:04] you tell me what god can say to me i'll
[1:29:06] tell you what he can say he can say you
[1:29:08] can't make it without me
[1:29:13] all your vitamins and all your
[1:29:14] medications and all your doctor's
[1:29:16] appointments and all your frequency
[1:29:18] adjusters and everything else you do and
[1:29:21] all your juice
[1:29:23] none of that is going to help you
[1:29:24] without me if i'm not involved if i'm
[1:29:27] not on board
[1:29:30] come on now
[1:29:32] all the chelation therapy and all the
[1:29:35] all of the uh
[1:29:37] oh
[1:29:41] you know people are having
[1:29:43] fecal transplants
[1:29:47] where they're taking
[1:29:49] waste out of somebody's body and
[1:29:51] cleansing it
[1:29:53] and putting it somewhere else in
[1:29:55] somebody else's body and it resets their
[1:29:58] digestive system
[1:30:01] it's really a modern miracle if you
[1:30:03] think about it but i don't want to think
[1:30:05] about it
[1:30:09] you can go through all that kind of
[1:30:11] therapy and go through all that kind of
[1:30:13] help and it won't be enough and
[1:30:16] sometimes god just wants you to remember
[1:30:22] you can make it by yourself
[1:30:25] you can drink gallons of oil and you
[1:30:27] can't make it by yourself
[1:30:31] you can take so much vitamin c you can
[1:30:33] only live in one room of the house but
[1:30:36] you can't make it without my help
[1:30:39] sometimes that's what he's saying
[1:30:42] you know what else god was saying to
[1:30:44] some of us don't be mad don't be mad
[1:30:48] to some of us he was saying oh it's good
[1:30:50] to hear from you again
[1:30:57] stephen who
[1:31:00] i'm using my name
[1:31:04] david you weren't sick this time david
[1:31:06] who
[1:31:08] he wants to hear from us
[1:31:11] somebody said god doesn't want to hear
[1:31:13] from us when things are bad let me tell
[1:31:14] you the truth he wants to hear from you
[1:31:17] all the time
[1:31:18] good time bad time he wants to hear from
[1:31:21] you when you need him and when you don't
[1:31:23] need him he wants to hear from you
[1:31:26] that's how much he loves you
[1:31:28] so so don't tell me he's not talking
[1:31:31] he's talking
[1:31:33] and we're listening
[1:31:34] and he makes sure we listen sometimes
[1:31:36] because we don't have energy to do
[1:31:38] anything else when we're fighting
[1:31:40] something like this i bless you in the
[1:31:42] name of the lord i celebrate your
[1:31:44] faithfulness i honor you for being in
[1:31:46] the house of god today my heart goes out
[1:31:49] to those who would have liked to have
[1:31:50] been here this morning but felt too weak
[1:31:52] to be here may god raise them up may
[1:31:55] they not have to miss another time that
[1:31:57] they would want to be here
[1:31:59] i don't feel any judgment for anybody
[1:32:02] i feel like god's doing something and i
[1:32:04] just want to say blessed be the name of
[1:32:06] the lord
[1:32:07] i want to thank god i want to thank him
[1:32:10] i want to thank him for how gracious
[1:32:12] he's been
[1:32:13] this spirit of grace we've got to move
[1:32:15] on the spirit of grace governs the
[1:32:19] attitudes and the actions of the
[1:32:21] believer who has learned to walk in the
[1:32:24] spirit and not in the flesh not by the
[1:32:28] realm of the soul but by the realm of
[1:32:31] the spirit
[1:32:34] we need the spirit of grace
[1:32:38] i want you to think with me a moment
[1:32:40] here as an introduction to this spirit
[1:32:43] of grace because we're mostly familiar
[1:32:46] with just calling it grace
[1:32:51] but two times in the bible one old
[1:32:54] testament one new testament it's not
[1:32:57] just called grace
[1:33:00] it's called the spirit
[1:33:02] of
[1:33:03] grace
[1:33:06] i don't know what you think about when
[1:33:07] you think about grace most people think
[1:33:10] about
[1:33:11] unmerited favor is that what comes to
[1:33:13] your mind
[1:33:14] let me see your hand if you think of
[1:33:16] that as a good definition for grace it's
[1:33:18] a good
[1:33:19] it's a good theological definition
[1:33:22] but what is grace
[1:33:26] is it ethereal
[1:33:29] is it like a mist
[1:33:34] if somebody says i feel grace
[1:33:37] what did you feel
[1:33:40] how does grace feel
[1:33:43] is grace an inanimate object
[1:33:48] is it an object
[1:33:54] when someone says
[1:33:56] there go i
[1:33:58] but by the grace of god
[1:34:01] what do they mean
[1:34:04] is grace something that you consume
[1:34:07] like a pie
[1:34:11] is grace an emotion
[1:34:18] you ever thought of grace as a person
[1:34:24] how many of you remember the story that
[1:34:27] and we may read it in a moment or two do
[1:34:28] you remember the story that brother
[1:34:30] branham tells about dwight moody
[1:34:35] maybe you'll just bring that up for me
[1:34:38] is it okay to do things out of order
[1:34:41] good i'm more comfortable that way
[1:34:44] it's in a message the invisible union of
[1:34:46] the bride of christ
[1:34:50] paragraph 37
[1:34:52] it was said one time i was reading when
[1:34:55] i was writing a note for this
[1:34:57] i i could not exactly remember the book
[1:34:59] that it's in but i
[1:35:01] i'm sure this is right
[1:35:03] that one of the books i read on mr moody
[1:35:06] dwight moody in chicago we have a great
[1:35:09] listening church in chicago how many of
[1:35:11] you know he's talking about the great
[1:35:12] radio station that came out of the moody
[1:35:15] chapel in in chicago illinois for so
[1:35:19] many years
[1:35:21] he said that mr moody after reading
[1:35:23] romans 7
[1:35:25] ran into the street and the first man he
[1:35:30] met he said to him
[1:35:32] do you know grace
[1:35:36] and the man replied grace who
[1:35:42] you got to get it
[1:35:45] hey you know grace
[1:35:47] grace who
[1:35:49] mr moody said the grace of god
[1:35:56] so it so thrilled him
[1:35:58] when he seen what how grace had
[1:36:01] separated us from the law
[1:36:04] and how that what part grace played well
[1:36:07] now anything that i want to do is when i
[1:36:10] always told the people when i crossed
[1:36:12] the line on the other side i'd like to
[1:36:15] stand up and sing amazing grace how
[1:36:19] sweet the sound that saved a wretch like
[1:36:23] me gracious precious grace more of grace
[1:36:28] to know
[1:36:31] for it's by grace we are saved that what
[1:36:34] is grace
[1:36:37] what is grace
[1:36:40] is grace something you meet
[1:36:43] like you meet a person
[1:36:46] is grace something you feel
[1:36:49] like an emotion
[1:36:53] is grace like a mist
[1:36:56] a cloud
[1:36:59] is it a feeling
[1:37:05] he said for it's by grace we're saved
[1:37:07] not by what we can do
[1:37:10] what we can whatever we do is not
[1:37:12] counted to us grace
[1:37:15] is what saves us by grace are you saved
[1:37:20] through faith how many of you know this
[1:37:22] is right
[1:37:23] he said may i add to this woman grace
[1:37:27] brother branham is personifying grace
[1:37:32] he's describing as moody did grace as a
[1:37:36] person
[1:37:37] he's describing a solomon did wisdom
[1:37:41] he is
[1:37:42] personifying grace
[1:37:44] he's making her a woman although i'm
[1:37:47] having a hard time finding any verses
[1:37:49] that refer to grace
[1:37:51] in the same manner that wisdom is
[1:37:54] referred to
[1:37:56] but listen at how he went on here he
[1:37:58] said
[1:37:59] may i place her in the bible also
[1:38:03] as called the elect
[1:38:06] lady
[1:38:09] who is the elect lady
[1:38:13] she is the bride she is the portion of
[1:38:17] the church that the message was sent to
[1:38:24] to the elect lady
[1:38:27] we read it in the book of the revelation
[1:38:30] perhaps another place
[1:38:32] to the elect lady let me address these
[1:38:36] words to the elect lady who is she she's
[1:38:39] the overcoming bride
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:41] there is a message sent to the church
[1:38:44] there is a message sent to the
[1:38:46] overcoming bride
[1:38:48] the church is not the elect lady
[1:38:52] the bride is the elect lady brother
[1:38:55] brethren said let me take this grace and
[1:38:57] place her in the bible also as called
[1:39:00] the elect lady this miss
[1:39:04] grace
[1:39:07] can you see anything yet
[1:39:09] he said i'm going to talk about you know
[1:39:12] the bible declare said to the elect lady
[1:39:17] that if you notice elect
[1:39:20] comes from the word elected lady one
[1:39:23] lady amongst all the other ladies was
[1:39:27] elected
[1:39:29] there were many other birds
[1:39:32] but there was only one great speckled
[1:39:35] bird
[1:39:37] all the other birds flocked against her
[1:39:41] they envied her glory and her fame
[1:39:45] they long defined fault with the
[1:39:47] prophet's teachings but theologians
[1:39:49] could find no mistake
[1:39:51] among all the birds there was a great
[1:39:54] speckled bird
[1:39:57] there was one elect lady there was one
[1:40:00] chosen
[1:40:01] among all the other ladies
[1:40:03] he says in paragraph 41 like the virgin
[1:40:07] was to bring forth the body of god on
[1:40:09] the earth she was an elected woman god
[1:40:13] chose mary
[1:40:16] we could say today that mary was miss
[1:40:19] grace
[1:40:23] because she was chosen
[1:40:25] by grace
[1:40:27] and that grace was personified
[1:40:30] and she became the personification i
[1:40:34] don't know if you feel up to following
[1:40:35] me this morning
[1:40:38] but she became the personification
[1:40:41] of the very thing
[1:40:43] that brought her through
[1:40:45] she became a misgrace
[1:40:48] like the virgin was to bring forth the
[1:40:50] body of god the body of the lord jesus
[1:40:52] christ on the earth she was an elected
[1:40:54] woman god chose mary let's read on just
[1:40:57] a bit
[1:41:01] and also god has chose an elected lady
[1:41:05] which is his bride
[1:41:07] come on now
[1:41:09] same way he chose mary he's chosen
[1:41:12] elected lady abroad she's elected i hope
[1:41:15] we're members of that tonight across the
[1:41:18] world across the nation rather
[1:41:21] he's even on the hook up the telephone
[1:41:23] hookup is operating then
[1:41:26] and he said across the nation rather the
[1:41:28] illustration here are you still with me
[1:41:32] showing the relationship
[1:41:34] of the bride to christ
[1:41:37] the elect lady and how she was to be
[1:41:40] brought to him where she would come from
[1:41:43] and how that she would be brought to him
[1:41:46] somebody tell me what was doing this it
[1:41:48] was grace
[1:41:50] it was grace that found us in our
[1:41:53] denominational error and told us there
[1:41:55] was something else
[1:41:57] it was grace that wouldn't allow us to
[1:42:00] be satisfied forever in partial truth
[1:42:04] because he had a truth that he wanted to
[1:42:06] reveal and make known to us
[1:42:09] you may feel like you chose to follow
[1:42:11] this message but the truth is this
[1:42:14] message chose you
[1:42:18] this truth chose you
[1:42:20] you were elected and chosen of god to
[1:42:24] follow a message of truth that would
[1:42:26] reveal jesus christ
[1:42:28] as the same yesterday today and forever
[1:42:32] so if mary was a misgrace then there is
[1:42:35] a bride on the earth even now who also
[1:42:39] is becoming the personification
[1:42:42] of grace
[1:42:44] do you know grace yes i know her
[1:42:49] yes i know her
[1:42:51] i'm looking at her i'm looking at miss
[1:42:54] grace i'm looking at what grace has done
[1:42:59] he said the illustration here showing
[1:43:01] the relationship of bride to christ the
[1:43:03] elect lady
[1:43:05] 1241
[1:43:07] and how she was to be brought to him
[1:43:09] where she would come from and how that
[1:43:11] she would be brought to him all of this
[1:43:13] grace grace grace
[1:43:15] grace let's go on
[1:43:18] the church
[1:43:19] the church here in illustration that we
[1:43:22] get that we've got in view is
[1:43:24] illustrated by a woman which a woman is
[1:43:27] always a type of the church because the
[1:43:29] church is considered a bride a bride
[1:43:32] she is
[1:43:33] the bride of the lord jesus
[1:43:37] the son of god
[1:43:39] next verse i didn't want to leave this
[1:43:41] out
[1:43:42] next paragraph i mean
[1:43:44] always if you watch
[1:43:47] watch the conditions and the conduct of
[1:43:50] women
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:53] this is hard to get out there on the on
[1:43:55] the internet but it's the truth
[1:43:57] and you'll see where the church is
[1:44:00] how many of you know it's right
[1:44:02] watch the condition and the conduct of
[1:44:04] women in any generation
[1:44:07] and you will be able to identify the
[1:44:09] condition and conduct of the church
[1:44:12] because a church is represented by a
[1:44:14] woman
[1:44:15] when you see women wanting to strip off
[1:44:18] when you see women wanting to do the
[1:44:20] things that modern women want to do
[1:44:22] today you understand no wonder the
[1:44:25] church has lost its power like samson
[1:44:28] the church laid her head in delilah's
[1:44:31] lap he cut off her strength and power
[1:44:34] and now she's weak
[1:44:37] and she accomplishes very little in this
[1:44:40] hour
[1:44:41] a lot of noise
[1:44:43] a lot of programs
[1:44:45] a lot of social justice issues
[1:44:49] but not much jesus christ the same
[1:44:51] yesterday and today and forever so god
[1:44:54] said i got to do something with the
[1:44:55] people i've got to infuse them with
[1:44:57] grace so that they become a
[1:44:59] personification of what grace is
[1:45:03] and if you're not following me you will
[1:45:06] you will eventually because we'll come
[1:45:07] back to this
[1:45:09] i've got to have a people who will
[1:45:10] personify the spirit of grace and listen
[1:45:14] church that doesn't start with you and
[1:45:16] the world
[1:45:19] that starts with you and your fellow
[1:45:21] brother and your fellow sister in christ
[1:45:24] that starts with you and the members of
[1:45:26] your church community
[1:45:28] it's learning to personify
[1:45:31] grace to one another
[1:45:36] never quit to put somebody to hell but
[1:45:39] always believing that grace is enough
[1:45:45] my that's a that's a that's a we came in
[1:45:48] amen brother
[1:45:50] but always believing that like goodness
[1:45:53] and mercy grace will chase down the
[1:45:56] wayward one
[1:45:58] he will find the prodigal son he will
[1:46:01] find the prodigal daughter because god
[1:46:04] is looking for someone to be grace
[1:46:08] to personify grace
[1:46:10] jesus is love and he personifies love
[1:46:12] jesus is grace and he personifies grace
[1:46:17] so let me tell you what grace is
[1:46:20] it's more than an abstract something you
[1:46:22] can't see
[1:46:24] you just say grace has brought me thus
[1:46:26] far
[1:46:27] and what does that mean you had a
[1:46:28] feeling you had some energy you had
[1:46:30] something come on you and that was what
[1:46:32] brought you through
[1:46:33] is that what grace is no grace is more
[1:46:36] than that grace is a spirit
[1:46:40] grace is a spirit the spirit of grace
[1:46:44] and the apostle is saying if those
[1:46:46] people who rejected the law of moses and
[1:46:49] who rejected the salvation by moses the
[1:46:51] truth that moses brought to bring the
[1:46:53] people out if they did not go without
[1:46:56] punishment
[1:46:58] how much greater will the punishment be
[1:47:01] to those of us
[1:47:03] who had opportunity to be a part of a
[1:47:06] new covenant purchased by the blood of
[1:47:09] the sinless lamb of god
[1:47:11] and how much more will we find rejection
[1:47:14] and will we face punishment
[1:47:17] if we walk on jesus
[1:47:20] and if we show disrespect
[1:47:23] to the spirit
[1:47:25] of grace
[1:47:28] i want you to see the spirit of grace
[1:47:31] if truth is a spirit
[1:47:34] if life is a spirit if adoption is a
[1:47:37] spirit if holiness is a spirit
[1:47:41] then grace is also a spirit
[1:47:46] and someone said who does it live in you
[1:47:49] as a believer how many believers are
[1:47:51] here let me see your hand if you're a
[1:47:52] believer
[1:47:54] what do believers do
[1:47:57] they believe
[1:48:01] that was often my answer
[1:48:05] i'm believing
[1:48:09] one person got very very specific how
[1:48:11] worried are you
[1:48:16] let me see if i can measure it
[1:48:19] how do you answer that i'm i'm 30
[1:48:21] worried and 70
[1:48:23] faith
[1:48:28] the truth is there's just no room
[1:48:32] concern is not what we're talking about
[1:48:34] we're talking about worry if you're
[1:48:36] talking about concern i'm 100 concerned
[1:48:39] but when i found worry creeping in i had
[1:48:42] to deal with it and you will too
[1:48:45] because worry is like acid
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:49] it erodes it's like a cancer it's like
[1:48:52] fear it eats away in your faith
[1:48:56] it thrives on faith like moths thrive on
[1:49:00] wool it wants to eat and consume and
[1:49:03] poke holes in everything you try to do
[1:49:07] to keep pressing on and to keep
[1:49:08] believing but i want to tell you
[1:49:10] something if you say you have the
[1:49:12] baptism of the holy ghost then all that
[1:49:15] he is
[1:49:17] is resonant
[1:49:19] in your life
[1:49:21] and if you'll get in touch with the
[1:49:23] spirit of life
[1:49:25] get in touch with the spirit of truth
[1:49:27] get in touch with the spirit of adoption
[1:49:30] and get in touch with the spirit of
[1:49:32] holiness get in touch with the spirit of
[1:49:34] grace
[1:49:35] it's in you
[1:49:37] if the holy ghost is there then all of
[1:49:39] his offices are there
[1:49:41] if the holy ghost is there then all of
[1:49:43] his ministries are there all of his
[1:49:46] administrations are there well we got
[1:49:48] something church we have something we
[1:49:51] have somebody when you sing the old hymn
[1:49:54] i have somebody with me you've got more
[1:49:56] than just a friend on board
[1:49:59] you've got everything you have need of
[1:50:02] this good old holy ghost
[1:50:04] do you know grace
[1:50:07] turn to your neighbor and ask him do you
[1:50:10] know grace
[1:50:12] grace who
[1:50:13] amazing grace
[1:50:16] how sweet the sound
[1:50:18] and it's not a feeling
[1:50:21] it's not some kind of cloud
[1:50:24] it's not an object
[1:50:27] it's a spirit
[1:50:29] it's his spirit
[1:50:32] living inside of you
[1:50:34] grace doesn't have to come running after
[1:50:36] you
[1:50:39] because grace lives in you
[1:50:42] you just have to reach in and touch it
[1:50:45] now not only do you have to learn to
[1:50:47] show grace to others
[1:50:50] you have to learn to show grace to
[1:50:52] yourself at times
[1:50:54] because god didn't just put grace in you
[1:50:56] to help you overcome and forgive
[1:50:57] somebody else
[1:50:59] he also placed the spirit of grace in
[1:51:01] you so that you'd be able to show your
[1:51:03] own self grace
[1:51:05] because jesus is the one who gave it to
[1:51:07] you
[1:51:08] and he's not taking it back if anybody's
[1:51:10] with me can you say amen i got about 10
[1:51:13] minutes here of what i of the time i
[1:51:15] wanted to take so i better get to it
[1:51:19] we said in the beginning of this
[1:51:21] introduction that the spirit of grace in
[1:51:23] you as the holy ghost
[1:51:26] desires to govern our lives
[1:51:29] so that he can fulfill all the purposes
[1:51:31] of god in you individually
[1:51:35] and in us
[1:51:37] corporately
[1:51:39] folks we really have no excuse
[1:51:45] i'm not getting much out of the
[1:51:46] preaching lately
[1:51:48] that's just no excuse
[1:51:52] i'm not defending myself
[1:51:54] i'm telling you the truth
[1:51:56] it's not much of an excuse
[1:51:58] if you have the holy ghost you've got
[1:52:00] everything you need to lead you to grace
[1:52:02] and truth
[1:52:04] it's inside we need a preaching because
[1:52:06] god has chosen the foolishness of
[1:52:08] preaching
[1:52:09] we need all of these gifts in the body
[1:52:11] the apostles prophets pastors teachers
[1:52:13] and evangelists we need those gifts
[1:52:16] because we are facing that until
[1:52:20] we want to walk in that until the
[1:52:21] fullness of what's on the other side of
[1:52:24] the until now what does govern mean
[1:52:26] the spirit of grace is given to the
[1:52:28] believer to help govern you
[1:52:35] i rented to you hall while you were sick
[1:52:39] i've never drove a u-haul truck in my
[1:52:41] life
[1:52:44] i had r.j sitting beside me
[1:52:47] in case i needed him
[1:52:51] i kind of liked it
[1:52:54] i had fun
[1:52:56] i went out there near where the
[1:52:58] graves live and rented a u-haul and
[1:53:02] drove back ways over there to opelaka
[1:53:04] auburn to pick up something and drove
[1:53:07] over here to the church and then
[1:53:09] drove it back through town and
[1:53:11] took it back and
[1:53:13] i kind of liked the feel of that thing
[1:53:16] it's big
[1:53:17] i kind of liked the idea of people
[1:53:19] getting out of my way
[1:53:21] it wasn't that big but
[1:53:23] i felt pretty big and it sat pretty
[1:53:25] comfortable thing
[1:53:28] but they knew me
[1:53:31] and they knew that if i get to talking
[1:53:36] my foot can get a little heavy
[1:53:40] and i started down one of them hills out
[1:53:42] there on highway 80.
[1:53:44] i thought the thing was going to shut
[1:53:45] down and stop
[1:53:47] i thought somebody was about to take the
[1:53:49] wheel and pull it over
[1:53:51] and and switch it off because something
[1:53:54] kicked on in there
[1:53:56] to slow me down
[1:54:02] the concept of what we used to call a
[1:54:04] governor
[1:54:06] the governor stepped in
[1:54:09] come on
[1:54:10] and he said you're going too fast in
[1:54:12] this thing you're swerving around when
[1:54:15] we got out uh
[1:54:17] ben benjamin and joshua and them and
[1:54:19] followed us and i said how did i do they
[1:54:21] said well it was kind of swerving i said
[1:54:23] yeah i know it was i was well aware of
[1:54:25] the swerve that's kind of what i liked
[1:54:29] that thing governed me
[1:54:32] i was ready to go full throttle down
[1:54:35] that hill and up the other side it was
[1:54:38] empty
[1:54:39] and i was enjoying my power until
[1:54:43] somebody stepped in and said whoa
[1:54:49] it wasn't necessarily conviction
[1:54:56] i wasn't going a hundred you know that
[1:54:58] they don't let you
[1:55:00] i wasn't even gonna flat stretch it was
[1:55:03] going down the hill that i'd gained all
[1:55:05] that speed
[1:55:06] and literally it felt like the whole
[1:55:08] thing was
[1:55:09] sure
[1:55:13] it wouldn't even let me press the pedal
[1:55:14] all the way down
[1:55:18] this is a work of the holy ghost
[1:55:22] it's the spirit of grace
[1:55:25] god is being gracious to you when he
[1:55:29] puts the governor on
[1:55:33] when he slows you down i wish you could
[1:55:36] squeeze out some help for me just a
[1:55:38] moment it's a work of the holy ghost and
[1:55:41] the spirit of grace to govern us in our
[1:55:45] attitudes and in our actions when we get
[1:55:48] to flying down the hill lickety-split
[1:55:51] like a runaway train it'll take us where
[1:55:54] we don't want to go
[1:55:57] it'll dredge up emotions that we have
[1:56:00] long buried it will remind us as
[1:56:03] emotions begin to resurface and memories
[1:56:07] begin to reform
[1:56:10] thank you lord for the spirit of grace
[1:56:14] that steps in
[1:56:16] to govern us
[1:56:19] he doesn't control us
[1:56:22] he doesn't stop us
[1:56:26] he governs us
[1:56:29] grace
[1:56:31] grace
[1:56:32] governs us
[1:56:36] i thought the thing might switch off
[1:56:39] that would have been stopping me that
[1:56:42] would have been like a real work of
[1:56:43] conviction
[1:56:45] but that's not what this was
[1:56:47] this was god not saying stop
[1:56:50] this was god saying you need to slow way
[1:56:52] down
[1:56:54] you're not in control of what's
[1:56:55] happening right now
[1:56:58] hello
[1:57:00] what'd you think was doing that
[1:57:02] i'm not a betting person but i would
[1:57:04] almost be willing to tell you you didn't
[1:57:06] think it was grace
[1:57:09] it doesn't feel like grace
[1:57:12] when god slows us down but it's grace
[1:57:15] because you realize what would happen
[1:57:18] if he just stood back and said go ahead
[1:57:21] fly off the cliff
[1:57:24] go ahead and make a real f-o-o-l of
[1:57:27] yourself
[1:57:29] come on go ahead show who you really no
[1:57:32] no he doesn't do that great
[1:57:34] amazing grace
[1:57:37] how sweet the sound
[1:57:39] it rises up in us and says whoa
[1:57:46] i'm here to govern you i'm here to
[1:57:47] restrain you a little i'm here to hold
[1:57:49] you back i'm here to give you some time
[1:57:51] to reflect on what's going on so that
[1:57:54] you don't destroy yourself or destroy
[1:57:56] somebody else around you
[1:57:59] i want you to appreciate grace let me
[1:58:01] tell you something the next time you get
[1:58:03] up and sing amazing grace you're not
[1:58:05] just singing about the grace that saved
[1:58:07] you or the grace that brought you out of
[1:58:10] sin i want you to begin to recognize
[1:58:12] you're also praising him for the grace
[1:58:15] that keeps you
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:23] i think it was spurgeon it might have
[1:58:24] been moody that used to preach there
[1:58:26] were three or four kinds of grace
[1:58:32] there was a preeminent grace
[1:58:34] a grace that came
[1:58:37] to you in your life
[1:58:40] to protect you until god could deal with
[1:58:42] you
[1:58:43] and then a saving grace
[1:58:46] and then a keeping grace
[1:58:48] and then a finishing grace
[1:58:51] i don't know if you can divide it up
[1:58:52] into categories or not but i'm going to
[1:58:54] let you know for the sake of
[1:58:56] a time i'm not going to do that because
[1:58:58] it could end up being a three-month
[1:59:00] series
[1:59:04] but all of its grace
[1:59:06] the grace that kept you when you were
[1:59:08] out there
[1:59:09] come on now
[1:59:11] somebody snorting something up their
[1:59:12] nose and wasn't real sure where it come
[1:59:14] from
[1:59:16] swallowing something and not real sure
[1:59:18] who made it
[1:59:20] you didn't catch a glimpse of a dirty
[1:59:22] old shack somewhere where that stuff was
[1:59:25] being cooked up and made
[1:59:27] might be laced with rap poison might be
[1:59:30] laced with something else
[1:59:33] might be contaminated by something
[1:59:36] you're just out there in sin you've
[1:59:38] never called on the lord you've never
[1:59:40] found him amazing grace hasn't saved you
[1:59:42] yet and yet god protected some of us
[1:59:47] that's what grace was doing for you
[1:59:49] before you knew who she was
[1:59:51] grace was on your side
[1:59:55] hallelujah before you ever recognized
[1:59:57] you needed her
[1:59:59] come on
[2:00:01] protecting you keeping you some of you
[2:00:03] in violent places
[2:00:06] you could have been shot
[2:00:09] some of you beat up don't raise your
[2:00:10] hand
[2:00:12] there's some of you that have carried a
[2:00:14] black eye
[2:00:15] fractured nose
[2:00:18] a crooked jaw
[2:00:20] because of being in an atmosphere
[2:00:23] that fist could have easily been a a
[2:00:26] bullet
[2:00:28] come on let's celebrate
[2:00:31] it could have been a bullet that took
[2:00:32] you out of this world but grace was
[2:00:35] already ministering
[2:00:38] the spirit of grace was already working
[2:00:41] on your behalf before you were filled
[2:00:43] with grace
[2:00:44] before you had received the holy ghost
[2:00:47] he was already out there working on your
[2:00:49] behalf and then grace saved you grace
[2:00:52] found you you didn't go looking for
[2:00:54] grace
[2:00:55] grace come looking for you
[2:00:57] and you were saved and born again by
[2:01:00] faith in the marvelous grace of the lord
[2:01:03] jesus christ and that's wonderful grace
[2:01:06] but i want you to know that i thank god
[2:01:09] for that grace
[2:01:11] but i thank him more than anything else
[2:01:13] for keeping grace
[2:01:16] i wasn't on drugs when i found the lord
[2:01:27] i never smoked a joint
[2:01:30] i never took speed
[2:01:33] i never
[2:01:36] was never even in the room where someone
[2:01:38] was snorting cocaine
[2:01:43] i i needed grace because i was still a
[2:01:45] sinner
[2:01:46] and undone without god
[2:01:48] an amazing grace found me and it was a
[2:01:51] if it hadn't been for that i would be
[2:01:53] lost because it's not what you're doing
[2:01:57] it's the fact you've rejected away
[2:01:59] you haven't come to the to trust the
[2:02:01] lord for his life
[2:02:03] and i had not as a child
[2:02:05] i remember singing and praying in the
[2:02:07] little baptist sunday school and
[2:02:09] accepting the lord into my life and he
[2:02:11] filled me with the holy ghost at age
[2:02:13] seven and
[2:02:14] i've made a lot of mistakes in my life
[2:02:16] but that wasn't one of them i
[2:02:19] i didn't drink or smoke or run around i
[2:02:21] was
[2:02:22] sexually pure when i married my wife and
[2:02:27] but i can testify to you today
[2:02:30] of the keeping grace
[2:02:33] because jesus didn't just save you like
[2:02:35] you were
[2:02:36] find you like you were he's kept you on
[2:02:39] the winning side how many of you think
[2:02:42] you ought to take a moment just to raise
[2:02:44] up your hand and say lord i thank you
[2:02:46] for grace oh come on church somebody
[2:02:48] we're getting ready to go here why don't

[2:02:58] and say lord i thank you for grace

[2:04:01] meet death one day
[2:04:03] with peace and joy

[2:13:40] beautiful to me
[2:13:42] although i knew she had been through an
[2:13:44] awful hard time
[2:13:46] but she told me that she had to just
[2:13:48] make up her mind
[2:13:50] and to eat and to
[2:13:52] get around and walk around and get in
[2:13:54] the sun and do the things that come to
[2:13:56] earth
[2:13:57] to do and trust god
[2:13:59] and she came through it
[2:14:02] and it filled me with so much faith that
[2:14:04] the rest of you would be doing the same
[2:14:07] and i know that god is going to touch
[2:14:08] you today and there are those
[2:14:10] who didn't maybe don't feel like they
[2:14:12] need this special touch of prayer but
