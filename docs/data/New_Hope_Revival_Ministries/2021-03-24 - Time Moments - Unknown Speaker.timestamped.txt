[0:00] god created time
[0:03] for you he didn't need time
[0:08] [Music]
[0:12] god created time for his purpose
[0:17] and his purpose is you so we can say
[0:20] that
[0:20] god created time for you
[0:24] he didn't need time everything that god
[0:28] was going to do for
[0:29] us he could have done for us in eternity
[0:33] but he created time because he wanted to
[0:37] accomplish some things
[0:38] in our life that are outside the
[0:42] perimeter of time
[0:44] they are eternal purposes
[0:47] and sometimes these eternal purposes
[0:51] become a process of unfolding
[0:55] revelation upon revelation upon
[0:58] revelation
[0:59] lying upon line upon line precept upon
[1:03] precept
[1:04] upon precept did you know that from the
[1:07] beginning
[1:08] god could have had a bride already
[1:11] dressed
[1:12] already perfect already like him
[1:15] did you know he could have absolutely
[1:18] skipped planet earth
[1:20] [Music]
[1:22] he didn't have to do it the way he did
[1:24] it he chose to do it the way he
[1:27] did it as a gift for you and i
[1:31] isn't that wonderful we never had to
[1:34] leave that
[1:35] third heaven that presence of god we
[1:37] never had to leave there in the first
[1:39] place
[1:40] we could have remained there he could
[1:42] have made us he could have spoke us
[1:44] into existence already in our highest
[1:48] form of perfection
[1:50] but there was an attribute in him
[1:54] that needed to be completed
[1:57] it needed to be manifested and that
[2:00] attribute was
[2:01] that of a redeemer and he cannot redeem
[2:06] if there's nothing that needs to be
[2:08] brought
[2:08] back to its original state so
[2:11] somebody has to be there and somebody
[2:14] has to fall
[2:15] and somebody has to have help and
[2:18] somebody has to call on help
[2:20] and then he comes rushing on the scene
[2:24] as a redeemer to pay the price
[2:28] to bring us into the perfect image
[2:31] that he had about us on his mind
[2:35] before the foundations of the world
