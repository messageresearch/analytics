[0:59] you many at times we have a lot of men
[1:03] of God and they feed the congregation
[1:07] and sometimes if I say when we we take
[1:09] it to
[1:11] food we can eat so much rice but we need
[1:15] somebody who will come and add flavor
[1:17] and vegetables to it with a unique
[1:20] Ministry and that is what Pastor Shel
[1:22] has brought into the message and into
[1:24] Bible Believers Fellowship he has
[1:26] brought a balance in the word MI in the
[1:30] prophetic with teaching and and and
[1:33] demonstration of power Miracles sze and
[1:37] wonders and this has really transformed
[1:40] the ministry and and and expanded the
[1:43] work of God down here in Africa it's
[1:46] opened our eyes to many things that God
[1:49] can do not only a one-sided Ministry but
[1:52] the prophetic has given us insight to
[1:55] who God is and what God has given to us
[1:58] and how we can bring the Kingdom of
[2:00] Heaven upon this Earth to walk the
[2:02] kingdom
[2:04] mandate just a few short days ago dad
[2:06] Hawk and myself lated in Ghana West
[2:09] Africa we've taken a short drive over to
[2:11] TMA where our hotel is and where the
[2:13] meetings are going to be held just just
[2:15] a short distance over there we're really
[2:18] excited to be here the expectation of
[2:20] the people is high and we're also
[2:23] expecting for ourselves this is my third
[2:24] time here and every time it seems to get
[2:27] better and better the atmosphere of the
[2:29] building is electric when you pull onto
[2:31] the property and then you go inside and
[2:33] it's even more electric with the worship
[2:35] we're just super excited for what the
[2:37] Lord is going to do
[2:40] [Music]
[2:51] [Applause]
[3:09] [Applause]
[3:15] [Applause]
[3:24] man of
[3:26] God all the way from Alabama and there's
[3:30] a there's a new word I learned
[3:33] today to describe him the word is
[3:38] super
[3:40] [Music]
[3:40] [Applause]
[3:49] fragilistic and in just a few weeks I'm
[3:52] going to be a grand
[4:00] and help me receive the ministry of our
[4:09] [Applause]
[4:31] [Music]
[4:33] [Applause]
[4:36] again
[4:37] [Applause]
[4:54] [Music]
[4:58] [Applause]
[5:00] my name is Isaac Benjamin Tay I met
[5:03] Pastor Shel when I was a teenager when
[5:05] he came he first came to Ghana we had
[5:08] this major convention and I was a tiny
[5:11] little boy playing keyboard and backing
[5:15] him on songs and I used to shiver when
[5:18] he's playing cuz I was scared of the
[5:20] crowd but with time I I got over it
[5:24] [Music]
[5:38] [Music]
[5:41] [Applause]
[5:42] [Music]
[5:52] and along the way um I met Pastor Shelly
[5:55] again in Amsterdam and he gave me a word
[5:58] of Prophecy that that you are pursuing
[6:01] business management but the Lord has a
[6:03] higher calling for you and afterwards
[6:06] about 3 years later the Lord began to
[6:09] speak I moved out of Holland to UK and
[6:13] um through UK I've been to many cities
[6:16] but when the right time came the Lord
[6:18] relocated me to wampton
[6:20] specifically to start the ministry
[6:23] called T pray Center and the Bible
[6:25] Believers Fellowship
[6:30] not just one son but many sons are
[6:34] coming to maturity under the Dynamics of
[6:37] the resurrection power of Jesus
[6:42] Christ
[6:45] hallelujah
[6:46] [Applause]
[6:51] hallelujah I declare that in Jesus name
[6:56] it is
[6:58] possible I will recover all that Satan
[7:02] has stolen from
[7:04] me in the name of Jesus
[7:09] [Music]
[7:09] [Applause]
[7:11] Christ
[7:13] h i
[7:23] rece and when I was after I received the
[7:27] Holy Ghost I started ministering at 7
[7:31] and I was pastoring at
[7:34] 17 so you are never too young to be used
[7:39] of and I want to encourage every one of
[7:42] you to give your lives to Jesus now my
[7:46] name is David chishi AKA I am the youth
[7:50] pastor at bible Believers Fellowship
[7:52] terer I believe that generally people
[7:55] who came in for the
[7:57] convention everybody would go back with
[8:00] a personal testimony I have had my
[8:04] personal testimony because there are
[8:06] many questions on my mind the Lord has
[8:08] answered now the spiritual side I have
[8:12] received a great impartation I'm going
[8:15] back into Ministry with greater
[8:18] knowledge um a higher spiritual level
[8:21] and I believe it is so for many other
[8:24] people too now many people came from
[8:26] different parts of Ghana and the testim
[8:29] they are going back with the healing of
[8:32] the infirmities in their bodies then the
[8:36] deliverance from um demonic forces
[8:39] oppression and all of these I I believe
[8:42] it's been a great an awesome time in the
[8:45] presence of God you know we know that
[8:48] nobody comes into the presence of the
[8:50] Lord and leaves the same we know that
[8:53] but at Easter 2024 meetings we saw it
[8:59] [Applause]
[9:12] [Applause]
[9:20] there was an overflow of Joy where
[9:23] people could express the the Liberty
[9:25] they have in Christ they could dance
[9:28] without thinking of what think about
[9:30] them they could scream and shout and I
[9:32] tell you Bible Believers and the Easter
[9:35] meetings we had shouting dancing jumping
[9:39] clapping was our daily dose of medicine
[9:42] it was awesome we had pastors from Kenya
[9:47] Rwanda Togo
[9:50] Nigeria myself from United Kingdom we
[9:53] had um Brethren from USA we had um
[9:57] Pastor Shel himself and a wonderful team
[10:01] from USA and we had another servant of
[10:04] God from the USA and a few across the
[10:08] continent of Africa I will say that they
[10:11] travel to honor the unique gift that God
[10:14] has placed in this end time in the early
[10:17] church the disciples traveled to
[10:20] Jerusalem because there was something
[10:22] unique there and when it comes to Pastor
[10:24] Shel he's a unique gift to the body of
[10:26] Christ and he is very scarce he's a red
[10:29] gem we will say he's one in a million so
[10:32] when we get the opportunity for him to
[10:34] come down because we are in close
[10:37] proximity we have to travel to come and
[10:40] benefit from his ministry and that is
[10:42] why we all troop in to sit under his
[10:45] ministry to be empowered to be ignited
[10:47] and to be set on fire for the Lord
