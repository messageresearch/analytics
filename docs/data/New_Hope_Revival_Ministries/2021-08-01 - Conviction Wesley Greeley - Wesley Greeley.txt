Description:
"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked." Isaiah 11:1-4

people shout unto god with the voice of triumph he reigns today he reigns [Applause] he reigns he sits above it all you may be seated this morning it's wonderful to enter into the presence of the lord again and worship him because he is worthy he is worthy to be praised if you believe that say amen we want to go to the lord in prayer there are many who need to be lifted up to the lord in prayer today and we want to do our part to agree with them for healing and for provision and for direction and whatever the deeds might be we ask that you would remember the service today in lagrange that the lord will continue to move and bless and strengthen and help and heal and provide and we just believe that the lord is going to help them sister anita yesterday they had come home after the service friday night because brother curry likes to be in his own bed and uh getting ready to get in the vehicle to go last night she got a bee sting or a wasp sting or something and uh she's used benadryl and oils and prayer and she said she still woke up this morning with red splotches from her head to her feet and i told her she would still be radiant even with red splotches i knew the lord would shine out of her life he has certainly done that in these past few services so we want to ask the lord to do something about that allergic reaction and give her victory over it because if it's that bad sometimes it makes you feel different you can feel something going on in your body may god give her grace we saw the lord i don't think there's anybody who were in any of the meetings who couldn't say without any doubt we saw the lord building up brother steve service last sunday night he was at one of the lowest points that i've ever seen him and as the service went on he began to feel better he didn't look a whole lot better but he began to feel a lot better and beginning monday morning all the way through the week god began to build him up and strengthen him i heard from them every day they got a they were in for something they have to go several times this week they had to go to the cancer center and uh they were doing something and they got word that the new oncologist wanted to see them at a certain time the next day it's hard to hear news like that unexpected and your heart not sync so she sister anita immediately reached out and said please pray we know that we have to go and we have to see what's going on and i think it was friday maybe that they ended up being there before the service that night is is that right i think it is and uh the oncologist a new oncologist that they'd only seen one time before in the course of their conversation he said to her said to brother steve i am a god-sent doctor to you and you know that that's somebody said well that kind of sounds arrogant no no no no not to me maybe you take it that way i took it with somebody confident and uh he said he believed in the power of prayer forgive me for leaning i'm just trying to rest my sciatic nerve it's been busy in the car this week um let me just tell you this you just got to hear it there's no no need to pray and pray and pray and not know that it's making a difference and so this was on friday at 4 30 service starting at 7. we're currently getting his fluids via iv received good news even though he hadn't had chemo in two months we have not lost any ground gain prior to the hospital stays his system was getting so weak that they they stopped doing the chemo and there was great uh anticipation speculation that the tumor would increase in size when it was not being blasted by the chemo and that it might even perhaps spread beyond its perimeter but i want you to know the news was it has not moved on no there was no shrinkage but such minimal movement in the tumor that they were very impressed at what had happened you know we're we're believing that god is keeping it at bay until he moves it i'm not satisfied with that but i'm going to praise god for that the numbers are what they watch they were concerned at the cea and the cancer markers would start rising without treatment but there was barely a change at all which means it's completely remaining contained they're scheduling a ct scan in three weeks and now they're going to focus on rebuilding his system with fluids with concentrated nutrition iron injections and all of these other treatments to help cause his bone marrow to start reproducing more and to do it correctly to reproduce good cells his weight loss to hydration and anemia have been concerns of the doctor they want to target that now their sides side effects of the chemo and the anti-fungal meds and even the blood thinner that he's on and [Music] anyway dr akbar told stephen that he was a god-sent physician who would be praying for him he believes that it's all up to god how long a person lives he was really lecturing him on his appetite and food intake but with gentle concern his words were i believe we can help you to live another 52 years if god wills it we have to thank god for that we wouldn't want our brother to live 52 years in the condition that he's in right now but we don't believe he has to stay that way so we're really now listen he came to the service friday night already looking better he climbed up on the music and played some which sunday night he was not able to do he had not been eating hardly anything at all and it was hard he was drinking insurers and whatever the other one is uh he would just pick at his food but friday night they went through a park at wendy's parking lot or whatever it was drive-through and uh no it was a cookout where we were and he got a meal and she got a meal he ate all of his hamburger which was a miracle he said to us last night i used to take a bite and that's it i don't want no more ate all of his meal and started helping her eat her meal then he testified that one thing he had a real uh diverse what a aversion uh was eggs and um he said that couldn't stand the thought i want you to know if somebody don't feel good their stomach don't feel good eggs are not something i crave either he said he couldn't stand the thought of an egg but he woke up saturday morning after being touched friday night and eating a hamburger and he ate two scrambled egg sandwiches two and uh so by last night his color was good and his strength was good he crawled up on the music he talked more than he'd been talking and was prayed for again in the service and the lord really has touched him so would you continue to pray that god will strengthen him and give him victory according to his will it's a very difficult situation there because those people love them so much and and they're just trying to fill in and they're and they're trying to do it delicately because they want him to know he's the pastor and yet they just work together as a little team i want to thank you i know i'm taking a moment i can do that i want to thank you for your support uh last sunday night friday night and saturday night i want every person who was in any of those three services to stand if you were in any of those three services i want you to stand up look around get this on camera if you can i want everybody to see how many of the folks went and made the extra effort to be there let's let's just i want to thank you i really do thank you so much for making that effort it meant so much to them you may be seated but i want to do one more poll i want the though any of you that were there all three services i want you to stand last sunday night friday night and last night look there so we had a good representation every night uh we had like 45 last sunday night we had 32 friday night and we had somewhere around 22 23 something like oh 26 wonderful good i'm glad you counted i didn't last night and that means that all three nights we made up the majority of the congregation and it meant so much to them last sunday night the musicians just jumped in led worship and they were so happy to have josh helping with the music and ben helping with the music and it was just a real blessing they were every person in that little group came around and said now they also said brother shelly please come in the morning but we couldn't be there today we wanted to be here but anyway i wanted you to know that it meant something to us it meant something to them and i just pray that god will help them they're going to continue to need his help we want to go to the lord in prayer over those needs we want you to please remember uh brother abe

be done trust and obey believe god and say i believe i believe god give him another praise he's worthy [Music] yes he is you may be seated this morning we've got to hurry along because we want brother greeley to have plenty of time to preach whatever god has placed on his heart as a body as a congregation we want to say to aunt deborah how sorry we are for your loss i think you know how faithfully we all prayed we really prayed and we saw the lord move didn't we and somehow in his sovereign will he just said i'm going to come and take her now it looked like from what i understand from the family and i saw the service i i was comforted and touched by the service the memorial for crystal i appreciated the ability the technology to be able to be there through the stream and if i understand from the family right her living her her quality of life had been so greatly reduced that they would have liked to have kept her many many many many years if she could have had a good quality of life but that was not returning to her and uh you know sometimes that's so hard when you see someone that ought to be about young and strong and and you see that they're really and it's hard on a person to have to be cared for it's it's nice a day or two to be waited on and taken care of but after a while it's it's humiliating and it's degrading and it's hard so we're we're going to continue to pray for the whole family but i wanted you to know as a body we've all certainly prayed for the family in the same fervor that we prayed for crystal i want you to prepare to give your tithe an offering to the lord today this is the the normal offering that we would take on any service for the tithe and the offering we want to give is unto the lord we see what god is doing and we want to give him thanks when brother greeley comes he will receive the offering for the principal payment it's the first sunday of the month we're giving god thanks for what he has done and you know there's just hardly two services that come that that it doesn't grow a little bit now it only grew 30 dollars from tuesday night till today but you know what that still blesses me it blesses me sister joyce did you see the picture i sent you before service did you happen to see it no i got a yes mariah thank you mariah wants to remind me about birthdays i have a list here darling thank you you're so sweet uh in that sweet sister joyce now tell me again she's she's a cousin i should have known that right this is april walls and we know of the family through sister joyce and they prayed for her sister joyce made some aprons for her mother and uh i opened a card today i'm thinking who do i know in richlands virginia and i open it up and it was from sister joyce's cousin a 50 check an offering for the church and she said uh that sister george made these aprons and she said we wanted to bless a ministry that she cares about so here is a an offering and you know that's just so thoughtful perfect timing because i labeled it it's already in the bag and labeled for the principle so in god good he's good amen let's see nathan and chad how about you all coming to receive the tithe and offering this morning we're going to come to you we want you to give as unto the lord and just know that if you have a separate uh offering for the principal save that for just a moment sometimes people include it on their check that's perfectly all right we can divide it but it makes it easier if we can have it in separate in separate offerings it makes the bookkeeping a little easier but we will uh just be honest with you we'll take it however you give it we'll take it in pennies because the novus is getting it we're giving it to them to get out of debt in god good nathan pray over the tithing offering would you father in heaven we thank you for blessing us and we know that all that we have come from you what yes amen in the offering pray that you would bless the gift and the giver yes of your kingdom jesus christ amen while they're receiving the offering let me mention that today oh she slipped out today is sister george greeley's birthday so make sure that every person in here has a moment to wish her a happy birthday and to give her your love and let her know how thankful you are for her life among us tomorrow would be brother west's birthday our first birth his first birthday without him our first time without him on his birthday or around his birthday and so we want to give god thanks and we want to remember his family especially this weekend that god will strengthen them i know some of them are gathered there with sister west sister tebow is your birthday coming up i think it's on wednesday is that right so we want to say happy birthday to sister tebow let's let's give her a hand clap she's turning red that's what we're after sister joyce is in here now let's give her a happy birthday clap and then on thursday is mary beth's birthday you all were all born the same week it looks like uh on thursday august the 5th is mirabeth's birthday let's give her a happy birthday clap sister teresa who's not here today her birthday is on friday uh so we're not gonna clap for her she's not here but we're gonna pray for her we're gonna pray for her we're gonna bless her on her birthday and had the lord not call brother west home this coming saturday would have been their 66th wedding anniversary that's a lot of anniversaries and so we want to send our love to sister west today and let her know that we'll be thinking about her and we've so enjoyed these last times that she's been able to come down it's a little hard to say goodbye to her on a sunday afternoon knowing that she has so far to drive by herself but she's always so sweet to text stacy and say i made it i made it and she wouldn't consider not coming as often as she possibly can because she enjoys the fellowship being with us and i'm thankful that we can that we can have her we have a special treat this morning and that is that ben and zoe and abigail are going to sing for us is that right so let's worship the lord as they sing one of my very favorite songs you have to listen close to these words but they are powerful here's wonderful with you everyone [Music] listen to the words of this song this [Music] morning go plead with your mother with the words of hosea as he sent his children to extend his mercy so they journeyed down the old path that led to much destruction and all the while their loving hearts were hurting their hope was crushed inside as their compassion was denied the woman they so loved seemed like a stranger heartbroken and alone they took the long road home for sitting now rain hope seemed going to change one day the word was told some slaves were being sold a restless love said jose a seeking one by one they brought them in so beating down with sin within his chest his anxious heart was beating all at once she caught his eye from his lips the bids were high she could not believe the voice that she could hear but he through judgment take her life forever and his pain and strife what would happen as she saw him drawing near her i've come to take you home i know that you've done wrong but for you i'd give my life through the sorrow pain and strife i couldn't let you go let's leave the past behind love conquers one more time hallelujah he took her hand and said there's a new day just ahead i've come to take you home listen now i've stood in that same place bound by sin a broken slave from the depths of my despair i've prayed for mercy i heard his word the price was paid on the cross for you that day take my hand now child and welcome to the family i've come to take you home i know that you've done wrong but for you i give my life through the sorrow pain and strife i couldn't let you go [Music] let's leave the past behind love conquers one more time he took my hand and said there's a new day just ahead i've come to take you now

let you go let's leave the past beyond you have to love conquers one more time he took my hand and said there's a new day just ahead i've come to take you yes yes how many of you are glad he made you twice his who created you from before the foundation of the world brought you forth in just the right hour that you were to be born in and then paid for you you were already his and he still paid for you hallelujah that made you twice his so thankful for that and think what a good job ben you really carried it well and god bless these girls for putting their harmony to it too wonderful thank you jesus it's true would you stand again we're going to welcome brother greeley to come and share whatever it is that the lord has placed on his heart to inspire us he's going to receive the the monthly principle offering for the for the church property and he's going to give us the word and we're not looking for a lesson we're looking for whatever god has for us today if it's edification well it'll always be edifying even if it's corrective but whatever god has that's what we want and the only expectation we have is that he will obey the lord amen and that's really what we desire today lord we ask you in the mighty precious name of jesus that you will use our brother for your glory today let there be no hindering spirits able to break through the anointing of the holy ghost let it speak directly to our lives let us leave here with a desire to walk closer to you to live a higher life being ascended with you in glory we thank you for your servant today and we ask that your mighty hand be upon him as you minister to your bride here and around the world in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen do you mind if i just receive you without a song and you just go ahead from there god bless you i didn't necessarily have to receive this principal offering but i'm going to give you some information and perhaps it'll help you with your own finances at home we started this journey in march of this year when the lord spoke to us that he wanted us to get rid of the debt on this property that we had to make a concentrated effort to get rid of the debt by god's grace that's what we have done and that's what we are doing we continue to do that when we started this journey in in march the uh the pr the they call it the current mortgage balance i don't want to scare you i'm just going to give you some numbers here but the current mortgage balance at that time was at 480 000 plus at this moment the current mortgage balance is at 360 379 000 and we give god praise that it is at this point you have given one hundred and eighteen thousand seven hundred and fifty four dollars and ninety five cents one hundred and eighteen thousand seven hundred and fifty four ninety 95 as of today and so i want you i'm going to say this because it may help you somewhere along the way with your own home that you put your mind to paying off your own mortgage as well but i want you to notice that we have given one hundred and eighteen thousand dollars directly to the principal and if you do any calculation you realize that we also made some four thousand dollar payments four or five forty one hundred four or five payments since march where did it go where did that 20 000 worth of payments go interest all right so january of this year the interest was at two thousand two hundred and eighty six dollars per month at this point the interest has come down almost exactly six hundred dollars since january that means the interest is now at 1 687 so because we have faithfully paid on the principle it has brought the interest down that much that means more of the payment is going to the mortgage i'm not doing this to uh to get upset about i'm showing you that this is how mortgage uh works i don't understand all of the what is the word amortization uh i don't understand all of that all i know is the bank is out to make money and they want to make a lot of it at the very beginning so one year from now this loan will have to be refinanced but by the grace of god and his mercy i am looking for this mortgage to be gone in the name of the lord jesus christ that's the reason i gave you all of those numbers because we're one year away from having to refinance but by the grace of god and his help i'm looking to not have to refinance that's what we're looking for we don't want to refinance the property the mortgage we want it to be paid off so we're just going to do our part to faithfully give as the lord blesses us we're going to give according to what we have uh we don't want anybody to go into debt to help to pay this property off no that's not what we're after god's able to take care of his business and he's able to speak to us directly and he's able to help us to get this paid off and here's what i believe if we are faithful to put a concentrated effort in paying this property off i believe that somewhere around this world that god has somebody that can give us a boost when we need it that's what i believe so if you've brought your offering with you today i want you to hold it in your hand or pray over it and ask the lord to as you give with purpose that he would bless you and that it would be multiplied father i want to thank you for your faithfulness to us this is far above and beyond our ability but it's not above yours and so we want to say thank you for what has been given and i want to thank you for what your people have brought with them today for this principle offering and we give it with gladness to you to see the word of the lord fulfilled in our in our time god the promises that you have made to us and to this property we want to see it fulfilled now god i pray that you will let your blessing be upon the giver may it be multiplied for the purpose of the kingdom god i pray that you would multiply it in the lives of the believers as they give lord with purpose that they'll see a bountiful harvest and it'll make them want to keep giving and giving and giving that's just who you are i bless you and give you praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen david will you come and hold the offering bag we'll let the people bring their gift to the lord and sing how great is our god how great is his name thank you lord how great is our god how great is his word he's the greatest one [Music] of the mighty red sea and he said i will lead you put your trust how great is his word he's the greatest [Music] and he said i will lead you put your trust will you stand and sing once again how great is [Music] he is the one that we put our trust and confidence in that's right without him we're nothing turn with me if you will today to isaiah chapter 11 isaiah chapter 11 thank you very much musicians the lord bless you we thank god for you and for your gift that you share with us isaiah chapter 11 reading familiar portion of scripture here from verse 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with the righteous but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reigns shall we pray before you're seated our father we want to thank

world to different nations and so we just want to bless your people wherever they are and as they tune in to hear the word of the lord today god we want to be tuned in to the holy spirit and what the spirit of the lord would say to us in this hour god i am asking you to once again hide your servant behind your cross the the work of the cross lord i pray that you will speak to us and you do and say what you want to in this house today we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you may have your seats today i'm going to be like the white house press secretary and i'm going to circle back to isaiah 11 after a while i'd like hebrews chapter 12 in the amplified hebrews chapter 12 and verse 11 hebrews chapter 12 and verse 11 in the amplified for the time being no discipline brings joy but seems grievous and painful but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness in conformity to god's will and purpose thought and action resulting in right living and right standing now brother shelley has been preaching to us about these he's called them offices of the holy spirit and so you may hear some things that he's been saying it's just part of what you listen to and when you listen to something that starts coming out but one of the offices that he has been talking about was the spirit of truth which we find in john chapter 16. but the the disciples were instructed we find in the book of john that the disciples were instructed at passover time jesus told them to go and into the city and they were to look for a certain man and they jesus described to them what this man would look like and what he would be doing and he told them follow that man because that man is going to have the key he's going to have the the access to a room that we need for the passover seder and so the the guys they the disciples they did as jesus instructed and they went and they found this man and they found the room that jesus was describing to them the book of john does not record it thus but the book of mark and luke record that it was a large upper room where that they went to now the scripture does not spell it out but i think it's a pretty neat idea to think that these men as they went to this large upper room and they gathered for the last supper as we have come to call it uh the pale the pace pesach the passover seder they gathered with jesus jesus and the disciples were in this large upper room and the scripture records that when they were in this large upper room and after they had eaten that jesus laid aside his garments and he began to wash the feet of the disciples now this was not a normal part of the passover seder it was something that was very odd to the disciples in fact peter told jesus no no no no yeah you you're not going to wash my feet and jesus explained to him that it was necessary it was part of uh it was a part of jesus calling and it was going to become a part of the believer's calling to where that we would walk in humility one with another and we would be servants one to another and as as jesus is washing the feet the john records that jesus revealed to his disciples that there was one who would betray him and they all began to question is it me is it me am i the one am i the one that's going to betray you and jesus just kind of threw out a hint the one that i dip with is the one that it's going to be and of course we know that that turned out to be judas and then jesus told judas whatever you're going to do i want you to do it quickly but jesus did not all of the sudden become a nervous man because that he knew what was going to happen jesus was still with his disciples in this upper room and he began to talk to them about how that it was necessary that he go away and that if he did not go away that the comforter would not come if he didn't go away that they would not be able to come to their full maturity and so he just lays out for them all of the things he starts out by telling them love one another and then he goes on and he tells them that i'm gonna go away for a while and i'm gonna prepare a place for you so that where i am you can come and be with me also but while i'm away i am not going to leave you without a comforter now you've got to uh just kind of picture yourself in the in the place of the disciples these were men that came from a variety of backgrounds they were they were they lived some some strange lives and maybe some wicked lives and and diverse in their upbringing and their their level of what they had uh as far as finance but they started to follow jesus they started walking after him and jesus was always there in a human form and i can imagine because the scripture records some things about some of these disciples peter especially because peter was he always seemed to be running his mouth and he said some things that got him in trouble and so by these uh indications in the scripture i figure that there were times where jesus because he was there in a human form he had to say now get back in line time you know you did that yesterday and i reprimanded you for it i i said something to you and it's time to get in line and so he's he's explaining to these 11 that were left he's explaining to them i am going to go away and i am not going to be here to to put you back in line every time but i want you to know that i'm going to send the comforter i am going to send the spirit back to you and that spirit that i'm going to send back to you is going to be to help to keep you in line so we look at the scriptures jesus continues to to tell them not only is the comforter coming but he explains to them about the oneness between him and his father and when he explains the oneness of him and his father he also goes on to tell them this is what we're desiring for you as a believer oneness with the father and he goes on to explain to them the only way for that to happen is for you to be in the vine he said i am the vine and you're the branches and you have to be in the mine in order for that to uh to bring forth the branch you know a branch can't just be out here somewhere by itself listen nearly every day of my life people love to plant trees next to their house and when they plant these trees they're little this is what the builders do they go and they dig a little hole and they put a little bush and when the builder walks away the bush is still little but because that all of those branches are connected to that bush and life continues in that bush they get taller and taller and taller and then when i am trying to work on the side of a house there's trees that sometimes on a new house are this tall but as time progresses people don't pay attention to their trees and their bushes and they don't prune them as necessary and so they become very large and they grow up as tall as the roof is so what i should be able to accomplish with a stepladder i have to use an extension ladder to span over top of the tree or the bush and i have a pair of pruning shears in my van and i usually am pruning a branch or two off of whatever tree or vine or whatever this is and i tell you all of that to say this within a few days if i happen to carry that stuff to the house to put on the burn pile the green goes out of it and it turns brown because it is separated from its life source i am the vine and you are the branches and unless you abide in me you're not going to be able to produce any fruit we have to abide in the vine and then if jesus goes on to tell them you're going to have to expect persecutions are going to come your way and then he comes down to saint john chapter 16 and he starts explaining to them the works of the spirit in their life he said verse 7 of chapter 16. i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you now i want you to pay attention the next couple of verses and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged then he tells the disciples nobody wants to hear what jesus just told his disciples i have yet many things to say to you but you can't bear them now i got a lot of things to say to you but you can't bear them now howbeit he didn't leave them without he didn't leave them just in a lurch how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so now jesus again he's with this he's with this group of disciples and and i don't know that it's true i just find it interesting that it was called a large upper room and when the day of pentecost came they were in a large upper room and i would just find it very interesting to think that where jesus had explained to his disciples about the comforter and the necessity of the comforter that those people would be in that same room when the comforter came i think that's the way my lord works he likes to do things that way if it isn't that way it doesn't matter it's just nice to think about but he told them that i'm going to reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment now jesus is speaking to them and he's telling them that there's going to that is going to reprove the world now i would like to read you definitions you'll have to forgive me i am so scattered with papers today merriam-webster dictionary for the word reproved to scold or correct usually gently or with kindly words second definition to express disapproval of censure then i'm going to give you two obsolete definitions according to merriam-webster dictionary but i think they still fit in this case the third one is to disprove or to refute and the fourth one is to convince or to convict now in the old testament if you see the word reprove which we read in isaiah chapter 11 see i'm circling back uh in isaiah chapter 11 the word reprove if you look at the hebrew definition in the strongs it means to be right or correct to be reciprocal or to argue and it gives some other definitions which go along with meriam webster in the new testament the greek word would mean to confuse or admonish to convict to convince to tell a fault to tell a fault or to rebuke now when we think about the word convict we or my mind immediately goes to a court of law and how that when someone is found to be guilty of something or uh they're they're accused of being guilty of something are taken before a court of law and then they have to be proved guilty uh to to bring about a verdict through a jury or through a judge and they're convicted of their wrong and then they have to pay a fine or be sentenced to jail that is their conviction their sentence to spend time of some sort or to pay a fine and uh if you end up in jail they call you a convict so now we have jesus speaking to the disciples and he's telling them i want i i'm i'm i'm going away and i am going to send back the comforter because it is necessary that i do this and when he is come i want you to notice there's something that could not happen when jesus was on the earth in a physical body so jesus had to leave the earth and go back to the father and he had to send the comforter the holy spirit the very spirit of the living god back on the believer and he had to do it because he is going to reprove the world of sin because they believe not now understand as we have preached over and over and over again from this pulpit that there are hundreds and thousands and maybe even millions of people through the years who were sinners and they remained sinners all through their life and they died sinners they never called on the name of the lord not at all and because of that the scripture tells us that there has been a place prepared for the devil and his angels and for the disobedient and those that don't want to uh go to the lord and have their sins remitted so he came to the war he sent the comforter he sent the holy spirit back and he he did it in such a way that he was able to reprove the world of sin now this word again to reprove means to convict now when god brings conviction when he brings a conviction into a life now this may seem very elementary to you but just please hang on with me here when god sends conviction to a sinner there are sometimes where that there is some kind of a bodily emotion that happens you hear some of these old-time preachers like charles and john wesley and and some of those others that would preach and the conviction power of god would come down and people would physically shake in their in the pew that they were sitting on or on the bench that they were sitting on and they would be convicted by the power of god and they would turn their lives over to the lord there are others who have been who have had the spirit of conviction on them who did not respond to the spirit of conviction and it turned around that they walked away and god never gave them another chance now this may seem unfair as a human being this may seem unfair that somebody would only get one chance but i i call to your remembrance today that our god is sovereign and he knows the hearts of men and women and he knows that another chance is not going to change anything not going to change anything so he sent the holy spirit back to reprove the world of sin because they believe not on me so you have some who never will say yes lord this is very difficult for some of us to hear but it's true nonetheless because god will not take one person out of this earth without giving them a chance to repent whether it's once whether it's twice whether it's ten times that's up to god it's up to god and he knows he knows so then he says that it was necessary to reprove the world of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more now again jesus is with his disciples in a physical body and he is walking with them and he is the very epitome of righteousness he is the very essence of righteousness he because he has submitted his will to the will of the father as he goes along and he's maturing as you recall brother shelly spoke to us over the last couple of service and he reminded us about that adoption process and and when he got to mount transfiguration when the voice came out of heaven this is my beloved son here ye him there was a there came to the completion of the adoption where that god was now satisfied with all that had been packed into his son on the earth and he could say hear him he walked the earth for how long i don't know but he walked the earth uh a while longer went to the cross but there came the time where that he said i have to go away because i'm going to reprove the world and when i reprove the world i'm going to reprove them of righteousness now here is what i would like to say and if i take this in the wrong context forgive me but this is the way that i saw it as i was looking at it he's going to reprove the world of righteousness now everybody could say that was jesus that was god himself walking around on the earth that was the god man of course he was righteous all right now i'm going to go away and i'm going to send the comforter back i'm going to send the holy spirit back on believers and i am going to show that even though i am not there there are people who will walk in righteousness there are people who will so surrender to the holy ghost they will become so surrendered to my righteousness that i will be able to convict the world of their unrighteousness because they're able to see men and women who have walked in righteousness through the baptism of the holy ghost and have continued to walk in this righteousness all right and then he said i am going to i'm going to reprove the world of judgment because the prince of this world is judged we know the prince of this world is the the devil that'll serpent the devil he is he is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he's trying to find out whoever he can to devour now i don't need to inform you people that even though the devil is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and he can never devour me as a believer he's going to make an attempt that doesn't mean he's going to leave you alone and because that you as a believer have chosen by the grace of god by the foreknowledge and the predestination of god you have chosen to walk in his righteousness it can't be our righteousness because our righteousness it doesn't amount to anything it's filthy stinking to him but if we will let go of our rightness anybody in here like to be right i like to be right but the older i get the quicker i am coming to realize that i may as well just shut my mouth sometimes because my memory is not as long as it used to be i don't remember all the details so i'm just as well to just hush because in the end does it really matter with things of this life i mean when it comes to the word we've got to be right that matters but when it just comes for the sake of an argument about whether i'm right or whether you're right go for it you can have it i i just i i don't that's a battle that i don't need to face i don't need to fight it i just i'm coming to the place where let me bow down and wash your feet let me just let me just kneel in humility and that's not just us just to say words i i want to be so right with the holy spirit i want to know that the spirit of god is working in me and that it's working his righteousness and then my righteousness is laid aside so as jesus is telling these disciples he said that it was necessary for him to go away and it was necessary that the comforter came back and that he wasn't going to be walking around on there were in the world anymore as far as a human being as as the man jesus but yet there was going to be a group of people he was going to he was going to bring salvation to individuals and give them the holy ghost and and through the holy ghost he he was going to bring the spirit of conviction upon them now according to the oswald chamber said conviction of sin is one of the rarest things that ever strikes a man it is the threshold of an understanding of god jesus christ said that when the holy spirit came he would convict of sin and when the holy spirit rouses the conscience and brings him into the presence of god it is not his relationship with men that bothers him but his relationship with god and when our relationship with men is affected it does affect our relationship with god and when we can come to the lord and be bothered that our relationship with god is affected because of our relationship with men then we are under the spirit of conviction and we have a choice now and that is to repent i want to read something to you because i found this to be very interesting or words that express really what i i am trying to get across to you today concerning conviction and and i'm going to say something here in just a moment but in the upper room as jesus continued teaching about the ministry of the holy spirit he said that when he come he would reprove the word of sin of righteousness and of judgment john 16 8 which we have read he said jesus what he meant when he said the holy spirit would reprove the world of sin we've already talked about this word it means to expose to convict or to cross-examine [Music] for the purpose of conviction as in convicting a law breaker in the court of law the holy spirit will begin to deal with the heart of an unbeliever and by the time he is finished that lost sinful soul will feel exposed and convicted as the holy spirit enables that person to hear the word of god for the first time the razor sharp sword of the word will penetrate his soul until he feels as if as if he has been cross-examined on a witness stand finally the court will be adjourned the verdict announced and he will know on the inside that he is guilty of sin this is precisely what a sinner feels when the holy spirit convicts him of sin now again this was a basic teaching to a sinner but i am talking to seasoned believers who are under the headship of the lord jesus christ with the baptism of the holy ghost with the comforter on the inside the spirit of god on the inside and god is still using conviction or cross-examination by the word of god the word of god is the law that he is using to do the cross-examination with this is precisely what a sinner feels when the holy spirit convicts him of sin listen to this it is amazing how long a sinner can live without conviction or godly sorrow for his behavior how long he can be nearly numb to any sense of wrongness regarding his sinful actions i want you to know this is not just for a sinner that has never called on the lord this is something that a believer can face in his lifetime once twice many times through and sometimes we are convicted but it's amazing how long we can be nearly numb to any sense of wrongness regarding our actions of unbelief the bible said that sin has made unbelievers to be hard-hearted spiritually blind and past feeling see ephesians 4 18-19 but those factors change instantly when the holy spirit touches the human soul and exposes its sinful condition or its condition of unbelief exposed naked confronted that is exactly what a sinner feels when the holy spirit wakes them up to his true spiritual condition it is the work of the holy spirit to convict sinners of their lost condition the whole world stands guilty before god romans 3 19 but the lost don't realize they are guilty until that moment when the holy spirit reveals it to them now i would like to go back to what they see said up above and that is when a believer goes for an extended period of time he walks in numbness or any sense of wrongdoing a believer can be in this same condition and he doesn't even realize that he is guilty even though the word is going forth and he walks under this numbness or this sleepiness or whatever it is but there comes a spirit of god all right jesus stated no man can come unto me except the father draw him john 6 44. this drawing of a person's heart to jesus is done through the work of the holy spirit jesus reminded us of this when he said and when he come he will reprove the world of sin without the work of the holy spirit to expose our sinful condition we would still remain in darkness today lost and without god it is amazing that a person can be in sin and even understand that he is in sin anybody got loved ones knows they're in sin they don't want to do anything about it yet nonetheless he fails to grasp the real eternal consequences of what that means he can even be in a church service where he hears about sin and acknowledges that the sermon is true and that he's that he's a sinner yet leave the service and continue living the same lifestyle he did before he got there now this could baffle a mind of an immature believer but for mature believers we can see that there are people who can sit under the sound of the word and they can leave now brother branham taught us that when you come in you're either going to leave better or you're going to leave worse so that ought to be a question that we ask ourselves every time we leave the house am i better or am i worse so now this sinner he can leave a service and continue to live the same lifestyle he did before he got there but something happens when the holy spirit begins to work in that person's soul he lovingly cross-examines that person until finally he brings him to a place of confrontation it is at that point that invisible scales fall from the person's eyes and he truly sees for the first time that he is in sin there's something that he can only that can only be real revealed by the holy spirit when he convicts of sin the sinner absolutely knows that he is a sinner and once the spirit of god has lovingly brought that person to the place where he finally sees it for himself the person has a choice will he stay in sin or will he repent and turn to god you see i read this because i see that as brother shelley has been preaching to us concerning the the offices of the holy ghost and how that the spirit wants to work in us to bring all of these things into a believer because he wants to bring us to a level of spiritual maturity as jesus was on the earth because god is going to reprove the world of righteousness because he's going to have righteous seed that are coming to the full maturity where that he can say this is my beloved son hear ye him me that can be me yes that can be me that can be you in fact i don't i don't even like to say it can be because i've come a little bit further i believe it will be i am one of those sons that is going to come to complete maturity where that all that the father was and he poured into christ christ went back to the father and the holy spirit was poured out now all that he was is being poured on the believer that is what i believe that we are coming to that place of the full maturity of the believer now in the course of convicting in a natural court of law there is something that they call circumstantial evidence and circumstantial evidence is proof of a fact or a set of facts from which one could infer the fact in question for example a suspect is seen running away from a murder scene with a weapon in his hand this is circumstantial it's circumstantial evidence that he committed the murder there may not have been an eyewitness but someone saw this man running away with a knife in his hand and so this becomes circumstantial evidence and this contrasts with direct evidence which would be such as an eyewitness who testifies to seeing the suspect shoot the victim this becomes the direct evidence now i'm not a lawyer not even close but i did read enough to find out that the weakest argument or the weakest evidence is a person's opinion thought i had it written down because yes an opinion is the weakest evidence and so if i'm sitting in my easy chair and there's some circumstantial evidence that is thrown out you see this this is how a lot of people are convicted uh this is how people get convicted in the media because there is only a certain amount of information that is put out there and there are plenty of us that sit in our armchair and we come up with an opinion of our own and we throw that opinion around because we're only getting a certain amount of the information and and we know that that's what the media is out to do especially in our day our hour that we live now because they're trying to change the whole tide of of of our republic they're trying to change the tide of of morality they're trying to change the whole scope of the nation and so if they can get people to form a strong enough opinion until that people will go out and protest and they'll go out and and say this is what we want this is how that things start turning the tide you know i can look at politics and i can see how in the world did so much liberalism get in the government how did it happen and uh you know with the mindset that i have i i think you know if a person would just think logically how could they come up with such an opposite opinion of what i have but somehow they came up with the opinion that they have and they decided that they wanted to run on a ticket and and and move their agenda forward because of an opinion and so as they go out and they promote their opinion and somebody that is also watching maybe the same thing that they're watching then they come up with the same opinion or their opinion is tilted toward that politician so then they get the votes and slowly the tide changes it changes it changes it changes until that a state turns into uh where that there's more liberal voters or democrat in our case voters then there are republican voters this is because of opinion you can look at churches all across this nation and if you go back 50 60 70 years ago you would see that there was a changing of the tide in the churches it was because that the opinion of people started to change they were more open-minded and the they began to preach a more social gospel and they got away from the word and so as time went on and and now i've never been a part of a denomination but i've heard brother shelly talk about it enough and i've heard enough things to where the the board of directors or the the the presbyters or the the deacon border whoever it might be that has some authority over the bylaws of a church they come in and as people want things to change they get rid of the preacher that was preaching from the word and they bring somebody in that lines up more with their opinion this is how that the word of god has become of none effect in the churches at large and it will become of none effect in our lives if we do that same kind of thing and so we as a bride church we must make sure that when we look at an opinion that we go back to the word with that opinion and give it a cross-examination by the word now the holy spirit he comes and he convicts us and he cross-examines us so many times when we do or say something or we act in a certain way or we take on something and the holy spirit comes on the believer and he starts to cross-examine us and he cross-examines us by first of all he just puts his his finger on a place in our life and we'll call it a place in our mind because just as faith started as a as a uh we'll call it a mental conception well it started out as intellectual faith somebody came along and said you need to be saved there's something that sparked we'll call it the conviction of the holy spirit something sparked and so then things progress through our life and the holy spirit has brought us to this point where we are right now and we'd like to be totally mature believers aware that nothing would offend us nothing would bother us nothing would get us out of sorts nothing would cause us to become irritable i don't like to fear feel irritable i don't like to i don't like the feeling and when i do the best thing for me to do is to go hide to hide in my room somewhere and pray it through i'm telling you the best thing for me it may not work for you but the best thing for me is to go and get in my room and start talking to the lord and many times turn on the voice of the prophet and start to start listening there's a soothing there and then pretty soon i work my way through it and i allow the holy spirit to get it out of my life i don't like that feeling but you know why i don't like that feeling because it's the spirit of god dealing with me that it doesn't belong there that doesn't belong there and because i'm his i respond to him i allow him to cross-examine me is this of god is this is this that i'm feeling is this of god is there are you wanting to take me someplace are you wanting to show me something in your word to be able to take me higher or is this something that i have taken on and because of an opinion or circumstantial evidence you see friends we get bent out of shape too much of our life by circumstantial evidence things we think we've heard things we think we've seen things we think we've observed things maybe we have observed we get bent out of shape just all been out of shape but the holy spirit is right there to convict us to bring to us a thing where that we say lord i know that this is not bringing me into a closer walk with you this is not bringing me to a place where that i feel like that i have the victory no it's it's something where i feel like that i am defeated i i feel guilty you see when a person is before a court of law they bring them either to guilty or not guilty now there are people who plead not guilty that are and there are other people that they persuade in different ways again i'm not a lawyer but you hear enough about cases that again are tried in the media and and they tell them plead guilty plead not guilty and all of these things are are to bring about an end result they're trying to keep people out of jail and so they have a lawyer to advise them well again we have an advocate that advocate be in the holy spirit and he wants to keep us out of prison he wants to keep us out of jail out of the prison of our own mind he wants to keep us from a prison of going around the hamster wheel he wants to keep us out of that prison of battling that thought over and over and over again he wants us out of that prison so what does he do he puts his finger on this thing and he begins to cross-examine lays the word on it lays the word on it is this feeling is it bringing you closer to god is it bringing more of the fruit of the spirit into your life is it bringing a a a a capstone uh onto the pyramid the building is it bringing the fullness of the godhead bodily into your life is it bringing all of that fullness into your life or is it causing you to live in a prison of your own mind where that you are crippled and you can't go any farther with god because you're stuck in a place because you continue to refuse to allow the holy spirit to cross-examine you and bring you to a place of conviction so when he brings me to a place of conviction as with a sinner a sinner has to say i am guilty i am guilty of this sin of this transgression of this unbelief i'm guilty of it so now i have two choices will i remain there and continue doing what i want to do or will i allow the spirit of god you see his blood the life of the blood of jesus christ is still powerful enough it's all powerful it's not lost any of its power when i say it's powerful enough i don't want to indicate that it's lost any of its power it has never lost any of its power though we have come over 2000 years since the crucifixion the life of the blood of jesus christ is still as powerful as it ever was and it will cleanse us from all of our unrighteousness all we have to the the fact is friends it is already done it's already complete the holy spirit desires for me to say yes lord yes i will agree with you on this fact that that the conviction power of the holy ghost has come in my life and he has cross-examined me and he has found me to be guilty whatever it is whatever it is there are people who play around in church with pornography they play around with adultery and fornication and they they they mess with those kind of things they they continue doing awful awful things to and still come to church and and and they sing the hymns and and they may even run the aisles they may even speak in tongues and i don't even ha i or any other preacher or any other person we don't have a enough understanding i don't think to put a person in hell unless god would say it's thus saith the lord we don't have but people play around for years with these things and i don't know how many times the spirit of god might send conviction on those particular things but i believe that many or most of us in this congregation i don't know about out there i don't know where you live but i believe by the grace of god we're moving up and instead we deal with other things jealousy and envy and hatred and strife and malice and discontentedness and and all of these things that are just their their works of the flesh along with adultery and fornication their works of the flesh and we have got to bring them under the control of the holy spirit and when he convicts us of these things by the word of god and he cross-examines i don't know what you're sitting here today dealing with i don't know whether you've been knocked out of a job i don't know whether you've been knocked out of a position i don't know whether you're jealous over an old flame i don't know whether you're mad because somebody got on your toes i don't know what you're facing today but when the spirit of god comes with the conviction with the cross-examination just i encourage you to let him let him have it and say lord i am here in your presence today to let the conviction power of the holy spirit be so real in my life and i don't want to just feel the conviction i want to respond to the conviction of the spirit of god by saying here you go lord forgive me and cleanse me of all unrighteousness friends the holy spirit the holy ghost the comforter the gift of the holy ghost how many times if you study the message of the hour you would hear brother branham talk about people that that speak in tongues and it sounded like dry peas off of a a dry cowhide and he he would talk about that because he was watching people who would speak in tongues and they would they would get all excited in church but their life didn't measure up to it they weren't coming they weren't they weren't yielding to the conviction of the holy ghost because they wanted to go with the trend that was at that time and brother branham that that's why he kept saying that he wasn't against any of the gifts of the holy spirit he wanted a people that were walking in accordance to the word of the word of god so that they could be fully operational in the church body and that it would help the people even when they were in their own private time where that they could pray in the spirit when they didn't know which way to turn they could pray in the spirit and the spirit could handle the situation all of this conviction of the spirit what we have been hearing about the holy spirit being our advocate being our comforter being the spirit of truth all of these things that we have been hearing and will continue to hear this is because the holy spirit wants to place his very own life in us in such a way that we are carrying the fullness the fullness of god in our lives now as the musicians are coming i would just like to quickly go back to uh isaiah chapter 11 because i just want to share with you something that i felt i feel like that the lord spoke into my life and if it was only for me okay but i felt that i was to share it with you and this is what i felt like the lord spoke to me when he he said that the spirit of conviction was the prelude to the spirit of the reverential fear of the lord the spirit of conviction was the prelude to the spirit of the reverential fear of the lord that means that it has to come before the spirit of conviction comes before the reverential fear of the lord comes when the reverential fear of the lord comes to us if i recall correctly we have been told that when the reverential fear comes it is not going to be the same kind of of anointing or emotion that we might have when we're running the aisles and shouting and speaking in tongues and walking the back of the pews and being real loud but when the reverential fear of the lord comes it's going to be such a glory of god that we're going to want to be on our faces before him because it's in the reverential fear of god when he comes down it is going to burn out anything that's left that's unlike god the final capping a finality in our lives and so when he comes with the spirit of conviction it is a small way that he gets us to respond to him one thing at a time one thing at a time when i think back over my life and the foolish prayers that i have asked the lord at different times in my life and then i mature a little bit and i i remember that prayer that i prayed and i realized that if god would have done what i asked him to do i probably would not have survived it and so god in his mercy and his love to his bride one thing at a time he deals with us he deals with us he deals with us and some things he has to come back to because we don't respond in the right way and so he comes back to it and maybe maybe he just comes back to it and we still don't respond in the right way and so he deals with a couple other individual things and then he comes back and he deals with it friends the spirit of conviction is not your enemy the spirit of reproof is not your enemy chastisement is not your enemy the chastisement of the lord is not something that we should shy away from it is something that we should embrace when he comes we should be willing to say yes lord and i'm here to tell you that the only reason that we say no lord is because we're enjoying our place whatever it is we're enjoying it stand with me the spirit of conviction the prelude to the reverential fear of god in all of these things see god doesn't he doesn't judge after the sight of his eyes or the hearing of his ears he is god who knows all things i may not be able to see everything no no maybe it's about it i can't see everything you can't see everything i have tried to judge things many times in my life by circumstantial evidence and i have formed many opinions that i wanted to present in the court of god's law so silly so silly to bring my opinions to god's court and say god this is my opinion i wish you would bring it around my way so silly friends let the spirit of conviction come upon you be in your life and respond to it favorably because as you respond favorably to the spirit of conviction god will come and he that guilty feeling that you have that guilty feeling that we feel the holy spirit comes and then when we repent of these things when we repent and say lord i am the guilty party and i am asking you to wash me clean david was guilty he was the guilty party what did he do he come to the lord wash me clean purge me lord with his up wash me clean blot out my transgressions that's what david said he he wanted to get back to a place of worship if you've lost your worship if you've lost your ability to worship as david did i would encourage you to say lord purge me purge me cleanse me created me a clean heart o god or wash me of all of this lord that i have held on to the opinion that i brought into your court it's of none effect oh god it is useless in your sight i have to come back to the word lord you're not building a bunch of babies you're building sons and daughters ones on whom that you can place the crown of adoption and say this is my beloved son hear him now father as we stand in your presence today i am asking you lord i can only ask for me i can only ask for me cleanse me lord of unrighteousness god words that i have spoken that do not edify things and opinions that i have created in my own mind and they have become larger and larger and larger until that they're no longer even circumstantial evidence but they're just uh they're just a tiny piece of truth and a whole bunch of fabrication lord god i call on you for myself that you would cleanse me and purify me god you have allowed the spirit of conviction on us on this body of people on individuals because you desire to place these offices these these works of the spirit in our life and you're not going to give the the the signature the checkbook the the the the signet ring you're not going to release it lord until we do it the way papa wants it done so lord i ask you work in me work in these people those that are in this building those that hear this service work in us i pray in the name of jesus christ lord i pray that you will go to that one who is who is still playing around with pornography lord that that they're still finding ways to sneak around and lord you've convicted but they enjoy the euphoria of it i pray god that you would bring deliverance even this day in the name of jesus christ bring deliverance in the name of jesus christ oh lord oh lord god you deal with it a jealous wife without cause god i pray that you will turn a spotlight on and that you will deal in this situation god that you will bring peaceable fruits of righteousness in the name of jesus christ and that you will cause this home where there is jealousy lord that you will bring it about that you will bring peace back in the home for the sake of the children for the sake of the husband and the wife i pray god that you will deal with this and bring deliverance in the name of the lord jesus christ i thank you for it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i don't know who that's to but i just hear too many soap operas too many soap operas in the name of jesus christ deliverance from this by the power of god deliverance break this thing i pray lord break the spirit of it break the joy of it break the the the pleasures of it oh god in the name of jesus christ till

prelude to the reverential all of god i think it would just be appropriate for us as god has just done some cleansing today if we would just lift our hands and say lord i have allowed you to bring conviction and to scour me out and so lord i'm lifting my hands and asking for you to baptize me once again with the holy ghost and with fire oh baptize me again lord with the holy ghost and fire oh i
