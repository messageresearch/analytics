TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I got a feeling we're going to face something bad I got a feeling it's not going to turn out all right I got a feeling this is going downhill from [Music] here you ever had a feeling like that I got a feeling that I better do this I got a feeling that I better do that I wonder why we don't ever get a feeling to tell us to not have dessert we've got feelings to tell us everything else but very few to tell us you don't really need that especially that second piece those feelings are battling like a battling Ram against the word but the word always remains Rock Steady God's people are led by the spirit the sons of God are led by the spirit of God they're not led by feeling they're not not led by a shaky sensation they're not led by by anything other than the spirit of God which is the spirit of the word the word that lives your Bible is God in printed form that's powerful it's God in printed form but alone without the spirit the printed form of the word becomes a what a letter and the letter can kill but the quickening life that's on the word by Revelation brings stimulation doesn't it it brings something that quickens us and causes our faith to be anointed to move forward sometimes somebody will say you know how do I know what is the will of God and and sometimes counselor would say the first thing to you is do you have a desire well I need to tell you that's only part of the equation you may have a desire desire but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the will of God is it according to God's word you may have a desire for something but it may not be God's word for you amen so there's a little bit more involved uh he said desire without knowledge it's not good when you're waiting on the Lord It's You In the book it's you in the word and it's prayer and it's setting yourself apart and you're not running for entertainment but you've come to a place of desperation I want to tell you something if you think you can make yourself desperate you can't but he can he'll squeeze us you you know one day you could care less and the next day after he squeezes you you really feel a dedication to seek the Lord and to seek his face amen we cannot be a hasty people we can't be a people that make our decisions and then demand that God come help us out of the mess he might he may he's good he's merciful don't you think when you leave here tonight that God is Not merciful he's merciful he looks over sometimes our messes but the Bible does tell us there was a time that he also winked at ignorance but that's not the hour we're living in now in this hour He commands men everywhere to do what to repent to set their record straight so if you're going to want God in the future to come and help you on that job that you just had to have that business that you just had to start you better know you folks we better know that we're moving not only in the mind of God the will of God but also in the timing of the Lord
