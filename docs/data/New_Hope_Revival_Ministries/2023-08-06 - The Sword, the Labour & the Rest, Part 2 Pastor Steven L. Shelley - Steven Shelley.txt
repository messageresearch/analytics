you'd like [Music] it doesn't take very long to figure out why that Elisha called for a Minstrel when he was irritated and agitated because of a couple of kings that came before him that he really didn't want to talk to but they needed a word from the Lord and his Spirit was already agitated because of who was standing in front of him but when the atmosphere got right true you don't think the piano makes a difference you don't think the drums make a difference the bass guitar your voice changes the frequency of the atmosphere lifts you up into a realm that you did not know [Music] the right song with the right words with the right Melody with the correct singer changes the atmosphere and it can lift you if you let it change your [Music] atmosphere there can be 120 people sitting in this room and a hundred of them look like that they've been caught up because they allowed their atmosphere to be changed and 20 it looks like that they lost their best friend because they didn't allow it to change their atmosphere they didn't press in they didn't allow the Lord to let the atmosphere around them change because they wanted to hold on to what they had but we can have the change that we need in our lives but it is Our obligation to allow the spirit of God to water the seed and the spirit of God Waters the seed with our praise we are actively [Music] involved with our own

and uh you're going to be blessed does anybody remember what he preached the last time he was here about four years ago in don't die you got to get the influx I hope he doesn't see this he's about this tall he's a very quiet man until the M gets in his hand and then he will preach up a storm and he has been I want you to know that he has been my faithful friend all of these years and uh he has hosted me there many times and he will testify he always does when he's here and and we have so many memories together and we have seen God God bless the Bible Believers Church don't you like that name Bible Believers that works real well and uh he believes it and he means it and and uh if you heard the interview that I did with him the last time he was here you'll know that he believes at the Bible God's word is the absolute for the bride in this hour but God has used that little man I'm telling you he has used him in a way around the world but particularly in the nation of Ghana and uh that little church I thought it was a big church when I was there the first time but uh I stood in a in the in the in the middle I stood in the corner like that and the brothers were one way and the sisters were another way like that so there was a building going that way and a building going that way and the pullit in the corner kind of and now what God has blessed them with a huge facility with a balcony and uh they're they're Uptown they're they're ahead of us we we still use projectors they've got big flat screen screens all over that building so that people can see way way in the back and uh in the big conventions they still fill the building up and they put tents on the outside and uh we are so blessed and so honored that he would be with us so please do everything you can to be here next Sunday and hear my dear friend precious brother in the Lord and he loves this church and he loves us and I know that he will bring us a word from the Lord and how many of you know that's what we need so that's next Sunday and we're looking forward to What the Lord Has uh today is Sister Teresa's birthday is that right happy birthday sister Teresa God bless you I have to be hon honest I didn't get my birthdays together today I I glanced on the phone just a moment ago I didn't write them all down it's on me I was slack I had some other things going on in my mind this morning and I didn't get that done uh if you have a birthday this week let me see your hand anybody else I didn't see too much when I glanced on the calendar does anybody know of somebody uh brother and sister West uh their wedding anniversary is this week and is it I don't know if it's Tuesday or Wednesday it's the 7th and today's what the 5th so today is a six so that'd be tomorrow I know that brother West is not here but I know that that day is a is a special day and a hard day so I want you to know we're going to be praying for you when I think when when I hear this uh total announced weekly I I can see him I see him he's so so vivid in my mind's eye that grin that real smile that he would have he would be through the moon to know that we were almost finished I remember when he said to me finally he said brother shell I don't want to let you down in any way but he said I'm getting old now and he said I think you might ought to get somebody else to sign on the loan with you this time he said you don't ever know you just don't ever know when it when it would be and that was hard that was so hard for me because he went with me in the beginning and signed my credit was nothing I didn't have any credit much and I had way more debt than I had income and uh it all really hung on him my name was on there but it was years before I had anything they could have took but he was uh so sure that this was God's church and this was God's Will and that it was going to be what God had intended it to be that he hung everything he owned on this property and God made a way and we were able to continue I just

Lord Brother Paul drown he texted here and he said thank you Jesus for Janette brother sister Janette and brother Benny West and that is the truth I am so thankful to God I uh really want to commend Chad last night yes and and I want to say to B today it was awesome you know I am never quite whole when my kids are not with us um it's just the culture that we have tried to build and I'm so thankful that Joshua made it home safe and Benjamin and Jenna are driving now from Mammoth Springs and I didn't tell you where they were some of you know but Jenna's Granddad brother Siler turned 90 this weekend 90 years old he has 10 children and all 10 of them were there surprising him for his birthday and I don't know how many grandchildren but I'd say there was 75 to 100 people there or more I wanted them to be here this weekend but I wanted them to be there too how many people can say that you you are celebrating your granddad's 90th birthday and he's an old soldier of this message and uh when we told the story when when Jenna's parents were here some years back but in that tape where brother brandham saw the pillar of fire and there was a wall if you know anything about the Tabernacle the window into the nursery was on the other side of the wall so he wasn't looking through a window he was looking through a wall in the spirit and he said I just saw that Pillar of Fire moving into the nursery there and it's hanging over a woman's head uh uh and he called her did he call her by her husband's name he didn't say he didn't say oh no he said Mrs Ivonne West is that what he said I I couldn't remember if he said Mrs David West meaning the wife of but it was Mrs Ivon West and I was telling brother Tim uh Siler Jenna's dad that story when they came here to visit and he got all excited and he said I got to call my mother in the morning because he said I've heard this story my whole life and he called his mother and came in here that Sunday morning and told us he said I've heard that my mother was in the nursery and she was standing next to Sister Ivon West and she felt that presence when it come over her head what a small world and uh so brother Siler was on his way to amarilla when the when the highway patrolman stopped him when they heard that brother brandom had passed or had been in the accident he was he got in the car and started driving straight he said I don't know what I was going to do but I was going to get there one way or the other and he started driving straight to amarilla and the highway patrolman stopped him and said there's a call on the radio from your wife and they were able he was able to get in touch with him and tell him that brother brandom had passed away and and when he describes that moment of not knowing what the future holds I'm so glad tonight that we're not hanging on one man anymore we don't have to worry you don't have to worry if something should happen to me you don't have anything to worry about you've got the one with you that'll take you all the way he never leaves his children without something to help them and lead them and direct them but but he said he just he said I just could hardly drive through the tears because we just didn't know well it must have turned out all right he's 90 years old and still talking of the testimonies of what God did so that's where they are would you give thanks for our musicians for the worship leaders I I wanted to say we just didn't miss a beat we just didn't yes I miss them I miss my son I miss my daughter-in-law uh but we didn't miss a beat in the worship it was God used Chad in a mighty way and God used Ben in a mighty way today and these special songs that were sung and it just just so wonderful I just feel so full and so emotional and don't we serve a wonderful God we do we serve a wonderful God uh let's go this morning back to Hebrews if if you will and uh may God give us some time in his word today and uh we have the doors of the sanctuary closed because someone is cooking uh in a crock pot or something in the in the blue room there and uh whoever it is they're like me they like onions oh they must really love onions because that smell begin to permeate through the sanctuary so they uh in the back there so they close the doors one of these days however God chooses to make it happen one of these days we're going to have a nice place where they can bring their stuff and sit it out on a counter in a fellowship hall and we won't have to blow the circuits here heating up all the food in crockpots down the hall I come in last night there's crockpots all the way down the hall in the back and one of these days the Lord will surely bless us but we couldn't even consider that with all that hanging on us but God is certainly getting that out of the way there's a vision that yet has to be completed and God is counting on us to do it so there there's a there's a bright future if he terries and one day it'll be more comfortable no more tents no more stepping through the grass and stumbling on the uneven ground and and sweating like mules like we had to yesterday one day God Will Make A Way I believe that Hebrews chapter 4 beginning in verse 11 let US Labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart do you believe that God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated come on David and take your position David is going to read that for you in the Amplified again I want you to get it I want you to remember it he's going to read it again uh in the Amplified and he is going to uh pause and he's going to do it with great enthusiasm I meant to say that we want to we want to make sure that there's not a lot of gathering we I don't like to close those doors because when we do there's more Gathering that goes on out in the in the vestibule and uh I don't want that I don't want there to be a lot of gathering going on out there and so uh I'm going to ask some of the brothers to kind of keep an eye on that if you're out there the couch is not a place for you to sit unless you're deathly ill and I don't know if that's where I'd want to be if I was deathly ill I think I'd want to be in here where the atmosphere was just right okay David uh Hebrews 4: 11 and 12 in the Amplified come on let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves yes that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and Disobedience into which those in the wilderness fail now you know that is serious isn't it next verse for the word that God speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative hello energizing and effective making it what active operative energizing and effective it is sharper than any two Ed sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul and the Immortal spirit and of joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing exposing and sifting sifting and analyzing analyzing and judging and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart now now what are we talking about we're talking about the word of God it has the ability to do all of those things now now d Avid I want us to go back to where we were last night when we left off and I want you to read Genesis 3 verses 1 through3 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made right that's right and he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not e eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die is that all of it now read four and five for us and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil how many of you can quickly recognize that twisting of God's word so we discovered last night that the serpent sowed a seed of resentment into Eve by lying to her about God's motives if the enemy can cause you and I to doubt the motive of God why would he allow such thing is that if we begin to doubt and judge his purpose and his motive and try to figure it out then we cut ourselves off from fellowship with him this word that the serpent sowed it it incited Eve's emotions now I want you to know that we teach that there was a physical act that followed but I want you to know it wasn't a physical act and then the sewing of a seed of discrepancy it was a mental thing before it became a physical thing it was an emotional thing before it came became a physical thing and uh that is what we should emphasize because we know that that physical thing is not likely to repeat itself but the enemy continues to seow his seed of discrepancy which can be resentment or unforgiveness or twisting the word just a little bit to suit our own needs he continues to do that I would not I wouldn't just say on a regular basis I would say on a daily basis he desires to insert that so I think that sometimes followers of this ministry and message have really done a a disservice to the truth that God has revealed to us by constantly harping on the physical act I am not denying a physical transaction took place not denying it at all it's the only explanation that we have why it had to be blood it had to be blood why did it have to be blood because it was an exchange of blood that started the whole fall and so it had to be blood to redeem us back to our original state the only only reason the only explanation that we can have scripturally for the fact that it had to be blood was to be able to look there and see that there was a physical transaction or a physical contact that took place there in the garden and and message people they just love it I don't know why they love it they're Billboards you know the voice of God was was selling these Billboards and bumpers Dicker you think I'm going to put a bumper sticker on the back of my car that advertises Original Sin do you really think that's how we're going to reach the lost by blowing their minds don't you think that God has given us a truth and it's precious and I want to tell you something it's right you're way too late to give me your version just so you know you're way too late to give me your version they've tried it in this church before and I don't buy it I know what happened there but I'm not going to put a bumper sticker on there and I don't have to go around telling people all the time that it wasn't an apple it wasn't an apple because that's a one-time deal it's important to know because by knowing that we understand the bloodline and it reveals to us the trail of the serpent that goes all the way through the scripture to the hour that we're living in today but what we need to be aware of is not that physical act what we need to be aware of aware of is how the enemy is constantly trying to inject us you know that's what a snake does he likes to stick his fangs in you and empty come on that Venom that's why they tell me I'm not a snake expert and and he's not here Brother David but the brother is maybe he can tell us something about it I don't know a whole lot about it I'm not going to study it I'm not going to study it and I'm not going live with them in my house I can tell you that right now you're better people than I am much better if they're in there I don't know it and you better hope they don't show up cuz if they do I ain't going to find out I'm not going to interview it and ask it what kind it is I can tell you what kind it's going to be when we get through with it dead every one of them remind me of the garden I can't help myself they'll tell you I go wild on them I've had my own kid say it's dad daddy all the Revenge of the Fall just gets on me somehow I'm going to finish it it it they tell me that a baby a baby snake it can be more dangerous than a big one because that little baby hadn't learned how not to insert and and get rid of everything it has it just gives you the full load of Venom a and that's just like that load down devil he he waits until somebody gets weak he waits till somebody has broken fellowship with the body and then he comes in with a with a full load ain't that right of his Venom and he doesn't turn you loose until you have swallowed his lies so that's why we have to constantly be vigilant and we have to Be watchful and we have to be prayed through and we have to stay in the atmosphere that brother gy was talking about today so that our emotions don't lead us away from the word they will if you've got unsanctified emotions and all of us do they will always lead us away from the word and we have to watch that I mean we have to watch that and so that that once once the serpent now remember that was Satan who entered into a beast that had already been created and uh it didn't slide around on his belly we we don't find it acting like that at all we find out that it was made very similar to a man evidently so much so that the seeds could be mixed which means genetically there had to be a tremendous amount of similarity there but what we saw after the fall was a curse of God come on that that Beast because because it had yielded itself to Satan and when God cursed it he said you're going to eat dust forever you you're going to be on your belly forever and ever and ever which leads me to believe it walked upright until that curse took place and if you've ever believed that Eve you that little picture in your children's Bible come on now yeah of Eve standing there talking to a rattlesnake in a tree I have never met the woman yet I know one thing I ain't you will never find me leaned up against a tree naked first of all and second of all did I just say that you're never going to find you're never going to find me propped up against a tree talking to a rattlesnake no wonder they try to sell that to Children only a child would believe something so simple much more than that on an attractive creature you ever seen an attractive rattlesnake an attractive creature so much so that that Eve decided I'm going to have a conversation with this Beast amen and what he did was he appealed to her human emotion and uh it caused her to be poisoned with distrust of her Creator I want to tell you one of the most important things that you can cultivate in your relationship with God is trust sir I'm already preaching if we can learn to trust him and folks has he ever given us a reason not to trust him then why in our human element do we struggle so to believe that he always has our best in mind he constantly has our best in mind whether it looks like it or not you ready David Genesis 3: 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat you see the serpent began his assault on the human Mind by injecting it with that out Satan gained his way in by touching the carnality of Eve by using her Earthly nature to do so he inserted the seed of discrepancy and he then had a Channel with which to give her knowledge obtained in an illegal way and the fruit which was the price to pay of that excess was death I want you to know that was the most expensive exchange that had ever taken place because by believing that lie and yielding her mind and body to that lie death entered into the picture we know that it death was not a part of God's original plan for Adam and Eve are you with me that was not how it was to be but he allowed this because by allowing this to transpire he would be able to come and redeem All Mankind and so it was a part part of the Redemption plan but originally Adam was made the prophet even tells us that Adam was made to never die but because this seed of discrepancy was injected death gained access to the sons of God now he would always have something in her from that moment on there would always be a representation of that lie that Eve carried around in her and see she didn't know full Redemption like you do did you are you with me did you know that full Redemption is possible today so that when Satan comes to try to find an access point in your life there is none that's right how many of you want to live under the fullness of redemption we're not living there fully like we need to because all the enemy has to do is March up and we and he knows the place he knows our weakness he knows our V vulnerability he knows where we doubt he knows where we struggle he knows what emotion to play on you know our Lord I love this verse it's in John 14:30 David's going to read it for us John 14:30 this is red letter Jesus talking Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and ha nothing in me this is Jesus telling them I'm I'm not going to be doing as much talking and teaching as I have done in the past because that Prince of death the prince of this world is coming and when he comes he's not going to find anything in me that he can use this is Jesus talking he's not going to find any access point I'm shutting myself in and I'm going to make sure that there's no way listen you and I ought to rejoice when we read that verse of scripture we really ought to shout because if the enemy could have come in and placed a seed of discrepancy in our Lord we would have been in trouble but Jesus had confidence in the word that he was and he knew that Satan was coming and he knew that when Satan got there it wasn't going to be man to meet him it was going to be God the word to meet him and the word will shut down the devil any time of the day the word will shut down the devil even in the Midnight Hour anytime anywhere under any condition the word will shut down the LIE of the devil if you believe that say Amen so Satan failed in his temptation of Jesus you see that whole Temptation scenario that we read about in the Bible was Satan's attempt to leave a little hook in the Lord because he knew the day was coming that he was coming for his body and he was hoping that when he approached him in the last hours of his life that there would be a little hook remaining in there you go back and read that story this week and you'll find the areas that Satan was using to try to appeal to the Lord and try to tempt him to do this or to do that or to do the other and you'll find the remedy that our Lord used every time Satan it is written it is written it is written it is written even he referred people back to the physical word it is written it is written it is written and it worked and it worked so well it so shut Satan down that when he did come to him just hours before his death there was no hook there was no emotional place that he could put his finger that would distract our Lord not even in the greatest moment of his suffering if you don't know that Satan showed up in the garden of Gethsemane you ought to know it you ought to know that he was there when our Lord was in his deepest Agony you need to know that he was along with his father plus one you need to know that Satan was standing there in that Garden watching over him in his Humanity watching over him in his physical suffering you can rest assure that Satan saw those great drops of Blood The Sweat that appeared like great drops of blood you can rest assure that Satan heard his communion he heard him when and he said if at all possible let this cup pass from me but every time the Lord strengthened him every time the word strengthened him every time the angels ministered to him he was able to shut the enemy down so that Satan could say nothing we have no record that Satan even got a word out because there was nothing to put his finger on I believe God's going to have a bride he has a bride now I believe he's going to have a bride in these last days that will be so shut off we've gotten victory over our soul life we've gotten victory over our mind and our will and our emotion are we there yet no but we're marching in that direction so that nothing the enemy uses against us emotionally no rejection issue no jealousy issue come on now come on now no mistrust issue no human emotion no doubting God's motive none of that is going to be able to penetrate us all right uh uh now David is going to read Genesis 3:8 wait a minute before you do that David let me let me finish reading my note Satan failed in his temptation of Jesus to put any seeds of discrepancy or any negative thoughts toward his father in him but Jesus Took nothing the devil offered he could not be separated from the Heavenly you see that's union nothing that happened in the Earthly was successful in separating our Lord From The Heavenly I want to say that again it's PR profound enough for you to hear again nothing that the enemy was able to do was successful in separating our Lord From The Heavenly part of who he was that little bride's going to shine like that she's going to shine like that and nothing that happens around us or nothing happens to us is going to be able to separate us from that Heavenly part of who we are that eternal spirit of God that lives inside of us you see the devil knows that if he can accuse your father to you and you entertain those thoughts that he is not always good that he is not always kind that God is not always fair that he will be able to separate you from your heavenly father and he will tether you to the Earthly realm your carnality will weigh you down and you'll never be able to move in the realm of the spirit because you'll be so heavy with the Flesh and so heavy with carnality and so heavy with human emotion so Satan is constantly moving around in your life trying to do something say something orchestrate something stir up something that would cause you to think now is God really good is he really is he really fair and the word is is fair is is a is a inappropriate word for God because the Bible tells us he's just right and the enemy would approach you to try to convince you that he is not just but I'm telling you he is just he is caring he is allog together good he is kind and he loves you and in that moment when you begin to doubt God's motive toward you you are tethered to the carnal you are Tethered to the Earthly okay David Genesis 3:8 punch your neighbor everybody elbow him get them get them get them get them David and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden day after day after day after day Adam and Eve had had fellowship with the Creator in the cool of the evening he came down and walked among them so much so that Adam was familiar with the sound of his coming he heard him when he came into the realm he sensed him when he came into the realm and that day that's why the Bible says it this way he heard the voice of the Lord God walking a voice doesn't walk right but Adam was so familiar with with the sound of his coming that when he began to come in when the father began to come in Adam sensed that the voice was about to speak to him and what did the Bible tell us they hid themselves they ran and got in the bush and hid themselves why do you think they did that well first of all they had now realized they were naked did you know they always were yes did you know they were always they were created that way that's how you came that's how Adam came created no shame remember they didn't know there was anything they didn't know there was any evil they didn't know there was anything but good until that moment and when they did that Glory light the glory of God the cavod that heavy presence of God that had covered them like light they were really we could say that they were wrapped in light and when that fall happened that light begin to pull away from them and they begin to look at one another and they begin to realize all of a sudden hey we're naked and he has come down to see about us and so we better hide why do you think they would have done such a thing as that because they thought he came to do them harm you all going to help me Preach Today if you don't I'm going to sit down and play last night's tape and make you hear it all again I am cuz we got to go somewhere and I can't drag you all the way we're we're just laying the foundation for where we're going to go over the next few services so you don't want to miss some of this because you're going to find some personal application in this you know I think sometime we we get this thought in our mind that that God is out to get us well I could ask for hands how many I'm not but how many have ever felt that way at some dark point in your life God just out to get me and you you got to get that out he is not out to get you he's out to get you he wants you to be fully his he came to help Adam he came to help Eve he didn't come to get them he come to get him he came to embrace them God didn't mean Adam harm God came to help God was not hiding from Adam it was it was Adam who was hiding from God and God is the one who called out Adam didn't say where are you Lord but God said where are you Adam God came seeking man in the message the calling of Abraham paragraph 17 brother random said do you know why you're a Christian because God called you just a minute amen you never did seek God at any time no sir it's God seeking you no man at any time has ever sought God God sought man that's the very thing he was doing that day in the garden God was seeking man not to harm him but to help him Hallelujah God sought man no man can come to me said Jesus except my father draw him first now I want you to listen to this the very strain from the Garden of Eden instead of the Fallen sinner trying to find God it was God trying to find the Fallen sinner Hallelujah and I want you all to read the next phrase because it's precious he's still at that job he is still looking to seek and to save that which is lost and so Adam really had nothing to fear David read for us Genesis 3:21 you know this very well I've preached this hundreds of times unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them I I think this is I love this this was a nugget that I always took to the conferences when I would go and preach among the Pentecostals and the charismatics and you would think that that that somebody would have known that all along but you'd be surprised the pastors that would line up and say I've been studying the Bible my whole life and I never saw it that way you'd be surprised how blessed we are around this message to know the things that we know and to have heard the things that we have heard and they just say I never heard of that I I never had any and and then they begin to ask questions that's when it got tough cuz then there was some things you had to explain a little bit you know it it appears that Adam and Eve took some leaves down and and tried to sew them up and cover their nakedness a a and you know that won't work they just covered you know the little little little parts of their body little parts of their body you know uh they I I always thought that was a little fascinating that we don't read that they covered their mouth because that wasn't the sin [Music] hello that wasn't what was causing them the trouble it was the other parts and they tried to cover that up but that wasn't really enough it's not enough today a bikini will never do the job [Music] I I've seen more cotton in an aspirin bottle than some people wear out out in public can you say Amen you see people sometime dress these women dressed in oh it's a dress I know you I know that's what they call it but it don't look looks more like a tube to me it doesn't look like a dress and like a we've been told sometimes you look and you can't tell where they're on the inside fighting to get out or on the outside fighting to get in because there's as much on the outside as there is on the inside everybody been there and if it was an apple that opened people's eyes and kept them to see they were naked brother brandom said let's pass the apples how many of you believe if that had any effect on people we ought to pass them out because sometimes people seem to have no shame in these days hallelujah you know it's the truth but this verse is so precious because I can see God at a sewing machine amen it's figurative he he didn't have a sewing machine so he must have had needle and thread because it says he made coats of skins there had to be armholes they had to be made in such a way they would cover their body and God himself made coats of skin what do you think he did snap his fingers and and and fur furry skins appeared in his hands this is the part that used to get those preachers that say I never thought of that in all my life I never questioned where the Skins come from but I told them where the Skins come from God had to get them from something living come on now he had to find some animals there that had enough skin that could do the job and God himself ripped don't tell Peter y God ripped the skin right off of those animals shedding blood shedding blood there it is blood had to be shed a sacrifice had to be made a little animal had to give his life and shed his blood to cover what man had done there it is there it is in seed form God made them coats of skin and God clothed them that day amen he showed them how and the importance of covering up their nakedness he didn't come to destroy them he came to clothe them he came to cover their nakedness I want to read a quote here from the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives my that's a long title the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives David I'm going to get you to read the first paragraph which is 91 and let me have a have a sip of this and then I'll take over and then here is God's blueprint to Glory study it out there it is it's blood sprinkled all the way amen you can't lose the track if you follow the blood amen that's excellent excellent now you can see see just keep keep right with the blood and you'll be all right for there's a bloody footprint every step of the way hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now notice how God back there before he could do it now he could stand or even they could stand to receive he would kill them right now he had to because he is Sovereign he has to keep his word he said the day you eat thereof that day you die that settled it forever then I can see him back there when he killed these sheep you say were they sheep brother brandom I believe it he said he was the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world so he tells us that even the the the animal that gave its life was a type that's powerful isn't it all right let's go on and it was a sheep skin take it and throwed them back in the bushes and told them wrap up in these and come out and to receive and and I can see Adam and Eve pull these old bloody Flappy skins around them could you imagine a lovely beautiful body of those two perfect human beings now wrapped in bloody sheep skin I can see them stand out there God said Adam because you listen to your wife instead of me then I took you out of the dust and D D you'll return remember he couldn't die in the garden he had to get out of the garden before he could die paragraph 96 and Eve because you listened to the serpent instead of me you brought life took life out of the world you'll have to bring life into the world I'll multiply your Sorrows your desire shall be to your husband and so forth and then he said then to serpent because you did this we walked up he wasn't a reptile he was a beast walked up more subtle than all the beasts of the field bear me record that scripture walked up like a man and he had deceived her and he said and because you did this off comes your legs and on your belly you'll go all the days of your life and dust shall be your meat they're about to be exiled God has covered their sin he he has given them a covering he is about to drive them out of the garden into Exile David is going to read Genesis 3 and verse 24 so he drove out the man and placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherry beam and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life would you mind if I ask you to read it all again so he drove out the man he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherub beams yes and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life come on now nothing's going to sneak up on that sword you see he's turning every way that flaming sword is there and not only is there a flaming sword there but there are Chari beams there and you Church might remember I took you through the teaching on cherub beams anybody remember one time when we were doing the whole series on Genesis when we taught the first eight or 10 chapters of the Book of Genesis we got really down in there didn't we we found out that Garden was something else we found out that there were jewels in that Garden that grew up out of the earth a a and it sparkled that that place sparkled with the glory of God right out of the word I tell you it was a beautiful place and such a sad thing to know that Adam and Eve had to be driven out of that and what was that sword therefore David what was it for to do what what does that last phrase say to keep to keep the way of the Tree of Life to keep the way of the Tree of Life to guard the way to protect the way to keep the way it's the same word that was used when Adam was given instruction to keep that Garden to tend that Garden to take care of that Garden it comes from the same Hebrew word there so it was going to require some effort of the Cher beam it was going to require some effort of that turning flaming sword to make sure that the weight of the tree of life was protected the tree of life was meant to fully connect two Realms together it was a symbol of the joining together of the Heavenly realm with the Earthly realm it stretched into the air from the earth Between Heaven and Earth ready to unite the two together in mankind I want you to read uh Genesis I want we're going to do 22 23 and 24 from chapter 3 and we're going to do it in in the translation of baret now beet is the Hebrew uh word for Genesis and and and our dear friend of blessed memory uh Rabbi David fredman who spoke here from this pull pit on more than one occas cion uh has now gone to be with the Lord he did a a marvelous translation of the Book of Genesis from the original Hebrew and we have that and David is going to read these three verses in his translation of baret the Lord God said the man is like one of us knowing good from Evil so in order that he doesn't try to take anything from the Tree of Life and eat it then then live forever live forever with a fallen Spirit you see his Spirit fell oh the agony oh the sad sad sad Destiny of living forever in a body with a fallen Spirit separated from your creator if Adam would have gone up a a and and partook of the of the tree of life he would have lived forever but with a fallen spirit so God had to have another way he had to get him far enough away from it because eventually God was going to turn every man's heart toward the tree amen and Adam would find the same forgiveness that everybody else was going to find so I love the way that is translated David I'm sorry but read 22 again the Lord God said the man is like one of us now The Reason Why Us is used is because the Hebrew word is Elohim and the word Elohim means uh the all existing or self-existing one but in Hebrew it is a plural word and it doesn't mean a plurality of persons it doesn't mean an EXT listen carefully now it doesn't mean an external conference it's not three people sitting at a table let us make man in our image it's an internal conference can you see that it's it's God the Eternal Spirit of the father having a conference with himself and the Hebrew word Elohim expresses the wholeness of God while also expressing the multifaceted nature of God he is father he is son he is Holy Ghost he is healer he is savior he is deliverer Hallelujah he's many attributes the prophet tells us but all in one eternal spirit and so don't let that us throw you this was this was a a conference that took place within that essence of the eternal spirit of God and that's powerful to note the the the man is like one of us why go on David knowing good from Evil he now knows good from evil until that moment until that moment they didn't know good from Evil they only knew good oh does does that appeal to anybody H how many how many have ever thought about it take just a moment I want you to think of all the bad you you receive in a day all the bad news you you work with people who have always got bad bad bad always got something something bad always got an ugly word always got a dirty joke always got something negative you you just live in such a Negative world right now can you imagine an hour when that whole evil is ripped every bit every bit of that is separated from us and all that we live in is the knowledge of God oh my my my my my the prophet prophesied of the Old Testament about a time when the knowledge of the glory of the Lord would fill the Earth the land and the Sea won't that be a marvelous day that everyone who's left in existence is going to know they're going to know and discern the glory of God powerful read on David so in order that he doesn't try to take anything from the Tree of Life and eat it then Live Forever The Lord God exiled him exiled him from the garden of delight remember that's what Eden means go ahead so that he would Farm the very ground from which he was created now Adam is going to have to till the soil and farm the ground the very dirt the very ground from which he was created don't you like the way that's worded next verse and so he expelled the man expelled him then winged beings were stationed in front of the garden of delight along with the rotating flaming sword that guarded the way to the Tree of Life does anybody have a question now is there something predominantly floating around in your mind as you hear this language is anybody with me enough that you've got a question does it seem to me like somebody's missing from this talk Eve is is missing we've got two verses here that talk about the man being driven from the garden what of Eve I don't read anything about Eve the key is in the earlier verses of these of these scriptures where where God talks about in the beginning he he made them as one a and the Bible tells us in the New Testament as we mentioned last night that Adam was not deceived but Eve is the one taken in the transgression and what did Adam do he stepped up he stepped up a and he actually shielded her her he actually said I take full responsibility for her sin when he participated in the same act that caused her to fall you know he could have he could have divorced her he could have said you're dirty now help help me now I'm going to try to do this delicately he could have said you're dirty now you you you want you've two timed meuh think about it a minute you're no longer just pure to me you you you you've two timed me and now I don't want to ever look at you again but Hallelujah he didn't do that because Adam the perfect man created in the image and likeness of God he stepped up on Eve's behalf woo how many times could God have divorced us how many times could he have driven us into Exile oh but how many of you are thankful for the last Adam no wonder Paul said the last Adam he came along Hallelujah and stood between sin and our life he stood between hell and judgment and our life and so what you will find out is that in that moment of Exile when God was driving them out of the garden God had so accepted the substitutionary work of Adam Adam that he looked at him as one and when it says he expelled the man he expelled Eve as well but this language in Hebrew is telling us that now Adam has taken on Eve has has has technically let's say spiritually she has become a part of Adam again not physically not physically she's still walking there but there was a union that was introduced in that moment that's actually more profound than the fact that Adam was created with even side this is actually a little bit more profound because this is how God looks at a husband and wife they are not physically one they're physically two individuals but when God looks at them he sees them in a union that's so holy because it mimics his Union with his bride this is very powerful language here it didn't say and he expelled the man and Eve or man and the woman yeah but it simply refers to the man being driven out because the man had taken on that work of substitution it was now his responsibility to make sure that Eve got back to the Creator it's a husband's responsibility to bring his wife to Christ and then let her be one with [Music] Christ it's our responsibility to bring bring her back and say she's yours it's powerful it speaks to us of where we are that that word drove that shows up in that verse the phrase about being drove out it comes from a word that actually mean it's garash in Hebrew and it actually means divorce do I have that uh Austin did I leave that in the notes for you to put up or did I delete that out I thought I put up the Hebrew word there after that I thought I left it in there I didn't all right let me read it to you I made the mistake of taking it out the the word drove out or the phrase they drove them out it comes from a A Primitive Hebrew word that means to especially to expatriate or divorce it means to Cast Away to drive away to put away it is the same word used later in the Old Testament to describe the word divorce so there was a divorce taking place and Adam and Eve were driven out of that place of delight I'm telling you it's the sweetest place when we really begin to understand Eden we understand that for someone to say we're going back to Eden is still a very appropriate thing to say we're going to a new Heaven and a new Earth one day but I want you to know Eden was such a perfect example of the kingdom and where we're headed to can anybody accept that we we are in Exile even now we have been exiled from Paradise we have been exiled from that presence of God to come down and talk to him like like a man would talk to his friend our soul and our bodies created for the garden of delight you were created for that place you were created for that Eternal peace the passion and frustration of mankind is that he tasted of the fruit of the garden and he Longs ever more after it Adam was never satisfied he never was fully at home because he knew there was a place over there there was something over there now you may not understand this but you came from God we're not of that Mormon Doctrine the pre-existence of souls we don't believe that we existed as a soul but we do believe that we existed in the presence of God and I want you to know there's a long how could you have such a long how could you sing I've never been this homesick for before about a place you've never been well see you were there in eternity past you were there you were in his mind oh and sometimes I mean this this has happened to me multiple times through the years when that presence comes it feels so familiar at times it's almost like what the world says is deja vu it's like oh this presence is so fam familiar or to be this near to God for him to come down and be this near to us it feels so familiar you know what I believe I believe we're receiving memory I believe God is releasing memory to us of what it was like to be with him in the beginning if you were in his mind if you were in his thought then you were in his head so to speak and sometimes that presence comes and it feels so familiar and sometimes you look around the world you were born here it's all you've ever really known in the natural isn't it but how many of you would have to confess that sometimes you grow very detached this world is not my [Music] home what about this one one of my favorite ones I don't want to get adjusted to this world to this world I've got a home that's so much better I'm going to go there sooner or later I don't want to get adjusted to this world sing it with me I don't want to get adjusted to this world to this world I've got a home that's so much better I'm going to go there sooner or later I don't want to get adjusted to this world Hallelujah I'm going to read one more Passage and I'm going to close I'm really tired this morning and uh I don't seem to be able to get the groove and I don't want to make you sit through it and but I want to leave this with you so so you can get at least a a glimpse of where we're going it's from the same message the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives it's paragraph 103 he said how I would like to deal there just a little bit in Eden would you me musicians come for me please notice when they were driven from the garden because of transgression all the blessings cut off because of transgression and I think tonight that's what's the matter with the church all the blessings are being cut off because of transgression there there you are driven from the Garden of Eden now I want you to notice here come when Cain and Abel the two sons of Adam and Eve came forward to make an offering I believe the great cherubim was at the East side of the gate and that sword whirling back and forth guarded that gate there that entered into Eden now I want you to read notice this next next place right here it's beautiful to me notice fire the Holy Spirit fire guarding the gate that fire is important you you tell me the Holy Ghost is not important you tell me the fire of God is not important I'm telling you it's very important it's it it reveals the way it not only protected the way and kept the way it reveals the way the way to the tree of life is revealed in the fire of God the Holy Spirit Fire come we need your fire today the Holy Spirit fire guarding the gate and then paragraph 107 and today that's what guards the gate listen if you're scared of the Holy Ghost and Fire you'll never get in fiery fiery the sword of God fiery go God is a consuming fire watching that tree guarding that tree of life if you're afraid of Holy Ghost Fire you'll never approach the tree because there's something stands between you and the tree and that's the fire of God so you're going to have to be willing to walk into it hear me now if the fire is standing between you and the way to get to the tree of life you're going to have to be willing to walk through the fire didn't we sing that this morning with the in the fire God is not going to leave you he shows up in the fire you don't have to be afraid of getting to the tree because there's fire between you and the tree because the sword that was positioned there to keep man out until the appropriate time that same sword is the word of God and if you will realize this revealed message from the word the revelation of Jesus Christ is the sword that's pushing us into the tree so what kept us from the tree until it was time to get to him is now the very thing that's pushing Us in so let's say the sword that kept us out is now the sword that's driving us in the word that kept us out because it was a veiled mystery we couldn't understand it so we could never get in trying to follow it but God sent the Holy Ghost and he sent the message of the hour and now we understand the word and we realize this Revelation didn't come to keep us out this Revelation actually came to make us one with the Tree of Life who is M Jesus Christ somebody said brother gree this said me who is M is Jesus Christ she's part of the tree of life isn't she she's part of the tree of life how how did that happen because because she has to go through the fire to get to him you see there was a vision one time that helped us God sent a vision to this body that helped us one time there there was some there was some changes that went on I'm not going to go too deep cuz I'm closing now and maybe you could find something nice to play but uh to help me close and I don't feel defeated I just feel like we've done what we need to do today and we'll we'll we'll gather again we're going to have Fellowship I worked pretty hard last night and I'm happy I I'll be honest with you I was happy when we finished singing I could have gone then we'd been with God we've been with him today we were with him last night he's been so good but there was a change of order as some of you will remember and sister Alfreda is not here for you to go ask after the service so you'll have to try to figure it out yourself but there was a change of order that took place in the in the Dove and the eagle you see there was a there was a there was a brown Eagle in a vision that came and that to us it symbolized the prophet that wore a hat it's going to sound a little mysterious here because that's how the vision came a a and behind that brown Eagle came a a white dove does anybody remember that so in that Vision a brown Eagle came and then a White Dove came and then the next time the White Dove came first and it was leading something something was following that white dove now I want you to know that I believe that one of the very most important things that God sent this message to do was to get you and I to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost I know I know I know I know that the the most emphasis is on the Mysteries and that's because they don't know how to put the singular on the they know how to make the singular plural and the plural singular they they missed some things in there I want you to know I understand that the third pull was the revealing of the mystery I understand that a lot of that was already done and accomplished in our day but I want you to know that there's a lot of Truth in this message that sets the baptism of the holy ghost in a scriptural place and brother Brandon wasn't against emotion but he didn't want anybody thinking that because they had emotion that's a human reaction anybody can have Emo I without the Holy Ghost you can get caught up in the music and not have the Holy Ghost and so one of the things I appreciate the most about this message is how we are we are taught and how we can receive an understanding of the importance of having our own experience with God and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost for ourselves you've got to have the Holy Ghost you've got to have the Holy Ghost and you've got to have a no so not just on your flesh not just in your emotion but you've got to know that your human Spirit has been regenerated by his breath are you with me by his Holy Spirit and when we get that when we get that genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost there's so much that comes with it it's that authority to speak the word it's that authority to see the creative word of God operating Among Us Again Hallelujah and so I'm I'm I'm looking for uh this I'm rejoicing in what we see God doing because I believe it's just the white dove again the last time he came following the brown Eagle but this time he comes leading the way for something else and that's not another Prophet that's for the sons of God he's leading the sons of God forward that's what the dove is doing now Hallelujah that's why some of you are enjoying the Holy Ghost like you haven't in a long long time because God's getting us ready this word is about to come alive in us and when it does we've got a lot of work to do before we get out of here but it's going to be Supernatural work how many of you ready for that you you can stand with me if you will I'm going to ask Ben to come and lead us in worship and I don't want us to walk out of here solemn I want us to enter into this worship now I want us to enter into it with everything that we've got and I want us to thank God that he's been so faithful to help us along the way thank you Jesus hallu blessed [Music] assur Jesus is mine oh what a for Taste Of Glory divine air of [Music] Salvation purchase of God hallelujah born of
