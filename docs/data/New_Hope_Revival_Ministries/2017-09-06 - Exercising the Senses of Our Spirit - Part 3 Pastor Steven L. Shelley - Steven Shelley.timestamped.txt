[0:26] Wow.
[0:30] [Music]
[0:47] Praise the Lord. I'm Pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelley and you're watching The Eagles
[0:51] Cry. I am so happy to have you tuned in
[0:55] this week to this program. And I pray
[0:58] that something will be said that will be
[1:00] a blessing to you on your spiritual
[1:03] journey as you pursue a deep
[1:06] relationship with the living God. Yes,
[1:09] it's possible. It's not only possible,
[1:12] it's probable. In fact, it's positive.
[1:15] If you will pursue him, if you'll reach
[1:18] out for him, if you'll draw near to him,
[1:21] he will draw near to
[1:24] you. In fact, you could not even draw
[1:28] near to God or have the desire to draw
[1:31] near to him unless he releases that to
[1:33] you. Now, that's heavy, isn't it? But
[1:35] that's what the scripture teaches. When
[1:38] we have a hunger for God, it's because
[1:40] he's released to us the grace to have
[1:42] hunger for him. The deep calleth to the
[1:46] deep. There is something in the depth of
[1:49] your spirit, man, that longs to be
[1:53] restored to the fellowship that Adam had
[1:57] in the Garden of Eden. I hear a lot of
[1:59] people say we're going back to the book
[2:01] of Acts. And we are. We're going back to
[2:03] where there's going to be a body of
[2:05] believers in the earth who operate in
[2:08] the fullness of the spirit like the the
[2:10] apostles did like we read about in the
[2:13] book of the acts of the apostles is
[2:15] often called. But we believe it's really
[2:18] the acts of the holy spirit in and
[2:20] through the apostles. And the reason why
[2:23] we specify that is because we believe
[2:26] that God wants to do the same thing in
[2:29] our day. I believe there is a move of
[2:31] God that's breaking forth in the earth
[2:33] right now. We used to say it's coming.
[2:36] It's coming. It's coming. It's up the
[2:38] road one of these days, some golden day
[2:40] break. But I have good news for you. I
[2:43] believe that God is breaking through. I
[2:45] believe that God is rending the heavens.
[2:48] I believe that he's coming down with
[2:50] power, with authority, with healing in
[2:53] his hands. I believe that we are about
[2:56] to see a real transition in the body of
[3:00] Christ. Now, I don't know what's going
[3:01] to go on in the church because many of
[3:04] our churches are going to uh probably
[3:07] continue to pursue dead, lifeless
[3:10] religion. But there's a body of people
[3:13] that are planted in churches all over
[3:15] the world. And if their church is not
[3:18] going to pursue God, they're going to
[3:19] pursue him anyway because they're being
[3:22] called. They're being wooed. They're
[3:24] being drawn by the spirit of God. I am
[3:27] excited today. I'm excited about our
[3:30] study and we're going to get right into
[3:32] that in just a moment. But I want to
[3:34] invite you to visit our ministry website
[3:37] on the worldwide web at
[3:40] revival.org. All of our contact
[3:42] information is given to you on the
[3:44] screen. I'm trying not to spend as much
[3:46] of our 30 minutes inviting you to
[3:48] contact us, but I really want you to. I
[3:51] just don't want to spend so much time
[3:53] asking you. I want to spend as much time
[3:55] in the word as we possibly can. But for
[3:58] more information about our ministry, the
[4:00] best place to get it is on our ministry
[4:02] website. We want to go right into the
[4:05] word of God. And as we do, let me remind
[4:07] you, if you have any prayer requests
[4:09] that you'd like for us to join our faith
[4:12] with your faith and believe God for your
[4:14] miracle, this is a day of miracles.
[4:16] We're seeing miracles take place around
[4:19] the world. The dead are being raised.
[4:21] The lame are walking. The blind are
[4:23] seeing. The deaf are hearing. And I
[4:25] believe that we are well within our
[4:27] rights to say that Bible days are here
[4:30] again. Right now, the present situation
[4:33] is there are pockets of outpouring.
[4:36] There are tokens of places where renewal
[4:39] is taking place, leaning toward a move
[4:42] of God or what we would call a revival.
[4:44] And God's lighting fires. He's just
[4:47] lighting Holy Ghost bonfires. one here,
[4:50] one there, one over yonder. And the
[4:53] great thing about it is they're going to
[4:54] begin to spread. And when they do,
[4:57] they're going to touch each other. And
[4:58] when those fires that God has lit here,
[5:01] there, and somewhere else, when they
[5:03] begin to touch each other, there's going
[5:05] to be a blanket. There's going to be a
[5:07] blanket of fire. And we're going to see
[5:09] transition take place in neighborhoods
[5:11] and communities, in cities and regions,
[5:13] and states, and in nations. In nations.
[5:18] and are all going to be a part of it.
[5:20] No. I'm telling you right now, every
[5:22] man, woman, boy, or girl will not reach
[5:24] out and embrace it. But there are people
[5:26] who were absolutely, the scripture tells
[5:29] us, predestinated, chosen in Christ, who
[5:32] are going to begin to feel that
[5:34] overwhelming hunger for God. I mean,
[5:36] there are people right now who are uh
[5:38] sitting on a bar stool. There are people
[5:41] who are strung out on drugs, who are as
[5:43] far away from God seemingly as anybody
[5:46] could be. But in a moment, in a in a
[5:49] suddenly what we call a suddenly in a in
[5:53] a very instantaneous release of grace,
[5:56] people are going to come to themselves
[5:57] like the prodigal in the pig pin and
[6:00] they're going to they're going to think
[6:01] all of a sudden they're going to have a
[6:03] reality all of a sudden, what am I doing
[6:05] here? I need to be hungry. I need to be
[6:08] moving toward the kingdom of
[6:10] God. You really believe that? I do. I
[6:13] do. I believe people are going to wake
[6:14] up in the gutter and realize all of a
[6:16] sudden that the thing that they have
[6:18] fought against and run from is their
[6:21] destiny. And when they do, they're going
[6:23] to come looking for somebody who has
[6:25] life, who has power, who has authority
[6:28] in the spirit. They're not going to find
[6:30] that in dead, dry, cold, formal
[6:32] religion, but they're going to find it
[6:34] in a company of people that are being
[6:37] empowered by the Holy Spirit in these
[6:39] last days. a company of overcomers.
[6:42] Those who will not be overcome by evil,
[6:45] but those who will overcome evil with
[6:49] good, with the goodness of the living
[6:52] God. I'm excited. I am excited. Let's
[6:55] look to the scripture today. All right.
[6:57] We've been studying how, well, I should
[7:01] say, I was going to say we've been
[7:03] studying how to exercise our spiritual
[7:05] senses, but we're really laying a
[7:07] foundation to get to that message. We're
[7:09] coming to it. We're just laying a
[7:11] biblical foundation, doing some
[7:13] teaching. We've talked about how that
[7:15] which is born of the flesh is flesh.
[7:17] That which is born of the spirit is
[7:19] spirit. We've looked at some scriptures
[7:22] uh about Adam in the garden. We'll look
[7:24] at that again real quickly. Just kind of
[7:26] refresh your memory in Genesis chapter 1
[7:29] and verse 27. So God created man in his
[7:32] own image. In the image of God created
[7:36] he him. male and female created he them.
[7:39] And then in Genesis 2:7, and the Lord
[7:43] God formed man out of the dust of the
[7:47] ground. And that dust we talked about
[7:49] last time we were together. The dust
[7:52] particles speaks of dependency. That man
[7:55] would forever be dependent upon his
[7:59] creator. and breathed, listen, he formed
[8:03] man out of the dust of the ground and
[8:06] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[8:10] life and man became a living soul.
[8:13] Actually, he not only became a living
[8:16] soul but through this breath, the very
[8:20] spirit of God, part of the triune of
[8:24] God, triune nature of God, father, son,
[8:27] holy spirit, his very spirit, his very
[8:30] life was moved. It was breathed. It was
[8:35] transferred into Adam and he became
[8:38] alive. Otherwise, he would have been
[8:40] just a a clump of dust that had been put
[8:43] together. And we talked about that. We
[8:46] talked about this is how Adam was made.
[8:48] You and I were uh in he was in the image
[8:51] of God. We are in the image of Adam. We
[8:55] have been formed. He was our father, so
[8:58] to speak, in the things of of this at
[9:01] least in this earthly realm. Now, Adam
[9:03] had a very supernatural ability to
[9:07] communicate with God. how spirit to
[9:11] spirit he lost that ability through the
[9:14] fall through the sin of the garden of
[9:17] Eden. He lost that ability when Jesus
[9:20] Christ came. Yeshua the Messiah our the
[9:23] second Adam the apostle calls him in the
[9:26] New Testament. He potentially released
[9:30] that regeneration. He he released
[9:32] regeneration for the spirit of man. So
[9:35] when we become born again, our spirit
[9:37] man becomes renewed or regenerated or
[9:42] made alive, quickened,
[9:44] transformed. But the problem is we spend
[9:47] more time exercising the flesh and and
[9:51] the realm of the soul. And the realm of
[9:53] the soul, how how our flesh has
[9:57] communication with the earth is through
[9:59] our five senses. And again, there's a
[10:01] few more than five, but we usually hear
[10:04] more commonly seeing, hearing, smelling,
[10:08] tasting, and through touch or through
[10:12] feeling. This is how the body, our
[10:14] flesh, communicates with our earthly
[10:18] surroundings.
[10:19] Then the soul of man and some of that
[10:22] information that is gathered by these
[10:25] senses of our flesh filters into the
[10:29] soul. And and it's very easy to remember
[10:33] uh the doorways into the soul of man. If
[10:37] you use this little thing that a dear
[10:40] brother, a dear friend of mine, he said
[10:42] you you spell out my car. my car. But
[10:47] instead of spelling it my y, you spell
[10:50] it m i. My car. C A R. And you'll get
[10:54] them. The M is for memories. One of the
[10:58] ways that the enemy uses to access the
[11:01] soul of man is through
[11:04] memories. We have good memories, thank
[11:06] God, but we also have bad memories. And
[11:08] if the enemy can stir up those bad
[11:12] memories, it affects our soul.
[11:15] And what affects our soul goes both
[11:18] ways. What do you mean by that? What
[11:21] what is going on in our soul affects our
[11:24] body and what's going on in our soul
[11:27] affects our spirit. So, we've got to be
[11:29] careful. We've got to get some
[11:31] regeneration going on in our memories.
[11:34] We've got to ask God to cut us off from
[11:37] some memories that the enemy would try
[11:39] to use. I for the my is imagination. We
[11:44] all have imagination. We don't want to
[11:46] curse imagination. It's a gift of God.
[11:49] We don't want to kill it. It's God's
[11:51] gift. We want to sanctify it. We want to
[11:54] sanctify our memories. Set them apart.
[11:56] Good memories. We want to sanctify our
[12:00] imagination. We do that through prayer,
[12:03] through soaking in the presence of God,
[12:05] through studying God's word. And then
[12:08] conscience. Uh our conscience is a
[12:10] God-given gift. It's a doorway into our
[12:13] soul. But our conscience needs to be
[12:16] sanctified because the Bible says you
[12:18] can do something and do something
[12:20] against God, sin against God, fail God
[12:23] over and over again until your
[12:25] conscience becomes seared like a hot
[12:27] iron so that it no longer functions in
[12:30] the way that God intended for it to
[12:32] function. A lot of people say, "Well, I
[12:34] live by my conscience." You better live
[12:36] by the pricking of the Holy Spirit, by
[12:38] the conviction of the Holy Spirit.
[12:40] Because if you're not positive that your
[12:43] conscience is completely renewed and and
[12:46] regenerated by the spirit of God, uh
[12:50] then it could be seared. It could be
[12:52] that you have sinned against God and
[12:54] sinned against God or failed numerous
[12:56] times in an area until your conscience
[12:59] has caused your soul to become numb. And
[13:03] so you continue to do it and no longer
[13:05] feel guilty. I'll give you a good
[13:07] example. People are all all the time
[13:09] watching Hollywood movies. And uh I
[13:12] think you should be careful with that. I
[13:15] do. I'm not against movies. I'm not
[13:17] against uh uh family entertainment. I'm
[13:20] not against that at all. But I'll tell
[13:22] you what happens when you start watching
[13:23] a lot of movies. The first time you hear
[13:26] a curse word, a swear word, you
[13:29] flinch. if that's not a part of who you
[13:31] are and I want you to know that's not a
[13:33] part of who I am. I don't use that kind
[13:35] of language. And I don't like to hear
[13:37] that kind of language. And but sometimes
[13:40] if you've really got something
[13:42] interesting you want to see, you you
[13:44] really believe there's a storyline and
[13:46] they've thrown that stuff in because
[13:48] that's the way Hollywood does. You press
[13:50] through and every time you hear an ugly
[13:52] word, oh, it gets you. You feel it. It
[13:55] affects you. But if you keep doing it,
[13:58] if you if you don't filter that out, and
[14:01] there are tools and ways of filtering
[14:03] that out, or if you don't become more
[14:05] selective in what you watch and what you
[14:08] feed your soul on, then I guarantee you
[14:12] there will come a time that you will
[14:14] hear those words and feel nothing. You
[14:18] will feel nothing. And not only will you
[14:20] not feel uh some conviction or some uh
[14:23] you know tensing up when you hear
[14:24] language uh even using God's name in
[14:27] vain that disturbs you now. But if you
[14:30] continue to feed on that kind of
[14:32] language uh watch those movies where
[14:35] God's name is profained over and over
[14:38] again. There will come a time I want to
[14:40] say again I guarantee you there will
[14:42] come a time that you will hear that and
[14:44] not be convicted not feel anything at
[14:48] all. In fact, you will justify it.
[14:50] You'll come to a place where you say,
[14:51] "Well, that's not how I talk and it's a
[14:54] very good movie and so forth." So, I'm
[14:56] telling you, our conscience needs to be
[14:58] sanctified. It needs to be touched by
[15:01] the spirit of God and it can't be
[15:03] totally trusted because it can be seared
[15:06] with a hot iron. So, you've got
[15:07] memories, you've got imagination, you've
[15:10] got conscience. That's for the C. A is
[15:13] affections. The Bible tells us where we
[15:16] need to set our affection. We need to
[15:17] set our affection on things above. I do
[15:20] not believe that that uh our uh well,
[15:24] you know, I don't know how to say this
[15:25] so that it comes across in in the right
[15:27] balance. Sometimes people say, well, he
[15:29] or she is so heavenly minded, they're no
[15:32] earthly good. Well, I believe that's
[15:34] exactly where we're going in the spirit
[15:36] realm. I believe God wants us to become
[15:39] very, very heavenly minded. I believe
[15:42] God wants us to walk in the spirit, live
[15:45] in the spirit and function in the
[15:47] spirit. But until we sanctify ourselves
[15:51] even in the realm of the flesh and in
[15:53] the realm of the soul, we are not coming
[15:55] yet to that place where we can truly
[15:57] live out of the spirit. So what people
[15:59] usually mean by that is someone has
[16:02] become so religious. That's usually you
[16:04] call it heavenly-minded, but what it
[16:07] often means is someone has become quite
[16:09] religious and they're not they're not
[16:12] functioning the way they should. Uh
[16:14] people set their affection on all kinds
[16:17] of things. Like I said a moment ago,
[16:19] entertainment uh love story books or
[16:23] magazines or whatever. And I believe
[16:25] that that moderation is necessary in all
[16:30] things. Uh I definitely believe in
[16:33] modesty. I definitely believe in
[16:36] moderation. I I believe that there are
[16:38] there should be uh a limit to how much
[16:41] time we spend in our life with
[16:44] entertainment. I believe we should try
[16:46] to limit put some kind of restriction
[16:49] because otherwise we're going to build
[16:52] up the flesh. We're going to exercise
[16:55] the flesh. We're going to exercise the
[16:58] soul and our spirit is going to shrink
[17:01] away to nearly
[17:03] nothing. We feed the flesh. We feed the
[17:07] soul. We need to start being concerned
[17:10] about nourishing the spirit man. And
[17:14] that's part of what this study is about.
[17:16] So be careful what you set your
[17:17] affections on because what you set your
[17:21] affections on feeds the soul. So, we've
[17:25] got want to get it again. We've got
[17:28] memory, we've got imagination, we've got
[17:31] conscience, we've got affections, and
[17:34] then we've got reasonings. These are the
[17:38] doorways into the soul of man.
[17:40] Reasonings. And part of that is the
[17:43] emotion also and the will uh going into
[17:46] the soul. But reasonings and and a lot
[17:50] of our reasonings come from emotion.
[17:54] And we start trying to reason things out
[17:56] in our mind. Well, such and such, but if
[17:59] I did so and so, and that couldn't
[18:00] really be sin, and well, uh, that's just
[18:03] what somebody said, and everybody else
[18:05] is doing it. And we just start reasoning
[18:07] things out. And that's okay if you're
[18:10] reasoning out your own, uh, salvation.
[18:12] The Bible does say we should work out
[18:14] our own salvation with fear and
[18:17] trembling, not with human reasoning.
[18:20] With fear and trembling. We want to work
[18:22] out our salvation by by using the
[18:26] absolute pattern for life, the word of
[18:29] God. I hope I haven't lost you. I hope
[18:32] you're still with me in this teaching.
[18:34] We've been given a road map. We've been
[18:36] given a pattern of how we should live
[18:38] our lives. And so again, I'm going to
[18:41] say these again. I I want you to get
[18:43] them. I want you to try to understand
[18:44] them. uh the enemy uh is out there and
[18:49] he wants to penetrate not just your
[18:51] flesh but also your soul. So let's just
[18:53] review a moment. How does our body
[18:56] contact or have communication with its
[19:00] earthly environment? Through the senses
[19:03] primarily five seeing, hearing,
[19:08] smelling, tasting and feeling. How does
[19:11] the soul communicate? The soul is kind
[19:14] of an interesting thing because the soul
[19:17] can communicate with both the earthly
[19:19] realm and have communication also with
[19:23] the heavenly realm. The soul is in the
[19:25] middle and it has communication with
[19:28] both realms. How does this happen? How
[19:31] what are the doorways? We could say what
[19:33] are the gateways into our soul? Well, we
[19:36] know emotion and will is a very
[19:39] important part of that. We hear that in
[19:41] teaching all the time. But I I really
[19:43] believe there is a truth here to this uh
[19:47] my car memories,
[19:50] imagination, conscience, affection and
[19:53] reasonings. These are the ways, the
[19:56] doorways, the entrances into the soul of
[19:59] man. What comes into the soul affects
[20:03] the
[20:04] spirit. It affects the spirit. So, what
[20:07] we've got is we've got this big old fat
[20:10] soul that's been fed and
[20:13] overstimulated by the surroundings of
[20:15] this life. And we've got this tiny
[20:18] little spirit man. I had a dream one
[20:20] time about a stick figure and a sumo
[20:23] wrestler. And I could not understand
[20:25] what the dream meant. And one day I
[20:27] heard some very good teaching on on the
[20:30] spirit of man, nourishing the spirit of
[20:32] man. And guess what? The example the
[20:34] teacher used was the sumo wrestler and a
[20:37] tiny little stick man. And the sumo
[20:39] wrestler represents a soul because it
[20:41] gets fed. It gets stimulated. We've got
[20:43] imagination, memories, affections,
[20:46] reasonings, all this stuff coming in all
[20:48] the time. It gets big, big, big. Uh what
[20:51] we uh receive through the five senses
[20:54] into our flesh that also feeds the soul.
[20:56] So you've got all this seeing and
[20:58] hearing and and the bad reports and
[21:00] seeing things we shouldn't see perhaps
[21:02] and all this. So the soul's just getting
[21:04] fat fat fat and the spirit is this
[21:06] little stick man. We want to reverse the
[21:09] order. We want to exercise the senses of
[21:12] our spirit man so that the spirit man
[21:15] becomes like the big sumo wrestler and
[21:18] our soul is not listen you don't want to
[21:20] kill your soul. I hear people talking
[21:23] about I I've got to crucify my soul.
[21:26] I've got a That's your flesh. You're
[21:28] trying to The Bible talks about daily
[21:30] crucifying the flesh. Your soul is not
[21:33] your enemy. In fact, your flesh is not
[21:34] your enemy. The The devil is your enemy.
[21:37] He's the one that wants to penetrate
[21:40] your life through your flesh and through
[21:43] the realm of your soul. You don't want
[21:45] to kill your soul. Your soul is not your
[21:47] enemy. You want it to be sanctified. You
[21:51] want it to be set apart. How does that
[21:53] happen? Well, by reading God's word, by
[21:57] understanding the truth of God's word,
[22:00] by worshiping in the realm of the
[22:03] spirit, by soaking in the presence of
[22:06] God, by filling your soul with the good
[22:10] things of the Lord, by keeping good
[22:13] company, by keeping good company, by
[22:16] reordering your affections. What are you
[22:19] setting your affections on? By
[22:21] sanctifying your imagination. all of
[22:23] these things, you'll bring your soul
[22:25] into its proper place. You're not to
[22:29] live your Christian life ruled by your
[22:33] soul. If you do that, your imagination
[22:36] will rule you. Your conscience will rule
[22:38] you. Your affections, your reasonings
[22:41] will rule your life. You're you are to
[22:44] live your life your spirit man, Jesus
[22:48] Christ, the the the spirit of God is to
[22:50] sit on the throne of your spirit and
[22:53] rule out from the inside of the inside
[22:56] out. The spirit is to have uh some
[23:00] dominion, some leadership over the soul
[23:03] and over the flesh. Now, I've just said
[23:05] a mouthful. I hope that you can think
[23:08] about it. Uh I hope you can digest it.
[23:11] Perhaps you would even want to uh order
[23:14] this series. We're not here trying to
[23:16] sell you something, but you might want
[23:18] to order this series. You might want to
[23:20] go back and see it again. We perhaps can
[23:22] make it available in audio as well. You
[23:25] might want to go back and follow this
[23:26] thing through because I really believe
[23:29] that there are some keys in this uh
[23:32] body, soul, spirit teaching, how to
[23:36] exercise the senses of the spirit. I
[23:38] believe there's some keys in this that
[23:40] God wants to use to unlock some realms
[23:43] of the spirit so that you and I will
[23:45] begin to live like he wants us to live.
[23:47] Not just back to the book of Acts, as we
[23:50] started to say a moment ago. God wants
[23:52] us to go all the way back to the Garden
[23:53] of Eden. Hallelujah. He wants us to have
[23:56] that place of communion and fellowship
[23:58] with God that Adam had in the cool of
[24:01] the day. Again, a pop quiz here. How did
[24:04] Adam communicate with his creator? How?
[24:07] through his flesh, through his only his
[24:10] soul. No, spirit to spirit, deep to
[24:14] deep, spirit to spirit. This is how the
[24:16] communication was. Are Christians
[24:19] communicating with God spirit to spirit
[24:20] today? Yes, he's opening up that realm.
[24:24] He's opening up that realm. There's good
[24:26] teaching. There's anointed impartation
[24:28] that's taking place. And God is opening
[24:30] up that realm. But we're not there yet
[24:33] where we want to be. We're not into that
[24:35] place of full oneness and intimacy a and
[24:39] uh relationship. We're we're going
[24:42] there. We're headed there. We're moving
[24:44] in the right direction. The door is open
[24:46] and it is going on, but not to the
[24:49] degree that I believe God wants it to uh
[24:52] to be, but we're headed in that
[24:54] direction. So you can start praying in
[24:56] your own life that God will help you to
[24:59] live your life not governed by your
[25:02] flesh, not even governed by your soul,
[25:05] but governed by your spirit and not your
[25:09] human spirit, but your human spirit that
[25:12] has been regenerated and surrendered to
[25:15] the Lord Jesus Christ and he's sitting
[25:17] on the throne and he's ruling. I tell
[25:19] you that is good. It's good and it works
[25:23] and I want it. I don't want just a piece
[25:26] of it. I want the fullness of it. And so
[25:29] where are we? There's a lot here. We're
[25:32] growing now uh by the born again
[25:35] experience. Our human spirit that was
[25:38] lost because of the fall in the Garden
[25:40] of Eden. It has been regenerated and
[25:42] renewed. It has been restored. But it
[25:45] must be developed. Our human spirit must
[25:48] be developed. It must be exercised. It
[25:53] must be the sumo wrestler and the soul
[25:56] must shrink into its proper place. Now
[26:00] this happens again. I think I've said
[26:02] already how it happens. How do we get in
[26:04] proper alignment? How do we come into
[26:06] divine alignment? We do that by feeding
[26:10] on God's word. By worshiping him in
[26:13] spirit and in truth. You don't have to
[26:15] be in church to worship. Worship is a
[26:17] lifestyle. Worship is a lifestyle we
[26:21] could live. We must live a life of
[26:24] worship. That which brings glory and
[26:27] honor to God. Soaking in his presence,
[26:30] filling our lives with good sound Bible
[26:34] teaching with revelation. Not just
[26:36] knowledge, with revelation. Get under a
[26:40] teacher. Get into a ministry. Get some
[26:43] resources of men and women that have
[26:46] been with God. been with God, been in in
[26:51] the presence of the Lord, uh called into
[26:54] the throne room, have had heavenly
[26:57] experiences that are biblically sound.
[27:00] Now, just remember that any uh heavenly
[27:03] experience, vision, dream, gift with say
[27:07] for instance, tongues, message of
[27:09] tongues, prophecy, interpretation. I
[27:11] believe that all of those things must be
[27:14] grounded in God's word. grounded in
[27:18] God's word. And I believe we can do that
[27:20] if it's truly from God. I believe we can
[27:23] ground the experience in the word. So
[27:25] our spirit, let's go back. Our spirit
[27:27] has been renewed. It has been restored.
[27:30] It has been regenerated because of the
[27:32] price that Jesus paid on Calvary. So
[27:35] we're part of the way back already. When
[27:37] we become born again, we're part of the
[27:40] way back to the relationship that Adam
[27:43] had with his creator in the beginning.
[27:46] We're part of the way back. Potentially,
[27:48] we're there. But there is some
[27:50] development that must take place. There
[27:53] is something that must be developed,
[27:55] exercised, strengthened. We've got to
[27:57] get used to. Listen, we've lived our
[28:01] lives in the realm of the flesh and in
[28:03] the realm of the soul for so long that
[28:06] we don't know how to live with our
[28:08] spirit at the steering wheel. Again, not
[28:11] our just our human spirit, but the Holy
[28:14] Spirit that has taken over leadership of
[28:17] our spirit. We've surrendered. We've
[28:18] become one with him. That's what we're
[28:20] after. We don't even know how really to
[28:22] live that kind of a life, but we're
[28:24] going to be taught and it's going to be
[28:26] supernatural. And that's beginning right
[28:28] now. We're growing in spiritual
[28:30] maturity. Now, the next time we meet
[28:32] together, I'm going to give you
[28:33] scriptures because there's there is
[28:35] undoubtedly going to be somebody who
[28:37] says, "Well, I don't I don't believe you
[28:39] have to grow into that. I don't believe
[28:40] you're developed in that. When you get
[28:41] saved, you get it all. Well, that would
[28:44] be good. That would be wonderful. You're
[28:47] right, though. The price that Christ
[28:49] paid, the price that Jesus paid at
[28:52] Calvary has potentially made everything
[28:54] we need available to us. Absolutely, you
[28:57] are right. But we don't get it all, so
[29:00] to speak, just because we we uh repeat
[29:04] the sinner's prayer and join the church
[29:06] and and start our Christian journey.
[29:09] This is a journey of development.
[29:12] Revelation is progressive. We grow in
[29:15] grace. We grow in truth. We grow in
[29:19] strength. We grow in glory. That's why
[29:21] the Bible said from glory to glory.
[29:23] Another place from strength to strength.
[29:25] Another place from faith to faith. We're
[29:28] growing. We're developing. And I'm going
[29:30] to give you some scriptures the next
[29:31] time we meet together about this
[29:34] progress. How we progress. How we
[29:38] develop. how we move to that place where
[29:40] we are in oneness with the Lord, divine
[29:44] alignment. His spirit has uh taken uh
[29:48] complete charge of our lives and we just
[29:51] live out from the realm of the spirit.
[29:53] Oh, I'm looking forward to that. I'm
[29:55] after that. I'm chasing that. Let's pray
[29:57] right now. Father, I thank you for every
[30:00] listener, for every viewer. I pray right
[30:03] now that you will let revelation
[30:04] knowledge flow. That you will speak to
[30:07] hearts and lives. That you will let
[30:10] these truths drop from our head to our
[30:14] heart. That you will let us walk them
[30:16] out. Father, I pray for the sick right
[30:18] now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[30:20] Christ. Yeshua, I release healing to
[30:23] whatever the sickness, whatever the
[30:25] infirmity is. Yes, Lord. I believe you
[30:28] are still a healer today. And I ask you
[30:31] to manifest your healing touch. I feel
[30:33] that. I feel that right now that you're
[30:36] getting a hold of this. You're going to
[30:38] let your faith reach out and touch the
[30:40] Lord. Somebody is receiving some healing
[30:43] into their body. Even perhaps a miracle.
[30:46] If you need a miracle, he is a miracle
[30:48] worker. Father, I just thank you for
[30:49] doing that right now. In the wonderful
[30:51] name of Yeshua, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[30:54] we pray. Amen. Well, I'm talking fast.
[30:56] 90 miles a minute. So that lets you know
[30:59] I'm feeling the anointing of the Lord.
[31:01] I'm excited about what God's saying to
[31:03] us. I'm excited about you and your
[31:06] desire to understand to unlock these
[31:10] scriptural and spiritual truths. And I
[31:12] bless you on your journey. I bless your
[31:15] spirit and I pray that it will come to
[31:19] the place of development and fullness
[31:22] and completeness in the Lord Jesus
[31:24] Christ. God richly bless you. Thank you
[31:27] for watching The Eagles Cry and please
[31:29] tune in again next time. Bye-bye for
[31:31] now.
