TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you you you hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly from the New Hope revival ministries in Smith station Alabama in the USA and I want to welcome you today to the Eagles cry broadcast it's such a wonderful privilege to be able to come to you in your home wherever you may be across the world we want to thank the Lord for the fine television Christian television networks that God is using in a mighty way to bring the gospel to the nations of the world and we feel so honored and so privileged to be able to come to you today through the gospel channel and through angel TV and we just asked that the Lord Jesus will come and anoint his word today and touch you and strengthen you and encourage you in your life most of all if you don't know the lord I pray that this broadcast will be mightily used of God to stir your heart to cause you to hunger after the things of God I think it's very important for us to begin to realize and recognize the hour in which we live I believe with every fiber of my being that we are living in the last generation I truly believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will soon catch his waiting bride away and then the world is going to be plunged into a time of great wrath such as has never been seen before in the history of humanity and there's going to be a wonderful marriage supper of the Lamb with the bridegroom Yeshua our Lord Jesus Christ and his bride in the realms of heaven and the earth is going to be purged in the time of the great wrath and when it's all done our precious Lord is coming back to this earth with his bride with the Saints of every age to establish his Millennial Kingdom right here on planet earth we talk about the desire for peace we want peace in the world not just peace in the Middle East but we desire peace and ever nation of the world will let me say to you that peace as we desire it will never be known in the world until the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the son of David comes back and establishes his kingdom here on the earth then there's going to be a thousand years of perfect peace we need to know in this hour that we have invited the Lord Jesus into our lives that our sins have been covered by the precious blood that He shed on our behalf to become our propitiation for sin he became the sacrifice he settled the debt sometimes we use the word justified to to describe our experience or our condition when we come to the Lord we are justified and I like to say that means just if I'd never sinned that's how powerful the blood of Jesus is he can not only take his blood and apply it to our lives and cover our sin but our sins are remitted and in the sight of God it is as though we have never sinned if you knew that you could have every mistake and every sin that you have ever committed in your life instantaneously wiped away never to be remembered anymore then what would prevent you from finding that remedy what would prevent you from desiring that condition I can't imagine anything being more important than knowing that your sin has been forgiven and all you have to do is invite the Lord Jesus Christ into your life repent of your sins and say Lord I'm sorry that I have transgressed your word but I thank you that you have paid the price you have settled the dead of sin forever more and I invite you to come with your precious blood and wash me mean though my sins were as scarlet now they shall be white as snow that's the promise of the scripture and all you have to do is invite him to come in and transform your life and then as you are transformed we continue to grow in the things of the word and in the things of the Spirit and that's what the Eagles cry broadcast is all about yes we're going to talk about salvation we're going to talk about what it means to be sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and we're going to talk about what it means to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire but we're not only going to talk about the foundational truths of the scripture but by the grace of God and by the revelation of the Holy Spirit it is my desire to take you on a journey through the deeper truths and spiritual revelations of God's Word that are applicable for the hour in which we live I believe that God has sent forth a message of transforming truth to prepare a body of people to go forth in a final move of the Holy Spirit that we often refer to as the bride's revival where they will go forth in the very character and attributes of the Lord Jesus Christ performing the same works in the end time that he performed while he was living in his corporal body here on planet Earth I believe it's going to be a quick short work that will cause a final avalanche of souls a harvest of souls to be swept into the kingdom of God and you and I are being positioned to be used of God in unprecedented ways here in the end time and I believe that this message of truth that the Lord has sent to Planet Earth to help prepare a bride of Christ for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that message is what we desperately need in this hour to deliver us from complacent church anity into a real intimate relationship with our heavenly bridegroom you see there is an earthly bride that's being called out in this hour she's being called out of denominational creeds and ideas of man that are so far removed from the truth of the scripture that we can't even find a hint or a trace of some of the ideas that have been taught in this past generation concerning Christianity that that are really more akin to paganism than they have anything to do with the gospel of Jesus Christ there is an hour this is the hour that we're living in right now where the Bride of Christ is being identified there is a word from heaven that's being sent around the world in this hour and when you hear that word if you are called and elected to be part of that Brides revival there's something on the inside of you that is quickened by that living revelation of Jesus Christ that living word it it becomes alive and then you begin to feel that wooing and that pulling and that drawing of the Holy Spirit perhaps we could use the analogy of a magnet you you as a child i'm sure you played like i did with two magnets and and you found out that if you turn them a certain way they pull one another they draw one another together if you flip one of those magnets over and then you would instead of being pulled together the two magnets would be pushed apart they would be repelled and so I believe there's a draw that's going forth in the spirit the Bible calls it the deep calling to the deep at the noise of thy waterspouts the deep is calling to the deep and I believe that's where we are right now the deeper truths of God's Word are being made known on planet earth in this hour and when we hear them if we have been called to be a part of that remnant bride something just draws us like the magnet it pulls us to hear more of that truth you know what I find out as God began to reveal some of these truths to us over the past 20 years plus I found out that there were times that I would hear something and my spirit would grab it before my mind was even able to understand it or comprehended what do you mean by that preacher I mean that internal witness of the Holy Spirit that inner a man not the one that comes out of your lips vocally but the one that's on the inside that that spirit man your spirit man my spirit man responding to the word of truth and something inside just quickens it comes alive somebody said well you're talking awful lot about feeling and emotion is that really how revelation works well remember what the scripture says we know that we are saved by the quickening of our spirit by the coming alive by the resurrecting of our spirit man and so sometimes the spirit man in fact most of the time the spirit man is quicker to grab ahold of a revelation truth before our soul and and the rest of us a rest of our our being our triune being here body soul and spirit our spirit grabs it before the rest of our body is able to filter it and even comprehend it and by all means explain it in other words i received revelation from god's word that I knew was right before I was ever able to articulate it before I was ever able to share it with someone else I just knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that God was making himself real to me in his word I want you to know right now wherever you're watching the Eagles cry that God wants you to have a deeper understanding of his word because when we receive a deeper understanding of his word we we actually began to understand him more and in understanding our Creator more we began to love him more and the more we love him the more we are drawn into a place of intimate fellowship and communion with him it is ultimately the desire of God think about this it is ultimately the desire of eternal God the creator of heaven and earth to have fellowship with me to have communion with me and to have fellowship and communion with you that's how much he loves us now what happens so many times after we're converted after we receive the Lord into our lives we get on that hamster wheel of Christianity of church anity we're going through all of the religious motions and the religious trappings and religious vocabulary but our our relationship is so small it doesn't grow in other words we we become more religious but our lives are not being transformed by the living reality of the word so I'm going to ask the Lord to use the Eagles cry we're sort of relaunching this part of our ministry although we have been on the television now for a number of years consistently weekly but we have a new burden and a fresh auction from the Holy Spirit to just get on here and I want to share my heart I want to tell you about my own experiences with the Lord and where I've come from and a little bit of my story and I want to hopefully inspire you to be able to reach up and pull up into the presence of God and receive a closer relationship with him in this hour and we're going to begin our study today about the end times we're going to talk about some of the things that are going on in the world around us and how they are pointing us to the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ now I need to say a ride up front that I do believe in the resurrection rapture of the Bride of Christ and in in one of our studies together we will talk about the threefold expression of the coming of the Lord will talk about this resurrection rapture mystery but I do not believe that that the Bride of Christ is going to be caught out of the earth before some pretty serious things begin to transpire on on on this planet in other words this this whole idea of escaping before there's any trouble on the earth I just want to say i don't see that completely in the scripture i actually believe that the bride is going to be very needed and necessary here on the earth during the beginnings of some of those tragic events that are going to be unfolding some of which are already happening even now around the world the bride's presence here in the earth and our ministry is going to be necessary but there is coming an hour where he is going to come and receive his bride out of this earth into the realms of eternity and then the earth is going to go through a great time three and a half years of great wrath such as the world has never seen before and during that time we're going to see the the remaining scriptures that have not yet been fulfilled about the end time they're going to become reality and we're going to talk about that in a future program but I just wanted to give you a little a little taste right from the beginning I want you to know that i do see in the scripture a rapture resurrection for the Bride of Christ I must say from the beginning that I clearly see in the scripture also a differentiation between the church and the bride I truly believe that there is a church that Jesus gave his life for and loves that church supremely I believe that is clearly outlined in the scripture not only in Ephesians but in many other places but I also believe that there will be an overcoming company for instance when when the Lord Jesus was speaking to John on the Isle of Patmos in the book of Revelation and he was speaking to him giving him instructions to the seven churches of Asia Minor which also speak to us of seven church age periods in history not just seven literal churches that was definitely true but it also we can take those seven churches their attributes their strengths and their weaknesses and we can lay them out over 2,000 years of church history and when Jesus was delivering this message to john he would say to the Church of Ephesus write these things to the Church of Smyrna write these things and he would go all the way through the list but he would also say and to him that overcometh right and so I believe that it is clear indication that every church member is not going to overcome in the end time I believe there's an invitation going forth in this hour to come up revelation for talks about that open door that's inviting us to come up into higher realms of glory and when we step into that realm we begin to see things as John saw them from Heaven's perspective I'm telling you if you are only looking at things from Earth's perspective you're going to get pretty discouraged in fact you're going to feel like giving up I know that even in my own life when I when I start looking at my circumstances looking at the darkness that's around me I could really have a tendency to be depressed and when I find myself getting in that place I just remember that the the invitation in Revelation chapter 4 was not just for John i believe it was also for the overcoming bride in the end time an invitation to come up higher because I want to show you some things so I I remind the Lord Lord you invited John I'd like to have that invitation I'd like to respond help me to come up and one of the ways that we go up in the realm of the Spirit is by worshipping Him I mean you don't even have to be a singer to sing worship you can let your heart you don't even have to know the words of a him or a good worship chorus to be able to worship you can just turn your heart loose just loose your tongue and open your mouth and just start singing your praise to God and if you if you run out of vocabulary I've been telling people for for nearly 30 years to to go and read the book of psalms out loud to the Lord because there's one thing for sure David had a beautiful worship vocabulary he he is our example in worship it through the scripture and i just read some time the beautiful words of David and I read them from my heart to the Lord and i feel myself being lifted up and when you get lifted up in the spirit the atmosphere begins to change around you and it's not so much that your circumstances and problems automatically change but you begin to be elevated and now instead of looking parallel at your situation you're now looking down on it because you've been caught up in the realm of praise caught up into the spirit and you're looking down on your problem and you know what it doesn't look as dark as it did when you were looking head on it doesn't seem to have the same depressing discouraging effect that it had before so I guess the best advice I could give you today is get in the spirit in fact that's how the book of the revelation started John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day so let me encourage you to worship your way into the realm of the Spirit so that your soulish senses are silenced and so that you begin to move out of your spirit man instead out of instead of out of that soulish realm or that fleshly realm we can we can explain that a little more in another study but get into that place of spirit so that you can begin to look down on on your circumstances and the things that are going on around you in the world from from the Lord's point of view from Heaven's vantage point and I promise you that the things that look like mountains when you were looking at them through the flesh or the soul will look like little mole hills or ant hills when you're looking at them from the realm of the Spirit there's not a problem that you could be going through right now too big for God to solve them so what we need in this hour is a clear word from God a clear word we need a pure revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ with all of man's ideas and and traditional interpretations that are not rooted in the scripture we need all that plucked out of the way and we need the Holy Ghost to come and anoint our eyes with eye salve so that we can see the truth of the scripture so that we can hear the pure voice of God let me give you a verse of scripture I got a little carried away in my introduction and my time is nearly gone but let me share first Corinthians chapter 14 verses 7 and 8 with you today it says and even things without life-giving sound whether pipe or harp and of course you know that's musical instruments except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped if any of you are familiar with with music for instance the brass instruments or the woodwind instruments you're probably able to distinguish by the sound what the instrument is that's being played sometimes I find it kind of fun to be listening to a piece of music and start identifying the various instruments that are making up the symphony how can you do that because musical instruments have a distinct sound and you're able to identify what the instrument is and what the piece of music is by identifying the distinct sound that the musical instrument is making verse 8 1st Corinthians 14 says for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle and that's what we're dealing with in this hour we need a certain sound from heaven we need a prophetic voice we need prophetic voices to be raised up all over the world that will not be speaking or prophesying or teaching according to their own opinion or what their perception is rather they would be speaking what heavens perception and perspective is i'll just sum it up for you we need thus saith the lord we need the nine gifts of the spirit we need the the offices that are listed for us in the book of Ephesians we need those ministry offices we need the service gifts of Romans chapter 12 we need the fresh breath of God to breathe over the places where people are gathered in the Lord's name all over the earth we need a revival we need God to come and and wake us up and break us out of our lethargy are our complacency our laziness and we need to be awakened to the urgency of the hour we need a trumpet blast we need to hear the shofar of God calling us to action and that shofar that trumpet needs to give such a distinct word and a distinguishable sound that the people of God are not in confusion but so that they are able to know the perfect mind and will of God for their lives and for the time in which we live so we're going to hopefully be a part of that trumpet I asked the Lord the often Lord let my voice be a trumpet that will not trumpet my ideas or blast out my own opinions but let me be led by the revelation of the Holy Spirit and let me give that to the eager bride around the world I believe that many of you are being called to hear some of the amazing programming that's available on these fine Christian networks I have to say that everything you hear may not be the one-hundred-percent truth of Scripture you're going to need the Holy Spirit to be able to help you in your life because the scripture said when he the Holy Spirit has come he will lead us and guide us into all truth I want to pray for you right now father I asked you to release the power of the Holy Spirit to anoint every person watching this broadcast anoint their eyes to see and their ears to hear thus sayeth the Lord in this our Father direct them to a distinct trumpet blast 2 thus saith the Lord to a true word from God and give us more revelation of your Holy Word in this hour for the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy heal the sick let the healing virtue flow right now in the mighty name of Yeshua our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ I want to thank you for watching the Eagles cry broadcast this week contact us the information is given to you on the screen Lord bless you bye bye until next time you you
