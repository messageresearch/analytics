[0:00] the Supernatural is
[0:01] real I'm telling you it's real demons
[0:05] are real but so are
[0:07] angels so don't spend all your time
[0:09] focusing on demons spend a little of
[0:12] that time focusing on the other host
[0:14] they're more for us there's more forces
[0:18] fighting for you than there are against
[0:20] you somebody said well there're 10,000
[0:23] times 10,000 demon spirit all right
[0:25] there's hundreds of thousands times
[0:27] hundreds of thousands Heavenly hes
[0:30] that are fighting for you if our
[0:34] spiritual eyes could be open we would
[0:36] see the room even now filled with
[0:39] creatures created to assist the body of
[0:42] Christ in this hour they don't all look
[0:46] the same they don't all function the
[0:48] same but God gives them to us when we
[0:52] need them and you know when I need them
[0:55] all the time I don't ever dismiss my
[0:59] angels I don't ever send them home for
[1:02] Furlow I don't ever tell them they can
[1:05] have a break I need them with me 24
[1:08] hours a day they take a lot of blows
[1:12] that I don't even know are headed in my
[1:14] direction they stop a lot of things that
[1:16] I don't even know are going around in
[1:18] the realm of the spirit I'm thankful for
[1:21] the heavenly host for every demon God's
[1:24] got a dozen Angels or more who know how
[1:27] to deal with that imp and they are sent
[1:32] to cooperate with us they are here to
[1:36] serve us they are here to minister to us
[1:41] they are here to help us do what God has
[1:44] called us to do we don't pray to angels
[1:47] and we don't command Angels the Lord is
[1:51] the commander of the Heavenly Host he
[1:54] sends the Angels it's all right to say
[1:57] father would you send your angels into
[2:00] such of a situation you're asking you're
[2:03] petitioning you're requesting I don't
[2:05] believe it's our job to tell what Angel
[2:07] to go where and to do what and so forth
[2:10] God is a big God but I want you to be
[2:12] aware of the fact that every time you
[2:15] are aware that something is fighting
[2:18] against you you ought to immediately
[2:20] remember that with every attack against
[2:23] you there is a Heavenly Host raised up
[2:27] to meet that challenge stay out of their
[2:35] way
