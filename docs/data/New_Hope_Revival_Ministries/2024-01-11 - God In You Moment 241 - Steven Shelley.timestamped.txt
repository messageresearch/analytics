[0:00] but nothing could be more important than
[0:04] understanding that this
[0:06] bride it's not just enough to believe a
[0:09] prophet or to believe that you have
[0:12] received a message of Truth there is
[0:15] something much more than that that must
[0:19] take place and that is we have to
[0:22] discover who we are first of all he said
[0:26] what we
[0:28] are you you got to know what you are and
[0:32] you're going to come to
[0:33] know who you
[0:35] are and when you do that you will you'll
[0:39] walk away with the
[0:41] reality not only of who God
[0:44] is but who God is in
[0:48] you that's powerful we we learn who God
[0:52] is but but who is God in you and what
[0:56] does that make you because God is in you
[0:59] am the prophet tells us from the word
[1:03] that
[1:05] Jesus the son our
[1:08] bridegroom he is the express image the
[1:12] Bible tells us he is the express image

[1:47] mean I know everything I'm going to know
[1:49] about God he tells us he's going to be
[1:52] constantly unfolding himself throughout
[1:55] eternity but what it does mean is
[1:58] everything I need to know to have
[2:00] relationship with him personal intimate
[2:03] relationship with him everything I need
[2:06] to know about him to understand who and
[2:09] where what my position is as a fully
[2:12] adopted son has been revealed in the
[2:15] life and the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:18] and in the revelation of the hour that
[2:20] we're living in because this message is
[2:23] not the revelation of the
[2:26] Antichrist this is not the revelation of
[2:29] sat who Satan
[2:31] is this is not the revelation of what
[2:34] politics is going to turn into or the

[2:42] Christ and it didn't start in in the 50s
[2:46] it started at Patmos
[2:50] amen that's where the revelation of
