TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there are going to be things that happen in your life that will offend your faith [Music] for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet he's hiding in the house of someone who knew him and all of a sudden this woman is knocking on the door because her daughter was grievously vexed with an unclean spirit and she had heard that mighty things were taking place in the ministry of Jesus Christ and she said I have nothing to lose but I have everything to gain I'm going to go and trouble him she had no claim on him as the Messiah she approached him based on what she had been told about him she had no right to call him Jesus thou son of David that was a messianic term but she did all that she knew to do she had some perception that if the stories and testimonies that she had heard were true this could possibly be the Jews Messiah and when she spilled all of that out Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me verse 23 said but he answered her not a word yet can we just say he ignored her why would he do something like that he had a reason didn't he her faith was being tested he was not giving her any reason for hope she would not settle for discouraging silence she would not settle for being ignored she would not take no for an answer Jesus was the only hope that she had so what did she do she cried out again there are going to be things that happen in your life that will offend your faith and you will be faced with a decision do I give up do I say it says I thought it was I didn't think he would do any good but I did it anyway but it didn't happen or will you say Oh Lord even if you don't have I don't hear your voice even if I don't hear your answer I'm going to keep knocking on the door I'm going to keep laying my need before you because I believe that you're the only one who is able to make a difference for me he was not yet her Messiah he was not yet her Savior but he was her Lord because as soon as she got down on her face her knees before him she was acknowledging that he had power to make a difference in her life you call somebody Lord it meant I am submitted to your authority I believe that you have enough power or enough authority to change my situation so I bowed down here and called you Lord lord have mercy on me really she got rid of religious jargon that she had no understanding of and she let her heart talk lord help me she was exactly right he was her Lord he wanted to be her or them he was testing her faith to see if she could push through the rejection he's gonna get quiet now he was testing her faith to see if she could push through the rejection push through the offence push through having her feelings hurt see just how deep her faith was running what move God that day for the syrophoenician woman she said the right thing
