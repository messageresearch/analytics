that in mind think Satan just in that would be defeated in your life we talked about god changing us nature into his nature and you know nature is too thin you're nature's what describe you that's why when the world called themselves dogs I just don't like that what's up dog because I'm not a dog because a dog is one of the unclean things don't get me wrong I know y'all love your dogs but it's not a thing where you can change it doesn't matter how you dress them up it's still a dog and dogs are gonna do what they do because of its nature now if you changed the nature of that dog and to a sheep it may look like a dog but it will act like a sheep because you have changed the nature yeah some people they want to get mad at me but that's okay some be talking about my dog now I'm now speaking bad of dogs I'm just telling you you know some people got speaks for pets now some of them have snakes for pets but my point is it's just to bring you to a place where you can see that God is here to change you why call yourself a Christian if God hasn't changed you we won't change and only God can change you I can wash my face I can wash my hands but only God can wash my heart and every one of us needs our hearts washed x4 beginning at the eleventh verse glad to see everybody here this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other but there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Colossians please hallelujah I trust by God's grace that God would give us ears to hear and eyes to see some of us are moving in that direction anyway because I know that I'm feeling a poor there's something that's really happening and the bride sees it she cannot explain it but she knows that the message of the word is making a turn she knows and something is happening on the inside she said she's she sucked I feel like she's about to lose her mind because why God is tugging on her it seemed like others are not getting it and hopefully God will do something for us this morning Colossians 3:17 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him you loved the Lord one more scripture please Ephesians 1 hallelujah vegans won the seven blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ so that you'll know that span here in Alabama but I'm also sitting in heaviness hello whether you see it or not the Bible tells us that we are now sitting in heavenly places according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love Oh have you ever thought about it the Bible tells us that we have so justified as though we've never done it in the first place because the real you has always been there having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children that by Jesus Christ like your pastor was saying to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he have made us y'all here that accepted in the beloved he made us that before you were born you were accepted in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of His grace let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and Lord you have blessed us and we're thanking you for the blessing that you have already blessed us with the blessings from yesterday and the blessings for today even though Lord we haven't seen the end of the service yet but we know about your grace and your mercy you have already blessed us and we're thanking you for it we're in expectation to see what you have determined as a blessing for us today take us to a place we've never been before help us now in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated and as our pastor have said you may be a little weary forget it less press that's how God puts you in a place you always put this you see what I'm trying to say what I'm saying is when you're tired and you know you can't do anything that's when God comes on the scene so that you'll know that he is the one that's doing this and not you I'd like to entitle this message one way to true worship and I'd like to express that the one way to true worship God has provided that way it is not your way it's what God has provided and every man woman whoever you may be must worship in the way that God has provided in order to be accepted hello somebody help me here you and I must understand in order to get to heaven you got to come the way that God has provided [Music] remember there was a man a man who was invited to a wedding but he slipped in a different way and the way that God had provided was the door you must come in at the door because when you enter into the door there was a man waiting there for you to slip you on a new robe to wash you up to perfume you it didn't matter whether you were rich or poor everybody had on the same Road hallelujah and we know that role represents the Holy Spirit oh god helpless there's all in one way Kaine thought that he could worship God in his own way but the Bible tells us without the shedding of blood there is no remission so God's Way is a bloody way it's always been a mess hallelujah it's always been a mess and in order to get to heaven you've gotta come through alas did you know not that my God loves to clean up messes all the Bible says even in Genesis that it was in a mess but it wasn't always that way but something happened and it put the world in a mess but underneath the mess somebody help me here there were seas that was predestinated to come through a mess Oh somebody help me that's why you're in a mess because this is the mess age and you better understand this it's been ordained by God come on the better the manure the better the growth of the plant hallelujah and so God put us in laodicea i less come on somebody everything is a less but that's the way God likes it he's the only one that can bring something good out of something that's evil oh Jesus help me here the name of Jesus is hardly exalted but we are loud we have allowed the enemy to rush us the devil don't care if you say God because there's a plenty of gods the yah hear me you know you can go on a restaurant you somewhere you say you know God has been so good to me nobody says anything about that but when you say Jesus when you mention the name Jesus it shakes up the kingdom of Devil's hallelujah when you say thank you Jesus heads will turn y'all know what I'm saying it's something about the name of Jesus you and I must understand there's only one way and people don't understand you know when it came to Abel Abel didn't have to do nothing but present a lamb hallelujah he didn't make the lamb grow all he did was lead the lamb hallelujah and he he took this lamb and he by revelation he came to understand that the blood is the covering agent that God has provided if it was the lamb in the beginning it's going to be the lamb in the evening it'll never be how good you are it's how good he is to you Oh somebody help me here you and I must understand it is a devil that makes salvation hard God's Way is simple has always been simple somebody help me here if you follow God's Way it'll be better than following the yellow brick road man makes it complicated hallelujah that's what Cain did he wanted to make this God's Way complicated you know when you grow vegetables and all that you gotta have sprays and Oh cousin we kill us and yeah you got it you gotta tend to it but when you have a sheep all you got to do is lead the Sheep to the right place you don't have to spoon-feed him you don't have to pet him up you he follows you and any finds a green pasture and then he eats hallelujah that's how it is with God the Lord is my shepherd somebody help me here even as he Abell he leads you come on people did not have to go to school to know God I'm not against education but God is not known by education you cannot process God because God is somebody help me no doctors of Divinity degree could ever tell you about God because God is a revelation and to know who God is it must be a revelation one way to worship true worship hallelujah oh it's always been the lamb I love the lamb hallelujah it was a profound statement when John saw that lamb and John said behold the lamb is that right because the lab is the Word of God that's right in the beginning was the word is that right the Word was with God and the Word was God but we did not understand that even under the law it was the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world that produced grace and mercy to those who were under the law hallelujah they greed from the lair they are invisible hail the Lamb that had not yet been made manifest see that's why God Luther laughs he knew man was going to fall and God be the judge God knew that need to be something to protect mankind from his wrath and the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in the shadow and the type but they never understood it was more than a ritual it was the greatest event of all mankind when the lamb was slain oh I don't feel sorry for him what would my PT do for him I am so glad oh y'all looking at me like I'm crazy y'all don't understand me I needed something to protect me hallelujah you think Abel said oh you look lamb I am so sorry hallelujah Ava understood if he had not slain that lamb he would die all connections to heaven all connection to God would be lost hallelujah people say eternal life just like I was saying the other day that eight but there's a cross right in the middle of it that joined that spiritual that in the natural world together when cry stood in the midst there between heaven and earth hallelujah Oh God he was saving that was in heaven and that was just one earth I want you to think about this because I'm working with one body one body Jesus Jesus didn't have to he had only one body and the Bible said he's the head of the church but there's only one body many members but one body that's important to know one body when God anointed Abel I was there when God called Abraham I was there say brother what are you talking about I don't know all the things that my daddy did in his lifetime but whatever daddy did I was there I was in him yet not made manifest until my mother came around but I was my daddy what kind of a life he lived I was in him somebody help me here and so whatever God did God will do I in him I am in him is that right that's what that's what Jesus said he said father I would that be one even as we are one I in you you and me and I in them right we need us he is in us brother I'm not a Christian yet but he placed a seed in you right the saw Sosa's before the foundation of the world he placed himself in you in c4 that's why you feel guilty sometimes right when you was a sinner you couldn't just see it like everybody else without feeling guilty what was it that was representation that was something in you showing you that you don't belong out there you belong in Christ and you'll never be satisfied until you give your heart to Jesus louia one way to worship you know it's the truth oh I used to go up and party and drink and all those things I ain't telling you all my business but I was the kind of person that I come home and feel bad why everybody else is happy smiling I'll come back home as Oh God I don't don't let me do that no more hallelujah but I had so many Devils in me I was out there the next weekend brother some of y'all act like y'all don't know y'all been save all your life I know but we had those days y'all know to say it was important even though God did not make Adam and Eve fall it was important for God for them to follow they had to fall so that we can have the knowledge of good and evil so we could make a choice which you would like to be is that right but understand when God made the choice we made the choice honey because when he made the charge we were in him when he made the choice that's why God knows what choices you were going to make help me Lord help me Jesus one way to worship one true way because we come in in a day where everybody wanna worship God but understand those who are predestinated to worship Him in spirit and in truth will do so somebody help me here when God when Jesus came to the woman at the where she was a prostitute so because you've been bad out there because you've been a whoremonger whatever you been doesn't mean you a devil's child somebody help me because if that seed of God is in you if you got a conscious something that works with you and tries to make you derive how to look at that shows you're not from hell but from heaven something is pulling on you try to open your eyes to you somebody help me and you don't have to worry about cleaning up God will clean you up God wasn't lost use laws it was God who picked you up and justified you it's God who washes the cup hallelujah it is God who feels to come somebody help me here it's God but because of your choosing like the brother says because you make the choice garlic God follows through with your decision help me Jesus hallelujah think about it when God was with Abraham I was there I love this part when he went to Calvary I was there so don't tell me I can't do it I can't do it you can do it hallelujah you know there's one thing about the telephone system I like it because there times you can be so connected and then there's times you can be disconnected hallelujah you know that but you advertisement can you hear me now you know people look at that and we fail to see God speaking they're supposed to be a constant connection but sometime interference disconnects you or maybe you are in a place where God can't connect come on somebody none of us like to be disconnected especially on our telephone sometimes people go all out the building in the cold so they can get a connection to be disconnected and won't worry about it but when you feel disconnected you need to move from where you can be connected back with God I don't like being disconnected you know sometimes God will spank you when you do wrong sometimes he'll pull back from you that is horrible that's a horrible feeling to a real believer you search yourself God what did I do wrong did I say something wrong did I acted the wrong way whatever it is God forgive me cuz he's the only friend that'll stick closer than a brother you lose him as a friend you might as well throw your hands up come on somebody there's nobody that will treat you like Jesus he's been my mother he's been my father he's been my sister he's been my brother he's my all you know when nobody else comes around he shows up somebody help me here y'all know what I'm talking about hallelujah I think about a winner nobody understood who Jesus was but John the Baptist saw him hallelujah I'm talking about the lamb the lamb that for thousands of years or hundreds of years have been just in symbol here now the lamb being born a man in a manger hallelujah among the Sheep like the brother said he didn't he didn't go to a fancy hotel hallelujah but he was in type the Lamb of God he was a real never God so he was born in a stable whatever we call it but the point is wise men there were men who was connected connected by the stars somebody help me that's what there are people today who are connected by the Stars and they followed the star and that's what they found somebody help me you and I must understand this is a beautiful way I just love being a Christian I thought being a Christian I'm coming brother told me I can take my time and I'm taking it it's the truth I don't know how many of y'all still look at movies just act like this is a movie three hours long don't get nervous I'm talkin preach tree house but my understand then that God world is more important than anything Hollywood could ever produce now we're talking about I heard my sister talking about rainbows or the colors of him and a brother of mine who just got a liver transplant he lives over there in South Africa he had an out-of-body experience and in that out-of-body experience he saw stones that were living and there were all different colors and then he saw the high priests dressed oh my hallelujah and every time I hear people say colors colors I say the high priest is somewhere around hallelujah yeah sometimes you see lights flashing everywhere it ain't your just your eyes is something God is showing you God is in the house hallelujah think about it I'm moving slowly but one of the things I said one body because I want you to understand when you're baptized into the Holy Ghost you're baptized into the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah so you can understand and I know you do but my point is if you can be baptized in my body that means that you would be in my body not on top of it I won't be wearing your my sleeve but you will become part of me and I will become part of you right it is that Holy Spirit that translates us into the body of Christ y'all hear me so whatever Jesus is I am somebody help me remember Moses Moses come and Moses says to God in that bush who should I ask first of all he says Lord Who am I that's a good question everybody this morning or just say Who am I and if you really talking to God Who am I God will respond back to you on who you are your understanding if you want to know who you really are that's why I try to tell people nobody can tell me I'm bribed I'm not Brian scuse me I have a revelation nobody can't take that away from me you said but I've seen you do this I've seen you that doesn't make any difference what you thought you saw I'd like to say thought because God washes all my sins away at the end of the day you'll not have one ounce of evidence against me somebody why because this is not about you it's about me it Moses answer was tell them I am seeing you so Moses name changes from Moses - I am some yeah yeah they saw Moses but Moses news and no longer Moses he was just a veil it was I am it was I am said unto Pharaoh let my people call that what Moses had no power it was the power that was hallelujah and so when Moses began to speak and throw down his rod this is limited like like this that was the difference because when God says I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob hallelujah and that's just what happens to a lot of Christians we know God as the God of William Branham the god of Luther or the God of Wesley when will he become your God with will he will he become I am to you you understand me because when Moses went down hallelujah to see Pharaoh he didn't say the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob sent me he said I have changed my position now Moses somebody help me remember I said it must be the same the god of this age is the same he's going to produce the same works the same size the same wonders the same everything no matter what you look like if he's in you come on somebody hallelujah I'm just so tired of seeing people come to church brother just getting a social sip y'all know it's your truth you come to church and you just get a little sip I don't come to church to get us here I get I come to church to get drunk you can't get drunk off of I come for a whole stimulation I want so much divination to the hairs on my hair stands up hallelujah that's the problem the problem is we want to keep everything straight what do I care hallelujah when I go to dancing when I was out there in the world I used to get so a falling off the stairs huh and you mean to tell me we gonna come to church where the fresh wine like the brother said the best wine has been saved for the last the best wine has been saved for you but you'll never get it there you'll never get God coming you know I think I'll just sit in my seat I think I'll just keep my place hallelujah you got to get into the spirit hallelujah you got to get into what God wants you to get into you say what do you mean is that our word that you be hot or cold lukewarm makes God's sake to a stomach but I choose to be hot somebody choose to be on fire oh god help us here oh I am so tired of religion I don't know what to do every time I look around people try to throw throw some kind of strange stuff on you huh it's almost like what Saudi tried to put David on this His garment his arm I don't need that I don't need the intellectual interpretation of this message I just need him somebody help me look like much stone one but my one stone is able to slay educate somebody help me here see that's the way God don't need a majority to serve Him God just need one run an invasion and we need to be determined God I'm not gonna let you down that's the way I feel I'm not gonna let call me crazy call me what you wanna call me where God has brought me from you guys have no idea hallelujah how could I turn my back on the God who brought me up out of the muck somebody help me here hallelujah chipton to commit suicide twice and God did not allow it to happen I tried it by peels and he didn't happen I tried it with the gun and it didn't happen Oh going to God [Applause] the gun would go off the gun would go higher negative GenCon wouldn't go off then I got mad with God because the gun wouldn't go off people don't understand that devil comes to steal kill and destroy and whatever he can do to take you out he'll do it but thank Peter God he can't move you until God says so he can't God will not allow a true saint of God to die without the purpose being fulfilled oh Jesus st. John 17 says 2023 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one oh come on somebody is so important for the members of this church to stay in unity y'all hear me hallelujah you will disagree with your past said time but that's not enough to break away pricing and we're gonna make mistakes somebody help me here but let me tell you I have eight kids eight children and I love them unconditionally hallelujah ain't nobody gonna separate me from my children why because they're mine and that's how God feels about you let's just stopping right me from the love of God who who can separate us I don't worry Oh Lord yeah I hope I make the rapture hope I don't hope I've been chosen for the rapture hallelujah when that cancer struck my body hallelujah I said Lord you know I'm not afraid of death I don't care about dying cuz I know where I'm going I got my ticket I said lord I don't care I said but I said no but you know I really want to see the translation I want to be a part of that I said but I'm if I'm not ordained to take the right translation while I'm living just take me now cuz I just don't want to live to go to Burger King ain't nothing happening in my life I can't ha hey you know me I like chick-fil-a but I don't want to live just to chill a meaning call me what they want to call me when I was a sinner they called me a lot of names anyway so what's the difference if I'm gonna be called names I want something that's gonna be positive [Music] yeah hallelujah we see the devil make this thing look so carnal like you know always we get to heaven and it's gonna be just you know got got to be more to just eating drinking milk and eating honey it's got to be more than just sitting at the Welcome Table you know me helping it's more than you wearing golden slippers it's another world they travel by thought what are you saying just like those UFOs they see it they think it's aliens oh come on yeah yeah y'all the ones that's aliens y'all come from another world the truth is the truth this is not my home I have no continuing City here it will always be hallelujah people don't understand in the mind of God we existed we don't know what form shaping all that the thought the attributes but God is perfect you understand me God in his mind nothing evolves it is hallelujah y'all understand me so God saw us perfect Lee he saw every trial that you and I would go through he ordained it when said when when Adam and Eve fail do you think I said oops no he understood he knew he had already provided provided cuz he knew what Adam he was going to do and when they fail what happens the Bible said the voice of God that's what I love it the voice of God it wasn't abortion it was a man is that right oh that's what God said to Isaiah cloud and spare not Isaiah became the voice of God Noah became the voice of God somebody help me here you have become the voice of God I'm preaching the Eagles tonight that's what I'm working with [Music] [Applause] people you you and I we so blessed we don't know how blessed we are I think God keeps it from us to keep it from being lifted up prideful is that right that's what Paul said Paul was a gifted man impulses you know what God allowed my flesh to be buffeted so that I wouldn't get lifted up in my revelation hallelujah let me tell you sisters and brothers every time you get lifted up because you think you're a better Christian than somebody else God got a fall for you ooh God don't like that hallelujah you love the Lord we know for a fact that the Indians in America would have never fallen [Music] to the Europeans had they not been divided come on somebody if they had unified they would have sent everybody back home come on somebody and the real American today would have been the Indians somebody help me here you see the same tactic the Indians is that right but they separated themselves the tribes fought each other hallelujah that happened in Africa too you know and it's happening today you said what do you mean our country has never been so divided and divided is that right together we stand and divided we fall and what are you saying brothers I'm telling you if you don't come soon this church is up I mean this this this America is up for the biggest fall ever and what are you gonna do when it falls what are you gonna do when it falls see you and I must understand though the world is falling apart the bride is u9t she beginning to see who she is come on listen sometimes you need all this nasty stuff to going around you so that you can identify who you remember the woman hurry up remember the woman who Jesus met at the well I love that story because the Bible said he had need to go by some area that means the woman at the world had a need for God to come by somebody help you understand me there was a deep call to the deep whenever you have a need God has a need let me tell everybody here that's older than me and you sick and afflicted and everything else don't ever let the devil make you think your age is the reason why you shouldn't be healed age ain't got nothing do with it Abraham was about a hundred years old and God made the transformation straight I've got a right to ask God that help me walk straight don't let the devil make us well I'm just I'm sorry soon it's gonna have to be now it does not have to be that's gotten pudding no no no stipulations whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it it is yours I've seen twice I've seen the dead raised twice I've seen the eyes of the blind open hello I've seen miracles we had a brother in our church who had a cancerous brain tumor and he still is alive and the tumor and the cancer is gone he's serving this message serving the word serving God under this word y'all hear me why I don't have a gift of healing but I'll have faith in healing I believe God says it and that's all that matters and if he said it he's able to perform it oh come on somebody you say I'm telling you this listen when Joshua said to the son son Stansfield I was there I know you don't understand what I'm saying some of you doing some of you don't but that you gotta understand no man in reality no human flesh can cause the son to stand still that was God in Joshua and that's a that was in Joshua is it me what are you saying brother I'm telling you this whole Bible one time I was in my kitchen I might have said this already I was in my kitchen and God says you are this you are the Bible what he said yeah you are the Bible understand he said I told you to eat the whole book sometimes we think we gotta read all of this for the whole Bible to be in you you get Christ you got the whole Bible I like it like this brother this is my recipe book when I need something I go to this book and said how was it done then hallelujah I follow the instructions and I get the writings results oh come on somebody hallelujah I'm not afraid of the feeling star Goliath years ago because when David killed Goliath I was there somebody help me here see sometimes you got to stop just reading the book and you got to step into it you must become the character of the book come on somebody hallelujah to the mouth Shamgar yesterday sham god heard those and that's what the devil does he frightens you by his thunder but I got a everything that the Angels did throughout the church ages I've got that strength in me hallelujah call them blue red green whatever they'll come on somebody y'all understand me you share what do you mean brother Brooks let me say it like this there was a man by the name of Joseph his daddy favored him people said we ought not to favor certain children when some time I can't help it it's just nature it's really what it is God favors you you don't have a problem with that do you right oh it's the truth it's a chemical it's a natural thing it's something you know maybe it's just compatibility some your children you're not compatible with see y'all haven't had enough y'all need to go back and have a few more but I've got AIDS I've got eight children I'm gonna tell you all of them are not so compatible Yanis tell me they're different in their ways their way of thinking hallelujah but then you have one or two they call them daddies children or Mama's children right it was a long time before I realized some of my children really loved me the average Cameron you look around there was mama mama mama mama and that's just the way it goes hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying but Joseph was given a coat a multi-coloured coat so whenever Joseph would wear this coat his brothers knew he was not coming to work his work days were over it's the truth when God gives you the coat your work day is over but people get mad at a real Christian because they don't get upset like they do they've got virtues that they don't have and Joseph's thought was to be faithful to his father when his brothers were not faithful but to the Lord Jesus Christ under they don't care under no circumstances with a drink the father's will but that wasn't like Joseph's brothers they slew that little lamb hallelujah and they said we're gonna tell daddy he's dead that was the best thing they did see because when they hear wearing that color coat and then putting the blood on it was a promotion for Joseph even when he didn't know it let me tell you something like the brother said yesterday your King even when you don't know your King ah y'all understand me it's just the way God does things and you and I must understand when it comes to one body you and I must step into the book y'all don't believe me let me say like this when you pastors up here and says oh and David he took that stone and he began to were lit were lit were guess what's happening you have changed position you sitting in your seat and you'll now the David he's speaking on think about it is that right how many y'all say oh well I'm gonna lie better Doug you don't take that position because that's not your position in the world you are the David somebody help me it's the truth you take the positions that you have been predestinated to take the position of is that right when we talk about the Eagles and the crows you don't take the position of the Buzzard you take the positions of the eagle why there's something on the inside that amens you to that even though you may not even see signs of you being an eagle hallelujah am I making sense I want you to understand we are blessed people I know the world they don't understand us you know first of all we are you know we just love church too much my next-door neighbor said to me are you going to church again I say yeah come go with me he never asked me that question again he's a good man I love him I praying for his soul I'm praying for it so I really love this man he's a good man good neighbor and I'm praying for his soul but I'm like because I just asked it all I said Lord just give me a little space give me something to say cuz you know I don't like killing people I'm here to say he hmm and I said Lord just give me some wisdom and I'm telling you the very same day I'm coming out out in my house to go to church he said oh man you going to church again thank you lord yeah do you want to come yeah he's coming he just don't know it yet I believe with all my heart this man is to be a Christian I do if I thought he wasn't I wouldn't bother him you love the Lord see the Christian is the greatest thing a person could ever be this is the only thing that's eternal is that right let me let me move on to say this there are only two faculties that Glover's the human and one of them is faith which brings result and the other is fear it has no value in it right so you go either have faith or fear but in order to have perfect love you've got to have faith hallelujah that's why when we pray for each other it's not about how are you scream and hollow matter of fact that that denotes you sometimes Jesus didn't play with the Devils and I'm not saying nothing wrong with that I'm just saying sometimes we think that's gonna like I was telling somebody young lady the other day you know a couple now said you know what it's so amazing I said we used that Scripture spare the rod spoil the child I said but do you really think a stick or or belt it's gonna drive the devil away if you don't mix that with love somebody help me here you got to mix that spanking with love coz love conquers all if you just thinking the child with no love you know what its gonna do is gonna make that person stubborn but if you mix it with love is gonna soften him up oh come on somebody you gotta understand if you gonna spank him you gotta stake it in love is that right that's how God spank you he spanked you in love this is one of my key scriptures Lord let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven however I'm living there I want to live here however I'm living here I want to live it like that you understand me your faith is of God and fear is of the devil mmm it's true don't you know that even when you got Divine Love entertained the savage beast mmm listen it's the truth and I'm no heart no hard feelings two people who got cats I have problems with Cassie hmm I don't know what you call it but I've seen cats change from natural to supernatural have anybody seen that oh yeah I was a house at the house of a witch and I didn't know it and this witch did whatever he did he was supposed to be a blind medium and he had these huge casting big old Bobcats his name was Bob I'm just saying but my point is he was huge and I got out the car and they had about five of them they loved me brother surely those can't love me I wish they didn't though because when they see me they all come Lord Jesus I told that lady I said get those cats got him on kick him she said yeah if you keep that cat so-and-so gonna get you I said Oh Lord Jesus help me then all of a sudden the cats move we went into the house you understand me this man is telling me things about my brothers and sisters that was true but I didn't know it because it was recently done and so I told no that ain't true he got angry with me and he looked over at that cat that can't hunch this back up like that jumped in the air turned to this big black ball I was sitting in a chair guess what I got up it's the truth goddess and I scream like a girl brother Simmons say what's wrong with you I said you didn't see that I say it's time to go yes you don't tell me that that's power in witchcraft and let me tell you something if there's power in witchcraft there's power in the Holy Ghost cuz all witchcraft is is just a copycat of the real thing listen no no Kingdom was was was as dark as Egypt when it came to witchcraft and they were deep much deeper than any of us can imagine hallelujah what they had back in that day was wood wood with in comparison to what we got in our day would be like a kindergarten to a college graduate they didn't play and when Moses went up there God knew that Moses couldn't do it God had to do it and where did God start God without Moses even start knowing it God started with at the place where Egypt had its greatest power witchcraft hallelujah let me tell you something you don't even realize it but the battle the bride is fighting is being controlled by a witch you think and strange things happening to you you don't even know who's sitting to you that's why it's so important to have the Holy Ghost that's why it's important to have the gifts of God in here so God could identify Oh God have mercy that's why so many people don't want it because they know they can hide y'all we better wake up you better wake up hallelujah I've had experiences that I better not say right now but I've had experiences and I'm gonna tell you something greater is heat us in us then he that is in the world hmm I had a gifted brother come to my house one time and this person had for my birthday had given me some beautiful figurines costly and I really enjoyed it he's sleeping in my chair and God showed him a vision or whatever it was God showed him and says brother did you know there's something in your house he said if you don't believe me go break it up he said you tear it up and I tell you you'll see the reaction of no people and not only did they get mad they left thank God for the Holy Ghost this ain't nothing to play with is real hallelujah they think we strange but I tell you what people of God we are the original can I go on because we got to understand faith is of God you can't operate in the kingdom of God without faith faith is how God created everything and faith is not a thing faith is a person come on come on it oh it's the truth you know sometime I'm gonna tell you something while you have bad dreams some of you and I know you do because sometimes you bump into people all day and you don't even know it you know it's like anything you catch germs you pick up spirits you don't even know it that's why I try to tell people I go to bed saved every night I go to bed every night saved and I wake up every day save Wow cuz I wash I get down and I pray I can't tell you the last time I had a nightmare or a bad dream because I watched that filth off every day I'm telling you something now I'm trying to tell you that your peace amen is being interrupted at night at times because you don't pray before you go to bed I'm going one one way of worship y'all understand me I'm I'm way off anyway but God got me where he wants me hallelujah my question is what is your worship and what is your praise hmm because you got a worship it's not something that everyone can do the Bible says when when when Jesus meant that woman at the well he said the father seeketh those who who would worship Him in spirit and in truth so worship is not not just bowing down jumping and shouting and everything the greatest worship of a believer is to live or to let Christ live in you is that right oh it's the truth you came flat oh god if he can be flattered that all I'm saying is when he sees you living like him that pleases him hallelujah Davo have you considered my servant job what was about Joe it was his character it was what he was living he walked with God what was it his character hallelujah is this okay hallelujah but we we do one thing when they look around with all this power upon them they saw Jesus I'm going to the Mount Transfiguration experience so you can understand where I'm going and the real true believer don't care whether he he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see the glorified Christ makes any difference right a real this is the points line a real true mouth figuration Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah it didn't glorify themselves it didn't glorify nothing else but they saying the glorified Christ hallelujah any true believer that's what it is in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what we're trying to get is that right you know why you say because they meant some way some how many people have committed treason treason to Christ we betrayed him come on somebody many of us have a greater love us we love certain other ones better than we love Christ treason people you know what that is that's worthy of death that's what Judas did he betrayed Christ What did he say you see what I'm saying come on somebody he Jesus Christ is the only one who died for you if you don't glorify Jesus Christ you are going to become a dead tree y'all know who says it's the truth the prophet of God was driven somewhere in the woods and he came again upon these trees they have been burnt over and all of a sudden wind came that's what dead people do these days these dead Christians they don't know they look at you too [Music] they can't understand you but they had their chance opportunity then let Satan come in and destroy them then come to a place that King shout they can't dance he can run they can't say hallelujah and then they look down on you because when the wind blow you being hallelujah when the wind blow you move with the wind somebody help me I want to be that kind of a tree that way he blows I want to sway with it hallelujah give me a tree that got some life in it dead trees can't bring for him no blossom no blooms don't smell or nothing everything smell burnt over come on somebody stuck in their positions they're standing there like tombstones oh here lays so and so and so he lives so and so hallelujah oh but a real tree a real tree I love you ever heard the trees clap oh it's beautiful the wind blows and go it's just beautiful and you mean to tell me the tree knows to clap and you won't hallelujah she is it was the undergrowth that he noticed and there was a new crop coming up I'm telling y'all something I'm putting I put down what God wanted me to say to you all to this morning there was a new crop coming up oh come on a new beginning folks God trying to do something for us this church he's trying to do something he wants you to break through the veil don't think about what other people are doing it has nothing to do with you God is moving in this SAP what he's doing hallelujah you see everybody ain't preaching on character everybody's being so deep hallelujah the deepest thing you can preach to a man is how to receive the Holy Ghost hallelujah because once you get the Holy Ghost and God seals you your days are done the devil is mad with you but hallelujah he can't stop you he knows he can't stop you hallelujah this is what I'm saying he's long as he can wash your mind and make you think you are loser I never been a loser not in the mind of God hallelujah when I didn't know him maybe I was but I didn't know that when I was a loser I was born to be a winner somebody help me I didn't know it just like you didn't know hallelujah but now that I know now that you know there is no time to be distracted hallelujah when Jesus is coming in on that donkey Amen and everybody was crying out Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna is that right oh it was those Pharisees and Sadducees looking at those folks said you know those just open the calls to people I tell you what whether they come from we got to stop this thing did you know that the devil has been trying to stop this since the day of Pentecost hallelujah he didn't care about the church amen until he saw Peter at the gates of beautiful when he says silver and gold have I none such as I have give ID the devil got upset and he's been lad ever since he hates you don't even think he likes you he hates you and when you call on the name of Jesus he hates you even more hallelujah hallelujah because every time you call in the name of Jesus you're saying gee Homer saves Jesus you're all the same is that right every time you call her the name of Jesus you send your home adhara Jesus is my provider Oh glory to God don't take the route to the dead trees huh don't let this church go cold fight fight hallelujah you gotta fight to keep it on fire is that right every time I see and I'm not picking at California but something's happening and spiritually we need to see what's going on here and it seems like every time they you know that's where Susan Street was and you hear the prophet of God talking about you know fire something on fire on a windy day could that be outside could that be something that God is throwing out there so the bride could catch it this is your day if you really want the fire fan it [Music] you said how do I fan the fire you witness you tell somebody about it you testify sad the fire and the more you fan the fire gets greater hallelujah they say the fire is out of control I said all lord please let this fire that I got get out of control hallelujah the thing I love about fire is because it reminds me of myself it reminds me of my daddy did you know your daddy is fire oh yeah how do you know it the power said God is a consuming fire he's fire so if I'm gonna be born of him I must be born a little fire you know fire is that right you have fire on the side of the street and fire on the side nothing on the side of the street that fire says I'm going to see my neighbor it'll jump the street fire other houses on fire a real Christian loves that other Christians are oh come on yo it's a truth you say oh I got a testimony I got a testimony you know some people don't know how to dance anymore they don't know how to shout in the street hallelujah but there's a car christening care where they were if they were on the bus on the bus stop on the street when they praise God they all praise together it must be the same you got to be the same God has not produced an intellectual age Pentecost is Pentecost fire is fire y'all of the Lord you and I must we come into a place and you and I know that the world has fallen apart do you know that Satan has a time to incarnate his people to what's gonna happen if you refuse to let God incarnate himself in you and you're left behind to see the incarnation of Satan hmm nowhere to run nowhere to hide come on somebody you can't even hide in the woods no more cause they got these senses now they can find you and some of us wouldn't even be smart enough to leave our phone behind but they can find you there's no place to hide the only place of a hiding place right now is in Christ is in Christ and you and I must understand God I know God want to do something other Shelly but I feel like something something holding here I know you might be tired but think about it I don't tired - I was tired I said that last night I said my voice and as soon as I said my voice was acting up my boss acted up I did that because I spoken hallelujah and just as soon as I said that I had trouble I said Lord forgive me but we're gonna fight tonight I went on to sing the song because I knew God wanted me to you understand me and that's about me I don't give up I'm a fighter I've been born a fighter hallelujah I'm in the laws army is that right we're here to fight and you've got depressed you yeah I can't stimulate you he can stimulate you if you take the words spoken God will stimulate you and bring you to the place we're looking for this morning Oh God help us here I'm almost done but I'm coming to a place because you know there was a man I think he he was a great Emperor something like a Caesar and he he wanted to honor his soldiers and everything and uh and so he put the bulletin out and and he put the bullet announce and all of the soldiers dressed up and got their little plumes together and everything you know how they're shining they little uh you know chariots and everything else and and they made this parade and but there was one guy hey man he he didn't have nothing you know he came in looking all raggedy and had all kinds of scars all over him and all the other ones thought that that the Caesar was gonna choose them but he he kept looking he has something in his mind he was looking for hallelujah then all of a sudden this one came up he said who are you sir I'm so so so so so I'm just you know in the army sir you know fighting for you how did you get those scars he said sir I just I was fighting to keep in the kingdom for you he said you're the one I won't come sit with me in his army in this battle I want to see some scars you understand me you can't be a Christian without scars proof you've been in the battle battle-scarred veterans that's what he wants to see how many you have scars from your battle scars because you stood up for Jesus and your family deserted you scars because they couldn't take you no longer on the job being a Jesus Freak don't some of us don't even know what that is we blend in so well sometime we go to jobs and act like camellias just blend right on in there God don't want us to blend in what fellowship that darkness have with light we need some scars y'all love the Lord I'm almost done but let me say it like this I get on that plane and I try to get the cheapest ticket I can and they always sit us in the back I'm telling when I buy a ticket because I figured you know using paying a lot of money on a plane flight unless you going overseas in as long you want some comfort but when you just find around here I figure those first class people don't get at the same time I do yeah that right ain't hurting my feeling because they separate my restroom from this I packed my lunch you know what I'm saying I think you're not messing with my mind with this nonsense just give me a cheap ticket hallelujah you know what I'm trying to say Satan comes right in the church and he'll do the same thing make a difference sets us in classes there ain't numbered one class but here separate us because of abilities hallelujah and I don't care the man at the back they're gonna get there just as soon as you get there cuz you understand when God calls for his bride we all coming up god I don't say this role first that role second no we're all coming up here to the church ages that way but when it comes to the bride he calls us by one name and we get up is that right so you can understand what I'm trying to say what is your worship gonna be how are you gonna worship so many things I've left out but humming to work how we gonna worship everybody can dance and shout and do everything in the club you know you can do all that and God knows I'm not against that y'all know that right y'all understand that I do that more than anybody else I think at least at my church anyway they look at me like I'm a show - okay I really don't care I cry and carry on just like crazy sometimes and sometimes after I doubt it's all over I get a little embarrassed a little bit to myself because of pride or whatever it is but for the most part spectacle or something but at the end of the day I know I can't force anything but I do know one thing God is trying to transform us I've been up here a long time and God has been trying to transform us change us we can't we can't sell it for the religion folk this is not what God called us for and I have I've had religion all my life mama you know the person who showed me that God was real was my mom hmm and my mother was an illiterate woman she couldn't read or write according to records she has 16 children you understand me my mom died at 56 and she looked like she was 75 because she works so hard you understand me but one thing my mom gave me that no education could possibly give me and that was Jesus you know how it wasn't it wasn't she couldn't just she couldn't just take the Bible and read it she couldn't read she said Junior come read the Bible for me I'll go read the Bible for my mom and she just rejoicing and everything else and I didn't understand one word I couldn't understand it ah my mother lives so holy I used to feel sorry for I said mom ain't nobody else living like that not even the preacher yeah cuz I saw the preacher yeah I saw the preacher ain't telling you but the point is I used to feel sorry for my mom but one day when she got really sick and about ready to go home because she had cancer of the liver we didn't know that it was a hereditary disease that they strike the ladies in our family until recently my niece had to have a liver transplant and now my sister has the same disease my mom had but the point is I saw my mom who she's a really fair skin like fair skinned woman colored or black or however you want to say it black American or American Way been English we are who we are God knows I've never been ashamed of Who I am and you shouldn't be ashamed of who you are I think there's beauty in every race so anyway my mother was where you could tell she was sick literally her eyes turned yellow and her skin turned yellow and she was just fragile she was like a she look like a wholly cost person but my mother told me she told me before she died she said God gonna save you and she told me exactly where I would be saved Church I would go to and she said God's gonna send a greater light to you she said whatever you do don't leave that Apostolic Church she said it's gonna be hard their time you're gonna get discouraged but God is gonna send a greater light that's what she called the message and sure enough God sent the greater light you understand what I'm saying now I'm saying all of that is because what I was mocking and what I was feeling sorry for was the thing that my mother loved dearly she loved God she would pray for hours yeah I go to school and come back home and my mom still in the restroom crying out and praying you understand me and you know I think to myself if I could just get a little bit just a little bit especially that prayer if she wasn't saying our father world and she was crying out for her children and everybody else and I said Lord if I could just get her I said I mean just a little bit with that hmm but it was real she was real you say oh you know I've heard people said well if she wasn't in the message she was in the message because she was in Christ and Christ is the message oh yeah I've seen her since then I know y'all say well you didn't see well whatever God was showing me she showed up that's the only way I can tell you but my point my point is I know she's not dead and what she gave me I saw a real God cuz she was basically paralyzed almost and she said Lord Jesus just let me go to the bathroom one more time that's all she asked and she had to have a little bit of help my sister got understand she couldn't walk my mom walked to the bathroom and my mouth dropped because I saw God for the first time I saw a supernatural being helped my mom move when she was supposed to never move again and it was that day I said to myself Lord if I ever become a Christian I want to serve to God that mybama soon I saw God real for the first time and she had no education but there were times she said junior we had we were poor my daddy left us like he did even had to raise all those kids work all week and some time I didn't even know when she'd come home like sisters raised us but junior daddy's mama mama done showed me something I mean a garden showed myself don't worry Junior we have food here just before you leave mister truth and I would go outside I was on my way out the door and here is somebody done bought groceries and sitting on the porch that's God that's the kind of God I like that's the one I love that when you in need he supplies your knees huh he comes at a time you least expected but if you trust him he'll be there y'all understand me I'm not interested in serving a dead God I need a real one I need to see him living in me everyday not sometimes every day and he wants to do it and I want him to do it why do you think I'm here today it was God who sent me here I had other issues going on at my house I could have stayed home but God told me he wanted me to be here listen people move the veil don't look at me listen to what's being preached that's Christ hallelujah is God speaking to you hallelujah don't take your eyes off Jesus now hallelujah keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus hallelujah because just as soon as you take your eyes off of him you're going to sink and you say oh I got trouble you ain't had no more trouble than Peter did when he asked Jesus that Lord didn't become you talking about walking on water y'all you've seen how the waves and everything - and how bad they are and listen like I said he wasn't walking on a plane he was walking on water that was bolster us what about us whatsoever you do in word or deed and I am closing do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah i'ma saying again whatsoever you do in word or deed that's worship do it all in the name of Jesus people say I've had a hard day today my question is did you acknowledge the Lord today because the Bible said if you acknowledge him in all your ways he will direct your path an often time we don't talk a talk to the Lord about what we're gonna do in the day and so therefore he can't give us information on what not to do but if you acknowledge the Lord God will direct your path hallelujah you love the Lord so demons are real how you gonna fight them off without the Holy Ghost did you know bad habits or bad spirits is that right a habit is something you can't control it's something I have to do and when you've got to have it if it's a bad habit it's a bad spirit and if it's a bad spirit we called them demons and Devils whoo in the vision of the United States prophet of God said there be Christians packing demons cease or any-any ain't gonna do no none of us good it means we go sit up there and act like oh I'm all right well I'm righteous I'm holy and all of us need some washing there are things that in our lives that you know all about and God is saying okay this is your time this is your opportunity hallelujah and understand if God is saying this don't reject him because this moment will be replayed remember when I came by is that right you don't think it's gonna be replayed it will be replayed whether you here or there is that right because when Jesus descended into the Lord region when he went to hell he preached to the souls that were in prison and he said why did not you listen to Noah that wasn't nor that was me he loved the Lord that's just bound a word of Prayer dear Jesus we know Lord God that you're real and father we know that you are God sir we come to you we ask you God because you can do in just a moment the words that have been spoken I believe by your grace that you gave me these words to speak this morning and lord if the people could see that in order to fully worship you in the way you desire we must bear your character your spirit it's not just the anointing on the flesh that's gonna do it anymore not just dawning on the Spirit it must be done in the soul father help us hear that we will we would break beyond this veil there's something or God that we we it just seem like it's I don't know Lord you know but father I it's not that God can do it's got to be in the people's hearts we got to want this more than we want life we can't allow the devil to feel okay I got pray for yesterday and so I'm alright today not unless you came to complete victory and when a man comes to complete victory he or she will know it lord help us tonight or this morning we humble ourselves before your Lord we pray father God this morning that you break the yolks of the enemy Lord the word has been sown and we pray father God that you be merciful be merciful to us this morning let your grace be upon us Lord God we thank your father we thank you for your grace in your mercy let your perfect will be done Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray you you mmm you'll always be my song or it was grace that brought my liver tea I'll never know just how he came to love me so he'll be on all of my father and so money I shall forever mine are to Calvary Chile the cross where Jesus died for Li hao MA that grace that called life holy so he looked beyond my thoughts and saw I shall I shall live my life to Calvary TV the cry where Jesus died for me how that way that call my fallen soul healer beyond my fault and so let me say this this morning I don't know your lives I don't know what you do and what you don't do but God does and when I minister by God's grace I just tried to say two things he would want me to say I know for a fact that when we working from the pulpit sometimes you might think that somebody's picking on you or singling you out and I want to say that's the devil it's God who knows your life his God who pulls this God who tries to draw we are in a time that time is short and I know I probably said a lot of things that perhaps some may not have understood but I'm a missionary I love people I love people I hate Satan I hate what he do to us he's an evil beyond evil person he's a destroyer and God said I came to give you life and that you may have it more abundantly there was a time I was a sinner I didn't know him I used to have believe it or not long hair and you know I I remember going to the church when I had all this hair and I thought man I can't get baptized a car that's gonna mess it up and you know that evening I had to come right back to the place I left when I got baptized one of my old friends from the world was dead I didn't even know I don't think he was saved I may have heard by rumor and when I went in there and I saw him and I I thought he was the biggest pimp ever who in high school wear white suits with white shoes and big hats and I said to him oh if God can save you I know he can save me and when I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you could believe this or not but when I came up out of the water I saw all these life similar to these but they were everywhere everywhere in this little room and I began to scream see the light see all those lights all those lights momently at the moment I was baptized I became insane cuz nobody could see the lights with me but I didn't know it I thought everybody saw the light oh my god never saw that light again those lights again until I came to this message all people it's real I just wish I could give give what I have to to let others see and know how true it is I stumbled in life because I saw my mom live a holy life and I used to try I did I tried and I would fall on my face all the time I didn't know what I know nothing about the Holy Ghost I didn't know the Holy Ghost would change that I didn't know the Holy Ghost which strengthened me and take those desires away I didn't know that I thought Christianity was human effort and I found out I couldn't do it I just couldn't do it that was the thing I system to get my mom like how do you do that I couldn't do it but when I found out about the Holy Ghost she told me but I was afraid of it that was my mama get all in the spirit and be jerking and it looked like it hurt so it scared me she didn't know what she couldn't help it my mom came home one time speaking in tongues and everybody thought she was having a fit yeah you know how they did it they put on the flow and put a spoon in the mouth it was just a grace of God that God didn't wipe us out but we didn't know we were Baptist forgive me for saying I could we didn't know about that stuff and it took her a while to come back to herself and says don't ever do that again she tried to explain to us but when I got it oh my he would tell me you don't have it you don't have it yet and I mean God had already started to change in my life sanctifying you know you know I used to help I hope this is OK this favorite drink I come home from church and my my brother Logue done took it out of refrigerate he bringing it up to me I didn't have no desire he didn't know ha ha he didn't understand the garden and took all that out of me y'all understand me I understand I worked at a club I drink whenever I wanted to y'all you mean I was hooked let me put it better that way and God in a moment's time took it from me I know what God can do I look at people I said oh you just have no idea - joy that's in this thing's you you that tormented you all your life y'all know what I'm saying abuse is see when you start going there people get quiet but more than 99% of us have been been abused in some way and only the Holy Ghost can rip that out of you there are things in my life I thought I'd never overcome but thanks be to God he just didn't help me overcome he took it all the way only God can do that there's not one person in my life I can say I hate I even love those who didn't love me those who abuse me I loved him what are you saying brother Maya Taylor - I only God could have done that for me my daddy hated me he was a Muslim and he saw me going in the way of a Christian he made me know he hated me think about a child having to live under a daddy who hates him I suffered for that for years lot of my decisions in life were bad decisions because of him one day I'd even realize that thing was affecting me still I was coming home from a church service oh pardon me wasn't a church service God has shown me in the dream my daddy was gonna die I didn't know when but I saw it in a dream and the dream is real whenever my dreams are real and no need to interpret it I know it's true so I told the church in Iowa said my dad is gonna die don't know when he's gonna die I don't know why I'm saying these things but then I said I gotta go see him one of the sisters felt checked about me going to see him but I started on my way and and and and my daddy you said well what about which I see my daddy married after leaving my mom the way he did he married a woman that was a witch and when I say that I mean a real witch ain't talked about the ones who trying to be a wannabe she was a real one she could change the images on a on a photograph my wife didn't believe me but I told him then I then then it was proven but anyway this lady even when I was a child tried to curse me and God put all that back to my mind me meeting this lady who was supposed to have been my aunt trying to put spells on me even as a child she hated me then and she made my daddy hate me so I'm going to see my daddy I got on the phone with my daddy and he started reeling me out all I ever tried to do was be good to him and all I got was Kirstie's from him think about I'm already hurting I'm already rejected from my daddy all these years and I would have taken care of him if he would have allowed me to but all of these things went on in my life and I can remember going down the highway because the law stayed that sister called me says brother Brooke she says I really believe God don't want you to go see him I said sister I really believe you right because I called him and he carried on so bad I really believed that he would have killed me if I had gone he was screaming and hollering at me as if I put some kind of bad stuff on him and I know that's what his wife must I don't know how to know that but for some reason he felt like I was the cause of his problem needless to say I saw my daddy being buried and we wouldn't find out that he had been buried until after he was buried and it happened just that way but coming home I cried out I couldn't hardly see the road crying out to the Lord God take this away from me I'm tired of my daddy's influence in my life take this away from me Oh God and I began to cry and cry and cry and I says God I don't even know why these things has happened to me Lord why my daddy don't love me and God said to me I fixed it this way so that I can be the father that you never had and I said Lord be my father [Music] my mother died when I was going to my senior year in high school so anyway when he said that such a piece came over my soul I have never been influenced by him since see those kinds of things don't you don't have to be around to influence you because it's a spirit [Music] those of us who've been born in a message and don't know what I'm talking about you blessed I wouldn't wish to some of the things I've had to go through in life or a dog or anybody or anything but I just want to say that God has a deliverer gotta be the friend that you thought you'd never have when I need a song he sends me a song when I need confidence he talks to me and that's what God wants to be you're all in all tonight that's what we have not been allowing him to do we fail in that area he wants to be your all and you're afraid to let him be your own and God wants to conquer that in you tonight he wants to conquer that he wants you to lean on him completely 100% everybody else in here I'll tell you you don't have to tell me you flesh and everybody in here is hurting somewhere you can't tell me you're not I know you are that's the devil is busy some of us don't even know how to express ourselves emotionally because of what we've gone through in the past God won't fix all of that in order to go forward you got to lay it down with that right God told Joshua before before they crossed over they said sanctify the people sanctify their in order for us to go on we got to sanctify ourselves before we cross over we got to get rid of all of the baggage that the devil has put in in our lives we got to get rid of it he touched me yes he touches everybody that needs some help why don't you just raise your hand and then flooding my soul Oh something happened and Oh he touched me and made me whoa he touched me yeah touch me [Music] oh joy that flooding must let the Lord touch you here let the Lord touch him something forget about it forget about your neighbor forget about those whose match to you this is your opportunity to let God touch you this morning hallelujah oh say it one more time he touched me [Music] he touched me yeah deadlines

the house of the Lord today oh you say well it's running a little little running a little long well I tell you it's worth every minute he deserves everything we give him and so much more I'm with brother Brooks when he said you know they tell me that the more popular movies that come out especially those sequels and prequels and that kind of stuff that everybody's waiting on there are three hours long so I don't know why people expect to get in and get out in 60 minutes this is your life this is your soul and you're getting ready for another world we're preparing this morning for eternity hey man I appreciate at least brother Brooks as we got over across in the hour he started calling at night so we're we've had Sunday morning and Sunday night and God is good a man I want to thank the Lord for everything we have heard I want to thank you for being here and for entering in and receiving what you could from the Lord and I'm gonna ask the Lord to go with you and continue to just pour himself over your life it's real it's real how many of you appreciate ever not ever not this weekend all that God has done for us thank you sir thank you for giving just bow your head for just a moment we're not gonna hold you longer Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you Lord for all that has been accomplished in these meetings and we thank you for every gift that you have used in this house to bless and to help your bride now Lord your servants stood before us today completely transparent he reached down into places of his life that are private better his business and because he loves us and because he loves you he shared those things with us and I know that it has spoken to many of us there are many people in this room and on the stream who can relate to some of these wounds and some of these dark places and I pray Lord that our brother and the sacrifice that he made will not be in vain but I pray that every one of us will offer all of this baggage as he called it that we will offer every bit of it to you today Lord on the altar that we would everyone find grace to lay it down that our lives would no longer be weighted down with the pain of the past that our lives would no longer be affected by all that we have walked through to this point I pray Lord for new life for new beginnings Oh God even those of us who have walked before you for most of our lives we crave we desire a new beginning as well Lord let us find that in the blood let us find that in grace and in mercy I pray bless our brother and strengthen him and bless his family and church go with us as we leave today and the Lord draw us back together to meet in your name I pray in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
