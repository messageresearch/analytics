[0:00] you can't plant a seed and because it
[0:04] hasn't come up when you think it ought
[0:07] to come up you can't just abandon your
[0:09] seed
[0:17] I want you to know the enemy is
[0:18] strategic
[0:20] he knows exactly when to strike because
[0:22] the Bible tells us that year after year
[0:25] Harvest after harvest the Israelites
[0:29] would plow the field plant the seed
[0:31] cultivate the growth
[0:33] hold the weeds water the plants
[0:36] fertilize with fish heads and whatever
[0:39] else they did in that time so just about
[0:42] the time
[0:44] bushes are big
[0:46] the blooms have passed the shells are
[0:49] hanging the Lagoon shells are hanging on
[0:51] and it's just about time for Harvest
[0:57] why why don't they come when the ground
[0:59] needs to be tended
[1:01] because the enemy is
[1:05] his children want something for free
[1:09] they don't know what good sweat can
[1:11] accomplish
[1:13] the enemy will come in and try to steal
[1:15] your Harvest without putting any effort
[1:17] into what's going on
[1:18] he'll wait until it's just about ready
[1:20] to verse fourth and the Bible tells us
[1:22] that year after year when the lentils
[1:24] were ready
[1:26] the Philistines would come up over the
[1:28] hill screaming like a bunch of wild
[1:29] Indians
[1:31] scare the Israelites
[1:35] run off in the bushes and rocks and hide
[1:39] would come in with their baskets
[1:43] if you're a Believer you need to
[1:45] understand there's a turf war going on
[1:47] Satan wants to steal the bride's
[1:50] territory her jurisdiction and Dominion
[1:54] he wants to user from her authority to
[1:57] Sidetrack the bride from her destiny
[2:00] Satan wants to cut the bride off from
[2:03] her source
[2:04] he wants you to spiritually Wither in
[2:06] the field that's why he's after the
[2:08] pastors
[2:11] he desires to weaken you so that he can
[2:13] simply walk off with your inheritance
[2:21] [Music]
[2:22] when you think it ought to come up you
[2:25] can't just abandon your scene
[2:27] somebody's got to have faith
[2:33] and say I planted it in faith and I'm
[2:36] gonna guard it insane
[2:41] and one day I'm gonna repeat
[2:45] [Music]
[2:47] not in my timing
[2:50] [Music]
[2:52] but in the Lord's time
[2:55] so wait reap
[2:59] you've sowed prayed waited
[3:03] nothing comes
[3:06] in fact for some of you it seems like a
[3:08] harvest is long overdue
[3:11] sometimes we get tired of waiting but I
[3:14] am here to tell you today whatever you
[3:17] do do not abandon your seed
[3:23] do not abandon your seat
[3:25] you can speed up a harvest
[3:29] depends on what you do while you're
[3:30] waiting on your Harvest you
[3:35] if you're grumbling and complaining if
[3:37] you're reciting all the things you don't
[3:39] understand forgetting all the things you
[3:41] do understand am I with me
[3:43] everybody has doubt
[3:45] everybody has to deal with that from
[3:47] time to time but don't you get caught up
[3:49] in that vicious cycle whatever you do be
[3:52] careful about your thoughts watch the
[3:54] words that come out of your mouth you've
[3:56] got a lot at stake you've planted many
[3:59] fields with seed you have prayed and
[4:02] planted seed for your family
[4:05] you prayed and planted seed for your
[4:07] co-workers who prayed and planted seed
[4:10] for your children
[4:12] in the field now
[4:15] I I don't even mean a geographical
[4:17] location
[4:19] I'm in a state of faith
[4:21] a field where you have put something in
[4:23] the ground believing that God is going
[4:26] to give you the abundance of what you're
[4:27] playing the multiplication of the seed
[4:30] if you want the favor of the Lord to
[4:32] fall on you in your waiting season you
[4:34] spend that time let the people praise
[4:36] the old God let all the people praise
[4:39] thee then shall the Earth yield her
[4:42] increase and God even our own God shall
[4:46] bless us
[4:48] how many of you are ready to plant your
[4:50] seed and guard them
[4:52] water them with praise
[4:54] stay on top of the thing until the
[4:56] Harvest comes I cannot tell you the
[4:59] fields that we have abandoned through
[5:00] the years
[5:01] I cannot tell you the harvests that we
[5:04] have lost in our lives because we got
[5:07] tired of defending the field
[5:09] we're coming down to an hour now
[5:12] or we can't afford to lose another field
[5:15] of harvest
