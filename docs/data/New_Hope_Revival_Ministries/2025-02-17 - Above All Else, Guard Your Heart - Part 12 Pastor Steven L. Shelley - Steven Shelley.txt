========================================

Description:
This message examines the nature and impact of offense in believers' lives, revealing how it partners with spirits like anger to create compound spiritual problems. Through Hebrew word studies and practical examples, it demonstrates how offense operates as a gateway for other negative spirits to gain access. The teaching emphasizes believers' authority over their mental battlefield while providing practical guidance for daily victory. Central to its message is the understanding that complete freedom comes not through personal effort but through maintained surrender to Christ's healing ministry.

and do what you do set our hearts on you come and do what you do cuz we need to move we need to move so when it seems it can be done I know God is big enough I can run the race I'm called to run cuz I know God is big enough he'll finish everything he starts he'll meet us right here where we are and I can feel Faith rising up cuz I know God is big enough [Music] oh he's big enough [Music] I've got a heart that's full of Faith filled helplessness and there are mountains ahead that I can't move by myself but I know when I'm weak he's strong when I can barely breathe there's still a song even though it's hard right now I'm not here on my own so when it seems it can be done oh I know God is big enough I can run the race I'm called to run cuz I know God is big enough oh he'll finish everything he starts he'll meet us right here where we are and I can't feel Faith rising up cuz I know God God is big [Music] enough he's bigger than the fear that surrounds me he's bigger than the chains that have bound me he's bigger than the story my past could [Music] tell who it's bigger than the of tomorrow he's bigger than the hurt and the sorrow he's bigger than the lies that I told myself he's bigger than the fear that surrounds me he's bigger than those chains that have bound me he's bigger than the story my past can tell oh he's bigger than the weight up tomorrow he's bigger than the hurt and the sorrow he's big bigger than the lies that I told myself sing it again he's bigger than the fear that surrounds me he's bigger than the chains that have bound me he's bigger than the story my past could [Music] tell he's bigger than the weight of tomorrow and he's bigger than the hurt and the sorrow he's bigger than the lies that I told myself so when it seems it can be done I know God is being I can run the race I'm called to run cuz I know God is big enough he'll finish everything he starts he'll meet us right here where we are I can feel Faith rising up cuz I know God is big I want them to sing that one more time and I want you put the words back up please I want you to emphasize this line when you it's not a line that's repeated so you have to emphasize it in faith what I mean by that is when you say these words believe it really consciously make that the see I believe this all of it but this line is being highlighted for me in the spirit I can run the race I'm called to run amen I'm a firm believer that we're not all running we're running in the same race but we're not all running the same race because our circumstances are different past circumstances present circumstances maybe even future circumstances are different so you've got a race and only you can run it and you've got to believe you've got to believe that you can he saw it he knows it he knew it and you can run the race that you're called to run simply simply because God's just big enough yes he is you you need you need to quit arguing with him and you need to quit contradicting him someone asked recently when we've been talking about forgiveness somebody said what about how do I forgive myself well that's the hard part but if you really really think about it this is not going to be what you want to hear but if you really think about it why should you bother why should you worry because if God has forgiven you you're forgiven it's done you you didn't sin against yourself particularly now I know that mentally and emotionally we have to come to forgiveness and we have to quit carrying guilt and condemnation that's something a little bit different altogether but what I have to remember if I ever have something that lingers that I am holding against my own self even though the Lord has already forgiven me I have to remember what the word said it's done he's big enough to forgive it he's big enough to put the blood on it and so if I continue to hold it and use it against my own self I'm really just arguing with him just really contradicting what he has said let's stop doing that when we catch ourselves doing it let's just say Okay Lord I come into agreement with your word in my life I believe what you say I can run the race that I'm called to run sing it again and let that let all of it be real but that one line take it everyone it seems it can be done I know God is big enough I can run the race I'm called to run cuz I know God is big enough he'll finish everything he starts he'll meet us right here where we are and I can feel Faith rising up cuz I know God is big enough Oh Lord You're big enough [Music] on the days that the shadows of Doubt make me feel small I declare that I don't stand in my strength at all oh no cuz I won't live a day you didn't plan every single moment is in your hands even when the whole world shakes you're the rock on which I stand so when it seems it can be done and I know God is big enough I can run the race I'm called to run cuz I know God is big enough he'll finish everything he starts he'll meet us right here where we are and I can feel Faith rising up cuz I know God is one more [Music] time so when it seems it can be I know God is big enough I can run the race I'm called to run cuz I know God is big enough he'll finish everything he starts he'll meet us right here where we are and I can feel Faith Rising I know God [Music] is oh yes Lord you are big enough to handle all of my problems you are big enough Lord to give me the grace to get up over a mountain you are big enough to help me go through it if that's what is necessary you are big enough and I am standing on that rock the rock Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh what a thought as we go to prayer today the needs that you have on your heart he's big enough to handle every one of them amen do you have a need you just want to lift your hand into the presence of the Lord he is able to do it let's remember I don't see sister Kathy she I know she was sick yesterday we want to remember her all right we need to keep praying for her let's keep praying for sister Kathy I know that Edith is in need of a touch from the Lord uh sister Sharon wasn't able to be here today she called just before the service and a tree across her Road

and I'm glad the light of the Glorious gospel has arisen in our hearts and he has lighted up our path that we could see where we're going he sure has amen Jonathan it's been a while since we've seen you it's nice to see you this morning God bless you Wesley good to see you God bless you we had a wonderful day yesterday celebrating Ginger and brother Magnus and it's hard for me to call him Eric called him brother Magnuson for since I've known him but we were glad that we could celebrate their day yesterday and we pray for them as they journey into life together um all that you did to make that possible we say God bless you richly for everything that you did to be a part of that I know that the Lord is faithful to uh bless us in what we do for him as unto the Lord you know everything that we do should be as unto the Lord because when we do it as unto people we get disappointed if we don't get thanked but when we do it as unto him we do it with joy with gratefulness because he has been so faithful to us some of us encountered no power today how many of you were without power see even the people on the campground the lower part is it comes in from a different way and they lost power in the lower part and uh the power company was actually supposed they've set Stakes to reroute that power to go down the hill this way instead of coming through the woods they have not yet done it so today I also lost power and so we experience first world problems um such as a cold shower and a cold shower I've taken cold showers in third world countries but some years ago I took the hot water tanks out of my house and I put in an electric on Point water heater and so when the power is out there's no Reserve it's just cold so I got a cold shower today well when the Electric's out there's no coffee pot my wife put the kettle on the grill and uh she had a cup that we were able to put coffee grounds in and pour the water over like a French press and so I was able to have coffee but a different way then when I got ready to leave for church the garage door didn't open well any of you that have a garage door know that on a garage door opening there's a rope that you can pull on and you release the door and you can put the door up manually well I forgot that somewhere along the way that rope broke and so uh my wife said I can get a chair for you to stand on I said ah we've got a vehicle outside that runs we can bring a different vehicle so that was some of what we encountered today to get to church but we're grateful to be in the house of the Lord to sing praises together with you the Lord is faithful in every way he uh I think he allows those things sometimes to let us know how good we have it he has been most most precious to us in all of the provision that that we have as we were gathered together in the fellowship Paul yesterday and you looked around and you saw how that it was decorated and made so beautiful and and that one wall that still was showing the insulation and oh how we want to get it done we do and in God's due time we will God will provide that we can know how to set up a kitchen and and get all the electrical outlets in the right place and and get all the plumbing in the right place and then sheetrock it and be able to put cabinets on it the Lord will provide for that he's faithful to do it I have uh I have observed over the last sometime that it right out on this end of the building there's kind of a a a a a a a ditch of a valley that has been put there in cement and you we we've read the quote along the way about when when our faith can move a sand off of the side of a mountain and I look at that place out there and I see the sand that's coming off the top of this parking lot and it makes me know we've got to get this parking lot sealed before it's down to the gravel and so that's why we've kind of put that on hold uh down at the fellowship hall we have a little over $8,000 in the building fund right now it's going to take toward uh probably toward $20,000 by the time the dirt work is done to keep the water from running across the parking lot in PR in preparation to seal the parking lot everything has to be done in order so that we don't have to redo we don't want to spend money twice when we can spend it once and so we thank you for your giving uh we don't want to forget Jerusalem God called us to Jerusalem and so we want to make sure that we're still giv into Jerusalem and that that need is met uh the apartment there in Jerusalem is is still least in our name we want to make sure we take care of that so all of your giving give as unto the Lord not unto men or under a project as unto the Lord and then when he blesses you you will know that it is because you have done it rightfully you have done it according to the word you've done it with a cheerful heart and he gives back pressed down and shaken together that's who he is he's a god of multiplication he knows how to multiply what we give he knows how to multiply it back into our house it may not come back in the same dollar amount it may not come back in dollars and cents it may come back as a gift it may come back as a savings on something that's who he is so you remember that as you give of your tithe and offering not giving it to a man it's as unto the Lord because it's keeping Covenant with him brother Ellas can I call on you today and brother Austin it's good to see you back with us will you help brother Ellas as you go to the people uh to receive the tithe and offering brother Kate is going to sing we're going to

would have been brother Steve Curry's birthday I don't believe in birthdays in heaven you you you don't celebrate time in heaven uh so every day is your birthday in heaven how about that it's eternity but if he would have been with us today he would have had a birthday and and and uh I can't help but think about him I I'm so grateful for the years that he served the Lord here and for the time that he served the Lord in the Grange as well uh tomorrow is Levi's birthday is Le is that Levi standing there no yeah it is uh let's wish Levi happy birthday if you are getting your Bible you can get get it ready to proverbs 4 forgot about having to read these but it's it's good to do it and then on Thursday the 20th is Elias's birthday so we want to say happy birthday to Ellas on Thursday and that is the Jernigan's anniversary Chad and Jennifer will have a wedding anniversary on Thursday and let's use that as an opportunity to pray for Chad that God will get a hold of his heart and help him get through the battle that he's going through we know what it means to fight we fight every day of Our Lives Jesus is the victory we have to take him at his word and go on and uh but uh they've got a sweet love story I know they love each other I know they care for each other I know God put them together he give them three beautiful children and we're very thankful for for them and for the role that they have played in our personal life and also in this ministry happy anniversary uh I will say uh like I really think about most everybody uh you need a crown you certainly deserve a crown my wife's will be bigger because she deserves it more living with me but uh did I say Hodes anniversary I I I've got it right here in front of me tomorrow is not only Levi's birthday but it's brother Austin and sister Anna haji's anniversary how many years seven years they both get crowns proverbs 4 uh verse 23- 27 you're familiar with that I know but I want us to go back there because we're going to do some teaching this morning I need his help we always do we're here to lift up his name thank you for pressing through your uh lack of electri elri it and whatever else you had to fight to get here today God was gracious and uh he gave you strength and we had to kind of navigate our way down 250 because of the uh work that was going on there but we we're just thankful that we are uh with power and no trees on the church and God is good keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life let's go a bit further put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee let thine eyes look right on straight ahead and let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established lished turn not to the right hand nor to the left and withdraw or remove thy foot from evil Lord thank you again for these wise words of instruction but they're really more than just instruction it's a warning a big one to us and you have emphasized that in the spirit for this season and so we ask that you would help us to be Guardians over our own heart the seed of emotions and now we ask that you would move all distraction from this house we have come fighting to get here and now we desire that you would talk to us let us hear your voice in your word and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said you may be seated so this morning we are moving just a little bit further in our study of offense and we will call this the characteristics and strongholds of offense uh who would have thought that you could preach so much from the word about one thing well the issue with offense is that there are partnering spirits that like to run with the wound and they are not there to help you they're not there to soothe you they're there to complicate and multiply the impact of what you are experiencing and what you have experienced we Face these kinds of offenses all the time and by God's design we're supposed to be able to just step out from them and keep moving toward the prize which is Jesus Jesus Christ how many of you remember it's not a golden street it's not a Jasper wall it's it's Christ he's the trophy he's the prize when we gain him we've gained everything somebody said we gained him we've gained the world do you really want the world I'm not interested in the world as it stands is my inheritance but I have a new Heaven and a new Earth that's mine that's what the scripture promises so uh we want to be be able to recognize and identify because we I believe very strongly this has been a hindrance to us in this local assembly for a long time the inability is quiet the inability to step past the offense then to deal with all the partnering spirits that come with offense and let them pile on top of each other and the wounds on top of each other until we can no longer see a person for who they are in Christ when we look at them we only remember what they've done to us that's not God's Will and I'll read you a place uh in in a few moments where brother brandom says it shuts down the kingdom of God I I I think that's pretty serious indictment against me against you against anybody who walks continues to walk in that kind of a place you are affecting the kingdom of God you're affecting your own personal walk with Christ your family your community your church Community uh and so forth and Etc it just sort of goes on and on it compounds it gets bigger it doesn't get smaller until we deal with it anybody with me this morning already good that word in the Hebrew that we have looked at several times before keep uh in verse 23 it it means more than just holding on to something in fact that's not what it means at all it doesn't mean hold onto your heart it means to guard it to watch over it to to observe it to preserve it that's why the complete Jewish Bible says uh the verse is translated this way above everything else guard your heart for it is the source of life's consequences now consequences are the circumstances that happen to us because of decisions that we have made that's what a consequence is and David Stern when he looked at the Hebrew word that is used here he said it needs to be a little sharper than what I see it in the King James I want to portray what I believe the Hebrew is saying and that is everything that happens in your life flows out from your heart that's why the scripture says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh the mouth talks uh but Dr Stern said it's not just the mouth it's everything you begin to attract the very emotion negative emotion that you hold on to so if you haven't dealt with jealousy it just gets bigger and bigger if you have never dealt with your pride then Pride just multipli lies and it morphs into other forms and so that has to be dealt with you may sit here this morning and wonder why because the Lord says so that's why we're here that's why we're bringing this because the Lord says so and we we should do everything we can to give him all the attention he deserves uh the word keep could all also be translated here for Focus your mind but that's not strong enough it actually means to lock something I may have I may have given that to you in a note the word keep could be translated here uh Focus your mind this word can mean from the Hebrew to lock something or to fix something to its place in modern Hebrew the same word that's used here in Proverbs means to lock a bolt in place like a uh not just a Twist knob lock but what we call a deadbolt so in Hebrew the verse is saying put a deadbolt on your heart don't let it slip around control it watch your emotions and hold them in place and I think this is the best advice that we could get in the hour that we're living in now where offense is absolutely running rampant on every front we learned that offense comes from that Greek word scandalon and we're going to just quickly go over this before we move on and that is a stumbling block or a trap if it's actually describing the place where the cheese is laid where the bait is placed scandalon a and we know then that the enemy desires to use offense as a bait to draw you into something dark to draw you into negativity to draw you into bitterness to draw you into unforgiveness to draw you into pride and so you and I as we have covered well before we just have to make up our mind I'm not taking the bait you know you you've got the problem you understand what I'm saying it's easy to get offended but when you recognize that you know this is not my problem the things you're saying and doing uh could really hurt but I I'm I'm not going to take on whatever your issue is toward me you know you can't get offended unless you choose to get offended you you you can't even get angry unless you choose to be angry the Bible tells us that we have control a godly man has control over all of his emotions and the Bible doesn't tell us that we should never be angry he tells us that we should keep it we should look after it guard it lock it so that it doesn't go too far how do you know if anger is gone too far the scripture says Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath when you hear that you think metaphorically don't you it's a metaphor for something but guess what it's really literal language uh I if you look at it in the original it's not painting a poetic picture don't let the sun go down it's painting a literal picture it's a practical guideline for negative emotions including anger it means that as the day draws to a close let your anger be done when you are getting married some of you did anybody give you this uh advice don't go to bed mad with one another did you know that scriptural advice Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath we we spiritualize and make metaphors for things that we don't really want to deal with I hear you now I hear you loud and clear no amens but I hear you loud and clear I hear what you're thinking it I don't like confrontation I don't want to De I don't want to I know it'll accelerate and I don't want bring it up at bedtime because we'll be uh up at night no no no the scripture didn't say discuss it play it out again but you said no no no I did not yes you did say and then I said that's not what you said how many of you know that sometime trying to sort it it's like the agitator on a washing machine it's there to beat it up you don't want to agitate it you want to let it go and once you go through it again all the emotion comes back and and you feel it worse than you felt it before the scripture didn't say discuss it sort it and settle it before the sun goes down the Bible simply said be angry and sin not and not to let the sun go down on your wrath wrath is anger and God is telling us in his word Let It Go if if you live with the person you're angry with say to them I'm letting it go if they've got the right Spirit the one you're trying to portray they'll let you let it go if they don't you're back to square one with them that's when you have to make up your mind it has now become her issue it has now become his issue because I'm not going to let the sun go down and I'm not laying down in the bed mad with wrath with raw emotion I'm going to let it go uh there's so much that could be said about that it's actually the reason why why God designed the new day to begin at Sunset instead of Sunrise the Gregorian calendar and the manner in which you and I keep time is sunrise signals to us the new day or at midnight but that's not the Hebrew way the Bible Way is and the evening and the morning that was the first day the evening and the morning was the second day the evening and the morning which means the day changes as the Sun is setting on the old day tonight it's sundown in God's mind a new day has begun it's Monday anybody following me this is too practical for intellectuals but it is right on time for somebody that hasn't yet learned how to operate to deal to control to bring under the blood their own feelings and emotions if you'll do it daily you take that moment to ask for God's forgiveness for how you misbehaved through the day you should every day it's not about getting saved again it's about keeping all the dead cats off the line do you believe what we say and do can hinder our prayers it can hinder our blessing it can hinder God's favor in our lives so we want to get that taken care of why not look at God's practical advice and do it before the sun goes down that's a new day you tell yourself I'm going to bed in the beginning of a new day and when I wake up in the morning what I went through what I walked with what I dealt with what I said what was said to me it's gone tomorrow is a new day and just tell yourself that somebody said well it's a lot to tell myself well we talk to oursel all the time we don't always do it verbally but in our mind we're talking so say something good to yourself I'm not carrying this into the next day Jesus has Set Me Free I don't know how it's going to be worked out in the natural but in the spiritual it's settled I'm not carrying it you know we're so stubborn Amen brother we we're so stubborn I'm not going to let it go until he apologizes until she apologizes say Well it may be a chilly day and you know where before he apologizes or she apologizes you don't wait on them somebody said you know you just sound like you always got it you're just pretending like you always got it right I have not and I don't but I follow these practical guidelines the best I can so that I don't carry it into the new day if you carry your anger your resentment your bitterness your agitation into another day it gets bigger and what will happen and I know that you're going to just blow me out of the pull pit with an amen when I say this but what will happen is you will take it out on somebody else that has nothing to do with it and when you're called out you'll say well I I'm just going through something let me give you this good piece of help here everybody everybody is going through something tailor made tailor made by a God who knows exactly what it's going to take for you to run the race that you're called to run and get through that Finish Line I've seen some of you finishing and I know you will it's my job to keep pushing you to encourage you correct and train you but I know I've already seen some of you through the Finish Line I'm telling you when you get that in your knower when you get that in your knower and You by the spirit can sense the I don't know if it's called a Ribbon or or or what it's called but that finish line that you break when you get some uh spiritual uh knowing that that finish line is going to break across your chest because everything you need to overcome has been given to you by the revealed word of the hour you've just got to take that and figure out how to apply it in your personal life but you've already had a sense I am an overcomer when I talk to people about overcoming these kinds of things without a doubt just about at least 99% of them mentioned I did it by my confession I did it by speaking God's word over my life and over the situation I did it by a positive biblical affirmation and an affirmation is an amen if I say uh I'm going to make a positive affirmation I am an overcomer I'm saying Amen to every scripture that says I can little children I right under you that you overcome how do I know you can Jesus is saying because I did I can say I can because Jesus did and he says I can he says I have Oh you mean I got to talk to my like I said you do it all the time anyway oh that sounds like psychology I know that's what people think when they read in the Bible that we should meditate on the word they immediately think about Eastern Transcendental Meditation it doesn't mean that it means Ponder stir stew on it Med keep it on your heart and in your mind and in your mouth so that when the enemy lies you've got ammunition I don't even know what somebody might say I don't even know what off fence is good I'm going to show you real quickly again the list of the synonyms for offense and then we're going to move into the characteristics and strongholds because I I I know that it can help us if we let it annoyance there's a reason for your annoyance anger resentment indignation letting you read the next one irritation exasperation wrath displeasure disapproval dislike hard bad ill feelings disgruntlement animosity vexation aversion I have an aversion to that person opposition and enmity all synonyms of the word offense so when you think I've never been offended by what was said or done to me just remember that if you were irritated how many times did that happen to you yesterday how many times has that happened this morning how many times has that happened in this service already that you felt irritated there's a root there's something there that you need I need to discover the reason why I react that way write it down figure it out see if it it's more often a particular person see if it's more often a particular kind of situation see if it's when you begin to feel a certain way already and then that offense starts building or something begins to build see if it has an old root see if it is somehow connected to your past the reality is if we are shutting down the kingdom by our feelings and our emotions and the spirits that we entertain I got to get I got to get that sorted out I want the kingdom how many of you want to sing every day Glory Glory Hallelujah the Kingdom's marching on the truth is marching on I don't want to be giving my life for the kingdom and then shutting it down with my own irritability my own animosity you see sometimes the reality is it's rooted in Pride because we want everybody to think like we think you'd be surprised how many times I have to consciously remind myself sometimes say out loud to myself it's not right for me to expect him or her those are the only two right him or her it's not right for me to expect them to think like I think all the time because remember we're all running a race and they are processing through their filters I'm processing through my filters and we always want to hold everybody accountable as though they think like we think raised like we were raised deal with things like we deal with the you you know what we would be we would be plastic copies of one another if that was life if you compare your marriage to somebody else's marriage it's hardly ever going to measure up relationships are not going to be the same we are jealous sometime for relationships that we observe but that we're not a part of and you know that's really something that can really hold us back and cause us to live a kind of swirl in in offense you need to recognize now that you're not going to have the same kind of relationship with Joe Oh I thought I was picking a name that nobody had but we do have a Joseph let's just say Joe that's not you you're Joe Joe and we're talking about Joe one Joe single Joe everybody's not going to have the same relationship with Joe could be because Joe likes college football and you may not and and that doesn't mean you can't be friends but it means that your connection with Joe is not going to look like somebody else's connection with Joe and you know what brother that's all right and when Joe has wings hot wings you you know what I'm talking about no don't you they're they don't really belong to a buffalo they're chicken wings when Joe has chicken wings he may not invite you because when he thinks of chicken wings he thinks of college football and so he thinks of the other Feller who enjoys college football oh it's quiet I wish You' just preach the word mhm I I imagine you do when we say spirit of offense we're describing a condition where a person is sometimes trapped they they don't want to be in there they don't want to be in that place but sometimes they do most of the time they don't but they're also not taking into consideration practical biblical help when it's available some people are afraid of change I I I I don't want to say afraid of change but uh how many of you would say I don't really like change I'm not a person who really likes change let me see your hand let me let let me let me do it this way let me see the hand of somebody that loves and Embraces change when it comes oh wow well I live with one of them and I'm not quite so sure I think in order to get to the root of those few hands of course there I know I saw that Martha and and U Wesley they they and that's in fam so I kind of get that but I think it would depend on the definition of change and what kind of change now I know one thing about sister Martha is she is a flexible person so I would vote for her in that direction but I suppose that I could set in motion a change that she might not embrace you get it so it's not a a black and white answer most of us do not really like change a and here's how that can affect us in a very negative way we start building our identity around our routine around our comfort zone that means we're not flexible like sister Martha and when we're not flexible and we don't like anything that changes our routine or our schedule we sometimes hold on to our favorite definition of Who We Are so the preacher preaches doesn't matter what he says doesn't matter how the Lord moves doesn't matter how it makes sense we hold on to our favorite definition of who we are and we fear what we would be if we no longer walked with the limp because of offense but I want you to know something God knows right now exactly what you would look like smell like live like talk like drive your car like if you were rid of that stuff and I believe if we ask him he would choose that version a a a version of freedom and deliverance a version where you don't take it out on somebody else when they have nothing to do with the offense that you're carrying a version where you're not doing anything thinking anything talking anything that impede s or paralyzes the kingdom but rather your lifestyle is advancing the kingdom directive of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords in order to do that in order to let go in order to uh to Hope and build new relationships because we also build our relationships around who we are emotionally comfortable with which usually means the person who will not challenge us you know in a prayer line I hope you're listening in a prayer line brother brandom bow your head close your eyes when this Spirit comes out it's going somewhere you want to be reverent you want to be there in faith how many times did we hear him say wait a minute what is that paraphrasing a bit but you'll remember the points he said my there's a Spirit back there calling out to a spirit over here for help you know we do the same thing we have a tendency to gravitate toward people who carry what we carry we should if it's a healthy holy spiritual DNA but if it's a spirit of isol ation or false definition because somebody told us we were an introvert and we believed it somebody told us what color we are or what our anagram was or whatever you call all of that and and we believed it and we settle for it and we defined ourselves that way and when we do that then we then we hold on to the things that are negative as well as the things that are positive and God said you're a new creature I don't care how how your mother had a tendency to have her feelings hurt all the time you don't have to walk in that she did because of who she is I'm not my mother you're not your mama you're not your daddy they may have been outstanding and wonderful people but we don't only inherit they're good sometimes we we get the bad too so what do we do accept it and there's no way around it absolutely not I want to divide what we're going to be talking about in the next uh little while on uh the characteristics and strongholds of offense I want to divide it into three categories if you will uh put them up there are three umbrella categories when we are looking at the characteristics of someone dealing with the spirit of offense and we will also look at strongholds that are built because of holding on to Old offense and we'll look at partnering spirits that run in and take advantage and boy if you could catch a glimpse of that it would make you uh hot red mad that the enemy is always ready to take advantage of your most vulnerable spot so you got to get that healed up so that he doesn't know how many of you'd like to strike a little confusion in the camp of the enemy because he gets inter rut just like everybody else does and he keeps trying the same old thing and one day when he comes to you with the same thing that he's run you all over town with in the past and you don't take the bait you will send a confusion through the ranks of hell they won't know what to do with you the Bible gives us this idea in Hebrew that when the chofar sounds it scatters demonic principalities and Powers your life surrendered to what God wants to make you will send a confusion through the enemy that just ripples I want him confused I want him to be looking for something because what he used to use doesn't work anymore greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world are you still with me the the self centered nature of offense selfish and unselfish alike can get offended this is not a blanket to say if you ever had your feelings hurt it's because you're self-centered that's just absolutely not accurate it's not true and that's not in any way the message I want you to take home but what I do want you to see is that sometimes instead of letting a fence just heal giving it to the Lord marching on in the spirit we nurture it we identify with it and we do that not because we are hurt we do it because we're looking out for ourself we we may look dumb but we're not dumb what I mean by that is nobody wants to see that kind of a wound repeated so we start putting up walls we go into isolation we separate ourselves from the body we separate ourselves from the lifeline which is the Living Vine amen that is a defense mechanism that's the way we most definitely like to look at it but the reality is sometimes that's another Spirit rushing in to cause us to be stuck in in it's all about [Music] me it's all about me let me give you a small example let me say before I do it's not all about [Music] me so let me say it's it's it's not all about you it's not always what you do that offends somebody you understand for instance um our boys are not the only boys that have ever had a car accident or girls I never dreamed that by celebrating God's grace over their lives and inadvertently others celebrating God's grace people all over the world every year when I share the memory comment they say I remember this I I I always remember this road truck I always remember uh what you said about them notes from the prayer meetings quotes of brother brandham about the mind being in the car and them crawling out over those quotes to get out of the vehicle the guy who came and cut the seat belt uh and then seemed to be gone just off into the crowd somewhere not knowing exactly where he went all of the detail uh uh when the when they finally reached me and I started in that direction Haw was here and I asked to go with me and we I prayed in tongues from here to the highway and I knew that God was moving I knew it but I I wasn't ready to quit praying yet how many of you understand that don't Lo don't don't be lost in this stay with me please and and so we saw God move and they were wanting to call an ambulance well the boys didn't want to go in the ambulance so we get in the vehicle and we go to the emergency room just to have them checked out because that was suggested because of the role and we get down there and I get royally chewed out by a doctor who said what a poor parent I was because I didn't allow them to be taken by ambulance not to this hospital he said they should have been taken immediately to a trauma center and properly evaluated and if you remember any of the testimony before it was over he sort of apologized for his behavior and he said I can see that you have an incredibly strong bond with your sons I Just sh shared it I just shared the story again and again and again and again because it's my story to share I didn't know that that that someone was offended by that because although I rushed to the scene when their family was in an accident followed this through I rushed I was there I I was concerned I cared there was no rolling of the car there was no real damage to the family thanks be to God but I was there I helped relatives I did anything I could I seems to me like I may have held a dog which is not something I normally would do but I did what I would know to do there's many of you that have had accidents that I didn't rush to the scene you understand don't you but I prayed and I cared I didn't know that every time I told that and every time you mentioned it and every time the memory showed up on social media that I was upsetting that person more and more and more because I'm made over it's not about you it wasn't about me I didn't know that I was shoving that in anybody's face I thought I was giving God glory for it it never occurred to me that by celebrating what God had done for my family I I was you see when I say we're going to have a testimony service I I'm expecting you to give your testimony I'm sorry but I get a little more time to talk than you do when you come to church I I know that is kind of not stacked in your favor but if there's a testimony service and you don't get up and tell it that's not my fault but when it comes to my mind I'm going to tell I am I am going to tell what the Lord has done so even though it wasn't my fault even though my intention was only to to give God praise somebody was offended already at me see and every time I praised God for what he had done it was driving that wound that offense deeper and deeper and deeper not because of what I was saying because of what the enemy was saying blah blah blah it's always about your family see that wasn't me saying that that wasn't even the person saying that that was the enemy and he does a good job let's don't lift him up but he does a good job and one offense compounds on another offense it compounds and how do you finally find out that you're because one day somebody finally blurts it out and you might not be like me but my reaction is not always oh I see oh my wow oh my goodness I understand this is a Eureka moment it's really quiet this is a Eureka moment for me how I had no idea that every time I give God praise I was driving a dagger deep down in your heart so oh my I repent and apologize and and I'll never give God praise pleas I don't always react that way sometimes someone else's offense to you can sound oh foolish Petty but I promise you yours mind never sounds Petty to me I can't get mad at you if you don't react the same way do to my hurt and you can't get mad at me if in fact I just said wow oh my and that wasn't right that wasn't enough but it was all I could do at the moment it was like opening up a window and looking in and seeing that a situation had gotten so bad that even in a moment where there was no ill intent at all that bitterness that resentment that wound starts with a wound had fased so that everything that was said or done by the by the offender seemed like a personal attack or a personal death are going deeper have you ever been there that's the moment that you and I have to realize it's not all about us it may not be that you have done it on purpose you may have and if you if you have you've got to make that right with God and man but you can't carry something that's not yours to carry sometimes the characteristics and strongholds of offense are rooted in a deeper issue in the self centered nature of offense this is how it behaves easily provoked prideful Behavior self focus I've been there I know how this works number two the stronghold of bitterness the characteristics of an offense that has multiplied into bitterness has its own set of characteristics bitterness holding grudges unforgiveness and then there is another subcategory and that is characteristics or behaviors that would fall under the heading of divisive effects of offense and here they are isolation misinterpretation gossip division now when I made that list I knew that some people would question the first characteristic how is it that isolation is divisive you're sending a message of division see and we' we've we've all we've all played that little game before whether it was a invite to dinner or a string of services missed or whatever it was we often use it for an excuse of taking care of you know Personal Care is such a big issue and one's own mental health is so important and we often say things like I'm just taking some time for me and I understand the need for that kind of a thing but we should make sure that we're not moving in divisiveness when we're trying to take care of our selves you see the answer is yes you are your brother's keeper that's the answer and when we isolate ourselves because our our wound or we have been offended or hurt it it usually Roots back to the pride to the self focus because we're looking after ourself and we're forgetting forgetting about other people you know it's like it's like people saying let me see if I can let me see if I can stir this up even more it's like you you must really enjoy this not at all in fact I was thinking that I would say to brother gley I almost said it to him this morning lately I am enjoying studying more than preaching why don't you and I tag team I'll do the studying and you preach the notes because the delivery is not the part I enjoy well thank you so so much I wasn't fishing for a compliment I think that's that was your way of renigging on the on the arrangement so we we don't want to be we don't want to fall into any of these categories of self-nature self-centered nature of offense the stronghold of bitterness the divisive effects of offense because none of that is the kind of behavior that you and I want amen I mean that I know that you you've got to understand this I believe I can say this with a wide sweep you don't want this so I don't want you to feel like you've become the the target I'm preaching this to expose it not to break you down and cause you to think that this is who you are this is not who are this is what the enemy tries to do to it he tries to paint us and it works because we listen come on I'm a new creature I'm a new creation I don't have to be what I was yesterday if I don't want to be because his mercies are new Every Morning his grace is alog together sufficient come on so now we move on characteristics of the spirit of offense it's partnering Spirits understanding how the spirit of offense operates a and the spirits that often accompany uh offense is for me I believe it's crucial for spiritual warfare for understanding who the enemy is I could go into a a long uh maybe Rabbit Trail here by reminding you I'll do it most briefly that we're not fighting one another you know if if that was the case then you go your way I go my way and I'm a new man and you're a new man right I mean that would seem to make sense but this is not flesh and blood this is about spiritual war it's about principalities and powers and darkness even in high places th this is about a war from Hell against you brother brandom is the one who put the focus on it he's the one who said the last battle yes sir sir is the Battle of the mind it's fought on the Battlefield of the Mind that's good it's not bad it's good because you own the battlefield come on you possess it you've got Authority in it your name is on the deed of this we are taking his mind while slowly losing ours the Apostle Paul didn't want it to be that way he wanted us to be able to lose ours and take Christ's but we understand that as the wickedness of every age compounded that we are now in a greater battle than the one the church in Ephesus fought that's why we don't believe that healing stopped and miracles stopped and Gifts stopped once we got to the end of this thing that's why we're not cessationists because we actually believe that although their circumstances seem harder to us the reality is the spirit of the age grew darker and darker and darker Wicked compounded itself and the days the scripture said become increasingly evil so even though now we're not facing Nero and the and and being burned at the stake and killed for our faith even though we're not dealing with the the Dark Ages we're actually fighting a greater battle in this hour than has ever been fought before but here's the good news you own the battlefield the enemy is a trespasser here it's really here but you know if you're thinking mind you're going to think here your mind doesn't live in your brain you know that don't you your mind lives in your heart not the pump but the seat of emotions did you know there's another part of your body that's also identified with your emotions and that's your kidney or your bowels there's a whole scripture study wow is it a good one not time for it today but it talks about the bowels of Christ he we're not talking about his intestines or his colon we're talking about a place where we could say the base nature of a person dwells that's why the anointing often draws from the lower quadrant of the body the stomach or the kidneys is because there's a whole lot you're holding on to that's affecting your physical body brother Brandon began to understand it before brain science I mentioned the other day that brother Brandon was ahead of his time in a lot of things and one of them was brain science can you imagine a grammar school education and the Brain scientists were saying that you are stuck with the brain you're born with meaning there is no no way to change the brain you're born with brother brandham knew better than that he began to talk about it they must have thought he was pretty crazy too and then later brain science caught up and they began to call it neuroplasticity which means it doesn't matter the brain you're born with you have the ability by the design of the Creator to challenge and improve the brain that you have that that's pretty incredible and may I just mention to you that Big Max and french fries that never need Refrigeration you can come back and get them 10 years later and they look about the same because they were never living in was quiet I'm sorry president Trump they were never living in the first place but it's just quick you know to run through there may I just tell you that Quarter Pounders and that will not improve so we are are faced with the decision there's also a way to transform your brain by the way you think even though your thinking doesn't originate up here it originates down here brain scientists secular brain scientists are now saying that you have the ability to replenish brain cells that have been damaged or lost by thinking a different way imagine that imagine that my thoughts can physically transform a real organ in my body no wonder the scripture says we are fearfully and what wonderfully made if I own the battlefield then I have a authority over the Rules of Engagement do you understand under past administrations in the US government The Rules of Engagement have not only changed in the Army but they've changed in many different areas of life for instance when you and I were growing up if someone went into a department store and grabbed an arm full of clothes they were risking their lives they could have been shot The Rules of Engagement were different then if not shot definitely tackled in my lifetime I I've seen them drug parisians years ago Peach Tree Mall I don't go anymore course you don't go to pan just gone I saw a young man grab a stack of clothes hundreds of dollars worth of clothes run out the door and I saw a Salesman that I knew a salesperson that I knew chase him to the park parking lot not to get the clothes to get him tackled him to the ground drag him by one foot through the parking lot up the curb that was fun into the store and said hold out your hands he was not a security guard he was a salesperson somebody brought him handcuffs not anymore when I was in Pennsylvania at the wedding of Amy and whatever her man's name is what is it Justin we were in a mall there one day and someone stole something and ran out the door and a woman who worked there chased him calling out to him please don't do this please don't do this and she came back in and I was ready to check out and I overheard her being thoroughly chewed out she said you have broken policy you are told to turn your head and not say a word The Rules of Engagement have changed and that's why people can break through the windows of the store take things out and the security guard his gun is never drawn he never blows a whistle he never raises his voice because the Rules of Engagement have changed well let me tell you something there they haven't only changed in the natural they the the enemy has tried to change them on this last battlefield but you own it he he uses tricks that he would have never successfully used a generation ago because Faith was stronger and the Word was preached straighter things that trip people and uh uh uh handicap people spiritually now would have never even caused them to have a Second Glance because they would but the Rules of Engagement have changed the enemy has changed his technique in the sense that he gets more personal and he bombards us from external stimuli and then he bombards us from our inner thought life but you own the battlefield I want you to say it I own the battlefield this doesn't belong to SA Satan the seed of my emotions my mind my brain my heart my my my kidneys and my intestines if you want to say it that way liver too in every gland it's all God's he's the Creator he's given me authority over this piece of real estate that's why we're praying as it is in heaven so let it be in Earth because you're the Earth we came from dirt originally remember and so we want to see God's will established what what his mind in heaven is we want to see that happening not only around us but in us come on and so you have authority you not only have authority over this battlefield up here you you have power I know message Believers are afraid to talk about power some of them because brother brandham said it's not more power you need it's Authority and vice versa he said other other things putting the emphasis on power but let's just balance it out it doesn't do you any good to have power if you don't have the authority to use it doesn't do you any good to have authority if you you don't have something to back it up it wasn't just a badge we like using that example but it wasn't just a bad we're living in a different hour today you don't think somebody's going to stop because somebody flashes them a badge do you in this society that would be an invitation run them over can you imagine a policeman standing out in the middle of the road with a badge on telling people to stop you would stop I would stop but there's somebody three cars back from you that would hate blue defund the blue and they would just run them over the Rules of Engagement have changed but the reality is you have both power and authority and if it touches this you have authority over it so you get to decide whether a thought stays or goes whether a hurt stays or goes whether a wound stays or goes you I don't have authority over you I can beg you to let it go but I can't I can't force you or make you or Mo you you have I you can tell me oh Shake It Off don't let it bother you see but only I can make the decision I banish you you you you lie of hell I won't entertain that anymore and I won't let it affect all of my relationships is it is it isn't it a shame that one bad relationship in your life can negatively affect every relationship you have because suddenly the boss looks like your girlfriend everybody around you looks like the person you've got the biggest problem with and you lose reality and you just start living out of that place God give us strength okay number one and we're and we're just going to hit this a little bit and go the first characteristic is I have it labeled as a instead of number one easily provoked and quick to anger partnering with the spirit of anger we're talking about characteristics or behaviors of someone who is under the influence of a spirit of offense they are easily provoked can I simplify the definition Moody the moodiest people are the people that are the most easily provoked that's the voice of experience speaking I have a lot of authority to say that because I've experienced it people that are easily provoked often have to deal with a [Music] wound but the normal reaction to a Christian of being wounded would not be anger crushed might be a better word when anger shows up it's generally because it's a deeper problem are you here it's 115 it's early it's early it's usually because there's a deeper problem well let's just see what the Bible says Proverbs 14:17 he that is soon angry dealth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated I know that we all get that we all fully understand what that says he that is soon angry dealth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated I know we all get that but for those who perhaps don't let's look just a little bit closer at the wording because I don't think most people walk away from that verse knowing exactly what it means to deal foolishly because you're angry quickly or what Wicked devices are the man of wicked devices is hated what are wicked devices well we can we can assume and guess and sometimes we can come up with some good things but look at what these words would say if we were looking at it in the original he who Foams up that's that's the Hebrew word that is used there the foaming up of emotion he who Foams up quickly I like it and flies into a passion deals foolishly and a man of wicked plots plans schemes is hated have you ever foamed up quickly thank you Jonathan for helping with your amens they mean a lot we're just being real foamed up quickly flies into a passion makes therefore foolish decisions dumb decisions says dumb things sometimes religious dumb things anybody with me not because he's dumb because he's a person person who has an issue with woundedness offense and and anger those operating under a spirit of offense I think you may have this you may not are easily irritated and most often take things I I I think I'm not satisfied with your reaction so I think I'm going to ask those of you who will to read it together with me slowly those operating under a spirit of offense are easily irritated and most often take things very personally the spirit of offense often manifests as a quick temper you think that someone just has a an anger issue in reality it can be that the anger is a partnering devil who comes in uh to cause you to foam up quickly so that you make foolish decisions when the root of the whole thing is not anger it's not a lack of discerning wisdom it's offense it's woundedness so even if you start working on the anger seeing some help with your anger issue maybe going to class which is not a bad idea for some folks to learn how not to get so angry so quickly it may not fix the problem because it can be that the root of it all is a woundedness that you have carried throughout your life there is a bomb there is a bomb in Gilead there is healing for your hurt and your wound there's healing you may not get the apology you're looking for the one who you would desire to hear it from may have already passed from this life you may never get that but as a Believer you have the grace and the ability to let God come in and not need the physical word I'm sorry some counselors who see the seriousness of these issues have started using a therapy that goes something like this you are pouring out your heart to a a counselor a trained professional and they turn what you say around sort of like this I want you to know that I am truly sorry that you had to face that just words from someone who only knows what you told them that's all they don't know the whole story they just know the Gory detail that you vult you know you you uncovered yourself and you told this raw emotion to a stranger that you are paying and they just simply say to you I am so sorry no one should have to be treated that way no one should ever hear those words spoken about them from someone who loves them and I'm very very sorry that you feel that way what do you think about that kind of therapy well some of you might say that's just mumbo jumbo and that's not going to be successful and that's not going to help help anybody but guess what the research says that it is unbelievably successful it's not the apology that you were looking for from the person who wounded you but it's an apology from someone who seems to care who seems to be sincere and it's just hearing the words I'm so sorry you had to go through that and all of a sudden it kind of opens up something for some folks they relive a few moments of that pain and they I'm sorry men they cry it out usually they just cry it out they just let all that pent up emotion out and they move from that con uh conversation Freer it it wasn't what they thought was going to it didn't fix everything but it said somebody understands how I feel now remember they don't know if that's just your version they don't know if you're telling the reality or if you've exaggerated the story all they know is they're they're paid to help you so they're looking for some way to help you and so they take on the role of the offender you you don't necessarily have have to pay somebody to to do that Jesus said the Bible tells us first we have a high priest who's touched I'm so sorry that I've boring some of you it's not my intention we have a high priest who is deeply touched by the feelings of our infirmities that's not just your sorto or your high blood pressure that word infirmity can mean anything that is a skew anything that is off balance in your life Jesus is touched I don't know if that counselor's touched or not but I know that he has studied and learned some way of saying something that kind of helps you to feel like at least for the moment that somebody cares but look folks the reality and if you need that get it do I encourage you to get it if you need it but everybody can't afford that everybody it's not available to every person but I want you to know there is somebody there is a friend that Stith closer than a brother you know that counselor is only going to know what you tell them but I know something somebody who knows all the stuff you didn't tell the stuff you can't face to tell the stuff you don't want nobody to know he already knows it and is touched but if you're spilling your your innards to somebody and they were to pause and say Let me let me tell you something Jesus knows and can cares he feels your pain it might not have the same effect do you know why because we religiously know that and it hasn't become a reality so it's it's just words from a stranger you are the only one who can believe those words you own this real estate and you're the only one who can choose to say I have a high priest who is touched by every one of my feelings my legitimate ones and my ignorant ones just call yourself out some of them are real and some of them may not be but I have a counselor a high priest A Healer a savior a deliverer I don't have to drive to his office I don't have to book an appointment I don't have to claim my insurance and I don't have to write him a check all I have to do is surrender my will your Council your high Prest your friend he lives on board come on he sits on the throne of your life if you've given him that place and he cares and he hears and he know well why hasn't he already done something about it I love when someone is praying and they sayl we give you permission because there's a religious spirit that responds I feel it I always have wherever I am there is a religious spirit that always responds to that line of thinking but it's right and it is real he is a gentleman and he will knock that's right after all the Book of Revelation tells us he's standing at the door of his own church knocking wanting to get in you have authority you and I our faith our belief Our Hope in the moment is what makes us available to him so to say Lord I Give You full sway I give you permission to be the high priest I want you to feel what I feel and I want you to help me to be healed and whole so that I don't ever feel that way again I challenge you not to try to decide what is a legitimate feeling and what is an illegal one that you've picked up along the way I challenge you instead of trying to sort them give them all give them all we used to sing that song give them all Shattered Dreams wounded Hearts who knows the next line and broken toys we've sung that in church broken toys I I get Shattered Dreams and broken heart and wounded Hearts but Broken Toy he is a high priest touched by the feeling of our infirmities I've lost a balloon I remember how it felt and you should have seen me how foolishly I acted to make sure that my children didn't lose one I've walked around all day with one tied to my arm so they could have it later because I remember exactly what it feels like as a child did you know there is most likely some stuff rolling around down in there oh it gets so you're I know I know folks are too super spiritual for this I I I'm I'm I'm preaching this to uh you know the children they're not so advanced they they I remember I remember growing up with this idea if I and I've said this before I'm not making this up along the way if I love it I'm going to lose it so I've got to be careful about loving it now as an adult I know you don't love things you should like things and love people but as a kid I loved my my dog now I'm old enough to know I I can be affectionately uh attached and I can call it love but it's not the same kind of love it's I I don't want you to get mad but it's not the same degree of love you have for your children I hope it it's different I know it's huge I know it's big I'm not trying to diminish that I I remember having a Nerf football as a kid and a and a new puppy and and anybody ought to know a new puppy and a Nerf football they don't go well together and I remember having to make a decision well I still love this puppy because he's destroyed my Nerf football my mom remarried and she married a man with issues too numerous to name he abused her seriously physically emotionally mentally and he took his anger out on anything or anyone who got in his way and he would be perfectly fine One Moment One Moment my dad really the same way one moment perfectly whole and fine and the next moment in a complete rage I had decided I would keep loving that dog and he went into a rage one day and and picked that dog up and threw it across the room not mad at me not mad at my mom I I almost cried just then see broke broke broke its bones I never saw the dog again we can think about those things and it can affect us but I know who lives here he cares about wounded Hearts Shattered Dreams and what else broken toys he cares he cares I know that children are children and I know that they can be unreasonable at times because they're not Advanced enough to reason something out and I know that we get frustrated when we tell them something and they don't understand it because we forget we forget how many times we had to be told the same thing before it registered and the reality is some of us had parents who knew how to discipline and yet we broke the rule anyway knowing there would be a punishment so if you think that just whippings will fix the issue it doesn't necessarily fix the problem it's important the Bible said so the SP in of the rod is is an unchristian unbiblical concept time out in the corner and all of that if it works okay but let's remember the scripture says if you spare the rod the scripture says hate it means you're not caring for that child's future but a spanking without an explanation is a waste of your time a child never responds to a physical without an explanation now why are you getting why why why do you deserve this banking what what's the reason why uh uh you're you're being disciplined this way and of course the answers are going to vary as a child gets older and we've got some philosophers around here when I hear some of the things these kids say to their parents I think oh my goodness they're little Geniuses walking around it doesn't take them long to learn how to uh manipulate their way right out of a situation I'm the one who put the chaita banana sticker on my forehead under my bangs and my mother said I'm going to whip you and I and I and I I don't know if I did it consciously or not but I was playing with it and I put it on my forehead head my my mother insisted on me having a a a bowl cut with bangs as a little boy and she sends me into the room and she's going to lay into me and I'm telling you my mama could she was going to lay into me and as I went to uh lean over the bed my bang slid and the chaita banana sticker showed and she burst into tears laughter and then into tears laughing so hard I don't even think it's funny but she did Hallelujah she did then she explained to me you still deserve the the spanking but I wasn't going to swing the belt while I was laughing because you need to understand what you were doing hurt my heart so I'm not going to laugh at it laugh at you and then spank you the reality is I know this is getting long the reality is we carry some of these things on a cellular level that's what brain science tells us and you have somebody who care he cares about all of it you don't have to go find him or pay him all you have to do is believe him you just have to trust him I just don't believe he cares about all these little things that that that that I think about all the time you you don't understand he does you're an extension of him you are a part of him even if your if your feeling is really something that you've just sort of made he cares he wants us thinking healthy and whole and he doesn't want us overreacting or under reacting he doesn't want us judging one another's motives he wants us to be free how many of you know it's like a burden lifted if if you ever come to a place that you can let anger go over a situation that you've been holding on to it feels like a ton of bricks has been lifted can you imagine the weight of all of my sin your sin The Whole World's sin pressed upon him as he died on the cross bearing my sin he that knew no sin carried mine and yours he knows what it means to be heavy he knows what it means to carry something that didn't belong to him he understands he cares if you foam up quickly you're going to do foolish things you're going to take things personally 139 I'm closing musicians are coming you're going to take things personally that aren't meant for you it's not about you the Huddle on the football field is not about you they're not plotting your destruction they're plotting the other team's destruction and sometimes it does them no good we're so bad at times that if we walk up and someone stops talking we know not assume we know they had to be talking about us I want everybody to hold still just a minute I want you to hear this we know they must have been talking about us let me let me give you some cold hard reality some things are simply none of your business you got to come to that reality It Ain't Easy for somebody like me to come to that reality because I'm nosy by nature and I'm willing to be transparent about it so that would be a a real foolish assumption it may just be that the details of that conversation are not meant for me it might be my surprise it might be my present they're talking about and they hush because they didn't want me to hear what they were going to buy me but my mind and my experience and my hurt and and what I've been through in life tells me that they were talking about me or somebody in my family and so what do I do I react what do you do you react oh yes you do you don't always react to the person's involved but before the day's out sometime we tell sister Sharon or sister Joyce or whoever else will listen sister Martha's flexible I don't know if she listens to that kind of stuff or not now I want you to know what can those ladies do about something that had nothing to do with them now that's what you call carrying an offense if it didn't matter you wouldn't have told it to somebody else you would have told you would have said to the oh you girl you girls I walked up you hushed I thought you were talking about me and they might they might say we were they might say no it wasn't about you but we we just want to keep this pretty quiet you can't be offended at that everybody needs somebody to talk to I get all of that but you need to understand that if you're carrying an offense and you don't dump it on somebody else when the scripture never tells us to handle it that way you may be transferring your offense there's a lot of people carrying something that has nothing to do with them oh my I hope you paid your tithes or else you are getting a lot of free therapy today I hope it's biblically based I think and feel that it's biblically based I think it's bigger Among Us than we realize I know you think I'm spending too much time but I really believe that it's more important than what we realize so important that he called it the last battle and if we can win that battle we've won the victory Crown Hallelujah we've won the victory Crown let let me give you one quotation for for for the purists there are so many but I didn't get to them script to the scriptures either but let me give you this one the resurrection of Jesus and if you notice it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil sounds to me like brother bam knew about it it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you if you come to the church and say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll ever get any better or not I've been prayed for twice brother Shelly prayed twice as long for her Oh my he said you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that God help me somebody say God help me when you can cast that aside God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be you can't put on happiness that's be phony but you've got a lot to be happy about the human heart was made to be happy you that's not just an off-handed comment that's science again it's not all evil some of it is confirming the scripture worry will let me have a little water we're done worry will cause cancer that's a thought it's not just an emotion worry is based on a thought don't know to go I don't know what I'm going to do did you know you actually don't help your family 1 ounce by worrying over them you only help them by praying for them and being there for them all that hand ringing it it it's going to cost early arthritis don't do it only god listen we Face situations in our families that only God can move help fix save deliver amen and and just because I ask you to pray doesn't mean I'm worried that's not what I'm say but I'm talking about all those uh moments that we sit and we ruminate and we worry and we're concerned and what's going to come of them when I'm gone and who's going to pray for them then and and what's going to happen then that is not helping them your faith is what's going to help them the most somebody standing before God and interceding on their behalf and calling their names before the Lord that's what's going to make a difference let me tell you what's going to make a bigger difference than that you and I getting rid of all that we carry that is stopping the advancement of the Kingdom our prayers are affected by what we carry woundedness that we won't let go of can hinder our prayers anger that we won't seek deliverance from can hinder what how we pray no wonder we're worried because we can't have confidence in our own prayer because we know what we carry and we refuse to turn it loose brother brandham said worry will cause cancer temper temp let's all say temper that's another way of saying angry temper will cause cancer what is cancer it's a deformity of the cell it starts with a cell that is becomes deformed and that deformed cell multiplies and it generates another cell exactly like itself it was doing that before when it was a healthy cell it was multiplying out a healthy cell but now that that cell is not dead scientifically it'd be better if it would have really just died because you all have those kinds of cells we all have those kinds of sick cells in our body right now that's the reality they just die but if they make themselves again if they multiply then the next cell looks exactly like this unhealthy cell and the next thing you know the unhealthy cells are are are joining together and what makes a a a cell unhealthy it can be environment it can be food it can be genetics but more and more they're discovering that it can be thoughts what thoughts what you think what fills your heart will fill your mind it'll fill your mouth and it will affect the cells does it mean that every person who has cancer because it can be genetic it can be environmental there are so many factors that can cause there's so many kinds of cancer did you know that you can have breast cancer in your [Music] kidneys it's such a unbelievable reality but here a prophet is saying worry can cause a cell to be deformed and multiply itself as cancer temper can cause because that's what that's the root of it and he tells us that it is a spirit that there's a spirit behind cancer well what is worry it's unbelief anybody with me it's unbelief what's the only sin brother brandom told us there was everything else comes out of that unbelief so is that right does that make sense and temper someone thinking that a that that an angry spell a temper tantrum is going to fix anything slamming a door is going to fix anything hanging up on someone is going to fix anything how many of you know it doesn't fix anything and then here is I I'm not my my temper is not necessarily my problem sometimes I worry that's not my big problem but here's my problem don't never be upset never be upset I know this Prophet is not telling us to be [Music] phony what is he telling us don't ever be upset he's telling us to walk in peace Faith confidence come on don't let what happens to you affect you don't let it cause unbelief to inadvertently creep up in your life walk in his love somebody said I don't like all these modern worship songs all they talk about is his love it won't hurt you sweetheart to sing about his love if you you need to know much more about him I I can preach it to you but when you're worshiping him you ought to keep in mind his faithfulness his goodness his wonderful works and his love sing about his love because brother brandom tells us if we can walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him if you're walking in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can what there's neither Powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and I'll let you read the rest as you're standing and brought us into him who would have ever thought that being easily irritated or agitated can be connected to anger that finds a root in a fence it's Satan's way of turning something legitimate into something destructive you can't always help your feelings from getting hurt but you can make a conscious choice and a conscious decision not to let it partner with anger with agitation with irritation with frustration I'm preaching to myself you thought it's getting on to you no I'm preaching to myself I want the kind of peace why don't you listen over the course of the next couple weeks to the stature of a perfect man had I gotten to it we would have covered some of that and we will when we're together again hear it because there's only so much that we can do to help ourselves most of the time the best thing that we can do is give up and let Jesus Jesus if if you don't hear that in the stature of a perfect man you didn't listen to the end of the tape he tells it you got to have this virtue and to your virtue you got to have faith and to your faith you got to and then you got to have brother kind and then he tells us it's not about the doing it's about the yielding if you leave here because you think I've got more homework than I could ever sort through and I could never correct any of these things you're going to miss the point the point is this it's not what you do after you surrender that makes a difference it's staying surrendered I I don't know if you heard that I'm going to make sure you did it's about staying surrendered how how do you you just keep saying yes that little nudge this says you know you ought to go you ought to you ought to send that text you you you ought to smile you you ought to go hug somebody you ought to shake yield to that nudge just do it don't tell me tomorrow I almost said so so I almost do it do it do it don't wait till somebody called you and they say I was about to call you uhuh don't do that let that nudge be something that you begin to trust God's trying to work something out if you and I will let him isn't he faithful he's so so faithful let's just be quiet a moment before him just another minute thank you sweet sweet Lord Precious Jesus thank you thank you thank you that you thought we were worth saving thank you that you loved us so much you didn't want to leave us where we were you pulled us into something higher Lord thank you for unconditional Everlasting and eternal love thank you for being the Healer not only of the physical body but of the inner man thank you for helping us with our Shattered

the best thing I ever did when I took off that old robe and I let you put on a new robe the robe of your righteousness and Holiness and Purity you don't see us today as the flawed and broken people

Lord just to help you right now to know that you what you did yesterday letting him down the other day is not not how you meet him today if you just call on him he he he erases that he puts it under the blood he washes that away I'm he's looking at you new he's looking at you fresh he's looking at you whole he paid for your life he ransomed you he rescued you there only two people two entities
