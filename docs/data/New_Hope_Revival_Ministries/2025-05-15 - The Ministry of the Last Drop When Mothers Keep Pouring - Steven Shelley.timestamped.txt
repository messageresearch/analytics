[0:00] Amen. The last drop. The ministry of the
[0:04] last
[0:05] drop. When mothers pour from empty,
[0:10] when their tank is empty, when their
[0:14] supply is limited, the real heart of
[0:17] motherhood kicks in
[0:20] and they take from the little supply
[0:23] that they have. and they pour out and
[0:26] they pour out and they pour out and they
[0:28] pour out because reality is nobody can
[0:32] pour out in a home
[0:34] like a mother can. I want to say to
[0:37] every mother in this house and beyond.
[0:40] When you feel like you've given
[0:41] everything you have, when you feel like
[0:45] your tank is empty and you have
[0:47] absolutely nothing to give, don't you
[0:50] stop pouring because there's a God who's
[0:53] on board with you. There's a God in your
[0:57] life who'll meet you at the place of
[0:59] your dedication.
[1:02] Here I am, Lord. You know my nerves are
[1:05] frazzled. You know, my husband has put
[1:07] too much of this load on me.
[1:11] Let me tell you something. They You
[1:14] might be limited on what you can say to
[1:15] him, but you're not limited what you can
[1:17] say to the Lord. Tell the Lord on him.
[1:21] Come on.
[1:23] Somebody said, "I don't go along with
[1:24] that." You ought to tell the Lord
[1:26] everything. Just how you feel. I learned
[1:29] a long time ago. He understand. He may
[1:31] not agree with me, but he understands
[1:34] how I feel. He understands how I feel.
[1:38] Keep pouring, mama. Keep pouring. You
[1:41] may look down and it may look like
[1:42] there's not even a drop sliding off the
[1:45] end of the vessel into one of your
[1:47] children, but God is there to fan the
[1:49] flame. God is there to multiply the oil.
[1:52] God is there to bless your effort.
[1:57] Mamas, you may never feel full.
[2:02] You may never feel like you've got
[2:06] enough to give.
[2:11] Come on. But you've got more than you
[2:14] understand.
[2:16] Because there's somebody else living in
[2:18] your shoe leather. There's somebody else
[2:21] living on the inside of you. He'll meet
[2:23] you at your commitment. He'll meet you
[2:25] at your
[2:27] dedication. You lay those little babies
[2:30] up on the Lord's lap and say, "I can
[2:33] only do so much. I need your help with
[2:36] the rest." I want you to know he'll come
[2:38] swooping in faster than a Superman.
[2:42] He'll give you what you need if you let
[2:45] him. If you'll make King Jesus your
[2:48] first resource instead of your last
[2:51] resort,
[2:52] you'll keep pouring and pouring and
[2:55] pouring. And one of these days, those
[2:58] children who seemingly don't appreciate
[3:00] you enough now
[3:03] will come around and praise you and
[3:06] bless you because you poured into them
[3:10] when you felt like you had nothing.
[3:13] If you will recommmit and reconsecrate,
[3:16] sister your life, your motherhood, your
[3:20] service to your family, if you'll just
[3:22] keep saying, "Lord, I'm running low.
[3:26] I need some more oil. I need some more
[3:29] meal. I need some more strength to
[3:32] continue to do what you've called me to
[3:35] do." He'll meet you.
[3:37] He'll meet you at your point of need.
[3:40] Let the weak say,
[3:42] I'm going to be able.
[3:44] I am strong. I'm going to do what I've
[3:47] purposed in my heart because he is
[3:49] strong in me.
[3:52] Our vocabulary dictates
[3:55] a lot of circumstances in our lives. Do
[3:59] you believe that? Snared by the words of
[4:02] our mouth, we are the scripture said,
[4:04] "Mama,
[4:07] what do you have?
[4:10] You've stood around the altar Sunday
[4:12] after Sunday. You've told the Lord, "I'm
[4:14] empty. I need you to pass by. I'm
[4:17] discouraged. I need you to help me. My
[4:20] children in trouble. I need you to help
[4:21] me." You've told the Lord over and over
[4:23] again. Now, the word of the Lord is unto
[4:25] you today. He's asking you the question,
[4:27] "What is it in your house? What do you
[4:30] have? You've told me what you don't
[4:32] have. You don't have enough support. you
[4:35] don't have maybe enough support even
[4:37] from your husband, the father of your
[4:39] children. You you've told the Lord that
[4:42] now the Lord is asking what do you have?
[4:45] And I'm asking you
[4:47] mothers, what do you
[4:49] have? You may feel like you have
[4:52] nothing. No energy, no patience, no
[4:54] answers, but God works with your accept.
[4:59] Except a small part. God works with your
[5:01] accept. That tiny bit of faith, that
[5:03] last ounce of love, that small prayer, a
[5:07] small song, calling on the name of
[5:09] Jesus, speaking his name over your
[5:12] children. God will work with your
[5:15] except you're not enough is God's
[5:19] starting
[5:20] point. It's not his limitation.
[5:24] Can I tell you that what you need to
[5:25] save your children and bless your
[5:27] community is in your house? It's where
[5:30] God has placed you. It's where he puts
[5:34] you. It's where he's going to feed you.
[5:37] It's where he's going to sustain
[5:39] you. You tell the devil he's a liar.
