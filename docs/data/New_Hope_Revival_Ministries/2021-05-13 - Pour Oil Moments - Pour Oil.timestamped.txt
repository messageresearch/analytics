[0:00] there is a deliverance
[0:03] that the enemy cannot stop
[0:10] [Music]
[0:12] i'm telling you in the name of the lord
[0:14] pour oil on your children on your
[0:16] grandchildren on your neighbor
[0:18] fill up your home with the presence of
[0:21] god how can i do that
[0:22] you entertain him he'll come you invite
[0:25] him and entertain him
[0:26] you wash his feet you anoint his head
[0:29] he'll stay with you
[0:31] he will abide with you come on now
[0:34] you want to leave something behind you
[0:36] want to see your children freed
[0:38] you want to see your children delivered
[0:40] you want to see their bondage broken
[0:42] and their chains fall off poor oil
[0:46] you can pour out oil on their head
[0:49] and they can't stop you
[0:54] because if they won't receive it from
[0:56] your mouth you just get down
[0:58] on your knees and pour oil on their head
[1:02] if they reject you if they despise you
[1:06] if they misunderstand you if they pull
[1:08] away from you
[1:09] you just keep pouring oil on them
[1:12] when you pray they don't have a praise
[1:16] in them so you
[1:18] praise on their behalf they don't have a
[1:21] prayer in them so
[1:22] you pray on their behalf
[1:26] you do what god is calling you to do
[1:29] and you watch god do what he has
[1:32] promised
[1:33] to do your children will have to
[1:36] participate
[1:37] in their own deliverance they will have
[1:39] to call on the lord
[1:41] just like you did but the very thing
[1:43] they despise today
[1:44] can be the thing they run after in the
[1:47] next five
[1:48] minutes when that oil gets released on
[1:51] them
[1:52] god has a strategy and he has a timing
[1:55] and when god's divine strategy meets
[1:58] god's divine
[1:59] timing there is a deliverance
[2:03] that the enemy cannot stop he can't
[2:06] hinder he can't prevent
