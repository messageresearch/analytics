Description:
As the Living Word and Spirit, both Truth and supernatural vindication was represented in the Ark of the Covenant, likewise we cannot make the rapture with an intellectual concept of the Word alone, we must have the ‘Living Word’, the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ living within us.   We can speak of about having the power of the Spoken Word, but it will take true revelation to quicken us to make the rapture.
