[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] last night I had the most simple
[0:11] dream
[0:13] um no profound
[0:16] Revelation just a real personal
[0:19] encouragement to me and maybe it would
[0:21] encourage you but I'm not going to tell
[0:24] you the
[0:25] dream I'm just going to tell you a
[0:27] portion of the dream brother brandom
[0:30] walked up to where I was in this
[0:32] dream in the
[0:35] garden and he walked up behind me and he
[0:39] said hello
[0:41] there I turned around recognized his
[0:45] voice and I said why brother brandom I
[0:47] wasn't expecting you to see you here
[0:49] today and he said I've come to sing you
[0:51] a
[0:53] song and in that dream I felt so guilty
[0:56] because I have been known to say that
[1:00] Brandon was not a great singer but when
[1:02] he sung he sung with his whole heart and
[1:06] it was anointed every time I say that
[1:09] brother westes looks at me cross-eyed
[1:11] usually because he said well he wasn't
[1:13] that bad it's not that he wasn't that I
[1:16] think he was a bad singer It's just
[1:18] sometimes he he could catch a song at
[1:21] the end and sing a whole verse in
[1:23] another key from what the piano player
[1:25] was and he never slowed down most of us
[1:28] would would kind of you know I no I'm
[1:30] not but he just because he was singing
[1:32] from his heart and so I felt so guilty
[1:35] in the
[1:37] dream all the times I'd said that I'd
[1:40] said it in a not an ugly way at all but
[1:42] or an unkind way but I felt so guilty
[1:45] here's brother brandom come to sing me a
[1:47] song and here I have said he wasn't a
[1:51] great
[1:52] singer and I just dropped my head like
[1:55] that and he said a few things to me and
[1:58] after he did he said now I'm going to
[2:01] sing You the song and far as I know I've
[2:05] never heard brother brandham sing this
[2:07] song I looked on the tape search this
[2:09] morning I've never heard him sing this
[2:12] song but I'm going to tell you in a
[2:14] moment after we sing it why I think he
[2:17] sung it to me in this dream and uh if
[2:20] you know this the words to this you can
[2:23] help
[2:24] me it's not maybe the easiest song for
[2:28] me to sing but just listen to the word
[2:30] words there was no music and he did
[2:32] beautiful by the
[2:34] way much better than I'll do
[2:37] now there's
[2:40] glory in my
[2:43] soul since
[2:45] Jesus took
[2:48] control he
[2:51] plac within my heart a happy song

[8:50] day I'm
[8:52] going there to
[8:55] stay
[8:58] PR W be
[9:02] very
[9:05] long when I got over to the church this
[9:08] morning thank you
[9:09] musicians I started asking the Lord
[9:12] because it was so much on my mind when I
[9:14] woke up this
[9:16] morning I don't know when I've ever
[9:18] heard that song it's been
[9:21] years again I couldn't find where
[9:24] brother Brandon was singing it ever on a
[9:25] tape or anything like that and I just
[9:28] prayed Lord would would you show me why
[9:30] you you have in the past dealt with me
[9:34] would you show me why you would have let
[9:37] me dream such a dream I didn't go to bed
[9:39] thinking about brother
[9:41] brandom why would I have such a
[9:44] dream and the thought came to me well
[9:46] let me just see if if I can't find where
[9:48] he sung the song let me see how many
[9:51] times he said press
[9:53] on I thought that'd be a good place to
[9:55] look and just over and over and over
[9:58] again he'd say it it's a it's an
[10:00] expression he used but as I began to
[10:03] read through those quotations of him
[10:05] saying press on I hit the target and I
[10:08] want to share that with you in just a
[10:10] moment the Lord let me know without a
[10:12] shadow of a doubt that's why I had the
[10:15] dream that I had maybe it was just for
[10:18] me but it could encourage you as well
[10:22] let me read a couple things to you
[10:24] before we get to what I feel like is the
[10:26] reason why in a little message called
[10:29] expectation he said let us put our
[10:32] shoulders and arms together and press on
[10:38] to try to make a a a little better life
[10:42] for the people we're sojourning with if
[10:46] there's not selfish motive then that's
[10:49] the attitude I'm sure we would take
[10:53] isn't that nice press on and make life a
[10:56] little better for the people we're
[10:57] sojourning with
[11:00] then another uh mention of press on in
[11:03] looking at the
[11:05] Unseen he said I'm told by aviators who
[11:08] fly these real fast jet planes and they
[11:11] say that the plane will get up to a
[11:13] certain speed and it vibrates and shakes
[11:17] it seems like the bolts are going to fly
[11:19] out of it and the wings are going to
[11:20] come off until they pass the sound
[11:24] barrier but he said once they pass the
[11:27] sound barrier they say the the plane
[11:29] just sails out in ease he said that's an
[11:33] obstacle that's in the way of that plane
[11:35] when it passes its own sound barrier and
[11:38] then it runs at ease oh he said if the
[11:40] Church of this day could ever pray till
[11:43] they pass the sin
[11:45] barrier and the unbelief barrier isin't
[11:49] that good they could shout the victory
[11:52] of a living God when they once passed
[11:55] that barrier by looking to the Unseen
[11:59] and instead of the scene and letting the
[12:01] world vibrate and do whatever it wants
[12:03] to do he said there's a living God and
[12:06] when we lose our disbelief and unbelief
[12:08] in him and pass that barrier he said the
[12:11] world is saying the days of Miracles are
[12:14] passed it'll make you shake there's no
[12:16] such thing as the baptism of the Holy
[12:18] Ghost that'll make you wonder but if
[12:20] you'll just look at the Unseen to The
[12:22] God Who promised it or the promise is
[12:25] unto you and to your children and to
[12:27] them that are a far off even as many as
[12:29] the Lord Our God shall call if you look
[12:32] to the Blessed word that says Jesus
[12:34] Christ it's the same yesterday today and
[12:37] forever and turn your heads towards that
[12:40] and press on until you past that
[12:42] vibration past the unbelief barrier and
[12:45] the sin barrier and all the barriers
[12:48] that seem to hinder you then you'll fly
[12:50] free in the faith of God knowing that
[12:53] all things are possible there is no
[12:56] limit they say hardly to the speed of
[12:58] the plane then if there's no limit to
[13:01] how it can go there's no limit to the
[13:03] blessings that God will pour down upon a
[13:06] believer that will believe how many of
[13:09] you'd like to know that you're pressing
[13:11] beyond the sin barrier pressing beyond
[13:15] the unbelief barrier until you find that
[13:18] place where there's no more vibration to
[13:20] hold you back you know you you come to
[13:22] that place where things start shaking
[13:24] around it would be human nature to back
[13:27] off wouldn't it you you'd back off the
[13:30] accelerator if you're driving a car or
[13:32] something something started shaking like
[13:34] that you your tendency would be to back
[13:36] off but brother Brandon was encouraging
[13:39] us to press on and then I don't know why
[13:42] I didn't think of this because I just
[13:45] shared this with you a year ago and I
[13:47] don't know why it didn't come to me the
[13:49] way it did but maybe two years ago but
[13:52] if you remember I told you again about
[13:55] brother brandom's experience beyond the
[13:57] curtain of time
[13:59] and what a lot of people forget is that
[14:02] it didn't come to brother brandham at a
[14:04] very high moment in his life it came to
[14:08] him in a very discouraged moment a place
[14:12] where his faith was weak and his mind
[14:15] was tired and in fact it came in a time
[14:20] when he needed to be encouraged to do
[14:22] what to press
[14:25] on and there are many tellings of this
[14:28] and and this is not the
[14:29] bestelling but it's the one I could grab
[14:32] it's the first time he told it and it's
[14:35] the one I could grab this morning for
[14:36] you and I'll I'll just read it although
[14:38] it take me a few minutes to do it the
[14:41] other morning about I kept hearing
[14:44] something he said we go to church at
[14:46] 9:30 and I raised up and I looked over
[14:48] at the wife and she was sleeping well
[14:51] just got the studying about that I I
[14:53] kept hearing something say press
[14:56] on just keep pressing
[15:00] on I said well I'm 50 years
[15:04] old I've got to do something for the
[15:06] Lord that's pretty encouraging to me he
[15:08] had certainly accomplished a whole lot
[15:11] in his ministry but he wasn't feeling
[15:14] like
[15:15] that he
[15:17] said I haven't done nothing
[15:20] yet he put me my life here and anyone
[15:24] knows that something happened to me he
[15:25] said I was a Cocker and he made a wheat
[15:28] out of me
[15:29] I don't know how it ever come what Can I
[15:32] Do Lord I said I'm 50 years old my days
[15:35] are
[15:36] numbered I haven't got very much longer
[15:38] to stay people laughed they chuckled but
[15:42] he knew something they didn't know
[15:44] wasn't because he was 50 it's because he
[15:47] was facing a death that would seem
[15:50] untimely I'm 50 years old my days are
[15:53] numbered I haven't got very much longer
[15:55] to stay what can I do how can I do
[15:57] something for you and The Voice voice
[15:59] answered press
[16:02] on now remember friends here lays my
[16:06] Bible if I'm a fanatic I don't know it I
[16:10] don't know nothing about it I believe my
[16:11] heart's with God I believe he's proved
[16:14] that before you I may be wrong in some
[16:16] things but it's unconsciously wrong when
[16:20] when uh I was thinking about that I kept
[16:22] hearing something say again press
[16:25] on I said who is that it must be my wife
[16:28] I said said what did you say honey she
[16:30] never moved I shook her I said MAA he
[16:34] probably said mey she said uh she was
[16:37] sleeping well and I said well it wasn't
[16:39] her I listened again and it said keep
[16:42] pressing
[16:44] on now I know Visions this could have
[16:46] been a vision if it was I never had one
[16:48] just like it I said maybe it's me saying
[16:51] it cause one time I was all burdened and
[16:53] distress going to a meeting I knelt down
[16:55] on the floor praying to get a burden off
[16:58] of me I heard someone stand at the door
[17:00] rattling off something in German or
[17:02] something well I wonder who that is I
[17:04] slipped up I couldn't see no one well
[17:07] where's that coming from it was me
[17:09] speaking myself I just held real still
[17:12] until it finished up and that's when the
[17:14] woman you know that was healed she was
[17:16] laying on the side of a road bleeding to
[17:18] death a half hour farther she was there
[17:20] perfectly normal and well the Holy
[17:23] Spirit made
[17:26] intercessions powerful he said thought
[17:29] maybe it would me it was me saying keep
[17:31] pressing on so I put my finger over my
[17:33] mouth like this and I heard it say keep
[17:36] pressing on pressing on I said who are
[17:39] you that's talking to me who's in this
[17:41] room and that's the way it comes just
[17:43] like Visions this is real just a voice
[17:45] just the same as you hear mine keep
[17:48] pressing on and I said keep pressing
[17:52] on said the great reward is just
[17:56] ahead I said you mean I pass the curtain
[18:00] he said
[18:01] yes would you like to see it I said I
[18:04] would here's what he said listen to this
[18:08] would you like to see it brother brandom
[18:10] answered I would it would help me if I
[18:13] could just see it and something happened
[18:16] I felt myself leaving this body now I
[18:19] never had a vision like that I'm looking
[18:21] back seeing myself laying there leaning
[18:23] up against the headboard of the bed with
[18:24] my hands up like this and I looked at
[18:27] myself and I thought I'm dying
[18:29] and I started moving out and the first
[18:31] thing you know I come into a little
[18:32] place that kindly set something like
[18:34] that and as soon as I got there here
[18:36] come thousands of people and everyone
[18:39] looking young now I'm in a mixed
[18:42] multitude and I'm your brother and you
[18:44] watch I say this in the name of the Lord
[18:46] you'll each meet there if you'll be
[18:48] right but these young girls coming to me
[18:51] throwing their arms around me and
[18:53] hollering my precious
[18:56] brother now look when I was a sinner
[18:58] never run around I wasn't Army to run
[19:00] around with women I don't care how
[19:03] saintly a man tries to live how Godly
[19:05] lives if a woman puts her arm around a
[19:07] man it's a human
[19:09] sensation he said now you just well to
[19:11] know that you're still a human just
[19:13] exactly right the power of God can keep
[19:16] you and go on but he said here come
[19:18] people just throwing he was letting you
[19:20] know that that was not something normal
[19:23] that for him to let sisters put their
[19:27] arms around him he said' but here they
[19:29] kept throwing their arms around me
[19:31] saying my precious brother and all them
[19:33] women had long hair white garments
[19:36] barefooted they were young looked to be
[19:39] about 18 years old maybe 20 they'd grab
[19:43] me and throw their arms around me and
[19:44] say our precious brother and hug me like
[19:46] that and then walk away and somebody
[19:49] else I seen my first wife come up now
[19:53] she died when she was about 22 she
[19:56] hadn't changed a bit she' Come Running I
[19:58] said surely she'll call me my husband
[20:02] and she walked up and began smiling
[20:03] threw arms around me she said my darling
[20:09] brother then she hugged some of the
[20:12] women that had just hugged me and here
[20:14] come men looked like they were uh had
[20:17] hair down their shoulder they were
[20:19] nicest looking people I'd ever seen
[20:21] Starry pearly white teeth they were
[20:24] throwing their arms around me and saying
[20:26] our precious brother and one of them
[20:27] hollered at one and said he's
[20:30] arrived he's arrived at last and I
[20:34] thought have I died and I've come to
[20:36] glory is this it I thought it couldn't
[20:39] be and I looked in that voice that had
[20:42] spoke to me down in my room I heard it
[20:44] again I looked back I saw myself lying
[20:47] there on the bed I never had anything
[20:49] like that happen it's done something to
[20:50] me I can never be the same no more I
[20:54] thought what is this well all them
[20:57] people look young I look down and I was
[20:59] young I had turned back to a young man
[21:01] again well this is strange I can't
[21:04] explain it there's no words that I can
[21:06] think of I'd say superb or supreme or
[21:10] perfect that wouldn't touch it there was
[21:13] no tomorrow there was no yesterday they
[21:15] were we were in
[21:17] eternity and they never got tired they
[21:20] never had to eat yes they had senses I
[21:22] could feel them they could speak they
[21:24] were looking at me I don't understand
[21:27] this I said listen and the voice
[21:31] said this is what you remember this is
[21:37] perfect
[21:40] love said isn't that what you spoke the
[21:43] Holy Spirit was I said yes and this is
[21:48] perfect love and about that time a big
[21:51] bunch of men lifted me up and took me to
[21:53] a place and set me up kind of high like
[21:55] a stand or something and there here was
[21:57] people I could see them by the tens of
[21:59] thousands coming from everywhere every
[22:01] one young beautiful running hugging me I
[22:04] said well I don't get this and just in a
[22:06] beautiful young woman ran up she said Oh
[22:08] My Darling brother we're so happy to see
[22:11] you welcome she walked away and said I
[22:14] said praise the Lord sister I looked
[22:17] around me and I thought what is this
[22:18] what's going on then a
[22:21] voice spoke and said in the Bible where
[22:24] it said that Jacob was gathered with his
[22:26] people and the other one that is like to
[22:28] that where you'll gather with your
[22:31] people I said are all these
[22:33] Broms I never believ that was that many
[22:36] he said they're not brandom's they're
[22:38] your converts they're the that woman
[22:41] that you're admiring you know how old
[22:43] she was when you led her to Christ I
[22:45] said I have no idea past
[22:49] 90 see she's young forever Hallelujah
[22:53] she looked up at me and said brother
[22:55] brandom Jesus will come someday and
[22:57] we'll go back to Earth Earth and we'll
[22:59] receive our glorified body then we'll
[23:01] live together forever I said well what
[23:03] do you set me up here like this for and
[23:06] she said they said you was our leader
[23:09] you led us oh let me see Jesus if I've
[23:12] passed over I said I want to see him and
[23:14] the voice said you can't see him now
[23:16] he'll come but first we he will come to
[23:19] you I said judge you by the gospel you
[23:22] preached and I said the gospel I preach
[23:25] yes I said will St Paul have to stand
[23:29] before his converts absolutely he will
[23:32] too I said I never varied one
[23:35] word I stayed just exactly the way the
[23:38] Bible said it I don't care what anyone
[23:40] said I stayed right with it like that so
[23:43] if Paul's group is saved mine will be
[23:45] too and a great scream formed looked
[23:48] like thousands and thousands said we
[23:50] know that praise God I never was so
[23:53] happy that I stayed true to the word I
[23:56] never was so happy when he told that
[23:59] later he said that voices screamed out
[24:01] we're counting on that or we're resting
[24:04] on that and this is what brother carer
[24:06] mentioned here Tuesday night years ago I
[24:09] I looked and I used to have an old
[24:11] hunting dog his name was
[24:13] Fritz and he was half airdale is that
[24:16] how you say that and half newfinland he
[24:19] was a great big dog and he used to go
[24:21] with me everywhere I'd go hunting and
[24:22] the best old thing I'd ever
[24:24] had he'd lay with me putting uh he'd put
[24:28] me in school clothes from hunting Tre
[24:30] and possums and skunks and whatever more
[24:33] I trapped and he just kept me in school
[24:36] clothes and I'd leave him anywhere he'd
[24:39] find his way home he would sell those
[24:41] skins for to buy school clothes and one
[24:44] day when he moved into the city a
[24:45] policeman came by and throwed a dog
[24:47] button in the yard and killed him when I
[24:50] come home and buried him I was just
[24:51] about 16 17 years old I padded the last
[24:54] bit of dirt on there and I said Fritz
[24:56] I'll kill that man for doing
[24:59] at I went in the house and got my rifle
[25:02] and started down to the police station
[25:04] to get him and when I got on the road
[25:05] little old Ford run up behind me it was
[25:07] my father he grabbed that rifle out of
[25:10] my hand he was a little bitty man
[25:11] slapped me upside the head and said get
[25:14] in the car brother Bram was telling it
[25:17] all wasn't he and I went back and I said
[25:19] Fritz I went up to his grave Fritz
[25:22] here's what I will if pop won't let me
[25:24] do it that way I'll find him on the
[25:26] street someday I'll lose control of my
[25:29] car I promise you I'll get even with him
[25:31] for killing you about a year after that
[25:34] brother brandom said I was saved and I
[25:36] led that man to God and buried him after
[25:39] he was saved Mr short was his name my
[25:43] old dog was gone I always thought after
[25:45] I was saved wonder when I get over there
[25:47] if I'll see old Fritz and while I was
[25:49] sitting there I looked coming down
[25:52] across that
[25:55] Hill here come old Fritz coming up to me
[25:58] me and he was just licking his tongue
[26:00] you know and panting like that and I
[26:02] look coming behind him and here come old
[26:04] Prince my saddle horse and he ran up to
[26:08] me and put his neck around me over like
[26:10] that oh God what is
[26:13] this just then a voice spoke all that
[26:16] you ever
[26:17] loved and all that ever loved you God
[26:21] has given to you we're all here together
[26:25] oh my heart melted within me all that
[26:27] you ever loved and all that ever loved
[26:29] you is gathered here with you to meet
[26:31] God I said oh praise be to God and about
[26:36] that time I felt myself moving I said I
[26:38] don't have to go back do I and I was
[26:41] back here at the bed again friend death
[26:45] does not change a man it just changes
[26:47] your dwelling place I've got a wife very
[26:49] sweet wife sitting here three little
[26:51] children two little girls little boy I
[26:53] want to live for them but my first
[26:56] purpose in life is to live for Christ
[26:58] Christ and for my Ministry the second
[27:00] I'd like to live long enough that I
[27:02] could see my little Joseph sitting there
[27:04] become a minister I want to hand this
[27:05] Bible to him don't you compromise on one
[27:08] word stay true to God if it takes
[27:11] everything there is you stay true to the
[27:13] word and he goes on listen friends
[27:15] wherever that is it isn't one breath
[27:18] between us and there
[27:22] tonight with all my heart this is the
[27:25] first time I've ever told this outside
[27:27] of my own church with all my heart by
[27:29] the grace of God that's right this was
[27:31] in Chicago
[27:33] Ohio by the grace of God with all I
[27:35] could do I promise God I'll pull every
[27:37] soul if I have to make it and compel and
[27:40] everything else to come to Jesus for
[27:42] what a time that was when those people
[27:44] those bright-eyed women and men standing
[27:46] their arms screaming my darling brother
[27:48] I know that my Ministry had been the
[27:50] cause of them being there God help me
[27:52] forever to win souls for Christ is my
[27:55] prayer and he closed it and let us pray
[27:59] I believe the reason why brother Brandon
[28:02] walked up to me that way in the dream
[28:04] and said I want to sing you a song that
[28:06] caught me off guard and he started
[28:09] singing press on it won't be very long
[28:13] not long until we reach that land of
[28:15] song I think it was an encouragement to
[28:18] say no matter what you feel no matter
[28:21] what you're facing you can press on past
[28:25] that sin barrier that unb belief barrier
[28:29] that stress barrier we didn't used to
[28:31] know what stress was did we we never
[28:34] heard the word before we just we just
[28:37] called it
[28:38] life our grandparents just called it
[28:41] living we call it stress I don't care
[28:44] what you're going through today how bad
[28:47] it looks it's not as bad as it looks
[28:49] I'll tell you that right now not as bad
[28:51] as it looks and it may feel like it's
[28:53] forever but I tell you this too shall
[28:56] pass and God couldn't done anything I
[28:58] can't think of anything more that he
[29:00] could have done or or of a different
[29:02] nature to encourage me personally than
[29:05] by letting me see brother brandom that
[29:07] way just singing although I felt awful
[29:10] terrible about saying what I've said
[29:13] about his singing Lord help me not to
[29:15] say that
[29:16] again because I he can sing to me any
[29:19] time in a dream or or Vision or whatever
[29:22] because it's certainly encouraging to
[29:24] know now you just can you know let that
[29:27] pass from your mind it may not be for
[29:29] you anyway but I'm thankful for it and
[29:33] I'm going to press on by the help and
[29:35] the grace of God
