========================================

Description:
How can we come into the fullness of sonship and intimate relationship with the Father, calling Him ‘Abba Father! My Father!’ just like Jesus did?  How did He become our Example?    How did He become ‘The Pattern Son’?  A process of growing up  and development had to take place in His life to become the First Perfect God-Man.”  

If the same Spirit that was in Jesus is in us, we too  must follow that process and grow up into full adoption.  We can say, “If He could reach perfection, so can we by the same Spirit.”
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you and i who have lived our whole life as just men we graduate to something else god men isaiah prophesied 600 some say 700 years before messiah was born that there was going to come a child there was going to come a son there was going to come one who would be wonderful and counselor mighty god and the everlasting father the prince of peace don't don't miss that because it gives us a great prophetic understanding of the godhead he's not only the son but he is the everlasting father there's only one being talked about in isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6. it's not two different persons or three different persons here in the godhead but that same son that is given that also is the everlasting father it also is the child that's born to us the one upon whom shoulders the whole government of god would sit upon we're blessed to know him if you believe we're blessed to know him today say amen i didn't say just know about him we're blessed to know him in an intimate way by the spirit of adoption we are allowed to call him papa god abba father not just our father but my father there's power in that there's power in understanding the relationship that god has made available to us with him do you believe he was the word made flesh do you believe that all that was in the father was in him he would be fullness then wouldn't he he is in fact the express image of god and the entirety of the godhead the bible tells us that the entirety of the godhead dwelt in him it dwelt in his physical form but for some reason he wasn't born with it all i want you to think about the process he wasn't born in completion he who would be complete he who would be the first perfect god man god in spirit man in fleshly body and yet there was a process there was a development there was a growing up that had to take place in his life he chose to do it that way for you because he was looking for a patterned son he was to become a pattern son one that you and i could look at his life and pattern our life after his life knowing that if he who was god in the flesh would be born without the total completion and manifestation of what had been prophesied of him but he would grow and he would come up into the stature of the perfect man we look at that and we say if he had to do it and did it by the grace of god he turns around and said because i did because i was able you are also able he was showing himself in such a way that you and i can look at him and say my if he could grow up into something then i can grow up into something as long as i've got the same spirit in me that he had in him same spirit again we look at it and we say oh but he was god yes but he was man he was growing into something did you know he had to receive the baptism of the holy ghost he was all god yet he was all man he had to have the same infusion you see he received who god was as an earnest when he was created in the womb of mary to become a begotten son he received an earnest of all that he would be when you were born again through repentance through justification the process of the new birth begins you receive an earnest of what you will one day carry the fullness of you get enough of the spirit of god and your repentance and in your conversion to lead you to guide you to direct you to bring you to all truth the bible said but you can't get by without the baptism of the holy ghost it's not just an infilling it's not just god filling us up but it's god filling us up and then plunging us beneath the holy ghost we are baptized in the spirit just like we are immersed in baptism with water if somebody could see ahead and recognize who you are as an adopted son of god going through your process just like jesus went through his just like brother william branham had to go through his you're going through yours so that at the end of this [Music] you and i who have lived our whole life as just men we graduate to something else god man you
