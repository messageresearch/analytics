[37:21] everything he starts he'll meet us right
[37:25] here where we are I can feel Faith
[37:29] rising up cuz I know God is
[37:35] big I want them to sing that one more
[37:39] time and I want you put the words back
[37:41] up please I want you to emphasize this
[37:44] line when you it's not a line that's
[37:46] repeated so you have to emphasize it in
[37:50] faith what I mean by that is when you
[37:53] say these words believe it really
[37:56] consciously make that the see I believe
[38:00] this all of it but this line is being
[38:04] highlighted for me in the spirit I can
[38:07] run the
[38:08] race I'm called to run amen I'm a firm
[38:13] believer that we're not all running
[38:15] we're running in the same race but we're
[38:18] not all running the same race because
[38:20] our circumstances are different past
[38:24] circumstances present circumstances
[38:26] maybe even future circumstances are
[38:29] different so you've got a race and only
[38:31] you can run it and you've got to believe
[38:35] you've got to believe that you
[38:41] can he saw it he knows it he knew it and
[38:47] you can run the race that you're called
[38:51] to run simply simply because God's just
[38:54] big
[38:55] enough yes he is you you need you need
[38:57] to quit arguing with him and you need to
[38:59] quit contradicting
[39:01] him someone asked
[39:04] recently when we've been talking about
[39:07] forgiveness somebody
[39:09] said what about how do I forgive myself
[39:12] well that's the hard
[39:15] part but if you really really think
[39:18] about it this is not going to be what
[39:20] you want to hear but if you really think
[39:23] about it why should you bother why
[39:26] should you worry
[39:28] because if God has forgiven
[39:31] you you're
[39:33] forgiven it's
[39:35] done you you didn't sin against yourself
[39:39] particularly now I know that mentally
[39:42] and emotionally we have to come to
[39:44] forgiveness and we have to quit carrying
[39:46] guilt and condemnation that's something
[39:49] a little bit different
[39:50] altogether but what I have to remember
[39:53] if I ever have something that lingers
[39:55] that I am holding against my own self
[39:57] even though the Lord has already
[39:58] forgiven me I have to remember what the
[40:00] word said it's done he's big enough to
[40:04] forgive it he's big enough to put the
[40:06] blood on it and so if I continue to hold
[40:11] it and use it against my own self I'm
[40:15] really just arguing with him just really
[40:18] contradicting what he has said let's
[40:21] stop doing that when we catch ourselves
[40:23] doing it let's just say Okay Lord I come
[40:25] into agreement with your word in my life
[40:28] I believe what you say I can run the
[40:32] race that I'm called to run sing it
[40:35] again and let that let all of it be real

[50:57] light of the Glorious gospel has arisen
[51:01] in our hearts and he has lighted up our
[51:04] path that we could see where we're going
[51:06] he sure has amen Jonathan it's been a
[51:09] while since we've seen you it's nice to
[51:11] see you this morning God bless
[51:17] you Wesley good to see you God bless you
[51:27] we had a wonderful day yesterday
[51:29] celebrating Ginger and brother Magnus
[51:33] and it's hard for me to call him
[51:35] Eric called him brother Magnuson for
[51:38] since I've known him but we were glad
[51:41] that we could celebrate their day
[51:43] yesterday and we pray for them as they
[51:45] journey into life together um all that
[51:49] you did to make that possible we say God
[51:52] bless you richly for everything that you
[51:55] did to be a part of that I know that the
[51:58] Lord is faithful to uh bless us in what
[52:02] we do for him as unto the Lord you know
[52:06] everything that we do should be as unto
[52:08] the Lord because when we do it as unto
[52:11] people we get disappointed if we don't
[52:13] get thanked but when we do it as unto
[52:16] him we do it with joy with gratefulness
[52:19] because he has been so faithful to us
[52:23] some of us
[52:25] encountered no power today how many of
[52:28] you were without
[52:30] power see even the people on the
[52:32] campground the lower part is it comes in
[52:34] from a different way and they lost power
[52:36] in the lower part and uh the power
[52:39] company was actually supposed they've
[52:40] set Stakes to reroute that power to go
[52:44] down the hill this way instead of coming
[52:46] through the woods they have not yet done
[52:48] it so today I also lost power and so we
[52:53] experience first world
[52:55] problems um such as a cold
[52:58] shower and a cold shower I've taken cold
[53:01] showers in third world
[53:03] countries but some years ago I took the
[53:06] hot water tanks out of my house and I
[53:08] put in an electric on Point water heater
[53:11] and so when the power is out there's no
[53:13] Reserve it's just cold so I got a cold
[53:17] shower today well when the Electric's
[53:20] out there's no coffee
[53:22] pot my wife put the kettle on the grill
[53:26] and uh she had a cup that we were able
[53:28] to put coffee grounds in and pour the
[53:30] water over like a French press and so I
[53:33] was able to have coffee but a different
[53:35] way then when I got ready to leave for
[53:38] church the garage door didn't
[53:42] open well any of you that have a garage
[53:45] door know that on a garage door opening
[53:47] there's a rope that you can pull on and
[53:49] you release the door and you can put the
[53:50] door up
[53:52] manually well I forgot that somewhere
[53:54] along the way that rope broke
[53:57] and so uh my wife said I can get a chair
[54:01] for you to stand on I said ah we've got
[54:03] a vehicle outside that runs we can bring
[54:05] a different vehicle so that was some of
[54:08] what we encountered today to get to
[54:10] church but we're grateful to be in the
[54:13] house of the Lord to sing praises
[54:15] together with you the Lord is faithful
[54:18] in every way he uh I think he allows
[54:21] those things sometimes to let us know
[54:23] how good we have it he has been most
[54:26] most precious to us in all of the
[54:28] provision that that we have as we were
[54:32] gathered together in the fellowship Paul
[54:34] yesterday and you looked around and you
[54:37] saw how that it was decorated and made
[54:39] so beautiful and and that one wall that
[54:42] still was showing the insulation and oh
[54:45] how we want to get it done we do and in
[54:48] God's due time we will God will provide
[54:52] that we can know how to set up a kitchen
[54:55] and and get all the electrical outlets
[54:57] in the right place and and get all the
[55:00] plumbing in the right place and then
[55:02] sheetrock it and be able to put cabinets
[55:04] on it the Lord will provide for that
[55:07] he's faithful to do it I have uh I have
[55:11] observed over the last sometime that it
[55:15] right out on this end of the building
[55:17] there's kind of a a a a a a a ditch of a
[55:21] valley that has been put there in cement
[55:24] and you we we've read the quote along
[55:27] the way about when when our faith can
[55:30] move a sand off of the side of a
[55:33] mountain and I look at that place out
[55:35] there and I see the sand that's coming
[55:38] off the top of this parking lot and it
[55:41] makes me know we've got to get this
[55:43] parking lot sealed before it's down to
[55:45] the gravel and so that's why we've kind
[55:48] of put that on hold uh down at the
[55:50] fellowship hall we have a little over
[55:52] $8,000 in the building fund right now
[55:55] it's going to take toward uh probably
[55:58] toward $20,000 by the time the dirt work
[56:01] is done to keep the water from running
[56:03] across the parking lot in PR in
[56:06] preparation to seal the parking lot
[56:09] everything has to be done in order so
[56:11] that we don't have to redo we don't want
[56:13] to spend money twice when we can spend
[56:15] it once and so we thank you for your
[56:18] giving uh we don't want to forget
[56:21] Jerusalem God called us to Jerusalem and
[56:24] so we want to make sure that we're still
[56:26] giv into Jerusalem and that that need is
[56:29] met uh the apartment there in Jerusalem
[56:32] is is still least in our name we want to
[56:35] make sure we take care of that so all of
[56:37] your giving give as unto the Lord not
[56:41] unto men or under a project as unto the
[56:44] Lord and then when he blesses you you
[56:47] will know that it is because you have
[56:49] done it rightfully you have done it
[56:52] according to the word you've done it
[56:54] with a cheerful heart and he gives back
[56:57] pressed down and shaken together that's
[56:59] who he is he's a god of
[57:02] multiplication he knows how to multiply
[57:05] what we give he knows how to multiply it
[57:08] back into our house it may not come back
[57:10] in the same dollar amount it may not
[57:13] come back in dollars and cents it may
[57:16] come back as a gift it may come back as
[57:19] a savings on something that's who he is
[57:22] so you remember that as you give of your
[57:25] tithe and offering not giving it to a
[57:27] man it's as unto the Lord because it's
[57:30] keeping Covenant with him brother Ellas

[1:09:14] there because we're going to do some
[1:09:15] teaching this morning I need his help we
[1:09:18] always do we're here to lift up his name
[1:09:22] thank you for pressing through your uh
[1:09:24] lack of electri elri it and whatever
[1:09:26] else you had to fight to get here today
[1:09:29] God was gracious and uh he gave you
[1:09:32] strength and we had to kind of navigate
[1:09:34] our way down 250 because of the uh work
[1:09:37] that was going on there but we we're
[1:09:40] just thankful that we are uh with power
[1:09:44] and no trees on the church and God is
[1:09:47] good keep thy heart with all diligence
[1:09:52] for out of it are
[1:09:57] the issues of life let's go a bit
[1:10:00] further put away from thee a forward
[1:10:04] mouth and perverse lips put far from
[1:10:08] thee let thine eyes look right
[1:10:12] on straight ahead and let thine eyelids
[1:10:16] look straight before thee Ponder the
[1:10:20] path of thy feet and let all thy ways be
[1:10:24] established lished turn not to the right
[1:10:28] hand nor to the
[1:10:30] left and withdraw or remove thy foot
[1:10:37] from evil Lord thank you again for these
[1:10:41] wise words of instruction but they're
[1:10:45] really more than just instruction it's a
[1:10:48] warning a big one to us and you have
[1:10:52] emphasized that in the spirit for this
[1:10:56] season and so we ask that you would help
[1:11:00] us to be Guardians over our own heart
[1:11:05] the seed of
[1:11:07] emotions and now we ask that you would
[1:11:10] move all
[1:11:12] distraction from this house we have come
[1:11:15] fighting to get here and now we desire
[1:11:20] that you would talk to us let us hear
[1:11:22] your voice in your word and we'll give
[1:11:26] you glory and honor and praise for it's
[1:11:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:11:30] pray and the Saints said you may be
[1:11:41] seated so this
[1:11:44] morning we are moving just a little bit
[1:11:47] further in our
[1:11:51] study of
[1:11:53] offense and we will call this the
[1:11:57] characteristics and
[1:12:00] strongholds of
[1:12:03] offense uh who would have thought that
[1:12:06] you could preach so much from the word
[1:12:08] about one thing
[1:12:10] well the issue with
[1:12:13] offense is that there are partnering
[1:12:18] spirits that like to run with the
[1:12:22] wound and they are not there to help you
[1:12:28] they're not there to soothe you they're
[1:12:30] there to
[1:12:32] complicate and multiply the impact of
[1:12:37] what you are experiencing and what you
[1:12:40] have
[1:12:41] experienced we Face these kinds of
[1:12:44] offenses all the time and by God's
[1:12:47] design we're supposed to be able to just
[1:12:49] step out from them and keep moving
[1:12:52] toward the prize which is Jesus Jesus
[1:12:55] Christ how many of you remember it's not
[1:12:58] a golden street it's not a Jasper wall
[1:13:01] it's it's Christ he's the trophy he's
[1:13:04] the prize when we gain him we've gained
[1:13:08] everything somebody said we gained him
[1:13:10] we've gained the world do you really
[1:13:11] want the world I'm not interested in the
[1:13:14] world as it stands is my inheritance but
[1:13:16] I have a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:13:19] that's mine that's what the scripture
[1:13:22] promises so uh we want to be be able to
[1:13:26] recognize and identify because we I
[1:13:29] believe very strongly this has been a
[1:13:33] hindrance to us in this local assembly
[1:13:36] for a long time the inability is quiet
[1:13:41] the inability to step past the offense
[1:13:46] then to deal with all the partnering
[1:13:48] spirits that come with offense and let
[1:13:53] them pile on top of each other
[1:13:55] and the wounds on top of each other
[1:13:57] until we can no longer see a person for
[1:14:00] who they are in Christ when we look at
[1:14:03] them we only remember what they've done
[1:14:05] to
[1:14:06] us that's not God's Will and I'll read
[1:14:10] you a place uh in in a few moments where
[1:14:14] brother brandom says it shuts down the
[1:14:18] kingdom of
[1:14:20] God I I I think that's pretty serious
[1:14:25] indictment against me against you
[1:14:28] against anybody who walks continues to
[1:14:33] walk in that kind of a place you are
[1:14:37] affecting the kingdom of God you're
[1:14:39] affecting your own personal walk with
[1:14:42] Christ your family your community your
[1:14:46] church Community uh and so forth and Etc
[1:14:50] it just sort of goes on and on it
[1:14:53] compounds
[1:14:55] it gets bigger it doesn't get smaller
[1:14:58] until we deal with it anybody with me
[1:15:01] this morning already good that word in
[1:15:04] the Hebrew that we have looked at
[1:15:07] several times before
[1:15:09] keep uh in verse 23 it it means more
[1:15:14] than just holding on to something in
[1:15:16] fact that's not what it means at all it
[1:15:18] doesn't mean hold onto your heart it
[1:15:20] means to guard it to watch over it to to
[1:15:25] observe it to preserve it that's why the
[1:15:29] complete Jewish Bible says uh the verse
[1:15:32] is translated this way above everything
[1:15:36] else guard your heart for it is the
[1:15:40] source of life's
[1:15:43] consequences now consequences are the
[1:15:47] circumstances that happen to us because
[1:15:50] of decisions that we have made that's
[1:15:52] what a consequence is and
[1:15:55] David Stern when he looked at the Hebrew
[1:15:59] word that is used here he said it needs
[1:16:03] to be a little sharper than what I see
[1:16:06] it in the King James I want to portray
[1:16:10] what I believe the Hebrew is saying and
[1:16:14] that is everything that happens in your
[1:16:17] life flows out from your heart that's
[1:16:20] why the scripture says out of the
[1:16:22] abundance of the heart
[1:16:25] the mouth speaketh the mouth talks uh
[1:16:29] but Dr Stern said it's not just the
[1:16:32] mouth it's
[1:16:34] everything you begin to attract the very
[1:16:40] emotion negative emotion that you hold
[1:16:42] on to so if you haven't dealt with
[1:16:46] jealousy it just gets bigger and bigger
[1:16:49] if you have never dealt with your pride
[1:16:52] then Pride just multipli lies and it
[1:16:57] morphs into other
[1:16:59] forms and so that has to be dealt with
[1:17:02] you may sit here this morning and wonder
[1:17:05] why
[1:17:06] because the Lord says
[1:17:10] so that's why we're here that's why
[1:17:13] we're bringing this because the Lord
[1:17:15] says so and we we should do everything
[1:17:18] we can to give him all the attention he
[1:17:22] deserves uh the word keep could all also
[1:17:25] be translated here for Focus your
[1:17:28] mind but that's not strong
[1:17:31] enough it actually means to lock
[1:17:35] something I may have I may have given
[1:17:37] that to you in a note the word keep
[1:17:40] could be translated here uh Focus your
[1:17:43] mind this word can mean from the Hebrew
[1:17:47] to lock something or to fix something to
[1:17:50] its place in modern Hebrew the same word
[1:17:54] that's used here in Proverbs means to
[1:17:58] lock a bolt in place like a uh not just
[1:18:04] a Twist knob lock but what we call a
[1:18:08] deadbolt so in Hebrew the verse is
[1:18:11] saying put a
[1:18:13] deadbolt on your heart don't let it slip
[1:18:19] around control it watch your emotions
[1:18:23] and hold them in place and I think this
[1:18:27] is the best advice that we could get in
[1:18:31] the hour that we're living in now where
[1:18:34] offense is absolutely running rampant on
[1:18:39] every front we learned that offense
[1:18:44] comes from that Greek word
[1:18:47] scandalon and we're going to just
[1:18:49] quickly go over this before we move on
[1:18:51] and that is a stumbling block or a trap
[1:18:54] if it's actually describing the place
[1:18:57] where the cheese is laid where the bait
[1:19:00] is placed
[1:19:02] scandalon a and we know then that the
[1:19:05] enemy desires to use offense as a bait
[1:19:10] to draw you into something dark to draw
[1:19:14] you into negativity to draw you into
[1:19:17] bitterness to draw you into
[1:19:19] unforgiveness to draw you into pride and
[1:19:23] so you and I as we have covered well
[1:19:26] before we just have to make up our mind
[1:19:28] I'm not taking the
[1:19:32] bait you know you you've got the
[1:19:37] problem you understand what I'm saying
[1:19:40] it's easy to get offended but when you
[1:19:43] recognize that you know this is not my
[1:19:47] problem the things you're saying and
[1:19:50] doing uh could really hurt but I I'm I'm
[1:19:54] not going to take on whatever your issue
[1:19:57] is toward
[1:19:59] me you know you can't get offended
[1:20:02] unless you choose to get
[1:20:04] offended you you you can't even get
[1:20:07] angry unless you choose to be angry the
[1:20:10] Bible tells us that we have control a
[1:20:13] godly man has control over all of his
[1:20:16] emotions and the Bible doesn't tell us
[1:20:18] that we should never be
[1:20:21] angry he tells us that we should keep it
[1:20:24] we should look after it guard it lock it
[1:20:28] so that it doesn't go too far how do you
[1:20:31] know if anger is gone too far the
[1:20:33] scripture says Don't Let the
[1:20:36] Sun Go Down on your wrath when you hear
[1:20:41] that you think metaphorically don't you
[1:20:42] it's a metaphor for something but guess
[1:20:45] what it's really literal
[1:20:48] language uh I if you look at it in the
[1:20:51] original it's not painting a poetic
[1:20:53] picture don't let the sun go down it's
[1:20:56] painting a literal
[1:20:58] picture it's a practical guideline for
[1:21:02] negative emotions including anger it
[1:21:04] means that as the day draws to a close
[1:21:08] let your
[1:21:09] anger be done when you are getting
[1:21:13] married some of you did anybody give you
[1:21:16] this uh advice don't go to bed mad with
[1:21:21] one another did you know that scriptural
[1:21:23] advice Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your
[1:21:27] wrath we we
[1:21:30] spiritualize and make metaphors for
[1:21:33] things that we don't really want to deal
[1:21:35] with I hear you now I hear you loud and
[1:21:39] clear no amens but I hear you loud and
[1:21:41] clear I hear what you're
[1:21:46] thinking it I don't like confrontation I
[1:21:50] don't want to De I don't want to I know
[1:21:52] it'll accelerate and I don't want bring
[1:21:54] it up at bedtime because we'll be uh up
[1:21:58] at night no no no the scripture didn't
[1:22:00] say discuss
[1:22:02] it play it out
[1:22:04] again but you said no no no I did not
[1:22:08] yes you did say and then I said that's
[1:22:12] not what you said how many of you know
[1:22:16] that sometime trying to sort it it's
[1:22:19] like the agitator on a washing machine
[1:22:23] it's there to beat it up
[1:22:25] you don't want to agitate it you want to
[1:22:27] let it go and once you go through it
[1:22:30] again all the emotion comes
[1:22:33] back and and you feel it worse than you
[1:22:35] felt it before the scripture didn't say
[1:22:38] discuss it sort it and settle it before
[1:22:41] the sun goes
[1:22:43] down the Bible simply said be angry and
[1:22:48] sin not and not to let the sun go down
[1:22:54] on your
[1:22:55] wrath wrath is anger and God is telling
[1:23:00] us in his word Let It Go if if you live
[1:23:04] with the person you're angry with say to
[1:23:07] them I'm letting it
[1:23:10] go if they've got the right Spirit the
[1:23:13] one you're trying to
[1:23:15] portray they'll let you let it go if
[1:23:18] they
[1:23:20] don't you're back to square one with
[1:23:22] them
[1:23:24] that's when you have to make up your
[1:23:26] mind it has now
[1:23:29] become her
[1:23:31] issue it has now become his issue
[1:23:36] because I'm not going to let the sun go
[1:23:39] down and I'm not laying down in the bed
[1:23:42] mad with wrath with raw emotion I'm
[1:23:46] going to let it
[1:23:48] go uh there's so much that could be said
[1:23:51] about that it's actually the reason why
[1:23:54] why God designed the new day to begin at
[1:24:01] Sunset instead of
[1:24:04] Sunrise the Gregorian calendar and the
[1:24:07] manner in which you and I keep time is
[1:24:11] sunrise signals to us the new
[1:24:18] day or at
[1:24:21] midnight but that's not the Hebrew way
[1:24:25] the Bible Way is and the
[1:24:28] evening and the
[1:24:31] morning that was the first day the
[1:24:34] evening and the morning was the second
[1:24:36] day the evening and the morning which
[1:24:39] means the day changes as the Sun is
[1:24:43] setting on the old day tonight it's
[1:24:46] sundown in God's mind a new day has
[1:24:50] begun it's
[1:24:52] Monday anybody following me
[1:24:55] this is too practical for
[1:24:59] intellectuals but it is right on time
[1:25:03] for somebody that hasn't yet learned how
[1:25:06] to operate to deal to control to bring
[1:25:10] under the blood their own feelings and
[1:25:13] emotions if you'll do it
[1:25:16] daily you take that moment to ask for
[1:25:20] God's forgiveness for how you misbehaved
[1:25:22] through the day you should every day
[1:25:26] it's not about getting saved
[1:25:28] again it's about keeping all the dead
[1:25:31] cats off the line do you believe what we
[1:25:34] say and do can hinder our prayers it can
[1:25:37] hinder our blessing it can hinder God's
[1:25:40] favor in our lives so we want to get
[1:25:43] that taken care of why not look at God's
[1:25:46] practical advice and do it before the
[1:25:48] sun goes down that's a new day you tell
[1:25:51] yourself I'm going to bed in the
[1:25:54] beginning of a new day and when I wake
[1:25:57] up in the morning what I went through
[1:26:00] what I walked with what I dealt with
[1:26:03] what I said what was said to me it's
[1:26:07] gone
[1:26:10] tomorrow is a new day and just tell
[1:26:14] yourself that somebody said well it's a
[1:26:16] lot to tell myself well we talk to
[1:26:17] oursel all the time we don't always do
[1:26:20] it verbally but in our mind we're
[1:26:22] talking so say something good to
[1:26:24] yourself I'm not carrying this into the
[1:26:27] next day Jesus has Set Me Free I don't
[1:26:31] know how it's going to be worked out in
[1:26:33] the natural but in the spiritual it's
[1:26:36] settled I'm not carrying
[1:26:39] it you know we're so
[1:26:43] stubborn Amen brother we we're so
[1:26:47] stubborn I'm not going to let it go
[1:26:49] until he apologizes until she apologizes
[1:26:54] say Well it may be a chilly day and you
[1:26:57] know
[1:26:59] where before he apologizes or she
[1:27:03] apologizes you don't wait on
[1:27:07] them somebody said you know you just
[1:27:09] sound like you always got it you're just
[1:27:11] pretending like you always got it right
[1:27:13] I have not and I don't but I follow
[1:27:16] these practical guidelines the best I
[1:27:19] can so that I don't carry it into the
[1:27:21] new day if you carry your anger your
[1:27:26] resentment your bitterness your
[1:27:31] agitation into another day it gets
[1:27:35] bigger and what will happen and I know
[1:27:38] that you're going to just blow me out of
[1:27:40] the pull pit with an amen when I say
[1:27:43] this but what will happen is you will
[1:27:45] take it out on somebody
[1:27:50] else that has nothing to do with it
[1:27:57] and when you're called out you'll say
[1:27:59] well I I'm just going through something
[1:28:01] let me give you this good piece of help
[1:28:03] here
[1:28:05] everybody everybody is going through
[1:28:09] something tailor
[1:28:11] made tailor made by a God who knows
[1:28:16] exactly what it's going to take for you
[1:28:19] to run the race that you're called to
[1:28:22] run and get through that Finish
[1:28:25] Line I've seen some of you
[1:28:27] finishing and I know you will it's my
[1:28:31] job to keep pushing you to encourage you
[1:28:35] correct and train you but I know I've
[1:28:38] already seen some of you through the
[1:28:40] Finish Line I'm telling you when you get
[1:28:42] that in your
[1:28:44] knower when you get that in your knower
[1:28:48] and You by the spirit can sense the I
[1:28:52] don't know if it's called a Ribbon or or
[1:28:55] or what it's called but that finish line
[1:28:58] that you
[1:28:59] break when you get some uh spiritual uh
[1:29:04] knowing that that finish line is going
[1:29:08] to break across your chest because
[1:29:10] everything you need to overcome has been
[1:29:14] given to you by the revealed word of the
[1:29:16] hour you've just got to take that and
[1:29:18] figure out how to apply it in your
[1:29:21] personal life but you've already had a
[1:29:24] sense I am an
[1:29:27] overcomer when I talk to people about
[1:29:29] overcoming these kinds of things without
[1:29:32] a doubt just about at least 99% of them
[1:29:37] mentioned I did it by my confession I
[1:29:41] did it by speaking God's word over my
[1:29:43] life and over the situation I did it by
[1:29:47] a positive biblical affirmation and an
[1:29:52] affirmation is an amen
[1:29:55] if I say uh I'm going to make a positive
[1:29:58] affirmation I am an overcomer I'm saying
[1:30:02] Amen to every scripture that says I
[1:30:08] can little children I right under
[1:30:12] you that you
[1:30:15] overcome how do I know you can Jesus is
[1:30:18] saying because I
[1:30:21] did I can say I can because Jesus did
[1:30:28] and he says I
[1:30:30] can he says I
[1:30:33] have Oh you mean I got to talk to my
[1:30:35] like I said you do it all the time
[1:30:37] anyway oh that sounds like
[1:30:39] psychology I know that's what people
[1:30:42] think when they read in the Bible that
[1:30:43] we should meditate on the word they
[1:30:45] immediately think about Eastern
[1:30:47] Transcendental Meditation it doesn't
[1:30:49] mean that it means Ponder stir stew on
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:54] Med keep it on your heart and in your
[1:30:56] mind and in your mouth so that when the
[1:30:59] enemy
[1:31:00] lies you've got
[1:31:02] ammunition I don't even know what
[1:31:04] somebody might say I don't even know
[1:31:06] what off fence is good I'm going to show
[1:31:07] you real quickly again the list of the
[1:31:10] synonyms for offense and then we're
[1:31:13] going to move into the characteristics
[1:31:14] and strongholds because I I I know that
[1:31:18] it can help us if we let it annoyance
[1:31:24] there's a reason for your
[1:31:27] annoyance anger resentment
[1:31:34] indignation letting you read the next
[1:31:37] one
[1:31:41] irritation
[1:31:44] exasperation wrath displeasure
[1:31:49] disapproval
[1:31:50] dislike hard bad ill feelings
[1:31:57] disgruntlement animosity vexation
[1:32:01] aversion I have an aversion to that
[1:32:05] person
[1:32:07] opposition and enmity all synonyms of
[1:32:11] the word offense so when you think I've
[1:32:13] never been offended by what was said or
[1:32:16] done to
[1:32:17] me just remember that if you were
[1:32:20] irritated how many times did that happen
[1:32:22] to you
[1:32:25] yesterday how many times has that
[1:32:27] happened this morning how many times has
[1:32:29] that happened in this service
[1:32:33] already that you felt irritated there's
[1:32:36] a root there's something there that you
[1:32:40] need I need to discover the reason why I
[1:32:44] react that
[1:32:46] way write it
[1:32:49] down figure it
[1:32:52] out see if it
[1:32:55] it's more often a particular
[1:32:59] person see if it's more often a
[1:33:02] particular kind of
[1:33:04] situation see if it's when you begin to
[1:33:08] feel a certain way already and then that
[1:33:13] offense starts building or something
[1:33:14] begins to build see if it has an old
[1:33:17] root see if it is somehow connected to
[1:33:21] your past
[1:33:26] the reality is if we are shutting down
[1:33:30] the
[1:33:32] kingdom by our feelings and our emotions
[1:33:36] and the spirits that we entertain I got
[1:33:39] to get I got to get that sorted out I
[1:33:42] want the kingdom how many of you want to
[1:33:44] sing every day Glory Glory Hallelujah
[1:33:46] the Kingdom's marching on the truth is
[1:33:49] marching on I don't want to be giving my
[1:33:52] life for the kingdom and then shutting
[1:33:54] it
[1:33:55] down with my own
[1:34:00] irritability my own
[1:34:03] animosity you see sometimes the reality
[1:34:06] is it's rooted in Pride because we want
[1:34:10] everybody to think like we
[1:34:13] think you'd be surprised how many times
[1:34:16] I have to consciously remind myself
[1:34:20] sometimes say out loud to myself
[1:34:25] it's not
[1:34:27] right for me to expect him or
[1:34:32] her those are the only
[1:34:35] two right him or her it's not right for
[1:34:40] me to expect them to think like I think
[1:34:44] all the
[1:34:45] time because remember we're all running
[1:34:48] a race and they are
[1:34:50] processing through their filters I'm
[1:34:55] processing
[1:34:56] through my filters and we always want to
[1:35:00] hold everybody
[1:35:03] accountable as though they think like we
[1:35:06] think raised like we were
[1:35:09] raised deal with things like we deal
[1:35:11] with the you you know what we would be
[1:35:13] we would be plastic copies of one
[1:35:17] another if that was
[1:35:20] life if you compare your marriage to
[1:35:23] somebody else's marriage it's hardly
[1:35:26] ever going to measure
[1:35:29] up relationships are not going to be the
[1:35:33] same we are jealous sometime for
[1:35:37] relationships that we
[1:35:39] observe but that we're not a part
[1:35:42] of and you know that's really something
[1:35:46] that can really hold us back and cause
[1:35:50] us to live a kind of swirl in in offense
[1:35:57] you need to recognize now that you're
[1:36:00] not going to have the same kind of
[1:36:01] relationship with Joe Oh I thought I was
[1:36:05] picking a name that nobody had but we do
[1:36:09] have a Joseph let's just say Joe that's
[1:36:11] not you you're Joe Joe and we're talking
[1:36:14] about Joe one Joe single Joe everybody's
[1:36:18] not going to have the same relationship
[1:36:20] with Joe
[1:36:26] could be because Joe likes college
[1:36:30] football and you may not and and that
[1:36:34] doesn't mean you can't be friends but it
[1:36:36] means that your connection with Joe is
[1:36:39] not going to look like somebody else's
[1:36:40] connection with Joe and you know what
[1:36:42] brother that's all
[1:36:45] right and when Joe has
[1:36:49] wings hot wings you you know what I'm
[1:36:52] talking about no don't you they're they
[1:36:54] don't really belong to a
[1:36:57] buffalo they're chicken wings when Joe
[1:37:00] has chicken wings he may not invite
[1:37:04] you because when he thinks of chicken
[1:37:07] wings he thinks of college
[1:37:13] football and so he thinks of the
[1:37:17] other
[1:37:18] Feller who enjoys college
[1:37:22] football oh it's
[1:37:29] quiet I wish You' just preach the word
[1:37:33] mhm I I imagine you
[1:37:39] do when we say spirit of offense we're
[1:37:43] describing a condition where a person is
[1:37:45] sometimes
[1:37:47] trapped they they don't want to be in
[1:37:49] there they don't want to be in that
[1:37:51] place but sometimes they do most of the
[1:37:55] time they don't but they're also not
[1:37:59] taking into consideration practical
[1:38:01] biblical help when it's
[1:38:05] available some people are afraid of
[1:38:07] change I I I I don't want to say afraid
[1:38:10] of change but uh how many of you would
[1:38:13] say I don't really like change I'm not a
[1:38:15] person who really likes change let me
[1:38:17] see your hand
[1:38:24] let me let let me let me do it this way
[1:38:26] let me see the hand of somebody that
[1:38:29] loves and Embraces change when it
[1:38:34] comes oh
[1:38:40] wow well I live with one of
[1:38:43] them and I'm not quite so
[1:38:50] sure I think in order to get to the root
[1:38:53] of those few hands of course there I
[1:38:55] know I saw that Martha and and U Wesley
[1:39:00] they they and that's in fam so I kind of
[1:39:03] get that
[1:39:04] but I think it would depend on the
[1:39:07] definition of change and what kind of
[1:39:11] change now I know one thing about sister
[1:39:14] Martha is she is a
[1:39:17] flexible
[1:39:21] person so I would vote for her in that
[1:39:25] direction but I
[1:39:28] suppose that I could set in
[1:39:30] motion a
[1:39:33] change that she might not
[1:39:37] embrace you get
[1:39:39] it so it's not a a black and white
[1:39:45] answer most of us do not really like
[1:39:48] change a and here's how that can affect
[1:39:51] us in a very negative way we start
[1:39:53] building our identity around our routine
[1:39:57] around our comfort
[1:39:58] zone that means we're not flexible like
[1:40:02] sister Martha and when we're not
[1:40:04] flexible and we don't like anything that
[1:40:08] changes our
[1:40:10] routine or our
[1:40:13] schedule we sometimes hold on to our
[1:40:18] favorite definition of Who We Are
[1:40:23] so the preacher preaches doesn't matter
[1:40:25] what he says doesn't matter how the Lord
[1:40:27] moves doesn't matter how it makes
[1:40:30] sense we hold on to our favorite
[1:40:33] definition of who we
[1:40:35] are and we fear what we would be if we
[1:40:40] no longer walked with the limp because
[1:40:43] of
[1:40:44] offense but I want you to know
[1:40:47] something God knows right now exactly
[1:40:51] what you would look like smell like live
[1:40:55] like talk like drive your car like if
[1:40:58] you were rid of that stuff and I believe
[1:41:01] if we ask him he would choose that
[1:41:04] version a a a version of freedom and
[1:41:08] deliverance a version where you don't
[1:41:11] take it out on somebody else when they
[1:41:13] have nothing to do with the offense that
[1:41:15] you're carrying a version where you're
[1:41:18] not doing anything thinking anything
[1:41:20] talking anything that impede s or
[1:41:24] paralyzes the kingdom but rather your
[1:41:28] lifestyle is advancing the kingdom
[1:41:31] directive of the King of Kings and the
[1:41:34] Lord of lords in order to do that in
[1:41:37] order to let go in order to uh to Hope
[1:41:41] and build new
[1:41:43] relationships because we also build our
[1:41:45] relationships around who we are
[1:41:47] emotionally comfortable with which
[1:41:50] usually means the person who will not
[1:41:52] challenge us
[1:41:57] you know in a prayer line I hope you're
[1:41:59] listening in a prayer line brother
[1:42:02] brandom bow your head close your eyes
[1:42:06] when this Spirit comes out it's going
[1:42:09] somewhere you want to be reverent you
[1:42:12] want to be there in faith how many times
[1:42:14] did we hear him say wait a minute what
[1:42:15] is
[1:42:17] that paraphrasing a bit but you'll
[1:42:19] remember the points he said my there's a
[1:42:23] Spirit back
[1:42:25] there calling out to a spirit over here
[1:42:28] for help you know we do the same
[1:42:33] thing we have a tendency to
[1:42:39] gravitate toward
[1:42:41] people who carry what we
[1:42:44] carry we should if it's a healthy holy
[1:42:48] spiritual
[1:42:50] DNA but if it's a spirit of isol
[1:42:53] ation or false
[1:42:56] definition because somebody told us we
[1:42:58] were an introvert and we believed
[1:43:01] it somebody told us what color we are or
[1:43:05] what our anagram was or whatever you
[1:43:07] call all of that and and we believed it
[1:43:10] and we settle for it and we defined
[1:43:13] ourselves that way and when we do that
[1:43:15] then we then we hold on to the things
[1:43:18] that are negative as well as the things
[1:43:20] that are positive and God said you're a
[1:43:22] new creature
[1:43:24] I don't care how how your mother had a
[1:43:26] tendency to have her feelings hurt all
[1:43:27] the time you don't have to walk in
[1:43:32] that she did because of who she is I'm
[1:43:37] not my mother you're not your mama
[1:43:40] you're not your daddy they may have been
[1:43:43] outstanding and wonderful people but we
[1:43:46] don't only inherit they're good
[1:43:48] sometimes
[1:43:49] we we get the bad too so what do we do
[1:43:53] accept it and there's no way around it
[1:43:55] absolutely
[1:43:57] not I want to divide what we're going to
[1:44:01] be talking about in the next uh little
[1:44:03] while on uh the characteristics and
[1:44:07] strongholds of offense I want to divide
[1:44:10] it into three categories if you will uh
[1:44:12] put them
[1:44:14] up there are three umbrella
[1:44:19] categories when we are looking at the
[1:44:24] characteristics of someone dealing with
[1:44:28] the spirit of offense and we will also
[1:44:32] look at strongholds that are built
[1:44:34] because of holding on to Old offense and
[1:44:39] we'll look at partnering spirits that
[1:44:42] run in and take advantage and boy if you
[1:44:44] could catch a glimpse of that it would
[1:44:46] make you uh hot red
[1:44:50] mad that the enemy is always ready to
[1:44:53] take advantage of your most vulnerable
[1:44:57] spot so you got to get that healed up so
[1:45:01] that he doesn't know how many of you'd
[1:45:02] like to strike a little confusion in the
[1:45:06] camp of the enemy because he gets inter
[1:45:09] rut just like everybody else does and he
[1:45:11] keeps trying the same old thing and one
[1:45:14] day when he comes to you with the same
[1:45:16] thing that he's run you all over town
[1:45:18] with in the past and you don't take the
[1:45:21] bait you will send a confusion through
[1:45:24] the ranks of hell they won't know what
[1:45:28] to do with
[1:45:29] you the Bible gives us this idea in
[1:45:32] Hebrew that when the chofar sounds it
[1:45:35] scatters demonic principalities and
[1:45:38] Powers your life surrendered to what God
[1:45:42] wants to make you will send a confusion
[1:45:46] through the enemy that just ripples I
[1:45:49] want him confused I want him to be
[1:45:52] looking for something
[1:45:54] because what he used to use doesn't work
[1:45:56] anymore greater is he that is in me than
[1:46:01] he that is in the world are you still
[1:46:03] with
[1:46:04] me the the self centered nature of
[1:46:14] offense selfish and unselfish alike can
[1:46:19] get offended
[1:46:23] this is not a blanket to say if you ever
[1:46:26] had your feelings hurt it's because
[1:46:28] you're self-centered that's just
[1:46:29] absolutely not accurate it's not true
[1:46:32] and that's not in any way the message I
[1:46:34] want you to take
[1:46:36] home but what I do want you to
[1:46:40] see is that
[1:46:42] sometimes instead of letting a fence
[1:46:45] just heal giving it to the Lord marching
[1:46:49] on in the spirit we nurture it
[1:46:53] we identify with it and we do that not
[1:46:58] because we are
[1:47:00] hurt we do it because we're looking
[1:47:05] out for
[1:47:07] ourself we we may look dumb but we're
[1:47:10] not
[1:47:11] dumb what I mean by that is nobody wants
[1:47:15] to see that kind of a wound
[1:47:19] repeated so we start putting up walls
[1:47:23] we go into
[1:47:25] isolation we separate ourselves from the
[1:47:27] body we separate ourselves from the
[1:47:30] lifeline which is the Living Vine
[1:47:34] amen that is a defense
[1:47:37] mechanism that's the way we most
[1:47:40] definitely like to look at it but the
[1:47:43] reality is sometimes that's another
[1:47:46] Spirit rushing
[1:47:49] in to cause us to be stuck in in it's
[1:47:53] all about
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:57] me it's all about
[1:48:02] me let me give
[1:48:05] you a small
[1:48:09] example let me say before I do it's not
[1:48:12] all about
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:16] me so let me say it's it's it's not all
[1:48:19] about
[1:48:21] you it's not always what you do that
[1:48:25] offends
[1:48:26] somebody you
[1:48:28] understand for
[1:48:31] instance um our
[1:48:34] boys are not the only
[1:48:37] boys that have ever had a car accident
[1:48:41] or
[1:48:43] girls I never
[1:48:46] dreamed that by celebrating God's
[1:48:50] grace over their lives
[1:48:56] and inadvertently
[1:49:00] others
[1:49:01] celebrating God's grace people all over
[1:49:04] the world every
[1:49:06] year when I share the memory
[1:49:09] comment they say I remember this I I I
[1:49:13] always remember this road truck I always
[1:49:18] remember uh what you said about them
[1:49:23] notes from the prayer meetings quotes of
[1:49:26] brother brandham about the
[1:49:28] mind being in the car and them crawling
[1:49:32] out over those quotes to get out of the
[1:49:35] vehicle the guy who came and cut the
[1:49:39] seat belt uh and then seemed to be gone
[1:49:45] just off into the crowd somewhere not
[1:49:48] knowing exactly where he went all of the
[1:49:52] detail uh uh when the when they finally
[1:49:55] reached
[1:49:56] me and I started in that direction Haw
[1:49:59] was here and I asked to go with me
[1:50:02] and we I prayed in
[1:50:04] tongues from here to the
[1:50:07] highway and I knew that God was moving I
[1:50:12] knew it but I I wasn't ready to quit
[1:50:14] praying yet how many of you understand
[1:50:17] that don't Lo don't don't be lost in
[1:50:19] this stay with me please and and so we
[1:50:23] saw God move and they were wanting to
[1:50:26] call an ambulance well the boys didn't
[1:50:28] want to go in the
[1:50:29] ambulance so we get in the vehicle and
[1:50:33] we go to the emergency room just to have
[1:50:35] them checked out because that was
[1:50:37] suggested because of the
[1:50:38] role and we get down there and I get
[1:50:42] royally chewed
[1:50:44] out by a doctor
[1:50:47] who said what a poor parent I was
[1:50:52] because I didn't allow them to be taken
[1:50:54] by ambulance not to this hospital he
[1:50:58] said they should have been taken
[1:51:00] immediately to a trauma
[1:51:02] center and properly
[1:51:06] evaluated and if you remember any of the
[1:51:09] testimony before it was over he sort of
[1:51:13] apologized for his behavior and he said
[1:51:16] I can see that you have an incredibly
[1:51:18] strong bond with your
[1:51:20] sons I Just sh shared it I just shared
[1:51:24] the story again and again and again and
[1:51:26] again because it's my
[1:51:29] story to share I didn't
[1:51:32] know that that that someone was offended
[1:51:37] by
[1:51:39] that because although I rushed to the
[1:51:44] scene when their family was in an
[1:51:47] accident followed this through I rushed
[1:51:52] I was there I I was
[1:51:56] concerned I
[1:51:58] cared there was no rolling of the car
[1:52:02] there was no real damage to the family
[1:52:05] thanks be to
[1:52:07] God but I was
[1:52:09] there I helped relatives I did anything
[1:52:13] I could I seems to me like I may have
[1:52:17] held a
[1:52:18] dog which is not something I normally
[1:52:20] would do
[1:52:23] but I did what I would know to do
[1:52:26] there's many of you that have had
[1:52:27] accidents that I didn't rush to the
[1:52:29] scene you understand don't you but I
[1:52:33] prayed and I cared I didn't know that
[1:52:36] every time I told that and every time
[1:52:38] you mentioned it and every time the
[1:52:41] memory showed up on social media that I
[1:52:44] was upsetting that
[1:52:46] person more and more and more because
[1:52:49] I'm made over it's not about
[1:52:54] you it wasn't about
[1:52:57] me I didn't know that I was shoving that
[1:53:00] in anybody's face I thought I was giving
[1:53:03] God glory for it it never occurred to me
[1:53:07] that by celebrating what God had done
[1:53:10] for my family I I
[1:53:12] was you see when I say we're going to
[1:53:16] have a testimony service I I'm expecting
[1:53:19] you to give your testimony
[1:53:23] I'm sorry but I get a little more time
[1:53:26] to talk than you do when you come to
[1:53:28] church I I know that is kind of not
[1:53:31] stacked in your favor but if there's a
[1:53:34] testimony service and you don't get up
[1:53:36] and tell it that's not my fault but when
[1:53:39] it comes to my mind I'm going to tell I
[1:53:42] am I am going to tell what the Lord has
[1:53:46] done so even though it wasn't my fault
[1:53:50] even though my intention was only to to
[1:53:52] give God praise somebody was offended
[1:53:55] already at
[1:53:57] me
[1:53:59] see and every time I praised God for
[1:54:02] what he had done it was driving that
[1:54:05] wound that offense deeper and deeper and
[1:54:08] deeper not because of what I was saying
[1:54:12] because of what the enemy was
[1:54:14] saying blah blah blah it's always about
[1:54:17] your family see that wasn't me saying
[1:54:20] that that wasn't even the person saying
[1:54:23] that that was the enemy and he does a
[1:54:26] good job let's don't lift him up but he
[1:54:30] does a good job and one offense
[1:54:32] compounds on another offense it
[1:54:34] compounds and how do you finally find
[1:54:36] out that you're because one day somebody
[1:54:40] finally blurts it
[1:54:44] out and you might not be like
[1:54:48] me but my reaction is not always
[1:54:52] oh I see oh my wow oh my
[1:54:56] goodness I
[1:55:00] understand this is a Eureka moment it's
[1:55:03] really
[1:55:04] quiet this is a Eureka moment for me how
[1:55:07] I had no idea that every time I give God
[1:55:12] praise I was driving a dagger deep down
[1:55:15] in your heart so oh my I repent and
[1:55:19] apologize and and I'll never give God
[1:55:22] praise
[1:55:24] pleas I don't always react that
[1:55:27] way sometimes someone else's offense to
[1:55:32] you can
[1:55:35] sound oh
[1:55:38] foolish Petty but I promise you yours
[1:55:43] mind never
[1:55:47] sounds Petty to me I can't get mad at
[1:55:50] you if you don't react the same way do
[1:55:52] to my
[1:55:54] hurt and you can't get mad at me if in
[1:55:57] fact I just
[1:55:59] said
[1:56:03] wow oh
[1:56:07] my and that wasn't
[1:56:09] right that wasn't
[1:56:12] enough but it was all I could do at the
[1:56:15] moment it was like opening up a window
[1:56:19] and looking in and seeing that a
[1:56:22] situation had gotten so
[1:56:25] bad that even in a moment where there
[1:56:29] was no ill
[1:56:31] intent at
[1:56:33] all that bitterness that resentment that
[1:56:36] wound starts with a wound had fased so
[1:56:41] that everything that was said or done by
[1:56:44] the by the
[1:56:48] offender seemed like a personal attack
[1:56:50] or a personal death are going deeper
[1:56:54] have you ever been
[1:56:56] there that's the
[1:56:58] moment that you and I have to realize
[1:57:01] it's not all about
[1:57:05] us it may not be that you have done it
[1:57:09] on
[1:57:10] purpose you may have and if you if you
[1:57:13] have you've got to make that right with
[1:57:15] God and
[1:57:16] man but you can't carry
[1:57:20] something that's not yours to
[1:57:24] carry sometimes the characteristics and
[1:57:28] strongholds of offense are rooted in a
[1:57:32] deeper
[1:57:33] issue in the self centered nature of
[1:57:37] offense this is how it behaves easily
[1:57:42] provoked prideful Behavior self
[1:57:49] focus I've been there
[1:57:52] I know how this
[1:57:54] works number two the stronghold of
[1:57:58] bitterness the characteristics of an
[1:58:02] offense that
[1:58:04] has multiplied into
[1:58:07] bitterness has its own set of
[1:58:10] characteristics bitterness holding
[1:58:13] grudges
[1:58:16] unforgiveness and then there is another
[1:58:20] subcategory and that is characteristics
[1:58:23] or
[1:58:25] behaviors that would fall under the
[1:58:27] heading of divisive effects of
[1:58:33] offense and here they are
[1:58:37] isolation
[1:58:40] misinterpretation
[1:58:42] gossip
[1:58:45] division now when I made that
[1:58:48] list I knew that some people would
[1:58:51] question the first
[1:58:54] characteristic how is it that isolation
[1:58:58] is
[1:59:04] divisive you're
[1:59:06] sending a
[1:59:08] message of
[1:59:11] division see and we' we've we've all
[1:59:14] we've all played that little game before
[1:59:17] whether it was a invite to
[1:59:20] dinner or
[1:59:22] a string of services
[1:59:24] missed or whatever it was we often use
[1:59:29] it for an excuse of taking care of you
[1:59:33] know Personal Care is such a big issue
[1:59:36] and one's own mental health is so
[1:59:38] important and we often say things like
[1:59:41] I'm just taking some time for
[1:59:44] me and I understand the need for that
[1:59:48] kind of a thing but we should make sure
[1:59:51] that we're not moving in
[1:59:56] divisiveness when we're trying to take
[1:59:58] care of our selves you see the answer is
[2:00:03] yes you are your brother's
[2:00:08] keeper that's the answer and when we
[2:00:11] isolate ourselves because our our wound
[2:00:15] or we have been offended or hurt it it
[2:00:20] usually Roots back to the pride
[2:00:22] to the self
[2:00:26] focus because we're looking after
[2:00:29] ourself and we're forgetting forgetting
[2:00:31] about other
[2:00:34] people you know it's like it's like
[2:00:37] people saying let me see if I can let me
[2:00:40] see if I can stir this up even
[2:00:42] more it's like you you must really enjoy
[2:00:45] this not at all in fact I was thinking
[2:00:48] that I would say to brother gley I
[2:00:50] almost said it to him this morning
[2:00:53] lately I am
[2:00:55] enjoying
[2:00:57] studying more than
[2:01:01] preaching why don't you and I tag
[2:01:04] team I'll do the
[2:01:07] studying and you preach the
[2:01:11] notes because the delivery is not the
[2:01:15] part I
[2:01:20] enjoy well thank you so so much I wasn't
[2:01:22] fishing for a compliment I think that's
[2:01:25] that was your way of renigging on the on
[2:01:27] the
[2:01:34] arrangement so we we don't want to be we
[2:01:37] don't want to fall into any of these
[2:01:39] categories of self-nature self-centered
[2:01:42] nature of offense the stronghold of
[2:01:44] bitterness the divisive effects of
[2:01:47] offense because none of that is the kind
[2:01:50] of behavior that you and I want amen I
[2:01:52] mean that I know that you you've got to
[2:01:56] understand this I believe I can say this
[2:01:58] with a
[2:01:59] wide
[2:02:01] sweep you don't
[2:02:04] want
[2:02:06] this so I don't want you to feel like
[2:02:09] you've become the the
[2:02:11] target I'm preaching this to expose it
[2:02:15] not to break you down and cause you to
[2:02:18] think that this is who you are this is
[2:02:21] not who are this is what the enemy tries
[2:02:24] to do to it he tries to paint
[2:02:27] us and it
[2:02:29] works because we listen come on I'm a
[2:02:34] new
[2:02:35] creature I'm a new
[2:02:38] creation I don't have to be what I was
[2:02:40] yesterday if I don't want to be because
[2:02:43] his mercies are new Every Morning his
[2:02:45] grace is alog together sufficient come
[2:02:49] on so now we move on
[2:02:52] characteristics of the spirit of offense
[2:02:54] it's partnering
[2:02:55] Spirits understanding how the spirit of
[2:02:58] offense operates a and the spirits that
[2:03:02] often
[2:03:03] accompany uh offense is for me I believe
[2:03:07] it's crucial for spiritual warfare for
[2:03:11] understanding who the enemy
[2:03:13] is I could go into a a
[2:03:17] long
[2:03:18] uh maybe Rabbit Trail here by
[2:03:22] reminding you I'll do it most briefly
[2:03:26] that we're not fighting one
[2:03:29] another you know if if that was the
[2:03:32] case then you go your way I go my way
[2:03:35] and I'm a new man and you're a new
[2:03:39] man right I mean that would seem to make
[2:03:43] sense but this is not flesh and
[2:03:48] blood this is about spiritual war it's
[2:03:52] about principalities and powers and
[2:03:57] darkness even in high
[2:03:59] places th this is about a
[2:04:02] war from Hell against
[2:04:05] you brother brandom is the one who put
[2:04:08] the focus on it he's the one who said
[2:04:11] the last battle yes sir sir is the
[2:04:15] Battle of the mind it's fought on the
[2:04:17] Battlefield of the Mind that's good
[2:04:22] it's not bad it's good because you own
[2:04:26] the
[2:04:28] battlefield come on you possess it
[2:04:32] you've got Authority in it your name is
[2:04:36] on the deed of this we are taking his
[2:04:39] mind while slowly losing
[2:04:42] ours the Apostle Paul didn't want it to
[2:04:45] be that way he wanted us to be able to
[2:04:47] lose ours and take Christ's
[2:04:51] but we understand that as the wickedness
[2:04:54] of every age
[2:04:56] compounded that we are now in a greater
[2:04:59] battle than the one the church in
[2:05:02] Ephesus
[2:05:05] fought that's why we don't believe that
[2:05:07] healing
[2:05:09] stopped and miracles stopped and Gifts
[2:05:12] stopped once we got to the end of this
[2:05:15] thing that's why we're not
[2:05:17] cessationists because we actually
[2:05:19] believe that although their
[2:05:22] circumstances seem harder to us the
[2:05:26] reality is the spirit of the age grew
[2:05:29] darker and darker and darker Wicked
[2:05:33] compounded itself and the days the
[2:05:37] scripture said become increasingly
[2:05:40] evil so even though now we're not facing
[2:05:45] Nero and the and and being burned at the
[2:05:49] stake and killed for our faith even
[2:05:53] though we're not dealing with the the
[2:05:56] Dark
[2:05:57] Ages we're actually fighting a greater
[2:06:01] battle in this hour than has ever been
[2:06:04] fought before but here's the good
[2:06:08] news you own the
[2:06:12] battlefield the enemy is a trespasser
[2:06:15] here it's really here but you know if
[2:06:18] you're thinking mind you're going to
[2:06:19] think here your mind doesn't live in
[2:06:22] your brain you know that don't you your
[2:06:25] mind lives in your heart not the pump
[2:06:28] but the seat of emotions did you know
[2:06:30] there's another part of your body that's
[2:06:32] also identified with your emotions and
[2:06:34] that's your kidney or your
[2:06:36] bowels there's a whole scripture study
[2:06:39] wow is it a good one not time for it
[2:06:42] today but it talks about the bowels of
[2:06:46] Christ he we're not talking about his
[2:06:49] intestines or his colon
[2:06:52] we're talking about a place where we
[2:06:55] could say the base
[2:06:58] nature of a person
[2:07:02] dwells that's why the anointing often
[2:07:05] draws from the lower quadrant of the
[2:07:08] body the
[2:07:10] stomach or the
[2:07:12] kidneys is because there's a whole lot
[2:07:15] you're holding on
[2:07:18] to that's affecting your physical body
[2:07:22] brother Brandon began to understand it
[2:07:25] before brain
[2:07:27] science I mentioned the other day that
[2:07:30] brother Brandon was ahead of his time in
[2:07:32] a lot of things and one of them was
[2:07:34] brain science can you imagine a grammar
[2:07:38] school
[2:07:39] education and the Brain scientists were
[2:07:42] saying that you are stuck with the brain
[2:07:47] you're born
[2:07:49] with meaning there is no no way to
[2:07:53] change the brain you're born with
[2:07:56] brother brandham knew better than that
[2:07:59] he began to talk about it they must have
[2:08:01] thought he was pretty crazy
[2:08:04] too and then later brain science caught
[2:08:08] up and they began to call it
[2:08:13] neuroplasticity which means it doesn't
[2:08:16] matter the brain you're born with you
[2:08:20] have the ability by the design of the
[2:08:23] Creator to
[2:08:25] challenge and
[2:08:28] improve the
[2:08:29] brain that you have that that's pretty
[2:08:33] incredible and may I just mention to you
[2:08:36] that Big
[2:08:41] Max and french
[2:08:44] fries that never need
[2:08:49] Refrigeration you can come back and get
[2:08:52] them 10 years
[2:08:54] later and they look about the
[2:08:57] same because they were never living in
[2:09:00] was quiet I'm sorry president
[2:09:04] Trump they were never living in the
[2:09:06] first place but it's just quick you know
[2:09:09] to run through there may I just tell you
[2:09:11] that Quarter Pounders
[2:09:16] and that will not
[2:09:19] improve so we are are faced with the
[2:09:24] decision there's also a way to transform
[2:09:27] your brain by the way you
[2:09:30] think even though your thinking doesn't
[2:09:33] originate up here it originates down
[2:09:35] here brain scientists secular brain
[2:09:38] scientists are now saying that you have
[2:09:42] the ability to
[2:09:44] replenish brain
[2:09:46] cells that have been damaged or lost
[2:09:52] by
[2:09:53] thinking a different way imagine that
[2:09:57] imagine that my thoughts can physically
[2:10:03] transform a real
[2:10:06] organ in my body no wonder the scripture
[2:10:10] says we are
[2:10:12] fearfully and what wonderfully made if I
[2:10:17] own the
[2:10:19] battlefield then I have a authority over
[2:10:23] the Rules of
[2:10:26] Engagement do you
[2:10:28] understand
[2:10:30] under past
[2:10:33] administrations in the US government The
[2:10:36] Rules of Engagement have not only
[2:10:39] changed in the
[2:10:41] Army but they've changed in many
[2:10:44] different areas of life for
[2:10:48] instance when you and I were growing up
[2:10:51] if someone went into a department store
[2:10:55] and grabbed an arm full of
[2:10:59] clothes they were risking their
[2:11:04] lives they could have been
[2:11:07] shot The Rules of Engagement were
[2:11:10] different
[2:11:12] then if not
[2:11:15] shot definitely
[2:11:18] tackled in my lifetime I I've seen them
[2:11:25] drug parisians years ago Peach Tree Mall
[2:11:30] I don't go anymore course you don't go
[2:11:33] to pan just gone I saw a young man grab
[2:11:37] a stack of
[2:11:39] clothes hundreds of dollars worth of
[2:11:42] clothes run out the
[2:11:44] door and I saw a Salesman that I knew a
[2:11:47] salesperson that I knew chase him to the
[2:11:51] park parking
[2:11:53] lot not to get the clothes to get
[2:11:57] him tackled him to the
[2:12:00] ground drag him by one
[2:12:04] foot through the parking lot up the
[2:12:08] curb that was fun into the store and
[2:12:13] said hold out your
[2:12:15] hands he was not a security guard he was
[2:12:18] a
[2:12:20] salesperson somebody brought him
[2:12:22] handcuffs not
[2:12:24] anymore when I was in
[2:12:29] Pennsylvania at the wedding of
[2:12:32] Amy and whatever her man's name
[2:12:35] is what is it
[2:12:39] Justin we were in a mall there one day
[2:12:42] and someone stole something and ran out
[2:12:45] the door and a woman who worked there
[2:12:47] chased
[2:12:49] him calling out to him please don't do
[2:12:53] this please don't do
[2:12:55] this and she came back in and I was
[2:12:58] ready to check out and I overheard her
[2:13:00] being thoroughly chewed
[2:13:04] out she said you have broken policy you
[2:13:08] are told to turn your
[2:13:11] head and not say a
[2:13:14] word The Rules of Engagement have
[2:13:17] changed and that's why people can break
[2:13:20] through the windows of the
[2:13:21] store take things out and the security
[2:13:26] guard his gun is never drawn he never
[2:13:29] blows a whistle he never raises his
[2:13:31] voice because the Rules of Engagement
[2:13:34] have changed well let me tell you
[2:13:36] something there they haven't only
[2:13:37] changed in the
[2:13:38] natural they the the enemy has tried to
[2:13:41] change them on this last battlefield but
[2:13:45] you own
[2:13:47] it he he uses tricks that he would have
[2:13:52] never successfully used a generation
[2:13:56] ago because Faith was stronger and the
[2:13:59] Word was preached
[2:14:03] straighter things that trip people and
[2:14:07] uh uh uh handicap people spiritually now
[2:14:11] would have never even caused them to
[2:14:14] have a Second
[2:14:15] Glance because they would but the Rules
[2:14:18] of Engagement have changed the enemy has
[2:14:21] changed his technique in the sense that
[2:14:25] he gets more
[2:14:28] personal and he bombards
[2:14:32] us from
[2:14:34] external
[2:14:36] stimuli and then he bombards us from our
[2:14:40] inner thought
[2:14:44] life but you own the battlefield I want
[2:14:47] you to say it I own the battlefield this
[2:14:50] doesn't belong to SA
[2:14:52] Satan the seed of my emotions my mind my
[2:14:55] brain my heart my my my kidneys and my
[2:15:00] intestines if you want to say it that
[2:15:02] way liver
[2:15:06] too in every
[2:15:08] gland it's
[2:15:10] all
[2:15:12] God's he's the Creator he's given me
[2:15:16] authority over this piece of real estate
[2:15:19] that's why we're praying as it is in
[2:15:22] heaven so let it be in Earth because
[2:15:26] you're the
[2:15:27] Earth we came from dirt originally
[2:15:32] remember and so we want to see God's
[2:15:35] will established what what his mind in
[2:15:38] heaven is we want to see that happening
[2:15:41] not only around us but in us come on and
[2:15:44] so you have authority you not only have
[2:15:47] authority over this battlefield up here
[2:15:50] you you have
[2:15:53] power I know message Believers are
[2:15:55] afraid to talk about
[2:15:58] power some of them because brother
[2:16:00] brandham said it's not more power you
[2:16:02] need it's Authority and vice versa he
[2:16:04] said other other things putting the
[2:16:07] emphasis on power but let's just balance
[2:16:09] it out it doesn't do you any good to
[2:16:12] have
[2:16:13] power if you don't have the
[2:16:16] authority to use it doesn't do you any
[2:16:18] good to have authority if you you don't
[2:16:21] have something to back it
[2:16:22] up it wasn't just a
[2:16:24] badge we like using that example but it
[2:16:28] wasn't just a bad we're living in a
[2:16:29] different hour today you don't think
[2:16:32] somebody's going to stop because
[2:16:33] somebody flashes them a badge do you in
[2:16:36] this society that would be an invitation
[2:16:39] run them
[2:16:40] over can you imagine a policeman
[2:16:42] standing out in the middle of the road
[2:16:43] with a badge on telling people to stop
[2:16:45] you would stop I would stop but there's
[2:16:49] somebody three cars back from
[2:16:52] you that would hate
[2:16:56] blue defund the
[2:16:59] blue and they would just run them
[2:17:02] over the Rules of Engagement have
[2:17:04] changed but the reality is you have both
[2:17:08] power and
[2:17:10] authority and if it touches
[2:17:13] this you have authority over it so you
[2:17:17] get to
[2:17:18] decide whether a thought
[2:17:21] stays or goes whether a hurt stays or
[2:17:26] goes whether a wound stays or goes you I
[2:17:32] don't have authority over you I can beg
[2:17:34] you to let it go but I can't I can't
[2:17:37] force you or make you or Mo you you have
[2:17:40] I you can tell me oh Shake It Off don't
[2:17:44] let it bother you see but only I can
[2:17:47] make the
[2:17:49] decision I banish you you you you lie of
[2:17:53] hell I won't entertain that anymore and
[2:17:55] I won't let it affect all of my
[2:17:57] relationships is it is it isn't it a
[2:17:59] shame that one bad relationship in your
[2:18:02] life can negatively affect every
[2:18:05] relationship you have because suddenly
[2:18:08] the boss looks like your
[2:18:12] girlfriend everybody around you looks
[2:18:14] like the person you've got the biggest
[2:18:16] problem with and you
[2:18:19] lose reality
[2:18:23] and you just start living out of that
[2:18:25] place God give us
[2:18:27] strength okay number one and we're and
[2:18:30] we're just going to hit this a little
[2:18:32] bit and
[2:18:35] go the first
[2:18:38] characteristic is I have it labeled as a
[2:18:41] instead of number one easily provoked
[2:18:45] and quick to
[2:18:48] anger partnering
[2:18:51] with the spirit of anger we're talking
[2:18:53] about characteristics or behaviors of
[2:18:56] someone who is under the influence of a
[2:18:59] spirit of
[2:19:01] offense they are easily
[2:19:07] provoked can I simplify the
[2:19:12] definition
[2:19:15] Moody the moodiest
[2:19:18] people are the people that are
[2:19:21] the most
[2:19:22] easily
[2:19:24] provoked that's the voice of experience
[2:19:28] speaking I have a lot of authority to
[2:19:31] say that because I've experienced
[2:19:35] it people that are easily
[2:19:41] provoked often have to
[2:19:44] deal with a
[2:19:47] [Music]
[2:19:48] wound but the normal
[2:19:52] reaction to a Christian of being
[2:19:55] wounded would not be
[2:19:59] anger
[2:20:03] crushed might be a better
[2:20:07] word when anger shows up it's generally
[2:20:13] because it's a deeper problem are you
[2:20:17] here it's 115 it's early it's early
[2:20:22] it's usually because there's a deeper
[2:20:24] problem well let's just see what the
[2:20:25] Bible says Proverbs
[2:20:27] 14:17
[2:20:28] he that is soon
[2:20:31] angry dealth
[2:20:34] foolishly and a man of wicked devices is
[2:20:42] hated I know that we all get that we all
[2:20:47] fully understand what that says
[2:20:51] he that is soon angry dealth foolishly
[2:20:54] and a man of wicked devices is hated I
[2:20:58] know we all get
[2:20:59] that but for those who perhaps
[2:21:05] don't let's look just a little bit
[2:21:07] closer at the
[2:21:09] wording because I don't think most
[2:21:12] people walk away from that verse knowing
[2:21:15] exactly what it
[2:21:17] means to deal foolishly because you're
[2:21:19] angry quickly or what Wicked devices are
[2:21:24] the man of wicked devices is hated what
[2:21:26] are wicked devices well we can we can
[2:21:29] assume and guess and sometimes we can
[2:21:31] come up with some good things but look
[2:21:33] at what these words would say if we were
[2:21:36] looking at it in the original he who
[2:21:39] Foams up that's that's the Hebrew word
[2:21:42] that is used there the foaming up of
[2:21:46] emotion he who Foams up quickly
[2:21:51] I like it and flies into a
[2:21:56] passion deals
[2:21:59] foolishly and a man of wicked plots
[2:22:05] plans
[2:22:07] schemes is
[2:22:09] hated have you ever foamed up
[2:22:15] quickly thank you Jonathan for helping
[2:22:18] with your amens they mean a lot
[2:22:21] we're just being
[2:22:22] real foamed up quickly flies into a
[2:22:27] passion makes therefore foolish
[2:22:33] decisions dumb
[2:22:36] decisions says dumb things sometimes
[2:22:42] religious dumb things anybody with me
[2:22:46] not because he's
[2:22:48] dumb because he's a person person who
[2:22:52] has an
[2:22:53] issue with woundedness offense and and
[2:22:58] anger those operating under a spirit of
[2:23:01] offense I think you may have this you
[2:23:04] may not are easily
[2:23:08] irritated and most often take
[2:23:16] things I I I think I'm not satisfied
[2:23:19] with your reaction so I think I'm going
[2:23:22] to ask those of you who will to read it
[2:23:24] together with me
[2:23:26] slowly those operating under a spirit of
[2:23:31] offense are easily irritated and most
[2:23:35] often take things very
[2:23:40] personally the spirit of offense often
[2:23:43] manifests as a quick temper you think
[2:23:46] that someone just has a an anger issue
[2:23:50] in reality it can be that the anger is a
[2:23:54] partnering
[2:23:55] devil who comes in uh to cause you to
[2:23:59] foam up quickly so that you make foolish
[2:24:03] decisions when the root of the whole
[2:24:05] thing is not
[2:24:07] anger it's not a lack of discerning
[2:24:11] wisdom it's
[2:24:13] offense it's
[2:24:14] woundedness so even if you start working
[2:24:18] on the anger
[2:24:21] seeing some help with your anger issue
[2:24:24] maybe going to
[2:24:25] class which is not a bad idea for some
[2:24:29] folks to learn how not to get so angry
[2:24:33] so quickly it may not fix the problem
[2:24:36] because it can be that the root of it
[2:24:38] all is a woundedness that you have
[2:24:41] carried throughout your life there is a
[2:24:44] bomb there is a bomb in Gilead there is
[2:24:47] healing for your hurt and your wound
[2:24:51] there's healing you may not get the
[2:24:53] apology you're looking for the one who
[2:24:55] you would desire to hear it from may
[2:24:57] have already passed from this life you
[2:25:01] may never get that but as a
[2:25:04] Believer you have the grace and the
[2:25:08] ability to let God come
[2:25:10] in and not need the physical word I'm
[2:25:15] sorry some
[2:25:18] counselors who see the seriousness of
[2:25:22] these
[2:25:23] issues have started using a
[2:25:28] therapy that goes something like this
[2:25:31] you are pouring out your heart to a a
[2:25:35] counselor a trained
[2:25:38] professional and they turn what you say
[2:25:42] around sort of like this I want you to
[2:25:46] know that I am truly
[2:25:51] sorry that you had to face
[2:25:57] that just words from someone who only
[2:26:01] knows what you told them that's all they
[2:26:04] don't know the whole story they just
[2:26:06] know the Gory detail that you vult you
[2:26:09] know you you uncovered yourself and you
[2:26:12] told this raw
[2:26:15] emotion to a stranger that you are
[2:26:18] paying
[2:26:22] and they just simply say to you I am so
[2:26:25] sorry no one should have to be treated
[2:26:28] that way no one should ever hear those
[2:26:31] words spoken about them from someone who
[2:26:34] loves them and I'm very very sorry that
[2:26:38] you feel that
[2:26:39] way what do you think about that kind of
[2:26:42] therapy well some of you might say
[2:26:45] that's just mumbo jumbo and that's not
[2:26:48] going to be successful and that's not
[2:26:49] going to help help anybody but guess
[2:26:51] what the research says that it is
[2:26:56] unbelievably
[2:26:58] successful it's not the apology that you
[2:27:01] were looking for from the person who
[2:27:03] wounded you but it's an apology from
[2:27:06] someone who seems to care who seems to
[2:27:09] be sincere and it's just hearing the
[2:27:12] words I'm so sorry you had to go through
[2:27:18] that and all of a sudden it kind of
[2:27:20] opens up something for some
[2:27:22] folks they relive a few moments of that
[2:27:26] pain and they I'm sorry men they cry it
[2:27:30] out usually they just cry it out they
[2:27:34] just let all that pent up emotion out
[2:27:38] and they move from that con uh
[2:27:42] conversation
[2:27:43] Freer it it wasn't what they thought was
[2:27:47] going to it didn't fix everything but it
[2:27:51] said
[2:27:52] somebody
[2:27:54] understands how I
[2:27:56] feel now remember they don't know if
[2:27:59] that's just your version they don't know
[2:28:02] if you're telling the reality or if
[2:28:04] you've exaggerated the story all they
[2:28:07] know is they're they're paid to help you
[2:28:09] so they're looking for some way to help
[2:28:11] you and so they take on the role of the
[2:28:16] offender you you don't
[2:28:18] necessarily have have to pay somebody to
[2:28:22] to do
[2:28:27] that Jesus said the Bible tells us first
[2:28:32] we have a high
[2:28:33] priest who's
[2:28:38] touched I'm so sorry that I've boring
[2:28:41] some of you it's not my
[2:28:45] intention we have a high priest who is
[2:28:47] deeply touched by the
[2:28:50] feelings of our
[2:28:53] infirmities that's not just
[2:28:55] your
[2:28:57] sorto or your high blood
[2:29:01] pressure that word infirmity can mean
[2:29:05] anything that is a skew anything that is
[2:29:08] off balance in your life Jesus is
[2:29:13] touched I don't know if that counselor's
[2:29:15] touched or not but I know that he has
[2:29:18] studied and learned some way of saying
[2:29:20] something that kind of helps you to feel
[2:29:22] like at least for the moment that
[2:29:24] somebody cares but look folks the
[2:29:26] reality and if you need that get it do I
[2:29:30] encourage you to get it if you need it
[2:29:33] but everybody can't afford that
[2:29:35] everybody it's not available to every
[2:29:37] person but I want you to know there is
[2:29:41] somebody there is a friend that Stith
[2:29:43] closer than a brother you know that
[2:29:46] counselor is only going to know what you
[2:29:48] tell them but I know something somebody
[2:29:51] who knows all the stuff you didn't tell
[2:29:54] the stuff you can't face to tell the
[2:29:57] stuff you don't want nobody to know he
[2:30:00] already knows it and is
[2:30:07] touched but if you're spilling your your
[2:30:10] innards to somebody and they were to
[2:30:13] pause and say Let me let me tell you
[2:30:15] something Jesus knows and can
[2:30:20] cares he feels your pain it might not
[2:30:25] have the same
[2:30:28] effect do you know why
[2:30:31] because we religiously know
[2:30:36] that and it hasn't become a
[2:30:39] reality so it's it's just words from a
[2:30:44] stranger you are the only one who can
[2:30:48] believe those words
[2:30:50] you own this real estate and you're the
[2:30:54] only one who can choose to say I
[2:30:58] have a high
[2:31:00] priest who is touched by every one of my
[2:31:05] feelings my legitimate
[2:31:08] ones and my ignorant
[2:31:11] ones just call yourself out some of them
[2:31:15] are
[2:31:16] real and some of them
[2:31:20] may not
[2:31:21] be but I have a
[2:31:23] counselor a high priest A Healer a
[2:31:27] savior a
[2:31:31] deliverer I don't have to drive to his
[2:31:34] office I don't have to book an
[2:31:37] appointment I don't have to claim my
[2:31:40] insurance and I don't have to write him
[2:31:43] a check all I have to do is surrender my
[2:31:47] will your Council your high Prest your
[2:31:52] friend he lives on
[2:31:55] board come on he sits on the throne of
[2:31:59] your life if you've given him that
[2:32:01] place and he cares and he hears and he
[2:32:05] know well why hasn't he already done
[2:32:11] something about
[2:32:15] it I love when someone is praying
[2:32:20] and they sayl we give you
[2:32:23] permission because there's a religious
[2:32:26] spirit that
[2:32:29] responds I feel it I always have
[2:32:31] wherever I am there is a religious
[2:32:34] spirit that always responds to that line
[2:32:38] of thinking but it's right and it is
[2:32:41] real he is a
[2:32:44] gentleman and he will knock that's right
[2:32:47] after all the Book of Revelation tells
[2:32:49] us he's standing at the door of his own
[2:32:51] church knocking wanting to get in you
[2:32:54] have
[2:32:56] authority you and I our faith our belief
[2:33:00] Our Hope in the moment is what makes us
[2:33:04] available to him so to say Lord I Give
[2:33:08] You full
[2:33:11] sway I give you permission to be the
[2:33:14] high
[2:33:15] priest I want you to feel what I feel
[2:33:20] and I want you to help
[2:33:23] me to be healed and whole so that I
[2:33:27] don't ever feel that way again I
[2:33:30] challenge you not to try to decide what
[2:33:33] is a legitimate feeling and what is an
[2:33:36] illegal one that you've picked up along
[2:33:37] the way I challenge you instead of
[2:33:40] trying to sort them give them all give
[2:33:43] them all we used to sing that song give
[2:33:46] them all Shattered Dreams
[2:33:50] wounded
[2:33:51] Hearts who knows the next line and
[2:33:55] broken
[2:33:58] toys we've sung that in
[2:34:01] church broken
[2:34:05] toys I I get Shattered Dreams and broken
[2:34:08] heart and wounded Hearts but Broken Toy
[2:34:11] he is a high priest touched by the
[2:34:15] feeling of our infirmities
[2:34:21] I've lost a
[2:34:25] balloon I remember how it
[2:34:28] felt and you should have seen me how
[2:34:32] foolishly I acted to make sure that my
[2:34:36] children didn't lose
[2:34:40] one I've walked around all day with one
[2:34:43] tied to my
[2:34:45] arm so they could have it
[2:34:48] later because I remember exactly what it
[2:34:51] feels
[2:34:52] like as a
[2:34:54] child did you know there is most
[2:34:58] likely some stuff rolling around down in
[2:35:03] there oh it gets so you're I know I know
[2:35:07] folks are too super spiritual for
[2:35:09] this I I I'm I'm I'm preaching this to
[2:35:13] uh you know the
[2:35:17] children they're not so advanced they
[2:35:20] they I
[2:35:21] remember I remember growing up with this
[2:35:24] idea if I and I've said this before I'm
[2:35:26] not making this up along the way if I
[2:35:29] love it I'm going to lose
[2:35:33] it so I've got to be careful about
[2:35:36] loving
[2:35:37] it now as an adult I know you don't love
[2:35:40] things you should like things and love
[2:35:43] people but as a kid I loved my my dog
[2:35:50] now I'm old enough to know I I can be
[2:35:53] affectionately uh attached and I can
[2:35:55] call it love but it's not the same kind
[2:35:57] of love it's I I don't want you to get
[2:35:59] mad but it's not the same degree of love
[2:36:01] you have for your children I hope it
[2:36:04] it's different I know it's huge I know
[2:36:06] it's big I'm not trying to diminish
[2:36:10] that I I remember having a Nerf
[2:36:14] football as a kid and a and a new puppy
[2:36:17] and and anybody ought to know a new
[2:36:19] puppy and a Nerf football they don't go
[2:36:21] well
[2:36:25] together and I remember having to make a
[2:36:28] decision well I still love this
[2:36:32] puppy because he's
[2:36:34] destroyed my Nerf
[2:36:38] football my mom
[2:36:41] remarried and she married a man
[2:36:44] with
[2:36:47] issues too numerous to name
[2:36:51] he abused her seriously physically
[2:36:56] emotionally
[2:36:58] mentally and he took his anger out on
[2:37:01] anything or anyone who got in his way
[2:37:05] and he would be perfectly fine One
[2:37:07] Moment One Moment my dad really the same
[2:37:11] way one moment perfectly whole and fine
[2:37:15] and the next
[2:37:16] moment in a complete rage
[2:37:22] I had decided I would keep loving that
[2:37:25] dog and he went into a rage one day and
[2:37:28] and picked that dog up and threw it
[2:37:30] across the room not mad at me not mad at
[2:37:34] my
[2:37:34] mom I I almost
[2:37:39] cried just
[2:37:41] then
[2:37:45] see broke broke broke its
[2:37:48] bones I never saw the dog
[2:37:53] again we can think about those
[2:37:57] things and it can affect
[2:38:00] us but I know who lives
[2:38:03] here he cares about wounded
[2:38:08] Hearts Shattered
[2:38:12] Dreams and what else broken toys he
[2:38:17] cares he cares
[2:38:21] I know that children are children and I
[2:38:24] know that they can be unreasonable at
[2:38:27] times because they're not Advanced
[2:38:30] enough to reason something out and I
[2:38:32] know that we get frustrated when we tell
[2:38:34] them something and they don't understand
[2:38:37] it because we
[2:38:40] forget we forget how many times we had
[2:38:44] to be told the same thing before it
[2:38:48] registered and the reality is some of us
[2:38:51] had parents who knew how to
[2:38:55] discipline and yet we broke the rule
[2:38:58] anyway knowing there would be a
[2:39:01] punishment so if you think that just
[2:39:07] whippings will fix the
[2:39:11] issue it doesn't necessarily fix the
[2:39:14] problem it's important the Bible said so
[2:39:18] the SP in of the rod is is an
[2:39:22] unchristian unbiblical concept time out
[2:39:26] in the corner and all of that if it
[2:39:28] works okay but let's remember the
[2:39:30] scripture says if you spare the
[2:39:35] rod the scripture says
[2:39:39] hate it means you're not caring for that
[2:39:42] child's
[2:39:45] future but a spanking without an
[2:39:48] explanation
[2:39:50] is a waste of your
[2:39:52] time a child never
[2:39:55] responds to a
[2:39:57] physical without an explanation now why
[2:40:00] are you getting why why why do you
[2:40:03] deserve this banking what what's the
[2:40:05] reason why uh uh you're you're being
[2:40:07] disciplined this way and of course the
[2:40:10] answers are going to
[2:40:12] vary as a child gets
[2:40:15] older and we've got some philosophers
[2:40:17] around here
[2:40:19] when I hear some of the things these
[2:40:21] kids say to their parents I think oh my
[2:40:24] goodness they're little Geniuses walking
[2:40:27] around it doesn't take them long to
[2:40:29] learn how to uh manipulate their way
[2:40:32] right out of a
[2:40:34] situation I'm the one who put the chaita
[2:40:37] banana sticker on my forehead under my
[2:40:40] bangs and my mother said I'm going to
[2:40:42] whip you and I and I and I I don't know
[2:40:45] if I did it consciously or not but I was
[2:40:47] playing with it and I put it on my
[2:40:48] forehead head my my mother insisted on
[2:40:51] me having a a a bowl cut with bangs as a
[2:40:55] little boy and she sends me into the
[2:40:58] room and she's going to lay into me and
[2:40:59] I'm telling you my mama
[2:41:01] could she was going to lay into me and
[2:41:04] as I went to uh lean over the bed my
[2:41:06] bang slid and the chaita banana sticker
[2:41:08] showed and she burst into tears laughter
[2:41:12] and then into tears laughing so hard I
[2:41:14] don't even think it's
[2:41:16] funny but she did Hallelujah
[2:41:21] she
[2:41:25] did then she explained to me you still
[2:41:30] deserve the the spanking but I wasn't
[2:41:33] going to swing the belt while I was
[2:41:38] laughing because you need to understand
[2:41:40] what you were doing hurt my
[2:41:44] heart so I'm not going
[2:41:46] to laugh at it
[2:41:49] laugh at you and then spank you the
[2:41:53] reality is I know this is getting long
[2:41:56] the reality is we carry some of these
[2:41:59] things on a cellular level that's what
[2:42:04] brain science tells
[2:42:05] us and you have somebody who care he
[2:42:08] cares
[2:42:10] about all of
[2:42:12] it you don't have to go find him or pay
[2:42:17] him all you have to do is believe him
[2:42:20] you just have to trust him I just don't
[2:42:22] believe he cares about all these little
[2:42:24] things that that that that I think about
[2:42:27] all the time you you don't understand he
[2:42:30] does you're an extension of him you are
[2:42:33] a part of
[2:42:36] him even if your if your feeling is
[2:42:40] really something that you've just sort
[2:42:43] of
[2:42:44] made he
[2:42:46] cares he wants us thinking healthy and
[2:42:49] whole and he doesn't want us
[2:42:51] overreacting or under
[2:42:53] reacting he doesn't want us judging one
[2:42:56] another's
[2:42:57] motives he wants us to be
[2:43:00] free how many of you know it's like a
[2:43:03] burden lifted if if you ever come to a
[2:43:05] place that you can let anger go over a
[2:43:08] situation that you've been holding on to
[2:43:10] it feels like a ton of bricks has been
[2:43:14] lifted can you imagine the weight of all
[2:43:18] of my sin your sin The Whole World's
[2:43:23] sin pressed upon
[2:43:27] him as he died on the cross
[2:43:31] bearing my sin he that knew no
[2:43:35] sin carried mine and
[2:43:40] yours he knows what it means to be
[2:43:43] heavy he knows what it means to carry
[2:43:46] something that didn't belong to him
[2:43:50] he understands he
[2:43:53] cares if you foam up quickly you're
[2:43:57] going to do foolish
[2:43:59] things you're going to take things
[2:44:01] personally 139 I'm
[2:44:04] closing musicians are coming you're
[2:44:07] going to take things personally that
[2:44:09] aren't meant for
[2:44:11] you it's not about
[2:44:13] you the Huddle on the football field is
[2:44:16] not about you they're not plotting your
[2:44:21] destruction they're plotting the other
[2:44:23] team's destruction and sometimes it does
[2:44:27] them no
[2:44:29] good we're so bad at times that if we
[2:44:33] walk up and someone stops
[2:44:37] talking we know not assume we know they
[2:44:42] had to be talking about us I want
[2:44:44] everybody to hold still just a minute I
[2:44:45] want you to hear this
[2:44:49] we know they must have been talking
[2:44:50] about us let me let me give you some
[2:44:52] cold hard
[2:44:54] reality some things are simply none of
[2:44:58] your
[2:45:04] business you got to come to that reality
[2:45:06] It Ain't Easy for somebody like me to
[2:45:09] come to that
[2:45:10] reality because I'm nosy by
[2:45:14] nature and I'm willing to be transparent
[2:45:16] about it so that would be a a real
[2:45:20] foolish
[2:45:21] assumption it may just be that the
[2:45:24] details of that conversation are not
[2:45:26] meant for me it might be my
[2:45:31] surprise it might be my present they're
[2:45:34] talking about and they hush because they
[2:45:36] didn't want me to hear what they were
[2:45:38] going to buy me but my mind and my
[2:45:41] experience and my hurt and and what I've
[2:45:44] been through in life tells me that they
[2:45:46] were talking about me or somebody in my
[2:45:49] family and so what do I do I react what
[2:45:52] do you do you react oh yes you do you
[2:45:56] don't always react to the person's
[2:45:59] involved but before the day's out
[2:46:01] sometime we
[2:46:04] tell sister
[2:46:08] Sharon or sister
[2:46:10] Joyce or whoever else will listen sister
[2:46:14] Martha's flexible I don't know if she
[2:46:16] listens to that kind of stuff or not
[2:46:20] now I want you to know what can those
[2:46:22] ladies do
[2:46:25] about something that had nothing to do
[2:46:29] with
[2:46:31] them now that's what you call carrying
[2:46:34] an
[2:46:35] offense if it didn't matter you wouldn't
[2:46:37] have told it to somebody
[2:46:39] else you would have told you would have
[2:46:41] said to the oh you girl you
[2:46:44] girls I walked up you hushed I thought
[2:46:48] you were talking about
[2:46:52] me and they might they might say we
[2:46:57] were they might say no it wasn't about
[2:47:00] you but we we just want to keep this
[2:47:02] pretty
[2:47:04] quiet you can't be offended at
[2:47:09] that everybody needs somebody to talk to
[2:47:11] I get all of that but you need to
[2:47:14] understand that if you're carrying an
[2:47:17] offense and you don't dump it on
[2:47:19] somebody else when the scripture never
[2:47:21] tells us to handle it that
[2:47:26] way you may be
[2:47:31] transferring your offense there's a lot
[2:47:35] of people carrying something that has
[2:47:36] nothing to do with
[2:47:38] them oh
[2:47:42] my I hope you paid your tithes or else
[2:47:45] you are getting a lot of free therapy
[2:47:47] today
[2:47:50] I hope it's biblically based I think and
[2:47:53] feel that it's biblically based I think
[2:47:56] it's bigger Among Us than we realize I
[2:48:00] know you think I'm spending too much
[2:48:02] time but I really believe that it's more
[2:48:05] important than what we realize so
[2:48:08] important that he called it the last
[2:48:10] battle and if we can win that battle
[2:48:12] we've won the victory Crown Hallelujah
[2:48:15] we've won the victory Crown let let me
[2:48:18] give you one quotation for for for the
[2:48:24] purists there are so many but I didn't
[2:48:27] get to them script to the scriptures
[2:48:29] either but let me give you this one the
[2:48:31] resurrection of Jesus and if you notice
[2:48:35] it's when you're
[2:48:37] discouraged that's when the
[2:48:42] devil sounds to me like brother bam knew
[2:48:46] about it it's when you're discouraged
[2:48:49] that's when the devil can really pour it
[2:48:50] on
[2:48:51] you that's when he gets you if you come
[2:48:54] to the church and say well I don't know
[2:48:56] I don't know whether I'll ever get any
[2:48:58] better or
[2:49:01] not I've been prayed for
[2:49:05] twice brother Shelly prayed twice as
[2:49:08] long for
[2:49:11] her Oh my he said you might as well go
[2:49:15] home that's all but when you can cast
[2:49:19] that God help me somebody say God help
[2:49:24] me when you can cast that aside God
[2:49:26] don't want you to be
[2:49:30] frowning God wants you to be you can't
[2:49:33] put on happiness that's be phony but
[2:49:36] you've got a lot to be happy about the
[2:49:39] human heart was made to be
[2:49:43] happy you that's not just an off-handed
[2:49:45] comment that's science again it's not
[2:49:47] all evil
[2:49:49] some of it is confirming the
[2:49:53] scripture
[2:49:56] worry
[2:49:58] will let me have a little water we're
[2:50:04] done
[2:50:06] worry will cause cancer that's a thought
[2:50:11] it's not just an emotion worry is based
[2:50:13] on a
[2:50:15] thought don't know to go
[2:50:19] I don't know what I'm going to
[2:50:21] do did you know you actually don't help
[2:50:24] your family 1
[2:50:26] ounce by worrying over
[2:50:30] them you only help them by praying for
[2:50:35] them and being there for them all that
[2:50:39] hand ringing it it it's going to cost
[2:50:42] early
[2:50:44] arthritis don't do it only god listen we
[2:50:49] Face situations in our families that
[2:50:52] only God can move help fix save
[2:50:59] deliver amen and and just because I ask
[2:51:02] you to pray doesn't mean I'm worried
[2:51:03] that's not what I'm say but I'm talking
[2:51:05] about all those uh moments that we sit
[2:51:08] and we ruminate and we worry and we're
[2:51:10] concerned and what's going to come of
[2:51:12] them when I'm gone and who's going to
[2:51:14] pray for them then and and what's going
[2:51:17] to happen then that is not helping them
[2:51:21] your faith is what's going to help them
[2:51:23] the most somebody standing before God
[2:51:26] and interceding on their behalf and
[2:51:28] calling their names before the Lord
[2:51:31] that's what's going to make a difference
[2:51:33] let me tell you what's going to make a
[2:51:34] bigger difference than that you and I
[2:51:36] getting rid of all that we carry that is
[2:51:41] stopping the advancement of the
[2:51:46] Kingdom our prayers are affected by what
[2:51:49] we
[2:51:51] carry woundedness that we won't let go
[2:51:54] of can hinder our prayers anger that we
[2:51:57] won't seek deliverance from can hinder
[2:52:00] what how we pray no wonder we're
[2:52:03] worried because we can't have confidence
[2:52:05] in our own prayer because we know what
[2:52:08] we carry and we
[2:52:11] refuse to turn it loose brother brandham
[2:52:14] said worry will cause cancer temper temp
[2:52:19] let's all say temper that's another way
[2:52:22] of saying angry temper will cause
[2:52:28] cancer what is cancer it's a deformity
[2:52:33] of the cell it starts with a cell that
[2:52:38] is becomes
[2:52:41] deformed and that deformed cell
[2:52:47] multiplies and it
[2:52:49] generates another cell exactly like
[2:52:54] itself it was doing that before when it
[2:52:57] was a healthy cell it was multiplying
[2:53:00] out a healthy cell but now that that
[2:53:03] cell is not
[2:53:05] dead scientifically it'd be better if it
[2:53:07] would have really just
[2:53:09] died because you all have those kinds of
[2:53:12] cells we all have those kinds of sick
[2:53:15] cells in our body right now that's the
[2:53:17] reality they just
[2:53:20] die but if they make themselves again if
[2:53:24] they multiply then the next cell looks
[2:53:26] exactly like this unhealthy cell and the
[2:53:29] next thing you know the unhealthy cells
[2:53:32] are are are joining together and what
[2:53:35] makes a a a cell unhealthy it can be
[2:53:38] environment it can be food it can be
[2:53:42] genetics but more and more they're
[2:53:45] discovering that it can be
[2:53:52] thoughts what
[2:53:56] thoughts what you
[2:53:59] think what fills your
[2:54:02] heart will fill your
[2:54:04] mind it'll fill your mouth and it will
[2:54:08] affect the cells does it mean that every
[2:54:11] person who has cancer because it can be
[2:54:14] genetic it can be environmental there
[2:54:16] are so many factors that can cause
[2:54:19] there's so many kinds of cancer did you
[2:54:23] know that you can have breast cancer in
[2:54:24] your
[2:54:25] [Music]
[2:54:29] kidneys it's such a
[2:54:33] unbelievable
[2:54:39] reality but here a prophet is saying
[2:54:42] worry can cause a cell to be deformed
[2:54:45] and multiply itself as cancer temper can
[2:54:48] cause because that's what that's the
[2:54:50] root of
[2:54:51] it and he tells us that it is a
[2:54:56] spirit that there's a spirit behind
[2:54:58] cancer well what is
[2:55:01] worry it's
[2:55:03] unbelief anybody with me it's unbelief
[2:55:06] what's the only sin brother brandom told
[2:55:07] us there was everything else comes out
[2:55:09] of that unbelief so is that right does
[2:55:12] that make sense and temper someone
[2:55:15] thinking that a that that an angry spell
[2:55:18] a temper
[2:55:20] tantrum is going to fix
[2:55:22] anything slamming a door is going to fix
[2:55:25] anything hanging up on someone is going
[2:55:27] to fix anything how many of you know it
[2:55:29] doesn't fix
[2:55:31] anything and then here is I I'm not my
[2:55:35] my temper is not necessarily my problem
[2:55:38] sometimes I worry that's not my big
[2:55:40] problem but here's my problem don't
[2:55:43] never be upset
[2:55:49] never be
[2:55:53] upset I know this Prophet is not telling
[2:55:56] us to be
[2:55:56] [Music]
[2:55:58] phony what is he telling us don't ever
[2:56:01] be
[2:56:02] upset he's telling us to walk in
[2:56:05] peace Faith confidence come
[2:56:09] on don't let what happens to
[2:56:15] you affect you
[2:56:20] don't let it cause
[2:56:23] unbelief to inadvertently creep up in
[2:56:27] your life walk in his love somebody said
[2:56:31] I don't like all
[2:56:33] these modern worship
[2:56:36] songs all they talk about is his
[2:56:42] love it won't hurt you sweetheart to
[2:56:45] sing about his
[2:56:46] love if you you need to know much more
[2:56:49] about him I I can preach it to you but
[2:56:52] when you're worshiping him you ought to
[2:56:54] keep in mind his faithfulness his
[2:56:57] goodness his wonderful works and his
[2:57:01] love sing about his love because brother
[2:57:04] brandom tells us if we can
[2:57:06] walk in his love knowing that you're
[2:57:10] walking in him if you're walking in his
[2:57:13] love knowing that you're walking in him
[2:57:16] and nothing can what there's neither
[2:57:20] Powers things present things future
[2:57:24] nothing can separate us from him we're
[2:57:27] in
[2:57:28] him and we never come in by our own
[2:57:33] will he by choice elected us and I'll
[2:57:38] let you read the rest as you're
[2:57:41] standing and brought us
[2:57:44] into him
[2:57:50] who would have ever
[2:57:53] thought that being easily irritated or
[2:57:59] agitated can be connected to
[2:58:03] anger that finds a
[2:58:05] root in a
[2:58:09] fence it's Satan's way of turning
[2:58:11] something legitimate into something
[2:58:15] destructive you can't always help your
[2:58:18] feelings from getting
[2:58:19] hurt but you can make a conscious choice
[2:58:25] and a conscious decision not to let it
[2:58:29] partner with
[2:58:31] anger with agitation with irritation
[2:58:34] with
[2:58:37] frustration I'm preaching to myself you
[2:58:41] thought it's getting on to you no I'm
[2:58:43] preaching to
[2:58:45] myself I want the kind of peace
[2:58:49] why don't you listen over the course of
[2:58:51] the next couple weeks to the stature of
[2:58:55] a perfect
[2:58:56] man had I gotten to it we would have
[2:58:59] covered some of that and we will when
[2:59:01] we're together again hear
[2:59:04] it because there's only so much that we
[2:59:08] can do to help
[2:59:11] ourselves most of the time the best
[2:59:14] thing that we can do is give up and let
[2:59:17] Jesus
[2:59:19] Jesus if if you don't hear that in the
[2:59:21] stature of a perfect man you didn't
[2:59:23] listen to the end of the
[2:59:25] tape he tells it you got to have this
[2:59:28] virtue and to your virtue you got to
[2:59:30] have faith and to your faith you got to
[2:59:32] and then you got to have brother
[2:59:34] kind and then he tells
[2:59:37] us it's not about the
[2:59:39] doing it's about the
[2:59:43] yielding if you leave here because you
[2:59:45] think I've got more homework than I
[2:59:47] could ever sort through
[2:59:49] and I could never correct any of these
[2:59:50] things you're going to miss the point
[2:59:52] the point is this it's not what you
[2:59:55] do after you
[2:59:57] surrender that makes a difference it's
[3:00:00] staying
[3:00:03] surrendered I I don't know if you heard
[3:00:05] that I'm going to make sure you did it's
[3:00:08] about
[3:00:09] staying
[3:00:12] surrendered how how do you you just keep
[3:00:14] saying
[3:00:15] yes that little nudge this says you know
[3:00:18] you ought to go you ought to you ought
[3:00:19] to send that text you you you ought to
[3:00:21] smile you you ought to go hug somebody
[3:00:23] you ought to shake yield to that
[3:00:27] nudge just do
[3:00:29] it don't tell me tomorrow I almost said
[3:00:32] so so I almost do it do it do
[3:00:37] it don't wait till somebody called you
[3:00:39] and they say I was about to call you
[3:00:41] uhuh don't do that let that
[3:00:45] nudge be something that you begin to
[3:00:47] trust
[3:00:49] God's trying to work something out if
[3:00:52] you and I will let him isn't he
[3:00:56] faithful he's so
[3:01:00] so
[3:01:05] faithful let's just be quiet a moment
[3:01:07] before him
[3:01:26] just another minute
[3:02:02] thank you
[3:02:03] sweet sweet
[3:02:08] Lord Precious Jesus thank
[3:02:14] you thank you
[3:02:18] thank you that you thought we were worth

[3:04:05] Purity you don't see us today as the
[3:04:08] flawed and broken people that we feel
