[55:06] allowed God to use for us
[55:10] today Acts chapter
[55:14] 17 again we welcome all of you into the
[55:16] house of the Lord if you're able to
[55:19] would you stand with us while we read
[55:21] the scripture acts chap 17 starting in
[55:24] verse 16 all the way through the end of
[55:28] the
[55:31] chapter now while Paul waited for them
[55:34] at Athens his Spirit was stirred in him
[55:38] when he saw the city wholly given to
[55:43] idolatry therefore disputed he in the
[55:45] synagogue with the Jews and with The
[55:47] Devout persons and in the market daily
[55:49] with them that met with him then certain
[55:52] philosophers of the epicurian and of the
[55:54] stoics
[55:55] encountered him and some said what will
[55:59] this blabber
[56:01] say other some he seems to be a set or
[56:04] forth of strange
[56:06] Gods because he preached unto them Jesus
[56:10] and the
[56:11] resurrection and they took him and
[56:14] brought him to AR
[56:16] aroop saying may we know what this new
[56:20] doctrine is whereof you
[56:22] speak for thou bringest certain strange
[56:25] things to our ears we would know
[56:27] therefore what these things
[56:29] mean for all the Athenians and
[56:32] strangers which were there spent their
[56:35] time in nothing else but either to tell
[56:39] or to hear some new
[56:41] thing then Paul stood in the midst of
[56:44] Mars Hill and said you men of
[56:47] Athens I perceive that in all things ye
[56:51] are too
[56:53] superstitious for as I pass passed by
[56:55] and beheld your devotions I found an
[56:57] altar within this inscription to the
[57:00] unknown
[57:01] God whom therefore you ignorantly
[57:05] worship him I declare unto
[57:10] you God that made the world and all
[57:12] things therein seeing that he is Lord of
[57:14] Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples
[57:17] made with hands neither is worshiped
[57:19] with men's hands as though he needeth
[57:21] anything seeing he giveth all giveth to
[57:25] all life and breath and all things and
[57:29] hath made of one blood all nations of
[57:32] men for to dwell on all the face of the
[57:34] Earth and hath determined the times
[57:38] before appointed and the bounds of their
[57:44] habitation that they should seek the
[57:46] Lord if happily they might feel after
[57:50] him and find him though he be not far
[57:54] from every one one of
[57:55] us for in him we live and move and have
[58:02] our
[58:03] being as certain also as of your PO own
[58:07] poets have said for we are also his
[58:11] offspring for as much then as we are The
[58:14] Offspring of God we ought not to think
[58:16] that the godhead is like under gold or
[58:18] silver or stone Graven by art or man's
[58:21] device and the times of this ignorance
[58:24] God winked at but now commandeth all men
[58:28] everywhere to
[58:30] repent because Heath appointed a day in
[58:33] the which he will judge the world in
[58:35] righteousness by that man whom he hath
[58:38] ordained whereof he hath given Assurance
[58:41] unto all men in that he hath raised him
[58:44] from the
[58:46] dead and when they heard of the
[58:48] resurrection of the
[58:50] Dead some
[58:52] mocked and others said we will hear thee
[58:56] again of this matter so Paul departed
[59:00] from among among them how be it certain
[59:02] men clave unto him and believed among
[59:06] the which was dianus the AR agapite and
[59:10] a woman named deeris and others with
[59:13] them may the Lord add a blessing to the
[59:16] reading of his word you can have your
[59:18] seats
[59:23] today
[59:25] now it's been two weeks since I've been
[59:27] in service with you traveled a few miles
[59:30] since I've been here but glad to be back
[59:33] among you and all of you are welcome
[59:35] here in the service and we just want to
[59:37] see what the Lord would speak to us here
[59:40] in this service God met us in the camp
[59:44] meeting but the camp meeting is
[59:47] passed today is a new day and God is
[59:51] continually unfolding himself and we
[59:54] want want to receive anything that he
[59:57] would speak to us now uh In this passage
[1:00:01] of scripture Paul is found himself in
[1:00:04] Athens he had gone to uh
[1:00:09] thessalonica and had with
[1:00:11] him uh he had Timothy and he had
[1:00:18] Silas the scripture gives them different
[1:00:20] names along the way uh Silas is also
[1:00:24] when you read the book of Thessalonians
[1:00:26] you find that his name becomes sylvanus
[1:00:29] but that is also Silas and timotheus is
[1:00:32] timoy but these two men were with Paul
[1:00:35] in thessalonica and and it seemed like
[1:00:38] everywhere Paul went he stirred up
[1:00:41] trouble it it wasn't his
[1:00:45] intention but Paul had received such a
[1:00:51] transformation from the hand of God till
[1:00:55] that wherever he went he was stirring up
[1:00:59] trouble now the the the reason that he
[1:01:01] stirred up trouble was because Paul at
[1:01:04] one time was a devout
[1:01:07] Jew and when he was a devout Jew and he
[1:01:11] started seeing all these Christian
[1:01:14] Believers he saw them in such a way till
[1:01:17] that he hated
[1:01:19] them this Jesus that came on the scene
[1:01:23] uh dis erupted all of the plan of the
[1:01:27] Jewish Scholars all of the Jews that had
[1:01:31] some prestige in the temple it it
[1:01:34] disrupted the plan that was going on
[1:01:37] there because all of the people that
[1:01:41] these Jewish Scholars the rabbis all of
[1:01:44] these men they thought that they had a
[1:01:47] captive audience and that they would
[1:01:49] never lose them these were men who
[1:01:53] planted fi fear in the
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:58] people preachers that planted fear in
[1:02:02] the people if you ever leave my church
[1:02:05] you're
[1:02:08] lost and Paul was a part of that yes he
[1:02:13] was a part of that clergy that put such
[1:02:16] a fear in the people that if they ever
[1:02:20] left a particular synagogue or a
[1:02:22] particular doctrine of the teachers that
[1:02:25] they were sure to be uh uh black marked
[1:02:29] in some way or another until that they
[1:02:31] could never uh have a fellowship again
[1:02:36] but the fear that those clergy had over
[1:02:41] the people was broken when Jesus Christ
[1:02:46] stepped on the scene and he had a such a
[1:02:49] message of
[1:02:51] Deliverance until that it broke woke the
[1:02:55] spirit of fear over the
[1:02:57] people the scripture tells us in the New
[1:03:00] Testament that God did not give us the
[1:03:03] spirit of
[1:03:05] fear man has a tendency to do that to
[1:03:08] put fear in the people but God did not
[1:03:11] give us Fe fear he gave us power he gave
[1:03:15] us love and he gave us a sound mind so
[1:03:19] if you feel powerless today or if you
[1:03:23] feel afraid or if you feel like that
[1:03:25] your mind is not sane God did not put
[1:03:29] that
[1:03:30] there God gave us such a cleansing and
[1:03:35] such a power from on high that we can
[1:03:39] walk free from the power of fear from
[1:03:43] the power of feeling powerless we can
[1:03:47] walk in the Holy Spirit to such a
[1:03:50] measure such a degree till all of that
[1:03:53] is broken out of our
[1:03:54] lives that is exactly what we are trying
[1:03:58] to preach in these last days that the
[1:04:01] people will not walk under the fear of
[1:04:04] the past as we heard in cam meeting that
[1:04:07] we don't have to remain feeling dropped
[1:04:10] or forgotten in any way but that the
[1:04:13] spirit of the Lord would come in such a
[1:04:16] way until that when we feel
[1:04:23] friendless
[1:04:25] that we know that on the inside abides a
[1:04:29] friend that sticks closer than a
[1:04:33] brother I just pondered about feeling
[1:04:37] friendless or feeling ousted or feeling
[1:04:41] like nobody likes me as I was reading
[1:04:44] this scripture about Paul because
[1:04:48] Paul when he was a part of that Jewish
[1:04:52] sect with the San hedrin and the
[1:04:55] Pharisees and he was looked up
[1:04:58] to he had a lot of
[1:05:01] prestige he had a lot of
[1:05:04] friends he had a lot of people whom he
[1:05:08] was well respected by them and they
[1:05:11] would come to him for counsel and they
[1:05:13] would come to him and say Paul or Saul
[1:05:16] at the time what do you think about this
[1:05:18] scripture what do you think about this
[1:05:20] thought and and he was one of those
[1:05:23] where that he was building those extra
[1:05:25] fences out there to try to keep the
[1:05:28] people in line and keep them in fear but
[1:05:31] when he met the Lord Jesus Christ on his
[1:05:35] way to
[1:05:37] Damascus and he had such a transforming
[1:05:40] experience with the Lord that it changed
[1:05:43] all of his clout with all of the
[1:05:47] Pharisees it changed all of his
[1:05:50] friendships it changed everything
[1:05:53] because now the one that had been
[1:05:56] chasing the Christians now became the
[1:06:02] chased and all of those people that he
[1:06:05] thought were his friends they were no
[1:06:07] longer calling him friend and Paul
[1:06:11] became an outcast to all of those to all
[1:06:15] of that crowd that he had been with and
[1:06:18] God started putting different people
[1:06:20] back in his life but all of that comfort
[1:06:23] and all of that uh feeling of security
[1:06:27] that he had had before it was all gone
[1:06:30] right now you talk about a guy that felt
[1:06:34] friendless you talk about a guy that
[1:06:36] felt ousted a guy that felt like that
[1:06:39] nobody cared about him the Apostle Paul
[1:06:42] when he was being chased by this one and
[1:06:45] chased by that one and put in prison and
[1:06:48] put on a ship when he told him you
[1:06:50] better not sail it because we're going
[1:06:52] to end up in shipwreck but they didn't
[1:06:54] listen to him and so he had to ride out
[1:06:57] the storm with the rest of them but God
[1:07:00] gave a promise they'll not be any loss
[1:07:02] of life no loss of
[1:07:06] life so Paul kind of he kind of felt
[1:07:10] friendless but as he submitted himself
[1:07:14] to the will and plan of God and
[1:07:17] preaching Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:07:20] and not just crucified but Resurrected
[1:07:24] yes and when he preached this kind of a
[1:07:27] Doctrine everywhere he went he was
[1:07:29] stirring people
[1:07:31] up because everywhere he went he didn't
[1:07:35] go to the first church of the
[1:07:39] nazarenes he didn't go down to the
[1:07:41] United Methodist Church he did not go to
[1:07:45] Word of Life or New Hope he didn't go to
[1:07:48] this one or that he went to the
[1:07:51] synagogues where were the Jews Jews in
[1:07:55] the
[1:07:56] synagogues because Paul had a compassion
[1:07:59] for his own people because he recognized
[1:08:03] that they were as lost as he
[1:08:07] was they were as far away from God as he
[1:08:11] had been until he met Jesus on the road
[1:08:15] to Damascus and he fell off of his high
[1:08:18] horse and fell on his face before the
[1:08:21] Living God and he said who who are you
[1:08:27] Lord who are you
[1:08:31] Lord
[1:08:33] now this is difficult for us to
[1:08:36] understand sometimes because Paul was
[1:08:39] one of those who studied all of the time
[1:08:42] he studied in the synagogue and he tried
[1:08:44] to give the people plenty to think about
[1:08:48] and he was always giving out
[1:08:52] words he was was an eloquent
[1:08:55] preacher he was able to dish out the
[1:08:58] words all the time and he was doing the
[1:09:01] best he could with what he had to work
[1:09:04] with but he needed a born again
[1:09:07] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:10] now he didn't have the opportunity to
[1:09:12] walk with all the
[1:09:15] disciples while Jesus was on the earth
[1:09:19] and uh in the book of Acts we can find
[1:09:21] that he was even one of those who uh was
[1:09:24] standing there as a young man and he he
[1:09:27] was a zealous kind of a guy the Bible
[1:09:30] tells us that when Steven was preaching
[1:09:33] that Paul saw of Tarsus he was holding
[1:09:37] the coats of these other men as they
[1:09:39] were casting the
[1:09:44] stones
[1:09:46] and little did Paul
[1:09:50] know that he was about to have a
[1:09:52] lifechanging EXP
[1:09:56] experience when God got a hold of him
[1:10:00] and he started preaching to these people
[1:10:03] wherever he went so when he gets to
[1:10:06] thessalonica he starts preaching to
[1:10:08] these women and uh some of them they
[1:10:12] believed and others of them they didn't
[1:10:14] like what Paul was preaching and even to
[1:10:18] the point that there was one Believer by
[1:10:20] the name of Jason and they went into his
[1:10:23] house to to try to escapee some of the
[1:10:26] chaos that was going on in the streets
[1:10:28] and and the the people started uh
[1:10:31] getting a hold of Jason and drugg him to
[1:10:34] court and Jason had to pay a fine they
[1:10:37] let him go but the Bible tells us that
[1:10:40] because of all of this chaos that Paul
[1:10:43] ends up leaving thessalonica and he goes
[1:10:45] to Athens Athens Greece and while he's
[1:10:49] in Athens he didn't go find a hole to
[1:10:52] hide in right
[1:10:55] now he left
[1:10:57] behind Silas and
[1:11:00] Timothy in
[1:11:03] thessalonica and he left behind people
[1:11:06] wanting to take him out and so they felt
[1:11:09] that it was better for Paul to go on to
[1:11:11] Athens and so as Paul goes to Athens
[1:11:14] while he was there the Bible said that
[1:11:17] his Spirit was stirred up within him now
[1:11:20] this is really the way that we should be
[1:11:27] today but we sometimes have been backed
[1:11:31] into the
[1:11:32] corner and we are told we've got to be
[1:11:35] more
[1:11:37] gentle we've got to be more politically
[1:11:41] correct we have got to uh treat people
[1:11:45] with kid gloves because as we read every
[1:11:50] day in the news this is a woke
[1:11:52] generation
[1:11:56] well I don't know what they're woke to
[1:11:58] but it ain't the gospel and they need to
[1:12:01] be woke to the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:05] Christ and Mambi pambi Christianity is
[1:12:09] not going to get
[1:12:11] it now I understand that we'll never be
[1:12:15] able to shove it down people's
[1:12:17] throats because at the end of the day
[1:12:22] you can't see it unless unless God opens
[1:12:24] your
[1:12:27] eyes but it did not keep Paul from
[1:12:31] preaching it did not keep Paul from
[1:12:34] telling about the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:12:37] while he's in Athens his Spirit was
[1:12:39] stirred in him because the people were
[1:12:43] wholly given to
[1:12:52] idolatry
[1:12:54] now this is where a preacher could get
[1:12:56] himself in a heap of
[1:12:59] trouble
[1:13:02] because Paul was out in the
[1:13:06] streets his Spirit was stirred within
[1:13:09] him because he was in Athens
[1:13:12] Greece and idolatry was all around
[1:13:19] him but
[1:13:21] we get into trouble
[1:13:23] even inside of the church these days if
[1:13:27] we start talking about the idolatry of
[1:13:31] the
[1:13:32] people inside of
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:37] here but
[1:13:39] we are all
[1:13:42] facing these
[1:13:44] situations where Through The Years God
[1:13:47] has had to deal with the idolatry in our
[1:13:52] lives
[1:13:53] right whether it be things that we wear
[1:13:57] things that we participate in or things
[1:14:00] that pull us away from the Living God
[1:14:03] and capture our attention more than the
[1:14:06] attention that we give to the Lord Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ
[1:14:19] tomorrow is a
[1:14:21] holiday in the world old
[1:14:25] Halloween and we have seen such idolatry
[1:14:30] creep into
[1:14:32] churches around this message of truth
[1:14:35] I'm not even talking about denomination
[1:14:38] I'm talking about churches that say they
[1:14:41] believe this truth and yet they
[1:14:44] participate in this demonic holiday
[1:14:47] called Halloween and they they they
[1:14:50] dress up and they go and do particip a
[1:14:54] in all of the things that the world does
[1:14:56] now
[1:14:59] friends
[1:15:00] why why why would we participate in
[1:15:05] something that people who have come out
[1:15:08] of
[1:15:09] Satanism tell us that it is a demonic
[1:15:12] holiday and that it is all got demons
[1:15:15] all embedded in it why would we still
[1:15:18] participate in
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:24] because these things have become Idols
[1:15:26] in our
[1:15:27] life I ask the question
[1:15:31] why why do
[1:15:34] people go to the store and
[1:15:39] buy creepy looking
[1:15:43] things and they buy this St I don't even
[1:15:46] know what it's called but it's to
[1:15:47] represent a spiderweb and they put it
[1:15:50] all over their
[1:15:51] house I just want to tell you if I walk
[1:15:55] through the woods I want a stick in my
[1:15:57] hand to knock the spider webs down I
[1:16:00] don't really want to encounter the
[1:16:01] spiders why would I add some to my
[1:16:04] home it's ridiculous to
[1:16:07] me and it's a
[1:16:10] participation of the dark side of things
[1:16:13] until that we as Christian Believers if
[1:16:16] we say anything about it even in the
[1:16:19] modern church we get uh really Stones
[1:16:22] Throw us not maybe literally but people
[1:16:25] don't like to hear it because they don't
[1:16:28] like their idolatry to be preached
[1:16:33] about but that is what it is it is
[1:16:36] idolatry because it is participating in
[1:16:39] another kingdom other than the kingdom
[1:16:42] of the Living
[1:16:43] God and we've got to break down every
[1:16:47] Idol in our life because the Lord is
[1:16:50] calling to us for a total separation
[1:16:54] from all our
[1:16:56] unbelief all of
[1:16:59] it is there still some in me yes there
[1:17:02] is I don't like to admit that but I am
[1:17:06] still here fighting the battle with you
[1:17:08] and I realize that there's unbelief in
[1:17:11] me and I cry out to the Lord I believe
[1:17:14] help my
[1:17:16] unbelief help me with my unbelief I
[1:17:19] don't want to be an unbeliever in any
[1:17:21] way I want to look into the scripture
[1:17:24] and I want to find what belongs to me
[1:17:27] and I want to say yes
[1:17:30] Lord I want the same response that those
[1:17:33] that have been before me have said in
[1:17:36] the word of God every promise is yes an
[1:17:39] amen I want that to be me I don't want
[1:17:42] idolatry in my
[1:17:44] life I don't want I don't want the
[1:17:47] Christmas trees I don't want the earbobs
[1:17:49] I don't want any of that stuff I want
[1:17:52] all of this I idolatry to be out of me
[1:17:54] because I know that it is a
[1:17:57] participation of another kingdom other
[1:17:59] than the Lord Jesus Christ now Paul he
[1:18:03] is speaking to these Athenian Believers
[1:18:06] uh or to the Athenian people rather his
[1:18:09] spirit is stirred up inside of him
[1:18:12] because he recognizes that they are just
[1:18:16] idolatrous
[1:18:20] people they're serving all kinds of
[1:18:23] things the Bible tells us that that it
[1:18:25] looks like uh in verse 29 that they are
[1:18:29] looking at this and they have Idols of
[1:18:32] gold and silver and
[1:18:34] stone and man's device Graven by man's
[1:18:41] device
[1:18:43] people want something that they can
[1:18:50] see this is the reason
[1:18:54] why that we fight with one another
[1:18:58] right because we want to see what we're
[1:19:04] fighting somebody does us
[1:19:08] wrong and we start fighting with them
[1:19:13] because it is the one that we can see
[1:19:16] who brought the offense against us and
[1:19:19] so therefore we start fighting with them
[1:19:22] right
[1:19:24] whereas it is not them but it is Spirits
[1:19:28] at work that people have succumbed to
[1:19:33] all of us
[1:19:35] guilty but as a brother said after I
[1:19:38] preached on Thursday night he said did
[1:19:40] you ever
[1:19:41] notice when je when when they were just
[1:19:45] reviling
[1:19:47] Jesus that he didn't open his
[1:19:51] mouth why did he not open his mouth
[1:19:54] because he knew he wasn't fighting with
[1:19:56] people he was dealing with spirits and
[1:19:59] principalities and Powers it's the same
[1:20:03] way with people wanting a God that they
[1:20:06] can
[1:20:06] see you go to all of these nations who
[1:20:10] have Idols in their homes I've been to
[1:20:13] India nine times and you go and you see
[1:20:16] these Idols in the home people that are
[1:20:18] supposed to be Believers but they still
[1:20:20] have a statue here or they have
[1:20:23] something you know over here a picture
[1:20:25] of some sort every restaurant that you
[1:20:27] go into the elevators and during the
[1:20:30] holidays they're burning incense and it
[1:20:32] about choke you if you try to take an
[1:20:34] elevator because they're burning this
[1:20:36] incense to their God because they want
[1:20:39] something that they can see but
[1:20:41] everything that they have that they see
[1:20:44] is something that's
[1:20:48] man-made that's how we get Idols in our
[1:20:50] life because we be become disillusioned
[1:20:55] discouraged whatever word you want to
[1:20:57] use because we can't
[1:21:00] see and we want to see and Paul
[1:21:03] recognizes that this is what's going on
[1:21:06] with these people they needed something
[1:21:09] that they could see and and he begins to
[1:21:12] preach to them and he recognizes that uh
[1:21:16] these
[1:21:17] people serve other
[1:21:20] gods and while they're serving other God
[1:21:23] Gods it doesn't mean that they won't sit
[1:21:25] around and talk about something
[1:21:31] new brother Daniel ever met preachers
[1:21:34] like
[1:21:36] that always something new always looking
[1:21:39] for something new and that's the way
[1:21:42] these people were and so Paul he stands
[1:21:46] up on Mars Hill and he starts preaching
[1:21:49] to him and he says I perceive that
[1:21:51] you're too superstitious
[1:21:55] bunch of religious nuts yeah that don't
[1:22:00] have a clue what you're talking about
[1:22:04] you've got an inscription up here on the
[1:22:07] rock that says to the unknown God and
[1:22:10] you don't even know what you're
[1:22:11] worshiping because men have come along
[1:22:14] and they have given you a form of
[1:22:16] godliness but they've denied the power
[1:22:20] thereof it's really what Paul was
[1:22:22] preaching to
[1:22:23] them you've got this inscription up here
[1:22:28] and you don't even know what you're
[1:22:29] worshiping and and because you can't see
[1:22:32] this unknown God you decided to take
[1:22:35] matters into your own hands and you get
[1:22:37] a candle here and you get a statue here
[1:22:40] and you get another thing over here and
[1:22:42] it becomes idol
[1:22:46] worship because you want something that
[1:22:48] you can
[1:22:49] see see see see see
[1:22:55] now I find it very
[1:23:00] interesting that Paul did not tell these
[1:23:06] people that their unknown God was an
[1:23:12] idol he said you've got this inscription
[1:23:16] up here and you're worshiping
[1:23:21] ignorantly come
[1:23:23] on you're ignorant about who the unknown
[1:23:27] God is and you have by your own
[1:23:33] imaginations taken your hands and you
[1:23:37] have taken some gold you've taken silver
[1:23:41] you've taken some candles you've taken
[1:23:44] some Stone you've taken this product or
[1:23:47] that product and you've set it up there
[1:23:51] and you worshiped it and and you're just
[1:23:53] ignorantly
[1:23:54] worshiping but Paul came to tell the
[1:23:57] people I want you to know it's all in
[1:24:00] ignorance what you're doing you have not
[1:24:03] a clue but I am coming to tell you that
[1:24:06] that unknown God is the god that made
[1:24:09] all things he made the
[1:24:12] world and I realize you can't see
[1:24:18] him you're not going to worship
[1:24:21] Him
[1:24:22] by making an idol you're not going to
[1:24:25] worship Him by anything that you can
[1:24:29] make with your own hands you're not even
[1:24:31] going to be able to uh uh come up with
[1:24:34] an idea to make you think that you know
[1:24:37] what you're doing but it's going to take
[1:24:39] a revelation of the spirit of God in
[1:24:41] your lives and so Paul is just
[1:24:44] expounding to them that this one that
[1:24:47] they have so ignorantly worshiped right
[1:24:51] through the years
[1:24:54] is the very same one who had walked the
[1:24:56] Earth just a few years
[1:24:59] prior Jesus Christ now see the people
[1:25:04] because that they had conjured up an
[1:25:06] idea in their mind as to what this uh
[1:25:09] unknown God was they made no connection
[1:25:12] between the Lord Jesus Christ walking on
[1:25:15] the earth and their unknown God they
[1:25:18] made no connection
[1:25:20] there because to them
[1:25:23] Jesus was just another man he was just
[1:25:26] another individual walking around on the
[1:25:28] earth and and the people there were some
[1:25:31] people who were responding to him now
[1:25:33] see when Jesus was walking on the earth
[1:25:35] there were people that had all sorts of
[1:25:37] opinions about him some say that he's a
[1:25:40] prophet
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:43] right
[1:25:44] now those that were
[1:25:47] saying some say he's a
[1:25:51] prophet did they receive the prophet's
[1:26:02] message you know it's it's the same
[1:26:04] thing that we say today they say so and
[1:26:07] so and so and so so and I always ask who
[1:26:10] is
[1:26:13] they who is
[1:26:15] they some say that he's a prophet who is
[1:26:19] some and are these some believe that
[1:26:22] he's a prophet or are they just
[1:26:24] repeating what somebody else
[1:26:27] said and we get in the same boat this is
[1:26:31] how rumors get started as
[1:26:33] well because one says one thing and the
[1:26:37] next one repeats it with a little twist
[1:26:39] to it and somebody else repeats it with
[1:26:41] a Different Twist to it and by the time
[1:26:43] that it gets back to the original voice
[1:26:45] it's nothing like the original
[1:26:47] voice that is why we always have to take
[1:26:50] anything that anybody says preachers
[1:26:52] included back to the word it has to lay
[1:26:57] in the pages of the word because we
[1:27:00] don't want to be those that say some say
[1:27:03] he's a
[1:27:04] prophet some say he's the Apostle some
[1:27:08] say he's John the Baptist some say he's
[1:27:12] Elias but who do you
[1:27:16] say who do you
[1:27:20] say who do you say say he is
[1:27:24] well we know the response that Peter
[1:27:26] gave
[1:27:29] him but remember when they originally
[1:27:33] gave Jesus the answer they were
[1:27:36] listening to all of the
[1:27:38] voices about what people were
[1:27:41] saying and that continued through
[1:27:44] Jesus's life Jesus there there were
[1:27:47] still people that say you know this
[1:27:50] Jesus he's up there he's got a big cow
[1:27:52] out and you know they tell me he fed
[1:27:54] 5,000 with just a little bit of
[1:27:57] food well reckon who he
[1:28:00] is well you know some are saying that
[1:28:03] he's Elijah
[1:28:07] returned yeah I heard that he last week
[1:28:11] he fed 4,000 people and you know this is
[1:28:15] just really strange this this seems to
[1:28:18] be God but I wonder who he is well they
[1:28:22] tell me that he came from Nazareth and
[1:28:25] his mother's name is Mary and his
[1:28:27] father's name was Joseph and he worked
[1:28:29] in the carpenter shop a while and then
[1:28:31] he decided to do this itinerate
[1:28:34] preaching see all of these
[1:28:37] voices but eventually it comes down to
[1:28:40] that Jesus is asking you as an
[1:28:42] individual as he did Peter who do you
[1:28:47] say now we can take all of these
[1:28:50] instances where we watched him feed the
[1:28:52] 5,000 we watched him feed the 4,000 we
[1:28:54] watched him do uh Miracles uh and we
[1:28:58] watched the the wine the water be turned
[1:29:00] to wine at canaa of Galilee and we
[1:29:02] watched all of these Miracles and we can
[1:29:06] spout off all of those
[1:29:08] Miracles and still wonder in our mind
[1:29:11] who is he but there comes a time where
[1:29:14] that we have to make a decision who is
[1:29:20] he and when the revelation of Jesus
[1:29:24] Christ comes into our life where we can
[1:29:26] say this is none other than the Lord
[1:29:29] Jesus Christ God come down in the
[1:29:33] flesh the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:29:36] was in
[1:29:38] him and when he was finished on the
[1:29:41] earth he went back to the father and he
[1:29:43] said I'm going to send you another
[1:29:44] comforter and he PR sent the promise of
[1:29:46] the Holy Ghost and we saw the
[1:29:48] Fulfillment of the Holy Ghost coming to
[1:29:50] the Believers on the day day of
[1:29:52] Pentecost then we have to say with a
[1:29:55] heart uh
[1:29:57] Lord I
[1:30:01] believe that when you were on the earth
[1:30:04] in you was the very Spirit of the Living
[1:30:08] God who created heaven and earth and
[1:30:10] when you were done on the earth you were
[1:30:13] done with that body you went back to the
[1:30:15] original place and you sent your spirit
[1:30:18] and divided it among the Believers so
[1:30:20] that we could have that very same
[1:30:24] Spirit do you know that the spirit of
[1:30:28] God when he gives you the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:31] not just so that you can speak in
[1:30:32] tongues on although that's part of it
[1:30:36] it's not just so you can shout that's
[1:30:37] part of it but when he gives you his
[1:30:40] spirit it's so that you can identify the
[1:30:45] word when the word comes and is preached
[1:30:49] into your life there's something inside
[1:30:52] of you it's the word agreeing with the
[1:30:56] word it's the life of Jesus Christ that
[1:31:00] is agreeing with that very word that he
[1:31:03] was demonstrating while he was here on
[1:31:05] the earth in the form of Jesus Christ in
[1:31:08] that body that that he was living
[1:31:11] in now all of these all of these Jewish
[1:31:16] people that were around Paul they didn't
[1:31:19] like him preaching that so they s send
[1:31:21] him to Athens now he's dealing with a
[1:31:23] bunch of
[1:31:27] heathens and when he tells he tells
[1:31:30] these
[1:31:33] heathens I mean I'm I'm not being trying
[1:31:37] to make them
[1:31:40] of
[1:31:42] nothingness because that's not what Paul
[1:31:44] preached to them right Paul began to
[1:31:48] preach to
[1:31:49] them I am a Jew
[1:31:53] but I am here to tell you that this
[1:31:56] inscription that you've got up here on
[1:31:57] the rock that says to the unknown God I
[1:32:00] am here to tell you that you are
[1:32:02] ignorantly worshiping
[1:32:06] him and I I don't know that the
[1:32:09] scripture gives in complete detail all
[1:32:12] that Paul said so I'm going to add lib a
[1:32:15] little bit here all right so Paul he's
[1:32:17] saying you know this this rock up here
[1:32:22] actually Paul was right there on the
[1:32:24] Rock preaching to
[1:32:29] them can you imagine this
[1:32:32] guy Jewish but had had an experience
[1:32:36] with the Lord Jesus Christ and now he
[1:32:39] has been told you know it's not safe
[1:32:41] here at Jason's house why don't you go
[1:32:43] on ahead of us to Athens we'll we'll
[1:32:45] come and we'll come and get up with you
[1:32:46] a little later but why don't you go to
[1:32:48] Athens and and maybe you can just settle
[1:32:51] down a little a little bit and you can
[1:32:52] have a little rest and and and we'll
[1:32:55] yeah lay low we'll we'll we'll come
[1:32:56] after a while and uh you know there's
[1:32:59] too many spirits stirred up here and and
[1:33:02] so you know you need to get out of town
[1:33:04] Paul and so they sent him on I don't
[1:33:06] think Paul really wanted to go but they
[1:33:08] sent him on to Athens and when Paul got
[1:33:10] to Athens he realizes that he's right in
[1:33:13] the middle of of such a den of
[1:33:16] vipers
[1:33:17] idolators people that are reaching into
[1:33:21] demonic to try to pull something out but
[1:33:24] all the while on this rock they have
[1:33:26] this inscription to the unknown God
[1:33:28] ignorantly
[1:33:29] worshiping the Bible says they were
[1:33:31] ignorantly worshiping now I am not going
[1:33:35] to get into uh how what do they call it
[1:33:39] the semantics of it maybe uh I'm not
[1:33:41] going to get into that but here Paul is
[1:33:43] standing on this rock and he's talking
[1:33:45] to these people that have all of these
[1:33:48] Idols now I don't know exactly because I
[1:33:52] figure by the time that Paul got there
[1:33:55] that they did not just have a relic
[1:33:58] sitting in their home or sitting at the
[1:34:01] altar of the unknown God but they
[1:34:03] probably by that time had figured out a
[1:34:06] ring or a necklace or a bracelet or
[1:34:08] something with the inscription uh of
[1:34:11] their imagination to this unknown God
[1:34:13] they were trying to carry this God with
[1:34:16] them wherever they went because
[1:34:19] everybody is looking for something to
[1:34:22] worship so Paul is standing here on this
[1:34:26] rock and he says you're ignorantly
[1:34:28] worshiping but I want to tell you that
[1:34:31] what you're worship the way you're
[1:34:33] worshiping is not the correct way to
[1:34:35] worship because God is not this unknown
[1:34:39] God that you're trying to worship is not
[1:34:41] something that can be made by hands or
[1:34:43] seen with your eyes it is something that
[1:34:46] he is he is one who has walked on the
[1:34:49] earth and now he's gone back to this
[1:34:51] place he resurrected and this same God
[1:34:55] has taken all
[1:34:57] peoples and put them under one
[1:35:00] blood no longer is there a separation
[1:35:03] between Jew and
[1:35:07] Gentile see on one hand he's dealing
[1:35:09] with the Jewish people who for so long
[1:35:12] have tried to bring the correct offering
[1:35:14] year after year after year to stay in
[1:35:17] fellowship with God and and most likely
[1:35:20] because that the Pharisees wanted to
[1:35:23] keep the people under their thumb they
[1:35:25] wanted to keep the the the tithe and
[1:35:28] offering coming into the into the uh
[1:35:30] into the temple uh they kept them under
[1:35:33] their thumb and so they would tell them
[1:35:36] you need to do this and you need to do
[1:35:38] this and you need to do this and it was
[1:35:41] outside of the Scripture it was outside
[1:35:44] of what God had mandated in the Old
[1:35:46] Testament but yet these Pharisees as
[1:35:49] they're sitting together and they're
[1:35:51] constantly talking day after day after
[1:35:53] day and writings and talking and
[1:35:55] writings and and they're the you know
[1:35:58] they're just always taking notes and and
[1:36:01] coming up with ideas because they're men
[1:36:04] and after a while they create these
[1:36:06] fences that are pushing the people
[1:36:08] further and further and further away
[1:36:10] from
[1:36:12] God and so then Jesus comes
[1:36:18] along and all of these people who were
[1:36:22] living under fear of the preachers of
[1:36:25] the
[1:36:26] Pharisees now Jesus comes along with a
[1:36:30] message that looks so much more inviting
[1:36:32] than what they have done through the
[1:36:36] years and people begin to come to him
[1:36:40] and it causes these leaders to become
[1:36:45] angry upset obsessed with
[1:36:50] killing
[1:36:51] the same ones this you know you start
[1:36:55] thinking about what the people have uh
[1:36:58] uh have gone through and they've been
[1:37:00] told all of their life Thou shalt not
[1:37:04] murder so now how do these Pharisees get
[1:37:07] around the fact that they want to murder
[1:37:13] people now we're not talking about the
[1:37:17] Gentiles we're talking about their own
[1:37:20] Jewish blood uh
[1:37:23] murder when they have a commandment Thou
[1:37:26] shalt not murder but the preachers are
[1:37:28] telling
[1:37:30] us this is a sect of religion that we've
[1:37:33] got to abolish we've got to do away with
[1:37:35] it we can't let it get out of hand we're
[1:37:37] going to lose our control over the
[1:37:40] people and so they're you know they're
[1:37:41] sending people out to do murder uh of
[1:37:44] these Believers in in Jesus Christ and
[1:37:48] after a
[1:37:50] while
[1:37:52] how do you how do you take care of that
[1:37:57] situation because really what they're
[1:37:59] doing is they're now they're giving a
[1:38:02] gospel to the
[1:38:04] people that is not what was intended
[1:38:08] from the
[1:38:09] start so we have to call it another
[1:38:12] gospel
[1:38:14] right and the people now have to make a
[1:38:20] substitution
[1:38:24] because they're only taking the word of
[1:38:27] the Pharisees that's right they're
[1:38:29] taking the word of the preachers they're
[1:38:31] taking the word of those that study the
[1:38:34] law but now Jesus Christ The Living Word
[1:38:39] has stepped among
[1:38:42] them and he starts
[1:38:45] defying their
[1:38:49] teachings thou sayest
[1:38:55] that's right and he lays
[1:39:03] out but I say unto
[1:39:06] you if a man looks upon a woman to lust
[1:39:09] after
[1:39:10] her he has committed adultery already
[1:39:13] with her in his
[1:39:17] heart you know the law said don't commit
[1:39:20] adultery
[1:39:22] but Jesus comes along and he sees the
[1:39:24] way that the preachers have Twisted the
[1:39:27] word the way that they have manipulated
[1:39:30] the word to to uh help themselves right
[1:39:35] to try to cover up their own sin right
[1:39:39] and but all the while trying to keep
[1:39:42] their thumb on the people because they
[1:39:44] don't want to lose the their big church
[1:39:47] and so then Jesus comes along and he he
[1:39:51] preaches a freeing gospel to the people
[1:39:56] right the Pharisees say don't commit
[1:39:59] adultery but I'm telling you that if a
[1:40:02] man looks upon a woman to lust after
[1:40:04] he's committed adultery with her already
[1:40:06] in his heart and the people say
[1:40:09] now wait a
[1:40:13] minute I saw preacher so and so
[1:40:18] yeah I saw him the other day with a
[1:40:21] woman that wasn't his wife and he was
[1:40:24] looking at her kind of googly
[1:40:28] eyed
[1:40:31] and now Jesus is here telling us that
[1:40:35] just to look with lust we've committed
[1:40:37] adultery even though there really wasn't
[1:40:39] even an act but Jesus is laying out a
[1:40:41] diff and it starts freeing
[1:40:44] people now you might say how would that
[1:40:47] free people because people want
[1:40:52] truth they want
[1:40:54] truth they want to know exactly where
[1:40:58] they stand with God they don't really
[1:41:00] want it sugarcoated unless they want to
[1:41:03] hide but a real true believer that wants
[1:41:07] their heart right with the Living God
[1:41:09] they wanted Gun Barrel
[1:41:11] straight they want the word with power
[1:41:14] and authority and straightness until
[1:41:17] that they can get their life out because
[1:41:19] what the people really want is what
[1:41:21] these people in Athens wanted and they
[1:41:24] didn't know how to get to it they wanted
[1:41:27] a relationship with a God that they knew
[1:41:30] nothing
[1:41:31] about and so here is Paul coming and
[1:41:34] saying that as Peter did on the day of
[1:41:37] Pentecost this same Jesus whom you
[1:41:40] crucified has become both Lord and
[1:41:43] Christ both Lord and Messiah and Paul is
[1:41:46] preaching to these Believers this Jesus
[1:41:49] has come from the the Realms of Glory
[1:41:52] stepped into a human body and by the
[1:41:55] sacrifice of his own body has made of
[1:41:58] one blood All
[1:42:01] Nations so that these men could dwell on
[1:42:06] the earth and that it was a time
[1:42:09] determined before it was appointed and
[1:42:11] he's given the bounds of the habitation
[1:42:14] and Jesus or Paul is telling these
[1:42:16] people that they could reach out and
[1:42:19] they could find him
[1:42:23] now seek and you shall
[1:42:26] find knock and it shall be opened unto
[1:42:30] you all the while that that invitation
[1:42:34] is being given there's something on the
[1:42:37] inside that God has placed there that is
[1:42:40] reaching out for
[1:42:46] it what do you mean preacher well here's
[1:42:48] what I
[1:42:49] mean there are are people who can go
[1:42:52] into church or they can sit under the
[1:42:55] sound of a gospel
[1:43:00] message and they can never
[1:43:04] respond just no response
[1:43:07] whatsoever and then there are others
[1:43:09] that are just crying their eyes out
[1:43:12] there's something going on inside of
[1:43:14] them they're recognizing that Jesus is
[1:43:16] close and that he has come to help them
[1:43:19] and that they are going to respond to
[1:43:22] him now how can this
[1:43:26] be the scripture tells us that no man
[1:43:29] can come to Jesus except the father
[1:43:33] draws them there has to be a drawing
[1:43:36] from that other dimension before a man
[1:43:39] can ever respond now I wouldn't even
[1:43:41] begin to understand this except to know
[1:43:45] that God is Sovereign and that he has a
[1:43:48] timing for everything that is why we
[1:43:51] don't dismiss people that are out on the
[1:43:53] bar stools people that are uh out in sin
[1:43:56] people that uh even people that call
[1:44:00] themselves Believers and all they do is
[1:44:01] sit at
[1:44:04] home I know there are some people who
[1:44:06] can't get out
[1:44:08] Church they're just not physically able
[1:44:11] and there are other people that are too
[1:44:14] lazy and there are other people that
[1:44:17] have been
[1:44:18] hurt they keep all their standard but
[1:44:21] they're hurt and so they sit at
[1:44:25] home there are others who say church is
[1:44:28] a bunch of
[1:44:31] Hypocrites and so the hypocrit stands
[1:44:33] between them and God as brother Shelly
[1:44:37] says but there are all manner of people
[1:44:39] but when God gets
[1:44:42] ready when it's
[1:44:44] time God can come in the right season
[1:44:48] and he can lay his hand on some somebody
[1:44:51] and everybody else don't look like
[1:44:53] they're getting a thing but that one
[1:44:55] individual because it's their time
[1:44:58] because it's their
[1:45:00] time God comes with a sovereign
[1:45:04] move I ain't saying you have to cry I
[1:45:06] ain't saying you got to shout speaking
[1:45:08] to I ain't saying that all I know is
[1:45:11] that God comes at a sovereign moment and
[1:45:14] he grips the heart of somebody and he
[1:45:17] says today is the
[1:45:19] day you may understand
[1:45:22] it something may have already been
[1:45:25] happening at home and you just said I
[1:45:28] got to go find somebody to preach to me
[1:45:30] I got to find something to to try to
[1:45:33] satisfy this that's going on in me and
[1:45:35] it may be that somebody got drug into
[1:45:38] the house of the Lord and all of the
[1:45:39] sudden God says it's
[1:45:41] time no no uh no idea that it was going
[1:45:47] to happen God just says it's time and
[1:45:50] happens right here are all these Heathen
[1:45:53] people there and Paul's preaching to
[1:45:55] them and he's trying to tell
[1:46:00] them you've got this God up here there
[1:46:03] this
[1:46:06] rock I think it's just beautiful the way
[1:46:09] that God puts things
[1:46:11] together
[1:46:13] because the rock that followed them in
[1:46:16] the
[1:46:18] wilderness and then
[1:46:21] when Peter was asked who do men say that
[1:46:24] I am and he says Thou Art the Christ the
[1:46:26] son of the Living God and Jesus says
[1:46:28] Upon This Rock I'll build my church The
[1:46:31] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:46:33] it so now we got Paul standing on a rock
[1:46:36] again with an inscription that says to
[1:46:38] the unknown
[1:46:42] God it wasn't a man made Dirt
[1:46:45] Pile it was a rock it's still there you
[1:46:48] can go visit it yes
[1:46:51] Upon This Rock now it wasn't this rock
[1:46:54] in areopagus or Mars
[1:46:58] Hill but Paul standing on this rock
[1:47:00] preaching to them explaining to them
[1:47:02] that this Jesus
[1:47:04] Christ came to the Earth was crucified
[1:47:10] and he was resurrected now that stirred
[1:47:12] them
[1:47:13] up the resurrection stirred them up but
[1:47:17] before he got to the resurrection he
[1:47:19] starts talking to him and he says you
[1:47:21] know there was a season of time when God
[1:47:24] winked at the
[1:47:28] ignorance and I believe that there are
[1:47:32] seasons of our life where God does the
[1:47:34] same thing for
[1:47:37] us he Winks at our
[1:47:41] ignorance now we may with our natural
[1:47:44] ear have
[1:47:46] heard something preached that was in the
[1:47:49] scripture
[1:47:51] but it wasn't our time yet and God
[1:47:54] allowed the ignorance to go
[1:47:57] on but then there came a time when God
[1:48:02] let our eyes be open and the time for
[1:48:05] ignorance was
[1:48:07] pass I want to tell you there are people
[1:48:10] that run right over top of
[1:48:12] it and
[1:48:14] continue in their
[1:48:18] ignorance but it's not really
[1:48:21] ignorance it's blatant
[1:48:29] Disobedience can anybody remember the
[1:48:32] exact quote that Bobby Connor used to
[1:48:34] give halfhearted
[1:48:37] obedience is just cloaked
[1:48:42] Rebellion I believe was what he said and
[1:48:45] I've thought on this statement many
[1:48:47] times half-hearted obedience
[1:48:51] is only veiled or cloaked
[1:48:57] Rebellion Because unless we fully
[1:49:02] obey we're walking in Rebellion
[1:49:06] amen
[1:49:11] amen if
[1:49:13] something is made known to
[1:49:17] us and we continue to walk in our
[1:49:21] Rebellion or even a half obedience come
[1:49:23] on now remember he's looking for the
[1:49:26] meat of
[1:49:28] obedience Jesus is looking for our
[1:49:31] obedience to him and he doesn't want
[1:49:34] half-hearted obedience he wants complete
[1:49:38] obedience and we're working toward it
[1:49:40] now remember that that we can only
[1:49:43] repent for what we can
[1:49:45] see there are things that are still
[1:49:49] inside of us
[1:49:50] that we cannot repent for because we
[1:49:53] can't see them
[1:49:55] yet but as God reveals things to us and
[1:49:58] he he he brings it across through the
[1:50:01] preaching of the word or in our own
[1:50:03] private prayer time he is looking for
[1:50:06] obedience and he's looking for
[1:50:08] repentance from
[1:50:10] us and if we see it and we turn our
[1:50:15] head or if we decide we're going to go
[1:50:17] halfway with it right then we're still
[1:50:20] walking in
[1:50:25] Rebellion I just be honest with you
[1:50:29] there are things through the years that
[1:50:30] we don't
[1:50:34] like we saw
[1:50:37] it God dealt with us and we didn't like
[1:50:42] it but we still had the choice am I
[1:50:45] going to walk in
[1:50:47] obedience am I going to walk in truth or
[1:50:49] am I am I going to walk in my Rebellion
[1:50:52] but see we don't like to look at it like
[1:50:54] we're
[1:50:57] rebelling we always like to look at it
[1:50:59] as we're the exception to the
[1:51:04] rule and so I'll just you know that
[1:51:08] wasn't for
[1:51:15] me
[1:51:18] listen
[1:51:20] we've all done
[1:51:23] it we've all shoveled it to the guy
[1:51:26] behind
[1:51:28] us we heard something preached and we
[1:51:31] said oh we had a name attached to it in
[1:51:34] fact it was inscribed on our
[1:51:40] shovel when really God was speaking
[1:51:42] directly to
[1:51:47] us not always but God don't need our
[1:51:51] help with the
[1:51:53] shovel he doesn't need our help with the
[1:51:56] shovel God knows how to speak to people
[1:51:59] he knows how to get their attention he
[1:52:02] knows how to call their number and he
[1:52:04] knows how to put his finger on them when
[1:52:07] they are walking in Rebellion whether it
[1:52:09] be one quarter 1/ half three4 or all the
[1:52:12] way he knows how to put his finger on
[1:52:15] anybody testify today that God's done
[1:52:17] that to you for you he's put his finger
[1:52:20] on that rebellion and he kept working on
[1:52:22] it until that you said okay Lord I'm
[1:52:24] willing to give all the
[1:52:25] way and that's what we got to do as
[1:52:28] Believers because the time of ignorance
[1:52:30] has passed amen there are some things
[1:52:34] that you'll get by with today that you
[1:52:36] won't get by with tomorrow or next week
[1:52:39] the time of ignorance will be passed and
[1:52:41] God will require it fully of you and
[1:52:44] you'll wonder why that things are going
[1:52:46] wrong in your life and then you start
[1:52:48] questioning the Lord and he opens your
[1:52:49] your eyes to your own
[1:52:52] Rebellion friends that's not a pretty
[1:52:54] sight it is not a pretty sight when God
[1:52:57] opens your eyes to your own Rebellion to
[1:52:59] your own uglies and he just starts
[1:53:01] putting them right in your face with a
[1:53:03] mirror and he says it's time to get rid
[1:53:05] of this it's time to get rid of it it's
[1:53:09] time for you to come all the way with me
[1:53:13] and lay aside all of the doubt all of
[1:53:15] the unbelief all of your hurts all of
[1:53:18] your anxieties all of your fortunes just
[1:53:20] lay them
[1:53:22] aside and say Lord I'm coming and I'm
[1:53:24] allowing you to help me Amen to walk in
[1:53:29] full
[1:53:32] obedience will it happen again very
[1:53:34] possible because God is continually
[1:53:37] dealing with us continuing every day to
[1:53:39] deal with us because the object friend
[1:53:42] of a Believer yes the object of a
[1:53:46] Believer is to become 100% yielded to
[1:53:50] the Holy
[1:53:51] Spirit and as we come closer and closer
[1:53:54] to the coming of the
[1:53:56] Lord and we're laying off more of us
[1:54:00] more of us remember John said I must
[1:54:03] decrease so he can increase that ought
[1:54:05] to be a statement that we're constantly
[1:54:07] saying about our own selves I've got to
[1:54:10] decrease there has got to be less of me
[1:54:13] and more of him because when there's
[1:54:16] less of me and I'm depending more and
[1:54:19] more more on the spirit of God that
[1:54:21] dwells in me then I am getting myself
[1:54:25] more and more ready for a
[1:54:28] translation these temporary raptures
[1:54:31] that we have like we had this morning as
[1:54:34] we were in worship and there was a high
[1:54:36] praise would go out these are temporary
[1:54:39] raptures and then we come back down but
[1:54:41] we don't ever want to come back down to
[1:54:43] where we
[1:54:45] started we go up and we come back down
[1:54:50] but we're high but we're higher
[1:54:53] yes sir then God can speak to us on that
[1:54:56] level and we get in the next time and we
[1:54:58] press in and we praise and we let God
[1:55:01] deal with our heart and we Rapture again
[1:55:03] to maybe a higher level and then we come
[1:55:06] back down but by God's grace never to
[1:55:08] that level that we started out at
[1:55:10] because the spirit of God is taking us
[1:55:13] higher and higher this is where we we
[1:55:15] talk about uh we're going to speed up
[1:55:18] and they're going to slow down and we're
[1:55:20] going to meet in the middle the
[1:55:21] molecules of our body we're taking on
[1:55:24] another dimension in the spirit because
[1:55:28] this Earth is not going to hold
[1:55:31] us so we become more and more yielded to
[1:55:35] the Holy
[1:55:37] Spirit allowing him to be fully in us
[1:55:42] because we can do nothing of ourself
[1:55:45] because if if we try to do it of ourself
[1:55:49] that's what we we get
[1:55:51] self that's exactly we end up with
[1:55:56] self John
[1:55:58] 1 in the beginning was the word and the
[1:56:01] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:56:04] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:56:08] all things were made by him and without
[1:56:09] him was not anything made that was
[1:56:13] made in him was
[1:56:17] life and that life
[1:56:20] was the light of men so Paul when he
[1:56:23] preached to these people he was telling
[1:56:27] them the time of their ignorance was
[1:56:28] passed the unknown God that they had all
[1:56:31] these Idols to and they had this
[1:56:33] inscription he tells them that this God
[1:56:36] this God that they could not see that
[1:56:38] they ignorantly worshiped they didn't
[1:56:40] know nothing about in
[1:56:42] him we
[1:56:44] live and
[1:56:46] move and have our being
[1:56:50] this is the same God that created us so
[1:56:54] we have our being but in him is life we
[1:56:57] live and John 1 says in him was life and
[1:57:01] that life was the light of man the life
[1:57:04] of Jesus Christ in The Believer is the
[1:57:07] light that is needed for man so in order
[1:57:10] to have life you have to be in
[1:57:14] him here's a scripture that is so
[1:57:18] misunderstood was surely misunderstood
[1:57:21] by the disciples John 6:56 he that
[1:57:24] eateth my
[1:57:26] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[1:57:31] me and I in
[1:57:40] him sitting around the
[1:57:42] table trying to partake of the
[1:57:47] Passover all of the sudden Jesus
[1:57:50] says unless you eat my
[1:57:53] flesh and drink my
[1:57:56] blood you have no life in
[1:57:59] you or what kind of cannibalism is
[1:58:03] this going to have to gnaw on one
[1:58:06] another no Jesus wanted us to have
[1:58:10] spirit and
[1:58:12] word spirit and life he in order for us
[1:58:17] to uh operate in in a place where that
[1:58:20] we are fully uh demonstrating his life
[1:58:24] we have to partake of his spirit and his
[1:58:27] life or his word the word has to become
[1:58:29] so real inside of us Ephesians 1:4 as
[1:58:32] the musicians are coming according as he
[1:58:35] have chosen Us in him before the
[1:58:39] foundation of the world that we should
[1:58:41] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:58:43] love see you can't you can't live this
[1:58:45] in and of
[1:58:47] yourself you have to be in in
[1:58:51] him the the Bible tells us when Peter be
[1:58:55] to uh speak to them on the day of
[1:58:58] Pentecost he he wanted them to recognize
[1:59:02] that there had been something that had
[1:59:04] happened to them on the day of
[1:59:07] Pentecost they couldn't recognize it
[1:59:10] they couldn't see it they didn't
[1:59:11] understand it right they just thought
[1:59:14] this was a bunch of men that had had too
[1:59:15] much wine and come out into the streets
[1:59:18] they'd been drinking all day and all
[1:59:20] night and on into the morning and come
[1:59:21] out in the streets and there are a bunch
[1:59:23] of drunk men and Peter had to say no
[1:59:25] these aren't drunk as you
[1:59:28] suppose but this is that what which was
[1:59:31] spoken of by Joel The Prophet saying
[1:59:33] that in the last days and see we have
[1:59:36] the we have the blessing that God would
[1:59:38] come in the last day the last of the
[1:59:41] last days and that he would pour out his
[1:59:43] Spirit on the believer so that we could
[1:59:46] have this s same indwelling of the Holy
[1:59:49] Spirit spirit and he gave the he gave
[1:59:51] the formula he gave the prescription for
[1:59:54] it and he said
[1:59:57] repent
[2:00:06] repent now if you would be hearing me
[2:00:08] today and you
[2:00:09] say all of these people have already
[2:00:13] repented let me just tell you set your
[2:00:16] mind at
[2:00:18] ease
[2:00:21] I've been serving the lord for 35
[2:00:25] years and I find myself repenting every
[2:00:33] day well didn't you repent 35 years ago
[2:00:38] when you accepted Jesus as your savior
[2:00:40] yeah I
[2:00:42] did remember I said a while ago I
[2:00:45] repented for what I could
[2:00:48] see
[2:00:52] but as the days go by and God reveals
[2:00:54] himself to us and he starts putting his
[2:00:56] finger on things in our
[2:00:58] life I can carry it if I want to as you
[2:01:04] can that's why people get grouchy as a
[2:01:09] bear because they carry their sin around
[2:01:11] and they don't
[2:01:14] repent and all God is looking for for
[2:01:17] you to have peace is for you to repent
[2:01:20] that's
[2:01:21] it to repent and follow him with a pure
[2:01:25] heart and when we follow him with a pure
[2:01:28] heart repentance is not it's not a it's
[2:01:31] not a job it's not a it's not difficult
[2:01:34] it's not drudgery to
[2:01:37] us it's drudgery to us when we carry
[2:01:41] that thing for way too long and then we
[2:01:43] become irritable and grouchy and
[2:01:45] everybody wonders what's the matter with
[2:01:47] us why are we in such a uh you know just
[2:01:50] such a state of mind that we are it's
[2:01:53] because we're carrying things that God
[2:01:55] has revealed to us uh that are that are
[2:01:57] sin that are besetting us that are
[2:02:00] unbelief and we've decided that we're
[2:02:02] going to carry it for a few more days
[2:02:05] right and God dealing with us every day
[2:02:08] about it and we just continue to carry
[2:02:10] it around and then all of a
[2:02:13] sudden somebody says to us you are
[2:02:17] grouchy because
[2:02:19] God is dealing with you and you just
[2:02:21] need to let go of whatever you're
[2:02:24] carrying or sometimes we just recognize
[2:02:27] I'm tired of
[2:02:32] this anybody ever said Lord I
[2:02:36] [Laughter]
[2:02:39] give I'm
[2:02:42] done I don't want this attitude that I
[2:02:45] carry I don't want this grouchy nature
[2:02:47] that I have I don't want to be irritable
[2:02:50] with my wife I don't want to be angry at
[2:02:52] my children but because I've been
[2:02:54] carrying this around for days and weeks
[2:02:57] I I just have been just a a grouchy old
[2:03:01] fell and I don't want to be that way
[2:03:03] anymore you give it to
[2:03:05] God and it doesn't take months and years
[2:03:09] to get over it if we give it to God he
[2:03:12] can cleanse it it's
[2:03:15] done and he can restore unto us the joy
[2:03:19] Joy of his
[2:03:20] salvation he doesn't take our Salvation
[2:03:23] away but our joy has
[2:03:26] diminished but if we'll repent and say
[2:03:29] Lord I
[2:03:32] give but when you're a new believer it
[2:03:34] takes repentance asking the Lord to
[2:03:36] cleanse you by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:03:40] it's not the blood of a Preacher it's
[2:03:42] not even the laying of hands on a
[2:03:43] preacher by a preacher or another
[2:03:46] believer it's just you saying Lord I
[2:03:49] need the blood of Jesus Christ to
[2:03:51] cleanse me from all
[2:03:53] unrighteousness and fill me with your
[2:03:57] spirit be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:04:00] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:04:02] recognizing that God has done something
[2:04:05] for you and so you enter into baptism
[2:04:09] and and you allow all of that old to be
[2:04:12] buried it doesn't the water doesn't wash
[2:04:14] away the sin right you better make sure
[2:04:18] all of the sin has been cleansed out of
[2:04:20] your life that you know about before you
[2:04:22] ever go to the
[2:04:24] water and the water is just an
[2:04:27] identification that I
[2:04:29] died I died it's no longer I that liveth
[2:04:33] but it's Christ in me and then there's
[2:04:36] the promise the Blessed promise of the
[2:04:38] Holy Ghost to come to those that were
[2:04:40] willing to obey would just stand with us
[2:04:43] today in him we live and move
[2:04:49] and have our
[2:04:51] being we're not serving a God that
[2:04:54] cannot be contacted we're not serving a
[2:04:57] god that is 10 million miles
[2:05:01] away but neither do we have to have some
[2:05:05] kind of
[2:05:07] idolatry but he chose to live all
[2:05:15] inside to live inside of us to guide us
[2:05:19] day by
[2:05:20] day we don't have to be
[2:05:24] ignorant we can walk with an assurance
[2:05:27] to know that Jesus Christ is alive and
[2:05:31] he's well right here today and if you
[2:05:34] don't know him you
[2:05:37] can if you have sin in your
[2:05:41] life today is the day you can be rid of
[2:05:46] it you don't have to carry it another
[2:05:48] day

[2:06:31] Son of

[2:06:43] and He
[2:06:45] Walks With Me
[2:06:49] and he
[2:06:51] talks with me and he
[2:06:57] tells me I am his
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:05] own and the
[2:07:09] joy we
[2:07:11] share as we
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] te
[2:07:17] there not
[2:07:20] other has
[2:07:23] ever
[2:07:27] known he speaks and the sound
[2:07:34] of his
[2:07:35] [Music]
[2:07:39] voice is so
[2:07:42] sweet the birds hush their
[2:07:47] s
[2:07:50] in and the
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:07:56] me that he
[2:07:59] gave
[2:08:02] to
[2:08:05] with my
[2:08:08] heart is
[2:08:11] [Music]
[2:08:14] ringing
[2:08:16] and he was

[2:09:35] there none
[2:09:37] other has
[2:09:41] ever
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:47] known
[2:09:50] this may seem
[2:09:51] like it was an Evangelistic kind of a
[2:09:54] message and that's way God is speaking
[2:09:56] right now we're going to let him do
[2:09:59] exactly
[2:10:00] that we don't know what God
[2:10:04] is
[2:10:05] doing in all of his ways but we know God
[2:10:09] is
[2:10:10] moving he's
[2:10:13] moving things are shifting things are
[2:10:16] moving and as God sends different people
[2:10:19] in among us we want to be able to
[2:10:22] minister to them and we don't want any
[2:10:25] of our
[2:10:26] stuff to be transferred to them any of
[2:10:30] our yucky stuff we don't want it
[2:10:31] transferred to them we want the Holy
[2:10:34] Spirit to be so alive in
[2:10:37] [Music]
[2:10:39] us sister April sent me this quote that
[2:10:43] I was trying to find a few minutes ago
[2:10:45] Bobby Connor and I'm going to give it to
[2:10:47] you the Lord the this is Bobby Connor
[2:10:49] speaking the Lord said to me when it
[2:10:51] comes to seeking me I detest
[2:11:01] multitasking he said halfhearted
[2:11:04] obedience is nothing but cloaked
[2:11:09] Rebellion amen now this is still true
[2:11:15] today God detests multitask and he wants
[2:11:18] our attention yes he does and he doesn't
[2:11:21] want half-hearted obedience no he does
[2:11:24] he wants full complete obedience from
[2:11:28] us he doesn't want us dabbling here or
[2:11:31] dabbling there he doesn't want us having
[2:11:34] a an idolatrous piece in front of us
[2:11:37] something that keeps pulling us back to
[2:11:41] it but he wants complete and total
[2:11:45] surrender so that as God adds to to us
[2:11:49] we're not transferring our idolatry on
[2:11:52] someone else we're not transferring our
[2:11:55] Rebellion on somebody else but we are
[2:11:58] able by the power of the Living God as I
[2:12:03] heard brother Bram preach on Wednesday
[2:12:05] night that there is something the Holy
[2:12:08] Ghost is so full in us that we impart to
[2:12:11] them eternal
[2:12:15] life you can't impart what you don't
[2:12:18] possess
[2:12:20] amen and we want to be able to
[2:12:23] impart to those that come in so let's
[2:12:27] ask the Lord just to
[2:12:29] completely everything that we may have
[2:12:31] been holding on to One More Time Lord we
[2:12:36] stand together around the front of this
[2:12:39] building Lord there are some sitting
[2:12:41] back in the seats standing in the seats
[2:12:44] Lord I don't know where they are but I
[2:12:46] know God that you are are the same
[2:12:49] yesterday and today and forever and I
[2:12:52] know that you are calling us to a higher
[2:12:56] place you want us to be fully cleansed
[2:13:00] of all
[2:13:02] unrighteousness you are not going to
[2:13:05] allow us to continue to walk in
[2:13:08] ignorance and you're not going to allow
[2:13:10] us to continue to walk in our cloaked
[2:13:15] Rebellion you are calling us
[2:13:19] Lord to be fully dedicated to
[2:13:23] you and so God if we stand here with
[2:13:26] something that is
[2:13:28] between us and
[2:13:32] you Lord you are able to put your finger
[2:13:36] on it once again
[2:13:38] today last week we may not have had
[2:13:44] the intestinal fortitude to say you can
[2:13:48] have it
[2:13:49] Lord but maybe you've dealt with us
[2:13:51] through this week and this week we can
[2:13:53] say Okay Lord you can have
[2:13:57] it would you give us the grace not to
[2:14:00] pick it back
[2:14:04] up
[2:14:06] yes Lord there are those that have
[2:14:09] idolized their
[2:14:11] hurts they didn't mean
[2:14:14] to but it was what they came to look at
[2:14:18] every
[2:14:19] day just what they looked
[2:14:22] at they kept their eyes on
[2:14:25] it but
[2:14:28] God by the power of the Holy
[2:14:32] Ghost come even this
[2:14:35] moment and give us the
[2:14:38] grace to put that Idol out of our
[2:14:43] life that it is not what we live for
[2:14:46] tomorrow
[2:14:48] it's not what keeps us going but the
[2:14:51] word and the spirit is what keeps us
[2:14:55] going in him the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:14:59] have life and we have it more
