[0:00] if you want to see god move you pick up
[0:02] his word you start slinging it like a
[0:05] sword and believe it with everything
[0:08] you've got
[0:15] there's a battle raging for our health
[0:18] there's a battle raging for our freedoms
[0:21] there's a battle raging for our sanity
[0:25] the devil wants to run you t totally
[0:28] insane
[0:30] somebody said i can't amend that you
[0:32] ought to
[0:33] because it's the truth
[0:35] and by amending it you're not going to
[0:37] claim it you're going to say i got my y
[0:39] eyes wide open preacher i know the enemy
[0:43] is after me
[0:45] one of these days the bride's going to
[0:47] recognize who she is
[0:49] she's going to get tired of running from
[0:51] the enemy
[0:52] and she's going to run toward the roar
[0:56] instead of him running us all over town
[0:59] we're going to run him
[1:01] this is what god has called us to do
[1:04] the bride of jesus christ should be
[1:07] shifting the atmosphere of planet earth
[1:12] we have authority to do that
[1:15] we should be moving through the
[1:17] atmosphere in the realm of the spirit
[1:21] doing and undoing
[1:24] interceding when intercession is needed
[1:28] declaring when declaration is needing
[1:31] prophesying when prophecy is needed
[1:34] you take that word of god and speak it
[1:37] under the inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:40] you're not just talking the word you're
[1:42] not just quoting the bible you are
[1:45] prophesying
[1:47] into the atmosphere the word of the lord
[1:52] the word of the lord will shift a
[1:54] situation faster than fasting
[1:58] if you want to see god move you pick up
[2:01] his word you start slinging it like a
[2:03] sword and believe it with everything
[2:06] you've got and god is duty-bound and
[2:09] obligated to move on behalf of that word
[2:14] you talk about rallying him off the
[2:16] throne you just let a little old
[2:19] believer he doesn't have to be a mighty
[2:21] giant just let it be the weakest
[2:23] christian
[2:25] get down on his or her knees and take
[2:28] god and his word
[2:33] i want you to know angels stand at
[2:36] attention
[2:38] you want to move god off his throne do
[2:40] something like that
[2:42] the angels will start reporting and
[2:44] saying hey there's been a change in that
[2:47] little there's been a change in your
[2:49] little daughter your son over there is
[2:52] taking authority that he's been
[2:54] forfeiting too long
[2:57] that'll get god moving
