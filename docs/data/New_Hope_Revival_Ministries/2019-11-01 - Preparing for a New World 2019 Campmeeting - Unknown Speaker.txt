John 14 God is so good to us and I want to say by God's grace he I know you some of us know he's really real you know we're not just serving a God that his that is proven himself in this age but he's also bore witness within us you got to know him personally and know that he is alive and well and that the God that we serve is still alive you know we come and we worship we shout and we dancing all of those things are good I am that kind of a person I don't apologize but I know when it's all said and done there's there's a life to live and I hope and trust by God's grace he will bless you in a special way through the word tonight starting beginning beginning at the first verse let not your heart be troubled he believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know and Thomas said unto Him Lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way and jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you have known me you should have known my father also and from his fourth you know him and have seen him and Philip said unto Him Lord show us the father and it suffice as us and Jesus said unto Him have I been so long time with you and yet as thou not known me Philip he that have seen me have seen the father and have said how saith thou then show us the father believe it though not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he dwelleth do what the works gives me believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatever you ask in my name that I will do that the father may be glorified in the son and if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it one more scripture please I know that's a long one but Isaiah 55 and 11 you so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things whether - I sent it let us pray father we come before you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves there are no words to express our gratitude Father we thank you Jesus break every yoke tonight destroy the works of the enemy Lord and I pray father God that the word spoken may find good place in good rest in the heart of your people grant it dear Jesus and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message preparing for a new world when we see by God's grace the writings of John here the prophet of God tells us that it was almost like Jesus was speaking its own funeral service and the thing that I like about what I'm reading is because he said that he was going to prepare a place for us and when I think about this I think about what caused this to happen and you and I must understand that we must go back to Genesis often time to find out the reality of what's really happening we're living in the last days and you and I know that this world is falling apart come on somebody it's worse now than it's ever been how are we going to escape when we see maniacs ready to push the button how are we going to get out of this world but then the Lord began to minister to me and he took me back to Genesis and he showed me that God had given Adam a commission and God told Adam be fruitful and multiply and you and I know that Adam really never did what God said do that alright what had happened we find out that because of sin instead of the sons of God multiply we found out that it was the serpent who filled the earth is that right hallelujah as you said what problems how do you know because the Bible tells us that they married and we're given to marriage they multiply and violence covered the earth and as it was is that day so is it in this day is that right you now must understand that the multitude of people that was drowned in the flood was not the seed of God made a translation hallelujah you ever thought about it what was it that God preserved Enoch what was it that God took eat up off this earth and where did he go there's got to be a place he knock is not floating around in the atmosphere somewhere but place and you and I must understand that there are other worlds hallelujah we may call them dimensional but they're there so we realized by God's grace that God began to do a work and Satan always look like he's the winner but every real seed of God has a place a preserve a preserved place when we leave here we go to a designated place that God has preserved you say what do you mean remember the Bible said God word will not come back void hallelujah and though we bypass our theophany hello when God made out of he made all of us come on somebody with the proper God went behind the curtain of time and he saw all of us you just didn't appear there you were there honey so you say what do you mean brother Bruce I'm trying to get us to see that there is a place that God has already prepared for us is that right all of the newcomers everybody that has the a body there must come this way is that right you and I must suffer we don't like suffering but that's what Adam did to us see cuz he was deceiving Adam was in the transgression right so you said what do you mean this is why when we come into the world the woman when she have a child it drops because it's a sign of the fall it drops but when God Amen created Adam and Eve they stood up like trees somebody help me here they stood up right hallelujah and we find out that God's grace because of the fall hallelujah we had the Bob pass out the army and we're now being born into this beast we got Beasley bodies come out somebody if you don't know your body is a beast something's wrong with you and they always think that contains the Beast is the Holy Ghost [Applause] hallelujah this is why I try to tell people we're not just in an age of shouting and dancing and running and all those is good don't get me wrong I know sometimes people want to cut all that out I'm not saying that but I'm saying there you got to mature you got a mature let me let me read something here amen listen we understand no the new city according to revelation 21 the Bible says and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever that worketh abomination or make it a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life is our brother what are you trying to say don't you understand that even when Jesus come again his feet cannot touch the earth hallelujah and therefore when we are changed we must leave the earth why because we will be in our glorified bodies we will be in the image of the world that is to come wait a minute somebody see in heaven you won't need supernatural because you are supernatural and that right but you must understand in this world you must have faith and come to know the supernatural and the only way you'll know the supernatural is that you must be born supernatural somebody help me here see I'm preparing I'm preparing for the New World I'm gonna come back to that in just a moment you know how it is when you're in your mother's womb you may have married me say this before I don't know but when you and your mother's wound that baby don't have to eat what was it what a baby why is it forming a mouth why is it forming a hand these hands why are the babies in the womb the baby doesn't need these hands the baby doesn't need its feet come on somebody the day the baby in the womb the baby don't even need its lungs because the baby lives after mother's lungs the mother's breathing the mother's eating everything the mother the baby needs the mother gives it but you see that baby is not formed in that womb to remain there to remain here when you and I can see that this is why amen God told Nicodemus you must be born again that which is flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is spirit and never in the history of time where we have come to know the divine nature of God we thought and many of us we've been in all kinds of churches out on been in every branch there is but you know the thing is we we learn what they teach us and here there's another thirst hallelujah I've seen all kinds of miracles but there was something what was it that was that election oh come on somebody say let me tell you some you can't even thirst for God unless God has chosen you to thirst hallelujah see I'm coming I always tell people I said you better take this week because the better coming hallelujah so you that must understand by God's grace amen that we're not here to be ordinary people the whole creation grows and waits it didn't say for the sons of God to come it said the manifestations hallelujah you and I must understand what God did to Malachi for was a wave that means war to come hallelujah all unite must be able to identify with being one of them see the devil is afraid that you're going to come to understand who you are hallelujah you I'll tell the devil you can't stop me I was here before you were you must arrive oh it's only to bring me to a proving ground you and I must prove that we're not from satan's either and we have come to live the life that the Baptist the methods the pillar Coster all could not live come on somebody we're moving upward and this why try to tell people I said don't you realize what the devil is doing this is the age of distractions he's distracting us because he's trying to keep us away from what we are supposed to do but you and I know nothing absolutely nothing can stop the purpose of God and I'm one of them I don't care what I got to go through I am born giant-slayer come on somebody you are not and you say what do you mean I come to be a blessing but I want you to understand you can't just sit still and not grow in God when when in the 3rd chapter of Revelation go tried in the fire we want the goal but we don't want to be tried hallelujah but you and I must understand you're being tried in the fire you are the deity of God and you must God must purge all of the darkness out of you come on somebody show you some Oh what do you mean brother I'm saying you and I must die and rot that is the law of life remember now if we had not fallen by way of sin it would have been a spoken word events hallelujah come on somebody see because you got to understand and I noticed my soundless strength but it was a man God spoke to Adam and told Adam before Eve was ever manifested be fruitful and multiply it was out of that felt loneliness that was afterwards got an already told Adam to be fruitful and multiply so God brought a companion somebody help me here and she brought took away the loneliness but God had a man that would speak the word you said bring that to the word because listen you and I'm not being born by a church we are being born by Christ Jesus Christ see you and I must understand by God's grace what we're moving into we must be like him there's no sin to it and if that real seed is in you the devil he don't want you to be you don't want that seed to be quickened because once that seed is quicker it's all over because when the seed is quickened God said that he will complete the work [Music] somebody help me and even though we don't have patience with God God has a lot of patience with us hallelujah you love the Lord you and I we must understand when God told Adam coming back to that to replenish and look at all oh that happened even God beyond flooded the world with north I mean in Noah's day the world and then he comes along and then God raise up a nation under in Egypt Israel raise them up right we glorify God look at all millions millions come out of Egypt and then two of that generation crosses over how many in your church somebody better help me here see what we fail to see it will only be a few and you need to make sure you one of the few if this all right I'll tell people I said listen I don't know about what everybody else is doing that ain't my business hallelujah I need to know who I am when you come to know who you are you become invincible in God nobody can put you inside and nobody can take you out how could I said we are family family I will show you because even the Bible says in the fifth chapter of Genesis that Adams named Adam some light he created their name then their name was Adam and you understand the Bible says the whole family of heaven and earth his name after him now Adam was the first Adam you're right before the fall when God would say Adam they both would turn yes Lord [Music] right they were so connected by oneness and character they answered God the same way is that right y'all know Heidi at some time husband and wives when you've been mad at us a long time you begin to think alike you begin to say things alike sometimes your expressions becomes the same because you you you you feed off of each other and Adam and Eve they were just the same so he the scripture says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God and that's where we're falling shot y'all hear me that's what we're falling shot we want to be underneath him but if you in Jesus you must not think it robbery to be equal with God the Holy Ghost will teach you that you not don't have a second person or third person but the person in you which is God himself and even God in you just to give an analysis if I had a coke bottle right oh there's water bottle and water is in here it becomes a water bottle but if I had Pepsi in here it changes the identity of the bottle hallelujah you say could you pass me that Pepsi somebody help me sheesh oh you gotta understand this is what I preach let me say it like this it must be the same it must be the same and you and I know what the same is is that right when we were in elementary they had wagons sometimes cars and they would all look like what would have maybe three wheels and one might have four wheels and then you might have one with four wheels and one blue and one red but you need to find the one that looked exactly like the other hallelujah and you would draw a circle to identify the very same right they could be shaped alike they could look just alike almost but there was always one difference that made the difference and you had the circle the ones that were the exact same now I want you to look at yourself and I want you to think about what they were after are you the same because only the same goes up oh Jesus but you're not he said I want you the widest supplicant you look so pretty and everything else but inside your dad miss balls that's not what God wants you've got to be spirit filled I didn't say half filled I didn't say 99% filled I said you got to be spirit filled the Bible said they were full of the Holy Ghost Oh somebody help me here because God that in the new world there will not be one serpent in that new city nothing that will defile hallelujah and you're looking show up revolution when Peter look at Peter God told Peter I give you the keys right and we go to ash 238 is that is that all that Peter gave us Peter can't come right around and says listen I'm gonna tell you something about the divine nature of God and God is gonna make a way of entrance hallelujah you see because I want you to understand without these keys the doors of heaven will not open for you see those nature that long-suffering that patience that that you know godliness all of those things must be sealed only inside to make a rapture [Music] hallelujah so when God is bringing you through a trial you don't cry out why me Lord you say thank you how you give thanks in all things give things [Applause] hallelujah is that right see if you're not careful that's the difference between Joshua and Caleb they always had a good spirit but those authors who followed Moses Marvin and complain all the time the Holy Ghost thing gonna let you do that and get away with it huh the Holy Ghost will make you repent every time you speak something negative out of your mouth the Holy Ghost will check you is that right somebody was asking me several Brotherhood's what are you saying what are you what are you preaching cuz I was just dealing with a few things of physics his eyes line talks about relativity and and things like that and you know how how two objects can exist but yet be in a different place but on the same line right because we are reflections did y'all know that did you know that that that that that Judas Judas was somewhere before he got here he was the son of perdition he was somewhere else before he came here whether be by thought or not he was there because when he died and hung himself on the tree he went back to where he came from and Jesus was somewhere before he got here right and when he died he went back to where he came from and the word tells us that only ones who will receive are those who descended somebody help me that's why we can say I came from God and I go back to God right I'm not talking to church people we got a lot of church folks that love Church they come to church they love it they love it like people are clubs they do they do but we're not talking when we were working with with with with understanding that you said I got faith but faith is operated by love and you got to understand that if you have faith in God you must love God you understand me now the Bible tells us that if we ask anything of God and believe it here giving give it to us right but you gotta also also understand I'm talking like this because I feel like I'm at home I want you to understand that when it comes to understanding what God is doing in you if you understand it it will change your whole perspective about what God is doing no temptation has taken you except those that are coming to me take Joel for an example the Bible said Joel was a perfect man but job had to suffer in order for God to take job where he should be and understand that's the oldest book of the Bible so Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not however he dealt with Joel God deals with us the same way he blesses us and we love those blessings but we can hardly take it when the when when the battles come you know I mean even Joe wonder was he was he cursed at my cursor something going on here you know what I mean but we fail to see the hands of God is perfecting you think about what you might have within yourself that you hate don't you want God to get it out of there and sometimes you know we don't know how to get it out right like I tell people I said I can wash my hands I can wash my feet I might even be here to get a brush and wash my back but only God can wash my heart and I need God the supernatural to go in there and clean everything out of me right that's not that's just the beginning once he's sanctifying cleanses you without all that stuff this is what God did he begin to put his virtues and guess what that's a victory he ain't gonna pull you through no hope you got a battle hallelujah now you say well what do you mean brother just a moment I don't skipped all over my little nose but that's okay I want you to understand I'm trying to get something over just so you can know that that you're preparing it's like when you're going on a trip you know we pack up but we're not packing up to not not natural things but we want the virtues to pack up in us and you and I must understand that one way when when when God is working with us no matter who you are if you're true seed you're gonna have to go through some things hallelujah you're gonna have to go there's various things he went through sometimes you got to go through being embarrassed and ashamed yeah the devil got it for you you're gonna have to you don't be below suffering and patient and all of those things even when you know you're right wait a minute even when you know you're right huh well I'm right but being right is not always righteous huh sometimes you really do have to give up the right for the wrong I often tell brothers where's the scripture said you know men who suffer themselves to be defrauded but no they owe me an apology how many apologies you Oh God okay let me move on move on because I'm trying to get us to see by God's grace that he's working on us working working on us following us fastening us into his very image and I'm gonna tell you something I'm not the same man I used to be ten years ago but it's been worth it why cuz I know where I'm going y'all understand me I know where I came from I like like the probably God says I can't be a devil I love him too much is he yours I'm gonna go back to the reflection because whatever you are reflecting here is what you reflecting there or elsewhere is that right you know a shadow and and the object is so close to each other you can't really separate them then after a while the shadow in the object becomes the same thing hallelujah you're not gonna have the shadow of a burden and you get up on the object and it's it's a snake it is reflecting right it's reflecting whatever that light is striking right it's like this you you said oh I see this no not really scientifically you don't see this you see the reflection of it and let me ask you do you realize that this thing is moving but your eyes can't see it and don't you know its grab that keeps it in place if gravity wasn't here you know what would happen to us we were just going into pieces but what happened is when God said let there be light that vibration went out and it held everything he needs to hold in place right so you say well what do you mean brother let me tell you something those stars that God lined up out there it's still there because God in the person of the low God says stop and it stopped even the atmosphere everything has its boundaries and so do you you've got your boundaries hallelujah God didn't make us all doctors neither did he all make us all surgeons or piano players or and I wonder ham how did God know he's such a mastermind he knew how many piano players to put it in this world come on he knew how many scenes to put in this world oh come on every one of us with the talents that we have has been given to us by God so let me say it like this every good and perfect gift comes from God and only those gifts will remain of you when God gets done only the gifts that he's given you will remain and everything else will be Jesus hallelujah you love the Lord no it's true yo yo yo yo yo yo your thoughts ringing louder in heaven then your words you said well how can that because it's dimensional you don't even know that your dimensional right but you are hallelujah he said oh brother was what are you saying I'm trying to tell you you have a representation we call it a theophany right but you here on earth Jesus said to those disciples he said the Pharisees let me tell you something I can tell you something you give me the answer is how can the Son of Man be here on earth and in heaven at the same time you are doing heavenly things somebody help me they teach us how to pray our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name right that will be done as it is in heaven let me do let me do it let me have it done him hallelujah he said I'll tell you what I was laying on the bed and he says all of a sudden I found myself above my body I was looking down at an old man but on this side I was young I'm a young man oh come on somebody Jasha and what happens is that when you hear this message and you quicken your theophany is now pulling you together it's preaching to you is literally telling you don't do this don't do that it's bringing you revelations hallelujah he's the one that warns you when the devil comes out to you hallelujah I try to tell people yeah we got to grow David was anointed king and when he was a noted king he was king [Music] he had to grow up but he still was king you bribed you might have to grow up but you still bribed somebody help me so you can understand guess what we often thought when he said I go to prepare a place for you you don't mean I thought we're gonna have all these mansions there times I thought which one I'm gonna what kind I'm gonna have you know and I always say Lord you know you got to give me a mountain somewhere and some running water I love both of them I love that that when they come together like that right I said Lord but then I found out that the mansion though there'll be places buildings and all but you are the mansion you are the mansion and guess what you cannot be an incomplete mansion and go there hallelujah you understand me god no I could not go in or the rain could not solve until Noah's Ark was completed and that represents us God keep bringing rapture until you and I are completed and guess what God will not have to scratch his head and says I wonder is it done yet oh absolutely not you and I would be so much like him and I'm pushing toward that yes I am I'm pushing too hard that I want to be just like him I don't care if you called me Holy Roller you call me whatever you want to call me you know I think sometimes people are - you call me what people think you know brother Brewster lost his mind every time I look around he's going down there to that church praying I don't care sometimes that's what I find find my way of escape just getting down there and just crying out to the Lord hallelujah let me say it so I'm saying it so you can understand me you won't get there without prayer [Music] that's why the devil attacks your prayer life you can't you can't you're okay at 3 o'clock I'm I have three o'clock prayer you know you do that that Devils gonna be right there holding the anointing huh yummy and some of us we can't even pray unless we feel it you don't feel me preaching do you see you don't need it you understand me to pray you don't need to feel it tell God all about it when you tell them all about Daniel bring the anointing somebody help me here see we've been taught oh I gotta feel the rush to my lord is that right that's what the devil do you don't feel it well God ain't listening to me I don't know what's wrong you know why God ain't why got it God is always there when he stop being there you can't make him believe you know what I forsake you he's that what I don't feel it he's that when the pain is rocking my body he promised he'll be there whether I can see it with my natural eye or not he's there let me tell you something folks we must understand we are chosen God has favored you and you you're letting the devil make you feel like you cursed you're not cursed you can't cast that which God is blessed don't agree with you you you know what you got to go through you'll still King hallelujah somebody say well praise God oh you know [Music] something in my kingdom do something would you please for you could you please cook for me no you know what you tell him this is what I want for dinner and the understands not off of his people but he took away [Music] traditions and all these isms and schisms hallelujah whoo I can't jump and run because somebody may not like it Harley that's nonsense nonsense I can't get loud because somebody may not like it that's nonsense I'm so tired you know just my church might be looking back though they probably don't but anyway I was telling my church I'm so sick and tired of religion and I'm so tired I come in the church and everybody know what song's gonna be saying who's gonna pray oh god the churches God has never been like that that is not the same nobody gonna call you crazy by doing that y'all need to own up to them to the craziness if they go call you crazy give them something worth wild I'm gonna call you crazy of you sitting up there like a sane man this way is called heresy the way of insanity and when you come to really know Jesus you don't care David like I said it's daddy didn't even want to own up to him Sammy said surely you got another one and we would not have known him probably God not told us saying he was a boy little curls in his law hinders hair and you know maybe had a smooth face Amen and sheep sheep you know the shepherd was the lowest of all things and him back there herding sheep but that's what God God comes among the sheep it is there God comes and fellowship with sheep and as long as you keep the Sheep nature the Shepherd with fellowship with you is that right but when you get to the place of all but but but but I know the Word of God says this but but hallelujah when that doctor told me I had prostrate cancer and everything else at first I did I did cry you know but sometimes you have to regroup you gotta regroup some time you shock you what am i crying for one thing I'm not afraid of death no when God saved me he took the fear of death from me hmm I was just on the plane not long ago I better take the airlines but I was on the plane not long ago right and they were having trouble with the plane before we got off the panel and then we they we stayed there two and a half hours didn't we come again and got back on board and going up the runway and it shut down again then the pilot come back that stick his head but I something I can fix it I can figure that's all Oh Lord I said yeah I said Oh Lord he gonna get up there and then something else gonna happen justice I thought it I didn't say it I just thought it just as soon as we got in with snow and brother and all I could see was snow and somehow the the the flight attendant she came before this happened now she comes to me and she says what is that she saw a light now I don't know she said there's a like she's gonna say light I said and did she went and talked to somebody else and she came back over to me and said she saw a light now I was worshiping the Lord the whole time so she probably did you know the thing I'm saying is this when she came back again I said this my sister says Lord you didn't tell me I was gonna die today I wasn't afraid I just didn't know I was gonna die that day cuz I knew I was gonna hit that ground it won't be no living and then just as soon as I said that the Holy Spirit something she went through my heart is His perfect love cast out fear cuz there was a moment there was a moment you know and it's a perfect love casts out fear and then when and then I said to that sister that later I said no it's gonna be alright she said I show thank you I really appreciate that I really appreciate that and I'm gonna tell you how they had us on the news they had the fire department waiting on us and everything else they didn't know where to go to Chicago or to turn back but they eventually turn back hallelujah but then after us I saw her right there in the terminal trying to talk to about the Lord and she didn't want to hear she was good I prayed though y'all understand me what I'm saying is this when God when God you under circumstances when you circumstances come you you you get the shock you get the shock but you regroup when you regroup and says lord I trust you that's when God comes on the scene huh that's when it comes on the scene he's loading us and making us because I really mean you might think I'm crazy but I really believe if it had going down and it was the will of God for me to live I would have lived and I'm saying like these people of God we are the bride of Jesus Christ we can't wait well when the squeeze come now it's only now it's all me now things are rough things are hard things are tough hallelujah but the joy of the Lord is my strength because I realize I have to be changed completely being a Christian is not just saying I'm a Christian hello how many y'all like Oreos I used to eat them things like anyway but Oh chocolate cookies with vanilla in the middle or not all Orioles we want to be we want to be the real thing when we look and said listen I'm not striving to be like somebody else because I'm unique and every one of us are unique hallelujah I can't do something that you can do and you can't do with something I can do and that's beautiful I like it when God put it all together you know I'm saying I love that amen and you and I must understand it's not good to try to compare ourselves with somebody else be what you are hallelujah amen it's the truth it's the truth and I don't know I better hit that then cause he said you know I find out that you you find the musicians they have a hard time cuz everybody want to sing and everybody want to play you can't do all that at one time God has selections and you want to be one selected for that day is that the truth you want to be selected for that day maybe the next day you won't be selected but if you selected for that day the anointing will come down and consume the sacrifice but if anything in such a small matter is that God will not come down like he would have with matured Christians hallelujah and you and I must understand we must behave ourselves in mature ways and I don't know I'm talking to somebody now but when when it talked when we talk about making heaven I know that God is working in me and he's not through with me yet the thing that I want more than anything when I get to heaven some might say well if I get there and I'm gonna do it man you know what the dome that is no matter what's on the bottom of your shoe you wipe that on the doormat and so most of us can't even be there cuz somebody say one little thing against you you are man see so you don't want no you can't be a doormat because that's not what you were made to be I want to hear God say well done well done ah oh if I could just only get in there only getting in there when that first resurrection took place they were just and rather weak and ready to do it again y'all hear me we're getting ready to do it again and all the little God y'all see I used to be in the band so I don't know how they they do things you know they all back there practicing and doing everything else before the parade you want to make sure they all tuned up that's all they're doing up there they're just tuning it up because you got to understand they cannot be complete without us Holy Ghost to bring us into perfect now I'm gonna tell you how you know you gonna get it how you know you're gonna be tested right Jesus had done shown throughout his cavalry marching the cavalry showed those virtues and then he came all the way up to brotherly kindness amen when he spoke with that thief and told that thief you know but that wasn't a capping of it you said I'm saying now he's in pain see and a lot of times we say Oh she'll get over here get over it no that's wrong and most of us we don't know how to forgive while we're in pain and Jesus said Father forgive them while he was in pain for they know not what they do what'd you say that's Jesus well what about Steven when they were stoning him he said Lord hold not these things to their job hostile against flesh and blood this batter we God is not against our it's against the devil's that inspires our brothers hallelujah and you and I must recognize that you got you we can't just sit here Amen and have these meant mind like men the Bible said quit thinking like men you're supposed to think like a god [Music] hallelujah you become invincible when crisis in you that means you can't win you can't lose a battle y'all y'all start y'all you pausing on God but when the Holy Ghost is in there and the world is being preached the Holy Ghost would say Amen even if it's painful he'll still say Amen because that's his word hallelujah and when you talk about to my love that's where we got to be hmm oh yeah Joseph was a perfection right Joseph perfection but Joseph had to do one thing he not only had to go and show brotherly kindness now he don't went through all the other little virtues that he had to come through but he had the so brotherly kindness he saw his brothers and you don't think he got an attitude he did any human being would have the devil take you down memory lane yeah they sold me and they did this to me and I can remember this and you remember that and how they threw you in the ditching oh yeah and David was I mean Joseph was playing a little games with him at first you know God had to step in God had to step in and no doubt God at some point time you got to read between the lines God would no doubt says remember that vision remember that dream this is what it was all about see the purpose of God could not be stopped hallelujah no matter what the missing God shook nature God turn the hands of nature against is Israel to bring them to Egypt could they would not have ever come but God vision had a dream had to be be fulfilled that Joseph's brothers and his daddy had to bow they plan that part they can't go beyond their boundaries they shall be mine Oh somebody help me they shall be mine we'll be in the city and they'll be bringing it in just like Joseph's brothers come on somebody has a part and Joseph had to see his brothers and no doubt the devil is flipping well you know you barely escaped Potiphar's wife you know how that man forgot you know he left you and Jenny from you know all the bad stuff all the bad stuff Joseph had to forgive them and what happened not only did he forgive them he gave them great kisses get great treasures gave them land gave them food gave them that which was once this enemy because I'm gonna tell you something a brother is a brother somebody help me you can't change that relationship you understanding it is what it is you can't change it so you might as well love it somebody help me God listen people you think you can't get to heaven without loving your enemies you ain't got no enemies God don't give you some cuz you got to learn how to love your enemy help us Lord and we got plenty of right I'm my greatest enemy though I'm almost done but let me say it like this if we're gonna get to heaven we meet we must be led by God huh whichever way all we say that though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death and you know what Lord don't take me there no but you gotta go there David was a man after God's own heart and God loved David so much his very songs became the word and you and I must understand that these things these expression did David make mistakes of course he did but God still loved him unconditionally y'all understand me you must all I'm trying to say something here because God is teaching me I've had people to lie on me I've had them I don't know where they get up.get their imaginations from I do know but pointing but why they talk with me I don't know but it comes back to being jealous that's the key word jealous because King was jealous of Abel it comes right back to jealousy right Lucifer Lucifer was jealous and Micah so when it all boils down hallelujah you and I must understand amen we are on a mission and though we do not understand the trials Lord I just come out of the ditch now I'm in Potiphar's house and Here Come his wife it ain't going to stop until God protects you do you want it to stop see y'all scared you're scared you know I'm trying to tell you why why the battles are on yes your flesh has stopped but your soul says hey your soul got a crowd amen cuz your soul knows what's best for you you love the Lord prepare [Music] you in Psalms 87 and 6 it says the Lord shall count when he righted up the people that this man was born there didn't say men says man this man counted up the people that this man one man was born there you understand me so every true seed of God has been counted up and the body of Christ cannot be completed if one is missing because all make one man and you and I must understand by God's go I'm so happy you know to know that God has included me in this thing and he won't even let me get out of it he won't even let me get out of it you never know how many time I said look oh I said Lord you know what I just wish I had just been a singer I've been so happy god is great anyway let me say like this you want to be your real self you never know who you really are until you really born again and that's why the devil is trying to keep you from obtaining your precious promises whatever he can do he can't stop you he can't delay you but he cannot stop you and I don't know about you but I'm like if I could hurry this I want to hurry it and I say why because our world is getting ready to lose it you know and I know that they are so GAD they are so confused if you don't know you living in the daylight like no one in Sodom I mean you just don't know but we're here and you ask me we're beyond that and my point is this if that be the case where is the seed of God what are you doing because you got to understand it's just you see how the stars are outside do you recognize the stars you bet you see all this blackness out there hallelujah and then you got a little star here a little star there a little stuff that's how the seeds of God are here we are covered with darkness and God is depending on you to be let your light is that right that's the way the Bible said don't put your light on the bush all put in somewhere where it can be seen don't be ashamed I want you believe I saw just the other day Amen they sent me this thing on YouTube and this looked like a Spanish lady on the airplane I said that's the way it used to be we didn't care where we were when the Holy Ghost hit you you moved oh come on somehow oh yeah some of y'all don't remember that but that's the way it used to be you think I was in college Universal South Carolina and I couldn't I'd brain freeze and I so God just give me give me give me give me please I then he gave it to me and I started jumping and speaking in tongues I didn't care I was coming home from school I can't remember what I was thinking about and my porch was like this high I had to step up to get it and before I could step up the Holy Ghost hit me and I went to I didn't know nobody was looking no you're different if they don't see the difference it must be a manifestation and if you all I can't hardly stand it you go to these marketplaces and you see people with long dresses on and long hair and everything else and it looks so sanctified and look like it look like that the whole world yeah you'd be afraid to talk to him gun it look so sad look like they haven't smiled in a long time and I said to myself you think I won't that whatever that is I don't own it it's the truth it's the truth you know we saints of God let me tell you something one thing about a preacher even if a preacher ain't feeling good he's got to act like he is [Music] and you ought to be the same way I can't oh I tell you what when I used to have a job and people of you say well you you look like you ain't feeling well that would be such a slap in my face I feel I feel so bad I say Lord I wasn't showing you they saw me I don't want them to see me like this you know what I'm saying I want the world to see me in such a joyous way that every every time I see you you smiling but that's how it is now that's because every time I see you brothers you smiling that's what I want you to see I want you to see what's going on on the inside of me not the outside the inside of me that's where we are hallelujah and you said what do you mean brother books I'm trying to say I'm I didn't when I think about it Amen that this whole book one day I was in my kitchen and the Holy Spirit sent this Bible is you that's deep I said how he said because I told you to eat the book and understand when you eat the book that's what you are you said what what do you mean I say see what people don't understand I don't I can't remember all it is but if I'm sealed with the Holy Spirit I got all of this see what I'm saying I got all this oh this isn't me I had the potential of using every bit of it come on somebody let me like it like this some sisters this is just like a cookbook hallelujah when you want to cook up something or you gotta use turn to certain pages set some fire needs Oh oh yeah when I had that stroke and it had me limping in my face drooping down here a little bit amen I didn't even say the doctor you know they won't they won't ask you how much did sin how much did you kill this I tell him nothing I couldn't even I couldn't even hardly swallow you know what because I knew they were gonna give me more medication I said Lord you don't want me like this do you I said I can't even saying for you're not preached for you like this hallelujah and I'm a run ahead and ran in a long time you could probably tell that now but anyway running down with the stripes I'm healed with the stripes I'm healed with the stripes I'm here and guess what my body had to obey with the stripes I'm healed with the stripes I'm healed yummy [Applause] you don't take what the devil tell you hallelujah just like their loves maybe a year ago I think was my mother law a friend or whatever it was amen the doctor say you know you die and she said did Jesus tell you that if Jesus didn't tell you where do you get your information from you don't receive those bad reports like that y'all know it you know because when the doctors bring out stuff you know they give it the worst report and they want to see you cry and if you don't cry they gonna look at you until they keep working it they get pleasure especially seeing Christians cry or you say I'm a Christian or they wanted a dick coming at you you got to start praising God you got cancer hallelujah praise guts scared them to death oh my god he's God I don't know who your God is my God is God my God made your medicine you know say my God made you and I'm not against medicine but I can't stand when a when a doctor try to act like he's God mmm y'all say they don't guess they do I remember my last baby my yeah my next to the last baby my wife was having a hard time I mean they treated her really bad at that hospital and wouldn't they need to give her a c-section and they wouldn't even do it they just did whatever they did it I want to go but you know what when my wife and we didn't realize it I'm there with the scriptures and we're eating and having a wonderful time and you know contraction comes and I read a scripture something that's what we were doing and when I said to wait you know the baby was delivered me and my wife just went out was afraid and she she was so happy and that doctors always said gee thank you Jesus think that was Jesus didn't do that I did that's what the doctor said Jesus didn't do that I did I thought you wish ha I love forgive me if I was thinking wrong but that's what I thought amen you love the Lord you're the Bible said make your calling and election sure that's all I'm saying and all that we're doing we don't want to come up short and y'all gotta understand how the world got this thing like all these planes gonna be crashing and all of that stuff ain't no Christians Holly on those planes you know the two right if you know the reason why I stay afloat sometime because you own there but ain't nothing Christian about planes planes and buses you have a bill on the bus with a bus driver having y'all seen them real Christians on y'all know what I'm saying they're few shoe and the world got everything is in chaos because the rapture is taking place it will not be that way hallelujah and the only people that will know that the bride is gone will be the foolish virgins that's it like no new Enoch was gone that's it and you and I I look at this thing says listen I think that this one leave and that one leaving this backslide and that one backslide you know it's like running a race when I should run cross country when people I was not know I didn't wanna win those big trophies but I'm George running y'all understand but you know because somebody you know running you know that's why I hate to get people in front of me cuz they quit and when they quit you have something happening you like you know you can quit too you have to push harder when somebody in front of you stop running hallelujah so I'd like to stay in the front y'all know them saying I'd like to stay in the front so I can't see who's falling behind me I'm running cuz I gotta I gotta go to make I got a line to cross over y'all you me and understand by God's grace and I know y'all do I keep saying that but I'm trying to emphasize you without the Holy Ghost you have no resurrection no resurrection all your living will be in vain it's a must it's a requirement hallelujah only Jesus Christ will be in the city you understand me you called him his bride whatever you called just like I tell people I said i'ma tell you how it was if God had go into that craving says without saying calling Lazarus by his name everybody didn't agree what he got up she the name is important that's why we baptized in his name that's why when we pray we pray in his name whatever you do in word or deed do it all in his name right because when Jesus come to make a rapture he ain't gonna call Suzie Tom James Jim bah bah bah bah bah bah bah he's calling one body and that one body has one name hallelujah come on and that name is his character mmm you gotta have it take your licks take whatever you gotta go through and say thank you Jesus Lord you love me you love me and I appreciate everything that you're doing for me I do I do I got to go through it you got to go through it the folks it ain't gonna get no easier you love the Lord I feel I feel the motions to stop right now I don't know if there be anybody who desire prayer you don't necessarily need to come up but if we could just stand and have a word of Prayer you know Ephesians talks about growing up in unto Him in love it says but speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so the things that we're going to ask this is what I was trying to tell my church I said we've heard so many great mysteries I said we've heard enough mysteries to take us through I said but what about the life where is the character of Christ in the people this is what we need to see and this is what the people need to hear when listen if you packing demons ain't no demons going to heaven ain't no demons going in that city right and that's what the Bible says to who you you your members to obey that's whose servant you are I know that stuff people but is real Jesus said told is that there is no darkness in me so you can't be in Christ and have darkness in you right oh we said oh I got the Holy Ghost but the real way to say it is the Holy Ghost got me see and you and I must don't understand by God's grace that God has us all right that's what I want I don't care what is it listen what are you what is your identity don't you know if the law tarry every one of us gonna die and all you want to have above you is a tombstone my what is that even the people who got their names and lights here in in this world and they're dead what good is it all their achievements have gone down but like they did and understand just like Peter well I don't know whether yeah there is a hell there's another dimension and and if you don't go up you go down right right so you and I must understand we're we're preparing to go up right and you must be qualified it can't be well you know what qualified David be outside of his brothers was the anointing was the election of God and God's anointing it's the truth mister truth and that's that's what makes the difference between us the election with the anointing the election with the anointing an anointing don't mean that you got to be out of your mind you know per se what I'm saying is an or tickets when you have things under control spiritually right you know Jesus wouldn't win there when the waves were dashing and everything else did y'all know that's when God really blesses when troubles in your life that's when God really really blesses is that the truth yeah he Peter didn't walk on clean water he walked on the water when everything was Jesus empty speech steel so you got to understand all these things that we go through it's necessary it's a good thing dear Jesus we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we been to ourselves father we just hope and pray that something has been said tonight there's been a blessing to the people God all I know is that my heart throbs to be more like you I so thirst and desire Lord for you to consume me father father we need you more now than we ever needed you before in God have we had the power to change ourselves we would do so but this work is by the by your grace Lord and we pray father God being that you are the the carpenter and you are the workman father we pray that you work it father take all and everything out of us Lord and all we want to see is you Jesus Christ granted father we pray in your name Jesus Christ amen [Music] when he reached on his head for me when he reached down his head for me I was lost head and God without God for his son when he reached down his head for me I was nearing the span I was near ring this fell when he came to me dead and he showed me that could be free there he live dad might be gave me glory company when he reached down his head for me oh when he read down his head for me I'm so glad about it winner eat down is it for me [Music] I was lost and under without God and it's not when he read me you know the second Jesus the second Adam when he returned he comes
