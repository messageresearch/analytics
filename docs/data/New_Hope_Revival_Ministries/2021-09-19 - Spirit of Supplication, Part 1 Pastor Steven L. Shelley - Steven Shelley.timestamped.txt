[37:52] now thank you uh prayed for Brother
[37:55] Steve Curry on the on the phone this
[37:57] morning in the hospital and uh he was
[38:01] doing better uh less confused and they
[38:05] believed that it was the antibiotic that
[38:07] he was on they flushed that out of his
[38:09] system and he was doing very well he uh
[38:15] he said brother Shelly I want to thank
[38:17] the Lord for where I am I want to thank
[38:20] the Lord for where he has me right now
[38:23] he said I I I I don't want I'm not

[38:28] that but he said I'm thankful that the
[38:30] Lord has me where he has me right now
[38:34] and he went on to tell me testimonies uh
[38:37] uh over the last few days every time
[38:39] they're there in the cancer center they
[38:42] are meeting people nurses doctors other
[38:46] patients who really need encouragement
[38:49] who need help and neither one of them
[38:51] are ashamed to pray or embarrassed to
[38:54] pray and they just start pray praying
[38:56] for people in the hallways in the rooms
[39:00] wherever they are and God is using them
[39:03] and it humbles my heart to see the the
[39:07] spirit that they're carrying and the
[39:08] attitude that they have and the faith
[39:11] that they're
[39:12] demonstrating and uh when we prayed this
[39:15] morning that's what we prayed is that
[39:17] God would continue to do that but we
[39:19] would like to see him whole and they
[39:21] were perhaps going to do an MRI to check
[39:24] to see if there was anything else going
[39:26] on but we give God the praise for being
[39:28] with him this week and for letting him
[39:31] have Clarity and that's an awful thing
[39:34] it's a fearful thing when you're going
[39:35] through so much else so we thank God
[39:38] that they're with us and they're
[39:39] streaming this morning brother Steve
[39:42] Martell is out of the hospital and uh I
[39:46] haven't heard the verdict about his toes
[39:48] but at one time they were thinking about
[39:51] uh having to take off many of his toes
[39:54] because of the damage that he had in the
[39:57] hospital uh sister Janette and I and is
[40:01] with him I think today and taking
[40:03] helping to take care of him and uh we
[40:06] want to ask the Lord the Lord is
[40:07] touching him and speaking to him and
[40:09] helping him and we're so thankful for
[40:12] that we pray that he will come out of
[40:14] this with a great
[40:16] determination uh to do something
[40:18] wonderful for the kingdom of God you

[1:04:54] the comments here on the Facebook page
[1:04:57] but God bless you that are watching from
[1:04:59] Ghana Africa Mombasa Kenya Africa how
[1:05:04] wonderful to have you all let's
[1:05:07] see Ghana again Nuru Kenya God bless you
[1:05:13] God bless you brother Tommy in Northern
[1:05:15] Ireland it's so good to hear from you
[1:05:17] God bless you brother and what wonderful
[1:05:20] words of encouragement he has put here
[1:05:24] and there's Indiana and there's
[1:05:26] Virginia and uh I'm almost done here's
[1:05:30] just one from Canada I believe that is
[1:05:33] Alberta my what friends we have around
[1:05:36] the world we are blessed I think those
[1:05:40] are the ones that have mentioned where
[1:05:42] they're from and I'm just glad to have
[1:05:44] them a part of this service this morning
[1:05:47] Romans chapter 8 verse 26 and
[1:05:52] 27 we are going to speak this morning on
[1:05:55] the spirit of
[1:05:57] Supplication and you might call it the
[1:06:01] spirit of
[1:06:02] intercession because this is the same
[1:06:06] kind of operation in prayer
[1:06:10] supplication and
[1:06:12] intercession likewise the spirit also
[1:06:15] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[1:06:19] what we should pray for as we ought but
[1:06:23] the spirit Spirit
[1:06:25] itself maketh intercession for us with
[1:06:30] groanings which cannot be
[1:06:33] uttered and he that searcheth the hearts
[1:06:38] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:06:43] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:06:47] Saints according to the will of God how
[1:06:53] many of you know that is is effective
[1:06:55] prayer when the spirit of God is praying
[1:06:58] through you it is effective prayer I
[1:07:03] don't want to go any further before I
[1:07:04] say I know you're standing I am as well
[1:07:07] I don't want to go any further before I
[1:07:09] mention this that can be in
[1:07:13] English the spirit of God can pray
[1:07:15] through you in your native
[1:07:18] tongue with understanding the Bible said
[1:07:21] or it can be in an unknown language
[1:07:25] a language or a tongue of the spirit
[1:07:27] that you did not learn there are those
[1:07:30] who have spoken in other tongues of men
[1:07:34] that they have never learned I have been
[1:07:36] in the room when that happen
[1:07:38] supernaturally God communicated with a
[1:07:41] different people Group by speaking to
[1:07:44] them in their own language unlearned by
[1:07:46] the speaker but there are also tongues
[1:07:49] of angels and Heavenly languages that we
[1:07:53] have not come to know but the spirit may
[1:07:56] use them and may utilize them in
[1:07:59] intercession and supplication and the
[1:08:02] truth is we are not ashamed this is a
[1:08:05] talking in tongu zone that's right we
[1:08:07] believe and someone said I wouldn't want
[1:08:09] to go back to that I never left it so
[1:08:13] I'm saying this to all of my fellow
[1:08:15] brothers and sisters who follow the
[1:08:18] ministry of brother brandom I don't have
[1:08:20] to go back to Pentecost as an experience
[1:08:23] I never left that experience and I don't
[1:08:26] have to go back to speaking in tongues
[1:08:28] because I never stopped speaking in
[1:08:31] tongues we found the order of the word
[1:08:34] the word of God gives us an order
[1:08:36] doesn't he now Zechariah 12 and verse 10
[1:08:41] and then you may have your seats
[1:08:43] Zechariah 12 and10 prophecy and I will
[1:08:47] pour upon the House of David and upon
[1:08:51] the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
[1:08:55] of Grace and of
[1:08:58] supplications and they shall look upon
[1:09:01] me whom they have pierced and they shall
[1:09:04] mourn for him as one mourneth for his
[1:09:09] only son and shall be in bitterness or
[1:09:13] grief for him as one that is in
[1:09:16] bitterness for his
[1:09:19] firstborn Lord we come to you today so
[1:09:23] thankful so grateful my heart nearly
[1:09:28] explodes when I think about what the
[1:09:31] Holy Ghost has been in my life and I
[1:09:35] look across this room and I know that
[1:09:38] there are those standing here today that
[1:09:40] wouldn't be alive they wouldn't be
[1:09:42] breathing breath on this side of the
[1:09:45] curtain of time had it not been for the
[1:09:48] power of the Holy Ghost in their life so
[1:09:52] Lord we want want to emphasize today the
[1:09:56] Holy Ghost and how he operates in The
[1:10:00] Believer Lord we believe it's necessary
[1:10:03] it's not optional to have that
[1:10:06] experience it completes and finishes the
[1:10:09] new birth so around this room young and
[1:10:12] old we want to thank you for filling us
[1:10:15] for baptizing us with both the Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost and the fire of God that burns out
[1:10:23] the chest
[1:10:24] thank you for the convicting power of
[1:10:26] the Holy Ghost in our life and we thank
[1:10:29] you for how he operates in various
[1:10:32] offices and administrations to bring us
[1:10:36] into the stature of the perfect man our
[1:10:40] Lord Jesus Christ now Lord I ask that we
[1:10:43] would have ears to hear your word that
[1:10:46] you would stand against every W of the
[1:10:49] enemy for we know that there are
[1:10:52] thousands times 10 thousands of demon
[1:10:55] spirits who oppose the preaching of the
[1:10:58] revealed word and particularly that
[1:11:01] truth that was loosed under those seals
[1:11:04] and so today we're asking you Lord to
[1:11:08] stand up in this house in our midst and
[1:11:11] drive back that opposing force that that
[1:11:16] would desire and seek to hinder others
[1:11:19] from hearing and Discerning truth we are
[1:11:22] being trans formed day by day minute by
[1:11:27] minute by the truth of your word we give
[1:11:30] all the glory all the honor all the
[1:11:32] praise to our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:11:35] Christ he is Yeshua our
[1:11:37] Messiah we say
[1:11:40] amen amen amen amen you may be seated we
[1:11:44] are a blessed people come on now I need
[1:11:48] your help a little bit this morning we
[1:11:50] are a blessed people to have what we
[1:11:54] have what the blood has done for us
[1:11:57] could and should never be
[1:12:01] underestimated we could stand on our
[1:12:03] feet and praise him the duration of this
[1:12:06] day our hands in the air our mouths open
[1:12:10] with praise and never praise him
[1:12:12] sufficiently for what it means to us we
[1:12:16] are bumping into people all the time
[1:12:18] that have no hope no
[1:12:20] idea no
[1:12:22] answers come on
[1:12:24] miserable wretched broken families with
[1:12:28] no hope and we pray that God would use
[1:12:31] us that our lives would shine that it
[1:12:34] would count for him but we are so
[1:12:37] thankful oh my now let's slow down just
[1:12:41] a moment and I want to show you these
[1:12:44] things on the screen for you that have
[1:12:47] been making notes we are on the sixth
[1:12:51] Office of the Holy Holy Ghost I have
[1:12:55] said almost every time that I don't know
[1:12:57] if that is the right word to use maybe
[1:13:00] Administration would be a right word or
[1:13:03] it's a little more than just the working
[1:13:05] of the spirit because if we should talk
[1:13:07] about all the ways the spirit works the
[1:13:10] list would almost be endless at least it
[1:13:14] would go beyond my understanding and
[1:13:16] knowledge but it seems to me like there
[1:13:18] are at least seven specific Ministries
[1:13:23] our offices of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:13:26] life of the believer we're not just
[1:13:28] talking about his work in the earth
[1:13:30] we're talking about his work in the
[1:13:32] bride in his people and so I would like
[1:13:36] to not take a lot of time for review but
[1:13:40] I have asked them to take my notes that
[1:13:43] I gave them this morning and put it on
[1:13:45] the board for you to check up on your
[1:13:48] notes so that you would have all seven
[1:13:51] of these offices are administrations of
[1:13:55] the spirit written down so do we have
[1:13:57] that now the first four we've covered
[1:14:02] those because we're on the sixth the
[1:14:04] first four number one was the spirit of
[1:14:08] life if you need the scriptures that go
[1:14:12] along with the spirit of Life we'll be
[1:14:15] happy to provide them for you but we
[1:14:17] also point you to our app you can
[1:14:20] download the app if you haven't even
[1:14:22] those of you who are streaming this
[1:14:24] service in other nations you can
[1:14:27] download the app you can find a
[1:14:30] particular sermon in a series and you
[1:14:32] can find the the scriptures will be
[1:14:35] there the the quotations from the
[1:14:37] message of the hour will be there and
[1:14:39] you can do your own study you can study
[1:14:42] it out and let God speak to your heart
[1:14:45] personally and individually but uh this
[1:14:48] is just a brief uh naming of them again
[1:14:52] so that we can can talk today about the
[1:14:54] spirit of Supplication number one was
[1:14:57] the spirit of life he creates or
[1:15:01] recreates God's Divine Life in us how
[1:15:06] many of you remember that you are living
[1:15:08] a life that is not of this world you
[1:15:11] have graduated to a new kind of life and
[1:15:15] we are no longer our own and this is not
[1:15:18] just mortal life that we are living this
[1:15:21] is or this is not ordinary life it is
[1:15:23] out of the ordinary life not natural
[1:15:26] life but Supernatural Life by the
[1:15:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost we are infused
[1:15:32] with the very Life of Christ so that
[1:15:35] means that the very spirit that was in
[1:15:38] the Lord Jesus brother random told us so
[1:15:40] many times all that was in the father he
[1:15:44] emptied that into the son no wonder
[1:15:47] Jesus could say when you've seen me
[1:15:48] you've seen the father you had because
[1:15:52] all that was in the father father was
[1:15:54] now residing in him the son I didn't
[1:15:56] just make that up how many of you know
[1:15:59] that's red letter that's red letter if
[1:16:02] you've got red letters in your Bible it
[1:16:04] just says it when you've seen me you've
[1:16:06] seen the father and yet he says I can do
[1:16:09] nothing on my own unless I see him or
[1:16:12] hear him then I am Duty bound to keep my
[1:16:16] peace so there was something moving on
[1:16:18] the inside of him and it had to be this
[1:16:21] way he had to come
[1:16:23] both as God and man the Divine Life had
[1:16:28] to condescend to a natural life so that
[1:16:31] you and I could be reconciled to a great
[1:16:34] God what a plan are you with me then
[1:16:38] look this way there's nobody in here
[1:16:41] more interesting than I am right now cuz
[1:16:44] I'm bringing you God's
[1:16:46] word number two the spirit of Truth the
[1:16:53] Spirit of Truth oh my this is one of the
[1:16:57] things that we can get so disturbed
[1:16:58] about when we see the world around us
[1:17:02] falling into darker and darker error
[1:17:05] knowing that even you and I have been on
[1:17:08] such a journey shedding things along the
[1:17:11] way that were not of Truth we all had
[1:17:14] training we all had teaching we don't
[1:17:17] Proclaim to have or understand or know
[1:17:20] all the truth yet but the truth is being
[1:17:24] revealed it's being revealed by the Holy
[1:17:27] Ghost and so I appreciate the office
[1:17:30] that he holds in our lives as the spirit
[1:17:33] of Truth he is bringing us to a more
[1:17:36] perfect revelation of God one of the
[1:17:40] things that the prophet talked about
[1:17:42] that I love so much is he talks about
[1:17:45] God being so expansive so big so
[1:17:49] multifaceted so
[1:17:51] multi-dimensional that he would be still
[1:17:55] continuing to reveal himself throughout
[1:17:58] all
[1:18:00] eternity that blows my mind when we see
[1:18:04] him we will know him for we will be like
[1:18:08] him and yet there will still be more
[1:18:11] about him that we will have revealed to
[1:18:14] us throughout all eternity like peeling
[1:18:17] the layers of an onion you will know yes
[1:18:21] you will know and you will understand it
[1:18:24] better by and by and all of these
[1:18:26] different things but wouldn't that be
[1:18:28] something to be in eternity you're not
[1:18:30] worried anymore once you step into that
[1:18:33] realm you're not worried about what you
[1:18:35] didn't understand that's right you know
[1:18:38] you can make a list of questions you
[1:18:40] want to ask him oh I can't wait to get
[1:18:43] there to ask I just want you to know
[1:18:45] that when you get there your list ain't
[1:18:47] going with you you won't even worry
[1:18:49] about why what will matter when you see
[1:18:52] him
[1:18:53] but what an eternity to think about
[1:18:55] Brother Richard is the possibility of
[1:18:57] sitting at his feet and one day him
[1:19:00] looking down and saying
[1:19:02] Richard Stephen do you remember when you
[1:19:06] didn't understand such and such here's
[1:19:08] the reason why oh it wasn't worrying you
[1:19:11] or troubling you you were at peace with
[1:19:13] him in eternity but he
[1:19:16] remembered and he said I wanted to show
[1:19:18] you something I wanted you to see now
[1:19:21] what all of that was about somebody said
[1:19:24] I just can't imagine that I can't really
[1:19:25] imagine it either but I believe that
[1:19:27] there's a God that we serve that is so
[1:19:29] big that we couldn't possibly register
[1:19:32] it all at one time so he just keeps on
[1:19:35] revealing even the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:37] Christ is so big we can't get it all at
[1:19:40] one time even the truths that were found
[1:19:43] beneath those seven seals are so big
[1:19:46] that we can't perceive it all at one
[1:19:48] time so God just keeps on revealing
[1:19:51] himself as the spirit Spirit of life as
[1:19:54] the spirit of Truth number three we
[1:19:57] talked about the spirit of adoption and
[1:20:00] that Spirit of adoption is transforming
[1:20:03] us from little immature
[1:20:07] babies yes little
[1:20:12] crying
[1:20:17] whining
[1:20:19] selfish you all can
[1:20:21] preach I was get to
[1:20:27] pouting I had my mama look down at me
[1:20:30] and say Stephen Shelly I could walk to
[1:20:33] town on those
[1:20:35] lips anybody know what that means I was
[1:20:39] pouting and I pooched my lips out so far
[1:20:43] pouting like a little brat and she'd say
[1:20:46] I could walk to town on those on those
[1:20:50] lips she said you get over here I'm
[1:20:53] going to pinch you under the
[1:20:55] arm boy my mama knew how to set me
[1:20:58] straight in a
[1:21:00] hurry that hurt more than a than a
[1:21:03] paddle on my leg because she didn't have
[1:21:06] much Mercy when she was twisting I I've
[1:21:09] looked at her many times said Mama I
[1:21:11] think you're taking a plug right out of
[1:21:12] my arm she said I hope I might she said
[1:21:15] I might I might I don't ever want to
[1:21:17] have to have this conversation again we
[1:21:20] all can be pouty when we're immature
[1:21:24] somebody didn't Shake our hands somebody
[1:21:26] didn't speak to us somebody didn't
[1:21:29] acknowledge us somebody didn't brag on
[1:21:31] our
[1:21:32] children you know one thing and then
[1:21:34] another and it gets even diff more
[1:21:37] difficult than that in a close-nit
[1:21:39] community because we're just constantly
[1:21:41] stepping on one another not
[1:21:43] intentionally but it's near impossible
[1:21:46] to know what you're thinking at all
[1:21:48] times why you would kill a pastor if all
[1:21:52] he had to do was spend his time trying
[1:21:54] to figure out what you were
[1:21:57] thinking so that I wouldn't step on you
[1:22:01] you understand this can be a very
[1:22:03] vicious cycle and if you're a person who
[1:22:06] believes the whole universe revolves
[1:22:08] around you I want you to know that
[1:22:10] Authority doesn't leave your door right
[1:22:13] in your home the whole world may revolve
[1:22:15] around you but once you step out of that
[1:22:17] home Brothers amen once you step out of
[1:22:20] that home you will quickly find that the
[1:22:22] whole world doesn't revolve around you
[1:22:24] there's a whole world going on out there
[1:22:27] and they don't even know sometime even
[1:22:29] Brothers and Sisters in Christ we don't
[1:22:31] even know sometimes when people are
[1:22:33] offended that's right I was reading
[1:22:35] Paul's note this morning uh on Facebook
[1:22:38] before I ever got out of bed about 6:00
[1:22:40] and I was rejoicing with him for the
[1:22:42] victory that that he has made in making
[1:22:45] himself Desiring to be more healthy what
[1:22:47] a wonderful thing and in that worthy to
[1:22:50] be to be celebrated and to be mentioned
[1:22:53] and you that are neighbors you know he
[1:22:55] has you know he's telling the truth not
[1:22:57] only because of losing weight but
[1:22:59] because you've seen him putting in the
[1:23:01] work but did you know sometimes people
[1:23:04] will get
[1:23:05] offended at someone celebrating a
[1:23:08] victory that they worked really hard to
[1:23:11] get and not even recognize that the
[1:23:14] celebration is not to bring attention to
[1:23:16] oneself it's to inspire somebody else
[1:23:20] now I know Paul enough to know that when
[1:23:22] he what he said he said because he
[1:23:24] wanted to inspire me and he wanted to
[1:23:27] inspire you to do the same thing how
[1:23:29] many of you know that's what brothers
[1:23:31] and sisters do for each other but
[1:23:33] there'll be people offended by such as
[1:23:35] that there'll be people that'll say
[1:23:37] things like why you're calling me
[1:23:41] fat see we we are being moved from
[1:23:44] something little like that to something
[1:23:47] a whole lot more mature than that this
[1:23:50] is not the only church age that's had to
[1:23:52] deal with the immaturity of the believer
[1:23:55] it started in the first church age the
[1:23:57] Ephesian Church age where Paul was the
[1:23:59] Apostle come on now and he was
[1:24:01] constantly having to talk to the people
[1:24:04] about how they behaved among themselves
[1:24:06] the attitude that They Carried when they
[1:24:08] got into public meeting the way they
[1:24:10] were treating one another the way they
[1:24:12] esteemed one another amen the way they
[1:24:14] compromised with each other Spirits
[1:24:16] instead of calling each other out to
[1:24:18] Deliverance he had a lot to say about it
[1:24:21] but I want you to know that something
[1:24:23] has happened in this last Church
[1:24:25] age there is a power and an authority
[1:24:29] that is available to you and I as a
[1:24:31] Believer that's even more potent than it
[1:24:34] was in the first church age because we
[1:24:37] are the generation that has to overcome
[1:24:40] there has to be a people in the last of
[1:24:43] the last days that go all the way back
[1:24:45] to the beginning and say this is what we
[1:24:48] must possess as children of the Lord
[1:24:50] Jesus Christ we must have the healing
[1:24:53] virtue among us we must be able to cast
[1:24:56] out devils in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ we must see Miracles and signs
[1:25:01] and wonders as the Bible has promised
[1:25:04] and no generation has been better
[1:25:06] positioned to inherit those things than
[1:25:09] this one because Jesus is no longer
[1:25:12] hiding himself behind the
[1:25:14] lattice he's no longer clothing himself
[1:25:18] in any kind of religious expression but
[1:25:20] he has now stepped out from behind the
[1:25:23] veil Hallelujah and if you want to find
[1:25:26] where he is he's coming up out of the
[1:25:27] Wilderness that's where he is you heard
[1:25:30] what brother Shaw said where is he he's
[1:25:32] coming up out of the Wilderness and
[1:25:34] guess what I see when I see him I see a
[1:25:37] little bride walking out of that
[1:25:39] Wilderness with him by the grace of God
[1:25:42] she smells just like he smells his
[1:25:46] anointing and his fragrance is upon her
[1:25:50] who is this that I see come coming out
[1:25:53] of the Wilderness hallelujah it's the
[1:25:55] Bride of Jesus Christ leaning her head
[1:25:59] on her beloved listening to his
[1:26:02] heartbeat Desiring to do his
[1:26:05] Works
[1:26:07] Hallelujah yes and all hell is against
[1:26:11] that truth all hell is against that
[1:26:15] Revelation now you can let somebody keep
[1:26:17] you back you can let somebody hold you
[1:26:19] back if you want to but I'm telling you
[1:26:22] you'll have nobody to blame on the
[1:26:23] Reckoning day but
[1:26:25] yourself it's up to you and I to say no
[1:26:30] one I think the old church may have had
[1:26:33] more victory over that than we did
[1:26:35] because they said if Mama don't
[1:26:38] go you know I had to sing that for a
[1:26:41] long time and mean
[1:26:45] it if Mama don't go if Daddy don't go if
[1:26:50] brother don't go and sister don't go and
[1:26:51] neighbor don't don't go I can't let it
[1:26:53] hinder me I got my eyes on the prize you
[1:26:57] may still be under a denominational
[1:26:59] spirit and you may think the prize is a
[1:27:02] mansion or a gold Street or a pearly
[1:27:05] gate but I want you to know that's not
[1:27:07] the goal the goal is Jesus Christ he's
[1:27:11] the goal to have him to be found in him
[1:27:15] that's the goal that's what we're
[1:27:17] pressing toward we're pressing toward a
[1:27:20] high calling and that High Calling is to
[1:27:23] be found in the image and the character
[1:27:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:27:30] we're not going to walk barefooted we're
[1:27:32] not going to walk in a robe we're not
[1:27:34] going to conduct ourselves like they did
[1:27:36] in second temple period That's not we're
[1:27:38] what we're talking about we're talking
[1:27:40] about IR relevant people not because
[1:27:43] they have fashioned themselves after the
[1:27:45] the making of this old world but because
[1:27:48] they have held to a truth let me tell
[1:27:50] you something Jesus is more relevant
[1:27:53] than anything I know he is not outdated
[1:27:57] or oldfashioned or Antiquated he is the
[1:28:00] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:28:04] lives and he is just as able to move
[1:28:07] among us today as he was in the book of
[1:28:09] Acts as he was in the Ephesian Church
[1:28:11] age or any of the other Church Ages come
[1:28:14] on now do you believe that this Spirit
[1:28:17] of adoption is calling us into a higher
[1:28:20] way yes into an ascended life oh yes one
[1:28:25] that is not so influenced by the howling
[1:28:29] winds around us or someone's harsh look
[1:28:34] but we're Rising above that with our
[1:28:36] eyes on
[1:28:37] Jesus oh can you see him can you see the
[1:28:42] Lord I see him in his word I hear him in
[1:28:45] the messages that I listen to I see him
[1:28:48] and hear him when I open my bible I see
[1:28:51] the Lord there when I look at my
[1:28:53] brothers and sisters here this morning I
[1:28:55] see
[1:28:56] Jesus I know that he's with us you know
[1:29:00] that's something to dance about that's
[1:29:02] something to celebrate don't despise my
[1:29:04] praise or I may get worse than I already

[1:29:09] that's within me because I know there's
[1:29:11] Victory every time we break through our
[1:29:13] feeling and we break through our
[1:29:15] physical

[1:29:21] don't want you to see it's none of your
[1:29:23] business I'm not going to show you my

[1:29:33] that saw my elbow they said I'll never

[1:29:37] several weeks it's been so swollen and
[1:29:40] so much fluid in it it doesn't really
[1:29:42] hurt me that much but it's so ugly I
[1:29:45] look like a old man sister Sandy looking
[1:29:48] at my elbow this one looks good and this
[1:29:51] one looks like an old person somewhere
[1:29:53] sitting in an a old aged home and when I
[1:29:56] started to praise the Lord this morning
[1:29:58] it was pinching a little bit and a pain
[1:30:01] kind of R radiated down my shoulder I
[1:30:03] want you to know I have no intention of
[1:30:08] not giving him praise I have no
[1:30:11] intention of not lifting up my hand and
[1:30:14] praising the Lord you know that the
[1:30:17] enemy will whispered you know you people
[1:30:19] know get in your knees your the enemy
[1:30:21] will whis say you're going to make it
[1:30:23] worse you really suffer now I tell you I
[1:30:27] don't believe it I don't believe it and
[1:30:30] you don't have to believe it you make up
[1:30:32] your mind to give God praise I feel
[1:30:35] victory in this house
[1:30:39] Hallelujah I feel Victory I'm standing
[1:30:43] on that Victory I pray it reaches down
[1:30:46] right now into that hospital room where
[1:30:49] our brother is laying I pray the victory
[1:30:52] of the Holy Ghost will move for him in
[1:30:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[1:30:59] God manifest who you are manifest who
[1:31:03] you
[1:31:04] are
[1:31:06] Hallelujah just above Nan manifest who
[1:31:09] you are so we this Spirit of adoption
[1:31:13] Works patiently in US anybody thankful
[1:31:17] for the patience I'm so
[1:31:20] thankful I don't know about you but
[1:31:23] sometimes I hear the spirit of the Lord
[1:31:24] saying to my heart didn't we go over
[1:31:28] this didn't we already go over this
[1:31:32] haven't we already walked through this
[1:31:34] need I remind you
[1:31:37] again and I say yes
[1:31:43] papa I just blame it on anything I said
[1:31:46] yes Lord yes papa I'm one of those that
[1:31:49] sometimes looking for their phone while
[1:31:50] it's in his hand
[1:31:53] I I'm one of those that can forget a lot
[1:31:55] of things I have I've forgotten a lot of
[1:31:58] things and so I need to be
[1:32:01] reminded because these things are a lot
[1:32:03] more important than where my phone is or
[1:32:06] whose birthday I missed these things are
[1:32:09] lifechanging what the spirit of God
[1:32:12] desires to teach us in this hour we need
[1:32:14] patience we need him to be patient with
[1:32:16] us and he is and this Spirit of adoption
[1:32:20] is working in us until we can be Paul
[1:32:22] the sons of knowledge and I don't think
[1:32:24] that is in any way referring to head
[1:32:25] knowledge is it it's referring to
[1:32:28] knowing him in in Intimacy in a personal
[1:32:33] relationship and in capital letters
[1:32:35] they're mature sons and this is a people
[1:32:39] who are being made mature spiritually
[1:32:42] but I want you to know that maturity is
[1:32:44] not limited to the spirit and soul of
[1:32:47] man to the mind and the will and the
[1:32:49] emotions of man but it will also Al
[1:32:51] transfer into the way we live our lives
[1:32:55] so we've got to quit
[1:32:59] pouting we got to quit marching out of
[1:33:02] here like little
[1:33:03] babies when somebody's got on our
[1:33:05] feelings run to get in our vehicle so we
[1:33:08] don't have to speak to somebody we're
[1:33:10] going to have to grow up above that kind
[1:33:12] of behavior God's holy ghost is in Us by
[1:33:15] the spirit of adoption working patiently
[1:33:19] in us until we can be called the sons of
[1:33:22] knowledge the sons of intimacy the
[1:33:25] mature sons of God number four thank you
[1:33:28] ladies you've done a great job the
[1:33:30] spirit of
[1:33:31] Holiness it causes our relationship to
[1:33:34] grow into the realization and revelation
[1:33:38] of his
[1:33:42] Holiness woo his
[1:33:46] Holiness you all got a
[1:33:49] minute good I want to read you on
[1:33:52] something it'll take me just a
[1:33:56] minute I got to read the right
[1:34:02] one when I'm gone I I y'all can just
[1:34:08] delete all that's in the cloud just
[1:34:10] delete it all you can delete all 400,000
[1:34:14] of the pictures that I have there and
[1:34:16] that's not even all my per just delete
[1:34:18] them all nobody will care after that but
[1:34:20] when I find something I like I have to
[1:34:22] take a picture of it or write it down or
[1:34:24] something so I can remember it I know
[1:34:26] you're not that way I can tell by the
[1:34:27] way you're looking at me but I'm that
[1:34:30] way and this is what one of my friends
[1:34:32] posted this week on social media and you
[1:34:35] might have seen it and just about the
[1:34:38] time I think Lord I just don't have time
[1:34:41] to keep up with that anyway and there's
[1:34:43] so much preaching against it and I don't
[1:34:45] want to be guilty of doing something I
[1:34:47] shouldn't do just about the time I do
[1:34:49] that someone reaches out and says says
[1:34:52] now that you are streaming your services
[1:34:55] live and on the internet without my life
[1:34:57] is
[1:34:58] transformed my questions are answered
[1:35:02] and so I say no I'm not going to turn
[1:35:03] loose of social media just yet I'm going
[1:35:06] to try my best to keep it in its place
[1:35:08] and I encourage you to do the same thing
[1:35:11] but here one of my friends posted this
[1:35:13] in order to believe the lie this is
[1:35:15] going to be a you know some people don't
[1:35:17] believe security like I do you cannot
[1:35:19] believe in the sovereignty of God
[1:35:22] and not understand that there is
[1:35:23] security to the believer and you're not
[1:35:26] going to go out of here and live like
[1:35:27] the devil if you've really been born
[1:35:30] again you may slip you may slide you may
[1:35:33] have some issues but I want you to know
[1:35:36] the old fear of the old church system no
[1:35:39] longer resides in the heart of the
[1:35:41] believer we we don't live this life
[1:35:43] because of fear we're not walking
[1:35:46] different and talking different and
[1:35:47] dressing different because we're afraid
[1:35:50] that's right we're doing it as an
[1:35:51] offering of Thanksgiving to God for what
[1:35:54] he has accomplished on our behalf are
[1:35:56] you with me but someone put this little
[1:35:58] uh slogan up it says in order to believe
[1:36:01] the lie that you can lose your salvation
[1:36:04] you must first believe the lie that you
[1:36:06] have earned your
[1:36:11] salvation now you may not think that's
[1:36:13] good but I think that's good I think
[1:36:16] that's good because all the fear that
[1:36:18] tries to torment somebody I'm going to
[1:36:21] if I'm losing this I'm losing that or
[1:36:24] I'm going to miss the Rapture I'm going
[1:36:25] to all of this fear that will paralyze
[1:36:28] you it won't listen fear has never
[1:36:31] produced
[1:36:32] conviction true
[1:36:35] fear fear will never produce
[1:36:38] genuine
[1:36:39] conviction fear usually releases
[1:36:43] condemnation but when you get to a place
[1:36:45] to see what God has done for you on your
[1:36:48] behalf then your heart can't thank him
[1:36:51] enough and your life wants to follow and
[1:36:54] you want to glorify him and honor him
[1:36:57] can you say Amen the final three I don't
[1:37:00] mean to Rattle on so the final three
[1:37:03] we've talked about the spirit of Life
[1:37:05] the spirit of Truth the spirit of
[1:37:06] adoption the spirit of Holiness and now
[1:37:09] we're mentioning the spirit of Grace
[1:37:11] that's the last one that we covered it
[1:37:13] governs the attitudes and actions of the
[1:37:17] believer who has learned to walk in
[1:37:20] dependence
[1:37:22] not independent but in dependence on the
[1:37:27] Holy Spirit you can't earn
[1:37:32] it you don't deserve
[1:37:35] it without the Holy Spirit every one of
[1:37:38] us are going to fall right on our Noggin
[1:37:40] head we are never going to be successful
[1:37:43] living in a higher Place living a
[1:37:46] spirit-led life if we don't learn to
[1:37:49] depend I mean depend on the Holy Ghost
[1:37:54] the problem with my Pentecostal
[1:37:56] background is there was too much
[1:37:58] emphasis on a Feeling there's nothing
[1:38:00] wrong with feeling I'm not ashamed to
[1:38:03] feel the presence of the Lord but a
[1:38:06] feeling can come and go you can feel
[1:38:10] something and not be changed by
[1:38:11] something but we're not emphasizing just
[1:38:14] how you feel whether you're you're
[1:38:16] getting a hair to stand up on your arm
[1:38:18] or a goosebump or something like that
[1:38:20] this the Holy Ghost has come to do a
[1:38:22] whole lot more than just talk in a
[1:38:24] tongue or make you feel accelerated or
[1:38:27] exhilarated this Holy Ghost has come to
[1:38:30] lead us and to guide us and to govern
[1:38:33] our lives and draw us closer and closer
[1:38:37] to the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:38:39] if you're with me you could squeeze out
[1:38:41] an amen this Grace governs the attitudes
[1:38:45] and actions of the believer who has
[1:38:48] learned to walk in dependence on the
[1:38:51] Holy Spirit how many of you are
[1:38:52] depending on the Holy
[1:38:56] Ghost oh for years they've come against
[1:38:58] us and said you mean to tell me you
[1:39:00] believe that somebody has to have the
[1:39:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost to go in the
[1:39:05] Rapture and by the way I do believe that
[1:39:08] by the way I do believe that but here's
[1:39:10] my response to that I don't see how in
[1:39:13] the world you can go to
[1:39:16] Walmart talk about going to heaven
[1:39:18] without the Holy Ghost why the CRA iest
[1:39:21] place in all the world Walmart is
[1:39:23] crazier than a juke
[1:39:27] joint I'm being honest with you that's
[1:39:29] one of the craziest places that I have
[1:39:31] ever been and we have to go yes people
[1:39:33] have to go I don't have to go but people
[1:39:35] have to
[1:39:36] go I go maybe twice a
[1:39:39] year why you don't want to be a lot yes
[1:39:43] with all my heart I want to be a light
[1:39:46] but I have to be prayed up oh
[1:39:50] yeah because
[1:39:53] Insanity swirls around us in this old
[1:39:57] world people have lost all sense of
[1:40:00] respect and all sense of dignity come on
[1:40:04] now they don't care how they look they
[1:40:07] might just be walking around in their
[1:40:08] underwear yes they don't have to worry
[1:40:11] about
[1:40:13] security nobody's going to say anything
[1:40:15] to them about that and somebody said and
[1:40:18] I want you to know you would never
[1:40:21] understand unless you knew the the
[1:40:23] hideousness of what goes on in public
[1:40:26] places like that in the hour that we're
[1:40:29] living in right now because people are
[1:40:31] so
[1:40:32] sick they are so oppressed they are in
[1:40:35] such trouble so you pray up when you go
[1:40:38] it used to be that the the mothers used
[1:40:41] to say to me brother Shel if I've got
[1:40:42] more than two children and I take them
[1:40:44] to Walmart in the buggy it disturbs
[1:40:47] everybody in the store cuz they
[1:40:49] everybody's looking and pointing and
[1:40:51] carrying on because I've got more than
[1:40:52] two kids and that's not the norm well I
[1:40:55] want you to know you got to worry about
[1:40:56] a whole lot more than that in this hour
[1:40:59] because people have got a whole lot more
[1:41:01] things than that on their mind we need
[1:41:03] to be prayed up we need to send our
[1:41:06] families out prayed up come on now we
[1:41:09] need to pray over them when they go out
[1:41:12] and we need to pray over them when they
[1:41:13] come back because this is a critical and
[1:41:16] serious hour we're living in we are
[1:41:18] thankful for the grace of God to govern
[1:41:21] and Lead our gu our attitudes and our
[1:41:23] actions to help us to walk in dependence
[1:41:26] on the Holy Spirit and we are being led
[1:41:29] by the Lord and when he wants you into
[1:41:30] that environment you go prayed up with
[1:41:33] the whole armor of God on and you go and
[1:41:35] be ready to do what God would have you
[1:41:37] to do number two this is the one we're
[1:41:40] going to begin to look at today and then
[1:41:42] we'll finish up after camp meeting time
[1:41:45] the spirit of
[1:41:47] Supplication the spirit of Supplication
[1:41:50] are because the word intercession in
[1:41:53] Hebrew and Greek is so similar to the
[1:41:57] meaning of the word supplication I feel
[1:41:59] like we can easily use those two and
[1:42:03] even exchanging if we need to the spirit
[1:42:06] of Supplication or the spirit of
[1:42:09] intercession it executes the office of
[1:42:12] prayer that's in the life of the
[1:42:14] believer now I want you to know Holy
[1:42:17] Ghost prayer is powerful prayer the
[1:42:21] power that we have is not just power in
[1:42:26] prayer cuz we're not the only people who
[1:42:28] pray to a
[1:42:29] deity it's not just the Avenue of prayer
[1:42:33] that gives us the power but it's knowing
[1:42:36] who we're praying to and it's even
[1:42:39] allowing the Holy Ghost to pray in us
[1:42:42] and through us that makes the prayer of
[1:42:44] the believer so effective in this hour I
[1:42:47] believe in being specific in our prayer
[1:42:49] but I also believe believe in knowing
[1:42:51] from the very beginning that what you
[1:42:53] want more than anything else in all the
[1:42:56] world is for his kingdom to come and his
[1:43:00] will to be done on Earth as it is in
[1:43:04] heaven my charismatic friends would wear
[1:43:07] me into the ground praying against every
[1:43:09] fire and every storm and every volcano
[1:43:13] and every wind that blows and I don't
[1:43:16] listen brother sister I can't live that
[1:43:19] kind of Life chasing down on everything
[1:43:21] that's going on in
[1:43:23] nature come on the charismatics are
[1:43:26] somehow caught up in this idea I got to
[1:43:29] speak to this and shake my stick at that
[1:43:31] and deal with it I believe I believe
[1:43:34] that when God gives you an assignment to
[1:43:36] pray against something like that you
[1:43:38] better do it and God will honor it but
[1:43:42] if you don't have the mind of the spirit
[1:43:45] concerning a certain thing especially
[1:43:48] when it might be the judgments of God
[1:43:50] poured out upon a nation that has
[1:43:52] forsaken a living God somebody said what
[1:43:56] about innocent people I want you to know
[1:43:58] there's never been a time that judgment
[1:44:00] didn't fall that innocent people were
[1:44:03] not caught up in that kind it rains on
[1:44:06] the just and the unjust but my prayer is
[1:44:09] God be
[1:44:11] merciful and I don't ever have to worry
[1:44:14] about him answering that prayer that's
[1:44:16] right he's merciful and when people you
[1:44:20] know get get on one tangent or another
[1:44:23] here's the answer here's the answer this
[1:44:26] week I've had requests to pray against
[1:44:28] forest fires to pray against a hurricane
[1:44:31] forming in the Gulf people write out
[1:44:33] brother Shelly I know you believe in the
[1:44:35] authority of prayer would you please
[1:44:37] pray my response has to be thy kingdom
[1:44:43] come thy will be done on Earth as it is
[1:44:47] in heaven naam said God is a god of the
[1:44:49] Whirlwind I will I want you to know
[1:44:51] sometimes he uses wind and storms
[1:44:54] sometimes he uses
[1:44:55] rain sometimes he uses the elements he
[1:44:58] created the earth I know the enemy is
[1:45:01] the prince of the power of the air but
[1:45:02] anytime God wants to use what he created
[1:45:04] he has power and authority to do so he
[1:45:07] is talking I want to say to this church
[1:45:10] before we we we uh move on or finish up
[1:45:13] or whatever we do I want to say again to
[1:45:15] this church God is
[1:45:17] speaking in
[1:45:19] 2021 God is speaking somebody said the
[1:45:23] devil is howling and the Heathen are
[1:45:25] raging you are absolutely right but I
[1:45:28] want you also to know that even though
[1:45:30] the devil is howling and the Heathen are
[1:45:32] raging God is still speaking to his
[1:45:37] people and he's leading them and
[1:45:40] directing them and breaking through in
[1:45:43] their life because that's who he is it
[1:45:47] don't always look like a earth
[1:45:49] shattering Revival when God moves and
[1:45:51] speaks but I want you to know more is
[1:45:53] shifted in his voice than we can see
[1:45:57] with a natural eye God is speaking oh he
[1:46:02] is so the spirit of Supplication
[1:46:04] executes the office of prayer governing
[1:46:07] the communication between our spirit and
[1:46:10] God it's a two-way communication between
[1:46:14] him him and his sons he's called us to
[1:46:17] this it's not just us talking to him in
[1:46:20] the Spirit but it's him talking to us by
[1:46:22] the spirit how many of you know that's
[1:46:24] what communication is prayer is not a
[1:46:26] one-way Street and if you pray and say
[1:46:29] amen and jump up and you don't give God
[1:46:31] a chance to talk to your heart or to
[1:46:34] make something real to you you're
[1:46:35] missing out on the very benefit and the
[1:46:39] Very privilege of prayer maybe you've
[1:46:41] understood the responsibility of prayer
[1:46:43] but you've never understood the the
[1:46:45] great benefit of prayer the benefit of
[1:46:48] prayer is it pushes all the stuff out of
[1:46:51] you that needs to get out you are laying
[1:46:54] yourself before the Lord in humility and
[1:46:57] in honesty knowing you may lie to
[1:46:59] everybody around you but you don't lie
[1:47:01] to the Holy Ghost he already knows the
[1:47:04] truth so you just very transparently lay
[1:47:07] out who you are and what your needs are
[1:47:09] hang around a moment hang around a
[1:47:12] moment and see if God won't Quicken
[1:47:14] something to you how many of you know if
[1:47:17] you've prayed in the spirit when you get
[1:47:19] up from prayer or when you move away
[1:47:21] from prayer you are
[1:47:25] changed somebody said I didn't feel any
[1:47:28] better you didn't pray in the
[1:47:30] spirit you really going to say something
[1:47:32] like that yes I am if you have
[1:47:35] approached the Living God with sincerity
[1:47:38] and faith and you didn't feel better in
[1:47:40] the depth of who you are you didn't pray
[1:47:43] in the
[1:47:46] spirit because when we pray in the
[1:47:49] spirit when we know not let's look at
[1:47:51] that again real quick Ro Romans uh let's
[1:47:54] go back and look at our reference that
[1:47:56] we had just a moment
[1:47:59] ago Romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also
[1:48:09] helpeth I don't want to get ahead of
[1:48:11] myself but I
[1:48:12] will that word helpeth in the Greek
[1:48:17] 4878 listen to what it means it means to
[1:48:21] to join
[1:48:25] with this is the Holy Ghost joining with
[1:48:30] you in your
[1:48:32] weakness I I'm not making this up that
[1:48:35] word infirmity one of the meanings of
[1:48:38] that word infirmity is
[1:48:41] weakness in fact it refers specifically
[1:48:44] to an ailment that deprives someone of
[1:48:48] enjoying what they would like to
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:52] do I'm reading that right out of the
[1:48:54] Lexicon so your infirmity it's not just
[1:48:57] your
[1:48:58] sickness your infirmity may be anything
[1:49:01] that hinders you from enjoying the
[1:49:04] benefit of who you are as a born again
[1:49:06] Holy Ghost filed child of God it might
[1:49:09] be a root of bitterness it might be a
[1:49:11] spirit of unforgiveness it may not be a
[1:49:13] physical
[1:49:14] mality something else trying to hinder
[1:49:17] you so look at what the Holy Ghost does
[1:49:19] he comes along side of
[1:49:22] us it says uh he joins in to take hold
[1:49:29] with us at the side to take a share in
[1:49:35] the Holy Ghost is taking a share in your
[1:49:38] weakness yes he's taking part of the
[1:49:42] load of your
[1:49:44] infirmity he is standing right beside
[1:49:47] you to help you get through the trial
[1:49:51] and the struggle
[1:49:56] woo I know that's so simple I don't know
[1:49:59] why it excites me
[1:50:01] so maybe that's CZ I spend a whole lot
[1:50:04] of my life
[1:50:06] praying and I need
[1:50:09] help prayer will wear you
[1:50:13] out yes prayer will wear you out why
[1:50:17] don't somebody just be real pray will
[1:50:20] wear you
[1:50:23] out sometimes I sit behind a preacher
[1:50:25] and
[1:50:26] pray and I am almost as exhausted when I
[1:50:30] get home as if I would have preached the
[1:50:32] sermon a few Sundays ago when I led the
[1:50:35] worship I went home and laid down the
[1:50:36] rest of the
[1:50:37] day because you're in a battle it is a
[1:50:41] battle when you try to do something for
[1:50:44] the kingdom of God it is a battle and it
[1:50:47] takes a physical effect on the body and
[1:50:50] prayer will wear you out body it'll wear
[1:50:53] you out
[1:50:54] mentally if you try to win the battle by
[1:50:57] yourself you'll shrink in defeat every
[1:50:59] time but if you'll allow the Holy Ghost
[1:51:02] to pray through
[1:51:04] you whether in English with
[1:51:07] understanding or whether in a tongue
[1:51:09] that you have never learned or whether
[1:51:11] in a
[1:51:14] groan or a grunt yes you say wait a
[1:51:17] minute brother Shel I can show it to you
[1:51:19] yes
[1:51:21] or a sigh oh Lord knows I do not like
[1:51:31] sighing it wears me out to be around
[1:51:34] people who sigh all the
[1:51:41] time this isn't a sighing in the natural
[1:51:44] like we have a tendency to do because we
[1:51:46] didn't suck enough
[1:51:48] oxygen
[1:51:50] this is sighing in the spirit this
[1:51:55] is have you ever been praying you run
[1:51:58] out of
[1:51:59] wind you run out of energy you run out
[1:52:02] of words let me tell you something
[1:52:05] children of God as intercessors as those
[1:52:07] who approach God in supplication we
[1:52:10] cannot lose if we learn to pray in the
[1:52:16] spirit likewise the spirit also helpeth
[1:52:20] I'm not through with the definition he
[1:52:21] joins in to help to take hold of with at
[1:52:24] the side to take a share in generally to
[1:52:29] Aid or assist to give assistance with
[1:52:33] full initiative to become closly
[1:52:36] identified with this is the spirit of
[1:52:40] almighty God that lives inside of the
[1:52:43] overcoming
[1:52:44] believer that
[1:52:46] desires to become closely
[1:52:50] identified with your
[1:52:52] weaknesses with your
[1:52:55] infirmities with your needs he's not
[1:52:58] hanging you out there somewhere to
[1:53:02] dry watching you squirm when you get in
[1:53:05] a mess he's raising up if you yield to
[1:53:09] him he's raising up I feel the holy
[1:53:13] ghost telling me to tell somebody in
[1:53:16] this church your answer will be found if
[1:53:21] you will pray in the
[1:53:24] spirit thank you Lord you are spinning
[1:53:28] your wheels in prayer because you are
[1:53:31] praying it your
[1:53:34] way thank you when we refuse to discern
[1:53:38] the mind of the spirit and we continue
[1:53:41] to pray out of our
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:44] opinion or out of an old
[1:53:48] Paradigm or an old
[1:53:50] mindset prayer becomes a Geral wheel no
[1:53:54] wonder people give up on prayer no
[1:53:57] wonder you can't call people to a prayer
[1:53:59] meeting because they give out esteem
[1:54:01] praying for things that they don't even
[1:54:03] need to be praying
[1:54:10] about I listen to people's prayer
[1:54:12] requests and I think you must think now
[1:54:16] this going to sound a little rough so
[1:54:17] just buckle up and I'm loving you and I
[1:54:21] think you must think that's all anybody
[1:54:24] has time to do is pray over 11 dozen
[1:54:29] different thoughts concerning that one
[1:54:32] prayer
[1:54:34] need I I get prayer I get people send me
[1:54:40] directives with 13 ways to pray for
[1:54:43] their loved one in the
[1:54:47] hospital and I just want to say I don't
[1:54:50] because I understand unless the spirit
[1:54:51] teaches you differently you don't know
[1:54:53] better but I just want to say sometime
[1:54:56] do you want me to pray in the
[1:54:58] spirit or do you want me to pray on what
[1:55:01] you figure out is going to be the best
[1:55:03] solution come on I'm being honest I know
[1:55:05] some of you getting your feelings hurt
[1:55:07] because you asked me for prayer don't
[1:55:09] worry honey when you ask me for prayer I
[1:55:12] let the Holy Spirit do the praying
[1:55:15] because like you I have learned that he
[1:55:18] knows best
[1:55:20] [Applause]
[1:55:23] pray they put him on this
[1:55:28] drug if you have asked me to do that
[1:55:30] please forgive me for being so
[1:55:32] bold no no you really want me to pray
[1:55:37] you want us to believe that we're a book
[1:55:39] of Acts
[1:55:40] people who have all power and authority
[1:55:43] by the Holy Ghost and then you're
[1:55:44] telling me what drug you want them
[1:55:48] on oh it's going to get real quiet come
[1:55:51] on Josh help me I need some help from
[1:55:52] somebody
[1:55:56] here you see if that is your mentality
[1:56:00] you still believe that life is held in
[1:56:04] the hands of men and
[1:56:08] women I can't do that I can't do that
[1:56:11] folks you pray that way you pray that
[1:56:15] God will take them off of one drug and
[1:56:16] put them on another drug and hook them
[1:56:18] up to this and take them off of that and
[1:56:20] do the other the only prayer that I have
[1:56:22] prayed like that is I have asked the
[1:56:24] Lord to bring every one of these that
[1:56:26] we've been praying for quickly to a
[1:56:28] place where they can get off that
[1:56:31] ventilator because I know the longer
[1:56:33] they're on that ventilator the less
[1:56:34] likely they are to come off of it I am
[1:56:36] not a doctor but that is the opinion of
[1:56:38] Medical Science so I have honestly
[1:56:41] prayed that Lord whatever you need to do
[1:56:43] in that body you restore that body you
[1:56:46] heal that body you deliver in that poty
[1:56:50] so they can get off of that but I
[1:56:51] haven't prayed Lord let them uh decide
[1:56:54] to give them Ivermectin or hydroxy
[1:56:56] chloroquin or give them more Z or zinc
[1:56:59] or C or any of that kind of stuff let me
[1:57:01] tell you something if you've got time to
[1:57:03] pray like that go right ahead but the
[1:57:05] spirit of Supplication and intercession
[1:57:08] is living inside of you by the power of
[1:57:11] the Holy Ghost and if you let the Holy
[1:57:14] Ghost pray he will always pray the mind
[1:57:17] of the spirit let me say one more time
[1:57:20] I'm not just talking about praying in
[1:57:24] tongues I'll show you right in the Bible
[1:57:26] the Bible says I will pray in the spirit
[1:57:29] I will pray with understanding I will
[1:57:31] sing in the spirit I will sing with
[1:57:34] understanding it's all in the spirit
[1:57:36] it's all in the spirit you may know
[1:57:38] exactly what you're asking God you may
[1:57:40] not know a word you
[1:57:42] said what sounds to you like a grunt a
[1:57:44] groan and a sigh what sounds to you like
[1:57:47] a few loose syllables
[1:57:52] I tell you what it is it's God praying
[1:57:55] In You by the Holy
[1:57:59] Ghost somebody said you think you know
[1:58:01] what he's
[1:58:02] saying yeah I think I do
[1:58:07] sometime you know what he's saying
[1:58:09] sometime thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:58:12] done on Earth as it is in
[1:58:15] heaven Jesus wasn't just wasting A good
[1:58:18] sermon to preach on the Lord's
[1:58:20] Prayer and by the way that prayer
[1:58:22] doesn't belong to the Lord that was a
[1:58:24] gift the lord gave you that prayer
[1:58:26] that's your prayer that's not the Lord's
[1:58:28] prayer that is your prayer that is my
[1:58:32] prayer and it was given to us as an
[1:58:35] example of how we should approach him
[1:58:37] you will never go wrong by spending time
[1:58:40] acknowledging the might and the Splendor
[1:58:42] and the sovereignty and the awesomeness
[1:58:45] and the hallowed of a living God oh
[1:58:48] you'll never go wrong approaching him as
[1:58:50] your papa you'll never go wrong calling
[1:58:53] on him as your ABA as your papa as your
[1:58:55] father he is
[1:58:57] that and he has placed in you as a belie
[1:59:01] you sound like you're mad I'm
[1:59:04] sorry it's that old style I'm sorry I
[1:59:09] can't hardly help it people will
[1:59:11] sometimes ask do you really have to yell
[1:59:13] like that do you have to spit like that
[1:59:16] no if I was more talented in the natural
[1:59:18] I could just stand up here and present
[1:59:20] my lecture and it would have the same
[1:59:22] effect but since I don't have all that
[1:59:25] skill I have to depend on unction and
[1:59:27] inspiration and I have to depend on that
[1:59:30] anointing to come and sometimes I feel
[1:59:32] as dry as a
[1:59:34] board and sometimes I feel him coming so
[1:59:37] fast I can't get it all out fast enough
[1:59:40] come on and I can't judge that by
[1:59:42] whether you amen or not cuz we have some
[1:59:45] of the most fickle amen amers around
[1:59:48] here of any church I've ever been in
[1:59:50] involved with you'll come in here one
[1:59:51] service and amen and act like you've got
[1:59:53] the Victory and you're going to stand by
[1:59:55] the word and you're going to support
[1:59:57] your pastor and then you'll have three
[1:59:59] services where you won't even
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:05] smile what a man ought to do what what
[2:00:07] we going to do we're going to keep on
[2:00:09] doing what we know to do we're going to
[2:00:12] keep on knocking on the
[2:00:14] door we're going to keep pushing back
[2:00:16] the forces of Darkness until deliver
[2:00:19] reaches every
[2:00:20] Pew until it reaches every family until
[2:00:24] it reaches every life because that's
[2:00:27] what we're after to see total
[2:00:28] Deliverance in every person that we love
[2:00:31] in every person that we know we want to
[2:00:34] see total Deliverance what some people
[2:00:36] call Freedom is not Freedom at all I
[2:00:39] want I want this kind of Freedom that
[2:00:41] Jesus said I want to make you I want to
[2:00:44] create you freedom I I want to place you
[2:00:46] in such a state of Liberty in such a
[2:00:48] state of freedom that nothing the enemy
[2:00:50] tries to rip you up and tie you up in
[2:00:52] tangle you up in will have any effect on
[2:00:55] you at all because you'll answer every
[2:00:57] accusation with the word of the Lord in
[2:00:58] your mouth how we how do we do that by
[2:01:00] the spirit so so please my my my uncle
[2:01:05] is in trouble he has such and such would
[2:01:07] you pray for him I want you to know
[2:01:09] something brother sister most of the
[2:01:11] time we can take that right there to God
[2:01:15] let the Holy Ghost present the need say
[2:01:18] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[2:01:20] Earth as it is in heaven God knows every
[2:01:22] nurse listen you got to remember this
[2:01:24] God knows every doctor every nurse and
[2:01:26] every drug he knows them
[2:01:29] all he looks at most of it like
[2:01:32] sorceries anyway but I'm telling you
[2:01:33] right now he knows it
[2:01:39] all it is it he knows you don't have to
[2:01:44] tell him which one to
[2:01:47] do there's an old I tell you there's an
[2:01:50] evil oppressive spirit in this nation
[2:01:53] that wants to keep help away from people
[2:01:56] who need help that's what disturbs us
[2:01:59] that's what gets our goat but I want you
[2:02:02] to know God knows how to
[2:02:04] bypass he knows how to bypass every red
[2:02:08] tape uh uh
[2:02:10] bureaucracy politics in medical oh he
[2:02:14] knows how to bypass every bit of that by
[2:02:17] the Holy Spirit he does likewise the
[2:02:20] spirit also helpeth our infirmities that
[2:02:22] word infirmities is weakness and it
[2:02:24] refers to en ailment that deprives
[2:02:26] someone of enjoying what they would like
[2:02:29] to do so here comes the Holy Spirit to
[2:02:31] stand right beside you and to pray with
[2:02:34] you and to carry the burden and the
[2:02:36] infirmity and the weakness with you you
[2:02:38] are never alone I'm telling you today
[2:02:40] you are never alone when Jesus is on
[2:02:43] board when the Holy Ghost is in your
[2:02:45] life you are never alone no matter how
[2:02:48] dark or how dire the need
[2:02:50] is now we would much rather see uh
[2:02:53] people just close their eyes and go home
[2:02:56] when God is ready for them but I want
[2:02:58] you to know we don't get to choose the
[2:03:01] details there are some things that we
[2:03:04] have control over and there are some
[2:03:06] things that we don't have control over
[2:03:08] but we must understand that God is
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:12] good he does not make a mistake he's
[2:03:17] talking can I say again and the time I
[2:03:19] have left he is
[2:03:22] talking when he takes somebody from this
[2:03:25] Earth he is
[2:03:28] talking when he spares somebody and
[2:03:30] leaves them here when it looks like they
[2:03:32] were going to leave this earth he is
[2:03:36] talking we don't always want to hear
[2:03:39] what he has to say but he is talking can
[2:03:42] I go ahead and break the rest of this
[2:03:43] verse down he said likewise the spirit
[2:03:46] also helpeth our infirmities for we we
[2:03:48] know not what we should pray for as we
[2:03:50] ought have you ever been
[2:03:52] there I'm so sorry to
[2:03:55] admit that I have been there more times
[2:03:57] than I would want to name there have
[2:04:00] been times that I have been on the phone
[2:04:02] praying for Brother Steve Curry and
[2:04:03] sister Anita and words just
[2:04:07] absolutely just fail me in the
[2:04:09] natural I'm
[2:04:13] honest we're so used to being able to
[2:04:15] tell God what to do there you go that's
[2:04:18] right and then all all of a sudden we
[2:04:20] get in a situation where we don't feel
[2:04:23] like we can tell him what to do or how
[2:04:26] to do and we don't hardly know what to
[2:04:29] pray yes this is what a lot of prayer is
[2:04:32] there's a lot of people that spend their
[2:04:34] entire prior life which isn't much
[2:04:37] telling
[2:04:41] God it's not about telling God it's
[2:04:44] about spread spreading your
[2:04:47] petition
[2:04:49] now when God speaks to your heart and
[2:04:51] the Holy Spirit touches God he may give
[2:04:54] you some things to decree and to declare
[2:04:58] and to announce and to prophesy and to
[2:05:01] Proclaim are you with me and you need to
[2:05:04] do that with every fiber of your being
[2:05:07] but don't do that as though you're
[2:05:08] directing
[2:05:10] God CU he knows already is there really
[2:05:13] anything you can tell him in a detail of
[2:05:15] something you know well I wish you could
[2:05:17] have heard what they said when nobody
[2:05:18] was listening I overheard the doctor say
[2:05:20] so and so and Lord I got to tell you
[2:05:22] about it don't you know the Lord
[2:05:26] heard don't you know the Lord heard let
[2:05:28] me tell you something prayer could be
[2:05:30] revolutionary for all of us we could
[2:05:32] pray the most powerful corporate prayers
[2:05:34] of any group of people on the face of
[2:05:36] the Earth if we could get some of this
[2:05:37] in our
[2:05:40] spirit when we start down this road
[2:05:42] there's too many people that say I think
[2:05:44] that's kind of making lie to prayer I
[2:05:45] think that you're so
[2:05:47] wrong you're so wrong you keep on doing
[2:05:50] it your way that is up to you but I'm
[2:05:53] telling you what the word says the word
[2:05:55] says if we will let the spirit that's
[2:05:57] why I am not going to apologize to any
[2:05:59] of you and I'm not going to apologize to
[2:06:02] message Believers around the world if
[2:06:05] you happen to tune into a service and
[2:06:07] you hear us praying for somebody in
[2:06:09] tongues I'm not going to apologize to
[2:06:11] you just want you to know that because I
[2:06:15] know there's a time when we don't know
[2:06:17] what to
[2:06:19] pray I wished I always knew what to say
[2:06:22] and what to pray but I don't always yet
[2:06:25] know what the spirit's mind is when we
[2:06:29] don't know he comes and stands beside us
[2:06:32] helping us with our weakness and with
[2:06:33] our infirmities for we know not what we
[2:06:36] should pray for as we ought but the
[2:06:42] spirit what's that next word
[2:06:45] itself you become a vessel yeah now I
[2:06:49] don't want you to look at this as though
[2:06:51] the Holy Ghost is doing all the praying
[2:06:53] and you're doing nothing that's not why
[2:06:55] God gave you the Holy Ghost he didn't
[2:06:58] come to do the praying for you he came
[2:07:01] to do the praying with you brother ski
[2:07:05] that's right with you that's what
[2:07:08] helpeth our infirmities means he wants
[2:07:11] to pray with you he wants you to
[2:07:14] cooperate with him in
[2:07:17] prayer are not our
[2:07:20] will for we know not what we should pray
[2:07:22] for as we ought thank you for those of
[2:07:24] you who are still with me but the spirit
[2:07:26] itself maketh intercession same word we
[2:07:30] could almost say right there
[2:07:31] supplication for us yes that word
[2:07:35] intercession means on behalf of to turn
[2:07:39] to to appeal to to intercede in the
[2:07:43] behalf of someone to plead for someone
[2:07:48] to
[2:07:49] follow
[2:07:50] someone interesting words that wasn't
[2:07:53] just Bible definitions from a Bible
[2:07:56] dictionary that was words from the
[2:07:58] Lexicon telling us what the real word
[2:08:01] intercession there means it means making
[2:08:04] an appeal laying a petition and he does
[2:08:08] that itself the spirit itself does that
[2:08:11] for us because we can't do it by ourself
[2:08:16] with groanings yes with
[2:08:22] groanings which cannot be
[2:08:25] uttered
[2:08:27] groanings that word groanings in the
[2:08:30] Greek means an
[2:08:33] involuntary expression of great concern
[2:08:37] or
[2:08:39] stress a sigh or a
[2:08:43] groan an involuntary expression of great
[2:08:47] concern turn or
[2:08:49] stress a sigh or a groan how many of you
[2:08:54] have ever had news fall on your
[2:08:57] life so D urgent so urgent so
[2:09:03] serious that all you could do was say oh
[2:09:10] God somebody said that's not a very
[2:09:12] effective prayer it is if the spirit is
[2:09:17] groaning
[2:09:19] there are times that all we can do is
[2:09:20] say
[2:09:22] Jesus I don't mean using his name like a
[2:09:25] curse word or taking his name in vain as
[2:09:29] some some
[2:09:31] slang I mean in when the when the when
[2:09:34] when you see the car leaving the
[2:09:38] road or you see a deer heading your
[2:09:42] way or you see tragedy about to fall or
[2:09:45] you're own 250 which is becoming one one
[2:09:48] of the most dangerous roads in our
[2:09:51] community because you often meet people
[2:09:54] on your side of the road and they don't
[2:09:56] even seem to know I wish somebody tell
[2:09:59] those dump trucks coming out of
[2:10:01] Sedona that they are going to have to
[2:10:03] stay in their Lane when they turn or
[2:10:06] wait until the oncoming traffic turns
[2:10:08] they don't they turn right out in front
[2:10:11] of your lane and if you're not expecting
[2:10:12] them to pull out you don't know they're
[2:10:14] pulling out they will meet you many many
[2:10:16] times on your side of the road lay down
[2:10:18] on the horn perhaps and look at you like
[2:10:20] you've lost your mind and your attitude
[2:10:23] is probably I would have yielded to you
[2:10:24] if I had known you were coming out if I
[2:10:26] have just know you were I'm not here to
[2:10:28] hinder what you're doing I just want to
[2:10:30] pass there's so much danger like that
[2:10:33] and maybe you see something like that
[2:10:34] happening and you don't have time to say
[2:10:36] now Lord what would you have me to
[2:10:42] do my granny said to me when she was
[2:10:46] leaving the Revival that I was preaching
[2:10:48] in montavo Alabama and she was coming
[2:10:51] through Montgomery and there was a whole
[2:10:52] lot going on in her life there was a
[2:10:55] whole lot going on in my life I was
[2:10:57] pastoring a church in South Carolina I'd
[2:11:00] been called down to an Assembly of God
[2:11:02] Church in monavala where we had had a
[2:11:04] glorious Revival some 10 years
[2:11:07] before and they had invited us and I
[2:11:10] told them you know we're no longer
[2:11:11] Assembly of God we're preaching a a
[2:11:14] strong Holiness message and but they
[2:11:16] invited us anyway and Grant came to the
[2:11:18] meeting and some of you met some of the
[2:11:20] folks that came out of that Revival I
[2:11:22] hear from some of them from time to time
[2:11:25] doing great things for the kingdom of
[2:11:27] God and I'm so happy that they came to
[2:11:29] the Lord in those meetings I wish they
[2:11:32] were with us I wish some of them would
[2:11:34] have come all the way with us but I'm so
[2:11:36] thankful that they're in better
[2:11:37] condition than they were in those days
[2:11:39] and Granny left and she drove that big
[2:11:42] old Lincoln Town Car through Montgomery
[2:11:44] and she was coming along that road there
[2:11:46] where the airport is on one side of the
[2:11:49] road and there was a car coming down her
[2:11:53] Road granny was already sick but we
[2:11:56] didn't know what was wrong and she was
[2:11:58] pushing through anyway she didn't go to
[2:12:01] doctors and
[2:12:03] so all we knew to do was
[2:12:06] pray and uh she saw a car coming there
[2:12:10] was nowhere to go there was a car in the
[2:12:12] other lane there was a car coming in the
[2:12:14] other uh two lanes it was a four lane
[2:12:16] there there's a little section I think
[2:12:18] where it's a four lane and she said I I
[2:12:22] only had enough time to say Lord I'm
[2:12:26] ready because she said the first thought
[2:12:28] that came to my mind was I'll never get
[2:12:30] slowed down I'll never get out of the
[2:12:32] way I don't know whether they're ready
[2:12:34] to meet you or
[2:12:36] not I know that I'm ready to
[2:12:39] go and she jerked the wheel and when she
[2:12:42] did she flipped the car in a ditch that
[2:12:46] runs along there hit a covert flipped
[2:12:48] flipped again she was a large woman it
[2:12:51] threw her out of the
[2:12:53] windshield and sat her down this is the
[2:12:55] odd thing that nobody can quite
[2:12:57] understand sat her down propped up
[2:13:00] against the passenger side we don't know
[2:13:02] if she crawled there or if the Lord put
[2:13:04] her there we don't know how it happened
[2:13:06] but she was sitting down with her back
[2:13:08] propped up against the uh passenger I'm
[2:13:10] not passenger I said passenger I meant
[2:13:12] driver driver side door she was driving
[2:13:15] alone she went out the windshield and
[2:13:17] yet when when they got there she was
[2:13:18] sitting up and had her purse which is so
[2:13:24] odd cuz the first thing my grandy did
[2:13:26] when she got in the vehicle was throw
[2:13:27] that purse in the back seat and you
[2:13:29] better not be sitting there or it would
[2:13:30] take you
[2:13:32] out cuz that purse was more like a
[2:13:34] suitcase I'll tell you that right now I
[2:13:36] mean a big one it had Pockets Galore but
[2:13:40] anyway I know of course I'd have to tote
[2:13:42] it sometimes she'd say my shoulder's
[2:13:44] hurting so bad I'd say I guess it is
[2:13:46] she'd say you're going to have to tote
[2:13:48] this a little while I said I just can't
[2:13:50] hardly do it yes you
[2:13:53] are she said I didn't have time to do
[2:13:59] anything but she said the first thought
[2:14:01] was I don't know if that person is ready
[2:14:04] to meet the Lord or
[2:14:06] not that person listen now that person
[2:14:09] didn't even
[2:14:10] stop there's no doubt in my mind they
[2:14:13] saw what happened be almost Unthinkable
[2:14:17] that that could happen happened to them
[2:14:18] not know it maybe so but they kept right
[2:14:21] on going when the do when the when the
[2:14:24] ambulance got there it had taken the
[2:14:26] flesh from her forehead and peeled it
[2:14:30] down and there was a piece of skin and
[2:14:32] flesh of her forehead about that size
[2:14:35] flapped down over her ey one eye and
[2:14:37] nose and most of the other eye and the
[2:14:40] do the the um EMT said ma'am we're going
[2:14:44] to have to put you in an ambulance she
[2:14:47] said no I don't I don't want to go to
[2:14:48] the
[2:14:49] hospital she said I don't want to go to
[2:14:51] the hospital she said I don't I try not
[2:14:52] to go to doctor she said I put my hope
[2:14:54] and my trust in the Lord and she said I
[2:14:57] try not to go to doctor he said well I
[2:14:59] sure do appreciate that ma'am but he
[2:15:01] said this time I think we're going to
[2:15:02] have to get a little help let the Lord
[2:15:03] get a little help and she said no he
[2:15:06] don't need any help but maybe I
[2:15:09] do she said would you do me a favor and
[2:15:13] he said yes ma'am she said call my
[2:15:14] grandson I'll give you his number he's
[2:15:17] holding in a Revival a couple hours up
[2:15:19] here from monavala he will pray for me
[2:15:22] and God will heal me and I won't need
[2:15:25] the
[2:15:26] ambulance she said I he he said ma'am I
[2:15:30] just can't I can call but he said how
[2:15:32] about we get you in the ambulance and we
[2:15:34] call on the way and I let your grandson
[2:15:36] pray for you and that's what they
[2:15:39] did now I want you to know something
[2:15:41] when you're in a situ I hope you never
[2:15:43] get in a situation like that but when
[2:15:45] you're in a situation and you don't know
[2:15:47] how to pray and what to pray isn't it
[2:15:50] good to know that the spirit of God in
[2:15:52] you knows the best way she just said I
[2:15:57] the only thought that come to me was I
[2:15:58] don't know if they're ready to meet the
[2:15:59] Lord and I pulled out of their
[2:16:02] way almost to her death but you know
[2:16:05] what the Lord wasn't ready for her she
[2:16:09] had three about three more years of life
[2:16:12] that he wanted her to live here on this
[2:16:14] Earth and there's no way in the world he
[2:16:17] was going to let her be taken out one
[2:16:19] minute before his plan was finished and
[2:16:23] God did heal her in a miraculous way
[2:16:27] they told her they told her one day that
[2:16:29] she had about seven places in her ribs
[2:16:32] that were broke and they felt sure that
[2:16:34] she had broke vertebrae and by the next
[2:16:37] day she lay there in that hospital I
[2:16:39] think it was Mar St Margaret or
[2:16:42] something like that Margaret's in in
[2:16:44] Montgomery and she lay there in that
[2:16:46] hospital and I was there when when they
[2:16:47] walked in and they said there are no
[2:16:49] broke
[2:16:51] ribs there are no broke
[2:16:54] vertebrae she said we did find something
[2:16:56] on the lung when we were x-raying and we
[2:16:58] want to check that out and that did end
[2:17:00] up being something pretty bad but she
[2:17:03] something she would have not known about
[2:17:05] had she not she give God praise she said
[2:17:08] Lord I want to thank you at least I know
[2:17:11] what's going on and I put my life in
[2:17:13] your hand when we don't know how to pray
[2:17:16] when we don't have time to form the
[2:17:20] words when we don't even know what to
[2:17:23] ask God to do in your own life haven't
[2:17:26] you ever been in a fix where you didn't
[2:17:29] even know what would help you I don't I
[2:17:32] know that I have a need but I don't even
[2:17:34] know what my need is I don't even know
[2:17:36] what it would take to help me but oh I
[2:17:39] feel him I feel him I feel him I feel
[2:17:42] him oh thank you Lord for the spirit of
[2:17:46] Supplication thank you for the
[2:17:48] intercession of the Holy
[2:17:51] Ghost pleading on our behalf it might be
[2:17:55] English words of wisdom it might be God
[2:17:57] directing your words it might be
[2:18:00] syllables coming out of your mouth of a
[2:18:02] language you never learned it might be a
[2:18:04] groaning sound uh it could be an
[2:18:07] involuntary expression of great concern
[2:18:10] or stress that's what the word groan
[2:18:12] there is but the spirit itself maketh
[2:18:15] intercession fors with groanings with s
[2:18:17] sounds which cannot be uttered and that
[2:18:21] word uttered is more like the word
[2:18:25] articulated it means spoken with
[2:18:28] understanding it means impossible to be
[2:18:31] expressed in ordinary words too deep to
[2:18:35] be expressed in
[2:18:38] language it can be groanings and tears
[2:18:43] and cries and sigh and even Grunts and
[2:18:47] other expressions of our heart and our
[2:18:49] spirit in prayer that are taken by the
[2:18:52] Holy Spirit and made into effectual
[2:18:56] intercession Before the Throne of God oh
[2:18:59] I want to read that to you
[2:19:01] again it's referring to groanings and
[2:19:04] tears and cries and sigh and even Grunts
[2:19:08] and other expressions of our heart and
[2:19:10] Spirits in prayer that are taken by the
[2:19:13] Holy Spirit and made formed into
[2:19:16] effectual inter ession Before the Throne
[2:19:18] of God oh what a holy ghost we have that
[2:19:22] he could take my groan or my sigh or my
[2:19:27] sound or syllables in a language that I
[2:19:30] have never learned and the Holy Ghost
[2:19:32] can form all of that that sounds like
[2:19:35] confusion to the Natural ear he can form
[2:19:38] all of that into intercession into
[2:19:42] supplication lay it right before the
[2:19:44] Throne of God and see God move are you
[2:19:48] with me yes we need to go I'm so
[2:19:52] thankful for this the Apostle Paul here
[2:19:56] isn't just talking about speaking in
[2:19:58] tongues or in an unknown language he was
[2:20:01] also referring to tears and groanings
[2:20:04] and cries and
[2:20:06] size this can include tongues I'm not
[2:20:10] ashamed of
[2:20:11] tongues and tongues is prayer and praise
[2:20:15] both prayer and praise in syllables and
[2:20:18] sounds that the speaker doesn't
[2:20:21] understand but it's made effective by
[2:20:23] the Holy Spirit coming alongside of us
[2:20:26] and helping us to pray the mind of the
[2:20:29] spirit when we don't even know our own
[2:20:32] mind the Holy Ghost in us and it goes on
[2:20:35] to say in verse 27 and searcheth the
[2:20:40] hearts
[2:20:42] knoweth what is the mind of the
[2:20:46] spirit because he maketh intercession
[2:20:50] for the
[2:20:52] Saints according to the will of God that
[2:20:55] word searcheth there means to diligently
[2:20:58] examine to seek to investigate the
[2:21:02] spirit of Supplication In You by the
[2:21:05] Holy Ghost
[2:21:08] investigates examines the
[2:21:11] heart to know what is the mind that word
[2:21:15] know is to perceive receive mentally
[2:21:19] seeing seeing that becomes
[2:21:23] knowing understanding and comprehension
[2:21:26] look at that he searcheth the hearts and
[2:21:29] the minds of the spirit because he
[2:21:32] maketh intercession he searcheth the
[2:21:35] hearts and he that searcheth the hearts
[2:21:39] knoweth what is the Mind sees it
[2:21:43] understands it comprehends what is the
[2:21:46] mind that word word mind means the inner
[2:21:49] perspective the way of thinking the
[2:21:51] purpose the the innermost
[2:21:55] personal
[2:21:58] understanding this is what the Holy
[2:22:00] Spirit
[2:22:02] does he knows the perspective of God he
[2:22:07] knows the plan of God when we pray in
[2:22:10] English we pray according to what we
[2:22:12] know or if we just pray in the natural
[2:22:14] we pray according to what we know but we
[2:22:16] don't know it all
[2:22:18] I can't know five minutes into the
[2:22:20] future unless the Holy Spirit catches me
[2:22:22] up to know I don't even know what's
[2:22:24] going to happen next unless he should
[2:22:25] reveal it to me but when you pray in the
[2:22:28] spirit the spirit sees from eternity to
[2:22:30] Eternity he doesn't just see the end of
[2:22:32] this problem are you with me he didn't
[2:22:35] just see a solution for this situation
[2:22:38] he sees eternity he sees everything in
[2:22:40] order he knows exactly what the future
[2:22:43] is going to look like aren't we blessed
[2:22:45] yes aren't we blessed to have a holy
[2:22:47] ghost like this oh yes we
[2:22:52] are I'm not nearly done with this but I
[2:22:56] want to give you just a few quotations
[2:22:57] before we
[2:22:58] go I've got a lot more that I need to
[2:23:02] give you I want to talk to you
[2:23:04] about what kind of a person you
[2:23:08] are you see man is a
[2:23:13] spirit you are a spirit who has a
[2:23:18] soul that Soul connects you with the
[2:23:21] environment through your mind and your
[2:23:24] will and your
[2:23:25] emotions and you live in a body that is
[2:23:28] physical
[2:23:29] flesh you are not a soul you are not a
[2:23:32] body you are a spirit that has a soul
[2:23:35] and that lives in a
[2:23:37] body you were created in the image of
[2:23:40] God and God is a spirit he was not a
[2:23:42] soul he was not a body he was a spirit
[2:23:45] and you're created in that image image
[2:23:47] and you're placed here in this Earth
[2:23:50] with the ability through your soul to
[2:23:52] contact your Earthly and natural
[2:23:55] environment because in that soul is
[2:23:57] where the mind and the will and the
[2:23:58] emotions and the senses begin to operate
[2:24:01] again I know this will be different from
[2:24:03] some of our friends who follow the
[2:24:05] message of the hour it doesn't matter to
[2:24:08] me if you'll just exchange those words
[2:24:11] you can go right back to how you see it
[2:24:14] but I have no choice but to see it like
[2:24:17] Thessalonians says in 1 Thessalonians
[2:24:20] 5:23 let's look at that just a moment 1
[2:24:23] Thessalonians 5:23 and the Very God of
[2:24:26] Peace sanctify you holy and I pray
[2:24:30] God I'm sorry I gave you that a little
[2:24:32] out of
[2:24:33] order and I pray God your whole spirit
[2:24:38] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[2:24:42] until the coming of our Lord Jesus
[2:24:45] Christ when we understand that we are a
[2:24:47] spirit who has a soul that lives in a
[2:24:50] body we'll understand the effectiveness
[2:24:53] and the power of praying in the spirit
[2:24:57] it takes us back to our original
[2:25:03] existence you are a not a body
[2:25:08] first you were we're not Mormon I think
[2:25:12] sometimes I know Believers I think
[2:25:13] they're really Mormon in their in their
[2:25:15] idea because they preach pretty much the
[2:25:18] pre-existence of
[2:25:21] souls Adam was not first a
[2:25:26] soul God created for him a body in the
[2:25:29] earth realm and then he breathed into
[2:25:32] him
[2:25:34] Spirit he breathed into him and because
[2:25:37] God breathed into him it he had to have
[2:25:39] something to be able to function between
[2:25:42] spirit and body and so God gave him a
[2:25:45] soul a mind a will and emotions and all
[2:25:48] these things function in such a
[2:25:49] beautiful way you didn't pre-exist as a
[2:25:51] soul you didn't pre-exist as a
[2:25:53] body your spirit is the first thing
[2:25:56] about
[2:25:59] you you may believe that that was formed
[2:26:01] on the day you were born but I don't
[2:26:04] believe
[2:26:07] that I believe if we could age our
[2:26:10] spirit our spirit would be the oldest
[2:26:11] thing about
[2:26:13] us where were
[2:26:15] you
[2:26:17] when the morning
[2:26:24] Stars worship before the
[2:26:27] throne I don't know what it looked
[2:26:30] like but all I know is God had you on
[2:26:33] his
[2:26:34] mind before the world was ever
[2:26:37] formed he created you a body in your
[2:26:40] mother's womb so that he could place
[2:26:42] that little spirit in
[2:26:44] it and it would become a living
[2:26:47] Soul there's something about
[2:26:50] understanding how we were created that
[2:26:53] helps us to understand how we're
[2:26:54] supposed to function in prayer because
[2:26:57] prayer again is not a one-way street
[2:27:00] it's two ways of communication my spirit
[2:27:03] communicating with his Spirit his Spirit
[2:27:05] communicating with my spirit it's Spirit
[2:27:09] fellowship and before we leave this
[2:27:11] world God's going to have a little bride
[2:27:13] down here who communicate one with
[2:27:15] another Spirit to Spirit instead of all
[2:27:17] the other ways we contact one
[2:27:20] another there is an invisible Union
[2:27:23] there is a Oneness that's that's coming
[2:27:26] it's in us but it has not had its total
[2:27:29] reality and function even though so many
[2:27:32] people would like to say it has but when
[2:27:35] that
[2:27:36] functions it places such a brotherly
[2:27:39] kindness in us which by the way is above
[2:27:45] godliness it places such a fraternal
[2:27:48] affection in
[2:27:49] US brother brandham refers to it often
[2:27:52] as perfect
[2:27:54] love without perfect love we can't have
[2:27:57] a body
[2:27:58] change is anybody with me and perfect
[2:28:01] love is not something that we can
[2:28:03] manufacture that's
[2:28:05] right not in our condition on this
[2:28:08] planet perfect love is only something we
[2:28:11] can be birthed
[2:28:13] into and if you know anything about
[2:28:15] birth you will understand it comes with
[2:28:17] a squeeze I don't mean to
[2:28:20] be you know too blunt but it comes with
[2:28:23] quite a
[2:28:25] contraction and there's going to be
[2:28:27] quite a
[2:28:29] contraction quite a
[2:28:31] squeeze that pushes us into that place
[2:28:35] where perfect love
[2:28:37] abounds it's going to take it for the
[2:28:39] Rapture it's going to take it for a body
[2:28:43] change we're going to have to have it
[2:28:47] I believe the more we pray in the spirit
[2:28:49] the more we allow the spirit of God to
[2:28:51] saturate Our Lives the closer we get to
[2:28:53] that moment that we can fully yield to
[2:28:56] his perfect love the love that he has
[2:28:58] for you and I is
[2:29:05] perfect may God give us the same
[2:29:09] expression let me just share one thing
[2:29:11] with you here a couple couple quotations
[2:29:13] one is from the message believing
[2:29:15] God you still
[2:29:17] here
[2:29:20] 1952 still the truth he said so
[2:29:24] therefore that's the reason said the
[2:29:26] prayer of faith shall save the
[2:29:28] sick an individual's
[2:29:31] prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a
[2:29:36] righteous man availeth
[2:29:39] much oh if you only knew that in your
[2:29:42] hand Christ gave us the authority with
[2:29:47] his name by being Christians the most
[2:29:51] powerful weapon the world has ever
[2:29:55] known
[2:29:57] prayer it even changes I want you to
[2:30:01] read that next
[2:30:05] word anybody believe it I'd say that
[2:30:09] that's the only thing that can change
[2:30:11] everything it's prayer to a sovereign
[2:30:15] merciful yet powerful God he said it
[2:30:19] even changes everything it'll change the
[2:30:23] mind of
[2:30:27] God now you have to put that in
[2:30:32] Balance there's a balance here that's
[2:30:34] important to
[2:30:37] understand here's what brother brandham
[2:30:40] tells us in that
[2:30:45] message changes
[2:30:49] everything just lost my train of thought
[2:30:52] just a moment
[2:30:59] Hallelujah I'll just keep reading then
[2:31:02] it'll change the mind of
[2:31:05] God it did do
[2:31:09] it after death was pronounced to a man
[2:31:13] he prayed God told the prophet go back
[2:31:17] and tell him I heard him see there
[2:31:22] prayer hold
[2:31:25] on I was going to say the message that
[2:31:27] brother brandom preached does God change
[2:31:30] his mind he talks about God does not
[2:31:34] change his mind concerning his
[2:31:38] word if it's the word and the will of
[2:31:42] God by the word it will not be changed
[2:31:46] but but there are certain things that we
[2:31:49] understand that prayer is so
[2:31:51] effective that it can change timing
[2:31:55] there you go it didn't change the fact
[2:31:57] that eventually Hezekiah died but it
[2:32:00] gave him an extension on his life that's
[2:32:03] the power of praying in the mind of God
[2:32:06] in the will of God in the spirit of God
[2:32:09] you understand in the in the message
[2:32:11] let's do one one or two more in the
[2:32:13] message do you now believe he said
[2:32:17] prayer is the most powerful weapon was
[2:32:19] ever put in the hand of mankind the
[2:32:23] prayer faith shall save the sick do you
[2:32:26] believe that in the message
[2:32:29] expectation of
[2:32:32] 61 prayer is the key that's the answer
[2:32:36] Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most
[2:32:40] powerful weapon that was ever put in the
[2:32:42] control of human beings there's no
[2:32:46] atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful
[2:32:50] as prayer prayer will change the mind of
[2:32:53] God did you know that it did do it one
[2:32:57] time and he goes
[2:32:59] on no that's the end of that one let's
[2:33:02] go to the next one expectations 61 a few
[2:33:06] days later he said so we believe that
[2:33:08] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[2:33:11] was ever put in the care of a human
[2:33:12] being you know prayer one time changed
[2:33:15] the mind of God did you know that he
[2:33:17] said it sure did Hezekiah was told by
[2:33:21] Isaiah the prophet that he was going to
[2:33:23] die on that bed and Hezekiah turned his
[2:33:26] face to the wall and wept bitterly and
[2:33:29] asked the Lord for 15 more years of
[2:33:34] life and God sent the prophet right back
[2:33:37] and said I've heard and he was spared
[2:33:40] for the time see when God had already
[2:33:44] announced his death but he spared him
[2:33:47] because that he prayed oh my so if
[2:33:53] prayer is that powerful what can it do
[2:33:57] by we don't realize how great it is I'm
[2:34:02] telling you when you pray in the spirit
[2:34:05] it can change everything let's stand
[2:34:09] let's stand today let's have the
[2:34:11] musicians to come back I think we barely
[2:34:14] scratched the surface but I I don't want
[2:34:17] us to uh get to a place where we can't
[2:34:21] follow along anymore and I'm wearing you
[2:34:23] out and I don't want to do that I'm so
[2:34:26] thankful that God has given us the
[2:34:28] wonderful wonderful gift of the Holy
[2:34:31] Ghost I'm thankful that prayer is such a
[2:34:34] powerful weapon but when we pray in the
[2:34:37] spirit when the spirit of Supplication
[2:34:41] when the spirit of intercession moves
[2:34:44] through the Believer by the Holy Ghost I
[2:34:47] tell you it's the most powerful weapon
[2:34:50] on the earth aren't you kind of a
[2:34:54] excited to think that God has placed
[2:34:57] that powerful of a weapon in your life
[2:35:00] how many of you feel excited that God
[2:35:02] has placed that in you I don't feel your
[2:35:04] excitement right yet but how many of you
[2:35:07] are glad God placed that right on the
[2:35:08] inside of you

[3:11:09] for it I know you did it as unto the
[3:11:12] Lord
[3:11:14] we are expecting God to move Among Us in
[3:11:18] Great and Mighty ways now I spoke with
[3:11:21] brother Elum this week and he is unable
[3:11:26] to give me a definite
[3:11:29] number and I told him that we will be
[3:11:31] flexible the best we can be because
[3:11:34] we're so delighted to have so many of
[3:11:37] them coming to worship with us they may
[3:11:40] not all be here uh at the the same time
[3:11:44] or come at the same time but by the
[3:11:47] weekend by probably Friday Saturday
[3:11:50] Sunday they will all be here and he went
[3:11:53] down the list of how many couples and
[3:11:55] how many uh young married young
[3:11:58] unmarried teenager so to speak and then
[3:12:01] children and the best number that we can
[3:12:04] come up with is between 22 and 30 now
[3:12:08] that's just going to be wonderful amen
[3:12:12] we need that extra support and we're
[3:12:15] expecting the Lord to do now we don't
[3:12:18] have uh lodging arranged for them just
[3:12:20] yet but we know that some have said I
[3:12:23] could take two ladies or I could take
[3:12:25] two young girls or I could do um they
[3:12:28] would be so happy to be in homes this is
[3:12:31] their way of doing things but they
[3:12:33] understand our situation we have a lot
[3:12:37] of men who are working during the day
[3:12:39] and not a lot of extra room in their
[3:12:41] homes EX Etc and so we have been able to
[3:12:46] uh put them in uh hotel rooms the time
[3:12:50] the two times that they have visited and
[3:12:52] the Lord has made the way and I want to
[3:12:54] present to you that uh some of them we
[3:12:57] will have to do the same it's kind of
[3:12:59] hard to book rooms because we don't know
[3:13:02] what day which ones will come and how
[3:13:05] many there will be and how many rooms
[3:13:07] we'll need on any particular night but
[3:13:09] I'm expecting to get a final report from
[3:13:12] him on on Tuesday and hopefully that
[3:13:14] will give us enough time if not and
[3:13:17] we're at the last minute unable they're
[3:13:19] kind of holding some rooms if at the
[3:13:23] last minute that doesn't work out will
[3:13:25] you just bring some empty seats in your
[3:13:28] car uh Tuesday I mean Wednesday and
[3:13:31] Thursday and Friday night and we may
[3:13:33] just send some folks home with you on
[3:13:40] pallets sounded like I was really
[3:13:42] preaching hard didn't it how that's how
[3:13:44] quiet it gets when I'm really dealing
[3:13:46] with something no I mean we were going
[3:13:48] to we're going to have to make a way and
[3:13:50] God Will Make A Way don't don't worry
[3:13:52] about that if you can help in any way uh
[3:13:56] then please let us know what you can do
[3:13:58] and if you can't do anything physically
[3:14:00] you can give extra in the offering so
[3:14:03] that the the bills are met and we can
[3:14:06] provide food for them and uh we we're
[3:14:09] just blessed this is for me fulfillment
[3:14:13] of a longtime dream God gave me a vision
[3:14:17] two visions and a dream many years ago
[3:14:20] concerning a
[3:14:22] Ministry uh to Amish people and I saw
[3:14:27] these people on the video first and when
[3:14:29] they were out in Tucson I met them in
[3:14:31] Tucson first and they're just our
[3:14:34] precious brothers and sisters they have
[3:14:36] a heart for the plain people they have a
[3:14:39] heart for those that they are uh in
[3:14:42] fellow fellowship with and related to
[3:14:44] all over the United States and God is
[3:14:47] using them they're going out they're
[3:14:49] ministering in other groups things are
[3:14:52] taking place I want us to be a part of
[3:14:55] that we had not had them in our service
[3:14:58] until last camp meeting that was the
[3:14:59] first time I have to honestly say I
[3:15:03] expected them to come in and be rather
[3:15:07] quiet but I was surely wrong because one
[3:15:11] or two of those Brothers danced until
[3:15:14] they could hardly stand up and you know
[3:15:16] that was just right for me that just
[3:15:20] that settled everything for me we've had
[3:15:24] the the last group that came on the van
[3:15:26] we had them in our home eating and we
[3:15:28] had the most wonderful Fellowship oh my
[3:15:32] wonderful Fellowship so uh and there
[3:15:35] will be others we have some friends
[3:15:36] coming from Tucson and different places
[3:15:38] so anything you can do if you can't do
[3:15:41] anything physic basically provide a meal
[3:15:43] or home then just continue to sew real
[3:15:46] big into the offering so that when camp
[3:15:49] meeting is over there are no extra
[3:15:51] expenses left on us because we have
[3:15:54] other obligations I believe the Lord is
[3:15:57] going to do great things amen so uh be
[3:16:02] as hospitable to visitors as you
[3:16:05] possibly can love them get to know them
[3:16:09] ask them who they are you don't have to
[3:16:12] interview them about Seven Seals and
[3:16:14] things like that but just welcome them
[3:16:17] and tell them how how glad we are to
[3:16:19] have them with us Sunday let's bring a
[3:16:22] real big picnic and let's have lunch
[3:16:25] together on the grounds and fellowship H
[3:16:28] if we have to have a not have to like
[3:16:31] it's a chore if there's a need to have
[3:16:34] another baptism then we can get that
[3:16:36] taken care of as well uh next Sunday
[3:16:39] afternoon but uh pray pray pray
[3:16:42] there will be no service here Tuesday
[3:16:44] night but we will come Wednesday night
[3:16:47] at 7:00 there will be no service the
[3:16:49] following Tuesday night so we are off
[3:16:52] for two Tuesday nights but we are here
[3:16:54] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and
[3:16:56] Sunday does anyone have a
[3:17:00] question wonderful then all hearts and
[3:17:03] minds are clear is that right are you
[3:17:11] clear Zachary you're clear
[3:17:14] mhm want to make
[3:17:18] sure you know what uh God has been so
[3:17:21] good to Elizabeth and
[3:17:25] Zachary and he blessed them with t
[3:17:30] Talia and uh she can be a
[3:17:36] challenge but she has got a
[3:17:39] way that will abs
[3:17:42] absolutely melt your
[3:17:45] heart I think it is
[3:17:48] spiritual but in the natural Papa I
[3:17:51] think it has something to do with those
[3:17:54] curls we have had many people
[3:17:58] including sweetheart wasn't it the Amish
[3:18:00] people too that said something about
[3:18:02] tally one of the brothers said I don't
[3:18:05] know who that little girl was but
[3:18:07] there's something very very special
[3:18:09] about her we're so thankful for her and
[3:18:13] then uh Zach and Liz gave us something
[3:18:16] that we wanted for so long and that was
[3:18:19] a baby boy because we were beginning to
[3:18:23] be very concerned about all the baby
[3:18:25] girls with no baby boys to Mary we were
[3:18:30] getting very concerned about it and God
[3:18:32] gave them uh a pretty special one when
[3:18:36] he gave them Ezekiel
[3:18:39] Joseph that's right isn't it and so we
[3:18:43] went away with them just a few weeks
[3:18:45] after the baby was born and it was the
