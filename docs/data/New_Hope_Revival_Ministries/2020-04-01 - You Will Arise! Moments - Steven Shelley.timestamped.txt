[0:00] you cannot let the enemy's accusation go
[0:03] unanswered shake yourself from the dust
[0:14] arise and sit down or Jerusalem loose
[0:17] yourself from the bonds of your neck o
[0:20] captive daughter of Zion that was his
[0:24] daughter she was the daughter of Zion
[0:27] she was the queen of Zion a princess of
[0:30] the King and yet she called out and
[0:33] there was no man nobody no woman no
[0:36] neighbour to answer her call it was a
[0:40] divine setter God was about to reveal
[0:44] something to her he was about to tell
[0:46] her the expiration on your experience is
[0:51] running out and deliverance is in your
[0:55] mouth and deliverance is in your hand
[0:58] and deliverance will begin when you get
[1:01] up but how many of you know this was an
[1:04] invitation get up above the dust forget
[1:08] where you been forget about how you've
[1:10] been violated you've been abused you've
[1:12] been raped you've been beaten you've
[1:14] been forsaken nobody had compassion on
[1:17] you nobody stopped to help you now
[1:19] you're getting help the voice has come
[1:22] to you the word has come to you you got
[1:25] to see that this is a message from God
[1:27] to you you cannot let the enemy's
[1:31] accusation go unanswered you cannot let
[1:36] the enemy's life go unanswered if you do
[1:40] you'll form a habit and that habit will
[1:43] become a rut and that rut will become a
[1:46] grave and you'll find it very difficult
[1:50] to get out and it doesn't have to be
[1:53] that way and in that process you plunge
[1:56] yourself from the perfect will of God
[2:00] into a prolonged season of his
[2:04] permissive will what he allows instead
[2:07] of what he prefers she didn't need a saw
[2:11] to cut the chain she just need to be
[2:14] obedient to the voice because to her
[2:16] surprise when she got up guess what the
[2:21] band around her neck fell off the chain
[2:26] that held her was broken and she was
[2:31] free but guess what she had been free it
[2:37] was a bit of a bond that was unlocked a
[2:45] chain that was already loose and all she
[2:50] had to do was get up but she couldn't
[2:52] because she allowed that to become her
[2:54] identity you will arise you will arise
[2:59] and you will sit down in a new identity
[3:03] in a new position in a new place from
[3:08] slave to the daughter of Zion from
[3:13] captive daughter to freed daughter
