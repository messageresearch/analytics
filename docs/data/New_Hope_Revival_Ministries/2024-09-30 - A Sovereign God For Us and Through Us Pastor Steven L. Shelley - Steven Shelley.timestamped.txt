[33:32] Lord as we go to prayer today do you
[33:35] have a need by the lifting of the hand
[33:38] all over the house there are
[33:41] needs my hand is up I have needs out
[33:44] across the stream the needs that you
[33:47] have we remember and ask the Lord to
[33:50] minister to those needs believe in the
[33:52] Lord to touch each of your needs I
[33:55] probably won't get all the needs that I
[33:57] am aware of out this morning but could
[34:00] we especially remember the Fisher family
[34:02] today in Greece they are scheduled to
[34:06] leave Greece tonight as a family on a
[34:08] plane to Israel at a very very dangerous
[34:12] time if it doesn't work out at the
[34:15] airport they have to go to the airport
[34:17] and Report they may be told when they're
[34:19] there that the flight is is not
[34:21] available for them then it would be one
[34:24] more week in Greece so we want to lift
[34:27] them up up to the Lord in prayer we've
[34:29] been in touch with them many times over
[34:31] the last few weeks and we know that they
[34:34] are depending on the Lord's leadership
[34:36] and protection it's a it's a fearful
[34:38] thing to think about taking your little
[34:40] babies into a situation that now the
[34:44] Rockets are able to reach anywhere in
[34:47] Israel from the north to the South uh
[34:49] the whole Galilee has been uh just
[34:53] covered in rockets and uh some of these
[34:57] things have have never happened before
[34:59] and so the people are stirred and they
[35:02] need the Lord's protection Lord we heard
[35:04] from uh our good friend Margalit and uh
[35:08] she's hearing the bombs feeling the
[35:10] impact in in her house where she lives
[35:13] near Jerusalem and so we want to pray
[35:15] for everyone in Israel today especially
[35:18] the protection of the Believers we have
[35:21] a very large insurance bill for the
[35:24] church property we pay it every 6 months
[35:26] that's due this week and we don't have
[35:28] anything in the budget for that right
[35:30] now we need the Lord to move he's the
[35:33] provider he can take care of it we're
[35:36] putting it in his hand sister Pam
[35:38] Hendrick excuse me sister Pam Meeks is
[35:42] uh fighting an infection in her jaw and
[35:46] she is looking after the children I
[35:48] can't imagine maybe doing that with an
[35:50] infection in your jaw be quite painful
[35:53] but she's looking after uh I understand
[35:56] Luke and Megan's children while they're
[35:58] away and maybe traveling home today pray
[36:00] for their safety as they come many
[36:03] churches are without power today many
[36:06] services have been cancelled among
[36:08] Believers um and there are people
[36:11] without electricity and there are uh
[36:14] many people without any cell phone
[36:16] coverage there are people that we know
[36:18] of that have never been heard from yet
[36:21] because there's no way to communicate
[36:23] there was a family missing that we were
[36:25] concerned about they were found in aot
[36:27] tell but unable to communicate to tell
[36:30] people we're okay and so we want to
[36:32] continue to pray and ask the Lord to
[36:35] have his way his purpose his will he's a
[36:39] sovereign God Amen the devil didn't send
[36:42] a hurricane right so we're depending on
[36:44] the Lord to take care of his own yes and
[36:47] we believe that he will brother Truman
[36:49] and sister Martha Miller there was a
[36:51] little bit of a hiccup in the in the
[36:54] lender for the buyer and that's to be
[36:57] settled and close on Tuesday so they're
[36:59] going to be a few days late perhaps
[37:01] getting to our area next Saturday hold
[37:03] them up to the Lord in prayer that they
[37:06] will be able to uh have Grace to get
[37:09] through the last few moments of of this
[37:11] transition remember brother Brent who is
[37:14] making a trip back to the west to put
[37:16] things in final order there that God
[37:18] will give him grace and favor and
[37:20] traveling mercies when he returns with
[37:23] all of their belongings I believe Kate's
[37:26] parents are coming for a visit pray for
[37:28] their safety and that the Lord would
[37:30] would uh bless them and give them a good
[37:32] time while they're here there are just
[37:34] so many needs but God is big and he's
[37:38] got them all amen amen let's take them
[37:42] to the Lord touching Jesus is all that
[37:44] really matters let's take these needs to
[37:47] the Lord he's the one that's well able
[37:49] to do something about them oh thank you
[37:53] Jesus touching Jesus
[37:58] is
[37:59] all that really

[51:21] Richmond Virginia the big one and he he
[51:25] he got on that organ and he started
[51:28] singing that at a youth meeting over in
[51:30] Richmond and I tell you I've enjoyed
[51:34] that song ever since sister
[51:36] Flo because there's something about
[51:41] knowing there's a lot of things I don't
[51:43] know that's there's a lot of things I
[51:47] want to

[51:57] soul and he filled me with the Holy
[51:59] Ghost and he set me on a right path that
[52:03] I've not wanted to turn back there's a
[52:06] lot of things I've wanted to quit but I
[52:08] didn't want to quit on him because he's
[52:11] never quit on me he has he has he has uh
[52:14] he has pushed me on he has drugged Me on
[52:18] he has put his foot in my back side to
[52:21] help me to go on he's done everything
[52:24] necessary to keep me moving forward
[52:26] forward because he knows that I live in
[52:29] lukewarm Le oysa and he doesn't want me
[52:32] to take on the spirit of leod deia and
[52:36] I'm glad for the grace of God because we
[52:39] could all become lukewarm and stagnant
[52:42] we have it periods in our life but by

[1:11:24] that and then Saturday one of the yich
[1:11:27] children has a birthday Caleb John I
[1:11:31] call him John Caleb but his name is
[1:11:34] Caleb John our camp meeting is October
[1:11:37] the 15 through the 20th and the the
[1:11:40] theme is that he might have preeminence
[1:11:42] in all things the Lord woke me up that
[1:11:45] morning and spoke to me about all the
[1:11:48] things that take preeminence in our
[1:11:50] lives and it has to be Jesus and in
[1:11:53] streaming services sometimes I love to
[1:11:55] do that I love to hear what God is
[1:11:58] saying in other places and doing in
[1:12:00] other places and I hear people uh many
[1:12:04] times giving preeminence to first one
[1:12:07] thing and then another sometimes it's
[1:12:10] brother brandom who receives the the
[1:12:12] highest preeminence of a service that's
[1:12:15] not pleasing to God that wouldn't please
[1:12:17] brother brandom he were alive today
[1:12:21] sometimes it's all about the
[1:12:23] cloud that wouldn't please the Lord Lord
[1:12:25] doesn't wouldn't please brother brandom
[1:12:27] it's all right to mention these things
[1:12:29] and to make a to-do about them they're
[1:12:31] worthy of of a to-do but in all
[1:12:35] things in all things he has to
[1:12:39] be glorified and have preeminence I'm
[1:12:42] waiting for somebody to say amen and
[1:12:45] that's why when you come in here you're
[1:12:46] not you're not staring at a picture of
[1:12:49] of a of of a cloud or of a brother
[1:12:52] brandom with the angel of the Lord over
[1:12:54] his head or these things are wonderful
[1:12:57] things that we celebrate and give God
[1:13:00] thanks for but when you're in here the
[1:13:02] word which is Jesus in the beginning was
[1:13:07] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:13:10] the Word was God I I read a 50-page
[1:13:14] article on why that doesn't mean that
[1:13:16] Jesus was
[1:13:19] God 50-page article how could Jesus be
[1:13:22] God and and and uh I he said okay of
[1:13:26] course people bring in in the beginning
[1:13:28] was a word the word was with God and the
[1:13:30] Word was God but that doesn't mean that
[1:13:31] the son was God and I said to myself
[1:13:34] you're a scholar but a but a pretty
[1:13:36] stupid
[1:13:38] one because you forgot that there's some
[1:13:41] more verses in John chapter
[1:13:43] 1 if you'll just drop down a little
[1:13:46] further in John 1 it says and the word
[1:13:49] became
[1:13:52] flesh and dwelt among usen and I'm going
[1:13:55] to paraphrase by saying and in him we
[1:13:58] beheld but but in King James it says we
[1:14:01] beheld the glory of the only begotten of
[1:14:03] the father full of grace and truth so
[1:14:06] aren't you glad you know that Jesus is
[1:14:08] the word he was the word made flesh
[1:14:11] where is the word being made flesh in
[1:14:14] this hour it's being made flesh in the
[1:14:17] body of Christ which is his bride the
[1:14:20] word is becoming flesh again in a body a
[1:14:24] multi remembered body all over the world
[1:14:27] we give God praise I want to say that
[1:14:31] brother gy is a is a faithful servant of
[1:14:34] the Lord and of this body and uh I I
[1:14:37] only heard one of the services and I'm
[1:14:39] very thankful for the quality of
[1:14:42] preaching that we have we're grateful
[1:14:44] we're thankful for it I want to say to
[1:14:47] Ben how how wonderfully blessed I was by
[1:14:50] the worship and uh it came across the
[1:14:53] Stream very well and I want to say to
[1:14:57] those of you who have anything to do
[1:14:59] with the sound that at least in one of
[1:15:02] the three services that I streamed the
[1:15:04] balance of the of the voice and the
[1:15:07] music was beautiful it was really really
[1:15:11] well balanced no one no one instrument
[1:15:15] taking uh any more volume than the other
[1:15:17] it just sounded like it's supposed to
[1:15:19] sound in the spirit it's supposed to be
[1:15:22] everyone blending together and it was it
[1:15:25] was very nice the drums were not too
[1:15:27] loud organ not too loud everything just
[1:15:30] sounded so good and I want to say to
[1:15:32] Joseph where is Joseph there he is I
[1:15:35] want to tell you that uh there was an
[1:15:37] anointing that fell on you in the
[1:15:39] worship service it might have been might
[1:15:41] have been Tuesday night I didn't get the
[1:15:44] preaching Tuesday night but uh but I got
[1:15:46] the the worship and there was a song
[1:15:49] that Ben was singing it was either
[1:15:51] Sunday or Tuesday night one of those
[1:15:53] songs that has a little bit of Warfare
[1:15:55] sound to it I don't remember do you
[1:15:57] remember what it might have been and uh
[1:16:00] I saw the anointing I could sense it
[1:16:02] feel it and see it as it fell on Joseph
[1:16:05] and he began to to play in rhythm with
[1:16:09] the spirit just right on you know it's
[1:16:12] one thing to be in rhythm with the music
[1:16:14] that's good that's a good place to be
[1:16:17] but you can be you can be accurate in
[1:16:20] the music and not
[1:16:23] anointed and that's what brother Brandon
[1:16:25] was talking about when he mentioned
[1:16:27] those train choirs it wasn't that you
[1:16:29] shouldn't
[1:16:30] practice you should you should exercise
[1:16:33] the gift that God has given you and and
[1:16:36] you should work it toward Perfection
[1:16:38] because you're giving it to the King of
[1:16:40] Kings and the Lord of lords but he said
[1:16:42] don't think that by training these
[1:16:45] voices and all this kind of stuff that
[1:16:47] it that it uh brings the anointing the
[1:16:49] anointing is only there when the
[1:16:51] sincerity of faith is present then that
[1:16:54] anointing and falls and and young man it
[1:16:57] fell on you and I was blessed very very
[1:17:00] blessed we're blessed to have these
[1:17:01] musicians let's thank God for every one
[1:17:04] of
[1:17:10] them so wonderful to see sister Alfreda
[1:17:13] home and well and looking well and
[1:17:16] recovering from her uh long trip and uh
[1:17:20] maybe you don't think about the fact
[1:17:22] that she is upwards of 80 you know she's
[1:17:24] on the other side side of 80 and
[1:17:26] traveled
[1:17:27] alone and uh had a crazy schedule the
[1:17:30] intinerary was stressful and straining
[1:17:34] and she was already not feeling well but
[1:17:36] the grace of God brought her to us
[1:17:39] safely and she looks good this morning I
[1:17:41] know that she probably still needs a
[1:17:43] touch from the Lord and we've got an air
[1:17:45] conditioner in the back that needs a
[1:17:47] touch from the Lord Brother David it
[1:17:48] needs God's touch and
[1:17:51] yours it'll be all right with those two
[1:17:53] on the job I promise you that God is
[1:17:56] just good he's good he gave us some
[1:17:59] Divine appointments just take a few more
[1:18:01] moments of your time before we preach he
[1:18:04] gave us some Divine appointments along
[1:18:06] the way he sent us down to we we uh
[1:18:09] usually stay away from Panama City it's
[1:18:11] not a place I enjoy being but there was
[1:18:13] something I wanted to get down that way
[1:18:16] and uh I've been using the same towels
[1:18:19] for about 12 years and there's a store
[1:18:22] down there that uh my wife has changed
[1:18:25] towels for the main bathroom multiple
[1:18:27] times but I just like my towel and I've
[1:18:30] been but you know after 12
[1:18:32] years my wife said we need to throw
[1:18:35] those away and get no no no no no I've
[1:18:38] gotten to that age in life where I know
[1:18:40] what I like and I I like what I like and
[1:18:42] I don't like what I don't like so I'll
[1:18:45] just use this one until I can get but I
[1:18:46] found out they had a store down there
[1:18:48] that that has these towels so we went
[1:18:50] down and things were already closing up
[1:18:53] because of the storm we we went in a
[1:18:56] place for lunch and uh an
[1:18:58] africanamerican woman was our uh Hostess
[1:19:01] and she said my daughter is going to be
[1:19:03] your waitress and she was one of the
[1:19:05] most attentive waitresses we have had
[1:19:08] and just very very nice to take care of
[1:19:11] you and and uh of course I wanted to
[1:19:13] Tipp her accordingly because we're told
[1:19:16] to do
[1:19:17] that and you you can sit there and have
[1:19:20] this attitude well the boss ought to pay
[1:19:22] them well you can that may make you feel
[1:19:24] better better but that doesn't put any
[1:19:26] anything in their pocket does it and
[1:19:29] some of them have this agreement where
[1:19:31] they work on part of their tips and it's
[1:19:33] a serious thing so I wanted to take good
[1:19:35] care of her but I discerned that her
[1:19:37] need was a lot bigger than my tip and so
[1:19:41] I began to talk to her and she began to
[1:19:43] talk about her anxiety and that she was
[1:19:45] very concerned about the storm because
[1:19:47] she had been there the last hurricane
[1:19:49] that blew into Panama City and she said
[1:19:51] when you're looking out the window and
[1:19:53] you see trees going by your house house
[1:19:55] she said I have PTSD from it and she
[1:19:57] said I've been a wreck today and I just
[1:19:59] began to talk to her I said you know if
[1:20:02] you change your thoughts you can change
[1:20:03] your
[1:20:05] life and I just began to tell her what
[1:20:07] what the Lord was putting on my heart I
[1:20:09] tell you she said God sent you I I think
[1:20:11] God sent you to me today to speak to me
[1:20:15] she said I have so much more peace than
[1:20:17] I had when I came in here today and and
[1:20:20] I trust that God was with that little
[1:20:22] lady and then right after that or or
[1:20:25] just before that a man was helping us
[1:20:28] there on the beach I found out I needed
[1:20:30] a different chair than the one I took
[1:20:32] and we rented a chair and an umbrella
[1:20:35] and it was an older man quite older man
[1:20:39] who brought it and he was physically fit
[1:20:42] and in great shape and he began to talk
[1:20:44] to us and the Lord began to talk to me
[1:20:48] as he was talking to us and he went away
[1:20:51] and the family went to do their thing
[1:20:53] and and he came came back to me and I
[1:20:55] began to talk to him I said I H you you
[1:20:58] you you're perhaps you're
[1:21:00] Jewish and he began to tell me yes he
[1:21:03] was come to find out he was a Believer
[1:21:05] he believed that Jesus was the
[1:21:08] Messiah and he kept coming back to us
[1:21:12] and uh he finally said you know there's
[1:21:14] something about your family that keeps
[1:21:16] drawing me he said I I just wanted to
[1:21:18] say hello to you speak to you every day
[1:21:20] something and God sees that when when we
[1:21:24] went to leave he said uh Steve he said I
[1:21:27] I want you to send some links to some
[1:21:29] podcast or something I I I want to hear
[1:21:32] uh what you have to say may may God do
[1:21:35] something
[1:21:36] greater in their life it's not all about
[1:21:40] fun is it it's it's also about being uh
[1:21:43] gently led by the Holy Spirit brother
[1:21:46] fiser was preaching he while I was while
[1:21:50] he was here brother Scott Smith reached
[1:21:52] out to me and asked me for brother
[1:21:55] Fischer's contact information and uh I
[1:21:59] was wanted to make sure that was okay
[1:22:01] with brother fiser because he was trying
[1:22:03] to keep a very low profile but just
[1:22:06] before they flew to Greece he was able
[1:22:08] to go there on a Wednesday night and
[1:22:10] Minister and Sister Evelyn sent me the
[1:22:13] the service and I was unable to watch it
[1:22:15] until or to listen to it rather until
[1:22:18] yesterday as we were driving home but I
[1:22:20] was so blessed by the ministry that God
[1:22:23] gave him in that church he was in an
[1:22:25] entirely different mode than when he was
[1:22:27] here but it was so so powerful and so
[1:22:31] wonderful for for the people very plain
[1:22:34] you know very plain spoken giving his
[1:22:36] testimony so let's continue to pray for
[1:22:40] him that God will give them his perfect
[1:22:43] leadership if God desires for them to be
[1:22:46] back in
[1:22:47] Israel uh as of this evening then
[1:22:50] there's not a bomb
[1:22:52] anywhere that can hinder the purposes of
[1:22:55] God's plans do you believe that I hope
[1:22:58] you do because this is not going to be a
[1:23:00] popular message this morning but it will
[1:23:02] be the word of the Lord for us let's
[1:23:04] stand together and uh give give our
[1:23:08] attention to the Holy Spirit he's here I
[1:23:13] want to say that again he's
[1:23:16] here Genesis 1:1 you know I I think that
[1:23:21] if you have been gone three Sundays and
[1:23:23] you come back I think you ought to make
[1:23:26] up for all the time that's lost
[1:23:31] amen so today is the day I hope you had
[1:23:36] breakfast no I don't have any intention
[1:23:39] of being any extra long we'll be out by
[1:23:41] 3 I'm sure unless God does something
[1:23:45] different but I want you to know that I
[1:23:47] need you in this I I don't want you to
[1:23:50] aim in what you don't believe but if you
[1:23:53] hear something you believe I want you to
[1:23:55] amen it's not just to make the preacher
[1:23:57] feel good it's not my words anyway it's
[1:24:00] his but it is because it's vitally
[1:24:04] important scripturally that we come into
[1:24:06] alignment with the word and when we hear
[1:24:09] a truth and we say Amen to a truth the
[1:24:12] very meaning of the word amen is so be
[1:24:14] it and it's not just so be it out there
[1:24:19] it's help me now it so be it in here it
[1:24:24] is there anybody that wants the word of
[1:24:26] God to come to pass in
[1:24:29] them and I I'm one of those I I have to
[1:24:33] have him I want to have him working in
[1:24:37] my life that's why we were born that's
[1:24:39] our why that's the reason why we're here
[1:24:42] it's our purpose if you think you were
[1:24:45] born to be cool you're wrong you were
[1:24:47] born to serve the King of Kings and the
[1:24:49] Lord of lords if you think you were born
[1:24:52] to be good-looking you miss the boat
[1:24:55] you were born to serve
[1:24:57] God although some of us are a little
[1:25:00] better looking today than we used to be
[1:25:02] Jason but anyway moving right along
[1:25:04] great Improvement we want God to have
[1:25:08] his way and we want him to speak to our
[1:25:10] heart Romans chapter 8 uh it will be
[1:25:13] after Genesis 1:1 so if you're going to
[1:25:16] catch up you might as well start in the
[1:25:18] beginning you can't get too much farther
[1:25:21] in the scripture back than Genesis 1:1
[1:25:24] in in the beginning
[1:25:26] God I just want to say it that way in
[1:25:29] the beginning God that's it he
[1:25:34] created the
[1:25:37] Heaven and the Earth right that's all
[1:25:40] the atmosphere above the Earth and the
[1:25:43] Earth he created it all if he created
[1:25:47] heaven then Heaven is his if he created
[1:25:50] the earth the earth is his if he created
[1:25:53] you
[1:25:55] you're his you belong to him so in the
[1:25:58] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:26:00] Earth one more before you you're seated
[1:26:03] Romans 8 verse 28 and 29 you know this
[1:26:08] you know these verses very well and we
[1:26:11] know it's it's not that we speculate or
[1:26:14] we guess or we
[1:26:16] hope we know
[1:26:19] that all means all that's all
[1:26:25] we know that all things work
[1:26:29] together for
[1:26:31] good to them that love God to them who
[1:26:37] are the called according to purpose his
[1:26:43] purpose I would have made that a capital
[1:26:46] H if I would have been writing it his
[1:26:51] purpose not creation's purpose the
[1:26:54] Creator's purpose let me read that again
[1:26:58] and we know that all things work
[1:27:01] together for good to them that love God
[1:27:05] to them who
[1:27:06] are the called according to his purpose
[1:27:10] for whom he did for know that means he
[1:27:15] knew you
[1:27:18] before he knew you before you were born
[1:27:22] he knew you before you were created he
[1:27:26] already knew your
[1:27:28] strengths I know you're standing he
[1:27:31] already knew your
[1:27:33] weaknesses he knew you for whom he did
[1:27:36] Forno he also
[1:27:39] did give a prefixed Destiny to
[1:27:43] predestinate to
[1:27:46] be
[1:27:48] conformed you're going to be conformed
[1:27:55] if he saw you as his before you ever got
[1:27:59] here you are going to be conformed to
[1:28:03] the image of his son you're going to be
[1:28:08] conformed I am going to be conformed to
[1:28:12] the image of his son I am it's a promise
[1:28:17] that he might be the
[1:28:20] firstborn among many brethren yes Jesus
[1:28:25] was the firstborn among many other Sons
[1:28:31] God had many more Sons than
[1:28:34] one amen one of them created one of them
[1:28:37] begotten and others born spiritually as
[1:28:40] Sons how many of you are Sons born by
[1:28:44] the spirit today somebody said I'm a
[1:28:47] woman I can't be a son of course you can
[1:28:50] I'm a man and I'm part of the bride of
[1:28:52] Christ so this is not a gendered thing
[1:28:56] this is a a predestinated thing it's
[1:28:58] about
[1:28:59] election father come now and bring
[1:29:03] Clarity to your word may may my part in
[1:29:08] this not be
[1:29:10] misunderstood may you have preeminence
[1:29:13] in what is spoken today and we will give
[1:29:16] you the glory and the honor and the
[1:29:17] praise for it's in the name above every
[1:29:19] name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:22] we pray and the Saint said amen you may
[1:29:26] be seated it's
[1:29:27] 12:25 and we're beginning the the word
[1:29:30] now
[1:29:32] sovereignty means to
[1:29:35] exercise Supreme and independent
[1:29:40] Authority we have a God who is
[1:29:42] independent of any other Force there's
[1:29:46] nothing he he doesn't have to confer
[1:29:49] with anyone or anything he doesn't have
[1:29:52] to ask anybody's permission to be God
[1:29:55] he's God and God alone let the Saints
[1:29:58] say Amen he's God and God Alone he once
[1:30:02] existed alone with his thoughts there
[1:30:06] was nothing to worship Him the prophet
[1:30:10] tells us that was a time when when
[1:30:13] really he was he was pre God he was
[1:30:16] before God meaning only there was no one
[1:30:20] to worship him so he began to create
[1:30:25] that which would worship him that which
[1:30:28] would glorify him and L him as God but
[1:30:33] he was in essence always God waiting on
[1:30:38] an opportunity a time a moment in the
[1:30:41] fullness of his time from eternity he
[1:30:45] would create first angels and Heavenly
[1:30:50] hosts that would glorify him and praise
[1:30:53] him and worship him and eventually Adam
[1:30:57] who was made both male and female in the
[1:31:00] beginning and God reached in and pulled
[1:31:03] the feminis or the female part out of
[1:31:06] Adam and made for Adam a bride
[1:31:09] Hallelujah and so uh when all the
[1:31:12] animals came before Adam to be named
[1:31:15] they all came with a
[1:31:17] mate every male animal had a female
[1:31:20] animal and this is what caused Adam to
[1:31:23] begin to Long WR in his mind he saw that
[1:31:26] there's something going on out here in
[1:31:28] creation Everybody's Got Somebody But Me
[1:31:32] and there was a longing that was formed
[1:31:34] in him I'd like to have a counterpart it
[1:31:38] wasn't that he didn't appreciate the
[1:31:39] fellowship that he had with God he
[1:31:42] certainly appreciated that but he longed
[1:31:44] for some fellowship of a different kind
[1:31:47] the ability to be able to share one's
[1:31:49] heart and to hear somebody else's heart
[1:31:53] he was cre created to have that to long
[1:31:55] for that and the answer was not found
[1:31:58] among all the other
[1:32:00] creatures in fact when it became time
[1:32:03] for Adam to have that counterpart guess
[1:32:06] where she was found she was found in him
[1:32:10] and he reached inside and pulled her out
[1:32:14] even spiritually you and I were created
[1:32:17] in
[1:32:18] Christ when he was created somebody said
[1:32:21] you mean Christ was created the Bible
[1:32:23] said he was the beginning of the
[1:32:25] creation of God he was God but in
[1:32:29] physical form he was a creation of God
[1:32:33] there is no Eternal sunship there is
[1:32:35] sunship but not Eternal sunship there
[1:32:39] had to be a moment of stepping down of
[1:32:42] condescending to come in the role as a
[1:32:45] son but don't
[1:32:46] misunderstand there are not two
[1:32:50] Gods we are not tuness
[1:32:54] there's one and he is as much God as the
[1:32:57] father was everything that was in
[1:33:00] Jehovah he poured into Jesus Yeshua the
[1:33:03] son and everything that was in the sun
[1:33:06] has been poured out upon the church the
[1:33:09] bride Church in these last days somebody
[1:33:13] ought to say amen and God is Sovereign
[1:33:16] he doesn't need nobody else sister Flo
[1:33:19] sings that sometime he don't need nobody
[1:33:22] else if he says it he means it if he
[1:33:25] says it and means it he's he alone can
[1:33:28] bring that word to pass now your faith
[1:33:31] determines whether or not the word is
[1:33:33] activated in your individual life but
[1:33:36] that little amen that you put on there
[1:33:39] or or lack of Amen that doesn't change
[1:33:41] the word the word is the same whether
[1:33:44] you say Amen or not but when you say
[1:33:47] Amen you make the word Universal the
[1:33:51] word corporate become personalized word
[1:33:56] you say Amen your faith makes that
[1:33:58] promise become
[1:34:00] individualized for you are you
[1:34:03] here I'm missing some
[1:34:06] amens I'm thankful that I serve a God
[1:34:09] who doesn't have to ask the
[1:34:12] president you doesn't have to confer
[1:34:14] with the Prime Minister somewhere if he
[1:34:17] wants to do
[1:34:18] something he can just do
[1:34:21] it so sovereignty means to exercise
[1:34:24] Supreme and independent Authority we're
[1:34:27] talking today about a sovereign God for
[1:34:31] us and through us and this is a word
[1:34:36] from the Lord for this
[1:34:38] season knowing God's purposes in all
[1:34:42] things gives great
[1:34:44] peace if you can know that he's in
[1:34:47] charge it changes your post
[1:34:51] right it changes your presence on social
[1:34:56] media you're not posting in a
[1:35:00] panic you're posting in
[1:35:03] faith you're in God's hands I actually
[1:35:07] got plain enough to say to that little
[1:35:09] waitress here is the
[1:35:11] reality if we were in a storm
[1:35:15] shelter and and and everything was okay
[1:35:18] it looked okay if if God was ready for
[1:35:21] one of us come on he would come into
[1:35:24] that shelter and get
[1:35:27] us you know it's it's not about where
[1:35:30] you are it's about who you are and when
[1:35:33] it's time for you to come home I said
[1:35:35] when God's ready for you and I to go
[1:35:37] home we're going
[1:35:39] home whether we are in the best hospital
[1:35:42] or the worst
[1:35:43] hospital we can't blame the doctor when
[1:35:46] God's Sovereign I hope you don't think
[1:35:48] your doctor is
[1:35:51] Sovereign I hope you don't think he get
[1:35:53] gets the last word how many of you know
[1:35:56] God gets the last word this is 101 for
[1:35:59] you folks this is not deep for you this
[1:36:02] is not some new revelation for you but
[1:36:05] God for some reason wanted to remind us
[1:36:09] that he is
[1:36:11] Sovereign and when we pray through
[1:36:14] tragedies like what's going on in Israel
[1:36:17] and when we pray about tragedies like
[1:36:20] what's going on with with the hurricane
[1:36:22] and all of the aftermath we need to
[1:36:25] remember in all of our praying that God
[1:36:28] is
[1:36:30] Sovereign you don't want to give the
[1:36:32] devil any
[1:36:34] praise for what God
[1:36:37] did it's an act of God it wasn't the
[1:36:41] devil doing it
[1:36:45] oh I better get some water
[1:36:47] here I knew it'd be a little tough this
[1:36:50] morning because you all have been you're
[1:36:53] being overwhelmed with the with the with
[1:36:55] the sadness of the moment it's horrible
[1:36:57] it's
[1:37:00] terrible roads washed away Bridges gone
[1:37:04] interstates
[1:37:05] missing whole towns
[1:37:09] underwater grocery stores gone
[1:37:12] McDonald's gone how will people
[1:37:16] live loss of life the most precious
[1:37:21] thing of all more precious precious than
[1:37:24] the than the hospital more precious than
[1:37:27] fast food place more precious than the
[1:37:30] family home or the lives that were lost
[1:37:35] God Comfort the family and minister to
[1:37:39] them but David when faced with such a
[1:37:43] tragedy as a loss of his son's life he
[1:37:47] fasted believing that God was able to
[1:37:50] restore him back to health and to give
[1:37:54] him longevity but when God decided to
[1:37:57] take
[1:37:58] him he didn't blame the
[1:38:03] devil he didn't get on Facebook and post
[1:38:06] about how the church is at fault because
[1:38:09] they weren't
[1:38:11] praying and the devil got in there and
[1:38:14] killed his son oh no he got up and
[1:38:17] washed his face and put on some clean
[1:38:20] grovee and said I'm going to have my
[1:38:22] supper now
[1:38:24] now because the lord
[1:38:30] giveth and the lord taketh away blessed
[1:38:35] be the name of the Lord is it always
[1:38:39] easy to do that never
[1:38:42] easy when you are the one personally
[1:38:46] facing the loss the grief the
[1:38:52] shock somebody said well at least it was
[1:38:55] a long illness that doesn't fix
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:00] it they say Well it gives you more time
[1:39:03] to say goodbye nobody wants to say
[1:39:07] goodbye I don't know which is worse I
[1:39:11] don't think we should evaluate it like
[1:39:14] that death is is awful for us at any
[1:39:19] time when on a personal level but on a
[1:39:23] spiritual level when a child of God goes
[1:39:26] home no matter how how we love them and
[1:39:29] care for them when a child of God goes
[1:39:32] home the Bible is true and it says to be
[1:39:36] absent from the
[1:39:38] body is to
[1:39:42] be oh folks Oh Sister Cindy oh everybody
[1:39:47] that can
[1:39:48] hear we miss their
[1:39:51] presence but this is not the same kind
[1:39:55] of presence that we enjoy on a Sunday
[1:39:57] morning when the when the Ethereal
[1:40:00] Spirit of the Lord comes in and begins
[1:40:02] to blow on us and move on it's oh that's
[1:40:05] powerful but we're not just talking
[1:40:08] about something that runs ahead of him
[1:40:11] his Spirit presence running ahead of him
[1:40:13] we're talking about something even more
[1:40:16] real can it get any more real than that
[1:40:18] it can because what we have experienced
[1:40:21] through the baptism of the Holy Holy
[1:40:23] Ghost is only the
[1:40:25] earnest of what it really means to be
[1:40:29] occupied by the Holy
[1:40:31] Ghost it's it's not just having the
[1:40:34] spirit on your flesh or on your mind
[1:40:37] will and emotion but it's also having
[1:40:40] him on the on the control tower of your
[1:40:43] life it's that Holy Ghost coming from
[1:40:46] from the inside out instead of the
[1:40:48] outside in the anointing moves from
[1:40:51] outside in but the Holy Ghost experience
[1:40:54] moves from the inside out it's a
[1:40:57] different Administration but by The Same
[1:41:00] Spirit we're thankful for that but our
[1:41:03] loved ones when they leave us they don't
[1:41:05] just feel as you know they don't just oh
[1:41:08] this is like feeling good you know they
[1:41:11] step into
[1:41:13] eternity oh where everything is more
[1:41:17] real it's it's more real it's more Vivid
[1:41:20] it's it it smells better it looks better
[1:41:25] everything is better when we get into
[1:41:27] that
[1:41:28] place and when we re really begin to
[1:41:31] recognize that we long for that and when
[1:41:35] lives are lost in tragedies like this we
[1:41:39] grieve when hostages were just a few
[1:41:43] moments away from being
[1:41:45] rescued and out of the hatred and
[1:41:48] wickedness of of uh of of of serpent
[1:41:52] seed
[1:41:55] yes I don't see how a seat of God could
[1:41:59] possibly take someone's life under those
[1:42:03] circumstances most likely
[1:42:07] reprobates would take those hostages
[1:42:10] lives they're in God's hands not mine I
[1:42:12] can't be their judge I can just tell you
[1:42:15] the the likelihood of the situation but
[1:42:18] took their
[1:42:19] lives uh one of the most uh physical
[1:42:24] visible of the
[1:42:25] hostages uh hsh his family his mom his
[1:42:30] dad and the media every day at the
[1:42:33] Republican convention at the Democratic
[1:42:36] Convention they didn't care about
[1:42:40] politics they cared about the life of
[1:42:44] their son and within moments of his
[1:42:49] freedom so close to being free
[1:42:54] that
[1:42:56] the the
[1:42:58] detection the instruments for sound
[1:43:01] detection in the
[1:43:03] tunnels uh monitored by the
[1:43:07] IDF registered the
[1:43:11] shots and someone recognized that there
[1:43:15] was shooting going on in the
[1:43:18] tunnels just moments before I watched
[1:43:21] the funeral
[1:43:23] I saw the pain in a mother and a father
[1:43:27] even the president of Israel you could
[1:43:29] see his pain as he spoke to the people
[1:43:33] and we don't understand things and it
[1:43:35] hurts us we wept my wife and I wept
[1:43:39] because we had prayed for his freedom
[1:43:41] but we have to
[1:43:44] believe that God saw
[1:43:47] that we have to believe that there were
[1:43:50] Souls under the altar crying out oh Lord
[1:43:54] how
[1:43:55] long we have to believe that that he
[1:43:59] died with a testimony of of of be of
[1:44:02] being
[1:44:04] Redeemed by by acknowledging the god of
[1:44:07] Israel though he didn't know the blood
[1:44:09] of Jesus he he we we look to what the
[1:44:13] scripture said all Israel shall be saved
[1:44:16] we have to draw comfort in what the
[1:44:18] Bible said hoping and believing as his
[1:44:21] family does that they will see him again
[1:44:23] regardless of whether or not there's a
[1:44:25] body to bury on Mount Zion death death
[1:44:29] is
[1:44:29] hard and I don't want to I don't want to
[1:44:32] in any way this morning minimalize the
[1:44:35] pain that people are going through
[1:44:37] because of this hurricane I only want to
[1:44:40] tell you my experience and as I told my
[1:44:42] son this morning I'm going to or or
[1:44:45] several of them I think it's not going
[1:44:47] to be popular this this will get some
[1:44:51] hits but I I can't help it I've got to
[1:44:54] tell you what what the Lord
[1:44:56] said and then you go sort it out for
[1:45:00] yourself I can tell you this God doesn't
[1:45:03] Delight in suffering he doesn't get joy
[1:45:06] out of pain he doesn't sit there like
[1:45:10] some crazed lunatic you
[1:45:14] know I got you I zapped you look what I
[1:45:17] can do you may have found that kind of a
[1:45:20] villain in your Disney life
[1:45:24] but our God is not like that he doesn't
[1:45:28] find theight in anyone's suffering
[1:45:30] although he allows all things
[1:45:35] yeses for his
[1:45:39] purpose all things listen All Things
[1:45:42] serve God in order to manifest his
[1:45:47] sons the goal in this life is that there
[1:45:51] will be Sons manifested in the end of
[1:45:55] this and yes there are pain there's pain
[1:45:59] and there's loss and there's suffering
[1:46:01] and there are innocent people caught up
[1:46:03] in the swell of some of these things but
[1:46:06] the ultimate goal of our creator is to
[1:46:09] manifest sons in the end time the Bible
[1:46:13] tells us watch this even sin evil and
[1:46:18] the fall will serve God's purposes till
[1:46:22] the the
[1:46:24] end he made a woman such that she would
[1:46:28] hear and
[1:46:30] yield being taken from the man as a
[1:46:34] byproduct but don't think of that as
[1:46:37] some V Vienna sausage or something we're
[1:46:41] not talking about a woman being
[1:46:43] spam you know a bunch of body parts all
[1:46:46] mixed in and to make some kind of Vienna
[1:46:48] sausage or something no no no that's not
[1:46:51] the kind of byproduct she is
[1:46:54] this was the word that brother brandom
[1:46:55] used in lack of being able in his time
[1:46:57] to find a better word it's simply saying
[1:47:00] that that Adam was the original creation
[1:47:04] the woman was not the original creation
[1:47:06] but listen she
[1:47:08] was to a certain extent because she was
[1:47:12] in
[1:47:13] Adam so when God made Adam didn't he
[1:47:17] also put something in Adam that would be
[1:47:21] the woman yeah it wasn't the bone by the
[1:47:24] way it it it was that nature that
[1:47:28] motherly feminine nature that Adam had
[1:47:31] he he named them
[1:47:33] both he named them both
[1:47:36] Adam he drew them from the earth then he
[1:47:40] reached in and took that woman and
[1:47:42] because her not being the original
[1:47:46] formed but formed from the
[1:47:48] original it it caused her to have a
[1:47:51] disposition of being a little more uh a
[1:47:55] little more you know gullible a little
[1:47:57] more innocent I want to say this
[1:48:00] carefully I'm not ashamed to say it I
[1:48:02] just want to say it with respect to
[1:48:04] sisters because I thank God I'm not
[1:48:06] pastoring a church full of
[1:48:08] eaves I'm pastoring a church full of
[1:48:12] Marys who said be it unto me according
[1:48:14] to Thy word I don't think that I should
[1:48:17] look at you like an eve when you've been
[1:48:19] redeemed I should see you in the spirit
[1:48:21] as a Mary who said let God's Will and
[1:48:24] word be done in me Eve said let me
[1:48:27] figure this out for myself I'd kind of
[1:48:30] like to be like
[1:48:31] God she didn't recognize she didn't have
[1:48:34] the same Revelation she didn't recognize
[1:48:37] that she was already like
[1:48:40] God and if she could have rode the tide
[1:48:43] she would have been more like him than
[1:48:45] ever so the very thing she desired she
[1:48:48] already possessed doesn't that sound
[1:48:50] like the American Spirit
[1:48:53] that's right the thing that she desired
[1:48:55] she already had she just didn't
[1:48:57] understand it yet right and so because
[1:49:00] of that because of that predisposition
[1:49:04] that she came with it was easier for her
[1:49:06] to accept the Bible said she was the one
[1:49:08] in the deception Adam was not deceived
[1:49:11] he did what he did to cover her even as
[1:49:14] Christ who knew no sin became our sin
[1:49:17] yes that's right I know this already
[1:49:21] Pastor do you know it
[1:49:23] I want you to remember it when things
[1:49:25] get tough when the power goes out when
[1:49:28] the highway is not there anymore when
[1:49:30] the house is gone when the children you
[1:49:33] don't know where they are you're hoping
[1:49:35] someone has has uh taken them in when
[1:49:39] your brand new truck like a friend of
[1:49:41] ours your brand new truck floats out of
[1:49:43] the hospital parking lot where you
[1:49:48] work and you're posting if anybody sees
[1:49:51] my truck can you imagine
[1:49:53] anybody sees my truck let me
[1:49:57] know I hope the payment people will
[1:50:03] understand this is terrible I'm crooked
[1:50:06] why didn't somebody tell me not oh no no
[1:50:10] nobody here did did
[1:50:13] they H oh he
[1:50:19] did we never know when the blur is
[1:50:22] coming from so I got to get it better a
[1:50:24] little
[1:50:25] better it's important to
[1:50:30] breathe when these kinds of things
[1:50:32] happen it's easy to say look what the
[1:50:35] devil did the devil hindered the devil
[1:50:39] got in
[1:50:40] this but the lord gave me some some
[1:50:43] pretty specific I I'll get ahead of
[1:50:46] myself to to share it now but he gave me
[1:50:50] some specific thoughts
[1:50:53] and and I I just will will share a
[1:50:55] portion of them with
[1:50:58] you and and uh one of the most important
[1:51:02] things was he dealt with me that if
[1:51:06] anyone in my
[1:51:08] presence should attribute the storm as
[1:51:11] the work of the devil that I should
[1:51:13] speak
[1:51:14] up and tell them no no this one is all
[1:51:17] mine the Lord said this one is all
[1:51:24] M could that not almost be said about
[1:51:27] every but but he said specifically to my
[1:51:30] heart this one is all mine when when God
[1:51:35] takes
[1:51:37] responsibility come on it means that his
[1:51:41] will and his purpose is going to be
[1:51:45] accomplished in the end in the end men
[1:51:49] and women are going to see that it's not
[1:51:51] the loss of the new truck or even the
[1:51:54] the half of the
[1:51:56] house that really matters what matters
[1:51:59] is knowing your creator with a personal
[1:52:03] intimate relationship having a real
[1:52:07] genuine Walk With Jesus
[1:52:12] Christ he gets us through the loss he
[1:52:15] gets us through the stuff he replaces
[1:52:19] what we lose so many times people out of
[1:52:22] the generosity of their hearts will
[1:52:25] reach out to help those that have lost
[1:52:28] the only thing that can't be restored is
[1:52:30] a life that is lost but even in death
[1:52:34] God is screaming to a
[1:52:38] community he's screaming to a nation yes
[1:52:42] he is you want to know one of the things
[1:52:44] he's saying keep your mouth and your
[1:52:47] hands off of My People
[1:52:50] Israel you'd better be careful what you
[1:52:54] say and how you treat
[1:52:59] them it's one of the things he's
[1:53:02] screaming there's message churches who
[1:53:05] don't ever ever ever take a moment to
[1:53:10] mention the importance of Israel and the
[1:53:13] importance of the Jewish people to
[1:53:16] encourage their congregations to pray
[1:53:19] for the Peace of Jerusalem
[1:53:22] the prophet told us watch sir watch
[1:53:27] watch Israel watch Jerusalem he says
[1:53:31] specifically for they are the time piece
[1:53:34] of God if you want to know what God is
[1:53:37] doing he said watch Israel if you want
[1:53:39] to know what's going on people say look
[1:53:41] at the newspaper but he said I want you
[1:53:44] to know if you want to know what God is
[1:53:47] doing you watch Israel you watch
[1:53:50] Jerusalem you watch the Jewish
[1:53:56] people it's it's
[1:53:59] uncanny if you start looking at the
[1:54:02] facts according to Noah the National
[1:54:06] Oceanic and Atmospheric
[1:54:09] Administration the US sustained
[1:54:14] 28 weather or climate
[1:54:18] disasters since between 1980
[1:54:22] and
[1:54:25] 2017 the estimate damage for each of
[1:54:30] those disasters that's named and
[1:54:32] numbered is about a billion
[1:54:36] dollars the total cost of these 208
[1:54:40] events weather related atmospheric
[1:54:42] related events cost this nation
[1:54:47] 1.1
[1:54:48] trillion
[1:54:51] dollar this
[1:54:53] data only goes to
[1:54:56] 2017 to update it would take us perhaps
[1:55:02] to $3 trillion dollar or more our nation
[1:55:07] has had to pay in
[1:55:10] repairing uh
[1:55:13] infrastructure for weather
[1:55:17] related
[1:55:19] damages what do you want to say to that
[1:55:21] I want to say this in the
[1:55:26] beginning
[1:55:28] God
[1:55:30] created the Heaven and the
[1:55:34] Earth since this idea we will give land
[1:55:39] for
[1:55:42] peace I was
[1:55:44] there when the withdrawal from Gaza took
[1:55:49] place I have told you multip Le
[1:55:53] times how s sad and sorrowful it was to
[1:55:59] see those people being drugg out of
[1:56:01] their
[1:56:02] homes by their own
[1:56:05] families police
[1:56:09] served their
[1:56:11] Nation pulling their own Brothers their
[1:56:14] own cousins out of their homes dragging
[1:56:17] them I saw it dragging them across the
[1:56:20] yard because they refused to give up
[1:56:22] their
[1:56:23] land but Washington
[1:56:29] said Washington
[1:56:31] convinced the
[1:56:34] knesset that the only way we'll stand
[1:56:37] with you is if you make every effort for
[1:56:40] peace and the only Road mapap forward
[1:56:43] would be to give up land listen if it
[1:56:45] was your yard and you gave it to me to
[1:56:49] keep us from having a Hatfield and McCoy
[1:56:51] situation that's one thing as long as
[1:56:54] that was really your
[1:56:56] yard if you gave me a foot off of the
[1:56:59] side of your property deeded it to me
[1:57:02] because you wanted to keep peace between
[1:57:04] neighbors that's one thing because that
[1:57:07] would be you giving up something that
[1:57:09] you
[1:57:11] owned that you held the deed to but
[1:57:14] listen the bureaucrats didn't own the
[1:57:16] land of
[1:57:17] Israel not the knesset not the Senate
[1:57:22] not the
[1:57:23] president not the United
[1:57:27] Nations they don't own the title deed to
[1:57:29] that land it's not given to the
[1:57:32] government of Israel that land is given
[1:57:34] to the Jews as an
[1:57:38] inheritance it's older than the balfor
[1:57:40] Declaration it's older than the United
[1:57:44] Nations uh you know declaration that
[1:57:47] that Israel shall be the homeland of the
[1:57:50] Jews it goes all the way back to a
[1:57:52] promise that God made to
[1:57:55] Abraham and he didn't say I'm going to
[1:57:57] give it to your concent member or I'm
[1:57:59] going to give it to your prime minister
[1:58:01] he said I'm going to give your
[1:58:05] seed an eternal
[1:58:07] inheritance in that land but men wise
[1:58:13] men
[1:58:16] decided not just
[1:58:19] Democrats it was Bush
[1:58:26] wise men decided that we'll give land
[1:58:29] for Peace So they pull out and the first
[1:58:33] thing the Palestinian people started
[1:58:35] doing was destroying the
[1:58:39] infrastructure they destroyed their
[1:58:43] future they burned their homes they
[1:58:46] burned they desecrated the graves of the
[1:58:48] Jews they dug up Toros Scrolls that had
[1:58:53] been uh given a
[1:58:56] a a solemn burial as they
[1:58:59] do they dug them up and set fire to them
[1:59:04] they destroyed green houses and
[1:59:08] farms and
[1:59:10] Orchards and millions of olive
[1:59:14] trees because they didn't
[1:59:17] want to swallow a Jewish Olive
[1:59:24] is there anybody that eats a
[1:59:27] pizza and wonders whether or not it has
[1:59:30] a Jewish Olive on it anybody in
[1:59:34] here and they don't mind to
[1:59:38] steal Jewish
[1:59:40] olives and Jewish grapes in the
[1:59:45] shomron in
[1:59:47] Samaria and when they get all they want
[1:59:50] off of them there in what the word World
[1:59:52] likes to call the West Bank they burn
[1:59:54] the
[1:59:56] trees they'll pick the grapes steal the
[1:59:58] grapes and burn the
[2:00:02] vines somebody said what are you talk
[2:00:04] you know I didn't know we were going to
[2:00:05] get racial here this has nothing to do
[2:00:07] with race it's a Biblical thing that's
[2:00:09] been unfolding I'm not going to preach
[2:00:12] on Israel but sure sounds like it it's
[2:00:14] been unfolding all of these years it it
[2:00:18] it really is it's that wild nature of
[2:00:20] ishmail right he mocked Isaac the real
[2:00:25] son Ishmael was given some inheritance
[2:00:28] but it was never enough and he had he
[2:00:31] inherited a wild nature as God said he
[2:00:34] would and it's a wild man that digs up
[2:00:38] carrots out of the ground and sets them
[2:00:40] a fire instead of eating them I mean if
[2:00:43] you don't like carrots I get it but
[2:00:45] surely there's somebody in your family
[2:00:47] that likes carrots right and you don't
[2:00:50] destroy the green houses and you don't
[2:00:52] destroy the seed that are going to give
[2:00:55] you more carrots for next year but their
[2:00:58] hatred you don't understand their
[2:01:02] hatred for the Jewish people is so
[2:01:06] severe that they want to do everything
[2:01:08] they can not only to murder them and
[2:01:10] wipe them off but as long as they have
[2:01:11] to live near them they want to spite
[2:01:14] them in every possible way that they
[2:01:17] can and that's the whole situation and
[2:01:20] America has tried to to be involved and
[2:01:23] they're all out of sort because no one
[2:01:26] called and asked their permission to
[2:01:29] take out one of the deadliest men that
[2:01:31] has ever lived and nobody called Biden
[2:01:35] who wouldn't have known he was being
[2:01:37] called in the first place excuse me
[2:01:39] President
[2:01:41] Biden he didn't know he missed the
[2:01:45] call no one called to say is it okay
[2:01:49] with you if we take out nazala we have
[2:01:52] an opportunity to take him out one of
[2:01:54] the deadliest men that has he is the
[2:01:57] deadliest man that's ever served
[2:02:00] holah but one of the deadliest
[2:02:02] terrorists in all the world thousands of
[2:02:05] men and women including Americans have
[2:02:07] died because of the
[2:02:09] plans that were hatched and executed by
[2:02:13] nazala and Israel said there's no
[2:02:15] there's no turning back now we cannot
[2:02:18] turn back folks why is that so hard for
[2:02:21] for Americans to understand you can't
[2:02:23] start something and then just back out
[2:02:26] and say you've got to finish this
[2:02:30] thing and God is saying to America do
[2:02:35] you want another
[2:02:40] Katrina do you want another
[2:02:45] Katrina do you want another one of these
[2:02:48] uh
[2:02:50] 208 weather an atmospheric events listen
[2:02:53] I didn't finish since the land for peace
[2:02:57] efforts began in Madrid Spain in the
[2:02:59] month of October 1991 there have been
[2:03:04] 1751
[2:03:05] billion
[2:03:07] events that's $175
[2:03:12] billion most of these catastroph C
[2:03:15] excuse me most of these catastrophes
[2:03:18] occurred while the United States was
[2:03:20] pressuring is Israel to once again
[2:03:23] divide the Covenant
[2:03:27] land the the
[2:03:31] uh the similarity there's no way there's
[2:03:34] no way that these are 208
[2:03:38] coincidences the odds would never let it
[2:03:41] be 208 coincidences if you want to read
[2:03:45] about any of this you can read it in in
[2:03:48] a book called eye to eye facing the
[2:03:51] consequence of dividing Israel by
[2:03:53] William kig some of you know that name
[2:03:56] because he's been reporting on things
[2:03:57] going on in Israel for a long time to my
[2:04:00] knowledge there has not been an update
[2:04:01] of those figures or those events since
[2:04:04] 2017 so the last edition of his book
[2:04:07] that I have access to is from 2017 but
[2:04:10] he did the math he not only did the math
[2:04:13] he broke these catastrophes down and
[2:04:15] told what was going on politically at
[2:04:18] that time and what was being said and
[2:04:20] who was saying it and why God had to get
[2:04:23] involved he is
[2:04:27] Sovereign you can't tell God what to do
[2:04:31] about his land or his
[2:04:35] people and the price that America is
[2:04:39] willing to pay for peace is not
[2:04:41] necessarily the price that God is
[2:04:43] willing to pay that's right and if
[2:04:46] anybody ought to be an expert on peace
[2:04:48] it's him he is SAR shalom he is the
[2:04:53] Prince of Peace somebody said how is
[2:04:56] this going to affect us I want you to
[2:04:58] know this is how and many more ways than
[2:05:01] what we will talk about today it was
[2:05:03] Appalachia now this
[2:05:06] time the spirit of the Lord spoke to my
[2:05:08] heart standing on the beach and he said
[2:05:10] this hurricane will cleanse the land
[2:05:12] like many that have come before it he
[2:05:15] said I'm erasing a blood curse across
[2:05:18] the regions that this storm will touch
[2:05:22] I'm dealing with something a blood curse
[2:05:25] it's connected to Witchcraft and I'm
[2:05:27] going to be dealing with that In This
[2:05:30] Storm and as of yet no one knew exactly
[2:05:33] where it was going to
[2:05:35] go and as a family we're sitting around
[2:05:38] in a living room that we've become
[2:05:40] familiar with because as often as we can
[2:05:42] we get the same house it's not on the
[2:05:44] beach it's much more affordable because
[2:05:47] it's off the beach but it's walking
[2:05:49] distance and we know what's there and
[2:05:51] and somebody stole the toaster so we had
[2:05:54] to get them to bring us the toaster but
[2:05:56] we make a list of what's there and we
[2:05:58] know what's there and they're going to
[2:05:59] sell the house that we uh have enjoyed
[2:06:03] and unfortunately not to
[2:06:08] us the real estate man said why don't
[2:06:10] you just buy it and I said oh yes I'll
[2:06:14] write a check this
[2:06:18] afternoon God said I'm doing some things
[2:06:21] we didn't know we sat around in the
[2:06:22] living room as a family and made the
[2:06:24] decision we were scheduled to leave on
[2:06:26] Friday morning but we we knew when we
[2:06:29] left that they would offer us uh Friday
[2:06:32] night at a discount and so our plans
[2:06:34] were to come home Saturday but now this
[2:06:37] thing is getting closer and closer and
[2:06:39] if you think your coverage was off the
[2:06:42] chain you should have been there on the
[2:06:44] coast you should have heard the things
[2:06:47] they were saying oh my goodness they
[2:06:49] were leaving very uh little possibility
[2:06:53] of of
[2:06:54] survival and I'm not
[2:06:57] exaggerating and they have to do that
[2:06:59] CUA you've got some hard-headed old
[2:07:00] folks live in
[2:07:03] Florida and so they got to make it sound
[2:07:06] you know like
[2:07:08] Armageddon and and I can't tell you that
[2:07:10] don't get under your skin just a little
[2:07:12] bit and and they said you know this
[2:07:14] thing could come it it certainly could
[2:07:17] come right up through uh the destined
[2:07:20] area
[2:07:22] and uh it has before and it can again in
[2:07:26] Panama City is only 30
[2:07:29] miles 30 minutes from where we were in
[2:07:33] Panama City has had some devastating
[2:07:35] ones in fact you all will remember that
[2:07:38] one of the West sons was
[2:07:40] missing and they they found him safe but
[2:07:44] Panama City has been hit so hard in the
[2:07:46] past so we realize that we were uh in a
[2:07:49] place but we just kept s sing and
[2:07:52] praying and believing that God had a
[2:07:53] purpose and as a family we decided to
[2:07:56] put ourselves in God's
[2:07:58] hands and just see just waited out and
[2:08:02] see what to do and that he would lead us
[2:08:06] and God began to talk and I was actually
[2:08:08] standing on the balcony of our house
[2:08:11] everyone else had gone to bed I was
[2:08:13] standing on the balcony of our house
[2:08:15] just after the storm had made landfall
[2:08:18] in a light drizzle with only a little
[2:08:20] bit of Gusty wins and it was in that
[2:08:22] moment that the Lord said don't let
[2:08:24] anybody give the devil this
[2:08:27] one this one is
[2:08:30] mine and it is going to accomplish my
[2:08:34] purpose and my
[2:08:39] plan God wants us to know that as a
[2:08:43] nation we better take our hands off of
[2:08:47] Israel God wants us to know as a as a a
[2:08:50] body of Believers we better wake up in
[2:08:54] fact the the very thing that the Lord
[2:08:57] spoke to my heart standing there on the
[2:08:59] balcony was found in Romans chapter
[2:09:04] 13 and I want to read that to you in a
[2:09:06] moment but
[2:09:09] uh let me give you Romans uh
[2:09:12] 13 and
[2:09:15] uh verse 11 and 12 can you do that I
[2:09:18] know that it's I'm giving it to you out
[2:09:20] of order but let me just read those
[2:09:22] 11 and 12 and that
[2:09:25] knowing that's Amplified can we go back
[2:09:28] just before that to King James and that
[2:09:30] knowing the time that now this is what I
[2:09:33] heard him say it is high time this was
[2:09:36] to the church this was to the churches
[2:09:39] in the region it's to us but it was to
[2:09:43] the churches in the region that would be
[2:09:45] touched by the storm and that can be
[2:09:48] from Florida all the way up to wherever
[2:09:50] it finally makes its last
[2:09:53] dump because no one really saw it
[2:09:57] flooding Asheville and going up and
[2:10:00] taking out part of the interstate
[2:10:01] between uh Gatlinburg and Asheville the
[2:10:05] interstate bridge is gone but God said
[2:10:09] I'm talking I'm talking and here's what
[2:10:12] I'm saying knowing the time that now it
[2:10:14] is high time to wake out of
[2:10:18] sleep I'm talking to the churches in
[2:10:20] that Reg
[2:10:21] I'm talking to the churches in this
[2:10:23] nation I'm talking to this church the
[2:10:27] Lord is saying I'm talking to you it is
[2:10:31] high time to awake out of sleep for now
[2:10:37] is our Salvation nearer yes
[2:10:42] sir than what we
[2:10:44] believed there's no time left for
[2:10:48] playing
[2:10:50] around not for churches in the region
[2:10:53] affected not for this church not for any
[2:10:57] Bible believing
[2:10:59] church not for any Bible believing
[2:11:04] Christian if you're not reading your
[2:11:06] Bible every day something is
[2:11:11] wrong it's going to get
[2:11:14] quiet brother bandham said I believe
[2:11:17] that a Christian should read their Bible
[2:11:19] two to three times
[2:11:24] every
[2:11:29] day I I expect it to be
[2:11:33] quiet because there's very few of us
[2:11:36] that can say that we do does reading it
[2:11:39] on our phone count it does but only
[2:11:42] reading it as someone's post on social
[2:11:45] media
[2:11:48] on that doesn't really count because
[2:11:50] you're not really really focused on that
[2:11:53] your thumb is already
[2:11:55] ready there are people among us sitting
[2:11:58] right here this morning it's going to
[2:11:59] get quiet here now there are people
[2:12:01] sitting right here Among Us that would
[2:12:03] actually scroll up if they saw a
[2:12:07] reference if they thought they were
[2:12:08] going to have to read a verse of
[2:12:10] scripture not that they hate the
[2:12:12] scripture they just don't love it come
[2:12:14] on it's not that you hate it it's just
[2:12:16] you don't love it you've just not been
[2:12:18] in love with the word in a long time
[2:12:23] just a tell us
[2:12:25] brother you just haven't loved the word
[2:12:28] like we need to love the word and now is
[2:12:30] our opportunity to do that I don't
[2:12:33] believe that it has to be a leatherbound
[2:12:35] Bible I believe you can read it
[2:12:37] electronically but read
[2:12:40] it and I will tell you that that reading
[2:12:43] it in a in a in a bit in a real book a
[2:12:46] real codex a real uh you know sewn
[2:12:49] together thing
[2:12:51] paper and ink you are less distracted
[2:12:55] because there are no other notifications
[2:12:57] popping up no weather notifications no
[2:13:00] credit card bills due notification no
[2:13:03] cash app notification come
[2:13:08] on and somebody said I can't be away
[2:13:10] from my phone that long yes you can yes
[2:13:14] you can yes you can yes you can sir it's
[2:13:19] high time
[2:13:21] Florida Georgia Alabama South Carolina
[2:13:25] North Carolina Tennessee Virginia and
[2:13:28] wherever Kentucky and wherever else it's
[2:13:32] high
[2:13:34] time God said I'll use this to cleanse
[2:13:37] some of the curse that blood has brought
[2:13:40] the shedding of innocent blood has
[2:13:42] brought on the land I I'll use this rain
[2:13:45] as a
[2:13:47] symbol of pushing some things out that
[2:13:51] need to be pushed out but in the process
[2:13:53] of this my people better wake up my
[2:13:57] people better come to the awareness that
[2:13:59] that our Salvation hallelujah our
[2:14:02] Redemption is nearer than what we have
[2:14:05] first believed we are closer to that
[2:14:08] moment than we have ever been before
[2:14:11] it's time to wake up it's time to get
[2:14:13] out of our sleep it's time to recognize
[2:14:16] our Salvation is nearer than what we
[2:14:18] believe the night is are spent the day
[2:14:23] is at hand let us hear us let us
[2:14:28] therefore cast
[2:14:34] off I just don't find myself visiting
[2:14:38] some of the things I used to visit I I
[2:14:42] just find my interest is Shifting and
[2:14:44] I'm not being pulled in that direction
[2:14:46] nearly as much listen folks this is not
[2:14:48] gradually getting over Darkness
[2:14:54] this is making up your mind to be
[2:15:00] extreme if you think Jesus wasn't
[2:15:03] extreme he said if you can't keep your
[2:15:06] eye where it ought to
[2:15:11] be pluck it
[2:15:16] out I'm not suggesting that anyone blind
[2:15:19] themselves
[2:15:21] I'm not suggesting that anyone do
[2:15:23] themselves bodily harm I'm just telling
[2:15:25] you what Jesus said if your right arm
[2:15:27] offends you cut it off you know what
[2:15:29] he's saying he's saying quit making your
[2:15:31] silly little excuses about how busy you
[2:15:34] are it's your soul it's your eternity
[2:15:39] that is at
[2:15:41] stake you you you mean to tell me
[2:15:44] there's anything more
[2:15:48] important than watching for your own
[2:15:50] life life and watching for your
[2:15:53] children's
[2:15:54] life we're we're beckering over things
[2:15:57] that don't matter and fretting over
[2:15:59] things that don't matter and saying we
[2:16:02] believe in a sovereign God and then
[2:16:04] blaming the devil for everything bad
[2:16:06] that comes our way we're
[2:16:10] confused we're just
[2:16:13] confused the Bible said a double-minded
[2:16:16] man
[2:16:21] don't you be the man that kicks the
[2:16:22] television out and then you know after a
[2:16:25] while you bring it back
[2:16:29] in if you make up your mind to get rid
[2:16:32] of that thing get rid of it and don't
[2:16:34] ever ever ever ever take it
[2:16:38] back if you can't do that put a blanket
[2:16:42] over
[2:16:45] it that doesn't help you you're going to
[2:16:47] have to make up your mind listen there
[2:16:49] there are people who shouldn't
[2:16:53] sleep on a property where there is
[2:16:58] one because they're so addicted to
[2:17:03] it there are people that shouldn't have
[2:17:06] access to the
[2:17:08] internet at
[2:17:10] all because they're so addicted to the
[2:17:13] bad things I Don't Preach like this
[2:17:16] often you say are aren't you preaching
[2:17:18] to the bride yes I'm I'm talking to all
[2:17:20] of us I'm talking to all of us but I'm
[2:17:23] just saying be careful be careful you
[2:17:25] can have sympathy we've got to pray for
[2:17:27] folks that are in trouble but let me
[2:17:29] tell you something don't you dare say
[2:17:32] that Satan sent this storm don't you
[2:17:34] dare say that the devil is doing this to
[2:17:37] distract us from the things of God don't
[2:17:40] you dare say some religious jargon like
[2:17:44] that because God said I create in the
[2:17:49] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[2:17:52] earth oh it gets bigger than that it
[2:17:56] gets bigger than that I'm all over the
[2:17:58] place sovereignty means to exercise
[2:18:01] Supreme and independent Authority he is
[2:18:03] going to have sons to fellowship with
[2:18:05] throughout all eternity and he's going
[2:18:07] to bring them forth in this hour and
[2:18:09] he's going to squeeze them out we're
[2:18:11] coming out of this thing by being
[2:18:14] squeezed out of it your Comforts are
[2:18:17] going to be challenged
[2:18:22] [Music]
[2:18:25] before this thing is over you may have
[2:18:26] to fill your tub with
[2:18:29] water in preparation for not having
[2:18:32] water through a storm come

[2:19:02] family could have a uh
[2:19:06] supplemental charge you know what I mean
[2:19:09] a a power
[2:19:11] bank little Gadget that you charge up

[2:19:15] battery you plug it in it'll charge up
[2:19:18] your devices how many of you are with me
[2:19:19] sorry it took me so long to describe it
[2:19:21] to you there weren't any to
[2:19:23] have because people don't have landlines
[2:19:27] anymore and so they knew that if they
[2:19:29] lost power they would lose access to the
[2:19:31] outside world people are safe and they
[2:19:33] have no way to tell their families
[2:19:34] they're safe because they don't listen
[2:19:37] oh we dodged the bullet I want you to
[2:19:39] know something you better shut your
[2:19:41] mouth dodg the bullet
[2:19:44] nothing The Sovereign Grace of God said
[2:19:48] I'm going to in this situation going to
[2:19:51] accomplish my will and my plan and my
[2:19:53] purposes I'm going to put this where I
[2:19:55] want it to be in this hour I'm not going
[2:19:57] to forget those that are mine they may
[2:20:00] lose they may go through some difficulty
[2:20:03] I have friends that are are being
[2:20:05] greatly inconvenience some are medically
[2:20:08] challenged and need help and there I
[2:20:11] don't want you to think I know someone
[2:20:13] is going to see this and you're going to
[2:20:15] think I'm heartless and callous and I
[2:20:17] have no compassion and that I don't pray
[2:20:19] for those who are suffering and I don't
[2:20:21] care because it hasn't affected me
[2:20:23] nothing could be any further from the
[2:20:25] truth I'm only telling you what I truly
[2:20:28] believe the Lord has spoken to me in
[2:20:30] this don't say you dodged a
[2:20:35] bullet this one is
[2:20:40] mine I'm in this one somebody said is
[2:20:44] that even biblical naom said it was naom
[2:20:46] said he's the god of the Whirlwind God's
[2:20:48] in it
[2:20:51] and you need not
[2:20:53] think that that you're you know the some
[2:20:56] of these uh uh crazy charismatic
[2:21:02] types you know bobbed haired women that
[2:21:05] dye their hair pink and purple and
[2:21:07] yellow and all these silly colors God
[2:21:10] don't do that God Don't Make freaks like
[2:21:12] that that's what you did because you
[2:21:15] wanted to be that way God don't make
[2:21:17] people you don't see babies coming out
[2:21:19] of the womb with purple hair I'm just
[2:21:20] going to tell you like it is this
[2:21:21] morning wake your neighbor up you don't

[2:21:43] things in pornography but you don't find
[2:21:46] them among God's people
[2:21:52] it's a spirit of this age that has
[2:21:54] influenced the church and if you don't
[2:21:56] think it's present in message
[2:21:59] circles all you have to do is just post
[2:22:01] one little quote about a Christmas tree
[2:22:03] and you'll find there are more Pharisees
[2:22:05] around this message and in the
[2:22:07] Assemblies of God don't talk about
[2:22:12] denominations we've got some right
[2:22:14] around this message yes sir who will
[2:22:17] stand on it if it suits their lifestyle
[2:22:19] but if it know no longer suits their
[2:22:21] grandchildren or great grand or children
[2:22:24] then they'll give them a Christmas tree
[2:22:27] buy them dresses above the knee put
[2:22:29] little girls in britches because they're
[2:22:31] too young to know the difference and all
[2:22:33] the kinds of things we see happening

[2:23:48] close god listen what what
[2:23:51] he's going to have sons to fellowship
[2:23:52] with throughout all eternity toward this
[2:23:54] purpose he's going to make all things
[2:23:56] work together for good do you believe
[2:23:57] that all things somebody say all things
[2:24:01] and we know and we know and we know and
[2:24:04] we know and we know and we know that all
[2:24:10] things I bought a lemon all things I
[2:24:15] bought a dog and it died
[2:24:18] all things RI the zipper out of my jeans
[2:24:22] all things got a hole in my shoe all
[2:24:29] things can't charge my phone
[2:24:34] all got a swamp in my backyard all
[2:24:38] things I'm talking to you God's saying
[2:24:40] I'm I want you to know that I am
[2:24:42] Sovereign and I am above it all and you
[2:24:45] you know these women like I was talking
[2:24:46] about just a moment ago purple green
[2:24:48] yellow hair whatever they are get them a
[2:24:50] stick and shake it at the storm and
[2:24:53] think there's some kind of prophet like
[2:24:55] Moses or something and command the storm
[2:24:57] to go this way and that way and the
[2:24:59] other way and carrying on all this
[2:25:00] foolishness and the conference world is
[2:25:03] all behind that out there you know what
[2:25:05] they call a Revival is a
[2:25:09] mess and they're running here and there
[2:25:12] commanding storms and telling godod to
[2:25:15] fall and all the kinds of things they
[2:25:17] get in their head and God said don't you
[2:25:19] know I don't don't really need
[2:25:24] you to tell me what to do in my
[2:25:28] business I don't need you to tell me
[2:25:30] where the storm ought to
[2:25:34] go I don't need you to tell me what
[2:25:37] direction it needs to go
[2:25:39] in let me tell you something the church
[2:25:42] is not walking in that kind of authority
[2:25:44] anyway the bride is growing up into that
[2:25:46] kind of
[2:25:48] authority and even with that Authority
[2:25:50] you got to be careful because you can
[2:25:52] talk something right out of its hour
[2:25:54] right out of its
[2:25:56] season you the best thing that we can
[2:25:58] pray when we don't know what to pray and
[2:26:01] if the Holy Ghost won't talk through us
[2:26:03] in prayer with groanings that cannot be
[2:26:05] uttered or understood then what we need
[2:26:07] to say is as it is in
[2:26:10] heaven as it is in
[2:26:13] heaven in Earth even as it is in heaven
[2:26:16] in Earth even as it is in heaven yes God
[2:26:21] must be omnipotent someone say
[2:26:23] omnipotent he is omnipotent all powerful
[2:26:26] over all things to make this statement
[2:26:29] let me ask you a question what does all
[2:26:31] leave
[2:26:35] out what are the are you still here what
[2:26:39] are the exceptions to
[2:26:40] all does all mean all that's all if God
[2:26:45] is omnipotent if he has all power he
[2:26:48] must also be omniscient
[2:26:52] because in order to have all power
[2:26:54] you've got to be all
[2:26:55] knowing if there's anything God doesn't
[2:26:57] know he chose not to know it that's
[2:27:00] right everything else is in his hand
[2:27:03] it's in his mind he knows it he must be
[2:27:06] omniscient all knowing in order to make
[2:27:08] such all-encompassing statements in his
[2:27:10] word that's right let's look at a quote
[2:27:13] or two here for just a moment are you
[2:27:14] with me praise God good glory be to God
[2:27:18] no I didn't fall I'm okay okay provide
[2:27:21] some details I did not fall all is
[2:27:24] well okay praise God in a message called
[2:27:30] uh the infallible proof of the
[2:27:31] Resurrection he said now the devil has
[2:27:33] fought after he seen that he thought he
[2:27:35] destroyed that righteous seat at Calvary
[2:27:37] and let's stand by just a moment and
[2:27:39] watch something take place what a
[2:27:42] display could you ever imagine the
[2:27:44] omnipotent omnipresent omniscient
[2:27:48] infinite God what
[2:27:53] he might have been a Kentucky Gentleman
[2:27:55] but he knew how to spit this
[2:27:57] out could you ever imagine the
[2:27:59] omnipotent omnipresent omniscient
[2:28:01] infinite God ever letting the
[2:28:07] devil defeat his
[2:28:12] purpose why the devil just stir up that
[2:28:14] old storm to ruin my vacation the
[2:28:17] thought never crossed my mind
[2:28:22] and if it ever crosses your mind it's a
[2:28:24] distraction it's a lie just rebuke it
[2:28:26] and send it on its way everything that
[2:28:30] causes you a little difficulty the devil
[2:28:32] may not be guilty of sending at all
[2:28:36] right what God doesn't
[2:28:40] instigate he often times
[2:28:43] allows come on and there they go there
[2:28:47] they go I rebuke you devil I take
[2:28:49] authority over you devil I command you
[2:28:52] devil take your hands off of my vacation
[2:28:55] take your hands off of my County oh God
[2:28:58] I I command the de blah blah blah blah
[2:29:03] blah blah blah
[2:29:09] blah God said could you ever imagine him
[2:29:11] the prophet could you ever imagine the
[2:29:14] omnipotent omnipresent omniscient
[2:29:16] infinite God ever letting the devil
[2:29:17] defeat his purpose read it
[2:29:21] no not God read the last would you he
[2:29:25] will when will he do it he will never do
[2:29:29] it he'll never let the devil defeat his
[2:29:31] purposes he is omnipotent omnipresent
[2:29:34] omniscient and infinite he will never
[2:29:36] let the devil he will never let the
[2:29:37] devil he will never let the devil defeat
[2:29:39] his purpose Hallelujah the purposes of
[2:29:42] God are going to be fulfilled in this
[2:29:48] election all those religious people that
[2:29:50] say then we don't have to vote that's
[2:29:52] wrong that's not what this thing is
[2:29:54] about we are always told in every
[2:29:56] situation to do our part prayer is
[2:29:59] always right it's always right to talk
[2:30:02] to God about it and if you if you know
[2:30:06] that something's coming that's God and
[2:30:08] you don't like it you're
[2:30:11] human and so what you say is you come in
[2:30:14] into prayer and you say Lord I might not
[2:30:17] necessarily like what's coming down the
[2:30:18] river now
[2:30:20] I I I I I may not be real but I want you
[2:30:24] to help me not to get in your
[2:30:32] ways he's a sovereign God for
[2:30:35] us and through us oh God I don't want to
[2:30:40] get in your way so help me I'm going to
[2:30:43] pray what I know is right I'm going to
[2:30:46] vote what I know is right I'm going to
[2:30:49] do what I know is right but in the end
[2:30:52] I'm going to praise
[2:30:54] you the Lord gives the Lord takes away
[2:30:57] blessed be the name of the Lord blessed
[2:31:00] be the name of the Lord blessed be the
[2:31:02] name of the Lord I think the worst thing
[2:31:04] that seemingly could happened to this
[2:31:06] nation in November is that this
[2:31:28] one who ride at the
[2:31:31] broom in
[2:31:34] folklore I wouldn't trust a thing that
[2:31:37] comes out of her forked
[2:31:41] tongue I don't trust everything I hear
[2:31:44] former president Trump say either you
[2:31:46] you need to know the balance he's not my
[2:31:48] savior and he is far from a righteous
[2:31:53] man but you don't have to be righteous
[2:31:55] to be used of God the Bible tells us so
[2:31:59] there's at least seven examples in the
[2:32:01] Bible where God used wicked men to
[2:32:04] accomplish his
[2:32:06] [Music]
[2:32:08] purposes that's the balance that's a
[2:32:11] balance he's not holy no somebody said
[2:32:15] he's a convicted felon many of our
[2:32:17] presidents were by the way right it's
[2:32:20] not a new thing and just because you've
[2:32:22] got somebody 12 somebodies or or 24
[2:32:25] somebodies or 36 somebodies who say
[2:32:28] you're guilty only at the end of the day
[2:32:30] the victim in you you know you know and
[2:32:33] I want you to know just because somebody
[2:32:35] swear something doesn't mean it's the
[2:32:41] truth there are a lot of people serving
[2:32:44] time and serving in prison because of
[2:32:46] what is called repressed memories that
[2:32:48] are really lies of Satan
[2:32:52] the thing never
[2:32:53] happened it never even really
[2:32:58] happened but you know there are certain
[2:33:01] psychologists and psychiatrist and
[2:33:04] whatever they might be who who have a
[2:33:06] way of I've watched it
[2:33:11] done leading people into some kind of
[2:33:14] imagery where you start forming a
[2:33:17] picture in your mind and call it a a a
[2:33:19] supr ressed or repressed memory and and
[2:33:22] and uh it's horrible it's terrible what
[2:33:24] has happened in in families it has
[2:33:27] destroyed families it has broken homes
[2:33:30] it has destroyed lives the poor
[2:33:34] victim who's really only a victim to an
[2:33:37] evil memory that Satan has tried to use
[2:33:39] to confuse and destroy their life
[2:33:42] they're the ones
[2:33:44] losing and I pray I pray often for for
[2:33:48] folks in that situation because we were
[2:33:51] actually faced with a situation like
[2:33:53] that some years ago not in this church
[2:33:56] but something was being told that that
[2:33:58] was supposed to have happened in another
[2:34:01] church and the Lord just said that's not
[2:34:04] how it was it that is not what happened
[2:34:06] that is not how it
[2:34:08] happened and it's time to be honest and
[2:34:11] it's time to tell the truth it's time to
[2:34:13] come
[2:34:14] clean and if you're not willing to do
[2:34:17] that it's not easy
[2:34:20] especially if you've sworn a lie and so
[2:34:23] you get into all the the moral
[2:34:26] implications of a a former president
[2:34:28] Trump you look at all the thing why you
[2:34:30] may be just as turned off by him as you
[2:34:32] are
[2:34:34] her and I wouldn't blame you if you were
[2:34:38] but here's the deal God's going to have
[2:34:40] a plan you pray what your heart leads
[2:34:42] you to pray you stand for what your
[2:34:46] heart leads you to stand for you you are
[2:34:49] an americ American and by that right you
[2:34:51] have a right to
[2:34:53] vote and they're fighting to give
[2:34:56] illegal immigrants the right to to draw
[2:34:59] Social Security uh checks and eventually
[2:35:03] even to vote I if if they have the
[2:35:08] right you certainly have the right and
[2:35:10] should have the right well brother bam
[2:35:12] told us to not have anything to do that
[2:35:13] I know he did and yet he voted for Nixon
[2:35:22] yes he said
[2:35:25] so so here's the thing it's like
[2:35:27] scripture you have to take it
[2:35:31] all you can't take it out of context you
[2:35:34] can't take one quote where brother
[2:35:36] brandom said don't have anything to do
[2:35:37] with that
[2:35:38] politics and stand on that when you've
[2:35:41] got a quote over here where he says well
[2:35:42] I voted for
[2:35:46] Nixon you take it off so so what do you
[2:35:49] so so what's the balance to that let the
[2:35:51] Lord lead your heart let your heart be
[2:35:53] led by the spirit of
[2:35:56] God but I just don't feel like we have
[2:35:58] the right to complain and belly ache and
[2:36:00] Grumble and gripe about the outcome of
[2:36:02] something if we don't at least do our
[2:36:04] tiny little part I'm just being honest
[2:36:08] but God is Sovereign it doesn't matter
[2:36:11] who gets there their heart's going to be
[2:36:12] in the hand of the king the Bible said
[2:36:14] the Bible said he turns the heart of the
[2:36:18] king
[2:36:20] he puts up Kings he pulls down
[2:36:24] Kings look how many have tried to get
[2:36:27] rid of uh uh prime minister Benjamin
[2:36:30] Netanyahu 40
[2:36:34] years for 40 years they've tried to
[2:36:38] stamp out his
[2:36:40] voice I don't think he's a 100%
[2:36:42] righteous man I think he's also made
[2:36:45] mistakes but he acknowledges those
[2:36:47] mistakes and he he gives credit and
[2:36:49] Glory to almighty God and it doesn't
[2:36:52] matter what anybody thinks about him
[2:36:53] anyway it doesn't even matter what his
[2:36:55] wife thinks about him it doesn't matter
[2:36:56] what what Israel thinks about him for
[2:36:58] such a time as this come on for 40 long
[2:37:02] years because even before he was the
[2:37:05] Prime Minister of Israel he was standing
[2:37:07] up in the United Nations for Israel just
[2:37:09] like he did this week and if you didn't
[2:37:11] hear the speech that he gave 20 minutes
[2:37:14] before nazala was taken out in
[2:37:17] Lebanon yes on if you didn't hear that
[2:37:20] speech you'd know you if you heard it
[2:37:22] you knew you were hearing a lion
[2:37:24] roar you don't have to get involved in
[2:37:26] the politics of the moment but you would
[2:37:28] know that you're hearing a lion roar and
[2:37:30] you would know why the enemy has tried
[2:37:33] but it doesn't do him any good because
[2:37:35] he just keeps going in one of these days
[2:37:37] he won't be there anymore he'll either
[2:37:39] die or or the Lord God will allow
[2:37:41] someone else to take his place and they
[2:37:44] may try to end him in a scandal and they
[2:37:46] may try it won't matter his work will be
[2:37:48] finished for such a time as this for
[2:37:50] such a time as this for such a time as
[2:37:56] this he's
[2:37:59] Sovereign when he looked at his family
[2:38:01] in the Garden of Eden when little Adam
[2:38:03] and Eve her lovely little head laying on
[2:38:04] Adam's shoulder as he moved through the
[2:38:07] garden and if the winds blowed and
[2:38:09] little Eve said oh Adam said peace be
[2:38:12] still and the wind stopped and the lion
[2:38:15] and the tiger followed them oh
[2:38:17] Hallelujah they were like kittens
[2:38:20] by the way if this is your little calico
[2:38:22] cat that's running around the church
[2:38:23] would you please collect
[2:38:26] him take him to your house I don't
[2:38:29] intend to have a cat at my feet coming
[2:38:31] in my office
[2:38:34] door so if he belongs to you pleas
[2:38:36] please put him in a box a leash take him
[2:38:39] home with you put him in your
[2:38:42] purse make a thousand post on Facebook
[2:38:45] about how cute cats are but get him off
[2:38:49] this property keep him if you live on
[2:38:51] the property keep him in your
[2:38:53] yard buy a
[2:38:55] fence I am not going to have a cat
[2:38:59] brushing up against me coming in to
[2:39:02] preach the
[2:39:09] gospel no extra charge for that they
[2:39:12] carry spirits but so do people and we
[2:39:14] can't get rid of
[2:39:16] them they were like little kittens and
[2:39:19] in the evening when the sun was going
[2:39:21] down and they went to the cathedral
[2:39:23] under the palm trees or whatever trees
[2:39:24] it was in Eden they began to worship a
[2:39:26] soft mellow light God the logos come
[2:39:29] down over the top of the trees he said
[2:39:32] children have you enjoyed yourselves
[2:39:34] today on the
[2:39:36] earth I have come down to kiss you good
[2:39:40] night and to lay them down at sleep and
[2:39:44] he laid all of his animals down to rest
[2:39:45] through the night the father said that's
[2:39:47] good I like the way it's done do you
[2:39:50] think that the heavenly father will be
[2:39:52] defeated in his purpose even though
[2:39:55] Satan has done what he's done it's an
[2:39:58] impossibility hello hello
[2:40:01] hello it's an impossibility he will not
[2:40:04] be defeated and he's given us a perfect
[2:40:07] assurance and that's not
[2:40:10] afflac he's given us a perfect assurance
[2:40:13] that we will not have to be
[2:40:31] you don't have to be scared of
[2:40:34] anything somebody said shouldn't we
[2:40:36] exercise wisdom of course we
[2:40:39] should but you're not likely to need all
[2:40:42] 50 of those
[2:40:44] guns in one particular
[2:40:48] situation one will probably get the job
[2:40:50] done if it's big enough to do the
[2:40:55] job and quite frankly some people just
[2:40:58] probably ought not to own them
[2:41:03] anyway I'm not for gun
[2:41:07] control I am for some common
[2:41:10] sense if you don't know how to properly
[2:41:13] use it you might kill yourself instead
[2:41:16] of the one that's trying to kill you
[2:41:20] little wisdom goes a long way and aren't
[2:41:22] we blessed to know that we have Holy
[2:41:26] Ghost you don't have to be scared of
[2:41:28] anything is anybody with
[2:41:31] me 10 more
[2:41:34] minutes and we shall see the scriptures
[2:41:37] Proclaim that God has Sovereign control
[2:41:39] over all things that have that have
[2:41:41] anything to do with your life he never
[2:41:44] falls off the throne and we shall see he
[2:41:46] never shares the throne with the Devil
[2:41:49] devil huh The Authority that the devil
[2:41:53] has is according to God's designs and
[2:41:56] laws brother brandom tells us that
[2:41:58] doesn't he the only Power the devil has
[2:41:59] is what you give
[2:42:03] him he can be Mighty powerful in the
[2:42:05] life of somebody that keeps surrendering
[2:42:07] authority to
[2:42:09] him and if you're busy blaming God
[2:42:11] blaming the devil for what God does
[2:42:19] in the message Rapture the last the last
[2:42:22] uh message in in the
[2:42:25] west if God is
[2:42:28] infinite Almighty all powerful om
[2:42:33] omnipresent omniscient why why he know
[2:42:37] all things what part of all does all
[2:42:40] leave
[2:42:41] out all of it no no no all means all
[2:42:45] that's all he knowed all things from the
[2:42:48] beginning so he knowed he knew there's
[2:42:51] nothing out of cater it's just as he
[2:42:53] thinks it's just excuse me it's just us
[2:42:55] that thinks it
[2:43:01] is it's everything it's everything run
[2:43:04] look back in his word and see what he's
[2:43:05] doing then we'll have an understanding
[2:43:07] God give us an understanding are you
[2:43:11] telling me that it was God's
[2:43:15] will to flood a valley and destroy a
[2:43:18] hospital hpit and leave people on the
[2:43:20] top of the hospital praying for a
[2:43:22] helicopter to get out it
[2:43:30] was and had it not been God's
[2:43:33] will I know there was at least one Holy
[2:43:36] Ghost message believer on that roof yes
[2:43:39] sir and I have a friend who I would
[2:43:41] consider to be a nominal Christian who
[2:43:44] was on that roof there were only 60 what
[2:43:46] 65 people up there something like that
[2:43:48] so I know at least two of the people and
[2:43:50] if I had a list of their names because
[2:43:52] of the area that it's in I might have
[2:43:54] known more people that were standing on
[2:43:56] top of that roof and because there was
[2:43:58] one Bible believer one who believed the
[2:44:01] whole message of the hour I want you to
[2:44:04] know the devil couldn't have drowned
[2:44:05] that woman had he tried
[2:44:09] to the the helicopters tried to come and
[2:44:12] the and the wind wouldn't let the
[2:44:13] helicopters land they had to stay there
[2:44:15] longer and uh somebody said from from
[2:44:18] the from who was there they were reading
[2:44:21] the
[2:44:23] Bible and praying and giving God
[2:44:29] praise you say well so were the one
[2:44:31] standing on the deck of the Titanic but
[2:44:33] I want you to
[2:44:35] know it was God Who let that thing
[2:44:39] go he said you you're getting too big
[2:44:43] for your britches sometime you mean that
[2:44:45] would be God's will yes because in that
[2:44:49] instance he was going to swoop
[2:44:52] in and say to all involved Fox News
[2:44:55] picked it up it was carried all over the
[2:44:57] world here's this bunch of folks
[2:44:59] standing on the top of the hospital
[2:45:00] calling on the name of the
[2:45:03] Lord and God glorified in that God
[2:45:08] doesn't get Glory if the devil's the one
[2:45:09] doing
[2:45:10] it God is
[2:45:13] Sovereign he doesn't want to see people
[2:45:15] suffer but he's got a
[2:45:17] message he's still talking he's telling
[2:45:21] churches wake
[2:45:24] up he's telling New Hope Revival Min
[2:45:27] wake
[2:45:28] up the night is far spent the day is at
[2:45:32] a hand our Salvation is nearer than what
[2:45:36] we have
[2:45:40] believed If he if he is an infinite who
[2:45:44] is this mzc if he is an infinite he
[2:45:46] isn't God infinite means having all
[2:45:48] power
[2:45:49] he isn't God how can you have all power
[2:45:53] and the devil have some of
[2:45:56] it God has to be infinite we are
[2:46:01] finite he is infinite and he was
[2:46:04] omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent if
[2:46:07] he isn't if he isn't somebody read the
[2:46:11] rest would you
[2:46:15] please there's no margin here to to play
[2:46:18] with If he if he's not all those things
[2:46:20] he's not
[2:46:22] God he he didn't even have somebody say
[2:46:24] all he had to do is speak to the storm
[2:46:26] folks the creator doesn't have to talk
[2:46:28] if he don't want to talk that's right
[2:46:30] all he would have had to do
[2:46:32] just wi it
[2:46:35] so he allowed it because he's sending a
[2:46:39] message there's some stuff that's got to
[2:46:41] be dealt with and one of the things
[2:46:42] that's got to be dealt with is the
[2:46:44] church the believer has got to stand up
[2:46:47] for Israel's right to possess the land
[2:46:49] because it's not a political right it's
[2:46:51] a god-given
[2:46:54] right no black person should be hated
[2:46:56] because of the color of their skin no
[2:46:58] muslim Arab should be hated because of
[2:47:00] the color of their skin no Jew should be
[2:47:02] hated because he was a Jew no Caucasian
[2:47:05] should be hated because they're
[2:47:08] Caucasian there's no racism involved in
[2:47:11] this
[2:47:12] whatsoever it's you bless what God bless
[2:47:14] you curse what God curse and if you
[2:47:16] don't get ready to be cursed that's
[2:47:19] because that's what the word
[2:47:21] said he's omnipotent he's omnipresent
[2:47:24] omnicient omnipotent he isn't he isn't
[2:47:26] God knows all things all places because
[2:47:29] he's omnipresent omniscient makes him
[2:47:31] omn omnipresent he is being he's not
[2:47:33] like the wind he's a being he's a spirit
[2:47:36] he dwells in a house but being
[2:47:37] omniscient knowing all things makes him
[2:47:39] omnipresent because he knows everything
[2:47:42] that's going on he can be everywhere
[2:47:43] anywhere and everywhere because God is a
[2:47:47] spirit right that can't that I remember
[2:47:51] this he said there can't be a flea bad
[2:47:54] its eyes but what he
[2:47:58] knowed every blink on the eye of a
[2:48:02] flea God knows it do you think he lost a
[2:48:04] storm you think he didn't know what to
[2:48:06] do with Helen do you think Helen
[2:48:11] careful he
[2:48:14] careful I heard people say we ought to
[2:48:16] put another l in that and make it from
[2:48:18] hell you can spell it any way you want
[2:48:20] to and say anything you want to say but
[2:48:22] the reality is he is omnipresent he is
[2:48:24] omniscient he is omnipotent he is
[2:48:27] infinite he is almighty God if he would
[2:48:30] wanted to take out the Eagles Refuge
[2:48:31] Campground he could he would if he wants
[2:48:35] to in the future he
[2:48:40] will if he wanted to take your roof he
[2:48:43] would
[2:48:44] have somebody said I just don't believe
[2:48:47] this kind of it doesn't matter what you
[2:48:48] believe matters is what the word said
[2:48:50] you can't have it both ways I refuse to
[2:48:53] call myself a servant of a God who is
[2:48:57] less powerful than what he
[2:49:03] created he created the
[2:49:07] devil the Bible said he created evil for
[2:49:12] his
[2:49:14] purpose the Bible said he didn't just
[2:49:16] make light
[2:49:19] he made the darkness
[2:49:22] too and he uses it to turn people toward
[2:49:25] the light God uses Darkness to turn
[2:49:29] people toward the
[2:49:33] light he allows evil to turn people
[2:49:38] toward that which is
[2:49:42] right he harnesses your problems your
[2:49:47] trials and uses them to bring you closer
[2:49:50] to him
[2:49:52] yes there's not a flea that bats his eye
[2:49:55] I'm closing now rather
[2:49:59] shortly there's not a flea that bats his
[2:50:01] eye but what he knowed and he knowed
[2:50:03] before there was a world how many times
[2:50:07] B oh oh if that thing just if that thing
[2:50:12] just goes off a little to the west or if
[2:50:14] it goes off a little to
[2:50:16] the east or
[2:50:22] God Did It God's in
[2:50:30] it the reason why one of the things that
[2:50:33] helps me to know that people don't know
[2:50:35] they don't even know what God's capable
[2:50:38] of is all these people said we didn't
[2:50:41] expect it to come to our area no one
[2:50:42] told us it was coming to our area nobody
[2:50:45] warned us nobody saw this somebody did
[2:50:51] I know this
[2:50:53] sounds too cut and
[2:50:55] dry but I knew if I didn't bring it cut
[2:50:58] and dry you wouldn't hear
[2:51:00] it you're not really used to a lot of
[2:51:02] sugar coating
[2:51:05] anyway you may not have known it but God
[2:51:07] did from the beginning and let me tell
[2:51:09] you something when he gets in a storm
[2:51:12] woo when the real storm you know
[2:51:16] Wrangler gets in he just rods it
[2:51:18] wherever it needs to
[2:51:23] go somebody said yeah but everything's
[2:51:26] flooded let me tell you something
[2:51:28] there's a great big God sitting on top
[2:51:30] of that
[2:51:30] flood ain't that what the word
[2:51:33] [Music]
[2:51:34] said when the enemy comes in like a
[2:51:37] flood yes God raises up a standard
[2:51:39] against him isn't that what the
[2:51:41] scripture said God's on top of it if he
[2:51:45] didn't instigate it he wrote it in
[2:51:49] yeah didn't catch him by
[2:51:52] surprise one
[2:51:54] more this happens to be from the church
[2:51:57] ages the exposition of the church ages
[2:52:00] the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[2:52:02] you are the thoughts of God Eternal if
[2:52:04] you can see this you will see many
[2:52:06] things God is unchangeable in both
[2:52:08] Essence and behavior we have studied
[2:52:10] that and proven that
[2:52:12] already God is infinite in his abilities
[2:52:16] so therefore he is as God must be
[2:52:20] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[2:52:23] is not now learning nor is he taking
[2:52:27] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[2:52:31] any time adding to his knowledge if he
[2:52:35] can add to his knowledge then he is not
[2:52:42] omniscient if he is omniscient he is not
[2:52:46] now learning
[2:52:50] ain't that
[2:52:51] powerful the best we could say is that
[2:52:54] sometime he will be but that is not
[2:52:58] scriptural he is omniscient he has never
[2:53:01] had a new
[2:53:05] thought about anything because all his
[2:53:09] thoughts he has always
[2:53:11] had and always will have and knows the
[2:53:15] end from the beginning
[2:53:23] because he is
[2:53:24] God Stacy walks into the room last night
[2:53:27] and she said we ought to pray she said
[2:53:29] we ought to pray because she said
[2:53:31] Heather and Dwayne are without power and
[2:53:33] the parents without power and uh Dwayne
[2:53:37] is on a CPAP machine and he can't sleep
[2:53:39] without it and uh and and uh the the
[2:53:42] business is the Shop's okay it's up up
[2:53:44] on the hill but between here and can't
[2:53:46] get to it and and so many things like
[2:53:49] that and it oh it just gets me I I feel
[2:53:53] so terrible for people that I
[2:53:56] love not to have power and they've just
[2:53:59] got a message that said it could be up
[2:54:02] to a
[2:54:04] month that's what she came in and told
[2:54:07] us and I said the reality is this was
[2:54:10] the words that came out of my mouth the
[2:54:12] reality is God is
[2:54:15] Sovereign and he gets the last
[2:54:22] sa how how many minutes was it
[2:54:25] honey not even 10
[2:54:29] minutes she calls back on the broken
[2:54:31] signal and Stacey's trying to make out
[2:54:34] what she saiding and she saiding you all
[2:54:35] won't believe this the power just came
[2:54:39] [Music]
[2:54:41] on God did that for them
[2:54:49] their supper looked better than
[2:54:51] mine they cooked on the grill made
[2:54:54] cornbread on the
[2:54:56] grill my children brought me a
[2:54:58] quesadilla from Taco Bell and if
[2:55:00] anybody's ever had that you know that
[2:55:02] ain't
[2:55:05] food and Dwayne and Heather of there
[2:55:08] eating cornbread made on the grill but
[2:55:11] their life was affected their children
[2:55:13] were affected their church was affected
[2:55:16] and I understand that and it makes makes
[2:55:18] me feel terrible that they had to go
[2:55:21] through it but let me tell you something
[2:55:22] the Devil comes back and says it'll be a
[2:55:26] month and God said you don't understand
[2:55:29] I've got some children over here in Goan
[2:55:31] and I will decide I will I'm not going
[2:55:34] to put more on them than they're able to
[2:55:36] bear I'm not going to give my servant
[2:55:39] more than one or two nights without good
[2:55:41] rest I know how to turn there is a man
[2:55:44] in here
[2:55:48] that can turn on the
[2:55:51] lights so nobody had to ring their
[2:55:54] hands because God is
[2:56:01] Sovereign and he'll take care of
[2:56:04] his anybody with me I'm closing I've
[2:56:08] already said that but I'm going to
[2:56:09] finish this quote he's omniscient never
[2:56:11] had a new thought about anything all of
[2:56:14] his thoughts he's always had musicians
[2:56:15] are coming and always will have and
[2:56:17] knows the in from the beginning because
[2:56:19] he is God thus the thoughts of God are
[2:56:22] Eternal they are real they are not
[2:56:23] simply like a man with a blueprint he's
[2:56:26] drawn up and which one day will be
[2:56:28] translated into substance and form they
[2:56:30] oh my listen listen listen listen to the
[2:56:32] difference between my thoughts and your
[2:56:34] thoughts and God's
[2:56:37] thoughts I may have a thought and a plan
[2:56:39] and I may draw it out like brother gley
[2:56:41] Drew out the fellowship
[2:56:43] hall drew it out on the
[2:56:46] paper and showed it to me
[2:56:48] me that was his
[2:56:51] plan and in that original thought
[2:56:55] process because even though his faith is
[2:56:58] huge and he knows what God can do he
[2:57:02] didn't want to put an extra burden on
[2:57:04] this body and the original thought was
[2:57:07] we'll just for now for very temporary
[2:57:10] time we'll just leave the floor
[2:57:13] gravel then you start thinking about the
[2:57:16] fact that we have Elder
[2:57:19] people like
[2:57:20] [Music]
[2:57:24] me who sometimes stumble around with
[2:57:27] their
[2:57:29] feet sometimes I
[2:57:32] misstep my right leg is a little weaker
[2:57:35] than the left leg because of surgery and
[2:57:38] and and and I'm a little bit like a
[2:57:40] wobble I've got a lot here around the
[2:57:41] middle and sometime I can lose my
[2:57:44] balance and there are others that have
[2:57:46] more serious problems than I do and we
[2:57:49] don't want to pick people bloodied up
[2:57:51] off the floor and if God said I you know
[2:57:54] this is a way to have fellowship and and
[2:57:56] brother gedy could draw it up and put
[2:57:57] the walls in and the door in and
[2:57:59] everything else and then God had a
[2:58:01] bigger plan he had a bigger plan he had
[2:58:04] a bigger plan no one was trying to unell
[2:58:06] you know brother gy you know him you
[2:58:09] know that in no
[2:58:11] way but he didn't want to come up here
[2:58:14] and say we got to have a conqu you know
[2:58:17] this was just a why he didn't even know
[2:58:20] what my reaction would be I was already
[2:58:24] uh at one point wondering what are we
[2:58:25] going to do I feel like that God is
[2:58:29] changing the direction of that building
[2:58:31] but I didn't know what it was all
[2:58:34] about but God did he knew how to put
[2:58:37] that in his somehow the Lord had
[2:58:40] different thoughts you can have a
[2:58:42] thought you can draw it
[2:58:43] up but your thoughts are just that
[2:58:46] thoughts
[2:58:49] but look what he says one day will uh
[2:58:51] like a man they are not simply like a
[2:58:53] man with a blueprint he has drawn up in
[2:58:55] which one day will be translated into
[2:58:56] substance and
[2:58:59] form what a thought what a thought but
[2:59:02] they are
[2:59:03] already they
[2:59:07] are
[2:59:09] real and
[2:59:12] eternal and part of
[2:59:16] God thank you have you ever changed your
[2:59:18] mind about a thought you had God
[2:59:23] hasn't his thoughts are already Eternal
[2:59:26] they're already real they're already in
[2:59:30] substance somebody said wait a minute
[2:59:32] wait a minute wasn't there a Prophet
[2:59:34] that that prayed and changed the mind of
[2:59:38] God and if that happened like that in
[2:59:41] the old test didn't God have to say wait
[2:59:43] a minute I'm going to change oh no
[2:59:46] folks let's go back first further than
[2:59:48] that when God put Eve in
[2:59:50] Adam before he ever pulled her out he
[2:59:54] knew she would be the
[2:59:57] one before Judas was ever given the job
[3:00:00] of being the treasurer for the Lord's
[3:00:02] holy band God already knew he'd be the
[3:00:05] one that would sell him
[3:00:09] out are you with
[3:00:11] me God knew what Adam would do because
[3:00:15] he put in Adam the heart of a redeemer
[3:00:17] yes
[3:00:19] God knew God knew God knew God knew God
[3:00:23] knew the church at large would not
[3:00:25] receive the message to prepare the
[3:00:29] bride God knew that even in the last of
[3:00:32] the last days there would be those who
[3:00:34] would rise up to try to
[3:00:37] discredit the message that God
[3:00:41] sent to prepare the bride God knew God
[3:00:44] knew it he knew it he knew who would
[3:00:46] fall off he knew what they would say he
[3:00:49] knew the accusations they would
[3:00:52] make oh yes and at the end of their
[3:00:56] research they may find that the servant
[3:00:59] of the Lord was not
[3:01:02] infallible but they will certainly find
[3:01:05] out that the God who sent him
[3:01:09] was if you don't already know it I'm
[3:01:11] quite sure you do your pastor is very
[3:01:15] very much fallible
[3:01:19] not at all infallible but the God who
[3:01:22] sent
[3:01:23] [Music]
[3:01:24] him is fallible he is
[3:01:31] infallible he has does not have the
[3:01:33] ability to fail cannot fail so God what
[3:01:37] you're doing in me let's stand what you
[3:01:41] we don't have to sing this I just wanted
[3:01:42] to refer back to it what you're doing in
[3:01:44] me is is not just to get me through the
[3:01:49] day it's not just to get me through the
[3:01:52] week the squeeze that I feel is for
[3:01:57] eternity what you're doing come on now
[3:02:01] unless you're going out if you're
[3:02:02] staying in stay with me for just a
[3:02:06] moment what you're doing in my life is
[3:02:09] not just to get me through
[3:02:11] Monday it's for
[3:02:13] eternity Lord if you're squeezing my job
[3:02:17] situ ation it's not just for now you are
[3:02:21] working something out in
[3:02:23] me for Eternal
[3:02:28] purposes if you're changing my
[3:02:32] address it's not just for
[3:02:35] now it's because you're working
[3:02:37] something
[3:02:40] Eternal if you're turning a
[3:02:43] storm you're doing it not just for now
[3:02:48] you're working something out right far
[3:02:52] more eternal yes we surrender hello we
[3:02:57] surrender to your will we surrender to
[3:03:02] your plan we surrender to your
[3:03:06] sovereignty You Are God Alone yes are
[3:03:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:03:18] when the storm hit Florida in the Big
[3:03:23] Bend of Florida where so many have come
[3:03:28] and where they predict there will be
[3:03:29] even perhaps another one before the
[3:03:31] season ends could come right up through
[3:03:34] the through the same
[3:03:37] place just after I was standing on the
[3:03:41] balcony a light rain and a gentle breeze
[3:03:44] and God's holy ghost had me declaring
[3:03:48] out that only his purposes we had no
[3:03:51] idea where it was going we had no idea
[3:03:53] where it would land where it would stall
[3:03:56] what would happen it was truly my desire
[3:04:00] to see it cross the State of Florida and
[3:04:02] be finished in the
[3:04:04] Atlantic but that wasn't God's
[3:04:08] plan and I'm standing there and all he
[3:04:10] would have me to say and do was to F was
[3:04:13] to declare that only his purposes would
[3:04:17] be fulfilled in this and his goodness
[3:04:20] was being accomplished in Mercy Lord
[3:04:24] your goodness is being accomplished in
[3:04:28] Mercy only your purposes are going to be
[3:04:32] fulfilled in this you've got a church
[3:04:35] that needs to wake
[3:04:39] up it's high
[3:04:42] time you've got a yet a a people who
[3:04:45] must come into alignment not only with
[3:04:47] your purposes for our lives but your
[3:04:49] purpos is for the nation of
[3:04:57] Israel God has spoken to this nation
[3:05:00] multiple times and he has shown one
[3:05:04] natural disaster after another after
[3:05:08] another to the tune of what could now be
[3:05:11] three trillion dollar worth of damage
[3:05:15] repair and everyone all almost every one
[3:05:18] of those directly connected to a
[3:05:23] time that this nation was putting
[3:05:28] pressure on
[3:05:29] Israel to give
[3:05:33] up instead of
[3:05:35] standing to give
[3:05:37] up in the midst of
[3:05:41] War
[3:05:43] Hezbollah having backing from Iran
[3:05:48] who's a half an inch away from nuclear
[3:05:52] weaponry more areas of Israel being
[3:05:56] targeted by missile and by rocket than
[3:05:59] have ever it has never happened quite
[3:06:01] like this before in all of the dark days
[3:06:04] of
[3:06:05] Israel and in the midst of it all still
[3:06:09] nearly a hundred hostages either alive
[3:06:12] maybe some are
[3:06:14] dead being held in
[3:06:18] uh Dungeons and
[3:06:20] tunnels while
[3:06:25] politicians ask
[3:06:28] Israel to cease
[3:06:31] fire what kind of
[3:06:34] fool would cease fire when under such
[3:06:40] attack they didn't strike
[3:06:45] first and our nation has no right and
[3:06:48] neither does the United Nations have any
[3:06:50] right to ask them to stop
[3:06:55] short and in the very
[3:06:59] week the UN called an emergency
[3:07:03] session once again to denounce
[3:07:08] Israel to demand a
[3:07:12] ceasefire to call Israel the aggressor
[3:07:18] to claim once again a
[3:07:22] partide and
[3:07:26] genocide and it
[3:07:30] passes and God said go ahead I'm going
[3:07:33] to talk to you
[3:07:35] now you say wait a minute it wasn't
[3:07:37] America no but America has most pressure
[3:07:41] power right do you really think that
[3:07:45] Israel cares what you you know some
[3:07:49] little you know leftover country of the
[3:07:52] of the United Soviet Socialist Republic
[3:07:55] what they think about Israel but they do
[3:07:57] care they have to care what America
[3:08:01] thinks because of our
[3:08:04] supply for their
[3:08:08] survival but that vote it
[3:08:11] matters in God's
[3:08:14] heart because it reminds us of a day
[3:08:16] when sheep Nations will stand on one
[3:08:19] side and goat Nations will stand on the
[3:08:21] other side and the Shepherd in the
[3:08:24] middle judged according to how they have
[3:08:26] treated the Jewish
[3:08:28] people scripture I'm not just making
[3:08:31] this up out of the top of my head it
[3:08:33] matters to God and God said I'll do what
[3:08:37] I did I I I I Woke Up This Nation in
[3:08:43] Katrina the word of the Lord came right
[3:08:46] here except except it was in Columbus
[3:08:48] sister elreda was there there may be
[3:08:50] others here who were there and God said
[3:08:52] I will blow my breath Upon This
[3:08:57] Storm
[3:09:01] Katrina and it will stall and change
[3:09:06] directions we were slated to have a
[3:09:10] direct hit in
[3:09:13] Shore and God did exactly what he said
[3:09:16] he was going to do he breath breathed on
[3:09:17] that storm and if you if you don't
[3:09:20] believe it I can show you the literature
[3:09:22] the print outs of the Articles where
[3:09:25] scientists said we've never seen a storm
[3:09:28] stall in the manner that this one
[3:09:31] stalled and then turn
[3:09:36] counterclockwise for a direct hit on New
[3:09:41] Orleans and had that not happened Pat
[3:09:44] Ingram wouldn't have come to Faith to
[3:09:46] know the Lord in the message message of
[3:09:47] the hour to be baptized in the name of
[3:09:50] Jesus Christ had she not been displaced
[3:09:52] from Katrina never ended up of all the
[3:09:54] places she could have ended up she ended
[3:09:56] up here and you loved her and you
[3:09:58] accepted her with all of her
[3:10:01] idiosyncrasies and loved her and she
[3:10:04] loved you and God left her here to
[3:10:07] capture enough of the truth to be ready
[3:10:09] to meet the Lord and then he took
[3:10:12] her come
[3:10:14] on God had a plan Ben and I are standing
[3:10:18] in the store and this girl says I
[3:10:20] basically you're the only ones that's
[3:10:22] been here most of the day I've been here
[3:10:23] by myself since about 3:00 and she was
[3:10:25] tied in the middle and loose on both
[3:10:27] ends I just wanted to buy a little pair
[3:10:29] of sunglasses for my baby
[3:10:31] girl and she starts talking to us about
[3:10:34] Katrina of all things and she said would
[3:10:37] you believe that it was going to be a
[3:10:39] direct hit on this area and it was going
[3:10:41] to come right up through Alabama and
[3:10:44] right on up she said but it's stalled
[3:10:46] out there and turned directions and went
[3:10:49] straight I said yes ma'am I'd believe it
[3:10:51] and if I would have just had the want to
[3:10:52] get out of there so
[3:10:54] bad I'd have pulled up the prophecy on
[3:10:57] my phone you see the enemy tried to get
[3:11:01] in that and he said I'll just do what I
[3:11:02] want to do with it and God said oh no
[3:11:04] you won't I'll blow my
[3:11:10] breath see the enemy can whip up
[3:11:13] things but he can't change God's heart
[3:11:15] and mind for us you're going to make it
[3:11:19] you're going to make it all things work
[3:11:22] together for good you pray for your
[3:11:24] brothers and sisters who are still in
[3:11:26] the heat of this thing they're going to
[3:11:28] make it they're going to cling to the
[3:11:29] Lord and they're going to come out of
[3:11:31] this and God will render back to his
[3:11:33] people double that's how he
[3:11:35] works everything they lose he'll give
[3:11:38] them double back that's how God takes
[3:11:40] care of things if you get caught up in
[3:11:42] the middle of something God will help
[3:11:44] you he'll make a way where there's seems
[3:11:47] to be no way now we're going to leave
[3:11:49] here uh after we worship and we're going
[3:11:51] to worship him because he's Sovereign
[3:11:53] and we're going to say you're good
[3:11:55] God you are good and everything you
[3:11:59] [Music]
[3:12:05] do it broke my heart when they told me
[3:12:08] about Kate having this accident with his
[3:12:11] finger and basically blowing out the end
[3:12:13] of his finger and having to put in a
[3:12:16] splint and he had to take the splint off
[3:12:18] be able to play he wasn't sure that he'd
[3:12:19] be able to play
[3:12:21] today and it really bothered
[3:12:24] me just bothered me said Lord you know
[3:12:28] that things like that just ought not to
[3:12:30] have to
[3:12:32] happen isn't that how we
[3:12:34] feel but God had a reason yes we don't
[3:12:37] know what it
[3:12:39] is but God had a
[3:12:41] plan see it could have been his
[3:12:45] head could have been his
[3:12:47] neck could have been his
[3:12:49] back could have been his life but it was
[3:12:53] his
[3:12:54] finger if you'll let the Lord direct
[3:12:56] your thoughts and you'll look at life
[3:12:58] that way and realize that go I know it's
[3:13:00] horrible I know you've been through the
[3:13:02] most dark difficult things but oh how
