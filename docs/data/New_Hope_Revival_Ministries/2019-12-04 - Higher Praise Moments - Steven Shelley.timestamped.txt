[0:00] high praise is giving up above what you
[0:03] feel and what you see praise in God's
[0:13] house and out of God's house it's not
[0:16] just the responsibility of gratitude but
[0:18] it also becomes a weapon and we could
[0:21] talk all day long about scriptures in
[0:24] the Old Testament concerning Judah and
[0:27] concerning God's strategy to win a
[0:29] battle and how many of you know
[0:31] sometimes it has nothing to do with men
[0:33] it's military power it had nothing to do
[0:36] with strategic wisdom we're gonna meet
[0:38] it with worship and how many of you know
[0:41] every time we read of something like
[0:43] this happening in the Bible it brought
[0:45] such a confusion on the enemy he is not
[0:48] expecting you to give God exuberant
[0:52] praise in the heat of the battle he's
[0:55] expecting you to whine and moan and
[0:58] groan and lick your wounds but if you
[1:01] will resist the enemy and not let your
[1:04] circumstances affect your praise you'll
[1:07] absolutely Drive the enemy into
[1:10] confusion and not just your ordinary
[1:12] praise your weekly effort of praise but
[1:16] something above and beyond what you
[1:19] would normally give you send the message
[1:22] into that spiritual darkness you send a
[1:25] message that says I'm going to keep God
[1:28] forefront in my life
[1:31] and my focus is going to be on his
[1:33] goodness no matter what's going on
[1:35] around me praise creates an atmosphere
[1:37] for God's power to show up you need an
[1:41] example shackles fell off in the midst
[1:46] of praise prison doors automatically in
[1:53] the midst in the atmosphere of trees and
[1:57] it was high praise how do you know as
[1:59] high prints because it was praise that
[2:02] was not affected by what they were going
[2:05] through at the moment that's high praise
[2:07] high praise is getting up above what you
[2:11] feel and what you see and what you're
[2:14] going through and giving God not normal
[2:16] praise or your regular praise but high
[2:19] praise God I want to give you tipsy
[2:23] praise loaded praise I want to give you
[2:27] shrill praise come on I want to give you
[2:31] a sacrifice I want to raise up my praise
[2:34] we're praising the Lord because he's
[2:37] good because he's righteous come on
[2:40] because he's true and what happens is we
[2:44] just start amping it up a little bit you
[2:46] just start pushing a little harder
[2:48] because you begin to feel the lift and
[2:50] when you begin to feel the lift you push
[2:52] a little farther into high praise and
[2:54] then power begins to move come on it's
[2:57] it's like the power twins they're
[3:00] operating one off from after another
[3:02] high praise
[3:03] brings a demonstration of power power
[3:05] brings us into an atmosphere of higher
[3:07] praise and it just keeps moving
