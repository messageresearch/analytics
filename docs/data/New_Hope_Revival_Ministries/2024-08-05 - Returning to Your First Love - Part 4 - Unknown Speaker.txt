[Applause] Hallelujah isn't he wonderful today aren't you glad you're in the house of the Lord wouldn't you rather be here than the finest Hospital in America or or the most lavish prison in America aren't you glad you can be here in fact there's nowhere that I would rather be this morning than right here in the presence of the Lord anybody would choose this over the hospital or a prison but I choose it over everything I'm where I need to be and where I want to be and where I desire to be I just don't have a song in me Ben but thank you for for asking would you give these uh wonderful gifted anointed Chosen and appointed musicians agre great hand we appreciate them we thank God for them they give their talent and their gifts to the Lord and they and we are the beneficiaries uh of their yielded to the Lord we're blessed because of them and because of how God uses them there's only one thing I long for and that is if I could take Cade and his gift home with me all the time and so if I could just have a CD uh uh a a of his singing and playing it would be a great benefit and blessing in my life I'm looking forward to a time that we might be able to have something like that um because I think it would be a little awkward If he if he came and played the piano in my bedroom while I sleep I think that'd be that'd be a little awkward but uh you know what I mean there's just there just certain sounds and certain things that unlock things in us and uh we're not all attracted to the same sounds and that's okay there's nothing wrong with that but God knows exactly what it takes to unlock the gifts that are in your life and that's the atmosphere you want to get in you want to find yourself in an atmosphere that calls forth the seeds of your destiny you don't want to sit on a pew and rot away you want to find a place that challenges you and unlocks the gifts that are in your life and ultimately the choice is yours you make the choice isn't that right uh you may be seated just a moment if you don't mind to to stand in in a in a moment or two when we read the word we're so glad to have you today uh we are uh so blessed that you have sacrificed to come and we don't we don't take it for granted that you would make this sacrifice as some leaving out two and 3 in the morning to get here and sleeping on mattresses and making sacrifices to to be with us and we get to go home to our comfortable beds and uh some people you know are just camping out but we're just so blessed and so thankful and we're going to do this again in October uh someone pulled the Ates for me would you I don't have it is it 15th through the 20th is that right October 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 I'm sorry but that already makes me tired we will be gathered here for our annual camp meeting and we're believing that the place will be full not only of hungry hearts and Believers but we believe the Heavenly Host will crowd in with us as well and uh I believe when we sing those words it reminds us Angels descending bringing from above we we don't worship angels we don't pray to angels we don't commission Angels but we are thankful oh so very thankful if we never see an angel it doesn't make any difference whether you see him feel them smell them sense them I don't care it's knowing by faith according to the promise of the word that you never go without them they're there he said he would give his angels charge over us to keep us and to protect us they not only go to church with us but they go to town with us and they go to work in the field with us or on the job I'm thankful that we are well covered and protected amen and sometimes it's just good to be reminded uh there are a number of Heavenly Host all kinds of divisions of the Angelic that we will only understand in in their fullness when we stand where they stand in the presence of the Lord they're very interested in what's going on in your life and their fact there's a they struggle just a little bit because the Bible tells us they long they long they look for the understanding that you have you know I don't want to call it jealous but they're they're they're a little stirred up because you carry a revelation that they don't carry you've got something angels have desired to have you you the word has been unlocked for you it isn't that a blessed thing Jesus is no longer standing behind a lattice and you're just catching little little pieces of him but he has now made himself fullface known to his little bride and we're learning of him oh my don't don't get to the place where you think you know it all and you don't need to keep learning of him we're told that even in eternity he will continue to unveil himself woo that's a multifaceted God that it would take all of eternity for us to learn of him to know his ways and to know who he is we're not just in love with what he does we're in love with who he is he is faithful in and true in every way uh we want to just mention a few uh little things here the birthdays for the week of the local assembly like we would normally do on a Sunday uh brother Billy is today would have been your mom's birthday well I I don't have to say this every time but I don't believe in Heavenly birthdays but we will remember her here remember that on this day many years ago she was born now she has made the Great Escape From Time how would she find her birthday in eternity you know and a and and where would she get the calendar because that is eternity there oh Hallelujah but we like to remember that her life made a difference in our lives not just of course she certainly made a difference in Billy's life she brought him here by the grace of God but she made a difference in our lives as well tomorrow uh is is a special birthday uh and it is Marybeth Marybeth hawken's birthday uh we are blessed because of her because of who she is her gift has ministered to us so many times through the years and we have watched her grow uh in Grace and years and uh now uh this Icelandic Viking that she's married to and these three amazing sharp redheaded children and uh I love them all but I'm especially thankful for Mary Beth I really really am and so just really want to give God praise for her life and uh she has like all of us made sacrifices along the way to be where she is today and you can never outgive the Lord you you never can and tomorrow is Sister Teresa's excuse me Tuesday the day after Monday Tuesday is Sister Teresa's birthday and she's a mother to many and uh she is not only a mother to her natural-born children but she has a number of stepchildren that she's a mother to and then she has uh son in loves or or daughter how however that works uh I I hate to say in-laws Outlaws but her children have spouses and she mothers them and uh I'm thankful for their life I'm thankful that they're here and I'm thankful that they add to this body uh really add to this body and when they all decide to go on vacation together we feel it we're a third empty and we miss them and yet you know in some situations when there's a family so big in a church that family tries to run the church or push the pastor or uh threaten him you know and they've never done anything of the sort they've just they've just served and I'm so thankful for them and on Wednesday of this week we have just remembered our brother uh Benny West his his uh birthday if he would have remained here with us but uh he also left us to another land and this coming week on Wednesday brother and sister West would have an anniversary sister West will still remember that day they were married in 1955 if I've done the math right that means that if he would have lived they would have had 69 years together on this Earth I know she still misses him extremely so but she's just closer we're all just closer to Eternity where we'll be together forever and ever and uh then on Friday of this week uh my grandmother that I remember so much her her gift of faith she taught me to have a prayer life and how important it was to have a prayer life and I often look down at Elana and I think oh I wish my big mama was here that's what I called her I wish my big mama was here to see this sweet baby girl uh perhaps she looks over the balcony of heaven and I know that she's getting anxious for me to come and I'm getting anxious to go oh yes I have just about more over there than we have over here and it's real it's real I'm so thankful that the enemy has not been successful in trying to talk us out of our our revelation of Eternity it's real it's more real than the realm we're living in right now more real than the realm we're living in right now now so would you stand and let me read the word of God uh into your life and uh thank you for your patience last night and I I have had some good testimonies this morning already that some have found a breakthrough in their life I'm I'm always thankful when I hear that some people almost apologize for saying it and they say you know I I know I've said before that I've had a breakthrough but but I've really had a break I'm just going to thank God you had one every time there's just lots of things to get through the enemy is constantly laying a ceiling over your head he's always building something over you and you're breaking through it Hallelujah I feel sorry for people that don't understand how important it is to create an atmosphere for him to come in with their praise if I I as we were worshiping the Lord it just made me want to I wanted something to pour out I wished I would have had something literal that I could have just poured out on him I do but that's not how it works it's our love and our praise and our worship and our adoration that we pour out on him we're anointing his feet do you know it's important to anoint him with your praise with your tears with your with your Thanksgiving more than anything else in this hour we want to keep our Spirits right oh yes you can have the right Doctrine and have a wrong spirit and miss your visitation so you want to ask the Lord daily Lord keep my spirit right help me renew in me uh a right spirit and and he will doesn't he do it isn't he faithful okay uh in Exodus chapter 34 would you go back there with me today let me read these uh three verses and then I will very soon take us in a slightly different direction we are still remembering this word of Our Lord that our love grows cold because iniquity abounds and we want to warm it up we we really want to have a love affair with Jesus Christ there's so many things vying and fighting for our attention and we want him to be our number one in in every situation is that right and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord the the yod V the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and true I I want us to do that quickly again the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and Truth he never runs out Hallelujah we could never exhaust his supply thank you Jesus keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty that means you've got to do something to initiate the clearing repentance visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation now that's just the word of the Lord Romans 23 for all all have sinned for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God how many of you know all means all that's all father we are grateful that your presence surrounds us even now and we thank you that every Spirit every demonic power is subject to the authority of Jesus Christ in the lives of the Believers and we take that right now we take spiritual jurisdiction we take spiritual jurisdiction over this house in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a and we demand that every opposing Spirit bow to his authority in the life of the believer you will neither distract or dissuade your your sting is taken from you and you must leave this atmosphere for the glory of God to fill the house there's no room for anything else other than the light of God's truth so we ask that you help us now to use the gift of faith that you've given to every man that we could pull on the word pull on the gift of God in this house that you might speak to us that you might give us both answers and correction that you might would bless us and challenge us Lord Jesus we submit uh to the word of God that it would just come and surgically improve who we are cutting out what is what is foreign what is a trespassing Spirit cutting it out the root of all bitterness cutting it out so that the healing bomb of Gilead and the life of the Lamb could come and fill in every void Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord I pray right now that any void that has been created because we repented of generational iniquity last night any void any empty spot we pray right now that the holy spirit of God would rush into that place in us to the inner recesses of the Hidden man and that you would expand Who You Are we give you full sway we give you full Dominion Lord over all of our Lives we Grant you permission it's what you told us really scripturally we must do we Grant you permission to come and take up full Abode in our lives have your way Lord we turn our stopwatches off and we say come and have your way so that when we leave here today we don't leave here like we came but we leave here better off and Fuller of your glory truth and we'll give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah that we pray and the Saints of the most high God said amen so be it you may be seated may the Lord bless you uh in a mighty mighty way God is good to us isn't he so we we spoke last evening extensively on the different applications of sin that are outlined for us in the Bible sin being almost a surface uh a marring of the surface and we we pray and we it can even be a one-time thing we pray we we repent we ask for forgiveness the blood comes the the sin is B Ed the sin is covered and it's as though we can just wipe it off because the penalty has already been uh paid the price The Ransom is paid now when we don't do anything about our unbelief it moves deeper into the recesses of who we are and it changes Us in sort of a way that we start making decisions and choices we we start Mak making room for our sin instead of making room for our savior and that means that it takes a deeper hold in our life and we call that transgression and that transgression is a willful act it's you know I know what you said I know what is right and you you would think that nobody would have such an attitude especially in this house but but yet people get that attitude to I know what's right I know what I ought to do but I'm going to do what I will you see it's not even that that every man is doing what's right in his own eyes that's out there but but in here we know better that's right you see you'll never be able to make your excuses before the Lord because you know better once your eyes have been enlightened once you have partook of that Heavenly gift once the blood of Jesus has been applied to your life in truth you can never claim ignorance again well I didn't know they say well I didn't know yes you knew yes you knew so mark this down whatever befalls your life whatever comes in the future just remember you were marked with a price the price of the High Calling of Jesus Christ and you can't invent your own faith you can't invent your own way to approach God if if you're going to approach him in worship or in the word there's only one way to do it and that's in spirit Spirit and in truth and we've got to have them both you see they're not Polar Opposites of one another you see really we could say that that word that went out from the logos we could call that spirit because it was Spirit originally but it went out as a as a word a decree a declare h a declaration from the Lord so it's not as though it's something entirely different they work together because the essence of them is the same word and spirit and and without both you've just got some substitution somewhere and it may appease your conscience but we're going to find out one day when we stand before him we have no excuse we have no excuse well somebody hurt my feelings well you're not alone in that well my parents didn't do everything right well you're not alone in that well I got looked over on my job well you're not alone in that you see anything you've walked through somebody else has walked through a pretty dark road too so we just know that it's by grace that any of us yes could get up above our stuff to get into the presence of the Lord amen the devil will try to make you think the grass is greener over on somebody else's lawn should I tell a story should I tell a granny story I've told it before it's not in the notes but my grandmother you know you remember what happened in my family oh so many years ago on a Christ Christmas Eve when the presence of God unannounced no one was praying but the Holy Ghost came in that big old farmhouse uh down near Highway 10 and between kton and clo Alabama just came in like a fire of God and people were slain out in the floor as the spirit of God showed up and my grandmother testified and I was able to meet some of those nieces and nephews now grown married and had children of their own who come up off the floor speaking in tongues and had never been in a Pentecostal service in their life had never seen it and you've heard me tell about my my grandmother's brother-in-law who was a Baptist preacher who took every opportunity that he had to tell people there's n no such thing there's nothing to speaking in tongues it it's it's of the devil it's not of God God and uh he always wanted to pick a fight or pick an argument with anybody anywhere that that had any connection to to Holiness people or Pentecostal people but when the spirit of God fell he he changed his mind in a hurry and my great grandmother Lizzy who had been told you can't pray unless you enter into a closet but there were no closets in her country Farmhouse there were only chifferobes or wardrobes you know pieces of furniture homemade and she said I can't get in there so I must not be able to pray she was that plain that simple that she thought if I can't shut the door I can't pray she didn't understand it was a door of her heart but when the Holy Ghost fell she went running through the house clapping her hands and she was screaming I wasn't even praying and he reached down and saved me and coming along behind her was my was my grandmother's brother-in-law who said there's nothing to this Holy Ghost he was running right behind grandmother clapping his hand saying people this is real people this is real people this is real you see you've just got to have an encounter with the real well well preacher don't you know there's a lot of fanaticism out there I do a lot of counterfeit out I do I know there but because there's counterfeit it reminds me that there is also a genuine praise be to God you you can't counterfeit a dollar bill if there's not a good one somewhere for you to make a copy of so it doesn't matter to me about the fanaticism of denominational Pentecost Etc I can't help what has happened or what will happen in the future but I know that I know that I know that I know so it wasn't too long that one of my grandmother's sisters she got slack because remember in that service that night the Holy Ghost gave a message in Prophecy my grandmother was laying on her back under the power of God and a prophecy came out of her mouth and said build me a church on Highway 10 and call it Shiloh and I will meet my people there powerful it wasn't in anybody's mind to do such a thing as that but the church was built a brush Arbor first and then a church and the whole family came and all the neighbors came and it wasn't long before the brush Harbor wasn't big enough and they added on to the brush Harbor and finally built the block Church uh that has been remodeled and sits there on the highway today just like it did back then but it wasn't long before one of my grandmother's sisters she had 15 brothers and sisters and one of the sisters got slack and just decided that she she would just talk to the Lord on her front porch and she didn't have to come to church to to be with God she she could just sit right on her porch on a Sunday and and be right with God and my grandmother would say to her uh uh I'll come and pick you up you won't even have to run out your gas but I really want to see you in the house of the Lord you'll gain so much strength if you come in fellowship with brothers and sisters of like faith and she began to make excuse after excuse after excuse and finally she said well Mildred I can't come to church I bought me a cow my grandmother said sis half the church members have cows and their cows don't keep them from church oh she said this cow of mine I I it keeps getting out and she said I I can't afford for it to get out and eat the neighbor gladiolas so she said I've got to sit home and watch that cow and and week after week my grandmother would stop to take her to church and she'd be sitting there in her in her house coat she said I can't go mild I got to watch my cow got to watch my cow my grandmother said one day she heard that till she thought she would just be sick and she spun around she was on the way to the car and she spun around and she said sister I tell you what if you don't quit making excuses God will take your excuse she said I didn't even know I was saying such a thing as that she said I didn't intend to I wasn't mad I'd come to I'd come to understand she just wasn't going but she said it must have been some inspiration to just come pouring out of my mouth so you know they didn't all have telephones so she didn't hear from her through the week but next Sunday she said I think I'll I'll stop and see if she'll go to church with me this morning she she said I pulled in and there she stood she'd already come down off the porch and was standing there on the little walkway ready to get in had her purse under her arm she said uh oh you're going to church with me this morning and she said I sure am and I'm going next Sunday too and the Sunday after that fact she said when the doors open from here on out I plan to be there if God will be my help so as they drove on to church she said mild you'll never believe what happened you had not been gone from here but a few minutes she said I am sitting here watching my cow she said every move she made I watched her I don't know how many times I had seen her stick her head through the wire to get the grass on the other side of the fence she said every day dozens of times she would work her way down that fence stick her head through the wire and get her some grass to chew on because they had kind of finished up what was on that side of the field she said but this day last Sunday I watched her do what I had seen her do dozens of times before she she moved down just a little bit she reached her head through the wire and she said I don't know what happened it was as though somebody took the cow and flipped her over she said she must have stumbled but I didn't really see her stumble I just saw her flip and there she lay she said I went out and she had broke her neck in the fence wire the same little place and she said I had to call the neighbor to come and put her out of her misery I couldn't stand to see her suffer like that she said and Mild it's your fault you owe me a cow because you said if I didn't quit making excuses God would take my excuse did you get the point he knows how he knows how so we we were talking last night about that generational iniquity and how how it comes down and I read you two quotations in the end from Brother brandham Where he talked about the sickness that has come on you it's because of sin but it may not be your sin at all it may be the sin of your father it may have come down through the generations and uh there's a remedy for it praise the Living God but but you may not understand it because you you know you're not guilty of something like that I I want to to give you these verses this morning Leviticus chap 26: 40-42 this is the answer this is the remedy you can get out from under the burden of the past are you listening it says and this is the new verse that I that I uh uh that I gave you I think if they shall confess their iniquity and someone say and that's a conjunction we're joining two thoughts together and the iniquity their so if they shall confess their iniquity the deep-seated iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed because remember sin was strengthened unbelief was strengthened until willful sin became a trespass and trespass was left unrepented of until it rooted itself as an iniquity that would not not only affect you as an individual but generations to come if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me Hallelujah verse 41 and and that I have also excuse me and that I also have walked contrary unto them and brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised Hearts be humbled listen now and they even accept of the punishment of their iniquity that means they're they're willing to say oh god there may be there may be some consequences involved in this I'm sorry but there may be some consequences sometimes involved in these decisions to let these things go he said if they'll do all of that then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob and also my Covenant with Isaac and also my Covenant with Abraham will I remember and I will do what a nation needs to hear this today and I will remember the land God's made a promise if he made it for natural Israel he made it for Spiritual Israel you understand that don't you you're not just maybe you're not the natural Seed of Abraham but thanks be to God we're of the royal Seed of Abraham so if we're willing to own the past and repent of the past then we can receive the benefit of full Redemption and on top of that not only do we stop passing down that deep rooted desire and predisposition toward addictions and lust and things of that nature but now we have the ability to pass down a generational blessing that benefits the Next Generation and the Next Generation and the next generation are you still with me so I want to illustrate that for you in the message before we move on in the message the baptism of the Holy Spirit pull with me now this is vital for us to to get through this uh in in the baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958 he said as we were speaking to pick up the little subject again just for a minute how the illegitimate child could not enter the kingdom for 14 Generations 400 years and how that the iniquity of the parents was visited to the children to the third and the fourth generation now remember that brother brandham explains to us that there is a breaking that takes place in that under the New Covenant thanks be to God thanks be to God you see we're not looking to join a natural priesthood we're looking to be a part of a spiritual priesthood and so he goes on in in this and he said also listen also the righteousness of parents was visited he said what you do if there is coming tomorrow and you have a great grandson listen your action today will determine what he'll be then so it's not just iniquities that can be passed down in generational lines but also blessings and and faithfulness and the characteristics of a dedicated Christian I'm up here the characteristics of a dedicated Christian can also be passed down from generation to generation to generation oh come on now because remember these things affect not only our spiritual life life but we learn by science that our DNA and our RNA is also affected both by iniquity and by righteousness by godliness oh my my my my my that ought to cause every one of us to embrace that promise and do everything we can to reverse the curse and to put something on the Next Generation that will cause caus them to run harder after God than you and I have run after him is that possible it is it is he said so what you do if there is coming tomorrow and you have a great grandson your action today will determine what he'll be then for we read in the Bible MDC when he met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth a tithing of all that he had remember and then he said that of tithings that just only Levi would accept tithe but he said Levi who received tithes paid tithes when he was yet in the loins of Abraham Levi wasn't a son of Abraham he was several Generations removed and God credited to Levi's Grace account when Abraham was faithful to give God his portion oh my not getting too much help but I'll go on anyway do you realize that when you keep Covenant with God you are setting up the Next Generation to receive the benefit of keeping Covenant with a God who cannot lie with a God who cannot miss his mathematics are impeccable and he keeps up with every seed we sow and it not only benefits our lives now but it has the spiritual benefit of blessing our children and our grandchildren and our great grandchildren so if you're living under the guilt of something that you carried and passed on remember there is redemption there is forgiveness by the blood of Jesus Christ and the curse can be reversed and you can pass on the favor and blessings of the Lord if my children can be predisposed genetically to my weaknesses then they can be predis exposed genetically to my strengths I'm looking at you cuz some of you are sleeping and that's okay I know you're tired but I I think you should hear this I really think you should hear this because I think we would not be so slack if we really kept in mind that what we do now is not only affecting now not only affecting us but it's sewing something into to the next what if they're already born well I want you to know what the blood can do the blood can rewire you now you just get the blood on your life and it can shift all kinds of things it can cause those negative dendrites to burn up in your mind and new holy thoughts to replace them my god get those negative thoughts out of my head and out of my children children's head and build new thoughts according to the word of God hallelujah strongholds pulled down and and towers of Truth raised up God he he has the power to to transfigure to to transplant to take out the old some of us have been building those trees in our brain for so long that we revisit them almost on a daily basis that old language of accusation that Satan has made against us and we revisit it and it gets stronger and stronger and every time we rethink those thoughts they are wired deeper and larger in the recesses of our brain and in our memory but if the blood of Jesus is an agent of full Redemption if he can turn everything back to the original form if he can take us back to God's original thoughts about who we are then he can take care of some ugly trees growing in your head we just need another bite like our brother was preach preaching exhorting us this morning we just need another bite to the Tree of Life anybody here yes sir good praise the Lord CU you don't get lunch until I'm done oh can you catch that brother brandom knocks on the pull pit five times I'm not sure why we needed to know that but we know it now Abraham was Levi's great grandson and here Levi at least eight or 10 hundred years later maybe several hundred I wouldn't know just what or how many but would have to figure it up through the generation but brother brandham knew that Levi was not a son of Abraham but Abraham begot Isaac and Isaac beg got Jacob and Jacob beg got Levi and here Levi Jacob would be his father Isaac his grandfather Abraham his great-grandfather and when Levi was in the loins oh my when Levi was in the loins of Abraham the Bible said he paid tithe to MDC the Bible said so that's not somebody's interpretation that's what the word said so you just remember that that you are positively affecting the Next Generation by keeping faithful Covenant with God not just in your giving but in your prayer life come on now and and in your desire to feed on spiritual things instead of fleshly carnal things by making good decisions now now one more one more place before we move into something else Hebrews in in the message Hebrews chapter 7 number one paragraph 161 your attitude your attitude toward Christ let's slow it down your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be you know it's powerful because it doesn't just have to be natural-born children because we're talking about a spiritual blessing now that transcends the natural come on your life that you live before your family will make an impression on on what your children will be if you're one of those people that that your first reaction to every bit of conflict is I'll just stay home I won't even go to church you know like you're like you're punishing who who are you punishing you you're trying to get me back by not coming well you know my brother sister The Joke is on you because you pay more than I do it's not really costing me anything but an amen and sometimes I just watch you sleep anyway when you come so that's all it's costing me is an amen so you're really the one that that is not going to benefit with that kind of attitude but listen if your children see you I've had it I've had them come to my office and tell me if your children see you treating the things of God like that before you know it when they've got a little conflict in their life they'll pout the same way that you pouted if you see that let let me just encourage you the next time God puts the mirror in your face and you see your negative way in your children he'll do it God will let you see it the next time you see your uh uh poor people skills or you see your emotions how your emotions lead you and you see your children being led by their emotion and you say uhoh now our first reaction is you're acting like your mother all daddies they just love that they just love that line they say to their wives you're acting like your mother they say to their children you're acting like your mother the reality is the mirror is turned and a lot of times we're seeing ourselves we don't like what we see in them and we don't like where it come from the next time that happens to you you ought to stop in that moment and say to your children I am so sorry amen that you have picked that up from me and I am going to believe the Lord to break the hold of that on both of our lives so that you can be set free to go higher than I've ever gone come on be more dedicated than I've ever been but if you keep sweeping that under the rug and you're not willing to accept your part of the responsibility blame it on on your mother-in-law see how quiet it is then you'll just then you'll just continue to pass on the negative I want to pass on oh my I want to be a worshipper let me give you an example I want to be a worshipper so that my children will catch that part of my DNA I sing God's praises to Elana every opportunity I can I sing over her I don't I mean I may not sing deep Myster songs of Revelation but I sing over her you know what I sing more than any song I Love Jesus better than ice cream ice cream's very good I love Jesus better than ice cream like I know I should even when I don't obey him or do all the things I should I love Jesus better than ice cream ice cream's very good and she does smile and she doesn't know that ice cream is good but her daddy will teach her before before too long as soon as he can I I I want her I I I and you know what I'm saying I I want to pass along somehow a desire to to to make Jesus the cner of everything because Oh my he ought to be he deserves to be he needs to be and I want to pass on to my children to to back the preacher I I'm going to say something a little self-serving here I want my children to know that that the gift of the preacher operates better in an atmosphere where there's a faith pool and a sium I want them to understand that because I'm not one who believes that sisters shouldn't say amen I believe sisters should say amen I believe they can say amen I believe they ought to say amen I I don't know how they can keep from saying amen because it's the same word that Witnesses in their heart amen they may not be as loud as some and and you know I sometimes people criticize because some people are just extra loud well you know what if you were if you were jumping in there you would know what someone else was doing in the first place I I want my children to know that the anointing is not dependent on their amen but their amen builds the atmosphere it causes others to start saying hey I better listen to that there's something here that might help me your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be cuz the Bible said that he would visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children to the third and the fourth Generations so it's not just the iniquity it's not just the negativity but it's also the positive oh God wire in them the hunger and the desire and help me to correct my own path now we're we're going to move we're still talking about the stronghold of cold love we're still talking about believing for God to warm us up in our love for him and and in our love for one another but I mentioned to last Sunday that I had had an experience with the Lord and in that experience there were there were three Spirits demonic spirits that were um emphasized to me that we as his bride would be contending with in this season of proving we're being tested we're not only being tested we're being judged right the bride is not judged at the great white Throne judgment the bride is judged now what her attitude toward the word is now is part of her judgment and how she deals with opposition now is part of her proving and her testing and her judgment by the time we get there we're going to sit with him amen hallelujah and according to the word judge angels and Nations the the three Spirits if you thank you you have them there three spirits that we must contend with in this season of proving you might want to write them down number one seducing spirits and those are lying Spirits yes sir they don't tell the whole truth ever you you may be shocked to find out out that you may be sitting on the Pew with someone who never tells and it's going to get very quiet I'm prepared I'm prepared never tells the whole truth about anything they they've been rewired they've been rewired they can't even tell a story without embellishing the story and if they're ever in a hot seat you can hardly find the truth in what they say I'm not just talking about babies and children either I'm talking about adults that have been rewired it's iniquity that has rewired us to the level that that it's easier for some of us to to tell a lie than to tell the whole truth and we have even colorcoded our lies you know it's not it's it's not a black lie I don't know what a black lie is it's just a little white lie maybe it's a mediumsized white lie maybe it's a big old fat juicy white lie how many of you would just think that a lie is a Lie Is A Lie is a lie and the Bible said all you're not helping me huh all liars will have their place in the Lake of Fire and so the enemy desires to battle the minds of the bride with seducing spirits and some of those seducing Spirits are lying spirits that want to warp our thought process so that we answer when asked with a lie instead of the truth number two religious Spirits religious spirits will operate through delusions you can be 100% sincere and 100% sincerely wrong so your sincerity is not the measurement of your honesty you may sincerely think that you're telling it like it is but you may be sincerely wrong and the enemy if he can slip a religious spirit in on you oh my and it manifest in all kinds of ways yes around the message you know it manifest like this oh my four they sang four four songs The Prophet said three songs to prepare our hearts for the preaching of the word I'm pretty sure there was four and even though they didn't stop they went right in number five you may find it hard to believe that there are people around this truth that are that religious and that dogmatic but I know some of them and if I called their name you would know some of them it really matters to them it reminds me of the story that brother Perry green told many many times through his life of being at the brandom Tabernacle just after church order was preached and he said literally people were so afraid because of what had been said they were so afraid that even in the service they would if they had to express something to someone they would mouth it because they didn't want the sound of their voice to disturb the atmosphere that brother Brandon was trying to create and preserve and so after the service this night brother Perry green grabbed a broom that's just who he was and he said I'm going to help the janitor clean up because their service again tomorrow and he said I was being so careful because of what I heard and the way I saw people responding to what was said that I made sure that the broom I want you to hear this Jennifer when you're sweeping you be careful that broom he said I didn't want the broom to to knock the Pew and make a loud noise in the sanctuary cuz that was a set aart place and he said so here I am you know brother green was a was a generous sized man and he said I'm trying to work myself between the narrow little pews with my broom and uh I just kind of you know and he he said all of a sudden brother brandom says Hey Brother Perry he said I look up and brother brandom is hanging out the study door yelling at me across the empty sanctuary and he said I said he said Hey Brother Perry he said what's that I can't hear you brother green started walking toward him he he said yes sir I I just didn't want to be loud in here oh he said I just wanted to know if you wanted to go to breakfast again in the morning brother green said I understood that there was a time and a necessity and a and a reason yes sir that no longer applied at the end it was actually okay I I could if I would have the Pew I wasn't going to run the angel of the Lord out of the house people can get so religious over and dogmatic do you know that old word dogmatic that they lose the joy and they lose the victory in trying to keep the rules don't you let a religious spirit get a hold of you because it's the worst kind of spirit to overcome and then number three he specifically highlighted for me familiar spirits which a lot of people don't really understand I want to take a few moments this morning to go through some of this with you and it won't be perhaps as easy as it was last night because you're you're a little tired and I get it I understand I I get it I understand I want you to understand for first of all that I if we as the bride deal with some of these kinds of spirits in our life that try to distract us we must understand that the scripture and the message has distinguished for us the difference between being demonically oppressed and being demonically possessed oppression is when a demon or an evil spirit seeks to affect or to control an individual from the outside possession is when a door has been opened and the demon Spirit has tried to come in and occupy an individual from the inside both are biblical and both are still uh around we still see the enemy working in these ways even in the hour that we're living in right now let let me show you a quote from aw toer it's a powerful quotation I hope you won't mind me sharing it comes from a book that toer wrote called Born after midnight it was on the notes from today the scriptural way to see things is to set the lord always before us are you here put Christ in the center of our vision right in the center and if Satan is lurking around how many of you think he probably is he will appear on the margin only and be seen as but a shadow yes on the edge of the brightness do you understand what that's saying it is always wrong to reverse this to set Satan in the focus of our vision and push God out to the margin we must never focus on the the darkness we must always focus on the light we don't deny that Darkness exists we don't deny that Satan exists we don't deny that demons exist but we're not looking to the demon we're not looking to Behold The Darkness we're looking to see Jesus in the center of everything and the Darkness is over here in the peripheral you understand he said don't ever do the reverse nothing but tragedy can come of such inversion the best way to keep the enemy out I'm going to get a little stirred here in a moment if you don't help help me I'm not doing this for my health I I it's very important here to learn how to keep the enemy out and here's how we keep the enemy out we keep Christ in I know the world kind of picks up on this old old book that was written in his steps and the modern Church world for a long time they were wearing little rubber bands and things that said wwjd what would Jesus do I don't think you ought to have to tattoo it on your arm to remember I think it's as Christians we ought to remember when we react and respond am I reacting and responding because I'm looking at Christ in the center of my vision or have I become distracted by something else that's going on and am I responding uh like Christ or am I responding like the darkness that's trying to squeeze Christ out of my life it's a good thing to ask ourselves sometime now look at this he said the best way to keep the enemy out is to is to keep Christ in it is not the praying sheep oh this is so good so good it is not the praying sheep that Satan fears I'm going to let you all do it a Praying sheep can accomplish a lot but our ultimate Victory is when we keep the shepherd near us and we do that by building an atmosphere that he's comfortable in so I I want to show you the difference here quickly in the message between oppression and and possession in the message being led of the holy spirit in Minneapolis brother brandham says this to a woman in the prayer line you believe lady if the Lord Jesus will let me know what you're here for will you accept him as getting what you're after you will you have many things one thing you have a colon trouble you have a gallbladder trouble and you're nervous that's right and and then one great thing that's bothering you is demon oppression you always feel depressed like the devil's got you or something like that you're having a spiritual battle aren't you is that true he asked her the question and especially you get that in the afternoon after the dinner or something like that in the afternoon it's worse than it is for morning that's right cuz it makes you all upset see what it is it's nervousness see it look like there's an enemy fighting at you can anybody relate to that do you believe that God sent me to cast it away from you you do come here brother bam said better bow your head listen at his prayer our heavenly father Satan here trying to come against your Holy Spirit why the evil one come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I adure Thee to leave her you're exposed Satan you go from this woman you're trying to make her commit suicide and you leave her in Jesus Christ name now look at here it's over now yeah you know it is is that right raise your hand if every worry is gone in that moment that may have been the absolute truth in that presence all of her worries were gone but she might have yet to have another battle or two with that spirit that was trying to oppress her he said you feel fine you're going to be all right so just go rejoicing and praising the Lord the Lord bless you thanks be to God and he goes on oh my how people ought to worship him give him praise he loves to be worshiped now be real reverent brother brandom goes from dealing with the woman's oppression to treating it like it is a possession because he said come out of her and we don't know uh this woman and we don't know exactly what her need was but it clearly indicates to me that a Believer even a believer can be oppressed of demonic spirits that torment the Mind brother bham said the greatest battle ever fought is fought on the Battlefield of the Mind it's the last battle for the bride when we come to the victory in this we have finished the testing period we have finished the proving period when we learn to think the thoughts of Christ and cancel the enemy's accusations we have overcome the last battle of our of our life it's over then and we step out of here not going anywhere until we can possess the thoughts of our own mind you're not going to be raptured until you can win the battle come on of your mind if the enemy can press a thought into your mind to take you out that's exactly what he will do but I tell you he is is defeated by the blood of the Lamb by the power of the revealed word by the name of Jesus Christ he is defeated he has been defeated a long time he is still defeated he'll be defeated tomorrow he'll be defeated when the when he's cast into that bottomless pit and he will ultimately be defeated on the other end of that when he is loose for a short season the reality is he is a created being who does not have eternal life I'm going to outlive the devil sir I'm going to outlive the enemy because I have grabbed a hold of Zoe life the life of God the only soul that live lives forever ever is the soul that has been possessed by the Zoe life of God the enemy knows that and so he can't change your destiny so he seeks to affect your relationship he seeks to cut off your fellowship from God he seeks to Circle you off like a weaker part of the fold if the enemy can separate you from the rest of the Sheep come on yeah you're a whole lot more vulnerable out there than you are in I want you to know sheep can fight for sheep you don't just need the shepherd you need some sheep that will fight for you you may not know it brother sister but there's some sheep in this house that know how to fight they know how to fight they know how to get a go hold of God you won't move them them they've been tested and tried in the furnace long before you run into them come on now some of us had a revelation from the Lord so long ago and it still lives and moves and breathes inside of us that nothing is going to move us cuz my soul doesn't hang over stories it's the word of Truth that keeps us going and that old Satan that old devil that Old Demon will try to oppress you and make you so nervous oh I just can hardly come to church and I'm so nervous don't you know that's exactly what the enemy wants to tell you is that you're just going to embarrass yourself when you get over here because you're so nervous so you're going to stay at home and watch the idiot box and that's going to calm down your nerves you're going to sit your children down in front of all that and that's going to calm your nerves you're going to spend all day long on believe the sign and that's going to calm your nerves let me tell you something that enemy will oppress you and oppress you and oppress you while looking for an opportunity to take you over he'll never be satisfied giving you the jerks he'll Trail you and track you and hunt you and somebody said well is there an answer it's so simple yes there's an answer greater greater greater is he that is in [Music] me than he that is in the world time tested Faith he said another thing you've been interested in a person you're praying for something it's a young man and that young man is bothered with spiritual trouble he's all nervous and just scared he's just mentally shook up it's demon oppression it's a demon Spirit from the outside trying to press watch the word oppression it's to press us has anybody ever experienced something from the outside a a a a spiritual Force Desiring to press you down to confine you listen to me now on to confine you he doesn't only want to confine you he wants to redefine you he wants to cause you to lose your true identity until you don't even know who you are it's a heart issue and if you can win the issue in your heart if you can surrender in the heart God will give you the victory over the pressure you you may not realize it but you were built to withstand the pressure of leoda you didn't come to Philadelphia you didn't come to thyra you didn't come to Smyrna you came to leod deia because God had pressurized you there is a bird that can go higher I'm a special built bird Hallelujah specially pressurized and I want you to know what I can do what you can do you can drop down that that eyelid that that uh uh there's two eyelids and that that eyelid can drop down you can see through it but uh uh for an eagle it acts like a sunglass almost like sunglasses and that eagle can can turn when he's being pursued he can not only fly higher but he can turn his face right toward the Sun and that little lens would can drop down over his eye and shut out the brightness of the light and he can fly straight to the sun I encourage you to hear what toer said I I encourage you to hear our example in the message of the hour I encourage you to turn your eye when the enemy is chasing you when he is trying to oppress you when he is trying to relabel and re-identify you I encourage you to turn your head toward the Sun and fly [Applause] higher sir you'll watch The Devil explode you'll watch him explode don't confuse emotion with an experience don't think because you had a feeling that you've had The Full Experience there's something deeper that takes place when you get that sealing of the Holy Ghost it comes in such a manner and it's so deep and so powerful that your emotions don't even have an opportunity to register what God is doing on the inside of you so you receive the final portion of the Holy Spirit without any sensation at all it comes so deep that it bypasses the soul it bypasses the mind and the will and the emotions oh yes and it connects with that part of him that's already in you come on nowall he's all nervous and scared he's just mentally shook up it's demon oppression when you go to him tell him not to worry cuz he's going to get over it and you're over yours now your faith has made you well God God bless you you believe him to be the Christ now you know that there has to be some kind of a supernatural being here now if you believe it's Christ now be real Reverend I believe I believe I believe I believe it was Christ then I believe it's Christ now I believe when we gather together in the name of the Lord the Lord is here he's with us I believe when we welcome the Heavenly Host they're here I believe that heaven is constantly trying to break through into this realm so that you and I can have an experience that's deeper than just a feeling or a goosebump or a hair standing up I want an inner transformation that's so genuine and so real and so powerful that it can defeat the enemy any time and anywhere and under any circumstances in the message demonology thank you for helping me a bit more I've often heard people say brother Brandon why don't you take the initiative side go right out there and just take the side and rebuke the enemy I was afraid to I maybe had seen something that I should not have seen and I do realize Friends With all sincerity that it's a drama a stage show it's not just a drama or a stage show we're in church and it's the power of almighty God and it's demon spirits that are on the people if I tell Christians that you know Christians don't want to hear it Christians you know people who identify as Christian they don't want to hear that they can have any kind of Torment of demon Spirits they certainly don't want to think about possession and they rarely want to think about oppression but that that Realm of Darkness is just as real as the realm of the light and lately people are beginning to understand and I've had people say to me recently you know I don't it doesn't really matter to me whether my eyes are open to see Heavenly things or not because you've taught us that when our eyes are open we don't just see the light we also see the other side and it's true and and we've got to know greater is he greater is he greater is he we keep reminding ourselves he said now I don't say demon possession he said you say I got the Holy Ghost brother brandom I ain't got no demon well I I don't say possession it's it's demon oppression Satan in the flesh not Satan in the spirit now watch that Satan in the spirit gives unclean habits and so forth and unbelief he said you might live just as pure and holy and clean and yet be a sinner it's your faith that saves you many people they're just as pure and clean and yet a lot cleaner sometimes than people who profess Christian lives but yet would deny the Holy Ghost would deny every operation to the power of God they're unbelievers no matter they're very religious now listen and the Antichrist Spirit you know we're just sure we'll recognize anything that's of the Antichrist because we still have a denominational mindset sometime that tells us that we'll always come and and be against Christ on now but the reality is that's not how the Antichrist Spirit works because the mystery of iniquity has been in the earth since godliness was was showed up in in Bethlehem that mystery of iniquity has been right there the two seeds the twins running right close together and the two spirits will be so close together in the last days that it would deceive the elect he said and the Antichrist spirit is a very Oh My Eyes Are Open I've seen better if you knew how many times somebody had told me that through these 50 Years brother it doesn't matter now I realize now it doesn't really matter I realize now God doesn't care the way you dress the way you live your life what you do he don't care about your Hab I realize now I realize now that that's not important I realize now that that doesn't matter My Eyes Are Open I've learned better you know what the word said about that kind of a spirit ever learning amen educated fools amen ever learning and never able to come through the heart knowledge of the truth full of information full of wwws come on but not full enough of the Holy Ghost that's right to recognize that Satan is trying to to steal your mind and when I was receiving this some time back it wasn't what the church was going to deal with they're dealing with this and more it's what the bride it's how the enemy is going to Target the bride that's right and if that lid of hell is ripped off and tens times 10,000 times 10 thousands of demon Spirits are loose not against the church that's already gone but against the bride how do you think that you're going to have a picnic how do you think you're going to whistle Dixie in in an hour like this no it's a battle brother it's a battle it's a battle it's a battle it's a battle and and here's the thing you got to realize now you can't trust your own feelings amen there it is you you can't trust your feelings they're deceptive I feel led I don't feel led the thing you need to ask yourself is what did the word say they get this talk in the modern church I don't feel convicted I I don't have any conviction over that you know what that doesn't amount to a hill of beans it doesn't matter whether you feel convicted of it or not it doesn't matter whether you you think it's wrong or not it doesn't matter whether you feel guilty of it or not you are not even in the equation here if God's word said it that settles it and God is not obligated to make you feel guilty for doing what his word said oh my my my my my my my my my my well if God don't want me to do it he can stop me let me spin the chamber and hand you the gun because that's that that same kind of spirit that would cause you to play Russian Roulette put a bullet in the in the chamber and spin and Hope hear me and hope that you don't have the bullet when you pull the trigger that's the kind of spirit and attitude that causes somebody to say if God don't want me to do it he can stop me oh he can it's true he can but the problem is God doesn't Delight in being a puppeteer it's not his will to have to always pull the strings to get you to move or not to move God wanted to come and live inside of of you so he could lead through you he could lead from inside of you Hallelujah he didn't want a robot if God would have roed a robot he'd have built a robot that had no choice and the way some people preach predestination you would think that there was no choice at all that you had no decision at all and that is not what the word said it says we did choose but he chose first you had a choice but he chose first amen and if he would have wanted to make you a robot he could have fixed you so that you would have never went the way of sin but he wanted you to understand what Redemption feels like he wanted you to know what it means to be saved from something and brought into something he said that Antichrist Spirit let's see what time it is 1 128 that Antichrist spirit is of very religious spirit Luke told me last night in a text at mine TI was crooked is it crooked Now problem was I didn't see the text for two hours after I was done that Antichrist spirits of very religious spirit just to the Mark just as religious as it can be the Antichrist Jesus even said if it would deceive the very elect if possible in the last day that's true so then it behooves you to know listen listen listen listen so then it behooves you to know where you're where you're do doing where you're standing and what you're talking to because that Spirit doesn't come in and present the opposite of Christ it presents another Christ and I just have a feeling that if you would have had confidence in the in the denominational Church's expression of Christ you'd have been out there a long time before now and then in a message the evening messenger it's the last quotation in this section brother brandom said today in my motel there laid a mother out there with not enough clothes on to w a mus a musket shotgun and her husband laying out there the same way in that cold wind they think their body so pretty they have to to show it he said don't you realize that's the devil Amen Let me see if I can get any amens he said don't you realize that's a devil that's right stripping their clothes only the insane does that oh it's quiet you know it's biblical though because Legion did it because he was crazy when he got clothed when he got in his right mind he put his clothes on didn't he notice we have that that but that's called style that's called modern we call it the we call it the devil he said I got the Bible to prove that's a devil it's devil possession it's demon possession not oppression possession he's got you the thing that would make a person strip their clothes off and walk up and down the street with their honey hanging out of their clothes or their bosom hanging out of their clothes a woman or a man to put on a pair of skinny jeans come [Music] on so that every shape of his body is exposed there's something wrong some where I saw a m I know I don't say it right uh where where someone said it's camp meeting time it's time to send out a memo to the guys on the platform to go and buy bigger pants and someone posted that we we got to let the musicians know I'm not talking about our musicians if they're guilty I'm talking about them but I thought even the this is the world out there the church out there has to has to send out a memo and say how about you folks buying some bigger britches he said that's not oppression that's not the enemy trying to control you from the outside in he he's found a throne he sat down on the inside 1 Timothy 41 and2 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith giving heed this is where he said we had to be careful giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron can I read that in the Amplified thank you but the Holy Spirit distinctly and expressly declares that in the latter time some will turn away from the faith giving attention to deluding and seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences have are seared as cauterized second Timothy 3:13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse this is 2 Timothy 3:13 deceiving read it for me and deceiving and being deceived and here is how a seducing Spirit can operate against you as a part of the bride of Christ second Timothy 215 through1 18 and and we'll see where we go from here study study study study that's not Google that's study that's not Duck Duck Go come on that is study study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly right that that that means the spirit is your spirit is right because if your spirit is not right you will divide the word according to your crooked Spirit rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodly overemphasizing things that matter that that really really really really really in the landscape of Eternity they don't matter more than you worrying about where where where Cain got his wife or where it's there the answer is in the in the message but instead of you getting so caught up in something like that the world you know how they like to get all carried away over something something like that you better find what matters and you better study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needed not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth now some of you have been under this ministry 30 plus years see I came here in 1990 how many years ago was that 34 years ago and some of you have been sitting under this ministry for 34 years and our EMP is has always been take it back that's what I heard him say take it back to the word back to the Bible and somewhere along the way this cultish Spirit that's right the one that caused people to drink the Kool-Aid and the one that caused people to denominate themselves into little sex and groups and separate themselves into the jungles of the world that little Spirit started infiltrating those who had heard and recognized the message of a prophet and they started giving birth to their cultish ways you don't have to say anything might be better for you to be quiet they started giving in to those seducing ways and those cultish spirits and even though this word and message itself will never be denominated ated they they took the fringes of the message and they started denominating that and trying to make that a Creed it's craziness to me that you would try to take the revealed word of the hour and turn it into some kind of a Creed and and then they they weren't satisfied that God always uses cracked pots that's right just look at the disciples broken affected by their circumstances bruised men imperfect men God always uses imperfect people do you know why that's the only kind he has he uses what he has and he uses Us in spite of our weaknesses and our and our our our twist and turns uh uh the prod of our upbringing he he and when man begin to try to deze the messenger and they love to say it in their meetings more than a man more than a man he was more than a man he was more than a man putting this little uh seed out there that causes people to begin to hold on to the coattails of a man when he himself said don't pay any attention to me you keep your eyes on the Christ you keep your eyes on the word but we have a tendency to to try to deify our leaders and they began to build this this uh structure around the edges of the truth and and now it is so serious that they will take the printed uh sermon and hold it up with the Bible and say uh both of these are the absolute the problem is he didn't say that any quotation that you can't take right back to the book you better just leave that there because you're not going to be able to whip the devil with something that's not built on the word now I know people don't like this kind of preaching but that's why so many people get shook up in this hour when they find out that men have Clay feet and they're not perfect and they don't have perfect recall and they may exaggerate you won't shake at all that won't even shake you if you're built on the right foundation if you take your faith right back to that word you won't have any problem when you discover that your pastor is a man if you take what he preaches back to the word you won't have any problem when you find out that he's a man you won't have any problem when you find out that that Prophet was a man a man sent from God but a man his flesh was just is rotten let's see if I can push that Spirit a little bit was just as rotten as yours just as ju had just as much of a tendency to to to to to uh magnify the number of the crowd he said so I'm not accusing him you know he was a fisherman he understood how things could be and because because we have in our mind tried to deify somebody when we are face to face with their Humanity we just it's just easier to throw the whole baby out with the bath water and say it's all a lie and there's nothing to it you go right ahead you you go right ahead and do that because if you were born for this truth it'll track you down like a hound dog I pray I get to see it when it knocks you over and licks you in the face and reminds you of who you really are yes sir and how you've come this far by faith not faith in a prophet but faith in a word and not faith in a printed Bible but faith in the Living Word that raises off the pages of that Bible and makes Christ a reality in your everyday life there will always be a seducing spirit yes to whisper in your ear sir sir and there will always be a poor example before you of how to do it wrong and you've got to make sure that you keep bringing your focus back to Christ but here's the root of the problem you didn't study you knew the church age book but you didn't know the Bible am you knew the titles of the sermons but you didn't know the Bible and so basically you were taking someone's opinion for what the word said and I don't say that to be ugly I say that to Simply say shame on us shame on any of us that wouldn't understand the importance of taking people back to the foundation yes sir say but I couldn't understand it that's why we have the Holy Spirit and that's why God sent the church age Messengers Through the Ages to help po point us and help us to focus on thus saith the Lord help us to make sure that we don't get too far out there because if we let Google lead us we'll live by emotion and here's what people do this is so funny so so funny I met some people when I was in Salt Lake City that I know and have known for some years I met them in a in a strange place and I didn't I didn't I didn't recognize the man if the wife would have been there I would have recognized her and and he walks up and we start having this wonderful conversation and the last time I saw him he was all excited about a diet that he had found a particular kind of eating style that he had found and he was so happy and he was preaching it I mean he was more passionate about that than some people people are about the word and he was just pushing and preaching and pumping and pimping and you know how they do and so I just braced myself when I recognized who he was and I thought he is going to give me The Gospel According to keto but guess what he's changed religions and he's now on the carnivore diet so he began to preach to me the the glory of eating like a carnivore and I'm sitting there thinking about some of the things that that that cause me the most trouble and I'm thinking I don't know if I could even do that uh but but he gives me a 20 minute sermon and he's calling out names for me to go on YouTube check it out check it out check it out and I'm trying to take these names down because I'm I I have no intention but I'm trying to look interested you know how you do sometime in church you're try to look interested and I'm trying to follow him the best way you got to hear doctor so and so and doctor so and so and doctor so and so and doctor so and so and they've got these Amazing Stories to Tell and I said well what about the the other doctors that you recommended the oh he said they don't know what they're talking about come on now you ever met anybody like that are you sitting on the Pew with anybody like that they change flavors every time you see them oh come on this vitamin C is the best so you hear them and you order that vitamin C and the next time you ask them oh no I don't use that one anymore I bought another one it's the best It's the Best of the Best of the Best of the Best come on I got got me some magnesium and it's the best of the best of the best of the best I just don't know if that's true or not and then I was willing to stand there for that and then he starts talking to me about about the secret societies and and Nano and and there are no real Jews in Israel and on and on on I said come on honey I'm ready to go you see I realize that we have this we have this thing in us sometime that we get more excited we get so excited about the new thing but when somebody meets us later we've already gone on they want to know about the the old thing that was the new thing that's right and we don't remember the old thing that was the new thing we're now onto a newer newer thing and all the doctors that we trusted above all the other these three right here are now I know I know they don't like I know the government is after them I know that what they say is the absolute truth and then we say what about the oh no no no no no I found the three real doctors now these real doctors they really know how it's all supposed to be how am I supposed to have confidence to understand them you'd have to know what kind of a of a of a ride they're on Amen and uh because they now have confidence in this new doctor everything he says has got to be the truth I don't think I'd believe that if I were you cuz they're just practicing medicine anyway they're just learning you know anyway and when you think you found the best I'm going to stick with these guys they're going to help me through the rest of my life and then now you found the best and the new improved version and let me tell you something you might get by if that's your way of buying vitamins and you're choosing keto over carnivore and and uh you know whatever Atkins used to be the thing and then they found out that that's not good because you you need fruit and you need that in in some levels and so they've got new improved and you get caught up on that and you it's all you talk about and it's all you pump and all you all you sell and pedal and and so forth and Etc you can't let your faith be like that if someone can talk you out of this message they'll try to talk you out of everything they'll tell you the gifts are not for today they'll tell you that that there's no five-fold Ministry they'll they they'll tell you all they'll tell you you can't even have a personal experience with the Holy Ghost they'll tell you that Miracles were only for the apostles come on and as long as you stick with them you'll follow in that train of thought but if you let the enemy lead you around you'll end up an agnostic I knew right away as soon as someone starts telling me the Jews are not the real Jews I know what's coming next I know the next step in that we're the real Jews they'll start saying we're the scattered tribes of Israel and they'll start trying to make themselves the natural seed I remember when they came around and tried to tell us that that uh that Charles was the Antichrist Prince Charles now King Charles is the Antichrist I remember when they told us that Ronald Wilson Reagan 666 I remember when they told us at kusf and gorbachov and gorbachov even had the scar on his head and just a few weeks ago the picture goes all over the Internet of the blood on Donald Trump's face and people have introduced him as the as the Beast that has now received the wound so he is the Antichrist seducing Spirits right lying Devils things that will just pull you away and you say I'll never go there let me tell you something once you jump in that hole it's only God who can pull the rains this bride must be on guard we must watch for every seduction that the enemy would try he cannot change our election he cannot change our predestination but if he can affect our relationship with Jesus Christ I always worried about some folks along the way who got more excited about worship than they did the word I love worship I preach it I teach it and I practice it but it's the word that changes us if they give worship their full attention but use their phone during the preaching the enemy is subtle musicians are coming in a message called father the hour has come he said now he thought he had the spirit of God but it was a lying spirit because it was contrary to the word anybody that tries to tell you there's three persons in the godhead they're under a lying Spirit tell them if they approach you with that Doctrine just tell them I don't believe that lie how do you know that because it's contrary to the word here o Israel he's one Spirit somebody said well how many persons is he one Jesus is not the the second person in the godhead he's the only person in the godhead he's the only one that had a physical body to live in come on now you better stay with that word don't you let them confuse you with this too God mess it's too person mess that they're spreading around the truth come on it was a lying spirit because it was contrary to the word now if people say signs and wonders don't follow if they say signs and wonders don't follow if somebody tells you that signs and wonders don't follow the word it's a lying spirit it's contrary to the word to the word if the Bible said people tell you the Holy Ghost ain't in this day the same as it was in the other days what kind of spirit is it church it's a lying Spirit that's in false prophets it's not the it's not the false prophets who tell you that God is one you need to be worried about it's the ones who are telling you that that that he's three it's a one it's a people that are telling you the Holy Ghost is not for today it's a lying Spirit that's in false prophets they're telling you a lie it it all liberation of women and do all these other things and go out and act like the world it's a lying spirit it's not lying up with the word stay [Music] in all of it stay in all of it because according to what doctor you're following he'll tell you that red meat is good or red meat is not good and do you remember when we couldn't eat eggs and did you know that now the carnivore diet at least a modified version of the cardor diet is encouraging people to eat eggs lots of eggs lots and lots and lots of eggs up to 10 or 12 eggs a day the hens haven't changed the eggs haven't changed we're listening to other doctors so somebody with a deceiving Spirit can take a scripture lift it out of its context and and and to convince you that's why you've got to run it all the way through takes the Holy Ghost fill us fill us Lord may we not have to deal with these kinds of spirits in our life may we recognize them from the start and shut them down if someone comes to you and tries to get you to join in with their criticism of your church you should shut them down right away we're not a perfect Church you just tell we're not a perfect church but we're a church that's got a heart for God and I'm not going to listen to your criticism if they try to uh persuade you away from the message of Truth you let them know right now do what you need to do what you want to do what you feel to do but ask for me in my house we're not just a bunch of Dumb Bunnies following Shelly we had an experience tell them I had an experience with God before I came here I'm following the same Holy Ghost now that I was following way back when don't you let that thing don't give it an ear don't you let that thing take a hold of your life because if you do it'll wrap you up right they're telling you a lie the last and closing the second seal he said that Spirit speaks expressly that in the latter days they depart from the faith and would give heed to seducing you know what seducing is a seducing spirit in the church it's clergy yes it is seducing clergy Spirit how can you how can you preach that how can you say that aren't you aren't you a clergy aren't you a preacher I am and I don't have any problem saying this at all right because the enemy is looking for every opportunity he'll use whoever yields and he knows that the influence is often in the pulit so that's where those seducing Spirits sometimes try to work seducing clergy Spirit working of devils hypocrisies in the church he high-m minded wisdom you see smart intelligent having a form of godliness having a form of godliness but denying the Revelation the power and the working of the spirit from such for this is the sort that would go from house to house and Lead silly women that don't mean Holy Ghost watch him that don't mean Holy Ghost women silly women that's LED away with diverse lusts are you with me yes I'm closing I'm not nearly done I wanted to really to to get to that familiar spirit because these familiar spirits run with iniquity and they know more about us sometimes it seems that we know about ourselves because they observed the generation before us and they become so familiar we we deal with them and deal with them until we break that cycle through repentance until it's hard sometime to even recognize is when you're under the influence of that thing you see it's not just a familiar Spirit as one that works in witchcraft but I want you to know that there are uh I like to call them some people call them monitoring Spirits I I I think they move like reconnaissance Spirits they they they like to to dig what they can dig to hear what they can hear to learn what they can learn so that they can turn that thing around and use it against your life you see it's not just the spirit of the Lord that uh can sometimes discern things that are not to be known but sometimes familiar spirits can be involved and uh people will will kind of think that they're operating in a gift when actually it's a it's a spirit that's feeding them information and they use that to gain some sort of manipulation and influence over somebody and we better watch for that kind of Seduction because we found a word that is strong and is secure and we better make sure that we're not giving heed to anything that is not of God how do I do that stay with the word stay in the word Stay full of the Holy Ghost let Christ be in the center of your vision when darkness comes let it let it be over here in the edges of the brightness and Brilliance of Christ don't don't follow after that refuse that that vain uh uh uh uh fables and and all the kinds of things that the enemy will use to to pull you away don't you stick your head in the in the fence and try to eat the grass on the other side of the fence lose your balance and break your neck I just can't hardly wait until I find a perfect Church CU When I do I'm going to join it why would you want to ruin a good thing ain't that right why would you and I want to ruin a good thing if it's perfect we ought to leave them alone they don't need our problems you're never going to have a perfect place you're always going to have flawed people but oh as long as those flawed people know in whom they have believed as long as you'll keep trusting him he'll fix it he'll help you

many of you are not hoping so you've got some Assurance father thank thank you for this weekend together thank you for your presence we may not know it now but we will look back many of us will look back on this weekend and we will recognize that God was strengthening us for the testings ahead that is your faithfulness to us that you would prepare us for what we face face Lord if you were a God that didn't know it all we couldn't have that Assurance but you're a God who sees tomorrow as well as you have seen today you're a God who sees 10 years from now and even throughout all eternity and we bless your name for everything you have done in us and for us Lord I pray that you will bless every every person under the sound of my voice with a greater determination to run this race with patience to win to win because you are the prize you are the Victor would you watch over them as they travel the dangerous roads of life and would you settle them in their homes at the right time and Lord if it would be your will those visiting us today would you lead them back this way again because their presence this weekend has been an encouragement and a strength to all of us father help us to stand to stand as never before no matter what the wind brings give us courage make us bold and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus

we want you to get them down there uh if you if you're able to walk down then you can bring your car down and drop off and and and park at the top there there just absolutely will not be enough places for us all to park please understand that those of us who live local we have to go home and get our dishes because we we didn't we have more than cold cuts and so we have to go and get the warm dishes and bring them back so it takes us just a little while to get it together together but you can love one another and fellowship one another until we're all gathered this afternoon in the Tabernacle
