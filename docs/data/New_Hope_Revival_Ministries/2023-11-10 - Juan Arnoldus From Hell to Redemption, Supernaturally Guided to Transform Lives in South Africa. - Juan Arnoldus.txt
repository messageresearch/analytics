========================================
[Music] hi I'm Joshua shell and I'd like to welcome you back to another nhrm podcast we just got done our camp meeting this past weekend and past week and we had some amazing services and I'm joined here today with one of our guest speakers from the camp meeting brother Al nalis from Cape Town South Africa so welcome it's an honor to have you on here thank you Joshua it's nice being here it's a privilege and an honor to be part of this program well thank you for agreeing to do this with me um it's I feel like it's an honor thank you um I really want to jump right into it and get to know really get to know you a little bit better and uh hear about some of your background growing up um what it was like growing up in Cape Town and just some of your background yeah I was born on the 17th of September 198 in uh Cape Town South Africa um my mother's family were a very cly family father's family were opposite very ungodly so I was basically raised among them on my father's small with my father's family that was very ungodly like I said and very worldly and so I was introduced um to a more ungodly life than to a Godly life so I basically grew up with a sin life and knew nothing basically about the Sanctified life so to me and uh growing up amongst them uh they were gangsters they had many gangster friends they were very involved in gangsterism so for me life was to party to drink to smoke I basically thought that was life you know to get the best girl to get the best car and the things of life and I thought that was life and um but everybody have a life story you know with brother brandham I believe your life story becomes also your training ground and your background God uses uh to use it one day in your ministry sure like with brother Brandon's life story and my life story was I don't say I'm like a Moses or so but Moses was uh raised um in in Egypt with Egyptian gods uh Egyptian way of lifestyle so that's the same way I was basically also raised because I think God used that or allowed that so that Moses could understand the Egyptian ways and Egyptian gods and the Egyptian uh Styles and we know according to shadows and types Egypt is a type of the world so that's basically how I was raised that's was that was my background and that's why when God spoke to to Moses Moses was like you know do you want me to go to Egypt he understood the background the lifestyle the son of Egypt even the gods of Egypt for sure and he told the people he he told god um the how will the people believe me and what shall I tell the people who are you because there's so many gods in Egypt and these people are so dedicated to their gods and the lifestyle he understood everything basically about Egypt and so the first thing that God revealed to Moses was basically sin he sold him the serpent and Moses wanted to run away and he gave the first revelation that revealed to him was basically the serpent that represent or typed sin so God never revealed to him first the lamb and the blood that only came afterwards so Moses had to understand what sin is and the and the beginning of sin and the original sin that's what God revealed to Moses that's what brother told us that's why Moses wrote the first books so Moses had the complete revelation of the Original Seed original sin and he had the revelation of what happened in the Garden of Eden so the first thing that God revealed to Moses was and to me the same I understood sin I understood the power of sin I understood the attraction of sin even the beauty of sin and that's why every evangelist need to understand that Moses was brother says he basically had a Ministry like brother Brenham or brother Brenham had a Ministry like Moses M so Moses was like a evangelist and a prophet at the same time he had a a prophetic Evangelistic Ministry so Moses um basically had the revelation of sin and so I understood the power of sin the beauty of sin the attraction of sin because bra says the serpent was a beautiful uh creature and bra says even after the curse he never lost his Beauty so that shows you how attractive sin is and how sin attracted even Eve and convinced her and um I like what brother B preach preach a sermon the cruelty of sin so even brother Brenham had the revelation of sin God had to S him and going to the depth of that and showing the cruelty of sin but if you don't understand the attraction of sin if you don't understand the power of sin and that's why I think God allowed me also to be raised in that background to understand the depth of sin and what sin is really about and the beauty and the desires of sin Genesis 3:1 the Bible says and uh the serpent was the more subst subtle than all the other creatures in the field and that word you can break it up he was the more clever he was more clever more cunning more smarter there's even a quote where brother says the seat of the seat of the serpent is twice smarter than the seat of Abram and then the prophet also tells us that the devil has 6,000 years of experience 6,000 years of experience and there's no way we where we can outsmart some yeah for sure but you have to have Revelation it can only come by re ation that's why the greatest battle is in our minds and B say that's a chosen place of battle and so the devil have he have access to your mind even if you're a Christian even if you're uh filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you still have access to your mind but the prophet says Revelation goes above above your mind so with six so with 6,000 years of experience the devil cannot smart us but when God comes by Revelation and I think that's what God did to Moses he revealed to Moses the power of sin and he sold to mes Moses and and Moses was afraid when when he throw down the rot which I believe he slded him and where did you get the rot from it comes from a tree so he so him sin came by the tree by a serpent and he said take the serpent by the tail which mean there can come an end to sin and they turned again to a rot which means that Don't Preach against people's sin but preach them out of their sins you know because I was a I was deep in sin and when people when I used to see people preach against our son when we would come with our with our beard and walking in the street and people say look at them and look at them shame on them then uh you will never draw them closer to God you make them stubborn for sure they want to show you better and do better but I think God with um B says and that's what God did with Moses he revealed to him the serpent and then afterwards he revealed to him the power of the blood of the lamb and that's basically the background how I I grew up and um so to me life was drinking Smoky party uh who can uh party the most who can drink the most who can smoke the most and I never knew that that's actually death came to find out that what I thought was what was life was actually death yeah because Apostle Paul in uh Philippians 1 120 verse chapter 1: 21 he says these words he says for me to love is Christ so Christ is life life comes from God he's the giver of God he's The Giver of Life even the extender of life and uh who can tell us better about life than God himself because he's the creator of Life how to enjoy life the secrets of Life The Mysteries of life it all comes from God so we thought we know what life is I I always look up to my uncles and they were the best guys they got the best girls they every party they were the best in drinking dancing smoking everything they were the top of the top to me they were Heroes yeah at that time you know but I didn't know that that's actually actually death and John 10:10 says this says so wonderfully he says the thief comes to the Devil comes to steal destroy and to kill but Jesus came to give us life and life abundance so who better can tell us about life than God so to enjoy life and to actually understand life the best thing is to understand Christ and that's why Paul came to that knowledge even Moses came to that knowledge but so for me to live was drinking smoking and parting um up till My Teenage life and then my father was in the military so he uh basically retired and we had to move back to a small town where my mother actually grew up and her family was that side and they were a Godly family yeah so we moved back to that side now so it's from the ungodly family now we're moving to The Godly family and came there and uh I was still going on continuing drinking smoking and all of that and my grandfather was basically the pastor of the Baptist Church he was the leader of the church there and I turned all my cousins to drinking and smoking and and and I was busy with partying and things like that and my grandfather used to rebuke me and say you know that's the most ungodly thing you can do over here we we serve God in Holiness so they will they were strict on Holiness and um so I came one one time me and my girlfriend which is my wife today we came from a party from uh a whole weekend of drinking and partying and we came home on our way home we had a terrible accident my best friend died in the accident uh in that accident I basically went out of my body I went to yell never knew there was a yell saw y experien yell for 5 minutes the smelling and I can tell you it smells exactly like when you drink and smoke all those sin sun goes with a smell and it was so I couldn't even breathe in that area and uh there was a nashing of teeth the gates open and the gates were like um uh uh when the gates open I could my my teeth was nashing you know and I went into this place a dark very dark very dark place and it was I just saw the mountains there were no sun no light just as brother brand explained it but within 5 minutes time I was back in my body so everybody in the in the combi we we driving a Combi went to hospital but I had no mark on my on my face body nothing I didn't go to the hospital so my grandfather came to pick me up but that night I made a promise to my wife which is my girl which was my girlfriend at that time I told her you know I'm finished with wealthy things I'm going to serve god with everything that's within me I will never ever if I want to turn back to the world remind me of this day because I never had driver's license I was supposed to go to jail for mans my best friend died but somehow God just worked it out and I came free of it all and that's how I came to Christ no preacher could preach me in but to go through that accident and go out of my body I know I only after I think 10 years or 20 years I've told people about the this experience that I had about the Al and it was very very bad and that basically convinced me to serve God and that's why I gave my life to the Lord so for a few years I just served God in my grandfather's church and then afterwards came to the message of the hour that's amazing um so how long have you known your wife because so y'all have been together for a long time very very long time you know bra says your life goes in cycles of seven it's amazing um I I saw it the first time I was still like I said now and then weekends I would go to my to my to my mother's family and she stayed opposite my my auntie so we were again drinking and partying there but the next morning I didn't sleep you know we were so busy with sin and so busy so uh enthusiasm with with the things of the world and that's why I say you have to serve god with with excitement and with everything that's within you and we were drinking and smoking and I was alone awake and the next morning early in the morning I was sitting outside and she left across my my auntie's house and she stood in the door she couldn't see me I saw her and I'm telling you I was sober I just became sober instantly when I saw and I don't even know God and I said Lord if you give that girl to be my wife I will serve love you one day you know and she was 14 years old I was 14 years old only years after that somebody introduced us again I think at the age of 16 17 years old wow my cousin introduced us to each other and from there it was love at first sight for her that was my second experience it was her first experience it was my second experience with her and um like I said um yeah from there we got married 21 we were 21 years old got married and full-time Ministry we went into and we got became 8 28 years old and you can see all the cycles of seven we have five kids um three boys two girls and because we're married young they are teenagers now so we are just one big house full of Youth young people you know so we enjoy our lives with them and it's to serve God is the most important thing is the best thing in the world to do I think so many people miss out you know because um God told Abra Adam the day you eat of that Tre that day you die and they didn't die instantly they was they start dying yeah and that's why says only years after that he said you have to eat the tree of life and to know life is to know Christ and if you don't know Christ you've never you never lived amen you are busy dying so many people are just dying without Christ that's what you are doing you are wasting your time wasting your money wasting your years and to serve him is definitely the most important thing in the world to do and it's and it's worth it to do it yeah so after you came to back after you came to the Lord after that accident and everything when did you first hear about brother Brandon how did you get you know acquainted with that's that's a good question because that also brings in how I um came in contact with your father's Ministry okay um what basically happened was um I didn't even know I had to go to a new job I got a new job a promotion to a new job and um the guy that I worked with was in the message but amazing thing is at the same time my uncle said a worldwind came into his uh uh um working place where he basically worked G he said the worldwind came in there and told him to speak to me about the message of the hour but because my uncle was in the message of the hour and and I think he's he last saw us 10 or 12 years last so what he did is he came and he gave me the books introduce the message of the hour to me I started studying because at that time remember I was in a Baptist Church we love the word of God I used to fast and pray and spend time with the word but only the word and then he showed me the books and I I was reading the books to basically disprove it but the more I wanted to disprove it the more the word of God proved it and um so at the same time he introduced uh the message to me and the guy that I worked with um we were about I was a porter at the hotel that's where I started and we were about 12 Porters and only me and him were serving God so obviously we became best bues but came to find out he was also in the message of the hour and then because there was a transport problem with us going to work I had to stay with my auntie for 2 months and was staying and when I stayed at her house I went to church with her and when I went to church with her when I got in the church they were preaching the message of the hour so it was my uncle introducing the message to me at the same time uh my best friend at work was in the message of the hour and at the same time I had to to to to move to my auntie's house because we didn't have transport to go to work and there was a transport problem and she was also in the message of the hour but still I couldn't be convinced because you must understand I my grandfather's Church all the whole family was in that church so to me you know there was no way for me to leave that church so um because I was also preaching that church um normally they don't allow young people to preach it was only the elderly people so how how old would you bed when I started preaching 18 years old so what happened was when I came to church or God sa my life all the elderly Brothers backs slided so there was only young people left so they ask us to start preaching and you can imagine I knew nothing about the word my wife always says you know nothing about the word so when they ask you to preach it looks like you knew you you knew the Bible I said no I didn't know the Bible I didn't knew the Bible I knew nothing about the Bible but um what basically happened what convinced me that this message is the truth is the brother it was my best friend brother Mor delpo handed me a tape of your father it was the prodical son so that night I was fasting and praying and I was listening to the prodical Son and the Way Pastor sh was placing predestination in the prodical son he was never lost he was just a lost son he didn't become a son he was always a son before the foundation of the world so Pastor s put in predestination adoption how the young son represent the Gentiles and the Elder son the Jews I could see the whole message of the hour basically in that one sermon and that convinced me that voice that I heard while I was in this dark room laying it it was like I would hear the voice of God speaking to me directly to me so at that moment basically Pastor s's Ministry convinced me that this message is nothing but the truth wow and um just a few months after that my grandfather passed away look how good God is and then the voice said it's time for you to come out so when I came out I lost all my family now in the small town uh basically everybody knew everybody MH so when I stepped out of my grandfather's turs I basically lost all my tur friends all my family um by coming to the to Christ I lost my father's uh family because they were deep in s and I was now a Christian so I lost them basically and when I came to the message of the hour I lost my um my Christian family so we were all alone and it was a hard time which was stuff we would walk in town past my auntie and past my cousins and they would not greet us because if we leave your father if if we leave our grandfather's thirs and we going to hell that was basically the thing you know how could I leave my grandfather church and this message is nothing but demonic and what we did is we used wisdom we just thought you know just love the life and uh but like I said after I think 20 years after 20 years my family is starting to come now that's to the B of the hour but like I said I didn't it wasn't just only the one tape that I uh listened of your father me and brother mon started calling uh the office here like we had no we had nothing and um the sisters that used to work here they they basically sent us the tapes for free and we were just studying and feeding on that and I think it was the same time 2001 2002 uh so it's over 22 years ago yeah and it was always our Dream to come here so after 22 years SC but it possible for us to come here and I'm telling you what a what a blessing what a blessing but like I said we studied those tapes and we've listened to tapes like former letterin uh the uh um even the transition from bride to wife and we've heard all those visions and uh what God basically uh did uh through your father's Ministry it blown our minds you know and it just just literally like brother B says uh draw us closer to Jesus Christ and it was our Dream to meet Pastor s and uh I mean after 22 years I'm the only one that made it till th far but there's so many brothers back there so for me being your an honor and a privilege and I promise them when I come back I will have all the equipment all the material we need uh because there were certain things that we wanted to know about the visions and and the seals that we there was no way that we could get hold of it because we had no money and um my wife reminded me on the way yeah how I used to go to the Internet shop just to listen to One sermon you know because we we didn't have money for internet or anything but after so many years God really blessed us and uh just honored to be here and privileged to be here that's amazing uh I now I know y'all do a lot of um tent meetings and tent services over there tell me a little bit about that some of the services from over there I'm also trying to find out you know my my grandfather's church is more on evangelism okay so they more they mostly went out to preach open air service and things like that but I when I listen to Pastor s's uh Ministry I could also hear that these Ministry was also very in the early early years it was also uh 10 10 arrivals and what has happened we have like bra says how do you know that somebody really have the Holy Ghost he just he didn't give a scriptural answer he just gave out of his own uh experience he said when you grown in your soul for Souls that's a sign that you must have the Holy Ghost so we were groaning always we had open airs sometimes that's only me and my wife that that had the open ears sometimes me and my wife my sister and um we started at church very small with four people and um well we always hired tent or rented tent we have Services just to draw the people to the message of the hour but in 20 um 21 December the C uh it was coover 2019 2020 it was cover 2021 they had a lot of restrictions and so that December they opened up basically all the uh the gates and everything you could fly to another country and we wanted to have holiday at that time and we said oh we just want to have holiday and then a brother had a dream one of the elders in our church had a dream where brother Brenham appeared to him in a dream and said you have to buy a tent and you have to to just once more go out and get soul safed and uh to give you a few testimonies about that yeah um well we bought a tent and then we took all all of their money all the people everybody in church you know everybody because with the lockdown everybody just wanted to go out but we couldn't go out and uh because the Lord said we have to buy the tent so everybody put their money together we bought a tent and um brother B every time we had to go to another town brother B would appear to this brother and and elderly sister to tell them the name of the town what we should do in the town what's going to happen in the town to us it was it was amazing yeah so I also asked the brother you know why do you dream about so so often you know and also came to find out that the the farm where brother Brenham in Cape Town came to pray I think on on voice of God you can find it on a meal for the prophet okay uh he went to that farm and and the people in Kalan area in Cape Town W Cape they basically cooked for brother Bren and brother B prayed for the farm and we found out that that brother's mother was working there and when brother B prayed she became pregnant and gave birth to him and he's wow he was I think in 2021 he was he was 7 years old and then all of a sudden he started dreaming about brother Brenham and he had these series of dreams to to say listen you have to buy the t put up a t day so every second month we we take the tent out and we take the whole church with us and for week and we have a Friday Saturday and Sunday service there and what we do is uh uh like I said everything brother Brenham says what's going to happen in the town happens so there was one particular place that brother B said we have to go to in a dream to this brother he said we have to go to hany now nobody in the church had a clue where hky it was it I don't think it's even on the map that's how small that place is Hy wow so and told the brother that in this in this small town called Hy it rained for the last 7 years there's no rain so there's no work the farmers cannot Farm there's no rain it rains all around that City around that town but rain doesn't fall on that town for the last seven years wow so we went to look for the place it's called hanki it's in the Eastern Cape and nobody in our church people we drove past that place many many times but we never knew there was a place called Anki W so we had to go Google search for an we went to an came we came to the area and we spoke to the people try to make preparation for the 10 Services uh we do it like brother bam does it we uh uh invite the message pastors we look around where the closest message churches we invite the Pentecostal pastors all the Pastors in the area we invite them to the service speak to them first and tell them this is what we're going to do not that we need a permission just out of respect because certain cultur s certain uh uh towns work differently if you don't if you don't uh uh inform them about the services then they basically boyot the services so we do it brother bram's way we go around inform them and just out of respect and if they want to support they can support it if they don't want to supported we still continue to to do the work so we went around there and then they they told us it haven't rained for the last s years exactly what brother told us and the brothers it was with us we were like this can't be you know it can never be so while we were there we tested it we said Lord as a brothers let's pray Lord if you really want us to be in this town let it rain today and you won't believe that night it rain like never before just that one day and that same night brother B appeared to the brother and said you see I'm the Elijah for this day Elijah can bring the rain or he can stop the rain so after two months we came with our whole church there and we announced we preach a series on rain and the spirit of Elijah and while we were preaching about Elijah there cannot be Elijah unless there's a jezebel so we understood what the Jezebel comes Elijah Ministry so obviously that town was dominated by the spirit of Jezebel and because of that spirit and wrong worship um what basically happened was that that's why there was drought and we said if they can if they can believe in the spirit of Elijah and what God has done for this day then I believe it will rain and we prophesied rain we prayed for rain and after we left seven days after that it rain it couldn't stop people were calling us emailing us what WhatsApp they said everything they said listen it's crazy here and that the whole Eastern Cape if you go back and you watch the news that the whole Eastern Cape flooded the dams were like 3% full now it's 100% F wow that's how how powerful it became and also one another testimony like I said every time we have to go to a next town then brother B would appear to the brother say listen take the T to this town this town this town so we are doing the whole of South Africa and um what basically happened also the last 10 Revival we had now was in stren area called strand and we went to that area and before we as we went to the area the brother had another dream brother B said listen if the people of that area is not going to listen because it's close to the coastline the the sea is very very close to that to that area okay and uh but the water there is very flat I mean there's no not really waves actually yeah so the brother had a dream and said uh the angel of the Lord appear to him and then it becomes an angel of turn into Angel of the Lord and he said the people of this area listen the waves will come over the so and well I preached it the Saturday I said listen if you don't listen this is going to happen and I mean 14 days after that the whole Western Cape had a problem with big waves coming over and flooded most of the areas in the Western Cape wow so people from Str started listening they came to our services they said wow we didn't we couldn't believe this is happening but God uh there was a double confirmation of it because we also said it's going to flood there and a week after after that also after the two weeks after the waves came over a week after that it started raining in Cape Town and it flooded the whole Western Cape basically so right now we have a problem because those people are running for the services they believe in God so that's that's just small things testimonies that I can share with you and Supernatural things that happened in the tent and and and many many other things people got saved that which is the best medical is the Salvation of people's Souls you know we don't make a we don't major on the Supernatural and stuff like that but it's part of the word of God we do have a balance in the word and the Supernatural and we believe in dreams visions and Angel visitations and we believe in the Revival as brother bam said there will be a bright Revival sure what's it like living in a town like Cape Town where there's so many different I mean there's like you were saying here the other night there's so many different people from around the world that live there what's it like living there well um kton is a is a is a very very exciting place to stay like I said um I think every year basically it's part of the it it it's the number one city when it comes to the Seven Wonders around the world they chose cities I think it's also one of the best uh tourism attractive places in the world but sin is on a high alert but Isaiah says when the enemy comes in like a flood of spirit of God will raise a standard you know so we are trying really trying our best and um to reach out to the lost and uh um we're actually blessed in Cape Town because um all the other um provinces we call it provinces I think you call it states all the other states is basically uh ruled by by the ANC party and I mean poverty is hitting South Africa like never before but Cape Town is still surviving because we under uh another uh political party that basically believe God and they they really sustain cap toown and that's why captown is still in the good very good condition and um but that's why we take advantage of that to also take the Gospel of Jesus Christ out as quickly as possible because the rule they're getting Stricker and strier with the governmental rules they don't want 10 revivals anymore so we really pray and but God working people's hearts you know and God open doors for us wherever we go uh basically the the mayor of the area of the mayor of the city will tell us no no no I want you to have the service here because there's so much gangsterism so much drug addiction and and things like that going on and I'm telling you that when we went to strand uh days before we went there there was a a a a violent gang fight that basically broke out and people were shoting and killing each other like like crazy even our church wanted to know are you really going to go there I said if the Lord say we go we going you know we're not on a on a picnic we on a on a battlefield yeah so by faith we went and to our amazement when we put up the 10 the gang fight stopped the shooting stopped oh wow and after we we left the area I think up till today there's never been a gun shot again no gangsterism no fights no nothing but it's only the grace of God and God get all the honor you know and uh we know the last move of God it's not going to be a man it's not a one man Ministry um 1 Thessalonian 4:16 says the Lord himself will descend with a shout with a voice in a trump so I believe God himself is coming down to do something powerful in his last days as he promised I'll pour out my spirit you know so no Cape Town definitely things are changing and we have the faith to to do um to basically bring that whole city to a stands still for Christ and when to turn the whole city for Christ obviously we know there's only the predestinated seed that can come to the lord well how often are y'all having these Ted meetings or Ted revivals is it just when you feel like the Lord is leading you to have them or do you have like yeah but says you have to be inspired so when God inspires us um you know uh we know it's the word of God and like I said it's amazing because every second month we're trying to have it because it's a lot of money and we travel with the old church obviously the brothers sleep in the tent but we try to get accommodation for the Sisters as cheap as we can and we take our own food with you know we take the whole church because it's more effective when we take a crowd like we know there have to be attraction sure you know so when we we realize when we take a whole crowd with we bring that whole small town to a stand still because everybody to know who's all these cars who where's all these people coming from and then on what we also do we go through the streets and Advertiser services and we also put up uh a posters and we also like I said we go to the churches and give them the invitation letters and then we also send our youth and our elders through the streets and the sisters and we try to evangelize and try to to reach out to the community and invite the people and also go from house to house and try to pray for the people and it's been so effective so effective but what we do we try to do it every second month because it's a lot of work a have money for sure and to put up a tent it's not easy no I mean um so we do a Friday Saturday Sunday so and then we have lunch together as a church and then when while everybody's there we we uh break down the tent because like I said it's a lot of work a lot of trucks a lot of uh um buies that we have to use uh to to transport the stuff yet so about how many people are in the group that travel with you every other month to do this mostly most of those who are available go so we over over 1 15200 that normally travels that's awesome yeah so we TR with everybody everybody wants to be part of it because if you he like brother appear in a dream we have to go to this town this is going to happen this is going to happen you're going to want to go people I mean even the even the sisters husbands it's not safe they say I want to go see it yeah is this really going to take place and obviously it takes place and like I said it's God and um and we just honor him and if we can put the the honor at the right in the right place you know God can place and trust us even the more and that's what we want to do sure and um God said if we can be faithful and doing the small towns I mean we started with towns like oh it was bad we started with the poorest of the poorest towns places people no nobody wants to go there nobody wants to start a churs nobody even want to have church there so God tested us was with that so we were faithful with that and then God said I will trust you with bigger and bigger and bigger and then later on he said listen I want you to move from Province from state to state so we are we're going to travel through the whole of South Africa I think um next year we are planning to go maybe uh to Johannesburg Petoria and and and Bloom Fontaine places like that and it's so amazing one brother another guy came to us uh the brother is in our church but his brother-in-law is not safe he came to us the other day and he said listen I got big trucks whenever you guys need to use it you can use it oh wow that's amazing and this how God provides for himself because it was a problem to us because we had only this like you call it a a truck small trucks you call it the baky South Africa so we only had a baky with the big trailer and then we pull the the chairs and the sound system and we take everything with but now with this guy coming up with all the the big trucks said no I have huge Tru you can just you can use it you can anytime you want to and it's just how God provides for you know it's just a blessing um another thing do you if do you have anything that you feel like the lord has laid on your heart here recently that you would like to share you know from this past week or anything like that that you would just like to share with yeah we had it was a wonderful wonderful uh week I mean this Feast of Tabernacles was was something to experience it was experience of a lifetime but what I I just want to uh encourage the youth because why God's plan is a youth plan and uh in the message we are losing a lot of our young people sure all over you can see all over the world basically in the message of the hour our young people are leaving the message and um I just want to encourage them with this there's two very important things that you have to find in your youth that's very important it's in the Bible it's very important to find this in your youth the first thing that you have to find in your youth is Ecclesiastes 12: one it says the Bible says there um remember your creator in the days of your youth before the evil days come I don't know why God Called It the evil days that's basically if you miss God in your Youth and you only find God at a very old age the Bible caused evil it caus it's not going to be uh exciting years because you can't jump and shout and travel and take the gospel out uh as when you were a young man so the first thing the Bible says you have to find your Creator and you have think about to create a new youth so according to the scripture God will always introduce himself in your childhood in your youth years maybe you can miss him but according to the scripture he always comes to you in your youth years like David said I serve the Lord from my youth so it's important to find God in your youth very important absolutely important um because otherwise you will only have Wasted Years so many people miss that to find God in their youth they're so busy with sin and drinking and party and smoking that they missed the opportunity where God actually introduced himself to them so that's what this scripture is saying remember thy Creator in the days of your youth the second thing is very important and brother B also take those two things it's so amazing Proverbs 5:8 says uh Rejoice with the wife of your youth so the first thing you need to find in your youth is you need to find your Creator and the second thing you need to find in your youth is your wife and I always tell the people listen don't be so busy with things of the world that you miss your opportunity with your wife so God introduces himself in your life when you y yeah and then the second thing God will introduce to you is your wife in your youth years because the Bible says in Proverbs 5:18 uh Rejoice with the wife of your Youth and many people they're so busy with worldly things they met God they meet God only when have encounter with God when they're very old and then they realize they also miss the the woman or the the lady they were supposed to get married with so that's why I always tell our youth listen God will introduce himself to you as a young man and he will also bring your wife and that's what brother bam also says he says outside of eternal life the best thing God can do to you is to give you a Godly wife so that's my advice to young people is to to seek after God and this is what I want to say about Sin as well sin have no Heights it only have depths for sure sin have no promotion it only have demotions it only demotes you that's why the devil was demoted sin started in heaven and he fell and sin that's what sin will do sin is a unsatisfied thing you will go from smoking this to smoking that and uh to get satisfied and you never get satisfied you can um you drink this wine and then you want to drink something stronger to satisfy yourself to drink something more stronger you will go from wine to wine drinking this to drinking that to drinking the other thing smoking this to smoking that try to satisfy yourself but you cannot satisfy yourself you will go from woman to woman and you cannot satisfy yourself because there's no satisfaction in sin and the only satisfaction is in Christ we were all born um with that nature of seeking thirsting and looking but many people unfortunately never realize that that what they are actually searching looking for is their soul that's crying out the Deep calling to the Deep right and they try to satisfy it with the wrong material the wrong things at the wrong places and people since your birth you are looking searching and and and and because when you look at a baby when the baby is born amazingly how that baby will look for his mother's breast his head will go like this because since you are born you are searching and looking and many people it's a heartbreaking to say they even all but still looking and searching and they don't know what they're looking and searching for I remember when we used to use drugs or drink a lot you will never sleep you will like you're looking for something you're walking around you're seeking for something like sometimes do bar will close down at 12: but still be not satisfied then we'll look for another bar that's still open till till late and you will walk and walk and walk without realizing why do you walk so far you will you you searching for something something and you don't know what you're looking from there without realizing it's Christ you're looking for and that's why I believe we have to have open Air Services we as Christians they have to advertise Jesus Christ because people are thirsty people are seeking people are looking and they don't know that they're actually looking for Jesus Christ you cannot satisfy your soul with with drinking smoking and World things the only thing you can satisfy your soul is with Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit PR sure back to what you were saying earlier about when you were out partying and drinking and stuff and um talking about like someone coming up and like preaching to you whatever that doesn't help you at all yeah and me and benjin have experienced this kind of sort of the same thing cuz uh we play a lot of like softball together and stuff and we have a lot of friends on our teams you know that don't know anything about the Lord or if they think it's very little and instead of you know going up to them and preaching about what they're doing wrong and how they should be living we usually just don't say anything and let the Lord be a light through us and I would say nine times out of 10 someone will come up to us be like all right what's different about you like what there's definitely something about y'all that draws us to you what is different and then that way through that we're able to share with them yeah the best thing is to live the life and like you did this it's wisdom because a sinner don't want you to to preach to them and neck on them they want them as brother says live a life yeah that will make them thirsty we are the salt of the of the world we must make them thirsty MH that's why we have to make Christianity so exciting like you said now they must say wait something is missing why do you guys look like this why do you guys look so happy and exciting because what we have you cannot go by it you know at a bar or wherever what we have you need to get it by Christ but you need a life that's exciting that's attractive and attracting people to Jesus Christ because we are a billboard basically you know when people look at us we we are advertising something for sure and we have to just live that life and that will dra people and make them thirsty uh to to be like you like with me and my wife now we make it we make Christianity so exciting when we go to them balls or wherever you know people say wow what is it about you guys we just you know but you have to draw them to Jesus Christ and at the same time God will be there to to to provide whatever is needed I told our brothers we had a very poor church only this year God started to bless our church and I told the church you know if we can only know if God can trust us what cause money houses and we can use that for God that people will be thrown to that because they have to be an attraction and right now most of the churches in our areas is doing what we are doing they also traveling now with tents and they also want to go out in young people even out lately now a lot of gangsters most of the top gangsters in the uh the gangsters children they all come to our church wow even even even gang leaders are calling us listen I don't want my child to smoke drugs because I use drugs and he's a gang leader he would say can't you take my child to church to your church I want my child to go to your church wow because I can see you are busy with God you're not playing because you must remember many people in the gospel are playing with the gospel they are fooling around and um you cannot lie to the people the people can see who's really living the life for sure and who's not living the life so um at the moment now we are doing very good in our area it's very very good and we are also it's inspiring other churches to do also the same and uh we don't encourage people to leave their churches you know God's chosen place of worship and that's why many of the leaders in our area respect us because we respect them as brother Benham taught us to respect other churches but eventually you know people just say no we want to be here we want to be in the church like that's traveling that's going around because uh HEI chapter 2 says a wonderful thing he says the desires of the Nations will come to the house of the Lord he said the silver and the gold Belongs to the Lord you know and he said all the Treasures of the world world he will bring to the house of God our kids used to run to all the to the gangsters because they had the cars they had the money they had everything and in our area right now God is giving the church everything so now the people is running to the church you know there's an attraction to the church so we are so busy and so exciting with this even my trip coming here is very encouraging there's even by me flying here even worthly people calls us and send messages W can God do that I want to travel I want to go to places I want to see America all things are possible if you just uh Surrender Your Life to Jesus Christ and I used to tell the people when I was drinking and smoking I would meet people and I might not have money to go to another city but by with drinking by drinking with this man he would tell me listen come with me tonight or come let's go to that place that place you know so by drinking I met friends to travel but now I tell the people you don't need I I told him wine and alcohol and drugs took me places but with Jesus Christ I can go further and deeper and higher I mean look yeah I'm in America by this Grace you know we would see America on the TV and say we only saw it on the TV and said wow wow I wish I never thought we going to be in America one day you know but by the grace of God it just shows people it shows I want to encourage people to if you s end your life to God he can give you a beautiful wife he could give you a beautiful he could give you a what whatever your heart desire but you have to serve him and the question is can God trust you for sure you know good because we want to do more for him and God have to trust us with more and I always tell when in our people preach about blessings and blessings but there's a scripture in Matthew 25 where it says that God bless you according to your ability he gave talents according to Ability so I told the church work on your ability can God trust us and if God can trust us God can bless us and God can use those blessings to do more for God and that's what we want to do we want to shut down drug houses we want to shut down uh whatever material there is to do sin and and to entertain sin we want to shut down at the moment now there's a lot of nightclubs that's closing really um and and and the people is telling us you can use this area to have church we're not going to we're not going to use this as a nightclub anymore so you can take it you can do whatever if you want to have church and obviously we prayed about it and there's people coming now and say listen we don't want to use this place uh for sin anymore please you guys can use it for for the Youth you can take this for the Youth or use this for the things of of God because people are realizing that like Solomon said it's vanity or vanity worldly things and to be busy with sin it will only demote you yeah but I we even now have a guy he's been a gangster his whole life and he said listen I I can't live like this I just want to do something for God I've messed up a lot of communities I've messed up a lot of things in my life and uh it's amazing how God just work and provide for himself you know it's amazing uh do y'all have a lot of Youth in y''s church you did yeah yeah we do have I think half of our church is youth oh it's awesome that's awesome it's nice to have a a balanced church we have old people and a lot of young married couples at the moment now um a lot of our youth is getting married and it's a good thing just many young uh a strong church is a um is when you have married couples you have to have a strong family to have a strong Church so that's what's happening in our church now and there's one guy his father was one of the biggest gangsters in the Western Cape biggest biggest gangsters his father died and they killed his father and he was like the right hand man but two three years ago he gave his life to the Lord served with us and he couldn't believe um must I only have one woman in my life because his father used to have a lot of woman and he said no I must have a lot of woman I must have more than one and he came to church we used to go to school together and he said I can't believe the two of you um do do you only have one wife and I said no the Bible says You must one have one wife and the people in our area couldn't believe it he gave his life to the Lord he got married I think his baby is now a few months old and he's so dedicated to God he's so he he loves God with everything that's in him people couldn't couldn't believe that he changed his life just like that and he's serving God and he's got one wife now and he says no I I never knew you know you have to be that's actually a man a real man is a man that can have only one wife sure you know and a Sanctified life and look after his children and his family because that's very very important and that's what we want to do we want as a church we have we're not only a church for our church we are there for the community we are there to to bring changes in people's lives God bless some of our brothers in our chch with with nice cars so now uh uh I think last week there was a lot of matrick balls um basically it uh the great 12 came to the end of the year and then they have a function where they they go out to the school with they uh TR stop obviously and they have like a like a bowl I don't know if you have yeah it's like for us it we call like a prom prom that's right with a prom yeah so they had the prom and all these young kids know you know their mothers are so poor they they don't have cars too because obviously everybody's standing outside and they have to come and drive in with a car and things like that so Brothers in out CHS you know they went to the community and say whatever your children need we will drive we will take them we look after them so basically everybody in now Church to use their cars to take the children to the promise and you know those kids said wow no we want to come to your church we want to you know and they were so thankful they were so thankful yeah we did it for free we said listen we just want to Y our community and reach out to our community and it it I'm it it means a lot to people it means really and that just a little bit of kindness a little bit of kindness to bring a handful of people to y''s church and for them to surrender yeah because you have to understand some of these kids don't have fathers they don't have mothers the grandparents raise them they have no money there's nothing but um like I said the best opportunity is to serve God and people have to grab that and when you have Christ you got everything you don't do we don't do church with money we do Church By Faith so every we do every 10 Revival every service every says God likes a man that can take the challenge everything we do we do it by faith I always tell the people money don't bring Faith but Faith brings money and whatever we need we we do it by faith so what we need we don't need a new job or a better car better house what you need is Faith and when you have faith you can have your house your job your promotion whatever you need in life so the greatest the greatest crisis we have I preach on on it the faith crisis the the greatest crisis we have is not a job crisis or a financial crisis or whatever oil crisis the biggest crisis we have today according to the word of God is a faith crisis sure so people need Faith cuz Jesus says in his word if I come when I find Faith you know so faith is the most important thing that we need in today and it's a weapon basically so if you have faith I always tell people you don't need a new car you don't need a chop you don't need nothing you need faith and Romans chap 10 says faith cometh by hearing and no man can preach unless he's sinned by God and that's what the Bible says you cannot hear without a preacher and a preacher cannot come unless he s so not any preacher produces Faith a sin preacher produces Faith so people need to come under a preacher that sent from God like brother B was sent from God and that's why there was healing there was faith for healing there was faithful first po second po third po because um he was a sent preacher from and after brother I I think we need more s men get s from God and you definitely have to have a revelation of who your pastor and you know where you have to go to church is too exactly very important because your pastor will see you through for sure you know even the lifestyle and even the way your every Pastor is raised up in and the things you goes through life the storms and the battles and The Valleys you will see how it will t with people that will come in his life or the their parts will cross with each other and that Pastor will have the answer to that people because he went through things in life that basically uh Conn next them to that person and that's why you need a revelation of your pastor definitely that's important well do you have anything else on your heart that you'd like to share with us well I think do you I think that's
