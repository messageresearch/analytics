[0:00] We waste too much time,
[0:03] &gt;&gt; worried over over what we can't change,
[0:06] what we can't stop,
[0:08] &gt;&gt; what we can't prevent.
[0:12] We waste too much time trying to do what
[0:14] we're not called to do, what we forget
[0:17] doing,
[0:18] &gt;&gt; what we're called to be doing.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; We run around in circles like gerbles
[0:26] &gt;&gt; to keep our hands busy.
[0:30] While the while the destiny scrolls of
[0:32] the kingdom are just drifting down
[0:35] around us and we're not grabbing
[0:38] something,
[0:40] we stay separated from God's program for
[0:43] our lives.
[0:45] Is there anybody in this house that
[0:47] would say, "I have wasted time.
[0:50] I've wasted weeks. I've wasted months."
[0:53] Some of you might even say, "I've wasted
[0:54] years." And if you let the burden of
[0:57] that get too heavy on your shoulder, you
[1:00] won't be able to walk. You won't be able
[1:02] to praise the Lord.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; And so, you've got to believe that what
[1:04] the scripture says is true. That by by
[1:07] the grace of the atonement, we can
[1:09] actually buy back.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Forfeited destiny.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; That we did not accomplish and walk in
[1:20] because we were wasting time
[1:22] &gt;&gt; when we should have been buying more
[1:24] time. And that's not with money. That's
[1:26] with doing.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; Because if you'll do what he called you
[1:30] to do, he'll use you
[1:33] &gt;&gt; in ways you've never been used before.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; And when you're in the permissive will
[1:37] of God, your harvest is proportionate.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; But when you're in the perfect will of
[1:44] God, your harvest is proportionate.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; There's an extra oil. There's an extra
[1:50] oil. There's an extra abundance that's
[1:52] added to what we accomplish when we're
[1:54] doing the perfect will of God
[1:57] &gt;&gt; because we have recognized that this is
[1:59] a season. It's a it's a chyros moment.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; There are two kinds of time. Kronos and
[2:04] Cyros or Chyros we say. Chyros in Greek.
[2:10] And Kronos time is what you can tell on
[2:12] the watch and what you can tell on the
[2:14] on the clock on the wall.
[2:17] But chyros time,
[2:20] it's set time. It's appointed time. It's
[2:25] an appointment with an individual, with
[2:28] a church, with a ministry, with a
[2:30] nation.
[2:34] And when you discover the set time, the
[2:38] appointed time, then you have to
[2:40] discover what is the purpose of this
[2:42] time.
[2:44] If we're in a new spiritual season, what
[2:47] is the purpose of this new spiritual
[2:50] season? And that's what we put our hands
[2:51] to.
[2:54] I'm here.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; I will not be denied.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; I believe the same God that met my
[3:00] fathers, the same God who met my
[3:02] grandfathers, the same God who met my
[3:04] great-grandfathers will meet me. And
[3:07] instead of just waiting on him to track
[3:08] me down and nail my hide to the wall
[3:13] &gt;&gt; so he can help me,
[3:15] &gt;&gt; I'll just run to him. And I'll recognize
[3:18] that there's a turning point. There's a
[3:21] divine pivot. It's a moment of decision.
[3:25] I'm at a spiritual crossroads.
[3:29] And I'm I'm being challenged to put my
[3:32] priority back in the word.
[3:35] And then it's up to you.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "We've gone as far
[3:39] with God as we're ever going to go until
[3:40] we're willing to pay a greater price."
[3:43] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "But you don't know.
[3:45] I can't hardly pay my power bill. I've
[3:47] got problems in my children. I've got
[3:49] problems in my family." Yes. Maybe we do
[3:52] know. Maybe we don't know. But I'll tell
[3:53] you what we do know. He's the answer.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Revival in your heart is the answer. A
[4:00] refill of the Holy Ghost in your life is
[4:04] the answer.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Spending time before the throne in
[4:10] worship and adoration,
[4:13] &gt;&gt; that's the answer.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of the problem and get
[4:17] them on the problem solver. His name is
[4:20] Jesus.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
