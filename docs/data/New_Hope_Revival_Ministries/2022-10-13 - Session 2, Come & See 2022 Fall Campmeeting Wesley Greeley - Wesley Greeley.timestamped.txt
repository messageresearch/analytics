[23:25] he lifted High
[23:28] foreign
[23:35] [Music]
[23:42] he deserves to be lifted up
[23:46] brother Greeley did such a fine job last
[23:48] night
[23:49] explaining
[23:51] why we sometimes are praying over people
[23:54] in another language
[23:56] It's a Wonderful explanation
[23:58] the spirit of the Lord has been dealing
[24:00] with me today because I know that some
[24:02] of you visitors and some of you
[24:04] streaming the service will have
[24:05] questions about our worship
[24:07] that's all right
[24:09] where we understand that it might be a
[24:11] little unusual for what you're used to
[24:14] I understand that not offended by that
[24:17] at all now don't come in here like a
[24:19] Critic
[24:20] but come in with an open heart
[24:24] one of the questions that we get asked
[24:26] more than anything is what are these
[24:27] flags and rags and all these things that
[24:31] people are waving well I don't wait I
[24:33] don't usually use one myself
[24:36] but I want to read you a portion of
[24:38] scripture how many of you'd like to know
[24:39] whether it's scriptural or not
[24:43] where they don't do it around the
[24:44] message I I didn't ask you what they do
[24:48] around I said let's see what the Bible
[24:49] says
[24:51] let's see what the scriptures say
[24:53] they may be missing out on something
[24:59] in a Song of Solomon or Song of Songs
[25:01] chapter 6 verse 4 in King James it says
[25:05] Thou Art beautiful o my love
[25:08] as tisra calmly as Jerusalem terrible as
[25:13] an army
[25:15] with banners
[25:18] the complete Jewish Bible said you are
[25:20] as beautiful as tertza my love as lovely
[25:23] as yerushalayim but formidable as an
[25:26] army marching under banners so the
[25:29] waving of a banner or a flag is a symbol
[25:32] of strength and might
[25:34] in Psalm 20 and verse 5 it says we will
[25:38] this is Amplified it says we will shout
[25:41] in Triumph at your salvation and victory
[25:46] and in the name of our God we will set
[25:49] up banners
[25:51] may the Lord fulfill all your petitions
[25:56] and in the complete Jewish Bible it says
[25:59] same verse then we will shout for Joy at
[26:02] your Victory and fly our flags in the
[26:05] name of our God
[26:11] in Celebration
[26:15] 40 but but I'll just give you three
[26:17] tonight
[26:19] in Isaiah 62 10 it says go through go
[26:22] through the gates prepare ye the way of
[26:25] the people
[26:26] cast up cast up the highway gather out
[26:30] the stones lift up a standard for the
[26:35] people
[26:37] now that word Stander in the Hebrew is
[26:39] banner and that's why the complete
[26:42] Jewish Bible renders that go on through
[26:44] go on through the gates clear the way
[26:47] for the people build up a highway build
[26:50] it up clear away the stones raise a
[26:53] banner for the peoples
[26:56] so sometimes when you see somebody
[26:58] waving a banner or a flag they are
[27:00] welcoming the Lord to come in and do
[27:03] whatever it is so it may not be your cup
[27:06] of tea
[27:08] you may like orange pickle
[27:12] I might like Darjeeling
[27:14] but it's both tea
[27:16] you don't have to like the flavor of tea
[27:19] that I like I don't have to like the
[27:21] flavor of tea you like but we got to
[27:23] keep it in the Bible
[27:24] isn't that right
[27:26] and so I didn't know so many of you
[27:28] would be doing this tonight but this is
[27:30] what the Lord laid on my heart I want us
[27:32] to sing that again lift him up
[27:35] raise him up
[27:37] in the old church we used to get our
[27:39] hankies out and do what they called a
[27:41] wave offering to the lord it's the same
[27:43] kind of principle it's a flag of
[27:46] surrender sometime and it's a flag of
[27:48] Celebration another time
[27:51] if you don't have a hanky to wave the
[27:53] Bible said I would that men everywhere
[27:55] would lift up holy hands
[27:58] without wrath and without doubt
[28:01] but I don't know about all that dancing
[28:03] David knew about it he said praise the
[28:06] Lord in the dance
[28:07] [Applause]
[28:09] somebody said well I don't know about
[28:11] the drums the Bible says praise the Lord
[28:13] on the high sounding symbols
[28:17] let everything that have breath praise
[28:20] the Lord
[28:23] so use what you have tonight and let's
[28:27] lift him up
[28:29] [Music]
[28:32] he lifted High
[28:36] be lifted High
[28:45] For Your Glory be lifted High

[44:10] no Shout
[44:15] unto God
[44:17] with a voice
[44:20] of Triumph
[44:22] [Applause]
[44:24] let's just keep it biblical
[44:28] amen
[44:29] amen I tell you David wouldn't fit in a
[44:33] lot of our churches
[44:36] because one day he stripped off his
[44:38] Royal robe
[44:40] right down to his linen if look just a
[44:43] linen tunic and began to dance before
[44:46] the Lord with all of his might
[44:50] there's always going to be someone to
[44:52] despise your praise might be your
[44:55] husband
[44:57] might be your wife
[45:00] might be your preacher
[45:04] there will always be somebody to despise
[45:06] your praise
[45:08] David didn't let it hinder him
[45:12] he said I just got to tell you
[45:14] sweetheart if you don't hold your peace
[45:18] what you've seen today is just the
[45:20] beginning
[45:21] the next time I turn loose I'm really
[45:24] going to turn loose I'm going to praise
[45:27] God because the Ark of the Covenant has
[45:29] been restored to the people and the
[45:32] presence of God is back in the camp
[45:36] the Bible said shouts of Joy ReSound in
[45:40] the tents of the righteous of the Lord
[45:43] the Lord's right arm has done Mighty
[45:47] things for us the Lord's right arm
[45:51] Hallelujah
[45:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[45:58] Hallelujah
[46:01] [Applause]
[46:04] you say well well isn't there some
[46:06] emotion in that I sure hope so
[46:10] I sure hope so the prophet said if
[46:12] there's no emotion in your religion
[46:16] it's dead
[46:18] only one thing left to do with that kind
[46:20] of religion
[46:22] bury it
[46:24] you know he told us what a grave is
[46:27] he said it's a rut with both ends kicked
[46:30] out of it and a lot of us have found
[46:32] ourselves in Roots
[46:34] that have really become Graves
[46:37] come on we're laying like Lazarus
[46:39] stinking
[46:41] but there's a voice of Deliverance in
[46:43] our inner there's a voice of Deliverance
[46:46] there's a little voice that's saying
[46:48] little bride arise Lazarus
[46:51] come forth
[46:53] it's your time to sing it's your time to
[46:56] praise him he's wonderful and worthy to
[46:58] be praised would you give something to
[47:01] the Lord tonight is in the way of an
[47:03] offering to support this meeting and the
[47:05] rest of the meeting and may God bless
[47:08] you brother Greeley it's a local
[47:10] minister with us of course associate
[47:13] pastor but we're going to bless him we
[47:15] are not going to let him labor for us
[47:17] these nights without being blessed
[47:20] when he came in last night we had a a
[47:23] basket of goodies for him just like we
[47:25] prepare for the speaker others guest
[47:27] speakers that come in don't you think
[47:29] he's worthy and he deserves something I
[47:32] certainly do
[47:33] so we want to make sure that when the
[47:35] meeting is over that we have blessed him
[47:38] and that the needs of the meeting are
[47:40] met and we know that we had rain today
[47:43] we were very aware of that it's going to
[47:46] be a little wet outside but we're going
[47:48] to be real careful when we leave of
[47:49] course I know there's only one big
[47:51] puddle there at the edge of the tent
[47:53] we're going to dodge the puddle we're
[47:56] going to go under anyway and have
[47:57] fellowship and break bread together
[47:59] after this service is over it might be
[48:02] at 9 30 it might be at 11 30.
[48:06] I don't know when it'll be but sometime
[48:08] before breakfast time
[48:10] we will gather
[48:12] and so you asked the Lord what he would
[48:15] have you to give father we give our
[48:18] praise we give our attention we give our
[48:22] gifts the things that you have placed in
[48:24] our lives we give it back to you we
[48:27] offer it as an offering to you Lord and
[48:31] we understand that there is a law of
[48:35] sowing and reaping so I ask Lord that
[48:37] you would bless every seed that is given
[48:39] tonight toward the work of this meeting
[48:42] there there is no way of putting a value
[48:45] or a price on what God did last night
[48:49] there's no way to say we know that a
[48:52] word a soul is is more valuable than 10
[48:56] million worlds and so Lord we just ask
[48:59] that you would meet the need and we ask
[49:02] that you would bless back to the giver
[49:05] as your word has said press down shaken
[49:10] together and running over and we'll give
[49:14] you the honor and the glory and the
[49:16] praise for it's in the name of the Lord

[53:16] you may be seated again
[53:21] thank you brother Daniel
[53:23] for not making Elisha run by herself
[53:28] he's got some Battle Scars
[53:31] he was in my office before the service
[53:33] Elisha was and he's had a fall and he's
[53:36] all bummed up
[53:38] and yet he is running tonight for the
[53:41] Lord just a few Services ago he marched
[53:44] right up here at the end of the service
[53:45] he said pastor I've got a song
[53:48] [Music]
[53:50] so we gave it to him
[53:52] why those children don't know what
[53:55] they're doing
[53:56] listen folks you don't know that
[54:01] you don't know that just cause you're so
[54:04] dry
[54:07] really
[54:09] do you do you do you wanna do you want
[54:12] to teach the children to sit on the seat
[54:15] and look like they've been baptized in
[54:17] pickle juice
[54:20] or do you want to lead them
[54:23] right
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:26] or do you want to lead them you want to
[54:29] lead them to praise
[54:31] I want to lead them to praise
[54:34] you know some of us are having the
[54:35] hardest time getting free
[54:38] I don't want these children
[54:43] I'm proud of my children
[54:46] all of you
[54:47] but we have four natural born children
[54:50] and I'm I'm thankful I'm thankful that
[54:54] they are not intimidated to worship God
[54:58] you can tell by Benjamin's worship
[55:00] leading
[55:01] that he enters in
[55:03] and they sent us a picture Jonathan was
[55:07] it Jonathan had it or sister uh Elita
[55:09] Senate but they sent us a picture of
[55:12] Benjamin when he was just a little boy
[55:13] in his face is just wet with tears and
[55:16] he's entered right into the presence of
[55:19] the Lord is just a wee little one
[55:21] so don't you have very much to say about
[55:25] it and if you do do not have it to say
[55:28] in front of me
[55:31] because I would much rather them begin
[55:33] to soften up
[55:39] so that they don't ever have to take so
[55:43] much time to get set free from religion
[55:50] it's right it's right and some of you
[55:53] know it because you've come from places
[55:56] that are worse than Frozen
[55:59] so anyway that's my two cents I guess I
[56:02] sound like I'm mad I'm not mad
[56:04] I just want them to have their Liberty
[56:07] tonight
[56:08] if it gets too out of line don't you
[56:11] worry I know how
[56:12] to take it down a notch or two
[56:15] but it's going to have to be pretty wild
[56:21] before I do
[56:22] I don't want you judging my praise and I
[56:25] don't want to judge yours
[56:27] you can sit as still as you want to and
[56:29] I'm not going to judge your walk with
[56:31] God I'm not
[56:32] but I want you to have Liberty you've
[56:34] come here you might as well enjoy
[56:36] yourself
[56:37] you know I've been fighting an awful
[56:39] headache today just rebuking it and
[56:41] resisting it it'll go away and try to
[56:43] come back and during during praise and
[56:46] worship when we were singing there at
[56:47] the beginning of Praise I thought you
[56:50] know what I'm not only entering into the
[56:52] presence of the Lord but I'm having fun
[56:55] you know I don't I don't do a lot of
[56:57] fishing and I don't do a lot of hunting
[56:59] and I know that's not very spiritual not
[57:02] to hunt and fish around the message but
[57:04] I don't do a lot of that I don't have
[57:06] many hobbies
[57:08] you know I don't I don't paint I used to
[57:10] do yard work
[57:12] and now it looks like a jungle so I
[57:14] guess I don't do that anymore
[57:16] so I don't I don't I'm not a big ball
[57:18] fan and
[57:20] I I don't do a lot of things to have fun
[57:22] but isn't it a wonderful thought
[57:25] that you can be in the house of God and
[57:28] actually enjoy being there
[57:31] actually enjoy it I I do this word fun
[57:34] because I don't want to offend you but I
[57:35] I was having fun and it was clean fun
[57:40] nobody was telling some old off-colored
[57:43] joke
[57:45] it was clean fun
[57:47] and I'm thankful for it well can you

[1:15:18] I would like to prophesy to you that God
[1:15:21] is up to something
[1:15:23] and it's up to something big
[1:15:27] far above our imagination
[1:15:30] said that he would come to us
[1:15:33] and he is doing it he is doing it he's
[1:15:36] he's accelerating us and he's raising us
[1:15:39] up above what we have been and this
[1:15:42] scripture keeps coming back to me it
[1:15:44] keeps coming back to me the spirit of
[1:15:47] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[1:15:51] anointed me
[1:15:53] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:15:58] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:16:03] he has sent me to preach the Deliverance
[1:16:07] to the captives and the recovering of
[1:16:11] sight to the blind to set at Liberty
[1:16:15] them that are bruised to preach the
[1:16:20] acceptable
[1:16:22] year of the Lord
[1:16:25] I would like to prophesy to you that
[1:16:29] 2022 is the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:16:35] that he invited you to come and see what
[1:16:40] he would do among us and that he would
[1:16:43] come and that he would bind up the
[1:16:46] Brokenhearted
[1:16:49] there are people whose Hearts have been
[1:16:53] broken from one issue or another in life
[1:16:58] and my God is here tonight to heal up
[1:17:02] the Brokenhearted
[1:17:07] I Feel That Fire coming
[1:17:11] but I don't know what to do with
[1:17:16] but I don't know what broke your heart
[1:17:20] I don't know what broke you down I don't
[1:17:24] know what caused you to get in the fix
[1:17:26] that you may stand or sit here tonight
[1:17:29] but the holy spirit is calling to you to
[1:17:33] lift up your hand and say Lord I allow
[1:17:37] you to heal my broken heart
[1:17:44] I cannot look inside of you unless by
[1:17:48] the spirit of discerning of spirits I
[1:17:51] cannot see inside of you to know what
[1:17:54] may have broken your heart but I know
[1:17:57] the Holy Ghost who heals the Broken
[1:18:00] Heart
[1:18:02] and he knows how to deliver his children
[1:18:06] out of all of the bondage that that
[1:18:09] broken heart has put you in
[1:18:11] and I would encourage you not to live
[1:18:13] another moment with a broken heart
[1:18:18] or the condition that you have suffered
[1:18:22] because of a broken heart
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:25] friends we've been taught for many many
[1:18:28] years that anxieties and these types of
[1:18:31] things that deal with our emotions they
[1:18:34] lead to a physical condition
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:39] and some of you sitting here tonight are
[1:18:42] in a physical condition because a broken
[1:18:46] heart or a wounded Spirit was never
[1:18:49] dealt with
[1:18:50] and so you deal with physical conditions
[1:18:53] the breaking down of your physical body
[1:18:56] but I'm here to tell the that the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit has come tonight to deliver us
[1:19:02] out of all of our troubles to Deliver Us

[1:19:28] have turned into cancerous cells

[1:19:39] and they're leading to your demise
[1:19:42] they're leading to your death
[1:19:46] and I'm calling on the Holy Ghost right
[1:19:48] now
[1:19:50] calling on the Holy Ghost right now
[1:19:53] to come
[1:19:54] and bind up the Brokenhearted
[1:19:58] and to deliver those that have been
[1:20:01] bruised

[1:24:17] you have come to heal the brokenhearted
[1:24:19] Lord
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:24] it is not your will
[1:24:27] that any should perish
[1:24:30] but that all should come
[1:24:34] to the knowledge of the truth that
[1:24:35] should come to repentance
[1:24:37] Lord I believe it's your will for your
[1:24:41] elect lady
[1:24:43] to come to a place where the broken
[1:24:46] heart is no longer dictating every move
[1:24:50] that they make causing them to go to
[1:24:54] continue hurting other people
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:25:01] cause their hearts have been broken
[1:25:04] they break others hearts
[1:25:07] because their hearts are broken
[1:25:11] anger comes out
[1:25:13] and so Lord I'm asking you right now
[1:25:17] by the sovereignty of the move of God as
[1:25:21] you have come in this place and the
[1:25:24] angels are here and you are walking
[1:25:26] amongst us that you would go to the
[1:25:29] Brokenhearted and that you would heal it
[1:25:32] O Lord

[1:25:57] there is fear
[1:26:00] that if you ever let go it's gonna be
[1:26:03] messy
[1:26:05] there is fear
[1:26:07] that you will be held more accountable
[1:26:09] than you've been in the past
[1:26:12] there is fear that you will have to
[1:26:15] straighten up and live a different life
[1:26:20] but the Holy Ghost
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:24] has not given you the spirit of fear

[1:26:51] of fear in the name of the Lord Jesus

[1:29:49] really
[1:29:51] can they really live
[1:29:53] they're dry and they're white
[1:29:57] they don't look like they have any life
[1:29:59] in them
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:02] but when the prophet looked upon them he
[1:30:06] said Lord you know
[1:30:09] and then he began to watch
[1:30:12] as these bones began to get some sinew
[1:30:16] on them
[1:30:17] some muscle some tissue
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] there was no more white of the bones
[1:30:24] [Music]
[1:30:27] there was no evidence of the bloody war
[1:30:30] that had put them in that condition
[1:30:33] there was no evidence of how they got to
[1:30:36] get in that graveyard to start with
[1:30:39] but they began to look like
[1:30:41] there was something to them
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:46] and all of a sudden
[1:30:49] the ruach of God
[1:30:52] the glory of God the Breath of God came
[1:30:57] and got right in that Army he breathed
[1:31:00] into that Army and it rose up a mighty
[1:31:03] Army before the Living God
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:08] you may feel like a bag of bones tonight
[1:31:12] as I said you may be feeling bruised
[1:31:16] and wounded
[1:31:18] and bloody and torn
[1:31:21] and it feels like that you have no
[1:31:24] energy left you I feel like that you
[1:31:26] have nothing left to give but the ruach
[1:31:30] the breath of the Holy Ghost is here in
[1:31:34] the house tonight to breathe in you the
[1:31:38] Breath of Life
[1:31:40] foreign
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:47] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:56] you may say preacher
[1:31:59] I really want what you're talking about
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:03] I really would like to have what you're
[1:32:05] talking about
[1:32:06] but I don't feel a thing
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:10] well I would like to inform you
[1:32:13] that this is not about feelings
[1:32:16] I would like to inform you that you have
[1:32:20] been called as the Seed of Abraham
[1:32:23] and Abraham walked day by day by day and
[1:32:27] he could not see the promise before him
[1:32:30] it looked like that his body was as good
[1:32:34] as dead and Sarah's was as well but one
[1:32:38] day El Shaddai came by one day the
[1:32:41] spirit of God dropped in and where there
[1:32:44] appeared to be no life you see Abraham
[1:32:47] had to put one step in front of the
[1:32:50] other and it was a walk of Faith there
[1:32:52] was really no feeling to it he just held
[1:32:55] on to the promise Lord you said
[1:33:02] I can't give you salvation
[1:33:05] that's the first step
[1:33:08] calling upon the name of the Lord
[1:33:11] he that calls upon the name of the Lord
[1:33:13] shall be saved I cannot give it to you
[1:33:16] but by faith you can reach up and say
[1:33:19] Lord I don't want to be lost I don't
[1:33:23] want to go someplace where the Believers
[1:33:27] are not there then they're not there I
[1:33:29] want to be with the Believers and all
[1:33:31] you have to do is call on the name of
[1:33:33] the Lord but oh when the something gets
[1:33:36] down burning on the inside after you've
[1:33:39] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:33:42] Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:33:45] you because that's a promise of Acts
[1:33:48] chapter 2 when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:33:50] you because you've repented because
[1:33:53] you've been baptized in the name of the
[1:33:56] Lord Jesus Christ it says you shall
[1:33:59] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:05] now if you've never received the baptism
[1:34:07] of the Holy Ghost my Lord Jesus is here
[1:34:10] tonight to fill you with his very own
[1:34:13] life
[1:34:14] that same spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:34:17] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:34:20] your mortal bodies
[1:34:27] but uh just in case
[1:34:30] you're just starting on your journey
[1:34:32] I would like you to know that there are
[1:34:34] believers here that have been walking
[1:34:36] this way for a long time that have
[1:34:39] gotten beaten and battered along the way
[1:34:42] and some have let the Holy Ghost leak
[1:34:44] out
[1:34:45] [Music]
[1:34:46] they've let it leak out because the
[1:34:48] things of Life came against them
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] they were wounded they were bruised they
[1:34:56] were beat down they were kicked in the
[1:34:59] side and left for dead alongside of the
[1:35:01] road but the Holy Ghost is here tonight
[1:35:05] to take all of that
[1:35:08] from the new believer or the old
[1:35:11] believer he's here to take and fill you
[1:35:14] up once again and let the sav of the
[1:35:17] Holy Ghost
[1:35:19] wash down through you
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:25] and again
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:27] if you don't feel nothing
[1:35:29] [Music]
[1:35:33] just let your faith reach up
[1:35:37] let your faith reach up
[1:35:40] because he's here
[1:35:42] he's here
[1:35:46] he wants to save
[1:35:48] he wants to deliver
[1:35:51] he wants to set free
[1:35:55] I would encourage you
[1:36:01] don't hold on to that stuff
[1:36:04] don't hold on to it
[1:36:07] oh my friends tonight
[1:36:12] Let Freedom Ring in your life
[1:36:16] say God I realize I don't have to hold
[1:36:20] on to that that woundedness doesn't have
[1:36:23] to be my identity any longer that rage
[1:36:28] doesn't have to be my identity any
[1:36:31] longer it does not I can have a new
[1:36:35] identity in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:39] because he comes to seek and to save
[1:36:43] that which was lost that which is gone
[1:36:46] astray that which has been beaten
[1:36:48] battered and wounded
[1:36:51] foreign
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] of the Lord is upon me
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:58] because
[1:37:00] he has anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:37:05] to the poor
[1:37:08] you've heard the gospel tonight
[1:37:11] you've heard the gospel
[1:37:14] the lovely Lord Jesus Is Right Here
[1:37:17] Among Us
[1:37:18] to minister to what need you have
[1:37:22] it may not look like what we thought it
[1:37:24] was going to look like
[1:37:27] but he's here
[1:37:32] one more time I'm going to call on
[1:37:33] brother Josh to sing a little bit more
[1:37:35] of this
[1:37:37] yeah absolutely absolutely
[1:37:42] but I believe
[1:37:44] that our Lord can meet you
[1:37:51] some he already has
[1:37:55] but if you've been resisting
[1:37:59] don't resist him
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] don't resist him
[1:38:09] those of you that are familiar with the
[1:38:11] scripture
[1:38:14] there was once a man named Saul
[1:38:18] he was quite an educated man
[1:38:23] he was
[1:38:25] part of the
[1:38:28] upper echelon
[1:38:31] the Jewish faith
[1:38:33] well-respected well-educated
[1:38:38] but God already had his name
[1:38:42] written down
[1:38:44] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:48] there was one day when that man saw
[1:38:51] was going down
[1:38:53] to persecute the Believers
[1:38:58] and as he was going down to persecute
[1:39:01] the Believers
[1:39:03] because they weren't doing religion the
[1:39:05] way he thought that they ought to
[1:39:08] a bunch of fanatics
[1:39:11] shouting and speaking in tongues crazy
[1:39:14] bunch
[1:39:16] gonna go down there and take care of
[1:39:17] them I'm going to put them in prison I'm
[1:39:19] going to take care of them
[1:39:21] but God already had
[1:39:24] in mind
[1:39:26] that Paul
[1:39:28] was going to be one of those
[1:39:32] that were shouting and speaking in
[1:39:34] tongues and glorifying God and preaching
[1:39:37] the Deliverance through the name of the
[1:39:38] Lord Jesus Christ so all of the sudden
[1:39:41] and light comes to him
[1:39:44] and knocks him off of his horse
[1:39:47] and as it knocks him off the horse
[1:39:51] Paul was smart enough to recognize eyes
[1:39:54] say who are you Lord
[1:39:59] and here's the phrase I wanted to get to
[1:40:02] because some of you are doing the same
[1:40:05] thing
[1:40:06] it's hard for you to kick against the
[1:40:08] pricks
[1:40:11] The Nest has got a little bit prickly
[1:40:14] and you keep kicking at that nest trying
[1:40:18] to get comfortable you're trying to get
[1:40:21] comfortable in that old nest but I'm
[1:40:25] calling to you little eagle
[1:40:28] I'm calling to you little Eagle bust out
[1:40:32] of that Nest it's hard for you to kick
[1:40:35] against the bricks
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:40] come
[1:40:42] follow me saith the Lord of hosts
[1:40:46] come follow me it may not look like what
[1:40:48] you want it to
[1:40:51] it may not look like what you thought it
[1:40:53] ought to but I have paid a dear price
[1:40:58] that you could lead in Freedom
[1:41:03] oh Jesus
[1:41:06] [Music]

[1:57:18] through the night
[1:57:20] until they're giving in to what the
[1:57:23] spirit of the Lord desires on their life
[1:57:27] God that there would not be one
[1:57:30] who would come to the house of the Lord
[1:57:32] with critical attitude with resistance
[1:57:36] with I don't understand this but they
[1:57:40] would encounter the Living God

[2:15:12] sin Grace
[2:15:15] to trust you more
[2:15:22] it's not what we need
[2:15:25] how many of you know that's what we need
[2:15:26] more grace
[2:15:29] to trust him
[2:15:33] you just can't get it all done
[2:15:36] in one night
[2:15:39] my What the Lord Has Done
[2:15:42] help me now
[2:15:45] my What the Lord Has Done you can be
[2:15:47] seated you'll be seated we're leaving
[2:15:49] but I think you've been standing a long
[2:15:52] time
[2:15:57] now
[2:15:58] I don't think anyone has a I don't feel
[2:16:01] any bad spirits
[2:16:04] I'm sure there must be one lurking
[2:16:06] somewhere
[2:16:09] in somebody's pocket
[2:16:11] but I I
[2:16:14] feel like that you folk have done so
[2:16:17] well
[2:16:18] considering that some of you might not
[2:16:20] be used to this kind of a meeting
[2:16:23] I'd suppose that internet connections
[2:16:25] were disconnecting all over the world
[2:16:31] but sometimes it has to be about those
[2:16:34] who stand before you
[2:16:37] so let me just say a couple of things
[2:16:40] one
[2:16:41] brother Branham told us that no service
[2:16:44] is complete
[2:16:46] without the reading of the word
[2:16:48] in the receiving of an offering
[2:16:51] I read six scriptures
[2:16:55] check
[2:17:00] we're like all the other churches we're
[2:17:02] not going to miss a chance to receive an
[2:17:04] offering
[2:17:05] check
[2:17:10] thank you
[2:17:11] so let's let's be alright
[2:17:14] I know brother Greeley enough to know
[2:17:16] that this was God
[2:17:19] and his wife is sitting here who's known
[2:17:22] him
[2:17:23] longer than I have by by a little while
[2:17:28] you mean when I met you the first time
[2:17:30] you had not met her
[2:17:32] well
[2:17:38] I've known your husband longer than you
[2:17:41] have
[2:17:44] he might be a lot of things but he's not
[2:17:46] about pretense
[2:17:48] or heirs
[2:17:50] and he believes the truth of the message
[2:17:55] and he wouldn't do anything tonight to
[2:17:57] try to pull away from that and I feel
[2:18:00] that he had every intention of bringing
[2:18:03] a sermon tonight
[2:18:05] and if you really needed a sermon come
[2:18:07] back tomorrow night
[2:18:09] and he'll he might bring you one
[2:18:17] I believe it
[2:18:19] I believe it I believe we need it
[2:18:23] but we also need the Living Word
[2:18:27] to work Among Us
[2:18:29] and I know that God has spoken into
[2:18:31] people's lives and I know there are
[2:18:33] those who will leave here with
[2:18:35] everything not settled but you come back
[2:18:39] and you bring your faith
[2:18:41] and you press in with what you have to
[2:18:44] press in with and the same God who meant
[2:18:47] these tonight will meet you
[2:18:49] I don't understand why everybody doesn't
[2:18:52] get exactly what they look for every
[2:18:54] time I I have no theological explanation
[2:18:58] for that
[2:18:59] but I know that it's always for a reason
[2:19:02] and there are some things that we have
[2:19:05] to throw off of our life as we were
[2:19:07] hearing tonight there are things that we
[2:19:10] have to be willing to get rid of and lay
[2:19:12] down in emotions and feelings and
[2:19:14] thoughts and pretenses and prejudices
[2:19:17] and jealousies and all these things and
[2:19:20] sometimes it's a process God Is Lifting
[2:19:23] that off and taking that off and taking
[2:19:26] that off and taking that off
[2:19:28] so I wouldn't be discouraged in any way
[2:19:30] if I were you I would come back and I
[2:19:33] would press in with everything I have to
[2:19:35] press in with all my hallelujahs all my
[2:19:38] praise the Lords and all my faith and
[2:19:41] we're just getting started
[2:19:44] and I believe we're going to continue to
[2:19:46] go higher as God is honored and he is
[2:19:50] given the preeminence
[2:19:52] I want to invite all of you to have some
[2:19:55] fellowship with us tonight
[2:19:57] understanding that brother Greeley is is
[2:20:00] very tired and and uh let him have a
[2:20:03] little little bit of space to get his
[2:20:05] strength back if if he decides to stay
[2:20:08] with us
[2:20:09] pray for Benjamin that God will sustain
[2:20:12] his voice
[2:20:14] God will help him and I also could use a
[2:20:18] touch from the Lord physically tonight
[2:20:20] and he's my healer and he is more he
[2:20:24] touched me
[2:20:25] I got a touch from the Lord tonight
[2:20:28] and I'm believing I'm believing for the
[2:20:31] continuation of it and I know you are
[2:20:34] but we're going to dismiss tonight I
[2:20:36] feel like it it's time for us to do that
[2:20:38] could I ask you to stand one more time
[2:20:41] and we want to say again unless you
[2:20:44] unless you've got a second wind and you
[2:20:47] want to preach
[2:20:48] you certainly can
[2:20:50] is there something else you wanted to
[2:20:52] say before we go
[2:20:55] I know there's at least uh
[2:21:03] well I know that there well I know it's
[2:21:05] for tomorrow night of course
[2:21:07] I'm getting that I figured that out
[2:21:10] already
[2:21:14] I already got that figured out
[2:21:17] but I that's it one night at a time
[2:21:21] you know we can we but I want you to
[2:21:24] know this I know that there is a group
[2:21:27] of people here I don't want to say
[2:21:28] percentages because I'm not sure but I
[2:21:31] know there's a group of people here that
[2:21:32] would sit right back down
[2:21:34] and let him take his text I'm one of
[2:21:37] them
[2:21:38] sister Flo's already doing it
[2:21:43] we're going to save a little for
[2:21:45] tomorrow night
[2:21:46] Lord Jesus
[2:21:49] thank you seems very very very small
[2:21:55] for what you've done tonight
[2:21:57] that life it lights up our hearts
[2:22:01] That Glory that falls on the countenance
[2:22:05] of someone who has experienced your
[2:22:08] touch
[2:22:10] and Lord it's not about a feeling
[2:22:13] although I would thank you that I have
[2:22:15] felt you and and I thank you that others
[2:22:18] have felt you
[2:22:19] but it's not about a feeling it's not
[2:22:22] about an emotion
[2:22:23] not about a chill bump or anything like
[2:22:26] that it's about what you're doing in the
[2:22:29] inside
[2:22:31] and what you're doing in US is for
[2:22:34] eternity
[2:22:35] it's not for just one service but it's
[2:22:38] an eternal work you are truly changing
[2:22:41] us
[2:22:42] from glory to glory
[2:22:45] we are moving forward from strength to
[2:22:48] strength and from Faith to Faith and
[2:22:50] that's all because of your great love
[2:22:52] for us
[2:22:53] now Lord there are some of it joined us
[2:22:56] tonight who traveled all day to get here
[2:22:59] and their bodies are tired and their
[2:23:02] minds are tired and they need a touch
[2:23:04] that only you can give them as they
[2:23:06] sleep tonight
[2:23:08] and I don't want to undo anything that
[2:23:10] brother Greely has prayed concerning
[2:23:12] sleep but I will say Lord that those who
[2:23:16] are weary in their body you know how to
[2:23:19] rest them with or without sleep
[2:23:22] there is a rest that belongs to the
[2:23:25] people of God we know it's you we know
[2:23:27] it's the Lord Jesus but we also believe
[2:23:30] that you can supernaturally charge these
[2:23:33] bodies
[2:23:34] and we're asking you to do that so that
[2:23:37] when we gather here tomorrow night we're
[2:23:39] fresh again and we're ready to receive
[2:23:42] whatever you have for us
[2:23:44] and so Lord we ask right now that you
[2:23:47] bless the rest of our fellowship this
[2:23:49] evening
[2:23:50] we ask that you bless those who have
[2:23:53] prepared the food and those who labored
[2:23:56] to buy it and we ask that you give back
[2:24:00] to them pressed down shaken together and
[2:24:02] running over may it bring strength to
[2:24:04] the bodies of your children and may the
[2:24:07] fellowship and the atmosphere be sweet
[2:24:09] even in a little bit of mud
[2:24:11] and we will give you the praise and the
[2:24:14] honor and the glory for it's in the name
[2:24:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[2:24:22] amen amen you are dismissed to go
[2:24:26] tonight in the name of the Lord there
[2:24:29] are the first row of tables where there
[2:24:31] are white chairs we are holding that for
[2:24:34] the seniors for those who might have a
[2:24:36] little bit of a harder time getting
[2:24:38] across the uneven ground of the tent and
[2:24:42] so if you will hold that for them I
[2:24:45] believe there will be seats for all of
[2:24:46] the rest of us somewhere it'll take them
[2:24:49] a moment to put the food on the table
[2:24:51] but please stay and have have a little
[2:24:53] fellowship with us if you can God bless
[2:24:56] you as you leave tonight in the name of
[2:24:59] the Lord go down sister Laurel you've
[2:25:02] worked hard I can say
