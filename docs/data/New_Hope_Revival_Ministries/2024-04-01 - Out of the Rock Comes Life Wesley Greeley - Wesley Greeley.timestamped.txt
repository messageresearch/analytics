[1:05:24] 46 will you turn that fan off as you go
[1:05:27] off
[1:05:28] please Luke
[1:05:34] 6:46 and I would like to read through
[1:05:36] verse
[1:05:41] 49 and why call ye me Lord Lord and do
[1:05:47] not the things which I
[1:05:50] say whosoever cometh to me and heareth
[1:05:54] my sayings and do with them I will show
[1:05:58] you to whom he is
[1:06:00] like he is like a man which built an
[1:06:04] house and digged deep and laid the
[1:06:09] foundation on a rock and when the flood
[1:06:13] arose and the stream beat vehemently
[1:06:17] upon that house and could not shake it
[1:06:21] for it was founded upon a rock but but
[1:06:25] he that heareth and doeth not is like a
[1:06:30] man that without a foundation built an
[1:06:33] house upon the Earth against which the
[1:06:37] stream did beat vehemently and
[1:06:40] immediately it fell and the ruin of that
[1:06:44] house was
[1:06:46] great before you're seated First
[1:06:49] Corinthians chapter
[1:06:54] 10
[1:06:57] 1 Corinthians chap
[1:07:00] 10 verse
[1:07:03] 1-6 moreover Brethren I would not that
[1:07:06] you should be ignorant how that all our
[1:07:11] fathers were under the
[1:07:14] cloud and all passed through the
[1:07:17] sea and were all baptized unto Moses in
[1:07:22] the cloud and in the
[1:07:24] sea and did all eat the same spiritual
[1:07:28] meat and did all drink the same
[1:07:32] spiritual drink for they drank of that
[1:07:35] spiritual rock that followed them and
[1:07:39] that rock was
[1:07:41] Christ but with many of them God was not
[1:07:45] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:07:48] the
[1:07:49] wilderness now these things were our
[1:07:53] examples to the intent
[1:07:56] we should not lust after evil things as
[1:08:00] they
[1:08:01] lusted may the Lord add a blessing to
[1:08:04] the reading of his word let's pray
[1:08:05] before you're seated today our father
[1:08:08] how grateful we are to be gathered in
[1:08:11] the house of the Lord we thank you for
[1:08:14] each one that is gathered with us in the
[1:08:16] building we thank you for each one that
[1:08:19] may be on the other side of the camera
[1:08:21] watching this stream or who may watch it
[1:08:24] in the AR five we bless them in the name
[1:08:27] of Jesus Christ and pray now Lord that
[1:08:30] your word as it goes forth would find
[1:08:34] its place in our lives and that it would
[1:08:36] do for us what we need done at this
[1:08:39] moment I pray God that you will help
[1:08:42] your servant to get out of the way and
[1:08:45] be hid behind the cross of Calvary I
[1:08:49] pray Lord that you will speak to this
[1:08:52] your people Lord you promise that if I
[1:08:55] would open my mouth that you would fill
[1:08:57] it and so I am here on duty today and I
[1:09:01] open my mouth in your name and I ask you
[1:09:05] God that you will now speak to us I pray
[1:09:08] God that you will push back any
[1:09:10] disturbance in the spirit in the name of
[1:09:14] Jesus Christ May the angels be in their
[1:09:17] positions in this house and we will give
[1:09:20] you the glory and the honor for it's in
[1:09:22] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:09:24] we pray
[1:09:26] amen you may have your seats
[1:09:37] today I know that I have said before
[1:09:40] that it's very strange to me being a
[1:09:43] Believer and reading the word of God
[1:09:46] when I look at a scripture like we read
[1:09:48] in Luke chapter 6 and and is also found
[1:09:52] in Matthew chapter 7 this same story
[1:09:55] story is is found where Jesus is talking
[1:09:58] about those that build their house let
[1:10:01] them build it on a rock and and I
[1:10:03] remember years ago when I was just
[1:10:05] learning how to build and and we were
[1:10:08] digging along for a foundation for a
[1:10:10] footer for a home and we hit
[1:10:13] rock and it was going to be too much of
[1:10:16] a chore to try to get uh something in
[1:10:19] there to chip all the rock out and we
[1:10:22] needed to pour the concrete over the
[1:10:24] foot over the the concrete footer over
[1:10:27] the Rock and uh it it would seem
[1:10:31] according to this scripture that you
[1:10:33] would want to pour the concrete on the
[1:10:36] rock well the building inspector told us
[1:10:39] not
[1:10:40] so you cannot build you cannot pour the
[1:10:44] concrete on that rock you have to put
[1:10:47] sand over that rock before that you can
[1:10:51] pour the concrete
[1:10:53] footer and you know understanding over
[1:10:57] the years you understand that the plates
[1:10:59] of the earth
[1:11:00] move and they wanted that sand there to
[1:11:03] be a buffer for when the rock moved uh
[1:11:07] that that the the concrete would be
[1:11:10] would be able to stay in place but we
[1:11:13] have to recognize when we think about
[1:11:15] that concept of building that that is a
[1:11:19] man-made
[1:11:21] structure it is a man-made structure
[1:11:24] that the the the building inspectors uh
[1:11:27] they were able to tell us that we needed
[1:11:30] to put a little bit of sand over that
[1:11:32] rock before we poured the concrete but
[1:11:35] when we build this spiritual house this
[1:11:40] spiritual house must be built on the
[1:11:43] Rock of Ages the rock that will never
[1:11:47] move though the Earth has Rock in it
[1:11:51] when the earth shakes and the
[1:11:54] earthquakes the natural rocks may move
[1:11:57] they may bust apart they may shift they
[1:12:00] may cause us to feel afraid when the
[1:12:04] earth starts moving and shifting and
[1:12:07] shaking but when you are built on the
[1:12:10] Rock Christ Jesus he will never
[1:12:14] move he will never move if you build on
[1:12:19] this rock that we are talking
[1:12:22] about now we read in in in first
[1:12:25] Corinthians chapter 10 concerning our
[1:12:28] Brethren our fathers that were all under
[1:12:31] the cloud and they all passed through
[1:12:34] the sea and they were all baptized in
[1:12:37] the cloud and in the sea and they all
[1:12:40] ate the Same Spirit they were all alike
[1:12:43] they all were privileged to come out of
[1:12:47] Egypt do you realize when they came out
[1:12:50] of Egypt the Bible says that there was a
[1:12:53] mixed multitude
[1:12:56] UD there were all kind was not only the
[1:12:59] Israelites there was a mixed
[1:13:01] multitude and see that's what happens
[1:13:04] when there is a shakeup come on when
[1:13:07] there is a shakeup it causes people to
[1:13:11] get on board with certain things and
[1:13:14] that's what was happening in Egypt when
[1:13:17] the when when the when the death angel
[1:13:21] passed through after all of the plagues
[1:13:24] of Egypt had hit Egypt and and and it
[1:13:27] had gone through and brought Devastation
[1:13:29] to the land of Egypt there were
[1:13:32] Egyptians who said I can't handle this
[1:13:35] anymore I've got to get on board with
[1:13:38] these Israelites let's see what happens
[1:13:41] is when you have Egypt inside of you and
[1:13:46] you start going out of Egypt and they
[1:13:49] were all under the
[1:13:53] cloud all of the mix multitude was under
[1:13:56] the
[1:13:59] cloud there were all that group that
[1:14:01] went out with Moses there wasn't one of
[1:14:04] them that wasn't under the
[1:14:06] cloud they were they were privileged to
[1:14:09] be under the pillar of cloud during the
[1:14:12] day and the pillar of fire at night they
[1:14:16] had the privilege of being a part of
[1:14:18] that crowd and then when Pharaoh came up
[1:14:22] behind them and they were trapped at the
[1:14:24] Red Sea
[1:14:25] and God gave Moses the inspiration and
[1:14:28] said stretch your Rod out over the sea
[1:14:31] and the Sea split wide open all of the
[1:14:34] mixed multitude went
[1:14:40] through all of the mumbling
[1:14:44] grumbling
[1:14:46] Egyptian spirit that was under the cloud
[1:14:50] or under the pillar of fire they all
[1:14:54] went through through the Red
[1:14:58] Sea you remember when when they were
[1:15:01] stuck at the Red Sea the grumbling
[1:15:07] started you brought us out here only for
[1:15:10] us to be killed right here we got the
[1:15:13] mountains beside us we got the river in
[1:15:16] front of us we got the Egyptians behind
[1:15:18] us why did you do it Moses the grumbling
[1:15:22] started but they all went the when the
[1:15:25] Red Sea opened up they all passed over
[1:15:29] it did not matter whether they were
[1:15:31] Israelite or Egyptian or something else
[1:15:34] if they were under the cloud with Moses
[1:15:37] they were privileged to all go through
[1:15:39] that Red Sea and First Corinthian called
[1:15:42] it a
[1:15:45] baptism they were all
[1:15:48] baptized unto
[1:15:50] Moses in the cloud and in the sea
[1:15:55] and they did all eat the same spiritual
[1:15:58] meat they got to the other side the
[1:16:02] Egyptian Army was handled in the Red Sea
[1:16:05] God took care of them but when they got
[1:16:07] to the other side there was a rejoicing
[1:16:11] that took place when they got to the
[1:16:13] other side but the Egyptian Spirit was
[1:16:16] still in the midst of
[1:16:20] them
[1:16:22] although they were under the cloud
[1:16:26] they were under the pillar of
[1:16:28] fire and then the time came where that
[1:16:30] they started telling Moses did you bring
[1:16:33] us out here to die weren't there G uh uh
[1:16:36] uh garlic and leaks in Egypt and there
[1:16:39] was all kinds of food in Egypt at least
[1:16:41] we wouldn't have starve to death and God
[1:16:43] provided them Mana they did all eat the
[1:16:48] same spiritual
[1:16:50] meat not only the natural meat of the
[1:16:54] Mana but they were all privileged to be
[1:16:57] under the sound of the voice of the
[1:16:59] Prophet Moses when he came off of the
[1:17:02] mountain and began to talk to them right
[1:17:05] they were all under the
[1:17:07] Cloud yet there was that Egyption spirit
[1:17:12] that was prevalent among them that
[1:17:15] caused them to Grumble and Mumble and in
[1:17:18] all of this the Bible tells us in in
[1:17:21] First Corinthians as we just read that
[1:17:23] these things were our our examples to
[1:17:27] the intent that we should not lust after
[1:17:30] evil
[1:17:32] things as they also
[1:17:35] lusted Exodus chapter
[1:17:39] 17 Exodus
[1:17:47] 17 verse
[1:17:50] one through six and all the children or
[1:17:54] all the Congregation of the children of
[1:17:56] Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of
[1:17:59] sin after their Journeys according to
[1:18:03] the Commandment of the Lord and pitched
[1:18:06] in ridim and there was no water for the
[1:18:10] people to
[1:18:12] drink
[1:18:14] H wherefore the people did chide with
[1:18:19] Moses and
[1:18:20] said give us water that we may drink
[1:18:25] and Moses said unto
[1:18:28] them why ched ye with
[1:18:31] me wherefore do you tempt the Lord now I
[1:18:37] am not sure why that the word CH was
[1:18:41] used here but it seems to be uh perhaps
[1:18:45] a stronger word than just
[1:18:49] Grumble and and they were just at Moses
[1:18:53] why did you bring us out here and
[1:18:55] there's no water and and Moses Moses
[1:18:59] they came to Moses and they said give us
[1:19:01] water that we may drink and Moses said
[1:19:04] why are you chiding me and why are you
[1:19:07] tempting the
[1:19:08] Lord and the people thirsted for water
[1:19:11] and the people murmured against
[1:19:14] Moses and said
[1:19:16] wherefore is this that thou Hast brought
[1:19:20] us up out of Egypt to kill us and our
[1:19:23] children and our c battle with thirst
[1:19:26] now remember as we read this I want us
[1:19:29] to keep in mind these things are for our
[1:19:32] example to the intent that we should not
[1:19:36] lust after evil things you say wait a
[1:19:40] minute preacher water is not an evil
[1:19:44] thing we're not talking about the water
[1:19:48] we're talking about the chiding we're
[1:19:50] talking about tempting the Lord we're
[1:19:52] talking about the murmurings that were
[1:19:55] against Moses and against God all right
[1:19:58] so wherefore is it that you brought us
[1:20:00] up out of Egypt to kill us and our
[1:20:02] children and our cattle with thirst and
[1:20:04] Moses Cried unto the Lord
[1:20:07] saying what shall I do unto this
[1:20:11] people they be almost ready to Stone
[1:20:16] me and the Lord said unto Moses go on
[1:20:19] before the people and take with thee of
[1:20:22] the Elders of Israel and thy Rod
[1:20:25] wherewith thou smortest the river take
[1:20:28] in thine hand and go behold I will stand
[1:20:33] before thee there upon the rock Horeb
[1:20:36] and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there
[1:20:39] shall come water out of it that the
[1:20:42] people may drink and Moses did so in the
[1:20:47] sight of the Elders of Israel
[1:20:52] now the Bible explains to to us that
[1:20:56] indeed when Moses smoted the rock that
[1:21:00] God told him to take the
[1:21:03] rod the same Rod that you dipped in the
[1:21:06] Nile River and spoke over the Waters of
[1:21:09] the Nile I want you to take that rod and
[1:21:12] I want you to Smite that rock and water
[1:21:15] is going to come out of it and Moses did
[1:21:18] so and the water came out for the people
[1:21:21] to drink now Moses was being Obed
[1:21:24] obedient to the word of the Lord in the
[1:21:27] fact that he gave them water from the
[1:21:31] rock now well let me just remind you
[1:21:34] that as we read uh in in 1 Corinthians
[1:21:38] chap 10:4 they did all drink the same
[1:21:43] spiritual drink for they drank of that
[1:21:46] spiritual rock that followed them and
[1:21:50] that rock was
[1:21:52] Christ the same Rock they they all drank
[1:21:56] from it they were privileged to drink
[1:21:59] from that rock all of
[1:22:06] them let me just ask you do you think
[1:22:10] that there were any of
[1:22:12] them whether they be Israelite or
[1:22:15] whether they be Egyptian or some other
[1:22:17] nationality that said I've got to get
[1:22:19] out of Egypt it's devastated I'm going
[1:22:22] with the Blessed ones do you think think
[1:22:24] that there are any of them when The Rock
[1:22:27] when The Rock gave forth its water do
[1:22:29] you think that there were any of them
[1:22:31] one that said I don't want that
[1:22:38] water no they were all
[1:22:41] thirsty they and their cattle they were
[1:22:44] thirsty they needed water now you think
[1:22:47] about how many people that there were
[1:22:49] and how many cattle that there were
[1:22:52] because you know they didn't have just
[1:22:54] their cattle
[1:22:57] attle they emptied
[1:23:00] Egypt and remember all of the first born
[1:23:03] of the cattle in Egypt were
[1:23:05] gone and perhaps the Egyptians thought
[1:23:07] we're plagued and just give it all to
[1:23:09] them get them out of here we don't want
[1:23:11] the plague anymore just get them out of
[1:23:13] here but yet when they got there and
[1:23:16] they they they realized that they needed
[1:23:18] water they began to chide Moses they
[1:23:20] began to murmur against him why did you
[1:23:22] bring us out here and now we have no
[1:23:25] water we're going to die of thirst out
[1:23:26] here in the wilderness yet Moses goes to
[1:23:29] the Lord and he says Lord these people
[1:23:31] are about ready to Stone
[1:23:33] me they want to kill me because they
[1:23:35] have no water and the lord gave him
[1:23:37] instruction to take the rod and to Smite
[1:23:41] The Rock and water came out that it
[1:23:43] could quench The Thirst of the people
[1:23:47] now their Journey continues on and we
[1:23:50] find our our our next instance
[1:23:52] concerning thirst in numbers chap 20 and
[1:23:55] we'd like to read there as well numbers
[1:23:57] chap 20:
[1:24:00] 1-13 then came the children of Israel
[1:24:03] even the whole congregation into the
[1:24:05] desert of zeen in the first month and
[1:24:08] the people Abode in cadesh and Mariam
[1:24:11] died there and was buried there and
[1:24:14] there was no water for the congregation
[1:24:17] and they gathered to themselves together
[1:24:19] against Moses and against Aaron now it's
[1:24:23] not just against Moses it's against
[1:24:25] Moses and Aaron and the people ched with
[1:24:28] Moses and spake saying would God that we
[1:24:32] had died when our Brethren died before
[1:24:34] the Lord
[1:24:37] now what is it with
[1:24:40] usens what is it with
[1:24:43] people all through their Journey they
[1:24:47] found something new to Grumble about and
[1:24:50] we as people have not changed much since
[1:24:53] 4,000 years and we we can have a we can
[1:24:58] have a wonderful time in the Lord but
[1:25:01] then when we meet the enemy face to face
[1:25:04] then we find our grumbling heart
[1:25:08] again God help
[1:25:11] us now we're talking about the children
[1:25:15] of Israel all who came through the Red
[1:25:19] Sea now obviously there are new children
[1:25:21] that are being born there's new
[1:25:23] generation Rising in up but here are a
[1:25:25] group of people that now find themselves
[1:25:29] once again thirsty no water they gather
[1:25:32] themselves against Moses and Aaron they
[1:25:34] ched Moses and say would God that we had
[1:25:38] died in the wilderness with our brother
[1:25:42] now what kind of a
[1:25:46] heart what kind of an attitude what kind
[1:25:49] of a spirit would be in us that we would
[1:25:53] would all of the sudden and we we're a
[1:25:55] part of a a beautiful Congregation of
[1:25:58] people out in the wilderness God has
[1:26:00] sustained us he's given us Mana from
[1:26:02] Heaven he's given us meat to eat and
[1:26:05] water to drink and he's done all of this
[1:26:07] for us we've seen the miraculous works
[1:26:09] of God when when uh Kora he he decided
[1:26:14] that he he wanted to be uh head hono and
[1:26:18] Moses wasn't doing things right and God
[1:26:21] came along and said that all right you
[1:26:23] know we're we're going to we're going to
[1:26:25] have a showdown here and the Earth
[1:26:27] swallowed Kora up and was that what was
[1:26:30] in mind with these guys would God that
[1:26:33] we had died when our Brethren died
[1:26:35] before the
[1:26:37] Lord what kind of an attitude is
[1:26:40] this that we would that they would say
[1:26:45] you know I I'm thirsty and I I wish that
[1:26:48] I had just died when our brothers died
[1:26:50] before the Lord then I wouldn't have to
[1:26:52] worry about thirst anymore
[1:27:54] want you to
[1:27:56] watch most of you are familiar with this
[1:27:59] let's just
[1:28:00] watch again God gives instruction take
[1:28:03] the rod and gather the assembly
[1:28:07] together thou and Aaron thy
[1:28:10] brother
[1:28:12] and
[1:28:14] speak ye unto the rock before their eyes
[1:28:19] and it shall give forth his water and
[1:28:22] thou shalt bring forth to them water out
[1:28:25] of the rock so that thou shalt give the
[1:28:28] congregation and their beasts to
[1:28:33] drink and Moses took the rod from before
[1:28:36] the Lord as he commanded
[1:28:38] him and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[1:28:42] congregation together before the Rock
[1:28:46] and he said unto them here now you
[1:28:50] rebels must we fetch you water out of
[1:28:54] this
[1:29:00] rock
[1:29:02] Moses had had
[1:29:08] it Pastor Moses had had
[1:29:14] it he was tired of their mumbling and
[1:29:18] grumbling and it got to
[1:29:23] him listen friends this is why we need
[1:29:27] the Holy Ghost so desperately in this
[1:29:30] hour because the enemy wants you to have
[1:29:35] it and he wants you to respond in a
[1:29:39] wrong attitude to keep you out of the
[1:29:43] promise of God and Moses says here now
[1:29:47] you rebels must we fetch you water out
[1:29:50] of the Rock and Moses lifted up his hand
[1:29:54] and with his Rod he smoted it smote The
[1:29:59] Rock
[1:30:03] twice what did God say to do with
[1:30:06] it speak to the
[1:30:10] Rock what did Moses
[1:30:12] do he spoke to the
[1:30:17] congregation out of
[1:30:20] frustration rather than speaking to the
[1:30:23] rock with the word of the Lord he spoke
[1:30:26] to the congregation out of frustration
[1:30:29] and his frustration Rose to the level
[1:30:33] that had got out of hand and rather than
[1:30:36] speaking to the Rock he took the rod
[1:30:39] that brought water from the rock the
[1:30:41] first time and he smoke the rock twice
[1:30:45] and water still came
[1:30:48] out oh for the grace of
[1:30:53] God
[1:30:55] in our ignorance in our
[1:30:58] frustration in our
[1:31:00] stupidity oh for the grace of God that
[1:31:04] covers our
[1:31:05] behind because even though he was
[1:31:08] disobedient to the word of the Lord and
[1:31:11] he took the rod and he smoted it twice
[1:31:14] the water came out abundantly and the
[1:31:17] congregation drank and their beasts
[1:31:21] also and the Lord spoke to Moses and
[1:31:24] Aaron because you believed me
[1:31:27] not to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[1:31:31] children of
[1:31:33] Israel
[1:31:35] therefore you shall
[1:31:39] not bring this congregation into the
[1:31:42] land which I have given them this is the
[1:31:45] water of marah because the children of
[1:31:47] Israel strove with the Lord and he was
[1:31:51] Sanctified in them now you just think
[1:31:56] about this situation brother random
[1:31:58] taught us that he threw the plan of God
[1:32:01] out of catar in when he smote The Rock
[1:32:05] twice because the the the rock Christ
[1:32:09] Jesus was only supposed to be smitten
[1:32:12] one
[1:32:13] time now because of the grace of God
[1:32:17] Moses uh when he was frustrated with the
[1:32:21] people the water still came came out of
[1:32:24] the rock though he was disobedient but
[1:32:27] the Bible tells us that Moses was not
[1:32:31] able to go and take the people into the
[1:32:35] promised land now remember God gave
[1:32:40] Moses such an opportunity when he took
[1:32:43] him up to the top of the mountain and he
[1:32:46] let him look over into the promised land
[1:32:49] but I want you to know that Moses did
[1:32:53] not lose out with the Lord right he lost
[1:32:57] out in taking the people into the
[1:32:59] promised land but he didn't lose out
[1:33:01] with the Lord why because Moses followed
[1:33:05] that rock Moses he would he recognized
[1:33:09] that there was a Grace that was
[1:33:11] sufficient for him in so much that his
[1:33:14] time went by and Christ when he appeared
[1:33:18] on Mount
[1:33:19] Transfiguration who was with
[1:33:22] him
[1:33:25] Moses and Elijah there he was right
[1:33:29] there on top of the mountain he may not
[1:33:32] have been able to lead the children of
[1:33:34] Israel into the promised land the way he
[1:33:37] wanted to but he got to the promised
[1:33:40] land the promised land was his because
[1:33:43] of the grace of God now I want to read
[1:33:46] from Deuteronomy chapter 32 and I'm
[1:33:49] going to do some skipping so I'll try to
[1:33:52] keep you posted about what I'm reading
[1:33:55] Deuteronomy 32: 1-4 give ear oh you
[1:33:59] heavens and I will speak and hear oh
[1:34:03] Earth the words of my mouth my Doctrine
[1:34:07] shall drop as the rain my speech shall
[1:34:11] distill as the Dew as the small rain
[1:34:15] upon the tender herb and as the showers
[1:34:18] upon the grass because I will publish
[1:34:22] the name of the Lord
[1:34:24] ascribe ye to the greatness unto our
[1:34:28] God verse four he is the rock his work
[1:34:33] is perfect for all his ways are judgment
[1:34:37] a god of Truth and without an iniquity
[1:34:41] just and right is he verse nine for the
[1:34:46] Lord's portion is his
[1:34:49] people Jacob is the lot of his in
[1:34:52] inheritance he found him in a desert
[1:34:55] land and in the waste howling Wilderness
[1:34:58] he led him about he instructed him he
[1:35:02] kept him as the apple of his eye as the
[1:35:06] eagle stirreth up her nest flutter over
[1:35:09] her young spreadeth abroad her wings
[1:35:12] taketh them beareth them on her wings so
[1:35:15] the Lord alone did lead him and there
[1:35:18] was no strange god with him he made him
[1:35:21] ride on the high place places of the
[1:35:24] earth that he might eat the increase of
[1:35:27] the fields he made him to suck honey out
[1:35:30] of the Rock and out and oil out of the
[1:35:34] flinty rock now uh I didn't say it at
[1:35:38] the beginning but I taken for a thought
[1:35:41] today out of the Rock and we see that
[1:35:45] we've already read about this rock that
[1:35:47] followed them through the Wilderness how
[1:35:49] that they got water when Moses smoted it
[1:35:52] the first time and he was instructed and
[1:35:55] we see here that that uh again he they
[1:35:59] needed water and Moses was told to speak
[1:36:01] to the Rock yet Moses took the rod and
[1:36:04] he smokee it twice and water still came
[1:36:08] out of the rock because God was going to
[1:36:11] cover for
[1:36:12] Moses the grace of God who covers for us
[1:36:17] and now we're reading here Moses's song
[1:36:19] of Thanksgiving and he's saying that he
[1:36:22] made him to suck honey out of of The
[1:36:24] Rock and oil out of the flinty rock
[1:36:29] now I don't
[1:36:31] know the story of them sucking honey out
[1:36:36] of the
[1:36:37] rock I can't find
[1:36:40] it but it must have
[1:36:43] happened not only did water come out of
[1:36:46] a rock honey came out of a
[1:36:50] rock now I threw the message of the hour
[1:36:53] I've heard brother brandham talk about
[1:36:55] that that there was a crevice in the
[1:36:57] Rock and that a bee found that crevice
[1:36:59] in the Rock and that they began to build
[1:37:01] a a nest there and that they made a
[1:37:05] honeycomb a hive in that place and that
[1:37:07] it created a place for them to eat honey
[1:37:10] from The Rock I don't know but I can see
[1:37:13] here in the scripture that Moses is
[1:37:16] giving thanks and he said he made him to
[1:37:18] suck honey out of the
[1:37:21] rock so I'll just take it that somewhere
[1:37:25] there was a
[1:37:27] rock and I'm still saying that out of
[1:37:30] that rock Christ Jesus although that
[1:37:33] Moses at the time did not have a name to
[1:37:36] put on him as we do Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:40] there was something inside of Moses that
[1:37:43] he knew where his sustenance came
[1:37:46] from his sustenance came out of the rock
[1:37:49] out of the rock flowed water to sustain
[1:37:52] the people the first time when he smoted
[1:37:54] it and out of the W Rock came water the
[1:37:57] second time when he smoted it twice and
[1:37:59] apparently there was honey that come out
[1:38:01] of the Rock and there was oil that came
[1:38:03] out of the flinty
[1:38:07] rock we also read in Psalm
[1:38:10] 81:16 he should have fed them also with
[1:38:13] the finest of the wheat and with honey
[1:38:16] out of the rock should I have satisfied
[1:38:20] thee then I remind you of the story that
[1:38:23] we heard heard so many times when
[1:38:24] brother Brenham was talking about the
[1:38:26] sheep and how that they would become
[1:38:29] sickly and there was something in the
[1:38:31] Limestone rock that they needed but you
[1:38:34] couldn't get them to just go lick a rock
[1:38:37] and so the shepherd would carry honey in
[1:38:40] his scrip bag and when he recognized
[1:38:43] that his sheep was ailing and that that
[1:38:45] sheep needed to get the Limestone that
[1:38:48] was in that rock that that Shepherd
[1:38:50] would get some honey out of the script
[1:38:52] bag and rub it into the Rock and the the
[1:38:56] the the Sheep would come and start
[1:38:58] licking the honey the healing was not
[1:39:01] necessarily in the honey but the healing
[1:39:04] was in the rock out of the rock came the
[1:39:07] healing that the Sheep needed and so the
[1:39:10] shepherd would rub Honey in the Rock
[1:39:12] something
[1:39:16] sweet reminds me of the word of God it's
[1:39:20] sweet in the mouth but it's bitter in
[1:39:23] the belly but there's something about
[1:39:25] the word of God that it there's a
[1:39:28] sweetness to it and it draws us to it
[1:39:31] because the Holy Ghost knows what we
[1:39:33] need he knows the word that we need in
[1:39:36] due season so he puts it out there with
[1:39:39] a Sweetness in it and we take and we eat
[1:39:42] it and after a while we
[1:39:46] recognize this ain't as sweet as I
[1:39:48] thought it
[1:39:52] was
[1:39:55] and it starts churning inside of us
[1:39:57] because it's working because we got to
[1:40:00] the Rock the honey got us to the Rock
[1:40:03] Christ Jesus and we still we went to
[1:40:05] licking the rock we went to to getting
[1:40:08] something out of the rock that was
[1:40:09] really going to sustain us because the
[1:40:12] sweetness will wear off in a hurry but
[1:40:14] the SI the the the sustenance that we
[1:40:17] need from the word of God it goes down
[1:40:20] and it starts ruminating it starts
[1:40:22] guring and and going about in our gut
[1:40:26] and we don't know hardly what to do with
[1:40:28] it but it's working it's working to
[1:40:31] bring forth the Manifest glory of God in
[1:40:33] our life it's working in me both to Will
[1:40:36] and to do of his good pleasure because I
[1:40:39] am his I belong to him and I am come I'm
[1:40:43] coming as a son I'm coming into my
[1:40:46] maturity and I'm not just going to spit
[1:40:48] out
[1:40:52] everything
[1:40:56] it's a
[1:40:57] joy to watch my
[1:41:01] granddaughter you know there
[1:41:04] are some that hate
[1:41:08] vegetables some vegetables are
[1:41:11] bitter but there's nutrition in
[1:41:17] them and there's sometimes when you feed
[1:41:21] a
[1:41:22] child there's some adults
[1:41:24] too they just it's green they don't
[1:41:27] touch it you know but a child sometimes
[1:41:32] a new experience you put it in their
[1:41:34] mouth and they don't like the taste and
[1:41:36] they'll spit it out but yesterday Edith
[1:41:40] was sitting at my table and we had
[1:41:44] chicken and we had butternut squash
[1:41:47] which is very sweet and very pleasant to
[1:41:49] look at it's orange and she likes that
[1:41:52] very much much but also on the table was
[1:41:56] zucchini squash roasted zucchini squash
[1:41:59] which happens to be green and it's not
[1:42:01] as pleasant to look at as the butternut
[1:42:04] squash yet it has nutrition in it that
[1:42:06] can help us if we'll eat it and so I
[1:42:09] just reached over and I put my Fork she
[1:42:11] was feeding herself but I decided let's
[1:42:13] see if she'll try this and I stuck the
[1:42:16] zucchini in her mouth and she chewed it
[1:42:18] up she did not frown she did not make a
[1:42:20] sour face but she chewed it up and she
[1:42:23] swallowed it because her mom and dad are
[1:42:26] teaching her you got to try things and
[1:42:29] that's the way it is with the word of
[1:42:30] God there are sometimes in time past
[1:42:34] where we have spit it
[1:42:38] out we've spit it out because we didn't
[1:42:41] like it with where we were at the
[1:42:44] moment but because of the grace of God
[1:42:48] and because that we belong to him he and
[1:42:52] his Mercy will'll bring zucchini back
[1:42:55] around
[1:42:55] [Music]
[1:43:07] again now there are
[1:43:10] some that like
[1:43:14] turnup in
[1:43:17] the I guess you would call it the
[1:43:21] fruit whatever it is is the
[1:43:24] root and there are some that like the
[1:43:29] leaves quite frankly I'm not fond of
[1:43:33] either one of
[1:43:36] them yet there are times if you give me
[1:43:40] the leaves and enough hot pepper sauce
[1:43:43] I'll eat the
[1:43:44] leaves and there are times when you get
[1:43:48] a a turnup root that is cut up and
[1:43:51] boiled and has enough butter on it and
[1:43:54] salt and pepper and and that it's not
[1:43:56] too bitter that I like it okay and I'll
[1:44:00] eat it because I have been taught that
[1:44:03] that there is nutrition in some of these
[1:44:06] things and and even though I have tasted
[1:44:11] bitter
[1:44:13] turnup and when I was
[1:44:16] younger I never understood why my dad
[1:44:19] wanted a turnup every now and then
[1:44:21] there's you know it's it's just bitter
[1:44:25] why do you want that and that's the way
[1:44:28] it is with the word of God there are
[1:44:30] times where that we uh in our in our
[1:44:33] moment of Life something is fed to us
[1:44:36] and it's bitter to us and we've got to
[1:44:39] go through another Wilderness we've got
[1:44:41] to go through another trial we've got to
[1:44:43] come we've got to go through another
[1:44:45] test to bring us up to a level of
[1:44:47] maturity where that we're not spitting
[1:44:50] out the turnup or the zucchini we're not
[1:44:53] spitting out the word of God but we are
[1:44:55] taking it because we know that it has
[1:44:58] nutrition that we need for our maturity
[1:45:01] and so we then eat it and yes it isn't
[1:45:06] always sweet in the
[1:45:10] mouth we talk about the word of God
[1:45:12] being sweet in the mouth and there are
[1:45:15] many many times that there the that the
[1:45:19] word of God is sweet in our mouth and
[1:45:21] then bitter in the belly
[1:45:23] but I'm just going to tell you from
[1:45:25] experience there have been plenty of
[1:45:28] times that the word of God came to me
[1:45:31] and it was just as bitter as the last
[1:45:37] time but I was at a different place with
[1:45:41] a more receptive heart to recognize that
[1:45:45] it was still a pill that I needed to
[1:45:48] swallow and let it become nutrition
[1:45:51] inside of me and do its
[1:45:54] work give me a glass of water I'll wash
[1:45:57] it on
[1:45:58] down let me get in the presence of the
[1:46:01] Lord and let the water from the rock
[1:46:03] come and bathe over my soul and refill
[1:46:07] me with the Holy Ghost to let me know
[1:46:09] that even though the word was was bitter
[1:46:12] and I took it in and I swallowed it it
[1:46:15] didn't it didn't taste so good at the
[1:46:17] moment but I realize it's something that
[1:46:19] I really
[1:46:21] need I can sit and keep saying nope
[1:46:26] don't want any no don't want any no I
[1:46:29] don't want
[1:46:33] that after a while the Lord let you know
[1:46:36] that you belong to him and you can say
[1:46:39] no no no no but after a while you
[1:46:45] recognize that the fool have said in his
[1:46:48] heart
[1:46:51] no
[1:46:56] I know the King James says the fool has
[1:46:57] said in her heart there is no
[1:47:02] God but there are even fools that knows
[1:47:04] there's
[1:47:07] God but there have been many of
[1:47:10] foolish Christians along the way and
[1:47:13] many of foolish unbelievers along the
[1:47:17] way who when God gave them instruction
[1:47:20] they did a very foolish thing and and
[1:47:23] they said no thank you
[1:47:30] Lord and some were even as foolish
[1:47:33] enough to say no way
[1:47:36] God but after a while because of his
[1:47:40] grace for a while he covers our backside
[1:47:43] but after a while he said it's time to
[1:47:46] come up a little bit higher it's time to
[1:47:49] put aside childish things and quit speak
[1:47:53] out the zucchini it's time to take this
[1:47:56] pill and swallow it because you must
[1:47:59] grow up into a mature
[1:48:03] son so he puts the honey on the
[1:48:09] Rock and he says you got to get to it
[1:48:13] you got to get to it reading on verse 14
[1:48:17] butter of kind and milk of sheep with
[1:48:19] fat of lambs and Rams of the breed of
[1:48:21] Bashan and goats
[1:48:23] with the fat of kidneys of Wheat and
[1:48:25] thou D drink the pure blood of the grape
[1:48:28] but Jerin waxed fat this is also another
[1:48:32] name for Jacob or Israel jesan waxed fat
[1:48:36] and
[1:48:38] kicked Thou Art wax and
[1:48:42] fat I'm reading in Deuteronomy 32 I'm
[1:48:45] sorry Deuteronomy 32 now I'm in verse 16
[1:48:49] they provoked him to jealousy with strin
[1:48:53] Gods with Abominations provoked they him
[1:48:56] to anger they sacrificed unto devils not
[1:49:00] to God to Gods whom they knew not to New
[1:49:03] Gods they came that came newly up whom
[1:49:07] your fathers feared not of the rock that
[1:49:10] begat thee Thou Art unmindful and H has
[1:49:14] forgotten God that formed
[1:49:20] thee verse 30
[1:49:24] how should
[1:49:25] one chase a
[1:49:28] thousand and
[1:49:30] two put 10,000 to
[1:49:34] flight except their Rock had sold them
[1:49:36] and the Lord had shut them
[1:49:40] up for their rock is not as our Rock
[1:49:43] even our enemies themselves being
[1:49:46] judges now this is one of those verses
[1:49:49] that we preachers
[1:49:51] misquote
[1:49:53] verse
[1:49:54] 30 and we talk about if one can put a
[1:49:58] thousand to flight and then two can put
[1:50:01] 10,000 to
[1:50:03] flight and we've misquoted the
[1:50:07] scripture now
[1:50:09] I I'm going to say that what we have
[1:50:13] said is
[1:50:14] true because God is on my
[1:50:18] side and I can't do anything in
[1:50:21] myself
[1:50:23] and how can one put a thousand or two
[1:50:25] 10,000 to flight except their rocket
[1:50:28] sold them you see the children of Israel
[1:50:31] got themselves in a bind because they
[1:50:33] forgot the
[1:50:35] rock they forgot that they got water out
[1:50:38] of that rock again and again and they
[1:50:41] got honey from that rock and they got
[1:50:44] sustenance from that rock but they got
[1:50:47] themselves into a place and God shut
[1:50:50] them up the rock sold them and the Lord
[1:50:53] shut them up therefore one could chase a
[1:50:56] th000 and two could put 10,000 to flight
[1:51:00] because of the rock they were no longer
[1:51:02] Mindful and they had forgotten God that
[1:51:05] formed
[1:51:06] them God squeezed them into a
[1:51:12] position where that he could get their
[1:51:14] attention
[1:51:17] again so you have
[1:51:21] God there
[1:51:23] Rock allowing one to chase a th and two
[1:51:27] to put 10,000 now I want you to
[1:51:29] understand God is God and he knows how
[1:51:32] to turn that around he knows how to help
[1:51:36] us when we are chasing the enemy because
[1:51:40] my rock knows how to shut up the enemy
[1:51:43] just like he knows how to shut me up
[1:51:45] that's
[1:51:46] right all
[1:51:49] right my rock out of the Rock out of the
[1:51:53] rock out of the rock they got water out
[1:51:56] of the rock they got honey out of The
[1:51:59] Rock was their sustenance now we read uh
[1:52:03] in the continue reading in the Old
[1:52:05] Testament about Hannah her song of
[1:52:07] Thanksgiving in 1st Samuel chap 2 veres
[1:52:10] 1 and two Hannah prayed and said my
[1:52:13] heart rejoices in the Lord mine horn is
[1:52:16] exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged
[1:52:20] over mine enemies because I rejoice in
[1:52:24] thy salvation there is none holy as the
[1:52:27] Lord for there is none beside thee
[1:52:30] neither is there any Rock like our God
[1:52:34] now we know the story of Hannah Hannah
[1:52:36] wanted a son and she went to the temple
[1:52:38] and and she prayed and the Eli thought
[1:52:41] she was drunk and and uh she said no I'm
[1:52:44] not drunk I'm just of a sorrowful heart
[1:52:47] and and Eli then blessed her and said be
[1:52:50] it as you have prayed and God answered
[1:52:52] answered the prayer and gave her a son
[1:52:54] Samuel and here she is giving the Lord
[1:52:57] thanks there is none holy as the Lord
[1:52:59] there is none beside thee neither is
[1:53:02] there any Rock like our God then we read
[1:53:05] in 2 Samuel CH 22:
[1:53:08] 1-4 we read that David is giving
[1:53:11] Thanksgiving after God delivered him
[1:53:13] from his
[1:53:14] enemies David spake unto the Lord the
[1:53:16] words of this song in the day that the
[1:53:19] Lord had delivered him out of the hands
[1:53:21] of all of his enemies and out of the
[1:53:23] hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my
[1:53:26] rock and my Fortress my deliverer the
[1:53:31] god of my rock in him will I trust he is
[1:53:36] my shield and the Horn of my salvation
[1:53:41] my high tower and my refuge My Savior
[1:53:45] thou savest me from violence I will call
[1:53:50] upon the Lord who is worthy to be
[1:53:53] praised so shall I be saved from mine
[1:53:58] enemies verse 31 of the same chapter as
[1:54:01] for God his ways are perfect the word of
[1:54:04] the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all
[1:54:08] them that trust him for who is God save
[1:54:12] the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God
[1:54:15] God is my strength and power and he
[1:54:18] maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet
[1:54:21] like hind feet and sth me upon my high
[1:54:25] places now we are remembering as we read
[1:54:28] this verse once again that this is the
[1:54:31] year of mountain
[1:54:34] climbing and we've got to keep our
[1:54:37] balance in the scriptures and we've got
[1:54:39] to stay in the middle of the road and
[1:54:42] we've got to praise until the spirit of
[1:54:44] worship comes and we've got to worship
[1:54:46] until the glory comes and we've got to
[1:54:49] stand in the glory when it comes
[1:54:52] then we've got to learn to
[1:54:55] love and then my son whatever you do
[1:55:00] make sure you have the anointing don't
[1:55:02] try to do it without the anointing
[1:55:04] friends we've got to have the anointing
[1:55:06] it's the only way that we are going to
[1:55:09] be able to climb in these high
[1:55:11] places he maketh my feet like sign's
[1:55:14] feet and Seth me upon my high places the
[1:55:17] Lord liveth verse 47 and blessed be my
[1:55:22] Rock and exalted be the god of the rock
[1:55:26] of my salvation you can also read this
[1:55:30] in Psalm chapter 18 then we have we can
[1:55:34] find in the scripture that this same
[1:55:37] Rock became a rock of
[1:55:40] offense we find it in Isaiah 8:14 we
[1:55:43] find it in Romans 9:33 and also I want
[1:55:46] to read from 1 Peter 2 verse
[1:55:51] 6-8 where wherefore also it is contained
[1:55:54] in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[1:55:58] Chief
[1:56:00] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[1:56:04] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[1:56:07] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:56:11] precious but unto them which be
[1:56:14] disobedient the stone which the builders
[1:56:17] are disallowed the same is made the head
[1:56:21] of the corner and a stone of stumbling
[1:56:25] and a rock of offense even to them which
[1:56:29] stumble at the word being disobedient
[1:56:34] where unto also they were
[1:56:37] appointed now you've got to remember
[1:56:41] that it was prophesied that he would
[1:56:45] become a rock of offense that he would
[1:56:48] be a stone of stumbling yet that same
[1:56:51] stone that would cause others to stumble
[1:56:55] that same Rock would be the one that we
[1:56:57] would get our sustenance from it would
[1:56:59] be the same Rock the same the same stone
[1:57:03] that was cut out of the mountain without
[1:57:05] hands that's coming to the elect lady
[1:57:08] with Grace Grace unto it C shouts of
[1:57:11] Grace Grace and we've been hearing this
[1:57:14] uh the stature of the perfect man and
[1:57:16] the capping Stone of Love which comes by
[1:57:19] way of the Holy Ghost it is being poured
[1:57:22] out on us this Stone this rock of
[1:57:25] offense to some is precious to
[1:57:29] me and so Jesus he is recognizing all
[1:57:34] this is happening and so we come up to
[1:57:37] Matthew chapter 16 when they're at
[1:57:39] cesaria Philippi and he asked his
[1:57:41] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[1:57:44] the son of man am and they said some of
[1:57:47] you some say that you're John the
[1:57:49] Baptist and some say Elias
[1:57:53] and others
[1:57:55] jeremias or one of the prophets this is
[1:58:00] Matthew chapter
[1:58:02] 16 verse 15 he says unto them but whom
[1:58:06] do you say that I
[1:58:09] am and Son see it had become an offense
[1:58:12] to
[1:58:15] people The Rock Christ Jesus had become
[1:58:19] an offense to people and so Jesus is
[1:58:24] asking them who do you
[1:58:28] say well some say this and some say that
[1:58:30] and some say you're John the Baptist and
[1:58:33] some say you're Elias and some say you
[1:58:36] know you you are one of the prophets
[1:58:38] maybe Jeremiah but he says I ain't
[1:58:41] worried about what everybody else is
[1:58:43] saying I want to know what you
[1:58:46] say and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:58:50] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:58:53] Living God and Jesus answered unto him
[1:58:57] and said blessed art thou Simon bar
[1:59:00] Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:59:04] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:59:08] which is in heaven and I say unto thee
[1:59:11] Thou Art Peter and Upon This
[1:59:15] Rock will I build my church and the
[1:59:19] Gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[1:59:23] it
[1:59:25] now this is not a
[1:59:29] church this is a
[1:59:31] revelation of who Jesus Christ is and
[1:59:35] Peter when he was asked Jesus said I
[1:59:39] don't want to know what everybody else
[1:59:41] is
[1:59:41] thinking they're out
[1:59:44] there I want to know what you're
[1:59:47] thinking I want to know what you've got
[1:59:50] to say about it you've walked with me
[1:59:52] now for quite some time I'm coming to
[1:59:55] the end of my journey he's already been
[1:59:58] trying to tell them uh the son of man's
[2:00:00] got to go and he's got to be in the
[2:00:02] heart of the Earth for three days and
[2:00:04] three nights even as Jonah was in the
[2:00:07] belly of the fish for three days and
[2:00:09] three nights so now he's he's he's been
[2:00:13] telling them this and he's asking
[2:00:16] them who do you say I've been walking
[2:00:19] with you you've been walking with me who
[2:00:21] are you going to say that I am and he
[2:00:24] says Peter says Thou Art the Christ the
[2:00:27] son of the Living God and then Jesus
[2:00:30] tells him Upon This Rock of Revelation
[2:00:33] I'm going to build my church you must
[2:00:36] know who the Lord Jesus Christ is you
[2:00:41] have to know who he is flesh and blood
[2:00:45] and didn't reveal it to you but my
[2:00:47] Father which is in heaven and Upon This
[2:00:49] Rock I'll build my church and the gates
[2:00:52] of Hell shall not Prevail against it and
[2:00:54] I'm going to give you the keys of the
[2:00:56] kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind
[2:00:58] on Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[2:01:01] whatever you loose on the Earth shall be
[2:01:03] loosed in heaven then he charged his
[2:01:06] disciples that he should tell no man
[2:01:10] that he was Jesus the
[2:01:13] Christ now I'm going to go on here
[2:01:17] because I I want you to see
[2:01:19] something Peter has just from his mouth
[2:01:22] spoken this great
[2:01:26] Revelation the Revelation that Jesus is
[2:01:30] the Christ the anointed the Messiah and
[2:01:34] Jesus tells him upon that Revelation I'm
[2:01:38] going to build my church and I'm going
[2:01:40] to give you the Keys of the Kingdom of
[2:01:43] Heaven whatever you bind on Earth shall
[2:01:45] be bound in heaven whatever you loose on
[2:01:47] Earth will be loosed in heaven and so uh
[2:01:50] from that time
[2:01:52] fourth began Jesus to show to his
[2:01:56] disciples how he must go up to Jerusalem
[2:01:59] and suffer many things of the elders and
[2:02:01] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[2:02:03] and be raised again the third day then
[2:02:06] Peter the same guy that got the
[2:02:08] Revelation the same guy that had the got
[2:02:11] the keys to the kingdom that Peter took
[2:02:14] him and began to rebuke him and saying
[2:02:18] be it far from thee Lord this shall not
[2:02:22] be done unto thee then he turned and
[2:02:27] said to Peter get thee behind me Satan
[2:02:31] Thou Art an offense to
[2:02:35] me for thou savest not the things that
[2:02:37] be of God but those that be of men now I
[2:02:41] want you to
[2:02:42] notice that Peter received a great
[2:02:46] Revelation and turned right
[2:02:50] around and was able ble to say to him no
[2:02:56] those things aren't going to happen no
[2:02:58] come on Jesus come on you got to quit
[2:03:00] talking dark like that you you got to
[2:03:02] quit telling us these dark things
[2:03:04] everything's going to be all
[2:03:06] right now Jesus already knew what he was
[2:03:09] going to have to face he already knew it
[2:03:13] and now he's telling Peter he he's
[2:03:15] saying to
[2:03:17] Peter get thee behind me
[2:03:20] Satan he was not calling Peter Satan but
[2:03:24] the words that were coming out of
[2:03:26] Peter's mouth were an offense to
[2:03:30] him they were something that was trying
[2:03:33] to bring a stumbling to the Lord Jesus
[2:03:37] Christ to cause the flesh that he walked
[2:03:40] in to become weaker or weakened so that
[2:03:43] he would not fulfill what he had come to
[2:03:46] the Earth
[2:03:47] for words that came out of Peter's mouth
[2:03:51] as we talked on Wednesday or Tuesday
[2:03:53] night how that they are a weapon against
[2:03:57] us words that came out of Peter's mouth
[2:04:01] and Jesus said Satan get behind
[2:04:08] me so just so you
[2:04:12] know as we
[2:04:15] mature if you should say something as
[2:04:18] foolish as Peter was saying to one of us
[2:04:22] and we turn around and say Satan get
[2:04:25] thee behind
[2:04:30] me we're taking authority over the
[2:04:33] weapon that was formed
[2:04:35] amen because we
[2:04:37] recognize that there are certain things
[2:04:40] that come to our life for our life for
[2:04:43] our
[2:04:50] maturity Christ The Mystery of God
[2:04:53] revealed and now the church or now the
[2:04:56] Christ in the church is just being made
[2:04:59] known the whole thing is the revelation
[2:05:01] of God to take Eve back to her right
[2:05:05] position again with her husband notice
[2:05:07] and God is in is the husband of the
[2:05:10] church and the church is his bride now
[2:05:13] Peter when he called said Thou Art the
[2:05:16] Christ the son of the Living God now
[2:05:17] watch blessed are you Simon bar Jonah
[2:05:21] says which me means son of Jonas see
[2:05:23] blessed are you for Flesh and Blood
[2:05:25] never revealed this to you you never
[2:05:28] learned it from from from some school
[2:05:31] but my Father which is in heaven has
[2:05:34] revealed it to you notice what he said
[2:05:36] to him Upon This Rock that's Peter the
[2:05:40] predestinated seat of God that had
[2:05:43] received this light and given the keys
[2:05:44] to the kingdom Upon This Rock of
[2:05:47] revelation of who Jesus Christ is he is
[2:05:52] the full manifested God not a father Son
[2:05:56] and Holy Ghost and him being the second
[2:05:58] person Upon This Rock I'll build my
[2:06:01] church and the Gates of Hell shall never
[2:06:04] shake it down never Prevail against it
[2:06:07] see I'll build my church on this rock a
[2:06:10] revelation of Jesus Christ look Christ
[2:06:14] in you makes him the center of life of
[2:06:20] the Revelation see
[2:06:22] Christ's life in you makes him the
[2:06:25] center of the Revelation Christ in the
[2:06:28] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[2:06:30] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[2:06:35] you the complete revelation of the whole
[2:06:37] things see see what God is trying to
[2:06:41] do what is the new birth you'd say well
[2:06:44] brother randam what is the new birth
[2:06:46] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:06:50] personally to you amen see not you
[2:06:53] joined a church you shook a hand you
[2:06:55] done something different you set a Creed
[2:06:57] you promised to live by a code of rules
[2:07:00] but Christ the Bible he is the
[2:07:05] word he is the word that was revealed to
[2:07:08] you and no matter what anybody says what
[2:07:11] takes place it's Christ Pastor priest
[2:07:15] whatever it might be it's Christ in you
[2:07:17] that is the Revelation that Christ was
[2:07:21] built
[2:07:22] P
[2:07:31] now interestingly
[2:07:37] enough everywhere you look in the church
[2:07:42] world it's Easter
[2:07:47] Sunday first time I've mentioned that
[2:07:49] word
[2:07:50] today
[2:07:52] now I
[2:07:56] am not
[2:07:59] sure
[2:08:02] how from 3:00 Friday
[2:08:07] afternoon to Sunrise Sunday morning is
[2:08:10] three days and three
[2:08:12] nights and I know what brother brandham
[2:08:15] said so you don't have to throw a rock
[2:08:16] at
[2:08:17] me because quite frankly I just want to
[2:08:20] say today
[2:08:23] that that is not not enough for me
[2:08:26] to knock down and drag out
[2:08:30] over because all that matters to me
[2:08:32] today is that he's
[2:08:35] resurrected he's alive and he's living
[2:08:38] inside of
[2:08:40] me
[2:08:41] now this year is different from most
[2:08:46] years in
[2:08:48] that Easter weekend and Passover are not
[2:08:53] even in the same
[2:08:55] month Passover is not until
[2:08:59] April the 20th maybe something of that
[2:09:03] nature the end the end of April a month
[2:09:06] away
[2:09:08] Passover
[2:09:11] and when Jesus was taken to the
[2:09:15] cross at the we call it the passion week
[2:09:19] the time leading up to the cross when he
[2:09:21] was taken to the Cross you remember he
[2:09:24] had one last supper with his
[2:09:28] disciples and that last supper was a
[2:09:31] Passover seder and he said I'll not
[2:09:34] drink this cup anymore with you until I
[2:09:36] drink it a new in the
[2:09:39] Kingdom with you and he one last time he
[2:09:44] had this supper with his disciples and
[2:09:48] so this was during the Passover time it
[2:09:50] was the time time when Jerusalem was
[2:09:53] very crowded when all of the disciples
[2:09:57] uh not just the disciples but all of the
[2:10:00] the uh the men of Israel were to come up
[2:10:03] to Jerusalem they were to come to
[2:10:06] Jerusalem three times a year they were
[2:10:09] to come at Passover time at Pentecost
[2:10:12] and also at the Feast of Tabernacles in
[2:10:15] the fall that was the three feasts of
[2:10:17] the Lord that they were to come up to uh
[2:10:20] to Jerusalem for
[2:10:22] and so this would have been a very
[2:10:24] crowded time uh during during the Feast
[2:10:27] of Passover not
[2:10:29] necessarily Easter weekend as we call it
[2:10:32] so we we know that that the church world
[2:10:37] has made it very very Pagan uh because
[2:10:41] they pulled from uh a pagan Society to
[2:10:44] be able to add to it I I find it very
[2:10:47] interesting that uh the more you make it
[2:10:50] Pagan the more it becomes Pagan to the
[2:10:53] point that our president uh he he
[2:10:56] acknowledged that this was the the that
[2:10:59] it was uh going to be the visibility of
[2:11:02] transgenderism on this day and so as as
[2:11:06] as it becomes more Pagan it becomes more
[2:11:09] Pagan and and so we as the body of
[2:11:12] Christ are not partaking of uh of of the
[2:11:16] celebration of the rabbits and the eggs
[2:11:18] and and all of this fertility goddess
[2:11:21] and and all that is surrounded of what
[2:11:23] they call Easter but we do partake of
[2:11:25] the Resurrection The the death burial
[2:11:28] and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[2:11:30] Christ because had he not come in the
[2:11:32] flesh we would not we would still be
[2:11:35] under the under the blood of bulls and
[2:11:39] goats and the blood of bulls and goats
[2:11:41] could never cleanse us from our sin it
[2:11:45] could never bring the reconciliation
[2:11:48] that we needed uh in the separation that
[2:11:51] we had from our creator that blood could
[2:11:54] never bring us or reconcile us back to
[2:11:58] the Rock Christ Jesus it could never
[2:12:00] reconcile us yet when he came the Lord
[2:12:04] Jesus he came as a baby he was born he
[2:12:08] was not born on December the 25th but he
[2:12:11] was born and he walked on the earth for
[2:12:14] 33 and a half years and he was not
[2:12:17] crucified on Easter weekend but he was
[2:12:20] crucified
[2:12:22] he laid down his life for me he laid
[2:12:25] down his life that I could have life and
[2:12:29] have it more abundantly but if he had
[2:12:32] stayed in the
[2:12:35] grave he would have been like every
[2:12:37] other
[2:12:39] man and we would not be standing here
[2:12:41] talking about a
[2:12:43] messiah who died and was
[2:12:48] resurrected
[2:12:50] now
[2:12:52] we see
[2:12:54] that in all of the
[2:12:56] accounts when they took
[2:13:00] Jesus and they crucified him they took
[2:13:04] him and he put him on the hill of
[2:13:06] golgatha and they nailed him to a cross
[2:13:10] an execution stake and he was not the
[2:13:14] only one that was executed that day we
[2:13:17] sang before the word about even in death
[2:13:22] he
[2:13:23] remembered the thief hanging on the
[2:13:29] cross he wasn't the only
[2:13:33] Thief there was another one on the other
[2:13:35] side that was railing against him if you
[2:13:39] be the Son of God why don't you get us
[2:13:41] all down off of the
[2:13:44] crosses the other one
[2:13:48] recognized this is the same Rock
[2:13:51] that the children of Israel got water
[2:13:53] from in the
[2:13:55] wilderness this is the same rock that
[2:13:59] gave them honey that gave them
[2:14:01] sustenance this is the same Rock and his
[2:14:04] answer to them to Jesus was remember me
[2:14:09] when you come into your
[2:14:12] paradise and Jesus so graciously offered
[2:14:16] it to
[2:14:19] him now when
[2:14:24] his death was
[2:14:29] complete Matthew CH
[2:14:32] 27:
[2:14:35] 57-61 when the even was
[2:14:38] come there came a rich man of ARA named
[2:14:42] Joseph who also himself was Jesus's
[2:14:47] disciple he went to pilate and he B beg
[2:14:51] the body of
[2:14:53] Jesus then pilate commanded the body to
[2:14:56] be
[2:14:57] delivered and when Joseph had taken the
[2:15:00] body he wrapped it in a clean linen
[2:15:05] cloth and laid it in his own
[2:15:09] tomb which he had heun out in the
[2:15:16] Rock and he rolled a great Stone to the
[2:15:18] door of the Seiler and departed and
[2:15:21] there was Mary
[2:15:23] Magdalene and the other Mary sitting
[2:15:27] over against the
[2:15:31] Seiler now I as I was
[2:15:34] pondering out of the rock came
[2:15:38] water and out of the rock came
[2:15:42] honey and then I started thinking
[2:15:45] about where he was
[2:15:48] laid was Hune a tomb that was heun out
[2:15:53] of the
[2:15:54] Rock and I
[2:15:56] thought out of the rock came the
[2:16:01] rock out of the rock came The Rock in
[2:16:05] the end of the Sabbath it began to Dawn
[2:16:07] toward the first day of the week Came
[2:16:09] Mary Magdalene this is Matthew 28: 1-8
[2:16:13] Mary Magdalene and the others to to the
[2:16:15] separer and behold there was a great
[2:16:18] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[2:16:20] descend Ed from heaven and came and
[2:16:22] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[2:16:24] sat upon it now I would like to point
[2:16:28] out that it was the end of the Sabbath
[2:16:32] and it began to Dawn toward the first
[2:16:34] day of the week and Mary Magdalene and
[2:16:38] the other Mary came to the
[2:16:40] SRE and there was a great earthquake and
[2:16:43] the stone was rolled back for the angel
[2:16:47] of the Lord descended from heaven and
[2:16:49] came and rolled back the stone from the
[2:16:51] door and sat upon it and his countenance
[2:16:54] was like lightning his rment white as
[2:16:56] snow and for fear of the keepers did
[2:16:58] shake and became as dead men and the
[2:17:01] angel answered and said to the woman
[2:17:03] fear not for I know that you seek Jesus
[2:17:06] which was
[2:17:08] crucified he isn't
[2:17:14] here and it I I I don't guess that it
[2:17:18] ever occurred to me before
[2:17:21] that it was not
[2:17:25] necessary for the stone to be rolled
[2:17:28] back for Jesus to get out of that
[2:17:36] tomb there was an
[2:17:38] earthquake and the stone got rolled back
[2:17:42] because there was somebody coming to
[2:17:45] check on
[2:17:47] Jesus they were bringing spices after
[2:17:51] the
[2:17:53] Sabbath it's very early in the
[2:17:57] morning other gospels record this at the
[2:18:01] dawning of the
[2:18:04] Sun but Jesus was already
[2:18:08] risen
[2:18:11] so we in the church World in time pass
[2:18:15] came up with this idea to have an Easter
[2:18:18] Sunrise Service
[2:18:23] just like the
[2:18:29] pagans we need to read
[2:18:33] it
[2:18:41] Ezekiel
[2:18:43] Ezekiel chapter
[2:18:46] 8 the hand of the Lord is on
[2:18:49] Ezekiel and he is brought to the court
[2:18:54] of the house of the Lord verse 14 he
[2:18:57] brought me to the door of the Gate of
[2:18:59] the Lord's House which was toward the
[2:19:01] North and behold there were there were
[2:19:04] women weeping for
[2:19:06] tamuz then said he unto me have you seen
[2:19:09] this oh son of man turn yet again and
[2:19:12] you shall see greater Abominations than
[2:19:15] these and he brought me into the inner
[2:19:18] Court of the Lord's House and behold at
[2:19:21] the door of the Temple of the Lord
[2:19:23] between the porch and the altar were
[2:19:25] about five and 20 men with their backs
[2:19:27] toward the Temple of the Lord and their
[2:19:30] faces toward the East and they worship
[2:19:33] the son toward the
[2:19:35] east then he said unto me have you seen
[2:19:38] this oh son of man is it a light thing
[2:19:41] to the house of Judah that they commit
[2:19:43] the Abominations which they commit here
[2:19:45] for they have filled the land with
[2:19:47] violence and have returned to provoke me
[2:19:49] to anger and L
[2:19:51] they put the branch in their nose
[2:19:53] therefore will I also deal in Fury mine
[2:19:56] eyes shall not spare neither will I have
[2:19:59] pity and though they cry in mine ears
[2:20:01] with a loud voice yet will I not hear
[2:20:05] them now once
[2:20:08] again if that's what you want to do
[2:20:11] that's for you to
[2:20:13] do I'm
[2:20:15] glad as my wife says I'm glad in my
[2:20:18] spirit and I'm glad in my flesh
[2:20:21] that we left that behind
[2:20:26] am anybody remember those cold mornings
[2:20:29] out
[2:20:33] here just at the rising of the
[2:20:35] sun it was so
[2:20:37] cold the sun came up you didn't want to
[2:20:40] be out of bed that
[2:20:42] early yeah we
[2:20:45] remember but we do
[2:20:48] know that Jesus Christ
[2:20:51] was laid in the
[2:20:53] Tomb and he did
[2:20:56] rise he was laid in a
[2:20:59] rock but he did not have to have the
[2:21:01] stone rolled back to come out of
[2:21:04] there and he today is not in a tomb he
[2:21:09] is out of that rock came The Rock The
[2:21:12] Rock The Rock Christ Jesus and I stand
[2:21:15] here today letting you know that there
[2:21:18] is still water in the rock there is
[2:21:21] still Honey in the Rock out of the rock
[2:21:24] came water for the children of Israel
[2:21:26] out of the rock came honey for the
[2:21:28] children of Israel but out of that same
[2:21:31] Rock there is still coming water there
[2:21:34] is still coming Revelation there is
[2:21:36] still coming truths that transform us
[2:21:39] the rock Christ Jesus is alive today and
[2:21:44] he is still giving us water from that
[2:21:49] rock
[2:21:51] if the spirit Romans 8:11 if the spirit
[2:21:55] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[2:21:58] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[2:22:02] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[2:22:05] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[2:22:09] dwelleth in you because that he did not
[2:22:14] want us to be wandering around as empty
[2:22:19] vessels
[2:22:21] he didn't want us to
[2:22:23] be ragd
[2:22:26] dolls he wanted us to be able to be
[2:22:29] stretched he wanted us to be able to be
[2:22:31] pliable and so he told his disciples
[2:22:35] after his resurrection after he showed
[2:22:37] himself to them after he came after the
[2:22:40] rock came out of The Rock The Rock
[2:22:43] Christ Jesus went to his disciples and
[2:22:45] he told them I'm going away but I want
[2:22:48] you to go up to Jerusalem
[2:22:51] and I want you to T in the city of
[2:22:54] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[2:22:57] from on high and if that same spirit
[2:23:01] that dwelt in me and brought me up out
[2:23:04] of the Grave Jesus speaking if that same
[2:23:07] spirit is dwelling in you it will also
[2:23:10] Quicken your mortal bodies now friends
[2:23:13] there are times that our mortal bodies
[2:23:15] in this life need
[2:23:18] quickening we don't only need the
