TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and I want to say that God is doing extraordinary marvelous wonderful supernatural things in the earth and if you're not a part of the move of God it's time for you to connect in it's time for you to call on the name of the Lord receive salvation let him cover your sins wash you with his blood and fill you with his spirit if you are a Christian if you are a believer but you're not really born again you're a part of a church but you've never experienced God you mean to tell me preacher I can experience God for myself not only can you friend you must you must have an encounter with God and be changed as an individual how do I do that by searching the scripture by finding out what God's word has to say about a place of intimacy and relationship with Jesus Christ I tell you I thank God for the church it is a living moving breathing organism but I'm more interested in relationship than I am the church so it's very possible for you to be a part of a church and not know God you may know programs you may know liturgy but you may have never had an encounter with God for yourself it's time and I invite you to do that please contact our ministry if we can be of any service to you if we can encourage you give you teaching instruction anything that we can do to help you that's what we want to do and so we just release a blessing over you right now as you spend the next few minutes with us searching the scripture looking at what God's word has to say about our lives and what's available to us as believers in this hour I just pray that you'll be extreme bless today and I invite you once again to contact our ministry new hope revival ministries all the information is shown to you right there on the screen take it down write it down and contact us this week I know that you'll be blessed and I know we'll be blessed we are certainly interested in hearing from you and where you watch this program let's look right to the Word of God today shall we last week we started a teaching on how we exercise our spiritual senses now what what do we mean by that what do we mean by that well what does exercise mean to use you know it I found out oh I don't know year and a half ago or something like that I started trying to to do some serious exercise I've got a long way to go to be physically fit but I'm working on it I started doing some exercises and the first thing I found out was I had muscles in places that I didn't know I had any muscle well how did you find out well started using them and when I did they showed up with a lot of pain these muscles responded and they let me know I'm here I'm under worked I'm under used but I have been here all along and I mean for days I would be sore and even now if we concentrate on a certain area of muscles in a workout then the next day that soreness moves in but it's good it's really a good thing and this is going to sound very strange but I like it I have actually enjoyed the soreness somebody said well you must really be wacky well the reason why is because it tells me that I'm making progress it tells me that I am using my muscles and what I'm actually doing sounds pretty terrible doesn't it but I'm actually making tiny tears in those muscles and then my body so intricately designed by God rushes in to heal those stretches those tiny tear where the muscle has been stretched beyond its normal range of motion and in healing it strengthens the muscle it builds up and increases the the ability of that muscle to to help sustain my body and and strength and I noticed it the first time I noticed that I had a little more strength which when I had to pick up a heavy suitcase or a heavy bag of trash and I just tossed it up into the hay that felt good and so exercising the Bible talks about faith we'll kind of like a muscle every man's given a measure of faith but the more we use faith the more we exercise faith the stronger our faith becomes and so as we learn to exercise the senses of our spirit man we will find out that we're developing something we're developing a close relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and we're developing the ability to live a supernatural life and so in the natural we are given five senses that our body uses are actually more but five that we we learned in school five senses to contact or to have communication with our earthly environment what we see what we hear what we smell what we taste and what we are able to physically feel and that information that we gather it goes into our brain and spiritually though we receive a lot of that information into our soul somebody said well what in the world do you mean by that well you can go to the doctor and you can try it to believe God for your healing but you go to the doctor and he gives you a bad report you hear that bad report it could be cancer it could be heart disease it could be this it could be that and that information goes into your brain and it filters into your soul and if you're not careful you'll just give up and die really you'll just give up and die well that's what the doctor said your soul will be cast down the Bible talks about the casting the soul your your you'll be pulled down and that will be like a wet blanket on the fiery faith that you once had and so it affects you it affects you what you hear affects you what you see your I gate what comes in affects you and so forth and etc these these five senses affect us in our soulish realm that we talked about the fact that we're trying beings body soul and spirit because we're made in the image of God Genesis 1:27 said so God created man in his own image now we started the program last time with John chapter 3 with a scripture that says that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the Spirit is spirit so you have a fleshly man and you have a spiritual man the spiritual man is made up of both soul and spirit spirit is the inside of the inside we said that we are sort of made like a three-story house we reside on the middle floor we have the ability to move up into the higher floor which would be like contacting the heavenly realm having communication and contact with the Spirit of God or we can move down into the lower level which is that earthly realm and there's nothing wrong with that we're made to function on both an earthly plane and a heavenly plane the thing is we've got the earthly thing down pat we know how to do the earthly thing but we want to learn how to not walk after the flesh at all times in all things we can walk in our flesh this fleshly body but we don't want to walk after the flesh we don't want to walk in the in the attitude of the flesh we want to walk in an attitude of the Spirit of God we want to walk into a spiritual place in him we've been made to sit together in high places in heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're talking about what happens when we walk in the spirit and we need to do that we need to walk in the spirit if we walk in the flesh always we're going to fulfill the lust of the flesh but if we learn to walk in the spirit we're gonna fulfill the will of God now which would you rather do satisfy the realm of the flesh the desire of the flesh or satisfy God your Creator well I know the answer I know what your answer would be now man was made Genesis 1:27 in the image and in the likeness of God as God is a triune being Father Son and Holy Spirit you are a triune being body soul and spirit when Adam and Eve fell in the garden this is a long a long story we won't go into all the details of that we have shared different aspects of that with you on the program before we believe what the New Testament says Adam was not deceived the Bible clearly says it was Eve that was deceived in the fall well what in the world does that mean didn't the Bible say that Adam that she gave Adam to eat of the fruit and he did partake as well yes the Bible said that the difference is Eve did it by the spirit of deception Adam went into it with his eyes wide open he knew what he was doing so many simple isn't that worse well in some ways it is but when we read the teachings of the Apostle Paul we understand that what Adam was doing is he was covering the sin of Eve by partaking by taking on that sin he was then placing himself as the head of the house in a position to receive the judgment of God covering Eve not that she wouldn't be judged she was judged but Adam placed himself in a position where he would hear directly from God on the issue now why is that important because that's what our Lord Jesus did he who knew no sin now the difference between the first Adam and the second Adam our Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah is that Adam completely partook of the sin the Lord Jesus knew no sin but he took on our sin he carried our sin he did not participate in our sin Adam participated in the sin that Eve had committed our Lord Jesus took it on his physical body he bought it to the cross and and it was ugly it was ugly he was marred and scarred until he would hardly have been physically recognizable he wore physically the marks of sin and shame but he did not participate or partake in sin as Adam did now in the fall of Adam and Eve in the garden that ability to walk with God in the spirit was lost we read about in the scripture that Adam and Eve walked with God in the cool of the day can you imagine they walked and talked with all-mighty God they had communication they had communion they had fellowship with him what was the nature of their fellowship you might ask the answer is simple it was spirit to spirit spirit to spirit they were not communicating as you and I communicate flesh to flesh we communicate flesh to flesh and I should say in a normal situation we're communicating flesh to flesh now what why'd you say that preacher well there are times that when we're both walking together in the realm of the Spirit there is spiritual communication going on somebody said what do you mean well on the simplest level our spirit can bear witness the Bible talks about that that our spirit can bear witness with the spirit of somebody else and know that we both are children of God a kindred spirit have you ever met anybody for the first time maybe never even had verbal communication with them but you knew they were a child of God there was something being communicated on that spirit to spirit level a low level I might add but it was yet of of spirit to spirit communication this is how Adam Fellowship this is how Eve commune with God spirit to spirit their communication though they were walking Adam and Eve in their fleshly body it was their spirit it was that living part of God that he had deposited in them maybe we should look at that I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself but maybe we should look at that in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life life did you know in Hebrew that word life is plural and it could read that the Lord breathed into Adam the breath of lives now did he have more than one life yes what are you talking about well by the breath of God Adam was given soulish life and spirit life the breath of lives God scooped up clay and gave him a body a fleshly earthly tabernacle or house or body of flesh but when he breathed into him the breath of lives he released into Adam a life that is soul soulish and a life that is spirit spiritual very very interesting thing when Adam fell he lost the ability to communicate with God from the realm of the Spirit I believe that by regeneration by salvation by accepting the blood of Jesus Christ and becoming born again like we read about in John chapter 3 that the potential to restore back our ability to communicate with God's Spirit to spirit potentially that has been renewed and many of us are walking in the lower levels of spirit life but God is calling us to come up higher revelation chapter 4 verse 1 tells us if there is a door in heaven that is open it was open to John and the voice said come up here John come up here a little higher I want to show you things that must be Hereafter now yes that was a personal invitation for John on the Isle of Patmos but I believe that by the Rhema by the Spirit word God is saying you are also given an invitation to come up through the open door and communicate with your Creator spirit to spirit what does that mean well it means that you don't receive it through the flesh through the five senses you don't receive it through the soulish realm because the soulish realm is like a filter it filters things out it it allows some things in it filters some things out so if we can communicate with God's Spirit to spirit and not just flesh to flesh or in the realm of the soul then we can have a pure word from God we can have the pure life of God being exercised in us somebody said what would be the benefit of that well I believe that there's coming a great change to the body of Christ we've heard about the translation the resurrection where our physical bodies are going to be changed corruption is going to put on incorruption remember and mortality is going to put on immortality at the sound of the great trumpet of God the shout will come and the great Trump of God will sound and we will be changed well I believe that I believe this physical body I believe there will be some who are alive and who remain at the time of the coming of this Resurrection period in other words I believe many will die people are dying every day they're going to their graves but I do not believe I want you to know friend that I do not believe that the grave is the end of the story for the redeemed no it's not the end for the unredeemed no it is not the end there is a life here after this life there is a judgment for those who have rejected salvation the salvation that has been provided from their very Creator can you imagine rejecting a gift from your Creator the one who made you the one who allowed you to have the breath of life you said well you're kind of a dumb preacher I am a product of a sexual union between my mother and my father absolutely you are there's no doubt about that but I want you to know the life that is inside of you the breath of life didn't come from mommy and it didn't come from daddy it came predestinated for you to you by your Creator it was his will that you be alive and if it had not been his will you couldn't have got here if you don't wanted to do you understand what I'm saying and he has provided for us a way that we can come into oneness with him we can come into union with him you remember the Lord Jesus I know I talk and preach with my hands I know that could be a little bit distracting but and I could promise you that I wouldn't do it but I wouldn't be able to keep that promise so I will I won't make it but try to hear what I'm saying remember when Jesus was accused when he was questioned about his relationship with the father he said when you've seen me you've seen the father because I and my father are one can you imagine what a oneness this was what a union it was and yet we read about in the Garden of Gethsemane we read about a time when the will of his father and his human we'll see even our Lord Jesus had a human will that realm of the soul that that that realm where we have a will never before do we read that the will of the Father and the will of Jesus the son were in conflict but in the Garden of Eden they were in conflict somebody said now that is strange well it's the Bible it's what the Bible said jesus prayed if it be possible let this cup pass from me that was his will that was the will that was coming out of his inner being that was his will the will of his flesh we could say he said if there's any other way to do it father let's do it that way but because he walked in such union and agreement and oneness with the father the prayer didn't end there by saying let this cup pass from me he went on to say nonetheless nevertheless not my will you see there were two wheels not my will but your will be done that's oneness what if I told you that I believe that God is calling believers to that kind of oneness that kind of place of communion and communication with the father again in this hour a oneness with the heavenly bridegroom the Lord Jesus Christ and the earthly bride those who are being called into this overcoming company of people you really believe that rather I do I believe that with all my heart and I believe that one of the ways that we're going to come into that change for our physical body to be changed at the sound of the trumpet and the shout and the descending all of this we read about in Thessalonians this physical change with where many are going to get up out of the grave with a changed body we read about I believe the change doesn't start body on the flesh and then move into the spirit man I the change the resurrection the rapture the translation whatever you choose to call it the kingdom coming doesn't matter to me your terminology I believe that that change to this physical body doesn't begin in the physical body it begins in the spirit I believe there must be a change in our spirit man and I believe that if we have been given senses five plus senses to communicate with the earthly realm then in our spirit our human spirit we must have also some senses of how we can communicate and be in communion and be in contact with our Father with the realm of the Spirit and when we exercise so spiritual senses when we learn more about them what they are how to yield to God in all things how to bring our flesh into submission how to cause our soul to find its proper place so that we don't live by the soul you see part of the soul there's a lot of emotion in there and we don't want to live by emotion we want to live by faith we can have affections we can be connected affectionately connected to things that may not be good for us and that's one of the ways our soul gets its information or gets its life we could almost say is through the affections and reasoning reasonings can affect the soul but we don't want to be led by reasoning we don't want to be led by imagination we don't want to be led by memories we want to be led by the Spirit of God from the spirit out you see we want to invite the Lord Jesus to come and regenerate totally completely renew revive resurrect our human spirit back to how it was in the beginning in the Garden of Eden when Adam was freshly created in the image of God and the spirit that he had was not just a human spirit as we know it today and and really that's a little ambiguous this human spirit what is it well you know we have lots of questions about it when we search the scripture but Adam spirit I can I can tell you more about what Adam spirit was like than I can mine and yours because we've got information clear clear information that Adams spirit in the beginning was God's Spirit it was God's breath he had in him the very life of God he lost it in the fall but by the born-again experience there is a regeneration of that spirit that was lost and by exercising by communing by worshiping by soaking in the presence of God we are exercising our spirit life bringing it back to a place where one day it will rule Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit of God will set on the throne of our spirit it will be renewed and rejuvenated and revived and we will live from the spirit life not from the soulish realm not from the fleshly realm our spirit my I tell you that makes me excited it makes me want to reach in we said that yet we read in Genesis 2:7 the Lord breathed into Adam the breath of lives the life of the soul the life of the Spirit he breathed into him and the Bible says that he was not made from clay he was made from dust and dust all these tiny tiny little particles when we look up dust it reminds us of the dependency that Adam had on his creator it reminds us that man was created to be dependent on God we were made to be dependent on our Creator but technology humanism our earthly knowledge education so many things have come in to our life to our mind that man has come to a place where hey I don't need God there is no God I don't need God if there was a God I would need him but I don't even believe there is a God we've got a theist we've got agnostics and you know that used to be extreme you know if someone said I'm an atheist or someone said I'm an agnostic that was extreme we thought they were just really out there almost like some people look at Christians but that has become a common thought it's common to meet people who say I don't believe in God or to meet people who have such a broad concept of God that it's that it can't be defined I want you to know my understanding of God can be defined in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth that is my concept of God Genesis 1:1 and John chapter 1 verse 1 that says to us that that God and the word in the beginning was the word and the word was was God and the Word was God in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and then John 1:14 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth well my time is gone I've enjoyed this teaching let me pray for you that the Lord will just give you greater understanding father right now I pray for every person watching this program today release the Holy Spirit release understanding open up our hearts and bring us Oh father again restore us to that place of spirit to spirit fellowship with you life to life spirit to spirit oneness and union Wow that's what I want that's what we're after in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen thank you so much for watching the Eagles cry and please tune in again we bye bye for now [Music] you
