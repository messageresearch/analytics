[38:57] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Lord.
[39:06] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[39:13] Thank you Jesus.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; We've invited him
[39:25] and he has come.
[39:27] He is here.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:34] to meet every need that you have.
[39:37] Not one left undone.
[39:41] Just by the lifting of the hand,
[39:43] acknowledge, I have needs.
[39:47] The Lord sees the hand out across the
[39:50] stream. The Lord sees the needs that you
[39:52] have.
[39:55] He is not forgetful.
[39:58] I may forget, but he doesn't.
[40:04] All the loneliness that you may feel
[40:11] because you don't have companions around
[40:14] you.
[40:16] Let Jesus draw near to you today.
[40:19] Minister to your needs out across this
[40:22] camera.
[40:24] Would you remember this morning the
[40:26] family of brother Mike Orders from the
[40:29] church at uh Ruth, North Carolina,
[40:32] longtime friend, precious brother, song
[40:36] leader for three pastors there who went
[40:39] to be with the Lord after only three
[40:41] weeks of knowing that he was that sick.
[40:44] Would you ask the Lord to be with his
[40:46] whole family, his wife, Sister Susan or
[40:49] had a stroke some years ago and doesn't
[40:51] is not able to speak
[40:54] &gt;&gt; and um I know this is going to be very
[40:56] painful and has been very painful for
[40:58] her and the daughters and their families
[41:01] and the church family because he was a
[41:03] fixture
[41:04] &gt;&gt; for the missionary camps and even youth
[41:07] camps years ago. We have quite a few
[41:10] traveling this weekend. Baby showers in
[41:13] Mississippi and uh some in Indiana and
[41:18] various other places. Let's pray that
[41:21] God will protect them and keep them on
[41:23] the road.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Uh pray for our fellowship meetings next
[41:27] weekend. Yes.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; We need a breakthrough that's deeper
[41:30] than a feeling, deeper than an emotion.
[41:32] Yes.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; We need God to show up,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; search our hearts, and prepare us for
[41:37] what he wants to do.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Let's take these needs to the Lord
[41:43] today.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon,
[41:46] &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. Sister Sharon is very sick
[41:49] this morning. She is not well at all.
[41:51] Needs to be remembered to the Lord in
[41:53] prayer. She wears her body out helping
[41:55] take care of other people. Yeah.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; And she really needs a touch this
[41:59] morning.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[42:01] Do that for our sister.
[42:05] [Music]
[42:12] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[42:16] Amen.
[42:20] He is here.
[42:23] Holy,
[42:25] holy.
[42:27] I will bless his name again.
[42:34] He is here.
[42:38] Listen
[42:40] closely.
[42:42] Hear him calling
[42:45] out your name.
[42:49] He is here.
[42:53] You can touch him. and you will never
[43:00] be. Sing again. Oh, he is here.
[43:08] Hallelu,
[43:09] [Music]
[43:11] he is here.
[43:15] Amen.
[43:18] He is here.
[43:22] Holy,
[43:24] holy,
[43:26] I will bless his name
[43:31] again.
[43:33] He
[43:35] is here.
[43:37] Listen
[43:39] closely.
[43:41] Hear him calling
[43:45] out your name.
[43:48] He is here and you can touch him. You
[43:57] will never
[43:59] be.
[44:00] [Music]
[44:01] Before we do the prayer, can we sing the
[44:04] second verse? I search for peace among
[44:10] the shadows so dark and lonely. Did you
[44:15] look for him?
[44:18] I gave up on finding
[44:22] any
[44:24] strong or lasting
[44:28] love.
[44:30] [Music]
[44:32] I tasteed
[44:35] all the things that sin could think to
[44:42] offer me.
[44:44] But today I'll feast on mana
[44:50] from above.
[44:55] And why? Because he is here. Oh hallelu
[45:02] [Music]
[45:05] he is here. Oh amen.
[45:10] [Music]
[45:12] He is here.
[45:15] Holy,
[45:17] holy.
[45:19] We will bless your name again.
[45:26] Oh, he is here. Won't you listen
[45:31] closely?
[45:33] Hear him calling
[45:37] out your name.
[45:40] He is here and you can touch him.
[45:47] You will never
[45:51] be the same.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, as we come before you
[45:57] this morning, Lord, we have so much to
[45:59] be thankful for.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Reflect on the words of the song, Lord.
[46:03] And I I foolishly went looking for
[46:06] satisfaction in things in the world. I
[46:08] confess, Lord, that I made many
[46:10] mistakes, but you were greater.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; You called us when we were young. Lord,
[46:15] I believe there are many here that have
[46:16] that testimony that they've heard the
[46:18] call of God on their life, and they know
[46:20] that the only true way and living way is
[46:24] found in Jesus Christ.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're our healer this morning.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; You're our provider.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we have need of we
[46:33] can't find in you. There's no sickness
[46:36] that you can't heal.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, when brother
[46:41] Brandon was preaching here across the
[46:43] nation, he said that you couldn't heal
[46:45] us today because you did it already.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; We believe your word. We believe that
[46:50] when Isaiah prophesied about you taking
[46:53] those straes, that it was a finished
[46:55] work when you took those stripes. So
[46:57] today, we lay hold of that promise,
[46:59] Lord.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we testify once again
[47:02] that the world does not satisfy us, God.
[47:06] There's no job, there's no house,
[47:09] there's no car, there's no bank account,
[47:12] Lord, that would satisfy us. We come
[47:14] here today because we found that our
[47:17] only satisfaction is in you.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; You're the peacem maker, Lord, in times
[47:22] of trouble. You speak to the storm when
[47:25] it's out of control. You comfort the
[47:27] hearts in our loss today. Lord, there's
[47:29] prayer requests that have been made
[47:31] mentioned and we bring them before you
[47:33] believing you're the only one that can
[47:34] truly comfort. Lord, we might speak
[47:37] words, but if your presence were to come
[47:39] to those people like your presence came
[47:41] to us this morning, oh God,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; may you help us, oh God,
[47:47] &gt;&gt; may you grant us greater revelation of
[47:49] the way that you have provided.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; May we become what you are. We know
[47:54] you're the yes and the amen, but may we
[47:56] become the yes and the amen to you,
[47:58] Lord. May we stand on your side. If
[48:01] there were a line drawn today, oh God,
[48:03] may we cross the line to stand with you.
[48:06] May we stand with your word. And if you
[48:08] show us something today that we find as
[48:10] we look at the word of God and we see a
[48:13] reflection that's unlike you, we ask you
[48:14] to bring the pruning shear, Lord. Cut it
[48:16] off, cut it out, get the grubbing ho,
[48:19] Lord. Whatever it takes, set us free of
[48:21] oursel that you might have your way in
[48:23] our life.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; We need you, oh God. We need you.
[48:27] There's no God like our God.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; We look to you for provision. We look to
[48:31] you for healing. And we claim all these
[48:34] promises today because you did it for
[48:36] us, not because and simply because we
[48:38] couldn't do it for oursel.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the burning lamp.
[48:44] You're all of it.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; We believe you're here today. Will you
[48:48] have your way? May every person be
[48:51] seated in their seat with that
[48:53] magnifying glass. Not for shame or not
[48:55] for reproach or not for embarrassment,
[48:57] Lord, but that you would be better
[48:59] reflected at the end of the day when we
[49:01] step in front of the mirror. We say, "I
[49:03] I look a little bit more like my king
[49:05] today. I'm dressed in the robes of his
[49:08] word today." By your grace, we'll praise
[49:10] you for it. For we believe you're the
[49:12] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[49:14] that you want a bride prepared. Thank
[49:16] you, Lord. We ask it all in the lovely
[49:19] name of our Messiah, the Lord Jesus
[49:21] Christ. Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:33] I bless your name.
[49:37] [Music]
[49:39] I bless your name.
[49:46] I give you honor,
[49:50] [Music]
[49:53] give you praise.
[49:56] [Music]
[49:59] You are the life,
[50:06] the truth, the way.
[50:12] I bless your name.
[50:19] I bless your name.
[50:25] Some midnight
[50:28] hour.
[50:32] If you should find
[50:38] you're in a prison
[50:42] [Music]
[50:46] in your mind.
[50:48] [Music]
[50:51] Reach out and praise.
[50:58] defy
[51:00] those chains
[51:03] [Music]
[51:04] and they will fall
[51:11] in Jesus
[51:14] name. Can you lift your hands and sing
[51:16] to the Lord? I bless your name.
[51:25] I bless your name.
[51:31] I give you honor.
[51:39] Give you praise.
[51:44] You are the life,
[51:51] the truth, the way.
[51:57] I bless your name.
[52:04] I bless your name. You are the life, the
[52:08] truth, the way.
[52:11] You are the life,
[52:18] the truth, the way.
[52:24] I bless your name.
[52:31] I bless
[52:33] your name.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:40] Yes, Lord.
[52:43] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[52:47] Praise you, Lord.
[52:50] We bless you, Jesus.
[52:53] We bless you, Jesus.
[52:55] [Applause]
[52:57] Oh Lord, you healed our body. You healed
[53:01] our mind. You gave us grace when we
[53:04] didn't deserve grace.
[53:07] Lord, you lifted us up when we were in
[53:10] the midst. You brought us up now, Lord.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you, Jesus.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Precious Lord,
[53:26] &gt;&gt; you may have your seats today.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Precious Jesus.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Kate is getting ready to
[53:33] lead us as we continue worshiping the
[53:35] Lord.
[53:37] We're going to give as giving unto the
[53:39] Lord with our tithe and offering.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for what he is doing,
[53:46] what the Lord Jesus is doing.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; We're glad that you're here in the house
[53:51] of the Lord with us. Jason, it's good to
[53:53] see you and Kelly and Jaden today. We've
[53:56] missed you. So glad that you're here
[53:58] today. Uh brother Jerry, it's good to
[54:01] see you and your mother. We're glad that
[54:02] the Lord is healing you and bringing you
[54:05] on through. Sister Lily with her
[54:07] children Caleb and Aaliyah. We're glad
[54:09] that they're here just a few days before
[54:12] the meeting. Going to stay uh for a few
[54:14] days after. We're glad that they're
[54:16] here, but we're just glad as a body that
[54:19] we're gathered together in the presence
[54:21] of the Lord, knowing that he is the same
[54:24] yesterday and today
[54:27] and tomorrow and the next day. I may not
[54:31] know about tomorrow. I don't know what
[54:34] tomorrow holds. I don't know what the
[54:36] next five minutes holds, but I'm in his
[54:38] presence. And so whatever he wants to
[54:41] do, I want to be moldable and yieldable
[54:44] in his hands because I know that if I
[54:47] place my life in his hands, though I may
[54:49] not know what tomorrow might hold, I
[54:52] know that if I'll just place myself in
[54:55] his hands, everything will be all right.
[54:58] Whatever comes, it doesn't come to stay.
[55:01] It comes to be behind me. Because what
[55:03] was yesterday is now yesterday. It's
[55:06] behind me. And I'm facing today with the
[55:09] grace and the goodness of God the same
[55:12] as I will tomorrow. But why worry about
[55:14] tomorrow? Tomorrow will take care of
[55:16] itself. I'm here today in the presence
[55:19] of the Lord to do what he wants me to
[55:22] do. I'm thankful and grateful for his
[55:25] good grace. Brother Elas, will you come?
[55:28] and Ian will let these two brothers come
[55:30] to you today for the tithe and the
[55:32] offering. Our our Jerusalem rent
[55:34] payment, the quarterly payment is due
[55:37] this week. And so, uh, we're a little
[55:39] bit short. If you have anything that the
[55:41] Lord would lay on your heart to to tuck
[55:43] in today to add to it, we'd be so
[55:46] thankful. We don't understand everything
[55:48] that the Lord calls us to do, but we
[55:50] just try to be obedient to the calling,
[55:53] knowing that he, the one that called us,
[55:55] is able to accomplish what he wants to
[55:57] accomplish. Let's worship together as
[56:00] we're getting ready for the preaching of
[56:01] the word.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; This is just a simple song. Sing it with
[56:05] me. You believe he's born a spirit out.
[56:15] Lord, I seek you.
[56:18] Help me find you.
[56:22] How I need your touch.
[56:29] Find my dry
[56:33] broken places
[56:37] thirsty for your love.
[56:44] Lord, forgive me
[56:48] if I've wondered
[56:51] far away from you.
[56:56] [Music]
[56:59] You are all I
[57:03] ever needed.

[57:16] and fall just like the rain.

[58:28] if I've wondered
[58:32] far away from you.

[59:06] soul? Come and fall and rest on me.

[59:25] now. Pour your spirit out.

[59:37] Fall just like the rain.
[59:40] Oh, saturate
[59:43] my thirsty soul. Come and fall fresh on
[59:49] me.
[59:51] Come fill this cup again.
[59:55] Oh, won't you heal my heart
[59:58] and make me whole.
[1:00:03] I need you now. Pour your spirit out,
[1:00:10] Lord. Pour your spirit out on me and
[1:00:17] fall just like the rain.
[1:00:20] Yes. Come saturate
[1:00:23] my thirsty. So come and fall on me
[1:00:31] and fill my cup again.
[1:00:34] Oh, won't you heal my heart
[1:00:38] and make me whole. Oh Lord, I need you
[1:00:45] now.
[1:00:47] Pour your spirit out.
[1:00:50] I need you now. Pour your spirit out.
[1:00:58] And Lord, I lift
[1:01:02] your
[1:01:04] name.
[1:01:07] It's your hoby
[1:01:11] name.

[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes you are.
[1:03:50] Yes, you are.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; You came from heaven to earth to show
[1:03:57] the way
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; from the earth to the cross.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; My
[1:04:05] pain. From the cross to the grave and
[1:04:10] from the grave to the sky. Lord, I lift
[1:04:15] your name on high.
[1:04:18] One more time.
[1:04:20] You came from heaven to earth to show
[1:04:26] the way. From the earth to the cross. My
[1:04:32] destiny.
[1:04:35] From the cross on to the grave. From the
[1:04:39] grave to the sky. Lord, I lift your name
[1:04:44] on.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name.
[1:04:49] Lord, I lift your name on
[1:04:54] high.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. We want to lift up your holy
[1:05:00] name.
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:05] You're holy.
[1:05:08] You are holy, Jesus.
[1:05:12] You are holy, Lord.
[1:05:15] You deserve the highest praise.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's
[1:05:26] wonderful and worthy
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; to be praised. Just play a moment.
[1:05:33] I want you to just take a moment, just a
[1:05:35] moment,
[1:05:37] and I want you to examine
[1:05:40] your own heart just a little more in the
[1:05:42] monitor.
[1:05:45] I want you to examine your own heart.
[1:05:48] I've carefully watched this body this
[1:05:51] morning watching other people.
[1:05:55] I'm so thankful that we were able to
[1:05:57] push through some of that in praise and
[1:06:01] in worship and a beautiful atmosphere
[1:06:03] was created for most of us. But I
[1:06:06] watched how many people are watching
[1:06:08] other people when it's time to be
[1:06:11] watching him. That's right.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to examine your own heart.
[1:06:16] This is not a a judgment and it's
[1:06:18] certainly not condemnation at all.
[1:06:22] It's doing my job. It's doing what I was
[1:06:24] called to do. I want you to examine your
[1:06:27] heart just a moment. And I want you to
[1:06:29] ask yourself, why am I here this
[1:06:31] morning?
[1:06:33] Am I here because I felt a religious
[1:06:36] duty to be here? Am I here because I
[1:06:38] didn't want to disappoint my pastor?
[1:06:42] Am I here because I'm leading my family
[1:06:44] and I I've got to be an example before
[1:06:47] them?
[1:06:49] Am I here because I didn't want to be
[1:06:51] talked about?
[1:06:54] Am I here because I understand what this
[1:06:57] time is about? It's about him. It's
[1:07:01] about feasting in his presence
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; and it's about applying his word.
[1:07:08] The reality is every one of us could be
[1:07:12] somewhere else.
[1:07:14] We could be at the lake. We could be on
[1:07:16] the beach. We could be at the ball game.
[1:07:19] We could be in front of Netflix.
[1:07:23] But we're here and we need to know why
[1:07:26] this morning.
[1:07:28] We need to know why we're here.
[1:07:32] Was it somebody else's expectation that
[1:07:37] motivated you to push and get here? Or
[1:07:40] was it a heart that desires him?
[1:07:46] Above all things,
[1:07:48] you desire him. Maybe you came to please
[1:07:51] a loved one. That's not enough.
[1:07:55] It's just simply not enough. May maybe
[1:07:57] maybe it's because it's what you've
[1:07:59] always done.
[1:08:02] Well, the only way that that does us any
[1:08:04] good is if we're satisfied with where we
[1:08:06] are. Because if we always do what we've
[1:08:10] always done, we'll always be what we've
[1:08:13] always been.
[1:08:15] And I don't think that's any of our
[1:08:17] testimony today. Uh I feel that every
[1:08:20] one of us who are sincere before the
[1:08:22] Lord would say, "I've got to have more
[1:08:23] of you, Lord. I've got to have more of
[1:08:26] you, Jesus. I've got to have more of
[1:08:28] you, Lord. I've got to live this thing
[1:08:31] out
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; day after day. So, search your heart.
[1:08:34] I'll give you just a few moments of
[1:08:36] quiet. Just just a little moment or two.
[1:08:38] Search your heart.
[1:08:41] Why are you here?
[1:08:43] What did you come for?
[1:08:46] What did you come to receive?
[1:08:48] What did you come to give?
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:23] If you've come up with an answer
[1:09:26] that's different
[1:09:28] from what you would like for it to be,
[1:09:32] would you just ask the Lord now? Just
[1:09:34] ask ask him. I I think it's appropriate
[1:09:37] to say, "Lord, forgive me if I was
[1:09:40] motivated by anything other than a deep
[1:09:42] love and a hunger for you and who you
[1:09:45] are and desiring to be with your
[1:09:48] presence. If for any other reason, Lord,
[1:09:51] I repent of that. It might be
[1:09:53] well-intention. It might not be in
[1:09:56] itself a sin to do it for somebody else,
[1:10:00] but you'll miss what God has for you if
[1:10:03] you're here for any other reason. So
[1:10:06] Lord, we just pray that you would help
[1:10:09] us and forgive our hearts if we have
[1:10:13] been motivated by any other thing
[1:10:16] and that you will redeem the time that
[1:10:18] we now have together. And you will give
[1:10:20] us grace to feast on your word and apply
[1:10:24] it
[1:10:26] first to our own lives before we even
[1:10:30] consider somebody else's failure or
[1:10:33] shortcoming.
[1:10:35] and we'll we'll praise you for this.
[1:10:37] It's it's it's
[1:10:39] your finger in our heart that we desire,
[1:10:43] pointing us
[1:10:45] to whatever it is that we need to lay
[1:10:47] open and bear before you today. Help us,
[1:10:51] King Jesus.
[1:10:54] Help us, King Jesus.
[1:10:56] Now, sing another chorus of that if you
[1:10:58] would before we go to the word this
[1:11:01] morning. Hallelujah.
[1:11:04] Hallelujah. Thank you, lamb.
[1:11:07] Let this be your opportunity to just
[1:11:10] tell him how much you love him for
[1:11:12] another moment. God bless you as you do
[1:11:14] that.
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; From the earth to the cross, my destiny
[1:11:30] from the cross to the grave. Oh yes.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And from the grave to the sky.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; I lift up your name.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you came from heaven to earth to
[1:11:49] show the way from the earth to the
[1:11:54] cross. I destipate.
[1:11:59] From the cross to the grave. From the
[1:12:03] grave to the sky. Lord, I
[1:12:08] one more time. You came from heaven to
[1:12:10] earth.
[1:12:13] You came from heaven to earth to show
[1:12:17] the way to show the way.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; From the earth.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; From the earth to the cross.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; My debt to pay. my death.
[1:12:27] And from the cross on to the grave, from
[1:12:31] the grave to the sky. Lord, I lift your
[1:12:36] name on high.
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:41] Lift your name on high.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name on high.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I lift your name on high.
[1:12:57] Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] We lift your name on high, Lord.
[1:13:04] Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] Let's thank the Lord for these
[1:13:10] musicians.
[1:13:12] Now, do do
[1:13:14] you see what you did? you you instead of
[1:13:19] uh entering into a place of freedom, you
[1:13:22] sort of tightened down.
[1:13:25] And and maybe it's because you felt on
[1:13:27] the spot. But I don't want you to feel
[1:13:29] on the spot. You're not here for me, but
[1:13:32] I'm not here to play either.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; This is my life.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand this is my
[1:13:40] life. This isn't what I do for a
[1:13:43] paycheck. No, sir.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, no, sir.
[1:13:47] Amen. I was going through the history
[1:13:50] uh this week, spending some time putting
[1:13:53] some things together and trying to
[1:13:55] organize
[1:13:57] over 200,000 pictures. Can you imagine?
[1:14:03] And picking just a few from the
[1:14:05] different eras and the and the different
[1:14:08] decades and periods of being together as
[1:14:11] a body. And I came across a time when
[1:14:15] there just wasn't any money. I mean, way
[1:14:18] back, there just wasn't any money. And
[1:14:21] we were I mean, we were just barely
[1:14:24] getting through, just barely getting by.
[1:14:27] I had a small inheritance left over from
[1:14:30] my grandmother. And that's what I lived
[1:14:32] on. That's what I paid bills with
[1:14:34] because we were fighting and struggling.
[1:14:36] And to think that we have come this far
[1:14:40] to where the campground and the church
[1:14:42] and the equipment and the and is paid
[1:14:45] for
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; and the grace of God is among us, it's
[1:14:48] an unbelievable journey. But if we lose
[1:14:52] our identity as a separate people, as a
[1:14:57] separated people, if we lose our
[1:15:00] identity uh and become one of a bunch,
[1:15:05] then then it's all in vain.
[1:15:08] If we don't know why we came this
[1:15:11] morning, then we haven't come very far
[1:15:13] spiritually at all. So maybe we've come
[1:15:17] far with technology and maybe we've come
[1:15:19] far financially, but we we must know
[1:15:23] that we are on a spiritual journey.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; This is this is everything to us.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; This is our way. This is our eternity
[1:15:32] that's being prepared.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; This is not about today or tomorrow,
[1:15:36] folks.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; This is about all eternity, what we're
[1:15:42] building here uh this morning. And so I
[1:15:44] want to ask you now, don't don't shut
[1:15:48] down because uh you had a little bit of
[1:15:52] a a corrective word to try to pull us
[1:15:55] back into course and then maybe clamp
[1:15:58] down and and punish the preacher this
[1:16:01] morning. You you might not want to do
[1:16:04] such a thing as that,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; but yet just say, "Lord, I I can't speak
[1:16:09] for anybody else. I'm not responsible
[1:16:11] for, but I know why I'm here. I'm here
[1:16:14] to have a word change my life.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I plan to do something about what I
[1:16:19] hear. And I believe most of you, many of
[1:16:21] you do. I want to encourage you not to
[1:16:23] watch one another. Doesn't matter who
[1:16:26] what they're doing. Somebody said, "My
[1:16:28] praise is hindered by watching somebody
[1:16:30] else." Well, that's a simple solution.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; You don't need to ask me about it. Stop
[1:16:36] watching them.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of them. It's it's
[1:16:40] none of your business how somebody else
[1:16:42] worships the Lord,
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; whether they're worthy to do it or not
[1:16:47] worthy or I'm I don't know that I'm
[1:16:49] worthy to worship him, but he calls me.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; So, keep your eyes off of one another if
[1:16:55] you're going to overcome.
[1:16:57] and uh apply every word of God to your
[1:16:59] life first,
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; then to your family,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; your house first,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; and then if you have time, I I think
[1:17:08] that'll keep us really busy.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; But if you have any leftover time, then
[1:17:13] you can look around and see if somebody
[1:17:14] else is doing just right. This morning,
[1:17:17] it's about you and him.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say, "Amen."
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Let's open our Bibles this morning. if
[1:17:24] you have them with you. I want to read
[1:17:28] again Psalm 66
[1:17:31] 10 11 and 12. I want to read again
[1:17:35] Jeremiah 48:11
[1:17:38] and then we will uh go into the portion
[1:17:41] of this series for today. Psalm
[1:17:44] 66:10-12.
[1:17:47] For thou, oh God, this is the scripture
[1:17:50] that the Lord has given for the vessel
[1:17:52] of misunderstanding. For thou, oh God,
[1:17:55] hast proved us. Thou hast tried us as
[1:18:00] silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into
[1:18:05] the net. Thou ladest affliction upon our
[1:18:10] loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over
[1:18:16] our heads. We went through fire
[1:18:21] and water, but thou brought us out. You
[1:18:27] have brought us out. Is anybody here
[1:18:31] that has been brought out?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Out of a sin life,
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; out of a selfish life, out of a
[1:18:38] religious life. you have brought us out
[1:18:41] into a wealthy place or in Hebrew the
[1:18:46] word is it would also be translated a
[1:18:50] broad a wide place of provision. We
[1:18:54] could say oh God you have enlarged our
[1:18:58] borders. Aren't you glad that he has
[1:19:01] given us fresh territory in the spirit
[1:19:04] realm? I am thankful for that. And then
[1:19:07] the theme of the series, Jeremiah 48:11,
[1:19:10] Moab hath been at ease from his youth,
[1:19:14] and he hath settled on his leaves, and
[1:19:16] hath not been emptied from vessel to
[1:19:19] vessel, neither hath he gone into
[1:19:21] captivity. Therefore, his taste remained
[1:19:25] in him, and his scent is not changed.
[1:19:29] May God add his blessing to the reading
[1:19:32] of his word. You may be seated. I know
[1:19:34] you're longing to do so. A and I would
[1:19:37] be too after standing so long. I want
[1:19:40] you to go with me again now to uh
[1:19:44] another portion of scripture if you will
[1:19:46] to the book of Nehemiah.
[1:19:49] Nehemiah. It it it's you know I was
[1:19:52] surprised
[1:19:54] I could only find one time. I must have
[1:19:57] not done a proper search. Uh, so I may
[1:20:01] be incorrect, but I could only find one
[1:20:04] time that brother Brandham just briefly,
[1:20:07] very briefly, not even a whole sentence,
[1:20:10] uh, referred to Nehemiah. It's a huge
[1:20:13] book of the Bible and not huge, but a
[1:20:15] but a fairly significant chunk of, uh,
[1:20:18] of Old Testament Bible and, uh, he was
[1:20:22] busy with other things. Thank God for
[1:20:24] that. I needed to know some other
[1:20:26] things. Amen. But not being one of those
[1:20:29] who believes that uh we are somehow
[1:20:33] limited to only speak about scriptures
[1:20:36] that he spoke about. You see God gave me
[1:20:39] the whole book before he gave me the
[1:20:41] understanding of the book. It was all
[1:20:44] mine. These scriptures are mine. All
[1:20:47] scripture is given to me to you for
[1:20:50] instruction. is profitable for for for
[1:20:54] rebuke and for uh correction and for
[1:20:57] instruction.
[1:20:59] And I'm going to ask you at the end of
[1:21:00] the service, don't let me forget to to
[1:21:03] do the birthdays and so forth. I uh
[1:21:06] wasn't able to do that in the beginning,
[1:21:07] but I don't want to I don't want to
[1:21:09] forget that. Uh so there there may be
[1:21:12] something in a passage that could not be
[1:21:16] covered in the ministry uh of of our
[1:21:19] prophet that would be of benefit for us
[1:21:22] today as well. And and you know uh I
[1:21:25] love Nehemiah. Um I don't preach about
[1:21:29] him a lot. The last time I really
[1:21:31] preached about him was 2004
[1:21:35] and this is 2025.
[1:21:37] So that's a long time just after we
[1:21:41] moved into this building. Uh we were so
[1:21:44] happy to be here. We moved in uh in
[1:21:47] July, I think it was. And then our uh
[1:21:50] meetings followed a couple weeks after
[1:21:53] uh for the dedication and we had our
[1:21:57] first indoor camp meeting which I liked
[1:21:59] from the beginning.
[1:22:01] Just like the air conditioning from the
[1:22:03] beginning. And uh I know some people
[1:22:06] said, "Oh, it's just not the same." It
[1:22:08] is to me. It's all the same. Uh it
[1:22:11] doesn't matter whether it's uh uh uh
[1:22:13] under the tentop tabernacle or whether
[1:22:16] it's in here. But I find that uh people
[1:22:19] can listen a whole lot better when when
[1:22:21] they're comfortable or when they have to
[1:22:23] put on a sweater instead of uh instead
[1:22:26] of sweat rags on their heads, etc. Did
[1:22:29] you know I was looking as mentioned
[1:22:31] earlier through the history and we had a
[1:22:33] bunch of camp meetings in July?
[1:22:37] What was wrong with us in July? You
[1:22:40] choose to have one under the tabernacle
[1:22:43] in July.
[1:22:45] But we made it and we're thankful for
[1:22:49] every victory for all that God did. But
[1:22:52] when we first moved in this building, I
[1:22:54] preached a series on restoring the gates
[1:22:57] of Jerusalem. And I preached uh
[1:22:59] originally how how Ezra was given this
[1:23:03] opportunity to go back and to try to
[1:23:06] begin restoring the fallen and broken
[1:23:09] down city of Jerusalem. And but it was
[1:23:14] Nehemiah who who really took the
[1:23:17] commission and uh Ezra a scribe. But
[1:23:21] Nehemiah, he really had a commission
[1:23:24] from the Lord. Let us arise and build.
[1:23:27] There's something still being built.
[1:23:30] Maybe not in the physical, but there's
[1:23:32] something still being built in the
[1:23:34] spiritual this morning. A kingdom.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; A kingdom that is within and it is also
[1:23:41] without. A kingdom that is within
[1:23:44] individually, but it is without
[1:23:46] corporately.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; We are the kingdom of God.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And and so the kingdom of God is larger
[1:23:55] than the church. It's larger than even
[1:23:58] the bride for instance. It's huge. This
[1:24:01] kingdom of God, it's in the hearts of
[1:24:03] men and uh there there are those who are
[1:24:06] part of the church and they make up part
[1:24:09] of the kingdom and there are those who
[1:24:10] are part of the overcoming bride and
[1:24:12] they make up a part of the kingdom. And
[1:24:14] there are those who have not had any
[1:24:16] light except to call on the name of the
[1:24:20] Lord
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; and find grace and forgiveness for sin.
[1:24:24] But they also have a portion, a part in
[1:24:27] the kingdom of our God. Aren't you glad?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And even though many believe that there
[1:24:33] are no uh bride members left in
[1:24:36] denominational systems, uh I now have
[1:24:39] come to understand that uh there are
[1:24:41] many denominational systems that have
[1:24:43] been built around the message of the
[1:24:45] hour.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; So surely there must be some bride among
[1:24:49] them. Yeah.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And there must be. Some are just foolish
[1:24:53] virgins and that's all they will ever be
[1:24:56] able to be. But they're part of the
[1:24:57] kingdom.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; But there may be some yet in the Baptist
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; church, in the Methodist church,
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; in the Pentecostal church. There may be
[1:25:10] some yet in the Catholic church,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; in the Mormon church. May God give you
[1:25:17] and I grace to be salty, to be full of
[1:25:21] light, to live our lives. God, put us in
[1:25:24] front of who you want us in front of so
[1:25:27] that everyone who's to be a part of a
[1:25:29] particular uh section of your kingdom
[1:25:33] that they would hear and come.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Whatever Whatever it is, we're not the
[1:25:37] only ones who have eternal life.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you, but I'm
[1:25:41] glad. Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's not a monopoly.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; I'm glad aren't the only ones who have
[1:25:50] eternal life.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm not one of those. So, I'm not
[1:25:54] putting myself in that place. I'm a I'm
[1:25:57] a I'm a Jesus fan.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, I'm a Berean.
[1:26:05] If you want to know my New Testament
[1:26:07] identity, I'm one of those who was from
[1:26:09] Berea
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; who searched the scriptures diligently
[1:26:12] and daily and often.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; To to see if these things be so.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; And if we don't do that, we'll follow a
[1:26:19] trend
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; instead of the leadership of the Holy
[1:26:22] Ghost.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; I've got to follow him.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; If you follow me following him, that's
[1:26:27] up to you.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; But I've got to follow him.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; I want you with all my heart. So, if you
[1:26:33] will look at Nehemiah, I love the story
[1:26:38] and I'm going to have to cut it kind of
[1:26:40] short because when I spoke on it the
[1:26:43] last time, well, it was months in the
[1:26:45] making, you know, and since I'm in
[1:26:47] another series this month, I I got to I
[1:26:49] can't hit but the highlight. Uh, but I
[1:26:52] do want your attention. Nehemiah 6 6-8.
[1:26:55] Wherein was written, it is reported
[1:26:58] among the heathen, and Gashu said it,
[1:27:02] saith it, that thou and the Jews think
[1:27:07] to rebel, for which cause thou buildest
[1:27:11] the wall, that thou mayest be their
[1:27:14] king,
[1:27:16] according to these words.
[1:27:19] And thou hast also appointed prophets
[1:27:23] to preach of thee
[1:27:27] at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in
[1:27:30] Judah, and now shall it be reported to
[1:27:34] the king or taxis
[1:27:38] according to these words. Come now,
[1:27:41] therefore, and let us take counsel
[1:27:44] together. What are we reading? We're
[1:27:48] reading the accusations that are being
[1:27:50] leveled against Nehemiah
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; who has no desire to be king. There is a
[1:27:57] king in Persia. We don't need a king in
[1:28:00] Judah. He has no desire to replace
[1:28:04] anybody else. He has no ambition except
[1:28:08] his heart has become broken for the
[1:28:12] destruction of the city of the Lord, the
[1:28:14] city of the king, the city of the most
[1:28:17] high God, Jerusalem.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And so he is uh overwhelmed. He is
[1:28:24] consumed by a vision. He is consumed by
[1:28:28] a commission. He is consumed by a burden
[1:28:34] that he would do something to see the
[1:28:38] broken walls of Jerusalem built again.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; If he could see the gates of the city
[1:28:47] repaired and restored. Listen, he was
[1:28:51] not about destruction.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; He the bride is not about destruction.
[1:28:58] Our ministry is not about destruction.
[1:29:02] The bride's ministry is about building.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; We're building something. Not the
[1:29:08] kingdom of William Brham.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Not the kingdom of men.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But the kingdom of our God,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:29:20] There is a time to men. Rend rend. There
[1:29:24] is a time to tear down. There is a time
[1:29:27] to destroy, but we're not in the
[1:29:29] destroying time now. We're in the
[1:29:32] building up hour.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes things have to be ripped all
[1:29:37] the way down to the foundation so that
[1:29:40] you can check to see that you're
[1:29:42] building on a foundation that will take
[1:29:45] you all the way through.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; But our commission is to build.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; We're building in the spirit. We're
[1:29:54] building an atmosphere where he can come
[1:29:57] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:30:00] and forever.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what I'm saying?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Are you sure you do?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; We are called and commissioned to carry
[1:30:09] a burden and to have a common vision
[1:30:13] among us for for a church, for a
[1:30:16] ministry to operate with more than one
[1:30:19] vision. the vision that is presented
[1:30:22] from this holy desk
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; and to have another vision presented
[1:30:28] from the volleyball court or from the
[1:30:31] fellowship hall
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; or from your home
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; that is die vision
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; di
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; vision and what happens when there's
[1:30:45] division
[1:30:46] people die
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; where there is no vision singularly
[1:30:53] vision. Where there is no vision, King
[1:30:56] James translated the verse to say where
[1:31:01] there is no vision, the people
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; perish.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Perish.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I wish he would have taken a closer look
[1:31:09] at the word
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; because that word doesn't only mean
[1:31:13] perish. It means before they perish,
[1:31:17] they cast off restraint.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; No standards,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; no boundaries.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; No convictions.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to preach it.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Just every man does that which is right
[1:31:38] in his own eyes,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; and every man gets to choose for his own
[1:31:42] house. And it doesn't matter what they
[1:31:45] do over at the church. It doesn't matter
[1:31:47] what they believe at the church. It
[1:31:49] doesn't matter what they've given their
[1:31:50] lives to over there. I I get to make the
[1:31:53] decisions in my home. And so we will
[1:31:56] live contrary.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; We'll live a different way.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It sounds to me like a compromise
[1:32:04] of high level.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Because where there is no vision,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; the people perish. and they perish
[1:32:12] because they've cast off restraint.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; They have no no concept of what it means
[1:32:22] to be led,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; to be shepherded,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; To be guided, to be cared for. I don't
[1:32:30] know how many people have told me over
[1:32:33] the last 50 years, I want you to be my
[1:32:36] pastor. And I I I want you to tell me if
[1:32:41] you see anything, if you hear anything,
[1:32:44] if you feel anything, if you think
[1:32:47] anything,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to share that with me because
[1:32:50] I want to make it a matter of prayer and
[1:32:54] concern. And the problem is tens of
[1:32:57] thousands have asked for my help and
[1:33:00] only a half a dozen have ever come back
[1:33:02] and dismissed me.
[1:33:05] So I'm still spiritually employed
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; by thousands of people who've called me
[1:33:12] to be a pastor, a leader in their life
[1:33:15] and they got mad or they ran here or
[1:33:17] they ran there and they never fired me.
[1:33:22] Did you know brother Random talks about
[1:33:25] Jezebel?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Even Queen Jezebel had a pastor.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; His name was Elijah the prophet.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Why was he considered to be uh Jezebel's
[1:33:38] pastor? Because he had the spiritual
[1:33:40] authority for the season over the house
[1:33:43] of Israel.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I tell you folk, it it was a
[1:33:48] better day in Israel when she listened
[1:33:51] to the judges, to the seers, and to the
[1:33:55] prophets.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; But she began to to look around and see
[1:33:59] the prosperity of the other nations and
[1:34:02] the way they did things.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Just like people around this message
[1:34:08] began to look around, well, all the
[1:34:10] other churches have Christmas. Well, all
[1:34:13] the other churches have cable
[1:34:15] television. Well, all the other churches
[1:34:17] have so and so. All the other churches
[1:34:20] have banquetss and all the other
[1:34:21] churches have fall festivals. And all
[1:34:24] the other churches and we ought to we
[1:34:27] ought not to be any less than any of the
[1:34:29] rest of them. Just a minute. Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And so we'd like to be like them.
[1:34:42] The problem is there's still a few
[1:34:44] old-timers left that remember when it
[1:34:47] wasn't that way.
[1:34:49] And we long to have a word of God among
[1:34:53] us again. A word of deliverance, a word
[1:34:56] of correction, a word of a clarion call,
[1:35:00] a trumpet blast as the prophet Joel set
[1:35:05] the trumpet to thy mouth and sound an
[1:35:08] alarm and make it a clear alarm. Do it
[1:35:12] without fear or favor of man. tell the
[1:35:15] truth because only the truth will set
[1:35:18] people free.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And so they congregate around a a
[1:35:25] handful of of top preachers
[1:35:32] and they know what they're going to get
[1:35:36] before they go.
[1:35:38] They know the theme. They know what's
[1:35:40] going to be preached. They know the
[1:35:42] testimonies that are going to be told.
[1:35:45] They know exactly how things are going
[1:35:47] to go. The rest of the time, the people
[1:35:50] are just reaching. Many, many are. You
[1:35:53] don't have to say amen. You may not even
[1:35:55] be qualified to say amen, but I'm
[1:35:57] qualified to say this.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; They're just reaching. Let us be like
[1:36:02] other nations. Let us be like other
[1:36:04] nations. We want to be like other
[1:36:06] churches.
[1:36:08] Well, other churches do it that. Well,
[1:36:09] in other churches, the pastor goes and
[1:36:12] visits everybody in their home at least
[1:36:14] once a month. And in other churches,
[1:36:17] they do it like this. And in other,
[1:36:21] you know, Israel made a fatal mistake.
[1:36:26] I said to my children this week, I know
[1:36:30] they're grown, but they're they'll
[1:36:33] always be our children if they're if
[1:36:35] they're 50 years old, which we in this
[1:36:38] life would probably never see, but
[1:36:41] they're still our children. I don't mean
[1:36:43] little toddler children. I mean they're
[1:36:44] they're our offspring. You're a child of
[1:36:47] God, aren't you?
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; You're an offspring of God. Isn't that
[1:36:50] what the prophet tells us? We're his
[1:36:52] offspring.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; And I believe it. I told my children
[1:36:56] this week uh concerning this story uh of
[1:37:01] how Israel wanted a king
[1:37:05] and they just had to have a king and so
[1:37:08] God gave them what they wanted,
[1:37:11] but he wasn't a long-term righteous man.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; He was only righteous till he caught his
[1:37:18] glimpse of himself in the mirror and
[1:37:20] then he fell in love with who he had
[1:37:22] become. And instead of raising up
[1:37:25] memorials and monuments unto God, he
[1:37:27] began to raise up memorial and memorials
[1:37:30] and monuments unto himself, unto his
[1:37:33] family, unto the dynasty of Saul.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And God began to be left out. And I said
[1:37:40] to my kids, I I I encourage you, at
[1:37:44] least the girls, I I said, I encourage
[1:37:47] you, and now I'll say it to the other to
[1:37:49] the two boys. I encourage you to listen
[1:37:52] to the sermon that brother Brandham
[1:37:54] preached in Ciagua, Ohio. Charity, I
[1:37:58] don't have the year, but you might look
[1:37:59] it up or someone can hollered out, but I
[1:38:02] don't need 30 people on their phone
[1:38:04] looking it up. I need your attention
[1:38:06] here. Uh, Ohio. He preached a message,
[1:38:10] the rejected king. And I've been to the
[1:38:13] campground in Shiagua. Brother Leadford
[1:38:17] uh from Middletown, Ohio took us out
[1:38:19] there to the campground and showed us
[1:38:22] the meeting and he was in the meeting
[1:38:23] and told us where everything was and we
[1:38:26] enjoyed the nostalgia of that moment. If
[1:38:29] you've never heard that sermon or if you
[1:38:31] haven't heard it in a long time, it's
[1:38:33] the story from God's perspective.
[1:38:36] There's the year 1960
[1:38:38] and that is June the 10th of 1960.
[1:38:42] Chatagua. It's got ch and a q in it.
[1:38:48] The rejected king. Hear it because it's
[1:38:51] the story from God's perspective. We
[1:38:54] hear it in the Bible uh concerning Saul
[1:38:56] and how he he moved and was dealt with.
[1:39:00] And we hear it later as David and Saul
[1:39:03] interact with one another. And then as
[1:39:06] David becomes anointed king uh over over
[1:39:10] a kingdom that already has a king first
[1:39:13] time and then uh uh subsequently
[1:39:16] anointed by the divided kingdoms of
[1:39:18] Israel and then the United Kingdom. But
[1:39:22] brother Brandham preached it from God's
[1:39:23] perspective. How do you think it made
[1:39:26] the creator feel?
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; When the people said, "We no longer want
[1:39:31] your leadership.
[1:39:34] We want a king.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Did you know they already had a king?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; The king of kings.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; They already had a melaholam.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Why did they think they needed an
[1:39:47] earthly king? They only thought it
[1:39:50] because they were comparing themselves
[1:39:53] with other nations.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; When we compare ourselves, our family
[1:39:59] with somebody else's family, we lose.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] When we compare our blessing with
[1:40:04] someone else's blessing, we lose.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; When we compare our provision with some,
[1:40:10] we lose.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; This is not about a competition.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; This is serving God
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; with all we have
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; and he gives us. I've always believed
[1:40:25] this when I had nothing. I still
[1:40:28] believed it that God gives us only what
[1:40:32] he can trust us with.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You want more in your life
[1:40:38] provisionwise,
[1:40:40] become more trustworthy in your
[1:40:42] dealings.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; It's what you do with what you have
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; that causes God to see whether or not
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; you are trustworthy
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; enough to have something else. Am I off
[1:40:56] the word? I don't believe so.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Because he said to Israel, you're
[1:41:00] wondering why things are going hard for
[1:41:01] you. I'll tell you, you're thieves.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; You've robbed God.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's why you're having such
[1:41:09] a hard time. You're robbing God. You're
[1:41:11] under a curse."
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; He watches to see what we will do with
[1:41:16] what we have. Not only our money, but
[1:41:19] our families.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I want you to know that's one
[1:41:22] of the most valuable things that we have
[1:41:26] leadership and influence over is our own
[1:41:29] family. If we can't listen folk, if we
[1:41:32] can't make a difference in our own
[1:41:34] family, oh God, help us,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; help us, Lord. We don't want to win the
[1:41:41] world and lose our own family.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Then we better apply
[1:41:53] I'll tell you, pride will keep you from
[1:41:54] going back to your children, sir.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; And apologizing for your wicked ways,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; but that's not that's not important.
[1:42:04] It's okay to eat uh humble pie. It's all
[1:42:09] right to eat crow. It's all right to
[1:42:12] come back and say, "I was wrong. I was
[1:42:14] I'm sorry that I did it that way. That's
[1:42:16] not the way I should have done it." And
[1:42:18] I want to tell you, I'm sorry. Now,
[1:42:20] let's get together and do it differently
[1:42:21] and better the next time. Some of you
[1:42:25] need that kind of a meeting.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Some of us need that kind of meeting
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; where we say to our family, "Oh, give us
[1:42:35] another chance. We we we no longer maybe
[1:42:39] have the authority that we once had, but
[1:42:41] give us another opportunity to set a
[1:42:44] better example before you instead of
[1:42:46] undermining you spiritually.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Instead of telling other people what a a
[1:42:53] condition our our children are in
[1:42:56] spiritually a as though we're kind of
[1:42:59] telling on them or something. God have
[1:43:02] mercy on us if that's where we get our
[1:43:05] pleasure.
[1:43:06] Don't we realize that we bear a portion
[1:43:09] of the responsibility for the wake that
[1:43:12] the boat our boat of life leaves behind
[1:43:15] it?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; God help us in this hour.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; They said we got to have a king. We want
[1:43:20] to look like other nations. We want to
[1:43:22] be like other nations. God gave him a
[1:43:25] Saul. God took the kingdom back from
[1:43:27] Saul. Oh, but Saul didn't give up easy,
[1:43:31] did he?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; What a mess.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a mess it was. How long it
[1:43:39] took, how much bloodshed it took to
[1:43:42] finally get the hands in the kingdom in
[1:43:45] the hands of a man who would have an
[1:43:48] eternal dynasty.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of Saul came and went.
[1:43:55] The kingdom of David came and is an
[1:43:58] eternal dynasty
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; because the King of Kings descended
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; and he shall sit upon an everlasting
[1:44:07] throne, the throne of David. Here's
[1:44:09] Nehemiah. He knew the promises of God
[1:44:13] concerning Jerusalem.
[1:44:15] And uh I I I just I know you maybe were
[1:44:19] distracted by for a few moments on the
[1:44:22] platform. I had my laptop going, but I I
[1:44:25] wanted to pull just a few notes that I
[1:44:27] hadn't pulled previously from the
[1:44:30] introductory sermon that I preached 21
[1:44:34] years ago, fall 21 years ago in this
[1:44:37] church. And and and just to get a few
[1:44:40] details here that I didn't have. and one
[1:44:42] I spoke about Ezra being sent first and
[1:44:45] then approximately it was 11 years later
[1:44:49] Ezra leaves the captivity uh the
[1:44:52] Babylonian captivity that has taken the
[1:44:54] Jews to Persia and he tries to go back
[1:44:58] and but it it just is not happening and
[1:45:00] so 13 years later excuse me 11 years
[1:45:04] somewhere between 11 and 13 years later
[1:45:07] Nehemiah is in the in the palace of the
[1:45:11] king of Persia
[1:45:13] and in this royal lily city
[1:45:18] what's the name Shuan
[1:45:22] it's the same city of Mori
[1:45:25] and Padasa that we in English call
[1:45:30] Esther same city and the the Jews are
[1:45:35] still in captivity
[1:45:38] 130 years have gone by since the
[1:45:42] destruction of Jerusalem by
[1:45:44] Nebuchadnezzar a and the Babylonian
[1:45:47] army. The temple was brought down uh
[1:45:51] until there was hardly one stone upon
[1:45:54] another stone. The city of Jerusalem was
[1:45:58] not only destroyed, the walls broken
[1:46:01] down, the gates burned up, but even what
[1:46:04] was left of the city that wasn't stone
[1:46:06] was burned. And if you would have looked
[1:46:08] at the at the stones of the wall, you
[1:46:11] would have seen them burned. And I have
[1:46:13] seen with my own eyes some of the stones
[1:46:17] that remain today from the burning of
[1:46:20] the city of Jerusalem in this period and
[1:46:23] not in the period of Titus. And there
[1:46:25] and they're still charred. You you can
[1:46:28] still see the remnant of the staining of
[1:46:32] the stones where the fire would only
[1:46:35] burn something off the surface of the
[1:46:37] stone, but of course not the stone
[1:46:39] itself. The people of Israel had settled
[1:46:43] in to Persia and they had picked up
[1:46:46] Babylonian ways. They were comfortable
[1:46:50] in this land of exile and in this land
[1:46:54] of confusion
[1:46:56] because the word Babel means confusion,
[1:46:59] confusing language, confusing speech.
[1:47:04] and they had settled in and only little
[1:47:07] handfuls of people had followed the
[1:47:10] example of Ezra and had made that
[1:47:14] journey back when they were captured out
[1:47:18] of Jerusalem. There were no airplanes to
[1:47:22] get them from Jerusalem to Shushan in
[1:47:25] Persia. They marched in chains, chained
[1:47:29] one to another, prisoners of exile. They
[1:47:34] get to uh to Babylon and they are
[1:47:38] eventually given some some I don't
[1:47:42] freedom we could say. Uh as long as you
[1:47:45] serve the kingdom empire you you won't
[1:47:48] be exactly slaves. You won't be exactly
[1:47:54] free. Hear me.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You won't be exactly free, but you won't
[1:48:01] be exactly slaves either.
[1:48:03] So you won't just go and come as you
[1:48:05] will. But a little freedom
[1:48:09] is better than no freedom.
[1:48:11] Do you know what that sounds like to me
[1:48:13] today? The condition
[1:48:16] of many places.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; May God help it not to be the condition
[1:48:20] of this place
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; got just enough freedom
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; to to to to make you comfortable
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; to cause you to want to stay in
[1:48:31] confusion.
[1:48:32] but not enough longing.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Not enough longing in your heart for
[1:48:39] Jerusalem.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; So, you'll just live in Persia with your
[1:48:45] Babylonian ways. And you will you will
[1:48:48] uh Oh, it's nice to hear stories from
[1:48:50] home.
[1:48:52] I hear the Jews are there. I hear they
[1:48:55] hide during the day.
[1:48:58] I hear they're afraid because they're
[1:49:01] still occupying forces of of several
[1:49:03] different dynasties that roam the ruins
[1:49:06] of Jerusalem. And so the Jews are mostly
[1:49:09] in and out hiding.
[1:49:12] But oh, at least at least some of our
[1:49:14] brothers are in the city and they go on
[1:49:16] living their life, spending their
[1:49:18] paycheck, enjoying their freedom, which
[1:49:22] is really slavery in disguise. That's
[1:49:24] right. That's right.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; They've been made twofold children of
[1:49:27] hell,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; just enough freedom to keep them from
[1:49:30] doing all the things they did in sin,
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; but not enough freedom to give them
[1:49:35] victory over those vices and those uh
[1:49:38] little pet sins and little foxes, and
[1:49:41] not enough victory to cause them to
[1:49:43] speak with integrity and truth all the
[1:49:46] time.
[1:49:48] In fact, they've learned to to uh you
[1:49:50] know color things and to shade things in
[1:49:54] such a way
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; that it's really not an entire lie,
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; but it's not really truth either.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's too many folks
[1:50:09] in this church
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; that live under that kind of a banner.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest. I'm doing my job.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I'm doing what I'm called to do, and
[1:50:21] that is show the house to the house. If
[1:50:23] I don't do that, I'm just here for a
[1:50:25] meal ticket,
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; and you can't afford my taste.
[1:50:34] I'm not here for a meal ticket. I have
[1:50:36] to sleep. I love the privilege of of
[1:50:40] laying in the bed beside my wife, but
[1:50:41] I'll tell you who I'm really worried
[1:50:44] about. I have to sleep with me.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; I have to know when I go to bed at night
[1:50:51] that I have delivered my all,
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; that I've done my job.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; If I ever come to this pull pit
[1:50:58] unprepared, God help me. I'm slipping.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody better help me out.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Overprepared maybe, but never I don't
[1:51:07] want to ever be underprepared. And I
[1:51:09] don't ever want to be so committed to a
[1:51:11] set of notes that I can't follow the
[1:51:13] leadership of the Holy Spirit. If that's
[1:51:15] the case, then we become just like the
[1:51:17] rest.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; There's a vision over this house.
[1:51:21] There's a mandate over this house.
[1:51:23] There's a reason why we're gathered the
[1:51:25] way we are.
[1:51:29] Somebody said, "Oh, you just think."
[1:51:31] Listen, I think every pastor who who
[1:51:33] believes he's doing God's will ought to
[1:51:36] ought to be believe somehow that there
[1:51:38] is something that that body of believers
[1:51:41] is supposed to do.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; That may not be like every other church
[1:51:46] in the neighborhood.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; If every church does it just the same,
[1:51:50] that all we've got is the World Council
[1:51:52] of Churches. Come on.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; I didn't even want a church.
[1:51:59] I wasn't looking for a church. This is
[1:52:02] to be a place of revival.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; It's to be a revival ministry. It's to
[1:52:08] be a revival center. It's supposed to be
[1:52:11] a house of deliverance.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; And if you're waiting on somebody to
[1:52:17] bring deliverance to you, I don't
[1:52:20] understand that mentality.
[1:52:23] Because when I realize that I need
[1:52:25] freedom, I've somehow brought myself
[1:52:29] back under some bondage that I that I
[1:52:32] escaped from. I run to God
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; and I say, "Papa, please have mercy on
[1:52:40] me. I've lost the freedom that I once
[1:52:43] had
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; to pray through at all hours of the day
[1:52:47] and night.
[1:52:51] We need prayer list.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; We are we are an ADHD generation.
[1:52:58] We cannot remember. We go into a room at
[1:53:01] 30,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; at 25
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; and can't remember why we came in.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; That's the curse that the world has
[1:53:11] placed on this generation. And you carry
[1:53:14] the instrument of such
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; condition in your pocket
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; and I carry it in mine.
[1:53:22] It's a fact. It's brain science.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Your attention span. Listen, you can't
[1:53:29] even hardly answer a question that
[1:53:31] someone askked of you.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Don't ask me a question if you don't
[1:53:37] want to hear an answer.
[1:53:39] But how many of you realize that people
[1:53:41] will ask you a question and before you
[1:53:44] have answered their question, they're
[1:53:47] they're already looking on.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; It's quiet in here.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth. And some don't
[1:53:59] even hide it. Some will ask you a
[1:54:01] question while they're checking their
[1:54:02] email.
[1:54:05] This is a curse, not a blessing.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I believe that I am preaching the truth
[1:54:14] this morning. I believe that I am
[1:54:16] telling it right like it is this
[1:54:18] morning. I believe
[1:54:21] that there are very few people in this
[1:54:24] body who spend any time
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; in the scripture
[1:54:32] unless you count that little text that
[1:54:34] you get every day from your Bible app
[1:54:36] that you don't read.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I may have a half a dozen people send it
[1:54:45] to me. I read it and then my mind
[1:54:48] wonders.
[1:54:50] I wonder if anybody that sent it to me
[1:54:52] read it because you don't get extra
[1:54:55] brownie points. That's right
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; for sending me a scripture of the day
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; if you don't take time to read it for
[1:55:02] yourself.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; That's all right. I'll help myself
[1:55:04] preach.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; I want this to be ser Well, it was
[1:55:08] mighty serious last Sunday. Yeah. And a
[1:55:09] few people showed up Tuesday night
[1:55:11] anyway.
[1:55:12] Let's see if it'll happen again.
[1:55:14] Somebody said, "We had a nice crowd on
[1:55:16] Tuesday night." And I said, "Yes, much
[1:55:17] better than I expected after I had
[1:55:19] preached so hard on Sunday." It's not
[1:55:20] what I want to do. I look forward to the
[1:55:23] day that I don't have to.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Let that begin now. Is all right with
[1:55:27] me. But I am under an obligation. Yes,
[1:55:32] sir. Yes, sir.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; To try at least to awaken you
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; to the reality of the precious promises
[1:55:40] that have been made for this generation
[1:55:42] and for this last hour bride.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not about money,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; how much we can make, sir,
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; how far ahead in life we can get,
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to know there was a rich man
[1:55:54] in the Bible who filled up all his
[1:55:57] barns, built bigger barns.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And a and while he was still in the
[1:56:03] process of building his empire,
[1:56:07] today you fool,
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; just just today you fool, your your life
[1:56:12] is going to be required of you.
[1:56:14] While you're here just still trying to
[1:56:16] save it up and build it up, your life is
[1:56:18] going to be required of you. And in
[1:56:20] hell, he lifted up his eyes being in
[1:56:23] torment.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; He got so desperate that he said, "Well,
[1:56:27] you just send some of my brothers here,
[1:56:30] somebody to dip their finger in a cool
[1:56:32] water and touch into my tongue, for I'm
[1:56:34] tormented in these flames. I'm tormented
[1:56:36] in this condition." Father Abraham spoke
[1:56:38] to him in this story that Jesus is
[1:56:40] telling and said, "It's not permitted.
[1:56:44] No one can come across that divide.
[1:56:46] There's a divide there and it can't be
[1:56:48] crossed. Then would you send my brothers
[1:56:51] back to the earth that they could preach
[1:56:54] to others?" And he said, "That would be
[1:56:56] great. But if they won't believe the
[1:56:58] prophets, those that are sent to them
[1:57:00] now,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; do you think they would dare believe
[1:57:02] those who have raised from the dead to
[1:57:04] try to tell them the truth?"
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the hour we're in. Amen.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, that's the hour we're
[1:57:09] in. Somebody ought to help me. That's
[1:57:11] the hour we're in right now.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; These nuts who are waiting on brother
[1:57:17] Brandham to fly in an airplane and pitch
[1:57:19] a tent and have a great tent revival and
[1:57:21] raise up brother Hicks and brother so
[1:57:23] and so and brother so and so so they can
[1:57:25] be tent men. All of this nonsense of the
[1:57:28] Mosley's and all this stuff that has
[1:57:30] surrounded and cluttered the message of
[1:57:32] the hour,
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:35] They wouldn't believe Brother Brandham.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't believe him if he walked
[1:57:39] in because the first thing he'd do is
[1:57:41] tell them how far they have fallen
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; from what he gave them in the beginning.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; That's where we are. Maybe your old
[1:57:51] pastor that you love so much and had so
[1:57:53] respect so much respect in who's gone on
[1:57:55] to be with the Lord. If he raised from
[1:57:57] the dead tonight, walked down the aisle,
[1:57:58] and told you what to do about your life,
[1:58:01] you'd scratch your head, take another
[1:58:03] pill, and wonder if it was real.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't believe him if they raised
[1:58:09] from the dead to tell us.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; It's what Jesus said, red letter.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; We have a commission. We have a vision.
[1:58:18] We have an hour. We have only so much
[1:58:20] time. I wished I knew exactly how many
[1:58:23] days. I wished I knew exactly how many
[1:58:26] years.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And we come to God's house waited down
[1:58:33] with our little
[1:58:44] so weighted down we can't hear the
[1:58:45] preacher. So weighted down we can't
[1:58:47] raise our hands. so weighted down that
[1:58:49] our testimony is. I wanted to praise the
[1:58:51] Lord, but all I could see was so and so
[1:58:53] praising the Lord,
[1:58:57] face the back,
[1:58:59] turn to the wall,
[1:59:01] do whatever. Blindfold yourself
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; for crying out loud. Sister Megan, come
[1:59:06] in here with a mouth mask on many, many
[1:59:09] times. You You can put you some
[1:59:12] blindfolds on.
[1:59:16] I mean it. Have I lost my mind?
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Ah, maybe
[1:59:22] whatever we will what we have to do is
[1:59:25] biblical
[1:59:27] you put blinders on the horses.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe we need a little more Amish
[1:59:33] mentality. Not really. Not really. Not
[1:59:36] if you don't know what they believe.
[1:59:39] But maybe we need a little more of that
[1:59:40] mentality to put us some blinders on so
[1:59:43] that we'll be less likely to be
[1:59:44] distracted by somebody else. Let me tell
[1:59:46] you something. Fall in love with Jesus.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Get so full of the Holy Ghost. Love him.
[1:59:54] Catch a half a glimpse of who he is now.
[1:59:57] Right now. Right now. Right now. He is
[2:00:01] Jesus Christ. The same. Yes. Right now.
[2:00:06] He's alive. And well, he's wooing his
[2:00:10] church. He's calling
[2:00:15] and somebody's worried
[2:00:18] about somebody else's. Amen.
[2:00:25] Where's yours?
[2:00:28] Where's your praise?
[2:00:31] Where's your God bless you? Where's your
[2:00:34] I'm praying for you, pastor.
[2:00:40] Where's I'm praying for your family. I'm
[2:00:42] praying for the leadership. I'm praying
[2:00:44] for this house. Where's that?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; You so quickly will sit around and carry
[2:00:51] out, talk about, pick out, point out the
[2:00:54] flaws of this house, the flaws of
[2:00:57] somebody else's children, the flaws of
[2:00:59] somebody else's family.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Where's your prayer commitment? Where's
[2:01:04] your prayer burden? Where is your prayer
[2:01:06] list?
[2:01:11] We don't even pay enough attention to
[2:01:13] the prayer requests that if we're called
[2:01:15] on to pray that we can get up here and
[2:01:17] even remember.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I don't even try. I just bundle them up
[2:01:22] before the Lord. They don't have to be
[2:01:24] called out. Somebody said, "Well, it
[2:01:25] sure makes people feel good if you call
[2:01:27] them out individually." Why should we
[2:01:29] worry and take the time to call them out
[2:01:33] individually so somebody else feels good
[2:01:36] about their prayer request when they're
[2:01:39] probably not committing five minutes
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; to pray for their own burden?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; That's the hour that's not against you.
[2:01:51] That's the hour that we're living in.
[2:01:55] It's everybody else's responsibility to
[2:01:57] pray it through. It's everybody else's
[2:02:00] responsibility to bear the burden.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Let somebody else pick up the trash.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; We have so little regard
[2:02:14] and I'm talking about the generation of
[2:02:16] church an annity. But of course we
[2:02:19] cannot exclude ourselves. We have so
[2:02:22] much in this hour uh of of some kind of
[2:02:24] privilege or something that we can break
[2:02:27] or destroy or damage something that
[2:02:29] belongs to someone else perhaps even in
[2:02:32] the church and never even tell anybody
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; who can do anything about it.
[2:02:40] So afraid that we're going to be asked
[2:02:43] maybe to contribute or
[2:02:47] to pay for what we broke. will just
[2:02:49] break it.
[2:02:52] Do you need a list
[2:02:57] and never mention to someone? And then
[2:03:00] if we say something to them about uh you
[2:03:03] know making sure that when you're up
[2:03:05] here on this platform that you're that
[2:03:06] you're careful with this equipment
[2:03:08] because
[2:03:10] it was costly.
[2:03:13] And everybody grabbing a microphone. Do
[2:03:15] you know what you're holding in your
[2:03:16] hand? That's not a $30 microphone.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; And there was money by the grace of God
[2:03:24] to buy it. I don't know if there'll be
[2:03:27] to replace it.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; But people don't. Nothing is holy or
[2:03:33] sacred in this generation. We cannot be
[2:03:35] like the the the world around us. We've
[2:03:37] got to be a little different. Let me
[2:03:39] tell you something. Uh even the prophet
[2:03:41] of the of the past generation talked to
[2:03:44] us spoke to us about the sacredness of
[2:03:46] this desk
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; and and this place up here.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; A and he said you know it seemed my
[2:03:54] people would want to get as close to
[2:03:56] where the fire comes down and touches
[2:03:59] the angel.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; When said they want to see how close to
[2:04:04] the back door they can get.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Some don't even make you past the couch.
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:13] because we have come to a place in this
[2:04:16] late hour that that
[2:04:21] nothing nothing's very sacred.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, Nehemiah,
[2:04:27] he came to a position of great trust.
[2:04:30] He certainly was
[2:04:33] grateful for the trust that the king
[2:04:37] showed in him.
[2:04:40] He was the cup bearer.
[2:04:43] He took his position in Persia toward
[2:04:47] the king as a privilege. And that's why
[2:04:50] he was chosen for the job. How many of
[2:04:53] you remember what his job was? He was a
[2:04:56] cup bearer. Perhaps you think that means
[2:04:59] that he would run and fetch the dinner
[2:05:02] wear,
[2:05:04] the crystal or the glassear for the
[2:05:06] table. No, that's not what the cup
[2:05:10] bearer did. The cup bearer guarded the
[2:05:14] chalice.
[2:05:17] The cup bearer guarded the chalice of
[2:05:21] the king.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; He was over the king's wine. He was over
[2:05:26] the king's goblets, we'll say.
[2:05:30] And if a bottle of wine from the royal
[2:05:34] house was opened,
[2:05:38] the king, sorry I'm screaming, I guess
[2:05:41] I'm losing my voice. The king didn't get
[2:05:44] the first sip
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; because somebody might have poisoned
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; the wine and the king would die and the
[2:05:53] kingdom crumbled.
[2:05:55] So a cup bearer,
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; oh listen folks, he so
[2:06:04] loved and cherished the responsibility
[2:06:07] that had been placed in him in service
[2:06:10] of the king that he was willing
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; to risk his own life.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Many say it
[2:06:24] Many say it. It's easy to say,
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; "But he was willing to take the cup, to
[2:06:34] take a big sip." And don't you think the
[2:06:37] king grabbed it and took the next sip
[2:06:39] right away? Oh, no. He had to give that
[2:06:41] stuff time to percolate.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; I got to make sure that this is not some
[2:06:47] long effect, long lasting. May maybe
[2:06:49] it'll hit him in 24 hours. Let's just
[2:06:51] put that bottle away. I'm not quite
[2:06:53] ready to drink that one yet. Let me see
[2:06:55] if he lives. Can you imagine being the
[2:06:57] dummy? Because that's how how it would
[2:07:00] almost feel. But but Nehemiah, oh no,
[2:07:02] Nehemiah didn't feel like a flunky.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Nehemiah was trusted. Let me tell you
[2:07:07] something. In order to be the king's cup
[2:07:09] bearer, he had to be trusted.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; That he wouldn't let anything slip by
[2:07:16] him.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; And he didn't just say, "I'm committed."
[2:07:21] He was committed because he would take
[2:07:25] it first. And if he didn't die, then the
[2:07:28] king would be served the wine. We can't
[2:07:30] afford for the leader of the kingdom to
[2:07:33] fall dead because someone has tried to
[2:07:35] take his life with a little bit of wine.
[2:07:38] But something happened to Nehemiah. He's
[2:07:40] just as happy as a as he can be serving
[2:07:42] the king,
[2:07:44] cleaning the cup, taking the first sip.
[2:07:48] loyal, loyal, loyal little fellow he
[2:07:50] was. until one day a merchant came to
[2:07:54] Shushan and began to describe to him the
[2:07:58] horror
[2:08:00] of the condition of the city that God
[2:08:04] had called an eternal city, a bridal
[2:08:08] city, a royal city, the city of David,
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; the city of the great king,
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Yerushim,
[2:08:20] Jerusalem, the golden.
[2:08:23] He said, "It's terrible.
[2:08:26] You wouldn't believe it."
[2:08:30] He said, "I've seen with my own eyes."
[2:08:34] Nehemiah's hearing this. I've seen with
[2:08:37] my own eyes the devastation of the great
[2:08:40] temple in Jerusalem.
[2:08:43] I've seen the ruin of the walls of the
[2:08:47] city and the gates broken from the
[2:08:50] hinges and the wood of the gates burned
[2:08:53] in the streets of the city. It's been
[2:08:55] over 130 years and nobody has even
[2:09:00] gotten to the place that they've removed
[2:09:02] all the ashes
[2:09:04] where the gates of the city were burned
[2:09:06] in their place.
[2:09:08] And Nehemiah begins to hear this story
[2:09:11] and his heart, he doesn't know what's
[2:09:13] wrong with him, but his heart begins to
[2:09:16] yearn and break and cry for what was,
[2:09:23] for the glory that was, for the beauty
[2:09:26] that was before the city had been
[2:09:30] defiled.
[2:09:31] He couldn't stand the thought that the
[2:09:34] city was broken down and that heathens
[2:09:38] climbed over the walls, climbed over the
[2:09:41] rocks, the boulders
[2:09:44] that once made the strong walls,
[2:09:49] garrisons, and bullwarks
[2:09:51] of the city.
[2:09:54] I've walked the bullwarks
[2:09:57] of Jerusalem myself. The walls of the
[2:10:00] city now restored.
[2:10:03] In places, you're walking on the actual
[2:10:06] stone that was original to the wall. And
[2:10:09] in other places where there is no longer
[2:10:12] a walk from stone, there is steel and
[2:10:16] metal
[2:10:18] walkways that have been added to the
[2:10:20] inside of the walls of Jerusalem. And
[2:10:22] you can literally almost walk all the
[2:10:24] way around. There's a couple places
[2:10:26] where you have to come down, but you can
[2:10:28] almost walk around the the whole entire
[2:10:32] city. You stand up in that beautiful
[2:10:34] place and look over and see Golgata and
[2:10:37] you see where the Garden Tomb is. You
[2:10:40] can see if you're interested in seeing
[2:10:41] the Rockefeller
[2:10:43] Museum is there and and and you see all
[2:10:47] the beautiful places of the valley
[2:10:49] Henome and and go around to the to the
[2:10:52] Mount of Olives and you see all the
[2:10:54] graves of the righteous Zedox that have
[2:10:57] died in the faith of the God of Israel.
[2:11:01] You can look over to the cemetery in in
[2:11:04] Zion just below Mount Zion and know that
[2:11:07] uh that Oscar Schindler is buried there
[2:11:12] saving so many Jews. This everywhere you
[2:11:16] look is history
[2:11:18] and beauty.
[2:11:21] And it's a wonderful thing that it's
[2:11:23] restored.
[2:11:24] But it is restored today because of
[2:11:27] vision and burden and passion and and
[2:11:30] vision of somebody like a Nehemiah who
[2:11:35] said, "I like my job,
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; but my heart is breaking. I find myself
[2:11:43] groaning
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; for the condition of the holy city.
[2:11:50] I've got to go. I've got to do
[2:11:52] something. I I I can't let it go on like
[2:11:55] this. He was one of the most selfish
[2:11:58] servants in the kingdom.
[2:12:01] He risked his life every day for the
[2:12:05] king of Persia.
[2:12:08] He was chosen not only by the king but
[2:12:11] by God to put his life on the line. He
[2:12:15] served the king with no reservation. He
[2:12:17] served the king not holding anything
[2:12:19] back. He was totally completely loyal to
[2:12:22] the king to the extent that he was
[2:12:24] willing to drink the wine first to see
[2:12:26] whether or not it was poison. But when
[2:12:28] he heard of the devastation of the city
[2:12:31] of Jerusalem, it broke him like he had
[2:12:33] never been broken in his life because he
[2:12:36] knew that there were promises
[2:12:38] that were attached to those stones.
[2:12:45] Don't take a pregnant woman to look at
[2:12:48] those stones
[2:12:53] because I did
[2:12:56] and it doesn't have the same effect.
[2:13:01] Don't take a pregnant woman to the tomb
[2:13:04] of Samson
[2:13:08] because you're going to jostle her
[2:13:10] around getting her there.
[2:13:14] And if she's pregnant, she's got bigger
[2:13:16] things on her mind and she's not as
[2:13:19] interested as you are.
[2:13:22] She doesn't jump out of the van at every
[2:13:24] stop. Sometimes Sister Nancy wouldn't
[2:13:27] even stop the van. She'd just slow it
[2:13:29] down. I'd jump out, run ahead of
[2:13:32] everybody else. Let me touch the stones.
[2:13:36] Let me let me sit where uh sages have
[2:13:39] sat. Let me lay down where prophets have
[2:13:42] laid down. Let let me walk these
[2:13:45] cobblestones
[2:13:47] that my Lord walked up coming out of
[2:13:50] Golgatha, the garden of Gethsemane on
[2:13:53] the way up.
[2:13:55] It's it's
[2:13:57] there's no way to describe what it's
[2:14:00] like.
[2:14:02] And I had no real attachment,
[2:14:05] no previous memory, but Nehemiah did.
[2:14:10] It was the city of promise.
[2:14:14] He knew that God had said that I have
[2:14:17] chosen the hill of Zion as a capital for
[2:14:21] my people.
[2:14:23] The Jebusite fortress.
[2:14:26] Oh, taken
[2:14:28] by David and his men
[2:14:31] to build a palace
[2:14:34] to call it Jerusalem.
[2:14:39] 3,000year
[2:14:40] old
[2:14:42] city
[2:14:44] recognized for 3,000 years as Jerusalem.
[2:14:49] This was way back when Nehemiah knew
[2:14:53] that God said it's an eternal city. to
[2:14:57] hear that it was broken down. He knew
[2:14:59] that the temple was built on Mount Moria
[2:15:03] where Abraham
[2:15:05] was called to offer Isaac as a
[2:15:08] sacrifice. And he heard that that was
[2:15:11] now polluted,
[2:15:14] temple destroyed,
[2:15:16] stone still laying 130 years later in
[2:15:20] the ashes of its destruction. Her her
[2:15:22] bullwarks broken down, her walls cannot
[2:15:25] be compassed.
[2:15:27] and no watchmen standing on the towers
[2:15:29] because the towers have crumbled.
[2:15:31] There's no one guarding the city. And I
[2:15:34] I I've got to do something. I I have to
[2:15:36] do something. The city is laying in
[2:15:38] shambles. His countenance was cast down,
[2:15:41] the Bible said. And he couldn't shake
[2:15:45] the sadness.
[2:15:47] How long has it been? Look this way. How
[2:15:51] long has it been since you've cared
[2:15:54] about anything
[2:15:56] that much? It's a question. It's not a
[2:15:59] condemnation. It's not a judgment. It's
[2:16:02] a question. How long has it been? How
[2:16:04] long has it been since you cared about
[2:16:06] the spiritual war welfare of your
[2:16:08] children and grandchildren?
[2:16:10] As much as Nehemiah.
[2:16:14] Oh, you're there perhaps to correct
[2:16:16] them. You're there to talk about them.
[2:16:18] You're there.
[2:16:23] But how long has it been since you have
[2:16:25] been swallowed by a b a burden of
[2:16:27] compassion and and passion? And you've
[2:16:30] laid before the Lord,
[2:16:33] calling their name to God,
[2:16:36] asking God to bring them back to where
[2:16:39] they once stood in his house, in his
[2:16:41] presence. Come on now.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; You You don't mind asking everybody
[2:16:46] else?
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Pray for them. Pray for
[2:16:49] them. Pray for them. How long has it
[2:16:51] been since you missed a breakfast? How
[2:16:53] long has it been since you missed a
[2:16:55] lunch? How long has it been since you
[2:16:57] missed a supper
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; because you were so consumed?
[2:17:04] There's children in this church that
[2:17:05] have Godgiven gifts.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; They're not old enough to operate in
[2:17:10] those gifts uh uh like we like we hope
[2:17:14] one day.
[2:17:18] Some of you have been told directly,
[2:17:20] prophetically, directly
[2:17:22] that that God has placed in these
[2:17:24] children gifts
[2:17:27] to help guard and protect his bride. How
[2:17:31] long has it been since you worried
[2:17:34] stowed? I don't mean worried in the
[2:17:35] sense that you you you just don't see
[2:17:37] how it's going to be. I mean you cared
[2:17:39] enough that you bent your knee. How long
[2:17:41] has it been since your children come
[2:17:43] rushing in the house and saw daddy
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; on his knees
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; at the sofa?
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Not playing some stupid game
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; that's going to perish.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; It's going to perish.
[2:18:05] Somebody's going to beat your score. Ha.
[2:18:09] Somebody's going to beat your score.
[2:18:10] Listen, folks. in this generation we're
[2:18:13] living in now will go so far that
[2:18:15] they'll connect their their device with
[2:18:17] somebody else's device on the other side
[2:18:20] of the world or other side of the
[2:18:21] nation, somebody they don't even know.
[2:18:25] Strike up relationships and friendships
[2:18:29] with people they have no idea
[2:18:31] what they look like or what they do.
[2:18:34] Perhaps you'll be like a a girl who uh
[2:18:37] who left the church years ago with her
[2:18:40] husband, but yet determined to keep her
[2:18:42] marriage. The next thing you know, she
[2:18:44] has met someone
[2:18:47] on the other side of the world, playing
[2:18:49] games, packs her little bag, leaves her
[2:18:52] family to go and see if this is my next
[2:18:55] potential relationship. Finds out he's
[2:18:58] an old creep.
[2:19:05] by the grace of God able to escape and
[2:19:07] get back to the airport and come home.
[2:19:09] If you think that was an isolated case
[2:19:11] from from 15 years ago,
[2:19:14] there's craziness like that that goes on
[2:19:17] right now. And some of it
[2:19:21] closer than you think.
[2:19:30] closer than you think.
[2:19:32] We don't know where our children are
[2:19:34] when they're children.
[2:19:36] We don't know where they are when
[2:19:37] they're teenagers. We don't know where
[2:19:39] they are when they're young adults.
[2:19:43] If one of my children would have come to
[2:19:44] me and said, "I don't want you to
[2:19:46] monitor my whereabouts anymore. or I
[2:19:50] think I'm of age and I don't need
[2:19:53] anybody watching out and knowing where I
[2:19:55] am.
[2:19:59] I would have said tough toenails.
[2:20:03] I bought it.
[2:20:05] I pay the bill.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Don't matter whether you bought it or
[2:20:11] whether you pay the bill. Doesn't
[2:20:12] matter.
[2:20:14] I'm responsible.
[2:20:17] When I hear the story, the horror
[2:20:20] stories of that poor girl murdered
[2:20:24] on on a jogging trail by an illegal
[2:20:26] immigrant.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; An alien
[2:20:30] murdered her.
[2:20:32] And there was a glitch in the cell
[2:20:36] service that day and there was a period
[2:20:39] of time where no one could locate where
[2:20:42] she was. Not because she thought she was
[2:20:45] misindependent, but because there was
[2:20:47] actually a glitch in the system and they
[2:20:49] couldn't call her, couldn't reach her,
[2:20:51] couldn't get a hold of her, couldn't
[2:20:52] find her on that thing. And perhaps God
[2:20:55] is sovereign, but perhaps if they would
[2:20:58] have been able to see where she was,
[2:21:00] somebody might would have been able to
[2:21:02] help her
[2:21:04] to beat the hoodlm off
[2:21:08] with a rock, a big one.
[2:21:12] But instead he brutally it's sometimes
[2:21:15] it's for your own protection. One of
[2:21:17] mine come told me uh uh I I'm not you're
[2:21:21] not going to monitor me anymore. Let me
[2:21:23] tell you something. I would explain to
[2:21:25] them that's not the way life works.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; It's just not the way life works. But we
[2:21:34] get to a place where we want them oh you
[2:21:37] know they can just they've got to
[2:21:38] express who they are. They've got to,
[2:21:40] you know, they've got to let it out.
[2:21:42] They've got to be able to show their
[2:21:43] emotions and, you know, no restriction
[2:21:46] and a and every time they whimper, we've
[2:21:49] got to run them out the door and
[2:21:52] and we've got to bring the toy box to
[2:21:54] church with us. Preach
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; to make sure that they're all
[2:21:59] entertained well enough. Let me tell you
[2:22:01] something. If we would be that diligent
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; over their spiritual welfare,
[2:22:14] This is a serious hour.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; I pray God gives me something happier to
[2:22:18] preach soon.
[2:22:20] Nehemiah is so weary that he can't hide
[2:22:24] it.
[2:22:25] And he goes in with the king's cup one
[2:22:28] day
[2:22:32] and the king says, "Nehemiah, what's
[2:22:35] wrong with it? Your face, your You're
[2:22:38] always so happy.
[2:22:40] You greet the world with a smile. Why
[2:22:43] are you so sad? The reality is that
[2:22:46] Nehemiah could have been struck down
[2:22:50] by speaking to the pagan king about the
[2:22:53] welfare of the holy city of Jerusalem,
[2:22:55] which represented a kingdom that could
[2:22:57] eventually rise and take his.
[2:23:00] But Nehemiah said, "Oh, I've heard of
[2:23:03] the ruin and the destruction of
[2:23:06] Jerusalem, and I can hardly I can hardly
[2:23:08] stand it."
[2:23:11] A a and I'd like to do something about
[2:23:13] it. And guess what? The king allows him.
[2:23:16] Oh my goodness. The king allows him. Let
[2:23:19] me hurry. It's 120. I've got to hurry.
[2:23:21] So here Nehemiah when in the scripture
[2:23:24] that we read initially he's accused of
[2:23:26] self-exaltation plotting rebellion false
[2:23:28] prophecy though all he was doing was
[2:23:31] following a burden a vision on his heart
[2:23:34] Nehemiah rebuilt Jerusalem's wall as
[2:23:37] Nehemiah eventually began to rebuild
[2:23:39] Jerusalem's walls he was still being
[2:23:41] accused of self-promotion he wants to be
[2:23:44] the king remember how we read it he's
[2:23:46] gathering prophets to back him and
[2:23:48] they're prophesying that he is to be the
[2:23:50] son who will be king of Judah. All of
[2:23:53] that lies.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; All of it lies.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Just misunderstanding.
[2:24:05] That's where Nehemiah was. He was
[2:24:09] fermenting
[2:24:10] in the vessel of misunderstanding.
[2:24:13] While they lied about his intentions,
[2:24:15] while they lied about his purpose, while
[2:24:18] they even lied about the spiritual
[2:24:20] nature of why he was doing what he was
[2:24:22] doing, Nehemiah wasn't trying to be
[2:24:24] king. He was simply trying to do God's
[2:24:26] work. But people were constantly
[2:24:28] twisting his motives and attacking his
[2:24:30] integrity, his character, publicly
[2:24:33] maligned.
[2:24:35] And in verse eight,
[2:24:38] then I sent unto him, saying, look at
[2:24:40] it. Nehemiah 6:8, there are no such
[2:24:44] things done
[2:24:48] as thou sayest, but thou fainst them out
[2:24:52] of thine own heart. In the amplified, it
[2:24:55] reads, I replied to him, no such things
[2:25:00] as you say have been done. You are
[2:25:04] inventing them out of your own heart and
[2:25:08] mind. It doesn't have to be true. Stay
[2:25:13] with me
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; for somebody to tell it.
[2:25:21] They told all across the Carolas
[2:25:25] that standing up there behind brother
[2:25:27] Shelly is a is a scroll dedicated to a
[2:25:31] woman preacher.
[2:25:34] They failed to mention that it was my
[2:25:36] grandmother.
[2:25:37] They failed to mention that she that we
[2:25:40] are continuing a church that she built
[2:25:44] and paid for with her own money.
[2:25:49] Whether you like it or not, we have
[2:25:51] benefited and we I mean we've we paid
[2:25:55] this mortgage off. I understand that.
[2:25:58] But we wouldn't have been here in the
[2:25:59] first place.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't be in the building we're in
[2:26:02] right now had we not been able to sell
[2:26:04] the building that she left
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; free and clear.
[2:26:08] I'm not edifying her years of preaching.
[2:26:11] When when I bought when I got that
[2:26:13] scroll from Jerusalem and when Sister
[2:26:15] Nancy helped have that inscription made,
[2:26:17] it wasn't to memorialize her as a woman
[2:26:20] preacher. It was to memorialize her as
[2:26:22] my spiritual roots.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; And there's someone who loved the word.
[2:26:28] So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; But they tell that all over the world
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; like that. I I want to say to them like
[2:26:39] Nehemiah, no such thing
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; as you say have even been done.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; When I pastored in South Carolina, we
[2:26:49] prayed over rocks. We did. I got some in
[2:26:53] here.
[2:26:55] And we put them places where we needed
[2:26:57] some breakthrough
[2:26:59] under the bed of an old sorry, bitter,
[2:27:03] mean, ugly backslider who was
[2:27:05] mistreating his family.
[2:27:08] I prayed over that rock and I said,
[2:27:10] "Father, give him nightmares.
[2:27:14] [Applause]
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Let him wake up like the drunk man in
[2:27:19] brother Sheffy's movie
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; and find himself in a bathtub of fire
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; until he run." That's how that's how
[2:27:28] crazy and radical we were in those days.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; And God did it.
[2:27:35] My mother decided she was going to serve
[2:27:37] the Lord further. She wanted to come to
[2:27:39] South Carolina to do it. The bank told
[2:27:40] her, "We don't have a job available.
[2:27:42] There's no way in the world you'll ever
[2:27:43] get a transfer to South Carolina." I
[2:27:46] said, "Mother," she was up to visit.
[2:27:48] Take this anointed rock and go lay it uh
[2:27:50] down at the head main office in
[2:27:52] Columbus. Lay it up there where the
[2:27:54] manager, the big big wig down there,
[2:27:56] when she gets out of her car, let that
[2:27:58] rock be laying right by her car every
[2:28:00] day. And when God gets through her, it
[2:28:03] was just a point of contact. That's all.
[2:28:05] It's not a doctrine.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell the whole world.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Just a point of contact. May May the
[2:28:12] voice of God cry out to her. May May she
[2:28:15] find herself in a tither
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; until she says, "Jane, I I'm going to
[2:28:20] make a I'm going to make a place."
[2:28:23] It wasn't But listen, it wasn't weeks.
[2:28:26] It was a very short amount of time. They
[2:28:28] called from Anderson, South Carolina,
[2:28:29] and said, "We understand that there's a
[2:28:31] lady down there who wants to make a
[2:28:32] transfer. We don't even know how they
[2:28:34] knew there at the bank, but and we'd
[2:28:36] like to have her.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; We've looked at her. We see she's been a
[2:28:39] teller for years. We need a teller
[2:28:41] manager. We'd like to have her."
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Mama said, "Should I bring the rock?" I
[2:28:47] said, "No, leave it there. We want them
[2:28:49] saved now. Now, we're going to work on
[2:28:50] their salvation."
[2:28:53] And you know what they told after I came
[2:28:56] to the message? They told all over the
[2:28:58] city that if you go over there on a
[2:29:00] prayer meeting night, they get on the
[2:29:01] floor, all fours, put rocks on their
[2:29:03] back
[2:29:05] and crawl all over the church praying in
[2:29:08] the in the name of a dead man.
[2:29:14] Somebody said, "Where did they get a
[2:29:16] story?" Don't you understand? Nehemiah
[2:29:18] knew where it came from. People will,
[2:29:21] especially when you're in a vessel,
[2:29:22] vessel of misunderstanding, people will
[2:29:25] invent out of their imagination,
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; out of their own emotion, out of their
[2:29:31] own prejudices,
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; out of their own jealousies.
[2:29:38] They will make up something as elaborate
[2:29:41] as crawling around the church on prayer
[2:29:44] meeting night with a pile of rocks on
[2:29:46] your back praying in the in the name of
[2:29:48] a dead man.
[2:29:53] Nothing of any
[2:29:56] Well, there was nothing even similar.
[2:30:00] We were just shaking backsliders out of
[2:30:02] their beds.
[2:30:05] Same way we put prayer claws. She ought
[2:30:07] to have tried.
[2:30:12] We had faith. We believed that if a
[2:30:15] point of contact got in their space
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; that God would deal with her heart. It
[2:30:24] worked.
[2:30:25] Nehemiah just look, I just want to see
[2:30:27] the walls repaired. I don't care who the
[2:30:30] king is.
[2:30:32] I don't care who gets the glory.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; You've never done anything for God.
[2:30:36] Listen,
[2:30:38] you've never done anything for God until
[2:30:40] you've done it. And you absolutely don't
[2:30:43] care
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; who.
[2:30:46] You will sit in the room and watch
[2:30:48] somebody else receive the credit and the
[2:30:51] praise and the brag for what you have
[2:30:54] done.
[2:30:56] And you'll smile and nod your head and
[2:30:58] agree with them. Yes. That's right. Oh,
[2:31:00] that's so nice. Oh my goodness. Wasn't
[2:31:03] that a wonderful thing our brother did?
[2:31:04] Yes.
[2:31:06] and you will nod your head. Somebody
[2:31:08] said, "Would you do it?" I have.
[2:31:13] I have had evangelists come here and
[2:31:15] preach messages and say things that I
[2:31:17] have been saying, exact sentences, exact
[2:31:20] points that I have been preaching for 30
[2:31:23] years. While they were still in sin
[2:31:26] serving the devil, I was preaching
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; what you bragged them up
[2:31:33] for saying.
[2:31:35] And the reality is some of them got it
[2:31:37] from me anyhow
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; and came here and preached it anyway.
[2:31:41] And I didn't care.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Well, why are you mentioning it? Because
[2:31:45] I'm telling you, it don't matter. When
[2:31:47] you care, when you see people
[2:31:49] responding, when you see people
[2:31:51] listening to a preacher that won't
[2:31:52] listen to you anymore,
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; when you see people moving that don't
[2:31:56] usually move, your heart, if you're a
[2:31:58] watchman, your heart gets so moved.
[2:32:05] that you just say, "Oh, God."
[2:32:08] Don't matter who you use.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; We're the ones who get so picky over who
[2:32:13] God use. Whoever use Roosters, roosters.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; Jackasses.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; You You know he's desperate when he
[2:32:26] starts cussing.
[2:32:30] No. No. Oh, it looks like you've taken a
[2:32:32] hard fold. No, unless you consider the
[2:32:34] fact that I'm cussing in the pull pit.
[2:32:41] God will use whatever.
[2:32:44] And if you've got a burden and God uses
[2:32:47] a whatever to help see something in that
[2:32:50] situation move, you'll praise God.
[2:32:53] You'll praise God for a whatever.
[2:33:00] Time is quickly slipping. Not this
[2:33:02] morning.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; But time is quickly slipping away from
[2:33:08] us.
[2:33:13] You You're just emotional
[2:33:15] because you're getting older.
[2:33:18] The reality is I know I I don't have
[2:33:20] another 50 years of ministry.
[2:33:25] I've asked myself every day this week
[2:33:27] just about
[2:33:31] closer.
[2:33:33] Have we come any higher?
[2:33:37] Have we found any measure of deliverance
[2:33:40] that's greater than we had when we
[2:33:43] started out? Are we any closer? H Have
[2:33:47] we made any progress? Have we in all of
[2:33:50] our wanderings in the wilderness? Ha
[2:33:52] have we do we have any more of home in
[2:33:55] our heart? Do we do we have any more
[2:33:57] fight left in us? Do do we do we uh just
[2:34:01] coast now or or is there a possibility
[2:34:04] that we will catch one more real wind
[2:34:11] and push
[2:34:13] pray until something happens.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; It's not your emotion that I'm asking
[2:34:19] for.
[2:34:22] Because emotion can be just as religious
[2:34:24] as anything else.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; I'm asking for determination that will
[2:34:28] last beyond a sermon. I'm asking for
[2:34:31] determination that will wake you up
[2:34:33] Monday morning. Yes.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; A determination that is not about
[2:34:38] proving to others who you are
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; or what you've done or how sorry you are
[2:34:44] or whether your repentance is real or
[2:34:45] not.
[2:34:47] But a determination that says if they
[2:34:49] never forgive me, if they never change
[2:34:53] their minds about me,
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; if they never invite me to their party,
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; come on,
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; if they never include me for swimming,
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve God more than I've
[2:35:06] ever served him before.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the word and ask God
[2:35:11] to make it real in me like I never have
[2:35:13] before.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to support the meeting. I'm
[2:35:17] going to be faithful. I'm going to pray
[2:35:18] for my pastor. I'm going to pray for my
[2:35:21] family. I'm going to find a place by the
[2:35:23] couch
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; on occasion.
[2:35:32] I'm not trying to make you feel
[2:35:34] terrible.
[2:35:36] What if I were to go around this room
[2:35:38] and and speak to your teenager and ask
[2:35:40] them, "How long has it been since you've
[2:35:42] heard mama in her bedroom
[2:35:46] praying?"
[2:35:50] How long has it been since you walked in
[2:35:52] on dad?
[2:35:55] Pray.
[2:35:57] How long has it been since you since you
[2:36:00] What if I asked these smart I say smart
[2:36:02] elic but um smart children
[2:36:09] we have they're also products of their
[2:36:12] of their generation
[2:36:16] they're some of them are products of
[2:36:18] immunization some of them are products
[2:36:19] of this generation products of screens
[2:36:25] smarter than they know what to do with
[2:36:31] the attention span of a bumblebee.
[2:36:38] So used to getting everything in tiny
[2:36:40] little pieces,
[2:36:42] not just as little all the way up,
[2:36:46] just little bite-sized pieces of life.
[2:36:49] What if I were to ask them, "These are
[2:36:51] teenagers here and some older." What if
[2:36:55] I were to go to somebody like Callie's
[2:36:57] age? Or or uh Nora, how old are you?
[2:37:01] Seven. That's old enough. I was
[2:37:02] preaching at seven. Who's 17 here? I was
[2:37:06] pastoring at 17.
[2:37:08] So, that'll give you a little
[2:37:09] perspective. Nora, come. Come up here.
[2:37:11] Let everybody see how tall you are at
[2:37:13] seven.
[2:37:16] Maybe I was a little taller. Turn
[2:37:18] around. Let everybody see you. Maybe I
[2:37:20] was a little taller. Of course, I didn't
[2:37:22] go barefoot in church, so I might have
[2:37:23] had, you know,
[2:37:26] Thank you, sweetheart. Go sit down.
[2:37:27] You're beautiful.
[2:37:31] Who is 17? Jaden, was that you? Stand
[2:37:33] up. You're not beautiful, but stand up.
[2:37:36] Turn around here and see.
[2:37:38] Sit down. I was never that skinny,
[2:37:42] but I was 17 at one time, pastoring a
[2:37:44] denominational church, preaching my
[2:37:47] first sermon, not much taller than Nora.
[2:37:50] I know a little bit about what I'm
[2:37:51] talking about. What if we were to go
[2:37:54] around this room? What if I were to ask
[2:37:56] Nora?
[2:37:58] What? What? How old is Millie? Millia.
[2:38:03] Nine. So, anybody in that age group,
[2:38:05] what if I were to go around and ask
[2:38:07] them, "How long has it been since you've
[2:38:08] walked in the room and daddy was sitting
[2:38:10] in the chair after work with a Bible in
[2:38:12] his lap?
[2:38:15] How long has it been since the sound of
[2:38:16] Brother Brandham's voice was heard in
[2:38:19] the kitchen?
[2:38:23] You think I'm mad? I'm not mad. If I was
[2:38:26] mad, I'd have indigestion. I don't have
[2:38:28] any indigestion.
[2:38:31] How long has it been? Is that because
[2:38:32] we're so far along now that we don't
[2:38:34] need those kind of things? We don't need
[2:38:36] We don't need a daddy with a Bible.
[2:38:39] Someone recently told me, "I don't even
[2:38:41] have a Bible
[2:38:42] because I have my phone." You need a
[2:38:45] Bible.
[2:38:50] You're going to beat the devil with a
[2:38:52] phone.
[2:38:54] Papa works. He had a He had a Bible.
[2:39:01] I know it's not the word on the page.
[2:39:03] It's the word in you that's going to
[2:39:05] defeat the enemy. I am just making a
[2:39:07] point that we have gotten really out of
[2:39:10] cater here. What if I were to go around
[2:39:12] and ask what goes on in your home?
[2:39:18] Is it ever mentioned?
[2:39:21] Is there ever a prayer offered on
[2:39:22] Saturday night for a good service
[2:39:26] on Sunday morning?
[2:39:31] I'm only trying to point out that the
[2:39:34] zeal that we have had,
[2:39:37] many of us no longer have. And there's
[2:39:40] never been a more critical hour to have
[2:39:42] a zeal for the house of God, for the
[2:39:45] things of God, than now. Now is the
[2:39:49] time. Now is the moment. and and and
[2:39:54] Nehemiah, as long as he didn't really
[2:39:56] know, he knew what had happened, but as
[2:39:58] long as he didn't have a a picture of
[2:40:00] what had happened in Jerusale, he could
[2:40:02] go on and serve the king. But once he
[2:40:04] caught an image
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; through the description of the merchant,
[2:40:09] he said, "I just can no longer function,
[2:40:11] sir. I just can't stand the fact."
[2:40:17] He didn't know he was fixing to be
[2:40:20] fermenting in the vessel of
[2:40:24] misunderstanding.
[2:40:26] Nehemiah 1:3 and4 I'm closing. I I don't
[2:40:29] know why. I mean I What good does it do
[2:40:32] to preach a third of a sermon?
[2:40:41] I don't have 50 more years
[2:40:44] to preach.
[2:40:48] You don't have 50 more years to listen.
[2:40:53] We're in the last generation.
[2:40:56] You think it's o those of us who are
[2:40:58] over 50. I I No.
[2:41:05] Eternity is closer than it's ever been.
[2:41:11] You maybe you'll be like those who won't
[2:41:12] believe it until it's upon them. But I'm
[2:41:14] telling you, you'll look back one day
[2:41:16] and see, oh my,
[2:41:20] we didn't realize
[2:41:22] where things were going and how quickly
[2:41:24] they were going there.
[2:41:27] Nehemiah 1 3 and 4. And they said unto
[2:41:28] me, the remnant that are left of the
[2:41:30] captivity there in the province are in
[2:41:33] great affliction and reproach. The wall
[2:41:36] of Jerusalem also is broken down, and
[2:41:38] the gates thereof are burned with fire.
[2:41:40] And it came to pass when I heard these
[2:41:41] words that I sat down and wept and
[2:41:44] mourned certain days and fasted and
[2:41:47] prayed before the God of heaven.
[2:41:50] Nehemiah's immediate response was
[2:41:52] fasting and prayer and seeking God to
[2:41:55] take some intervention to do something
[2:41:58] about this awful condition of the broken
[2:42:02] down walls of the city of Jerusalem. In
[2:42:05] verse 5, he said, ' And I said, I
[2:42:07] beseech thee, oh Lord, a God of heaven,
[2:42:09] the great and terrible God that keepeth
[2:42:11] covenant and mercy for them that love
[2:42:13] him and observe his commandments. Let
[2:42:15] thine ear now be attentive and thine
[2:42:18] eyes open that thou mayest hear the
[2:42:20] prayer of thy servant which I pray
[2:42:22] before thee now day and night for the
[2:42:24] children of Israel, thy servants, and
[2:42:27] confess the sins of the children of
[2:42:29] Israel, which we have sinned against
[2:42:31] thee. Both I and my father's house have
[2:42:34] sinned. We have dealt corruptly against
[2:42:36] thee, and have not kept the
[2:42:38] commandments, nor the statutes, nor the
[2:42:39] judgments which thou commandest thy
[2:42:41] servant Moses. Remember, I beseech thee
[2:42:43] the word that thou commandest thy
[2:42:45] servant Moses, saying, If you
[2:42:47] transgress, I will scatter you abroad.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; They're living in the reality of what
[2:42:53] the prophet warned them about. Yes.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; For if you turn But if you turn unto me
[2:42:58] and keep my commandments, and do them,
[2:42:59] though there were of you cast out into
[2:43:01] the uttermost parts of the heaven, yet
[2:43:02] will I gather thee from then, bring thee
[2:43:04] under the place that I have chosen to
[2:43:07] set my name thereof. Nehemiah's praying,
[2:43:09] God, I remember you made some promises
[2:43:10] over the Jewish people. You made some
[2:43:12] promises to Abraham, that your seed
[2:43:15] would his seed would be as numerous as
[2:43:16] the sands of the seashore and the stars
[2:43:18] of the heaven. I remember that you said
[2:43:20] that Jerusalem was a covenant bridal
[2:43:23] city. I remember you said Messiah would
[2:43:26] sit in that city one day and judge the
[2:43:28] nations. How is it possible when the
[2:43:31] walls are torn down? The gates are
[2:43:34] burned
[2:43:35] and there's no one doing anything about
[2:43:39] it.
[2:43:41] Let thine ear now be attentive to the
[2:43:42] prayer of thy servant. Verse 11. And to
[2:43:44] the prayers of thy servants who desire
[2:43:46] to fear thy name and prosper. I pray
[2:43:48] thee thy servant this day and grant him
[2:43:50] mercy in the sight of this man. for I
[2:43:52] was the king's cup bearer.
[2:43:57] He had boldness. God gave him divine
[2:44:00] favor. And in in Nehemiah 24-8,
[2:44:04] he got some permission to do something
[2:44:06] about it. Let me read it quickly. You
[2:44:07] see how I can read it fast? Can you hear
[2:44:09] it fast? Can you understand it fast?
[2:44:12] Then the king said unto me, "For what
[2:44:14] dost thou request?" So I prayed to the
[2:44:16] God of heaven, and I said unto the king,
[2:44:18] if it pleased the king, and if thy
[2:44:20] servant found favor in thy sight, that
[2:44:22] thou would send me unto Judah, unto the
[2:44:24] city of my father's separates, that I
[2:44:25] may build it. And the king said unto me,
[2:44:27] the queen also sitting by him. For how
[2:44:29] long shalt thy journey be, and when will
[2:44:31] thou return? For so it pleased the king
[2:44:34] to send me for a set time, and I set him
[2:44:36] a time. Moreover, I said unto the king,
[2:44:39] if it pleased the king, his letters be
[2:44:40] given to me to the governors beyond the
[2:44:42] river, that they may convey me over till
[2:44:44] I come into Judah. He knew the journey
[2:44:45] wouldn't be easy. And a letter unto
[2:44:47] Asaf, the keeper of the king's forest,
[2:44:49] that he may give me timber to make beams
[2:44:50] for the gates of the palace.
[2:44:54] You bold little cupbearer, you
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; not only are you asking for a royal
[2:44:59] decree from the king, you're asking for
[2:45:00] letters of permission to pass through
[2:45:03] enemy territory. And now you're asking
[2:45:06] for royal beams to be given to you from
[2:45:08] the king's forest to build and restore
[2:45:12] the gates and the house of worship for
[2:45:15] the Jews that we conquered.
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; Oh God, make us Nehemiah's.
[2:45:32] Make beams for the gates of the palace
[2:45:34] which have pertained to the house and
[2:45:35] for the wall of the city and for the
[2:45:36] house that I shall enter into. And the
[2:45:38] king granted me according to the good
[2:45:39] hand of my God upon me. It was divine
[2:45:42] favor on his life. Nehemiah uh uh 2:9.
[2:45:45] Then I came to the governors beyond the
[2:45:47] river and gave them the king's letters.
[2:45:48] Now the king had sent captains of the
[2:45:49] army and horsemen with me. And then
[2:45:52] Nehemiah 21:17 18. Then said I unto
[2:45:55] them, Ye see the distress that we are
[2:45:56] in. how Jerusalem lith waste, the gates
[2:45:58] are of a burn with fire. Come and let us
[2:46:01] build up the wall of Jerusalem that we
[2:46:03] be no more a reproach. Then I told them
[2:46:05] with the hand of my God which was good
[2:46:07] upon me and also the king's words that
[2:46:08] he had spoken unto me. And listen to
[2:46:10] what they said, let us
[2:46:15] get mad at the preacher. Oh no, no. Let
[2:46:19] us rise up and build.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; So they strengthen their hands.
[2:46:28] for this good work. With official
[2:46:31] authority and military escort, Nehemiah
[2:46:33] begins his journey from Persia to the
[2:46:35] devastated city of Jerusalem. Nehemiah
[2:46:37] Nehemiah led the charge of the
[2:46:39] rebuilding of the walls amidst fierce
[2:46:40] opposition. Enemies like San Ballad,
[2:46:42] Tobaya, and Gisham attempt to stop the
[2:46:45] work with mockery, ridicule, and
[2:46:47] intimidation. Oh, you're building the
[2:46:49] walls, are you?
[2:46:52] You and that rag tag bunch of hooknosed
[2:46:55] Jews.
[2:46:56] They were enemies of God.
[2:46:59] Oh,
[2:47:02] you you you're you don't even know what
[2:47:03] you're doing. If a fox should run up
[2:47:07] against it, he knocked the whole wall
[2:47:08] down.
[2:47:10] There's always going to be somebody
[2:47:13] saying something.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; I heard you. I heard you, Tiffany.
[2:47:19] Something about you.
[2:47:22] When you start out to make a change in
[2:47:24] your life, when you start reordering
[2:47:26] your priorities,
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; every time somebody you love will call
[2:47:30] you religious, somebody you love without
[2:47:34] you ever trying to push things on them.
[2:47:36] Here's the problem that we make when we
[2:47:38] catch a new zeal. We want to force it.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; That's legalistic
[2:47:45] phariseism.
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; It won't work.
[2:47:48] You've got to build an atmosphere with
[2:47:50] the changes you make in your life
[2:47:52] that'll make them so hungry,
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; so spiritually jealous of what God's
[2:47:58] doing in you and for you that they'll
[2:48:00] start wanting to pay the price you're
[2:48:01] paying.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; But instead, we want to go talking to
[2:48:04] them about their ham sandwich.
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; You think that's what the bride ought to
[2:48:09] be worried about now
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; in this late hour?
[2:48:16] You think that we ought to be worried
[2:48:17] about whether somebody has lit a candle
[2:48:20] for Shabbat?
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; You think that is how we're going to
[2:48:26] bring our families into total surrender
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; for this? No.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; You're trading one religious practice
[2:48:33] for another religious practice. It'll
[2:48:35] never work and it will never satisfy you
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; for very long because you were born for
[2:48:41] more. You were listen you were born for
[2:48:43] more than a tradition. You were born for
[2:48:46] more than than a regulation.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; You were born to become the
[2:48:52] manifestation of the word.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; The revelation
[2:49:02] these things won't satisfy for long.
[2:49:06] The reason why I thank God for the
[2:49:07] standard that we have been able to
[2:49:08] maintain is because it has given us the
[2:49:12] single benefit of not having to deal
[2:49:15] with some of the things that other
[2:49:17] churches around this message have had to
[2:49:19] deal with in forms of compromise. But
[2:49:22] we've got it.
[2:49:27] We've got it, too.
[2:49:30] When teenagers from this body can go in
[2:49:32] public with short britches on, we've got
[2:49:35] compromise in this body, too.
[2:49:39] There's certain things for home. You
[2:49:41] sleep in certain something certain
[2:49:43] whatever. It's your business. That's not
[2:49:46] the way we want to run to town.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; You ladies
[2:49:52] be careful.
[2:49:58] You get around them and they they've got
[2:50:00] on now in the churches so much makeup.
[2:50:04] I'm not talking about Pentecostal
[2:50:05] churches. They've been having it for 40
[2:50:07] years that way.
[2:50:09] Talking about churches that know better.
[2:50:14] It's very, very sad. But we've
[2:50:16] maintained enough of the standard here
[2:50:18] that we have kept some of that beat
[2:50:20] back. And I tell you what, I'm fixing to
[2:50:21] rise up and beat some more of it back.
[2:50:29] This is a serious hour we're living in.
[2:50:30] And it is not about rules and
[2:50:32] regulations and restrictions. It's about
[2:50:33] a heart sold out to God.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; But if you let the walls fall down
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; and you don't do anything to restore
[2:50:40] them,
[2:50:41] then the people will cast off.
[2:50:46] And the benefit the the the horrible
[2:50:50] ending of casting off restraint
[2:50:54] is perish.
[2:51:04] San Ballad, Horonite, Tobaya the
[2:51:07] servant, the Ammonite, Gisham the
[2:51:09] Arabian, Nehemiah 21:19 heard it. They
[2:51:11] laughed us to scorn and despised us and
[2:51:13] said, "What is this thing that you do?
[2:51:15] Will you rebel against the king?"
[2:51:17] Rebel against the king. We're trying to
[2:51:20] build the walls back. We're trying to
[2:51:22] restore the heritage of the we we we're
[2:51:25] no challenge to the king. It's always
[2:51:29] politics, isn't it? Nehemiah 4:1. But it
[2:51:32] came to pass that when Sam Balot heard
[2:51:33] that we builded the wall, he was wroth.
[2:51:35] He took great indignation and mocked the
[2:51:36] Jews. He spake before his brethren and
[2:51:38] the army of Samaria and said, "What do
[2:51:40] these feeble Jews? Will they fortify
[2:51:42] themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will
[2:51:44] they make an end in a day? Will they
[2:51:45] revive the stones out of the heaps of
[2:51:47] the rubbish which are burned?" Now
[2:51:48] Tobiia the Amorite Ammonite was by him
[2:51:51] and he said even that which they build
[2:51:53] if a fox go up he'll break it down.
[2:52:01] So sad there was such internal strife
[2:52:04] among the Jews themselves
[2:52:07] because in the midst of the restoration
[2:52:08] they start uh going back and choosing
[2:52:10] wives
[2:52:13] from pagan nations.
[2:52:18] We always want to make it
[2:52:21] about
[2:52:22] color or race.
[2:52:26] In the Bible, it wasn't about shades of
[2:52:29] skin.
[2:52:34] It was about coming from pagan religions
[2:52:37] and nations who did not acknowledge the
[2:52:40] real true genuine God. God said, "Don't
[2:52:44] take wives from them." Not particularly
[2:52:48] because because we forget
[2:52:51] that these Jews were not Ashkanazis
[2:52:54] coming out of Egypt,
[2:52:56] pale European Jews.
[2:52:59] They were Middle Eastern Jews of Arab
[2:53:02] descent,
[2:53:06] darker skinned,
[2:53:08] thicker, darker skinned people.
[2:53:12] We make it we we find some little
[2:53:16] something and we and we make it about uh
[2:53:19] uh you know how Lord have mercy what
[2:53:21] would they do in South Africa when
[2:53:23] there's a hundred different shades of
[2:53:24] skin because of the mixing of the uh of
[2:53:27] the English, the Dutch, the British, the
[2:53:30] the and the Zulus.
[2:53:32] And they've got black, white, and
[2:53:33] colored. And colored covers a multitude
[2:53:37] of of skin tones. And is somebody
[2:53:40] supposed to go and put their arm up next
[2:53:42] to somebody's arm and make sure the the
[2:53:45] skin tone matches before they're not
[2:53:47] about that.
[2:53:49] You don't I don't need your amen. It's
[2:53:52] not about that. We make it about that
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; because we're still bearing the curse of
[2:53:56] such wicked racism in this nation.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; But it's about joining
[2:54:03] uh you know mar unequally yolked
[2:54:06] together here. You're sacrificing to God
[2:54:08] Almighty with your life of modesty and
[2:54:10] holiness and you go and marry somebody.
[2:54:15] Never mind.
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; We don't have to say it.
[2:54:19] You certainly know
[2:54:21] it didn't work. It didn't work for Ahab
[2:54:25] and she was of the same color.
[2:54:31] There was such internal strife among the
[2:54:33] Jews because they were taking these
[2:54:35] heathen wives after God had already told
[2:54:37] them not to do it and they had repented
[2:54:38] of doing it. And now in the midst of the
[2:54:40] restoration, they start doing it again
[2:54:42] and he has to lay it out. Go read it for
[2:54:44] yourself. Nehemiah 5, I'll spare you the
[2:54:47] first 13 verses of that chapter, but go
[2:54:49] home. Go read it. So, not only do I have
[2:54:52] to deal with a San Ballot and a Tobias
[2:54:55] and all these other heathens
[2:54:58] who mock everything we try to do to
[2:54:59] restore the walls, now I there's
[2:55:02] dissension in the ranks and we can't
[2:55:05] even get together on who to marry
[2:55:08] and he carries 13 verses to try to sort
[2:55:10] that out. Nehemiah, however, remains
[2:55:12] resolute trusting in the God of heaven
[2:55:14] to bring success.
[2:55:16] He responded with strategic planning,
[2:55:18] prayer, and vigilance, and firm
[2:55:20] correction of injustice within the
[2:55:22] community.
[2:55:24] And I want to read these verses and
[2:55:25] close. And I haven't preached this
[2:55:28] message. I meddled.
[2:55:31] Anointed meddling. You needed it. I
[2:55:34] needed it. We needed it. Nehemiah, no
[2:55:37] apologies.
[2:55:40] You may leave with indigestion. I'm not
[2:55:42] not leaving here with any heartburn. I'm
[2:55:45] leaving here with the appetite. And it
[2:55:47] came to pass from that time forth in
[2:55:49] Nehemiah 4:16 that the half of my
[2:55:51] servants wrought. You said you want you
[2:55:54] said you wanted a house of deliverance.
[2:55:58] You said you wanted a pastor who would
[2:56:00] bring correction.
[2:56:02] You said you wanted somebody who saw
[2:56:04] would see in the spirit and tell us what
[2:56:07] we needed in this hour. Now don't you
[2:56:09] draw back your hand now.
[2:56:12] Come on.
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I ask you why are you
[2:56:14] here?
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; If you were here for a for a 45minute
[2:56:18] denominational sermonet, you knew when
[2:56:20] you walked in here that was not likely
[2:56:22] what you were going to have.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; You weren't fooled into coming this
[2:56:26] morning.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you know I face every day the
[2:56:30] reality that if we would cut these
[2:56:32] services down and and and short we would
[2:56:34] we could have more. There are people who
[2:56:36] love us, who love a little bit of the
[2:56:39] truth that I preach and could could
[2:56:40] certainly come and sit. We know people
[2:56:43] have said they would have moved here if
[2:56:44] the services hadn't have been so long.
[2:56:49] But I don't know if I'm willing just yet
[2:56:50] at the at 57. I don't know if I'm
[2:56:53] willing
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; when time is getting so short. Even
[2:56:57] though I know
[2:57:00] that I haven't had some of you
[2:57:03] in an hour,
[2:57:07] but it's recorded.
[2:57:12] This is serious. This chapter here, let
[2:57:14] me I I can't read it all, but but I'm
[2:57:16] going to get 16-23. And it came to pass
[2:57:19] chapter 4 that from that time forth that
[2:57:21] the half of my servants wrought the work
[2:57:24] and the other half of them held both
[2:57:25] spears and shields and bows and
[2:57:28] harbishons and the rulers were behind
[2:57:30] all the house of Judah. They which build
[2:57:34] it on the wall, and they that bear
[2:57:35] burdens, with those that laid it to
[2:57:37] everyone, with one of his hands wrought
[2:57:40] in the work, and with the other hand
[2:57:47] he held a weapon.
[2:57:49] Hammer in one hand, sword in another.
[2:57:53] What a divided task.
[2:57:57] can't continue to build with full effort
[2:58:00] because you have to spend so much time
[2:58:02] beating the enemy back. Hello.
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; So, you just have to divide the task.
[2:58:08] I'm building with one hand and cutting
[2:58:11] back the enemy.
[2:58:14] &gt;&gt; We must. That's what happened here. For
[2:58:18] the builders, everyone had his sword
[2:58:19] girded by his side and so build it. Now
[2:58:21] listen. They which build it on the wall,
[2:58:23] and they that bear burdens, with those
[2:58:24] that laid it, everyone with one of his
[2:58:26] hands wrought in the work, and with the
[2:58:28] other hand held a weapon. For if, for
[2:58:29] the builders everyone had his sword
[2:58:31] girded by his side, and so build it. And
[2:58:33] he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
[2:58:36] And I said unto the nobles, and to the
[2:58:37] rulers, and to the rest of the people,
[2:58:39] the work is great and large,
[2:58:43] and we are separated upon the wall,
[2:58:46] one far from another.
[2:58:49] In what place therefore ye hear the
[2:58:51] sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither
[2:58:54] unto us,
[2:58:58] our God shall fight for us.
[2:59:05] Nearly 30 years ago,
[2:59:08] there was a call that went out of this
[2:59:10] place with those very words.
[2:59:13] We are separated on the wall.
[2:59:17] We are not making the progress we need
[2:59:19] to make because we're so far separated
[2:59:21] on the wall. In whatsoever place you
[2:59:23] hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye
[2:59:25] thither. For our God shall fight for us.
[2:59:30] And some heard that call and changed
[2:59:32] their lives. the trajectory of their
[2:59:35] life changed forever
[2:59:39] because they recognized
[2:59:42] the blessing and the benefit of being
[2:59:45] together in community when you're when
[2:59:48] you're building with one hand
[2:59:51] and slaying enemies with the other.
[2:59:57] Somehow we have forgotten how to do
[3:00:00] things
[3:00:02] like that.
[3:00:04] Build and fight. Build and fight. Build
[3:00:06] and fight. You can't stop building to
[3:00:08] fight. You can't stop fighting to build.
[3:00:11] So what do you do? You build and fight.
[3:00:14] We fight in prayer. We slay enemies in
[3:00:17] prayer. We slay enemies in praise. We
[3:00:19] slay enemies by pressing into Christ.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; We defeat the enemy. We defeat the
[3:00:23] naysayer
[3:00:25] by doing what they say we cannot because
[3:00:28] we depend on the Lord and not our own
[3:00:29] strength and power.
[3:00:31] &gt;&gt; Huh? So we labored in the work and half
[3:00:33] of them held the spears from the rising
[3:00:35] of the morning till the stars appeared.
[3:00:37] Enough enough workers came. They said,
[3:00:40] "Okay, we'll we can divide this up now.
[3:00:43] Half will build, half will fight." He
[3:00:45] said, "So neither I said, let everyone
[3:00:48] with his servant lodge within Jerusalem,
[3:00:50] that in the night they may be a guard to
[3:00:52] us and labor on the day." Wasn't much
[3:00:55] time for sleep.
[3:00:58] Built all day, watched all night. So
[3:01:01] neither I nor my brethren, nor my
[3:01:02] servants, nor the men of the guard which
[3:01:04] followed me, none of us put off our
[3:01:06] clothes, saving that every one of them
[3:01:08] put them off for washing. Thank God on
[3:01:11] occasion they washed their clothes. No
[3:01:13] need for night clothes, no need for PJs
[3:01:17] because they didn't need them anymore.
[3:01:19] They watched or worked. They worked or
[3:01:21] watched. And you know what it says in
[3:01:23] Nehemiah 6:15? So the wall was finished
[3:01:27] in 52 days.
[3:01:32] What took hundreds of years?
[3:01:35] Yes. Because somebody was always tearing
[3:01:37] part of it down.
[3:01:39] Now all in shambles
[3:01:42] and we restored it in 52 days. Why? Why
[3:01:45] do you think that is? It's real easy.
[3:01:47] The people had a mind to work.
[3:01:51] The people had a mind to work. And
[3:01:53] what's the first thing they did? I'm
[3:01:54] closing.
[3:01:56] What's the first thing they did? They
[3:01:58] called a a holy uh convocation, a
[3:02:01] consecration in in Nehemiah 8. What are
[3:02:04] you talking about? The vessel of
[3:02:05] misunderstanding. Here was a man accused
[3:02:07] of having ambition. He didn't have
[3:02:09] ambition. He had a burden.
[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; He had a passion.
[3:02:14] &gt;&gt; One that he couldn't get rid of. One
[3:02:15] that he couldn't sleep off. One that he
[3:02:17] couldn't take enough pills to forget.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; One who said we can't wait. We can't
[3:02:24] have vacation.
[3:02:26] We got to build in the day and watch in
[3:02:29] the night.
[3:02:31] &gt;&gt; What it took him years and years and
[3:02:33] years to do. We don't have that much
[3:02:35] time. The enemy is getting too
[3:02:37] comfortable in our ruins.
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; He's about to sweep the city clean and
[3:02:42] raise up a fortress of some false pagan
[3:02:45] heathen king and god. If we don't take
[3:02:47] this back for the god of all eternity,
[3:02:49] it'll soon be lost to all all of us.
[3:02:52] We've got to get it done. And so he
[3:02:53] partnered Nehemiah after all this was
[3:02:55] restored, he partnered with Ezra the
[3:02:57] scribe in reading the law publicly. This
[3:02:59] is beautiful. Read it. Nehemiah 8:1-3.
[3:03:03] Um I won't read it all, but let me go to
[3:03:05] verse three. And he read therein before
[3:03:06] the street that was before the Watergate
[3:03:08] from the morning until midday before the
[3:03:10] men and the women and those that could
[3:03:12] understand. And the ears of all the
[3:03:13] people were attentive under the book of
[3:03:15] the law. Oh my. If we could get back to
[3:03:17] that place where the ears of all the
[3:03:19] people were attentive under the book of
[3:03:21] the law,
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; if we could somehow rewire our brains to
[3:03:26] have an attention span longer than 30
[3:03:28] seconds
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; so that we could care. And what we miss,
[3:03:32] if we had a burden, if we believed, if
[3:03:34] our lives were hanging on those words,
[3:03:37] if we truly believed that they were
[3:03:39] lifechanging and from the father, if we
[3:03:41] missed some of it, we would hear it
[3:03:43] again.
[3:03:49] because we wouldn't want to miss it. The
[3:03:51] the ears of all the people were
[3:03:53] attentive under the book of the law.
[3:03:54] Verse six, and Ezra blessed the Lord,
[3:03:56] the great God, and all the people
[3:03:57] answered, "Amen." Amen. With lifting up
[3:04:00] their hands, and they bowed their heads
[3:04:02] and worshiped the Lord with their faces
[3:04:04] to the ground as the law of God was
[3:04:07] re-established in the restored city
[3:04:10] walls
[3:04:11] of Jerusalem.
[3:04:13] And then he begins to speak to them
[3:04:15] about the commandments in chapter 10.
[3:04:17] And in in chapter 13, he said that we
[3:04:20] need a rest now. Now we need a rest now.
[3:04:23] We need to remember the Sabbath. Now
[3:04:25] we've worked ourselves to the ground.
[3:04:27] Now we need to go back and remember that
[3:04:29] God instituted a time of rest and we
[3:04:33] need to take that because the hour has
[3:04:35] been hard and the and it's taken a toll
[3:04:38] on our minds and our bodies. And uh let
[3:04:41] me remind you that God never gave a
[3:04:43] Sabbath rest to make people slaves to a
[3:04:46] Sabbath. He gave rest to refresh and to
[3:04:49] renew the body
[3:04:52] &gt;&gt; so that you could go forward and
[3:04:53] dedicate and consecrate with a new zeal
[3:04:56] and and health.
[3:05:00] We're not even healthy enough to win
[3:05:02] this thing.
[3:05:04] If it was a physical if if if it was a
[3:05:06] physical requirement,
[3:05:09] very few of us,
[3:05:15] somebody said, "Well, I'm not
[3:05:16] overweight. It's not all just about the
[3:05:19] scale.
[3:05:23] It's about spaghetti noodles for arms
[3:05:25] and legs.
[3:05:29] It's about endurance."
[3:05:32] Nehemiah stands out in scripture as a
[3:05:34] model of godly leadership, action, and
[3:05:36] prayer. A reformer who feared God more
[3:05:38] than man. One who was determined.
[3:05:42] I don't care if the people
[3:05:43] misunderstand. I don't care if they
[3:05:46] don't get it. I don't care if they print
[3:05:49] about it. I don't care if
[3:05:52] I get an email this morning. I get them
[3:05:56] from this guy all the time.
[3:05:59] I told you about the book that was just
[3:06:02] recently written about me by the chief
[3:06:04] apostle in the message from somewhere.
[3:06:10] A whole book. I thought those days were
[3:06:13] over that I made any any any ripples big
[3:06:16] enough to write books about.
[3:06:19] And then I get an email today. At least
[3:06:21] this guy calls me Mr. Shelly. He's
[3:06:23] undressing all the other men that he can
[3:06:26] think of by name. I'm going to have to
[3:06:27] call names. And this it goes out all
[3:06:29] preachers, a lot of lot of places. And
[3:06:31] he said, "Then you've got Mr. Shelly who
[3:06:33] wants to take us all back to Pentecost."
[3:06:36] Listen, I do. But not a denomination,
[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; not a feeling, not a goosebump,
[3:06:44] not a jump, not a shout, not a holler,
[3:06:47] but I want to take us back to the fire
[3:06:50] that once burned out the sin. the fire
[3:06:53] that once consecrated and dedicated us
[3:06:56] in such a way that we could win the
[3:06:58] battle of the mind because the fire of
[3:07:00] God burned within our hearts.
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; And if in the process of that we get a
[3:07:03] little joy, I like joy. Don't you?
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; And if if after we get what we need on
[3:07:08] the inside, if a little feeling comes
[3:07:10] along with it,
[3:07:12] &gt;&gt; I'm all right with that, too.
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; I am.
[3:07:17] &gt;&gt; Because if it's got any life to it, it's
[3:07:19] going to have a little feeling to it
[3:07:21] somewhere. But you just can't fight the
[3:07:23] enemy with a feeling.
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't God good?
[3:07:27] &gt;&gt; Musicians are coming. Today, Sister
[3:07:28] Rhonda Shaw's birthday. Tell her happy
[3:07:30] birthday.
[3:07:32] [Applause]
[3:07:35] Tuesday is brother Greg May's Gregory
[3:07:37] May's birthday and we send birthday
[3:07:40] greetings to him. It's also sister Tana
[3:07:42] Waller uh in in uh on the west coast out
[3:07:46] in in is it Oregon? In Oregon. And uh it
[3:07:50] would have been brother and sister
[3:07:52] Williams's wedding anniversary. This
[3:07:53] coming Tuesday, July 29th. Thursday,
[3:07:57] July 31st is the Hollowell anniversary.
[3:08:00] So we say happy anniversary to them. And
[3:08:02] and maybe somebody would just wouldn't
[3:08:04] care if we just skip right over Friday.
[3:08:06] But Friday, August the 1st is the
[3:08:08] birthday of our sister Joyce Greley. So
[3:08:11] we want to make sure that we wish her a
[3:08:13] very happy birthday. And Saturday is
[3:08:19] sure
[3:08:20] we have we have plenty of time now.
[3:08:24] We do.
[3:08:28] We could just have a a great time here
[3:08:30] now. The the work's done. The burden's
[3:08:32] off for a few minutes. Uh Saturday is
[3:08:36] brother Shane Minko's birthday. Happy
[3:08:39] birthday to him. and we'll get a chance
[3:08:40] to tell him.
[3:08:45] And if our precious deacon would have
[3:08:46] been alive, if Brother West was still
[3:08:49] with us, it would have been his 89th
[3:08:52] birthday this coming Saturday.
[3:08:55] The season of the Dire Straits doesn't
[3:08:57] end until August the 3. And we have
[3:09:00] fellowship meeting Saturday, August the
[3:09:02] 2nd, 6 o'clock. Sunday,
[3:09:06] August the 2nd, the 3rd, excuse me, at
[3:09:09] 11:00 a.m. This Saturday night, this
[3:09:13] Sunday morning, we have a fellowship
[3:09:15] meeting. We know that there are a few
[3:09:17] people coming from different places.
[3:09:20] More than anything else, we want the
[3:09:21] Holy Spirit to come
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; and have his way. Can we stand together?
[3:09:46] King Jesus,
[3:09:48] we love you, Lord.
[3:09:58] Maybe you could just give them an idea
[3:10:00] of what you're going to sing, son. And
[3:10:02] and uh they could just start playing it
[3:10:05] soft before we begin to worship the
[3:10:07] Lord.
[3:10:09] Sister Ginger has asked that if there
[3:10:11] was time, like I said, we got plenty of
[3:10:13] time now,
[3:10:15] we would would pray for her and
[3:10:18] for Olivia
[3:10:20] as they make their way to Iceland.
[3:10:24] before our meetings this weekend
[3:10:29] that God would uh
[3:10:31] give them a special time
[3:10:34] and uh
[3:10:37] Olivia's getting a chance of a lifetime.
[3:10:41] A lot of jealous folks
[3:10:44] because Iceland is beautiful.
[3:10:47] But she's got some pretty amazing
[3:10:49] friends here and I'm pretty amazing
[3:10:53] and she's going to miss us.
[3:10:55] So, we're going to pray that the Lord
[3:10:57] will give her great grace,
[3:11:00] lots of fun
[3:11:02] and that she'll come home appreciating
[3:11:05] her friends more than ever before. And
[3:11:09] if I understand correctly, Brother
[3:11:10] Magnus will come back with them and
[3:11:12] it'll be camp meeting time before we see
[3:11:14] them nearly. So we want to we want to do
[3:11:17] that before we go.
[3:11:20] Lord Jesus,
[3:11:31] you're God's sovereign and God supreme.
[3:11:35] And we love you dearly, Lord.
[3:11:39] All we desire is to do, to be,
[3:11:43] all that you call us, all that you've
[3:11:45] purposed for us. We fail. We fail daily.
[3:11:50] But we don't leave this place in
[3:11:53] condemnation
[3:11:55] because we know, Lord, that your grace
[3:11:57] is sufficient for every one of our
[3:12:00] shortcomings.
[3:12:02] But we do reach up to receive the call
[3:12:05] of correction and inspiration. And we
[3:12:07] say, "Lord, help us to climb up a little
[3:12:10] higher, to take your word a little more
[3:12:13] serious than before.
[3:12:16] Set an example even in our own homes.
[3:12:19] That your word is hallowed, sanctified,
[3:12:21] and sacred.
[3:12:23] And that what we say and do matters."
[3:12:26] Oh God, may we draw our children, our
[3:12:28] grandchildren
[3:12:30] up under us in this hour and lead by
[3:12:33] example.
[3:12:36] So vitally important that they,
[3:12:38] especially as some of us get older, it's
[3:12:41] vitally important that they take the
[3:12:43] baton
[3:12:44] and that they raise up in this hour and
[3:12:47] get ready for what you're going to do in
[3:12:49] the closing hours of time
[3:12:55] and all the ways that we have let them
[3:12:56] down. Forgive us.
[3:13:01] have mercy on us.
[3:13:06] Give us another opportunity
[3:13:10] to raise up the banner.
[3:13:13] Lift high the standard of your word.
[3:13:26] &gt;&gt; May we remember that to be separate
[3:13:32] It's just as important what we have been
[3:13:35] separated unto
[3:13:39] as what we have been separated from.
[3:13:43] You have called us from the world, from
[3:13:46] confusion, from legalistic phariseism,
[3:13:52] but you have called us, sanctified us
[3:13:56] unto the life
[3:13:58] of Jesus Christ.
[3:14:04] May that life pulsate
[3:14:07] in our inner man
[3:14:10] until even the outward failing body is
[3:14:14] quickened
[3:14:16] &gt;&gt; by the life within and healing and
[3:14:19] restoration of divine health begins to
[3:14:22] set up in us.
[3:14:24] Forgive us for our mourning and our
[3:14:26] moaning.
[3:14:30] And may we not try to get out from under
[3:14:32] the commission or the call.
[3:14:35] May we just pray for grace and strength
[3:14:37] to finish the job.
[3:14:40] It's easy to check out. It would be easy
[3:14:42] to say, "Come get us, Lord."
[3:14:45] But we desire to stay and help this
[3:14:47] younger generation to finish,
[3:14:50] &gt;&gt; to finish well, to finish holy.
[3:14:55] so that we might rule and reign
[3:15:00] judge and sit with you in your throne
[3:15:03] even as you have sat down with your
[3:15:05] father in his throne.
[3:15:08] Thank you for calling us to be
[3:15:10] overcomers.
[3:15:12] &gt;&gt; And part of our highest commission is
[3:15:14] true praise and worship.
[3:15:17] You alone are worthy, Jesus.
[3:15:24] You are not a god
[3:15:27] [Music]
[3:15:29] by human hands. You are not a god
[3:15:34] dependent
[3:15:36] on any mortal man.
[3:15:39] You are not a god in need of
[3:15:44] anything we can give by your plan.
[3:15:50] That's just the way it is.
[3:15:55] [Music]
[3:15:56] You are not a god created
[3:16:01] by human.
[3:16:04] You are not a god depending
[3:16:08] on any mortal man. You are not a god in
[3:16:14] need of
[3:16:16] anything we can give by your plan.
[3:16:22] That's just the way it is.
[3:16:26] You are God alone
[3:16:29] from before time began.
[3:16:33] Oh, you are on your throne
[3:16:36] and you are God alone.
[3:16:41] And right now in the good times in bad.
[3:16:47] Oh, you are on your throne.
[3:16:51] You are God alone.
[3:16:54] Oh, you are God alone
[3:16:58] from before time be.
[3:17:02] Oh, you are on your throne.
[3:17:05] Yes, you are God alone.
[3:17:10] And right now, oh, in the good times and
[3:17:15] bad,
[3:17:17] you are on your throne. Yes, you are God
[3:17:22] alone.
[3:17:26] And you're the only God whose power
[3:17:31] none can contain. And you're the only
[3:17:35] God whose name.
[3:17:38] Praise will never end. You're the only
[3:17:42] God who's worthy
[3:17:45] of everything we can give.
[3:17:49] God, and that's just the way it is.
[3:17:55] You are God alone.
[3:17:59] Time begin.
[3:18:02] You are on your throne.
[3:18:05] You are God alone.
[3:18:09] And right now, oh the good times
[3:18:14] tonight,
[3:18:15] God, you are on your throne. Yes, you
[3:18:20] are God. Oh. Oh, you are God alone
[3:18:26] from before time began.
[3:18:29] Oh, you are on your throne. Yes, you are
[3:18:34] God alone.
[3:18:37] Oh, and right now, oh, in the good times
[3:18:42] and bad,
[3:18:44] you are on your own.
[3:18:48] You are gone.
[3:18:51] Oh, you're unchangeable.
[3:18:53] [Music]
[3:18:56] Unchangeable
[3:18:58] and you're unstoppable. Oh, God. And
[3:19:02] that's who you are.
[3:19:05] Oh, you're unchangeable
[3:19:09] and unchangeable.
[3:19:12] My God, you're unstoppable.
[3:19:16] That's who you are.
[3:19:19] Oh, you're unchangeable.
[3:19:21] [Music]
[3:19:23] You're unchangeable
[3:19:26] in your arms. Oh my God, that's who you
[3:19:31] are.
[3:19:33] You are God alone
[3:19:36] from before time be.
[3:19:40] You are on your throne.
[3:19:43] You are gone old
[3:19:47] and right now in the good times in bed.
[3:19:54] You are on your throne.
[3:19:57] You are God alone
[3:20:00] and you are God alone.
[3:20:03] From before time be
[3:20:08] you are on your throne
[3:20:11] and you are God alone.
[3:20:15] And right now in the good times in bad
[3:20:21] you are on your throne.
[3:20:25] You are God alone.
[3:20:28] You are God alone
[3:20:31] from before time be.
[3:20:35] You are on your throne.
[3:20:39] You are God.
[3:20:43] And right now
[3:20:45] in the good times in bad
[3:20:49] you are on your throne.
[3:20:53] You are God alone.
[3:20:57] You're unchangeable.
[3:21:01] Unshakeable.
[3:21:04] You're unstoppable.
[3:21:07] That's who you are.
[3:21:11] You're unchangeable.
[3:21:15] &gt;&gt; Unshakeable.
[3:21:18] &gt;&gt; You're unstoppable.
[3:21:22] That's who you are.
[3:21:25] You're unchangeable
[3:21:29] and unshakeable.
[3:21:32] Oh, you're unstoppable.
[3:21:36] That's who you are.

[3:21:43] and unshakeable
[3:21:46] and you're Oh my God, that's who you
[3:21:51] are.

[3:21:57] and unshakeable.
[3:22:00] You're un Oh my God, that's who you are.
[3:22:06] You're unchangeable
[3:22:10] and unshakeable
[3:22:13] and unstoppable.
[3:22:16] That's who you are.
[3:22:20] You are God alone. Before
[3:22:24] time begin,
[3:22:27] you are on your throne.
[3:22:30] You are God.
[3:22:34] And right now in the good times and bad,
[3:22:40] you are on your throne.
[3:22:44] You are God alone.
[3:22:47] You are God alone.
[3:22:50] From before time began,
[3:22:54] you were on your throne
[3:22:58] and you are God.
[3:23:02] And right now in the good times and bad,
[3:23:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[3:23:09] &gt;&gt; you are on your throne.
[3:23:11] &gt;&gt; You are still on your throne.
[3:23:12] &gt;&gt; You are God.
[3:23:14] &gt;&gt; You are still on your throne.
[3:23:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus, we bless your name. Yes.
[3:23:20] &gt;&gt; Would you just spread your hands out
[3:23:21] before the Lord and tell him your way is
[3:23:24] the right way.
[3:23:27] &gt;&gt; You've loved us with a love that we
[3:23:29] desire
[3:23:31] to be filled with and to love others
[3:23:34] with.
[3:23:36] &gt;&gt; We believe we believe in the word. We
[3:23:40] believe in a word that says that perfect
[3:23:43] love will reign in our lives.
[3:23:48] We believe that we'll never
[3:23:51] take a rapture without it.
[3:23:56] &gt;&gt; In our human logic, we we don't know how
[3:24:00] to get it or
[3:24:02] how to practice it, but we
[3:24:06] surrender ourselves to a sovereign God.
[3:24:10] &gt;&gt; We receive that perfect love from you,
[3:24:13] and we ask for grace.
[3:24:17] to love others with that love.
[3:24:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that every person in
[3:24:23] this room has the potential that you
[3:24:26] have placed in them to overcome the
[3:24:28] spirit of this age.
[3:24:32] I know that it has been said that every
[3:24:35] church is filled
[3:24:38] with three kinds of believers.
[3:24:42] But if I looked across this house today,
[3:24:44] I would find it very difficult
[3:24:48] to identify unbelievers.
[3:24:52] I believe Lord that most of us believe.
[3:24:57] Maybe we don't always let our lives
[3:24:59] measure up to what we believe and that
[3:25:01] makes us
[3:25:03] those who struggle in the in the realm
[3:25:06] of make believe.
[3:25:08] You said you were going to deal first
[3:25:10] with hypocrisy and your bride.
[3:25:15] One of the definitions of hypocrisy is
[3:25:18] to expect from others
[3:25:21] what we ourselves are not willing to be
[3:25:25] to live to do.
[3:25:29] Father help us.
[3:25:32] This is not who we desire to be.
[3:25:36] fill each one with an overcoming portion
[3:25:39] of who you are
[3:25:41] that we might have strength, Lord, until
[3:25:43] the hour that we could perhaps build in
[3:25:45] the day and watch in the night. May we
[3:25:48] pick up a sword in one hand and a tool
[3:25:50] in the other. And may we build while we
[3:25:53] fight and fight while we build, beating
[3:25:56] back the darkness, beating back the
[3:25:58] forces of hell that march against our
[3:26:01] families, against our heritage.
[3:26:07] and strength to build what has crumbled
[3:26:12] what the enemy has.
[3:26:14] He knew that if he could crumble the
[3:26:17] walls
[3:26:20] that he had us.
[3:26:22] May we raise up today to restore, to
[3:26:25] rebuild. May we arise and build. May we
[3:26:27] hear the call.
[3:26:30] May we stand shouldertosh shoulder not
[3:26:33] desiring that anybody would get out or
[3:26:35] be out but that everyone would be in
[3:26:39] &gt;&gt; that we could fight this thing together.
[3:26:41] Your grace is sufficient. I'm so glad.
[3:26:43] I'm glad Lord that at the end of the day
[3:26:46] it doesn't depend on our ability to do
[3:26:48] anything
[3:26:49] &gt;&gt; except yield.
[3:26:52] You're the one who comes to do it all in
[3:26:55] us. Strengthen us. May we strengthen our
[3:26:58] hands to both build and fight.
[3:27:02] May we push forward with everything
[3:27:03] that's within us, defeating the enemy,
[3:27:06] lifting one another up. If we see our
[3:27:08] brother or sister falling, may we offer
[3:27:10] a hand of support and compassion. May we
[3:27:13] not pity the spirit that's overtaken
[3:27:16] them, but may we go tell Jesus about it
[3:27:20] and not others.
[3:27:29] May what we have casually considered
[3:27:32] become a driving burden in passion in
[3:27:35] our lives.
[3:27:38] Be first, Jesus. Be first. May we wake
[3:27:41] up every morning desiring to make you
[3:27:43] first.
[3:27:48] Some dear friends of ours received some
[3:27:51] very devastating news this week
[3:27:53] concerning their son. I don't know that
[3:27:56] I have permission to call their name or
[3:27:59] his name, but they have experienced a
[3:28:02] great tragedy in their family already
[3:28:07] of losing a son, a dear son. And now
[3:28:11] they have a son who has been diagnosed
[3:28:13] as having a a brain tumor.
[3:28:16] We are believing that God is the same.
[3:28:19] &gt;&gt; The healer of the 50s and 60s, the
[3:28:22] healer of of Galilee,
[3:28:26] &gt;&gt; the healer of the New Testament is is
[3:28:28] Jehovah Rafa, our healer today. And
[3:28:31] we're going to lift up this young man to
[3:28:34] the Lord that he would receive healing.
[3:28:38] That it would not be such a long
[3:28:41] process. that it would not be Lord, we
[3:28:44] would desire that it would not be
[3:28:46] cancerous
[3:28:47] and that it be something that can either
[3:28:50] be treated or better than that
[3:28:53] disappear.
[3:28:56] &gt;&gt; But we want the little family to be
[3:28:57] lifted up and they have certainly stood
[3:29:00] with us and we want to see God move on
[3:29:03] their behalf. I want you to also as you
[3:29:06] leave today to remember Sister Sharon
[3:29:08] who expected to be here today but just
[3:29:11] was really uh ill and needed a touch
[3:29:14] from the Lord.
[3:29:16] We know that God is more than able. Our
[3:29:18] dear sister Audrey fights every day in
[3:29:21] great pain. She needs healing and
[3:29:23] deliverance
[3:29:24] from all that infirmity so that she can
[3:29:27] do it. I I long again one more time see
[3:29:30] her walk across the front of this church
[3:29:32] shouting with victory in her heart.
[3:29:34] Inspired me many many many times as her
[3:29:37] mother did before her. Inspired me their
[3:29:40] their joy and their liberty inspired my
[3:29:43] heart. May God touch sister Audrey today
[3:29:47] and give her victory. Lord, we lift up
[3:29:50] these needs of healing. And I'm sure
[3:29:52] there are others represented in this
[3:29:54] room who need healing as well. We just
[3:29:57] want to say before the God of heaven
[3:30:00] that we know you're the same
[3:30:02] &gt;&gt; and we know that it's such a small thing
[3:30:06] to us. It becomes so large that we don't
[3:30:09] even know how sometime to present our
[3:30:11] petition. But Lord, to you it's just a
[3:30:14] very simple thing. It's part of the
[3:30:16] atonement.
[3:30:18] &gt;&gt; And according to your will and divine
[3:30:20] purpose, you're more than able. Lord,
[3:30:22] you wouldn't even have to come. Just
[3:30:24] speak the word.
[3:30:26] Oh God, you wouldn't even have to point
[3:30:29] a finger. Just speak the word and we
[3:30:32] could receive our healing
[3:30:34] &gt;&gt; and the restoration of health
[3:30:36] &gt;&gt; that comes from you. We lift up this
[3:30:38] brother and his family to the Lord.
[3:30:43] &gt;&gt; That you would work again your miracle
[3:30:45] working power.
[3:30:48] &gt;&gt; There's no limitation.
[3:30:50] A tumor is no more than anything else.
[3:30:54] When you are on the case,
[3:30:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, would you get a testimony for your
[3:31:01] name out of this situation?
[3:31:05] &gt;&gt; I ask with humble heart but great faith,
[3:31:09] knowing that you're more than able
[3:31:12] and for others.
[3:31:17] &gt;&gt; We pray for one another right now. this
[3:31:19] beautiful body.
[3:31:24] Fill us all
[3:31:26] with more of you.
[3:31:30] Grace to help each other.
[3:31:32] Maybe you want to just
[3:31:34] touch someone.
[3:31:38] You're not taking a superior spiritual
[3:31:40] role.
[3:31:41] I'm not asking you to pray some
[3:31:43] prophetic word over them. I'm just
[3:31:45] asking you to join your faith with
[3:31:46] theirs.
[3:31:47] I join my faith with the one next to me
[3:31:49] now.
[3:31:51] We stand in the presence of God
[3:31:53] determined to be more
[3:31:56] than we've ever been before.
[3:32:00] Oh God, the walls. We see the walls. We
[3:32:02] see the condition of many things.
[3:32:07] We see another generation coming along,
[3:32:09] Lord, that just they don't they don't
[3:32:12] even hardly know. They don't hardly see.
[3:32:15] May they see what we've seen.
[3:32:18] May they see the pillar of fire moving
[3:32:20] among us.
[3:32:22] May they see a sold out
[3:32:27] prayer waring church
[3:32:30] so that they can take up
[3:32:32] the banner, the responsibility,
[3:32:36] run it forward.
[3:32:40] Lord, if I've allowed my mind or my
[3:32:42] mouth
[3:32:45] to speak against a a person, a family, a
[3:32:49] person in this body,
[3:32:51] instead of praying for them, we ask that
[3:32:54] you would forgive us and help us, Lord.
[3:32:55] May we build one another up in prayer.
[3:33:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[3:33:08] May we be faithful in all that you've
[3:33:10] called us to
[3:33:21] now as we need to go. Let's have
[3:33:25] sister Ginger and uh
[3:33:27] Olivia to come and stand here and let's
[3:33:30] gather around them. Brother Gley,
[3:33:33] you go for me, would you?
[3:33:36] and let's well you
[3:33:42] and lay hands on them
[3:33:44] and and uh I mean you know for us it
[3:33:47] it's looks like a glorious vacation. I
[3:33:51] wish somebody was sending me out of the
[3:33:52] country for that long.
[3:33:54] But there are other circumstances
[3:33:59] and Olivia's just seeming to pip out of
[3:34:02] her shell and we just we just hate to
[3:34:05] lose any ground because we can't hardly
[3:34:08] wait to see just who she'll be as she
[3:34:12] just pushes herself. If you have to
[3:34:14] sometime you you you do have to break
[3:34:16] out and push yourself a little out of
[3:34:18] your comfort zone so you'll even begin
[3:34:20] to know who you are in Christ.
[3:34:23] But let's surround them right now in
[3:34:26] prayer. Father, we we just stretch our
[3:34:31] faith toward them
[3:34:34] and these are precious among us.
[3:34:38] [Music]
[3:34:39] I saw the sweet pictures of Olivia when
[3:34:42] she was so small,
[3:34:46] so little,
[3:34:48] so broken.
[3:34:52] We thank you, Lord, for the courage
[3:34:56] Ginger had to take this journey. Amen.
[3:35:02] We just pray, oh God, that you will
[3:35:05] bless that little family
[3:35:08] as you've given
[3:35:10] Ginger to Brother Magnus and Magnus to
[3:35:14] Ginger and
[3:35:16] you've given Olivia first to Ginger and
[3:35:20] now to brother Magnus and they make this
[3:35:24] small but powerful little family.
[3:35:28] And we ask, oh God, that during this
[3:35:31] time,
[3:35:35] you will minister.
[3:35:38] Help them to bind together and know one
[3:35:41] another even in deeper ways.
[3:35:45] Each one just stepping up
[3:35:50] &gt;&gt; to be their role, their active role in
[3:35:54] the family.
[3:35:56] I'm not going to ask you to
[3:35:59] make Olivia not miss any of us or Ginger
[3:36:02] either, but I'm going to ask that your
[3:36:04] peace will be so real and that her
[3:36:07] friends and contacts won't forsake her
[3:36:11] that they'll reach out and stay in touch
[3:36:14] and you'll just bless them in this time
[3:36:17] and bring them back not uh starving but
[3:36:21] uh bring them back filled and ready for
[3:36:24] what you
[3:36:26] have appointed for us at tabernacles
[3:36:29] time.
[3:36:32] Bless them real good. Bless brother
[3:36:34] Magnus.
[3:36:36] He still has many responsibilities.
[3:36:40] Touch his body physically in every way.
[3:36:42] And continue, Lord, to give him
[3:36:46] amazing plans.
[3:36:54] Oh, how you've used him.
[3:36:57] We honor that and ask even for increase
[3:37:01] upon his life.
[3:37:04] May he know the joy, the real joy of a
[3:37:07] sweet little family.
[3:37:10] And may it bring extra strength to him
[3:37:12] in these days.
[3:37:15] And we praise you for your faithfulness
[3:37:17] to us.
[3:37:19] You're more faithful than we could ever
[3:37:21] be. But Lord, help us to also be
[3:37:24] faithful in all things.
[3:37:31] &gt;&gt; Let it be said.
[3:37:34] Sing that.
[3:37:36] [Music]
[3:37:38] &gt;&gt; You sisters, take an opportunity to
[3:37:41] squeeze them real tight.
[3:37:42] &gt;&gt; It's Christ alone.
[3:37:46] In Christ alone will I glory. Though I
[3:37:51] would know I could pride myself in
[3:37:54] battles.
[3:37:56] &gt;&gt; Sing as we get ready to go.
[3:37:58] &gt;&gt; For I've been blessed
[3:38:00] &gt;&gt; beyond measure.
[3:38:01] &gt;&gt; Blessed
[3:38:02] &gt;&gt; and by his strength alone I over.
[3:38:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:38:11] &gt;&gt; I could stop and count successes
[3:38:15] like diamonds in
[3:38:18] my hands.
[3:38:21] But those trophies could not equal to
[3:38:25] the grace
[3:38:28] by which I stand
[3:38:32] in Christ
[3:38:33] alone.
[3:38:35] I place my trust
[3:38:39] and find my glory in the power of the
[3:38:45] cross.
[3:38:47] And let it be said in every victory.
[3:38:51] Let it be said of me that my source of
[3:38:56] strength. Lord, you are my source of
[3:39:00] hope
[3:39:02] is Christ alone.
[3:39:05] again.
[3:39:06] &gt;&gt; In Christ alone,
[3:39:09] I place all my trust and I find my glory
[3:39:16] in the power of the cross.
[3:39:21] In every victory,
[3:39:25] let it be said, I'll be my source of
[3:39:30] strength. Lord, you are my source of all
[3:39:36] is Christ alone.
[3:39:39] In Christ alone will I glory.
[3:39:44] For only by his grace I am redeemed.
[3:39:51] And only his tender mercy
[3:39:55] could reach beyond my weakness to my
[3:40:00] knees.
[3:40:01] [Music]
[3:40:03] And now
[3:40:05] I seek no greater honor
[3:40:09] than just to know him more
[3:40:14] than to count my gains but losses
[3:40:18] to the glory
[3:40:21] of my Lord.
[3:40:24] In Christ alone,
[3:40:28] I place my trust
[3:40:32] &gt;&gt; and find my glory in the power of the
[3:40:37] cross
[3:40:40] in every victory.
[3:40:43] Lord, let it be said of me that my
[3:40:48] source of strength. God, you are my
[3:40:52] source of hope
[3:40:54] is Christ alone.
[3:40:58] In Christ alone
[3:41:01] I place all my trust and I find my glory
[3:41:08] in the power of the cross,
[3:41:13] in every victory.
[3:41:16] Lord, let it be said of me that my
[3:41:21] source of strength.
[3:41:24] You are my source of hope
[3:41:27] is Christ alone.
[3:41:35] &gt;&gt; Christ alone will I glory
[3:41:40] &gt;&gt; though I could pride myself in battles.
[3:41:45] Oh yes.
[3:41:46] &gt;&gt; For I've been blessed beyond measure
[3:41:51] and by his strength alone I overcome.
[3:41:58] And oh I could stop and count successes
[3:42:04] like diamonds in
[3:42:06] my hands.
[3:42:09] But those trophies could not equal to
[3:42:13] the grace
[3:42:16] by which I stand.
[3:42:20] In Christ alone,
[3:42:23] I place my trust
[3:42:27] and I find my glory in the power of the
[3:42:33] cross,
[3:42:35] in every victory.
[3:42:38] Lord, let it be said of me that my
[3:42:44] source of strength. Oh my God, you are
[3:42:47] my source of hope
[3:42:50] is Christ alone.
[3:42:54] In Christ alone,
[3:42:57] I place all my trust and I find my glory
[3:43:03] in the power of the cross.
[3:43:08] In every victory,
[3:43:12] Lord, let it be said of me that my
[3:43:17] source of strength, my God, you are my
[3:43:21] source of hope
[3:43:24] is Christ alone.
[3:43:27] In Christ alone
[3:43:31] I place my trust
[3:43:35] and find my glory in the power of the
[3:43:41] cross
[3:43:43] in every victory.
[3:43:47] Let it be said of me. And my source of
[3:43:53] strength
[3:43:55] and my source of hope
[3:43:58] is Christ alone. Sing it one last time
[3:44:02] like that. In Christ alone,
[3:44:07] I place my trust
[3:44:11] and find my glory in the power of the
[3:44:17] cross.
[3:44:20] In every victory,
[3:44:24] Lord, let it be said of me. My source of
[3:44:30] strength,
[3:44:32] my source of hope
[3:44:36] in Christ
[3:44:38] alone.
