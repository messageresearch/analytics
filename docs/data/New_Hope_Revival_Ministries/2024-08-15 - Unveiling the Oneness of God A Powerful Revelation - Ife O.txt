Description:
In this powerful message, Pastor Shelley emphasizes the truth about the oneness of God, challenging religious misconceptions and highlighting the profound revelation that Jesus Christ is the embodiment of God in the flesh. Pastor Shelley confronts religious leaders who failed to recognize the Messiah when He walked among them, calling out their hypocrisy and spiritual blindness. He passionately defends the unity of God, explaining the different manifestations of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct offices of the same divine being. With bold declarations, Pastor Shelley affirms that Jesus is alive and active in His church today, not just a historical figure but a living reality in the lives of believers.
