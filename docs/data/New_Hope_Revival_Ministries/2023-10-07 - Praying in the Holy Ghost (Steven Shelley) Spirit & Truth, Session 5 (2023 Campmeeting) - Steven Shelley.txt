our way and we probably like 2 and 1 half hours away or something on that line when uh going down the street the front wheel hit the curb on the side because of it hit it I guess and so we got out of there and we're kept moving we're a little concerned about the wheel and the tire and so Force but it seemed okay until maybe 15 to 30 minutes later the light blinged on the car and uh Andy saw the transmission went out so we pulled to the side and then uh we didn't stop the engine he discovered that he had a had the uh he still had low gear so we kept going down the road at probably 25 miles an hour for a while and started calling around to try to figure out how we can rent a car and all the stuff and uh Andy hasn't been driving very long we're not very experienced with knowing what to do about these things but we were praying and we called the brothers here and they were praying and then all of a sudden brother Chie said well let's just pull off to the side here beside this semi-trailer and we pulled in there and then chess said just stop that engine we've been overrunning it for a while let's just let it cool down a little bit and we were calling around to get a car rle

something about being in the presence of God nothing like it nothing like it the song they're singing talking about having to testify I can't help but testify how could how could I can't help but testify of what God's done for me and I I I'll try to make it very quick yeah but I know but the word takes preeminence amen many of you have have seen I'm sure well maybe some of you have seen the testimony that Heather gave on Facebook regarding little milela our little baby girl that's on the way that's an entire miracle in and of itself that the doctor said would never happen we don't listen to the report that the doctors give my God gives a much better report than what the doctors could ever give so God blessed us with this pregnancy and as as the as they do about Midway through the pregnancy about 20 weeks they do an ultrasound to check on the baby's growth make sure everything is is growing right and doing right we went into that ultrasound room with the expectation that everything was going to be perfect and the lady that was doing all the checking she just kept making good comments everything oh this looks good this looks good this looks good so then we go into the office to speak to the doctor and he comes in and he's like um so uh did the technician say anything we're like oh yeah she just said every everything looked really good he said oh yeah everything looks really good but I don't like hearing a doctor say but when they're reviewing something he says we didn't notice one little thing that she only has a two vessel umbilical Cordon if you know anything about life how it grows there supposed to be a three vessel I wonder what it is about three there should be three vessels for the cord for the for the correct proper growth and they said well we've checked we've checked checked all the things and she only has two and we want to just let you know that because she only has a two vessel cord here's a whole list of things that potentially could be might be possibly wrong when she's born and you may need to make some decisions about that I'm like well number one there's no decision I need to make about anything the baby's not born yet and I said and two we're going to take it to the Lord in prayer beautiful we're going to take it to God In Prayer I I said I appreciate all that you guys have done thank you for for the work that you are able to do and what you can see and we have we have a picture where of where they did the sonogram and the the ultrasound and they they shows a two vessel cord they said we're going to schedule you in a few weeks to go to a um a specialist that they can check even better than we can check they can and they they were wanting to look to see if there's any abnormalities things that would show any signs of anything else and we know that place um in our area they're very well known for they would just as soon talk to you about aborting a baby than they would of you bringing a baby to full term so all that's in our mind already I'm like I I really don't like that atmosphere I don't want to talk to them but we'll go but we went to our went to the church first and we prayed had our church pray put out a prayer request across Facebook and different different places and many people joined in prayer with us you guys even joined in prayer with with us so fast forward 3 and 1/2 weeks from the the first ultrasound we go to mayck and they go in and the lady starts checking everything out and she's doing all the checks and she's like oh the you know the skull looks good hands look good feet look good and we're like we want to hear about the cord that's what I want to hear and so the lady she's checking checking checking and she says now your chart says that you're here because they saw a two vessel cord W wowow we're like correct and we here's the here we have the picture they the doctors have it which we have a copy of it now and she said well that's what's funny she because I don't see a two vessel cord there's clearly a three vessel cord that's my God that's my [Applause] God people want to refer to a god that happened 200000 years ago it's the same God it ain't a different God I don't care what the doctors say I don't care what the need is that you have you take it to him you take him to his word where he has given you a promise you hold on to the promise you raise it up to him and say father you told me that this is what I could have by your stripes mil was healed so we went back to the first doctor this past week and Heather tells them we have a little change since the last time we were here because the other specialist has declared Mila is perfect and that she has a three vessel cord and they're like but our print shows and they pulled it up back on the screen pulled it up for and we we pulled a print out but it shows here and they're like was there any way that we can get a copy of of what they saw sure it's in it's in the documents you can

out of like brother said last night he was teaching but really that was I I I think there's got to be a word for that that that was teaching and a whole lot of preaching all combined seemed like I made up a word one time but that was so many years ago I forgot it but uh I am going to give the devil a black eye and uh I want you to know before you hear this that uh I am speaking to the Believers that are gathered here especially to the New Hope Revival Ministry people uh if you're streaming this I hope you will hear it and take it and uh consult your pastor about it and uh make sure that it is the order for your house I am not responsible for any church or the conduct of the church Church except this one that's right I believe that we are not a part of a denomination uh we are not a part of the voice of God play press play and Obey movement uh we are Bible Believers and we are so grateful and so thankful that God H has sent a prophet to tie together the loose end of all of the church ages um we don't know how you can call individual churches message churches without somehow forming some kind of a denominational idea so we don't really want to be a part of that we honor brother brandham with everything we've got but we we try to honor him by living the kind of life he preached about and we don't feel like we have to hang up his picture in here for you to remember who he is we feel like that when we come here we need to uh focus and concentrate on the one that he came to help us fall in love with the Revelation the unveiling the revealing the apocalypsis of the Lord Jesus Christ some of us are Pentecostal not by denomination but by birth by experience we're not ashamed of it we're not ashamed of jumping hooping hollering running dancing worshiping God and if you didn't know why before Ashley sung to you tonight that's why because nobody knows like we know where God brought us from tonight I want to entitle this the bride's Advantage her secret weapon yeah praying in the the Holy Ghost John 4 and verse 24 if you go there it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth it's a must brother it's a must it it's not an option it's a necessity amen yes sir have you all seen my tie not a us that's it brother in times like this it's good to be fire baptized Holiness and uh get rid of the tie I used to hear them preach that's a rattlesnake around your neck you ought to take that off that's full of Pride you know what I said amen amen I'm glad to be free Hallelujah God is a spirit and they that worship Him must must worship him the only kind of worship that he receives is the worship that is done in spirit and inth truth you believe that one more place before you're seated I'd like to read five verses in the book of Jude I apologize for the raspiness of my voice verses 20 through 25 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith would you all read that phrase say it again praying in the Holy Ghost what kind of praying in the Holy Ghost praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others Sav with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to prevent you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen did I mix up some verses or was that right good praise the Lord in the Amplified one verse that's verse 20 in the Amplified but you beloved build yourselves up huh build yourselves up founded on your Most Holy Faith make progress rise like an edifice higher and higher praying in the Holy Spirit now does that sound bad to you does that sound like something negative that you would want to edify that you would want to build yourself up by praying in the Holy Ghost does that sound like Pride to you pride is when we have ambition pride is when we draw attention to ourselves pride is when we like to have our ego stroked but there are there is a time there is an hour there is a moment when we need to build up ourselves we're waiting on somebody to encourage us when we have the weapon in our Arsenal right now pray in the Holy Ghost pray in the Holy Ghost that's our key that's the bride's advantage that's one of her secret weapons pray in the Holy Ghost now father come tonight and help us in your word I don't have strength or desire to drag anybody to an experience I just want you to speak to your people this evening I want to restore to them something that has been taken away from some of them I want them to understand that you have given us the gift of praying in the Holy Ghost and that we should take advantage of it every opportunity that we get it is to build up our faith it is to build up our courage it is to take us to higher Heights in the realm of the spirit and we need your help tonight to deliver this mandate strengthen your people I pray let your servant get out of the way and accomplish your will in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said you may be seated man is a spirit man is a spirit who has a soul I know I know I don't have time to ground that to apologize for believing that I don't have time for that tonight but man is a spirit who has been given a soul mind will and emotions and he happens to live in a physical body but he is first and foremost spirit because it took Spirit to give him the living Soul the Breath of God the ruak kodesh the very lifegiving Spirit of almighty God was breathed into a body of Flesh and God gave him Connection by his five senses to the environment around him but not only does your body have five senses that lead to the mind and the will and the emotions but even your spirit has been given senses that you might connect to the holy spirit of God Proverbs 20:27 says the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly do you believe that the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly that word belly means the innermost being it means the inner parts it means the inside of the inside it means your heart in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23 he said and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ brother brandham said I I cannot preach anything other than what the first church age messenger preached if he preached it that way I have to also preach it that way do you believe that there wasn't a new message for Leo deia there wasn't a new message for the last Church age it was actually the same message it was the tishbite anointing of weaving together all the lcins of all the other six Church ages brother brandom said that seventh angel he doesn't have a message of his own his job is to take everything back to the word if you let this message fit in the word you'll have a foundation to stand on if you can't take it back to the word you better leave it alone because the prophet told us that the word of God is the absolute you don't ever hear him saying like I said the other day when I was preaching the other day you know I told you such and such and such this is what a lot of us do but he very seldomly quoted himself what did he quote more than anything else the word the absolute the Bible so anything that we hear we have to take it back to the Bible nothing else stands alone is anybody with me tonight don't get too nervous we'll leave a few sacred cows upright we won't kick them all down tonight but we're going to work on a few of them all right because I'm pretty mad you know I don't get too mad too often but I'm pretty mad at the Devil because I believe that he has has taken something away from you brother mentioned the song the other night I'm going to the enemy's Camp some of you when you first got the Holy Ghost you prayed in the spirit you'd start praying in English and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord would start directing your prayer and you started praying still in English but prophetically inspired LED of the Holy Spirit prayers how many of you know they're the most effectual those that are that are Spirit breathed sometimes we come up with a gimme gimme list sometimes we treat God like Santa Claus we just say here's what I want this is my want list but you start praying in the spirit it doesn't have to always be in another language but it's all right if it is am anybody with me I'm going to tell you something I truly believe that if the Bride of Jesus Christ would fight her way back to the privilege of praying in the Holy Ghost I believe we could move more Mountains than we've been moving these last few years I think if we could get to the place where we're no longer afraid of spirit-led things and even if it means a language that we never learned but we started praying and the spirit of God be to give us a groaning or begins to give us a sound I I don't know how to explain it sometime intercession takes on so many different uh uh aspects and and you come around here when the spirit of God's moving you'll hear all kinds of thing oh somebody said oh somebody said Woo true we had a brother come here years ago from South Africa and he came to the first camp meeting that we ever had story too long to tell but you know what he'd do all the time when the spirit of God would move on him he'd say show brother show sister you know we don't understand that sometime we scratch our heads and we look at other people funny when they worship a little differently than we do or when they respond to the spirit of God a little different than we do but I want to tell you something it's time we find how to respond yours doesn't have to look like mine mine doesn't have to look like yours but we better get in some Holy Ghost prayer meetings now where the spirit of God begins to direct the priorities of prayer the directives of prayer should not be flesh Le not even soul Le should be led by the spirit because the Bible said in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 I hope you can stand the rest of this 1 Corinthians chapter 6:1 17 said but he that is joined unto the Lord is now one Spirit wo your Fallen Spirit has now been redeemed when you have you know the new birth is not complete until the baptism of the Holy Ghost some people think they're saved because they've repented and they think that is being born again or they get a little sanctification working in their life they call that the new birth but we've been taught from the word and the message of the hour that the new birth is not complete until you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then why AR people knocking folks down to get up here and get the Holy Ghost you've got to have it they're still arguing over whether or not that you need the Holy Ghost uh to to get to heaven or to go in Rapture brother that's no question there's no question there you need him to go to Walmart you need him to get behind the wheel of an automobile and meet all the demons behind the wheel come on you need him we need him we've got to have him and once we receive the Holy Ghost he didn't just come to give us a feeling he didn't just come to give us a goosebump or an emotion he came to equip us to fight the F greatest battle ever fought which is a battle of the mind and I'm here to tell you that I believe the best way to win that battle is to pray in the Holy Ghost it's not a selfish prayer when this I know my voice sounds terrible it's not a selfish prayer when the Holy Spirit is directing the prayer I don't want you to throw out any option it might be in English it might be a [Applause] sound right I long to hear the groanings I'll give you the verses I long to hear the groanings of the spirit I long to see the Holy Ghost falling like he fell on my grandmother my whole life and her lips would begin to murmur her lips would begin to tremble with stammering lips he said in Isaiah with stammering lips and another tongue I will speak to my people this is the refreshing this is the refreshing Hallelujah where with the weary shall find rest is that all right and we need that Isaiah 2811 and 12 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing huh could you help me yet they would not hear you know when we read that we say that's a Baptist that's the Methodist that's the denominations well it was directed to the Jews and guess what the Jew is you you're the Jew that it was directed to it's one new man now this will work for the bride of Christ so let's not blame the other denominations who don't want anything to do with the Holy Ghost let's look within let's look at this house let's look at these other churches that are represented that claim to believe the fullness of this message and you let somebody get a little stammering lip and they want an interpreter before they ever say anything the Deacon sometime will go around and say don't get to they sound like they're talking in some Hello I need a little help woo my lips are dry my tongue's dry my mouth's dry I need help this come on sister Flo thank you I long to see like my granny the spirit of God would fall on her I could tell her chin would be neither one of us have a chin you can't see my well it ain't there but you know how terrible how how without one I am if I didn't have whiskers you'd see neither one of us had a chin but she had she had a little cuter one than me with a little little dimple right there and the spirit of God would fall on her and I'd watch that little chin begin to move like that and the next thing you know her lips would begin to quiver and I knew that what was about to come out of her was a prayer that was going to shake the heavens and the earth I knew that the spirit of God was about to pray through my big mama I knew that everything was going to be all right because Big Mama knew how to pray in the Holy Ghost there was never any backsliding in her I never saw her drawn back to the things of the world you know why she learned how to pray in the Holy Ghost if you let God lead you to a spirit inspired prayer in English or in another language I'm telling you you won't find yourself in the throws of Despair you will not find yourself in the throws of discouragement because you will constantly be building up your spirit you'll be building up the inner man as the spirit of oh as the spirit of God flows through you today is the last day the great day of the feast today is the day that Mark shim Eric which leads us to uh simat tah the last day of the feast and the Bible said on the last day the great day the last day of the feast Jesus stood up brother gley mentioned it that's why we had said much more he mentioned it the first night that great water oblation ceremony that took place every day of seot all seven days and then on the eighth day that last day they would go all the way down to the pool of salom fill up those vessels March up Zion's hill with a parade by the way according to the talmud there were banners being waved there were torches being lit Flags waving in the air shouts of praise and joy resounded in the tents of the righteous of the Lord woo because they were about to give God thanks so that priest they would come in a procession with these vessels they would walk holy they would walk in unison holy unto the Lord beautiful beautiful pageantry they would walk up through the oel they would climb the southern steps of the Temple Mount they would make their way up to the to the platform where the temple sat they would go in and pour that water on the found foundation stone in total silence all the rejoicing took place on the way up but once they got there it was total silence because something holy was about to take place they're pouring the water of the pool of silim onto the foundation stone they are giving God thanks it's a Thanksgiving offering for the former Reign and the latter rain there was there might not even been any rain yet but what they're doing is thanking God for rain as if rain had already come how many of you know that's a good principle in your life you don't wait until it floods to thank God for the rain you thank Him in Advance you Praise Him in Advance how many of you have been praising him this week in advance for some things that he hasn't yet finished some things that he has started but he hasn't completed yet but you're not waiting until it's all completed to praise you're just praising him in advance you just letting the Holy Spirit have his way so that last day that last great day of the feast when everyone is silent Jesus just loved to interrupt religion yeah everywhere he went noise followed it it was really it got to be like a carnival when Jesus passed through the town because everybody he touched everybody he touched everybody he spoke to they experience Joy like they had never known before you tell me that this message has brought the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ and you can act starchier now than you did in Pentecost some of you baptized in titles you had more victory over there in titles then you do over here in the name something's wrong something's wrong you've let a preacher come along and tell you that because there's a fake tongue you've read where brother brandom mentions the false tongue and we have gotten so paranoid so afraid of the false tongue that we won't yield ourself to the genuine and I can hear the devil howling at us oh but they say we're we're not in the lips anymore well then preacher sit down shut up right CA we've heard from your lips about all we can handle I'm talking to myself come on if God's through with lips what's the preacher doing and remember that the lips is in the same head that the intellect is in on I'm I you some of you know where I'm at don't you you know the quotes you know what I'm talking about they say we're we're done with the lips we're now in the intellect age we now have a prophet who could read the minds and know by discernment the very thoughts of God and so we don't need anything any sign gifts we don't need anything that comes out of the lips and yet they preach and preach and preach and preach and preach out of their own intellect using their own lips while talking us out of our experience it's going to be quiet in here somebody ought to bust through somebody ought to make up their mind that you ought to have more over here in the fullness of the truth than you had over there in some Full Gospel Church [Applause] somewhere I see more moving of the spirit sometime in churches where they wear cargo shorts and ball caps somebody said that's the false Spirit that's not what brother random said he didn't call it a false Spirit he said it rains on the just and the unjust Hallelujah and if the tears have got enough sense to raise up their hand and say thank God for the rain why doesn't the we where is the seed where is the seed Hallelujah if the weeds can praise him why can't the [Applause] weed we must for they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth you don't substitute spirit for truth you don't substitute a holy ghost for a sermon you don't substitute Holy Ghost for a mystery revealed because without the Holy Ghost no mystery could be revealed and no mystery Revelation could be received we need him we need him we need him we need him I'm not done oh Hallelujah skip skip skip mark thank you brother Mark chapter 16 vers 15 16 through 18 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved is baptism important it is it is he that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved I don't believe that water baptism is the Regeneration necessary for salvation but I do believe that your obedience is necessary does someone have to be at baptized no but they should have a desire to obey and once you have a desire to obey there's water what prevent you from being baptized so he said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned elas come get a microphone will you I know I give it to you the other day and you and never used you did I and these signs and these signs shall follow them that believe well I was uh I was over there and I heard them talking about visions and I don't want anything to do with people who who follow signs somebody was up sharing their dream I don't want anything to do with dreams because I don't believe that we ought to follow dreams I don't believe we ought to follow Visions I don't believe we ought to follow I don't either I don't either I'm not doing what I do because I had a vision I had one but I'm not doing what I do because I had a vision I'm doing what I do because of what the word said and the word said if I will do what he CED me to do these signs these signs shall follow that's you know what you're going to have a big crowd following you around because we heard last night that surely goodness and mercy is going to follow you all the days of your life and now you are REM Ed that these signs shall follow them that believe so where you go don't be surprised if Supernatural doesn't follow you it won't just be goodness and mercy the Supernatural is going to go where you go and it will if we pray in the Holy Ghost you say now brother isn't this ABCs yes it it almost blows my mind that the spirit of God would call us in 2023 to preach something that every one of us should have learned in our Pentecostal Church it is a way it's a shame that we would have to take yet the spirit of God plac the burden of the Lord the burden of his word on and said I want you just to go and lay out for the people the necessity I'm not offering you an option of how to pray I'm telling you the way the bride's got to pray we've got to pray in the spirit we we're not standing before Santa Claus we're not standing before our mommies and our daddies we're standing before the god of the universe and the only language that he's honoring is the spirit language it may be English it may [Applause] be it may be H it may be skin a KNE come on but if the spirit is birthing it if the spirit is inspiring it if the spirit is drawing it out of you you better obey the [Music] lord well don't you think there has to be an interpreter present for someone to speak in tongues absolutely not I don't believe that for one second because I believe what the word said there are diverse kinds of tongues every tongue doesn't come as the gift of tongues if a tongue message is given as a gift of tongues there needs to be a gift of an interpreter present I got the scripture and says if if if the somebody gives it you know there's no interpretor pray pray that you receive the interpretation but all tongues are not messages in tongues oh you need a quote don't you I got it can you just preach in the word with me a few minutes and we'll put the cherry on the cake by giving you the quote later would it offend anybody if we just preach out of the prophets quotebook tonight come on would it offend you if we just take it back to the word for a little while tonight and then we'll come here at the end and tie it together with the message of the Hour come on he that believeth in his are you mad I'm not mad at anybody except the dumb devil I know Granny's every time I think of something like this I see a sister me too I I see one particular one do you see one every time I think like this I see could I call the name would it be wrong to call the name I see sister Bell from Canada and I remember the stories they told me about the move of God in her life in Pentecost how the spirit of God would pray through her and speak through her come on now what a powerful even being around her years later uh after meeting her in the message and many many many many others just like her you could feel just in her presence you could feel the spirit of the Lord but they tell me that that that in in the early days of her Pentecostal experience the spirit of God would move through her and pray through her she would give messages in tongues and they would be interpreted and my what a spirit what a spirit and I remember her standing before me one time and she said brother Shelly would you pray that God would restore to me what I let the preachers take from me would you pray that God will forgive me I was a poor Steward over my Holy Ghost baptism would you pray that God will forgive me and restore to me so that I can get lost so that in my kitchen I can get [Applause] lost I want to get lost in my kitchen in the Holy Ghost G my children are in trouble my grandchildren are in trouble I don't want to tell God how to do it I want the Holy Ghost to pray through me the mind of [Music] [Applause] God are you with me he that okay and these son shall follow them that believe read it for me I got to breathe these sign shall follow them that believe go in my name in my name shall they cast out Devils what they shall speak with new tongues oh wait a minute everybody talks with their tongue God wants to give you a new tongue when he fills you with the Holy Ghost he's going to clean up that tongue you're not going to talk the way you used to talk uh you're not going to use all the slang that the world uses you're not going to cuss you're not going to use euphemisms that mean cuss words you're not go call Jesus JC come you're going to be careful how you use the name of God it's a hallowed name when you say Jehovah or Yahweh or whatever you say Hashem which means the name you're not going to say it in vain in anger or for jesting when you call on him you're going to call on him with sincerity because he takes your own tongue and he gives you a new tongue he might not only give you a new tongue to speak English he might give you a new tongue to speak in other languages I'm going to show you in a few minutes we're supposed to be learning Heaven's language while we're here don't you you go out of here and murmur and talk about me you come on now if you want to challenge what I'm preaching tonight go ahead and do it now come on let everybody see where you stand don't go out of here and criticize this you need him I need him we need him I'm going to pray I'm going to pray in tongues when the spirit of God gives me the utterance if it hair lips the devil and bankrupts hell if every Church in this message goes berserk because they heard me pray in tongues so be it it's God's gift to me it's God's gift to [Applause] you it'll make the knees of demons tremble it'll cause principalities and powers to shake because a man of God or a woman of God has got on their knees and they didn't start telling God how to do it they let the spirit of the Lord lead them in English or in other languages but it was Holy Ghost praying it was praying in the spirit somebody help that young lady and see what she needs please they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents I I just did I just did that the Apostle Paul said I withstood those beasts at Ephesus he wasn't talking about lion tigers and bears he wasn't singing Winnie Pooh's business lions tigers and bears he meant the kind that walk on two legs the kind that have forked Tong instead of new tongues the kind that Delights somehow in taking the power gifts away from the Bride of Jesus Christ I know that's rough I know that's rough I know it's too rough for some it's not how I want to deliver this tonight but the truth is the truth somebody somebody somebody's yeah we've got to stand up in this hour and decide what right and we've got to practice it are you withar me these they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it didn't tell you to drink St n it didn't tell you to pick up a rattlesnake that's right you know a Serpent's a twisty thing that's right he takes the word and twists it that's right he'll do it in your ear he'll use your family to do it he'll use your preacher to do it he'll use the social media to do it do it amen he'll twist that's what a serpent does but you shall take up these son shall follow them that believe they won't be stopped by serpents they won't be stopped by drinking any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and guess what be heal read it in the Amplified Elias pop it up there verse 17 please you still with me yes sir and these attesting signs attesting signs will accompany those who believe yes in my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new languages yeah there you go languages that they've never learned other languages of the earth that they have never learned and other languages of heaven and angels that they have never learned don't you tell me that because the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ has come that the that the church has lost her birth we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have the Holy Ghost we not only need the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need many refilling of the Holy Ghost how many of you have got one this [Applause] week in the church age book my sardian Church age he said yes the spirit you should have it yes the spirit is not seven spirits I'll wait on you it's right after Mark 16:17 the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same what and act the same but this is the eagle age I don't care what age it is it could have been the Buzzard age for all I know but what I do know is the word of God and the prophet is telling us in many places this just happened to be the easiest one for me to grab that if the holy ghost or the spirit of the Lord is present he's going to act the same and the Seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power if you make brother brandham contradict the Apostle Paul you're in false doctrin I can't follow a message I can't follow a message that contradicts the first church age messenger he said if I preach anything other than what he preached I'm a cursed when he stood in the in that place beyond the curtain of time and he said oh these are are these all brandom these are your people are all these brandom no these are your convert he said well I could only preach what Paul preached doesn't it embarrass you when you listen to a preacher uh who's preaching something contrary to what the Apostle Paul preached does it make you feel a little iffy about your faith come on if they make brother brandom preach something contradictory to the first church age messenger they've lost the continuity of the scripture and I can't embrace it he's got to preach what Paul preached I happen to believe he did I happen to believe when they when they preach otherwise it's because they're lifting things out of context it's because they believe that the message will stand alone maybe you're here tonight and you believe that the message will stand by itself I'm not one of those just so you'll know I believe it has to stand on the word I believe that's what the prophet said I believe you and I have to go to the Chinese Laundry I believe everything has to Dove tail hear me hear me is that too rough I believe it has to Dove tail with the word if you want God to bless it it can't be contrary to the [Music] word and if the church is the true church it will have the very same Spirit read and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost just a minute I used to think that these preachers that had a reader thought they were something now I'm 55 and and overweight and I have to get my breath all right so he's here so I wipe sweat and breathe not because I think that that I'm so important I need someone to read the Bible for me read brother read this is a quote read it by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church stop don't read any further that's it let's go [Music] home do you need anything else the bride Church in the last days she will be Pentecostal Church by experience not by Dogma not by Creed not by denomination not by presor District superintendence we're not running a railroad we're stewarding the Church of Jesus Christ we're not building a kingdom for man we're seeing the the kingdom of God restored in the earth through the fullness of his word and when that church Rises up she's not going to be afraid to pray in the spirit you'll see in a little while why it is so important cuz we talk way too much we speak way too much English we tell the devil everything he don't have to be gifted in any way of knowing what you're thinking he doesn't he can't read your thoughts he have to now you tell him everything that's wrong not only about yourself but about everybody around you he knows everybody's faults he knows exactly how to go after everybody because we speak it out what if we started praying in the spirit what if we started letting the spirit of the Lord direct our words in English and the next thing you know Heaven's language breaks through and you start talking like Angels talk I'll show you where the Prophet tells us that English is not going to be the the language of the New Kingdom we got to go we got to go got to go read what's wrong read and there will be tongues and interpret there will be no don't read that there will be it doesn't say there will be it says there will be there will will be tongues there will be what tongues not 12 in ones that flap all the time holy tongues new tongues Spirit tongues we're not going to compare languages when somebody first receives the Holy Ghost and I want you to know by the way oh I forgot better run all the disclaimers I don't have time for all the disclaimers tonight I know that speaking in tongues is not the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost I also know brother brandom said once you get the Holy Ghost you will speak in tongues he said the Pentecostals got the cart before the horse he said we ought to preach you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and after you've received it you'll speak in tongues he said I believe everybody will at some time or another filled with the Holy Ghost speak in tongues oh well I did back in Pentecost no I don't believe that's what it's talking about I Believe by experience read it right by experience it by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church will by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church there you go aren't you a preacher in training and there will be tongues will and interpretations oh and prophecy and healings and healings well if there's no interpreter then we're not going to know what's being said that is exactly right God wants to talk to the whole church sometime but you know what the prophet said about tongues and interpretation he said that becomes prophecy prophecy and ifies the body the whole body prophecies to edify the whole body but he said when tongues are interpreted they become prophecy I think some people are cold would you fix the air yeah people look a little chilly how in the world you could be chilly did you finish reading and interpret and prophecy and prophecy now now now now now if we've had the last prophet how could there be prophecy because he told us there's a difference between a prophet and the gift of Prophecy but he also told us Paul did now I'm just I'm just out on a limb now because Paul said it that may not be good enough for some folks but Paul said that in that five-fold Ministry those Ascension gifts there will be Apostles prophets P I heard brother brandom talking about the freaks he said they to make God like that he's not a three-fingered god he's not a four-fingered god hello anybody he's a FiveFinger his right hand's got five fingers Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher evangels all five they're here they're in the body they're in the body they're in the body and I tell you what if they'll press play and Obey if that five-fold Ministry in their own personal lives will press play and Obey they'll have a whole lot more to say once they get up here come on brother I'm not against the tapes we all need them you better be listening to them at home you better not be waiting to get to church to hear that word we're feasting on that so when I hear them talk about a false five-fold Ministry I agree with them that's the one that don't care that could care less about what he said there's something wrong with people like that there's something wrong with people that come this close oh yeah God didn't bring you this close to the message of the Hour come on he didn't bring you this close to the revelation of Jesus Christ for you to go scampering back to your denomination of jum he brought you this close to the truth so you'd make a stand I don't care if brother brandom said nine when there were eight right on I don't care care if he said there were 15 when there were 10 these little carnal things don't matter to me and they're not going to matter to the bride because we're not here to make a man infallible that's a Catholic Spirit ver B said this thing keeps going the way it is this will be worse than the Catholic church he preached that in his own house I believe it too I do too because you've organized with your religious Jon and where is the holy ghost in the [Applause] people come on I haven't had to preach like this in a long time it sounds wild I I'm I'm I'm sorry because my children lose friends when I preach like this I'm not kidding I'm not kidding they lose friends the last Youth Camp they went to in the message the last Youth Camp that they attended they were told to their face what the people think about this church really wow they said we get together before the service and decide what color flag we're going to fly fly come on now give me a flag I'm just kidding I don't know how to run that one give me one Megan kenos I just need one Megan I don't need a dozen just one really really does that offend you I've got more scriptures about flags and Banners than I do dancing when the king comes in they always Herald his [Applause] [Music] coming well I just don't understand it you don't have to understand it but you better not find yourself fighting against that because you may touch God almighty you may find Jesus on Your Hands some old boy tell my daughter uh I I I can't pursue a relationship with you because of the worship because of the way you all I'm going to hope that he gets fully born again and baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire I'm going to pray that he regardless regardless if I ever see him again I'm going to pray that he prays in the Holy Ghost until everybody around him looks at him like he's lost his mind because that's what we need and if you think I want for my daughter some stick in the M who won't let God be [Applause] God I don't want that we didn't play yes I'm okay I didn't fall I'm not dying I know my heart rate's over 100 good I'm burning calories I'm burning calories I can have a biscuit read I've got to hurry I'm on two page two read God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself W I can't help it declare himself in the midst of her as he always hasj hallelujah hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget [Applause] [Music] that brother bham said sure I believe you should speak with tongues he said I would that every member of my church spoke with tongues I would like them to do that I believe if you ask God God will grant it to you does that sound like somebody that's trying to say that tongues are no longer for the hour that we're living him come on come on we don't want false tongues we don't want imitation tongue we don't want counterv tongue I don't want some painted face Jezebel praying over me in tongues I know the devil can talk in tongues but so can the Holy Ghost we have emphasized the fults we've called the attention to the counterfeit that's right when brother Bram said the Pentecostal skies are full of the genuine look out there look Yonder Bri look Yonder The pent come on now come on now come on now that was almost like another language how many times these fiery Holy Ghost preachers will preach like that and they'll say oh I almost spoke in tongues you would set your church free if you just instead of saying I'm so sorry I'm so so sorry forgive me forgive me forgive me forgive me forgive me I almost spoke in tongues why don't you just one time take a leap of faith silent on top of the Temple Mount no one's everybody's Reverend he's pouring the water the priest is pouring the water over the foundation Zone silence and Yeshua the Lord Jesus screams out busting religion all to pieces and he says whoever thirst yeah God make me that kind I want to be that one in the crowd I want to be just like him when everybody else thinks that everything has to be so sacred and sanctimonious God God bless us all come on now when everybody else is in some kind of form I want to be the one that says who is thirsty among [Music] you who wants to drink of water Hallelujah he said I will out of men's [Applause] bellies I tell you I'm oh oh my Adam me you see it will flow [Applause] Rivers Fountains of Living Water it's a first fruits the whole the whole water ablation is a is a first fruits thing because they're praising God for what little rain has come and they're praising God in advance for the rain that will follow we haven't seen the last of the latter rain I'm telling you haven't have not we have not somebody said well didn't brother Brandon put us Way Beyond on the way beyond the latter rain there may be some quotes that lean in that direction and until you understand that you can't say the latter rign is over until you know that the teaching Reign has took a hold the teaching Reign has to it has to take a hold somebody's got to preach the teaching Reign somebody's got to preach the revelation of Jesus Christ somebody's got to declare the message and it's got to get in the hearts and minds of the Believers and then God's going to come and pour water on it he's already poured some water on mine has he poured any water on [Applause] yours yes sir it's so bad I'm not going to call names I'm not going to point to people in this room but it's so bad until the kids the young people are so confused over whether or not they have the Holy Ghost and when they ask the preacher sometime this is what they tell me this is what young people have told me that when they ask the preacher sometime they realize that even the preachers are confused about how do you know you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sometimes it's like starting a lawnmower that won't start you say well how do you know you got the baptism of hly they don't know what to say they stutter and stammer they don't really know what to say but let me tell you the best way for someone to know whether or not they have the Holy Ghost is to experience him and there's a young man in this house tonight that testified to me the other night that when he they said well you'll know it you'll know it you'll know what do you mean I'll know it on this was just is what do you mean I know it how am I going to know it is that fair oh but guess what when God opened up the heavens and baptized that young man with the Holy Ghost goes guess what he knew it ain't that right he knew it you can't grab a hold of a live wire and not know it you can't sit under the Breath of [Applause] God God will be in the midst of her God will declare himself in the M of her as he always say hallelujah she will be unorganized am he said I I believe if you would ask God God will grant it to you but let me tell you I know plenty of people that speak in tongues and hadn't got the Holy Ghost so do I so why don't I take the next two hours and preach on those quotes not tonight because he didn't call me up here tonight to preach on false tongues I know where to send you if you want to hear that message come on but he didn't call me here tonight to preach that one he called me here tonight to remind you that there cannot be a counterfeit unless there's a genuine you know what's going to set the Amish people free not by bringing them out of one Creed and into another Creed that makes us two-fold children of hell that's not what going to set them free what's going to set them free is a real experience with the Holy Ghost to get out from under a bishop to get out from under a bishop this is we have want none of that around here we can't afford to have any of that around here I'm afraid we won't be able to contain that you're right you can't contain fire once it gets out and you know what brother Bram said about Wildfire don't [Music] you yeah come on I'd rather have a little wifire he said my god sister I feel the same way brother I'd rather think I had a little bit of wildfire than to [Music] [Applause] die my old granny said if this ain't the fire it'll do till the fire they've Cried Out wildfire wildfire till they put out the fire she said just give me some fire and if this ain't the real fire it'll do me till the real fire gets here we're so afraid of the faults we're so afraid of the counterfeit we're so afraid of the imitation that we're not contending for the real oh there's going to be a generation of young people raised up around this [Applause] [Applause] message I don't know whether say this or not they're not forever they're not forever going to be satisfied to go three times a year and come home to a dead dry [Music] Church what they do now is they come home and for three or four weeks the whole church gets stirred up but it doesn't take long let somebody try to give her a message in tongues other than the pastor I've noticed it's okay for the pastor to do it yeah I know this sounds critical I I I I would almost apologize had I not come here tonight on a [Music] mandate how many how for how long for how long do you think those young people are going to go to youth camps and dance around and worship God and be filled with the spirit of the Lord and continue to go [Music] back and watch the Deacon put out the fire so afraid afid of disorder don't let anything get out of order what you really mean is don't let it get too anointed because if it gets too anointed you won't know what to do with it folk well I was in a church one time where they give message in tongues interpretation and that woman went off into sin and and what I did I was too I saw all the faults and yet I didn't see enough of the faults to convince me that somewhere there wasn't the real in fact in fact if you get tired like I did of the false you get tired of the counterfeit you go wild zealous passionate oh they call me in brother I'll point at you I won't call your name because this is too rough for your name to be associated with it I wouldn't do that to you but you know I'm talking to uhuh they called me in petted me on the head some of the camp meeting speakers now were just beginning back then and they called me in and patted me on the head you'll settle down one day you'll Cal down the word will settle you the word will mature you you're fiery now yeah I thought in the M minute I didn't know no better and originally I thought they were saying something nice we can see by the spirit that you will come to maturity but that's not at all what they were saying they were basically saying hang around us long enough and you'll do it just like I do it because that's what makes us comfortable thank God for every genuine house out there where the fire's falling thank God for every genuine man of God that has taken a stand thank God for every preacher of this message that will get the Holy Ghost to his people don't you ever think that I think that this is the only [Applause] place not for one second do I think that not for one second do I believe that but it's one of the places and all you have to do is look over the last year and you'll find that prophecies that we gave 20 years ago and more are now coming to pass people are now looking for a drink of water they they're tired of talking about it they're tired of being told that you better be careful you better be careful better be careful care better be careful who better be careful they're tired of being told if your hair stands up come on yeah well I'm not following my hair standing up on my arm but I will tell you I'll just be honest with you there are times that the electrical power of God moves across the surface of my skin and I do believe my the hairs on my arm are standing out of tension but that's not how I know I have the Holy Ghost not because I feel it not because I talk in tough not because I see Visions but I know it by the quickening the word said you'll know you're saved by the quicking making alive the quickening of your spirit you get an earthquake going on in your spirit you're now one with the Lord remember you get an earthquake going on in your spirit your emotions your mind will and emotions are going to shift because of that earthquake and your physical body is going to register the RoR [Music] scale and for you it may just be your hands in the air and tears streaming down your face don't you ever feel pressured on but I will be honest with you and say those of you who sit on your hands when worship is going on I truly wonder whether or not you have ever genuinely experienced the Holy Ghost I say that in love those who look terrified when the spirit of God begins to move or it gets a little loud or the watch goes off and tells them you're sitting under 90 DB uhuh mine tells me that multiple times in a service you better get out of that loud noise or you're going to damage your ears tells me that all the time yeah people get so afraid they're so nervous I see people here sometime just sitting you don't have to run you don't have to jump yeah you don't have to talk in tongues yeah but surely you want that River to Bubble Up within you and begin to push its way out little spring Little Brook why are you babbling so are you rejoicing because the little deers come and drink your water are you rejoicing brother B said because the little birds come play around in your cool water he said if that Brook could talk it would say no there's something on the [Music] end oh I need some help [Music] [Applause] H there's something on the inside that's bubbling out it's forcing its way [Applause] out 1 Corinthians 12:28 in the King James read it for me please we have to close well we do cuz some of you will kid me at the table sir about how long- winded I am this is the Holy Ghost in [Applause] here they're beginning to confess out loud I am the man oh this is Revival I am the man I am the man [Applause] and God read and God and God hath set some in the church first first apostles secondar prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues Hallelujah I thought all tongues were the same I thought every tongue had to be interpreted I thought like the Church of Christ that the only kind of tongues that were allowed were allowed in the book of Acts and that was only because they spoke in known languages yeah well this scripture just simply says yes there are teachers yes there are Miracles yes there are Gifts of healing but there's also a diversity of tongues in the Holy Ghost Church sometimes they hear people speaking in their own language sometimes it's a another tongue of man that they never learned it's happened it's happened some of you can witness sister Willams can witness that one night in the tws sun Tabernacle the Holy Ghost came down I called a woman out and prophesied over her in Spanish she heard the Lord she told me it happened in France French just don't know me I don't know if I ever told you this or not but it just it just REM reme that was me that was me that wasn't the spirit I was preaching in French Canada one time and the Holy Ghost spoke over a woman and tongues came they allowed it then in the message Church no nobody stop me come on yeah you know why because people are being healed and delivered and set free and they thought we can correct that while he's gone but while he's here let's get some help amen and and the Holy Ghost spoke and the woman heard it in French wow and the interpreters begin to say to her the John Majors begin to interpret for her what I just said and she said to him in French I don't need you to tell me what he said I heard him in perfect French H I can't even speak [Applause] English the Holy Ghost can talk in every language diversity look look at that the Amplified read it quick you you are holding me back read in a hurry so God has a appointed some in the church for his own use no no no no no for his own use God did it God put it in place first apostles special Messengers that's right second prophets inspired preachers and expounders thirdd teachers than Wonder workers Wonder workers my God bring on the Wonder [Music] [Applause] workers bring on the Wonder workers let us see the works of Christ restored to the [Applause] church bring them home read than those with the ability to heal the sick hello helpers helpers administrators whoa helpers you may not have the gift of Miracles yet but I want you to know God sees every biscuit even you who are going to heat them up instead of baking them oh yeah yeah all I'm asking sweetheart is one real genuine biscuit that's all I'm asking I I please don't save me a butter me not I I I God sees your effort nobody one person saw the no we need water I'm going to meet that need yeah that's the Holy Ghost flowing you sisters as tired as you are you rushed out to the to the the grocery store this afternoon again don't you think that the Holy Spirit isn't using you as a helper somebody said well that don't seem all that glorious I tell you it does to the ones that are hungry now read the rest administrators speakers in different unknown tongues huh yeah amen there are different kinds of tongues both Earthly and Heavenly languages known in unknown say amen amen Earthly are known languages for evangelism and is a sign to the unbeliever flash up there we're not going to read it but flash up there acts 25 and 6 and you will see that the last part of verse six you write that down you notet takers acts 25 and 6 you will see give me the six yeah because that every man look there at the end because that every man heard them speak in his own language that's right do you know we may need some of that that one day this nation becomes so Multicultural we we may be once again in a situation where we need somebody to raise up in tongues and it and it be understood in Spanish don't put that out like we might not ever need that again we've been on the mission field sometimes you need it on the Mion I'll tell you something else has happened and I know it's happened to brother too youe pring somewhere and all of a sudden the spirit of God says he's not saying what you're saying it's happened to me more than once and I said hey yeah you didn't just say what I said you said something else and I've had people call out from the congregation not Preachers by the way people call out from the congregation when he'd start stammering around trying to explain himself in his language I've had people call out and said no no no no no don't you deny it yeah I didn't know what he was saying but the Holy Ghost did it may happen to some of you young preachers you're going to need that Holy Ghost you're going to need to know going to need these things 1 Corinthians 14:22 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not so some tongues are for evangelism some tongues are for signs to the unbeliever [Music] right there are also Heavenly language oh yeah Heavenly languages read 1 Corinthians 13:1 read it for me though I speak though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol got to have love got to have charity yeah got to have perfect love that's not how they preach it that's not what I hear people saying so much it's not tongues yeah on it's not interpretation tongue not the gifts it's love it is love because if the gifts don't operate in love they operate in the wrong spirit got to have love that's right but the kind of love that's being ministered to there that's not the kind of love that says there are no more the church is no longer Pentecostal Church by experience what if I told you that I don't believe that this bride church is ever going to outgrow her Pentecostal birth amen I believe when the Rapture takes place there's still going to be some Among Us yes that pray in the Holy Ghost so which is it they often like to say Well when that which is perfect is come even brother brandom struggled with the concept he interpreted it three different ways all three ways are good I believe all three I believe it is perfect love I believe it is many things I also believe that it's the perfect interpretation of the word but I want you to know that is more rare it's going to be this going to be rough put your seat Bel on that's more rare among the message than people are willing to admit because if you're making the prophet say something that the word didn't say that's not the right interpretation of the word so we need some more of the revelation we need God revealing To Us by the Holy Spirit when we sit under those tapes and we hear that word we need the Holy Ghost go to show us how we can place that in the scripture and then we can hang our souls over hell for this message amen I'm not going to be in the shoes of those who say every word he spoke was thus sayeth the Lord there's only one who every word he ever spoke was thus sayeth the Lord guess who that was the Lord the Lord amen amen everybody else is subject to like passions Elijah the prophet subject to like passions as we are brother brand I'm often saying I make thousands of mistakes every day which by the way is a mistake because I don't believe he made thousands of mistakes every day I don't believe anybody made it was an exaggeration but he got the point across to some and very few very few refuse to hear it yeah oh he didn't mean that you've got to read between the lines it's all th say the Lord yes which I didn't mean to say this but it's coming which which is the sayith the Lord yeah when he preached that hell was eternal or when he preached that hell was not Eternal right when he preached that the white horse rider was Jesus Christ or when he preached that it was the Antichrist how's the little bride going to know she's going to take both of those words is the white horse rider the Antichrist is he Christ Christ or the Antichrist Christ guess what she's going to do she's going to take that to the word and she's going to find out he's the Antichrist and God revealed to brother brandom in a powerful way showed him exactly who the were he said well I thought it was Jesus come to find out it's the counterfeit right but it couldn't have been don't get mad it couldn't have been thus sayith the Lord yeah both times that's right or any of you preachers don't don't get loud but just nod a little louder yeah do you know my heart do you know my heart I've made my stand though I speak with tongues of men and angels that's diversities of tongues in the message God's provided way of dealing with sin read the read the dark part or yellow it's yellow here just read that and Jesus when he died spoke in an unknown [Music] tongue yeah if the Son of God in flesh could hang on that cross and die speaking in tongues if he left here speaking in tongues he said the age is ushered in by prophetic it'll go out the same way it came inen if our Lord died on the cross speaking in tongues you're going to tell me that the bride will have to give all that up before she makes

back it would behoove Christians thank you brother it would behoove Christians more today if they were trying to learn some Heavenly language the Praises of God the Praises of God that we're going to sing that we're going to sing over there and enjoy Hallelujah when I went down there and I heard this one doing that and that one doing the other I heard little tongues in the church and no interpreter no no no just go back and tell them that we are learning our Millennial [Music] language we're spending it oh we're spending as much time in the spirit as we can the prophet Isaiah excuse me the prophet Elisha read that one but there's one Kingdom read but there's one Kingdom that we believe that is coming soon the Lord Jesus Christ to set up an everlasting Kingdom and all nations of the world that saved will live in that Kingdom there will be one flag one flag one nation One People speaking one language that's the Heavenly language can you do a little better than [Music] [Applause] that do I have a few more minutes there are also different administrations of tongues I'm not here preaching on tongues you thought I was preaching on tongues no I I'm going to do that I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I have a whole series I'm going to preach on all the different kinds of tongues which ones need to be interpretting which ones don't I'm going to do it all but not tonight I'm I'm pray I'm talking tonight about praying in the spirit but I had to get a little bit out there would you read First Corinthians 12 6 and 7 in the Amplified if you need to stand to rest you can if you need to stretch your legs you can but come back I'm going to take just a few more minutes I can't leave it like this no sir and there are distinctive Vari of operation so stop trying to make it all the same thing all tongues are not the same all administrations of tongues are not the same read on of working to accomplish things there are different things that the spirit is trying to accomplish and so there are different administrations and different operations go ahead but it is the same God who inspires and energizes them all in all all go ahead read on but to each one is given the manifestation of the Holy Spirit the evidence the spiritual illumination of the spirit for good and profit King James says diversities and operations let me give you one of the diversities of operation 1 Corinthians 14:2 this does not have to be interpreted there's no scripture anywhere that says this kind of tongue has to be interpreted read it in King James for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I thought the scripture said a moment ago that tongues were aign to the unbeliever that would be speaking to men right this one said tongues are not to be spoken to men they're spoken to God why because it's a different kind of tongue with a different Administration and operation of tongues hello am yes for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh Mysteries yes be careful right we had a young man come here one time he was trying to believe for the supernatural he was trying to believe that God was moving in his bride but he heard a message in tongues that lasted a full 30 seconds longer than the interpretation my goodness that's right and he blew his mind don't laugh at him because some of you have thought the same thing the message in tongues last 5 minutes and the interpretation last two and a half couldn't be God are you crazy are you crazy have you ever been out of Alabama don't you know that in other languages things can take longer to say or they can be shorter in their inter because some languages have fewer words words are you kidding me we have got that technical around the message that we're going to time the [Music] interpretation have you this young man was very sincere but I just explained to him just what I've explained to you but here's another thing he said he saidwell in the in the message in tongues there were certain phrases that were repeated la la la la la la la la la T la la la and he said when the interpretation came I was waiting to hear that phrase repeated that's a logical thought but remember we're not talking about logical things here we're talking about spiritual things spiritual Things Are are not discerned by the intellect they're discerned by the word how many of you understand that Jesus could have said verily once and it would have meant the same thing it means truly but he often said truly truly yeah verily verily sometimes a phrase may be repeated in another language and it might even have there are certain phrases in certain languages that can be that you can use for English for instance English words you can use one set of English words when it's said the first time and another set of English words to expound on what was said the first time it's interpretation for crying out loud it's not word for word is there any scripture that says it has to be t for Tat are you do you think I'm going crazy here some of you all of a sudden started looking at me like you're just prach the truth this is about 20 years overdue we need to take a little time they're speaking Mysteries they're not talking to man they're talking to God sometime you go lay hands on somebody and they start talking in tongues hopefully not so loud that they've drawn all the attention of the house onto themselves because if they do that would almost require an interpreter if there was an interpretation yeah that's right but what if you just pray for them in a prayer line brother Dwayne you've been uh busy and allot of those I called your name I'm so sorry brother you know who you are you've been involved in a lot of those prayer lines have you ever had any of those precious sisters have you ever seen them young Godly women or young Godly Brothers come through there and they're being prayed for and they talk a little bit in tongues la la la la la la la la sh sh la la was that all right did you did you stop them in the line and say w we need an interpretation no because you knew they were speaking something you knew the Holy Ghost was saying something you know what he was probably saying I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer he was probably saying I receive this blessing I receive this blessing I receive this blessing Hallelujah but it come out T la la la la la la oh I'm having fun doing that no it didn't need an interpretation they were speaking something between them and God and it might even been their Destiny they might have been [Music] declaring their own destiny to the [Applause] dev speak it now how be he speaking mysteries in the spirit read it in the Amplified hurry for one who speaks in an unknown known tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands or catches his meaning because in The Holy Spirits he utters secret Tru secret truths and hidden things not obvious to understanding to the understanding it is bypassing his intellect I wonder how many young Godly men have walked across that stage and they were talking la la la la la shaaa making some little sound like like that and what they were really saying was God speaking through them I'm going to give you a Godly wife I'm going to fill you with a give you a virtuous woman I'm going to give you children that will serve the Lord better don't even know what they sayith and the preacher would call for an interpreter there there is to be no there doesn't have to be an interpreter when they're speaking mysteries in the spirit how are we going to know that we need some spiritual men we need some spiritual leaders some spiritual pastors that can call the critics and Skeptics down and say hold your peace that doesn't need an interpretation am I pasted my limit Benjamin but there are tongues that need to be interpreted and there's a Gifts of interpretation and you can read that now 1 Corinthians 14 for hurry he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself okay but he that prophesieth edifieth the church okay that's not critical that that's not negative no no sir if the purpose of the spirit if the mind of the spirit is to edify the church if the will of the spirit is to edify the church it should be by tongues and interpretation which then becomes prophecy or it should be by prophetic utterance amen but if the purpose of the spirit if the mind of the spirit if the will of the spirit is to help that person build themselves up because they've been beat up drug around slapped bruised bloody cutting [Applause] bleeding I've got people in this church that that literally they they walk up here like everything's all right but if you could see them you'd see they're bleeding they're bloody they're bruised they're broken their lives are in a mess they're [Music] suffering but they come up anyway you can't always know what's going on so if they come up here to Worship the Lord and you happen to be standing by one of them and one of them starts saying in a fairly calm way not too loud not to draw the attention of the whole church but if you should hear one of those soldiers of the cross get up here and get in the spirit and the spirit start talking out of them sh sha ha la la la don't you sit in the seat of the scornful you have no idea how edified that person needs to be that's not selfed edification that's edification by the spirit that's not somebody trying to to get Pride or say oh look at me look at me that's somebody that's trying to keep their head above water I'm telling you if you'll start praying in tongues if you'll start praying in the spirit if when you go home tonight you'll pray in English until the Holy Spirit prays through you somebody said I mean I may be up all night you might need to be up all night until you can loose yourself my granny taught me you needed my granny yeah my granny taught me she said son start in English start with what you know start with what you know about the need right but don't ever stop praying she told me that from the time I was s years old I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and spoke at tongues at the age of seven I spoke in tongues all night the next you don't have to you don't have to to get it but once you get it you will that's what he said uh I spoke in tongues all night I lay on a twin bed beside my back said granddaddy he woke up the next morning and said mild I've never seen anybody got a much of the Holy Ghost as that boy has got he has talked in tongues all night long I hadn't got a wink of sleep I woke up and went to the breakfast table and mama said big mama said you want milk or juice and I went somebody say you're offending me by the way you're using those Sy that's all they are if the spirit isn't saying them that's right that's all they are is syllables I don't encourage everybody to start going around doing that to one another and saying things like that I'm using that but I don't feel in any way like I'm in trouble no sir because if I'm just using it as a syllable that's all it is La La La but you let the Holy Ghost be in that and you don't know what you're saying you may be saying my me and my wife are going to have 12 children and then your wife's going to call that a false tongue an Christine help me if Austin starts talking them Mysteries you go to shut him down I know he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edify the church that word means edify and amplifi it means edifies and proves himself builds himself up prophecy builds up the whole congregation and that's why I read Jud 20 building up yourselves on the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost somebody needs to break through and pray in the Holy Ghost sometimes it's not it doesn't even seem to be a language at all I'm going to close with this Romans 8:26-27 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities read for me would you I got to breathe for we know not what we should pray for as we thoughts but the spirit itself maketh intercession intercession for us with groanings groanings which cannot be uttered by the way that word uttered there doesn't just mean sound it means understanding there are certain groanings in the spirit oh I'm just showing you a groan although I felt a little something in that one I'll tell you yes no syllables no seeming language just a guttle Gro oh I was standing by that man and he was growling like a bear call that the spirit you better be careful right it just gets all over me when they start groaning and moaning up there praying for one another no no it don't because if it got on you like you said it did you'd be groaning and moaning too when the spirit of the Lord fell on you you don't have to understand it just get out of its way right and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit this is what's so wonderful about praying in the Holy Ghost when you're praying in the spirit granny said pray pray in English pray what you know pray what you know about the situation until the Holy Ghost comes and when the Holy Ghost comes let him pray and it might sound like a language it might sound like a groan it might sound like a moan it might be oh yeah it might be hallelu but guess what the spirit of God knows exactly what the mind of God is you are safer praying in the spirit than you are praying in the natural and and and therefore therefore you're safer I'm GNA say this I might as well you're safer praying in tongues many times I've walked over a deathbed and you don't know whether to pray God rais them up God come get them now you don't always know the mind of God that's right but if you're not ashamed if you yield yourself the spirit of God might just pray through you and when you get through you can walk out of there knowing that whatever was said went straight to the throne amen I got to hurry I got to hurry I got to hurry can I come back and finish this another time and do some more with this I'm skipping skipping ski this is the last well I I uh uh I got two things ahead just REM I I just I know some of you won't you won't hear the second part so 1 Corinthians 141 13-20 write that down because I want you to know that I know that there is a benefit to praying in the spirit and with understanding love it the Bible said sing in the spirit and sing with understanding that's real powerful when you start groaning in the spirit or praying in another language and God let let you know what you're praying woo you might shock yourself if God lets you know what the Holy Ghost is praying through you it might blow your mind you might say if I would have known that I was praying that I don't even think I had the faith to believe that God could do such a thing that the spirit was pray maybe God takes you out of your own mind sometime prays through you in the spirit and then lets you know what you pray with understanding so you say whoa I didn't even know I had the faith to believe such a thing does that sound reasonable to anybody I know it's late so I want to go over that with you another time but here's what I wanted to show you this is questions and answers if I promise you this will be the last will you listen how many of you give me your undivided attention if I promise you I don't know Pastor you you've stretched it a little time for two when you prayer paragraph 89 go to the highlighted part would you read this Ellas it's a lot of reading but I want you to get it through everybody listening yes sir sir get it out wherever you're in prayer wherever you're in prayer at your home at oh he's never going to get through with me stopping him I know but I want you to hear this at your home or wherever you are wherever you are speak then wait a minute wherever you are what if you're around the Altar and somebody hears you give them something to talk about I don't mean out loud that you're going to take the whole attention of the whole service you shouldn't do that unless you know you're going to be able to tell us what you're saying because what how do the rest of us get blessed by that but if you're happen to be up here and the spirit of God moves on you brother grey lays hands on you and you start thanking God in English and the next thing you know something else comes out we don't believe in teaching people to speak in tongues I saw them do that in Pentecost yes sir I saw them hold up their tie and say see my tie tie my tie you say that over and over again and and finally they'd say it to many times they start stumbling around and the old sisters just start say she's got it she's got it yeah got a twisted tongue but that's not necessarily the Holy Ghost read on wherever you are wherever you are speak then wherever you're in prayer at your house at your home or wherever you are speak then because he that speaketh in an unknown tongues edifieth himself brother Bram does seem to have a problem with you being edified that's right it gives him consolation gives him anybody ever need any consolation hello go ahead he feels good feel because he that ought to be outlawed Christian people ought not to feel good I think some people think that's the way it is you a you you're tired now you ain't going to help me go ahead go ahead go ahead because he is standing there praying and the first thing you know the Holy Spirit come upon he first thing you know or she and they begin to speak let's get that one in in Tong whoa whoa stop women can thank you Jesus your Prophet said a sister has every right to every spiritual gift except handling the word thank you well we all know that women are the weaker vessel right I agree right they ought to talk in tongues more than the men they're so weak they ought to be edifying building themselves up come on read I'm in trouble and their soul was rejoicing and happy because they spoke in tongues is that such a shame I think it sounds wonderful read on why that was wasn't just a sign that God wasn't going to answer wait a minute I think you're you're you're going to have to read that more carefully get the right words why that was that was really why son that's not really why it's why you know when you're talking you say why I understand understand you're not a southerner let me interpret brother bram's tongues for you that's why why that wasn't just a sign that God was going to answer the prayer that you was praying for but read it was a sign that the holy spirit's hearing you whoa stop stop right there here you started praying in eng and the Holy Spirit started praying uh for you through you for you that was not just a sign that God was going to answer your prayer that's one of the things it was yes sir boy if I say that they'll all start talking in tongues right now it was a sign that God was going to answer your prayer but look what else it was it's a sign that the holy spirit's hearing you he knows you read he's with you he's with you that's the same thing I would apply to this the Holy Spirit giving you a blessing what's wrong with that shouldn't the bride be blessed shouldn't all things be done in decency and order yes but shouldn't the bride be blessed sounds to me like it's a blessing to pray in the spirit sounds like it's a blessing to pray in the Holy Ghost seem like you're praying the will of God when you pray in the Holy Ghost all right now it's going to take you a while to read this so you better start here some time ago the last time I spoke with tongues wait a minute my Prophet my Prophet didn't speak in tongues so well why would I need to do such a thing as that well he may not have spoken tongues as often as some but he did and then if you want to know how that compares to the first church age messenger Paul said said I thank my God I speak in tongues more than all of you you just keep on murmuring I I have a feeling he was just almost daring them just keep your murmuring up I'm going to talk in tongues more than that oh yeah I've had to do it I sat in the camp meeting up the road there many years ago and I heard a preacher in the message talk about a Malachi 45 and6 birth and I searched my Bible sitting there in that big crowd of Believers and I read Matthew 4:5 and 6 over and over I didn't see anything in there about a birth said that Spirit of Elijah would turn the hearts I I got all that I realized in a few minutes that that man was preaching that you need the new birth and then you need a Malachi 45 and six birth I don't even know what that is right if you do maybe you can help me but if the Bible New Birth is not enough to birth you from above you got a problem so I went up to him after the service and I went up to the pastor who was in charge of the big camp meeting who I happen to know spok in tongues and I pulled him to the side and I said can you please explain to me brother what a Malachi 4 you know having your eyes open to see the meage blah blah blah BL BL I said look that's you you're preaching something that's not even in the word that's not even in the Bible you're telling people they need a new birth they need the Holy Ghost plus right they need a revelation of who God is plus they need a revelation who the prophet is one revelation will lead you to the next Revelation you don't have to separate the experiences and you know what he said to me honest before God he said well brother surely I'm I hear that on occasion you're getting excited in the pulit and you speak a little bit in tongues what has that got to do with Malachi 45 and6 birth I challenged him so he challenged me and I said brother I I have been guilty and I said I hope you'll pray for me that I can speak in tongues more than you [Applause] all CU Paul did you've done a lot of talking tonight about speaking in tongues I want you to think about the last 20 years of your experience in the message and I want you to tell me how many messages you've heard on the genuine gift of tongues or the genuine gift of praying in the spirit I want you to think of how many you have and then when when we can compare this three hours tonight come on yeah with the 20year absence then you can tell me I've overstepped my bounds this evening all right I doubt most of you have ever heard a sermon you may have heard excerpts in sermons but I doubt any of you have that's the reason why I felt like the spirit of the Lord was pressing me tonight and I hope that it will be a contagious fire yes sir and I hope men of God all over this nation and world will begin to show the people there couldn't even be a phony if there wasn't a genuine read on the last time I spoke in tongues as I can remember was it's a bit about three or four years ago it's been about three or four years ago now do you think that means that you're supposed to wait that was brother Brandon giving his testimony that doesn't have to be your testimony I'm going to tell you a secret I pray in tongues every day of my life I have for the last 48 years never gone to bed I'm I know it sounds boasting but I have never gone to bed in these 48 years without knowing that some time during the day I prayed in English until the Holy Ghost took over and prayed through me it may be the reason why I'm still here tonight it may be the reason why I'm still preaching here tonight because he has strengthened me and sustained me and encouraged me when there was nobody else you've been there that's right you've been there you've been there when there was nobody to give you an encouraging word but the Holy Ghost would fall on you and you'd [Applause] [Music] feel [Music] [Music] tell me what you feel brother Shelly I feel strength coming into my body it's not about what you feel what did you just feel I just felt strength and virtue and consolation coming into my body Hallelujah that's how he's kept us I'm closed musicians coming I would have never known to do such a thing I would have never known to pray in English until the Holy Ghost prayed had it not been for my old granny they used to try to tell me my granny didn't have the Holy Ghost because she was a woman preacher I said you may not have it but she had the Holy Ghost and when the truth struck her heart amen and I challenged her on preaching she said I'll never do it again now you tell me whether she had the holy ghost or not you didn't even know her and you tell me whether she had it or not when the spirit when the spirit when he the spirit comes he will lead you and guide you and direct [Applause] you I've been seeing something don't strike this probably from the tape but I've been seeing something going around on social media about how the spirit of God was falling years ago and Men of God men of God would just kind of lift off the floor while they were preaching we need some of that Wonder workking we may never see that again may never but you be careful how you criticize it there was a whole church in gelico Tennessee that fell under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost the church was called Church of God of the mountain assembly and everybody in the church had long uncut beards they were not Amish but it was a tradition in that church and the Holy Ghost would come and not one but many there were times that the spirit of the Lord would fill that room with a blue cloud and there were many people who were seen standing off the floor as the Holy Ghost came in a cloud and lifted them up now now now on I don't believe in such things as that good good you'll never experience it you'll never have to worry about it you don't have to lift off the ground I'm not saying something silly like that no you don't have to do that your inner man's lifted when that Holy Ghost comes on you but don't you limit God this ain't thing ain't over The Showdown The Showdown on Mount Zion's coming somebody said what about a mount car will showd down we're passing that fast he said there's one coming on Mount Z dying and that's going to show the mature Sons only the mature sons are going to pass that one you and I better be working toward maturity in this hour read I don't hear you I was in annoy and Billy come after me for to go to a the prayer line up at Zion City that's right read and I was burdened on my heart brother Brandon burdened on his heart knelt I knelt down and started to pray and while I was praying I heard Billy come up and knock at the door and I said Billy I can't go now have you ever felt that have they ever come for you but you wasn't ready to go yet because the burden of prayer had struck your heart so heavy on I have some of you have go and he went out there and sat down and I was praying my heart's so burdened I couldn't go to church like that read on and see usually sometimes he gives me Visions show me something's going to happen but he didn't do it then right and you don't have to be a prophet to see a vision just so you know read on and I was just praying away in the room there and I heard someone talking I quit praying I listened and there was somebody at the door mhm there was sounded like a foreign language sounded like a foreign language like German like German or low Dutch or something it was so fast chattery I listened again and I thought well somebody's come up there talking to that Motel man in German he didn't recognize where this language was coming from he thought a man had come up there talking to the to the caretaker of the motel in the German language well somebody's come up there talking to that Motel man in German maybe he'll answer him back go on and I just quit praying leaning over a chair like this leaning over a chair like this listening listening and he just kept on talking I thought well wonder why there's somebody don't answer back and I listened I thought well now isn't that strange nobody's answering him back there was a weight scales down the road and I I heard that fellow down there hollering drive off you know he could hear it in the natural and drive on I turned around looked out that way and I did I felt my mouth come to find out I felt my mouth you know that's how I received the Holy Ghost wow that language was coming out of me I focused on the language and missed it finally put my fingers to my mouth and realized it was coming out of me all along brother brandom said I felt my mouth come to find out how was the one doing the talking that that low Dutch or German sounding language that he was hearing was coming out of his own mouth read on it was me it was me and I just kept real still not knowing not one thing I had no more control wait a minute I had no more control of what I was saying read then nothing knowed not one thing I was saying not a thing didn't understand what he was saying saying where was The Interpreter yeah yep come on it was coming yeah it was coming later that night read I just my mouth was moving mouth was moving I was speaking some kind of a language I just held real still what kind of Pentecostal profit have we got read on after a while it quits and when it quits oh my I felt like I could scream out yeah I was just so happy so happy after praying in German or I low Dutch or or or who knows what he was praying in I don't know why but the burden all left me you know why cuz the prayer had touched the [Music] throne the burden last oh my God that's good so I went on to the church then called Billy and when I got to the church Mr Baxter then was the manager of the meting that's ER backer and he was a been singing singing waiting I was over a half hour late well sir yeah and I told him that I was just late he he's seen I'd been weeping and he said what's the matter read on and I said nothing and I went on and just about 10 minutes a woman come in at the back of the auditorium here come a woman and she was about to take the place back there and when we checked up with the woman to find out she was on her road from Twin Cities St Paul and Minneapolis somewhere one of those cities the she was so bad with TB the ambulance would not dare to bring her her lungs were in such a condition hear this just jail just jail read on and so a couple of Brethren got an old Chevrolet car and took the car seat out and fixed her a cot and their some way or bed and lay laid her on it and was bringing her to the meeting she wanted to come the doctors had give her up and on the road over they told her the last little bump she'll go into a hemorrhage and that's it and she went into a hemorrhage and they had taken her out and laid her on a grass flat come on and the Saints were standing there praying over the woman and she was just every time she breathed it's just gurgling the blood would blow out of her mouth like that and all of a sudden right you read it right all of a sudden she was she was instantly healed and she jumped up from there and started rejoicing remember brother brandom didn't lay hands on her remember she didn't come through the prayer line the Holy Ghost had already prayed for her come on to the church and there was and there she was back there testifying back in the back now let go back to that real quick what did she do she jumped up from there yeah started rejoicing yeah she come to church healed read on I said what time was that and when she gave the time of what time it was it was the very same time that the speaking was going through me well what was it it was the Holy Spirit making intercession for that woman there see what I mean yeah now the Bible says that sometimes we muttered words mutter words yeah just muttering read on they're getting your patience is thin I feel it read on we don't know you can't see through me we don't know what you're talking about but it's the holy spirit's in there moving out Mak an intercession for those things we don't know what we're talking about when the Holy Ghost is praying through us but it's the holy spirit in there moving out making intercession for things that we do not understand and the woman was instantly healed he heard from her from a long time we heard from her for a long time from there perfectly well got all right now you see God knows where those things are and he was he has a way of doing it he has his own way of doing it right what's he say we must we must just submit ourselves to what he does can can the church say amen amen the last sentence the last phrase we can also pray in the spirit that's from my notes understanding that's from my notes here's the last phrase I want to make you heard brother gley last night blow the chaar do you know that's God's voice did you know the Jewish people believe that when that chofar sounds God's voice is in the chofar did you know they also believe that when they sound the chofar it's the voice of the people responding to God I will I will I will obey I'll go did you know the Jewish people believe that when that chofar sounds it confuses the Demons of hell and the devil is confused when that sounds and the Demons Run Away did you know that did anybody know that about the chofar no no interpret did you know that's one of the benefits of praying in the Holy Ghost the devil doesn't know what's being said sir the last quote put it up the last one the last one the last of the notes yeah look grandma was slow what did you turn it off when I said I'm done big mistake you've got a song Ready right seventh seal and in Sabino Canyon he said this is the third pool I'm going to read this one sh and there's three great things that goes with it yeah amen one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing listen preachers come on yeah on don't you brothers be you that are here please take my advice don't be getting up there telling the people that you know everything about the third pull and you know everything about the seven seal right because you're going to make yourself somebody you're not here's what the prophet said the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I canot in interpret yeah because it's an unknown language amen but I stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third pull coming up and brother Bram knocks on the pull pit three times and the Holy Spirit of God oh my if you don't think he's talking about the seventh seal he's preaching the seventh seal but if you don't think he's talking about the seventh seal he wants to remind you he's talking about the seven con seal oh my that's the reason all Heaven yes was silent the third part of the third pool has something to do with the 30 minutes of silence Before the Throne I don't know what it is but there's a connection so every time you hear preacher say we've got we know it all we know all about it we know all about it we know everything about the seven seal because it's in the message brother B said so brother B said we know it all he may have said that he may have made made reference to that but when he was preaching the seven seal that's when the angel was supposed to be with him that's right right when he was preaching this I got one one come to this other one came but he said that third that I could not make it out it was in an unknown tongue he said in the Holy oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent is that all ear L more now I better stop right here see I just feel checked not to say no more about it when you tell me you know it all when you get up and preach that we know everything there is to know about the seven seal and when you get up and preach that we know everything there is to know about the seven Thunders you're missing one huge important piece of the pie yeah yeah so just remember the seven seal the reason it was not opened but I heard brother brandham say many times it was open Seven Seals Seven Seals sometimes he said six sometimes he said seven I heard brother Bram say many times that that seven seal was open well here you hear him saying that there was one part of that seventh seal that he did not know what it meant it went by him and a unnown thank you he said see the reason it did not reveal it no no one please forgive me top 10 preachers no one yes no one should know about it when God wants to send a secret that he don't want nobody to know about when the spirit of God wants to pray through you and he don't even want the devil to know what you're saying he'll do it in an Unown tongue the reason that the third part of the seven seal was not revealed the reason why there was 30 minutes of silence in heaven is because it was not to be known you'll hear brother brandom saying in another Play The Devil could do great damage amen if you got a hold of this is that all the quote let's stand we need to pray in the Holy Ghost we need to pray in the Holy Ghost you can't manufacture it but I want to know how many of you know you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm waiting on you how many of you know you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may not have the gift of tongues or the gift of interpretation but how many of you know you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you do you can pray in the spirit I believe you see when they kept telling us that some people don't have the gift of tongues gift of tongues some people don't have the gift of Tong some people don't get the gift of that's right they don't give message in tongues but brother ROV said when you receive receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will you will not tongues and then Holy Ghost Holy Ghost and then the tongues will follow even if you don't have a gift of tongues that's that's right you're afraid to say Amen because you think I'm going to preach another [Music] hour thank you I believe you mean it so when they when they try to discourage us by saying everybody don't have a gifted tongue that's right amen amen amen we believe it but we believe that every person who receives the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost at some time or another if they yield themselves to that spirit of God within them he will testify amen yours may not sound like mine mine might may not sound like yours it may not come when mine comes mine may not come when your come some may get it the same night some may get it 25 years later there's quite a few people in this church that had the holy ghost that believed the truth that never spoke in tongues until they got in an atmosphere where it was legal you'd be surprised what a legal atmosphere will [Music] do it'll cause the illegal hatch out you get the atmosphere right so I want us I want us to I want us to do what the scripture says I want us to earnestly contend for the best gift I want us to ask God on to take us to the place in his Spirit where we as a people wherever you worship can begin to pray in the spirit sometimes English and sometimes in a language that we have never learned amen because there are things that the spirit of God wants to release out of you and through you that he didn't want the devil to know nothing about and the next time you're home praying alone and and a sound begins to you let it go you may be prophesying Mysteries over your own life hello let's worship I'm I'm I'm sorry that it's so late I am I'm sorry I am [Music] come on Holy Ghost stir to give life you are love you bring light to the
