[0:00] real Ministry comes out of the inside of
[0:04] the inside that's
[0:06] Spirit it cannot be demonstrated from
[0:10] Spirit to flesh it must pass through the
[0:14] inner dimension of man so it may
[0:17] originate in the spirit that's the only
[0:20] kind of praise and worship that God will
[0:22] honor is that that originates in spirit
[0:26] and in order for it to transfer itself
[0:30] to the demonstration of the body you
[0:33] know some people say well I have a
[0:35] feeling that he was in the flesh well I
[0:39] hope he
[0:41] was because if he wasn't in the flesh he
[0:44] was a disembodied spirit and I'm not
[0:47] interested in anything he does somebody
[0:50] said I saw him and he was just waving
[0:53] his arms and carrying on he must have
[0:56] been in the flesh sure he was sure one
[1:00] his flesh is the only thing that God has
[1:04] given him to
[1:07] demonstrate what's happening in the
[1:09] inner
[1:12] man are you in the flesh when you raise
[1:15] up your hands and praise the Lord sure
[1:17] you are but your praise doesn't
[1:20] originate in your
[1:23] flesh it doesn't originate in your body
[1:27] it's origin Hallelujah is the
[1:31] inside of the
[1:33] inside that which originates that which
[1:36] is birthed in the spirit passes through
[1:39] the realm of mind you've got to make a
[1:42] choice
[1:45] will and then what else
[1:49] emotions so yes praise and worship is
[1:53] going to be
[1:55] emotional we respond emotionally
[1:58] sometime without faith
[2:01] and we respond
[2:03] negatively and and in an ill way and it
[2:07] accomplishes nothing but your emotions
[2:10] are not your enemy right your soul is
[2:14] not your
[2:15] enemy it's a gift of God to filter life
[2:20] it helps your spirit to be in touch with
[2:22] your
[2:24] flesh it's the
[2:25] middleman the breath of God's spirit
[2:29] ruach
[2:30] hakodesh the breath of the Holy Spirit
[2:34] went into a flesh body one made of the
[2:37] earth
[2:39] Adam from the earth from the red clay he
[2:43] breathed breath into the nostrils of
[2:47] Adam the dirt and Adam
[2:51] became a living
[2:54] Soul he was breath and body before he
[2:59] became a living Soul breath entered into
[3:03] a body before he became a living Soul
[3:05] his soul was given to him that he might
[3:09] remain in contact with his
[3:13] environment there is a a sense in our
[3:17] life that we have to be connected to the
[3:20] environment around us and the atmosphere
[3:22] around us while maintaining our
[3:24] connection to God and without our mind
[3:28] without our will and without our
[3:30] emotions we would not be able to stay
[3:33] connected to Earth to reality to life to
[3:37] family to to
[3:39] obligations to jobs to the Natural Life
[3:43] that we must live if it were not for the
[3:46] mind and the will and the emotions the
[3:48] soul of man we would not be able to
[3:51] remain connected to the life around us
[3:53] to the Earth around us to the
[3:55] environment around us to the atmosphere
[3:57] around us and had it not been for mine
[3:59] will and emotion our spirit would not be
[4:02] able to always remain
[4:04] connected to God our creator and the
[4:07] inspiration of our life because there
[4:10] needed to be a way of expressing our
[4:13] gratitude our Thanksgiving so yes let me
[4:16] just boil that down for you there's
[4:19] going to be
[4:20] emotion in your
[4:28] praise
