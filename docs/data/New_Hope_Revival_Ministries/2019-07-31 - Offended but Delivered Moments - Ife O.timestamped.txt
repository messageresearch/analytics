[0:00] there are going to be things that happen
[0:01] in your life that will offend your faith
[0:09] [Music]
[0:13] for a certain woman whose young daughter
[0:16] had an unclean spirit heard of him and
[0:21] came and fell at his feet he's hiding in
[0:26] the house of someone who knew him and
[0:28] all of a sudden this woman is knocking
[0:31] on the door because her daughter was
[0:34] grievously vexed with an unclean spirit
[0:36] and she had heard that mighty things
[0:40] were taking place in the ministry of
[0:42] Jesus Christ and she said I have nothing
[0:45] to lose but I have everything to gain
[0:47] I'm going to go and trouble him
[0:49] she had no claim on him as the Messiah
[0:52] she approached him based on what she had
[0:56] been told about him
[0:58] she had no right to call him Jesus thou
[1:01] son of David that was a messianic term
[1:03] but she did all that she knew to do she
[1:06] had some perception that if the stories
[1:09] and testimonies that she had heard were
[1:11] true this could possibly be the Jews
[1:14] Messiah and when she spilled all of that
[1:17] out Jesus thou son of David have mercy
[1:20] on me
[1:21] verse 23 said but he answered her not a
[1:23] word
[1:26] yet can we just say he ignored her why
[1:33] would he do something like that he had a
[1:37] reason didn't he her faith was being
[1:40] tested he was not giving her any reason
[1:43] for hope she would not settle for
[1:46] discouraging silence she would not
[1:48] settle for being ignored she would not
[1:51] take no for an answer
[1:53] Jesus was the only hope that she had so
[1:56] what did she do she cried out again
[1:59] there are going to be things that happen
[2:01] in your life that will offend your faith
[2:05] and you will be faced with a decision do
[2:09] I give up do I say it says I thought it
[2:12] was I didn't think he would do any good
[2:15] but I did it anyway but it didn't happen
[2:16] or will you say Oh Lord even if you
[2:21] don't have I don't hear your voice
[2:23] even if I don't hear your answer I'm
[2:25] going to keep knocking on the door I'm
[2:28] going to keep laying my need before you
[2:30] because I believe that you're the only
[2:33] one who is able to make a difference for
[2:35] me he was not yet her Messiah he was not
[2:38] yet her Savior but he was her Lord
[2:41] because as soon as she got down on her
[2:43] face her knees before him she was
[2:47] acknowledging that he had power to make
[2:49] a difference in her life you call
[2:52] somebody Lord it meant I am submitted to
[2:56] your authority I believe that you have
[2:59] enough power or enough authority to
[3:01] change my situation so I bowed down here
[3:04] and called you Lord lord have mercy on
[3:09] me really she got rid of religious
[3:12] jargon that she had no understanding of
[3:15] and she let her heart talk lord help me
[3:21] she was exactly right he was her Lord he
[3:26] wanted to be her or them he was testing
[3:30] her faith to see if she could push
[3:32] through the rejection he's gonna get
[3:35] quiet now he was testing her faith to
[3:38] see if she could push through the
[3:39] rejection push through the offence push
[3:42] through having her feelings hurt see
[3:45] just how deep her faith was running what
[3:48] move God that day for the syrophoenician
[3:50] woman she said the right thing
