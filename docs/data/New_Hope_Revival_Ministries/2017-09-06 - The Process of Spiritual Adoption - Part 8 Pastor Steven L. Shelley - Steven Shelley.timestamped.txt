[0:20] you
[0:21] [Music]
[0:37] you
[0:38] [Music]
[0:50] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and
[0:53] you're watching the Eagles cry welcome
[0:55] to the program today we are still
[0:58] involved in a long study on the
[1:02] spiritual process of adoption or perhaps
[1:05] it would be better to call it the
[1:07] process of spiritual adoption that but
[1:11] the adoption is spiritual and so is the
[1:13] process and I've had a wonderful time
[1:16] examining the scriptures with you and
[1:18] teaching you some of the truth that God
[1:20] has made real to me we want to thank you
[1:23] for contacting our ministry by email or
[1:26] however is convenient for you many of
[1:29] you have let us know that the program is
[1:31] a blessing and that you're learning and
[1:34] that God is using the the scriptures and
[1:37] the teaching to speak to your heart to
[1:39] cause you to develop in your walk and
[1:41] that is a real blessing that's why we're
[1:43] here that's why we come and you'll
[1:47] notice that we're not coming asking for
[1:49] finances where we're not asking anything
[1:52] of you except that you would just be
[1:54] willing to open up your heart let the
[1:57] Lord speak to you and also search the
[1:59] Scriptures to see if these things be
[2:02] true and pray for the network's pray for
[2:06] the Christian networks that you are
[2:08] viewing this program on that God will
[2:11] bless them and supply their need
[2:13] according to his riches in glory and if
[2:17] you are a praying person and you would
[2:20] help to pray for our ministry and for
[2:22] the Eagles cry that God would supply our
[2:25] need and help us to continue to come
[2:27] then that would be a great blessing as
[2:29] well most importantly we'd like to pray
[2:32] with you about your prayer request so if
[2:34] you'd send them to us we would be happy
[2:36] to join our faith with your faith and
[2:38] believe God for a miracle let's get
[2:41] right back into the study and see what
[2:43] the Lord has for us this week okay we
[2:46] are talking about the last time we were
[2:49] together we were mentioning that there
[2:52] are three Greek words that are
[2:54] translated in english in the New
[2:57] Testament as sons one was speech
[3:01] more or less about infancy now I failed
[3:04] to mention that there's also a Greek
[3:06] word called breath O's that is used to
[3:10] refer to a babe a baby so really we
[3:15] could say there are four stages but
[3:17] we've chosen the three most important
[3:19] and that is infancy then adolescence or
[3:23] puberty and then maturity or adulthood
[3:27] but for instance we read about the babe
[3:32] leaping in the womb of Elizabeth when
[3:35] Mary the mother of our Lord came and
[3:39] gave salutation the Bible said the babe
[3:41] left in the womb and that word is
[3:43] breakfast and it it simply means a baby
[3:48] it can also mean a fetus it can also
[3:51] mean a baby that is not yet born so
[3:54] sometimes you'll see that word also
[3:56] translated in the New Testament but more
[4:00] more often it's the three the one that
[4:03] refers to infancy the one that refers to
[4:06] to puberty or the teenage years and the
[4:09] one that refers to adulthood now when we
[4:13] look at these words we see that there is
[4:16] a pattern that's revealed in the
[4:19] scripture from the life of the Lord
[4:21] Jesus Yeshua the Messiah and we can see
[4:24] his maturity don't forget Hebrews 5 8
[4:28] through 10 though he were a son yet
[4:31] learn to obedience by the things which
[4:33] he suffered and you can go on and read
[4:36] about him being made perfect he became
[4:39] the author of eternal salvation unto all
[4:42] of them who obey Him look at that very
[4:45] carefully because it's very important
[4:47] for us to note that as it was in the
[4:52] Hebrew culture the three stages of
[4:54] development we can see that indicated in
[4:58] the life of the Lord Jesus through the
[5:00] scripture let's look at that for just a
[5:02] moment what is the first what is the
[5:06] first major milestone in the life of a
[5:09] Jewish person in in biblical times
[5:13] it would have been circumcision that
[5:17] took place on the eighth day now we
[5:20] often in the Christian Church we have
[5:22] something that we call a baby dedication
[5:25] where the baby is brought and in the
[5:27] Protestant church we don't baptize or
[5:30] sprinkle the baby but we pray for the
[5:33] baby and we pray for the parents and the
[5:35] grandparents and the supporting family
[5:38] members that God will help them to help
[5:40] the child as he grows and develops but
[5:44] remember that it was a commandment of
[5:46] God that the male children be
[5:48] circumcised the foreskin of of the male
[5:52] member was to be cut off and that was to
[5:57] be an external mark it was to be an
[6:01] outward mark of the Covenant that this
[6:05] son this child was marked by the
[6:08] Covenant or a son of the commandment and
[6:12] somebody said well did that happen in
[6:14] the life of Yeshua it absolutely did in
[6:17] Luke chapter 2 beginning in verse 21 and
[6:22] I'd like to take time if you don't mind
[6:24] to read that because perhaps some of you
[6:27] have never read it before remember that
[6:29] the Eagles cry is going to many nations
[6:32] of the world where some people may not
[6:35] be as familiar with with things that we
[6:38] often just assume that everyone has read
[6:41] or encountered themselves individually
[6:44] Luke 2 and verse 21 and when eight days
[6:48] were accomplished for the circumcising
[6:52] of the child his name was called Jesus
[6:55] or we say in Hebrew Yeshua now it's very
[7:00] clear and I know people who don't
[7:03] realize I've had people say that they
[7:05] didn't realize that Yeshua was
[7:07] circumcised on the eighth day as the
[7:10] commandment was given in the scripture
[7:12] and we have it right here in the Book of
[7:14] Luke and when eight days were
[7:16] accomplished for the circumcising of the
[7:18] child his name was called Yahshua which
[7:21] was so named of the angel before he was
[7:25] conceived in the womb
[7:27] and when the days of her purification
[7:30] this was the the appointed days of
[7:35] cleansing and purification for a woman
[7:38] who had given birth who had just given
[7:40] birth there was a time period that was
[7:44] set aside for her purification and so
[7:47] that everything was was all right when
[7:50] the days of her purification according
[7:52] to the law of Moses were accomplished
[7:55] they brought him to Jerusalem to present
[7:57] him to the Lord so as soon as that
[8:01] period of time pass they made the
[8:03] journey from Nazareth all the way to
[8:06] Jerusalem and as it is written in the
[8:08] law of the Lord every male that openeth
[8:11] the womb shall be called holy to the
[8:14] Lord and to offer a sacrifice according
[8:17] to that which is said in the law of the
[8:19] Lord a pair of turtledoves or two young
[8:23] pigeons which we understand from Second
[8:26] Temple period study that this was the
[8:29] poor version of the offering and it was
[8:32] all that Miriam our Mary and Joseph
[8:35] Joseph had to bring verse 25 and behold
[8:40] there was a man in Jerusalem whose name
[8:42] was Simeon and the same man was just and
[8:46] devout waiting for the consolation of
[8:49] Israel waiting for the promised
[8:52] Redemption that would be brought in the
[8:55] coming of moshiach the one who was
[8:58] ordained of God prophesied by the
[9:01] prophets to bring Redemption and
[9:04] salvation and the Holy Ghost was upon
[9:08] him upon Simeon and it was revealed unto
[9:11] him by the Holy Ghost that he should not
[9:14] see death before he had seen the Lord's
[9:17] Messiah the Lord's Christ and he came by
[9:22] the spirit into the temple led by the
[9:24] spirit into the temple and when the
[9:26] parents brought in the Child Jesus to do
[9:30] for him after the custom of the law then
[9:32] took key him up in his arms and blessed
[9:36] God and said he didn't bless the baby he
[9:39] blessed God and said
[9:41] Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart
[9:44] in peace according to thy word for mine
[9:48] eyes have seen thy salvation I love
[9:52] Simeon I love what God did for Simeon he
[9:58] he gave him a promise that he was going
[10:00] to see the mushy och he was going to see
[10:03] the coming of the Lord salvation and he
[10:06] waited patiently and one day the Spirit
[10:09] of the Lord led Simeon to the temple and
[10:12] there he found in the court he found
[10:15] Yosef and Miriam he found them with this
[10:18] little baby he held the baby in his arms
[10:20] and immediately the Holy Spirit of God
[10:23] that was in Simeon bore witness with the
[10:27] spirit of god that was even in that
[10:29] little child Yeshua and he recognized
[10:33] this is the promise this is the coming
[10:36] how many thousands of people over the
[10:41] years in the life in the lifetime of
[10:45] Jesus and in the in the two thousand
[10:47] years that have followed have come in
[10:50] contact with him in one way or another
[10:52] but were not able to recognize who he
[10:55] was and yet simeon by the Holy Spirit
[10:58] knew that salvation had come to the
[11:02] household of Israel and he was holding
[11:05] it in his arms I love that I love what
[11:08] God was doing this witness in this
[11:11] testimony for Simeon mine eyes in verse
[11:14] 30 have seen thy salvation which thou
[11:18] has prepared before the face of all
[11:20] people a light to lighten the Gentiles
[11:23] and the glory of thy people Israel do
[11:27] you hear do you hear that even Simeon
[11:31] recognized that Yeshua was both Messiah
[11:35] and glory to the chosen house of Israel
[11:39] but he was also come as a light to the
[11:42] Gentiles I love the revelation that this
[11:45] old man had and Joseph and his mother
[11:50] verse 33 marveled at those things which
[11:53] were spoken of he
[11:55] now Joseph and Mary had had an angelic
[11:58] visitation to announce the significance
[12:01] of this child the details of his
[12:04] conception and even what his name should
[12:07] be and yet when they encountered Simeon
[12:11] they were amazed at the declarations
[12:14] that came out of his mouth concerning
[12:16] the little child that they had carried
[12:18] in their arms up to the Temple in
[12:21] Jerusalem verse 34 and Simeon blessed
[12:24] them and said unto Mary Miriam his
[12:28] mother behold this child is set for the
[12:32] fall and the rising of many in Israel
[12:36] and for a sign which shall be spoken
[12:41] against yay verse 35 listen carefully
[12:45] yay a sword shall pierce through thy own
[12:50] soul also that the thoughts of many
[12:53] hearts may be revealed this was a
[12:57] prophecy concerning the end of his life
[13:01] this was a prophecy concerning the
[13:03] heartache that Miriam would experience
[13:06] as her own son that she loved so much
[13:10] and that such profound words of promise
[13:15] had been spoken over his little life
[13:17] this was a prophecy from Simeon from the
[13:20] Holy Spirit through Simeon to mother and
[13:23] daddy to say there's going to be
[13:26] suffering there's going to be heartache
[13:28] many will reject him many will not
[13:31] receive him many will despise him and so
[13:35] this was both a glorious day and also a
[13:38] sad day verse 36 continues with another
[13:43] very special character a very special
[13:46] lady and there was one Anna who was a
[13:49] prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of
[13:52] the tribe of Asher she was of a great
[13:55] age and had lived with a husband seven
[13:59] years from her virginity and she was a
[14:02] widow of about four score and four years
[14:06] now you think about that
[14:08] 84 years which departed not from the
[14:12] temple but served God with fastings and
[14:16] prayers night and day this must have
[14:19] been a precious woman Anna dedicated to
[14:23] God who had been a widow most of her
[14:26] life but had not remarried but at chosen
[14:30] rather to serve God with fasting and
[14:33] prayers in the temple and she coming in
[14:37] I don't believe it was accident all the
[14:40] hundreds of people that were bringing
[14:42] their babies up to Jerusalem all of the
[14:44] activity that was going on in and around
[14:47] the temple courtyard I believe that it
[14:49] was a divine appointment that had Anna
[14:52] there that day and at the right place at
[14:54] the right time to meet Mary and Joseph
[14:57] and perhaps she saw what was going on
[15:00] when Simeon had the baby in his arms and
[15:03] she coming in that instant gay thanks
[15:07] likewise unto the Lord and spake of him
[15:10] to all them that looked for redemption
[15:13] in Jerusalem and when they had performed
[15:17] all things according to the law of the
[15:19] Lord they returned into Galilee to their
[15:23] own city Nazareth and the child grew and
[15:27] waxed strong filled with wisdom and the
[15:32] grace of God was upon him this was one
[15:36] of the first major milestones in this
[15:41] growth this development of the ministry
[15:45] that had been given to the Lord Jesus
[15:47] Christ he was just a little baby at this
[15:50] point but after being circumcised and
[15:53] and his mother passing the days of her
[15:57] purification now she has brought him to
[15:59] Jerusalem to offer him to the Lord and
[16:02] to fulfill what the law had required of
[16:05] the male the firstborn male child and
[16:09] encountered encountered that day was a
[16:13] Simeon and Anna and this was like an
[16:16] announcement I'm telling you Simeon
[16:18] didn't whisper and Anna wasn't
[16:20] whispering this was an announced
[16:22] to those who would listen that God has
[16:25] kept his word that he has been faithful
[16:28] to do exactly what it is that he said he
[16:32] would do then in in the Hebrew culture
[16:36] there was a second milestone on the way
[16:39] to full manhood our full maturity and
[16:44] that is what we would call a Bar Mitzvah
[16:48] which means an accountable son a son
[16:52] accountable or a son of the Commandant
[16:56] the Mitzvah which jesus also publicly
[16:59] celebrated in the temple at the age of
[17:02] 12 years old now this marks a time when
[17:07] a son was able to become an apprentice
[17:10] for his father in the family business
[17:13] now we know from the scripture that
[17:15] Yosef was a carpenter so at about the
[17:19] age of 12 a son was able to step up into
[17:23] a position of being an apprentice to
[17:26] learn the trade of his father this is
[17:29] why Jesus gave the declaration that he
[17:33] gave in Luke chapter 2 and and I'm going
[17:38] to read it I think I have time to read
[17:40] it to you Luke two verses 41 through 52
[17:45] continuing on from where we were now his
[17:48] parents went to Jerusalem every year at
[17:51] the feast of pesach or Passover and when
[17:56] he was 12 years old they went up to
[17:59] Jerusalem after the custom of the feast
[18:02] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[18:04] they returned the child Yeshua Jesus
[18:08] tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph
[18:12] and his mother knew not it they didn't
[18:16] recognize that he had stayed behind
[18:18] somebody said now how could this happen
[18:20] with a 12 year old child well look at
[18:23] the next verse but they supposing him to
[18:26] have been in the company meaning in the
[18:28] crowd of relatives that were all making
[18:31] their way the pilgrims who had made
[18:33] their way up
[18:34] to Jerusalem for for the for the feast
[18:36] of Pesach or the feast of unleavened
[18:38] bread pass over time now they're making
[18:41] their way back and they would they would
[18:43] go the children would go from from
[18:46] little group to group and among cousins
[18:48] and relatives and so forth and they just
[18:50] assume that he was somewhere in the line
[18:52] coming along with the crowd but when
[18:54] they recognized that he wasn't there
[18:57] after they had gone a whole day's
[18:59] journey they sought him among their
[19:02] kinsfolk and acquaintances but verse 44
[19:06] verse 45 and when they found him not
[19:09] they turned back again to Jerusalem
[19:12] seeking him what's happened to him they
[19:15] must have been concerned about him at
[19:17] this point and it came to pass that
[19:19] after three days they found him in the
[19:22] temple can you imagine three days he was
[19:24] missing they found him in the temple
[19:26] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[19:29] hearing them and asking them questions
[19:31] now these were not medical doctors these
[19:35] were the learning of the law these were
[19:38] were the officials are the chief rabbis
[19:41] and here was this 12 year old boy
[19:44] sitting there talking to them and asking
[19:48] them questions and he must have not just
[19:50] been asking questions there must have
[19:53] been something else to it because verse
[19:55] 47 said and all that heard him were
[19:59] astonished at his understanding and
[20:02] answers so he wasn't just asking he was
[20:05] also giving profound answers to the
[20:09] questions of the rabbis and verse 48 and
[20:13] when they saw him they were amazed and
[20:16] his mother said unto Him son why has
[20:19] thou dust dealt with us behold thy
[20:22] father and I have sought thee sorrowing
[20:24] I'd say that's to put it mildly wouldn't
[20:28] you she probably scolded him quite
[20:30] proper what are you doing you supposed
[20:33] to be with us and you've been missing
[20:35] and we were worried sick about you verse
[20:38] 49 listen and his response this speaks
[20:42] to us of the Hebrew custom of a child
[20:46] who had
[20:47] reach the age of 12 becoming an
[20:49] apprentice this speaks of that and he
[20:53] said unto them how is it that she sought
[20:56] me whiskey not that I must be about my
[21:01] father's business now he's 12 years old
[21:05] he's reached this age whereby he can be
[21:09] trained now as an apprentice for his
[21:12] father now I don't think he was there in
[21:16] the temple that those three days
[21:18] learning how to be a carpenter like
[21:20] Joseph do you know he wasn't talking
[21:23] about his earthly father he was talking
[21:25] about his Heavenly Father how is it that
[21:28] you sought me so whisked you not don't
[21:31] you wish don't you know don't you
[21:33] understand that I must be busy doing the
[21:37] business of my father and they
[21:41] understood not the saying which he spake
[21:44] unto them and he whipped down with them
[21:47] and came to Nazareth and was subject
[21:49] unto them but his mother kept all these
[21:52] sayings in her heart she knew there was
[21:56] something unusual going on with this boy
[21:58] and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[22:02] stature and in favor with God in man
[22:07] after these first two milestones in his
[22:10] life we read that he increased with
[22:14] wisdom and in favour and in stature also
[22:18] physical form and in favor with God and
[22:21] man we could say that this would have
[22:24] been very similar to what Jewish young
[22:27] people celebrate today about the same
[22:30] time called a Bar Mitzvah for a son or a
[22:35] bat mitzvah for a daughter a time of
[22:39] reaching an age of accountability
[22:43] circumcision says that a son is marked
[22:46] as a son of the Covenant a son of the
[22:48] commandment but here we have Bar Mitzvah
[22:51] or in this in this regard it was the age
[22:55] that a before there was a
[22:58] really a Bar Mitzvah this was Jesus
[23:00] coming at twelve which was the known age
[23:04] for a son to take on the apprenticeship
[23:08] of the profession of his father and I
[23:11] believe Jesus learned carpentry from
[23:13] joseph i do but i don't believe that's
[23:15] what this is talking about he was
[23:17] teaching from the wisdom of god he was
[23:19] doing the business of his father he was
[23:23] practicing the purpose for which he was
[23:26] born and I love that I love those
[23:29] developments we've got the infancy eight
[23:31] days old and a little bit beyond now
[23:33] we've got 12 years old he's in the
[23:36] temple baffling the teachers finally
[23:39] there is the third step or milestone
[23:42] that we call Hafeez heeya and that is
[23:46] the combination of the two Greek words
[23:48] Huell fisa which was celebrated around
[23:53] the age of 30 and it marks the accepted
[23:58] age of maturity in Second Temple period
[24:02] time this occurred in the life of Jesus
[24:05] at the beginning of his ministry when he
[24:08] was baptized by John as we read that was
[24:13] the beginning of this Hugh officia
[24:15] process I believe that it consummated it
[24:19] began at his baptism in the Jordan River
[24:22] but i believe the consummation of and
[24:25] what does that word mean again if you
[24:27] combine Hughes and thesis what does that
[24:30] word mean it means the placing of a watt
[24:33] maturer son no longer just a little baby
[24:37] being circumcised or presented at the
[24:40] temple no longer a 12 year old boy
[24:43] baffling the minds of the teachers while
[24:47] he comes to worship God at Passover or
[24:50] Pesach but now there is an announcement
[24:54] that has been made in the Jordan River
[24:56] as we read in both this program and the
[24:59] last this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[25:04] pleased to dwell that was the beginning
[25:08] of this Hugh officia
[25:10] and you know the pronunciation is a
[25:13] little bit difficult but it's not
[25:15] important whether or not you and I can
[25:18] pronounce the Greek exactly like it it
[25:20] should be it is important that we get
[25:23] the message that we get the concept that
[25:26] Jesus now has come to that place that we
[25:29] read about in Hebrews chapter 5 he's
[25:31] learning obedience by the things that he
[25:35] has suffered that word that we've talked
[25:38] about means son placement the placing of
[25:42] a son not just any age of a son but
[25:46] amateur son and that indicates a time
[25:48] when a male child reached what was
[25:51] considered to be the age of full
[25:54] maturity there was quite a celebration
[25:57] at 12 and it was also a public
[26:00] celebration and the neighbors were told
[26:02] the Sun is old enough now he's going to
[26:05] learn the trade of his father he's going
[26:07] to be doing some business on my behalf
[26:10] we after doing a lot of research we find
[26:14] out that among the merchants they were
[26:17] told my son is 12 but he's an apprentice
[26:20] he's can come and pick up some supplies
[26:23] he can do some things but of course a
[26:26] twelve-year-old is not as mature as
[26:29] someone would hopefully be at the age of
[26:32] 30 so he had some level of maturity and
[26:37] some level of authority at 12 but he
[26:41] didn't come to that full measure where
[26:44] we often say it would be like his name
[26:47] on the check would be the same as his
[26:50] father's name now they didn't write
[26:52] checks in those days but you understand
[26:54] at 30 he would if he had proven himself
[26:57] remember we talked about the scripture
[27:00] that speaks of tutors and governors if
[27:02] he had proven himself he would now have
[27:05] the authority to conduct full business
[27:07] now we're going to start getting into
[27:09] some interesting things I appreciate you
[27:11] listening to this study today father we
[27:14] just ask that you would continue to
[27:16] reveal yourself to us from your word we
[27:19] love
[27:20] reading today of the three milestones
[27:23] major milestones in your life for
[27:27] including the Transfiguration which was
[27:30] sort of like the ceiling of the placing
[27:34] of amateur son father we want that in
[27:37] our own lives and we ask you for grace
[27:39] to come to maturity in the wonderful
[27:42] name of Jesus Yeshua we pray amen thank
[27:45] you for watching the Eagles cry you got
