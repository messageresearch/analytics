[30:46] he reigns he sits above it all
[30:50] you may be seated this morning it's
[30:52] wonderful
[30:53] to enter into the presence of the lord
[30:55] again
[30:56] and worship him because he is worthy
[31:00] he is worthy to be praised if you
[31:03] believe that
[31:04] say amen we want to go to the lord in
[31:07] prayer
[31:08] there are many who need to be lifted up
[31:10] to the lord in prayer today
[31:12] and we want to do our part to agree with
[31:15] them for
[31:15] healing and for provision and for
[31:19] direction
[31:20] and whatever the deeds might be we ask
[31:23] that you would remember the service
[31:25] today in lagrange that the lord
[31:27] will continue to move and bless
[31:31] and strengthen and help and heal
[31:34] and provide and we just believe
[31:38] that the lord is going to help them
[31:40] sister anita yesterday
[31:42] they had come home after the service
[31:45] friday night because brother
[31:46] curry likes to be in his own bed
[31:50] and uh getting ready to get in the
[31:52] vehicle to go
[31:53] last night she got a bee sting or a wasp
[31:57] sting or something and uh she's used
[32:01] benadryl
[32:02] and oils and prayer and she said she
[32:04] still woke up this morning with red
[32:06] splotches from her
[32:08] head to her feet and i told her she
[32:11] would still be radiant
[32:14] even with red splotches i knew the lord
[32:16] would shine out of her life he has
[32:18] certainly done that
[32:19] in these past few services so we want to
[32:22] ask the lord
[32:23] to do something about that allergic
[32:25] reaction and give her victory over it
[32:27] because if it's that bad sometimes it
[32:29] makes you feel
[32:30] different you can feel something going
[32:32] on in your body
[32:35] may god give her grace we saw the lord
[32:38] i don't think there's anybody who were
[32:40] in any of the meetings
[32:42] who couldn't say without any doubt we
[32:45] saw the lord
[32:46] building up brother steve service
[32:50] last sunday night he was at one of the
[32:52] lowest points that i've ever seen him
[32:55] and as the service went on he began to
[32:57] feel better
[32:58] he didn't look a whole lot better but he
[33:00] began to feel a lot better
[33:02] and beginning monday morning all the way
[33:05] through the week god began to build him
[33:07] up
[33:08] and strengthen him i heard from them
[33:10] every day
[33:11] they got a they were in for something
[33:14] they have to go several times
[33:16] this week they had to go to the cancer
[33:18] center and uh they were doing
[33:20] something and they got word that the new
[33:23] oncologist wanted to see them at a
[33:25] certain time the next day
[33:26] it's hard to hear news like that
[33:28] unexpected and your heart not sync
[33:32] so she sister anita immediately reached
[33:34] out and said please pray
[33:36] we know that we have to go and we have
[33:38] to see what's going on
[33:40] and i think it was friday maybe that
[33:42] they ended up being there before the
[33:44] service that night
[33:45] is is that right i think it is and uh
[33:48] the oncologist a new oncologist that
[33:51] they'd only seen one time before
[33:53] in the course of their conversation
[33:57] he said to her said to brother steve i
[33:59] am a god-sent
[34:01] doctor to you and you know that that's
[34:05] somebody said well that kind of sounds
[34:07] arrogant no
[34:08] no no no not to me maybe you take it
[34:10] that way
[34:11] i took it with somebody confident and uh
[34:14] he said he believed in the power of
[34:16] prayer forgive me for leaning
[34:18] i'm just trying to rest my sciatic nerve
[34:22] it's been busy in the car this week um
[34:25] let me just tell you this you just got
[34:27] to hear it there's no
[34:28] no need to pray and pray and pray and
[34:30] not know that it's making a difference
[34:33] and so this was on friday at 4
[34:36] 30 service starting at 7. we're
[34:39] currently getting his fluids via iv
[34:42] received good news even though he hadn't
[34:45] had chemo in two months
[34:47] we have not lost any ground gain prior
[34:51] to the hospital stays his system was
[34:54] getting so weak
[34:55] that they they stopped doing the chemo
[34:58] and
[34:59] there was great uh anticipation
[35:02] speculation that the tumor would
[35:04] increase in size
[35:06] when it was not being blasted by the
[35:09] chemo
[35:10] and that it might even perhaps spread
[35:12] beyond its perimeter
[35:14] but i want you to know the news was it
[35:16] has not moved
[35:17] on no there was no shrinkage
[35:21] but such minimal movement in the tumor
[35:24] that they were very impressed at what
[35:27] had happened
[35:28] you know we're we're believing that god
[35:30] is keeping it at bay
[35:32] until he moves it i'm not satisfied with
[35:35] that but i'm going to praise god for
[35:37] that
[35:38] the numbers are what they watch they
[35:41] were concerned at the cea
[35:43] and the cancer markers would start
[35:45] rising without treatment
[35:46] but there was barely a change at all
[35:49] which means it's completely remaining
[35:51] contained
[35:53] they're scheduling a ct scan in three
[35:55] weeks and now they're going to focus on
[35:57] rebuilding
[35:58] his system with fluids with concentrated
[36:00] nutrition
[36:01] iron injections and all of these other
[36:04] treatments to help cause his bone marrow
[36:07] to start reproducing
[36:09] more and to do it correctly to reproduce
[36:13] good cells his weight loss to hydration
[36:16] and anemia
[36:17] have been concerns of the doctor they
[36:19] want to target that now
[36:20] their sides side effects of the chemo
[36:23] and the anti-fungal meds and even the
[36:25] blood thinner
[36:26] that he's on and
[36:28] [Music]
[36:29] anyway dr akbar told stephen that he was
[36:31] a god-sent physician
[36:33] who would be praying for him he believes
[36:35] that it's all up to god how long a
[36:37] person lives
[36:38] he was really lecturing him on his
[36:40] appetite and food intake but with gentle
[36:42] concern
[36:43] his words were i believe we can help you
[36:46] to live another 52 years
[36:48] if god wills it
[36:56] we have to thank god for that we
[36:59] wouldn't want our brother to live 52
[37:01] years in the condition that he's in
[37:03] right now
[37:04] but we don't believe he has to stay that
[37:06] way so we're
[37:08] really now listen he came to the service
[37:11] friday night already looking better
[37:13] he climbed up on the music and played
[37:15] some which sunday night he was not able
[37:17] to do
[37:18] he had not been eating hardly anything
[37:20] at all
[37:21] and it was hard he was drinking insurers
[37:24] and whatever the other one is
[37:26] uh he would just pick at his food
[37:29] but friday night they went through a
[37:32] park at wendy's parking lot or whatever
[37:34] it was drive-through and
[37:36] uh no it was a cookout where we were
[37:40] and he got a meal and she got a meal he
[37:43] ate all of his hamburger
[37:45] which was a miracle he said to us last
[37:48] night i used to take a bite and that's
[37:49] it i don't want no more
[37:50] ate all of his meal and started helping
[37:52] her eat her meal
[37:55] then he testified that one thing he had
[37:57] a real
[37:58] uh diverse what
[38:01] a aversion uh was eggs
[38:05] and um he said that couldn't stand the
[38:08] thought
[38:08] i want you to know if somebody don't
[38:10] feel good their stomach don't feel good
[38:12] eggs are not something i crave either
[38:15] he said he couldn't stand the thought of
[38:17] an egg but he woke up saturday morning
[38:19] after being touched friday night and
[38:21] eating a hamburger
[38:22] and he ate two scrambled egg sandwiches
[38:25] two
[38:27] and uh so by last night his color was
[38:30] good
[38:31] and his strength was good he crawled up
[38:33] on the music he talked more than he'd
[38:35] been talking
[38:36] and was prayed for again in the service
[38:39] and the lord really has touched him
[38:41] so would you continue to pray that god
[38:44] will strengthen him and give him victory
[38:47] according to his will it's a very
[38:49] difficult situation there because those
[38:51] people love them so much and
[38:53] and they're just trying to fill in and
[38:55] they're and they're trying to do it
[38:57] delicately because they want him to know
[38:59] he's the pastor
[39:01] and yet they just work together as a
[39:03] little team i want to thank you
[39:05] i know i'm taking a moment i can do that

[49:19] [Music]
[49:21] yes he is you may be seated this morning
[49:25] we've got to hurry along
[49:27] because we want brother greeley to have
[49:29] plenty of time to preach whatever god
[49:31] has placed on his heart
[49:34] as a body as a congregation we want to
[49:37] say to aunt deborah
[49:39] how sorry we are for your loss i think
[49:42] you know how faithfully we all prayed
[49:45] we really prayed and we saw the lord
[49:48] move didn't we
[49:49] and somehow in his sovereign will he
[49:51] just said i'm going to come and take her
[49:53] now
[49:54] it looked like from what i understand
[49:56] from the family and i saw the service i
[49:59] i was comforted and touched by the
[50:01] service the memorial for crystal i
[50:03] appreciated
[50:04] the ability the technology to be able to
[50:06] be there through the stream
[50:08] and if i understand from the family
[50:11] right her living
[50:12] her her quality of life had been so
[50:15] greatly reduced that they would have
[50:18] liked to have kept her
[50:19] many many many many years if she could
[50:21] have had a good quality of life
[50:23] but that was not returning to her and uh
[50:27] you know sometimes that's so hard
[50:30] when you see someone that ought to be
[50:32] about young and
[50:33] strong and and you see that they're
[50:35] really and it's hard on a person to have
[50:38] to be cared for
[50:39] it's it's nice a day or two to be waited
[50:41] on and taken care of but after a while
[50:44] it's it's humiliating and it's degrading
[50:47] and it's hard
[50:48] so we're we're going to continue to pray
[50:50] for the whole family but i wanted you to
[50:52] know as a body we've all
[50:54] certainly prayed for the family in the
[50:56] same fervor that we prayed for crystal
[50:59] i want you to prepare to give your tithe
[51:02] an offering to the lord today
[51:04] this is the the normal offering that we
[51:06] would take on any
[51:08] service for the tithe and the offering
[51:10] we want to give is unto the lord we see
[51:12] what god
[51:13] is doing and we want to give him thanks
[51:15] when brother greeley comes he will
[51:18] receive the offering for the principal
[51:20] payment it's the first sunday of the
[51:21] month
[51:22] we're giving god thanks for what he has
[51:24] done
[51:25] and you know there's just hardly two
[51:27] services that come that
[51:29] that it doesn't grow a little bit now it
[51:31] only grew 30 dollars from tuesday night
[51:33] till today but you know what
[51:35] that still blesses me it blesses me
[51:39] sister joyce did you see the picture i
[51:41] sent you before service did you happen
[51:43] to see it no

[51:53] you're so sweet
[51:55] uh in that sweet sister joyce
[52:02] now tell me again she's she's a
[52:06] cousin i should have known that right
[52:11] this is april walls and
[52:14] we know of the family through sister
[52:17] joyce and they prayed for her
[52:19] sister joyce made some aprons for her
[52:21] mother and uh i opened a card today i'm
[52:24] thinking who do i know in richlands
[52:25] virginia
[52:26] and i open it up and it was from sister
[52:29] joyce's cousin a 50
[52:31] check an offering for the church and she
[52:34] said
[52:35] uh that sister george made these aprons
[52:37] and she said we wanted to bless
[52:39] a ministry that she cares about so here
[52:41] is a
[52:42] an offering and you know that's just so
[52:44] thoughtful
[52:46] perfect timing because i labeled it it's
[52:48] already in the bag
[52:49] and labeled for the principle so in god
[52:53] good he's good amen
[52:57] let's see nathan and chad how about you
[53:00] all coming to receive the tithe and
[53:02] offering this morning
[53:04] we're going to come to you we want you
[53:06] to give as unto the lord
[53:08] and just know that if you have a
[53:09] separate uh
[53:11] offering for the principal save that for
[53:13] just a moment
[53:14] sometimes people include it on their
[53:16] check that's perfectly all right we can
[53:18] divide it but it makes it easier
[53:20] if we can have it in separate in
[53:22] separate offerings it makes the
[53:24] bookkeeping a little
[53:25] easier but we will uh just be honest
[53:28] with you we'll take it however you give
[53:29] it
[53:30] we'll take it in pennies because the
[53:33] novus is getting it we're giving it to

[55:58] and so we want to send our love to
[56:00] sister west today
[56:02] and let her know that we'll be thinking
[56:03] about her and
[56:05] we've so enjoyed these last times that
[56:07] she's been able to come down
[56:09] it's a little hard to say goodbye to her
[56:11] on a sunday afternoon
[56:13] knowing that she has so far to drive by
[56:16] herself
[56:17] but she's always so sweet to text stacy
[56:20] and say i made it
[56:21] i made it and she wouldn't consider not
[56:23] coming as often as she possibly can
[56:26] because she enjoys the fellowship being
[56:28] with us and i'm thankful
[56:30] that we can that we can have her we have
[56:32] a special treat this morning
[56:34] and that is that ben and zoe
[56:37] and abigail are going to sing for us is
[56:40] that right
[56:42] so let's worship the lord as they sing

[57:21] [Music]
[57:24] morning
[57:33] go plead with your mother
[57:36] with the words of hosea
[57:40] as he sent his children to extend his
[57:44] mercy so
[57:47] they journeyed down the old path
[57:51] that led to much destruction
[57:54] and all the while their loving hearts
[57:58] were hurting
[58:01] their hope was crushed inside
[58:04] as their compassion was denied
[58:08] the woman they so loved seemed like
[58:12] a stranger
[58:15] heartbroken and alone
[58:18] they took the long road home
[58:22] for sitting now rain hope seemed going
[58:26] to change

[59:13] could hear but he
[59:16] through judgment take her life

[1:04:10] it's true would you stand again
[1:04:13] we're going to welcome brother greeley
[1:04:15] to come and share
[1:04:17] whatever it is that the lord has placed
[1:04:19] on his heart
[1:04:20] to inspire us he's going to receive the
[1:04:24] the monthly principle offering for the
[1:04:26] for the church property
[1:04:28] and he's going to give us the word and
[1:04:31] we're not looking for a lesson we're
[1:04:33] looking for whatever god
[1:04:35] has for us today if it's edification
[1:04:39] well it'll
[1:04:39] always be edifying even if it's
[1:04:41] corrective but whatever god
[1:04:43] has that's what we want and the only
[1:04:46] expectation we have is that he will
[1:04:48] obey the lord amen and that's really
[1:04:52] what we desire today lord we
[1:04:54] ask you in the mighty precious name of
[1:04:57] jesus
[1:04:58] that you will use our brother for your
[1:05:01] glory today let there be no
[1:05:05] hindering spirits able to break
[1:05:08] through the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:05:11] let it speak directly to our lives
[1:05:14] let us leave here with a desire to walk
[1:05:17] closer to you
[1:05:19] to live a higher life being ascended
[1:05:23] with you in glory
[1:05:24] we thank you for your servant today and
[1:05:27] we ask that your mighty hand be upon him
[1:05:30] as you minister to your bride here and
[1:05:33] around the world
[1:05:35] in the wonderful name of the lord jesus
[1:05:37] christ we pray
[1:05:39] amen do you mind if i just receive you
[1:05:42] without a song
[1:05:43] and you just go ahead from there god
[1:05:45] bless you
[1:05:56] i didn't necessarily have to receive
[1:05:58] this principal offering
[1:06:02] but i'm going to give you some
[1:06:03] information
[1:06:06] and perhaps it'll help you with your own
[1:06:09] finances at home we started this journey
[1:06:13] in march of this year
[1:06:16] when the lord spoke to us that he wanted
[1:06:18] us to
[1:06:19] get rid of the debt on this property
[1:06:21] that
[1:06:23] we had to make a concentrated effort to
[1:06:25] get rid of the debt
[1:06:27] by god's grace that's what we have done
[1:06:29] and that's what we are doing
[1:06:31] we continue to do that when we started
[1:06:34] this journey
[1:06:35] in in march the uh
[1:06:39] the pr the they call it the current
[1:06:42] mortgage balance i don't want to scare
[1:06:45] you i'm just going to give you some
[1:06:46] numbers here but the current mortgage
[1:06:48] balance at that time was at 480 000
[1:06:52] plus at this moment
[1:06:56] the current mortgage balance is at 360
[1:07:01] 379 000
[1:07:04] and we give god praise that it is at
[1:07:07] this point
[1:07:15] you have given one hundred and eighteen
[1:07:18] thousand
[1:07:18] seven hundred and fifty four dollars and
[1:07:21] ninety five
[1:07:23] cents one hundred and eighteen thousand
[1:07:24] seven hundred and fifty four
[1:07:26] ninety 95 as of today
[1:07:30] and so i want you i'm going to say this
[1:07:33] because it may help you somewhere along
[1:07:36] the way with your own home
[1:07:38] that you put your mind to paying off
[1:07:40] your own mortgage as well
[1:07:42] but i want you to notice that we have
[1:07:45] given one hundred and eighteen thousand
[1:07:47] dollars directly to the principal
[1:07:49] and if you do any calculation you
[1:07:52] realize
[1:07:53] that we also made some four thousand
[1:07:57] dollar payments
[1:08:01] four or five forty one hundred
[1:08:04] four or five payments since march
[1:08:08] where did it go
[1:08:11] where did that 20 000 worth of payments
[1:08:14] go
[1:08:18] interest all right
[1:08:21] so january of this year the interest was
[1:08:25] at two thousand two hundred and eighty
[1:08:26] six dollars per month
[1:08:29] at this point the interest has come down
[1:08:32] almost
[1:08:32] exactly six hundred dollars since
[1:08:35] january
[1:08:36] that means the interest is now at 1 687
[1:08:42] so because we have faithfully
[1:08:45] paid on the principle it has brought the
[1:08:48] interest down that much that means
[1:08:50] more of the payment is going to the
[1:08:52] mortgage i'm not doing this to
[1:08:55] uh to get upset about i'm
[1:08:58] showing you that this is how mortgage uh
[1:09:01] works i don't understand all of the what
[1:09:04] is the word
[1:09:05] amortization uh i don't understand all
[1:09:08] of that all i know
[1:09:09] is the bank is out to make money
[1:09:12] and they want to make a lot of it at the
[1:09:15] very beginning
[1:09:17] so one year from now this loan
[1:09:20] will have to be refinanced but by the
[1:09:22] grace of god
[1:09:23] and his mercy i am looking for this
[1:09:26] mortgage to be
[1:09:27] gone in the name of the lord jesus
[1:09:32] christ
[1:09:36] that's the reason i gave you all of
[1:09:37] those numbers because we're one year
[1:09:39] away from having to refinance but by the
[1:09:42] grace of god and his help
[1:09:43] i'm looking to not have to refinance
[1:09:46] that's what we're looking for
[1:09:48] we don't want to refinance the property
[1:09:50] the mortgage
[1:09:51] we want it to be paid off so we're just
[1:09:53] going to do our part to faithfully give
[1:09:56] as the lord blesses us we're going to
[1:09:58] give according to what we have
[1:10:00] uh we don't want anybody to go into debt
[1:10:03] to help to pay this property off no
[1:10:05] that's not what we're after
[1:10:06] god's able to take care of his business
[1:10:09] and he's able to speak to us directly
[1:10:11] and he's able to help us to get this
[1:10:13] paid off and here's what i believe
[1:10:16] if we are faithful to put a concentrated
[1:10:19] effort in paying this property off i
[1:10:22] believe that
[1:10:23] somewhere around this world that god has
[1:10:26] somebody that can give us a boost
[1:10:30] when we need it that's what i believe
[1:10:33] so if you've brought your offering with
[1:10:34] you today i want you to hold it in your
[1:10:36] hand
[1:10:38] or pray over it and ask the lord to as
[1:10:41] you give with purpose
[1:10:42] that he would bless you and that it
[1:10:44] would be multiplied father
[1:10:46] i want to thank you for your
[1:10:49] faithfulness to us
[1:10:51] this is far above and beyond our ability
[1:10:55] but it's not above yours
[1:10:56] and so we want to say thank you for what
[1:10:59] has been given
[1:11:00] and i want to thank you for what your
[1:11:02] people have brought with them today
[1:11:04] for this principle offering and we give
[1:11:07] it with gladness to you
[1:11:10] to see the word of the lord fulfilled in
[1:11:13] our
[1:11:13] in our time god the promises that you
[1:11:16] have made
[1:11:17] to us and to this property we want to
[1:11:20] see it fulfilled
[1:11:22] now god i pray that you will let your
[1:11:24] blessing be upon
[1:11:26] the giver may it be multiplied for the
[1:11:28] purpose of the kingdom
[1:11:30] god i pray that you would multiply it in
[1:11:33] the lives of the believers
[1:11:35] as they give lord with purpose that
[1:11:38] they'll see a bountiful harvest
[1:11:40] and it'll make them want to keep giving
[1:11:42] and giving and giving
[1:11:44] that's just who you are i bless you and
[1:11:47] give you praise for it's in the name of
[1:11:49] the lord jesus christ
[1:11:50] we pray amen amen david will you come
[1:11:54] and hold the offering bag
[1:11:56] we'll let the people bring their gift to
[1:11:58] the lord

[1:14:35] here from verse 1
[1:14:39] and there shall come forth a rod
[1:14:42] out of the stem of jesse and a branch
[1:14:45] shall grow out of his roots
[1:14:48] and the spirit of the lord shall rest
[1:14:50] upon him
[1:14:52] the spirit of wisdom and understanding
[1:14:56] the spirit of counsel and might
[1:15:00] the spirit of knowledge and of the fear
[1:15:03] of the lord
[1:15:05] and shall make him of quick
[1:15:06] understanding in the fear of the lord
[1:15:09] and he shall not judge after the sight
[1:15:12] of his eyes
[1:15:13] neither reprove after the hearing of his
[1:15:16] ears
[1:15:16] but with the righteous but with
[1:15:18] righteousness
[1:15:20] shall he judge the poor and reprove with
[1:15:24] equity for the meek of the earth
[1:15:27] and he shall smite the earth with the
[1:15:29] rod of his mouth and with the breath
[1:15:32] of his lips shall he slay the wicked
[1:15:35] and righteousness shall be the girdle of
[1:15:38] his loins

[1:15:59] here today
[1:16:01] with saints of like precious faith and
[1:16:04] lord we're streaming around the world
[1:16:07] to different nations and so we just want
[1:16:11] to bless your people wherever they are
[1:16:13] and as they tune in to hear the word of
[1:16:16] the lord today
[1:16:17] god we want to be tuned in to the holy
[1:16:20] spirit
[1:16:21] and what the spirit of the lord would
[1:16:24] say to us in this
[1:16:25] hour god i am asking you
[1:16:28] to once again hide your servant behind
[1:16:32] your cross the the work of the cross
[1:16:35] lord i pray that you will speak to us
[1:16:39] and you do and say what you want to in

[1:16:46] praise
[1:16:47] for it's in the name of the lord jesus
[1:16:49] christ we pray
[1:16:51] amen you may have your seats today
[1:17:07] i'm going to be like the white house
[1:17:08] press secretary and i'm going to circle
[1:17:10] back to
[1:17:10] isaiah 11 after a while
[1:17:17] i'd like hebrews chapter 12
[1:17:21] in the amplified hebrews
[1:17:24] chapter 12
[1:17:27] and verse 11
[1:17:31] hebrews chapter 12 and verse 11
[1:17:34] in the amplified for the time
[1:17:38] being no discipline
[1:17:42] brings joy but seems grievous
[1:17:46] and painful but afterwards it yields a
[1:17:50] peaceable fruit of righteousness to
[1:17:53] those
[1:17:54] who have been trained by it
[1:17:58] a harvest of fruit which consists in
[1:18:00] righteousness
[1:18:02] in conformity to god's will and purpose
[1:18:05] thought
[1:18:05] and action resulting in right living
[1:18:10] and right standing
[1:18:14] now brother shelley has been preaching
[1:18:17] to us
[1:18:19] about these he's called them offices of
[1:18:22] the holy spirit
[1:18:24] and so you may hear some things that
[1:18:28] he's been saying it's just part of
[1:18:31] what you listen to
[1:18:35] and when you listen to something that
[1:18:37] starts coming out
[1:18:40] but one of the
[1:18:43] offices that he has been talking about
[1:18:47] was the spirit of truth which we find in
[1:18:51] john chapter 16. but the
[1:18:54] the disciples were
[1:18:58] instructed we find in the book of john
[1:19:02] that the disciples were instructed at
[1:19:06] passover time jesus told them
[1:19:09] to go and into the city
[1:19:13] and they were to look for a certain man
[1:19:17] and they jesus described to them
[1:19:20] what this man would look like and what
[1:19:23] he would be doing
[1:19:24] and he told them follow that man because
[1:19:28] that man is going to have the key he's
[1:19:31] going to have the
[1:19:32] the access to a room
[1:19:35] that we need for the passover seder
[1:19:39] and so the the guys they the disciples
[1:19:43] they did as jesus instructed
[1:19:46] and they went and they found this man
[1:19:50] and they found the room that jesus was
[1:19:53] describing to them
[1:19:55] the book of john does not record it thus
[1:19:59] but the book of mark and luke record
[1:20:03] that it was a large upper room
[1:20:06] where that they went to now the
[1:20:09] scripture does not spell it out
[1:20:11] but i think it's a pretty neat idea to
[1:20:14] think
[1:20:15] that these men as they went to this
[1:20:18] large upper room
[1:20:19] and they gathered for the last supper as
[1:20:23] we have come to call it uh the pale
[1:20:25] the pace pesach the passover seder they
[1:20:28] gathered with jesus
[1:20:30] jesus and the disciples were in this
[1:20:33] large upper room
[1:20:35] and the scripture records that when they
[1:20:38] were in this
[1:20:38] large upper room and after they had
[1:20:42] eaten that jesus laid aside his garments
[1:20:46] and he began to wash the feet of the
[1:20:49] disciples now this was
[1:20:51] not a normal part of the passover seder
[1:20:55] it was something that was very odd to
[1:20:57] the disciples
[1:20:58] in fact peter told jesus no no no no
[1:21:02] yeah you you're not going to wash my
[1:21:05] feet
[1:21:06] and jesus explained to him
[1:21:09] that it was necessary it was part of
[1:21:13] uh it was a part of jesus calling
[1:21:16] and it was going to become a part of the
[1:21:19] believer's calling
[1:21:20] to where that we would walk in humility
[1:21:24] one with another and we would be
[1:21:26] servants
[1:21:27] one to another and as as jesus is
[1:21:30] washing the feet
[1:21:32] the john records that jesus
[1:21:35] revealed to his disciples that there was
[1:21:39] one who would betray him and they all
[1:21:42] began to question is it me
[1:21:44] is it me am i the one am i the one
[1:21:48] that's going to betray you
[1:21:49] and jesus just kind of threw out a hint
[1:21:52] the one that i dip with is the one that
[1:21:56] it's going to be and of course we know
[1:21:57] that that turned out to be
[1:21:59] judas and then jesus told judas
[1:22:02] whatever you're going to do i want you
[1:22:05] to do it quickly
[1:22:08] but jesus did not all of the sudden
[1:22:11] become a nervous man because that he
[1:22:14] knew
[1:22:14] what was going to happen jesus was still
[1:22:18] with his disciples
[1:22:20] in this upper room and he began to talk
[1:22:23] to them
[1:22:24] about how that it was necessary that he
[1:22:26] go away
[1:22:28] and that if he did not go away that the
[1:22:30] comforter would not come
[1:22:33] if he didn't go away that they would not
[1:22:36] be able to come to their full maturity
[1:22:38] and so he just lays out for them
[1:22:42] all of the things he starts out by
[1:22:44] telling them
[1:22:45] love one another and then he goes on and
[1:22:48] he tells them
[1:22:50] that i'm gonna go away for a while and
[1:22:53] i'm gonna prepare a place for you
[1:22:55] so that where i am you can come and be
[1:22:59] with me also
[1:23:00] but while i'm away i am not going to
[1:23:03] leave you without a comforter
[1:23:06] now you've got to uh just kind of
[1:23:08] picture yourself
[1:23:10] in the in the place of the disciples
[1:23:13] these were men that came from a variety
[1:23:16] of backgrounds
[1:23:17] they were they were they lived some some
[1:23:20] strange
[1:23:21] lives and maybe some wicked lives and
[1:23:24] and diverse in their upbringing and
[1:23:27] their
[1:23:27] their level of what they had uh as far
[1:23:31] as
[1:23:32] finance but they started to follow
[1:23:35] jesus they started walking after him
[1:23:38] and jesus was always there
[1:23:41] in a human form
[1:23:46] and i can imagine because the scripture
[1:23:49] records some things
[1:23:51] about some of these disciples peter
[1:23:54] especially because
[1:23:55] peter was he always seemed to be running
[1:23:58] his mouth
[1:23:58] and he said some things that got him in
[1:24:01] trouble
[1:24:02] and so by these uh indications in the
[1:24:06] scripture
[1:24:07] i figure that there were times where
[1:24:09] jesus
[1:24:10] because he was there in a human form
[1:24:13] he had to say now get back in line
[1:24:19] time you know you did that yesterday
[1:24:23] and i reprimanded you for it i i said
[1:24:26] something to you and
[1:24:27] it's time to get in line
[1:24:30] and so he's he's explaining to these 11
[1:24:34] that were left
[1:24:35] he's explaining to them i am going to go
[1:24:38] away
[1:24:40] and i am not going to be here to
[1:24:43] to put you back in line every time
[1:24:46] but i want you to know that i'm going to
[1:24:49] send the comforter
[1:24:51] i am going to send the spirit
[1:24:54] back to you and that spirit
[1:24:58] that i'm going to send back to you is
[1:25:01] going to be
[1:25:02] to help to keep you in line
[1:25:05] so we look at the scriptures
[1:25:08] jesus continues to to tell them
[1:25:12] not only is the comforter coming but he
[1:25:16] explains to them
[1:25:17] about the oneness between him and his
[1:25:20] father
[1:25:23] and when he explains the oneness of him
[1:25:25] and his father
[1:25:26] he also goes on to tell them this is
[1:25:29] what we're desiring for you
[1:25:32] as a believer oneness with the father
[1:25:36] and he goes on to explain to them the
[1:25:38] only way for that
[1:25:40] to happen is for you to be
[1:25:43] in the vine he said i am the vine
[1:25:47] and you're the branches and you have to
[1:25:50] be
[1:25:51] in the mine in order for that to uh
[1:25:54] to bring forth the branch you know a
[1:25:57] branch can't just be out here somewhere
[1:25:59] by itself
[1:26:04] listen nearly every day of my life
[1:26:07] people love to plant trees next to their
[1:26:10] house
[1:26:12] and when they plant these trees they're
[1:26:15] little
[1:26:17] this is what the builders do they go and
[1:26:20] they dig a little hole and they put a
[1:26:21] little bush
[1:26:24] and when the builder walks away the bush
[1:26:27] is still little
[1:26:29] but because that all of those branches
[1:26:32] are connected
[1:26:33] to that bush and life continues in that
[1:26:37] bush they get taller and taller
[1:26:40] and taller and then when i am trying to
[1:26:44] work on the side of a house
[1:26:47] there's trees that sometimes on a new
[1:26:49] house are this tall
[1:26:51] but as time progresses people
[1:26:54] don't pay attention to their trees and
[1:26:56] their bushes
[1:26:57] and they don't prune them as necessary
[1:27:00] and so they become very large
[1:27:02] and they grow up as tall as the roof is
[1:27:05] so what i should be able to accomplish
[1:27:08] with a stepladder
[1:27:09] i have to use an extension ladder to
[1:27:12] span
[1:27:12] over top of the tree or the bush and i
[1:27:15] have a pair of pruning shears in my van
[1:27:18] and i usually am pruning a branch or two
[1:27:21] off of whatever tree or vine or whatever
[1:27:24] this is
[1:27:25] and i tell you all of that to say this
[1:27:27] within a few days
[1:27:29] if i happen to carry that stuff to the
[1:27:31] house to put on the burn pile
[1:27:33] the green goes out of it and it turns
[1:27:35] brown because it is separated from its
[1:27:38] life source
[1:27:40] i am the vine and you are the branches
[1:27:43] and unless you
[1:27:44] abide in me
[1:27:47] you're not going to be able to produce
[1:27:49] any fruit
[1:27:50] we have to abide in the vine and then if
[1:27:53] jesus
[1:27:53] goes on to tell them you're going to
[1:27:55] have to expect persecutions are going to
[1:27:58] come
[1:27:59] your way and then he comes down to
[1:28:02] saint john chapter 16 and he starts
[1:28:05] explaining to them the works of the
[1:28:08] spirit
[1:28:09] in their life he said verse 7 of chapter
[1:28:13] 16.
[1:28:14] i tell you the truth it is expedient for
[1:28:17] you
[1:28:18] that i go away for if i go not away the
[1:28:22] comforter
[1:28:22] will not come unto you but if i depart i
[1:28:26] will
[1:28:26] send him unto you now i want you to pay
[1:28:29] attention the next couple of verses
[1:28:32] and when he is come he will reprove
[1:28:36] the world of sin and of righteousness
[1:28:41] and of judgment
[1:28:45] of sin because they believe not on me
[1:28:49] of righteousness because i go to my
[1:28:51] father and you see me no more
[1:28:54] of judgment because the prince of this
[1:28:57] world
[1:28:58] is judged then he tells the disciples
[1:29:03] nobody wants to hear what jesus just
[1:29:05] told his disciples
[1:29:07] i have yet many things to say to you but
[1:29:09] you can't bear them now
[1:29:14] i got a lot of things to say to you but
[1:29:17] you can't bear them now
[1:29:18] howbeit he didn't leave them without
[1:29:22] he didn't leave them just in a lurch
[1:29:26] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[1:29:29] come
[1:29:30] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:29:32] shall not speak of himself but whatever
[1:29:34] he shall hear
[1:29:35] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:29:38] things to come
[1:29:40] so now jesus again he's with this
[1:29:43] he's with this group of disciples and
[1:29:46] and i don't know that it's true i just
[1:29:48] find it interesting that it was called a
[1:29:50] large upper room and when the day of
[1:29:52] pentecost came
[1:29:53] they were in a large upper room and i
[1:29:56] would just find it very
[1:29:58] interesting to think that where jesus
[1:30:00] had explained to his disciples
[1:30:03] about the comforter and the necessity of
[1:30:05] the comforter
[1:30:06] that those people would be in that same
[1:30:08] room when the comforter came
[1:30:10] i think that's the way my lord works
[1:30:14] he likes to do things that way if it
[1:30:17] isn't that way it doesn't matter it's
[1:30:19] just nice to think about but he told
[1:30:20] them
[1:30:21] that i'm going to reprove the world of
[1:30:24] sin and of righteousness
[1:30:25] and of judgment now jesus is speaking to
[1:30:29] them
[1:30:30] and he's telling them that there's going
[1:30:32] to that is going to reprove
[1:30:35] the world now i would like to read you
[1:30:39] definitions you'll have to forgive me
[1:30:43] i am so scattered with
[1:30:47] papers today merriam-webster dictionary
[1:30:51] for the word reproved to scold
[1:30:54] or correct usually gently
[1:30:58] or with kindly words second definition
[1:31:02] to express disapproval of censure
[1:31:07] then i'm going to give you two obsolete
[1:31:09] definitions according to merriam-webster
[1:31:11] dictionary
[1:31:12] but i think they still fit in this case
[1:31:16] the third one is to disprove or to
[1:31:18] refute
[1:31:20] and the fourth one is to convince
[1:31:23] or to convict
[1:31:27] now in the old testament if you see the
[1:31:30] word reprove which we read
[1:31:33] in isaiah chapter 11
[1:31:36] see i'm circling back uh in isaiah
[1:31:40] chapter 11 the word reprove
[1:31:42] if you look at the hebrew definition in
[1:31:45] the strongs it means to be right or
[1:31:47] correct to be reciprocal or to
[1:31:50] argue and it gives some other
[1:31:53] definitions
[1:31:54] which go along with meriam webster
[1:31:57] in the new testament the greek
[1:32:00] word would mean to confuse or admonish
[1:32:04] to convict to convince to tell a fault
[1:32:08] to tell a fault or to rebuke
[1:32:12] now when we think about the word
[1:32:16] convict we
[1:32:19] or my mind immediately goes to
[1:32:22] a court of law and
[1:32:26] how that when someone is
[1:32:29] found to be guilty of something
[1:32:33] or uh they're they're accused of being
[1:32:36] guilty of something
[1:32:39] are taken before a court of law
[1:32:42] and then they have to be proved guilty
[1:32:45] uh to to bring about a verdict through a
[1:32:48] jury or through a
[1:32:50] judge and they're convicted of their
[1:32:53] wrong
[1:32:53] and then they have to pay a fine or
[1:32:57] be sentenced to jail that is their
[1:33:00] conviction
[1:33:02] their sentence to spend time
[1:33:05] of some sort or to pay a fine
[1:33:08] and uh if you end up in jail
[1:33:11] they call you a convict
[1:33:16] so
[1:33:20] now we have jesus speaking to the
[1:33:22] disciples
[1:33:24] and he's telling them i want i
[1:33:27] i'm i'm i'm going away and
[1:33:31] i am going to send back the comforter
[1:33:34] because it is necessary that i
[1:33:38] do this and when he
[1:33:41] is come i want you to notice
[1:33:47] there's something that could not happen
[1:33:51] when jesus was on the earth in a
[1:33:53] physical body
[1:33:56] so jesus had to leave the earth
[1:34:00] and go back to the father and he had to
[1:34:03] send the comforter the holy spirit
[1:34:06] the very spirit of the living god back
[1:34:09] on the believer
[1:34:10] and he had to do it because he is going
[1:34:13] to reprove
[1:34:14] the world of sin because
[1:34:18] they believe not now
[1:34:21] understand as we have preached over and
[1:34:24] over and over again from this pulpit
[1:34:27] that there are hundreds and thousands
[1:34:30] and maybe even
[1:34:32] millions of people through the years
[1:34:35] who were sinners and they
[1:34:38] remained sinners all through their life
[1:34:42] and they died sinners they
[1:34:45] never called on the name of the lord
[1:34:49] not at all and because of that
[1:34:53] the scripture tells us that there has
[1:34:56] been
[1:34:56] a place prepared for the devil and his
[1:35:00] angels
[1:35:01] and for the disobedient and those that
[1:35:03] don't want to
[1:35:04] uh go to the lord and have their sins
[1:35:07] remitted
[1:35:09] so he came to the war he sent the
[1:35:11] comforter
[1:35:12] he sent the holy spirit back and he
[1:35:16] he did it in such a way
[1:35:19] that he was able to reprove
[1:35:23] the world of sin now this word again to
[1:35:27] reprove
[1:35:28] means to convict now when
[1:35:32] god brings conviction
[1:35:35] when he brings a conviction into a life
[1:35:39] now this may seem very elementary to you
[1:35:41] but just
[1:35:42] please hang on with me here when god
[1:35:45] sends
[1:35:45] conviction to a sinner
[1:35:48] there are sometimes where that
[1:35:53] there is some kind of a bodily emotion
[1:35:56] that happens
[1:35:58] you hear some of these old-time
[1:36:00] preachers like
[1:36:02] charles and john wesley and and some of
[1:36:04] those others that would preach and the
[1:36:07] conviction
[1:36:08] power of god would come down and
[1:36:11] people would physically shake
[1:36:14] in their in the pew that they were
[1:36:16] sitting on or on the bench that they
[1:36:18] were sitting on
[1:36:19] and they would be convicted by the power
[1:36:22] of god
[1:36:23] and they would turn their lives over to
[1:36:25] the lord
[1:36:27] there are others who have been who have
[1:36:29] had the spirit of conviction on them
[1:36:33] who did not respond to the spirit of
[1:36:36] conviction
[1:36:37] and it turned around that they walked
[1:36:40] away and god
[1:36:41] never gave them another chance
[1:36:47] now this may seem unfair
[1:36:51] as a human being this may seem unfair
[1:36:54] that somebody would only get one chance
[1:36:58] but i i call to your remembrance today
[1:37:01] that our god is sovereign and he knows
[1:37:05] the hearts
[1:37:06] of men and women and he knows that
[1:37:08] another chance is not going to change
[1:37:10] anything
[1:37:14] not going to change anything so he sent
[1:37:18] the holy spirit back to reprove the
[1:37:20] world of sin
[1:37:23] because they believe not on me
[1:37:27] so you have some who never
[1:37:32] will say yes lord
[1:37:37] this is very difficult
[1:37:41] for some of us to hear
[1:37:48] but it's true nonetheless because
[1:37:53] god will not take one person
[1:37:57] out of this earth without giving them a
[1:38:00] chance
[1:38:01] to repent
[1:38:05] whether it's once whether it's twice
[1:38:07] whether it's ten
[1:38:08] times that's up to god
[1:38:11] it's up to god and he knows
[1:38:15] he knows so then he says
[1:38:19] that it was necessary to reprove the
[1:38:22] world
[1:38:23] of righteousness because i go to my
[1:38:27] father and you see me no more
[1:38:30] now again jesus is with his disciples
[1:38:33] in a physical body and he is walking
[1:38:36] with them
[1:38:37] and he is the very epitome of
[1:38:39] righteousness
[1:38:40] he is the very essence of righteousness
[1:38:43] he because
[1:38:44] he has submitted his will to the will of
[1:38:47] the father
[1:38:48] as he goes along and he's maturing as
[1:38:51] you recall brother shelly
[1:38:53] spoke to us over the last couple of
[1:38:55] service and he reminded us
[1:38:56] about that adoption process and and when
[1:38:59] he got to mount
[1:39:00] transfiguration when the voice came out
[1:39:03] of heaven
[1:39:04] this is my beloved son here ye
[1:39:07] him there was a there came to the
[1:39:10] completion of the adoption
[1:39:12] where that god was now satisfied with
[1:39:15] all that had been packed into his son
[1:39:18] on the earth and he could say hear him
[1:39:24] he walked the earth for how long i don't
[1:39:26] know but he walked the earth
[1:39:28] uh a while longer went to the cross but
[1:39:31] there came the time where that he
[1:39:34] said i have to go away
[1:39:37] because i'm going to reprove the world
[1:39:41] and when i reprove the world i'm going
[1:39:43] to reprove them
[1:39:44] of righteousness now here is what i
[1:39:47] would like to say and if i take this
[1:39:49] in the wrong context forgive me but this
[1:39:51] is the way
[1:39:52] that i saw it as i was looking at it
[1:39:55] he's going to
[1:39:56] reprove the world of righteousness now
[1:39:58] everybody could say
[1:40:00] that was jesus that was god himself
[1:40:03] walking around on the earth that was the
[1:40:05] god man
[1:40:06] of course he was righteous all right now
[1:40:09] i'm going to go away
[1:40:11] and i'm going to send the comforter back
[1:40:13] i'm going to send the
[1:40:14] holy spirit back on believers and i am
[1:40:17] going to show
[1:40:18] that even though i am not there
[1:40:21] there are people who will walk in
[1:40:23] righteousness
[1:40:25] there are people who will so surrender
[1:40:29] to the holy ghost they will become
[1:40:32] so surrendered to my righteousness
[1:40:36] that i will be able to convict the world
[1:40:40] of their unrighteousness because they're
[1:40:43] able to see
[1:40:45] men and women who have walked in
[1:40:48] righteousness
[1:40:50] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:52] and have continued to walk
[1:40:54] in this righteousness all right and then
[1:40:57] he said i am going to
[1:40:59] i'm going to reprove the world of
[1:41:01] judgment because the prince of
[1:41:04] this world is judged we know the prince
[1:41:07] of this world
[1:41:08] is the the devil that'll serpent the
[1:41:11] devil
[1:41:11] he is he is going about like a roaring
[1:41:15] lion
[1:41:16] seeking whom he may devour he's trying
[1:41:19] to find
[1:41:19] out whoever he can to devour
[1:41:25] now i don't need to inform you people
[1:41:28] that even though the devil is going
[1:41:30] about as a roaring lion
[1:41:33] seeking whom he may devour and he can
[1:41:36] never
[1:41:37] devour me as a believer he's going to
[1:41:39] make an attempt
[1:41:43] that doesn't mean he's going to leave
[1:41:44] you alone
[1:41:47] and because that you as a believer
[1:41:50] have chosen by the grace of god by the
[1:41:53] foreknowledge and the predestination of
[1:41:55] god
[1:41:56] you have chosen to walk in his
[1:41:59] righteousness it can't be our
[1:42:02] righteousness because
[1:42:03] our righteousness it doesn't amount to
[1:42:06] anything
[1:42:07] it's filthy stinking to him but if we
[1:42:11] will
[1:42:11] let go of our rightness
[1:42:15] anybody in here like to be right
[1:42:22] i like to be right but the older i get
[1:42:27] the quicker i am coming to realize
[1:42:31] that i may as well just shut my mouth
[1:42:35] sometimes
[1:42:39] because my memory is not as long as it
[1:42:42] used to be
[1:42:44] i don't remember all the details so i'm
[1:42:47] just as well
[1:42:48] to just hush because in the end
[1:42:53] does it really matter with things of
[1:42:56] this life i mean when it comes to the
[1:42:58] word we've got to be right
[1:43:01] that matters but when it just comes for
[1:43:04] the sake of an argument about whether
[1:43:06] i'm right or whether you're right
[1:43:09] go for it you can have it
[1:43:12] i i just i i don't that's a battle that
[1:43:16] i don't need to face i don't need to
[1:43:17] fight it
[1:43:18] i just i'm coming to the place where let
[1:43:21] me bow down and wash your feet
[1:43:24] let me just let me just kneel in
[1:43:26] humility
[1:43:27] and that's not just us just to say words
[1:43:30] i
[1:43:31] i want to be so right with the holy
[1:43:34] spirit
[1:43:34] i want to know that the spirit of god
[1:43:38] is working in me and that it's working
[1:43:40] his righteousness
[1:43:42] and then my righteousness is laid aside
[1:43:47] so as jesus
[1:43:51] is telling
[1:43:54] these disciples he said
[1:43:57] that it was necessary for him to go away
[1:44:01] and it was necessary that the comforter
[1:44:03] came back and
[1:44:04] that he wasn't going to be walking
[1:44:06] around on there were in the world
[1:44:08] anymore
[1:44:09] as far as a human being as as the man
[1:44:12] jesus but yet there was going to be a
[1:44:15] group of people
[1:44:16] he was going to he was going to bring
[1:44:18] salvation to individuals and
[1:44:21] give them the holy ghost and and through
[1:44:23] the holy ghost
[1:44:25] he he was going to bring the spirit
[1:44:28] of conviction upon them
[1:44:32] now according to the oswald chamber
[1:44:36] said conviction of sin is one of the
[1:44:40] rarest things that ever strikes a man
[1:44:44] it is the threshold of an understanding
[1:44:46] of god
[1:44:48] jesus christ said that when the holy
[1:44:50] spirit came
[1:44:51] he would convict of sin and when the
[1:44:53] holy spirit
[1:44:54] rouses the conscience and brings him
[1:44:57] into the presence of
[1:44:58] god it is not his relationship with
[1:45:02] men that bothers him but his
[1:45:04] relationship with
[1:45:05] god and
[1:45:09] when our relationship with men
[1:45:12] is affected it does affect
[1:45:16] our relationship with god and when we
[1:45:19] can
[1:45:19] come to the lord and be bothered that
[1:45:22] our relationship with god is affected
[1:45:25] because of our relationship
[1:45:26] with men then we are under the spirit of
[1:45:29] conviction
[1:45:30] and we have a choice now and that is to
[1:45:35] repent
[1:45:39] i want to read something to you because
[1:45:41] i found this to be very interesting or
[1:45:44] words
[1:45:44] that express really what i i
[1:45:48] am trying to get across to you today
[1:45:51] concerning conviction and and i'm
[1:45:55] going to say something here in just a
[1:45:56] moment but in the upper room
[1:45:59] as jesus continued teaching about the
[1:46:01] ministry of the holy spirit he said
[1:46:04] that when he come he would reprove the
[1:46:05] word of sin of righteousness and of
[1:46:08] judgment
[1:46:08] john 16 8 which we have read he said
[1:46:12] jesus what he meant when he said the
[1:46:15] holy spirit
[1:46:16] would reprove the world of sin we've
[1:46:19] already talked about this word it means
[1:46:21] to expose
[1:46:23] to convict or to cross-examine
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:29] for the purpose of conviction
[1:46:32] as in convicting a law breaker in the
[1:46:34] court of law
[1:46:37] the holy spirit will begin to deal with
[1:46:40] the heart of an unbeliever
[1:46:42] and by the time he is finished
[1:46:45] that lost sinful soul will feel exposed
[1:46:50] and convicted as the holy spirit
[1:46:54] enables that person to hear the word of
[1:46:56] god for the first time
[1:46:58] the razor sharp sword of the word will
[1:47:00] penetrate his soul
[1:47:02] until he feels as if as if he has been
[1:47:05] cross-examined on a witness stand
[1:47:09] finally the court will be adjourned the
[1:47:11] verdict announced
[1:47:12] and he will know on the inside that he
[1:47:15] is guilty of sin
[1:47:18] this is precisely what a sinner feels
[1:47:20] when the holy spirit convicts him of sin
[1:47:23] now again this was a basic teaching to a
[1:47:27] sinner but i
[1:47:28] am talking to seasoned believers
[1:47:31] who are under the headship of the lord
[1:47:34] jesus christ with the baptism of the
[1:47:37] holy ghost
[1:47:38] with the comforter on the inside the
[1:47:40] spirit of god on the inside
[1:47:42] and god is still using conviction
[1:47:46] or cross-examination by the word of
[1:47:50] god the word of god is the law that he
[1:47:53] is using to do the cross-examination
[1:47:56] with
[1:47:57] this is precisely what a sinner feels
[1:47:59] when the holy spirit convicts him of sin
[1:48:03] listen to this it is amazing how long a
[1:48:06] sinner
[1:48:06] can live without conviction or godly
[1:48:10] sorrow for his behavior
[1:48:12] how long he can be nearly numb to any
[1:48:15] sense of wrongness regarding his sinful
[1:48:18] actions
[1:48:19] i want you to know this is not just for
[1:48:22] a sinner that has never called on the
[1:48:24] lord
[1:48:24] this is something that a believer can
[1:48:27] face in his lifetime once twice
[1:48:30] many times through and sometimes
[1:48:35] we are convicted but it's amazing how
[1:48:38] long we can be nearly numb
[1:48:40] to any sense of wrongness regarding our
[1:48:44] actions of unbelief
[1:48:46] the bible said that sin has made
[1:48:48] unbelievers to be hard-hearted
[1:48:51] spiritually blind and past feeling
[1:48:55] see ephesians 4 18-19 but
[1:48:58] those factors change instantly
[1:49:02] when the holy spirit touches the human
[1:49:05] soul
[1:49:06] and exposes its sinful condition
[1:49:09] or its condition of unbelief exposed
[1:49:13] naked
[1:49:14] confronted that is exactly what a sinner
[1:49:18] feels when the holy spirit wakes them up
[1:49:21] to his true spiritual condition
[1:49:24] it is the work of the holy spirit to
[1:49:26] convict sinners of their
[1:49:28] lost condition the whole world stands
[1:49:31] guilty before god romans 3 19 but the
[1:49:34] lost don't realize they are guilty
[1:49:37] until that moment when the holy spirit
[1:49:40] reveals it to them now i would like to
[1:49:42] go back to what they see said
[1:49:45] up above and that is when a believer
[1:49:48] goes for an extended period of time
[1:49:50] he walks in numbness or any sense of
[1:49:53] wrongdoing
[1:49:54] a believer can be in this same condition
[1:49:59] and he doesn't even realize that he is
[1:50:02] guilty even though the word is going
[1:50:04] forth
[1:50:05] and he walks under this numbness or this
[1:50:08] sleepiness or whatever it
[1:50:10] is but there comes a
[1:50:13] spirit of god all right jesus stated
[1:50:16] no man can come unto me except the
[1:50:18] father draw him john 6 44.
[1:50:21] this drawing of a person's heart to
[1:50:23] jesus is done
[1:50:24] through the work of the holy spirit
[1:50:27] jesus reminded us of this when he said
[1:50:29] and when he come he will reprove the
[1:50:32] world
[1:50:33] of sin without the work of the holy
[1:50:35] spirit to expose our sinful
[1:50:38] condition we would still remain in
[1:50:40] darkness today
[1:50:41] lost and without god it is amazing that
[1:50:45] a person can be in sin and even
[1:50:47] understand
[1:50:48] that he is in sin anybody got loved ones
[1:50:53] knows they're in sin they don't want to
[1:50:56] do anything about it
[1:50:59] yet nonetheless he fails to grasp the
[1:51:02] real eternal consequences of what that
[1:51:04] means
[1:51:06] he can even be in a church service where
[1:51:08] he hears about sin
[1:51:09] and acknowledges that the sermon is true
[1:51:12] and that he's that he's a sinner yet
[1:51:15] leave the service
[1:51:16] and continue living the same lifestyle
[1:51:20] he did before he got there
[1:51:23] now this could baffle a mind of an
[1:51:26] immature believer
[1:51:28] but for mature believers we can see
[1:51:31] that there are people who can sit under
[1:51:35] the sound of the word
[1:51:36] and they can leave now brother branham
[1:51:39] taught us that when you come in you're
[1:51:41] either going to leave better or you're
[1:51:42] going to leave worse
[1:51:48] so that ought to be a question that we
[1:51:50] ask ourselves every time we leave the
[1:51:52] house am i better
[1:51:54] or am i worse so now this sinner he can
[1:51:58] leave a service and continue to
[1:52:00] live the same lifestyle he did before he
[1:52:03] got there but
[1:52:04] something happens when the holy spirit
[1:52:06] begins to work in that person's soul
[1:52:09] he lovingly cross-examines that person
[1:52:13] until finally he brings him to a place
[1:52:16] of
[1:52:16] confrontation it is at that point that
[1:52:20] invisible scales fall from the person's
[1:52:22] eyes and he truly sees
[1:52:24] for the first time that he is in sin
[1:52:27] there's something that he can only
[1:52:28] that can only be real revealed
[1:52:32] by the holy spirit when he convicts of
[1:52:35] sin
[1:52:36] the sinner absolutely knows that he is a
[1:52:40] sinner
[1:52:41] and once the spirit of god has lovingly
[1:52:44] brought that person to the place where
[1:52:45] he finally
[1:52:46] sees it for himself the person has a
[1:52:49] choice will he stay in sin
[1:52:52] or will he repent and turn to god
[1:52:56] you see i read this because i see
[1:53:00] that as brother shelley has been
[1:53:02] preaching to us
[1:53:04] concerning the the offices of the holy
[1:53:07] ghost
[1:53:08] and how that the spirit wants to work in
[1:53:11] us
[1:53:11] to bring all of these things into a
[1:53:13] believer because he wants to bring us to
[1:53:17] a level of spiritual maturity
[1:53:20] as jesus was on the earth because
[1:53:24] god is going to reprove the world of
[1:53:26] righteousness because he's going to have
[1:53:28] righteous seed that are coming to the
[1:53:30] full maturity
[1:53:31] where that he can say this is my beloved
[1:53:34] son
[1:53:35] hear ye him
[1:53:40] me that can be me
[1:53:44] yes that can be me that can be you
[1:53:48] in fact i don't i don't even like to say
[1:53:51] it can be because i've come a little bit
[1:53:53] further i believe it will be
[1:53:56] i am one of those sons that is going to
[1:53:59] come to complete maturity
[1:54:02] where that all that the father was and
[1:54:05] he poured into christ
[1:54:07] christ went back to the father and the
[1:54:09] holy spirit was poured out
[1:54:11] now all that he was is being poured on
[1:54:13] the believer
[1:54:14] that is what i believe that we are
[1:54:17] coming to that place
[1:54:19] of the full maturity of the believer
[1:54:24] now in the course of
[1:54:28] convicting in a natural
[1:54:31] court of law there is something that
[1:54:34] they call circumstantial
[1:54:37] evidence and circumstantial
[1:54:41] evidence is proof of a fact or a set of
[1:54:45] facts from which
[1:54:46] one could infer the fact in question
[1:54:51] for example
[1:54:55] a suspect is seen running away
[1:54:59] from a murder scene with a weapon in his
[1:55:01] hand
[1:55:03] this is circumstantial
[1:55:10] it's circumstantial evidence that he
[1:55:12] committed the murder
[1:55:14] there may not have been an eyewitness
[1:55:17] but someone saw this man running away
[1:55:22] with a knife in his hand and so this
[1:55:25] becomes circumstantial evidence
[1:55:27] and this contrasts with direct evidence
[1:55:31] which would be such as an eyewitness who
[1:55:34] testifies
[1:55:35] to seeing the suspect shoot the victim
[1:55:38] this becomes the direct
[1:55:39] evidence now
[1:55:42] i'm not a lawyer not even
[1:55:46] close but i did read enough to find out
[1:55:50] that the weakest
[1:55:54] argument or the weakest evidence
[1:55:57] is a person's opinion
[1:56:10] thought i had it written down because
[1:56:15] yes an opinion is the weakest evidence
[1:56:20] and so if
[1:56:23] i'm sitting in my easy chair
[1:56:26] and there's some circumstantial evidence
[1:56:28] that is thrown out
[1:56:30] you see this this is how a lot of people
[1:56:32] are convicted
[1:56:34] uh this is how people get convicted in
[1:56:37] the media
[1:56:38] because there is only a certain amount
[1:56:42] of information that is put out there and
[1:56:44] there are plenty of us
[1:56:45] that sit in our armchair and we
[1:56:48] come up with an opinion of our own and
[1:56:51] we throw that opinion around
[1:56:53] because we're only getting a certain
[1:56:56] amount of the information
[1:56:58] and and we know that that's what the
[1:57:00] media is out to do
[1:57:02] especially in our day our hour that we
[1:57:04] live now
[1:57:05] because they're trying to change the
[1:57:08] whole tide
[1:57:10] of of of our republic they're trying to
[1:57:12] change the tide of
[1:57:13] of morality they're trying to change the
[1:57:16] whole
[1:57:17] scope of the nation and so if they can
[1:57:20] get
[1:57:20] people to form a strong enough opinion
[1:57:24] until that people will go out and
[1:57:25] protest and they'll go out and
[1:57:27] and say this is what we want this is how
[1:57:30] that things start turning the tide you
[1:57:33] know i can look at politics and i can
[1:57:36] see
[1:57:36] how in the world did so much
[1:57:41] liberalism get in the government
[1:57:44] how did it happen and
[1:57:47] uh you know with the mindset that i have
[1:57:52] i i think you know if a person would
[1:57:54] just think
[1:57:55] logically how could they come up with
[1:57:58] such an
[1:57:58] opposite opinion of what i have
[1:58:02] but somehow they came up with the
[1:58:04] opinion that they have and they decided
[1:58:07] that they wanted to run
[1:58:08] on a ticket and and and move
[1:58:11] their agenda forward because
[1:58:15] of an opinion and so as they go out and
[1:58:19] they promote their
[1:58:20] opinion and somebody that is also
[1:58:23] watching maybe the same thing that
[1:58:25] they're watching then they
[1:58:27] come up with the same opinion or their
[1:58:29] opinion
[1:58:30] is tilted toward that politician
[1:58:33] so then they get the votes and slowly
[1:58:35] the tide changes
[1:58:37] it changes it changes it changes until
[1:58:40] that a state
[1:58:41] turns into uh where that there's more
[1:58:43] liberal voters or
[1:58:45] democrat in our case voters then there
[1:58:47] are republican voters this is because of
[1:58:50] opinion
[1:58:54] you can look at churches all across this
[1:58:57] nation
[1:58:59] and if you go back 50 60 70 years ago
[1:59:03] you would see that there was a
[1:59:06] changing of the tide in the churches
[1:59:10] it was because that the opinion of
[1:59:13] people
[1:59:14] started to change they were more
[1:59:18] open-minded
[1:59:21] and the they began to preach
[1:59:24] a more social gospel and they got away
[1:59:28] from the word
[1:59:29] and so as time went on and
[1:59:32] and now i've never been a part of a
[1:59:34] denomination but i've heard brother
[1:59:36] shelly talk about it enough
[1:59:38] and i've heard enough things to where
[1:59:40] the
[1:59:41] the board of directors or the the the
[1:59:44] presbyters or the the deacon border
[1:59:47] whoever it might be
[1:59:49] that has some authority over the bylaws
[1:59:52] of a church
[1:59:53] they come in and as people want things
[1:59:57] to change
[1:59:59] they get rid of the preacher that was
[2:00:02] preaching from the word and they bring
[2:00:04] somebody in that lines up more with
[2:00:07] their opinion
[2:00:10] this is how that the word of god
[2:00:14] has become of none effect
[2:00:18] in the churches at large
[2:00:22] and it will become of none effect in our
[2:00:25] lives
[2:00:26] if we do that same kind of thing
[2:00:31] and so we as a bride church
[2:00:35] we must make sure
[2:00:38] that when we look at an opinion
[2:00:42] that we go back to the word with that
[2:00:44] opinion
[2:00:45] and give it a cross-examination by the
[2:00:48] word
[2:00:53] now the holy spirit he comes
[2:00:56] and he convicts us
[2:01:00] and he cross-examines us
[2:01:03] so many times when we do or
[2:01:06] say something or we act in a certain way
[2:01:10] or
[2:01:11] we take on something and the holy spirit
[2:01:14] comes
[2:01:14] on the believer and he starts to
[2:01:17] cross-examine us
[2:01:20] and he cross-examines us by first of all
[2:01:23] he just puts his
[2:01:24] his finger on a place in our life
[2:01:27] and we'll call it a place in our mind
[2:01:32] because just as faith started as
[2:01:36] a as a uh we'll call it a mental
[2:01:38] conception
[2:01:39] well it started out as intellectual
[2:01:42] faith
[2:01:43] somebody came along and said you need to
[2:01:46] be saved there's something that sparked
[2:01:48] we'll call it the conviction of the holy
[2:01:50] spirit something sparked
[2:01:52] and so then things progress through our
[2:01:55] life and the holy spirit has brought us
[2:01:57] to this point where we are right now
[2:02:02] and we'd like to be totally mature
[2:02:05] believers
[2:02:08] aware that nothing would offend us
[2:02:10] nothing would bother us
[2:02:12] nothing would get us out of sorts
[2:02:14] nothing would cause us to become
[2:02:16] irritable
[2:02:18] i don't like to fear
[2:02:21] feel irritable
[2:02:25] i don't like to i don't like the feeling
[2:02:29] and when i do the best thing for me to
[2:02:31] do
[2:02:32] is to go hide to hide in my room
[2:02:36] somewhere
[2:02:37] and pray it through
[2:02:40] i'm telling you the best thing for me
[2:02:43] it may not work for you but the best
[2:02:45] thing for me
[2:02:47] is to go and get in my room and start
[2:02:49] talking to the lord
[2:02:51] and many times turn on the voice of the
[2:02:54] prophet and start to start listening
[2:02:55] there's a soothing there
[2:02:57] and then pretty soon i work my way
[2:03:00] through it
[2:03:00] and i allow the holy spirit to get it
[2:03:02] out of my life
[2:03:05] i don't like that feeling but you know
[2:03:07] why i don't like that feeling
[2:03:09] because it's the spirit of god dealing
[2:03:11] with me that it doesn't belong there
[2:03:15] that doesn't belong there
[2:03:19] and because i'm his i respond to him
[2:03:23] i allow him to cross-examine me
[2:03:27] is this of god is this is this that i'm
[2:03:30] feeling is this of god is there
[2:03:32] are you wanting to take me someplace are
[2:03:34] you wanting to show me something in your
[2:03:37] word
[2:03:37] to be able to take me higher or is this
[2:03:40] something that i have taken on
[2:03:42] and because of an opinion or
[2:03:44] circumstantial evidence
[2:03:48] you see friends we get bent out of shape
[2:03:51] too much of our life by circumstantial
[2:03:54] evidence
[2:03:56] things we think we've heard things we
[2:03:59] think we've seen
[2:04:00] things we think we've observed things
[2:04:03] maybe we have observed
[2:04:07] we get bent out of shape
[2:04:11] just all been out of shape
[2:04:14] but the holy spirit is right there to
[2:04:16] convict us
[2:04:18] to bring to us a thing where that we say
[2:04:22] lord
[2:04:24] i know that this is not bringing me into
[2:04:27] a closer walk with you
[2:04:31] this is not bringing me to a place where
[2:04:33] that i feel like that
[2:04:34] i have the victory no
[2:04:37] it's it's something where i feel like
[2:04:39] that i am defeated i
[2:04:41] i feel guilty you see when a person is
[2:04:45] before a court of law
[2:04:46] they bring them either to guilty or not
[2:04:50] guilty
[2:04:52] now there are people who plead not
[2:04:55] guilty
[2:04:57] that are
[2:05:01] and there are other people that they
[2:05:03] persuade
[2:05:05] in different ways again i'm not a lawyer
[2:05:10] but you hear enough about cases that
[2:05:13] again are tried in the media and and
[2:05:17] they tell them plead guilty plead not
[2:05:21] guilty and all of these things are
[2:05:23] are to bring about an end result
[2:05:27] they're trying to keep people out of
[2:05:29] jail
[2:05:31] and so they have a lawyer to advise them
[2:05:35] well again we have an advocate
[2:05:38] that advocate be in the holy spirit
[2:05:41] and he wants to keep us out of prison
[2:05:45] he wants to keep us out of jail out of
[2:05:47] the prison of our own mind
[2:05:50] he wants to keep us from a prison of
[2:05:53] going around the hamster wheel
[2:05:56] he wants to keep us out of that prison
[2:05:58] of battling that thought over and over
[2:06:01] and over again
[2:06:02] he wants us out of that prison so what
[2:06:04] does he do
[2:06:05] he puts his finger on this thing and he
[2:06:08] begins to cross-examine
[2:06:14] lays the word on it
[2:06:18] lays the word on it is this feeling
[2:06:23] is it bringing you closer to god is it
[2:06:25] bringing more of the fruit of the spirit
[2:06:27] into your life
[2:06:28] is it bringing a a a a capstone
[2:06:33] uh onto the
[2:06:36] pyramid the building is it bringing the
[2:06:38] fullness of the godhead bodily into your
[2:06:41] life
[2:06:41] is it bringing all of that fullness into
[2:06:43] your life or is it
[2:06:45] causing you to live in a prison of your
[2:06:48] own mind
[2:06:49] where that you are crippled and you
[2:06:50] can't go any farther with god
[2:06:52] because you're stuck in a place because
[2:06:55] you continue to
[2:06:57] refuse to allow the holy spirit to
[2:07:00] cross-examine you
[2:07:02] and bring you to a place of conviction
[2:07:07] so when he brings me to a place of
[2:07:10] conviction
[2:07:13] as with a sinner a sinner has to say
[2:07:17] i am guilty i am guilty of this sin of
[2:07:21] this transgression
[2:07:22] of this unbelief i'm guilty of it
[2:07:26] so now i have two choices
[2:07:30] will i remain there and continue doing
[2:07:34] what i
[2:07:34] want to do or will i allow
[2:07:38] the spirit of god you see his blood
[2:07:42] the life of the blood of jesus christ is
[2:07:44] still powerful enough
[2:07:47] it's all powerful it's not lost any of
[2:07:49] its power when i say it's powerful
[2:07:51] enough
[2:07:52] i don't want to indicate that it's lost
[2:07:54] any of its power it has
[2:07:55] never lost any of its power though we
[2:07:58] have come over 2000 years
[2:08:00] since the crucifixion the life of the
[2:08:03] blood of
[2:08:03] jesus christ is still as powerful as it
[2:08:06] ever was
[2:08:07] and it will cleanse us from all of our
[2:08:09] unrighteousness
[2:08:11] all we have to the the fact is friends
[2:08:13] it is already done
[2:08:16] it's already complete the holy spirit
[2:08:19] desires for me to say yes lord
[2:08:22] yes i will agree
[2:08:26] with you on this fact that that the
[2:08:29] conviction
[2:08:30] power of the holy ghost has come in my
[2:08:33] life
[2:08:33] and he has cross-examined me and
[2:08:36] he has found me to be guilty
[2:08:41] whatever it is whatever it is
[2:08:46] there are people who play around
[2:08:49] in church with pornography they play
[2:08:52] around with
[2:08:53] adultery and fornication and they they
[2:08:56] they mess with those kind of things
[2:08:58] they they continue doing awful awful
[2:09:02] things
[2:09:03] to and still come to church and and and
[2:09:06] they sing the hymns and
[2:09:08] and they may even run the aisles they
[2:09:10] may even speak in tongues
[2:09:13] and i don't even ha i or any other
[2:09:16] preacher or any other person
[2:09:18] we don't have a enough
[2:09:21] understanding i don't think to put a
[2:09:23] person in hell
[2:09:24] unless god would say it's thus saith the
[2:09:26] lord we don't have
[2:09:30] but people play around for years with
[2:09:33] these things
[2:09:35] and i don't know how many times the
[2:09:37] spirit of god might send conviction
[2:09:40] on those particular things
[2:09:43] but i believe that many or most of us
[2:09:46] in this congregation i don't know about
[2:09:49] out there i don't know where you live
[2:09:51] but i believe by the grace of god we're
[2:09:53] moving up
[2:09:54] and instead we deal with other things
[2:09:59] jealousy and envy and
[2:10:03] hatred and strife and malice and
[2:10:07] discontentedness and
[2:10:09] and all of these things that are just
[2:10:12] their their works of the flesh
[2:10:16] along with adultery and fornication
[2:10:18] their works of the flesh
[2:10:20] and we have got to bring them under the
[2:10:22] control of the holy spirit
[2:10:25] and when he convicts us of these things
[2:10:28] by the word of god and he cross-examines
[2:10:31] i don't know what you're sitting here
[2:10:33] today dealing with
[2:10:34] i don't know whether you've been knocked
[2:10:38] out of a
[2:10:38] job i don't know whether you've been
[2:10:40] knocked out of a position
[2:10:42] i don't know whether you're jealous over
[2:10:44] an old flame i don't know whether you're
[2:10:47] mad because somebody got on your toes
[2:10:50] i don't know what you're facing today
[2:10:55] but when the spirit of god comes with
[2:10:58] the conviction with the
[2:11:00] cross-examination
[2:11:02] just i encourage you to let him let him
[2:11:05] have it and say
[2:11:06] lord i am here in your presence today
[2:11:10] to let the conviction power of the holy
[2:11:14] spirit be so real in my life
[2:11:17] and i don't want to just feel the
[2:11:19] conviction i want to respond to the
[2:11:22] conviction
[2:11:23] of the spirit of god by saying here you
[2:11:25] go lord
[2:11:26] forgive me and cleanse me of all
[2:11:36] unrighteousness
[2:11:38] friends the holy spirit the holy ghost
[2:11:42] the comforter the gift of the holy ghost
[2:11:48] how many times if you study
[2:11:52] the message of the hour you would hear
[2:11:53] brother branham talk about people
[2:11:56] that that speak in tongues and it
[2:11:57] sounded like dry peas off of a
[2:12:00] a dry cowhide and he
[2:12:03] he would talk about that because he was
[2:12:05] watching people
[2:12:07] who would speak in tongues and they
[2:12:10] would
[2:12:10] they would get all excited in church but
[2:12:13] their life didn't measure up to it they
[2:12:16] weren't coming
[2:12:17] they weren't they weren't yielding to
[2:12:19] the conviction of the holy ghost
[2:12:21] because they wanted to go with the trend
[2:12:23] that was at that time
[2:12:25] and brother branham that that's why he
[2:12:26] kept saying that
[2:12:28] he wasn't against any of the gifts of
[2:12:30] the holy spirit he wanted a people that
[2:12:32] were
[2:12:33] walking in accordance to the word of the
[2:12:35] word of god
[2:12:36] so that they could be fully operational
[2:12:39] in the church
[2:12:40] body and that it would help the people
[2:12:43] even when they were in their own private
[2:12:44] time
[2:12:45] where that they could pray in the spirit
[2:12:47] when they didn't know which way to turn
[2:12:49] they could pray in the spirit and the
[2:12:51] spirit could handle the situation
[2:12:57] all of this conviction of the spirit
[2:13:00] what we have been hearing about the holy
[2:13:02] spirit being our advocate being our
[2:13:04] comforter
[2:13:05] being the spirit of truth all of these
[2:13:07] things that
[2:13:09] we have been hearing and will continue
[2:13:11] to hear
[2:13:12] this is because the holy spirit wants to
[2:13:15] place his very
[2:13:17] own life in us in such a way that we are
[2:13:20] carrying the fullness the fullness of
[2:13:24] god in our lives now
[2:13:27] as the musicians are coming i would just
[2:13:30] like to quickly
[2:13:31] go back to uh isaiah chapter 11
[2:13:36] because i just want to share with you
[2:13:40] something that i felt i feel like that
[2:13:43] the lord
[2:13:45] spoke into my life and if it was only
[2:13:48] for me
[2:13:48] okay but i felt that i was to share it
[2:13:51] with you
[2:13:52] and this is what i felt like the lord
[2:13:54] spoke to me
[2:13:56] when he he said that the spirit of
[2:13:59] conviction
[2:14:03] was the prelude to the spirit
[2:14:08] of the reverential fear of the lord
[2:14:14] the spirit of conviction
[2:14:17] was the prelude to the spirit
[2:14:22] of the reverential fear of the lord
[2:14:26] that means that it has to come before
[2:14:33] the spirit of conviction comes before
[2:14:37] the reverential fear of the lord comes
[2:14:45] when the reverential fear of the lord
[2:14:47] comes to us
[2:14:52] if i recall correctly
[2:14:55] we have been told that when the
[2:14:57] reverential fear comes
[2:14:59] it is not going to be the same kind of
[2:15:03] of anointing or emotion that we might
[2:15:05] have when we're running the aisles
[2:15:08] and shouting and speaking in tongues and
[2:15:10] walking the back of the pews
[2:15:12] and being real loud but when the
[2:15:13] reverential fear of the lord comes
[2:15:15] it's going to be such a glory of god
[2:15:19] that we're going to want to be on our
[2:15:20] faces before him
[2:15:22] because it's in the reverential fear of
[2:15:25] god
[2:15:26] when he comes down it is going to burn
[2:15:29] out
[2:15:29] anything that's left that's unlike god
[2:15:37] the final capping
[2:15:41] a finality in our lives and so when he
[2:15:44] comes with the spirit of conviction
[2:15:48] it is a small way that he gets
[2:15:52] us to respond to him one thing at a time
[2:15:56] one thing at a time when i think back
[2:16:00] over my life
[2:16:02] and the foolish prayers that i have
[2:16:03] asked the lord at different times in my
[2:16:06] life
[2:16:07] and then i mature a little bit and i i
[2:16:11] remember that prayer that i prayed and i
[2:16:14] realized that if god would have done
[2:16:16] what i asked him to do i probably would
[2:16:20] not have survived it
[2:16:24] and so god in his mercy and his love to
[2:16:27] his bride
[2:16:29] one thing at a time he deals with us
[2:16:32] he deals with us he deals with us and
[2:16:35] some things he has to come back to
[2:16:38] because we don't respond in the right
[2:16:40] way
[2:16:41] and so he comes back to it and maybe
[2:16:44] maybe he just comes back to it and we
[2:16:47] still don't respond in the right way
[2:16:49] and so he deals with a couple other
[2:16:52] individual things
[2:16:53] and then he comes back and he deals with
[2:16:56] it
[2:16:57] friends the spirit of conviction is not
[2:17:00] your enemy
[2:17:03] the spirit of reproof is not your enemy
[2:17:08] chastisement is not your enemy
[2:17:11] the chastisement of the lord is not
[2:17:15] something that we should shy away from
[2:17:18] it is something that we should embrace
[2:17:21] when he comes we should be willing to
[2:17:24] say yes lord
[2:17:25] and i'm here to tell you that the only
[2:17:27] reason
[2:17:28] that we say no lord
[2:17:32] is because we're enjoying
[2:17:37] our place
[2:17:40] whatever it is
[2:17:44] we're enjoying it stand with me
[2:17:51] the spirit of conviction
[2:17:54] the prelude to the reverential fear of
[2:17:58] god
[2:18:01] in all of these things see god doesn't
[2:18:04] he doesn't judge after the sight of his
[2:18:08] eyes
[2:18:11] or the hearing of his ears he is god who
[2:18:14] knows all things
[2:18:18] i may not be able to see everything no
[2:18:21] no maybe it's about it i can't see
[2:18:23] everything you can't see everything
[2:18:28] i have tried to judge things many times
[2:18:31] in my life
[2:18:33] by circumstantial evidence
[2:18:37] and i have formed many opinions
[2:18:41] that i wanted to present in the court of
[2:18:44] god's law
[2:18:48] so silly
[2:18:51] so silly to bring my opinions to god's
[2:18:54] court
[2:18:56] and say god this is my opinion i wish
[2:18:59] you would bring it around my way
[2:19:02] so silly friends
[2:19:07] let the spirit of conviction come upon
[2:19:10] you
[2:19:11] be in your life and respond to it
[2:19:15] favorably because as you respond
[2:19:18] favorably to the spirit of conviction
[2:19:22] god will come and he
[2:19:25] that guilty feeling that you have that
[2:19:29] guilty feeling that we feel
[2:19:31] the holy spirit comes and then when we
[2:19:34] repent
[2:19:35] of these things when we repent and say
[2:19:38] lord
[2:19:39] i am the guilty party and i am asking
[2:19:42] you to wash me clean
[2:19:45] david was guilty he was the guilty party
[2:19:50] what did he do he come to the lord wash
[2:19:52] me clean
[2:19:54] purge me lord with his up wash me clean
[2:19:58] blot out my transgressions that's what
[2:20:02] david said he he wanted to get back to a
[2:20:05] place of worship if you've lost your
[2:20:07] worship
[2:20:08] if you've lost your ability to worship
[2:20:11] as david did
[2:20:12] i would encourage you to say lord purge
[2:20:16] me
[2:20:17] purge me cleanse me created
[2:20:20] me a clean heart o god or
[2:20:24] wash me of all of this lord that i
[2:20:28] have held on to the opinion that i
[2:20:30] brought into your court
[2:20:32] it's of none effect oh god it is useless
[2:20:35] in your sight
[2:20:37] i have to come back to the word lord

[2:20:41] you're building sons and daughters ones

[2:21:13] spoken that do not edify
[2:21:16] things and opinions that i have created
[2:21:18] in my own mind
[2:21:20] and they have become larger and larger
[2:21:23] and larger
[2:21:24] until that they're no longer even
[2:21:26] circumstantial evidence
[2:21:28] but they're just uh they're just a tiny
[2:21:32] piece of truth
[2:21:33] and a whole bunch of fabrication lord
[2:21:36] god i call on you for myself
[2:21:40] that you would cleanse me and purify me

[2:21:46] conviction

[2:36:54] him

[2:37:02] you with water unto repentance
[2:37:05] but he that cometh after me is mightier

[2:37:10] whose shoes i am not worthy to bear
