[0:02] Matthew 23:
[0:05] 37-39 oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that
[0:09] killest the prophets and stonest them
[0:11] which are sent unto thee how often would
[0:14] I have gathered thy children together
[0:16] even as a hen gathereth her chickens
[0:18] under her wings and ye would not behold
[0:22] your house is left unto you desolate for
[0:24] I say unto you ye shall not see me
[0:27] henceforth till ye say blessed is he
[0:30] that cometh in the name of the Lord I
[0:33] want to greet you from the Mount of
[0:34] Olives in Jerusalem Israel I'm coming to
[0:37] you today to remind you the importance
[0:40] of praying for the Peace of Jerusalem
[0:43] it's a beautiful day here it's a busy
[0:46] day here on the Overlook of the Mount of
[0:48] Olives there are many tour groups here
[0:50] there are camel rides going on just a
[0:52] few feet away but what's in my heart
[0:54] today is a little chapel that sits right
[0:57] down to my left here it's it's called
[1:00] The Church of Dominus flevit it's the
[1:02] Church of Tears it commemorates the
[1:06] place where these words that I just read
[1:08] to you were spoken by our lord Jesus
[1:10] Yeshua as he looked over the city of
[1:13] Jerusalem and he wept because so many in
[1:17] this city rejected his ministry rejected
[1:20] the testimony that he brought of the
[1:22] father and it broke his heart it breaks
[1:25] my heart to see that even in this day
[1:28] there are so many in this land both Jew
[1:31] and Arab who do not know the Saving
[1:34] Grace that comes through trusting in our
[1:37] savior the Messiah Yeshua but we pray
[1:41] for the Peace of Jerusalem and we pray
[1:43] for Israel and the Jewish people we pray
[1:46] for the Arab people who live in this
[1:48] land that one day as the scripture
[1:50] promises their eyes will be open and
[1:53] they will recognize the one which they
[1:55] have pierced we're here today to bring
[1:59] this into your attention to remind you
[2:02] the importance of remembering Israel
[2:05] When you pray the Bible tells us in
[2:08] Psalms
[2:10] 122:6 pray for the Peace of Jerusalem
[2:13] they shall prosper that love thee the
[2:16] psalmist is not only giving us
[2:18] instruction that we should remember to
[2:21] pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and for
[2:24] all of Israel but he is attaching to
[2:27] that prayer a promise Pro and the
[2:31] promise is they shall prosper that love
[2:34] thee so there is a blessing that is
[2:37] attached to this instruction to pray for
[2:41] the Peace of Jerusalem if you will
[2:43] remember this city in your prayers and
[2:45] her people God will prosper you and
[2:49] bless you that reveals the heart of God
[2:52] for the city of Jerusalem and for the
[2:55] Jewish people so much that he says if
[2:57] you will remember them if you will pray
[3:00] for her I will prosper you and I will
[3:04] bless you another Psalm that's very
[3:07] special to us is Psalms
[3:09] 137:
[3:10] 5-6 if I forget thee Oh Jerusalem let my
[3:15] right hand forget her cunning if I do
[3:18] not remember thee let my tongue cleave
[3:21] to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not
[3:24] Jerusalem above my chief joy and then
[3:28] another verse of scripture the prophet
[3:30] Isaiah says in Isaiah 62 and verse 1 for
[3:34] Zion's sake will I not hold my peace and
[3:38] for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest
[3:42] until the righteousness thereof go forth
[3:45] as brightness and the Salvation thereof
[3:48] as a lamp that burneth it doesn't take
[3:52] too much time to uh skim Through the
[3:54] Bible and see multitudes of scriptures
[3:58] about the city of Jerusalem about Zion
[4:01] about Mount Moriah or morah we think of
[4:05] Abraham Abraham Our Father we think of
[4:08] our Lord Yeshua here in the city of
[4:11] Jerusalem for the Feast of dedication he
[4:14] was here for seot right across this
[4:16] Valley here on the Temple Mount we think
[4:19] about a time that the scriptures record
[4:22] that Yeshua came to the Mount of Olives
[4:24] and it was on that particular visit that
[4:27] the leaders brought this little woman to
[4:30] him who had been caught in the act of
[4:32] adultery we also find in the scripture
[4:34] that on this very Mountain often Yeshua
[4:36] would pull away from the hustle and
[4:38] bustle of the upper City he would come
[4:41] to this mountain with his disciples
[4:43] perhaps he would find a quiet cave and
[4:46] there are caves very near to where I'm
[4:48] standing right now uh near a church
[4:51] where uh The Lord's Prayer is printed in
[4:55] in many many different languages to
[4:58] commemorate perhaps the very area where
[5:00] our Lord was teaching his disciples to
[5:03] pray I could go on forever about the
[5:06] wonderful miraculous things that have
[5:09] taken place in this city but I want to
[5:11] remind you that the destiny of this city
[5:14] is not just what she has been or what
[5:17] God has accomplished here there are
[5:20] still Great and Mighty things that are
[5:22] going to be accomplished in the city of
[5:24] Jerusalem the prophets have prophesied
[5:27] and the word of the Lord cannot fail it
[5:30] has to come to pass so whatever you're
[5:32] doing right now I invite you to just
[5:35] take a moment and stop what you're doing
[5:38] and pray for the Peace of Jerusalem pray
[5:41] for the Jewish people there's never been
[5:43] a more important hour to stand with
[5:46] Israel and I just wanted to bless you
[5:49] today and send you love and thank you
[5:52] for making it possible for us to be here
[5:55] in this holy city praying and
[5:58] prophesying and declaring the future
[6:01] that God has already promised by the
[6:04] prophets in his word Shalom from
[6:09] [Music]
[6:28] Jerusalem
