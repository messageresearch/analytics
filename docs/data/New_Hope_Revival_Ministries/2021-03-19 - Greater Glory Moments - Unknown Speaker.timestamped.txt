[0:00] we haven't seen the greater glory
[0:03] the greater glory is ahead
[0:08] [Music]
[0:14] i'm not going gonna let wearing glasses
[0:16] kill me i want my eyes healed oh how i'd
[0:19] like to not
[0:19] ever have to use these glasses anymore
[0:22] but i'm thankful to have them
[0:24] do you understand paul didn't have any
[0:27] glasses
[0:28] he's riding in a in a dungeon he's
[0:30] writing in memory in prison
[0:32] in a hole in the rock in rome
[0:36] he's writing the epistles to the church
[0:38] by a little flicker of light
[0:40] and poor eyesight and yet he said i want
[0:43] to make sure
[0:44] that i don't get puffed up in these
[0:46] revelations
[0:48] but i want to recognize that god has
[0:50] given me a gift
[0:54] a thorn in the flesh
[0:57] wrapped up with a bow you're with me
[1:01] [Music]
[1:03] i'm an angel of satan he's given me
[1:08] to pummel me to buffet me
[1:12] [Music]
[1:13] to hit me in every direction over
[1:16] everything i do
[1:18] and yet i'm going to learn to rejoice
[1:20] i'm going to take pleasure
[1:22] in my infirmities and in my reproaches
[1:24] and in my necessities
[1:26] and in my persecutions if you have
[1:28] convinced yourself that that's only for
[1:30] new testament believers
[1:32] those who live contemporary in the new
[1:34] testament
[1:35] you're wrong i'm telling you
[1:39] if it was available to the first church
[1:41] age
[1:42] bride it's available to the last church
[1:44] age bride
[1:46] and maybe you believe what i believe i
[1:48] believe all the evils of every church
[1:50] age were gathered into the last laodicea
[1:52] and in that same regard i believe that
[1:55] every anointing
[1:56] and every glory and every strength and
[1:59] every power
[2:00] that was given to those believers in all
[2:03] of those church ages
[2:04] has now fallen upon us in this last
[2:07] church
[2:08] age by the grace of the lord here is the
[2:11] first church age messenger telling us
[2:14] that he came to enjoy
[2:18] [Music]
[2:21] he came to enjoy the infirmities
[2:27] can you imagine
[2:31] can you imagine saying here he comes
[2:34] again
[2:37] i run that old boy off and there the
[2:39] devil comes again
[2:43] paul had a revelation he got caught up
[2:46] above what it felt like
[2:48] he got caught up above what it smelled
[2:50] like
[2:51] what it sounded like what it looked like
[2:54] what it felt like
[2:55] he got caught up above that and he knew
[2:58] there was a greater glory coming
[3:00] he knew that this was necessary it was
[3:04] necessary to keep him at the right place
[3:09] to keep his soul in the right place his
[3:12] spirit in the right place
[3:13] his flesh in the right place because of
[3:16] greater glory
[3:17] i tell you church we haven't seen the
[3:20] greater glory
[3:22] the greater glory is ahead
[3:27] and we if we could just catch a glimpse
[3:29] of it
[3:31] hallelujah some people they're in the
[3:34] heat of the battle
[3:36] and they sing songs about heaven
[3:39] and eternity and living with the lord
[3:43] and it causes them to rejoice
[3:47] they can get through oh they can get
[3:50] past
[3:51] how many of you been coming through some
[3:53] things let me see your hand
[3:55] been coming through i'm not through
[4:00] i'm coming through i'm still being
[4:03] squeezed through the pipe
[4:05] but i'm coming out the other side
[4:08] hallelujah
[4:09] with a greater glory and there's a key
[4:13] there's a key
[4:15] there is a key to getting there faster
[4:17] than not
[4:21] and that key is coming to a place where
[4:24] you can say
[4:25] thank you lord
[4:28] [Music]
