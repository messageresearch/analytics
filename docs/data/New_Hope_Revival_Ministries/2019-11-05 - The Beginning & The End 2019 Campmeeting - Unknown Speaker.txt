the church says Amen god bless you in the name of the Lord just thank you for the hospitality all that you've been doing for us we thank you for your prayers for my mother and it's just a Rebecca's grandmother she passed on to be with the Lord this evening and so we thank God that she knows I have to suffer no more he meant that she's made it over to be with her husband and different ones over there so we're thankful God for that just just thank God that he's allowed us to be here tonight you know I I just appreciate amen everything that's been done we just feel like family with you here amongst you tonight and it's a great honor to be here with brother Brooks known him for a long time we preached from my grandpa and just a fireball back then and he still is today amen and brothers Shelly he preached from my grandpa also and my dad and different ones and and so I believe it was my dad that baptized brother Shelly and and so I just remember those good old days but these theses were good old days save man and so we're just thankful that he meant the Lord didn't save us to lose us in my own praise the Lord he saved us to keep us is that right and you can never fall out of the hands of the Lord he man he won't drop your church man he won't drop you hey man just don't let go of him that's the main thing I just desire your prayers tonight the Lord will lead us into his word and it was a great confirmation to me last night to see brother Brooks come in and just come right in the same channel with us and I just I've been preaching on some things there at the home church and I I didn't want to bring those things unless the Lord wanted me to I just come neutral seek him for the leadership of the Lord but as we walked out those doors last other night we didn't know exactly what was going to go with but the Lord took control amen and the Lord vindicated the two last night and settled me he meant to know everything's gonna be alright now we're Christians right so if you turn over to first John chapter 2 I just see everything that God has ordained for us to be here even while I got here I just seen her footsteps ordered by the Lord I woke up by the morning craving pancakes hey man and so I I I told my wife I said I'm craving pancakes and I gotta find me some pancakes down the road somewhere in and I looked on my phone and googled best pancakes near me and I I bypassed I'll hop and on you that wasn't all the good things and so I found some pancakes made from scratch a truth ins five-star I went down there and we said we begin to eat and all of a sudden when I put that first bite in on you I had found the right pancake hey man and so then here comes in some believers in behind us and and all the waiters are running to him like there was so happy to see him and so we got to looking and it was believers from this church and so we we just begin to have fellowship there and the sister says what made you come here I said well I woke up this morning craving pancakes and I googled it and it says Ruth Ann says she says well do you know this lady right here is Ruth in I was like get back praise the Lord Amen the owners in the house so Amen I didn't know that but God is so good to us and the little sisters bought our meal and I could pray God will just return a blessing upon them amen like for you to turn back over to first John with us again chapter 2 verse 24 verse 24 says let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you also shall continue in the Son and in the father how many wants to continue and this is the promise that he have promised us even eternal life these things have I written unto you concerning them that would seduce you but the anointing don't you praise God for the anointing which you have received of him you have it tonight abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth and there's no lie and even as it had taught you you shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be shamed before him at his coming another scripture over here in John chapter 6 verse 39 [Music] and this is the Father's will which has sent me and that of all which he have given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day amen and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see if the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day that's a promise and he's looking forward to it you believe you're in the last days then we should see the coming of the Lord amen father we thank you for the reading of the word take your slaughter we're just a conduit just a vessel Lord a North East lips Lord speak the Word of God I pray Lord that will tap into your presence now tap into the word the theophany God Lord hear and firm our theophany Lord let us Lord fall into the presence of them Almighty God may we be rapture bound here tonight move up on us Lord Holy Ghost stir our hearts and minds Lord father bring back that remembrance that we were with you in the beginning as we give you glory and praise in Jesus Christ's name you can be seated tonight amen thinking about this let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning I mean how many heard from the beginning and he says if now only if if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain not just you heard it but it's got a remain church Amen it's got to stay on your mind you got to be interested in it is that right you got to be focused in it it's it's a watch and that's a a watching and being ready is that right Amen it's remaining in you you also shall continue in the son now I know why a lot of people is not continuing amen is because they're not interested in the word anymore hey man it's not continuing in them so then they lose their desires is that right amen so what is it hearing from the beginning what is it that gives that's that's so powerful about it because he says if you've heard from the beginning and then let it remain as Elkin you shall continue so there's something that'll give us something amen that'll help us to continue is that right amen so we could think about this that hearing from the beginning and it gives us some kind of a super strength hey man praise the Lord it gives us a super strength amen of a quickening power a mint that helps us to continue and the mania started the race mineus run the race but there be few that'll finish the race is that right Amen you know it there's no even used to think about starting the race if you're not going to finish it is that right Amen hallelujah a champion Amen will start the race and he'll win the race is that right Amen and I say we we have been introduced to the champion tonight hallelujah amen and I want to tell you God has never lost a battle he's never lost a battle amen and I tell you amen only the battle that the devil ever lost is when he come up against God Amen is our eye and I want to tell you who's on the Lord's side tonight among us is going to be the ones that's going to fight the fight is gonna be the one that won't give in to the devil it's gonna finish the race by the help of the Lord Amen hallelujah so I'm looking for a meant to see you amongst us Amen don't cross the finish line amen honey I want to see you Amen I want to be here at the finish line right I mean so when we go back to the beginning and listen to that beginning word we're going to hear from our theophany because the prophet of God says we bypassed our theophany is that right so we got to figure out why there's so much power in going back to the beginning because we gotta have the revelation the understanding what the Prophet said when he said we bypassed our theophany it wasn't our fault Amen but we did it for a reason is that right so we could come down into this falling to stay into this power into this body into this weak vessel and to realize ami we need a Savior we need a healer we need somebody to save us is that right amen hallelujah and I thank God that He has allowed us to be able to do that because now I know what a mighty God we serve now I know what he's done for me amen hallelujah and so we realized when we go back we're going back to where our theophany was well I like to hear about that don't you I mean we're going back to where we bypassed something and so what I realize is when we that theophany is a word body it's a word body and do you realize every one of us has got a theophany every one of us has got a theophany every believer has got a theophany body glory to God and when you're hearing the word you're hearing from your theophany a believer a Christian cannot die praise the Lord Amen he's already dead Amen he died on his second birth praise the Lord Amen he died and he received on you birth and now he's a believer and he cannot die he died the death of the nature that was in him but now he's picking up the life of God and the prophet of God winner and he says he when he hears when he receives that Spirit of God he is now hearing from his theophany hallelujah praise the Lord and so tonight I say let's hear from our theophany let's tap into something that we may have not been tapping into something I'm looking for a change or at you I'm looking for some and I'd like to get in a science lab and be able to explore find something that's powerful a meant something that can do something Amen hollow that the world ain't got a hold of yet amen and so we realized that when we are hearing from the beginning I believe if we could go back into Genesis there and we see what God had in his plan he man will realize see man how great our God is a man and there'll be a never place in our life that we'll ever get angry with God will never get upset with God we'll be okay with God's plan hey man is that right amen and so that's the reason we took you to Enoch just other night amen because Enoch was interested is that right and we realized Adam lived 930 years that's a long time so he got to see a lot of generations come up and some maybe we would just refresh your memory maybe some of some of visitors maybe or someone some of you don't know about Enoch but in Genesis chapter 5 it says in Enoch he says he lived sixty and five years and and he says and begot Methuselah and Methuselah was the oldest one in the Bible and it says and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him and so that's that's explosive right there and when we got to find out it men if we want to be an anak amen that we could tap into what Enoch was tapping in amen and so we can think about Adam was still alive when Enoch was alive and we could think Adam was in our great great great great grandpa maybe but there's something about Enoch that he was interested in from hearing about because he knew that Adam was the first man upon the earth now to the other cousins and the other boys maybe that wasn't interested in them amen but something in this man was interesting a man is that right everybody could call him grandpa but Enoch says this is more than grandpa this is the first man his daddy was gone and that just amazes me George say something about this word that amazes me but there's nothing in the world that gets my attention like this word does I hope that's in us all here tonight we could be at a lot of places but were drawn to the word and it says the Eagles are gathered around the carcass is that right and so I believe the children of God are Eagles and we're concerned about the word and so we realized the ena took he says we could think about Enoch he could go down to his grandpa grandpa great great great Grandpa's house and he could go down to Adams tent and have fellowship with him and because he was interested in hearing about that beginning a many stirred up something like a magnet drawling him him every day he got to hear more and the more he heard the more he wanted I pray that's the way you are the more you hear about this learn the more it stirs a craving you is that right and so it stirs something in him and so we're looking at Enoch he's going back amen and hearing something that was in the beginning praise the Lord he's got somebody that was in the beginning that can tell him what it was about right Oh church it's good to have something that'll take you back to the beginning raise the Lord is that right Amen somebody that was there somebody could tell you what it was about oh my Amen I told you how to deny all the things that Adam was that were not here he had never had a Batman Murray he never had a negative running through his mind he just come alive and he was there amen everything was perfect in his life so different from us because of the fall was that right but Enoch was stirred by the relationship of God coming down and talking to ena I stirred in his heart and it he wanted that is that right so we could say Enoch was hearing from the beginning but see I'm not here to take you back I meant God is never taking us back he's taking us forward so Enoch could go and hear the word of the beginning and he could bring it up into his day to his house Amen right to his street corner right to his church amen and preach that same word Amen not going back but going forward with what he heard from the beginning Enoch wasn't trying to get in the garden he was trying to get that fellowship again Oh Church wouldn't you like to have that fellowship with God every day just talking with the Lord hey man that's why we're here tonight have that fellowship with the Lord and so Enoch took that and went forward with that desire of fellowship with God and so we understand that when he was taking that revelation when he was hearing he was building that pyramid by what he was hearing and that pyramid became the second Bible he means that right the stars in the sky was the first God's first Bible and then he said that pyramid became God's second Bible and we realized when God destroyed the earth the only thing that was standing was the pyramid he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away everything was destroyed in Noah's day except for the pinna I mean the pyramid why because that was he knocks revelation that he heard from the beginning and it stood the whole earth was destroyed but that were stood there in his dog today it's in the perfect place that it never casts a shadow a supernatural church that's powerful where did he get that knowledge he got it from the beginning is that right so we see that Enoch was picking up his theophany he was hearing from his word that word theophany amen in he was taking it home and built an opponent it became something greater than what the garden was hmm so that's what I'm trying to show you tonight the title of the message tonight he saved the best for last okay God's not taking us backwards he's taking us for church we're not trying to get in the garden amen we're trying to get in the fellowship with God is that right and I'll prove some of these things here tonight by the scriptures amen and and then so Enoch became heavenly instead of earthly is that right he was walking earthly but he was hearing from the beginning and while he was on the earth God was raising him up and raising him up he was walking with God and then one day he was not because God took him there I and that's what we're doing Amy we're walking with God every day and God has taken us up up up is that right amen and so we see that you don't took the word from the beginning and possessed it and became something better Adam was still a man on the earth but Enoch had something better that it took him off the earth is that right Adam had that fellowship but Enoch took that same fellowship walk with God and it took him up praise the Lord so we're looking for something better all time it's going to get better they thought it's not a god of getting worse god is the god of getting better praise the Lord he don't want you sick he said I want you to prosper and be in good health he said I'll heal you of all manner diseases that doesn't mean that we won't get the sickness that means we'll get diseases but he's going to heal us of all of those things so we got to be willing to get it so he can shows that he's a healer of it hey man praise the Lord amen so we think about that how great that is a man from general Isaac 41 4 says who hath wrought and done it he's calling the generations from the beginning I the Lord the first and with the last I am he so let's think about a skinner fault here tonight here from the beginning but he's saving the best for the last 1st Peter 1 9 through 12 it says receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come not into them but unto us something better coming to us is that right searching war what manner of the time of the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before hand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they didn't minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into Wow even the angels are looking for something to come and to look into is that right amen Hebrews 11 39 through 40 it says and these all talking about the Old Testament things and this is the faith chapter all these warriors all these heroes of faith having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect right as the brother says the earth is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God oh there's a perfect coming church I want to say the perfect is here it's time to realize we're got something that'll make us perfect amen Johnson no longer winking that Wigner's Church his words been poured out in this endtime he means that right talking about the last days in a moment of twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed so there's a promise just like Enoch had Amen that something took him amen so in the last days we're gonna hear something that's going to take us back to the beginning and give us that fellowship with God ain't meant that it's going to raise us up out of here just like Enoch did and I'm gonna believe that I'm gonna be one of them that's gonna take out of here one of these days I see the signs all around us telling this it's time to go home is that right hallelujah first Peter 1:20 just getting you're getting your thoughts up on this better whoo verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifested in the last times for you in other words not everybody not every age is gonna have the revelation that we have in this last stage of what God's whole purpose is so I scriptures I'm pretty happy Amen that I'm living in this day were they in the last church age we're in living in the last days amen hallelujah amen this is the best of the best you say bye brother Darren do you realize how gross darkness is it is out there I say absolutely I agree with you but I tell you the more darker it is the more you shine the more the light of God shines and I say it's time to be light it's time to show that we're some Enochs here that's going to take a rapture glory to God is that right now let's come on up to Jesus's day okay and so we're talking about possessing not going back but going hearing from the beginning and possessing in that day so we spoke about Jesus when he comes up in his day and we got all of these religious people that thinks they're all right where they're at and then they come with him with amen some of the things that Moses allowed them to do and they says Moses allowed us to put away our lives for any calls right amen hallelujah for any calls to put away amen and Jesus come he says but Moses did it for the hardness of your hearts he wasn't messed up in marriage and divorce friends he was just a man hallelujah amen having to deal with everybody's problems that didn't want to live the word and he was allowing these things to take place but here comes the word the second Adam and he says but it was not so in the beginning oh brother Amy he didn't kind of just let us go on him in in our own day a day of confusion he picked us back to the beginning Jesus pick us back to the beginning of the first marriage in the Bible and said this man loved his wife Amy she came out of him and he she was part of him he didn't want to put her away he wanted a library keeper right have you thought about where you come from any born-again believer has come out of Christ here man raise the Lord and he's gonna take any kind of excuse to put us away he's wanting to keep us but I like that he took him back to the beginning and said it wasn't so in the beginning is that right amen see he took us back to the beginning and possessed the truth to bring it back to a man and his wife a man we're to possessing the truth Church a man it's funny how we can go on up the road and lose contact with the truth but if we'll go back to what the beginning said go back what God said in the beginning it'll practice it'll get us straight now he said teach your children to teach their children to pitch their children the truth amen I'd like for you to turn over with me into John chapter 2 you love him the man is good to us I hope you enjoy this I've read this story over and over but until just the other day I really got something revealed to me stirred my heart verse 1 and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother Jesus was there and both Jesus was called and his disciples were called to what to a marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus said in him they have no wine jesus said in her woman what have I do with thee to do with thee mine hour is not yet come his mother said unto the servants whatsoever he says to you do it and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the Jews containing two or three firkins apiece so let's get this so we're come to a marriage here and the custom is is when they come into this marriage they bring out the good wine that they God write and then as they begin the drink and you can't drink one and keep drinking it without a little bit of stimulation starting to come right amen praise the Lord this word is stimulation and when you start hearing from the beginning it starts stimulating is that right Amy and so they begin the drink and and the custom was that after they begin to drink the good wine then they started slowly bringing in the junky wine right amen because they got a little stimulated so they could sneak it in on them and they weren't quite notice it right do you realize that's what the devil is doing through the churches today they get a little bit of word thinking they got everything they need and then the slewfoot a devil begins to bring in all his mass all of his perversion and and they're already drunk on the things amen hallelujah they don't notice what the devil is big doing to them and the devil seducing them so right we'll all kinds of false doctrine different things is that right amen that's what the devil can do amen but we see that when when they begin to get stimulated on the good wine then they start bringing all out the the worse and and so evidently they had had enough marriages evidently in that year that they had run out of the bad wine they had gifts so much of the worst wine out that they didn't have no more bad wine to run it right they had run out of the worst of the worst well I want to tell you we're living in the day amen the worst is here Satan has got the whole worse out here hell is enlarged itself it's here the whole world is full of corruption is that right MA praise the Lord it's terrible the hour we're living it so they had run out of it and so Jesus is just sitting there like anybody else and so they call Tony his mother's trying to get something done here and so Jesus just quietly gets up maybe he goes in the basement where these pots are and there's water laying there and he secretly does a work over this Zehra and so he prays over this or whatever he does and then Olsen is turned into wine right so all those men that's standing there saying what's this stranger doing and they looking at water and then all sudden it's red its wine hey hey this is amazing how'd it go from that to this it skipped all the process and maybe the guy took his finger dipped it into it was a wow this does already fermented it this stuff's already stout and strong and skip all the process it just went water to wine blow it ago a mint so they they Jesus goes back sets down in his chair like you know just nothing has done and so they bring it up and enter the ruler of the house amen they they grab the drink in the cases of it and he says hey here I gotta say something about this see he didn't know they ran out of wine holily he says most of the time when we do these things he said we bring out the good wine he said and we get drunk off of it and then they bring out the worst but he said but this marriage y'all saved the best for last oh brother I wanna take it was wine in the beginning but it's better wine in the end somebody has something to do with this it was the man over in the corner that has something to do with it it's the man that could create it's the man that knowed the beginning to the end the match was different this time because there was somebody in their house that knew how to do things I'm telling you we're in a marriage today you're getting married to Jesus here and we're going to emerge Supper is that right amen and I tell you God has been giving us wine and we started out in Genesis with good revelation praise the Lord Amen but there's a lot of things begin to happen from Genesis all the way up I mean even got destroyed it because the imagination of men's minds he got bad he got bad this and that this and that but when Jesus came along a man he started taking this back to the beginning he said it was not so from the beginning oh brother he was bringing some new revelation out he's bringing some new wine out to the people it's time to get stimulated it's time to get drunk on the Word of God is that right it got so real that when the people were in the upper room amen hallelujah staring they got drunk on the revelation of God and beginning a stagger like drunk man prophesy a mean speaking languages that was not in her own time they got drunk because of the new wine and the Bible says we can't put new wine in old bottles praise the Lord sons gonna happen if we do I want to tell you touch this D wine Amen polities gotta be puttin you vassals well we're at the end of the marriage church it ain't time he meant to get all the old stuff back hell it's time to get the new revelation God's pouring out in this in time the Saint Jesus was in that marriage is right here here tonight amen he's here to give us something good some that we're here for in the beginning that's going to take us through our theophany Alleluia is that right amen he saved the best for last I like that hey man it's not that they kept the good wine it's the last it's because Jesus was there Zehra man had nothing to do with this wine it was the true creator turning back his grapes back to one rah hey hey man we're not hearing from a man's religion in this hour we're not living in a reforming age that this man had something to do with in this man we have been restored back amen hallelujah and the Genesis or a revelation chapter five no one was worthy to open the book amen nobody Enoch nobody could stand up and take the book had a man said right and he said I well crime who is worthy and then he said I heard a voice behind me saying Amen behold the line of tribe of Judah had prevail I mean he's turned and looked and that was a lamp Ryanair and what's it a four legged lamb it was that land that John saw I'm Caffrey amen dying his blood pouring out Oh brothers and sisters it stimulated John in order to stimulate us this whole Bible through the ages is being closed but now it's open hey man hallelujah has become a new Bible to us revelation after revelation is pouring out to us is that right amen we're hearing from the beginning so the batter what is it the best for last hey man let's turn over to John 1:1 when you get that hold your place and turn over to Genesis 1 let's look at Genesis 1 in the beginning going back to the beginning in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth huh so he's saying in the beginning who God created what the heaven and the earth yeah right and he tells us how the earth was looking over to John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God call now if we go to Genesis 1 it just takes us back to the heavens and the earth but if we go John 1:1 here and he says in the beginning was the word it's still the same thing it's not contradicting but it's a little bit more detailed is that right amen John 1:1 is a little bit more detailed than Genesis 1 even though that's the seat chapter that's the beginning but John 1:1 is give us just a little bit more further back and he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God is that right praise the Lord but it gets better than the night it gets better than that because God is not just send us a man in this day he sent a prophet and a prophet is born the Prophet and a prophet is a seer and he can see where there's far as God lets him see or you can see way back there as far God would allow him to see and see amen God says I will do nothing except I reveal utley my service the prophets I mean so they are our eyes they are eyes to see whatever the prophecies because nothing will be revealed to us unless it comes through the Prophet God never done anything with the childress or unless he done it with Moses or unless he did it with Joshua is that right amen Moses was God's force to those people and if God would send us a prophet in our day his eyes as our eyes his voice is what we're hearing the words of God is that right hey man so I'm not ashamed to say that God has sent us a prophet in this day and I'm not ashamed to say he saved the best for last if I could take you back in the questions answers in 1953 you lied to 29th he begins to speak like this he said the first creation was God himself then out of God came the logos I didn't hear nothing about logos then out of the logos which was the word and the word was made flesh into one among us listen this he says oh I got a beautiful picture in my mind now oh you're ready to go back into the beginning amen let this remain in you if you could take a little trip with me I believe I've talked on it before but to get this to the place where you be sure to see it now let's take a little trip and go back for a little while don't think about how hard it is or our minds right on what everything's going on let's go back a hundred million years before there was ever a star moon or anything that's before Genesis and one hey man praise the Lord this bride in this last day's getting ready take a trip before and go past Genesis 1 and go father this is going to do something for the Bride of Christ well we're going to go back into the thoughts of God where we was in the thoughts of his thoughts where did we come from out of the thoughts of God he said our names were on the lens book of life before the foundation of the world that's before Genesis 1 church amen I'm going to go back now to where my name was in his book hallelujah he said let's go back a hundred million years before there was ever a star a moon or anything in the world now there was a time when there wasn't nothing here it was just all forever and eternity and all ever and eternity was God he was there in the beginning he said let's go out on the edge of this banister and look over and see these things happen no man has seen the father at any time no man see God in the body form because God is not in a body form God is a spirit all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father had declared him now but notice now there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing that's way back friends but in there is a great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space of all places at all times he was from everlasting to everlasting he is the beginning of creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move an atom in the air nothing amen but yet God was there that was God he said now let's watch for a few minutes and no man has seen that he says no notice then after a while I begin to see a little sacred I begin to form like a little halo or something you ever seen a halo a real one you could only see it by spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what God's doing you say I don't see it well I'm telling you about it's a prophet telling you so you can see it so you know yeah I gotta say Lord let me see let me have eyes to see let me have ears to hear I'm interested see it's just like that the boy on the street corner he wasn't interested in Jesus because he was in love with other things I said but I met Jesus I was like you I met Jesus and now I'm interested you can't help be interested until you meet him and then if you meet him and you like it a mint then you were interested see some of this might not be interesting to you but if you ever meet Jesus and want to know where you come from you're gonna be interested in this is that right and when you're interested it's gonna remain in you to the coming of the Lord amen so he says and after a while I begin to see a little sacred light begin to form a little halo he said you could only see it by spiritual eyes I hope you got them tonight to look now while we're looking he said we're standing on a great big banister watching what God's doing and we'll get right down to this question here and you'll see how he brings it in now no one has seen God and he says we see this little white light forming out here what is that that was called by Bible readers logos or the anointing or the anointing that's what we read in John 2 there about that unknown him amen and he says and God began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was it was a little light moving he was that word of God and he said now God gave himself birth to his son which was before there was even an atom God's giving birth he said the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world your names were planted in the lenzburg life before the foundation or God's making a plan of you and me before the beginning of creation earth he said before the bride leaves here she'll know where she come from who she is and where she's going and this is the way we're going to know he said God was giving birth to his son which before there was even the Adam before iyer to make an Adam Jesus said glory find me father with the glory that we had before the foundation in the world Jesus was going back to the beginning when he was fixing the die for his friends he said glory find me Lord with the glory that I have with you in the beginning we can say that same prayer Lord gloy found me with what you had with me in the beginning Oh amen he said Jesus said glorify me follow with the glory we had before the foundation world see way back in yonder now back there win this little halo combs we can't see nothing but just by eyes of just supernatural we see a halo standing there and that's the Son of God the logos and I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity Oh hallelujah the family was their church and now then in his imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be and I can hear say let there be light and when he did and Adam bursted and the son came into existence she world for hundreds of millions of years forming clinkers and burning and forming like it is today and still burning and still breaking Adams God's sling that stuff out there like a frisbee and just let it go and let it go and let it go and he says stop and it stopped and one day he sling this earth out there and he's slinging in when I'll tell you how they're out there and he says stop and the prophet of God says those stars are further from each other than they are from us to them oh my god he's great Church our God is marvelous he's great he's huge praise the Lord no wonder he could look at a tree cesare curse you and right then the life in the root died and Satan tries that same stuff and he can't do it Church if we realize who we are we can look at cancer right in the face and say I curse you because Satan still cursed and anything that he tries to curse us with we can curse it can you say man send it back to hell put it right back on the devil because we know who we are huh praise the Lord he said God in these last days is restoring back to the church again do you believe that isn't he wonderful to do it aren't we happy to be alive tonight to see it our eyes are beholding things that the prophets desired to see just before the second coming of the Lord we're seeing things tonight that the prophets desired to see but they didn't see it because they hadn't had this last prophet on the earth to be able to allow God allowed him to go back that far to see these things Daniel seen it but he's got to where the Lord says seal it up right someone seats just partial just portions of the word but in the last days in the last days God was going to take the lid off of it he's going to break the sales off the Word of God it's going to come down with an open book and reveal it all to us don't tell me the last thing better praise the Lord is that right so what are we doing we're possessing that truth in the beginning and bringing it up to our day and living on it they're right we're possessors here tonight Church possessors of the truth that right taking the truth he said the truth the word will defeat Satan anytime anyplace anywhere we got to come to that understanding of knowing the authority of the believers were possessors like Abraham can you say a man he was a possessor God told him something he possessed it that right I mean he knew who he was the prophet of God says when those kings come down and scold his nephew from that city down there law and all of them he said that was 2,000 of them men that took Kenan locked down there he said Abraham stood up and gathered his 12 men and said I'm going after my nephew and he went after his nephew down to those two thousand people slaughtered in Kings destroyed and took blood and everything that he had took from him and brought it back God likes to see victory and here comes God before Jesus Christ he steps down in a body of milk as a day and meets Abraham because he was a possessor God wants to see possessors in this stage that right he had a revelation Abraham did right this God has called me and separated me for my people to be a possessor we're possessors here tonight church we take back what the devil tries to steal from us can you say man he's a like a thief he's growing like a line trying to steal away this still away that and the most thing he's trying to stay away is the truth but we're taking back the truth they might praise the Lord hallelujah it's better and better and better they're right look at that lamp stand one time God allows Moses and men to see what was in the heavens and God says now what you've seen go down here on the earth and build it that tabernacle there I everything has got to be like it was there and then you know so he sees this lamp stand and he gotta build it up the way God told him to build a gyro and God says now I want you to take pure olive oil and put it in these lamps amen and I want you to burn and let it burn always huh he's got a burn always praise the Lord and he had a Moses to tell Aaron to put the fire on all right and so they lit it and it's burning and then one day Amen these sons of Aaron let's it go out right brothers and sisters I want to tell you God's get of us a lantern he's given us a light and it's up to us to keep it burning let this truth remain in you gods give us a fire to burn he's give us a message in this in time and he's put it right there in your face to eat it and eat it and get stimulated and get Revelator by it but if we're gonna be like the sons of Aaron and just play around Church and let it go Wow come on let it go out because we're concerned with everything else and then those men snuck around and say oh we've really messed up here amen this original lie has been burning since God told it to be burning and we would let it go out so we're gonna get out hearing to find I get a lie and we're gonna bring it back here and get this thing burning so nobody realized what's happened and they brought strange fire to the lamp and God strike them dead right there at the door because he don't want no strange fire right praise the Lord God wants us to go back to the original Word and stay with the original all the way through is there I what God has started he's able to finish let's let him start it let's let him finish him you ain't got nothing to do it he said I bought you a surprise you're mine Amen hallelujah Amen you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord don't you defile the temple amen we've got to keep eating this word and let that ami keep burning in our lives is that right raisin Lord you say well it's just a lampstand yeah in the beginning it was just the lampstand well if you turn over here in revelations chapter 1 John in the end of the book heard a voice talking behind him he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and the prophet of God said John tights the bride whatever John sees we see whatever John hears we hear and John is going back to the beginning and he's going up to the future and he's going here and he's going there brother I tell you God's had this bride all over the Bible he's giving this word after word line upon line precept upon precept Enoch had to bottom all the way to the top he didn't build a half a word he not built the whole pyramid and God capped it off with coming and taking Enoch out of there we're not taking a half a word Church God has opened this word up in this end time and we got all the word we got all truth to build a perfect life upon that right Amen it's up to us to keep it burning and it says John Saturn and seen that voice and he's seen a lampstand and then the myths of the lampstand it gets better it's not just a candlestick it's not just light but in the midst of camp saying is the son of man it's God in this word God in his lamp stand God in his truth say it's better get some more revelation more truth right amen praise the Lord prophet of God said will be the final voice in the final age they're right more truths revealed to us he says we've got to go through and get that character they meant to be that final voice in the final age said I amen and that's why we're going through all these testings and troubles trials so it can be that spoken word hey man is that right I mean you can speak to the mountain and to be tossed into the sea that right it'll not to be a public show but it'll be an individual fire present look it'll be a little headache that you got it'll be your child that's sick it's going back and possessing a man what had them in the beginning having dominion having power the authority the spoken word is alright so we're going back and hearing this truth taking it up to our day bringing it home to our family brothers don't be afraid to speak the word amen is that right God wants to take this stimulation we go and get Revelator by and be able to speak to our problems at home speak to our car speak to the devil that's tried to interfere with our daily walk right hey man praise the Lord glory to God amen you know in the prophets life God give him some visions just like he did John give prophets visions alright it says in no words in that third pool you might not understand him your postures are good amen reveals some of that stuff to you but I don't think the bride's got it all figured out is that right but I believe it's gonna be revealed to us because we're just like Enoch taking one stone upon another stone and going up into higher places in Christ Jesus is that right and we see that the prophet of God he's brought before a cathedral and he's up above this Cathedral and he's looking down upon this and he sees some these people that are lined up and going through this Cathedral and when they go in he said that they're lame they're sick afflicted and then when they come through and they come to the end there's a reporter on the end that says what happened in there and they said I don't know what happened but all I know it was I was crippled and now look at me right amen but in the story there the prophet of God in the vision he says when I was up above this he said there was something that happened that I've never seen before he says the age of the Lord and we know the ancient Lord was with the prophet of God he said the pillar fire separated from the angel the Lord and he said he went down over to that Cathedral and began to hover over it and he said all of a sudden he went straight down into the room the prophets looking down upon this and the pillar fire is in the room hey man hallelujah look at Paul one day he's killing these Jesus people but he's serving God is that right amen he thinks he's doing God a service and he's killing these fanatic Jesus people one day is riding a horse and he comes along and all sudden the great light shines upon him knocks him off from the horse and he says Lord and GE God says I'm Jesus knocks him off with his heart church amen he thought he was doing something but he realized what his doing was totally wrong oh god Amy got ahold of the Prophet and restored and possessed the truth back to Paul right he took this experience on the backside of the desert and he took it back to the beginning just like we've been and found out this Jesus was a light in the beginning and now he could trace him all the way back down to the age oh brother we got a truth in this our day we can take the devil back to his beginning and take it to his in and say devil a man I got something on you devil I know where you started and I know your finish line but I can do something else I can take the devil and show you where I was in the beginning and where I'm gonna end up no brother we got something that we can be shouting about we got a revelation that we can be excited here tonight we got a power that's within us we got authority to take the devil back hey man Church Paul took it back with the word and brought it up to the day and he said it was God in the pillar fire God took it back to the pillar fire third pole him in the pillar fire coming down in the room hey if the prophet of God was here today we'd still be pulling on his coattail we don't need him be here it was God's voice and the voice is still here but notice in the vision he was up here and the pillar fire had come down into the room and the people were going in sick and coming out healed delivered what happening I don't know but we know the pillar fire was in the room Oh Church we got a revelation here tonight we can get in the room with the pillar fire he said what does this mean he says have you not heard of the Pharisees in them that pray in the streets to make a public show he said but didn't I tell you I'd meet you behind in the secret room to close the door behind you he said I'll meet you in that secret room oh brother here's the secret room the pillar fire is here Amen to take take us back to the beginning and show us that we can have an experience with God that a minute just anybody that get fired up with the revelation this stimulated you can have that same experience in your home in your living room but the pillar of fire I don't care what the devil's report is you can take that pillar of fire experience with you amen and speak the word and come out that out of that room and say I know God is a healer I know it was God that done this how many times have you been healed tonight I mean in your life God has done supernatural things for him amen the doctor didn't have nothing to do with it you didn't even go to the doctor's office brothers and sisters are being caught up in the spirit of God I had back trouble was kept on having it I was up on the front pew one time the Spirit of God moved it took me in the air took me over in the corner and they said my feet went straight up in the air and I come right down on my tailbone and come back on my feet God did surgery on me nobody Amen seen the surgery just the effects I tell you it was the pillar of fire it was the Word of God doing something to me that the doctors could not do amen we're getting in a time we can't run into the doctor's office all the time we ain't got the money we don't need to a minute spotter spoke the word he told Moses speak to the rock not thrash it not beat it Oh church you don't have to just keep on begging God why cry just speak the Word of God speak to those children speak to that problem Sarah hi hey man you love him hey man I just appreciate how many would just like to say Lord give me that pillar of fire experience one-on-one it's time for us to have that experience church amen no longer delay amen I've heard a voice summons and us up John heard a voice says come up we've been summons to get out of here it's time to come up right amen it's time to go Amen hallelujah God is wanting us there on his throne with us hallelujah amen possessors they're right I want to be a possessor of the Word of God amen I just got us a little story here that I'd like to read you before we close bless you bless my heart pray that it will you there was a group of women studying the book of malachi and the Old Testament as they were studying chapter 3 they come across the verse which says he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver the verse puzzled the women and they wondered what this statement meant about the character and the nature of God and so one of the women offered to find out about the process of refining silvering get back to the group this week this woman was called up to a silversmith and made an appointment to watch him at work she didn't mention anything about the reason for her interest beyond her curiosity about the process of refining silver she watched the silversmith he held a piece of silver over the fire and let it heat up he explained that the refining silver one needed to hold the silver in the middle of the fire where the flames were hottest as to burn away all the impurities and the woman thought about God holding us in such a hot spot then she thought again about the verse that he sits as a refiner and purifier of the silver she asked the silversmith if it was true that he had to sit there in the front of the fire the whole time the silver was being refined and the man answered yes and explained that he not only had to sit there holding the silver but he had to keep his eyes on the silver the entire time it was in the fire if the silver was left even a moment too long in the flames it would be damaged the woman was silent for a moment this yester silversmith how do you know when the silver is fully refined he smiled at her and answered oh that's easy when I see my image in it Lord are you in the fire you feel like you're right in the middle of it why sure we are we're right in the middle of the fire in Laodicea glory to God but I want to take God is in the middle of a fire with us he's watching every second and he cannot turn his head from us is that right because too long in the fire were to overdo it and we can't be in the fire not just long just - not long enough we got to be in the fire just long enough it meant that the Lord will say well done oh I tell you church amen we're not going to get there till it's well done I say Lord keep me in the fire till I can hear those words well done hallelujah praise the Lord he said when we get over there we'll walk in and we'll hear the sweetest words he ever said well done my good and faithful servant huh we won't be right and we won't be medium will be well done that right we're going to a marriage supper and that's why we're drinking is really good he saved the best for last I'm enthused about it how about you I'm excited about it let it remain in you we're not going back to the Garden of Eden we're going something better than that can I explain it to you in the best way that I can in the Garden of Eden there was Lucifer walking around seeking who he could deceive and he found a vessel that he could use to deceive their eye and then he found Adams little wife huh there was going to be a marriage in that garden Eden but he got to that little wife before Adam got to her that's terrible isn't it you know the devil's trying to do the same thing with us huh he's trying to get us before God gets us huh but anything gonna happen it's not gonna happen not this time is that right amen because it's predestinated for it not to happen is that right amen so in the garden Eden amen it was beautiful it was nice but the devil was walking around and he found somebody but what's better than that when we get into the Millennium the Bible says then the Satan will be bound a thousand years we'll have that garden eden back as perfection but the thing about it is it's going to be better because Satan is bound a thousand years now if you'll tell me how long the Millennium is going to be a man it's gonna be a thousand years so there's not one day that the devil ain't gonna be bound he's bound from the beginning of it to the end of it now that's better than the garden Eden he saved the best for last I don't have to worry about the devil walking around he's bound how's he been he has no one to work through he has no seed to come through he sealed the whole church I like that don't ya praise the Lord it's goin home time me man the marriage it's come and the wife is making herself ready and she's crying come quickly Lord Jesus even so come let's all stand you love him
