[0:00] the anointing is a person it's the only
[0:04] person of the godhead well I thought
[0:07] that was Jesus it
[0:10] is the anointing is a person it's not a
[0:15] feeling when you have had fellowship
[0:18] with the person you're going to feel
[0:21] something this quickening power this
[0:25] unction from the Holy One will Quicken
[0:28] your mortal body in time of Resurrection
[0:31] it will Quicken your mortal body when
[0:33] you sit under the revealed word it will
[0:37] Quicken your mortal body when you come
[0:39] to praise and worship him and create an
[0:42] atmosphere for Jesus Christ to come and
[0:45] prove himself to be the same today
[0:48] yesterday today and
[0:51] forever so it's not just some smoke the
[0:55] anointing is not just a cloud it's not
[0:59] just Haze in the room the anointing is a
[1:03] person and you have received of the Holy
[1:06] Spirit the anointing of the Messiah the
[1:10] anointing of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:13] therefore you are an offspring of
[1:17] almighty God you are right now right now
[1:21] though not fully expressed though not
[1:24] fully manifested you right now are an
[1:29] offspring
[1:30] of God right now right now say right now
[1:36] I am a manifested Son of God somebody
[1:41] say well what if there's no
[1:42] manifestation in my life are you
[1:45] here are you here are you living in 2024
[1:49] then you've been
[1:52] manifested every time we wear our
[1:54] feelings on Our Sleeve someone pokes
[1:57] it then it just fluffs up
[2:00] the mind and the will and the emotions
[2:03] and and and it convinces us that that we
[2:06] were
[2:07] right and we carry because of that an
[2:10] orphan
[2:13] Spirit you're no longer an
[2:16] orphan you are an
[2:18] offspring of God I'm counting on some of
[2:23] you who struggle with who you are to say
[2:26] Amen
[2:31] we are
[2:33] offspring of God we are dwelling with
[2:37] Christ as corporate messiah in the earth
[2:42] and we're feeding that part of us on the
[2:45] revealed word of the hour and when the
[2:47] spirit of man that regenerated spirit
[2:50] it's now not man's life but the life of
[2:53] God when it begins to
[2:56] swell it starts talking not only to your
[2:59] soul your mind mind will and your
[3:00] emotion it starts commanding the
[3:06] flesh oh that is the control
[3:09] tower that's where control is supposed
[3:12] to come from the regenerated Spirit man
[3:17] then it tells your mind you
[3:19] behave it tells your will submit to God
[3:23] it tells your emotions calm
[3:26] [Music]
[3:27] down stop looking for some somebody to
[3:30] agree with you and
[3:35] repent kill that
[3:37] thing you've got another seed living in
[3:40] you kill
[3:42] it dig it up by the
[3:45] root if jealousy is there dig it
[3:51] up nobody can be you but you and you're
[3:56] a fine you
[4:00] you're a valuable
[4:03] you you're an offspring of God yet there
[4:08] is not another one just like
[4:12] you you don't have to be like somebody
[4:17] else you don't have to worship like
[4:20] somebody else or preach like somebody
[4:22] else or play music like somebody else
[4:26] don't settle for being a copy of someone
[4:29] else because that's an
[4:31] imitation be
[4:33] original God doesn't make
[4:39] junk you carry the Sperma of God in you
[4:43] act like it live like
[4:47] it talk like it
