name of the lord and we're just very thankful that the lord is moving among us and we have found out you've noticed some of these that move toward the front and we found out through the years that sometimes you have to move out of your comfort zone and um it's it's it's kind of like when brother branham did a prophetic action when he threw the rock in the air and prophesied that alaska that something was going to happen on the west coast and he said alaska liked to have sunk so sometimes you just have to make a movement and the lord told us in his word if you'll draw nigh to me i'll draw nigh to you so sometimes we just move out of our comfort zone a little bit and let the lord do what he wants to do and and so if that offends you i'm sorry i don't think anybody's offended but you know sometimes sometimes we just have to push in a little harder and i'm grateful to the lord for loving me so much that he just let his grace come down over my life when i didn't deserve it when i was being stupid god let his grace come down over my life and oh what a blessing it is to have his grace in my life and i'm so happy to have so much of my family here this weekend we've got a house

all ye peoples shout unto god with a voice of triumph hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god you may be seated just a moment you stood so long for worship thank you so much for entering in and there was a wonderful atmosphere and one of these days i believe brother greeley is just right that atmosphere will never leave us we'll just step right off into that how many of you are looking forward to that don't let it get too cold for the visitors i i heard the air kick on and uh it's all right with me but i don't want anybody to freeze or to blame us for the sniffles next week either we are sure glad to have you here we had the great honor and privilege of wedging ourselves in we were invited but you still have that feeling but it didn't last long because if you know anything about this family you realize that they know how to make you feel like a part and they certainly did i was feeling sorry for myself i don't have but one uncle alive uh no aunts i have three first cousins and there was a lady here a few sundays ago who said that i have a third cousin still alive that i didn't know he even existed anymore i thought he'd been gone for 20 years or more and that's just about all the family extended family i have i was an only child my mother's siblings are gone and so uh it's just us and we're looking forward to extending and spreading and multiplying one day many years down the road but not too many years down the road because i want to be able to enjoy the grandchildren for at least an hour before we send them home right oh there's papa he's just had a big weekend with his but it was wonderful to be included and the the food all these folks are cooks but the fellowship and the sweetness of being with them and spending a day with them wasn't was something that we will never forget thank you all so much for letting us be a part of that and then they had a wonderful time yesterday brother wes greeley was in the back saying how wonderful it was it just touched my heart how wonderful it was to have all his family around him yesterday and it's a blessing and it's a real heritage from the lord isn't it today 24 years ago at the church in columbus my wife and i were married today is our 24th it don't seem it seems like a lot to us but it seems real small when you're talking about 63 years but i'm so thankful for the 24 years that god has given me with my wife and i am very thankful for her it's him [Music] i haven't kept her the lord has kept her he's kept her here for me when we first got married i told some of them the other day leaving on friday i told them that it used to be i didn't want to be out of her sight i didn't want her to leave the house without me because i was afraid she wouldn't come back that's how insecure i was but i'm so thankful that at least for these last 24 years she's always come back and i'm hoping and believing that she will until the end so i want her to know how much i love her today you've been up and down a lot but i'm going to ask you to stand again for the reading of the word and i'm going to ask you to sing this little chorus with me not that we need another song but i just want us to pull our minds back together here so that god can speak to us i will be mindful to the best of my ability of the fact that we only have two services a week and they tend to be longer services and i'll do what i can as a human to move as fast as i can but i don't want to miss an opportunity today we don't know when we'll have this opportunity again if sister greene was here she just turned 87 and like i liked the quarter she said we may never be gathered like this again if we get together and she was on the phone with my wife yesterday and she's looking forward to harmony in the desert in january at 87. she's got her songs practiced and she's ready to sing and every time when we were out there she would say somebody will be missing next year it'll never be just like it is somebody won't be able to come or somebody will be in heaven so you've got to make the most of the moment and i agree with that to a certain extent let's make the most of this moment this morning god's been good to us hasn't he he's been so good i want us to sing um [Laughter] i know it but i just don't know what to call it uh so it's miracles can i give you a hint yes so many miracles you've done so many miracles you've done so many miracles you've done you've done for me so many miracles [Music] sing it out with you so many men [Music] [Music] you've done you've done for me has god work miracles in your life he did when he saved you so many miracles [Music] you believe he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still a miracle working hard so many miracles you've done you've done for me [Music] you've done so many miracles you've done so many miracles you've done you've done for me is there anyone who could use a miracle in your life you just hold up your hand so many miracles lord if you've done it before you can do it again we're a needy people here today we can't really help ourselves at times we believe you're still a miracle working god you still heal the sick and save the lost and raise the dead so we ask you lord as we approach your word let your word come and minister to every need that we have let somebody's faith be anointed to reach up and take a hold of a miracle that they need in their life because our hope is in you and our trust is in you so many miracles you've done you've done for me yes lord yes lord yes lord i want to thank you musicians and those of you who've helped us in worship god bless every one of you today thank you so much thank you to you in the sound booth all that you do for the streamers we appreciate it so much let's turn in our bibles to second corinthians chapter 10 and we just welcome every one of you who are here this morning and we greet all of you who are streaming the service it's difficult for me to stand here and scroll and then every time when we get home and we look back we say all we missed here was someone letting us know they were watching and we didn't mention it but i just happen to see one here that's a great blessing to see that brother cliff halls is laying in a hospital bed today in the united kingdom he has really been sick he has been on a ventilator uh or or a lot of the forced oxygen i'm not sure exactly i don't remember exactly how serious it got with the oxygen but he said i've got my hand raised he needs a miracle today isn't it wonderful that we're able to reach over to where he is in the united kingdom and be a little of encouragement to him brother cliff we have prayed for you this week and so many are streaming trinidad several places in india ghana and iceland and sisters and brothers in indiana and in british columbia in edmonton alberta and it just goes on and on and on uh ireland and so many tucson that's almost a foreign country isn't it and so many others and we just want to say thank you for being a part of our service today second corinthians chapter 10 verse 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of what strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity [Music] every thought how many thoughts every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when you're obedience is fulfilled i know that we're king james version people i am and i'm not ashamed of that but if you'd permit me i want to read these verses one more time in the amplified and i want you to know that i've checked them very very carefully to the best of my ability i'm not a scholar but they read very accurate and amplified so keep in mind what we're looking at as we read verse 3 for though we walk or live in the flesh we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons for the weapons of our warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood but they are mighty before god for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds now that ought to excite somebody because you know what it means to need something overthrown in your life pulled down and destroyed in your life inasmuch as we refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of god and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of christ the messiah the anointed one i love the way the amplified brings that to us this morning bow your head with me father we thank you for your word it's life to us it's health to us it's strength to us it brings correction when we need correction it gives us strength and the wisdom of the lord to be able to deal with things in our life that will often exalt themselves against the truth and lord we need help in this great battle the greatest battle ever fought is being fought now and we are actively engaged in spiritual warfare and the battlefield is not in a lonely plot on the other side of the atlantic ocean but the battlefield resides within our brain within our mind the greatest battle ever fought is being fought right now it's not being fought in the church it's being fought in the minds of the bride of jesus christ every day lord we are attacked by thoughts that desire to take us out of your purpose and plan and so lord we ask for you to help us to remain vigilant steadfast in our desire to watch every thought to deal with every thought that we might see the glory of the lord pulling down every stronghold destroying every paradigm and every death structure that sets itself up in our minds to pull us out of the truth of god's word we need your help today lord because we are overcomers in this house we have the victory because you are the victor and we have the good news that the bride is going to win this battle of the mind because we are exchanging our thoughts we are exchanging our mind for the mind of christ and we can only do that by the help of the holy spirit so we ask that he would come right now and give us grace to approach this word and may it accomplish something in our life for the glory of god in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the church said amen you may be seated we started at camp meeting time how to overcome anything then we looked at this war that's raging a great warfare is going on there's one in the natural and there's one in the spiritual and whatever happens in the spiritual sets the order for what happens in the natural we like to talk about the natural typing the spiritual and this is true but in the bride of christ there's a reverse order as well and what is accomplished in the spirit can affect what goes on in the natural if you believe that say amen now brother greeley was brother wes greeley was talking i can't really say it that way i know it's your name but it's just you know i should say pastor greeley uh he was talking about these prophetic acts he was talking about the prophet throwing a rock up in the air and and if you'll study the message carefully and i know you have you will discover that brother branham talks about a vibration that is set up in obedience you see it wasn't just some thought that came to his head randomly but it was an inspired thought that came from the lord and his obedience brought about a vibration that not only shifted things in the heavens above but it also shifted things in the plates of the earth and it caused an earthquake that was already on god's mind to become a reality and his obedience are you trying to tell me brother shelly that you believe it brother branham would not have been obedient to the lord that earthquake would have not happened that's exactly what i'm telling you i believe god has placed himself in the hands of a man he did it in moses he did it a generation ago and whether you have eyes and ears to see and hear it or not he's placing his hands in men and women today a bride who will have the authority of christ in the last days to hear his voice brother branham said she will have thus saith the lord or she will keep still and we have been still long enough so we must discover what it takes to come to the place where we awaken to the reality that everything we need to make the rapture is in us it has been placed there by the word of god the seed of the word is accomplishing things inside of us that sometimes our minds struggle to talk us out of and that's why every time you give god praise for whatever he does in your life every time you recognize and identify that god is doing something for you even if it's not a complete miracle it's just the beginning of a miracle and you stop and say lord i want to thank you for the progress you know we used to make fun some seem like of the charismatic people because they were overly sensitive we we like to think and when they would be prayed for in pentecostals too when they would be prayed for sometimes the preachers would ask them do you feel better they did that in the healing revival sue you know do you feel better and some would say yes i feel better and they'd say well is the pain still there and they might say something like well i feel a little different it's not as severe as it was and a critic sitting somewhere in the church would say wow that's nothing let me tell you something what i have found is this if i will give god praise i'll show you where the prophet said in a moment if i will give god the praise that he deserves and give him honor that is due his name even when i just feel a little tingle different in my finger than i felt before it's not nearly as severe as it was and i want to give you praise lord i want to thank you that you're faithful and that you're watching out for me do you know what i've seen god do i've seen that cause a snowball effect and as that snowball would get bigger and bigger the victory would become more and more of a reality the miracle would unfold and would develop its i could tell miracles and you could tell miracles and you could share what you've seen god do but i guess my point this morning is watch for god you're his bride but you've got to watch for him because there is a group of people on the face of the earth who stand over a blade of grass and say i don't believe in god brother branham said they just look around them and see god in his creation if they would just see what god has created and recognize that his fingerprint is on every blade of grass when you stand and look at lofty mountain grandeur that we sung about a believer sees that and we don't just say oh that's beautiful we say that is the handiwork of my god he loved me so much he put that there for our enjoyment and if you think you've seen something over here just wait if you think god showed out in the rocky mountains and he showed out here and showed out there just wait until you step into eternity there's so much more waiting on us than we have ever touched over here if you believe that same man you'll have to forgive me i'm double dry this morning now we started talking about spiritual warfare this is not finding a demon under every rock this is trying to recognize that there is a legitimate warfare going on and satan is talking oh he's talking he's talking nonstop and he has a host of imps that are talking nonstop and they're shooting their eras i believe brother branham said darts they're shooting their arrows they're shooting their darts and their their desire is to hit the target and the target is to so affect your mind with reasonings and doubts if they can only cause you and i to doubt the goodness of our god if they can only send some article our way that would cause us to doubt the absolute truth that god has delivered to us in this message if they will be able the enemy will twist some detail or make something a little larger than it should be and it gets down in your mind and you begin to be overwhelmed with doubts i want you to know the demons dance with glee as long as you're in a tail spin they rejoice because they recognize if they can keep you and i in confusion you see our bodies have been delivered from babylon we have come out of denominational confusion come on but some of us are still in a great battle because there's a lot of babylon that's operating in our mind we know god's word but we hear all the other voices that try to talk us out of the reality of what god wants to do in us we have faith for somebody else we believe that god will move for somebody else but we're not sure if god really wants to move for us or in us i want to tell you i've got good news for you i woke up this morning knowing that god wants you and i walking in the victory he wants you and i walking in the victory that he has made available to us this message was not sent from god to make us a bunch of mummies you thought i said dummies didn't you i said mummies and sometimes mummies can act like dummies the enemy wants to tie us up and tangle us up and twist us up in confusion and if he doesn't do that he will do it with church entity i was thinking his brother greeley was talking about brother branham throwing the rock i thought well a lot of us came from pentecost and we sung a song back then that says you got to move you got to move you got to move you got to move when the lord gets ready you better move come on and you say well is that is that good for us today it absolutely is good if god tells you to worship him in some way that you're not used to doing you better obey god you better step out of the boat you better be willing to get out of your comfort zone because if god is talking to you by his spirit it's always because he's setting you up for something great he's setting you up for the answer to your prayer he's setting you up for the fruition of the miracle that you've been waiting on come on now and so we we've been talking about the spiritual warfare and how it's outlined for us in the bible and there's four steps to it i'm not going to preach that again just going to name them because we've just read them to you in the scripture number one to pull down every stronghold god does not want you and i bound to strongholds he doesn't want death structures i'll define that later hanging around in our mind he wants us to receive only the pure word of god and everything else watch this everything else is a lie it's a lie we are surrounded by lies and we have perceived them to be reality but there's only one reality over here in satan's eden and that is the pure word of almighty god and that is found when we take the mind of christ and to take the mind of christ we have to actively reject our own mind how do we do that by taking every thought captive is that according to the word no is this this according no the enemy will tell you all kinds of things number one to pull down strongholds number two to cast down imaginations number three to cast down every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of christ number four to bring every thought into captivity and forcing it to obey christ did you know you've got power over your own thoughts help me now if you folks will help me preach i'll wear myself out for you come on you've got to get a hold of that thought i have to get a hold of that thought and examine it and i can't do it long drawn out come on this is you don't have time to call a prayer meeting on every thought you got to know the word so that when you examine that thought you can immediately know if it's according to the word or not is that thus saith the lord or is that the say of doubt and if it's thus saith doubt you've got to grab ahold of that and force that thought to submit itself to jesus christ and his truth and then you have to replace that thought with the only thing that's going to give the bride victory and that's the word of god the only thing god always didn't he say god always uses what his word to defeat his enemy and how does he interpret his word for us by bringing it to pass these are little i don't know slogans cliches pieces of quotes that we hold onto we repeat them we amend them when we hear them not realizing that they have become weapons that we can use against the enemy you take that little quote and i have it here you take that little quote where brother branham said the right mental attitude i want you to know that's an atomic bomb don't you call that a bullet that's more than a bullet that's an atomic bomb the right mental attitude toward every promise of god or any promise of god will do what bring it to pass so it's a very busy life we're living now and this head gets really full amen and one of the things that we find out are you will you stay with me a little while one of the things we find out is we receive these thoughts and we hold on to them and when we hold on to them they not only become a part of our conscious mind they also become a part of our subconscious mind and when we have a thought true or false that has become a part of our conscious mind and also our subconscious mind any similar thought is automatically received into the brain now just a minute i know it sounds a lot any similar thought because your subconscious brain does not have the ability to filter out error or truth it receives all information it's like a computer your subconscious is like a computer and everything you put in it it takes it to be the truth you have to make a conscious decision using your conscious brain i'm not a brain scientist but i sure have studied a lot about the brain i think it's one of the most fascinating tools that god has given us it's for us it's for us it's a gift from god for us and you people who say i don't have a good brain i want you to know that's a lie i want you to know the holy spirit in you can rework and reach change and rebuild and restructure anything that's damaged even in your physical body particularly your physical brain by the miracle of epigenetics it's a gift from god to be able to even reprogram your brain and the scripture tells us we do that by pulling down thoughts that are contrary to god's word and replacing them like jesus did it is written how many of you know to do this how many of you are always successful at doing this i'm saying oh my the number shrunk because we forget we know it but we forget it and this is the enemy's uh uh it's his success now once you accept a thought that thought is placed in your subconscious mind whatever thoughts you choose to accept in your conscious mind must be accepted also in your subconscious mind it has no ability to reject any thoughts we continuously think are planted firmly in the subconscious part of the mind i don't want you to be bored this repetition of thought becomes habits or what we refer to as paradigms now paradigms are thought structures and they are like a building they've got all kinds of bricks all kinds of pieces and they form a structure in our thinking ability and many of us here are bound today by wrong paradigms and paradigms are scripturally defined as strongholds and jesus is giving us power over every stronghold that the enemy would try to build on the battlefield of our mind are you still with me but they don't fall on their own they don't just fall automatically because you go to church often you have got to make a conscious decision i'm going to deal with what the enemy is building in my head anybody with me my old granny used to say and yours did too you can't keep a bird from flying over your head but you can keep him from building a nest in your hair well i want to tell you something you can't always control a thought from coming to your mind but you don't have to let the enemy use that as another brick to build a stronghold or a paradigm that will continuously pull you out of god's program for your life i want to tell you this i don't know if you're hearing me or not but i want to tell you this god's got a bride in the earth he's not going to have a bride he has a bride and in that bride there's going to be victory somebody in this house is going to win this mind battle over satan and i'm going to be one of them you just might as well make up your mind that you're going to be one of them i'm going to win this thing you're not going to win it by by win it by getting smarter you're going to win it by being more spiritually minded taking the mind of christ now let me read just a few more little notes and i want to go on to what the message tells us the the thoughts we choose with our conscious mind are impressed upon our subconscious mind and it moves our body into a state of vibration which creates an action and the actions that are produced create the results that you are getting in your life now folks that's that is actually brain science that's not uh mind over matter new age uh mumble jumbo that is not just norman vincent peale and dr schuller at schuler and no no no no this is actually brain science you are not forced to live with the brain you were born with interesting you have the ability and especially those who have the word of god the greatest weapon you've got the greatest doctor you've got the greatest brain surgeon that has ever existed you have the ability to rewire your thoughts so that every time a lie comes you recognize it immediately you pull it down in the name of the lord jesus christ and you build the thought that's true to replace the lie that you just pulled down now i know some of you are looking i don't know what this when i first started teaching these things people would say things like well what has that got to do with brother adam well i want you to know that in my opinion brother branham was a brain scientist he was a brain scientist because you don't have to have an education to rewire your brain he taught more about the mind and thoughts and the power of our brain and our ability to be what god says in spite of all the obstacles come on now he preached about overcoming night after night after night and the instructions were always the same he said you've got to use what jesus used it is written it defeats every enemy every devil come on now so everything you see hear smell touch and taste is either accepted or rejected by the conscious mind whatever is accepted is then turned over to the subconscious mind which is then turned into action through the physical body so every action including brushing your teeth and fluffing your pillow and all the things you do without thinking about it you just do it how many of you know our life is filled with thoughts that come from the subconscious oh my goodness you don't have to learn to drive every time you get behind the wheel do you you know they say you'll never forget how to ride a bicycle there are certain things that get programmed into us that we don't even have to think about to do them is that right anybody understand have you ever look you're going to get older i see some of you young whippersnappers you're going to get older and you're going to do thinking you can just do like you always did and just grab the first thing you find and put under your arms don't you do it everything on the counter is not mouthwash everything that's pasty is not toothpaste everything in a tube is not toothpaste and where we used to just put things in the right place and know where they were in our subconscious mind we just start getting things we don't even read the label we just grab things by what we know well as the older we get some of those connections those synapses they kind of get frazzled and you got to be mighty careful i'm not even going to suggest what you might be brushing your teeth with but it will happen but very much of our life is lived from the subconscious mind and the only way you can have something in the subconscious mind is if it's been accepted in the conscious mind because you live subconsciously carrying out actions that you have received and learned in your conscious mind you don't have to think about brushing your teeth who's got a better example anybody got a better example of things that you do all the time and every day and oh you're giving us an example of of the of the synapsis breaking i'm looking is there a better example of what we do automatic that we don't have to think about well you don't have to think about how to how to it's obvious for me not for some of you that i don't have to remember learn and retrain myself to eat but how many of you know stroke victims do because there are certain parts of the brain that have been affected and things they've done normally and automatically all their life they can no longer do now if everything has to be written on the hard drive of your conscious mind before you can use it subconsciously and that includes how to eat how to brush your teeth how to how to to drive the car or whatever the example would be did you also know that you can program your conscious mind to know how to recognize anything contrary to the truth of god's word and if you can learn that in your conscious mind you send that into your subconscious mind and i want you to understand we're talking about real brain cells here we're not talking about some mystical mist we're talking about the ability to ride in the hard drive of the mind now you add what god has created this brain to be able to do on its own you add to that what the holy ghost can accomplish in your mind and i'm telling you you are no longer an average part of adam's race you now have become a part of god's super race come on what god has given you and i the ability to do by the power of the word of god that resides in us it causes us to graduate out of adam's race into an entirely different creation all together now i know many people struggle with that but it's the truth we're not just a part of adam's race or a part of abraham's natural seed but by the word of god that's in us we are a part of abraham's royal seed and everything we need to win this battle is in us and everything we need to make the rapture is in us so we're not waiting on something new we're not waiting on another experience if you think i'm going to preach against experience i'm not because there's enough message preachers who do and i don't have to join the ranks because i personally believe that you must have a personal experience with god god has no grandchildren nicodemus you must be born again you've got to have your own taste of that original manna hallelujah you don't just have the holy ghost because you talk some talk or you wear the right belt buckle or you do something like other people do let me tell you something you've got to have a birth you've got to be filled will you tell your young people will you tell your children so they can tell their children you must have the baptism of the holy ghost for yourself my experience is not enough for my children brother branham's experience was not enough for his children you've got to encounter god for yourself it won't all look the same way i'm not talking about jerking or jumping or moving i'm not talking about some something like that a goosebump i'm talking about something so much deeper than a feeling but when you receive it you can't help but feel it because it's transforming you from the inside out and it's giving you the power i want to say it again it's giving you the power to win the greatest battle ever fought this little bride that has lingered in defeat way too long is about to awaken she's about to recognize who she is why because the time is right the time is right look at israel look at the nations of the world look at where we are in this nation you will recognize the time is right it is manifesting time it's time to deal with sickness let's see if i get any help with that it's time to take sickness by the horn and recognize that a great portion of what we suffer is demonic [Music] should i pull out my list i think i will i'm not getting far enough i got to hurry of course if i was just going to take my normal time i got another hour and 20 minutes but i'm trying to hurry let me give you this list again because many of you didn't hear it i made a list of some of the maladies and infirmities that brother branham placed in the three realms of the demonic first of all he said there are demons that operate in the spirit realm how many of you know that and here's some of them nervousness depression arrogance sullen ungodly spirits in case you don't know what sullen means i wanted to look it up to make sure it means bad tempered sulky pouty gloomy any of you ever dealt with that it's demonic boy that don't make us feel good it's demonic and you know there's only one way to defeat the demonic that's by the word of god you don't have to be grumpy your whole life tell me lord help me to be i don't want to be that way how many of you catch yourself being grumpy how many of you past 40 and you still catch yourself pouting come on now the enemy wants to confuse our minds with all of these emotions and we think that we can just ignore them and they go away but the truth is if the demonic is driving those kinds of things then we have to take authority over the demonic and we have to use what tools and what weapons we have been given and we have to defeat those strongholds and pull down those paradigms oh just a minute preach on brother we may be tired but we need to hear this oh thank good i'm glad insanity worldly spirits spirits of darkness drinking smoking bad habits all of these things brother branham said operate from the demonic in the realm of the spirit in the spirit realm you see i see this thing so many times now when we first heard the truth when the message first came pulled us out of denominational thought and thinking we were so glad to be free from what the church was caught up in yes we were we were so glad don't don't get nervous oh my some of my own folk got nervous some of our own church vote got nervous because you thought you knew where i was going i'm going to behave myself but i am very disturbed about the fact that the longer we've been out of babylon the more likely it is it seems these days that we go back and start picking up the things that we once knew god had delivered us from isn't this a wonderful time of year to preach about that because we used to testify bless god he's delivered me from all that fluff he's delivered me from all that stuff that distracts from who christ really is and now all these years later you see if the rapture would have took place in the 90s some of us would have had more victory then than we have now come on now if the rapture would have took place 10 years ago some of us would have been walking in more victory the problem is there cannot be a rapture without you if you're a part of god's predestinated plan and a seed of god there can't be a rapture until you're ready to make it so let's get ready in that good advice let's let you and i do everything we can to get us far away from babylon external and internal that we possibly can so that god can use us because this little bride's going to be used on her way out of here she's going to shift some things on her way out of here oh yes she's going to recognize authority that she has by the power of the spoken word i still hear people talking 40 years later we're waiting on the spoken word why are we waiting on something that was already restored when god gave that prophet those five examples of the spoken word he was showing us that everything we need to operate in that is in us we're waiting on the timing of the lord we're waiting on the hour of the lord but we're also waiting to recognize who we really are because remember he said when that little bride when she really begins to know who she is she's going to win this battle this battle that wears you out now how many of you get wow i felt good how many of you get wore out with this battle tired of thinking these negative thoughts tired of warring against lies but we're not tired enough because if we get tired enough we'll do something about it and we have what we need you don't need another revival you don't need another prophet you don't need another this or another that we just need to recognize what god has already placed within us and start using and exercising and utilizing are you with me been in the physical realm brother branham named these of course there are many more these are the demonic that manifests itself in the physical realm tumor cancer pneumonia arthritis cataracts rheumatism tuberculosis epilepsy asthmatic conditions germ diseases ulcer deafness blindness etc i asked the church here last sunday how many of you noticed that several of these maladies involve the lungs [Music] what an hour we're living in now where the whole world is either fighting to get rid of it coming through it or hibernating to stay away from it lung problems and brother branham talks about the asthmatic he talks about the germ diseases he talks about the tuberculosis he talks about these things that deal with the lungs and he talks about it being the demonic manifesting in the physical realm i don't know are you are you upset with me if that's the truth if it's really demonic you and i have power over that just being honest jesus said somebody said what brother branham say more but let's just go right back to the main man jesus he said behold i give you power over all the powers of the enemy you'll be able to tread on serpents and scorpions and not be harmed and if you drink any deadly poison it'll not harm you now that's a promise that comes with obedience to the word and being filled with the power of the holy ghost and so we understand that this is just the beginning folks you need to know this is just the beginning of germ diseases and viral diseases we're just at the beginning and you don't even have to be prophetic to know that we've already got a new strain on the scene and a dozen more just waiting on the wings and you and i are going to need to exercise authority over those things in our own body and on our own family and in our own lives and you're you're looking at somebody and you look around this church and many of us have had the coronavirus but we are here to testify that it can do one thing to us that god didn't allow it to do and by his grace we came through with the victory and i want you to know some people didn't lose their praise some people came out of that battle with more praise than they went into it with because they saw the goodness of god got to hurry and then he said there's demons that manifest himself in the religious realm unclean spirits spirits of doubt superstition i was an evangelist i would preach on superstition because there's a lot of that there's a lot of that unbelief and sin all of these things are demonic manifesting themselves in the religious realm so if they're in the demonic if the demonic has something to do with it if the demonic is a driving force then if jesus has given us power over all the powers of the enemy that means we have authority over those diseases that means we have authority over those mind it means we have authority over being grumpy sullen pouty arrogant we don't have to excuse ourselves anymore and just say that's who i am and i'm not going to change there's power to change there's power to be new men and women oh there's power to live a victorious life in the word it's in us are you with me greatest battle ever fought sweet zoe paragraph 91 [Music] i'm hurrying that's in the new ones it'll give me a chance to get water can i have another one it's going to be a two a two bottle service it must be accepted in the mind now here goes the brain surgeon not even an elementary education and he's teaching us epigenetics he's teaching us how things work in the brain and how the mind is a part of all that function that the brain has and i'm reading again it must be accepted in the mind then it is believed with the heart put your finger there you can't believe anything in your heart that you haven't accepted in your conscious mind you can't act on anything that you haven't accepted in your conscious mind and allowed it to transfer to your subconscious mind but once what you believe is so inbred and so deeply driven down into who you are it will automatically flow into your subconscious and you will begin to know immediately when you hear something whether or not that is the truth how many of you know we need that we need that you don't always have access to the computer you can't always search the messages of brother branham how many of you know we need the mind of christ so that when we hear something on the news or when we hear something by the scientist or when we hear something in the world that we automatically can discern and know whether or not that is of the truth or whether that is of babylon we can recognize that and the only way to do that is to understand in order for it to be a part of our mind which is a functioning part of the brain it must be accepted in the mind then it is believed it has to then be believed with the heart then the word of god becomes a reality are you still here then every sense of every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the holy spirit then your sense of god your conscience of god everything that's godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere did you know you can't believe something in your heart until you've accepted it in your mind oh i want to say that again you can't believe something in your heart unless you've accepted it in your mind so you've got to make up your mind to accept god's word as your absolute truth then your heart's emotion can latch on to that and it becomes a part of your dna it becomes a part of who you are not only spiritually and emotionally but also physically if you think you understand that say amen all righty goes on there's not a doubt anywhere there's none can rise up there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well i remember miss jones tried to trust god and miss so and so miss doe tried to trust god for healing one time and she failed has the devil ever talked to you that way has the devil ever told you don't you remember so and so they threw themselves on the mercies of god and they died let me tell you something that is no sign that if you throw yourself on the mercy of god you're going to die too when you understand the sovereignty of god you will recognize that you're not leaving this world one half second earlier than what god has intended for you to leave and if you believe the devil can kill you then you have created an enemy that is more powerful than the god that created him the devil can't kill you he would have to have permission to take your life and he cannot take your life and one half second earlier than what god has intended and if god is calling you out of here the best doctor in the best hospital with the best medicine on planet earth cannot save your life so we better quit putting ourselves in the hands of men and women like that thinking that they're our salvation i don't mean not to go to the doctor i mean when you go understand he's a flawed man and he's only practicing the best he knows so don't put all your hope in the doctor and if you lose a loved one in the hospital don't you let the devil put you in this vicious cycle of a mind battle if they'd have been in a better hospital if they'd had a better doctor if they'd have been given another kind of medicine then they would still be here you must either believe or reject the sovereignty of god anybody with me to say that the enemy can come in and snatch me out of god's plan and kill my body is to say he's more powerful than the one who created him oh no i know that i know who the prince of the power of the area is i know who the god of this evil age is but i also know god doesn't ever come down off his throne i want you to know he's got the limits on that old devil he doesn't have free reign if you think the devil has total free reign you forgot who sits above him he dwells in the second heaven doing everything he can to bring destruction on planet earth but you forgot above him [Music] it's a god still on his throne watching over that little imp [Applause] i got my eye on you devil you can touch them this way and that way but you cannot kill them i won't let you all right boy that's good to know whoa that's good to know that's why i could go to greeley thanksgiving yester friday and not be afraid of catching something and dying glory that's why i can go to walmart i don't advise it but that's why i can go to walmart and not have to go in there with fear because i know that i know that i know that if he's calling me i better just say yes lord oh i'm not getting a lot of amens it's like the old preacher used to say everybody wants to go to heaven nobody wants to die oh preach on said paragraph 93 but if that channel has been cleaned out or cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory thank you sister for that amen because i think that's worthy of an amen because the the prophet of god is telling us here you've got authority by the power of the holy spirit that lives inside of you to control your memory well i want you to know i've always been brought up to think you couldn't deal with that memory you just have to give it to god and hope that here the prophet is saying the holy spirit has the ability to override your hard drive i'm going to believe that the holy ghost has the power to override your hard drive and keep down the memory that might come to cheat you out of your victory he said it right here that don't even come in memory no matter about miss jones and what she did and what happened to her you're just going to trust god because your faith has been anointed to do so that's pretty powerful isn't it paragraph 108 i don't want to bore you what you got then i love this one i'm telling you this is something else he said you've got a solar system hallelujah it's god set the stars in order and said hang there till i call you you're part of god's solar system he's hung you there you're going to hang there till he calls you he said they stay there nothing's going to move them how many of you believe those planets just hang right where god put them whoa and they're hanging there now see if he doesn't compare you to the same kind of thing when god can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with god behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world hallelujah can poke a doubt in there that's right he come around and say you don't feel any better well i love that i love brother branham's preaching away and he said they'll say i don't feel this and i don't feel that and he said what does feelings have to do with it feelings doesn't change the truth how you feel doesn't change whether you've received your healing or not what you see with your eye doesn't change the fact that god has healed you with his stripes we are healed we've got to live like healed people whether we feel like healed people or not we've got to live like victorious people whether we feel victory in our heart or not of course remember what brother branham said you just keep saying it till you believe it you know he didn't rebuke us for saying something that wasn't so because it is so he didn't tell us you can't say i'm healed if you're not because you are so he said you just keep saying it i am healed i am healed praise god for healing me praise god for healing me praise god for healing me whoa it changes thanksgiving dinner wow that silly woman who would have ever thought that she would have gone for black coffee with a stomach condition that had nearly destroyed her life but she got a little revelation whoa hallelujah i'm healed so why don't i just pour some of this black acid write down my belly and keep on giving god praise remember the story because the angel of the lord had passed that night through the neighborhood looking after those two words of god that had been spoken over those two women don't you give up i said don't you give up if god said it don't you give up you keep on believing him keep on praising him for healing for victory for deliverance until it comes well i get embarrassed to do that don't you let the devil embarrass you you take god at his word give him praise glory be to god my watch thinks i'm having a seizure now i'm free in more ways than one glory glory whoo let me go on now you don't feel any better your conscious is even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to god it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of god to work through the power of god see that's the main thing now paragraph 110 i want you to hold on to this there's your battleground i don't care how old you are i don't care how long you've been in this message i don't care how smart you are or how dumb you feel there's your battleground your battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather now brother branham is correcting himself but i'm not sure that a correction was necessary because he goes on to say your mind opens up and accepts the spirit so i'm not sure he's talking was talking about the human spirit i think he's talking about the spirit your mind opens up and accepts and i didn't mean to make you nervous by assuming what he said but we do have this glorious privilege of having the absolute word of god you know this this is precious folks this is precious because brother random being a human he stuttered sometime he would he would you know get get kind of hung up like we all do sometime i mean in in in making it plain and sometimes there's so many commas in a sentence that it's hard sometimes to take that phrase and go and see exactly which which which noun are we talking about or maybe it's talking about a verb and so aren't you glad that when we get hung like that we're not here to correct the prophet we don't have to do such a thing as that god will take care of that but aren't you glad we have a book aren't you glad we have an absolute you better help me or i'm gonna think you're one of them aren't you glad that we can take this message back to the word we don't have to worry about what he meant we don't have to worry about if there needed to be a little correction there or if we don't know how many uh how many uh didn't bow in elijah's day and all that instead of getting caught up with that we can go right back to this book and brother brandon said if it doesn't dovetail i thought you'd help me he said if that don't meet like the chinese laundry if you can't put that in there together with the word you better leave that alone it doesn't mean it in so it means you may not know where to place it so you just leave it isn't that good i believe brother branham was talking here he said your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit he said you can have little consciousness and little feelings and little sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it he said that's just little sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind your mind he didn't say your heart so don't tell me that he didn't understand the power of the mind and the thought the ability to think right the ability to be delivered from stinking thinking and begin to take the mind of christ and think like the word oh he understood it he understood it and he taught it he said that has nothing to do with it your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends god let none of them miss it that's how important brother branham thought this word was god let none of them miss it he goes on to say stay with me see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door you know that's what took some of us so long to get the right baptism that's what took some of us along to get the godhead and to receive the various parts of this message truth because our mind was acting on our behalf to reject something that seemed contrary to what we knew to be the truth aren't you glad the holy spirit can override the mind aren't you glad revelation overrides the mind aren't you glad that he can come and reveal to you truth and you're willing to throw everything you've ever held onto away because once you see it you can't unsee it aren't you glad you can't unsee it once you see it hallelujah somebody said did you hear he left the message he did what how is that possible how can you unsee what you've already seen maybe you had the pastor's revelation maybe you had church revelation maybe you didn't have a holy ghost revelation maybe the holy ghost never made it real to you if you're holding on to something that the holy ghost has never quickened to you i encourage you keep going to the word keep going in prayer until god makes it real because a revelation that's been revealed to you by the holy spirit becomes a part of who you are and the enemy can never move you off of who you are he can try to fool your mind but he can't move you from who you are hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i want to get to something before i give out i know you're already there amen here we go hurry hurry he said listen so it's your mind that opens up the door closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in what's it do i want you to see a shotgun i don't want you to see a water hose i want you to see a shotgun i want you to see god blowing the rest of that gunk right out of your mind right out of your thinking so that you can think his thoughts so that you can hold on to his word all right let's read on every doubt is gone i want that i want that you believe it's possible you believe it's possible to live here on planet earth and every doubt be gone i do i do i do how is that possible because when doubt comes you go to war it may fly over but you're not going to stand still and let it build a nest in your mind anybody got doubts anybody have a doubt [Music] most of my doubts are in me and am i ever going to get it right i'm not really doubting that god's going to get it right i'm more concerned about whether i'm going to get it right come on now but i can have victory over every doubt and when i do i'm going to talk like somebody that's dealt with doubt every doubt is gone every fear is gone i'm a human i know what fear feels like i want victory i want to live with all that bloat out of my mind just blow it out you know this whole theme was or have you lost your mind and here's the key have you lost your mind if you're still dabbling in doubt if you're still dabbling in fear then there's a part of your mind that still exists that has to be dealt with and the word is the only thing that can help you deal with that thank god we got the word he said there's every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against that now we know that's true yes sir we do we know that's true now look if you think the battle's new let me let me read you the next paragraph i know i've been reading a while here that's all right look at the next paragraph 112. these battles has raged since the day of the garden of eden the battle in the human mind satan started it what did he do when he met eve he didn't deny god's word he whitewashed it he stopped up some of those little channels here somewhere he said but surely god genesis 3 1 surely god all these things that he promised he knowed the word was right but he knowed he couldn't just come right out and blast that out blair like that but he sugar-coated it there's where the problem lies started in the garden of eden it operates today we hear it today we hear the scientists today we hear the news commentators today we hear most everybody around us today delicately politically correct trying to say things instead of just saying it like it ought to be said the enemy is always trying to introduce reasoning in there because reasoning will take us out of faith every single every single time all right now are you gonna stay with me another moment thank you you have a thought and along with that thought you have some kind of feeling an emotion is attached to every thought interesting an emotion is attached to every thought did you know that sometimes even a fragrance or a color can be attached to a thought what a brain we've got what a brain we've got just the smell of turkey in the in the oven let me suggest you don't put your turkey carcass in a crock pot with water and and and keep the crock pot on all night like my wife did to make the stock for the suit let me just suggest you don't do that or else i didn't know she had done it and i woke up at three o'clock in the morning i thought somebody was baking a turkey in our oven i could smell it all through the house because she had that stock on low and that the smell was permeating you just smell a turkey like that and you can you can see grandma you can remember grandma or or ambrosia did anybody have ambrosia at your thanksgiving table i didn't either place but i did growing up ambrosia fruit salad but coconut on top sprinkled on top now i know there's some folks that don't like coconut they're genetically impaired or something i don't know what it is and nice nuts on top and you get a bite of soft fruit and you get a little crunch a little coconut and i'm telling you that this good stuff mince meat pie i can smell i can think of my granny and smell mince meat pie or if i ever smelt mince meat pie i would think of my granny's kitchen and i could see thoughts are often accompanied by smells and even by colors even by pictures and memories will go along like that and even emotions you can hear something and experience the emotion that you felt when that memory was driven down that's why words are so powerful that's why words are so dangerous that's why we have to be very careful with the words that we speak not only the thoughts we think but the words that we speak because they bring people back to places they don't really want to go now you are not responsible if you don't know everyone's history and no one knows everybody's history so you really can't shame people for saying something when they don't know what they're stirring up in you and you've got to give them a little grace and not be quite so paranoid give them a little bit of grace because they may not understand what all is connected there and how many of you know you have the ability by the grace of god to reprogram some of those emotions pull them down because they exalt themselves against the truth of god's word he said you're an overcomer because i overcame you can overcome and if one word or one phrase or one smell or one thought can take you back to the place of despair then you're not an overcomer yet and so you've got to ask the lord lord i want to be free from that i don't want to be in a circumstance it reminds me of a circumstance that reminds me of a circumstance that reminds me of a circumstance and throws me into the into the despair of depression i want to be able to untangle some of that you got the word you've got the holy spirit to help you you've got the mind of christ so so he said you have a thought and this is a this is a neuroscientist you have a thought and along with the thought you have some kind of feeling or an emotion about it that thought gets planted into your subconscious along with that feeling which causes your body to feel a certain way resulting in a behavior that is in alignment with whatever you chose for your thoughts the key is think about what you're thinking about the key is your life is the expression of your thoughts if you don't like where your life is right now and where your victory level is then you'll have to change some of that by changing the way you think oh that sounds too no no no no he said it this lays right in the message of the hour you can't even believe something in your heart until you've accepted in your mind this is not out of the message this is the message if your prophet thought enough of you in the end time to tell you that your great battle is going to be one of the mind then he must have wanted us to understand that we can win the victory in our mind and yet a lot of folks aren't winning that battle in fact sometimes we get on top we get it this roller coaster we've got to have something besides a roller coaster we got to get up on the mountain and say no more doubts no more fear no more devil you're not doing this to me now you've got to think about what you're thinking about because there's something called ants and i've taught the church here about ants ants will ruin any picnic right ants are automatic negative thoughts you can't think an automatic negative thought that hasn't already been wired in an automatic negative thought is a thought that will pop into your head without you consciously pulling it up it just comes you've got to win victory over all the ants anybody with me i want victory over every ant that tries to spoil my picnic you want me to give you some examples when we are obsessively dwelling on an unpleasant event that happened in our life the enemy builds a stronghold around that event oh i want to say something but i don't want to dishonor my own mother you've just got to get over some of these things you gotta let it go while you have an opportunity to let it go it's affecting us in ways that we don't really realize sometimes it's like the old-timers used to say worry is like liquid acid on the brain i believe that i believe constantly worrying and wringing your hands and being fearful my poor mother got to a place in her life where she was so fearful of wind of thunder of lightning of a storm and it it became so obsessive and so bad that she had such a hard time getting the victory over it but when vascular dementia started taking effect of her mind it never bothered her again because that part of her brain that had been affected squashed the ant it squashed all the wiring that she had done she saw her mother terrified my mother never was terrified until the latter years of her life but she saw her mother terrified of a little storm i know we have some bad storms but it got so bad that it didn't have to be a bad storm to paralyze her my mother would lay in the floor and pull the couch over on top of her because of a thunderstorm with no no no warning no watch for a tornado but when that dementia began to set in because of the of the artery in her neck originally those kind of things never worried her anymore i find that so interesting and so fascinating that her brain and the damage that she had to her brain was already beginning to affect those thoughts and anybody who's lived with someone or know someone with alzheimer's they they all the memories all the things they all the things that were automatic and all the things they remember they just start losing those things now that is because the brain continues wants destruction once this falling away starts on this level it just continues but it also speaks to us about the ability that we have to start working on some of those things before they do damage because neuroscientists tell us that these automatic negative thoughts that we never deal with we got the word to deal with them but we never deal with them they start affecting us physically are you willing to look at that if we got time so obsessively dwelling on an unpleasant event seeing everything as black and white and no middle ground no room to try to figure out how we can sort this for the best always using words like always and never jumping to conclusions talking almost every excuse me taking almost everything personal always blaming others for your problems blaming yourself for things outside of your control it's not just about blaming other people we blame ourselves for things that we can we apologize for things that we had nothing to do with because we're blaming ourselves as though we had something to do with it brother sister it's an automatic negative thought it's more than that it's a stronghold of the mind and you don't have to live like that for the rest of your life there's victory for us the word can settle some of this those are being driven by shoulds and shootings and could'ves and would'ves and i wish i had ofs it will torment you there is no torment there's no fear brings torment there's no fear and there's no torment in perfect love how many of you know that let me give you an example from the message and i'll hurry everything uh this is a message everlasting life and how to receive it i'm nearly done not really i'm just saying that because i'm going to have to stop paragraph 51 you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do i just read to you something from a neuroscientist now i'm reading to you something for brother branham sounds to me like brother branham understood something about neuroscience he just brought it down real plain so that you and i who are not neuroscientists can understand it you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking they don't like me and the first thing watch this and the first thing you'll you'll you'll be shunning that person oh i'll get some amens are you afraid if you amen i'm going to preach another hour because if that's the case i'm going to try not to if i say the truth will you amend it you'll start shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you but you fixed it up in your head i've done this me and charity because i heard her amen anybody else i've done this so much so brother shane i'm gonna read it again you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking they don't like me and the first thing you'll be shunning that person because you think they hate you so you'll be pulling away and the next thing you know you'll be telling somebody they're shunning me they won't have nothing to do with me they hate me you see how the mind works when they haven't done nothing to you read on and after a while it becomes so a reality this is what happens in the brain it becomes so a reality to you till you actually believe that that person doesn't like you and you might bawl them out you may get your courage up and you you just may put a verbal whooping on them now i'm just sick and tired of you shunning me what i thought you were shunning me well you're not mad at me no i'm not mad at you you're not mad to me no i'm not now you know what if these things these paradigms these strongholds lasted five minutes we could all just put up with them and go on but how many of you know they don't just last five minutes they get down in our brain let me tell you something that disturbs me so much i can't stand to see families at odds with one another because i don't have a large family and i and i love to see families getting along and doing well and worshiping god together and serving god together and i don't want to see people get out of sorts of one another and families divide siblings divide grandmothers don't get to see their grandbabies because somebody said she don't like me and it got in their head and they started pulling away and then so you don't know how to act so you pull away and the bridge gets bigger the gap gets bigger no bridge gap gets bigger the chasm gets bigger and you might even get the courage about ball them out or say something to you they might they might get you back for instance your wife or your husband or some neighbor or something like that when the person is absolutely innocent of any ill thing it's because you just imagine it so listen i'm not shaming you if i were shaming you for feeling this way i'd be on myself i've gone through this many times in the ministry many many many many many times it's because that you just imagined it so but till it becomes a reality to you and now brother brandon asked this question now see what i mean do you see what he means do you see how these automatic negative thoughts they don't start off getting wired in but they get wired in because we think them and we think them and we think them don't you let anything separate you from your family don't you let anything separate you from your blood and don't let anything separate you from your blood your your jesus blood family your spiritual family you make up your mind you're going to do the very best you can negative thoughts and choices obviously affect our spiritual life but they also have a great impact on the physical body watch this 75 to 98 of illnesses today come through our thought life 75 to 98 the gap is so large because they don't agree i'd say the number is so large i can't ignore it your thoughts affect you that much your thoughts affect every cell are you too tired to listen your thoughts affect every cell of your body they have the power to affect every cell of your body there are three t's that cause uh disease in the body three t's thoughts make up 75 to 98 of current mental physical emotional and behavioral illness all stemming from the thought life and the other two are combined toxins and trauma and toxins and trauma make up between 2 and 25 of all dis-ease disease in the body mentally physically emotionally and behaviorally i want to tell you something that tells me right now that my thoughts are more important than my shampoo that was so good you can quote me your thoughts are more important than your shampoo i don't suggest that you wash your hair and motor oil but i don't suggest that you receive all the garbage and smut and lie and filth that the enemy wants to tell you in your head lie to you and about you come on i suggest we do something about it because jesus has given us his word hallelujah [Applause] there's one one more thing i wanna i'm gonna get to got to have to the subconscious mind doesn't understand jokes doesn't you might laugh as a courtesy but you won't find something funny if your conscious mind doesn't register that it's funny i got real problems here because i have a strange laugh reflex like the time my wife and i flew to virginia to a strange place and i was fixing to go into a service where i didn't know anybody in the room in the building and i was nervous we weren't long married and i didn't have an automatic closure on my tailgate [Music] and i didn't know my wife on our wedding anniversary forgive me honey i'm telling this i didn't know my wife still had her head it's a terrible way to say it that's how i felt i didn't know she still had her head under the tailgate she had gotten her bible and her sweater what else do you need so i mean i just grabbed it and i give it a real shove oh no listen to all the mamas and grannies oh no yeah it's terrible it's awful i should have been shot but i'm telling you i crowned her boom it was so loud i jumped i said i asked stupid things when i'm under pressure i said what was that she said my head i know i want you to know i just grabbed her up in my arms and i just caressed her and loved her and said oh darling please please please forgive me you believe that they know me too well around here i said what did you have your head still stuck under there for then i went into a fit of hysterical laughter so don't break a toe around me because when i get nervous i laugh i've laughed at funerals bad i don't mean just a snicker when i get nervous i can really really really laugh your subconscious mind doesn't understand when something is supposed to be funny unless you have a thought in your conscious mind that gives you a grid so i hear people laughing all the time about things that to me are not funny because i don't have a conscious grid that that's humor but then i laugh when people get hurt because i have a conscious grid when i don't know what else to do i'll just do like the vice president and i'll cackle because the subconscious mind doesn't understand jokes it believes what you say about you it doesn't know you're joking when you call yourself names it it takes up real estate in your subconscious mind if you continue to engage that kind of thought that thought gets written in your conscious mind and you start living out of the vibration i hope that don't sound too weird because it's life you start living out of the vibration of what you say your words over other people matter your words over yourself matter so i'm just encouraging you now to deal with what's going on in you right now because we work on our relationships by working on what's going on in us right now don't ever jokingly say i'm a loser i'm clumsy we didn't allow our children that were clumsy to call themselves clumsy they grew out of that place because we didn't want to validate that place don't call your children clumsy even if they act that way don't call them weird because there's no possible way that they're weird unless you are and if you are you shouldn't want them to be don't speak that over their life crazy stupid you can't do anything right those words matter and they matter when they when you speak them over someone else and they matter when you speak them over yourself and they matter when you think them over yourself you don't even have to speak them out loud i'm so clumsy i'm so stupid i cancel all of that in the blood of jesus christ you cannot say those kinds of things and expect your subconscious mind to know you're just being funny you're a child of god you're the purchased possession of the lord jesus christ his blood has been applied to your life he has invested his holy ghost in you you are a carrier of the divine life come on that's who you are you are not a failure you are not stupid you are not crazy you are not dumb you are none of those things and just because you're nervous don't say those things about yourself don't say them about anybody else don't thank them because it only intensifies i'm i'm i'm i'm winding down it only intensifies the battle that we're trying to minimalize how many of you believe we can minimalize this battle by taking god's word and using god's word i can give you tons of examples a whole page of examples that i'll never get to i'm such an idiot i can't believe i'm so stupid he or she's such an idiot i can't believe they're so stupid i can't uh i should be able to handle this but i can't handle this anymore this makes me so mad he makes me so mad she makes me so mad she is never here when i need her he is never here when i need him i can't believe this is happening to me my upbringing prevents me from loving or trusting people are you the old creature are you the new creature you can't be both did you know i mean i could preach all day but it wouldn't work because it'd be empty in here but the bible says a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways we got to make up our mind which mind we're going to use our reminder he is does that speak to anybody does that speak to anybody okay one more quote hallelujah but i gotta pick it carefully cause there's a bunch could i have two more thank you don't go nowhere hold on just a minute oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you thank you for your mercy um [Music] hear him 57. paragraph 12 the mind of christ is to be in the church and the mind of god was in christ so powerful once you understand that christ is the mystery of god revealed if you can understand that you can also understand that the bride is the mystery of christ revealed watch it get quiet brother braham said they're always trying to put it on somebody else why don't you recognize what god is doing in you if jesus christ is the mystery of god revealed there has to be a bride in the last days who reveal christ the mind of christ is to be in the church and the mind of god was in christ and how that the spirit led christ so ought his spirit lead the church you don't have time if you're being spirit-led to believe all these lies that the enemy has to say about you and speak them over your life or somebody else's speak the word i'm told by these who study these things these neuroscientists etc i'm told that the only way to rewire or to wire out the negative thoughts is to wire positive affirmations of god's word i am blessed i am a royal seed of abraham i am the bride of christ i am a son of god i am an overcomer because he said i am i'm filled with the holy ghost which is the zoe life of god come on you say oh that's bragging what is it when you say all that other junk i'll tell you what it is it's lying it's lying no liar liars cannot have a part come on now we got to get some repenting going on we've got to repent of some of the lies we think some of the lies we receive some of the lies we tell and we've got to speak the truth by moving in the opposite spirit i'm a child i'm a holy ghost field from the top of my head to the soles of my feet i'm called out of babylon hallelujah i'm a part of the third exodus my redemption lay beneath those seals and jesus came and loosed those seals and made a way for me to see my name in the lamb's book of life you're still with me i can no more be lost than god can be lost there will not be a rapture unless i'm in that rapture you see i used to have a little pentecostal brain come on musicians when i first heard those things i couldn't repeated that for nothing i couldn't have spoken that out of my mouth i could have never said there will not be a rapture unless i'm in it i could have never said that i could no more be lost than god can be lost my brain would have fraud i would have thought that's the most boastful thing until you hear brother branham say it somebody said what that what what difference did that make to you i saw that you could boldly declare powerful supernatural truths with no personal pride at all brother branham could say those things that it didn't sound like he was bragging on himself or his ministry he could talk about the seventh angel as though he was somewhere else in another country and you never sensed in listening to him that he was bragging on his own self or his own ministry he was always lifting up jesus come on now he taught us how not to be proud we have had an example of how power can operate in humility authority can operate in humility now god help us help us imitate that because that's what the bible said imitate their faith god help me to imitate the faith of william adam it's all right and all the other pioneers of the faith who kept the faith but lord i thank you particularly for the one who tied all these loose ends together for the one who'd never made it to junior high school but taught me so much about neuroscience hallelujah and how that spirit led christ so his spirit ought to lead the church and all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he part into the church oh hallelujah are you all right with that so the church has the power let's read on so the church has the power you better read it you better read it out loud so the church has the power that christ had christ had the power that god had so the two or three of you who turned up your nose while ago and curled your lip when i said that the bride is the mystery of christ revealed i just want to say mm-hmm he said it he said it there's nothing to get men out of shape about confess that over your life wonder what the cells of our body will do with that truth if we started speaking it over ourselves somebody said how do i know if it's true or not are you kidding me because the word of god said it so somebody said well i don't know where i stand you don't know where you stand of course you know where you stand you know exactly where you stand you know exactly if there's something you need to make right you know exactly if there's something you need to do to draw closer to jesus christ if you do if you know that if you sense that do it do it now do it quickly and then you start dealing with some of the ants that are trying to spoil your picnic you come back to the truth of god's word and let this mind of christ now this is this is really really really what else can i do to convince you it's 145. who is this the last one water oh my my my paragraph 18 what if abraham would have took what it looked like 25 years waiting for a promise that god gave him what if he took what it looked like why he'd have never had the baby they'd have he'd never been the father of little isaac but he believed god's word and wouldn't turn it loose how about you read the next sentence with me but he watered it day and night strong giving praise unto god i want you to water your truth i want you to water your promise strongly by giving praise to god each and every day even if you don't see the reality of the manifestation of that promise yet i want you to praise god for it anyhow like the prophet set the example tell him it's praise god for healing me praise god for healing me whether you can believe it or not say it until you do believe it he give us all this amazing advice he'd say oh when sarah would say honey it's been 25 years since a promise was made and here i'm nearly 100. listen to what his answer would be [Music] he'd say praise god how many of you know if mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy and here she was don't you think it's time to adjust our testimony don't you think it's time we we just change that a little bit not not talk not talk about it all the time to every neighbor everybody we meet on the street don't you think it's time we quit taking out an ad in the newspaper every week it's been 25 years it's been a long time and he'd say praise god we're gonna have it anyhow cause god said so you getting it you're gonna have a baby i said you will you carry it you carry the seed you carry the promise you water the promise with praise give god praise no matter what it looks like what it feels like what it sounds like what it smells like he said god said so that settles it that's right he know the nature of god stand with me he knowed the nature of god because he was a friend of god he knowed how to take him because he know that his promises no matter how foolish they look or how simple they looked or how unreasonable they look they were true because god said so so that settled it forever and i want you to notice that he said this that's the way every seed of abraham does today that's the way the born-again christian does today no matter what the world says what science says we could add in there what cnn says fox 2. they're so full of lies god's word stands above it all and they're looking at his word and what he said to be the truth it doesn't matter if they say today the world can't be burned up and the dead of them bodies can't rise again god said so and that's the truth that settles it forever god said so and we keep our eyes and we keep our eyes and we keep our eyes and we keep our eyes hallelujah and we keep our eyes somebody cast your eyes right now on what he said look up look up above what it looks like what it feels like look up and see what god's word has said take a moment or two of your day to deal with those ants to deal with those strongholds and paradigms snatch them down and replace them with the truth of god's word because we've got to win the greatest battle ever fought we will win because jesus has won for us jesus is the victor if you believe that same man i want you to stretch your hearts before him and and just symbolize that if you feel like you can by just raising your hands for just a moment and look to him i want you just to look to him benjamin will lead us in something for worship but while he's getting it ready just whenever you do start while he's getting it ready we're just going to look to the word right now lord we're looking to you we've got our eyes on the word we're taking our eyes off the lies and we're focusing them on god's word we're thanking you for power and authority over every automatic negative thought we thank you for the truth of epigenetics that by the power of the holy spirit we have the ability to rewire our own brain we actually have the power and the authority to shift the dna of our own physical body by subjecting it to the word of god and so every organ of my body that's out of line i place you right now under the true authority of god's word and i command in his authority that you obey the word of the lord and you function as god has created you to function somebody ought to claim that kind of a promise somebody ought to take something going on in your body that's hindering you and giving you trouble and you ought to put that right now in his authority under the word under the blood under the name of jesus and say i refuse to carry this any longer i'm placing this where god's word tells me to place it it's in your hands lord i am no longer that i am no longer that i am no longer that my identity is not found in my disease my identity is not found in what part of me is not functioning my identity is found in the deepest part of who i am where the seed of god lies today i'm taking you oh yes i'm a child of the king will you

to water with worship brother branham told us this after service is sometimes the most important part because we're taking what god has spoken over our lives and we are taking a hold of that in faith and making it our own we're claiming it we're identifying with this word i want somebody to leave here with more victory than how you came this morning and maybe you'll be doing that by watering that promise let's worship [Music] together oh yes [Music] i am [Music] he has made me [Music] in his life [Music] how loser [Music] [Music] oh praise god [Music] oh yes i'm a child [Music] it now flows
