[1:17] and if not then I would like to
[1:19] reinforce what you do know I'd like to
[1:22] help strengthen you in your foundation
[1:24] of faith I believe we're living in the
[1:27] end time and I believe we need the
[1:29] Fellowship of the brethren we need to be
[1:31] together with God's people as often as
[1:33] we possibly can but I recognize that
[1:36] some of you are separated you you don't
[1:38] have a place of fellowship and you need
[1:42] some encouragement and so that's what
[1:44] the Eagle's cry is about we want to give
[1:48] you a clear word a word that you can
[1:50] understand and we want to pray for you
[1:52] and so if you have not yet contacted our
[1:56] ministry please do so we would very much
[1:59] like to pray with you agree with you in
[2:04] prayer over all of your prayer requests
[2:06] and you can feel free to send them our
[2:08] contact information is given to you on
[2:10] the screen and uh write it down and and
[2:14] when you need to send in a prayer
[2:16] request please feel free to do so let's
[2:19] get into our study for this week this
[2:21] will be part three of a study that we
[2:24] have started okay
[2:27] we were in Exodus and we will begin in
[2:31] Exodus today as well in Exodus chapter
[2:34] 34.
[2:35] beginning uh in verse 33 and and 34 it
[2:41] talks about the veil that was over the
[2:43] face of Moses until Moses had done
[2:47] speaking with them he put a veil on his
[2:49] face but when Moses went in before the
[2:52] Lord to speak with him he took the veil
[2:55] off until he came out there was nothing
[2:58] between Moses and the Lord face to face
[3:01] and he came out and spake unto the
[3:04] children of Israel which he was
[3:06] commanded and so we talked about the
[3:09] veil we talked about the veil that is
[3:12] over the people of Israel even to this
[3:15] day when the Old Testament is read but
[3:17] we talked about the fact that there's
[3:19] coming a Great Awakening according to
[3:21] the scripture and God will reveal
[3:24] himself to his people so we're we're
[3:26] holding on to that promise and believing
[3:28] that it's going to happen and not only
[3:30] is it going to happen but we believe
[3:32] it's going to happen in our lifetime
[3:34] because we're living in the last days
[3:38] and so uh the the Bible also talks about
[3:41] veils in reference to flesh it talks
[3:45] about the veil of his flesh being rent
[3:49] uh speaking about the crucifixion of our
[3:52] Lord Jesus Christ and we also want to
[3:55] point out that sometimes our own flesh
[3:57] the desires of the flesh the will of the
[4:01] flesh can become a veil that separates
[4:04] us from our God and we want to come into
[4:07] a place where there is no separation we
[4:11] want to have that kind of communion that
[4:13] Adam had unhindered we sometimes refer
[4:17] to that as naked and not ashamed because
[4:20] Moses excuse me Adam and Eve were only
[4:23] covered by the glory the light of God
[4:26] they did not wear clothing to cover
[4:29] their nakedness but they were not
[4:30] ashamed because they were covered they
[4:33] didn't they didn't understand all of
[4:35] that understanding of of nakedness can
[4:37] came after they had sinned and so Moses
[4:41] walked with God not even thinking about
[4:43] the fact that that he needed to be
[4:45] covered up and of course we're talking
[4:47] about coming before God spiritually
[4:50] naked meaning we're not hiding anything
[4:53] from him he sees us already he already
[4:56] knows everything there is to know about
[4:59] us and so sometimes we come and in
[5:02] prayer even we pretend to be something
[5:04] that we're not and this is this is
[5:06] futile there's no reason to even even
[5:09] try to approach God that way just come
[5:12] as you are he loves you and he's drawing
[5:15] you in because he wants to have
[5:17] communion and fellowship with with him I
[5:21] was thinking about when I married my
[5:23] wife some 15 going on almost 16 years
[5:26] ago and I remember it like it was
[5:29] yesterday when she walked down the aisle
[5:31] the beautiful bride that she was and
[5:33] still is and but her face was veiled and
[5:37] she walked walked all the way down the
[5:39] aisle with a veil over her face until
[5:42] the vows were exchanged and when the
[5:44] vows were exchanged and we became one
[5:47] with one another in the sight of God and
[5:50] those who were there to witness that
[5:52] occasion then her veil was removed and I
[5:56] could see her face to face without
[5:58] anything and and when I when I kissed
[6:02] her there was nothing there was nothing
[6:04] between us and so God wants to remove
[6:07] the veils that are in our life so that
[6:10] we can come to him uh open and honest
[6:14] and with sincerity
[6:17] um and and let's not forget humble we
[6:20] need to approach God in humility because
[6:23] the Bible says he who humbleth himself
[6:27] under the mighty hand of God him will
[6:29] God exalt in due time so the way to to
[6:34] be lifted up the way to be elevated in
[6:37] the thing things of God is to is to Bow
[6:40] old to come before God in humility and
[6:43] and even in Contrition and just uh
[6:46] approach him in that manner and my God
[6:50] is nigh to them who are of a broken and
[6:52] a contrite heart he wants us to come
[6:55] before him sincerely now we think about
[6:59] Mo we think about Adam I keep saying
[7:02] Moses but we think about Adam in Genesis
[7:05] chapter 3 verses 8 through 10 and they
[7:08] heard the voice of the Lord Walking In
[7:12] The Garden in the cool of the day and
[7:15] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[7:17] the presence of the Lord God amongst the
[7:20] Trees of the garden see that that naked
[7:24] and unashamed sense that they had was
[7:27] gone now because of the sin that had
[7:30] taken place in the garden
[7:31] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[7:34] said unto him where art thou and he said
[7:37] I heard thy voice in the garden and I
[7:39] was afraid because I was naked and I hid
[7:43] myself I wonder how many times Adam had
[7:46] heard the voice of God and instead of
[7:49] being afraid ran to the voice ran to God
[7:52] to have fellowship with him in the cool
[7:54] of the day but brother Sister Sin
[7:57] changes everything when you begin to
[8:00] listen to the lies of the enemy instead
[8:03] of the truth that comes from the word of
[8:06] God from the mouth of God
[8:08] that changes everything and it breaks
[8:12] Fellowship now I want you to know it
[8:14] didn't change who Adam was Adam was
[8:17] still a Son of God it did not change the
[8:21] relationship between he and God God was
[8:24] still the father Adam was still his son
[8:26] his created son but it changed the
[8:29] fellowship it changed the community
[8:31] Union that they had once had and I want
[8:34] you to know that God had a people on his
[8:37] mind before the foundation of the world
[8:39] and what we do now as that people it can
[8:43] change our fellowship it can change our
[8:45] communion but it does not change who we
[8:48] are if God saw us in his great
[8:51] foreknowledge making that great big
[8:53] Eternal yes then it's going to happen if
[8:57] it happened hasn't happened already it
[8:59] will happen because God will continue to
[9:03] draw and woo us until we have that
[9:05] opportunity to make that great big yes
[9:08] and so when one Falls away it doesn't
[9:11] change who they are it just changes the
[9:15] fellowship that they have and we pray
[9:17] for them that God will restore them and
[9:20] bring them back and you know what he
[9:22] will it's the promise of his word all
[9:25] that the father hath given me will come
[9:27] the Lord Jesus said and the prophet of
[9:30] the Old Testament said that God has
[9:32] inscribed us our names are inscribed in
[9:36] his hand he couldn't forget us even if
[9:39] he wanted to somebody said well wasn't
[9:41] that a promise to the nation of Israel
[9:43] yes of course it certainly was in
[9:46] context but we have been grafted in Jew
[9:50] and non-jew alike grafted in to make up
[9:54] the one new man that the newer Covenant
[9:57] has revealed to us that God is making a
[10:00] one new man he is calling a people out
[10:02] from among the Gentiles for his name's
[10:06] sake and bringing us grafting Us in
[10:09] bringing us in to fellowship and right
[10:12] relationship with him now God came down
[10:14] in the garden that day to meet with Adam
[10:16] and God knew what had happened with the
[10:19] serpent he knew the sin that had taken
[10:22] place in the garden but I want you to
[10:24] know that God did not come down to harm
[10:27] Adam he came down to comfort and to help
[10:30] Adam to bring direction to Adam how many
[10:33] of you know that love is corrective
[10:37] sometimes people seem to think that love
[10:39] is passive and and that love knows no
[10:43] correction and that love is tolerance
[10:45] and but I want you to know when you love
[10:48] somebody you want to spare them the
[10:51] heartache uh in fact if you've learned
[10:54] anything in your life and you love
[10:55] somebody you want to teach them what
[10:57] you've learned so that they don't have
[10:59] to go through the same heartbreak and
[11:02] the same grief and the same loss that
[11:04] you've gone through and that's just the
[11:06] that's just the goodness of wanting to
[11:08] help other people around you now the
[11:11] Bible said in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21
[11:14] unto Adam also and to his wife did the
[11:17] Lord God make coats of skin and clothed
[11:21] them this is a beautiful
[11:23] uh beginning to something that we will
[11:28] come to understand later in scripture
[11:30] concerning the shedding of blood and
[11:33] what did what was required what had to
[11:36] take place in order for God to make
[11:39] clothes of skins to cover the nakedness
[11:43] of Adam and Eve uh well I think it's
[11:46] pretty obvious that animals had to die
[11:49] he couldn't remove coats of skin and the
[11:52] animal remain alive so God himself
[11:57] took these animals and took their lives
[12:00] killed these animals and ripped off
[12:04] their skins and made Adam and Eva
[12:07] covering for their nakedness and blood
[12:10] had to be shed and we see that in in
[12:14] Abel's sacrifice when he offered a lamb
[12:18] Cain brought turnips and potatoes and
[12:21] tomatoes and you can't get blood out of
[12:24] turnips it's only out of something that
[12:26] has life something that's living and has
[12:29] a heart beating and so we find that Abel
[12:33] took that little lamb that he loved so
[12:36] dearly and he slaughtered that lamb and
[12:39] in the process of slaughtering that lamb
[12:42] what happened to Abel he didn't have a
[12:44] sharp knife that we know of he must have
[12:46] picked up a jagged Rock and began to
[12:49] strike at the neck of that little lamb
[12:51] until the jugular vein was pierced and
[12:54] the blood began to spew and so what what
[12:57] happened was able became covered in the
[13:01] blood of the Lamb so we have the blood
[13:03] that was shed when God made the coats of
[13:05] skin for Adam and Eve now we have the
[13:07] blood that was shed when Abel offered
[13:09] the first offering to God covered by the
[13:13] blood and then in the Book of Leviticus
[13:15] we we see God giving us the instructions
[13:18] of how the people were to bring
[13:20] offerings and sacrifices to him and
[13:23] ultimately
[13:24] our Lord became the Passover Lamb the
[13:28] Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross shed
[13:31] his blood so right here in the Garden of
[13:34] Eden there is this concept introduced
[13:36] that the shedding of blood is required
[13:39] to provide the covering for sin so God
[13:44] didn't come down to harm Adam and Eve in
[13:46] fact he came down to clothe them he came
[13:50] down to make provision for their need
[13:53] now how is that possible it's possible
[13:57] because God knew what Adam and Eve were
[14:00] going to do he is omniscient he has all
[14:04] knowledge what took place in the Garden
[14:06] of Eden did not catch God by surprise
[14:09] and he did not come down to harm but he
[14:13] came down to clothe and to make
[14:15] provision that's the God we serve now
[14:18] did they pay a price for their sin
[14:21] absolutely and you will too if you
[14:24] continue in sin
[14:26] rejecting the sacrifice rejecting the
[14:30] way of Salvation that has been so
[14:32] clearly made for us you will pay a price
[14:36] for sin remember when Jonah decided that
[14:40] he didn't want to go the way of the Lord
[14:42] he wanted to go in the opposite
[14:43] direction
[14:44] and so when it came time to go in the
[14:47] opposite direction the Bible said he he
[14:50] went down and made arrangements for this
[14:52] ship and there's a few little words in
[14:54] there that always stick with me it says
[14:56] he paid his own fare
[14:58] you may go against what God is calling
[15:01] you to do but it's going to cost you
[15:03] something if you catch a boat in the
[15:05] other direction you see what I'm saying
[15:07] if you don't surrender to God when he
[15:10] calls you uh you may you may get by for
[15:13] a while you may be allowed to continue
[15:16] and sin for a season after God has
[15:18] called you but I tell you right now it's
[15:21] going to cost you you're going to pay a
[15:23] price and it may be a an ultimate price
[15:25] it costs Jonah a pretty a horrific
[15:29] experience didn't it it placed him in
[15:32] the belly of a great fish in the depths
[15:34] of the sea the belly of hell for three
[15:37] days and three nights and when he got
[15:39] out of that belly of hell he was ready
[15:42] to do the will of God he paid a price
[15:44] why don't you if God is calling you if
[15:48] God is drawing you why don't you just go
[15:50] ahead and surrender why don't you just
[15:52] go ahead and say yes to the Lord why
[15:55] don't you quit running so hard in the
[15:57] opposite direction he's going going to
[15:59] find you he you know he's God I think it
[16:03] was David where where can I hide whither
[16:06] shall I go uh to get away from thy
[16:09] presence there is no place even if I
[16:11] made my bed in hell you would come and
[16:14] if if I if I hid in the Heights there is
[16:17] no hiding place and if God is drawing
[16:20] you you should consider yourself blessed
[16:24] you should consider yourself chosen
[16:26] among men because uh you may not
[16:29] understand it this way but you can't
[16:32] come to God when you get ready you know
[16:35] it's not it's not you just making up
[16:37] your mind one day I'm going to call on
[16:39] the Lord listen the reason why you come
[16:41] to the conclusion that you need to call
[16:44] on the Lord is because he's already
[16:46] calling for you you may not realize that
[16:50] until it's uh you know after you may you
[16:53] may come to the revelation after it's
[16:55] already happened but it's God calling
[16:58] you we we hear people say sometime I
[17:00] found the Lord no you didn't find the
[17:03] Lord the Lord was never lost you and I
[17:06] were the ones that were lost so who
[17:09] found who he found me and he didn't have
[17:13] to look very hard because he knew where
[17:15] I was all the time he's God and he loved
[17:21] me so much that he paid such a supreme
[17:24] price for my soul for my salvation
[17:28] now uh there's some interesting things
[17:31] we want to talk about here we talked
[17:33] about our flesh being a veil so we want
[17:36] we need to get that out of the way we
[17:38] need to surrender our mind our will our
[17:41] emotions so that we can come into sweet
[17:44] fellowship with God uh how many of you
[17:48] know when we talk about Canaan the
[17:50] promised land Crossing Chile Jordan uh
[17:54] it is uh perhaps an allegory it is a
[17:58] symbolism of of Crossing into rest
[18:02] Crossing into peace into fullness into
[18:06] completeness into maturity
[18:09] notice in Joshua chapter 3 verse 15
[18:12] we're still talking about getting this
[18:14] flesh dealt with Joshua chapter 3 verse
[18:17] 15 and as they that bear the ark were
[18:20] come unto Jordan and the feet of the
[18:23] priests that bear the ark were dipped in
[18:26] the brim of the water for Jordan
[18:28] overfloweth all his Banks all the time
[18:32] of harvest now I I found some little
[18:35] keys in this verse of scripture that
[18:37] speak to me
[18:38] it's Harvest Time
[18:40] and the children of Israel are about to
[18:43] cross over Jordan
[18:44] and how do they find Jordan at Harvest
[18:47] Time overflowing now Jordan is a
[18:51] spiritual type of death and it also
[18:54] represents the flesh
[18:56] and so uh I find it very interesting
[18:59] that the children of Israel were about
[19:01] to enter into their promised rest the
[19:04] Fulfillment the reality of their
[19:06] promises and what what what did they
[19:08] find they found Jordan overflowed they
[19:12] found the flesh swelling up
[19:15] and this is what's going to happen every
[19:17] time we are about to cross in to the
[19:21] reality and the Fulfillment of our
[19:23] promises when we start positioning
[19:25] ourselves to come into a deeper
[19:28] Revelation or into a deeper relationship
[19:31] with the Lord Jesus Christ the flesh is
[19:34] always going to rise up the Devil
[19:37] Himself is going to anoint our our flesh
[19:40] and it's going to rise up and we're
[19:43] going to have sometimes anger problems
[19:45] or jealousy issues or all kinds of
[19:49] issues that are related to striving and
[19:52] emulations and the works of the flesh
[19:55] that the Bible so clearly defines for us
[19:57] in the New Testament and you're going to
[19:59] find some things coming up and coming
[20:01] out of you that you thought you had long
[20:03] dealt with don't be discouraged the
[20:06] blood of Jesus is against every one of
[20:09] those issues that start coming to the
[20:12] surface and the reason why they're
[20:14] coming to the surface is because God
[20:16] wants to deal with them in your life he
[20:19] doesn't want to leave you bogged down
[20:22] with the works of the flesh no sir he
[20:24] wants to bring them to the surface and
[20:27] cut them off let the ax be laid to the
[20:30] root of the tree let those issues be
[20:32] dealt with once and for all and in order
[20:35] for that to happen they have to rise to
[20:37] the surface it's that Pleasant never is
[20:41] there any pleasure in it not much in
[20:44] fact it's an awful ugly feeling it's a
[20:46] sometimes we it it kind of throws us
[20:49] into a place of condemnation but I want
[20:52] you to know there is therefore now no
[20:55] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[20:57] Jesus so when that enemy starts trying
[21:00] to Heap the condemnation on again it's
[21:02] the Jordan's Banks overflowing at
[21:05] Harvest Time right before you would move
[21:08] into a place where you could receive
[21:11] your promise the enemy starts stirring
[21:14] up things to discourage you to accuse
[21:18] you the dirty rotten devil he is a liar
[21:21] and the father of all lies he was once
[21:24] before the Throne of God accusing us to
[21:27] God but now the Bible said he is loosed
[21:31] on Earth accusing the brother to the
[21:33] brother he'll stir up relationship
[21:37] issues and conflicts and uh he will do
[21:41] anything and everything he can because
[21:43] if he can start making you feel guilty
[21:45] for for that fleshly stuff that starts
[21:48] rising up you won't position yourself to
[21:51] go forward with God you'll start
[21:53] crawling in under the hole into a hole
[21:55] somewhere under the rug somewhere and
[21:58] feeling like you're lost and there's no
[22:00] hope for you that's a dirty lie you just
[22:03] let God continue to cause Jordan's Banks
[22:06] to overflow you let all of those issues
[22:08] be dealt with by the Holy Spirit put the
[22:11] word of God on them read what the word
[22:13] of God said with every Temptation the
[22:16] Lord will make a way of Escape nothing
[22:18] has touched you but such as is common to
[22:22] man you you are not going to be overcome
[22:25] unless you give up give up or give in
[22:28] and allow the enemy God has made a way
[22:31] you go down like the priest put your
[22:34] feet in the water and say I'm coming
[22:36] over I'm crossing over to the other side
[22:39] let the enemy howl let him lie let him
[22:42] accuse my eyes are not fixed on the
[22:45] water remember Peter remember how the
[22:48] Lord bid him to come to him and as long
[22:51] as he kept his eyes on Jesus friend he
[22:54] was walking on top of the water that's
[22:56] where I want to walk I want to walk on
[22:58] top of my circumstances I want to walk
[23:01] on top of those issues that the enemy
[23:05] tries to bring up in my soul to
[23:07] disqualify and to accuse me but when
[23:10] Peter started listening to the howling
[23:13] of the wind when Peter started looking
[23:16] around at his circumstances at the waves
[23:20] that were dashing up against his legs he
[23:23] began to do what sink he began to be
[23:26] overcome by the issues of his life and
[23:30] you know what Jesus just reached out his
[23:33] hand and Peter began to recognize I
[23:35] wonder how low he got before he began to
[23:38] recognize the key is to put your eyes on
[23:42] Jesus
[23:43] don't look at your circumstances don't
[23:46] look at what the enemy is trying to stir
[23:48] up in your flesh but look upon the Lord
[23:51] and live look to him and find life and
[23:55] find health and find happiness and find
[23:58] Deliverance because there has been a way
[24:01] consecrated on your behalf God has
[24:05] opened up a way what more can he do what
[24:09] more can he do than what he has already
[24:11] done so just remember flesh always
[24:13] swells up when we are approaching our
[24:17] promised rest but God has made a way of
[24:22] Escape I believe that God wants to bring
[24:26] such Revelation to his bride in this
[24:29] hour that every Veil I had a word from
[24:32] the Lord a few years ago where God said
[24:34] I'm about to remove every Veil that
[24:38] stands between my people and what I have
[24:41] promised for them what I have elected it
[24:44] for them to have
[24:45] to walk in you know God wants us walking
[24:49] in the fullness of what his word has
[24:52] promised for us and I had that word that
[24:55] he was going to remove the veils all
[24:57] that separates us from him will be
[25:00] removed and let's believe that that will
[25:03] happen and that it will happen quickly
[25:06] as we begin to just humble ourselves
[25:10] before the Lord let me pray for you I I
[25:12] get a little stirred up and then I I
[25:15] don't stay with my notes and then I look
[25:16] down and I don't know where I'm supposed
[25:18] to be but if that doesn't bother you
[25:21] then I won't let it bother me I want God
[25:23] to use my voice I want God to direct my
[25:26] thoughts and I want him to to inspire me
[25:30] with words for what you need at this
[25:32] present moment even if it doesn't fit an
[25:34] outline and even if it doesn't flow
[25:36] smoothly I want to be a voice he can use
[25:39] let's pray together father thank you for
[25:41] making a way of Escape 8 for each and
[25:45] every one of us first a way of Salvation
[25:47] and then you've made us a way of escape
[25:49] and you have provided the cleansing
[25:52] water of your word to wash us and
[25:55] prepare us for the future so I ask right
[25:57] now that you will touch the life of
[26:00] every person watching this program right
[26:03] now let the Holy Ghost of God course
[26:06] through their body through their life
[26:08] and make an impact on their situation
[26:12] right now God I pray for those who
[26:15] seemingly are almost to be overcome by
[26:17] the waves of the flesh by the howling of
[26:20] the wind I pray that you will send the
[26:22] spirit of an overcomer upon your people
[26:24] in this hour and that they will raise up
[26:27] in the might of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:30] and in the power of the Holy Ghost bring
[26:33] healing to their sick bodies and draw
[26:35] their loved ones in I pray in the mighty
[26:38] name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:40] amen and amen thank you for watching the
[26:43] Eagles cry I hope you'll tune in again I
[26:46] have lots more I want to share with you
[26:48] bye bye for now
