[26:59] longing just to bring
[27:03] Lord something that's of worth that will
[27:07] bless your heart.
[27:12] I'll bring you more than a song.
[27:16] For a song in itself, it's not what you
[27:21] have required.
[27:26] You search much deeper within
[27:30] through the way things appear. You're
[27:33] looking into my heart.
[27:40] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[27:46] where it's all about you.

[28:41] King of endless worth.
[28:45] Oh, no one could express
[28:48] how much you deserve.
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] Though I'm weak and poor, oh Lord, all I
[29:00] have is yours. Every single breath
[29:08] and I'll bring you more than a song.
[29:13] For a song in itself is not what you
[29:17] have required.
[29:22] You search so much deeper within
[29:26] through the way things appear. You're
[29:30] looking into my heart.
[29:36] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[29:43] And it's all about you.
[29:46] It's all about you, Jesus.

[30:54] still have it all. Cuz no treasure of
[30:58] this life more than it could ever
[31:01] satisfy
[31:03] God. You are my
[31:08] everything.
[31:09] And if the highest place I reach is at
[31:13] your feet, then I've done it all. And if
[31:17] the best thing that I see is your glory,
[31:21] for that I've seen it all.

[31:30] satisfied.

[37:48] Worthy are you, oh Lord.
[37:52] [Music]
[38:02] So listen to our hearts.
[38:10] Hear our spirit sing.
[38:17] A song of praise that flows
[38:21] [Music]
[38:25] for those you have redeemed.
[38:32] And we will use the words we know
[38:37] to tell you what an awesome
[38:43] God you are.
[38:46] But when words are not enough, Lord, to
[38:50] tell you of our love, won't you listen
[38:55] to our heart?
[38:57] [Music]
[39:01] If words could fall, I pray
[39:09] from these lips of mine.
[39:16] And if I had a thousand years,
[39:22] Lord, I would still run out of time.
[39:28] [Music]
[39:30] But if you listen to my heart,
[39:34] if you listen to my heart, Lord, oh,
[39:38] every beat will say,
[39:44] Lord, thank you for the life
[39:48] and thank you for the truth and thank
[39:52] you for the way.
[39:56] [Music]
[39:58] So listen to our hearts,
[40:06] Lord. Hear our spirit sing.
[40:10] [Applause]
[40:13] Oh, a song of praise that flows
[40:20] for those you have redeemed.
[40:27] And we will use the words we know
[40:32] to tell you what an awome
[40:37] God. You are
[40:41] when words are not enough
[40:45] to tell you of our love.

[40:52] bring the music down. I want to hear you
[40:53] sing it.

[41:25] And we will use the words we know
[41:31] to tell you what an awesome
[41:37] God you are.
[41:40] But when words are not enough, oh to
[41:44] tell you of our love,
[41:48] listen to our voice.
[41:52] Sing like that again.
[41:55] So listen to our hearts.
[42:03] Hear our spirit sing.
[42:10] A song of praise that flows
[42:17] for those you have redeemed.
[42:23] [Music]
[42:25] And we will use the words we know
[42:30] &gt;&gt; to tell you what an awesome
[42:36] God you are.
[42:40] The words are not enough
[42:44] to tell you of our love.
[42:48] Listen to our heart.
[42:52] [Music]
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Then words are not enough.
[43:00] Tell you of our love.
[43:04] Listen to our heart.
[43:08] [Music]
[43:12] Oh yes, Lord.
[43:16] Oh yes, Lord.
[43:20] [Applause]
[43:22] [Music]
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, we've come to tell you how much we
[43:30] love you.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; To tell you what an awesome God you are.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Awesome God.
[43:39] You are high above it all, above every
[43:41] situation and circumstance.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; You are high above
[43:50] the things that try to tie us down.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; But I thank you that you are God who has
[43:58] come this week to cut tethers.
[44:02] You have come to set people free.
[44:06] You have come to heal bodies, to heal
[44:10] minds,
[44:12] to heal relationships.
[44:14] Lord, I thank you that that's who you
[44:16] are.
[44:19] As we have stood in your presence
[44:21] tonight,
[44:23] we've lifted our voices and our praises
[44:26] to you.
[44:28] We're just so grateful, Lord, that you
[44:30] even gave us a voice
[44:33] that we could speak our praise or sing
[44:36] our praise or shout it.
[44:39] We thank you for that.
[44:44] Thank you that needs are being met
[44:46] across the building tonight.
[44:50] Lord, as your presence has settled among
[44:52] us,
[44:54] we have reached up and taken hold of the
[44:57] promise.
[44:59] Lord, there are some that are not able
[45:01] to be here tonight with fevers. We thank
[45:05] you, Lord, that you minister to them
[45:10] of healing virtue that you already
[45:12] purchased at Calvary.
[45:17] We want to thank you Lord for meeting us
[45:19] here tonight.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; As this meeting progresses this evening,
[45:24] I thank you that you are moving among us
[45:30] to do great and mighty things,
[45:36] &gt;&gt; launching us forward.
[45:40] one more time.
[45:43] We give you praise and honor
[45:46] because it is you that deserves the
[45:48] glory. It is you who has changed our
[45:51] lives. It is you who has healed our
[45:54] bodies and healed our minds and set us
[45:57] on a path
[45:59] of righteousness for your name's sake.
[46:03] And we give you glory and honor for
[46:05] that. For it is all in the name of the
[46:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[46:11] that we pray
[46:14] and the congregation says
[46:17] &gt;&gt; amen. May the Lord bless you as you find
[46:20] your way to your seats. Would you give
[46:22] him a wonderful shout of praise that he
[46:25] is worthy of?
[46:28] Hallelujah.
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] [Applause]
[46:31] [Music]
[46:32] [Applause]
[46:35] You may be seated tonight.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:43] We are so blessed to be in the house of
[46:45] the Lord this evening. We had a
[46:48] wonderful time of celebration last
[46:50] night,
[46:52] &gt;&gt; remembering and celebrating the 50 years
[46:56] that God has
[46:58] brought our pastor through
[47:01] and used him in so many ways,
[47:04] reminiscing of the goodness of God.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; It is his goodness. If you've only been
[47:12] serving the Lord for one day,
[47:15] &gt;&gt; it is his goodness that has brought you
[47:17] through.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; If you've been serving him 50 years and
[47:21] beyond, it is because of the goodness of
[47:24] the Lord in your life.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; If you've battled in your physical body,
[47:31] it's still the goodness of the Lord that
[47:33] has brought you thus far.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; And he will see you all the way through
[47:38] to the end.
[47:40] It's his goodness. It's his grace.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And we give him honor.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Olivia and Mariah, we invite you to come
[47:49] and sing tonight for the glory of the
[47:52] Lord.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; We're blessed that you're here in the
[47:56] meeting tonight. And as I look over this
[47:59] congregation, I am so blessed.

[51:19] [Music]
[51:34] Out on the waterers,
[51:37] the storms raging high.
[51:41] Darkness around them had troubled their
[51:47] minds.
[51:49] Fear gripped their hearts. They thought
[51:53] they would die.
[51:56] They failed to remember
[52:00] that the master was not.
[52:04] And he spoke the words
[52:07] and the winds all stood still. And even
[52:13] the waters
[52:15] obeyed
[52:17] his will.
[52:19] And he calmed their storms just like he
[52:24] will mine.
[52:26] If I just remember
[52:30] he lives deep inside.
[52:34] So why should I worry?
[52:38] Why should I fear? with the very same
[52:44] Jesus.
[52:45] He is always so near. He lives in my
[52:52] heart and he hears when I cry.
[52:57] I'll call on his name till the storm
[53:02] passes by.
[53:04] We read in the Bible
[53:08] how he walked with them. Raw light to
[53:13] the darkness
[53:16] when the way grew so dim.
[53:20] How great it would be to have his
[53:24] footsteps in mind
[53:27] to walk with the master
[53:31] all of the time.
[53:34] And when trials come
[53:38] and test
[53:41] night, I'll call on the master.
[53:45] I know he'll get there on time.
[53:50] And when sickness comes and my body is
[53:55] in pain,
[53:57] all I have to do is go on his name.
[54:04] So why should I worry?
[54:08] Oh, why should I fear? In the very same
[54:14] Jesus,
[54:16] he is always so near.
[54:19] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[54:25] cry.
[54:27] I'll call on his name till the storm
[54:32] passes by.
[54:35] We read in the Bible
[54:38] how he walked with him. draw light to
[54:43] the darkness.
[54:46] When the way grew so dim, how great it
[54:51] would be to have his footsteps in mind,
[54:56] to walk with the master
[55:00] all of the time.
[55:04] And when trials come
[55:08] and dest,
[55:12] I'll call on the master.
[55:15] I know we'll get there on time.
[55:19] And when sickness comes in and my body
[55:24] is in pain,
[55:27] all I have to do is hold on his face.
[55:34] So why should I worry?
[55:38] Why should I fear in the very same
[55:43] Jesus?
[55:45] He is always so near. He lives in my
[55:51] heart and he hears when I cry.
[55:56] I'll call on his name.
[56:00] Still the storm passes by.
[56:04] So why should I worry?
[56:08] Why should I fear with the very same
[56:13] Jesus?
[56:15] He is always so near. He lives in my
[56:22] heart.
[56:23] He hears when I cry.
[56:27] I'll call on his name
[56:31] till the storm passes by.
[56:36] [Music]
[56:39] I'll call on his name
[56:42] till the stor passes
[56:45] by.
[56:46] [Music]
[56:54] [Applause]
[57:01] [Music]
[57:03] Oh, praise the Lord.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I serve the living God.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He doesn't change.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; We're going to receive the offering
[57:16] tonight. Giving for the work of the
[57:18] Lord. Brother Ellas, would you come and
[57:20] stand here? Brother Austin Hodgees, can
[57:23] I ask you to come and stand on the other
[57:25] side?
[57:26] And we're going to receive the tithe and
[57:29] offering if you have tithe. Do we have
[57:31] the offering bags back there?
[57:35] They seem to be missing.
[57:41] Brother Cade is going to sing. We're
[57:43] going to worship with him while we're
[57:44] bringing our offering.
[57:48] We're giving for the expenses of the
[57:50] meeting, knowing that God is our
[57:52] provider and he knows how to take care
[57:54] of every expense.
[57:57] But I have found out in my journey with
[58:00] the Lord, I've never seen dollar bills
[58:03] falling out of the sky.
[58:05] Most of the time,
[58:08] it comes from these.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; So, let's give to the Lord tonight. As
[58:12] brother Cade singing, let's worship
[58:14] together with our giving and with our
[58:17] worship to the Lord in singing.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] [Music]
[58:43] As I look out across the land, I see
[58:47] God's mighty hand
[58:50] bride of Christ adorning a wedding gown.

[59:01] in courage b.

[59:48] done by the apostles hands.

[59:57] jail they sing and shout while

[1:09:30] up.
[1:09:33] Oh, there's a new
[1:09:36] church. by God.
[1:09:41] Now the Bible plainly tells how the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost have felt and I see it. Signs and
[1:09:48] wonders were done by the apostles hand.
[1:09:55] Demon spirits were cast out. And in the
[1:09:59] jail they sing and shout. But I'm free
[1:10:02] while surrounded by God's holy angel.
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:08] I'm rising up. Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] Thank the Lord. There's a new Testament
[1:10:18] church. Rising up.
[1:10:22] I'm rising up.

[1:10:33] rising up.
[1:10:37] Rising up.
[1:10:40] Rising up.
[1:10:44] There's a new test of the church.
[1:10:48] Rising. Can you just put your hands
[1:10:50] together? I'm rising up.
[1:10:55] Rising up.
[1:11:01] to church.
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:04] Thank God.
[1:11:08] Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] Thank the Lord. There's a new testament
[1:11:16] church rising up.
[1:11:20] Oh, there's a new testament church

[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:53] here.
[1:11:56] Heat.
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:12] Heat.
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:31] Hallelujah.
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:44] Glory.
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:13:05] Heat up
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:34] But I would like to inform inform you of
[1:13:36] something.
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] I just got a feeling
[1:13:46] when Paul and Silas
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:49] were fixing to break out of jail.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; God was going to do it.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; God has done it for you.
[1:14:03] Why would we be quiet?
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; I've got something to shout about.
[1:14:32] Jesus saved me out of a life of sin.
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; That's enough to shout about.
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; But that wasn't the end of my story.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; He sent along his sanctifying power and
[1:14:51] he brought me a little bit of a little
[1:14:54] bit closer to himself and then he
[1:14:56] baptized me in the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:01] And he hasn't stopped there
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; because he keeps pouring his Holy Ghost,
[1:15:07] his holy spirit into me over and over
[1:15:10] again. And then he gives me the
[1:15:12] revelation of his precious word. And he
[1:15:15] keeps revealing it and revealing it and
[1:15:18] revealing it.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, why would I not lift my voice and
[1:15:24] give him praise?
[1:15:27] I'm a part of that New Testament church
[1:15:31] that is rising up, coming into her
[1:15:34] place, her position, recognizing who she
[1:15:38] is and the authority that she's been
[1:15:41] given in the end time
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Let your kingdom come
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; and let your will be done in this earth.
[1:15:54] Not just in that dirt out there, but in
[1:15:56] this earth right here. Let your kingdom
[1:16:00] come and let your will be done in earth
[1:16:03] as it is in heaven.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:16:09] Hallelujah.
[1:16:12] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:22] From glory
[1:16:24] to glory.
[1:16:27] He's changing me.
[1:16:31] I'm sorry to tell you, I have been
[1:16:33] impatient along the way.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Some of you have been, too.
[1:16:42] We have thrown around words like, "I'm
[1:16:45] just going to quit."
[1:16:47] What good is that going to do? What you
[1:16:49] going to go back to?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to go back to.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep pressing on
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; for the prize in Christ Jesus.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Because he has placed it before my eyes.
[1:17:03] And he keeps unveiling it more and more
[1:17:05] and more as the preaching of his word is
[1:17:08] given to us. He's unveiling it more and
[1:17:10] more. That prize that awaits his people,
[1:17:13] this New Testament church.
[1:17:16] I want you to lift your hands toward our
[1:17:18] pastor, Brother Shelley. He's coming to
[1:17:20] preach the word tonight.
[1:17:23] And you can tell he's just a little bit.
[1:17:26] He He's stifled by this voice
[1:17:30] because he's a shout. He's a praiser.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And his voice is a little stifled
[1:17:36] tonight. It's he's a little choked up.
[1:17:38] And I want us to ask the Lord to open up
[1:17:40] his vocal cords. Open up his voice.
[1:17:43] Anything that would hinder his voice, we
[1:17:45] want to go open and we want it gone in
[1:17:47] the name of Jesus Christ. As we pray
[1:17:50] over our pastor, our brother tonight, we
[1:17:54] speak into his life, into his vocal
[1:17:56] cords, God, as he steps behind this desk
[1:18:00] that he would be able to preach, that
[1:18:02] his voice will carry, that his voice
[1:18:04] will be able to speak the words with
[1:18:07] clarity tonight.
[1:18:10] God, use him
[1:18:12] to speak to us.
[1:18:16] Heavy presence of God over him call of
[1:18:21] fire
[1:18:23] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; We glorify you Lord.
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:33] For they that wait
[1:18:37] upon the Lord
[1:18:40] shall renew
[1:18:43] their strength.
[1:18:45] They shall mountain
[1:18:49] with wings
[1:18:52] as he goes.
[1:18:57] They shall run
[1:19:00] and not be weary.
[1:19:03] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:19:09] Teach me Lord.
[1:19:11] Teach me Lord
[1:19:15] to wait.
[1:19:17] Sing again.
[1:19:19] All they that wait
[1:19:22] upon the Lord
[1:19:25] shall renew
[1:19:28] their strength.
[1:19:31] They shall mount up with wings
[1:19:37] as he goes.
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:42] They shall run and not be weary.
[1:19:48] They shall walk.
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:20:07] upon the Lord
[1:20:10] shall renew
[1:20:13] their strength.
[1:20:17] Mount up with wings
[1:20:22] and
[1:20:27] they
[1:20:33] shall walk
[1:20:35] and not fade.
[1:20:38] Teach me Lord.
[1:20:40] Teach me Lord
[1:20:44] to wait.
[1:20:45] Turn it up as loud as you can without
[1:20:47] squealing it. They that wait
[1:20:51] upon the Lord
[1:20:54] shall renew.
[1:21:00] They shall mount up
[1:21:03] with wings
[1:21:06] as eagles.
[1:21:10] They shall run
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:16] They shall walk
[1:21:20] slipping around. Teach me Lord.
[1:21:25] Teach me Lord
[1:21:28] to wait.
[1:21:31] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:58] The Lord is good.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; I said the Lord is good.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you're going to stand
[1:22:06] to listen to that.
[1:22:08] You think you can handle it for a few
[1:22:10] minutes?
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Be seated just a moment.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; I had to pull my socks up.
[1:22:22] It's been quite a while
[1:22:24] since I shouted my socks down.
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm not ashamed.
[1:22:35] How many of you can say, "I'm not
[1:22:37] ashamed."
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I was there when the Holy Ghost fell,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; and I'm not ashamed that it fell on me.
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be an oldtime Christian
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; than anything I know.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Saved and sanctified,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:23:02] Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Ready to serve the Lord.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; I can't use what voice I have for all
[1:23:11] the things that I would like to say
[1:23:14] because I want to give you a message.
[1:23:15] And I want you to know you're going to
[1:23:17] need the Lord's help to be able to hear
[1:23:20] me.
[1:23:22] And if there's one thing that I can't
[1:23:24] take, it's a voice that's annoying.
[1:23:28] God.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; So, I think you're going to have to
[1:23:31] struggle tonight with an annoying voice.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; May God give you the grace to hear
[1:23:37] beyond this voice.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; I hope you can hear another voice.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; I would like to take the time to go
[1:23:45] around the room and greet everyone.
[1:23:48] Brother Gley has such a good eye for
[1:23:50] that and names and he's so good with all
[1:23:52] that. I would have to get his help to do
[1:23:55] it. But there are so many memories that
[1:23:57] are represented in this room this
[1:23:59] evening.
[1:24:00] Precious memories to me. Anything that
[1:24:04] God has done is precious.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that even in the death of
[1:24:12] the saints, precious,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; costly,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; valuable in the sight of the Lord
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; is the death of the saints.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want me to use this one so
[1:24:26] I can hold it closer?
[1:24:30] Do you want me to hold the hand, Mike?
[1:24:32] Is the question.
[1:24:34] I don't think you're going to be able to
[1:24:35] work on that too much, but you can twist
[1:24:38] all the knobs you like.
[1:24:42] I wished I had some knobs you could come
[1:24:44] and adjust me so my voice would work.
[1:24:51] The Crrenshaws have taken over the
[1:24:53] studio.
[1:24:55] Ain't that wonderful to have have to
[1:24:57] have somebody sitting in there? Let's
[1:24:59] thank God for that.
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:07] Sister Renee,
[1:25:10] I'm right. I think I'm right. Tell me if
[1:25:13] I'm not. I get a little confused.
[1:25:17] Your mother was Barbara and your dad was
[1:25:20] Neil.
[1:25:22] I'm so honored and so blessed to have
[1:25:24] you here. I'm going to use this one.
[1:25:30] Not the coat.
[1:25:33] I'm too chunky for that.
[1:25:37] I haven't been chunky since high school.
[1:25:40] I'm just just big fat.
[1:25:43] They say you can't say that, but I just
[1:25:45] did.
[1:25:48] I don't think Fluffy would get get the
[1:25:50] message across, would he?
[1:25:57] I loved
[1:26:00] the entire Green family
[1:26:04] more than I could tell you.
[1:26:07] And uh
[1:26:10] I really loved I didn't get to know them
[1:26:12] that long because it wasn't long
[1:26:15] that uh Sister Renee lost her beautiful
[1:26:18] mother. I'm telling you, she to me, I've
[1:26:22] told this everywhere. She's one of the
[1:26:23] most beautiful ladies I ever laid eyes
[1:26:25] on in my life.
[1:26:27] And it just wasn't just her natural
[1:26:29] beauty. There was just a glow about her.
[1:26:34] And um when I went to Tucson the first
[1:26:37] time,
[1:26:39] maybe the second time, I stayed in
[1:26:42] Brother Jackson's apartment
[1:26:45] at Tucson Tabernacle.
[1:26:48] One day the phone rang
[1:26:51] and it was Granny Green, your
[1:26:53] grandmother.
[1:26:55] She said, "Brother Steve,
[1:26:58] this is Granny Green." Well, that's what
[1:27:00] some of them call me.
[1:27:02] and she said, 'I just want to tell you,
[1:27:04] son, don't slow down.
[1:27:09] Keep on preaching hard and praying hard
[1:27:13] and shouting hard
[1:27:15] and don't cut them any slack
[1:27:18] and start with my family
[1:27:22] because she said, "I've got to know when
[1:27:27] I leave here that they're going to
[1:27:28] follow me all the way.
[1:27:32] I've never forgotten that.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; It meant something to me. It wasn't but
[1:27:38] a couple services later, Sister Renee,
[1:27:40] that brother, somebody come and punched
[1:27:43] me on the platform I was singing, the
[1:27:45] Holy Ghost will set your feet to
[1:27:47] dancing.
[1:27:49] And somebody come and said, "You better
[1:27:51] take a look cuz you may never see that
[1:27:53] again in your lifetime. That don't
[1:27:54] happen often." I said, "What is it?" And
[1:27:57] I look back in the back corner of the
[1:27:59] tabernacle and it was your dad dancing
[1:28:02] up a storm
[1:28:05] praising God with his hands in the air
[1:28:07] and his face a glow. And it meant so
[1:28:11] much to me. I've told this church
[1:28:15] before. You feel it's coming back.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; My voice is getting a little stronger. I
[1:28:21] feel it.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I feel it.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Yeah,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; those I know that uh young people don't
[1:28:30] have much patience for old people when
[1:28:32] we reminisce,
[1:28:35] but uh you're at our house tonight.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; The joy, the joy. Brother Jeff, uh I
[1:28:44] didn't mean to call attention. I wasn't
[1:28:46] trying to be absolutely ridiculous, but
[1:28:49] how many times have I listened to a to
[1:28:52] an MP3 from the Tucson Tabernacle and
[1:28:55] Brother Green look at you down on the
[1:28:57] front row and say, "Whoa, I wished I
[1:29:00] could fit in a suit that looked like
[1:29:02] that
[1:29:04] because Brother Jeff would always be
[1:29:06] dressed so nice and colors that uh well,
[1:29:10] I wouldn't get by with, but he's got the
[1:29:13] he's got the right complexion for any
[1:29:15] color
[1:29:17] and brother Green would say, "I'm going
[1:29:18] to lose weight one of these days and I'm
[1:29:21] going to wear one of your suits." I
[1:29:22] don't know if that ever happened or not,
[1:29:24] but I could go all over this room.
[1:29:28] I've told this church every time we sang
[1:29:30] in the city where the lamb is the light.
[1:29:32] It reminds me of your dad. In that city
[1:29:36] where the lamb is the light.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Woo! I've got a reservation.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; How many of you have a reservation?
[1:29:45] and and there's no time to slack up now.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; We've got to press this thing.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to give God praise for these
[1:29:54] amazing musicians.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Anointed.
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:00] Anointed.
[1:30:02] [Applause]
[1:30:09] So glad you're all here this evening.
[1:30:11] Let's hurry. Could we stand again?
[1:30:15] First John,
[1:30:17] chapter 2.
[1:30:19] Pastor Isaac, hold up your hand so
[1:30:22] everybody knows exactly which one you
[1:30:24] are.
[1:30:26] I know that sometime he he's got a
[1:30:29] brother that looks a lot They look a lot
[1:30:31] alike.
[1:30:34] I need their wives with them to be able
[1:30:36] to tell them apart. Sometimes it's my
[1:30:38] memory. I just can't quite remember it.
[1:30:41] They're not identical. They're not
[1:30:42] twins.
[1:30:45] But that is the pastor of this beautiful
[1:30:47] group from Indiana.
[1:30:50] And uh what kind of a pastor
[1:30:54] allows his people to come and go to
[1:30:57] another church
[1:31:00] states away, hours away,
[1:31:03] and doesn't check on them, I guess, to
[1:31:06] make sure that I'm down here trying to
[1:31:08] pull them or
[1:31:10] anything like that. He's blessed
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; to send them. He's blessed to come with
[1:31:16] them. And I just want you to know that
[1:31:19] that is very rare.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; It is very very rare. I don't know
[1:31:24] anything too much about
[1:31:27] uh other cultures, but I'll tell you in
[1:31:29] the in this uh church culture, church
[1:31:32] environment,
[1:31:34] pastors often get jealous of one
[1:31:36] another. They don't understand each
[1:31:38] other. They they they uh talk bad about
[1:31:42] each other. And I really appreciate the
[1:31:44] fellowship that God has given us with
[1:31:47] you precious people. We're just one and
[1:31:49] the same. But I wanted to thank you for
[1:31:52] for being with us. And uh I want to
[1:31:57] thank you for the air conditioning
[1:32:00] that you just installed in your brand
[1:32:02] new church.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. Even though that'd be
[1:32:09] November the 1st, I'm probably going to
[1:32:11] need it.
[1:32:14] there. November 2nd, I guess, Sunday. 1
[1:32:17] John
[1:32:19] 2 24. Let that therefore
[1:32:23] abide in you
[1:32:27] which ye have heard from the beginning.
[1:32:32] If that which ye have heard from the
[1:32:35] beginning shall remain in you,
[1:32:39] ye shall also
[1:32:42] continue
[1:32:44] in the son
[1:32:46] and in the father.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Follow this.
[1:32:51] This is the promise
[1:32:54] that he hath promised us even
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; eternal life. Sister Chloe,
[1:33:06] I I don't know why I'm in the middle of
[1:33:07] scripture reading.
[1:33:10] My kids will probably say, "Dad, what
[1:33:12] were you doing?" But I just in my mind's
[1:33:16] eye just caught a glimpse of your
[1:33:18] precious grandparents
[1:33:20] that I loved so much.
[1:33:24] And to think that you're here really
[1:33:27] blesses me.
[1:33:29] I hope sometime that they get to catch a
[1:33:33] glimpse of good things that happen among
[1:33:36] us. Don't you?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; I do. And I believe they do. I don't
[1:33:41] want to scare anybody or weird anybody
[1:33:44] out. Some of you are so sensitive.
[1:33:48] But I know what I've been taught and I
[1:33:50] believe it that they're not a million
[1:33:53] miles away.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; They're with us.
[1:33:58] They're just in a faster dimension
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; than the one we're living in right now.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You heard brother Terry sing that last
[1:34:06] night, the song he wrote, There is a
[1:34:08] land. And one of these days, we're going
[1:34:10] to step toward the middle.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to wrap my arms around
[1:34:15] Brother Al one more time. And maybe over
[1:34:18] there, Sister Minnie, too, because I
[1:34:21] love them so much. Now, back to the
[1:34:23] scripture reading.
[1:34:26] She's the one who wrote, "Oh, praise the
[1:34:29] Lord.
[1:34:30] It's Jesus that I see.
[1:34:35] The Son of Man revealed in you and me.
[1:34:40] Oh, I'm so glad that I'm part of the
[1:34:45] family
[1:34:47] where the people
[1:34:50] are perfect as can be. Don't speak evil
[1:34:56] of your brother, lest you speak evil of
[1:35:00] the law.
[1:35:02] For we know the law is perfect
[1:35:06] without a single flaw.
[1:35:09] As long as your brothers repented
[1:35:13] of the wrong that he has done, then your
[1:35:18] brother is as perfect
[1:35:22] as perfect.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; right here. the son of man
[1:35:36] revealed in you and me.
[1:35:41] Oh, I thank God that I'm part of this
[1:35:46] family
[1:35:48] where the people
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Lord forgive me for that interruption.
[1:35:59] This is the promise
[1:36:02] that he hath promised us, even eternal
[1:36:05] life. These things have I written unto
[1:36:09] you concerning them that seduce you.
[1:36:17] Brother Cade was singing about those who
[1:36:20] say that these things are over with.
[1:36:23] But the anointing
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; which ye have received of him
[1:36:30] abideth
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; abideth
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:36:38] And ye need not that any man should
[1:36:41] teach you,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; but as the same anointing teacheth you
[1:36:48] of all things,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; what the anointing
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; teaches you all things.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading what it says. And is
[1:37:01] truth
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; and is no lie. Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And even as it hath taught you,
[1:37:11] ye shall abide.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody say abide.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Ye shall abide in him.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; The anointing is abiding in you.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And it strengthens the connection and
[1:37:26] the union between you and he. Amen.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; And because of that abiding anointing,
[1:37:35] you can know the grace of abiding in the
[1:37:40] vine
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; where the life comes from. Aren't you
[1:37:44] glad?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; And now little children,
[1:37:48] abide in him.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say, "Abide in
[1:37:54] him."
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Abide.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; In him.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; In him.
[1:38:00] that when he shall appear,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; we don't have to run and hide our
[1:38:07] nakedness
[1:38:09] behind the bush.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Little bride, where are you?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; But you will meet him with confidence
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; because you have been abiding in the
[1:38:26] anointing.
[1:38:29] That anointing makes the difference.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; It shatters yolks.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; It sets captives free.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Heals the sick and raises the dead.
[1:38:43] Causes tumors to fall off.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; And it causes blind scales
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; to fall off of our eyes
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; so that we no longer see creeds.
[1:39:00] and dogmas.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; we no longer believe that God had a
[1:39:06] mother.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And we can see clearly
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; all because of the anointing.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; When he shall appear, we may have
[1:39:19] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[1:39:22] at his coming. that voice comes calling
[1:39:25] for you and you run out from behind the
[1:39:28] bush.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "Here I am, Lord."
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have anything to hide because
[1:39:33] you're already hidden.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You're already hidden in him. If you
[1:39:38] know that he is righteous,
[1:39:41] you know that everyone
[1:39:44] that doeth righteousness
[1:39:47] is born.
[1:39:50] Is born.
[1:39:52] I'm going to have to seem very
[1:39:54] oldfashioned and just I'm probably going
[1:39:55] to have to uh uh re uh speak every word
[1:39:59] here. Somebody say we'll we'll be here
[1:40:01] all night.
[1:40:03] Born.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Born of him.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; You've already had the earth birth.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; But there's another birth.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; One that comes from above. And it's not
[1:40:18] complete until you've come all the way
[1:40:20] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Come all the way.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Don't you be satisfied with hearing how
[1:40:28] wonderful it is
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; or how glorious it was
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; from the young to the old.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Get him.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Get him.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And when you've I tell you, it changes
[1:40:45] everything.
[1:40:47] Father,
[1:40:49] we need you tonight.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; We've already been to church.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; I felt what was like to me electricity.
[1:41:00] I'm so thankful. It's not about feeling.
[1:41:05] It's about faith. It's about what we
[1:41:08] know, not what we feel.
[1:41:11] But I want to thank you that every now
[1:41:13] and then,
[1:41:15] quite often you really you allow us to
[1:41:18] feel,
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; to sense, to know that you have walked
[1:41:24] among us.
[1:41:26] And Lord, that is life to us. And it's
[1:41:30] the only thing that keeps us with an
[1:41:32] ability to do life,
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; to pay bills,
[1:41:38] to sort out family issues,
[1:41:42] to choose where we're going to eat to go
[1:41:44] to lunch, and all the other big
[1:41:46] conflicts in life, every last one of
[1:41:49] them. Because of you, we can press
[1:41:52] through it all. We're so grateful
[1:41:55] tonight for your presence among us. We
[1:41:59] ask for you to bless your word. It's
[1:42:02] already blessed,
[1:42:04] but bless us to hear and bless your
[1:42:07] servant to speak in the name above every
[1:42:10] name. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:42:13] And the saint said,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Be seated. Would you? God bless you. I
[1:42:18] know you're a little crowded.
[1:42:23] Someone might be in your personal space.
[1:42:28] But what a good problem to have.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Dwayne, I thank you so much.
[1:42:35] What what what evangelist
[1:42:38] what evangelist
[1:42:40] drives and preaches a sermon and a half
[1:42:43] and still stays all week.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that doesn't happen
[1:42:49] often.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; They're in and out. They anymore they
[1:42:53] fly in for one night.
[1:42:57] fly out the next night. I've never even
[1:43:00] offered him a plane ticket.
[1:43:03] How terrible.
[1:43:05] But I figure that if he come if it was
[1:43:08] on a plane, he might not be able to
[1:43:09] bring them all. And he's his whole
[1:43:11] family's here tonight. Isn't God good?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Look at Isaiah 10:27.
[1:43:18] Austin, you stay close to me, will you?
[1:43:20] Best you can. And it shall come to pass
[1:43:23] in that day that his burden shall be
[1:43:27] taken away from off thy shoulder, and
[1:43:30] his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; shall be what?
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Not broken.
[1:43:46] broken means in pieces with the
[1:43:49] potential of putting it back together.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; But when the anointing sets you free,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; when the anointing destroys the yoke
[1:44:00] from off of your neck, no demon,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; no devil,
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; no religious system
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; can glue it back together and control
[1:44:11] your life again. Because King Jesus
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; has not just broken the yoke,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; but he has destroyed it
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; by the power,
[1:44:25] by the authority
[1:44:27] of the anointing.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Am I annoying you yet?
[1:44:38] That burden taken away,
[1:44:43] that yoke
[1:44:45] destroyed.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; We are used to
[1:44:50] having the theme. It's by the word. It's
[1:44:54] by the word. It's by the word. We are
[1:44:57] birthed by the word. We're sanctified by
[1:45:00] the word. The word breaks. The word does
[1:45:04] the and that is nothing but the truth.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; But Isaiah prophesied in a time that the
[1:45:14] word had not yet become flesh.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; And so he didn't say in the Messiah, the
[1:45:24] Messiah will destroy the yolk.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; But what is going to be in the Messiah?
[1:45:32] What will be in the Christ,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; what will be in the manifestation of the
[1:45:37] promised one,
[1:45:39] that that's in him will destroy,
[1:45:44] not break, destroy the yoke of bondage.
[1:45:48] Amen.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; You know, we sometimes speak about the
[1:45:54] anointing
[1:45:57] as though it was a temporary engagement.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; A fleeting feeling.
[1:46:06] Oh my, didn't you feel
[1:46:10] the anointing?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; You ever said that?
[1:46:15] My,
[1:46:16] wasn't that song anointed?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You just heard me say these musicians,
[1:46:24] anointed musicians.
[1:46:28] Well, I want you to know that any
[1:46:30] musician that would surrender their life
[1:46:33] and gift to the Lord
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; might not even be based on their skill
[1:46:40] set.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; But if that anointing falls on them,
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; it's the anointing that makes the
[1:46:49] difference.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; It's not seminary that makes the
[1:46:53] difference. It's not even years of
[1:46:55] experience that makes the difference.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; It's the anointing.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And the anointing is not a temporary
[1:47:06] engagement. And the anointing is not a
[1:47:09] fleeting feeling or a temporary
[1:47:13] uncction. Right.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; The anointing is not just in the moment
[1:47:18] that it feels like your hair is raising
[1:47:21] up on your arm or you have a goosebump
[1:47:25] somewhere. You say, "Oh, don't you feel
[1:47:28] that?" That is not all there is.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to know the anointing can be
[1:47:37] working and you don't feel him.
[1:47:41] Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I I just don't see how
[1:47:44] that's possible." It's possible.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Because it's not your feeler. He comes
[1:47:49] to engage.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; It's your inner man.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when the anointing comes
[1:47:59] to the inner man, it it absolutely
[1:48:02] rushes right to the surface.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; And you feel it.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; You You have tears. You have laughter.
[1:48:10] You have joy.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; You you you have feeling.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; But don't be fooled.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; The anointing is not just what we feel.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; It's more than that.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; It's divine.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Did you know it?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; The anointing is divine.
[1:48:32] They asked one time about one of the
[1:48:35] worship songs that uh that says, "I love
[1:48:39] your presence."
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Do you think it's
[1:48:44] all right for us to say we love his
[1:48:46] presence?" rather than saying each time,
[1:48:50] "I love him."
[1:48:54] Guess what I said?
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:48:59] Yes.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Because if you can say I love his
[1:49:04] presence, his presence is where he is.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; And he is where his presence is.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And when you sing, I love his presence,
[1:49:15] you mean I want to be where he is.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I want him to be where I am.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; And guess what? That's possible. Not
[1:49:24] only in revival, not only in camp
[1:49:27] meeting, but that's possible 365
[1:49:32] days of the year. There is an abiding
[1:49:36] anointing
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; that you and I need to be aware of
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; that's not based on whether we have
[1:49:44] problems or conflicts or heartache or
[1:49:48] bills to pay.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; It's an abiding anointing.
[1:49:53] and we feed on it and we draw strength
[1:49:56] from
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; I keep saying it.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; When my whole point is
[1:50:07] we're not talking about an it.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a hymn.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; The anointing is a hymn.
[1:50:20] I'm going to go somewhere with you in a
[1:50:22] moment.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; The anointing is much more than just a
[1:50:26] fleeting encounter
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; or a good service.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; It's so much more.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; It's the great fountain of life and
[1:50:36] light.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; It's the logos.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; It is.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; It's the eternal and invisible
[1:50:44] spirit of God. Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit, the eternal spirit that
[1:50:51] we refer to as father.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; somebody here may have forgotten that
[1:51:02] there are not three persons in this.
[1:51:09] You don't have to figure which one
[1:51:11] you're praying to,
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; which one you're experiencing,
[1:51:15] which one you're describing because
[1:51:18] there's only one to experience.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; That is the eternal spirit.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; He manifests himself in many ways,
[1:51:31] including three offices. But that
[1:51:34] eternal spirit is one
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; and that is watch that is the anointing.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Not a feeling,
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; not a good sermon.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Either you're not persuaded
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; or you want to listen carefully. And I
[1:51:58] like that. But I'm still going to need
[1:52:01] to sick them every now and then. Amen.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; It's the one which is and which was and
[1:52:08] which is to come.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; The anointing is Emmanuel.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; He's the almighty one.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; The anointing is a person.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; He's the Messiah, the Christ, the
[1:52:26] anointed one.
[1:52:28] The anointing is the spirit and life of
[1:52:34] the anointed one.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; The anointing is the spirit and life of
[1:52:40] the anointed one.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; If you have experienced the spirit and
[1:52:46] the life of the Messiah, of the anointed
[1:52:49] one,
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; then you have experienced him.
[1:52:55] There's no difference between him and
[1:52:57] his spirit.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; the anointing is not an it.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; There is no pronoun confusion here.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Him.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; I met him.
[1:53:23] I felt him.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; I experienced him.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I had a yoke destroyed off of my neck
[1:53:31] because of him.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Not it.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Him.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Before the word was written,
[1:53:44] before the Bible existed,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; there was him.
[1:53:50] Before
[1:53:53] there was anything to worship,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; there was him.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; There's some folks around our ranks
[1:54:08] that are getting a little sideswiped
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; by this. Who would have ever thought
[1:54:15] after fighting the wondous battle
[1:54:19] we would have preachers preaching
[1:54:20] tuness?
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Why would you stop at tunis?
[1:54:28] What about fiveness, sixness, sevenness?
[1:54:32] You will never be able to put God in
[1:54:35] your theological box.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; He can manifest himself father, son, and
[1:54:41] holy ghost. but also healer, deliverer,
[1:54:46] counselor,
[1:54:48] mighty God.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And this isn't 10 different one.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; One one spirit him
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; even before he was worshiped him. Thank
[1:55:05] God.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; There was nothing to worship him
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; until he created something
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; to worship him.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; And then he had to create a himymn.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I better be careful.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He had to to begin the creation work
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; of your redemption.
[1:55:28] and he had to put him
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; in a body of flesh.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; We're getting ahead of oursel a little
[1:55:39] bit. You see, it all goes back to
[1:55:42] Deuteronomy 6:4. Here,
[1:55:48] here
[1:55:52] in Hebrew, Schma
[1:55:58] Mama says to her son,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; one word. And to that child, it says,
[1:56:07] "Are you listening?"
[1:56:09] [Music]
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; God is saying to us in his word, Schma,
[1:56:15] are you listening to me?
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, Israel,
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; the Lord, which is the Yode V. Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even told us, he said,
[1:56:28] "Now, we know Jehovah's not right,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; but it's the English word that we have
[1:56:34] and we use it, but he said, "We know
[1:56:35] it's not right.
[1:56:37] It's what some people call the
[1:56:39] impronouncable,
[1:56:41] unpronouncable
[1:56:43] word of name of God, the yod and the
[1:56:46] vau,
[1:56:48] which we we could say Yava, Yahweh,
[1:56:52] Yahweh.
[1:56:55] But our English Bible has helped us not
[1:56:59] make
[1:57:01] ignorant mistakes and it has always been
[1:57:03] translated
[1:57:05] Lord.
[1:57:07] The real word for Lord is not Yahweh.
[1:57:11] The real word is Adonai.
[1:57:14] And there are places where you will read
[1:57:16] the word Lord and it'll be Adonai. There
[1:57:19] are places where you will read uh Lord
[1:57:22] and it will really be the divine name.
[1:57:25] Why are you Why are you even saying
[1:57:26] this? I want you to know who's talking
[1:57:28] to you. I'm not talking to you.
[1:57:32] But I might look at some of you and say,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; "Hear me."
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, spiritual Israel, royal seed of
[1:57:43] Abraham, hear me. The Lord Yahweh,
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; the only God,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; our God,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; which is Elohim. That word God there is
[1:57:58] Elohim.
[1:58:00] And they like to say, you know, our
[1:58:02] brothers, our cousins,
[1:58:04] they like to say, there you go. Elohim
[1:58:08] is a plural noun.
[1:58:13] They don't know a whole lot about
[1:58:14] Hebrew. I don't either.
[1:58:17] But in Hebrew, even an adamant object
[1:58:22] has gender.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I know you have never met a female
[1:58:29] chair.
[1:58:31] or a male chair. But in Hebrew, it's
[1:58:34] spoken that way.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And the gender
[1:58:39] uh translation, the word that's used to
[1:58:41] describe that chair as female or male is
[1:58:45] dependent on who's talking about the
[1:58:48] chair, who's sitting in the chair, who's
[1:58:52] moving the chair. If Jacob were to reach
[1:58:55] up there and move that chair, we would
[1:58:58] choose a male word to describe the chair
[1:59:02] because we wouldn't want to say that
[1:59:04] Jacob is picking up a female chair and
[1:59:06] moving it all around. Nothing wrong with
[1:59:09] that,
[1:59:10] but that's just not the way Hebrew
[1:59:12] works. And just because a Hebrew word is
[1:59:16] classified as a plurality
[1:59:19] doesn't mean that you're talking about
[1:59:21] more than one God.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; The word Elohim is a plurality
[1:59:27] of attributes
[1:59:29] of offices
[1:59:31] of abilities.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; All that he can do
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; makes him our Elohim.
[1:59:43] You're saying a lot when you call him
[1:59:46] Elohim.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; You can say Elohim. It's English.
[1:59:51] Uh in Hebrew, when you're when you're
[1:59:54] using the plural form of a word, it's
[1:59:56] not I am, it's im.
[1:59:59] And so I like to say Elohim. And when
[2:00:02] we're calling on Elohim, we're calling
[2:00:06] on the government of God, the healing
[2:00:09] virtue of God, the creative power of
[2:00:13] God, what he did as father, what he does
[2:00:16] as son, what he does as Holy Ghost,
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; uh what he does as problem solver,
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; mountain mover,
[2:00:31] wonder worker.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; If God can do it, he is it.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; I'm really going to say something after
[2:00:43] a while.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; If God can do it, he is it.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Did you understand that God is not just
[2:00:54] what he can accomplish?
[2:00:57] It's not just what he does for us that
[2:01:00] causes us to love him. That's right.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; We love him because of who he is.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; If he never saved another soul, I'm not
[2:01:13] going to fall out of love with him.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; If he never healed my body again, I'm
[2:01:19] not going to stop loving him
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; because I don't love him for his favors.
[2:01:25] I love him for who he is.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; And in order to know who he is, you've
[2:01:31] got to read the book. You've got to read
[2:01:33] the God manual.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; These big companies, they're charging uh
[2:01:40] big prices for appliances
[2:01:44] that aren't going to last.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; They know they're not going to last when
[2:01:49] they make them,
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; and they don't want you to know too much
[2:01:53] about them.
[2:01:55] So now you don't even get a manual.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; You get a QR code.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And it'll take you to a little little
[2:02:08] bit of information.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Don't stand in water and plug it in.
[2:02:20] Please remove all clothes from your
[2:02:23] children before you put them in
[2:02:28] the washing machine.
[2:02:31] English is somebody's second, third,
[2:02:33] fourth, or fifth language. When they
[2:02:35] tell you to take the clothes off your
[2:02:37] children before you put them
[2:02:42] clothes or children
[2:02:52] you used to get manuals. How many of you
[2:02:54] know
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; cataloges
[2:02:57] every language
[2:03:00] and uh I know some of you threw them
[2:03:02] out. I didn't.
[2:03:04] I know you have no problem believing
[2:03:05] that. And when one drawer would fill up,
[2:03:08] brother Sulfus of of manuals, we just
[2:03:10] make another drawer
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; because we we didn't want to. And we
[2:03:15] kept the boxes for a lot of things, too.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Because we might want to send it back.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Things sure are different now.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; God still has a manual.
[2:03:32] You don't have to guess what you're
[2:03:33] going to get.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; How long it's going to last,
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; what it's going to be able to do for
[2:03:40] you.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; What he's not going to do for you.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; He sent his word.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; His word still works.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; It may be oldfashioned to some,
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; but not to this little bride.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; It's our life manual. It's our life
[2:03:59] coach.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; It's the correction that we need. It's
[2:04:02] the encouragement that we need.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Here, Schma.
[2:04:09] Oh, Israel,
[2:04:12] the the Yahweh,
[2:04:14] our Elohim
[2:04:17] is Ekhad
[2:04:20] one.
[2:04:22] Not Elohim one.
[2:04:26] Elohim one is a plural one based on
[2:04:30] abilities and attributes.
[2:04:33] But eh, Ekhad is a singular one.
[2:04:39] And the servant of the Lord wanted us to
[2:04:44] know
[2:04:45] as God was speaking in his heart, in his
[2:04:49] ear at times.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; He wanted us to know that the Lord our
[2:04:55] God is one
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; so that we wouldn't get confused.
[2:05:03] Denominational people will tell me
[2:05:05] sometime, "I don't know who to pray to.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Should I pray to the father? Should I
[2:05:11] pray to the son? Would it be wrong if I
[2:05:14] called on the holy ghost?"
[2:05:17] And I said, "Well, there's I know some
[2:05:20] people will stress a protocol.
[2:05:22] Uh, I'm going to stress some protocols,
[2:05:25] but I'm not going to tell you how you
[2:05:28] have to call because I'll tell you this,
[2:05:30] he'll come if your heart is fixed on
[2:05:34] him.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to call him in Hebrew.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; You don't have to call him in Greek.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to say his name.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; We should. It's good to. There's
[2:05:48] authority in the name. But once your
[2:05:51] heart has been regenerated in spirit,
[2:05:55] you're joined to the Lord.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; The New Testament said we are one
[2:06:01] spirit,
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; joined to him.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; So he knows what you need before you
[2:06:10] call. So if all you have time to say is
[2:06:13] help
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; and you didn't even give him a royal
[2:06:18] title,
[2:06:20] how many of you know you don't think it,
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; you know it.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; He would come.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Because it's not what you call him that
[2:06:31] makes him come.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; It's who you are that makes him come.
[2:06:37] If your spirit has been joined to the
[2:06:40] Lord, you're one spirit with him.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; I don't think you have to even utter. I
[2:06:46] do believe I I believe in praying and I
[2:06:48] I'm not a I'm not a meditational prayer
[2:06:51] person who prays it all inside. I don't
[2:06:54] have to say it out loud and I know you
[2:06:56] don't have to scream and I know you have
[2:06:57] to do a lot of things, but I uh was
[2:06:59] raised in the Pentecostal church where
[2:07:01] where we pounded the altar and thought
[2:07:04] that God was hard of hearing.
[2:07:06] So sometime I may get a little loud when
[2:07:09] I'm praying. It's not to get his
[2:07:11] attention
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; because he's as close
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; as a heart
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; a heart thought
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; of who he is.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; And he's bigger than anything you can
[2:07:25] imagine.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; He's bigger than anything I can imagine.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Just give me a few more moments here.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; He's bigger. He's so much bigger. And he
[2:07:35] said, "I want to join my spirit to that
[2:07:38] spirit that you came here with. You came
[2:07:40] here by the by the curse of the fall.
[2:07:43] You came here with a broken spirit, with
[2:07:46] an unregenerated spirit." Some of you
[2:07:49] would say soul uh because it's of that
[2:07:52] great tripartate controversy around the
[2:07:55] message people um of which it is. So
[2:07:58] again, don't worry about what I call it.
[2:08:01] Listen to where I'm placing it. And I'm
[2:08:03] placing the soul in the middle ground
[2:08:06] and the spirit on the inside of the
[2:08:08] inside. But if you need to be a purist
[2:08:13] and you're more dedicated to how it was
[2:08:16] called on a quote than how it was called
[2:08:18] in the scripture, that doesn't bother
[2:08:20] me.
[2:08:21] But don't miss the function
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; because that's that's big.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; The function of what this tripartate
[2:08:30] man, how it works together is big. And
[2:08:33] our spirit was fallen, broken because of
[2:08:36] the fall. But once you call on his name
[2:08:40] in repentance,
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; there is a life.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; He
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; comes.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; And when he comes in spirit,
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; he can't come in flesh or person to you
[2:08:56] and live in you.
[2:08:58] He comes in spirit and he goes right to
[2:09:01] that fallen spirit
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; and joins himself.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, how much he loves me that he would
[2:09:08] join himself to my fallen human inner
[2:09:11] man. But he knows that if he does, that
[2:09:15] spirit receives a birth. It receives a
[2:09:19] regeneration and it's no longer fallen.
[2:09:22] It's no longer broken. It's no longer
[2:09:25] adamic. It no longer is associated with
[2:09:28] the Eve or with the curse or with the
[2:09:30] deception or with original sin, but it
[2:09:34] is now joined as one unto the Lord.
[2:09:40] Come on.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; And he realizes as God knowing
[2:09:43] everything, now I have possession of
[2:09:47] what I paid for
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to move in this spirit,
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; my child, my son, my daughter will say,
[2:09:58] even though there's no gender in this,
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; God doesn't deliver a woman differently
[2:10:04] than he delivers a man.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; There's no gender in what we're talking
[2:10:08] about. neither male nor female. The
[2:10:11] scripture tells us clearly
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; that doesn't mean they're not
[2:10:14] differences of administrations and
[2:10:16] offices and jobs. But but but I'm
[2:10:18] telling you, a sister has every right,
[2:10:22] every need and every right to be one
[2:10:25] with him
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; and to hear him
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; and have him move
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; and direct.
[2:10:36] And then that middle ground, whatever
[2:10:38] you call it,
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; of mind, will, and emotion,
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; that's where the battle rages.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, in the soul,
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; the battle's raging
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; or in the spirit.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; If that's your middle ground, the mind
[2:10:53] and the will and the emotions, there's a
[2:10:56] war going on there.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us, "The greatest
[2:10:59] battle ever fought is fought in the
[2:11:00] mind." That's the middle ground.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; It's not the human brain.
[2:11:06] It's the ability to think and process.
[2:11:08] And that doesn't come to us in spirit.
[2:11:10] That comes to us in mind, will, and
[2:11:12] emotion. It comes to us in a soul realm.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; And that soul realm is where the war is.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; And as soon as you agree with the flesh,
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; the other side of who you are, this
[2:11:24] part,
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; as soon as you agree with the flesh,
[2:11:29] your mind and your will and your
[2:11:30] emotions will come into alignment with
[2:11:32] the atmosphere of this earth. And we
[2:11:35] have not been sent here to agree with
[2:11:37] what's around us.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; We're here to agree with the word.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody agree with the word with me.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; If it says it, I believe it.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; If God can do it for anybody, he can do
[2:11:50] it for me.
[2:11:52] If God ever did it one time,
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; he can do it again.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; He can do it again. He can do it again.
[2:12:01] That's who he is.
[2:12:04] That's who he is.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Whichever you feed,
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; your regenerated spirit that has been
[2:12:11] joined with the Lord is one. It doesn't
[2:12:13] feed on feeling.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't feed on a good song.
[2:12:20] It doesn't feed on that thrill that you
[2:12:24] have when you get on the scale
[2:12:29] and you see that you've come through
[2:12:30] camp meeting
[2:12:32] and didn't even gain a pound.
[2:12:38] Oh, he it it doesn't respond to that.
[2:12:41] That spirit part of who you are, soul if
[2:12:44] you like, responds only to the word.
[2:12:50] Depending on what you feed it,
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; this inner man, the all all the inside
[2:12:56] part of who I am, whatever you feed it
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; determines which part of you grows
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; and gets stronger. If you're feeding the
[2:13:04] word and you're feasting on the word,
[2:13:06] you're hearing the word, you're reading
[2:13:08] the word, you're confessing the word,
[2:13:11] you're declaring the word, you're
[2:13:13] prophesying the word,
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; that spirit man just rises up like a
[2:13:19] champion in you, joined to the Lord.
[2:13:25] But if you start feeding on the
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; and the gunk
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; and the junk,
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; that doesn't feed spirit man.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; That doesn't feed that that's been
[2:13:40] joined unto the Lord. It feeds that
[2:13:42] inner part of who we are, the mind, the
[2:13:44] will, and the emotions. And our emotions
[2:13:48] will control us if we feed that part of
[2:13:51] who we are more than we feed that inner
[2:13:54] part, the most inner part.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever you feed.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; And we learned years ago the analogy of
[2:14:02] the stickman and the sumo wrestler.
[2:14:05] And if uh if someone could look inside
[2:14:08] of you, one of your inner parts
[2:14:11] is going to be larger, stronger, bigger,
[2:14:15] bolder
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; than the other.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; I want my inner being, the part of me
[2:14:21] that's been regenerated and joined under
[2:14:23] the Lord as one. I want that to be the
[2:14:26] sumo wrestler.
[2:14:28] Because when the doctor says we can't
[2:14:30] help you,
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; I don't need emotion to kick in.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; And I don't need your sad story
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; about your cousin
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Matroid
[2:14:45] that had the same thing and didn't live
[2:14:47] a day. She dead before she got home.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Isn't that how people do you?
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to have surgery. You
[2:14:55] are. What kind of surgery you going to
[2:14:57] have? Oh, whatever. knee. Oh my. My
[2:15:01] neighbor had the knee surgery. They told
[2:15:04] her she'd be all right. She's She's not.
[2:15:06] She wasn't all right. Oh, I shouldn't be
[2:15:08] telling you that.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; And your emotions are
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; And and you start feeling that unbelief
[2:15:17] creep up.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; And and and you start say, "Oh, Lord of
[2:15:21] mercy, I don't know. Maybe I should just
[2:15:22] hobble the rest of my life."
[2:15:25] And that happens because you've been
[2:15:27] feeding the mind and the will and the
[2:15:28] emotion more.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; You've been entertaining that part of
[2:15:33] who you are more than you've been
[2:15:36] engaging the God part of who you are.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; There's a part of God in you.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Have you had a new birth?
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Has his spirit joined with yours and
[2:15:45] regenerated it and resurrected it and
[2:15:48] revived it and resuscitated and made it
[2:15:51] new?
[2:15:52] Yes,
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham told us he said this is
[2:15:55] not a soul replacement
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; or spirit replacement.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; He said that that kind of thing is a
[2:16:05] Mormon doctrine.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; He said this is a a a a transformation,
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; a change
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; that takes place on the inside of the
[2:16:17] inside. And I want to tell you
[2:16:18] something. There's only one force that I
[2:16:20] know of that can make that difference in
[2:16:22] you, and it's the anointing.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's not a feeling.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; He's almighty God.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; He is a person because that almighty God
[2:16:35] came in the form of our Lord Jesus
[2:16:38] Christ
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; who is the only person of the Godhead.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; The rest are attributes of the same
[2:16:45] spirit,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; the same God.
[2:16:48] Oh yes. And if you don't get that right,
[2:16:53] if you don't get that right, you'll
[2:16:55] still be referring to the anointing as
[2:16:57] an it and a feeling. And what we're
[2:16:59] about to face on these closing hours of
[2:17:02] planet Earth, you won't know what to do
[2:17:04] with because you won't even know who you
[2:17:06] are.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; You won't know what you are.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; If I don't know what I am, I don't know
[2:17:13] what I have to fight with.
[2:17:17] If I don't know who I am, I don't know
[2:17:19] whose I am.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; It's not because of who I am. It's
[2:17:24] because of who's.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a possession bought, paid for,
[2:17:30] purchased
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; by an incorruptible price.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted to make sure that we didn't
[2:17:40] miss the schma in Deuteronomy. And so he
[2:17:44] quotes right from it in 12 Mark 12:29.
[2:17:46] Jesus answered him, "The first of all
[2:17:48] the commandments is what?
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Schma,
[2:17:56] listen up.
[2:17:59] Stop what you're doing. Finish your
[2:18:01] religious duty
[2:18:04] so that you can hear my voice.
[2:18:13] I I never hear the voice,
[2:18:16] brother Shel. I never hear the voice.
[2:18:20] Not the loud audible voice. Not the
[2:18:23] inner quiet whisper voice.
[2:18:26] I I I I never hear his voice.
[2:18:30] What should I do?
[2:18:33] Do you want the sanitized version of
[2:18:36] what you should do?
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Or do you want the Shelly version
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; without cussing? Of course,
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how to hear his voice.
[2:18:48] Shut up.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Shut up.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; We think that prayer is telling God
[2:18:58] everything he already knows.
[2:19:01] And sometimes prayer is not telling God
[2:19:03] anything at all
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; except I adore you. I love you. I I
[2:19:09] you're everything to me.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; How is that prayer? It's prayer.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; And if you need to hear his voice, shut
[2:19:19] up.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Don't belly ache. Don't complain. Don't
[2:19:23] tell God everything you already know.
[2:19:25] Nobody know. Jesus, you couldn't
[2:19:27] possibly know.
[2:19:29] Oh God, you could never know what it's
[2:19:31] like to live my life.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, but he can and he does.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; He was the high priest who is touched by
[2:19:40] the feelings of our infirmities because
[2:19:43] he became us.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; God became man so that man can become
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; one with him.
[2:20:00] one with him.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; You see, if the reason why I know that
[2:20:06] God is one and not three or four or five
[2:20:08] or six or 10 or a dozen, the reason why
[2:20:11] I know is everything about God is a
[2:20:14] model
[2:20:15] for who you should be.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, that sounds far out
[2:20:19] there." Well, no. It's all part of the
[2:20:21] bridal paradigm.
[2:20:24] And the bridal paradigm is not to have
[2:20:26] two persons
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; getting along with one another.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; That's a trinitarian concept.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; It's unbiblical and it hardly works.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; You you you you know that's the 50/50
[2:20:46] thing.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; You know, if you want to have a good
[2:20:49] marriage, you you got to know it's
[2:20:50] 50/50. If there's anybody in here
[2:20:52] believes that you're engaged,
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; you're not married.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; I heard an amen there. Recognize the
[2:21:06] voice.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; It's true for all of us. It's 100%
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; and 100%.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Does that make 200%?"
[2:21:17] No, it makes 100%.
[2:21:20] God's mathematics are not like ours.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; If a man gives 100% and a woman gives
[2:21:26] 100%, they're 100% operating together.
[2:21:32] And in order to do that, they're
[2:21:33] hearing, they're listening, they're
[2:21:34] sensing who who who leads us, who
[2:21:37] directs us instead of arguing about
[2:21:40] who's the head and who's the neck
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; and who's the stronger and who's the
[2:21:44] weaker
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; and who's usurping and who's dominating.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Become one.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Both of you fall in love with Jesus.
[2:21:58] Hear him.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Hear him.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody said that just wouldn't be
[2:22:06] possible with my companion.
[2:22:14] Maybe you should be one of the singles
[2:22:15] among us because maybe you weren't
[2:22:18] waiting as long as you should wait.
[2:22:19] Maybe you weren't hearing as much as you
[2:22:21] should hear.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; And I know that some of you have to get
[2:22:25] you have to get by. the best way you can
[2:22:28] get by. But you ought to be a voice
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; if it doesn't cost you a divorce. You
[2:22:35] ought to be a voice to a young man who
[2:22:38] hasn't chosen his life companion yet.
[2:22:41] And you ought to be a voice. Listen how
[2:22:42] quiet it'll get.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; You ought to be a voice to a young
[2:22:46] sister who hadn't had a husband yet and
[2:22:48] who thinks that she is an old maid at
[2:22:50] 23. Yeah.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Where do you get such a stupid idea as
[2:22:55] that? Probably in front of that idiot
[2:22:58] box.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the one sits
[2:23:03] in the corner.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the one we toad around
[2:23:08] with us wherever we go. Society says,
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; society says, social media says,
[2:23:15] influencers say,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; you better wait. You better wait until
[2:23:21] you know that you know that you know
[2:23:23] that you have found somebody
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; who's not going to waste the first years
[2:23:29] of their marriage with you fighting over
[2:23:32] who's the boss.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; I I've heard them draw the boundary
[2:23:36] lines.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; I've heard them say, "Now, anything past
[2:23:40] this line, you run. That's the kitchen.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; The rest of the house, I'm the boss.
[2:23:51] What if she told you to come into her
[2:23:52] domain and wash the dishes?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I thought. You didn't
[2:23:57] make her the boss over there, did you?
[2:23:59] You just wanted to make her feel like
[2:24:01] she had something.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Anybody follow me? Why are you even
[2:24:05] saying this? Because to be joined as one
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; means that each is preferring the other.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Is it always easy? No.
[2:24:17] Is it always done? No. But it's the
[2:24:20] goal. And the reason why it's the goal
[2:24:22] is so that you and I can learn to lay
[2:24:24] our will down
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; in oneness,
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; in union,
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; in union
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; with Christ
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; with the anointing
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; with the anointed one.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Is it getting late yet?
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Well, it is.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Well, I mean, it doesn't change
[2:24:46] the fact that it is.
[2:24:54] I want you to get something here. Jesus,
[2:24:57] he finished it out. The first of all the
[2:24:59] commandments here, O Israel, the Lord
[2:25:00] our God, this anointing, this Christ,
[2:25:04] this God manifested. He doesn't have a
[2:25:07] beginning.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; He will never have an ending.
[2:25:13] He always is because he always was.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; And he always will be.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; And he's not just the I was.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Or the I will be.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; In most every situation, he is the I am.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; He is Jehovah.
[2:25:40] Rafa
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; your healer.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; He is the God who can do for you.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; What you can never do for yourself.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; He's not just El Shai, the one who can
[2:25:56] feed you from his breast,
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; plural.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; He is the God who can do for you.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; The God of ultimate ruin.
[2:26:08] Yes.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What in the world does
[2:26:10] that even mean?" The God of ultimate
[2:26:12] ruin and destruction. It means nothing
[2:26:15] can stand in his way when he determines
[2:26:19] to move.
[2:26:22] I want you to know now, God is
[2:26:24] determined to move in this bride.
[2:26:29] In these last days,
[2:26:32] she will not fizzle out.
[2:26:37] The church may fizzle.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; The charismaniacs may fizzle.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; The denominationalist
[2:26:48] may fizzle.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; But there will be a bride
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; over the face of the earth.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Some of them never get to a church
[2:26:57] building.
[2:27:01] But they've got to the one whose name
[2:27:04] was supposed to be over the door.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; This bridal paradigm is not necessarily
[2:27:11] about perfect attendance in all
[2:27:13] situations.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; It's about relationship and it's about
[2:27:17] covenant. And the one thing about
[2:27:19] relationship is if it's good, you want
[2:27:21] more.
[2:27:24] The more you experience him in
[2:27:27] relationship,
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; the more you will want to
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; I don't just mean feel him with the
[2:27:34] flesh. Feel him on the inside, sense
[2:27:37] him, know him, discern him, discover him
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; on the inside.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; And then you just want to sit.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:27:49] and listen.
[2:27:51] Oh God, my children, my children. Oh
[2:27:54] God, my husband, my husband. Oh God, my
[2:27:58] knee, my knee. Oh God,
[2:28:03] he's not Santa Claus.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; He's not the Easter Bunny.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; He's not the doting grandfather.
[2:28:18] He wants more than your list.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; He wants the fullness of your heart.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; He wants to know that he cannot just be
[2:28:28] with you, but he can be in you.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; And not only in you, but one with you.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; There is an invisible union.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; There is an invisible union. And the
[2:28:41] heavenly bridegroom
[2:28:43] desires to be one.
[2:28:47] with a heavenly bride.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Well, the title is an earthly bride.
[2:28:52] That's exactly right. We're living in
[2:28:54] that sphere now. We're living in the
[2:28:56] earth realm now. We've definitely had
[2:28:59] the earth birth now.
[2:29:01] But the reality is that's not the union
[2:29:03] that he's looking for because he no
[2:29:05] longer desires to to be one with this
[2:29:08] planet.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; This planet is going to go
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; according to the word. This planet is
[2:29:16] going to melt with a fervent heat.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Isn't this a beautiful
[2:29:20] country?" Yes, but it's going to burn.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Don't you love Europe and the Alps? Oh
[2:29:28] my. Yes. Norway and the fjords.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; Don't you just love the the fire in
[2:29:36] Iceland and the ice in Greenland?
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; All of it.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Sure. But it's going to melt with a
[2:29:43] fervent heat.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Because it's not with this planet that
[2:29:47] he desires to become one.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; It's with a bride that has been
[2:29:53] transfigured.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; She was once a part of this earth and
[2:30:00] its system
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; ashes to ashes and dust to dust. But her
[2:30:05] real identity is hidden for now.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; But she didn't come from earth.
[2:30:13] Uhoh.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; There's the biggest part of who she is
[2:30:19] that had nothing to do with planet Earth
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; because the gene representation of God
[2:30:27] was in that little bride
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; before the world was founded
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; and framed.
[2:30:39] This is not extreme Calvinism
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; that says God lined everybody up against
[2:30:45] a wall and he said, "You're
[2:30:49] savable. You're not savable. You're
[2:30:51] savable. You're not savable." That's a
[2:30:53] heresy that they like to teach around
[2:30:55] the message.
[2:31:00] You you you should have stayed with what
[2:31:02] he said
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; and off of Google
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; because if he said it and it goes back
[2:31:10] to the word, you can stand on it.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; But Calvin had some problems
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; and Armenianism had some problems.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; And that's why we needed a balance.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Predestination is real. It's right.
[2:31:25] Don't you let your denominational tell
[2:31:27] your church tell you there's nothing to
[2:31:29] to predestination.
[2:31:31] The Bible said so.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; We don't have time to preach it. I I
[2:31:38] think I've preached enough of that for
[2:31:40] the last 50 years just about.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; But um it's fornowledge.
[2:31:49] And the reason why God could know who
[2:31:52] would
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; and who would not
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; have eternal life
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; is because he could see in his
[2:32:00] fornowledge
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; your choice.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll get it right from the
[2:32:08] beginning and I'll help them get it
[2:32:09] right from the beginning." And those
[2:32:11] that would choose, those that would say
[2:32:13] yes, those that would accept him, he
[2:32:17] said, "I'll give them a prefix destiny."
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; He rigged it
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; because of me, because of you. Somebody
[2:32:28] say, "I don't like that kind of
[2:32:29] preaching." I didn't uh we didn't take a
[2:32:31] poll
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; of what kind of preaching you liked. I'm
[2:32:35] just thankful to have enough voice to
[2:32:36] preach a little bit.
[2:32:39] But if he knew you were going to say
[2:32:41] yes,
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; he said, "I might as well pack them with
[2:32:44] something,
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; there won't be no way they can lose
[2:32:51] [Music]
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; because I've heard they're eternal."
[2:32:54] That yes,
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; you don't remember it.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; It was in the mind of God. It was in the
[2:33:02] knowledge of God. It was in the
[2:33:04] omniscience, the fornowledge of God. But
[2:33:06] when he saw your big old yes,
[2:33:09] somebody said, "I said yes in an
[2:33:11] oldfashioned order." I'm glad you did.
[2:33:13] But that's not the yes that slid you in.
[2:33:17] The yes that slid you in is the one you
[2:33:19] made in the mind of God before the
[2:33:21] foundation of the world was laid.
[2:33:25] And God said, "Because of that yes,
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put a part of who I am.
[2:33:34] That's right.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; A a a a sliver of my DNA.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't believe that.
[2:33:42] Don't care
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; whether you believe that or not.
[2:33:47] I believe it." And that's the reason why
[2:33:49] the devil says, "Give up. Quit. Nobody
[2:33:51] likes you. Everybody hates you. You
[2:33:52] might as well eat worms." When the devil
[2:33:55] tells you all that, that's why I've been
[2:33:56] able to tell him all these years,
[2:33:58] "You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a
[2:34:01] liar. And I'm not looking for the favor
[2:34:03] of man anyway. I'm looking for the favor
[2:34:06] of God who placed a part of who he is
[2:34:12] [Applause]
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; in me.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; It's a balance.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; God didn't force you.
[2:34:31] He allowed you.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; There's a lot to that that we can't
[2:34:38] preach about tonight.
[2:34:41] But sometime when you're complaining
[2:34:45] about the hardness of your way,
[2:34:48] come see me.
[2:34:52] And I'll remind you that in the mind of
[2:34:54] God,
[2:34:56] when you are making that yes,
[2:35:00] Your destiny was playing
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; and you weren't just saying yes. I'm so
[2:35:07] sorry to tell you. You weren't just
[2:35:09] saying yes to the good times.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; You were agreeing, oh Lord, every
[2:35:21] heartache,
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; every wrong turn in the road, sir,
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; every betrayal.
[2:35:29] As your destiny from the mind of God was
[2:35:31] rolling past and you said yes to God,
[2:35:35] when you said yes to God, in his mind,
[2:35:37] he saw it before it ever happened.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; And because of that, he was able to give
[2:35:42] you a destiny.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; And in that destiny, there will be
[2:35:46] strength
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; to get through every hard time,
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; every wound, every hurt,
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; every battle.
[2:35:59] I want you to know tonight as we close
[2:36:01] in a minute or two,
[2:36:04] Jesus didn't hurt you.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; It was church. It was people. You know
[2:36:11] why church is so hurtful
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; cuz there's people there.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; And people are hurtful. But they have
[2:36:22] they've been hurt
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; and they bleed
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; and they'll bleed on you.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; Hurt people hurt people.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; But everything you need to keep bringing
[2:36:38] your mind, your spirit, your emotion,
[2:36:41] your will back to the center of God's
[2:36:44] plan for your life. Everything you need,
[2:36:46] everything to equip you.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you ever said
[2:36:51] something like like I don't know if you
[2:36:53] ever said this, Sister Pam, or not, but
[2:36:55] I I think most any wife would
[2:36:58] walking through the things you've walked
[2:37:00] through, there must have been a moment
[2:37:02] that you thought, I can't make it
[2:37:04] without Garvis.
[2:37:07] I I I couldn't live without him.
[2:37:10] And you were right in the sense that
[2:37:12] life will never be the same down here
[2:37:15] without him. But you were not right. If
[2:37:18] you ever thought that you were never you
[2:37:20] weren't right then when you said I
[2:37:24] couldn't make it without him. You were
[2:37:26] so wrong.
[2:37:28] And God knew that when you lay up there
[2:37:30] in that intensive care unit on a
[2:37:32] ventilator for how long? How long?
[2:37:36] Five weeks. A machine breathing for her.
[2:37:43] and what she needed to get through that
[2:37:46] wasn't outside. You know, our prayers, I
[2:37:48] hope I hope our prayers, I hope our
[2:37:50] faith and everybody who loved her, I
[2:37:53] hope it made a difference. I believe
[2:37:54] that it made a difference. But the
[2:37:56] reality is that everything she needed in
[2:37:59] that darkest moment of COVID
[2:38:02] and everything she needs in the darkest
[2:38:05] moment and I could come right here.
[2:38:06] Here's here's this mama who has buried
[2:38:09] both children.
[2:38:13] We could go right back to Sister West.
[2:38:16] We could go all over this building. And
[2:38:18] then that moment when you think you
[2:38:20] can't do it, you must remember that
[2:38:23] before you ever landed on the planet.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Somebody said, "I just don't
[2:38:30] believe it like that." Then you don't
[2:38:31] don't dare use the word sovereign.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; Don't dare try to tell me God is
[2:38:36] sovereign
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; and then take his sovereignty.
[2:38:40] Don't preach to me about a devil that's
[2:38:42] more powerful than the God that I've
[2:38:44] committed my life to.
[2:38:47] Don't tell me the enemy is more
[2:38:49] powerful.
[2:38:52] And don't tell me that earth hangs in
[2:38:54] the balance depending on whether the
[2:38:57] church prays. Don't tell me that
[2:39:01] it it sounds right, but it's not
[2:39:04] biblically correct.
[2:39:07] God has the ability whether I pray or
[2:39:10] not pray.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; He is sovereign
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; and he knows exactly where where America
[2:39:18] is headed.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; And and as she's going down,
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; as she's going down, there's going to be
[2:39:28] some of the DNA of God.
[2:39:37] those anointed people.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Those messiahs,
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; those anointeds
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; who gather under his anointing,
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; they're going up.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; Uh the earth is going down and the
[2:39:57] society is going down and religion is
[2:39:59] going down and even the church as we
[2:40:02] have known it. And that makes some
[2:40:05] people so mad. Somebody said, "You
[2:40:07] shouldn't talk about his church." He
[2:40:08] loves his church. He does. He loves his
[2:40:11] church so much. He gave his life for
[2:40:12] her.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; And he would do it all over again. If it
[2:40:15] would, if it would make any difference,
[2:40:17] he would do it all over again. But he
[2:40:19] doesn't have to
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; because what he did, he did right.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; He was looking for a people
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; who could hear him.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. who could say what he says
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; and do what he tells them to do
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; and finish this thing.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; And then he's taking his DNA out of
[2:40:43] here.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; He's going to finish his covenant with
[2:40:49] the Jewish people.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; He said he would.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; He's going to give us glorious times on
[2:40:56] the other side. But the earth as we know
[2:40:59] it is not ever going to look like this
[2:41:00] again.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know how we Oh,
[2:41:05] because there's a new heaven and a new
[2:41:06] earth out there waiting for God's people
[2:41:09] one of these days."
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; And please don't be the buffoon who
[2:41:14] says, "Uh, how do we know it won't ever
[2:41:16] happen again?"
[2:41:22] Don't be him.
[2:41:24] We know it because of three words.
[2:41:30] You You don't have to hear but three
[2:41:31] words in the Bible.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; To know that we won't have to go back
[2:41:40] and have Adam and Eve doing it again.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; And we won't. In fact, he gets loosed
[2:41:48] after a thousand years of tumbling in a
[2:41:50] bottomless pit. That old serpent, that
[2:41:53] dragon, that slimy devil, he gets one
[2:41:56] more shot at the nations.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; Read the book.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; But rather unsuccessful.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; God brings it to an end.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; And he is no more.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; Because hell and everything that's with
[2:42:16] it is going to be uh utterly
[2:42:23] I know the church makes
[2:42:26] everything eternal.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; But the Bible's clear.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; The soul that sinnth dies.
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know when. I don't know how
[2:42:36] long. Maybe 10 billion world 10 billion
[2:42:39] years if there was such a thing on the
[2:42:41] other side of eternity. I don't know.
[2:42:44] But the reality is it's never going to
[2:42:45] happen again. It's never going to happen
[2:42:47] again. It's never going to happen again.
[2:42:49] Just like God said, "I'll never destroy
[2:42:51] the earth by water again." He won't.
[2:42:54] It'll be fire next time. How do you
[2:42:56] know? Cuz God said so.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; How do we know it'll ever happen again?
[2:43:00] And the n everybody will be deceived
[2:43:01] again and there'll be another need for
[2:43:03] sacrifice again.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Three words. You don't have to be a
[2:43:07] theologian to find them.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; It
[2:43:11] is
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; finished.
[2:43:17] Not just salvation, the entire
[2:43:20] redemption of the purposes of God were
[2:43:24] signed, sealed, and delivered.
[2:43:27] [Applause]
[2:43:30] But he screamed
[2:43:35] micians.
[2:43:37] I I mean musicians
[2:43:43] cuz to play for some people they have to
[2:43:45] be a little of both.
[2:43:50] I haven't even preached
[2:43:54] but I want to. But I better go.
[2:43:59] Let me say a few more things. Don't
[2:44:01] leave you hanging because I may never
[2:44:03] see some of you again as long as I live.
[2:44:07] Uh I thought maybe after last night I
[2:44:09] wouldn't see some of you again,
[2:44:13] but my last memory of you would have
[2:44:15] been a very good one.
[2:44:17] Thank you for coming
[2:44:20] and being a part of the banquet last
[2:44:21] night.
[2:44:23] And I will tell you this, the the half
[2:44:25] of the story
[2:44:28] was not told
[2:44:30] because we couldn't tell it.
[2:44:33] 50 years.
[2:44:36] My poor little Mariah,
[2:44:40] she had to take all those pictures that
[2:44:42] I sent her, scans of scans,
[2:44:46] and crop them to where they could be
[2:44:49] sent off. And I thought as blurry as
[2:44:52] they were when they went, we didn't pay
[2:44:53] to have them restored. We just had to
[2:44:55] pay to have them printed. And I'm
[2:44:57] telling you, technology is amazing. They
[2:45:00] not only printed them, they cleared them
[2:45:03] pennies
[2:45:05] for what you would think it would have
[2:45:06] cost.
[2:45:07] And those memories, oh my goodness,
[2:45:12] those memories
[2:45:14] to me, they're not just people.
[2:45:17] They represent healings
[2:45:19] and miracles
[2:45:23] and the word broken
[2:45:26] before us
[2:45:30] battles. And
[2:45:33] somebody said, "You you even put people
[2:45:35] up here that left the church in a huff."
[2:45:41] I don't know if I'd have put somebody up
[2:45:43] that left the church in a huff. Why not?
[2:45:46] They were a part of our story
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; and I love them now and they loved me
[2:45:54] then.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; So I put a picture up of when they loved
[2:45:58] me.
[2:46:00] Ain't that sneaky?
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to remember the rest.
[2:46:04] What does it matter?
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; That was just a part of my yes.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Part of my yes.
[2:46:14] That son-in-law that you don't get along
[2:46:16] with.
[2:46:19] That mother-in-law that you can't hardly
[2:46:22] bear.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Party or yes.
[2:46:32] He either sees it or all or he doesn't
[2:46:33] see anything.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; It helps me to know that it's not having
[2:46:40] the best doctor.
[2:46:44] or the best hospital
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; or the best chemo.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; It's having the best creator
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; and having his perfect and sovereign
[2:46:55] will
[2:46:57] &gt;&gt; activated in your life.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; Does prayer change things? It certainly
[2:47:01] does.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; But we don't pray to change the mind of
[2:47:05] God.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; That's new age.
[2:47:09] We pray to have grace
[2:47:13] to to accept
[2:47:16] the will of God even in those times that
[2:47:21] it didn't turn out the way we wanted it
[2:47:23] to turn out.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; Can I say this, brother Chris? You you
[2:47:29] won't be offended if I talk to Anita
[2:47:32] like this. I hope.
[2:47:36] Did you see those pictures, sister
[2:47:37] Anita, of you and brother Steve and and
[2:47:41] better days and some weaker days.
[2:47:47] And I want you to know that if prayer
[2:47:51] and fasting
[2:47:53] and sacrifice
[2:47:55] and giving and others others those who
[2:47:59] did it with you
[2:48:03] and mama who did it with you who prayed
[2:48:06] if that would have changed the mind of
[2:48:08] God if that could have turned things
[2:48:11] around
[2:48:14] you wouldn't be on that organ tonight.
[2:48:19] and I love you,
[2:48:23] but it'd be red hair, not red head.
[2:48:29] You know, I love you.
[2:48:37] But God said after all the battle,
[2:48:41] you precious church people who pray
[2:48:44] after all the battle.
[2:48:47] I I wonder if God may may have even Oh,
[2:48:50] I'd love to I'd love to do that for
[2:48:52] them.
[2:48:57] He loves us.
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; He cares about what we care about.
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; And I believe when we hurt, he hurts.
[2:49:07] And it must hurt him even more to know
[2:49:09] that with one blink, one one word, it
[2:49:12] could all be different.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; But there is a plan.
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; And that plan is to bring you to your
[2:49:23] full union.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; We may lose more by the way of the
[2:49:30] grave, but the reality is they're going
[2:49:33] ahead of us.
[2:49:36] But they're not going to get all the way
[2:49:37] without us.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us they're resting.
[2:49:43] Now
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; to be absent from the body is to be
[2:49:47] present with the Lord. But they've not
[2:49:50] seen King Jesus.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; Not according to that word.
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; They're in his presence. It must be
[2:49:57] wonderful.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; But they without us
[2:50:05] And the dead in Christ
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; shall rise first,
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; and we which are alive and remain.
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; Did you know there are people in this
[2:50:17] room
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; that part of their overcoming
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; is not only going to be overcoming in
[2:50:26] the spirit, but they're going to
[2:50:28] overcome the last enemy? Amen.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Did you know I believe that there are
[2:50:34] people in this room that will never
[2:50:36] taste the sting of natural death?
[2:50:39] They'll never know what it feels like to
[2:50:42] go that way. Because I believe there are
[2:50:45] people in this room that are being
[2:50:48] prepared
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; for a resurrection
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; for a rapture translation
[2:50:57] [Applause]
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; to overcome even that last enemy.
[2:51:08] And they're waiting on us.
[2:51:10] &gt;&gt; And they're pulling for us.
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; And they're reminding God.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't Don't forget them.
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; I know you never will, but don't forget
[2:51:21] them. I had to leave. I had to leave. I
[2:51:23] had to leave. But don't you dare forget
[2:51:25] them. Move for them.
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; Scripture says,
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; "Are we not compassed about with such a
[2:51:34] great cloud of witnesses?
[2:51:37] And are they not also cheering us on
[2:51:39] from balconies beyond?
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; You can.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; You can.
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; You must.
[2:51:48] &gt;&gt; You will.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; Revelation 18:48. Let's see. We've been
[2:51:54] here since 6 7 8.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Are we in hour five yet?
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; I've got to stop
[2:52:05] in a bit.
[2:52:07] Revelation 1 verse 5 and 6. And from
[2:52:10] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[2:52:14] and the first begotten.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know why
[2:52:23] I don't have to be angry with God
[2:52:27] that I've had loved ones
[2:52:30] go by the way of the grave?
[2:52:34] Because I know the one
[2:52:37] who foreran the way.
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; He chose
[2:52:46] to give his life
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; to die the death
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; to to to not allow death to defeat to be
[2:52:55] the first fruits of them that slept
[2:52:58] the first fruits of those who
[2:53:00] experienced death. He chose that for me
[2:53:03] to give me peace
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; when I had to say goodbye to my mama.
[2:53:09] You saw her in the film
[2:53:12] last night.
[2:53:14] I didn't have to worry about never
[2:53:15] seeing her again
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; because I know the one who made the way.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; I know the one that did that just for me
[2:53:22] and did that just for you to help us to
[2:53:25] know that the way has already been ran
[2:53:27] for us.
[2:53:29] And even as one has become the first
[2:53:31] fruits
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; by reason of first fruits, there's
[2:53:36] another harvest behind it.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; First fruits are those that got ripe.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; There's other seed going to get ripe.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; So if one goes that way and rises, it
[2:53:50] gives us the promise
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; that every other believer
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; who goes that way with eternal life.
[2:54:00] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[2:54:03] unto him that loved us. Oh, we better
[2:54:05] read it again. And from Jesus Christ,
[2:54:07] who is the faithful witness, the first
[2:54:09] begotten of the dead, and the prince of
[2:54:10] the kings of the earth unto him that
[2:54:12] loved us. Somebody say,
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; loved us.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; Washed us
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; from our
[2:54:23] &gt;&gt; in the bleach of his own blood.
[2:54:29] Not Mary's blood,
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; not Joseph's blood.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; Blood like had never been represented on
[2:54:37] the earth.
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; Not animal blood.
[2:54:45] Because there was no soul life in that
[2:54:49] bleeding animal, bleeding animal,
[2:54:52] but blood specifically created
[2:54:56] by the creator with the life, with the
[2:55:00] DNA,
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; with the anointing
[2:55:06] in its molecules
[2:55:10] specifically designed
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; for the redemption
[2:55:15] of the fallen sons
[2:55:18] of Adam.
[2:55:22] The son of God became a son of man
[2:55:27] so that we the fallen sons of men
[2:55:31] might become the sons of God
[2:55:35] &gt;&gt; and beyond.
[2:55:39] one
[2:55:40] ehad
[2:55:42] with him.
[2:55:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Wouldn't that be an
[2:55:45] Elohim?" Multiple personalities,
[2:55:48] multiple attributes, multi. No.
[2:55:53] It's a nead
[2:55:55] one with him. Singular
[2:56:00] meaning the same spirit life.
[2:56:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know if that'll
[2:56:07] preach through the book." I tell you it
[2:56:09] will and it will preach through the
[2:56:11] gospel. Do you remember those gospels?
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; You Daniel lovers, you Revelation
[2:56:17] lovers, did you all remember that
[2:56:19] there's a Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; Did you remember there's a lot of red
[2:56:24] letters and words in those four gospels?
[2:56:28] And did you hear him when he said
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; you've been looking for him all along
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; and I was right here with you all along
[2:56:40] &gt;&gt; and you didn't know he was here.
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; Did you not hear him when he said when
[2:56:46] you've seen me
[2:56:53] &gt;&gt; you've seen him? Yeah.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; And from Jesus Christ, who is a faithful
[2:56:59] witness to the first begotten of the
[2:57:00] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[2:57:01] earth. Unto him that loved us and washed
[2:57:03] us from our sins in his own blood.
[2:57:08] &gt;&gt; Own blood
[2:57:10] and hath made us.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; Oh no. Anything I've said tonight that's
[2:57:16] already been said, I didn't just took
[2:57:18] it.
[2:57:19] It's been here.
[2:57:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe was on it. Brother Gley was
[2:57:23] on it. Brother Dwayne was on it
[2:57:27] because
[2:57:29] God had a plan in the meeting.
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; He wanted to tie it all together. Made
[2:57:33] us kings and priests. Made us
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; us.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; Kings and priests unto God and his
[2:57:41] father. To him be glory and dominion
[2:57:44] forever and ever. Amen.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And here's a key for you to take
[2:57:50] home.
[2:57:52] And I'll I'll finish tomorrow if I have
[2:57:54] the voice.
[2:57:55] Revelation 3:14. If I don't, Brother
[2:57:58] Dwayne will if he's here.
[2:58:01] No. Yes.
[2:58:15] Well, if you was responsible for some of
[2:58:18] this tonight, please pray for me
[2:58:23] cuz my voice has
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; certainly different than it was when I
[2:58:28] started.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; I thought the more you wore it out, the
[2:58:30] weaker it would supposed to get. But
[2:58:32] your faith,
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; you've got so much power.
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; You've got so much authority.
[2:58:41] There's creative life in your mouth.
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; The creative spoken word of God that
[2:58:48] some of these folks talk about one of
[2:58:50] these glorious days when God restores
[2:58:53] the spoken word. Amazing. That happened
[2:58:56] a generation ago.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:59] &gt;&gt; Where is yours?
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; Where is mine?
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; It's in us.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; It's in us. He's working on our
[2:59:09] character.
[2:59:10] Because you can't use this power against
[2:59:13] your enemies.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; You've got to bless them that bless you.
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; And you've got to bless them that curse
[2:59:19] you.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; And if you recognize, if I recognize
[2:59:25] sometimes what we have,
[2:59:30] &gt;&gt; there might not be a Pelosi.
[2:59:39] And if it worked everywhere,
[2:59:42] there wouldn't be a President Trump.
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; But God didn't put this in our mouth to
[2:59:47] use it for politics
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; or for personal agendas.
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; He used it against principalities. He
[2:59:55] gave it to us to have authority over
[2:59:57] principalities and powers and spiritual
[2:59:59] wickedness and high places and all that
[3:00:02] ugly stuff includes the big sea.
[3:00:08] And if I live long enough to bury more
[3:00:10] saints with it, I want you to know, I'll
[3:00:12] remind you then and I'll remind you now.
[3:00:15] It's not because he's lost his power.
[3:00:18] It's not because he doesn't still heal.
[3:00:21] He's still a healer.
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; Our yes can get mighty hard on us
[3:00:29] sometime. Revelation 3:14. under the
[3:00:32] angel of the church of the leadyans.
[3:00:34] Write these things saith.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; How many of you are ready for the last
[3:00:41] amen on this sermon?
[3:00:44] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[3:00:48] That is he is the last amen.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; He gets the last. So be it.
[3:00:55] &gt;&gt; But he's not only the last amen.
[3:00:58] He's not only the ending,
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; the omega,
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; the tav,
[3:01:05] he's also the beginning,
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; the alpha.
[3:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:15] &gt;&gt; The faithful and the true witness.
[3:01:18] And here's what some people miss. He is
[3:01:21] the beginning
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; of the creation of God
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; in the message why it had to be
[3:01:37] shepherds
[3:01:41] in that city that you've got to love
[3:01:44] and sometimes you feel a little hate
[3:01:46] too.
[3:01:49] Tucson.
[3:01:54] I love being in Tucson.
[3:01:58] I love the people of Tucson.
[3:02:02] First time I went, I thought I could
[3:02:03] never like those saros.
[3:02:08] I could never like that landscape. I
[3:02:10] like pine trees. But it grows on you.
[3:02:14] And there's something kind of spiritual
[3:02:16] and
[3:02:18] and kind of amazing to me
[3:02:21] about that Sonora desert,
[3:02:28] but it's such a religious city.
[3:02:33] Can't name very many now that wouldn't
[3:02:34] be included.
[3:02:39] Brother Brandham talked about some of
[3:02:40] it,
[3:02:42] but it was in Tucson that he said this
[3:02:44] powerful statement. He had started
[3:02:49] a new creation.
[3:02:53] What? What? What was he talking about?
[3:02:55] The beginning of the creation of God.
[3:02:58] The beginning of the creation of God. He
[3:03:00] had started a new creation. What was it?
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; A creation of himself.
[3:03:07] Somebody said, "Oh, that sounds like a
[3:03:08] hillbilly to me." Oh, does it?
[3:03:15] It sounds like a prophetic mystic
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; who knew the mind of God
[3:03:22] &gt;&gt; who could take the most complicated
[3:03:25] thing
[3:03:26] and say it so simple that somebody like
[3:03:30] me could get it.
[3:03:34] And the next one
[3:03:37] I don't get it at all.
[3:03:40] It's it's a mystery until it's not.
[3:03:45] Some see, some can't see. It doesn't
[3:03:47] mean that they're not good or wonderful
[3:03:50] people.
[3:03:51] Some people
[3:03:53] uh would hear the meetings, hear Brother
[3:03:56] Brandham preach, and
[3:03:58] two men went together. You've heard the
[3:04:00] story.
[3:04:02] One was so mightily impressed
[3:04:05] he said uh on the way out the door to
[3:04:07] his neighbor who went with him. I've
[3:04:10] never heard anything like that. Nor were
[3:04:12] you Renee? You were No. No. Of course.
[3:04:17] Sister West was.
[3:04:20] Is there Alfreda? Is there anybody else
[3:04:22] in here that was in a meeting of brother
[3:04:24] Brandham?
[3:04:27] You were.
[3:04:29] How old would you have been? You I won't
[3:04:32] try to figure your age. Eight.
[3:04:39] One man went out the door and he said,
[3:04:41] "I've never heard anything like that in
[3:04:43] all my life. That's the most wonderful
[3:04:44] thing I've ever heard."
[3:04:47] One man went out and said, "I've never
[3:04:49] heard anything like that in my life." I
[3:04:51] couldn't stand that.
[3:04:53] That man called me a buzzard.
[3:04:58] Yes, sir.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; The other fella said, "Oh, there's a
[3:05:02] difference. He called me an eagle."
[3:05:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't call either one of them
[3:05:08] anything.
[3:05:09] &gt;&gt; He just told it like it was.
[3:05:11] &gt;&gt; And the buzzard knew what nature he had.
[3:05:15] &gt;&gt; And the eagle must have known what
[3:05:17] nature he had.
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; He started a new creation. What was it?
[3:05:24] A creation of himself. God was made
[3:05:26] flesh. Isn't that what John 1 tells us?
[3:05:29] John 1:1, John 1:14. Isn't that what it
[3:05:32] tells us? The Bible said in the
[3:05:34] beginning, and then right here,
[3:05:36] Revelation 3:14,
[3:05:38] in the beginning of the creation of God,
[3:05:40] God was created in human form in Jesus
[3:05:42] Christ, his son. God dwelt. He built his
[3:05:46] tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived
[3:05:48] in that tabernacle. God, Emmanuel, God
[3:05:51] with us. He built himself a house. Does
[3:05:54] anybody know that's what he's doing in
[3:05:56] 2025?
[3:06:00] &gt;&gt; Not a Moses house.
[3:06:04] &gt;&gt; Moses represented a one-man ministry.
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; And there'll never be another one.
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're a pessimist.
[3:06:16] I'm actually a realist
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; and I've read the book
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; and there'll never be another oneman
[3:06:23] ministry like that again.
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; We saw it in the healing days.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; There'll never be another one like that
[3:06:30] again. There'll never be a major
[3:06:32] ministry patterned after that kind of
[3:06:35] one-man authority.
[3:06:42] But there will be
[3:06:45] a many membered body.
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; You know that's what happened in the
[3:06:55] resurrection. The devil thought he won.
[3:06:57] He crucified the son of glory. Laid him
[3:06:59] there. Danced on his tomb.
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; Thought it was over.
[3:07:05] Three days later, God raises from the
[3:07:07] dead that body
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; now having the keys of death, hell, and
[3:07:13] the grave, been into the heart of the
[3:07:14] earth, and done the business.
[3:07:18] &gt;&gt; And some days later,
[3:07:21] at Chevot, at Pentecost,
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; that's what I'm trying to get to. Come
[3:07:27] back tomorrow.
[3:07:28] He took the very thing that was in his
[3:07:30] son,
[3:07:31] &gt;&gt; him,
[3:07:33] &gt;&gt; and placed that
[3:07:36] on 120
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; same spirit,
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; same anointing,
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; same person,
[3:07:47] &gt;&gt; because it was the same spirit,
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; different manifestation, same spirit.
[3:07:53] And the devil just about had a nervous
[3:07:55] breakdown
[3:07:57] &gt;&gt; because he said, "Here, we thought we
[3:07:58] defeated one Jesus and now there's at
[3:08:00] least 120 Jesus's
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; 1965 took a ministry like William
[3:08:11] Brandom off the scene. But 2025, there's
[3:08:15] a New Testament church rising up.
[3:08:23] Hallelujah.
[3:08:25] [Music]
[3:08:25] [Applause]
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; Commissioned like Joshua,
[3:08:31] &gt;&gt; many membered,
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; generational,
[3:08:35] &gt;&gt; multi-generational,
[3:08:37] many membered,
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; endued with the same power,
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; same authority.
[3:08:45] Amen.
[3:08:46] &gt;&gt; I promise you when you see that
[3:08:47] operating in your life, you'll say, "It
[3:08:50] was worth it all. It was worth it all.
[3:08:52] It was worth it all to get this over
[3:08:54] with."
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; I I I'm just going to sit down. Middle
[3:09:01] sentence. I think
[3:09:05] he built himself a house to live in it.
[3:09:09] There's a bunch of those houses here.
[3:09:13] There was once one
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; now in my father's house.
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; King James says man many mansions
[3:09:25] &gt;&gt; but we know that's not what it says in
[3:09:27] the original.
[3:09:28] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us that too.
[3:09:30] &gt;&gt; There's many what rooms.
[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody said I don't want to go to
[3:09:37] heaven to live in an apartment complex.
[3:09:41] I didn't go to heaven to live in a
[3:09:43] condominium.
[3:09:48] &gt;&gt; You You must be denominational.
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; Because you still think it's going to be
[3:09:53] like Mr. Rogers neighborhood.
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's not the house he's talking about.
[3:10:04] &gt;&gt; In my father's house, there are many
[3:10:06] rooms.
[3:10:08] There are many mansions.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; There are many dwelling places.
[3:10:13] &gt;&gt; My father's house is my kingdom.
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; And look what's in my kingdom.
[3:10:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe in heaven.
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; I I I believe it's going to look
[3:10:24] beautiful. I believe it's going to be
[3:10:25] marvelous. I believe it's glorious.
[3:10:28] &gt;&gt; But I'm not just excited about that.
[3:10:31] &gt;&gt; I'm excited about this.
[3:10:34] &gt;&gt; I'm excited about these mansions. I'm
[3:10:36] excited about these houses. I'm excited
[3:10:38] about these rooms. I'm excited about
[3:10:41] what Jesus can accomplish in a quick
[3:10:44] short work
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; that'll get the bride.
[3:10:51] She will grab the last harvest.
[3:10:57] &gt;&gt; She will.
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; Not Billy Graham Evangelistic
[3:11:02] Association.
[3:11:05] That bride will grab the last harvest.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; And you know who it'll be?
[3:11:13] It'll be some of the ones you fasted for
[3:11:15] and prayed for.
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; And God said, "I'm going to do it in my
[3:11:19] timing.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; I didn't bring them in when I brought
[3:11:22] you in because I didn't build them. They
[3:11:25] weren't built like you were built."
[3:11:30] &gt;&gt; When I knew you, I knew you could take
[3:11:32] it. You could come through it.
[3:11:36] &gt;&gt; You could come through the church hurt
[3:11:38] and the
[3:11:40] betrayal and even the man worship
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; and not be polluted.
[3:11:48] &gt;&gt; But there is a people that I just let
[3:11:50] them stay right where they are until
[3:11:52] that last quick short work
[3:11:55] &gt;&gt; when the people rise up and become the
[3:11:57] houses.
[3:11:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he preached? The last
[3:12:01] last of the last. What house will you
[3:12:04] build me?
[3:12:06] Here it is. Not just here.
[3:12:15] So he could
[3:12:17] Can I finish?
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; He built his tabernacle of flesh and
[3:12:20] bones and lived in that tabernacle. God,
[3:12:22] Emanuel, God with us. He built himself a
[3:12:24] house to live in it so he could reflect
[3:12:27] so he could reflect his word to his
[3:12:31] subjects through that
[3:12:34] you know what God is
[3:12:39] &gt;&gt; when you see Christ.
[3:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:43] &gt;&gt; Is that the last of that one?
[3:12:45] When you you know what God is
[3:12:49] when you see Christ. Let me give you
[3:12:51] this one. And I'm going. Yeah, you said
[3:12:53] that before. Yeah, I mean it, too.
[3:12:57] But I mean it more now.
[3:13:02] Just give me a minute. I'm getting old.
[3:13:06] Got to find it.
[3:13:09] I got to skip ahead to get to it.
[3:13:13] You still here?
[3:13:15] &gt;&gt; Don't go leaving yet.
[3:13:18] Where did I put it?
[3:13:22] Yes, Lord. Help him find it.
[3:13:28] I got real nervous when you started
[3:13:30] praying that.
[3:13:39] Where did I put that?
[3:13:43] Oh, praise the Lord.
[3:13:46] It's Jesus
[3:13:48] that I see.
[3:13:51] The son of man
[3:13:54] revealed in you and me.
[3:13:59] And I thank God
[3:14:02] that I'm part of the family
[3:14:07] where the people
[3:14:10] are perfect as can be. Here it is.
[3:14:16] Christ is the mystery.
[3:14:19] 160 God expressed
[3:14:23] in Jesus Christ who was both father,
[3:14:26] son, and holy ghost the fullness of the
[3:14:29] Godhead bodily. Isn't that what the word
[3:14:32] said he was?
[3:14:35] &gt;&gt; Did the word not say in him dwelt the
[3:14:37] fullness
[3:14:38] &gt;&gt; of the Godhead bodily in bodily form?
[3:14:41] Yes, it did. He said, "Now the complete
[3:14:44] fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[3:14:59] &gt;&gt; I was looking for you. I heard your
[3:15:00] voice and recognized it. But I was
[3:15:03] looking for you, Liam.
[3:15:07] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[3:15:10] in all that Christ was.
[3:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's how oneness is possible.
[3:15:20] &gt;&gt; You've already got inside of you
[3:15:23] &gt;&gt; a portion of all that he was.
[3:15:28] &gt;&gt; You don't think that can produce
[3:15:29] something?
[3:15:31] &gt;&gt; It created the world you're living on.
[3:15:38] I'm going to read this one very slow on
[3:15:40] the way back to my chair.
[3:15:43] He said, "Now the next one, things that
[3:15:45] are to be Rialto, California." If he can
[3:15:48] preach that in Rialto, California, he
[3:15:50] could preach it in Smith Station,
[3:15:51] Alabama.
[3:15:53] He said, "Now you're expressed
[3:15:56] after his word has come in you to light
[3:15:59] up the age."
[3:16:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody read that next line.
[3:16:10] Oh, wait a minute. Whoa.
[3:16:14] &gt;&gt; You are
[3:16:19] &gt;&gt; the expressing.
[3:16:23] If Christ is the mystery of God
[3:16:26] revealed,
[3:16:29] &gt;&gt; then the bride
[3:16:31] must be the mystery of Christ
[3:16:35] &gt;&gt; revealed.
[3:16:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:16:40] &gt;&gt; And the question is not who you are.
[3:16:44] &gt;&gt; And right now it's not really whose you
[3:16:46] are.
[3:16:47] &gt;&gt; The question is, do you know?
[3:16:51] Do you know who you are?
[3:16:55] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[3:16:59] &gt;&gt; You are his expressing
[3:17:01] &gt;&gt; God's life in you because you are a son
[3:17:07] &gt;&gt; or a daughter of God.
[3:17:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, you get what I
[3:17:11] mean?"
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; Congregation says, "Don't miss your
[3:17:16] queue."
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:20] He said, "You are now made.
[3:17:23] You're sitting in this church tonight
[3:17:25] because your duty, your duty. Would you
[3:17:28] want to do your due diligence and duty
[3:17:30] for God
[3:17:32] &gt;&gt; who gave it all for you?
[3:17:34] &gt;&gt; Sure you would.
[3:17:36] &gt;&gt; Because your duty is to express God.
[3:17:42] &gt;&gt; That broken church system will never do
[3:17:44] it. They'll try.
[3:17:46] They'll be more successful in helping
[3:17:48] make an influence over social justices
[3:17:51] than they will to do this.
[3:17:54] &gt;&gt; But there's a bride
[3:17:56] &gt;&gt; because your duty is to express God to
[3:17:58] this nation and this people and this
[3:18:00] neighborhood.
[3:18:04] &gt;&gt; Where you associate?
[3:18:06] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[3:18:08] &gt;&gt; Put your hand right up into his presence
[3:18:10] and say, "God, help us."
[3:18:12] &gt;&gt; God help us. Help us to express
[3:18:17] what you have deposited
[3:18:19] in us.
[3:18:22] &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't have chosen me,
[3:18:25] &gt;&gt; but you knew more about me than I knew
[3:18:27] about myself.
[3:18:29] &gt;&gt; There may be some others here that
[3:18:31] wouldn't have chosen themselves,
[3:18:33] &gt;&gt; but you saw in us
[3:18:36] &gt;&gt; an eternal yes
[3:18:38] &gt;&gt; to be filled with a portion of who you
[3:18:42] are.
[3:18:44] It's more than just being a good church
[3:18:46] member. It's having the ability and the
[3:18:49] responsibility to be Christ.
[3:18:52] To be Christ,
[3:18:54] to be the anointed,
[3:18:57] to be the anointed
[3:19:00] &gt;&gt; to a sick,
[3:19:02] dying world.
[3:19:05] So you go ahead and argue over marriage
[3:19:07] and divorce.
[3:19:09] And you go ahead and argue over tunis
[3:19:12] and
[3:19:14] you go ahead and argue over whether the
[3:19:16] gift should be in the back room or not.
[3:19:19] I'm going to try to spend my time
[3:19:21] getting ready
[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; to reflect who he is
[3:19:28] &gt;&gt; even to my neighborhood.
[3:19:31] &gt;&gt; Even to my neighborhood.
[3:19:41] [Music]
[3:19:48] I love you, Lord.
[3:19:53] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[3:19:59] All my days
[3:20:02] I've been held in your hands.
[3:20:07] From the moment that I wake up
[3:20:12] until I lay my hand,
[3:20:16] I will sing of the goodness
[3:20:21] of God. Sing that again. I love you,
[3:20:25] Lord.
[3:20:28] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[3:20:34] And all my days,
[3:20:37] Lord, I've been held right in your
[3:20:40] hands.

[3:20:46] until I lay my hand,

[3:20:53] of the goodness
[3:20:55] of God.

[3:21:08] Oh, and all my life you have been so so
[3:21:13] good.

[3:21:24] of the goodness
[3:21:27] of God. Cuz all my life
[3:21:32] and all my life you have been faithful.

[3:21:44] so good.
[3:21:47] Oh, with every breath that I am able.
[3:21:53] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[3:21:58] of God.
[3:22:00] Lord, I love your voice.
[3:22:04] Oh, you have led me through every fire
[3:22:10] in the darkest night.
[3:22:13] Lord, you've been close like no other.
[3:22:18] See, I've known you as a father
[3:22:21] and I've known you as my very best
[3:22:24] friend. And I have lived in the good
[3:22:29] place of God.
[3:22:32] Oh,

[3:23:11] again.

[3:23:17] You've been good
[3:23:20] with every breath that I am able.

[3:23:30] of God.

[3:23:38] running after me.

[3:23:51] surrender now. I give you everything.

[3:24:00] running after me.

[3:24:13] goodness is running after. It's running
[3:24:16] up to me for my life now. But surrender
[3:24:22] now. I give you everything.

[3:25:15] in the darkest night. Lord, you've been
[3:25:19] close like no other.
[3:25:23] Oh, I've known you as a father
[3:25:27] and I've known you as my friend.

[3:25:35] God.
[3:25:40] Cuz all my life you have been faith. Oh,
[3:25:45] isn't that your testimony tonight? Oh my
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; life you have been. My God, you in the
[3:25:53] dark times,
[3:25:55] in the lonely times that I am
[3:26:00] in the shattering times
[3:26:04] of the good. When your world was
[3:26:06] crumbling around you, you were still
[3:26:09] living in his goodness. All my life you
[3:26:13] have been faithful.
[3:26:15] You've been so faithful, Lord. Oh my all
[3:26:19] my life you have been so oh I feel so
[3:26:23] good.
[3:26:26] Oh with regret that I am able.
[3:26:32] Oh I will see
[3:26:34] the goodness
[3:26:36] of God.
[3:26:41] I can't describe what I feel.
[3:26:45] I I feel something like a promotion.
[3:26:53] We have Fort Benning out here.
[3:26:58] The wokes call it Fort Moore,
[3:27:02] but we have Fort Benning out here and
[3:27:04] it's the largest infantry training camp
[3:27:06] of the United States Army. And they're
[3:27:09] always graduating from something out
[3:27:10] there.
[3:27:13] And they have a parade field out there
[3:27:15] where they pin
[3:27:18] that promotion on the chest. In fact,
[3:27:21] Jenna, my daughter,
[3:27:24] I
[3:27:26] had have to say for some that will think
[3:27:29] I don't know my daughter's name. She is
[3:27:31] our daughter. She's the mother of our
[3:27:34] granddaughter and she's as much mine as
[3:27:38] she is her mom and daddy's because I've
[3:27:40] claimed her. She got to pin one of those
[3:27:44] awards, those promotions, those
[3:27:46] graduations
[3:27:47] on her own brother. It happens out there
[3:27:50] on a field
[3:27:53] where they brought dirt
[3:27:57] from major battlefields of the world
[3:28:01] where the American soldier fought and
[3:28:04] died.
[3:28:08] Some died. That's right. And they
[3:28:10] brought that dirt and they spread it out
[3:28:13] there on that field so that every
[3:28:15] soldier who graduates from different
[3:28:18] programs and levels, they're standing on
[3:28:21] the soil
[3:28:24] that represents generations before them.
[3:28:28] I I I I get a little emotional when I
[3:28:32] think about that.
[3:28:34] I I could feel something like that in
[3:28:37] the spirit tonight.
[3:28:40] Not just one,
[3:28:42] but I feel like there are people here
[3:28:44] who are stepping up.
[3:28:47] &gt;&gt; My That's a good feeling. It's a good
[3:28:49] feeling.
[3:28:50] &gt;&gt; It's good to feel and sense and and know
[3:28:53] that somebody's moving up. I I I I like
[3:28:56] where I I I like some of these places
[3:28:59] I've been, but my eyes are fixed on
[3:29:02] something a little higher. I I just want
[3:29:03] to keep moving up in Christ, moving up
[3:29:06] in the truth.
[3:29:09] moving up in maturity,
[3:29:11] &gt;&gt; moving up into the stature of the
[3:29:13] perfect man.
[3:29:15] &gt;&gt; And I could just feel that pleasure of
[3:29:17] the Lord over this house. Will you say
[3:29:20] yes to him right now?
[3:29:23] &gt;&gt; Would you just commit?
[3:29:25] &gt;&gt; I'll follow your voice. I'll follow your
[3:29:27] leading.
[3:29:30] &gt;&gt; I'll go deeper. I'll go higher.
[3:29:34] I'll yield more.
[3:29:37] I'm determined to give up more of my
[3:29:40] rights.
[3:29:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[3:29:43] &gt;&gt; And do your will.
[3:29:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I'm not a preacher." I'm
[3:29:47] not just talking to preachers.
[3:29:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to mamas with baskets full
[3:29:53] of babies at Walmart.
[3:29:57] And I'm talking to men who work beside
[3:30:00] men on their job. And I'm talking to
[3:30:02] people who have connections and
[3:30:04] acquaintances all over this community
[3:30:07] and wherever you're from.
[3:30:10] Would you ask the Lord to give you
[3:30:11] another installment of boldness and
[3:30:14] courage?
[3:30:15] Not to be religious,
[3:30:18] &gt;&gt; but to be light.
[3:30:23] Let the anointing
[3:30:26] that I know is not a feeling
[3:30:30] but the presence
[3:30:33] the the the very
[3:30:36] reality
[3:30:38] of the Christ.
[3:30:40] May that increase in my life.
[3:30:45] Somebody's been listening too much to
[3:30:48] what you think people think.
[3:30:52] Yes.
[3:30:53] &gt;&gt; Are you trained to do that?
[3:30:58] &gt;&gt; Have you been to school to study all
[3:30:59] that stuff? Then tell the devil he's a
[3:31:03] liar.
[3:31:04] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to figure out what somebody
[3:31:06] thinks about you. Quit thinking on what
[3:31:09] you think somebody thinks.
[3:31:12] &gt;&gt; And be filled with the anointing.
[3:31:16] be filled with greater determination
[3:31:21] at greater levels of faith and courage
[3:31:23] and strength. Be filled with more of who
[3:31:27] he is.
[3:31:29] [Music]
[3:31:30] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[3:31:33] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[3:31:35] may God give you new territory.
[3:31:38] May he expand the sphere of your
[3:31:41] influence as he filled you
[3:31:45] &gt;&gt; with more of who he is for this end time
[3:31:48] plan.
[3:31:50] &gt;&gt; There is an end time anointing.
[3:31:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:31:53] &gt;&gt; To finish this end time plan.
[3:31:56] &gt;&gt; And it's not a feeling.
[3:31:59] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[3:32:02] Raise
[3:32:05] your hand if you feel like you need
[3:32:06] something from him right now.
[3:32:11] &gt;&gt; He's prepared your heart and positioned
[3:32:13] you right now to receive something from
[3:32:15] him.
[3:32:23] Nobody's screaming over you and telling
[3:32:26] you what to feel or think.
[3:32:28] Soak
[3:32:32] be a sponge.
[3:32:35] More of your Lord, more of your
[3:32:38] anointing, more of your strength, more
[3:32:40] of your courage, more faith, more faith,
[3:32:45] anointed faith.
[3:32:48] Oh God, meet me in my living room. Meet
[3:32:51] me in my hallway. Meet me in my
[3:32:54] basement.
[3:32:56] Meet me in my she-shed. Meet me in my
[3:32:59] man cave. meet me.
[3:33:03] &gt;&gt; Let every place I go be a tabernacle.
[3:33:06] Let every place I go be a pavilion. Let
[3:33:08] every place I go be a place where your
[3:33:10] glory can meet with me.
[3:33:14] Oh, I feel something here.
[3:33:17] Break off,
[3:33:19] Lord. break off the residue,
[3:33:25] &gt;&gt; the residual
[3:33:27] junk
[3:33:29] from my journey.
[3:33:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you heard that
[3:33:34] masterpiece that R.J. was preaching last
[3:33:37] night.
[3:33:38] But when God gave me that Zechariah 3
[3:33:40] experience, I saw that dirty turban
[3:33:43] said, "Remove that dirty turban."
[3:33:47] And the turban was what covered the
[3:33:49] mind, the head of the priesthood.
[3:33:52] I'm going to take the residue of
[3:33:54] Babylonian captivity out of your
[3:33:56] thoughts.
[3:33:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take, that's what he was
[3:33:59] saying. I'm going to take some of those
[3:34:01] hurt things that you have have struggled
[3:34:04] to get above, but it keeps permeating
[3:34:06] your mind.
[3:34:09] Thank you, Lord.
[3:34:10] &gt;&gt; I I I don't want to be carnal, but there
[3:34:13] are more people in this room that have
[3:34:15] multiple levels of PTSD
[3:34:19] that have never been diagnosed
[3:34:23] because of the trauma and things that
[3:34:26] you've experienced on this journey. And
[3:34:29] even though it's a part of your story
[3:34:31] and a part of your journey, it is not to
[3:34:34] be dominant
[3:34:36] in your thought processes and paradigms
[3:34:39] moving forward. Oh God, give me grace.
[3:34:43] give you grace to see that that dirty
[3:34:46] turban that represents the captivity of
[3:34:50] Babylon,
[3:34:52] let it be snatched,
[3:34:56] unwound from my head,
[3:35:00] and a new fair miter,
[3:35:02] a new holy miter be placed on my head
[3:35:05] that screams holiness unto the Lord.
[3:35:08] Holiness unto the Lord, holiness unto
[3:35:11] the Lord. How many of you want your
[3:35:13] life, you want your life to say holiness
[3:35:16] unto the Lord, set apart unto the Lord,
[3:35:20] sanctified unto the Lord, separated to
[3:35:24] the glory of God.
[3:35:28] &gt;&gt; He called you for that.
[3:35:31] If you're here and you feel like you're
[3:35:33] still carrying some uh religious
[3:35:41] mindsets
[3:35:44] that are more like denominational things
[3:35:46] than the word.
[3:35:48] Somebody say, "Well, that's the way I
[3:35:50] was raised." Well, will that be your
[3:35:52] will that be your ceiling
[3:35:55] or will that be your floor?
[3:35:58] Why don't we just make where we were
[3:35:59] raised and what we were Why don't we
[3:36:01] make that our floor,
[3:36:03] &gt;&gt; the good, bad, and the ugly. And why
[3:36:05] don't we say, "I'm not staying where I
[3:36:06] was raised.
[3:36:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going higher.
[3:36:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not going back,
[3:36:11] &gt;&gt; but I'm going higher."
[3:36:13] It it's the mark of spiritual fatherhood
[3:36:18] &gt;&gt; and motherhood to want to impart
[3:36:21] &gt;&gt; to your children natural or spiritual
[3:36:24] enough that they don't have to start
[3:36:26] where you started.
[3:36:29] &gt;&gt; But they pick up where you're leaving
[3:36:30] off and they go higher.
[3:36:34] &gt;&gt; And I grew up in a generation where some
[3:36:36] of the old-timers said, "Ha,
[3:36:39] let them pay the price I paid."
[3:36:42] And I've even felt that way a time or
[3:36:44] two. But when that spiritual fatherhood
[3:36:46] thing begins to come on you, you say,
[3:36:48] "Lord, spare them."
[3:36:51] &gt;&gt; I learned it. I went through it. I had
[3:36:54] it. They shouldn't have to. Let me do
[3:36:57] something to help them get above.
[3:37:00] &gt;&gt; How many of you like to get above
[3:37:02] &gt;&gt; some of the things you're still
[3:37:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel that. I'm going to sit down.
[3:37:10] I'm not preaching now. You can't count
[3:37:11] this as preaching.
[3:37:17] &gt;&gt; I would love to see the Lord just,
[3:37:20] [Music]
[3:37:22] you know, that turban wraps and wraps
[3:37:24] and wraps and wraps and wraps.
[3:37:26] You You'd probably look like a top
[3:37:30] if that thing started coming off of you.
[3:37:34] years and years of stuff that happened
[3:37:38] to you really to promote you.
[3:37:43] But the enemy's tried to make it your
[3:37:45] lifelong identity.
[3:37:48] You are not identified by where you've
[3:37:51] been
[3:37:52] or what you've been through.
[3:37:54] &gt;&gt; You are identified as a part of the new
[3:37:56] creation of God.
[3:37:59] New mindsets,
[3:38:02] &gt;&gt; new clean turbons,
[3:38:05] &gt;&gt; new thoughts and holy thoughts and clean
[3:38:07] thoughts and hopeful thoughts.
[3:38:10] [Music]
[3:38:11] thoughts that are not pessimistic
[3:38:15] &gt;&gt; and defeated and orphan
[3:38:19] &gt;&gt; and forsaken
[3:38:26] &gt;&gt; but confident.
[3:38:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to answer the call not like
[3:38:32] Adam and Eve
[3:38:34] shaking in the woods.
[3:38:37] I'm going to answer the call like Adam
[3:38:38] answered the first call.
[3:38:41] I'm here, Lord.
[3:38:43] &gt;&gt; Let's take our walk.
[3:38:46] &gt;&gt; And he would have always done it just
[3:38:47] like that had he not started mixing
[3:38:49] truth and life.
[3:38:53] As soon as that other side of knowledge
[3:38:55] was discovered,
[3:38:57] &gt;&gt; you should see it this way.
[3:39:00] Adam was created to only know that which
[3:39:02] was good, that which was to in Hebrew,
[3:39:06] and righteous and upright and holy. But
[3:39:08] that that tree and what happened in that
[3:39:11] garden represented the knowledge of the
[3:39:13] other side. And what we have today is a
[3:39:16] generation that's more acquainted
[3:39:19] with the dark side,
[3:39:23] &gt;&gt; not the knowledge of good. They're more
[3:39:25] acquainted with the knowledge of evil.
[3:39:28] &gt;&gt; And they live out of that.
[3:39:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to.
[3:39:33] &gt;&gt; You've been redeemed out of that.
[3:39:36] Why don't you take a big old bite uh
[3:39:39] from the tree of life? Because the
[3:39:41] chariot beam that once guarded the way
[3:39:45] and wouldn't let us back,
[3:39:48] they're still active.
[3:39:50] &gt;&gt; They've still got flaming sword,
[3:39:53] &gt;&gt; but they're not trying to keep you out
[3:39:54] anymore.
[3:39:57] They're trying to help us get coraled,
[3:40:00] gathered up
[3:40:02] &gt;&gt; so that we can go back to that place
[3:40:06] &gt;&gt; and know what it's about.
[3:40:08] May we have a taste.
[3:40:13] It would have been terrible
[3:40:16] if Adam and Eve could have made their
[3:40:18] way back to that tree
[3:40:20] after their bodies had already been
[3:40:23] under the curse.
[3:40:26] and they would have had to live
[3:40:29] eternally
[3:40:32] in a fallen body
[3:40:35] and that was not your plan. You kept
[3:40:38] them out
[3:40:42] and now you invite us in.
[3:40:47] Anybody follow that?
[3:40:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're taking a bite of your
[3:40:51] goodness tonight.
[3:40:54] Loose us.
[3:40:56] I I didn't hear that. I said loose us.
[3:40:58] What I heard what I heard in the spirit
[3:41:00] was what we heard last night, wasn't it?
[3:41:05] Loose thyself.
[3:41:08] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[3:41:10] &gt;&gt; Oh captive
[3:41:12] daughter of Zion,
[3:41:15] it's a farce.
[3:41:18] &gt;&gt; The bonds around your neck
[3:41:20] &gt;&gt; are opened.
[3:41:23] You've already been set free.
[3:41:25] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is reach up and cast
[3:41:28] them off. Loose thyself.
[3:41:32] [Music]
[3:41:33] The price has already been paid.
[3:41:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have 30 years of
[3:41:38] deliverance ministry. You don't have to
[3:41:41] repent back 112 generations.
[3:41:44] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is recognize that the
[3:41:47] key has been to put in the lock.
[3:41:51] And the only reason why you're not free,
[3:41:54] I'm not free, is because we're like that
[3:41:56] old bear.
[3:41:59] &gt;&gt; That we saw last night. We were in the
[3:42:01] cage so long. We can only
[3:42:03] &gt;&gt; free.
[3:42:05] &gt;&gt; Tell him right now, I want to be free.
[3:42:10] &gt;&gt; Little more of that and let's go.
[3:42:12] [Music]

[3:42:15] gravy. Let's hurry now.
