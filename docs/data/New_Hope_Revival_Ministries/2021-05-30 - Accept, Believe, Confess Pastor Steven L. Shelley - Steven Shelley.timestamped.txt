[56:40] we're going to the word in just a moment
[56:43] but before we do we have a few
[56:46] announcements that we
[56:47] are going to make and uh
[56:51] today is a very special day it
[56:54] is the birthday of brother chad
[56:58] jernigan would you tell him happy
[56:59] birthday today
[57:00] [Music]
[57:07] and he's happy because he's not 50 yet
[57:12] amen tomorrow is memorial day
[57:15] where we will remember we should we
[57:18] really really should because
[57:21] many have given everything many have
[57:25] given lots
[57:27] and some have given all for you and i to
[57:30] have the freedom that we have
[57:31] today and i think that most of our
[57:34] families have been touched we
[57:36] all have veterans in our families but i
[57:39] think if we go back far enough
[57:41] look look at our heritage a little bit
[57:44] we would find out that most of
[57:45] us have family members that even
[57:48] died in warfare and that is what
[57:51] memorial day
[57:52] is to remember those who gave everything
[57:55] for our freedom
[57:56] it's very hard to watch it being taken
[57:59] from us little by little by little by
[58:01] little
[58:02] when we know that the blood of the
[58:04] veterans the blood of those soldiers is
[58:06] crying out that we could remain free
[58:09] and we have the freedom to express
[58:12] ourselves our opinion what we think
[58:15] we have a situation where there were
[58:18] many who
[58:19] died so that we could have freedom they
[58:22] died under a flag and they gave
[58:25] freedom to those who want to burn that
[58:27] flag
[58:28] it's a very strange situation but it's
[58:30] where we are
[58:31] it's how it's our nation it's our
[58:33] country we don't go along with such
[58:36] as that but we know that those men gave
[58:39] their lives
[58:40] for freedom and sometimes
[58:43] we can't always pick and choose when
[58:46] we're in the hands of men's government
[58:47] i'm so glad that there's a bright church
[58:50] in the earth
[58:51] that are living under a different
[58:53] authority sure we show respect we must
[58:57] we must show respect to those who are
[58:59] over us in our government we pray for
[59:01] them
[59:02] to the best of our ability we want to
[59:04] help them out
[59:06] but we understand that we have a higher
[59:08] authority to answer to
[59:10] and that's god's living word we want to
[59:13] obey that word with everything that's
[59:15] within us so no matter how you choose to
[59:18] celebrate your day tomorrow whether it's
[59:20] a barbecue
[59:21] or whether it's some time
[59:24] near the swimming pool or maybe you're
[59:27] going to a family reunion
[59:29] regardless of what it is take some time
[59:32] to discuss among yourselves how
[59:34] wonderful it is
[59:36] that we have the freedoms that we have
[59:38] in our nation
[59:40] and uh tomorrow is aaron graves birthday

[1:07:49] and those of you who are connecting with
[1:07:51] us in other places

[1:07:57] have covered in the last few services
[1:08:00] as we move forward we want to do that

[1:08:24] there to say who is joshua hugging i
[1:08:26] couldn't see from here

[1:08:34] saw that it was brother donovan lewis

[1:08:52] but he sure helps us to see him in
[1:08:54] person this morning and all the rest of
[1:08:56] you who are here
[1:08:57] john chapter 3 yes we've read this
[1:09:00] but we're going to read it again it's
[1:09:02] still in red a lot of it it's still the
[1:09:04] words of our lord amen
[1:09:06] there was a man of the pharisees verse
[1:09:09] one
[1:09:10] named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[1:09:13] the same came to jesus by night
[1:09:16] and said unto him rabbi we know
[1:09:20] that thou art a teacher come from god
[1:09:23] for no man can do these miracles that
[1:09:26] thou doest
[1:09:27] except god be with him
[1:09:31] verse 3 jesus answered and said unto him
[1:09:35] verily verily i say unto thee
[1:09:38] except a man be born again
[1:09:42] he cannot see the kingdom
[1:09:46] of god nicodemus said unto him
[1:09:49] how can a man be born when he is old
[1:09:53] can he enter a second time into his
[1:09:56] mother's womb and be born
[1:09:58] jesus answered verily verily i say
[1:10:02] unto thee except a man be born of water
[1:10:07] and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:10:10] into the kingdom of god
[1:10:15] that which is born of the flesh is what
[1:10:18] it's flesh and that which is born of the
[1:10:21] spirit
[1:10:22] is spirit there's a part of you this
[1:10:24] morning that was born of flesh
[1:10:27] that's your flesh but there is a part of
[1:10:30] you
[1:10:30] if you're born again if you're born from
[1:10:33] heaven if you're born from above
[1:10:36] there's a part of you that is spirit
[1:10:38] because it was born
[1:10:40] of the spirit that which is born of the
[1:10:43] flesh
[1:10:44] is flesh that which is born of the
[1:10:46] spirit
[1:10:47] is spirit hallelujah marvel not that i
[1:10:51] said unto thee you must be born again
[1:10:54] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[1:10:56] thou hearest the sound thereof but can't
[1:10:58] not tell whence it cometh and whether it
[1:11:00] goeth so is everyone
[1:11:02] that is born of the spirit jesus is
[1:11:05] preparing nicodemus for the fact
[1:11:07] you may not see this birth you may not
[1:11:11] see it like you would see a natural
[1:11:13] birth
[1:11:13] but you'll see the results
[1:11:16] you'll know that it's real because it
[1:11:19] will produce something
[1:11:21] in your life do you believe that
[1:11:24] jesus answered and said unto him art
[1:11:26] thou a master of israel
[1:11:28] and no it's not these things verily
[1:11:30] verily i say unto thee we speak that we
[1:11:32] do know
[1:11:33] and testify that we have seen and you
[1:11:36] receive not our witness
[1:11:38] if i've told you earthly things and you
[1:11:39] believe not how shall you believe if i
[1:11:42] tell you of
[1:11:42] heavenly things he goes on and no man
[1:11:45] hath ascended up to heaven
[1:11:47] but he that come down from heaven even
[1:11:50] the son of man which is in heaven
[1:11:52] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[1:11:54] the wilderness even so
[1:11:56] must the son of man be lifted up and
[1:11:59] indeed he was
[1:12:00] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:12:03] not perish
[1:12:05] but have eternal life for god so
[1:12:08] loved the world that he gave
[1:12:12] his only begotten son
[1:12:16] that whosoever believeth
[1:12:19] in him listen now
[1:12:22] might not perish
[1:12:25] but have everlasting life
[1:12:29] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:12:32] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:12:36] through him
[1:12:38] read that for me might be saved
[1:12:41] he that believeth on him is not
[1:12:43] condemned but he that believeth not
[1:12:46] is condemned already because he hath not
[1:12:48] believed in the name of the only
[1:12:49] begotten
[1:12:50] son of god and this is the condemnation
[1:12:53] that
[1:12:53] light has come into the world and men
[1:12:56] loved darkness rather than light
[1:12:58] because their deeds were evil i want to
[1:13:01] read that last verse again and i want
[1:13:03] you to know
[1:13:04] it's the temperature of planet earth
[1:13:07] in 2021 it's not only the temperature
[1:13:12] of planet earth in the time of our lord
[1:13:15] in his life in the second temple period
[1:13:18] but it is the temperature of planet
[1:13:20] earth right now
[1:13:21] and this is the condemnation that
[1:13:24] light is come into the world
[1:13:28] and men love darkness rather than light
[1:13:32] because their deeds were evil
[1:13:35] pray with me would you father we bow our
[1:13:38] hearts before you today
[1:13:40] and we thank you that you are with us
[1:13:43] you are with us we brought you with us
[1:13:46] when we came
[1:13:47] this morning we thank you oh god for
[1:13:50] that presence
[1:13:51] it's life to us it's healing and
[1:13:54] wholeness
[1:13:55] to us we felt you as we worshiped you
[1:13:58] and lifted up your name
[1:14:00] and sung of your grace and your blood
[1:14:03] in our life we felt you as we lifted our
[1:14:07] petitions before you and our brother led
[1:14:09] us
[1:14:10] in prayer we feel you as the word is
[1:14:13] read
[1:14:14] it's not a dead letter to us it's not
[1:14:17] just
[1:14:17] words on a page to us but it has become
[1:14:21] living bread it has become living meat
[1:14:25] it has become living drink in the life
[1:14:28] of every believer
[1:14:29] we don't take it for granted lord in
[1:14:32] fact we thank you with all that we have
[1:14:35] for letting us be gathered under this
[1:14:37] word today
[1:14:38] we bind the hand of the enemy we know
[1:14:41] how desperately he opposes the preaching
[1:14:43] of the reveal word and we thank you that
[1:14:46] angels of the most high god
[1:14:48] have taken their positions in this room
[1:14:51] and we pray that as this word goes forth
[1:14:53] today
[1:14:54] it will not only bring help and hope and
[1:14:56] strength
[1:14:57] to those gathered here but that it will
[1:14:59] also reach to the uttermost part of the
[1:15:02] earth
[1:15:02] and we will give you glory and honor and
[1:15:04] praise
[1:15:05] for it's in the lovely name of the lord
[1:15:07] jesus christ we pray
[1:15:09] amen and amen you may be seated
[1:15:13] so right now they're telling me that
[1:15:15] they're on facebook
[1:15:17] there are already believers gathering
[1:15:19] with us from india
[1:15:20] canada uganda trinidad and tobago
[1:15:24] and uh also out on the west coast
[1:15:28] of this country god bless every one of
[1:15:30] you who are there
[1:15:31] we just greet you
[1:15:35] in a message called the end time
[1:15:37] evangelism
[1:15:39] 1962 i want to start with this
[1:15:42] brother branham talk to us in those that
[1:15:46] were gathered there
[1:15:48] and to us as we have come to listen to
[1:15:51] these sermons through the years
[1:15:53] about the born-again experience
[1:15:56] and i want to share even though with
[1:15:59] most of you gathered here i've shared a
[1:16:00] few of those portions of scripture
[1:16:02] before we get into
[1:16:03] preaching today i want to re-share some
[1:16:05] of them
[1:16:06] as they fit with what we're going to say
[1:16:09] as we're gathered here today
[1:16:11] paragraph 57 jesus said
[1:16:14] you must be born again we just heard him
[1:16:18] say that
[1:16:19] in order to be born again it's letting
[1:16:23] yourself
[1:16:24] go and die sounds so easy doesn't it
[1:16:28] but how many of you know death is hard
[1:16:32] death is smelly there's a lot of things
[1:16:36] associated with
[1:16:37] death that are not pleasant and we're
[1:16:40] being told
[1:16:41] that in order to receive a higher birth
[1:16:44] than the one we received in the flesh
[1:16:47] we had that birth we were there but we
[1:16:50] don't likely remember it
[1:16:52] if you're blessed to have your mother
[1:16:54] alive she can fill
[1:16:55] you in on the details how many of you
[1:16:58] have ever had your mother say oh
[1:17:00] you were so heavy to carry and you my
[1:17:03] back hurt so bad while
[1:17:04] i was carrying you and and i had so much
[1:17:07] heartburn and
[1:17:09] you were born with a head full of hair
[1:17:11] and they fill in the details well you
[1:17:13] and i were there
[1:17:14] born in the flesh that day for instance
[1:17:18] we could say
[1:17:18] chad how many years ago today
[1:17:24] is that because okay
[1:17:28] here we are preaching about being born
[1:17:30] again
[1:17:32] and chad is telling us at least 25 years
[1:17:35] ago
[1:17:36] 25 plus he was there that day but he
[1:17:39] doesn't likely remember the events
[1:17:42] perhaps his mother karen has filled him
[1:17:44] in as we were speaking of just a moment
[1:17:46] ago
[1:17:47] but you and i have all shared that birth
[1:17:50] but there's another birth it's a higher
[1:17:52] birth
[1:17:53] we've said so many times from this
[1:17:56] pulpit that
[1:17:57] born again sister nancy used to laugh at
[1:18:00] us
[1:18:01] she's going to be with the lord but she
[1:18:04] worked for the lord in jerusalem for
[1:18:06] many years and
[1:18:07] she used to laugh at me because she said
[1:18:09] you always say born
[1:18:10] again borned again and i said well
[1:18:14] that's the past
[1:18:15] of born again borned again
[1:18:18] it means i at one time was so if you
[1:18:21] catch me saying borned
[1:18:23] again in fact i even sung the song
[1:18:26] borned again there's really been a
[1:18:28] change in me
[1:18:29] if you hear me saying that you'll know i
[1:18:31] know better but i just don't choose
[1:18:33] better
[1:18:34] it means to be born from above
[1:18:37] it means that there is a part of me that
[1:18:40] has
[1:18:40] experienced a birth that is not of the
[1:18:44] flesh
[1:18:44] that is not of the earth it's of a
[1:18:47] higher order
[1:18:48] i love the way that sounds you have had
[1:18:51] a birth
[1:18:52] of a higher order hallelujah you have
[1:18:55] had a birth
[1:18:56] of a higher order and in that birth of a
[1:19:00] higher order
[1:19:01] you also receive some things and we
[1:19:05] sometimes have to stir up our memories
[1:19:08] to remember how that felt we knew that
[1:19:11] we carried a burden
[1:19:13] and a guilt and a condemnation for our
[1:19:16] sin
[1:19:17] it weighed us down some of us carried it
[1:19:20] for years
[1:19:22] others of us were just made aware of it
[1:19:24] and then all of a sudden we
[1:19:26] we had a way provided a way was
[1:19:28] explained
[1:19:29] and we accepted that way and we got out
[1:19:32] from under that burden
[1:19:33] but how many of you know the born-again
[1:19:35] experience is
[1:19:36] more than just relieving you from the
[1:19:39] burden of sin
[1:19:40] it's more than just removing the guilt
[1:19:44] it's about standing you up right in a
[1:19:47] position where you can please god
[1:19:50] and there are steps in that born-again
[1:19:53] process
[1:19:54] it's not all just the night you repented
[1:19:57] of your sin
[1:19:58] there is a process involved there is a
[1:20:02] life
[1:20:02] if you will that is being revealed
[1:20:05] and for some that may come in rapid fire
[1:20:09] succession
[1:20:10] but for others it may be more of a
[1:20:13] journey
[1:20:14] and more of a process i dare say church
[1:20:17] today that every one of us
[1:20:19] are still in the at least in the closing
[1:20:23] moments of that process because we are
[1:20:26] still being sanctified and set straight
[1:20:30] by the word of god it still corrects us
[1:20:34] it still guides us it still gives us
[1:20:38] leadership
[1:20:39] and we give thanks to god for that we
[1:20:41] really do
[1:20:42] he said but in order to be born again is
[1:20:45] letting yourself
[1:20:46] go and die and the spirit of christ
[1:20:51] now notice this isn't the spirit of the
[1:20:54] third person
[1:20:55] of a trinity god this is the very
[1:20:59] same spirit that was in our lord jesus
[1:21:02] christ
[1:21:03] he said so we've read those scriptures
[1:21:06] so many times together
[1:21:08] it and the spirit of christ come into
[1:21:11] you
[1:21:12] then you're no more yours
[1:21:16] does that offend you when you find out
[1:21:19] that part of the born-again experience
[1:21:21] is losing control
[1:21:22] of your own life
[1:21:26] you know there's times we resent that
[1:21:29] there are times on the journey
[1:21:31] that we may have resented the chastening
[1:21:33] of the lord
[1:21:35] we may have resented a door that he
[1:21:37] opened that we didn't want open
[1:21:38] and just nudged us into that door we may
[1:21:41] resent it that he closed the door
[1:21:44] that we really wanted to walk through
[1:21:46] but i want you to know it's something to
[1:21:48] know
[1:21:48] that the spirit of christ has come
[1:21:50] inside of you
[1:21:51] and he's living inside of you and that
[1:21:54] your control over
[1:21:56] your own life has been surrendered to
[1:21:58] the one
[1:21:59] that sees eternity past he sees the
[1:22:02] present
[1:22:02] he sees eternity future all at the same
[1:22:05] time
[1:22:06] and he's working all things for our good
[1:22:10] bless his holy name if you believe that
[1:22:12] same man
[1:22:14] so don't resent the fact that you're not
[1:22:16] your own anymore
[1:22:18] that you belong to him you are his
[1:22:20] secular
[1:22:21] you are his precious treasure he values
[1:22:25] you
[1:22:25] above all things on planet earth
[1:22:28] there's a lot of beauty on the earth
[1:22:30] there is there's a lot of valuable
[1:22:32] things on the earth
[1:22:33] but when god looks at you he sees you as
[1:22:36] one of the most valuable things
[1:22:38] there's only one thing more valuable
[1:22:40] than you are that's me
[1:22:43] you can say the same thing to me
[1:22:46] oh brother shelley you're highly valued
[1:22:49] to the lord only thing more valued than
[1:22:51] you it's me
[1:22:52] this is how he feels about his own my we
[1:22:56] ought to praise him
[1:22:57] my we have something to thank god for
[1:22:59] today hallelujah
[1:23:01] then you're no more yours it's christ in
[1:23:04] you
[1:23:04] see the holy spirit paul said i die
[1:23:07] daily yet i live
[1:23:09] i die daily yet i live
[1:23:13] not i but christ liveth in me
[1:23:16] see christ he said he told us that
[1:23:20] nicodemus was a good man a church member
[1:23:22] a religious leader of his day he told us
[1:23:25] he was about 80 years old
[1:23:27] a priest his whole life a master in
[1:23:29] israel
[1:23:30] but what he was missing was a real god
[1:23:33] he needed
[1:23:34] someone or something to keep pointing
[1:23:37] him
[1:23:37] nudging him pulling him in the right
[1:23:40] direction
[1:23:41] he needed to become aware of a deep
[1:23:44] calling
[1:23:45] that was way down in the life of
[1:23:47] nicodemus
[1:23:48] that said i gotta have more i'm not
[1:23:51] satisfied
[1:23:52] with temple service i'm not satisfied
[1:23:55] with temple worship i've got to have
[1:23:57] more
[1:23:58] and we know that if there is a desire in
[1:24:01] your heart
[1:24:02] for more it's the deeb of god calling
[1:24:04] out
[1:24:05] for the deep of god and it proves to us
[1:24:09] that there's more when i know that i
[1:24:12] desire
[1:24:12] more it's evidence to me that there is
[1:24:16] more to be had
[1:24:17] so don't you get satisfied down here
[1:24:21] just keep reaching for more of what god
[1:24:24] has to offer
[1:24:25] can you say amen he just couldn't
[1:24:28] understand it
[1:24:29] he tried to take a spiritual truth
[1:24:32] and understand it with a natural
[1:24:36] understanding now we know that natural
[1:24:39] types the the spiritual but we also know
[1:24:43] that the spiritual cannot be understood
[1:24:47] by the natural
[1:24:50] the natural types the spiritual
[1:24:53] but the spiritual cannot be understood
[1:24:56] with a natural understanding
[1:24:58] so in order for the natural to show you
[1:25:01] the way
[1:25:02] in order for you to look at the natural
[1:25:05] and see the way that christ would have
[1:25:07] you to go
[1:25:08] it takes something supernatural help me
[1:25:11] now
[1:25:12] something supernatural dropping down so
[1:25:15] that
[1:25:15] truth and observation what you see
[1:25:19] what you hear what you think what you
[1:25:22] feel like you know
[1:25:23] it all gets stored up here in the
[1:25:26] intellect
[1:25:27] it's by the holy spirit of god
[1:25:30] that that information is dropped down
[1:25:33] from our head our intellect our mind
[1:25:36] into the innermost being
[1:25:39] i read this week where brother branham
[1:25:41] said that
[1:25:42] that beautiful holy of holies
[1:25:46] that ark of the covenant that sat
[1:25:49] in the in the tabernacle there that
[1:25:52] beautiful representation of the throne
[1:25:55] of god
[1:25:56] it was a representation in the earth
[1:26:00] of the throne of god in the heavenlies
[1:26:03] it was an image a replica and he said
[1:26:07] on the day of pentecost that ark of the
[1:26:10] covenant
[1:26:10] that had once been a box hidden behind
[1:26:13] curtains and
[1:26:14] tents he said that that great ark of the
[1:26:18] covenant
[1:26:18] was moved from the natural to the
[1:26:21] spiritual
[1:26:22] and he said now the ark of the covenant
[1:26:25] the ark of the testimony is laying deep
[1:26:28] down
[1:26:29] in the heart of the believer and as god
[1:26:32] was once sitting on the throne somewhere
[1:26:34] else he now desires by the holy ghost
[1:26:37] to sit on the throne room of your life
[1:26:41] to guide you help me now to guide you
[1:26:45] to lead you along to inspire you
[1:26:49] to reach for more to be all that god has
[1:26:51] called you to be
[1:26:53] no one is encouraging you to be your
[1:26:54] better self
[1:26:58] when we look at ourselves we don't see
[1:27:01] much
[1:27:02] to be better about what we're
[1:27:05] encouraging people to be
[1:27:06] is all that jesus christ paid for
[1:27:10] if you'll just reach to be all that god
[1:27:13] desires you to be
[1:27:15] you'll be a better version oh my
[1:27:18] of what you've ever seen in the mirror
[1:27:21] you'll be a better version of what you
[1:27:23] are when you finish a good book
[1:27:24] or when you listen to a good webinar or
[1:27:27] when you study self-help
[1:27:28] and uh making yourself better i believe
[1:27:31] all of those things
[1:27:32] have their place but i want you to know
[1:27:34] you'll never be the best
[1:27:36] that you can be until you surrender to
[1:27:39] the god
[1:27:40] help me now you've got to let the god
[1:27:43] come and sit on the throne of your heart
[1:27:45] you've got to let the god come and lead
[1:27:48] you
[1:27:48] and direct you so once nicodemus stood
[1:27:52] in the presence of the god once he stood
[1:27:56] in the presence of the one who was
[1:27:58] ordained
[1:28:00] the same spirit of the father
[1:28:03] was now in the lord jesus christ
[1:28:06] nicodemus was looking at a body of flesh
[1:28:10] but in that body of flesh was the
[1:28:13] eternal spirit
[1:28:14] of god he was in the presence
[1:28:17] of almighty god when he stood in the
[1:28:19] presence
[1:28:20] of the body of the lord jesus christ now
[1:28:23] the god was on the scene
[1:28:25] the spirit of the lord was there to lead
[1:28:27] and what happened
[1:28:28] was a supernatural thing you see
[1:28:30] nicodemus responded first
[1:28:33] in the natural i don't know how i i i
[1:28:36] don't get that
[1:28:37] how could i go back i'm a big man i'm an
[1:28:39] old man
[1:28:40] how could i go back be inside my
[1:28:42] mother's womb and be born again
[1:28:44] he was looking at it in a wrong way
[1:28:46] jesus
[1:28:47] said i he must have thought and i'm
[1:28:49] going to make this real plain
[1:28:51] because he went in and he began to
[1:28:53] explain it all again and i want you to
[1:28:56] know there must have been a revelation
[1:28:58] there must have been something
[1:29:00] supernatural taking place
[1:29:02] because i know the church for years has
[1:29:04] condemned nicodemus
[1:29:06] i mentioned this a couple weeks ago
[1:29:08] they've condemned him
[1:29:10] because he came by night they've said oh
[1:29:12] he was embarrassed
[1:29:14] he was ashamed he didn't want nobody to
[1:29:16] see him
[1:29:17] brother branham said oh that might have
[1:29:18] been the case but he said he was a busy
[1:29:21] man
[1:29:21] he was a busy man and a leader in israel
[1:29:25] it could be that the only time that he
[1:29:27] had to come was by night
[1:29:29] doesn't really matter today folk why he
[1:29:32] came at night
[1:29:33] what matter is that he came what
[1:29:36] mattered is that he came it doesn't
[1:29:38] matter whether you come young
[1:29:40] or middle-aged or old what matters is
[1:29:44] that you come that you come to him
[1:29:47] before it's too late
[1:29:48] that you surrender the ark of the
[1:29:50] covenant of your life
[1:29:51] and let him come and sit on the throne
[1:29:54] and be your god
[1:29:56] be your help be your stay he wants to be
[1:29:58] the foundation of your life
[1:30:00] you cannot understand the natural until
[1:30:03] the spirit of god quickens it then you
[1:30:05] look in
[1:30:06] and you can see so many beautiful types
[1:30:09] of the natural
[1:30:10] of the spirit we should say that are
[1:30:13] that are outlined for
[1:30:14] us in the natural i love that now
[1:30:18] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:30:20] and forever let's hit that for just a
[1:30:22] moment paragraph five
[1:30:23] and we're going to move on i got to
[1:30:25] hurry because i want to get to something
[1:30:27] in a moment
[1:30:27] so therefore no man could save another
[1:30:30] here's what i want you to know if you
[1:30:32] don't already know it
[1:30:33] i believe if you're sitting in this room
[1:30:35] today you probably know this
[1:30:37] but you may be watching this somewhere
[1:30:39] else and you may not be completely sure
[1:30:42] how salvation comes to man today i want
[1:30:44] you to know
[1:30:45] it doesn't come by a earthly
[1:30:48] relationship
[1:30:49] god has no grandchildren it doesn't
[1:30:52] matter how much
[1:30:53] mama loved him doesn't matter how much
[1:30:55] daddy loved him doesn't matter how much
[1:30:56] your children love him
[1:30:58] what matters is do you love him have you
[1:31:01] met
[1:31:02] him do you know him salvation doesn't
[1:31:05] come in any other form by any other
[1:31:07] means
[1:31:08] by any other person other than the lord
[1:31:11] jesus christ
[1:31:14] your kindness will not save you by the
[1:31:17] blood he said
[1:31:18] only by the blood you see your kindness
[1:31:22] can give you
[1:31:23] can give you favor in life you're good
[1:31:25] to people you're good especially to the
[1:31:27] bride
[1:31:28] you can certainly have favor in life god
[1:31:30] will bless you
[1:31:31] for blessing others he will bless you
[1:31:34] for blessing others you may buy coffee
[1:31:36] for someone behind you in the line
[1:31:38] who's not even of god will bless you for
[1:31:40] that because you've done something as
[1:31:42] unto him he said that that you've done
[1:31:44] to the least of my little ones
[1:31:46] that you have done also to me but the
[1:31:49] only way to have eternal life
[1:31:51] is through repentance through the blood
[1:31:54] of jesus christ
[1:31:56] and through a born-again experience you
[1:31:58] can't be sanctified by being kind to
[1:32:00] somebody
[1:32:02] you don't receive the baptism of the
[1:32:04] holy ghost by joining the church
[1:32:07] it's only by personal experience
[1:32:11] with jesus christ that our birth is now
[1:32:14] from above
[1:32:16] he said so no man could save another if
[1:32:19] it would have been so
[1:32:20] jesus would have not had to die but when
[1:32:22] jesus
[1:32:23] died at calvary i love this
[1:32:26] he settled the sin question
[1:32:30] for as long as you're doing good
[1:32:34] for as long as you're looking good for
[1:32:37] as long as you're smelling good
[1:32:39] no no no no he settled the sin question
[1:32:42] help me now forever
[1:32:46] the price was paid not partially
[1:32:50] but completely it was so met that god
[1:32:54] identified that it was true
[1:32:58] now the only thing we have to do is
[1:33:00] receive this
[1:33:02] it's to accept this it's to believe it
[1:33:05] and accept it
[1:33:06] but no matter how much that he died for
[1:33:08] salvation we must ourselves
[1:33:10] accept it look here as our
[1:33:15] own personal
[1:33:20] experience i'm speaking to all kinds of
[1:33:23] people
[1:33:24] from all kinds of church backgrounds
[1:33:27] from all kinds of backgrounds
[1:33:30] i may be preaching to the church and the
[1:33:32] unchurched
[1:33:33] but i want to say to those who worship
[1:33:36] around the message
[1:33:38] the great truth that god gave to brother
[1:33:40] branham and that we've received by his
[1:33:42] grace i want to say to you
[1:33:44] you must like every other citizen
[1:33:48] like every other creature you must
[1:33:51] have a personal experience with
[1:33:54] jesus christ for yourself
[1:33:58] it's not enough to say i'm identified
[1:34:01] with that church
[1:34:02] i'm identified with that prophet i'm
[1:34:05] identified with that pastor
[1:34:07] i'm identified with that truth you must
[1:34:10] be
[1:34:10] identified with the lord jesus christ
[1:34:14] he is the giver of salvation he is
[1:34:17] yeshua
[1:34:18] he is yeshua he is the lord jesus christ
[1:34:21] his name
[1:34:23] means save us save us
[1:34:27] and he has how many of you are glad he
[1:34:29] has
[1:34:30] we must accept it as our own personal
[1:34:33] experience
[1:34:34] our own desire oh yes mama can't desire
[1:34:37] it for you
[1:34:38] and get it to you you have to come to a
[1:34:41] place
[1:34:42] where you desire it of yourself but i'll
[1:34:44] tell you what mama can do
[1:34:45] she can pray like a mighty woman of god
[1:34:49] i'll tell you what daddy can do he can
[1:34:51] turn his face to the wall
[1:34:53] and cry out for you so that you will one
[1:34:56] day
[1:34:57] realize that there's a gift waiting for
[1:35:00] you
[1:35:01] got your name on it waiting on you
[1:35:04] hallelujah but you've got to come
[1:35:06] and receive it for yourself we must
[1:35:08] water be saved and believe that upon the
[1:35:09] basis of his shed blood
[1:35:11] that we are saved after we have met the
[1:35:13] requirements of the bible
[1:35:14] he said i believe in the bible being the
[1:35:16] full
[1:35:17] revelation oh
[1:35:21] so much could be said he said i believe
[1:35:24] in the bible
[1:35:26] being the full revelation of jesus
[1:35:28] christ
[1:35:29] he said now i do believe that god can do
[1:35:31] things that's not written in the bible
[1:35:32] because he's god but as long as we can
[1:35:36] find it in the bible as a promise
[1:35:37] then we know it's true because the word
[1:35:40] is true always
[1:35:41] and so we believe him to keep his
[1:35:42] promise how many of you believe
[1:35:44] he keeps his promise i want to say this
[1:35:47] again and then i'm moving on
[1:35:49] i want to say that it's the abc's
[1:35:53] it's a simple to come to christ
[1:35:56] is as simple as abc you must accept
[1:36:00] that there has been a way made for your
[1:36:03] salvation
[1:36:05] in order to do that you've got to see
[1:36:07] that the world
[1:36:08] that that society that men and women
[1:36:10] fall short
[1:36:12] of the glory of god no matter how good
[1:36:14] we try to be
[1:36:15] we fall short of the glory of god we can
[1:36:18] never get it all right by ourselves
[1:36:21] so we recognize we just keep falling
[1:36:23] short and falling short
[1:36:25] even like the generation that noah
[1:36:26] preached to nothing good among us
[1:36:30] evil everywhere it's darkness trying to
[1:36:34] swallow us up
[1:36:35] and we find out that there's a god above
[1:36:37] who loves us who created us
[1:36:40] who placed us here who did not make a
[1:36:42] mistake
[1:36:43] who allowed us to be born in the hour
[1:36:45] that he wanted us to be born
[1:36:47] we are not here by mistake we are not
[1:36:50] here by happenstance
[1:36:52] we are not here by chance we are here at
[1:36:55] this time
[1:36:56] because it was ordained of god for us to
[1:36:59] be born at this time
[1:37:00] we must recognize that a way has been
[1:37:02] made for us to come out of darkness
[1:37:05] into his marvelous light we must
[1:37:07] recognize that a way has been made
[1:37:09] for us to trade our unrighteousness for
[1:37:12] his
[1:37:14] hallelujah our unrighteousness
[1:37:18] for his righteousness
[1:37:21] what a trade can anybody give god thanks
[1:37:26] why the trade i give god my
[1:37:29] trying i give god my striving
[1:37:33] i give god my failing and he gives me
[1:37:37] his uprightness
[1:37:38] he said it's a free gift everything that
[1:37:40] god has required of us
[1:37:42] he has provided for us if we can accept
[1:37:45] it as our own
[1:37:46] so you've got to see yourself not as
[1:37:48] just a part of a fallen society
[1:37:51] but you've got to see your own self
[1:37:53] fallen
[1:37:54] lost without light without god
[1:37:57] then you discover by the preaching of
[1:38:00] the word
[1:38:00] by a testimony some even by a track
[1:38:04] that was handed to them or dropped on
[1:38:06] the ground somewhere
[1:38:07] they discovered that a way has been made
[1:38:11] to satisfy the longing that you didn't
[1:38:14] understand in your heart
[1:38:15] for a better life for a better way in
[1:38:17] that good news
[1:38:19] no under the gospel it's called good
[1:38:21] news
[1:38:22] it's the vast news you'll never get any
[1:38:25] news like this
[1:38:26] on fox news or newsmax or cbn or cbs
[1:38:30] or any of the other abbreviations
[1:38:33] you'll never get this kind of news this
[1:38:35] is the good news the best
[1:38:37] news that there's ever been shared and
[1:38:40] that is a way has been made
[1:38:42] and that was not just a blanket cast
[1:38:45] that was god looking for you
[1:38:47] he didn't just throw out a net and that
[1:38:48] was thrown but he didn't just throw out
[1:38:50] a net
[1:38:51] he targeted your life he targeted your
[1:38:55] life
[1:38:56] he knew you before the foundation of the
[1:38:58] world help me somebody
[1:39:00] help me somebody he knew you before the
[1:39:03] foundation of the world and he came
[1:39:05] looking for you
[1:39:06] because in his foreknowledge he saw that
[1:39:09] you were going to choose him
[1:39:11] and he knew the only way to make that
[1:39:13] reality was he had to present himself to
[1:39:15] you
[1:39:16] he had to show up in your i want to say
[1:39:19] awful life
[1:39:20] because if we're living one without him
[1:39:24] it's awful it's miserable
[1:39:28] if i could just have a new car if i
[1:39:29] could just get me a bigger house
[1:39:31] if i just had a better job
[1:39:35] we feel this way sometime in fact
[1:39:37] there's some men that say if i could
[1:39:39] just give me a different wife
[1:39:45] there ain't no woman good enough for you
[1:39:49] but the one he gave you
[1:39:55] there's no man good enough for you but
[1:39:57] the one god gave you
[1:39:59] you better teach your children the
[1:40:00] importance of making the right choice
[1:40:03] and sticking with that choice it's not
[1:40:05] always easy
[1:40:07] i tell you god can turn a miserable life
[1:40:09] an awful life a dark life into a
[1:40:11] glorious life
[1:40:12] he can if he's made to to welcome if
[1:40:14] he's made welcome if you just open up
[1:40:16] your heart
[1:40:16] you recognize your need you accept that
[1:40:19] he is the waymaker that he is the way
[1:40:22] out
[1:40:24] he steps into the darkness he steps into
[1:40:26] the heartache
[1:40:27] he steps into the problem and he says i
[1:40:30] want to make a way for you
[1:40:32] oh you didn't even know he was seeking
[1:40:33] for you
[1:40:35] there he was on the bar stool next to
[1:40:37] you
[1:40:38] wooing you barry showed up at a drug
[1:40:42] house for some of you
[1:40:43] wooing you come on there you were ready
[1:40:47] to take your life
[1:40:48] and jesus showed up you may not have
[1:40:51] seen him but he was there
[1:40:53] watching over your foolishness
[1:40:57] guarding you from making a decision that
[1:40:59] you would regret
[1:41:01] in everlasting punishment come on now
[1:41:04] he showed up when you weren't seeking
[1:41:07] him
[1:41:08] i often talk about the testimony of my
[1:41:10] great-grandmother she
[1:41:12] she said i wasn't even praying
[1:41:15] i wasn't even looking for him and he
[1:41:19] reached down and
[1:41:20] saved me how is that possible because he
[1:41:25] knew
[1:41:25] that she would choose him before she
[1:41:29] ever knew there was a choice to be made
[1:41:32] [Applause]
[1:41:34] hallelujah before you ever knew you had
[1:41:38] a choice to make
[1:41:40] he knew what your choice would be and he
[1:41:42] came looking for you
[1:41:44] looking for you looking for you he saw
[1:41:47] you
[1:41:47] in those dark places he saw you even in
[1:41:50] those moments when you thought nobody
[1:41:52] could see you
[1:41:53] nobody knew what you were doing jesus
[1:41:56] was looking for you
[1:41:57] sister jeffrey sings a song sometime he
[1:42:00] was seeking
[1:42:02] for me for me
[1:42:06] because we understand that no man has
[1:42:08] sought god at any time
[1:42:09] of his own will if you've ever sought
[1:42:12] god
[1:42:13] it was because god was looking somewhere
[1:42:15] for you
[1:42:16] and you met in the middle because you
[1:42:18] had a desire stirred up in your life i
[1:42:20] got to hurry
[1:42:21] i've got to move on i want to move
[1:42:23] hallelujah you got to accept
[1:42:25] you've got to believe that it's going to
[1:42:27] make a difference
[1:42:29] by your faith somebody said i got to
[1:42:32] believe it's going to make a difference
[1:42:33] you do
[1:42:34] because you are not justified by what
[1:42:36] you say
[1:42:41] you are not justified by what you do
[1:42:44] your works don't justify you your words
[1:42:48] don't justify you
[1:42:49] it's your faith it's your faith
[1:42:53] that justifies you i'm a little ahead of
[1:42:55] myself here
[1:42:58] romans 10 9 that if thou shalt confess
[1:43:01] with thy mouth
[1:43:02] the lord jesus and shall believe in thy
[1:43:06] heart that god hath raised him from the
[1:43:07] dead
[1:43:08] thou shalt be saved there it is except
[1:43:12] a believe be
[1:43:16] confess see the abcs

[1:43:30] to be and i'm going to obey him right

[1:43:47] i've prepared plenty for this morning we
[1:43:50] haven't got there yet
[1:43:51] but i realized that we had expanded the
[1:43:54] audience this morning
[1:43:55] and in order to expand the audience i
[1:43:57] wanted those who are listening those who
[1:43:59] might happen by this
[1:44:00] i wanted them to know that a way has
[1:44:02] been made
[1:44:04] i wanted them to know that we're not
[1:44:05] saved by association
[1:44:07] we're saved by a personal relationship
[1:44:10] with jesus christ
[1:44:12] come on we're not saved by following
[1:44:14] some steps
[1:44:15] making some promises vowing some vows
[1:44:19] we're only saved by a personal
[1:44:20] relationship with jesus christ
[1:44:22] he said now we understand also that god
[1:44:24] is perfected in threes now god is
[1:44:26] perfected in three
[1:44:28] grace is five seven is completion like
[1:44:30] the world
[1:44:31] god is perfected in father son and holy
[1:44:33] ghost that's the perfection of the
[1:44:35] godhead or one god
[1:44:37] in three manifestations or three
[1:44:39] attributes of one office
[1:44:41] or three offices in the one god head
[1:44:43] that's it
[1:44:45] that settles it no three people
[1:44:49] no three persons one god
[1:44:53] one spirit manifested
[1:44:56] in three offices or in three attributes
[1:45:00] or in three manifestations but not
[1:45:04] three persons this is by one spirit
[1:45:08] the spirit that was in the eternal
[1:45:09] father he is
[1:45:11] a spirit the spirit that was in our lord
[1:45:13] jesus christ
[1:45:14] same spirit the spirit that fell on the
[1:45:17] day of pentecost
[1:45:18] same spirit but in another manifestation
[1:45:22] it had to be so it had to be so
[1:45:25] why because god wasn't satisfied to
[1:45:27] dwell above us
[1:45:29] he wasn't satisfied to just walk with us
[1:45:32] near us
[1:45:32] in the body of the lord he wanted to
[1:45:34] come and live inside
[1:45:36] of the believer and that is secured by
[1:45:39] the new birth
[1:45:40] by the new birth not part of the new
[1:45:42] birth
[1:45:44] not part of the new birth you're still
[1:45:45] here not part of the new birth
[1:45:48] all of it all of it now there's also
[1:45:51] three
[1:45:52] in perfection in steps of grace to the
[1:45:55] church
[1:45:55] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:45:58] the holy ghost i want to
[1:45:59] i wanted to say that this morning again
[1:46:02] because i want you to understand that
[1:46:03] the new birth
[1:46:05] is not complete
[1:46:09] without all three manifestations of
[1:46:13] grace
[1:46:14] in the life of the believer
[1:46:17] justification
[1:46:20] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:46:24] same god same grace secures it
[1:46:29] but perfected in three
[1:46:33] separate works of god's great
[1:46:37] grace in our lives he didn't just
[1:46:40] love us enough to justify us he loved us
[1:46:43] enough to clean us
[1:46:45] to sanctify us to purify us
[1:46:48] to purge us he loved us enough to fill
[1:46:52] us
[1:46:53] with himself and put us in action
[1:46:57] he said that consists of the new birth
[1:46:59] i'm not going to read it all
[1:47:00] just this part just like a natural birth
[1:47:03] is typed by it
[1:47:04] there are three that bear record in
[1:47:05] heaven the father the word
[1:47:08] and what else that was the son and the
[1:47:11] holy ghost
[1:47:12] these three are one there are three that
[1:47:15] bear witness in the earth
[1:47:16] the water the blood the spirit water
[1:47:19] blood
[1:47:20] and spirit these three agree
[1:47:23] in one i said i wasn't going to read it
[1:47:26] all but i
[1:47:27] i changed my mind now the father son and
[1:47:29] holy ghost are one
[1:47:31] you can't have you can't have the father
[1:47:34] without having the son you can't have
[1:47:37] the son
[1:47:37] without having the holy ghost but you
[1:47:40] can be
[1:47:41] justified without being sanctified
[1:47:44] you can be sanctified without being
[1:47:46] filled with the holy ghost we've proved
[1:47:48] that
[1:47:48] in the order of nature it takes all
[1:47:51] three works of grace
[1:47:55] not to be justified justification is one
[1:47:58] of the three
[1:47:59] it takes all three demonstrations
[1:48:02] or manifestations of god's great grace
[1:48:05] in our life
[1:48:06] to give us a born-again experience so if
[1:48:08] you're hearing me today here
[1:48:10] in this room or beyond and you have only
[1:48:13] been justified thank god
[1:48:16] that you have accepted the lord
[1:48:19] called on his name and allowed his blood
[1:48:22] to justify you but don't you
[1:48:24] dare stay there allow him to wash you
[1:48:28] i i gotta hurry i got to hurry
[1:48:33] let me see where i can go here romans
[1:48:37] chapter 8
[1:48:38] beginning in verse 28 are you still with
[1:48:41] me do i have a few more minutes
[1:48:44] i hope i do or i hadn't gotten anywhere
[1:48:46] yet
[1:48:48] i don't know exactly how long we've been
[1:48:50] going romans 8 28 and we know that all
[1:48:53] things somebody say with me all things
[1:48:55] work together for good to them that love
[1:48:58] god
[1:48:59] to them who are the called according to
[1:49:01] his purpose
[1:49:02] for whom he did for know he also did
[1:49:05] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:49:08] image of his son
[1:49:09] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:49:12] many brethren
[1:49:13] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:49:16] he also called
[1:49:17] whom he called them he also justified
[1:49:21] and whom he justified them he also
[1:49:24] glorified
[1:49:25] i love this next verse it
[1:49:28] seems to be the punctuation
[1:49:32] it seems to be the exclamation
[1:49:35] on what paul has just talked about these
[1:49:38] demonstrations of god's work in your
[1:49:40] life
[1:49:40] for knowledge predestination the call
[1:49:43] being justified
[1:49:44] later being glorified here is the
[1:49:46] exclamation point
[1:49:47] on that verse moreover i mean excuse me
[1:49:50] what
[1:49:50] shall we then say to these things
[1:49:55] you win me what shall we then say
[1:49:59] about these things being called being
[1:50:02] justified being glorified being
[1:50:04] having god being in god's foreknowledge
[1:50:07] if god be for us
[1:50:12] somebody ought to shout have god
[1:50:15] before us who
[1:50:20] what what circumstance
[1:50:24] what demon of darkness what fallen angel
[1:50:28] what awful circumstance what
[1:50:31] famine what bill collector
[1:50:34] oh if god be for us who can be against
[1:50:38] us if god is working for
[1:50:42] you there is nothing that can come
[1:50:45] against you
[1:50:46] somebody said wait a minute i get things
[1:50:47] come against me all the time yeah you do
[1:50:49] but they don't overcome you they don't
[1:50:52] overtake you
[1:50:53] they don't stop you on the way because
[1:50:56] greater
[1:50:57] is he that is in me than he that is in
[1:51:00] the world
[1:51:02] because i have somebody not only with me
[1:51:05] as we sung the old hymn but i have
[1:51:07] somebody in me
[1:51:09] whoa hallelujah
[1:51:13] hallelujah i won't take the time to go
[1:51:17] through
[1:51:17] some of these things but i'll tell you
[1:51:20] we were told
[1:51:21] by the servant of the lord that if you
[1:51:23] don't have this born-again experience
[1:51:26] you cannot properly discern the kingdom
[1:51:29] of god
[1:51:30] you can't properly discern the things of
[1:51:32] god
[1:51:33] you can't properly understand the
[1:51:35] purposes
[1:51:36] of god the ways of god the plans of god
[1:51:40] in your life with just a piece of the
[1:51:42] birth
[1:51:43] with just a phase of the birth with just
[1:51:46] a two-thirds manifestation of the birth
[1:51:49] you've got to come all the way through
[1:51:51] justification sanctification
[1:51:53] and the glorious baptism of the holy
[1:51:54] ghost i want you to understand
[1:51:57] in romans chapter five look there with
[1:51:59] me just a moment
[1:52:01] hallelujah i know you're tired
[1:52:05] i might be if i thought about it a
[1:52:06] minute but i'm not going to think about
[1:52:07] it
[1:52:08] verse 1 romans 5 therefore
[1:52:12] being justified
[1:52:15] by
[1:52:24] oh hallelujah
[1:52:28] you don't get this in the natural
[1:52:31] therefore
[1:52:33] being justified by
[1:52:36] faith we have peace
[1:52:39] with god through our lord
[1:52:43] jesus christ how
[1:52:46] are we justified
[1:52:50] you know how this became a revelation
[1:52:53] the church went from the day of
[1:52:56] pentecost it went up
[1:52:58] up it multiplied by the power of god
[1:53:03] multitudes came to faith we read in the
[1:53:06] acts of the holy spirit through the
[1:53:08] apostles
[1:53:09] that god did a glorious thing and added
[1:53:11] to the church daily
[1:53:13] such as should be saved miracles
[1:53:16] signs wonders as the truth of god's love
[1:53:20] spread beyond the region out over
[1:53:23] the over the seas carried by boats and
[1:53:27] ships
[1:53:27] carried by angelic messengers
[1:53:31] it began to reach through those church
[1:53:34] ages
[1:53:35] it was going up but i want you to know
[1:53:38] that
[1:53:40] there was a time that we understand
[1:53:43] the dark ages where truth was almost
[1:53:46] lost the persecution of the religious
[1:53:51] the religious did the persecuting
[1:53:56] it wasn't the persecution of the
[1:53:58] religious
[1:53:59] it was the persecution of the righteous
[1:54:02] by the religious
[1:54:04] it caused the dark ages it drove the
[1:54:07] church in back
[1:54:08] into the caves it drove the church back
[1:54:11] into the canyons
[1:54:12] into the hills into the secret places
[1:54:16] almost to be wiped out but god would
[1:54:19] never
[1:54:19] allow himself to be left on planet earth
[1:54:23] without a witness of who he is
[1:54:26] and so even through the dark ages there
[1:54:29] was a bride
[1:54:31] you read over there in the book of acts
[1:54:33] it talks about i greet you
[1:54:34] you from you you from the church in
[1:54:37] babylon
[1:54:38] i said oh if there was a bible believing
[1:54:41] church in babylon
[1:54:42] there ought to be one in your city
[1:54:46] yeah because babylon was nothing but
[1:54:49] confusion
[1:54:50] still is today but god allowed there to
[1:54:54] be a pocket
[1:54:56] i might preach he allowed there to be a
[1:55:00] pocket of believers
[1:55:02] who would not bend who would not
[1:55:05] bow who would not give in
[1:55:09] they held on to their faith in jesus
[1:55:12] christ
[1:55:13] you know the story during the anointing
[1:55:16] of the ox age
[1:55:17] you know how so many of them went to the
[1:55:20] to the coliseum
[1:55:25] to the persecution they went
[1:55:29] as food for lions
[1:55:32] fed to the sharks
[1:55:36] they were crucified upside down
[1:55:41] skinned alive oh
[1:55:44] we could go on and read of those who
[1:55:45] were persecuted
[1:55:47] during those dark days and yet we don't
[1:55:50] read of a fearful people no siree
[1:55:54] we read of a people who were so
[1:55:56] persuaded let me
[1:55:58] how persuaded are you
[1:56:01] how persuaded are you of your personal
[1:56:04] experience
[1:56:05] with jesus christ these men and women
[1:56:07] were fully
[1:56:08] persuaded they went all the way to the
[1:56:11] stake
[1:56:12] they went all the way to the fire they
[1:56:14] went all the way to their death
[1:56:16] singing
[1:56:20] nudging one another let me go next
[1:56:31] we're fearful of a little bit of
[1:56:33] persecution
[1:56:35] we're fearful of what might happen if we
[1:56:38] break an order
[1:56:39] or if we do something that we're not
[1:56:41] asked that we're being asked not to do
[1:56:43] by someone above us in authority we're
[1:56:45] fearful of what we might pay
[1:56:47] what price we might pay we're fearful
[1:56:49] that there might be locks on the door
[1:56:51] we're fearful of what might actually
[1:56:53] happen but i want you to know these men
[1:56:55] and women of god
[1:56:56] were fully persuaded there was no fear
[1:56:58] in them that didn't mean they didn't
[1:57:00] have fear in their life
[1:57:01] it means they learned how to deal with
[1:57:02] the fear when it would try to rise up
[1:57:04] they learned how to reach in
[1:57:10] you don't do that with a halfway
[1:57:12] persuasion you only do that with a full
[1:57:15] persuasion
[1:57:16] and they said let me go next no no no no
[1:57:18] let me go next no no no no let me go
[1:57:20] next
[1:57:21] we have the testimonies of how they
[1:57:23] cried out in the flames giving praise to
[1:57:26] god
[1:57:27] singing the high praises of the lord
[1:57:30] somebody in church doesn't speak to us
[1:57:32] and we pout six months
[1:57:37] yet there's some of you sitting here
[1:57:38] this morning you never make an effort to
[1:57:40] speak to me unless i come to you
[1:57:43] but i'm still right here this morning to
[1:57:46] do my duty
[1:57:47] to do what god has called me to do don't
[1:57:50] you let anything or anybody keep you out
[1:57:52] of your place
[1:57:53] you come to god fully persuaded
[1:57:56] of everything that he is
[1:58:00] don't you let anybody darken what you
[1:58:02] know to be the truth
[1:58:04] you hold on to that with everything you
[1:58:06] have because you may need it
[1:58:08] more in the future then you need it now
[1:58:12] but then there came a message the church
[1:58:15] was ruling and reigning
[1:58:17] that roman catholic system was abounding
[1:58:20] and i'll tell you it was cheating people
[1:58:23] cheating them offering them a false
[1:58:26] gospel
[1:58:28] hello telling them if you'll drop a few
[1:58:31] pennies in the coffer
[1:58:32] you'll spring your loved ones their soul
[1:58:35] will fly from purgatory to heaven
[1:58:40] that wasn't some little you know little
[1:58:42] off
[1:58:43] doctrine somewhere it was what the
[1:58:45] majority of people believed to call
[1:58:47] themselves
[1:58:48] christian or followers of christ they
[1:58:50] all were a part of that system in that
[1:58:52] they accept
[1:58:53] those believers that were hiding over
[1:58:54] there for their lives because the church
[1:58:56] was trying to kill them you know that to
[1:58:58] be the truth can you say amen
[1:59:00] you know that to be the truth and
[1:59:03] so it was only by the grace of god that
[1:59:06] they were able to survive
[1:59:07] because there were those who began to
[1:59:09] say wait a minute this couldn't be right
[1:59:11] first of all there's no purgatory in the
[1:59:12] bible
[1:59:14] second of all didn't the blood of jesus
[1:59:16] pay the pride what am i having to do
[1:59:18] and and and didn't the bible tell us as
[1:59:20] the tree falls it lies
[1:59:22] what would make me think that there's
[1:59:24] another place for my loved one to hang
[1:59:26] out
[1:59:26] until somebody pays the preacher
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:32] then they go flying off somewhere in
[1:59:34] heaven this was the acceptable doctrine
[1:59:36] of the day
[1:59:37] but there was a beer drinking lutheran
[1:59:39] priest
[1:59:43] no he was a catholic priest he was a
[1:59:46] german
[1:59:48] he had no understanding of god's love
[1:59:50] for the jews
[1:59:53] he believed that the church had fully
[1:59:56] replaced israel and that all the jews
[2:00:00] would forever be damned
[2:00:02] because they crucified our lord
[2:00:06] and yet god was reaching for a man
[2:00:12] like martin luther i don't know why god
[2:00:16] uses the man he does
[2:00:20] i don't know why god doesn't uh you know
[2:00:23] perfect the man and then use him
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:28] except for the fact that imperfect
[2:00:30] people could never relate to him
[2:00:35] if there was a perfect prophet as a
[2:00:39] not as a servant of god but as a man who
[2:00:42] could relate to him
[2:00:44] if there was any men on the earth or
[2:00:47] ever worked in ministry on the earth
[2:00:48] that were perfect in all other ways
[2:00:51] never made a mistake never fail never
[2:00:53] let somebody down
[2:00:54] never fail to be what someone wanted or
[2:00:56] needed them to be
[2:00:57] there would be nobody who could relate
[2:00:58] to a perfect
[2:01:01] that's all i know so we found a martin
[2:01:04] luther
[2:01:06] i tell you martin luther struggled if
[2:01:08] you've ever read the writings the
[2:01:10] musings of
[2:01:11] martin luther in the agony of his little
[2:01:15] what you could call a cell in the agony
[2:01:18] of his little hut
[2:01:19] little place where he where he lived as
[2:01:21] a priest
[2:01:23] he would cry out believing that he was
[2:01:25] forsaken
[2:01:26] believing there was no salvation
[2:01:28] believing there was no hope for him
[2:01:30] he was a tormented man but
[2:01:33] god chose a man like that
[2:01:36] to use him to take a church age that was
[2:01:40] so dark a truth
[2:01:43] so nearly lost that it had to be
[2:01:46] restored
[2:01:48] are you with me and he found a
[2:01:50] hard-headed little monk
[2:01:53] like martin luther and he began to deal
[2:01:56] with him
[2:01:58] martin luther spent time in the
[2:01:59] confessional like everybody else
[2:02:01] he spent time climbing the steps of the
[2:02:04] of the chapel on his bloody knees
[2:02:06] begging for repentance begging for mercy
[2:02:09] paying a price
[2:02:10] for his own sins like everybody else did
[2:02:12] in that day
[2:02:15] he perhaps said the hail mary's and did
[2:02:17] all the other things
[2:02:18] that that his fellow priests would
[2:02:21] require of him
[2:02:22] so that he could feel good about himself
[2:02:26] and one day in his tormented condition
[2:02:29] he's trying to pay the price for some
[2:02:32] more of his mess
[2:02:35] perhaps climbing the steps at the very
[2:02:38] moment some say
[2:02:40] trying to pay the price so god would
[2:02:42] accept him
[2:02:43] and he's reading his bible as he goes
[2:02:47] and all of a sudden hear me well the
[2:02:50] holy spirit of god
[2:02:51] so loved the world so loved martin
[2:02:53] luther
[2:02:54] so loved those people bound by that
[2:02:56] religious system that was taking them to
[2:02:58] hell
[2:03:01] i need a little help god so loved the
[2:03:04] earth
[2:03:05] but he said i can't let it go into total
[2:03:07] darkness
[2:03:09] it's time to start building back the
[2:03:13] light
[2:03:15] well i'm glad i'm so glad and all of a
[2:03:18] sudden martin luther's going along
[2:03:19] romans 5 1 therefore being justified by
[2:03:26] faith
[2:03:30] reading these scriptures about being
[2:03:32] justified not by paying penance
[2:03:38] but by faith in the work of the cross
[2:03:42] through the lord jesus christ whoa
[2:03:45] he said what am i doing here
[2:03:48] paying for my own sin
[2:03:52] what a foolish man i am to think that i
[2:03:55] could take away
[2:03:56] my own sin guiltiness
[2:04:00] by jumping through the hoops like a
[2:04:03] little trained puppy dog
[2:04:05] who am i to think that i could touch a
[2:04:07] savior
[2:04:09] by trying to do things on my own when i
[2:04:11] am now justified by faith i wish
[2:04:13] somebody would help me
[2:04:16] justified by faith just
[2:04:19] if i'd never sinned whoa
[2:04:22] it means to make or render right or just
[2:04:26] to hold as guiltless to accept and
[2:04:29] pronounce as righteous
[2:04:30] it means to be held acquitted to be
[2:04:34] cleared of all
[2:04:35] charges to stand approved
[2:04:38] and to stand accepted
[2:04:41] hallelujah you're not working to be
[2:04:44] accepted
[2:04:45] you're accepting god's gift
[2:04:48] in faith to be accepted
[2:04:52] there are no accusations that can stick
[2:04:53] against you if there's anything in your
[2:04:56] life that needs to be made right stay
[2:04:58] before the lord
[2:04:59] let him give you another demonstration
[2:05:01] of grace let god sanctify you
[2:05:03] let him clean up your life let him fill
[2:05:06] you with the holy ghost and fire
[2:05:08] don't ever stop moving toward him

[2:06:05] the bed

[2:06:26] matters you can ask the precious holy
[2:06:29] spirit to come
[2:06:30] and sanctify your dream life
[2:06:34] if he tries to bring you back under a
[2:06:35] spirit that you've come out from under
[2:06:37] because of things you've watched because
[2:06:39] of things you've seen in the past
[2:06:41] that you have already repented of if the
[2:06:43] enemy tries to bring that to your memory
[2:06:45] by troubling you in the night
[2:06:46] by pulling that out of the recesses of
[2:06:48] your brain and putting you in the middle
[2:06:50] of that again you have help
[2:06:52] you have hope you have deliverance
[2:06:56] if you'll just call on the name of the
[2:06:57] lord if you've repented of your sin
[2:07:00] he has put that in the sea of
[2:07:01] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before
[2:07:03] god
[2:07:04] if you believe that same man some here
[2:07:06] this morning must not believe it

[2:07:20] people would quit talking about there
[2:07:21] only being one book
[2:07:24] i wish you could see this your name is
[2:07:27] now in the new book
[2:07:29] not the book of life
[2:07:33] but the lamb's book of life
[2:07:37] what the lamb redeemed how many of you
[2:07:39] believe you're in that book
[2:07:41] if you believe you're in that book put

[2:07:44] interactive class
[2:07:46] well i believe it now your name is
[2:07:50] not it's now in the new book not the
[2:07:51] book of life but the lamb's book of life

[2:07:58] bride hallelujah your new life

[2:08:04] marriage certificate hallelujah
[2:08:07] where your true eternal germ from the
[2:08:09] beginning takes hold
[2:08:11] now you're not only forgiven but you're
[2:08:13] what
[2:08:14] justified glory justified romans 5 1
[2:08:17] therefore being justified by faith he
[2:08:20] said look up the word it doesn't mean
[2:08:22] forgiven
[2:08:26] you need to know that when you look up
[2:08:29] the word justified
[2:08:30] in the greek lexicon you will not find
[2:08:33] the word forgiveness
[2:08:35] you will not find the word forgiven
[2:08:38] it's not there it means something else
[2:08:42] he said the word means justified it
[2:08:45] don't mean
[2:08:46] you're forgiven for instance and here's
[2:08:49] a very carnal
[2:08:50] example but i love it he said for
[2:08:52] instance you heard i got drunk and done
[2:08:54] some evil things and everything
[2:08:56] and then you come around and say to me
[2:08:58] you found out i
[2:08:59] i didn't do them and then you come
[2:09:02] around and say brother branham
[2:09:04] i forgive you forgive me
[2:09:07] i didn't do it at the first place see
[2:09:12] how would you like somebody forgiving
[2:09:13] you for something you never did
[2:09:17] that was a lie brother bannon said they
[2:09:19] just accused me of that
[2:09:21] that wasn't true i knew i didn't do it
[2:09:23] in the first place and here you come in
[2:09:25] so sweet
[2:09:28] you get it don't you that's why we
[2:09:30] needed somebody to break it down for
[2:09:32] us you come around so sweet oh brother
[2:09:36] brother shelley i forgive you for what
[2:09:40] well i know i know in a weak moment it
[2:09:42] sounds like that you
[2:09:43] went out and got drunk
[2:09:49] i'd be lying if i told you the thought
[2:09:51] never crossed my mind
[2:09:57] but i must tell you the truth i didn't
[2:09:58] do it
[2:10:01] so i don't need you to forgive me for
[2:10:03] getting drunk
[2:10:04] and doing a bunch of ugly stuff cause i
[2:10:07] wasn't drunk
[2:10:08] i didn't do a bunch of ugly stuff while
[2:10:10] i was drunk
[2:10:11] so your forgiveness is sweet of you but
[2:10:14] i don't need it
[2:10:17] let me be forgiven for something i've
[2:10:18] done
[2:10:21] cut me loose for something i did do
[2:10:24] not hold it on don't forgive me for
[2:10:26] something i didn't do he said well
[2:10:28] forgive me
[2:10:28] i didn't do it in the first place
[2:10:33] now if i did do it i'm guilty but you
[2:10:36] could forgive me and i wouldn't be
[2:10:38] guilty but yet i'm not justified because
[2:10:41] i actually done it
[2:10:43] he said if i did it then i gotta you can
[2:10:46] forgive me and that's nice i'll be
[2:10:47] forgiven of you for you
[2:10:49] from you but i still have to be
[2:10:51] justified for that
[2:10:52] but the word justified is though you've
[2:10:55] never done
[2:10:55] it the word justified is though you've
[2:10:58] never done it
[2:11:00] i tell you i don't think this is a
[2:11:02] museum for saints
[2:11:04] i think there's somebody in this room
[2:11:06] that ought to be mighty
[2:11:08] mighty thankful for this truth
[2:11:11] even though we may have it down already
[2:11:13] it's a good reminder
[2:11:16] you've never done it he said amen
[2:11:19] it's not even regarded at all how it's
[2:11:21] done
[2:11:22] if god's in god's book of the sea of
[2:11:25] forgiveness your old book in marriage is
[2:11:27] divorced and dead
[2:11:28] it's not even in the memories of god
[2:11:33] what sin are you talking about he said
[2:11:35] amen you're justified therefore being
[2:11:37] justified
[2:11:38] it was accused you was accused you never
[2:11:40] done it in the first place
[2:11:42] the old union is in the sea of god's
[2:11:44] forgiveness you wasn't married to it to
[2:11:45] begin with the bridegroom bore your
[2:11:47] shame
[2:11:48] himself for you in your place he took
[2:11:50] your place
[2:11:51] for you were predestinated for him to be
[2:11:53] in his bride before the foundation of
[2:11:55] the world the bible said so you are the
[2:11:56] predestinated seed
[2:11:58] i'm going to praise god for you
[2:12:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:04] hallelujah
[2:12:07] i did have to ask i did have to accept
[2:12:11] i did have to believe i did have to
[2:12:13] confess
[2:12:14] but when i did he justified me
[2:12:18] galatians 2 16 and 17 no one but a man
[2:12:21] it's not justified by the works of the
[2:12:23] law
[2:12:30] i recently got a email from
[2:12:34] someone
[2:12:37] who's a part of the hebrew roots
[2:12:38] movement
[2:12:40] who identifies in the messianic faith
[2:12:43] i like that i don't have no problem i
[2:12:46] love so many things because it's our
[2:12:48] foundation the bible the old testament
[2:12:50] that's our foundation now when you go
[2:12:53] trying to live by a law like that and
[2:12:55] and and forfeit what grace is doing
[2:12:59] i'd say that man and woman is a foolish
[2:13:01] person
[2:13:02] how could you forfeit what god has done
[2:13:05] to think you can go back like martin
[2:13:06] luther
[2:13:08] and pay your own way by how you keep a
[2:13:11] day
[2:13:12] or how you keep a feast don't you let
[2:13:15] that get ahold of you
[2:13:17] i remember saying one time to some who
[2:13:19] who visited through here
[2:13:21] uh for many many many years
[2:13:24] some who even came to tell us that the
[2:13:26] apostle paul was a false
[2:13:28] had was a false teacher and we shouldn't
[2:13:30] believe what he said we should go back
[2:13:31] to the torah only and
[2:13:33] all the different things that we have
[2:13:35] heard through the years well someone
[2:13:36] that i hadn't heard from in quite a
[2:13:38] while reached out to me recently
[2:13:39] and said that they had now received the
[2:13:41] revelation that we should not only keep
[2:13:43] the feast and not only
[2:13:44] keep the shabbat and not only use only
[2:13:46] hebrew names when we refer to god and
[2:13:48] jesus
[2:13:49] and so forth but in all actuality
[2:13:52] polygamy is part of the old covenant
[2:13:56] and he was also interested in perhaps
[2:13:59] taking on another couple of wives
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:08] i wrote him back and i said while you're
[2:14:10] at it you better get two or three more
[2:14:11] jobs
[2:14:17] because if you're going to have two or
[2:14:18] three more wives you're going to need
[2:14:19] two three more jobs
[2:14:26] what god allowed in another covenant in
[2:14:29] another period
[2:14:31] is not necessarily what you need to be
[2:14:33] reaching for
[2:14:34] in this hour especially a man who can't
[2:14:38] disciple the one wife that he has
[2:14:41] if you can't raise the children you have
[2:14:43] you don't need any more
[2:14:45] if you can't minister to the family that
[2:14:47] god has given you it doesn't need to
[2:14:48] keep growing
[2:14:51] no extra charge for that
[2:14:55] it's just the truth i said brother why
[2:14:57] in the world would you they
[2:14:59] well because it's going to be that way
[2:15:01] in eternity
[2:15:02] and so i'm going to practice for
[2:15:04] eternity
[2:15:06] and i told him that he needed to settle
[2:15:08] in salt lake
[2:15:14] because he wasn't just leading back to
[2:15:16] the roots of the bible
[2:15:18] he was leading right off of what god has
[2:15:20] provided for us
[2:15:21] in this hour it's a dangerous journey a
[2:15:24] man like that
[2:15:25] it's about to embark on come on now
[2:15:29] and this is how we are sometime we
[2:15:32] really are this way sometime
[2:15:34] thinking that we can be justified by the
[2:15:36] works of the law
[2:15:38] thinking that we can do what the priest
[2:15:40] said and feel better about ourselves at
[2:15:42] the end of the day
[2:15:43] but here the scripture said clearly
[2:15:45] knowing that a man is not justified by
[2:15:47] the works of the law
[2:15:48] but by the faith the faith of jesus
[2:15:51] christ
[2:15:52] even we have believed in jesus christ
[2:15:54] that we might be justified by the faith
[2:15:55] of christ
[2:15:56] and not by the works of the law for by
[2:15:58] the works of the law
[2:15:59] shall no flesh be justified galatians 3
[2:16:04] 24 the next chapter
[2:16:06] he said wherefore the law was our
[2:16:07] schoolmaster to bring us
[2:16:09] unto christ that we might be justified
[2:16:13] by
[2:16:15] faith by faith
[2:16:19] by faith by faith
[2:16:22] let me give you just a little more in
[2:16:24] close
[2:16:27] first thessalonians chapter five are you
[2:16:29] are you able to
[2:16:30] sit for just a little while longer just
[2:16:32] a little while longer
[2:16:34] first thessalonians 5 23 and the very
[2:16:37] god of peace
[2:16:41] sanctify you
[2:16:47] sbm holy
[2:16:51] not just h-o-l-y w-h-o-l-l-y
[2:16:56] holy the very god of peace sanctify you
[2:17:01] holy
[2:17:02] and i pray god your whole
[2:17:06] spirit and soul
[2:17:09] and body be preserved blameless
[2:17:14] unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
[2:17:18] now when brother random was talking
[2:17:20] about justification
[2:17:22] he said it took a messenger like luther
[2:17:26] and in the message the countdown how
[2:17:28] many of you remember the message the
[2:17:29] countdown
[2:17:30] he takes these three restored truths
[2:17:35] justification sanctification
[2:17:38] the baptism of the holy ghost and he
[2:17:41] types them
[2:17:42] to transportation anybody remember
[2:17:47] he said justification was luther's
[2:17:50] message
[2:17:51] and that was the horse and buggy day
[2:17:56] but he said along came a man by the name
[2:17:59] of john
[2:18:00] wesley and john
[2:18:04] wesley received a message that was
[2:18:07] not to cancel justification
[2:18:10] which was luther's message it didn't
[2:18:13] cancel it it didn't acknowledge it
[2:18:17] it didn't cause it to expire
[2:18:20] but wesley's revelation of
[2:18:23] sanctification laid on top
[2:18:27] of the foundation of luther's
[2:18:30] revelation of justification
[2:18:34] justification by faith sanctification
[2:18:37] by the blood and by the washing of the
[2:18:39] water of the word
[2:18:41] he said so wesley's age
[2:18:46] was like the automobile
[2:18:52] was a little more advanced
[2:18:55] than the horse and buggy whoo
[2:19:01] it might have had to been crunk
[2:19:07] i know it amazes me how we will still
[2:19:10] say to this day i've got to go crank the
[2:19:12] car
[2:19:14] i've never cranked a car in my life i
[2:19:17] think i did one time in a museum it
[2:19:19] didn't work
[2:19:20] it was just for to show people what it
[2:19:21] was like
[2:19:23] i never had a car that i had to crank
[2:19:25] and yet we still say
[2:19:26] i've got to go out and crank my car but
[2:19:28] i want you to know
[2:19:29] when an automobile came along a
[2:19:31] horseless carriage i'm telling you that
[2:19:33] was a far
[2:19:34] advance from the horse and the buggy
[2:19:37] whoo don't you know people were glad now
[2:19:40] they might not have been glad when only
[2:19:41] the elite and the aristocrats could
[2:19:43] drive them but why when they begin to be
[2:19:45] available when used cars come out that's
[2:19:48] what made them available to everybody
[2:19:49] else
[2:19:50] when people discarded them for something
[2:19:51] new then more people got to be apart
[2:19:55] and they got to enjoy them more right
[2:19:59] brother random talking about the three
[2:20:00] manifestations of grace justification
[2:20:03] under luther sanctification under wesley
[2:20:05] then he said the baptism of the holy
[2:20:06] ghost
[2:20:08] now let me let me remind you who studied
[2:20:10] this message let me remind you
[2:20:12] that he said in the restoration of the
[2:20:14] gifts there is no messenger needed
[2:20:20] interesting he said in the restoration
[2:20:23] of the gifts
[2:20:24] there is no messenger needed
[2:20:28] you see we have a messenger to laodicea
[2:20:32] but the restoration of the gifts is what
[2:20:34] gave birth to laodicea
[2:20:36] it was in the beginning of laodicea and
[2:20:38] laodicea the last church agent needed a
[2:20:41] messenger
[2:20:41] but there was no need of a messenger
[2:20:45] for the restoration of the gifts does
[2:20:48] anybody remember why he said there was
[2:20:50] no need for one
[2:20:52] he said because the holy ghost came
[2:20:56] himself
[2:21:00] if luther is the messenger of
[2:21:02] justification
[2:21:03] and wrestling is the messenger of
[2:21:06] sanctification
[2:21:06] who then is the messenger of the
[2:21:09] restoration of the games he said the
[2:21:10] holy ghost
[2:21:14] himself our joshua
[2:21:20] now yes there was a messenger needed to
[2:21:22] finish
[2:21:24] laodicea one who would come
[2:21:27] to tie together the loose sins of all
[2:21:30] the other ages
[2:21:31] i'm not saying anything to take away
[2:21:33] from that i'm just telling you you don't
[2:21:35] need a representative
[2:21:39] when the holy ghost comes himself and
[2:21:42] the prophet of god tells us that azusa
[2:21:43] street the holy ghost came himself
[2:21:46] he just stepped right into the people
[2:21:47] hallelujah whoa
[2:21:49] glory be to god aren't you thankful for
[2:21:52] the holy ghost
[2:21:54] now we won't get to that today but i
[2:21:57] thought i'd want to throw that in
[2:21:59] we'll get to that next sunday but let me
[2:22:02] get this to you here
[2:22:04] the very god of peace sanctify you holy
[2:22:06] and i pray god your whole spirit
[2:22:08] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[2:22:11] unto the coming of the lord jesus christ
[2:22:13] that word holy there is completely
[2:22:16] a complete salvation one that cleanses
[2:22:20] the spirit the soul and the body of man
[2:22:25] the body the soul and the spirit of man
[2:22:29] john 17 17 is the key it's red letters
[2:22:33] in a red letter bible because it's the
[2:22:35] words of our lord jesus christ
[2:22:37] it is his prayer on our behalf
[2:22:40] to the father he prays sanctify them
[2:22:44] i'm going to wait for us to see that
[2:22:47] because it's such a
[2:22:48] a precious short little verse john 17
[2:22:51] 17 sanctify them
[2:22:55] through thy truth
[2:22:58] thy word it's truth
[2:23:02] how are we sanctified by the word
[2:23:06] by the truth what does the word sanctify
[2:23:09] mean
[2:23:10] it means to set aside something
[2:23:13] to separate something from its
[2:23:16] environment
[2:23:18] it means to consecrate it means to
[2:23:20] cleanse
[2:23:21] it means to purify it means to dedicate
[2:23:24] something
[2:23:25] and here's what i want you to hear it
[2:23:28] means to regard
[2:23:30] and to reverence something as
[2:23:33] holy
[2:23:36] when the word of truth sanctifies you
[2:23:39] it sets you apart from your environment
[2:23:44] it makes you a core chosen
[2:23:47] clean sanctified consecrated
[2:23:51] dedicated vessel you have to cultivate
[2:23:56] that
[2:23:57] you have to pursue it you have to run
[2:23:59] after it
[2:24:01] but you don't do the sanctifying
[2:24:08] you say well i quit wearing this i quit
[2:24:10] doing that i quit doing this i quit
[2:24:12] doing the other
[2:24:13] oh yeah praise god you did
[2:24:16] you should have if you did it because
[2:24:20] the holy spirit was speaking conviction
[2:24:22] to your life
[2:24:23] you should have some of you need some of
[2:24:26] that
[2:24:28] some of you here today need some of that
[2:24:30] some of you watching this
[2:24:31] need some of that you need to yield
[2:24:34] to the sanctifying work of the word of
[2:24:36] god by the holy spirit
[2:24:38] in our life we need to separate
[2:24:40] ourselves not only from evil
[2:24:43] but from the very appearance of evil
[2:24:48] because you've got a testimony at stake
[2:24:51] it's all you have i wish you'd help me i
[2:24:53] know it's late
[2:24:55] i know i'm wearing you out
[2:24:58] let's take a little nap if you need to
[2:25:00] i'm giving you permission
[2:25:03] you can go home watch the rest of this
[2:25:04] this afternoon
[2:25:07] we need the work of the holy spirit
[2:25:10] to sanctify us
[2:25:14] we need him to help us to continue to
[2:25:16] walk in integrity
[2:25:19] and in modesty in a world of excess
[2:25:25] the world is engorging itself
[2:25:30] swelling its own self up in
[2:25:33] its own pride in its own accomplishments
[2:25:36] and what can be worked by the flesh
[2:25:39] and the church of jesus christ could
[2:25:42] easily fall victim
[2:25:44] to such a kind of spirit as that jesus
[2:25:47] wants to be your
[2:25:48] priority he wants to be
[2:25:52] the one you love the most the one you
[2:25:55] seek to please the most
[2:25:57] can anybody say amen
[2:26:00] let me give you just a few verses here
[2:26:02] to write down
[2:26:04] so that you can look at this later but i
[2:26:06] i will read them quickly first
[2:26:07] corinthians 6 11.
[2:26:08] and such were some of you you read it
[2:26:11] you read chapter six
[2:26:13] you'll hear what he's talking about but
[2:26:15] in verse 11 he says and such were some
[2:26:17] of you
[2:26:18] but ye are washed but ye
[2:26:21] are sanctified but ye
[2:26:24] are justified in the name
[2:26:27] of the lord jesus and by the spirit
[2:26:30] of our god how many of you think that
[2:26:33] sounds good
[2:26:34] ephesians 5 25 through 27
[2:26:37] husbands love your wives even as christ
[2:26:40] also loved the church and gave himself
[2:26:43] for it
[2:26:44] that he might sanctify
[2:26:48] and cleanse it with the washing of
[2:26:52] water by the word
[2:27:00] ephesians 5 26 that he might
[2:27:04] sanctify and cleanse it
[2:27:10] with the washing of the water by the
[2:27:12] word
[2:27:14] that he might present it to himself
[2:27:18] a glorious church
[2:27:21] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[2:27:25] thing
[2:27:26] but that it should be holy and without
[2:27:28] blemish
[2:27:30] how many of you have ever spent time
[2:27:34] ironing something that is
[2:27:38] made of a material easy to wrinkle
[2:27:44] for instance linen
[2:27:48] you almost ought to give up
[2:27:52] there's only so much you can do in linen
[2:27:55] looks nice when it's ironed it looks
[2:27:58] crisp
[2:27:59] ten minutes later collars limp
[2:28:04] unless you starch it and you start
[2:28:06] leaning and let me
[2:28:07] show you what you get you'll get a shiny
[2:28:10] mess
[2:28:13] you sit down you get up if you've got on
[2:28:17] a dress the whole cedar
[2:28:18] dress and all the way down if you've got
[2:28:20] on the shirt the the
[2:28:21] tail of your shirt if it's a like these
[2:28:24] guy barrow or these shirts they wear out
[2:28:28] made of fine material like that you put
[2:28:31] it on and 10 minutes later it's
[2:28:33] already wrinkled that's how you and i
[2:28:36] would be without his help we would iron
[2:28:39] it up
[2:28:40] and wad it up iron it up
[2:28:43] wrinkle it up it's the nature of the
[2:28:46] material
[2:28:48] but i want you to know it's not up to us
[2:28:52] it's not up to us to get wrinkle-free
[2:28:56] it's not up to us to get blemish-free
[2:29:00] it's up to us to accept the work that
[2:29:03] has been done on our behalf
[2:29:05] the precious blood of jesus cleanses us
[2:29:07] from all sin
[2:29:09] let me show it to you hebrews 13 12
[2:29:12] wherefore jesus also that he might
[2:29:14] sanctify the people what
[2:29:18] with his own blood
[2:29:24] wherefore jesus also that he might
[2:29:26] sanctify the people with his own blood
[2:29:28] suffered without the gate so we are
[2:29:30] sanctified by the word
[2:29:32] by the washing of the water of the word
[2:29:35] by the precious blood of jesus christ
[2:29:37] which is the word
[2:29:42] i want to read just a couple of portions
[2:29:45] of
[2:29:46] messaging clothes we won't get to the
[2:29:49] holy ghost
[2:29:51] but we'll finish this paragraph 109
[2:29:55] questions and answers stay with me
[2:29:59] you said now watch i'm gonna take this
[2:30:01] little bottle
[2:30:03] it's laying out here in the chicken yard
[2:30:06] we talked about this tuesday night
[2:30:09] and it's full of filth i pick it up
[2:30:13] that's justification
[2:30:17] it's just laying out there in the ark
[2:30:19] got all kind of gunk on it
[2:30:21] you forgot it you left it laying out
[2:30:23] there now gunk is in it and on it
[2:30:26] you pick it up it's just a messy old
[2:30:28] bottle
[2:30:30] when you pick that up that's like god's
[2:30:32] picking you up
[2:30:33] out of the mire of sin help me
[2:30:37] finding you over there in the pig pen
[2:30:39] somewhere picking you up out of that and
[2:30:41] saying i'm going to use the sinner
[2:30:44] he said i'm going to use this sinner and
[2:30:46] the next thing i do if i'm going to use
[2:30:48] it
[2:30:48] he said i'll have to cleanse it
[2:30:52] and then if i cleanse it what do i do to
[2:30:54] it sanctify
[2:30:56] it he said the word sanctify made means
[2:30:59] clean
[2:31:01] same thing as holy holy is the hebrew
[2:31:03] word sanctifies the greek word
[2:31:05] the word sanctify means clean and set
[2:31:08] aside
[2:31:09] for service but then this will be next
[2:31:12] week but then blessed are they that
[2:31:15] hunger
[2:31:16] and thirst for righteousness for they
[2:31:18] shall
[2:31:19] be filled then they're put in service
[2:31:23] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:31:26] picked up out of the mire justified
[2:31:30] scoured out by the water of the word
[2:31:32] that's sanctified
[2:31:34] filled up a vessel to drink out of
[2:31:37] a vessel of service a vessel to be used
[2:31:41] you've got to have something to give
[2:31:44] that old bottle can't serve you empty
[2:31:47] it's got to be filled with something
[2:31:49] what have we been filled with
[2:31:50] the precious power of the holy ghost the
[2:31:53] very life of jesus christ
[2:31:55] in questions and answers on the holy
[2:31:57] ghost paragraph 42
[2:31:58] my dear methodist brother see the method
[2:32:02] is under wesley
[2:32:04] big on the message of sanctification
[2:32:06] once upon a time
[2:32:07] now they laid their died easter eggs on
[2:32:09] the altar at easter
[2:32:11] but once upon a time once upon a time
[2:32:14] they were about
[2:32:15] sanctification are you with me he said
[2:32:18] pilgrim wholeness and nazarene
[2:32:21] the baptism of the holy ghost is
[2:32:22] different from sanctification
[2:32:24] he said sanctification is the cleansing
[2:32:28] which is preparation of life but when
[2:32:31] the holy ghost comes
[2:32:33] it is life
[2:32:36] preparation is cleaning the vessel the
[2:32:39] holy ghost is filling the vessel
[2:32:41] sanctification means clean and set aside
[2:32:44] for service the holy spirit is what put
[2:32:47] it in service you are a vessel
[2:32:49] that god has cleaned up how many of you
[2:32:51] are thankful
[2:32:52] for the sanctifying work so that we can
[2:32:55] then be filled
[2:32:59] one last straight as the gate
[2:33:04] and how he could take that
[2:33:07] same blood from the body
[2:33:11] he gave as a sacrifice
[2:33:15] and sanctify a people that himself
[2:33:18] might live in
[2:33:23] i'm gonna read it again you're rushing
[2:33:26] me
[2:33:28] how he could take that same blood
[2:33:32] from the body that he gave as a
[2:33:34] sacrifice
[2:33:35] and sanctify a people that himself
[2:33:40] might live in brother steve that's right
[2:33:43] continue his work to the end
[2:33:47] of the consummation how could we
[2:33:50] possibly continue the work
[2:33:52] until the consummation unless we're
[2:33:54] cleansed
[2:33:57] unless we're filled with the life of
[2:34:00] jesus christ
[2:34:02] he said oh god wake up people
[2:34:05] wake people up to see that
[2:34:08] grant it save everyone that raised their
[2:34:11] hand
[2:34:11] cleanse their hearts lord my hands are
[2:34:14] up cleanse me oh lord
[2:34:17] he said this is a house of correction
[2:34:22] how many of you recognize that's part of
[2:34:24] the work of the holy spirit
[2:34:26] to make the church of the living god a
[2:34:28] house
[2:34:29] of correction it doesn't always feel
[2:34:32] good it doesn't always make you happy
[2:34:36] but oh how wonderful it is to know that
[2:34:38] the holy ghost is among us this morning
[2:34:40] doing his work he said this
[2:34:43] is a place where we should be washed
[2:34:47] let the holy spirit wash us this morning
[2:34:50] and cleanse us from the corruption
[2:34:54] lord this is our prayer let the
[2:34:58] musicians make their way
[2:34:59] to the platform and help us if you will
[2:35:02] this is our prayer
[2:35:08] this is our heart's desire
[2:35:13] if you're still streaming the service
[2:35:15] thank you for sticking with us
[2:35:17] if you're streaming on facebook or
[2:35:20] perhaps youtube or something just put in
[2:35:22] a comment of where you're from we want
[2:35:25] to know
[2:35:26] where you're watching some have done it
[2:35:28] already
[2:35:30] we want to know where you're watching we
[2:35:31] want to somehow be a blessing to you we
[2:35:34] want to know
[2:35:35] just how far this little extra effort
[2:35:37] this morning has reached
[2:35:40] i want you to know this morning you may
[2:35:42] say well brother shelly i was
[2:35:43] justified 40 years ago and then
[2:35:47] sanctified
[2:35:49] i remember the night that god dealt with
[2:35:51] me about my life and he began to help me
[2:35:53] to set things in order
[2:35:55] and then he filled me with the holy
[2:35:57] ghost and fire and i've been
[2:35:59] okay i've been all right ever since i
[2:36:01] don't doubt that
[2:36:02] because the word of god is right and
[2:36:04] it's true and i believe that god has
[2:36:06] done that in your life
[2:36:07] even as he did it in my life he filled
[2:36:10] me with the baptism of the holy ghost in
[2:36:13] 1975
[2:36:15] i got the real one i got the right one
[2:36:19] because i received him as as he is
[2:36:22] in my faith as a little child he filled
[2:36:25] me with his spirit
[2:36:27] but he continues to refill me
[2:36:31] he continues to scour me out
[2:36:34] i still need to be reminded of the
[2:36:36] demonstration of god's grace in my life
[2:36:39] through justification i still need to be
[2:36:41] reminded
[2:36:42] of the demonstration of god's grace in
[2:36:44] my life through
[2:36:46] sanctification i still need to be
[2:36:48] reminded
[2:36:49] of god's demonstration his manifestation
[2:36:51] of grace in my life
[2:36:53] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:36:55] it's because of that
[2:36:57] that my eyes have been anointed with i
[2:37:00] salve
[2:37:01] that i could see the living word of god
[2:37:03] for my day
[2:37:04] for my hour for my generation it's his
[2:37:07] grace that called us out
[2:37:09] of of both bondage and slavery to sin
[2:37:13] and then bondage and slavery to religion
[2:37:16] and brought us to the truth of god's
[2:37:18] word but we need
[2:37:20] the continual cleansing help me now
[2:37:24] we need a continual refilling and how do
[2:37:27] we get it we get it by fellowshipping
[2:37:29] his word
[2:37:30] we get it by coming into his presence
[2:37:32] not just in the house of god
[2:37:34] but even in our home we come into his
[2:37:37] presence when we think on him
[2:37:39] when we begin to worship him we were
[2:37:42] working in the yard yesterday
[2:37:45] and uh i have a little speaker
[2:37:48] that i just got that i can put my phone
[2:37:51] inside of it
[2:37:54] and and to keep it from getting so hot
[2:37:56] in the sun
[2:37:58] because a lot of times if i'm playing
[2:37:59] music and i leave it laying out there it
[2:38:01] gets so hot it
[2:38:02] it'll shut off and have to take it in
[2:38:04] the house and cool it down but this
[2:38:06] little
[2:38:06] this little speaker is a box you open it
[2:38:08] up you put it in and somehow it helps
[2:38:10] keep it cool too
[2:38:11] it didn't overheat all day and it was
[2:38:12] surely in the sun
[2:38:14] and i began to listen to some old gospel
[2:38:18] songs
[2:38:19] and i just got happy
[2:38:23] my wife was busy doing what she was
[2:38:25] doing mariah was busy doing what they
[2:38:27] were doing
[2:38:27] and i just got up and danced
[2:38:30] i just got up and danced it's my yard
[2:38:37] and the neighbors have seen a lot
[2:38:40] i didn't gonna scare them
[2:38:43] i've got a sabbath-keeping neighbor on
[2:38:45] one side of me and she don't like a
[2:38:46] whole lot of activity on saturday
[2:38:48] but i couldn't help it
[2:38:55] it just got good and i couldn't help it
[2:38:58] and i didn't care
[2:38:59] i didn't even bother me that nobody knew
[2:39:01] what i was doing
[2:39:03] that was a long time before anybody ever
[2:39:06] saw me
[2:39:08] i was they were occupied finally mariah
[2:39:11] looked over at me and she said
[2:39:17] i know what she was saying oh dad
[2:39:21] but i cannot help it
[2:39:24] i can't be still sometimes i can't i
[2:39:27] don't know how you do it i don't know
[2:39:29] how
[2:39:29] i do not know how some of you sit on
[2:39:32] your hands
[2:39:35] when you start thinking about what he
[2:39:38] has
[2:39:39] done for our lives
[2:39:43] i don't mean to break any kind of order
[2:39:45] but i tell you i
[2:39:47] can't help but just shout it out praise
[2:39:50] god for the grace
[2:39:53] that has justified us sanctified us
[2:39:58] filled us with the baptism of the holy
[2:40:00] ghost completing the new birth
[2:40:04] so that we can go on personal experience
[2:40:07] with god listen
[2:40:08] your birth is not my birth
[2:40:12] you had your own natural birth i had my
[2:40:14] own natural birth
[2:40:18] your spiritual birth is yours
[2:40:21] mine is mine i had my own experience
[2:40:25] with god you
[2:40:27] had your own experience with god and if
[2:40:29] you're listening to me today and you
[2:40:30] haven't
[2:40:31] you need to find a place you need to
[2:40:33] turn your face toward the king of kings
[2:40:36] and call on him and stay there until you
[2:40:39] know that he has heard your prayer
[2:40:41] and that he has heard your cry and
[2:40:44] received your faith
[2:40:46] and poured out a demonstration of his
[2:40:48] grace in your life
[2:40:49] to justify you to set you free to
[2:40:51] sanctify you to fill you with the
[2:40:53] baptism of the holy ghost will you stand
