[0:12] there's a promised land untouched by a
[0:14] man
[0:15] prepared for the safe and blessed a city
[0:18] built for a square far away
[0:20] somewhere has a home for the saints to
[0:22] rest
[0:23] so many have tried but they couldn't
[0:26] describe all the beauties on that bright
[0:28] shore
[0:29] forts never entered into the heights of
[0:32] me
[0:32] what the father has in store well i can
[0:35] sing about heaven for a million years
[0:38] never get the story told but the jasper
[0:42] was in the gates of pearl
[0:44] and the streets made up here gold he
[0:46] forgot the revelator in a heavenly
[0:49] vision
[0:49] could never really say what he saw and i
[0:52] could sing about heaven for a million
[0:55] years
[0:55] still not i could never tell
[0:57] [Music]
[1:13] pure and sweet and it flows by the tree
[1:17] of life on its way to the crystal sea
[1:21] and the precious stones that the walls
[1:23] rest on
[1:24] are of twelve different times the night
[1:27] will cease for the prince of peace
[1:30] is the life that ever shies well i can
[1:33] sing about heaven for a million years
[1:36] never get the story told jasper walls
[1:40] and the gates of earth and the streets
[1:42] made up here
[1:43] gore even got the revelator in a
[1:46] heavenly vision
[1:47] he'd never really say what he saw and i
[1:50] could sing about heaven for a million
[1:52] years
[1:53] still i could never tell it all even
[1:56] shot the revelator in the heavenly
[1:58] vision
[1:58] could never really say what he saw and i
[2:01] could sing about
[2:02] heaven for a million years still i could
[2:05] never tell it all
[2:08] [Music]
