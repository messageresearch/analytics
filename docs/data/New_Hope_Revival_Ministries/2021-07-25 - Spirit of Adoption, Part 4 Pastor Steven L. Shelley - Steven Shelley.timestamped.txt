[28:30] the lord
[28:31] you may have your seats today
[28:36] i don't generally
[28:39] have you to sit down but i just want to
[28:42] you all have been praying so faithfully
[28:44] for us as we were gone and i just give
[28:47] you a quick update of
[28:49] what we know
[28:50] and uh
[28:52] we went up to be a a blessing to joyce's
[28:55] sister to try to take care of joyce's
[28:57] mother
[28:58] who is
[28:59] bedridden
[29:01] and
[29:03] had
[29:04] good days with her
[29:06] while we were up there
[29:08] i spoke last sunday morning for dad at
[29:11] his church
[29:12] and
[29:13] he
[29:14] on the way home
[29:16] there was a wreck
[29:17] on the way to his home
[29:19] and they turned them around wouldn't let
[29:21] them go up
[29:22] and so mom and dad went to have a little
[29:24] lunch while they were having lunch dad
[29:27] started to
[29:28] uh have some
[29:31] shakes and other
[29:33] kind of symptoms
[29:34] and by the time that he got home he was
[29:38] he was shaking and and breathing hard he
[29:40] sat down to take a nap
[29:42] and
[29:43] he
[29:44] uh just got all
[29:47] emotional and mom had to help him to
[29:49] settle down he settled down
[29:51] uh and and seemed to be breathing easier
[29:54] and when i went up the next day of
[29:56] course he was breathing very hard again
[29:59] and uh
[30:01] he had the knee operation and mom kept
[30:03] saying that his knee was hot so we
[30:05] checked and of course it was warm to the
[30:07] touch and then i touched his forehead it
[30:09] was warm he had a temperature and we got
[30:12] him in the hospital and all of this
[30:13] through the week that we were there all
[30:15] week with him and and he's
[30:18] on heavy doses of antibiotics just
[30:22] no person ought to have to go through it
[30:25] uh but we're believing the lord to bring
[30:28] him through that this knee is going to
[30:29] be okay that he's not going to have to
[30:31] have anything done with that need the
[30:33] infection we're decreeing that the
[30:35] infection is leaving his body he's
[30:37] having an awful time with the catheter
[30:39] and we're believing that that is going
[30:41] to be all right as well so
[30:43] uh
[30:44] on top of that last sunday afternoon
[30:48] dad's song leader we told you that his
[30:50] wife had just had open heart surgery
[30:53] and
[30:54] last sunday afternoon their son came to
[30:56] visit his mama and he had been to church
[31:00] at a large church not far away and
[31:03] they're having an outbreak of
[31:04] coronavirus and on monday he woke up
[31:07] with symptoms tuesday diagnosed with the
[31:10] he tested and found out that he had uh
[31:13] indeed the virus along with all of his
[31:16] family and so
[31:18] we're believing god to keep our sister
[31:21] who has just come through open-heart
[31:22] surgery that she will not be affected by
[31:25] this
[31:26] and of course they had to shut down
[31:28] their service this weekend because of uh
[31:31] increase so i think that we as a body
[31:35] need to be careful and pray and believe
[31:38] god to keep that thing away from us
[31:41] we're uh i already know that it isn't
[31:44] very far up the road
[31:46] i already know it i've got a call this

[48:41] oh
[48:45] we did that for the lord but i'd like to
[48:48] say take that you dirty devil
[48:52] you're defeated today
[48:53] [Music]
[48:55] he is defeated in the name of the lord
[48:57] jesus christ
[48:59] you may be seated
[49:01] he is uh
[49:02] fighting us in electronics
[49:06] i believe there's a demon
[49:09] that of electronics
[49:11] i'm gonna have to think of a name for
[49:12] him
[49:13] but i believe that that that's whatever
[49:16] it is it's uh uh trying to attack
[49:19] uh three things that are vital
[49:22] to what we needed this morning yesterday
[49:25] i worked for about an hour and uh
[49:28] on my laptop no problems never had a
[49:30] problem with it it's three years old
[49:33] and i
[49:35] put it in sleep mode and put it down and
[49:37] did some other things and came back to
[49:39] it and it wouldn't charge it wouldn't
[49:41] turn on it wouldn't do anything
[49:43] and hawk was
[49:45] available he came over here and helped
[49:47] me and we were with tech and we were
[49:48] with this and that and the other and uh
[49:51] i didn't put quite enough faith i wished
[49:53] i'd put i didn't take it serious enough
[49:55] i just said lord i know you could help
[49:57] me if you would
[50:00] i realize now that probably wasn't a
[50:02] faith-filled prayer was it
[50:04] lord i know you could if you would
[50:06] and so hawk asked me this morning if
[50:08] there had been a resurrection i said no
[50:10] but i just didn't put enough faith in it
[50:13] i know i just didn't didn't take it
[50:14] serious enough but that really threw me
[50:17] off on what i was preparing for tonight
[50:20] we get here and the drum brain is
[50:23] scrambled and we couldn't he couldn't
[50:25] get any settings he wasn't even sure if
[50:27] we'd be able to play this morning and we
[50:30] have got a solution back there for our
[50:33] for our projector computer
[50:35] and everything is working
[50:39] like a dream
[50:40] except for what i need this morning
[50:43] and they cannot get it pulled up and
[50:45] find it so those times that you didn't
[50:48] see words on the screen that's because
[50:50] they were working and they're trying but
[50:52] you know what god is good and you people
[50:55] just praised him anyway you clapped your
[50:57] hands and just shifted the atmosphere
[51:00] and i appreciate that so much and we
[51:03] just have to do that we just have to go
[51:05] on and give god praise
[51:07] and you know pastors get concerned
[51:10] knowing that so many are going to be
[51:12] missing but we're right at 70 this
[51:14] morning
[51:15] and i know there's all right at 25
[51:18] regulars who are traveling who are not
[51:21] here this morning
[51:22] and so you know what that it just looks
[51:24] good to me
[51:25] i know there's a lot of empty seats
[51:28] but like i told them on the way to
[51:29] church this morning i said but the ones
[51:31] that are going to be here they're going
[51:32] to be good ones
[51:34] not that those who are missing aren't
[51:36] good they're good too very good
[51:39] but you know sometimes it's it's quality
[51:42] instead of quantity
[51:44] and i knew that those of you who would
[51:46] be here today would make up your you'd
[51:49] praise any way and you'd say amen anyway
[51:51] and you'd clap anyway
[51:53] and so that's what it takes to create an
[51:55] atmosphere
[51:56] the lord is here and we believe that god
[51:58] is going to do something today we
[52:01] believe he's going to move for us this
[52:03] evening in lagrange
[52:04] and we're just asking the lord we've had
[52:06] several reach out to say that they were
[52:08] going to be in the service
[52:10] and we're looking forward to that
[52:12] and let me give you the uh
[52:15] i texted zach last night and told him to
[52:18] expect a bunch of text
[52:20] because i was going to give his number
[52:21] today and everybody was going to call
[52:23] him
[52:23] and find out what the address was
[52:26] but he said he was prepared he has it
[52:28] and he's ready
[52:30] um
[52:31] so they're traveling home today
[52:34] and uh we want to ask god to bring them
[52:36] all the way
[52:37] and uh so if you need the address
[52:40] uh it's the pentecostal church of
[52:42] lagrange
[52:44] 82
[52:45] chase
[52:46] road lagrange georgia
[52:50] 82 chase road
[52:52] lagrange georgia and you'll be able to
[52:56] find it and be with us in service there
[52:58] tonight if you have a desire to do that
[53:01] and then next friday night
[53:04] i was going to pull up a zip code so it
[53:05] would help you if you're putting it in
[53:07] your if you're putting it in your
[53:08] smartphone the zip code is 30241.
[53:13] 82 chase road to grange georgia
[53:17] 30241 and from the church it's 49
[53:21] minutes
[53:22] from my house it was uh 55 minutes so if
[53:25] you were to leave from the church you
[53:27] would be at the church in lagrange in 49
[53:29] minutes we're going to look to see some
[53:31] of you there
[53:32] brother curry has been in the hospital
[53:35] this week again
[53:37] and but god let him come home on
[53:39] thursday evening i believe it was
[53:42] and they're just wanting to stay on top
[53:44] of everything and we want them to do
[53:46] that until the miracle comes
[53:48] and we're still believing god we know
[53:50] that he is a creative god he is a healer
[53:54] he's a miracle worker
[53:56] and he can turn things around
[53:59] and uh
[54:00] all things are coming like they are for
[54:02] a reason we know the timing of
[54:04] everything you know as i sat here on the
[54:06] platform for a moment this morning i was
[54:09] able to see something that i hadn't seen
[54:11] before in the timing
[54:14] of the laptop going out i saw something
[54:16] and made a connection in this in my mind
[54:19] i believe by the spirit i made a
[54:21] connection i said well there's the
[54:23] timing that's why it happened
[54:25] the way it did and if we can do that and
[54:28] give god praise no matter what comes or
[54:30] goes then we're going to make it
[54:33] we're just going to make it
[54:35] and
[54:36] so anyway the drums sounded all right
[54:38] and we made it through
[54:40] and uh i see them toting computers
[54:42] around up there so they're trying to get
[54:44] something worked out but if worse comes
[54:47] to worse you can always go to the table
[54:49] this morning and follow along i like to
[54:52] have it up because people have written
[54:54] from all over the world and said you'll
[54:56] never know what it means to be able to
[54:58] see the scripture and the quote and the
[55:00] words but it just doesn't always happen
[55:02] that way
[55:03] and so anyway let's just make mention
[55:06] these things so we can get started here
[55:09] tomorrow i noticed would have been
[55:12] brother and sister heise's wedding
[55:14] anniversary and both of them are in the
[55:17] presence of the lord sister heichi left
[55:19] us this year
[55:21] and we want to remember the fact that
[55:25] god blessed their lives
[55:27] he gave them to us
[55:29] and we miss them
[55:32] we miss them
[55:33] when i am looking at memories you know
[55:35] every morning when i'm doing for uh
[55:37] facebook birthday greetings
[55:40] i usually check the memories real quick
[55:42] and you'd be surprised how many monday
[55:44] mornings sister heisi wrote on my wall
[55:46] pastor thank you for that message
[55:49] and i miss that i miss her i miss her
[55:52] amens i miss her reacting sometime out
[55:55] of place
[55:59] if you said anything that she just felt
[56:01] was sad she'd oh
[56:04] you just felt sorry for everybody didn't
[56:06] she and i miss her so much and uh so
[56:09] let's let's honor uh them in the memory
[56:12] of brother and sister hi c uh tuesday is
[56:15] sister rhonda shaw's birthday she is
[56:17] going to be 39 and a day or two beyond

[57:00] anniversary of brother and sister weems

[57:24] the lord is good there were prayer
[57:27] requests that came in that we didn't
[57:28] take time to mention this morning but
[57:30] some of them were urgent brother
[57:32] keith smith uh
[57:34] the widower of sister gladys he sent
[57:37] prayer requests in yesterday for for
[57:39] several and one that he asked to be
[57:42] confidential but it's urgent and we are
[57:45] uh believing that god will undertake uh
[57:49] leniel brother lenio yant sent me
[57:51] several notes yesterday especially while
[57:53] at the hospital he sent an inbox and he
[57:56] said pray brother shelly pray both lois
[57:59] and i have been diagnosed with covid
[58:01] they're getting up in years
[58:03] and uh there are uh
[58:05] as of last night there were over 70 who
[58:09] have been diagnosed in the happy valley
[58:11] church
[58:12] and uh that's a large church and there's
[58:14] a lot of visiting that goes on and we
[58:17] want to pray for them some of them will
[58:19] will come right through it and won't
[58:22] even won't even phase them but but
[58:25] others could possibly struggle a little
[58:27] bit because of their age and because of
[58:29] their conditions
[58:31] and we want to ask the lord to move he
[58:34] can move he the angel of the lord can
[58:36] step in there
[58:38] and any other group where those things
[58:40] are happening and we ask you as brother
[58:42] greeley mentioned just to watch your
[58:44] symptoms very carefully and if you feel
[58:46] like you are running a fever or you may
[58:49] have something
[58:50] that looks like that then you might want
[58:53] to to just do a little self-quarantine
[58:55] for a service or two
[58:57] and we would honor that and understand
[58:59] that and uh it's easier than than just
[59:02] saying
[59:03] all the seniors stay home i don't want
[59:05] to do that i need them
[59:07] i need their amens
[59:09] and

[59:13] send me texts and say pastor i want to
[59:15] come to church sister flo said please

[1:13:06] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:13:10] again to fear
[1:13:14] that is coveted
[1:13:16] cancer
[1:13:18] whatever else the circumstances might be
[1:13:21] we are children of the most high god and
[1:13:25] we've received many many benefits of the
[1:13:28] spirit but we have not received a spirit
[1:13:30] of bondage again to fear
[1:13:32] but ye have received
[1:13:35] the spirit of
[1:13:37] adoption
[1:13:40] chiropractor asked me this week what i
[1:13:42] was preaching i started telling him the
[1:13:44] different works of the holy spirit he
[1:13:46] said i've never heard of that i said
[1:13:47] well you need to hear about it that's in
[1:13:49] the word too
[1:13:50] i said i'll bring you a list in here so
[1:13:52] you can look it up he said what's the
[1:13:53] spirit of adoption whoo
[1:13:58] that's a good one whereby we cry
[1:14:02] abba
[1:14:03] father
[1:14:04] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:14:08] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:14:12] god
[1:14:13] praise the lord and if children then
[1:14:16] will you you say that
[1:14:18] heirs
[1:14:21] i want to know
[1:14:22] how many of you have never been left a
[1:14:24] thing in anybody's will hold up your
[1:14:26] hand
[1:14:28] look at there look at there
[1:14:33] that's just sad
[1:14:36] but here i want to tell you something
[1:14:38] you are an heir
[1:14:44] you are an heir of god
[1:14:48] and join heirs with jesus christ
[1:14:52] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:14:56] may be also
[1:14:58] glorified together are you still there
[1:15:02] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:15:05] present age are not worthy to be
[1:15:07] compared with the glory
[1:15:10] which shall be
[1:15:12] revealed in us
[1:15:14] let's say it this way which shall be
[1:15:17] revealed in me
[1:15:20] hallelujah glory shall be revealed in me
[1:15:26] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:15:29] creature waiteth
[1:15:32] for the manifestation
[1:15:34] of the sons of god
[1:15:37] for the creature was made subject to
[1:15:40] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:15:44] him who hath subjected the same
[1:15:48] in hope
[1:15:51] because the creature itself also shall
[1:15:55] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:15:56] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:16:00] the children of god for we know that the
[1:16:03] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:16:05] in pain together until now and not only
[1:16:09] they but ourselves also which have the
[1:16:13] first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:16:17] ourselves
[1:16:19] groan
[1:16:20] within ourselves
[1:16:22] waiting
[1:16:24] for
[1:16:24] thee
[1:16:27] waiting for the adoption to wit
[1:16:31] the redemption
[1:16:33] of our
[1:16:35] body
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:36] lord jesus we thank you today for every
[1:16:40] promise
[1:16:41] you have given us in your word
[1:16:44] as we sit under the inspiration of your
[1:16:48] presence
[1:16:49] we can see ourselves
[1:16:52] in the word
[1:16:54] we see ourselves in the promise
[1:16:57] we recognize that what you have promised
[1:17:00] your bride you have promised us
[1:17:04] and we may look at it as a future event
[1:17:08] but we thank you for the understanding
[1:17:11] that what is to come is already working
[1:17:14] in the children of god to bring the sons
[1:17:18] of god into manifestation in their hour
[1:17:22] and so we bless the name of the lord we
[1:17:25] bless
[1:17:26] your name we honor you for your goodness
[1:17:30] that follows us that chases us down
[1:17:35] we honor you
[1:17:36] that you actively pursue us to bless us
[1:17:41] with goodness and with abundant mercies
[1:17:45] lord bless our time together in the word
[1:17:48] today
[1:17:49] and move among us in the meeting tonight
[1:17:53] and we'll give you honor glory and
[1:17:55] praise in the name of the lord jesus
[1:17:57] christ we pray amen
[1:18:00] all the people of god just added another
[1:18:04] hearty amen you may be seated now we're
[1:18:07] three sermons in
[1:18:10] to the spirit of adoption we are ready
[1:18:12] to move
[1:18:14] next sunday to the spirit of holiness
[1:18:18] and there is so much to say
[1:18:21] we probably won't get that in one
[1:18:23] service either
[1:18:24] but when i was reflecting about whether
[1:18:27] to do a little more in the spirit of
[1:18:28] adoption or move to the spirit of
[1:18:30] holiness
[1:18:31] i felt like that we should linger just
[1:18:33] another day
[1:18:35] in this spirit of adoption because it's
[1:18:37] actively working in us there's only one
[1:18:40] holy spirit so when we receive the
[1:18:44] earnest of the spirit these things begin
[1:18:46] to work in us when we receive the
[1:18:49] baptism of the holy ghost then there is
[1:18:53] an activation of everything that lays
[1:18:56] within us potentially it's now
[1:18:59] an awakened seed the spirit of truth
[1:19:04] begins to operate in us the spirit of
[1:19:07] life
[1:19:08] begins to operate in us and the spirit
[1:19:11] of adoption begins to operate in us
[1:19:15] followed by the spirit of holiness the
[1:19:18] spirit of supplication
[1:19:21] and the spirit of grace
[1:19:24] all of these things begin to manifest in
[1:19:28] our lives one holy ghost with many
[1:19:31] different ministries
[1:19:33] many different
[1:19:34] administrations and you might even say
[1:19:37] office
[1:19:38] before we started this series on the
[1:19:41] seven offices that the holy ghost holds
[1:19:44] in our life we talked about the purpose
[1:19:47] of the holy ghost coming and we talked
[1:19:50] about conviction
[1:19:51] and we we contrasted the difference
[1:19:54] between
[1:19:56] the spirit of conviction at work in our
[1:19:58] life and and condemnation
[1:20:01] condemnation will leave you hopeless
[1:20:06] you will feel like there's no way to
[1:20:07] ever get free there's no way to ever get
[1:20:10] your head above the wave you're just
[1:20:12] doomed to be who you are broken
[1:20:16] individual not ever quite measuring up
[1:20:19] but when the spirit of conviction
[1:20:22] when when the spirit of holiness that
[1:20:24] we'll talk about next week when it
[1:20:27] begins to be activated in our life it
[1:20:30] brings a conviction that is the spirit
[1:20:33] of god just putting his finger on
[1:20:36] different things in our life that we
[1:20:38] need to tune up
[1:20:40] i don't know what we do without the holy
[1:20:42] ghost
[1:20:44] because there are so many wild spirits
[1:20:47] loose in the earth today
[1:20:51] who would have ever thought if you would
[1:20:53] have ever told me 25 years ago that
[1:20:57] there would be believers of this message
[1:21:00] doing yoga
[1:21:05] i would have told you you're losing your
[1:21:07] mind
[1:21:09] but there are so many
[1:21:12] wild spirits that are loosed in the
[1:21:15] earth today
[1:21:16] and if we are not actively oh it got
[1:21:19] quiet
[1:21:22] it is certainly not a bad idea for you
[1:21:24] to
[1:21:26] stretch but you better do a little
[1:21:29] research
[1:21:30] i don't care if it's hot yoga goat yoga
[1:21:34] i don't care what kind of yoga it is it
[1:21:38] is not holy ghost yoga
[1:21:42] but you stretch and you exercise and you
[1:21:44] do that that's fine but you don't have
[1:21:46] to pick up the heathen ways of this
[1:21:49] world
[1:21:50] to do it
[1:21:51] my my my i didn't expect to kick back in
[1:21:54] here
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:21:57] maybe that was a streamer hanging up on
[1:21:59] me
[1:22:00] but it felt like it was a whole lot
[1:22:02] closer to this pulpit than the stream
[1:22:04] i want to tell you something i never
[1:22:06] dreamed such wildness would get in among
[1:22:09] god's people as it's operating among the
[1:22:12] people today and that's why we got to
[1:22:14] have we have to have
[1:22:22] the holy ghost
[1:22:26] i've watched through the years there are
[1:22:27] certain ways someone can twist their
[1:22:29] hair or pull their hair to one side or
[1:22:33] do something some sister with their hair
[1:22:36] not even realizing that in that
[1:22:39] you may be projecting a spirit
[1:22:44] you don't say anything
[1:22:46] i don't felt him now
[1:22:49] it grieves my heart to see holy ghost
[1:22:53] filled people
[1:22:54] with
[1:22:55] duck lips
[1:22:58] it does it grieves me when i see saints
[1:23:02] of god posing with duck lips for the
[1:23:06] whole world to see
[1:23:08] because it's some kind of fad or some
[1:23:10] kind of fashion and i want you to know
[1:23:12] i'm talking to everybody you say well i
[1:23:15] think i've seen one of yours i'm telling
[1:23:17] you that's why i'm preaching the whole
[1:23:18] truth this morning
[1:23:20] because i want all the folks of god all
[1:23:23] the children of god to take a little
[1:23:24] note
[1:23:25] i want all of us to check up on our
[1:23:27] payment we have the greatest resource
[1:23:31] i'm telling you we have the encyclopedia
[1:23:34] of what pleases god living on the inside
[1:23:37] of us
[1:23:38] he's here by the holy ghost and if
[1:23:41] you'll lean on him he will prompt you
[1:23:46] just a minute amen brother
[1:23:50] he will put a steering wheel right in
[1:23:53] your inner man
[1:23:55] and he will direct you
[1:23:57] everybody can fall into a fashion
[1:23:59] everybody can fall into a fad everybody
[1:24:02] can fall into the stream but i want you
[1:24:04] to know if you let the holy ghost
[1:24:06] establish that steering wheel look at me
[1:24:08] now i'm preaching i'm not reading
[1:24:09] anything
[1:24:11] that that steering wheel that the holy
[1:24:13] ghost will put in here he will direct
[1:24:15] you and lead you if you find yourself
[1:24:18] falling into something if you'll lean on
[1:24:20] him he'll pull you back to the middle of
[1:24:23] the road this is this is the greatest
[1:24:25] thing that could ever happen to a man or
[1:24:28] a woman in history is to have the holy
[1:24:31] ghost living inside of them operating in
[1:24:35] them as the spirit of life as the spirit
[1:24:39] of truth as the spirit of adoption
[1:24:43] i don't want to get too far ahead of
[1:24:44] myself
[1:24:45] and we are so blessed because when the
[1:24:47] holy ghost comes and does the inner work
[1:24:51] he takes out the hopelessness that
[1:24:53] condemnation brings he takes out the
[1:24:55] guilt
[1:24:56] that not knowing sometimes we just don't
[1:24:58] know and we feel guilty that we don't
[1:25:00] know you don't have to feel guilty
[1:25:02] you've got the holy ghost in you he'll
[1:25:04] quicken truth to you
[1:25:06] he'll let you know how you ought to be
[1:25:08] doing come on now
[1:25:10] just remember we have a message where
[1:25:12] brother branham talked about splits in
[1:25:13] the skirts
[1:25:16] i hadn't forgot that
[1:25:18] i hadn't forgot that because he felt
[1:25:21] like and so do i that sometimes a spirit
[1:25:23] can get in that
[1:25:25] amen brother why i didn't think i'd have
[1:25:28] any any hindrances here this morning
[1:25:30] when it come to preaching truth like
[1:25:32] that we have the holy ghost i know i
[1:25:34] know some out there in the charismatics
[1:25:36] and pentecostals or i know they can't
[1:25:38] stand that
[1:25:40] i know they can't they've got all kinds
[1:25:42] of names to call that but you know
[1:25:44] believers bride believers we want
[1:25:46] everything that god has for us and if he
[1:25:49] don't want us to have it we don't want
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:52] amen we don't want anything that's
[1:25:55] rooted and grounded in something that's
[1:25:57] going to trouble us when we lay down to
[1:26:00] sleep at night or our children when they
[1:26:02] lay down to sleep at night we want peace
[1:26:04] in our homes
[1:26:06] amen that's why we've got to be careful
[1:26:08] about that channel any channel that we
[1:26:10] open up into our home because the enemy
[1:26:13] will take advantage of that
[1:26:16] but i'm thankful so
[1:26:18] thankful to know that the holy ghost is
[1:26:20] abiding on the inside this great work of
[1:26:23] adoption is taking place in us we are
[1:26:26] not brought in from another family and
[1:26:28] adopted but we are a part of this family
[1:26:31] from before the foundation of the world
[1:26:34] and we are being schooled and tutored
[1:26:37] and trained and matured and taught so
[1:26:40] that we can have the same announcement
[1:26:43] that was pronounced over the lord jesus
[1:26:45] christ not just at the baptism that was
[1:26:48] the beginning of the adoption process
[1:26:51] but on the mount of transfiguration the
[1:26:53] voice said more than i'm pleased to
[1:26:55] dwell in my son hear
[1:26:57] ye
[1:26:58] him
[1:26:59] hear what he has to say
[1:27:02] and there is a voice of authority that's
[1:27:05] being established in the bride of jesus
[1:27:08] christ that demons will not be able to
[1:27:12] withstand
[1:27:14] i'm telling you the voice of god's
[1:27:16] authority in you by the holy ghost will
[1:27:19] rout every demon
[1:27:22] and every foul spirit
[1:27:25] amen brother
[1:27:27] he'll send it on its way
[1:27:30] we need to have that holy ghost
[1:27:33] oh don't get yourselves out of joint
[1:27:36] give god praise
[1:27:38] you ought to thank him you have a pastor
[1:27:42] you should

[1:27:47] sheep

[1:27:52] for those who speak into my life
[1:27:54] can i have jehovah jireh is that one of
[1:27:57] the ones you all were able to get it was
[1:27:59] the last one that we read here

[1:28:04] it didn't we because it's from sioux

[1:28:19] worked up whoa
[1:28:22] i don't know why i feel like i feel
[1:28:24] right now
[1:28:26] hallelujah i feel like i've been plugged
[1:28:28] in to an electrical current
[1:28:31] and that might not always feel pleasant
[1:28:33] but right now i'm i'm i'm reaching for
[1:28:35] breath here whoa
[1:28:37] glory
[1:28:38] what we have what a treasure
[1:28:42] oh what a treasure we have
[1:28:44] when we have the holy ghost
[1:28:46] we have time for a few hours to go into
[1:28:49] the adoption to show how god pulled his
[1:28:52] people out and his son jesus was adopted
[1:28:56] into the family
[1:28:58] after he was already his son
[1:29:01] born in the family he become adopted in
[1:29:04] the family also he was adopted taken out
[1:29:09] put a white robe on he was adopted into
[1:29:12] the same family he was born into if he
[1:29:15] proved to be a fine man until he was of
[1:29:19] age and correctly about his father's
[1:29:22] business he said god done the same thing
[1:29:26] to his son took him apart put him up on
[1:29:29] the mountain and there
[1:29:32] overshadowed him did you know the holy
[1:29:35] ghost in the word is
[1:29:37] overshadowing the bride in the hour that
[1:29:40] we're living in because he wants to come
[1:29:43] bursting forth out of the very cells of
[1:29:46] our body like happened to jesus on the
[1:29:49] mount of transfiguration the very god
[1:29:52] that was within him that spirit of truth
[1:29:55] that he was that which filled his being
[1:29:58] that which he received at his baptism it
[1:30:01] was fully activated that day as we
[1:30:04] mentioned last week and the very pores
[1:30:06] of his skin begin to emanate like
[1:30:10] turning on a a lamp but not a lamp just
[1:30:13] don't sound bright enough does it
[1:30:14] turning on the sun
[1:30:16] the bible said his his garments
[1:30:18] glistened like the sun
[1:30:20] there was so much light and
[1:30:22] transfiguring glory that was coming out
[1:30:26] of him when he reached his full adoption
[1:30:28] i'm telling you the presence was so real
[1:30:31] and there was such an overshadowing that
[1:30:33] took place until the the inner circle
[1:30:36] said let us just build some tabernacles
[1:30:38] here and never go down
[1:30:41] think about that
[1:30:43] how many of you would like to stand in a
[1:30:45] presence so profound
[1:30:47] and so powerful that you said i'll just
[1:30:50] stay right here if somebody will just
[1:30:53] bring me a little water
[1:30:55] and a soda cracker i'll never go down
[1:30:58] off of this mountain i don't ever want
[1:31:00] to lose or leave this presence now in
[1:31:03] pentecost they all made fun of this
[1:31:05] verse of scripture i heard them preach
[1:31:07] against it now look at these look at
[1:31:09] these denominational preachers and look
[1:31:10] how they wanted to build churches and
[1:31:12] that was in their mind mentality and
[1:31:14] mind and brother randa mentioned that
[1:31:16] one time like that but you know what he
[1:31:17] said he said why isn't that something
[1:31:20] they wanted to abide in that presence
[1:31:24] that they felt
[1:31:25] so you can look at everything couple
[1:31:27] different ways can't you you could see
[1:31:29] that as a negative thing they wanted to
[1:31:30] start a denominational church and that's
[1:31:32] what it would have ended up being
[1:31:34] we know what it would have ended up
[1:31:35] being
[1:31:36] but their desire
[1:31:38] was like like the desire of the rich
[1:31:40] young ruler that gets so so bashed about
[1:31:42] you know but there was really something
[1:31:45] going on in his life that's a whole lot
[1:31:46] more profound than what we get a hold of
[1:31:49] and this was so profound that this inner
[1:31:51] circle said we could just live the rest
[1:31:53] of our lives in this presence what has
[1:31:56] happened before our eyes what we have
[1:31:58] seen what we have experienced we will
[1:32:01] never ever be the same again
[1:32:04] and the prophet said here god done the
[1:32:05] same thing to his son took him apart put
[1:32:07] him up on the mountain and there
[1:32:09] overshadowed him and his garments
[1:32:12] glistened like the sun in its strength
[1:32:16] like that
[1:32:18] god was doing something powerful
[1:32:22] he goes on to say and a voice spoke from
[1:32:24] heaven said this is my beloved son hear
[1:32:28] ye him god
[1:32:30] placing his own son
[1:32:33] we're in that hour
[1:32:35] we're in the same hour for the bride
[1:32:38] where god is desiring to place his sons
[1:32:43] in their position
[1:32:45] oh never ever ever to be moved again
[1:32:49] once god places you in that in that
[1:32:52] place in that socket where he wants you
[1:32:56] you don't ever have to be moved again no
[1:32:58] matter what comes no matter who howls
[1:33:00] you found a place of assurance and a
[1:33:03] place of peace and a place of authority
[1:33:05] that when the enemy held you just how
[1:33:07] back
[1:33:09] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:33:12] is in the world god placing his own son
[1:33:16] brother branham said that's right god
[1:33:18] still places his children in his church
[1:33:22] and the time of adoption is at hand and
[1:33:27] don't miss that last word separating
[1:33:30] because there's always a separating when
[1:33:32] god starts placing his sons
[1:33:34] there always is because he's not placing
[1:33:37] everybody
[1:33:38] he's placing his sons he's putting them
[1:33:41] in their position and that leaves some
[1:33:43] standing there rubbing their eyes trying
[1:33:45] to figure out what's going on why aren't
[1:33:47] they bothered why aren't they looking
[1:33:49] anymore at the circumstances of life
[1:33:51] around them why have they found an
[1:33:54] assurance that i don't know what to do i
[1:33:55] don't even know who they are anymore
[1:33:57] because nothing seems to bend them
[1:33:59] anymore they just keep marching on the
[1:34:01] glory
[1:34:02] see they're just rubbing their eyes
[1:34:04] trying to figure out it's a separating
[1:34:05] time
[1:34:06] all right in the message hear ye him do
[1:34:09] we have that
[1:34:10] 1956 i want to read this slow
[1:34:14] and i can i don't have to go on all day
[1:34:17] but is that one you don't have it's just
[1:34:19] after
[1:34:20] it's just after jehovah jireh okay yes
[1:34:23] that's it
[1:34:24] notice
[1:34:26] and this is a little lengthy so would
[1:34:27] you try to stay with all the attention
[1:34:30] that you have here on what the messenger
[1:34:32] is saying to us
[1:34:34] he said now
[1:34:35] notice now when this child become
[1:34:38] at a certain age
[1:34:40] if if it had have been a correct child
[1:34:44] had been
[1:34:45] zealous of the father's works
[1:34:47] had been stable
[1:34:52] always abounding in the works of the
[1:34:55] lord not tossed about with every wind
[1:34:59] and care listen now
[1:35:01] he's fixing to get personal
[1:35:04] not one day a presbyterian
[1:35:07] next day a methodist
[1:35:10] next day a nazarene
[1:35:13] next day a pilgrim holiness
[1:35:15] tossed about like a leaf on a troubled
[1:35:18] sea
[1:35:19] have you ever known anybody like that
[1:35:22] have you ever been anybody like that
[1:35:25] come on why don't we just be honest some
[1:35:28] of us didn't know what we were you know
[1:35:30] i got an explanation for that we were
[1:35:32] looking for who we were we were trying
[1:35:34] to figure out who we were we tried
[1:35:36] barnyard after barnyard after barnyard
[1:35:39] and none of them seemed to be conducive
[1:35:41] for an eagle
[1:35:44] so forgive us for our journey
[1:35:47] but one day
[1:35:48] he came flying over
[1:35:52] the barnyard where we were sitting and
[1:35:55] jehovah eagle let out a cry
[1:35:59] and like the old song said i recognize
[1:36:02] my father on that day
[1:36:04] i knew who i was
[1:36:06] on that day
[1:36:08] i just hopped right up on the fence post
[1:36:10] and waited for jehovah eagle to come
[1:36:12] down low enough that i could climb on
[1:36:14] his back and deliver me from all those
[1:36:16] worm-eaten chickens that i'd been
[1:36:18] fellowshipping with all my life i was
[1:36:21] not born to eat worms i was an eagle you

[1:38:55] i'm so thankful
[1:38:57] for the feast
[1:38:59] tossed about like a leaf on a troubled
[1:39:02] sea
[1:39:03] if it was stable it's mine no matter
[1:39:06] where it was at set on christ his
[1:39:08] affections working with one single heart
[1:39:12] zealous of getting souls saved and not
[1:39:15] churchi the church's fusses
[1:39:17] then in the
[1:39:19] go ahead
[1:39:21] it didn't mean to interrupt your amens i
[1:39:22] got plenty of time to stop for an amen
[1:39:25] then in the old testament there come a
[1:39:27] day that his father brought his son out
[1:39:29] into the public as a witness put a robe
[1:39:32] on him and set him upon a place where
[1:39:35] all the city could see him and they had
[1:39:37] the law of adoption this father to his
[1:39:40] own son who had been born in his own
[1:39:43] family and now was of age and was a
[1:39:46] child worthy to take his place he
[1:39:48] adopted or placed his own son into
[1:39:51] position he said any bible reader knows
[1:39:55] that the placing of a son
[1:39:59] powerful
[1:40:01] any bible reader knows that he said then
[1:40:04] after that ceremony the son had a right
[1:40:07] his name was just as good on the check
[1:40:10] as his father's was
[1:40:13] let me tell you something we've made a
[1:40:15] few withdrawals here and there
[1:40:18] but there's coming an hour right around
[1:40:20] the corner where we're going to live by
[1:40:21] those withdrawals
[1:40:23] because what we have is going to come
[1:40:25] from him
[1:40:27] let me tell you something if you didn't
[1:40:29] learn anything from the shutdowns of
[1:40:31] 2020 and 2021 you you might learn the
[1:40:34] next round if you didn't already learn
[1:40:37] you may learn now i just heard just just
[1:40:39] this morning i heard that cases are
[1:40:41] rising in alberta and that they're
[1:40:43] already talking about the next step
[1:40:45] there
[1:40:46] and they're already talking about in
[1:40:48] many many states there is such a uh a
[1:40:51] number of uh arise in the numbers of the
[1:40:55] of the different variants uh in uh
[1:40:58] particularly in tennessee
[1:41:00] in missouri and in florida that even
[1:41:03] conservative governors are being pushed
[1:41:06] to try to figure out what to do
[1:41:08] to try to stop it and i guess you heard
[1:41:11] our governor blaming all the
[1:41:13] unvaccinated people for the problem
[1:41:17] god bless our governor
[1:41:19] and strengthen her and may she live long
[1:41:22] on this earth
[1:41:23] but she ain't right about everything
[1:41:26] we ought to go beyond that if you want
[1:41:28] to put the blame on somebody put the
[1:41:30] blame on the enemy because he's the one
[1:41:32] getting all the press
[1:41:35] come on now
[1:41:36] and so you may not have learned anything
[1:41:38] the first time it may take the second
[1:41:40] time but i want you to know you can see
[1:41:43] in what has happened how quickly life
[1:41:45] can change
[1:41:47] a job that you depended on gone
[1:41:51] restaurant owners
[1:41:52] flourishing gone
[1:41:55] no restaurant
[1:41:57] no and now with everything getting
[1:41:59] supposedly to get back in the groove and
[1:42:02] go on and they can't get anybody to work
[1:42:06] offering people money
[1:42:08] bonuses
[1:42:10] i mean has anybody ever heard of
[1:42:12] mcdonald's giving bonuses
[1:42:15] to get people to work there's always
[1:42:18] people that want to do jobs like that
[1:42:20] until the hour we're living in it just
[1:42:22] lets us see how how changing everything
[1:42:25] is how really fragile everything can be
[1:42:29] we are probably very soon coming to an
[1:42:32] hour where we are really going to
[1:42:35] appreciate the authority that comes when
[1:42:38] the sons are placed
[1:42:40] because our name on the check it's going
[1:42:42] to be withdrawals from the father's bank
[1:42:45] of eternity that's going to help us get
[1:42:47] through life until the rapture day
[1:42:50] so we're going to need to function in
[1:42:52] that authority and there's going to be
[1:42:54] such a pull among souls that are
[1:42:58] scattered around the world who need to
[1:43:00] be fed like little birds lifting up
[1:43:02] their heads trying to get a little piece
[1:43:04] of meat until we're going to not only
[1:43:06] need to make withdrawals from the
[1:43:08] father's bank account we're going to
[1:43:10] need supernatural travels
[1:43:13] we're going to need supernatural
[1:43:15] provision
[1:43:16] we're going to need absolutely
[1:43:19] supernatural intervention to be able to
[1:43:22] do the things we need to do hallelujah
[1:43:24] oh that sounds somebody said that just
[1:43:27] paints a dark picture you're seeing
[1:43:29] wrong you better change your glasses i
[1:43:32] don't see darkness i see a lot of light
[1:43:34] coming out of the bride i see sons
[1:43:38] getting ready to shine
[1:43:40] glory be to god with a spoken word in
[1:43:44] their mouth
[1:43:46] shifting things
[1:43:48] they don't even know the government
[1:43:49] doesn't even know the nations of the
[1:43:51] world don't even know who's changing
[1:43:53] things
[1:43:54] but things are changing so quickly they
[1:43:55] don't even know that the bride's doing a
[1:43:57] whole lot of it with her authority
[1:43:59] hallelujah speaking words of life and
[1:44:02] she
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:09] he said that's where the church should
[1:44:10] be today
[1:44:12] the things that i do shall you
[1:44:15] also
[1:44:17] more than this
[1:44:18] shall you do
[1:44:20] for i go to my father
[1:44:23] are you still here
[1:44:25] we have a few more minutes
[1:44:27] then god always followed up every shadow
[1:44:31] and type with the antitype
[1:44:33] notice he took his own son before three
[1:44:36] witnesses i'd like for you to see how
[1:44:38] brother man he has he's just become a
[1:44:42] holy ghost theologian
[1:44:45] because he is now preaching in type and
[1:44:47] antitype my my my mind
[1:44:50] just think about it
[1:44:52] elementary school education
[1:44:55] and he has taking us to the type
[1:44:58] which is the the uh
[1:45:00] adoption process
[1:45:02] in the in the far east
[1:45:04] or middle east
[1:45:07] and now he is going to the antitype
[1:45:10] which is what makes it more real but
[1:45:13] it's not the full fulfillment an
[1:45:15] antitype is not the complete fulfillment
[1:45:19] of a type
[1:45:20] it's just another very powerful
[1:45:24] establishment
[1:45:25] of what the type is to reflect what the
[1:45:29] type is to speak about and so brother
[1:45:31] branham said and here is the antitype
[1:45:34] and he's exactly right he said then god
[1:45:37] always follows up every shadow and type
[1:45:40] with the antitype notice he took his own
[1:45:43] son before three witnesses peter james
[1:45:46] and john the inner circle hope faith and
[1:45:49] charity come on
[1:45:52] he took them before the translated the
[1:45:54] resurrected
[1:45:56] and god himself
[1:45:58] and there
[1:46:01] overshadowed
[1:46:03] him
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:06] that was that was god gathering his
[1:46:08] witnesses
[1:46:10] just like the father in the adoption
[1:46:12] process took his son right down to the
[1:46:15] gate of the city
[1:46:17] so there would be lots of witnesses to
[1:46:20] see the celebration of the authority
[1:46:23] exchange
[1:46:25] all right and then he goes on and he
[1:46:27] said the bible said that his clothes
[1:46:29] glistened like the sun in its strength
[1:46:32] and then god said this is my beloved son
[1:46:36] hear ye him
[1:46:38] he said peter wanted to build three
[1:46:39] tabernacles he wanted all the
[1:46:42] sabbatarians and law keepers to have
[1:46:44] theirs he wanted all the rest of them to
[1:46:46] have theirs he wanted to break it up
[1:46:48] into denominations but god shut it up
[1:46:52] and said this is my beloved son hear ye
[1:46:55] him and when they looked they saw jesus
[1:46:59] only
[1:47:02] he didn't see three people
[1:47:05] they saw one
[1:47:06] person a triune god
[1:47:09] who had come to live
[1:47:12] in one person
[1:47:14] are you with me
[1:47:15] let's look into that just a moment now
[1:47:17] this is pretty powerful stuff here
[1:47:20] couldn't you have preached it without
[1:47:21] reading it i probably could have but it
[1:47:23] wouldn't have had the effect that this
[1:47:24] can have if you open your heart
[1:47:27] i'm not i'm not ashamed to say
[1:47:29] i can't bring it like this
[1:47:32] verse
[1:47:33] paragraph 41 he said let's look at moses
[1:47:36] moses represented the law no man can
[1:47:39] keep the law
[1:47:40] and no flesh is justified by the law
[1:47:44] i'm glad that it's not good works that
[1:47:46] we have done but it's by
[1:47:50] his grace and mercy
[1:47:56] that's brought me through
[1:48:00] how many of you know it's the truth
[1:48:02] by his foreknowledge
[1:48:04] that he foreknows us
[1:48:06] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:48:10] and then i couldn't be saved by the law
[1:48:14] he said you can't be saved by the law so
[1:48:18] if the law was weak and could not do
[1:48:22] god in due time sent his son
[1:48:26] made after the likeness of sinful by a
[1:48:29] woman born under the law that he might
[1:48:35] redeem us
[1:48:39] hello
[1:48:40] redeem
[1:48:42] sister audrey he didn't just say save us
[1:48:45] he said redeem us
[1:48:48] to take us all the way back to the
[1:48:51] father's original
[1:48:53] thoughts plan and design for our life
[1:48:57] hallelujah no wonder we sang sweet is
[1:48:59] the song
[1:49:01] sweet is the song
[1:49:04] i'm redeemed
[1:49:06] by his grace
[1:49:08] god in due time sent his son made after
[1:49:10] the likeness of sinful by a woman born
[1:49:13] under the law that he might redeem us
[1:49:15] from the curse of the law so moses
[1:49:18] god shut him off
[1:49:21] now why is he talking about moses
[1:49:23] because moses appeared
[1:49:27] here is jesus here's peter james and
[1:49:31] john
[1:49:32] and then here are two more who come from
[1:49:35] the heavenlies
[1:49:37] and manifest himself standing there on
[1:49:41] the mount of transfiguration moses
[1:49:43] representing the law
[1:49:45] and now in paragraph 42
[1:49:48] there stood elijah
[1:49:51] he said what did elijah stand for elijah
[1:49:54] was the line of god's justice folks
[1:49:58] that's powerful talk there
[1:50:00] law
[1:50:02] and justice
[1:50:04] you may think it's the same thing
[1:50:06] but it's not the same thing
[1:50:09] law and justice
[1:50:12] now he said
[1:50:14] elijah was the lion of god's justice
[1:50:17] elijah was a stern prophet he set upon
[1:50:20] the hill under the will of god and they
[1:50:23] sent 50 men to him the captain of 50.
[1:50:26] elijah stood up and said if i be a man
[1:50:28] of god the fire fall from heaven and
[1:50:30] consume you
[1:50:32] and they went away they went the king
[1:50:34] sent another 50. elijah stands up if i
[1:50:37] be a man of god let fire fall from
[1:50:40] heaven and away win another 50. he was
[1:50:43] the line of god's
[1:50:46] justice
[1:50:48] interesting
[1:50:50] brother i never want
[1:50:54] judgment
[1:50:57] i
[1:50:58] want
[1:51:02] read it
[1:51:04] mercy
[1:51:08] rewrote my life let's have a sing along
[1:51:13] mercy
[1:51:15] rewrote my life
[1:51:21] should have fallen
[1:51:23] my soul
[1:51:25] cast down but
[1:51:28] mercy
[1:51:31] rewrote
[1:51:32] my life
[1:51:36] the law would have condemned me
[1:51:38] justice would have demanded my death
[1:51:43] but mercy stepped in
[1:51:48] come on brother isaiah brooks and get
[1:51:50] here
[1:51:51] to sing to us this year
[1:51:55] mercy stepped in
[1:51:58] is that what it's called
[1:52:00] mercy said mercy said no
[1:52:04] i'm not going to let you go
[1:52:08] i'm not going to let you slip away
[1:52:10] are you with me
[1:52:12] i'm not going to let you
[1:52:14] perish mercy is going to come to the
[1:52:17] rescue
[1:52:19] judgment listen the law has served its
[1:52:21] purpose justice serves his purpose but
[1:52:24] mercy is going to make the difference
[1:52:28] and by god's mercy he extends his grace
[1:52:31] it works together to bring us into the
[1:52:34] fullness of who god has created us to be
[1:52:36] brother branham said i want mercy god's
[1:52:38] justice would kill us everyone tonight
[1:52:41] he would demand it and we die of a
[1:52:44] shadow
[1:52:48] some people are dying
[1:52:50] because they refuse to step away from
[1:52:53] the shadow
[1:52:55] into the
[1:52:56] light the shadow serves its purpose
[1:53:03] just like
[1:53:04] the shack
[1:53:06] that we talked about tuesday night
[1:53:08] or sunday whenever it was
[1:53:10] without the shuck the seed would perish
[1:53:14] the shuck is necessary to
[1:53:17] insulate and to protect the seed
[1:53:20] but the shuck cannot inherit
[1:53:23] his
[1:53:24] life come on
[1:53:27] his life is not carried by the shock
[1:53:30] his life is only carried by the seed
[1:53:34] so the shuck serves his purpose you know
[1:53:36] people critics of this message
[1:53:39] they get upset because one time brother
[1:53:41] becomes preached away and he mentions
[1:53:42] mary being like a shuck
[1:53:45] and he wasn't calling her spiritually a
[1:53:47] shuck
[1:53:48] we know better than that because she
[1:53:50] received the holy ghost
[1:53:52] he was saying that she was like an
[1:53:55] incubator
[1:53:57] so don't get caught up in some little
[1:53:59] speaking like that and miss the whole
[1:54:01] thing because there's a whole lot listen
[1:54:03] don't you worry he might have made the
[1:54:05] slide like a man can make he might have
[1:54:07] missed a word or grabbed the wrong word
[1:54:09] or something like that but that's okay
[1:54:11] cause you're here you've got the holy
[1:54:13] ghost you've got some intelligence you
[1:54:16] know how to put it together in the word
[1:54:17] that's why listen you've got to take
[1:54:20] what you hear all the way back to the
[1:54:21] word anyway that's what the bride is
[1:54:24] commissioned and called to do
[1:54:26] and so don't you slip up with someone
[1:54:27] something like that don't let you let
[1:54:29] that throw you off just keep following
[1:54:32] the word
[1:54:33] but now as we see the law pass away and
[1:54:36] we see the justice of god pass away the
[1:54:38] sternness of his judgment pass away and
[1:54:41] then let's look over here this is my
[1:54:43] beloved son hear ye him what was it
[1:54:46] god's love god's love stood there
[1:54:50] represented in christ can anybody say
[1:54:52] amen to that
[1:54:54] oh how beautiful that is
[1:54:56] god's love
[1:54:59] represented in christ we've all sinned
[1:55:01] and come short of the glory but god's
[1:55:03] love is represented in his son
[1:55:06] he said hear ye him
[1:55:08] no matter what the law says and what
[1:55:10] this other says and what this says and
[1:55:13] what the church says hear
[1:55:15] ye
[1:55:18] him
[1:55:22] he's got a voice
[1:55:24] it's the voice of truth
[1:55:30] i'm not trying to turn this service into
[1:55:32] a musical
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:37] i know how some of you feel about
[1:55:38] musicals
[1:55:40] but i can't help it i i
[1:55:42] i just i can't help it i i hear it i
[1:55:44] want to sing it
[1:55:46] i hear it i want to shout about it i
[1:55:48] hear it i want to do something about it
[1:55:49] i want to dance about it i'm sorry if
[1:55:52] that is no longer who you are
[1:55:56] but i want to be returned i tell you i
[1:55:58] want zeal and strength to worship him as
[1:56:02] i have in the past i don't want to
[1:56:04] worship him less
[1:56:08] don't turn the cameras well good you
[1:56:10] don't up here anyway but this little
[1:56:11] sister here that i'm not gonna call her
[1:56:13] name on the stream wouldn't want to do
[1:56:15] that to embarrass her anymore
[1:56:17] but um a relative of somebody who just
[1:56:20] spent some time with us
[1:56:22] and i'll just say it that way i pre i
[1:56:24] wasn't just watching you all
[1:56:26] but i'm a pastor and i watch everybody
[1:56:29] well i watch most everybody
[1:56:32] and sometimes if you watch everybody
[1:56:34] you'll be distracted
[1:56:35] but i was just and i want you to know
[1:56:37] you bless me little sister both of you
[1:56:39] really
[1:56:40] but i look back there in both of her
[1:56:42] hands and i'm so thankful not like this
[1:56:44] you know
[1:56:46] both of her hands were lifted up and she
[1:56:48] was singing the song and worshipping the
[1:56:52] lord i don't think i've ever been in a
[1:56:54] service with her in my life
[1:56:56] with her mom and dad with her dad i know
[1:56:58] for sure yes with her grandparents yes
[1:57:00] with all of her great aunts and uncles
[1:57:02] and cousins and and isis and yes all of
[1:57:05] them
[1:57:06] but i don't know if i've ever been in
[1:57:07] the service with her or not but i
[1:57:08] appreciated the fact you're in a new
[1:57:10] place and an odd place we admitted a
[1:57:12] strange place but you're coming here and
[1:57:15] because it's not about us it's not about
[1:57:17] who's it's it's a for a few moments
[1:57:20] folks it has to be about him
[1:57:22] and your your sincerity and worship
[1:57:25] blessed me i just wanted you to know
[1:57:27] that and yours does i can count on
[1:57:30] people i can count on people that no

[1:57:35] matter what's going on around us there's
[1:57:36] some of you i can count on you're going
[1:57:38] to worship the lord regardless i don't
[1:57:40] ever i don't ever have to say oh my
[1:57:43] sister so-and-so has had a terrible week
[1:57:45] this week this has happened that's
[1:57:46] happened so when she comes in here today
[1:57:48] we'll have to drag her to worship
[1:57:51] i don't have that with most of the folks
[1:57:53] here
[1:57:54] in fact i can know that if they have
[1:57:56] fought hard all week long nine times out
[1:57:59] of ten they're gonna come in here with a
[1:58:01] louder praise they're gonna come in here
[1:58:04] with a higher hand lift it up
[1:58:08] hallelujah because they've learned
[1:58:10] they've let we've learned a thing or two
[1:58:13] through the years about giving god
[1:58:16] praise

[1:58:24] pentecostal church tonight

[1:58:41] the church says hear ye him

[1:58:59] no sir he said he can't do it god has to
[1:59:02] do it and it's the works of god by grace
[1:59:05] through foreknowledge that ordained you
[1:59:07] to eternal life and put your name on the
[1:59:09] lamb's book of life at the beginning
[1:59:13] and no man can come except my father

[1:59:18] him everlasting life raise him up at the
[1:59:20] last day

[2:00:07] one do you have here ye him phoenix
[2:00:09] arizona
[2:00:12] paragraph 37 now you see
[2:00:15] jesus had proven to god don't let that
[2:00:17] throw you
[2:00:19] that's what this whole process of
[2:00:20] adoption was about
[2:00:22] he was proving himself
[2:00:25] the only difference is the father knew
[2:00:26] how it's going to turn out
[2:00:29] in that natural adoption process you
[2:00:30] know you could you could have a dude
[2:00:34] come on now
[2:00:36] your eldest son could be a dude
[2:00:42] well i'll give you an example of a son
[2:00:44] being a dud not the oldest son but you
[2:00:46] know that prodigal he turned out to be a
[2:00:48] dude
[2:00:49] until he got himself back to father's
[2:00:51] house
[2:00:52] so the father wasn't out there putting a
[2:00:53] signet ring on him when he was out there
[2:00:55] in the in the uh pigpen
[2:00:58] but when he saw him coming home
[2:01:00] he then said i'm gonna put some
[2:01:02] authority on him then he's not coming in
[2:01:04] here like a servant he's a son
[2:01:07] and i'm going to treat him like a son
[2:01:09] until he manifests who he is as a son
[2:01:12] that's trust
[2:01:14] that's real trust
[2:01:16] but you can have a son
[2:01:18] brother venom told us that in these some
[2:01:20] of these quotes you can have a son that
[2:01:21] that cares about himself he doesn't care
[2:01:23] about the things of god doesn't care
[2:01:24] about father's business
[2:01:27] you can get some kind of hippie musician
[2:01:29] to come along or something he don't care
[2:01:30] anything about running father's business
[2:01:33] all he wants to do is run from set to
[2:01:36] set
[2:01:40] long-haired hippie you know
[2:01:43] running from one guitar jam to the next
[2:01:46] thinking he's going to make his living
[2:01:48] starving musician
[2:01:50] you don't care anything about the
[2:01:52] inheritance that's waiting on i wish
[2:01:53] you'd help me
[2:01:56] he don't care nothing about that just
[2:01:57] let it all go i don't care i don't care
[2:01:59] anything about my heritage i don't care
[2:02:00] anything about my hard-working daddy i
[2:02:03] don't care anything about what he's
[2:02:04] trying to leave me
[2:02:06] i just want to be me and you've got the
[2:02:07] world screaming do your own thing be
[2:02:10] your own man follow your dream you can
[2:02:13] do whatever you want to do
[2:02:15] don't live somebody else's expectations
[2:02:18] of who you you go and do your own thing
[2:02:20] so no wonder so many duds get produced
[2:02:22] in an hour like this
[2:02:23] who don't care anything about what has
[2:02:25] been worked hard to provide for them you
[2:02:27] ought to say amen
[2:02:29] so it can't happen but here's one that
[2:02:32] proved himself i'm telling you the the
[2:02:34] type is clear the antitype is clearer
[2:02:38] we know what god has done
[2:02:40] we know what's been laid out here for us
[2:02:42] you see jesus had proven to god that
[2:02:44] he'd been the right kind of son
[2:02:46] and god took him up on the top of the
[2:02:48] mountain brought witnesses out there
[2:02:50] heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses
[2:02:53] and he clothed him in immortality
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:03:01] now how could he be clothed in
[2:03:02] immortality
[2:03:03] and then go right down there to cross
[2:03:05] and die
[2:03:07] oh
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:09] he didn't die
[2:03:13] that body that he was given to live in
[2:03:15] that's what died i want you to know
[2:03:18] jesus was never dead
[2:03:22] never never never never dead
[2:03:24] he lived
[2:03:26] he walked down through the corridors of
[2:03:28] the underworld come on leading captivity
[2:03:31] captive giving gifts unto men he knew
[2:03:34] exactly what the work was that had to be
[2:03:36] completed and finished
[2:03:39] all right he goes on and
[2:03:41] his garments when they looked up he was
[2:03:43] clothed in immortality and when they
[2:03:45] looked up they said his garments shine
[2:03:47] like the sun a supernatural something
[2:03:50] taken place his garments glistened like
[2:03:52] the sun in its middle of the day as wide
[2:03:54] as they could be god placed on him that
[2:03:57] robe of immortality showing that he had
[2:04:00] received him
[2:04:01] that's the thing that god will do to his
[2:04:03] sons here on earth someday he will call
[2:04:06] you a side church if you'll only obey
[2:04:08] him and stay on the word
[2:04:10] and believe it
[2:04:12] that's why it's important to stay with
[2:04:14] the word
[2:04:15] that's why grandma's religion is only
[2:04:17] authentic if it's based on the word if
[2:04:19] it's not based on the word she missed it
[2:04:23] that doesn't mean she's lost
[2:04:25] it means she walked in what god let her
[2:04:27] see
[2:04:29] but don't you let that be your stopping
[2:04:31] place
[2:04:32] if he's calling you to more truth follow
[2:04:35] follow
[2:04:36] with everything you've got he will place
[2:04:38] into the church before the coming of
[2:04:40] jesus christ he will place into the
[2:04:42] church all the powers that christ had in
[2:04:46] him will be in the church
[2:04:49] all that god was he poured into jesus
[2:04:53] all that jesus was he pours into the
[2:04:57] church
[2:04:58] god wanting his work done he sent into
[2:05:01] his he sent it into his son the son
[2:05:03] wanting the work done send it into the
[2:05:05] church
[2:05:07] at that day you'll know that i'm in the
[2:05:08] father and the father in me and i in you
[2:05:11] and you and me you hear the words of
[2:05:13] jesus coming to pass you hear what jesus
[2:05:16] was talking about now it's made possible
[2:05:18] because the holy ghost fell on the day
[2:05:19] of pentecost
[2:05:21] he said all that day at that day because
[2:05:23] the same power of god was in jehovah god
[2:05:26] rested in jesus christ the same power
[2:05:28] that rested in jesus christ rested in
[2:05:30] the placed sons in the body of christ
[2:05:36] paragraph 38 placing of a son take him
[2:05:39] out into a certain place have a ceremony
[2:05:41] before angels place him positionally
[2:05:43] what he is in the body of christ then
[2:05:45] that person has the authority he says
[2:05:48] let me say this if you count me a
[2:05:50] fanatic from this not on the very same
[2:05:52] thing that i'm speaking of will be done
[2:05:55] there will be a power put into the
[2:05:56] church and now is coming in
[2:06:00] that the holy spirit will so anoint the
[2:06:02] people till they'll speak though
[2:06:08] hallelujah
[2:06:11] hallelujah
[2:06:13] there'll be a power put into the church
[2:06:15] and now it's coming in that the holy
[2:06:17] spirit will so anoint the people till
[2:06:19] they'll speak the word and it'll create
[2:06:21] itself
[2:06:24] it will create itself
[2:06:27] right
[2:06:28] there you talk about materialization
[2:06:32] you talk about the word of god being
[2:06:34] spoken and then cells and molecules
[2:06:37] beginning to move around obeying that
[2:06:40] word and creating
[2:06:43] recreating and creating
[2:06:46] i want you to know brother curry has
[2:06:48] lost
[2:06:49] things
[2:06:50] parts portions
[2:06:52] systems in his body that can never be
[2:06:55] replaced in the natural
[2:06:57] but if it could be the will of god god
[2:07:00] is more than able
[2:07:02] to create what needs to be created
[2:07:06] [Applause]
[2:07:09] it's coming it's coming this
[2:07:12] manifestation is coming i'm only saying
[2:07:15] it's coming because all we have seen of
[2:07:17] it thus far is a little here a little
[2:07:19] there and a little the other but that's
[2:07:21] enough that's enough that's not brother
[2:07:23] that's enough sister to keep me
[2:07:25] believing it's enough it's enough to
[2:07:28] cause me to believe that what god did a
[2:07:31] little here and a little there he is
[2:07:33] more more
[2:07:35] more and able hallelujah he's more than
[2:07:40] able to do it again
[2:07:42] beyond
[2:07:45] beyond
[2:07:46] what we could even think
[2:07:49] or even imagine
[2:07:51] if you believe that give god some praise
[2:07:55] hallelujah
[2:08:06] yes
[2:08:09] call it a carrot on a stick
[2:08:11] call it anything you want to
[2:08:13] but what i have seen god do is enough
[2:08:17] to make me keep believing
[2:08:20] for the manifestation of the moar
[2:08:23] hallelujah
[2:08:25] that's why there's a church of people
[2:08:26] down there in louisiana this morning
[2:08:28] believing god
[2:08:30] for a miracle that the doctor says is
[2:08:31] impossible
[2:08:34] sister
[2:08:36] karen pruitt's
[2:08:38] brain bleed is
[2:08:40] active again and she's been
[2:08:42] unconscious since monday
[2:08:45] and the doctors have said this is all we
[2:08:46] can do
[2:08:48] and it may possibly be
[2:08:50] i heard brother
[2:08:52] who would say this may possibly be it
[2:08:54] may possibly be
[2:08:55] that my life on this earth is about to
[2:08:57] change it could be
[2:08:59] that this about that she would cross
[2:09:01] over
[2:09:02] but refusing to
[2:09:05] camp around such an idea
[2:09:08] we continue to believe and know
[2:09:11] is there anybody in this room that
[2:09:12] believes jesus could walk into that room
[2:09:16] is there anybody in here that believes
[2:09:18] he could walk over there to a mobile
[2:09:20] home just a few miles from here and
[2:09:21] touch our brother
[2:09:23] i know he is i know he's able i know
[2:09:25] he's able i know he's able brother see
[2:09:28] if you're hearing this i won't apologize
[2:09:29] to you of what i'm saying about to say i
[2:09:31] won't apologize to you cause i don't
[2:09:33] want you to hear turn it off
[2:09:35] i don't want you to hear it
[2:09:36] but someone asked me recently said what
[2:09:38] are you gonna do if you have to say
[2:09:40] something in his funeral one day i said
[2:09:41] i will
[2:09:44] if they ask me i will
[2:09:47] if i if i outlive him
[2:09:53] that won't be hard
[2:09:55] because that could be ten years
[2:09:58] if jesus tears
[2:10:01] listen folks we're not sitting over here
[2:10:03] a bunch of dummies
[2:10:05] we know that there is a change of this
[2:10:08] body we know that death is a doorway we
[2:10:12] know that the saints of god stepped
[2:10:13] through that doorway
[2:10:15] we know that one day our work here on
[2:10:17] this earth is ended
[2:10:19] we know that one day we have to uh pass
[2:10:22] from this life into the next when he
[2:10:24] calls us
[2:10:25] but we just don't believe the devil gets
[2:10:27] to choose that day in that hour
[2:10:30] we believe that god chooses that day and
[2:10:33] that hour i'll tell you something else i
[2:10:35] believe i don't believe you have to be
[2:10:37] sick to cross that river
[2:10:41] i believe it ought to be among the sons
[2:10:44] of god that we go to sleep
[2:10:46] and we don't wake up
[2:10:50] i don't believe that it should be that
[2:10:53] we waste away
[2:10:57] i saw it
[2:10:59] i saw it with my own grandmother
[2:11:02] i saw how she lost weight but she didn't
[2:11:06] waste away
[2:11:08] i saw that laying in that casket she
[2:11:10] looked like somebody that had just had
[2:11:12] chicken and dumplings
[2:11:16] she didn't look like somebody uh
[2:11:18] emesiated and twisted up by death and by
[2:11:22] disease it didn't look like to me i
[2:11:24] though my heart was breaking because i
[2:11:26] didn't want to say goodbye but it didn't
[2:11:28] look to me like death had won a victory
[2:11:32] it looked to me like jesus had called
[2:11:36] and she had made the crossing
[2:11:38] and you're going to make it one day
[2:11:40] and i'm going to make it one day and
[2:11:42] brother steve curry's going to make it
[2:11:44] one day but you do not have to just sit
[2:11:46] down and settle that because the doctor
[2:11:48] said there's no more we can do here and
[2:11:50] no more we can do there oh king jesus
[2:11:53] oh
[2:11:55] i gotta go
[2:11:56] we have to oh
[2:11:58] king jesus
[2:12:00] what he can do what he can do
[2:12:05] what he can do
[2:12:07] he can walk in a room
[2:12:10] and everything changes
[2:12:14] any good
[2:12:24] yes
[2:12:27] there will be a power put into the
[2:12:29] church and now is coming in that the
[2:12:32] holy spirit will so anoint the people
[2:12:34] till they'll speak the word and it'll
[2:12:37] create itself right there
[2:12:40] we haven't seen powers like that coming
[2:12:42] in the church now i know it for a fact
[2:12:44] say unto this mountain be
[2:12:46] moved don't doubt in your heart
[2:12:50] but believe that what you said
[2:12:53] shall come to pass you can have what you
[2:12:57] have said
[2:12:58] the placing of the church in position
[2:13:02] where the fullness listen
[2:13:05] listen
[2:13:06] you can't have this in the divided
[2:13:08] people
[2:13:09] you can have this power in a divided
[2:13:11] people
[2:13:12] we must understand that we do not have
[2:13:16] to be unified in opinion
[2:13:20] we do not have to be unified in our
[2:13:22] fashion sense
[2:13:26] because some people have none
[2:13:31] they look at what they they put it
[2:13:32] together and they think whoa
[2:13:35] i am really styling and profiling
[2:13:39] somebody else looks at it and thinks
[2:13:41] my tornado blew through the bedroom and
[2:13:43] you just picked up the first thing you
[2:13:45] found
[2:13:47] brother branham said at the end of the
[2:13:48] day that don't matter
[2:13:51] he said i might have stripes
[2:13:54] dots
[2:13:56] my trousers
[2:13:57] he said that that's not what i'm after
[2:14:00] so we don't have to be unified and i'm
[2:14:02] going to tell you something
[2:14:03] i i'm just going to be honest with you i
[2:14:05] love fancy
[2:14:07] hairdos
[2:14:11] on sisters
[2:14:14] i'm just being honest i'm not gonna wear
[2:14:16] one
[2:14:19] i love it i love it
[2:14:21] i love it when the sister takes a little
[2:14:24] extra time
[2:14:27] why are you so quiet
[2:14:29] i love it i love going into whataburger
[2:14:32] with you
[2:14:35] when your curls is just right
[2:14:38] i love it
[2:14:39] because i believe it's a badge
[2:14:42] of god's glory
[2:14:45] i believe a woman's hair is given to her
[2:14:48] for a covering
[2:14:50] that's new testament teaching
[2:14:52] and if you want to get real specific
[2:14:54] first corinthians 11 says her long hair
[2:14:58] it's given her her covering
[2:14:59] so if for me it is not necessary that
[2:15:01] she put a rag on it
[2:15:03] for me it's not necessary that you cover
[2:15:05] it with a with a prayer covering aura or
[2:15:08] a veil or or whatever else somebody's
[2:15:10] getting into but it is important for her
[2:15:13] to have a covering
[2:15:15] and her husband is her covering
[2:15:16] spiritually if she has one
[2:15:18] and that long hair on her head is a
[2:15:20] testimony that she's living under
[2:15:22] submission to god's divine order
[2:15:25] doesn't mean she's walking afraid of her
[2:15:26] husband it means she's submitting to
[2:15:29] god's order for her life and when a
[2:15:31] sister takes a little time with that
[2:15:33] glory i believe there's power on a
[2:15:35] woman's head because of her long hair
[2:15:38] be honest somebody said how long is long
[2:15:40] what if your hair can't grow then god
[2:15:42] knows that
[2:15:43] he sees that
[2:15:45] he understands that and yours is just as
[2:15:48] beautiful as somebody else's who grow
[2:15:50] it's not that
[2:15:53] but there's power on a woman's head when
[2:15:55] she's willing to take god at his word
[2:15:57] now this is going out everywhere
[2:15:58] everybody's hearing this
[2:16:01] my email and inbox and everything will
[2:16:03] be just
[2:16:05] i i do i do i'm not going to tell you
[2:16:08] but everybody's not going to have the
[2:16:09] same uh
[2:16:11] you just get some of these young sisters
[2:16:13] i'll tell you they can do amazing things
[2:16:16] you get the pain girls and some of the
[2:16:18] rest of these uh uh charity i don't i
[2:16:21] don't know who all does it i'm never
[2:16:23] there they don't invite me
[2:16:26] when they do the wedding hairs
[2:16:29] but i love it sister flo i love seeing
[2:16:32] it i love
[2:16:33] seeing those sisters put that up do
[2:16:36] something with it and it'd be beautiful
[2:16:38] but everybody don't have the skill to do
[2:16:40] that
[2:16:41] everybody don't have the fashion sense
[2:16:42] to dress a certain way and look a
[2:16:44] certain way those things don't matter we
[2:16:46] may never be unified in in our our say
[2:16:51] for instance i might like to get my news
[2:16:53] off of newsmax and you may think that is
[2:16:56] just as bad as fox and you may choose we
[2:16:58] may never be unified in every part of
[2:17:01] what we do
[2:17:03] you may like vinyl of planking for your
[2:17:05] floor that may be what you can have but
[2:17:07] that's not what we wanted we are we had
[2:17:10] solid wood floor brother greeley put
[2:17:12] solid wood floor down they insurance
[2:17:14] company come in there and wanted us to
[2:17:16] use the the vinyl plate they told us
[2:17:18] it's in million dollar homes that didn't
[2:17:21] matter to us
[2:17:22] we weren't trying to be somebody we
[2:17:24] weren't
[2:17:25] we were just trying not to be beat out
[2:17:27] by the insurance company
[2:17:30] we wanted comparable to what we paid for
[2:17:32] already
[2:17:33] and you know what it took a while
[2:17:36] still not finished
[2:17:38] i mean it amazing when they can do the
[2:17:40] whole house except about five feet
[2:17:43] in the just right what you step into
[2:17:45] when you come into the house all the way
[2:17:47] to the fireplace it's not finished yet
[2:17:49] but it don't matter we're just learning
[2:17:51] love we we didn't want to settle and we
[2:17:54] didn't have to but everybody don't like
[2:17:56] the same thing
[2:17:58] some people like big windows and other
[2:18:00] women look at those big windows and they
[2:18:02] say
[2:18:02] i don't want that big window in my house
[2:18:04] something for me to have to clean
[2:18:07] we don't have to be alike
[2:18:11] in every like and dislike
[2:18:14] we don't have to see eye to eye on every
[2:18:17] little facet of life
[2:18:20] but when we come into this house
[2:18:25] we must be able
[2:18:28] everybody
[2:18:30] from the pastor down
[2:18:32] to lay aside everything that divides us
[2:18:38] our hurt feelings of the past our
[2:18:41] mistreatment of the past whatever has
[2:18:44] happened in the past
[2:18:46] when we come in here we must come
[2:18:49] unified to stand on that
[2:18:53] word
[2:18:55] because there'll be unbelievers among us
[2:18:58] there'll be meg believers among us
[2:19:01] there'll be newcomers that come along
[2:19:04] and they need to see god
[2:19:06] in the fullness of his power
[2:19:10] they don't need to just hear me talk
[2:19:12] about what he can do they need to stay
[2:19:14] and do it
[2:19:15] [Music]
[2:19:15] [Applause]
[2:19:17] and so you and i
[2:19:19] must come to a place
[2:19:21] and i'm telling you what
[2:19:23] it won't be by washing one another's
[2:19:25] feet that we get there it'll not be by
[2:19:28] having dinner necessarily one another
[2:19:30] will get there it'll only be by it's
[2:19:32] finding a place before god on our knees
[2:19:36] on our faces and laying it all before
[2:19:39] him
[2:19:40] and letting him give back to us what
[2:19:42] matters
[2:19:43] and keep what matters not
[2:19:46] in the economy of god's kingdom
[2:19:49] we got to get all that out we're not
[2:19:51] near there we got to get all of that out
[2:19:54] it all has to be out
[2:19:57] and you i can do mine you can do yours
[2:19:59] if you'll spend your time i'll spend my
[2:20:01] time you do your carpet time i'll do my
[2:20:04] carpet time and god will let us come
[2:20:06] together and stand on this word in
[2:20:09] oneness with him in oneness with the
[2:20:11] word in oneness with one another
[2:20:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:20:17] there will be a power put into the
[2:20:19] church and now is coming in that the
[2:20:21] holy spirit will so anoint the people
[2:20:24] till they'll speak the word
[2:20:26] and it'll create itself right there
[2:20:28] we haven't seen like that say unto the
[2:20:30] mountain be moved don't doubt in your
[2:20:31] heart but believe that what you've said
[2:20:33] shall come to pass you can have what
[2:20:34] you've said the placing of the church in
[2:20:36] position where the fullness of the power
[2:20:39] of the holy ghost comes into the church
[2:20:42] the critics mouths will be shut
[2:20:46] listen
[2:20:48] that is talking about out there
[2:20:53] there should be no critics among us
[2:20:58] we shouldn't be critics of one another
[2:21:01] in no shape form or fashion
[2:21:06] you don't like my socks
[2:21:10] i'll never make you wear them
[2:21:13] you understand
[2:21:17] i hear people grumbling among i don't i
[2:21:20] don't hear it firsthand because a lot of
[2:21:22] people won't do that they'll send it
[2:21:25] there's people who know just who to
[2:21:27] grumble in front of
[2:21:28] just be honest
[2:21:30] because they don't get back people
[2:21:31] grumbling about this or that that's too
[2:21:33] loud that's not loud enough this i can't
[2:21:35] even sit during worship i can't do this
[2:21:37] i can't do that listen here's what you
[2:21:38] need to know we'll never please
[2:21:40] everybody
[2:21:42] and some of you
[2:21:43] are extremely
[2:21:45] difficult to please
[2:21:47] just ask your husband
[2:21:50] just ask your wife
[2:21:54] just ask somebody that loves you
[2:21:56] and so if you come in here with an
[2:21:58] attitude because of that
[2:22:01] you will set an atmosphere
[2:22:06] that's why i believe in being a church
[2:22:08] on time
[2:22:09] i believe people dragging in from here
[2:22:11] and there and all through the service i
[2:22:13] believe it sets an atmosphere you don't
[2:22:15] have to say well don't because you'll
[2:22:16] get in trouble
[2:22:18] i believe it creates an atmosphere that
[2:22:21] we need to improve upon
[2:22:24] i believe it shows something i believe
[2:22:26] the way people sit in church brother
[2:22:28] can make a difference
[2:22:30] i do
[2:22:31] i believe if people come into a church
[2:22:33] and slouch
[2:22:35] it creates an atmosphere of i don't care
[2:22:39] how many of you would do that in a job
[2:22:41] interview
[2:22:43] how many of you would go before someone
[2:22:44] who you wanted to hire you and you would
[2:22:46] slouch down in the chair until your neck
[2:22:48] was resting on the back of the chair and
[2:22:50] you and you just just acted like that
[2:22:53] like you could just hardly move
[2:22:55] what we don't understand is because of
[2:22:57] who we are we carry something
[2:22:59] because of who we are we carry something
[2:23:01] and everything we do the way we move the
[2:23:04] way we talk it says stuff
[2:23:07] it speaks didn't your mama ever tell you
[2:23:09] actions speak louder than words
[2:23:13] that's why i tell people that come into
[2:23:14] the house of god and trim their
[2:23:15] fingernails during the preaching i say
[2:23:17] that is disrespectful to the house of
[2:23:20] god
[2:23:22] do that before you come
[2:23:24] when people see you they see that you
[2:23:26] are not engaged they see that you are
[2:23:29] not putting your effort in and it's
[2:23:31] easier for them to take the same
[2:23:33] position
[2:23:35] come on somebody said well i don't think
[2:23:37] you ought to be wasting our time telling
[2:23:38] you that listen
[2:23:39] i am the watchman
[2:23:42] no matter how many times i resign
[2:23:45] between sunday to sunday i still have to
[2:23:47] get right up here and do my job if i was
[2:23:50] just harping and carrying on and i
[2:23:52] didn't think there was anything to it i
[2:23:54] would be afraid of what god might do to
[2:23:56] me but because i have watched these
[2:23:58] things for so many years now
[2:24:02] we were sitting at our
[2:24:04] table yes bless him lord he needs it
[2:24:08] bless pastor shelly
[2:24:11] we were sitting at our breakfast table
[2:24:13] this week
[2:24:14] and we were talking a little bit i was
[2:24:16] talking to this some of them
[2:24:18] about how these things came into the
[2:24:20] pentecostal church
[2:24:22] and what a change it made
[2:24:26] little things
[2:24:28] little things
[2:24:30] you realize that the pentecostal church
[2:24:32] has gone from an era we weren't talking
[2:24:34] about fear so i'll tell you what we were
[2:24:35] talking about we're talking about
[2:24:36] cutting bangs
[2:24:39] i remember when they came and asked the
[2:24:41] elders of the church if it was all right
[2:24:42] for them to cut their veins
[2:24:44] i know brother branham i know brother
[2:24:46] branham's daughters i know this i know
[2:24:48] that just like you do
[2:24:50] but i was there when they come and ask
[2:24:52] the elders could we start this was women
[2:24:53] with long hair never put scissors in
[2:24:55] there and they and they said can we come
[2:24:57] and start well i ain't going back after
[2:24:58] you leave here today you may go out here
[2:25:00] saying i'm never going back to that
[2:25:02] church but i want you to know before you
[2:25:03] go we love you
[2:25:08] you've tuned in we love you we're not
[2:25:09] trying to hurt anybody condemn anybody
[2:25:11] i'm telling you the problem is i've
[2:25:13] lived long enough now to see how things
[2:25:15] can creep creep
[2:25:17] and sometimes we preach on things that
[2:25:19] aren't aren't so relevant to us
[2:25:22] praying that we can see what is
[2:25:25] they come and they said we just need to
[2:25:26] do a little bit we just need to fix it
[2:25:28] they're just something and the elder
[2:25:29] said well i don't guess there'll be no
[2:25:30] islam i don't know i don't care there's
[2:25:31] no harm in that i get i don't get to be
[2:25:34] and so the next thing you know
[2:25:37] it got more and more and more and they
[2:25:38] didn't just fool with the front
[2:25:41] they started working on the back
[2:25:44] yes that's right it may not matter to
[2:25:46] you it matters to me
[2:25:47] and according to first corinthians
[2:25:48] chapter 11 it belongs it matters to god
[2:25:51] so be careful be careful
[2:25:53] be careful how you respond
[2:25:56] and so it got worse and worse and worse
[2:25:58] and worse and worse and now it's just
[2:25:59] like the prophet said a woman that was
[2:26:01] going to wash jesus's feet with her hair
[2:26:03] from the pentecostal church today would
[2:26:04] beat her brains out
[2:26:07] because she wears the haircut of a man
[2:26:11] there's no separation at all
[2:26:14] and it didn't start that way
[2:26:16] it started by people thinking i don't
[2:26:19] have to do just like they're i can i can
[2:26:21] i can set a trend
[2:26:25] i can put baubles around my neck
[2:26:28] i can do this i can do that i don't have
[2:26:30] to be just like
[2:26:32] and the next thing you know
[2:26:34] it creates
[2:26:35] an undercurrent and an atmosphere that
[2:26:38] brings a people out of function and out
[2:26:41] of joint
[2:26:43] and i'm telling you we may never agree
[2:26:44] on all those things
[2:26:46] all right i recognize it we may not all
[2:26:48] agree on those things but what we need
[2:26:50] to understand is when we come into this
[2:26:52] house
[2:26:53] we don't bring our differences with us
[2:26:56] we come to stand on the word together
[2:26:58] how many of you would like to see a son
[2:27:00] of god raise up i'd like for it to be
[2:27:02] among you i'd like for to be in the pew
[2:27:04] how many of you like to see a son of god
[2:27:06] raise up speak the creative word of god
[2:27:08] and watch it materialize because the
[2:27:10] people were able to put their
[2:27:11] differences aside when they got in the
[2:27:14] presence of god
[2:27:16] and catch the inspiration of the hour
[2:27:20] and by the spoken word create a
[2:27:22] digestive system that can do what it was
[2:27:25] created to do
[2:27:29] by the creative spoken word of god take
[2:27:32] a tumor right out of a body
[2:27:33] [Music]
[2:27:37] you you you might not believe it i'm
[2:27:39] closing
[2:27:40] musicians coming you may not believe it
[2:27:43] but with my very own eyes i've seen
[2:27:46] people cough tumors out of their mouth
[2:27:49] i want to look at once you i want to
[2:27:50] make sure you know i'm not lying to you
[2:27:53] i've seen it
[2:27:54] myself cough up tumors and and spit them
[2:27:58] out in their hand
[2:28:01] i've seen growths fall off of people's
[2:28:04] bodies
[2:28:05] under a false message
[2:28:12] preaching a trinitarian doctrine
[2:28:14] baptizing people in titles
[2:28:17] but i saw those things
[2:28:19] in my life i saw blind eyes open and
[2:28:22] deaf ears unstopped and crippled i saw
[2:28:25] that little missy
[2:28:27] with a broken back
[2:28:28] who came into the tent meeting over
[2:28:30] there at 8 100 cooper creek road
[2:28:33] in a back brace
[2:28:35] the doctor said she'd wear it prob might
[2:28:37] have to wear it the rest of her life
[2:28:39] because the break was so bad and god
[2:28:42] came down under that tent and healed
[2:28:43] that little girl they took that brace
[2:28:45] off for her and she ran up cooper creek
[2:28:47] road
[2:28:52] i saw that boy in in evansville indiana
[2:28:55] where the weed eater had taken out his
[2:28:57] eyes
[2:28:58] and he was blind and he believed god and
[2:29:01] god recreated eyes
[2:29:04] and let him see and brought his whole
[2:29:07] family to god
[2:29:10] i've seen garter swallowed
[2:29:12] i've seen tumors in women's bellies
[2:29:14] disappear
[2:29:17] and their dresses you'd have thought
[2:29:19] they were pregnant i can give you names
[2:29:22] you'd have thought they were pregnant
[2:29:24] because their dress is tinted out just
[2:29:26] like that
[2:29:27] because they carry tumors some from
[2:29:29] their reproductive organs some from
[2:29:31] their stomach
[2:29:32] and i've seen god heal them
[2:29:35] and caused those tomb or no kicking
[2:29:38] not even jack coe style just holy ghost
[2:29:41] prayer
[2:29:42] and i've seen those tumors disappear
[2:29:43] brother richard and it would have been
[2:29:45] like somebody stuck a pen in a in a
[2:29:47] beach
[2:29:48] ball laying flat on the floor and their
[2:29:51] belly's sticking up like that and all of
[2:29:53] a sudden
[2:29:58] you may think this is vulgar i've seen
[2:30:00] women grab their underclothes
[2:30:04] to get out the door to the bathroom
[2:30:08] because the tumor got was gone and
[2:30:10] because their their underclothes were
[2:30:12] four or five sizes too big now with the
[2:30:15] tumor gone
[2:30:16] and they didn't want to walk down the
[2:30:17] aisle and lose their drawers
[2:30:19] now if you think that's i don't care
[2:30:20] right now
[2:30:22] how it sounded
[2:30:25] i tell you you'd like to see that too
[2:30:28] and dresses they'd have to hold her
[2:30:30] dress up like this because it was so big
[2:30:34] that now it hung and it'd be hanging
[2:30:36] down like this and then have to hold it
[2:30:38] and go out the door like this let me
[2:30:39] tell you something
[2:30:43] that's what god can do
[2:30:46] and i want to say again that was
[2:30:49] where's the rest of the musicians
[2:30:50] [Music]
[2:30:53] that was under a half truth
[2:30:59] it was holiness
[2:31:01] it was separated living
[2:31:03] but we didn't have the message of the
[2:31:05] hour we didn't have the godhead we
[2:31:06] didn't have the right order for baptism
[2:31:10] we didn't understand those things
[2:31:12] and yet god moved because people came
[2:31:14] together in faith
[2:31:15] come on now
[2:31:16] i saw the dead raised
[2:31:19] i know what god can do
[2:31:21] i know what he's able to do and i'm not
[2:31:23] looking for a show i'm not desiring a
[2:31:26] show i'm not even hoping for a show
[2:31:30] what i'm hoping is to see god's sons
[2:31:33] place
[2:31:36] so that we can see people transform
[2:31:49] i had a woman
[2:31:51] to write me this week i hope i don't
[2:31:53] offend this woman
[2:31:55] for saying this
[2:31:58] she said brother shelly my daughter's 11
[2:32:00] years old
[2:32:01] and she tells me that she's a lesbian
[2:32:06] would you please pray
[2:32:08] would you pray for her i don't even know
[2:32:11] how
[2:32:12] to help her
[2:32:14] i don't even know what to say to her
[2:32:16] really i've said everything i know to
[2:32:19] say
[2:32:19] and i don't know what else to say to her
[2:32:21] but she's so mad at me because i won't
[2:32:24] let her dress like a boy and she's so
[2:32:26] mad at me because i won't let her call
[2:32:27] herself another name and she's so mad at
[2:32:30] me
[2:32:31] and she said i honestly wonder brother
[2:32:34] shelly if she might try to take my life
[2:32:37] because she is so angry with me my heart
[2:32:41] crumbles into a thousand pieces
[2:32:46] when i think of a mother's pain
[2:32:50] i know there's a heliwood
[2:32:53] i know there's an agenda out there that
[2:32:55] tells us we have to be accepting and
[2:32:57] tolerant and understanding of this and
[2:32:59] that and the other
[2:33:00] and and we should be more in the church
[2:33:02] it needs to be i understand all that but
[2:33:04] i want to tell you something you'll
[2:33:05] never sell that baloney you'll never
[2:33:08] sell that lie to the mother that reached
[2:33:10] out to me
[2:33:13] oh she sees as a girl that's about to
[2:33:16] make choices when she's old enough that
[2:33:19] will change her life and some that she
[2:33:22] may never be able to fight her way back
[2:33:24] through brother when i hear something
[2:33:26] like that i say oh god that
[2:33:29] you'll never talk that spirit off that
[2:33:32] girl
[2:33:32] you'll never counsel that spirit off
[2:33:35] that girl it's out to destroy her that
[2:33:39] devil didn't come to confuse her he came
[2:33:42] to kill her
[2:33:45] and you'll never talk him off
[2:33:47] you'll never push him back with an
[2:33:49] article
[2:33:50] there's only one thing that'll ever set
[2:33:52] that little girl free and that's a son
[2:33:55] of god being placed in his position to
[2:33:58] use the word of god against that devil
[2:34:02] most of us would be so afraid of
[2:34:04] offending and hurting her feelings and
[2:34:06] her running out of the church
[2:34:09] most people would be so afraid of how in
[2:34:11] the world you're going to handle a
[2:34:13] situation like that that they wouldn't
[2:34:14] even understand that what we do is like
[2:34:17] putting a bottle of their mouth
[2:34:19] we need a power of god let me tell you
[2:34:23] something that's worth laying down every
[2:34:25] axe that's worth burying every hatchet
[2:34:28] that's worth getting all of our opinions
[2:34:30] out of the way that's worth singing a
[2:34:33] song you don't like and enduring a
[2:34:35] worship leader you don't like and
[2:34:36] sitting under a pastor you don't like
[2:34:38] that's worth all of that
[2:34:41] if we could just get to a place where
[2:34:43] sons of god could be placed in this
[2:34:45] church among us i do not believe that
[2:34:47] everybody will chew the
[2:34:49] the meat the the meal that's been laid
[2:34:52] before you today i do not expect that

[2:38:22] some of the things the enemy sends
[2:38:24] to distract you in a service
[2:38:27] if you don't make up your mind i didn't
[2:38:30] come to be seen
[2:38:33] or to see
[2:38:35] i came to lift up and magnify and
[2:38:39] glorify the name of jesus i came to put
[2:38:43] in my so be it to the word of god
[2:38:48] and if we can do that if we can do that
[2:38:57] you take inventory like i have like i am
[2:39:02] i found a place in me
[2:39:05] this week where fear
[2:39:07] was laying
[2:39:09] and i didn't know it
[2:39:11] oh i don't believe it i did i yes
[2:39:15] yes i didn't know it just play something
[2:39:19] i didn't know it was laying there like
[2:39:20] that
[2:39:22] i mean i know on occasion anybody can
[2:39:23] get afraid
[2:39:25] but i found a place in me a silly little
[2:39:27] place
[2:39:28] where fear was laying
[2:39:32] and i went after it
[2:39:36] i didn't say anything to my family they
[2:39:38] knew i'd been struggling some this week
[2:39:40] i don't like change any more than
[2:39:42] anybody else
[2:39:43] i like knowing where my handkerchiefs
[2:39:45] are
[2:39:47] and they knew i was just struggling i i
[2:39:49] let it somehow affect me you know you
[2:39:52] carry it
[2:39:53] it wouldn't bother you some of you
[2:39:54] wouldn't bother you you just all you
[2:39:56] could see is the nice floors i will i'd
[2:39:58] like to be like you
[2:40:00] but it just threw me kind of out of
[2:40:02] sorts and i was struggling to get
[2:40:03] through it but i didn't say anything to
[2:40:05] my family about this
[2:40:07] but i saw a little place where fear was
[2:40:09] laying in me
[2:40:11] and you know when god pointed it out to
[2:40:13] me he tried to show me i realized this
[2:40:15] morning he tried to show me a couple
[2:40:17] times this week when i was praying but i
[2:40:19] didn't get the message
[2:40:21] but where i was able to identify this
[2:40:23] morning is when we started singing the
[2:40:25] voice of truth
[2:40:28] and we came to that line
[2:40:31] surrounded
[2:40:33] by
[2:40:38] surrounded by the sound of
[2:40:40] a thousand warriors shaking in their
[2:40:42] armor
[2:40:44] wishing they to have the strength to
[2:40:47] stay
[2:40:51] if that don't get you
[2:40:53] these weren't philistines
[2:40:57] these were the children of god
[2:41:01] these were israelites
[2:41:04] and now all they can do is stand there
[2:41:06] and tremble in their armor
[2:41:08] wishing that they could have been the
[2:41:10] one to run out and meet the challenge
[2:41:12] and i found a place i really put my
[2:41:15] finger on a place where i was afraid to
[2:41:17] meet a challenge
[2:41:20] and i gave it to god
[2:41:23] i gave it to god under the inspiration
[2:41:25] of the words of that song i gave it to
[2:41:26] god there's a voice of truth there's a
[2:41:28] voice of truth there's a voice of truth
[2:41:33] that says you can
[2:41:35] take inventory of your life right now
[2:41:36] and see if you need to go and get some
[2:41:38] things that belong to you see if you

[2:44:39] feet you can
[2:44:41] you're the only one that can put him
[2:44:43] there i can't put him there for you you
[2:44:45] can't put him there for me
[2:44:47] but the word has given you authority
[2:44:49] over that enemy
[2:44:51] the word has given you authority over
[2:44:53] that enemy and if you're taking
[2:44:54] inventory of your life right now and you
[2:44:57] recognize there's some missing stuff
[2:44:59] there are some things that have been
[2:45:00] stolen off your shelf
[2:45:02] i've been reading in the neighborhood
[2:45:04] watch around here where people are
[2:45:06] their security cameras are picking up
[2:45:08] people coming in their yard
[2:45:10] they're they're scouting it out at night
[2:45:12] two and three o'clock in the morning
[2:45:13] coming to see if they can come in to see
[2:45:15] if there's a way to get in and some of
[2:45:17] them have those cameras you speak speak
[2:45:19] through you know and you see them
[2:45:21] running off i don't like the thought of
[2:45:22] that
[2:45:23] but i know what you can you can
[2:45:25] certainly put some blood around your
[2:45:27] house you can certainly put the word of
[2:45:29] god around that you can certainly claim
[2:45:32] the victory over that
[2:45:33] you can believe god to try in his word
[2:45:36] in his name
[2:45:38] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[2:45:40] the righteous run into it and are saying
[2:45:43] i'm not going to let fear get in my
[2:45:44] heart about that but there's an enemy
[2:45:47] one you can't pick up on the security
[2:45:48] camera who's lurching who's see seeking
[2:45:52] around roaming around seeking whom he
[2:45:54] may devour he's looking if he hasn't got
[2:45:56] your stuff yet he wants to take your joy
[2:45:59] he wants to take your victory he wants
[2:46:01] to take your vision he wants to take
[2:46:03] your desire
[2:46:06] not that he's going to do anything with
[2:46:08] it he just don't want you to have a
[2:46:09] desire for more of god
[2:46:11] and only you can find it's not my place
[2:46:13] i can lay it out there i can give
[2:46:14] examples
[2:46:15] but it's your place to find out what the
[2:46:17] enemy is pulling over on you and it's
[2:46:19] your place to take the name of jesus and
[2:46:22] the word of god and the blood that god
[2:46:23] created for redemption and apply those
[2:46:25] weapons
[2:46:27] against the lies of the enemy there's a
[2:46:28] voice of truth that says something else
[2:46:30] there's a voice of truth that says
[2:46:31] something else
[2:46:33] and we're not going to hold you any
[2:46:35] longer than this
[2:46:36] but i want to invite those of you who
[2:46:38] can take a quick inventory who can see
[2:46:41] that there are some missing things in
[2:46:42] your life things you've once had in
[2:46:44] christ things you once used and enjoyed
[2:46:46] and part of who you are in christ and
[2:46:49] the enemy has somehow buffeted you
[2:46:51] and he's been able to slip that out from
[2:46:53] under your nose
[2:46:55] it's true
[2:46:56] because if we're watching
[2:46:58] if we're watching the only way he can do
[2:46:59] it's right under our nose
[2:47:02] you know be nice if we think about him
[2:47:03] just slipping in at night but that's not
[2:47:05] really the way it works against the
[2:47:06] bride of christ i'm telling you he knows
[2:47:08] better than that
[2:47:09] sometimes he waits until we're
[2:47:10] vulnerable right till we got a wounded
[2:47:12] lick
[2:47:13] and then he comes right walking in the
[2:47:15] door
[2:47:16] that's right yes sir
[2:47:18] right up to us selling us a bill of
[2:47:19] goods
[2:47:20] and we're weak and we take that
[2:47:23] and we don't realize that it's just like
[2:47:24] sticking a a pen
[2:47:26] in something in a slow like you get a
[2:47:28] little
[2:47:31] i'll get in a minute a little tack in
[2:47:32] your tire not a big old nail
[2:47:35] but a little tack in your tire and it'll
[2:47:37] go and go it'll leak slow and slow and
[2:47:39] slow and slow you'll fill it up and
[2:47:41] it'll leak out again
[2:47:43] and i'll tell you the enemy knows how to
[2:47:45] work amen and he does it so that you'll
[2:47:47] get used to doing it you know you what
[2:47:49] you'll put off getting your tire fixed
[2:47:50] you'll you'll put more air in it
[2:47:53] some people would rather put more air in
[2:47:55] it a time and time again than to take it
[2:47:57] down there and get it fixed am i telling
[2:47:59] the truth there are people like that the
[2:48:00] enemy takes advantage of people like
[2:48:02] that
[2:48:03] you recognize something's leaking out
[2:48:05] but you won't do anything about it you'd
[2:48:06] rather just keep filling it up from time
[2:48:08] to time no no no no
[2:48:10] why don't you find the brad why don't
[2:48:12] you find the tack why don't you find the
[2:48:14] nail why don't you find the
[2:48:15] vulnerability in your life why don't you
[2:48:17] find the leaky place and say no more no
[2:48:19] more there's a voice of truth that tells
[2:48:20] me i can walk in victory that's right
[2:48:22] there's a voice of truth that says i can
[2:48:24] stand on the word and be what god has
[2:48:25] called me to be
[2:48:27] if you want to come i'm inviting you you
[2:48:28] don't have to come but if you want to
[2:48:30] come you're welcome to come and stand

[2:49:18] that you need to deal with you can deal
[2:49:20] with it nobody's going to come far as i
[2:49:22] know

[2:49:27] for you to say i want back i want to
[2:49:29] take back
[2:49:30] i want to take back
[2:49:32] what the enemy has stolen from me are
[2:49:34] you still with me church
[2:49:36] all right let us just go to the lord in
[2:49:37] prayer right now let's go to the lord in
[2:49:39] prayer every one of us right where you
[2:49:41] are they'll play something together it
[2:49:42] doesn't have to be bad it can be
[2:49:44] something else
[2:49:46] but let's just go to prayer every one of
[2:49:48] us and let's talk to the lord about it
[2:49:49] father we stand here today
[2:49:53] stirred by your word
[2:49:56] stirred by the truth that you have shown
[2:49:58] us today
[2:50:00] we're thankful for what you've spoken to
[2:50:02] us in the word and through the message
[2:50:03] of the hour
[2:50:05] and lord we recognize that the enemy has
[2:50:08] succeeded in some of our lives
[2:50:10] of stealing some victory some joy some
[2:50:13] peace
[2:50:16] he has come
[2:50:18] and he has slipped out
[2:50:20] some things that we need
[2:50:24] things that are constructive
[2:50:27] to create the right atmosphere
[2:50:30] for our family
[2:50:32] for our home
[2:50:33] for our spiritual life and so we come
[2:50:36] today saying lord we need grace
[2:50:40] to take it back
[2:50:42] the thief cometh not but for to steal to
[2:50:44] kill and to destroy
[2:50:46] but your word says that you have come
[2:50:48] that we might have life
[2:50:51] and that we might have it more
[2:50:52] abundantly
[2:50:54] and we don't want to spend more time
[2:50:55] focusing on what the enemy does
[2:50:58] we want to spend more of our time
[2:50:59] focusing on the what the goodness of the
[2:51:01] lord is doing and what he's
[2:51:03] accomplishing so we ask right now
[2:51:05] for the wisdom of the lord to be upon
[2:51:07] each of us that we would be able to
[2:51:09] identify every area of our life where
[2:51:12] the enemy has taken something that we
[2:51:14] have once walked in
[2:51:15] we would like to get our eyes on some
[2:51:17] things that we have never walked in
[2:51:20] but until we until we can get back what
[2:51:22] we have
[2:51:24] had walked in in the past what you've
[2:51:26] given us in the past the victory that
[2:51:28] we've known the liberty
[2:51:30] the freedom that we've once known
[2:51:32] that driving passion that drives us
[2:51:36] to set ourselves under the word
[2:51:38] and to make every part of who we are
