Description:
Before the beginning of creation, before the worlds were ever formed, there was a longing desire in the heart of God to have a Bride - a Wife that was a part of Himself. Expressed throughout history, He has placed within this chosen people a seed that is His Own very Life, and today, God’s eternal love is projecting towards this Bride, drawing her back to Himself in union and in oneness. It’s all about the Bride!
