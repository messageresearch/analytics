[56:18] that um I'm from South Africa and um the
[56:22] first time I came to America was in 200
[56:25] 19 me and my wife we came with some
[56:27] friends and we went through some of the
[56:29] places in America and if you are from
[56:31] South Africa you can easily pick up a
[56:34] racist Spirit if you're from South
[56:37] Africa within seconds you can pick it up
[56:40] but I'm telling you in 2019 when we came
[56:42] through America I could I could pick up
[56:44] uh a racism spirit and I think it was
[56:47] the same year or the year after that
[56:49] that that big thing happened in America
[56:51] where they killed that guy the policeman
[56:53] and what has happened there I can't
[56:54] breathe and whatever happened there um
[56:57] you know what but this is my second
[56:59] visit to America and I didn't feel one
[57:03] for one
[57:04] moment when Benjamin picked us up
[57:06] brother Benjamin picked us up we just
[57:08] felt the Holy Spirit a clean Spirit you
[57:12] know that's what that's what brother
[57:13] Brandon produced and that's the
[57:16] inheritance of the Bride to have the
[57:18] Supernatural and the spirit of God that
[57:21] sweet kind Dove the nature of Ave and a
[57:25] lamb but explained it to us we have no
[57:28] excuse but to carry that character on us
[57:32] and I'm telling you not one time did I
[57:34] feel that Spirit or any Spirit here I
[57:37] just felt the holy spirit in this place
[57:40] and I want I just want to compliment

[1:02:06] amen because we want to we want to keep
[1:02:08] the name of Jesus holy is it right
[1:02:11] praise the name of the Lord so I just
[1:02:12] want to thank you all uh can a sister
[1:02:14] just put up that scripture I'm just
[1:02:15] going to for two minutes just read the
[1:02:17] scripture there in John chapter 4
[1:02:19] because this camp meeting was inspired
[1:02:21] by John chapter 4 you can put up verse
[1:02:23] 23 and verse 4 if it's okay verse 23 and
[1:02:26] verse 24 amen I just want to show you
[1:02:29] something there praise God um and we are
[1:02:31] so excited Amen to worship him because
[1:02:34] what happened here in John chapter 4 uh
[1:02:37] um is that Jesus is dealing here with a
[1:02:42] woman that have a water
[1:02:44] problem she had five husbands so I I
[1:02:47] hope you understand what I'm talking
[1:02:48] about she had a water problem she went
[1:02:50] from one man to another man she wanted
[1:02:52] to be satisfied she was looking for the
[1:02:55] Hest of satisfaction and she couldn't
[1:02:57] find it from no
[1:03:00] man and that woman was in that condition
[1:03:03] one day the Lord sold me in the spirit
[1:03:05] the reason she was in that condition
[1:03:06] everybody rebuked that woman for a
[1:03:08] condition but the Lord show me one time
[1:03:10] that that woman was in that condition
[1:03:12] because in her City Samaria had had had
[1:03:15] weak
[1:03:17] men and because of weak men he was in
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:21] condition so don't only just down the
[1:03:24] the the woman of at the well amen praise
[1:03:27] God because the men wasn't strong in
[1:03:29] that City that's why she could run in
[1:03:32] the city and say I found a
[1:03:36] man and you cannot be a man unless
[1:03:39] you've met the man Jesus
[1:03:42] Christ you will never know how to love a
[1:03:46] woman if you don't know
[1:03:49] Jesus because God is
[1:03:53] love if you're looking for a nice
[1:03:55] romantic story first make contact with
[1:03:59] Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ when we were in the world we
[1:04:03] thought we know what love is we used
[1:04:06] words to express love we know nothing
[1:04:08] about love let me tell you this world
[1:04:10] out here they know nothing about love if
[1:04:12] you want to know what love is God is
[1:04:17] love oh and she found love she found
[1:04:21] love now watch here so Jesus had to deal
[1:04:23] with this woman she had water problem
[1:04:25] she had a water
[1:04:28] problem and then Jesus moved from the he
[1:04:31] dealt with her with the hter problem and
[1:04:33] from the hter problem he went over to
[1:04:36] the worship
[1:04:39] problem I hope you see it this woman had
[1:04:41] the heart problem and Jesus told her the
[1:04:44] Hest of
[1:04:45] satisfaction is the word of God it's the
[1:04:48] spirit of the
[1:04:50] Lord and then he had to move over all of
[1:04:52] a sudden they moved to away from the h
[1:04:55] problem and they were talking about the
[1:04:57] worship problem because there was a
[1:04:59] worship problem as well and I believe
[1:05:01] even in the message we have a worship
[1:05:03] [Applause]
[1:05:06] problem so Jesus was in a debate with
[1:05:09] this woman about the ho problem and he
[1:05:13] was in a debate with her about worship
[1:05:16] ohoo Lord if you want a debate of
[1:05:18] worship I'm telling you you're going to
[1:05:20] deal with Jesus Christ because he wants
[1:05:23] to be worshiped
[1:05:25] and he wants you to worship Him in
[1:05:27] spirit and in
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:30] truth a debate and this woman amen was
[1:05:35] seeking for water but Jesus was seeking
[1:05:37] for worship just give me two minutes I'm
[1:05:39] going I won't be long amen she was she
[1:05:42] was thirsting for water but according to
[1:05:45] this scripture the father seeketh such
[1:05:47] worshippers so the father was thirsty
[1:05:50] for
[1:05:52] worship oh God is thirsty for your
[1:05:55] worship he wants to be
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:05:58] worshiped and he dealt with this woman
[1:06:00] watch here he dealt with this woman amen
[1:06:03] and I want you to see this so we changed
[1:06:05] from a water problem to a worship
[1:06:07] problem Our God don't receive any
[1:06:12] worship not just any type of worship
[1:06:16] amen I want you to see that he's not
[1:06:17] satisfied with any type of a worship
[1:06:20] according to the
[1:06:22] scripture he wants to be worship sh in
[1:06:24] spirit and in truth and the father
[1:06:27] seeketh such to worship
[1:06:30] him ohoo
[1:06:32] Lord I think he's seeking right now in
[1:06:34] the message of the hour he's seeking for
[1:06:36] such worshippers that can worship Him in
[1:06:38] spirit and in truth now listen there's a
[1:06:41] chosen place of
[1:06:43] worship but there's also a chosen way of
[1:06:48] worship I hope you see it there's a
[1:06:51] chosen place of worship brother B told
[1:06:53] us but there's also a chosen way of
[1:06:56] worship because this woman thought she
[1:06:59] said the Jews worship there and we
[1:07:00] worship
[1:07:03] here and Jesus changed it
[1:07:06] from where to worship and he changed it
[1:07:09] to How To
[1:07:10] Worship so you can be in the message you
[1:07:13] can be in the right chosen place of
[1:07:16] worship but it doesn't mean you have the
[1:07:19] chosen way of
[1:07:22] worship because you need to worship sh
[1:07:24] him in spirit and in truth for we seek
[1:07:29] such worshippers amen you can be in the
[1:07:33] right place of worship but are you
[1:07:35] worshiping him the right way very
[1:07:38] important it's very important so first
[1:07:41] he had to deal with the hots of
[1:07:42] satisfaction and then he dealt with the
[1:07:44] worship that brings sa
[1:07:47] satisfaction amen this is the worship
[1:07:49] that satisfy God is to worship Him in
[1:07:52] spirit and in truth I hope you see it
[1:07:55] but just quickly I want to say this God
[1:07:57] is a god of numbers because watch here
[1:07:58] in John chapter 4 why is this in John
[1:08:01] chapter 4 because this woman I want you
[1:08:03] to see this now this woman had five
[1:08:07] husbands five men and the one you have
[1:08:10] now the sixth
[1:08:12] one I want you to see it now six is a
[1:08:14] fallen number it's a number of a wrong
[1:08:17] worship
[1:08:20] system but here the seventh Man Came
[1:08:23] Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] and he showed her how to worship I hope
[1:08:29] you see it amen I hope you see it and
[1:08:32] that's why God sent William brandham the
[1:08:33] seven Angel messenger Amen to come and
[1:08:36] to show us how to worship God in spirit
[1:08:39] and in truth is that right Jesus
[1:08:42] introduced this woman to how to worship
[1:08:44] God in spirit and in truth and here God
[1:08:46] s and Jesus was the seventh man and here
[1:08:49] Jesus amen William brandham a son of men
[1:08:51] for our day came and turned our hearts
[1:08:53] back to the Pentecostal Faith to serve
[1:08:56] God and to worship God in spirit and in
[1:09:01] truth now listen not just in word not
[1:09:05] just in truth but in spirit of Truth and
[1:09:09] brother preach Spirit of truth even but
[1:09:11] I want you to see this if I may quickly
[1:09:13] I want you to see the number four the
[1:09:14] coming of the Lord is quickly in number
[1:09:16] four I want you to see this the God gave
[1:09:19] us the Rapture numbers and the Mysteries
[1:09:20] and secrets brother Brenham gave it to
[1:09:22] us it's in the message of the hour
[1:09:24] rapturing faith I believe is in the
[1:09:27] message now watch here I want you to see
[1:09:29] number four the coming of the Lord amen
[1:09:31] Malachi 4 you can see the coming of the
[1:09:34] Lord in number four amen you can see the
[1:09:36] coming of the Lord says Revelation
[1:09:38] chapter 4 is the
[1:09:39] rapture the Fourth Man In The Fire
[1:09:41] changed their bodies body chains on the
[1:09:44] fourth day he resurrected
[1:09:47] Lazarus so you can see the Rapture the
[1:09:49] body chains the resurrection under
[1:09:52] number four and it's also under number
[1:09:54] seven because the seven Angel brings
[1:09:56] rapturing Faith you need seven virtues
[1:09:59] for the Rapture the Rapture and the
[1:10:01] coming of the Lord is the seven seal the
[1:10:04] seven Thunders gives you rapturing Faith
[1:10:06] but I'm going to do something here I'm
[1:10:07] going to put four and seven together
[1:10:09] because it's so perfect I want you to
[1:10:11] see this why amen this woman in in in
[1:10:15] John chapter 4 the seventh man met her
[1:10:18] why in John chapter 4 and I want you to
[1:10:20] see number four and seven prophetically
[1:10:22] goes together right through the Bible
[1:10:25] I'm just going to give two or three but
[1:10:26] you can go right through the Bible I
[1:10:28] want you to see this watch you now
[1:10:29] brother Brenham was Malachi 4 but he was
[1:10:32] also the seventh
[1:10:35] angel can you see four and seven
[1:10:37] together there brother Brenham is amen
[1:10:40] the seventh angel anointed by the fourth
[1:10:43] living creatures anointing and anointing
[1:10:45] of an eagle four and seven together oh I
[1:10:49] hope you see it I hope you see it I hope
[1:10:51] you see it watch here amen brother Bram
[1:10:54] started his ministry in 1947 4 and7
[1:10:57] there's it again and you can go right
[1:10:59] through the word of God and see 4 and 7
[1:11:01] together amen the seven Church age after
[1:11:04] the seven Church AGS they go into the
[1:11:06] Rapture which is revelation 4 there's 4
[1:11:09] and seven
[1:11:10] again where do you find brother Brenham
[1:11:12] under the fourth seal and under the
[1:11:14] seventh
[1:11:16] seal the seven Angel is under the for
[1:11:19] seal woo Anointed with that eagle
[1:11:21] anointing I want you to see that this is
[1:11:23] very important and that's why in The
[1:11:25] Book of Daniel when they turn the fire
[1:11:27] seven times warmer the Fourth Man Step
[1:11:30] Into the Fire there's four and seven
[1:11:33] together in Genesis 1:14 God created the
[1:11:35] moon the sun and the
[1:11:37] Stars that's his first Bible that's his
[1:11:40] Redemption plan but right there do you
[1:11:42] know what day he created the sun moon
[1:11:44] and stars on the fourth
[1:11:46] day so where did he put the Seven Stars
[1:11:49] in the fourth day so there's four and
[1:11:51] seven again together so every time if
[1:11:53] you looking for the Rapture 4 and seven
[1:11:55] goes together god is perfect in his
[1:11:57] numerology and that's why in John
[1:11:59] chapter 4 the seventh man came into a
[1:12:01] life and that's a type of the end time
[1:12:04] that's a type of the son of the son of
[1:12:06] men and brother bham typed that woman uh
[1:12:08] uh to the Bride of Jesus Christ he said
[1:12:10] she was in that condition in a
[1:12:12] backsliding condition amen after six
[1:12:14] Church ages she was still in a
[1:12:16] backsliding condition but then the word
[1:12:18] for her day came the seven man came I
[1:12:22] Know a Man can turn on the light and
[1:12:25] brother benam said there was a seat a
[1:12:27] predestination inside of
[1:12:29] her and he HED that seed and that seed
[1:12:34] quickened amen and it came to life I

[1:18:16] me take your
[1:18:20] seats I want us to remember this week we
[1:18:25] didn't mention it last night I gave a
[1:18:27] little briefing at lunch yesterday to
[1:18:30] those who were here concerning the war
[1:18:33] that Israel has
[1:18:34] declared and they have had to do it in
[1:18:37] response to
[1:18:40] Hamas and now
[1:18:42] Hezbollah so they are being bombarded
[1:18:46] and attacked by Hamas in the South and
[1:18:51] Hezbollah in the North
[1:18:53] and uh there are dozens of Israeli
[1:18:57] citizens there are dozens of Israeli
[1:19:00] American citizens that have been taken
[1:19:04] hostage they have been able to liberate
[1:19:06] a number of hostages but Hamas has taken
[1:19:10] them and they're hiding them in the
[1:19:13] tunnels that go out of Gaza into Egypt
[1:19:17] and the tunnels that come out of the
[1:19:19] Gaza Strip into Israel they're
[1:19:21] announcing that they hiding the hostages
[1:19:24] there so that we will not bomb the
[1:19:26] tunnels there are over 600 deaths when
[1:19:31] we were making the briefing yesterday at
[1:19:33] lunch there were 100 almost 100 deaths
[1:19:37] and now there are over 600 deaths and uh
[1:19:41] they
[1:19:42] are
[1:19:44] uh prime minister Netanyahu has
[1:19:47] announced to the citizens of Gaza flee
[1:19:52] flee the GSA strip go into Egypt go
[1:19:56] wherever you can go hide while you can
[1:20:00] because ground troops are heading into
[1:20:03] the Gaza that will be air bombs and that
[1:20:07] will be tanks and that will be in
[1:20:09] infantry men marching into Gaza we're
[1:20:13] about to see some something big in the
[1:20:17] Middle East I heard a briefing this
[1:20:20] morning where the ambassador of Israel
[1:20:23] to the United Nation says that when this
[1:20:27] is finished Israel will never be the
[1:20:30] same again they're going to deal with
[1:20:32] the problem in the gasa it must happen
[1:20:37] because the word of God gives the
[1:20:39] boundaries that of the land that have
[1:20:42] been given to the Jewish people and we
[1:20:45] have to Israel is not perfect like I
[1:20:49] said yesterday they're not perfect their

[1:20:58] they've got one thing going for them God
[1:21:01] said I'm married to the land and I'm
[1:21:04] married to the people brother brandom
[1:21:07] said if you want to know what God is
[1:21:08] doing watch Israel watch the Jewish
[1:21:11] people watch Jerusalem and so we want to
[1:21:15] pray and we want to pray sincerely

[1:31:21] Pastor brother Shelly because uh it's
[1:31:25] why I came here 27 years ago it's why I

[1:31:38] would and to see God move like he did

[1:31:56] going one place and by the way the
[1:31:59] prayer about the biscuit that was for me
[1:32:02] because I told my wife the biscuit was
[1:32:07] dry but my
[1:32:10] biscuit was warmed up a second
[1:32:14] time with only cheese and it became dry
[1:32:18] it's not because my wife makes a dry
[1:32:20] biscuit biscuit that those see I got the
[1:32:25] I got the trial run two days before and
[1:32:28] they're good biscuits I know
[1:32:31] that that's right

[1:32:44] to well I I I went into the office and
[1:32:47] they asked me if I slept and I Saidi
[1:32:49] slept in my office chair all night' what
[1:32:51] sleep I got and they said it had to be
[1:32:54] because you said your wife's biscuit was
[1:33:00] dry it was not her choice that I spent
[1:33:03] the night in that office
[1:33:06] chair I would like to read scripture

[1:36:06] and your young men shall see visions and
[1:36:10] also upon the servants and upon the
[1:36:12] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[1:36:16] my spirit Acts 2
[1:36:20] verse4
[1:36:23] but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted
[1:36:25] up his voice and said unto them ye men
[1:36:28] of Juda and all that dwell at Jerusalem
[1:36:32] be this known unto you and hearken to my
[1:36:37] words for these are not drunken as you
[1:36:40] suppose for it is but the third hour of
[1:36:44] the day but this is that which was
[1:36:47] spoken of by the prophet Joel and it
[1:36:50] shall come to pass in the last days
[1:36:52] sayeth the Lord that I will pour out my
[1:36:55] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:36:57] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[1:37:00] young men shall see visions and your old
[1:37:02] men shall dream dreams and on my
[1:37:05] servants and on my handmaidens will I
[1:37:07] pour out in those days of my spirit and
[1:37:11] they shall prophesy verse 37 now when
[1:37:15] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:37:18] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[1:37:20] the rest of the Apostles OST Les men and
[1:37:23] Brethren what shall we
[1:37:26] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[1:37:29] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:37:32] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:37:35] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:37:39] the Holy Ghost verse 39 for This Promise

[1:37:48] to all that are a far off even as many
[1:37:52] as the Lord Our God shall call can you
[1:37:56] give the Lord a shout of
[1:37:59] [Applause]

[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:05] Hallelujah Lord we bless you for all
[1:38:08] that has been done in this camp meeting
[1:38:10] and up to this point in this service now
[1:38:13] would you just come and just let your
[1:38:16] heavy anointing rest upon us all of the
[1:38:19] tiredness of our body may we be able to
[1:38:22] press through it Lord and hear what you
[1:38:25] would have to say to us in this hour for
[1:38:28] it is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:30] Christ we pray
[1:38:33] amen amen amen amen you may be seated
[1:38:37] glory be to hallelujah hallelujah thank
[1:38:41] you thank you
[1:38:44] hallelujah praise
[1:38:46] God now we a lot of us that are sitting
[1:38:52] here have been under the sound of the
[1:38:54] word for many many
[1:38:56] years I if you don't already know it I
[1:38:59] am the son of a pastor who has preached
[1:39:02] this message now since
[1:39:04] 1970 and I am blessed man to be able to
[1:39:09] report to you of of of the 10 siblings
[1:39:12] the 10 of us children that my parents
[1:39:15] have every one of them are in message
[1:39:17] churches of every variety I thank God
[1:39:20] for that as brother was preaching last
[1:39:23] night after uh God started put putting
[1:39:27] us here and we got here and and God
[1:39:30] would use us in different ways uh we
[1:39:33] have been in pulpits where we were told
[1:39:36] we don't need that
[1:39:37] here literally told we don't need that
[1:39:42] here what a shame and and and I remember
[1:39:46] a prophetic word that I gave in a church
[1:39:48] to a young man that that uh that I was
[1:39:51] told that just pray for the people we
[1:39:53] don't need that here and and so we went
[1:39:56] on years and never heard anything and
[1:39:59] about uh three or four years ago the man
[1:40:02] the young man came to me after almost 20
[1:40:05] years and said the word that you gave to
[1:40:08] me I thought it was crazy and for 15
[1:40:12] years I said I don't know if it's true
[1:40:15] or not but after 15 years the word that
[1:40:18] the Lord spoke over him came to pass
[1:40:21] because the word of the Lord standeth
[1:40:24] sure it's not the boast of men it's not
[1:40:26] the boast of what we are it's just to
[1:40:29] say God keeps his word he doesn't let
[1:40:32] any of it go back to him null and void
[1:40:35] without being effective he lets it
[1:40:37] accomplish what he wants it to
[1:40:40] accomplish now when God gave this
[1:40:43] message to us in the 50s and 60s God
[1:40:47] brought a restoration message if it was
[1:40:51] a message of restoration to the people
[1:40:54] because there had been uh this bug that
[1:40:58] was trying to eat off what God had given
[1:41:01] to the people and we find that through
[1:41:05] the years there were many things that
[1:41:07] were taken away from the people they
[1:41:10] they were they were uh in as it started
[1:41:13] out with the Apostle Paul and he well
[1:41:17] with Peter really at the day of
[1:41:18] Pentecost the Peter began to prophesy to
[1:41:22] them or repeat the prophecy of what Joel
[1:41:25] had prophesied which we read just a
[1:41:28] moment ago that there was coming a time
[1:41:31] when there was going to be a restoration
[1:41:35] for the people the people had become
[1:41:39] lacks they had become
[1:41:41] lazy and the Bible said for Joel
[1:41:45] prophesied and he said you tell your
[1:41:47] children come on and let your children
[1:41:51] tell their children and let their
[1:41:53] children tell another generation the
[1:41:56] problem is somewhere along the way the
[1:41:59] telling got watered
[1:42:01] down the telling got less and less and
[1:42:05] less and less until the people were
[1:42:08] satisfied with dead dry
[1:42:12] religion and they just went and just had
[1:42:15] just the Liturgy they just had the
[1:42:18] speaking and and they they would go out
[1:42:20] and the under the law they had all of
[1:42:23] the the things that they were supposed
[1:42:25] to do and many of them could keep the
[1:42:29] law as much as was in their
[1:42:31] power they could do the
[1:42:35] works but that sacrifice that they were
[1:42:40] required to bring could never take away
[1:42:43] the guilt of what was on
[1:42:45] them but God was speaking to a future
[1:42:49] generation that he was going to pour out
[1:42:52] his Spirit on All
[1:42:55] Flesh and God kept his word on the day
[1:42:59] of Pentecost when Peter and all of those
[1:43:03] that were in the upper room God was
[1:43:05] there came down upon them and they began
[1:43:08] to receive these clothing tongues of
[1:43:11] fire yes sir that's right now as many
[1:43:15] that were here last night didn't know
[1:43:18] what to do with what was on them
[1:43:21] yes those people were in the same
[1:43:24] condition on the day of
[1:43:25] Pentecost because they were used to
[1:43:28] going to synagogue they were used to
[1:43:31] hearing the word of the Lord but they
[1:43:33] were not used to something happen that
[1:43:36] caused them to react the way they did on
[1:43:38] the P day of Pentecost and there are
[1:43:41] some that received last night that were
[1:43:43] not used to receiving what they received
[1:43:47] and I as a Believer receive received my
[1:43:51] Pentecost I received the baptism of the
[1:43:54] Holy Ghost at the same time in the same
[1:43:57] week as our brother did in
[1:44:00] 1988 and I know that I receive the Holy
[1:44:05] Ghost but I tell you there was a period
[1:44:08] of
[1:44:10] time where that if times got Tough
[1:44:14] Enough the devil tried to talk me out
[1:44:17] and you go through this wishy-washy
[1:44:19] stuff did I or didn't I did I or didn't
[1:44:25] I and see I'm I've been around this
[1:44:29] message for a long time and I've I've
[1:44:31] heard the quotes and that one about the
[1:44:34] peas on the dry cow hi High I've heard
[1:44:37] that until that I decided I didn't need
[1:44:40] to speak with
[1:44:42] tongues so many have come
[1:44:45] on but most recently I've done some
[1:44:48] research and I realize that that the
[1:44:50] prophet we nearly every time that he
[1:44:53] brought that that particular phrase into
[1:44:56] his preaching was not talking about the
[1:44:58] tongues on the people that were true
[1:45:02] believers most of the time he was
[1:45:04] talking about those that were not living
[1:45:07] a life that was worthy of the
[1:45:10] Gospel but still talking in tongues they
[1:45:13] would do all the things of the world
[1:45:15] come to church on Sunday and and he said
[1:45:17] it just sounded like ratatatat all the
[1:45:20] time and when they were speaking in
[1:45:22] tongues and but growing up I would hear
[1:45:25] that phrase and I don't fault anybody
[1:45:27] because you know it's in the hearer's uh
[1:45:30] problem there but you you get to hearing
[1:45:32] that and you form an
[1:45:35] opinion and our
[1:45:38] opinions affect our lives I don't care
[1:45:42] what your opinion is or what that
[1:45:44] opinion
[1:45:46] concerns you can we could just talk
[1:45:48] about something as simple as as a soft
[1:45:51] drink and if you have an opinion that
[1:45:53] coke is better than Pepsi as I was
[1:45:55] talking to brother joose the other night
[1:45:57] we don't allow Pepsi around here I don't
[1:46:00] drink Coke I don't drink Pepsi I don't
[1:46:04] care but we have
[1:46:08] opinions especially if we drink
[1:46:10] it I prefer sweet tea I have an opinion
[1:46:13] about sweet
[1:46:15] tea but we form opinions about things
[1:46:19] even when we come to the the house of
[1:46:21] God we form an opinion about the worship
[1:46:23] leader the piano player the drum player
[1:46:25] the the guitar player the preacher we
[1:46:28] form opinions and we form op opinions
[1:46:30] about people's children we form all
[1:46:32] these opinions about things and then
[1:46:34] when the word of God comes because we're
[1:46:36] so set on making our opinions known then
[1:46:40] we give an opinion about that
[1:46:42] too rather than letting the word sink
[1:46:45] down into us and going
[1:46:48] back to this
[1:46:51] to lay it in the pages of this to say
[1:46:54] Lord does what I'm
[1:46:58] hearing I can't even say what he's
[1:47:05] saying what I'm
[1:47:08] hearing does it come into the pages of
[1:47:11] this book that's it that's right and so
[1:47:15] I lay the blame right
[1:47:17] here but through the course of years
[1:47:21] and seeing God move on different people
[1:47:26] and then when I moved here in the middle
[1:47:29] 90s and I began to see how that the the
[1:47:33] the the people that had allowed that
[1:47:36] gifting of tongues to come upon
[1:47:39] them how that they were able to press
[1:47:43] through and pray in the spirit now again
[1:47:46] as brother Shel was saying last night
[1:47:48] you can pray in the spirit in English
[1:47:50] and you can pray in the spirit in
[1:47:52] another language the tongue of of Angels
[1:47:55] the tongue from heaven and you speak in
[1:47:58] another language and you get a hold of
[1:48:01] God in such a way until that you are
[1:48:03] speaking mysteries in the spirit and we
[1:48:05] don't know anything of what's Happening
[1:48:07] most of the time but God is God by
[1:48:11] yielding to the spirit we could be
[1:48:13] dispatching Angels here and there by the
[1:48:16] spirit of God not because we think we're
[1:48:19] anybody but because we got in the
[1:48:22] spirit so I began to watch this and see
[1:48:25] this and I was a part of the ministry
[1:48:27] team in 96 and 97 and and realizing that
[1:48:32] I could be more effective if I could
[1:48:35] just break out but I had to fight my way
[1:48:39] through yes yes this is but I
[1:48:45] remember I was too I remember that night
[1:48:50] and in March of 1998 10 years 10 years
[1:48:54] from the time I received the baptism of
[1:48:56] the Holy Ghost till the time that God
[1:48:59] allowed me to break through in that
[1:49:01] other language now my experience was I
[1:49:05] started hearing it in my head and I
[1:49:07] didn't know what to do with
[1:49:09] it so I went to somebody more
[1:49:12] experienced than I and I said what do I
[1:49:14] do with it and he said well my advice to
[1:49:17] you would be when you're in your private
[1:49:19] prayer time whatever you hear speak it
[1:49:21] out
[1:49:22] loudly so that's exactly what I did and
[1:49:26] it went on for just a couple of days
[1:49:28] because I think we went to a supper uh
[1:49:30] together on a Friday maybe just to
[1:49:33] discuss some Ministry things and that's
[1:49:34] when I got the advice and so by Sunday
[1:49:38] night I'm already letting the spirit of
[1:49:41] God come out of my mouth see I that's
[1:49:44] the advice I would give to some of you
[1:49:46] when you're under the anointing of God
[1:49:48] standing up around here it probably
[1:49:51] isn't going to happen if you don't open
[1:49:54] your
[1:49:56] mouth I know that's right if you clamp
[1:49:59] your lips together and clench your teeth
[1:50:01] together it probably isn't going to come
[1:50:04] out of your mouth but if you let
[1:50:07] something come out of your mouth and you
[1:50:09] let the spirit continue to work through
[1:50:11] you there'll come a gusher because of
[1:50:14] out of men's bellies it's flowing the
[1:50:17] rivers of Living
[1:50:19] Water
[1:50:21] so through the years as I have watched
[1:50:24] and I have traveled and I have gone
[1:50:26] different places and unfortunately I
[1:50:28] have seen many of our churches around
[1:50:32] what we call the message I have seen
[1:50:35] them in Decline and we have we have just
[1:50:39] continued to do what God called us to do
[1:50:41] here we don't try to put it on nobody
[1:50:44] else we just try to be faithful with
[1:50:46] what God has called us to and I have
[1:50:49] seen
[1:50:50] as people have not
[1:50:56] repeated as they have not told their
[1:51:00] children and their children of course
[1:51:03] now have a watered down idea and that's
[1:51:06] what they pass on to their
[1:51:08] children and their children because that
[1:51:11] they're seeing less and less of the move
[1:51:14] the Holy Ghost they water it down just a
[1:51:16] little bit more to tell their
[1:51:18] children
[1:51:22] and then the church ends up in a
[1:51:24] backsliding condition because the spirit
[1:51:27] of God isn't moving but God said I will
[1:51:33] restore sayth the
[1:51:37] Lord hallelujah now this is what I've
[1:51:40] come to a conclusion of a couple of
[1:51:43] weeks ago we need a restoration of the
[1:51:48] restoration brother Brandon preached the
[1:51:51] message in 1962 the restoration of the
[1:51:53] brid tree where he talked about this bug
[1:51:57] that morphed from one place to another
[1:51:59] place to the another it was the same bug
[1:52:02] all along and I'm just going to give you
[1:52:04] a short version of what he preached
[1:52:06] there in
[1:52:07] 1962 because he said the Palmer worm the
[1:52:11] first stage of that bug and the first
[1:52:13] thing it ate off was the word
[1:52:16] word and he said it was the fruit the
[1:52:19] word word and then he said the fruit the
[1:52:22] nine fruits of the spirit with the nine
[1:52:24] spiritual gifts and so that Palmer worm
[1:52:27] tried to eat off brother brotherly love
[1:52:29] it tried to eat off faith it tried to
[1:52:32] eat off Joy the people you just make too
[1:52:34] much noise and that's what the Palmer
[1:52:37] worm did it came as that bug to try to
[1:52:40] take away the fruit of the spirit that
[1:52:44] was in the people the next thing that it
[1:52:46] did the it morphed into the Locust and
[1:52:49] then it the the started chewing on the
[1:52:52] leaves and he called that Divine
[1:52:55] fellowship or the coolness and then see
[1:53:00] through the years preachers especially
[1:53:03] get this idea you either do it my way or
[1:53:05] you get
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:10] out I'm the ultimate Authority in this
[1:53:13] house by as a pastor of a certain place
[1:53:17] and so you do it my way or you get out
[1:53:21] and everybody again has opinion the
[1:53:24] pastor has that legal Authority I
[1:53:26] suppose he has that Authority as the
[1:53:29] pastor but then that Spirit starts
[1:53:32] getting on other
[1:53:33] people and it starts spreading out and
[1:53:37] that's what the bug did it started out
[1:53:39] with one leaf and then another leaf and
[1:53:41] then it gets bigger and bigger and it
[1:53:43] goes out to all the branches until
[1:53:45] there's no leaves left there's no
[1:53:48] coolness of the Holy Spirit the Divine
[1:53:51] love to be able to love on one another
[1:53:53] and prevent a pre present a coolness
[1:53:56] when the people come
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:04] in one of his statements was sit down
[1:54:06] under this tree and let the winds from
[1:54:08] Heaven go to blow in a little
[1:54:10] bit the next stage of that bug was a
[1:54:13] caner worm and he called that the
[1:54:16] religion the covering the doctrine the
[1:54:18] lifeline and I just want to tell you
[1:54:21] today Doctrine
[1:54:23] matters the word of God matters what you
[1:54:26] believe
[1:54:28] matters it matters what you
[1:54:32] believe that is why you hear us
[1:54:34] repeating over and over and over again
[1:54:37] that God is not three God is one that is
[1:54:41] why you hear us repeating you must be
[1:54:43] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:54:46] the remission of your sins you need to
[1:54:50] repent first and then be baptized these
[1:54:52] are fun fundamental truths that are
[1:54:55] supposed to be a part of our life
[1:54:57] because they're
[1:54:59] scripture well what about Matthew
[1:55:02] 28:19 when you get a revelation of who
[1:55:04] God is you will realize that Matthew
[1:55:07] 28:19 and acts 238 are one and the same
[1:55:12] because all that God was he just decided
[1:55:15] that he couldn't appear to men in a
[1:55:17] spirit form so he took on a body the
[1:55:20] body of Flesh and he came to the Earth
[1:55:21] as Jesus Christ and when he was finished
[1:55:24] all the work on the earth then he went
[1:55:26] back to the right hand of power and he
[1:55:28] sent back his very own life back to the
[1:55:31] believer on the day of Pentecost he sent
[1:55:34] his own life not another one his life
[1:55:38] and so you are an extension of him by
[1:55:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are an
[1:55:43] extension of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:55:45] the earth he that physical body went
[1:55:48] back to Papa but the Holy Spirit came
[1:55:51] down for you he came down to indwell you
[1:55:55] so that you could be all that people
[1:55:57] would see of Jesus Christ on the
[1:56:01] earth don't discount your Holy Ghost
[1:56:04] don't you discount what God has done for
[1:56:06] you don't you back up one iota for the
[1:56:09] devil but you allow the Lord Jesus to be
[1:56:12] alive and alert and active in your life
[1:56:15] accomplishing what he has come to do
[1:56:18] because he desires to make you so full
[1:56:20] of the Holy Ghost so that you don't know
[1:56:22] what to do with
[1:56:24] [Applause]
[1:56:27] yourself so he talks about the religion
[1:56:29] the covering and he said it gets them
[1:56:32] all dignified then strips he gets them
[1:56:34] all dignified and then he strips them of
[1:56:36] their religious covering on now and they
[1:56:39] make up their own
[1:56:42] ideas and they got stripped of their
[1:56:44] Pentecostal
[1:56:48] experience
[1:56:51] God never left anything for relics or
[1:56:54] tokens he sent the Holy Ghost something
[1:56:58] alive and it can never be destroyed so
[1:57:01] then the fourth stage of this bug was
[1:57:03] the caterpillar and he called that part
[1:57:07] of it the denomination and he said that
[1:57:09] it sucks out the very life the spirit
[1:57:12] out of the people sucks the very life
[1:57:15] out of the people and God planted this
[1:57:19] tree
[1:57:20] this spiritual tree he planted it for it
[1:57:23] to Bear spiritual fruit he planted it
[1:57:27] for it to Bear Supernatural fruit now I
[1:57:30] would like to say that when brother
[1:57:32] brandham preached this in
[1:57:34] 1962 he was dealing with one set of
[1:57:37] problems right so true he was dealing
[1:57:41] with a spirit of
[1:57:43] denominationalism that had crept into
[1:57:46] the church I mean isusa Street was just
[1:57:49] 50 to 60 years behind them at the time
[1:57:53] and where that God had poured out
[1:57:55] himself on Aza Street and all across the
[1:57:58] United States and even in other
[1:58:01] countries God had poured himself out in
[1:58:03] a marvelous way and people experience
[1:58:06] the Holy
[1:58:11] Ghost but
[1:58:14] because that the tishbite anointing had
[1:58:17] not yet been released in the Earth
[1:58:20] Earth people began to grasp what is
[1:58:25] right and what is wrong tell
[1:58:29] us the Holy Ghost had fallen the people
[1:58:33] were speaking in tongues and they could
[1:58:35] see that it happened in the book of Acts
[1:58:37] and that it was still promised to the
[1:58:39] people in the last day yet while they
[1:58:42] were enjoying the presence of God and it
[1:58:45] got larger and larger man started
[1:58:48] putting his own own ideas on it and
[1:58:51] started putting parameters around it and
[1:58:55] started denominational liing it in such
[1:58:58] a way and then it started dividing
[1:59:00] Brethren come on and as it started
[1:59:03] dividing Brethren and you had the
[1:59:06] Trinity denominations and you had the
[1:59:08] Oneness denominations and you had all in
[1:59:10] between and maybe more I don't know
[1:59:13] denominations and the denominational
[1:59:16] Spirit was around all of that God had
[1:59:19] did done in
[1:59:21] 1906 and people began to
[1:59:24] forget what God had done in
[1:59:28] 1906 because they were more concerned
[1:59:32] about building their own Ministry or
[1:59:34] their own
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:38] denomination brother brandham was
[1:59:40] dealing with that situation in the 50s
[1:59:42] and 60s and he realized that the enemy
[1:59:47] had come in and he had tried to he and
[1:59:51] and had succeeded in eating away at the
[1:59:55] fruit and the leaves and the bark until
[1:59:58] it got into the very life and when that
[2:00:02] when that bug got into the life the tree
[2:00:11] died brother random came with that
[2:00:13] message from the scripture but I will
[2:00:16] restore sayith the Lord
[2:00:20] and oh how the people rejoiced in the
[2:00:23] 50s and the 60s when they heard that
[2:00:26] message of restoration now here is what
[2:00:29] I would say because that we have had a
[2:00:33] restoration message people have been
[2:00:36] satisfied to come to church hear a sweet
[2:00:38] sermon and go back out and they have
[2:00:41] forgotten because somebody forgot to
[2:00:44] pass the message
[2:00:48] down
[2:00:50] and when they forgot to tell their
[2:00:52] children some of those children that
[2:00:55] forgot to get told right became
[2:01:02] preachers and then some of those
[2:01:04] children that never got told by their
[2:01:07] parents that became
[2:01:09] preachers started talking a twisted
[2:01:14] Doctrine a twisted version of what
[2:01:17] really should be happening
[2:01:22] we're talking from Pentecost to the 50s
[2:01:25] and the
[2:01:29] 60s and as the
[2:01:32] preachers had not been told by their
[2:01:36] parents they now become parents and they
[2:01:39] become preachers and they have children
[2:01:42] and they start telling a a distorted
[2:01:46] version of what really should be going
[2:01:48] on on in the house of the Living God
[2:01:51] then we come with a watered down gospel
[2:01:54] and the enemy has been satisfied to get
[2:01:57] into that Pentecostal experience and
[2:02:00] start chewing at the at the bark and the
[2:02:03] leaves and the fruit and then into the
[2:02:06] very
[2:02:07] life
[2:02:11] again and we heard a
[2:02:13] message that message said I will restore
[2:02:16] sayith the Lord hallelujah
[2:02:20] now it was to the generation in the 50s
[2:02:22] and
[2:02:24] 60s but somewhere in that group of
[2:02:28] people in the 50s and
[2:02:31] 60s after brother brandham left the
[2:02:34] scene we had a
[2:02:37] repeat we had a repeat of of a
[2:02:42] papa who came out of a Baptist Church L
[2:02:46] and recognized that there was a message
[2:02:48] for the hour that never had a new birth
[2:02:51] that's it that's it that's right and a
[2:02:55] Methodist that come out of a Methodist
[2:02:58] Church and recognize the word for their
[2:03:01] day but it was all it was to them was
[2:03:04] word without spirit and when they became
[2:03:08] a preacher or became a pastor and they
[2:03:10] started wanting to preach the truth of
[2:03:12] the end time they had truth but for
[2:03:15] whatever reason they wanted to deliver
[2:03:17] it with their
[2:03:20] Methodist way of delivering
[2:03:23] it and
[2:03:25] their message
[2:03:27] church was a Methodist Church or a
[2:03:32] Baptist Church or even an Episcopalian
[2:03:37] Church and they all had their ideas and
[2:03:40] they passed their ideas down to their
[2:03:43] children rather than giving them Joel's
[2:03:46] prophecy and saying God is going to pour
[2:03:49] out his Spirit on All Flesh your young
[2:03:51] men are going to see Visions your old
[2:03:53] men are going to dream dreams and I'm
[2:03:55] going to pour out my spirit on All
[2:03:58] Flesh it's the word it's the word it's
[2:04:00] the word it's the word it's the word
[2:04:01] it's the
[2:04:04] word now I'm just going to tell you let
[2:04:08] you misunderstand me I know you have to
[2:04:12] have the
[2:04:17] word when all all of your emotion is
[2:04:21] gone and you go out and face the
[2:04:24] world and that emotion that you felt
[2:04:27] here last night is it's a distant fond
[2:04:31] memory and you're facing the
[2:04:34] devil you're not going to be able to
[2:04:37] tell the devil I had a chill go up my
[2:04:41] spine on Saturday night get out of my
[2:04:45] way none of that's going to work that's
[2:04:49] why you have to be established in the
[2:04:51] word of
[2:04:53] God now brother got up here just before
[2:04:56] I did and he brought back to our
[2:04:58] attention the woman at the
[2:05:01] well and when Jesus spoke to her he said
[2:05:05] I am looking for true
[2:05:06] worshippers and those
[2:05:09] worshippers must worship me only in
[2:05:15] word Spirit
[2:05:17] first
[2:05:19] those worshippers must worship me only
[2:05:21] with
[2:05:23] Spirit
[2:05:25] no if you can
[2:05:28] Envision on the top of this Pulpit today
[2:05:31] one of those old timey
[2:05:34] balances and you get the word and the
[2:05:37] spirit on that balance you're going to
[2:05:39] find out that you come into Perfect
[2:05:41] Balance when you get the word and the
[2:05:44] spirit when you get spirit and Truth we
[2:05:47] find that the scripture says Thy word is
[2:05:50] truth we get the word and the spirit
[2:05:53] together and we get them in balance and
[2:05:56] something's going to
[2:06:02] happen so preacher didn't tell his
[2:06:07] children and he wonders why his children
[2:06:10] have gone to the world
[2:06:13] righta my heart cries because we are in
[2:06:16] an hour where we see people leaving this
[2:06:19] Truth for one reason or another over the
[2:06:22] silliest reasons as far as I'm concerned
[2:06:25] but when they get gone they start
[2:06:27] bashing everything and I wonder what are
[2:06:29] you standing
[2:06:30] on what are you even standing on but I
[2:06:34] think and there's at least two of them
[2:06:37] that when their parent died as soon as
[2:06:40] their parent died they left this
[2:06:46] truth okay Papa Mama
[2:06:49] I believe you had a real true experience
[2:06:52] with the Lord how come why is it that
[2:06:55] but the Next Generation decided that
[2:06:57] this was not truth I don't know the only
[2:07:00] thing that I can come up with is because
[2:07:02] the previous generation didn't tell the
[2:07:05] Next
[2:07:06] Generation or what they told them was
[2:07:08] watered
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] down so then you get a noisy Church like
[2:07:19] this where that we speak in tongues
[2:07:23] listen I can take you to a I can take
[2:07:26] you to the beginning of a sermon where
[2:07:28] brother brandham sent his tape boys as
[2:07:31] he called them
[2:07:33] specifically because he wanted them to
[2:07:37] record what he called the chance of the
[2:07:41] spirit chance of the and it was it was
[2:07:45] Raising in here last night and it was
[2:07:48] earlier in the week there was one time
[2:07:50] in worship earlier this week I could
[2:07:52] hear that sound raising there was
[2:07:55] something in the spirit that was
[2:07:56] happening because nobody was trying to
[2:07:59] make their voice heard above somebody
[2:08:01] else and you could not distinguish
[2:08:03] between crying or shouting or speaking
[2:08:06] in tongues or speaking in English but
[2:08:08] there was a crescendo of the holy spirit
[2:08:11] that lifted up in
[2:08:13] here the rhythms of the spirit and there
[2:08:18] is a section of tape that you can go in
[2:08:20] here at this second I don't remember
[2:08:22] where it's at but I can find it for you
[2:08:24] where that brother brandham wanted it on
[2:08:27] recording because he said it settled
[2:08:36] him whatever your
[2:08:39] sound you don't have to speak in tongues
[2:08:42] as much as I do or as much as he does or
[2:08:44] anybody else does but let your sound
[2:08:47] come out it may just be a hum but if we
[2:08:51] could ever get in the right atmosphere
[2:08:54] together together if one by himself can
[2:08:59] put a thousand to
[2:09:02] flight and then you get a second one
[2:09:04] adding their voice and a third one and a
[2:09:07] fourth one and a fifth one and then the
[2:09:09] whole congreg congregation getting their
[2:09:11] voices all Blended together and nobody
[2:09:15] trying to outdo one another but trying
[2:09:17] to find the
[2:09:20] pitch the
[2:09:22] sound the one the the
[2:09:26] the listen the sound for today may be
[2:09:29] different than the sound for next
[2:09:32] week and so when we come together we
[2:09:34] want to be able to be sensitive to the
[2:09:37] spirit and if our sound ain't the right
[2:09:39] sound we want to be flexible and fluid
[2:09:42] enough until that we're willing to
[2:09:44] change our voice change our sound change
[2:09:48] our cartoon whatever it is go up a key
[2:09:50] go down a key whatever that might be to
[2:09:53] find the sound of the spirit for the
[2:09:56] moment because God wants to move every
[2:10:00] time we come together and he wants to
[2:10:03] move when you're by
[2:10:07] yourself so this bug has eaten off it is
[2:10:12] eaten off it is eaten off the fruit it
[2:10:15] is eaten it started out by saying well
[2:10:19] we have the word so the gifts aren't
[2:10:25] necessary and see this started happen
[2:10:27] after the man of God left the scene in
[2:10:30] 1965 because you can go back to hear
[2:10:33] what he said and he said every one of
[2:10:34] these nine spiritual gifts should be a
[2:10:36] part of the local assembly
[2:10:38] active should be
[2:10:43] active well brother brandham put them in
[2:10:46] a back room he said we'll meet 30
[2:10:48] minutes before the
[2:10:52] service I recently asked a church if
[2:10:55] they had a gift
[2:11:06] room see here's our problem about the
[2:11:09] gifts we don't mind somebody having the
[2:11:12] gift of
[2:11:17] faith
[2:11:18] you got a gift of faith please lay your
[2:11:21] hands on
[2:11:24] me and if I'm sick in the song service
[2:11:26] and you have a gift of faith I would
[2:11:28] rather you didn't wait till the end of
[2:11:29] the
[2:11:31] preaching that's
[2:11:35] right but you see the gift of tongues
[2:11:37] and interpretation I'm I
[2:11:41] I as he said last night the biggest
[2:11:43] problem is
[2:11:47] control
[2:11:48] they have been squelched
[2:11:51] because didn't know how to control it or
[2:11:56] didn't have the ability
[2:11:58] to now I'm going to give a disclaimer as
[2:12:00] a
[2:12:02] preacher standing
[2:12:04] here over the years I have had my times
[2:12:09] of shaking in my
[2:12:10] shoes to know what to
[2:12:15] do should I stop it
[2:12:19] should I let it
[2:12:22] go and there are sometimes it has to be
[2:12:27] stopped I believe I believe that was
[2:12:30] told to us the other
[2:12:32] night there is a time for all
[2:12:36] things and absolutely the word has to
[2:12:40] have preeminence in our midst because
[2:12:43] when you go outside those doors you're
[2:12:45] not going to be able to speak in tongues
[2:12:47] and the to the devil and make him
[2:12:49] go now you may be able to pray in the
[2:12:52] spirit yeah that's the best way to for
[2:12:55] it to happen pray in the spirit and let
[2:12:57] the Angels come and take care of
[2:13:00] it but get in the spirit that's the main
[2:13:03] thing get in the
[2:13:05] spirit find what is necessary for the
[2:13:09] moment so the enemy took away these nine
[2:13:13] spiritual gifts and as he took away
[2:13:15] these nine spiritual gifts the fruit of
[2:13:18] the spirit also began to
[2:13:21] dissipate and then the
[2:13:23] leaves hello the leaves the coolness see
[2:13:27] there's there's there's when the Holy
[2:13:30] Spirit is Among Us and he's working on
[2:13:33] each one of us and we're yielding to him
[2:13:36] all that hotheadedness has to
[2:13:39] leave all that temper and rage all that
[2:13:42] stuff that gets us so out of sorts all
[2:13:45] that throwing around of opinion because
[2:13:47] we want it done oh when the the he that
[2:13:50] bug came and chewed off the the leaves
[2:13:53] the coolness and all the coolness begin
[2:13:56] to left and you could see people's
[2:13:58] tempers flaring ah this is the way it is
[2:14:01] everybody put in their own
[2:14:03] interpretation on what they thought
[2:14:05] ought to be the order of a service what
[2:14:07] they thought ought to be the order in
[2:14:08] the house of God and then then we we
[2:14:11] find that there were uh men installed as
[2:14:14] deacons that wanted to thump people over
[2:14:16] the head if they weren't perfect quiet
[2:14:18] in the service and they if they got out
[2:14:20] of hand and started to speak in tongues
[2:14:22] or they started to get a little happy
[2:14:24] calm down
[2:14:30] now the
[2:14:32] coolness of the Holy
[2:14:37] Spirit then the
[2:14:40] Lifeline where you start seeing the
[2:14:43] doctrine slipping now I would just like
[2:14:45] to dwell here just a moment
[2:14:48] because I have Through The
[2:14:52] Years you start getting
[2:14:55] attitude I
[2:14:57] have because people leave out
[2:15:01] Parts when they when they preach it's
[2:15:04] the word it's the word it's the word
[2:15:05] it's the word let's get all the
[2:15:09] word when God brought
[2:15:12] restoration all the way through the
[2:15:15] message brother brandham talked about
[2:15:17] Luther
[2:15:20] and he said that Luther brought a
[2:15:22] message of justification right then he
[2:15:25] said Wesley came after Luther with a
[2:15:29] message of
[2:15:32] sanctification he did not immediately go
[2:15:35] to the word no he did
[2:15:38] not he said after Wesley was the
[2:15:42] restoration of the
[2:15:46] gifts Pentacost
[2:15:49] the restoration of the gifts Pentecost
[2:15:52] over and over and over and then the true
[2:15:57] word now the problem that I have
[2:15:59] encountered Through The Years watching
[2:16:01] all of this is that people were willing
[2:16:03] to talk about
[2:16:06] Luther justification they were willing
[2:16:09] to talk about Wesley and sanctification
[2:16:12] tell the truth and they even would brief
[2:16:15] over restoration of the gifts
[2:16:19] and then the full word as if the full
[2:16:22] word negated all the rest of it I hope
[2:16:25] not and I just want to ask the
[2:16:30] question when you came to the truth of
[2:16:33] the word of God did you leave behind
[2:16:38] justification
[2:16:39] no when you came to the truth of the
[2:16:42] word did you leave behind
[2:16:45] sanctification some of them did
[2:16:51] and the reason you're seeing that some
[2:16:52] of them have left sanctification is
[2:16:54] because there's been some parents that
[2:16:56] didn't tell their children and there's
[2:16:58] some children that didn't tell their
[2:16:59] children and their children didn't tell
[2:17:02] their children and it has become a
[2:17:04] watered down gospel and we're seeing
[2:17:06] Babylon creep back into the
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:14] church now why would I say all of this
[2:17:16] when it seems like I'm preaching to the
[2:17:18] choir right here because friends I want
[2:17:20] to be sure that I tell my children and I
[2:17:24] want this message to be so clear when I
[2:17:27] tell my children that they tell their
[2:17:30] children and that they can give the
[2:17:32] message so clear to their children that
[2:17:35] their children if we should be here
[2:17:37] would also be
[2:17:39] told because I don't want my children to
[2:17:41] start watering down the gospel and I
[2:17:44] don't want my grandchild I don't want
[2:17:47] her to hear a watered down gospel and
[2:17:49] then she starts giving out a watered
[2:17:51] down version of what is
[2:17:55] truth that is why I'm not ashamed to say
[2:17:58] this is my pastor that preaches
[2:18:01] justification and sanctification and the
[2:18:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:18:06] restoration of the word because it is
[2:18:09] all a part of the package that has been
[2:18:11] given to us in the end
[2:18:16] time
[2:18:19] [Applause]
[2:18:25] it's all part of
[2:18:27] it and you've got to have your
[2:18:30] experience with the Lord just the same
[2:18:33] as I had to have
[2:18:37] mine and the enemy likes to talk you out
[2:18:40] of yours like he likes to try to talk me
[2:18:43] out of mind but there was an experience
[2:18:46] years ago that he can't talk me out of
[2:18:48] mine no
[2:18:51] more I remember a man of God when it
[2:18:55] happened on that Sunday night that said
[2:18:57] let it come out and get all you can so
[2:19:00] the devil can't talk you out of it
[2:19:02] tomorrow and I'm real thankful that he
[2:19:05] did because here I stand today the devil
[2:19:08] hasn't talked me out of it and he's not
[2:19:10] going to talk me out of it and by God's
[2:19:13] grace I'm going to help some of you to
[2:19:15] pray
[2:19:16] through
[2:19:18] [Applause]
[2:19:26] sometimes you'll hear me come and lay my
[2:19:28] hands on you and say such as I have I
[2:19:30] give you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:19:32] Christ if Peter could do it I can do
[2:19:36] it that man needed healing at that
[2:19:39] moment and Peter had it inside of him
[2:19:42] and he goes along and he's shaking his
[2:19:44] cup the boy man is shaking his cup at
[2:19:47] the gate beautiful and he says arms arms
[2:19:49] arms and Peter comes along and Peter
[2:19:54] says buddy I just don't have none of
[2:19:56] that but I tell you what I do
[2:19:59] have such as I have I give you in the
[2:20:03] name of Jesus Christ arise up and walk
[2:20:07] and
[2:20:08] immediately immediately his ankle bones
[2:20:11] receive strength and he jumped up and he
[2:20:15] went
[2:20:16] leaping
[2:20:18] leaping and shouting and praising
[2:20:25] [Applause]
[2:20:31] God and that is why I took Peter's
[2:20:35] example and I know what the Lord has
[2:20:38] done for me and some that struggle along
[2:20:41] the way and they can't seem to get where
[2:20:43] they want to and I see them going up and
[2:20:46] I see them coming back down and up and
[2:20:48] down and I want to say whatever I have
[2:20:52] whatever I can impart into you whatever
[2:20:56] I possess in the name of Jesus Christ I
[2:20:59] give it because I don't want to see you
[2:21:02] going from Pillar To Post when going in
[2:21:05] the up and coming back down I want to
[2:21:07] see you stabilized in the Gospel of
[2:21:10] Jesus
[2:21:16] Christ hey I thought y'all were
[2:21:20] tired now
[2:21:22] I Glory
[2:21:24] [Music]
[2:21:27] Glory this restoration message that has
[2:21:30] come along for us is because when when
[2:21:34] Joel
[2:21:35] prophesied I will restore sayeth the
[2:21:39] Lord now the bug thought when he ate off
[2:21:44] the leaves and the fruit and the the
[2:21:47] bark and got all the way into the core
[2:21:50] of that tree he thought that tree was
[2:21:54] dead
[2:21:55] dead
[2:21:57] dead we've all been around long enough
[2:22:01] to see some
[2:22:08] dead just as a side note I'm so happy
[2:22:12] that sister Gert Hammond and sister
[2:22:15] Terry Lawler are here
[2:22:25] and my mind began to wonder last night
[2:22:28] oh yes we brother Shelly had mentioned
[2:22:31] water baptism and how important water
[2:22:33] baptism was
[2:22:35] and some of you may not know that my dad
[2:22:40] pastored sister gird and sister Terry in
[2:22:42] the early 70s back in Pennsylvania Ohio
[2:22:46] they live lived in Ohio we lived in
[2:22:48] Pennsylvania and daddy would go one
[2:22:50] Thursday night a month to a little house
[2:22:52] church and they were a part of that my
[2:22:54] daddy pastored it sister Terry do you
[2:22:57] remember Sister
[2:22:58] Ludwig sister Ludwig was a woman that
[2:23:01] believed
[2:23:03] truth but she could not get out to go to
[2:23:05] services and she didn't have the joy of
[2:23:08] live streaming and I don't remember what
[2:23:11] her ailment was but I remember even
[2:23:13] though I was a small child she was in a
[2:23:15] bed that rocked back and forth for oh
[2:23:18] my it rocked back and forth and they
[2:23:21] would stop that bed and dad would come
[2:23:23] and he would preach to her a little
[2:23:25] while and he would give her the
[2:23:27] communion and so forth and she says
[2:23:29] brother gedle I want to be
[2:23:34] baptized in a bed that rock polio it
[2:23:39] rocked back and forth and she says I
[2:23:42] want to be baptized and Dad wrestled
[2:23:45] with that over and over not knowing what
[2:23:47] to do because her husband was not a
[2:23:49] Believer and and he knew that if he took
[2:23:52] her out in the water and she ended up
[2:23:54] deathly sick that he would be held
[2:23:56] responsible even though sister lwig was
[2:23:58] the one that wanted to be baptized but I
[2:24:01] remember he tells the story over and
[2:24:03] over
[2:24:04] again he said somehow God worked on that
[2:24:09] unbelieving
[2:24:10] husband he took the seats out of a back
[2:24:13] of a station wagon and he slid her into
[2:24:16] that St wagon and they took her bed out
[2:24:19] to a some body of water and I think
[2:24:22] there were four men that took her out in
[2:24:24] that body of water and lowered her down
[2:24:26] in that water and baptized her in the
[2:24:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ when there
[2:24:32] is a Hungry
[2:24:34] [Applause]
[2:24:37] Heart when there's a Hungry
[2:24:41] Heart God Will Make A
[2:24:44] Way I believe that there are people
[2:24:46] people who call on the name of the Lord
[2:24:48] with sincerity at the last moment of
[2:24:51] their life and they're never baptized in
[2:24:53] the name of Jesus Christ and they make
[2:24:55] it but that sister saw through the word
[2:24:58] of God and she said even though I'm in
[2:25:00] this condition I want to be baptized in
[2:25:04] the name of Jesus Christ and God made a
[2:25:07] way for her to be baptized she saw the
[2:25:10] importance of
[2:25:12] it God rewarded her faith and I just was
[2:25:16] thinking about that last night thinking
[2:25:18] about how God has uh once again put
[2:25:22] sister Gert and sister Terry under the
[2:25:25] watchmans with brother Shelly of a
[2:25:27] brother
[2:25:29] grey I don't know why God does that full
[2:25:33] circle but somewhere along the way they
[2:25:36] got in a position where that somebody
[2:25:39] talked them a different story somebody
[2:25:42] tried to give to them a different story
[2:25:44] but down on the inside of sister Terry
[2:25:47] so on the inside of sister G there was
[2:25:50] something on the inside even though the
[2:25:53] bug had been able to tear down the
[2:25:56] leaves and it got to the bark and maybe
[2:25:59] it even gotten into the
[2:26:02] [Applause]
[2:26:04] life there was a root there was a root
[2:26:07] on the
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:11] inside there was a root on the
[2:26:15] inside
[2:26:19] H I'm convinced today that somewhere
[2:26:23] along the way that sister Terry pulled
[2:26:26] sister Rebecca up on her knee just like
[2:26:29] brother brandham describes the woman at
[2:26:31] the well somewhere along the way the
[2:26:34] woman at the well he said that her mama
[2:26:36] pulled her up on her knee and began to
[2:26:38] plant the seeds of Destiny in her
[2:26:45] life and even though sister Terry fell
[2:26:48] beat and battered there was a root on
[2:26:50] the
[2:26:51] inside and it wasn't the root of
[2:26:53] bitterness that she was instilling into
[2:26:55] Rebecca it wasn't the root of bitterness
[2:26:58] that she was instilling into Hannah and
[2:27:00] into Lily and Joanna and said Sarah and
[2:27:04] Gary there was something that she was
[2:27:06] instilling in
[2:27:08] them and somewhere along the
[2:27:12] way somewhere along the way sister Terry
[2:27:15] started hearing I will restore sayith
[2:27:18] the Lord I will restore sayith the Lord
[2:27:23] I will restore sayith the Lord and for a
[2:27:26] while the water had to come by way of
[2:27:29] stream and God began to get the word to
[2:27:32] her and to her children and I you may
[2:27:35] have opinions about how it got there you
[2:27:37] may have opinions about how she what
[2:27:40] what she went through that's all your
[2:27:45] opinion might I remind you what Joel
[2:27:49] said my great
[2:27:53] Army which I sent among
[2:27:58] you God's Great
[2:28:02] Army all of your
[2:28:05] trials all of your Beating
[2:28:09] Downs all that you feel like that the
[2:28:11] enemy has had access in your
[2:28:15] life all of the preachers that have
[2:28:17] failed you through the years all of the
[2:28:20] deacons that have failed you all of the
[2:28:23] parents that have failed you all I can
[2:28:26] say is you have reason to Rejoice today
[2:28:30] because there was seeds of destiny that
[2:28:32] were planted in you somewhere along the
[2:28:34] way and even though that bug came
[2:28:38] along even though the bug came along and
[2:28:42] started eating and
[2:28:44] chewing chewing chewing Che chewing
[2:28:47] morphing into its next creature the same
[2:28:51] bug in another stage kept eating and
[2:28:53] eating and eating and you felt like life
[2:28:56] wasn't fair you felt like why did I have
[2:28:58] to go through this my great Army which I
[2:29:03] why
[2:29:04] Lord why
[2:29:07] Lord why
[2:29:09] Lord why did I have to go through all
[2:29:13] that I don't know all the reasons
[2:29:18] all I know is that these fiery
[2:29:21] trials are working a far greater and
[2:29:25] better and eternal purpose in you than
[2:29:29] you can ever dream or imagine but you
[2:29:32] have reason to Rejoice today because the
[2:29:35] Lord said I will
[2:29:38] [Music]
[2:29:40] restore Joel prophesied
[2:29:42] it Peter repeated the pro the the
[2:29:45] prophecy in Acts chap 2 and God fell on
[2:29:50] them at the day of Pentecost and it
[2:29:52] continued for some time but somewhere
[2:29:54] along the way the message
[2:29:57] again the bug got in there started
[2:30:00] chewing it off and then in the 50s and
[2:30:03] 60s God comes back along with a prophet
[2:30:06] and he once again gives this message of
[2:30:08] restoration now friends I want you to
[2:30:11] understand the message does not need to
[2:30:13] be restored the message the truth of the
[2:30:16] message does not need to be restored to
[2:30:20] to us today we have been given it but we
[2:30:23] need a restoration of the
[2:30:27] restoration we need to be reminded of
[2:30:31] the dilution that has come along the way
[2:30:34] and how that man has put their opinions
[2:30:37] in and the men have been used as the
[2:30:40] bugs but don't blame the
[2:30:43] men don't blame anybody it's like Christ
[2:30:47] on Calvary the Romans didn't crucify
[2:30:53] him that was God's idea from the
[2:30:56] beginning the lamb had to be offered and
[2:30:59] the blood of bulls and goats could never
[2:31:01] be
[2:31:02] enough and then when Jesus comes along
[2:31:05] and he starts preaching to them you've
[2:31:07] got to eat my flesh and drink my blood
[2:31:09] and all those who were standing around
[2:31:11] they said you you're you know you're
[2:31:14] teaching a doctor and you sound like a
[2:31:15] vampire eat your flesh drink your blood
[2:31:18] we're of Moses and we you know we are
[2:31:20] the those our fathers ate Mana in the
[2:31:23] wilderness now the Mana was
[2:31:28] Supernatural and they ate it under
[2:31:31] Moses's message they were given the Mana
[2:31:35] supernaturally every day except for just
[2:31:38] before the Sabbath they had to get
[2:31:39] enough for the Friday and Saturday they
[2:31:42] had to have enough for both days because
[2:31:44] it wasn't going to come on the Sabbath
[2:31:46] and if they tried to save any over from
[2:31:49] one day to the next it rotted it was
[2:31:51] smelly it was it was no good to eat and
[2:31:54] God gave them supernaturally that
[2:31:59] mana and when God instructed Moses to
[2:32:02] build the Tabernacle he gave him three
[2:32:04] things to put in the into the behind the
[2:32:07] holy of holies and Mana was one of those
[2:32:09] that he told to put in that Ark and we
[2:32:13] talked on Tuesday night about the rod
[2:32:15] that budded that was to go there as well
[2:32:17] and then the tables of stone every bit
[2:32:20] of that
[2:32:22] Supernatural and God gave a supernatural
[2:32:25] message to us but it got watered down
[2:32:28] one way and then another but it was
[2:32:30] God's Great Army that he sent along and
[2:32:32] it was for a reason reasons that I don't
[2:32:34] know what they were and it seems like it
[2:32:37] it seems so unfair as you look back over
[2:32:41] the years and you see people that lived
[2:32:43] lives of sin because that the generation
[2:32:45] didn't tell but we've got to leave all
[2:32:48] of that behind
[2:32:50] now every day is a good
[2:32:53] day because God made every day that God
[2:32:56] makes is a good day as our brother told
[2:32:59] us the other night every day that God
[2:33:01] makes is a good day and we can't cry
[2:33:04] about yesterday but we can embrace the
[2:33:07] restoration
[2:33:10] today I'm simply preaching to you the
[2:33:13] same restoration that he preached in 196
[2:33:16] 2 the same restoration but you're a
[2:33:19] whole different set of people than set
[2:33:21] under that message in
[2:33:24] 1962 right so
[2:33:26] true so
[2:33:29] true whole different
[2:33:36] group Sister Williams is about to be 87
[2:33:39] years old
[2:33:41] yes she was one that passed it
[2:33:45] down
[2:33:48] did that's right and when she saw that
[2:33:51] bug getting into her family and she saw
[2:33:55] some restoration she said I got to get
[2:33:58] there I got to get there
[2:34:01] am that's how many of you got here
[2:34:05] because you said I got to get
[2:34:07] there but God is restoring once again he
[2:34:11] is restoring once
[2:34:13] again and seeing bits and pieces
[2:34:16] yes as I look out yonder seeing bits and
[2:34:20] pieces but that ain't where God called
[2:34:22] me to to to to dwell where he called me
[2:34:25] to live to sit under the sound of
[2:34:27] although I can glean out there and I can
[2:34:29] thank God for what is going on out there
[2:34:32] God has called me right here and what
[2:34:34] what I'm seeing right here is that we as
[2:34:36] a body of people we cannot afford to let
[2:34:40] the Next Generation go without the
[2:34:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost musicians are
[2:34:45] coming coming we can't let the Next
[2:34:48] Generation go without the baptism of the
[2:34:51] Holy Ghost we cannot let them go where
[2:34:54] that they think that speaking in tongues
[2:34:56] is something that is taboo we cannot let
[2:34:59] them go in the Next Generation that's
[2:35:02] why we as adults as parents we've got to
[2:35:05] be tongue
[2:35:07] talkers come
[2:35:10] on I am determined when I hold that
[2:35:13] grandbaby of mine and I'm up here
[2:35:15] praying I don't want her to be scared
[2:35:17] when she hears Grandpa praying in
[2:35:20] tongues I don't want her to be scared
[2:35:22] when she hears a groan come out of me I
[2:35:25] don't want her to be scared of that I
[2:35:27] want her to embrace it with everything
[2:35:29] that's on the inside of her when charity
[2:35:31] Grace has children I want to be the same
[2:35:34] way with her children because I don't
[2:35:36] want them to be
[2:35:38] [Applause]
[2:35:43] afraid I don't want your children to be
[2:35:47] afraid when I get
[2:35:50] loud and maybe I scrunch up my face and
[2:35:54] I start praying in tongues or I grown in
[2:35:56] the spirit I don't want your children to
[2:35:58] be afraid and start crying because
[2:36:00] they're afraid no you get them in this
[2:36:03] atmosphere every chance you get you get
[2:36:06] them in this atmosphere you help to
[2:36:08] create this atmosphere you help them to
[2:36:12] understand that praise and worship is
[2:36:14] important that they're voice is
[2:36:16] important that they need to join with
[2:36:18] ours that they're clapping their hands
[2:36:21] and raising their hands is important and
[2:36:23] they're dancing and they're stomping
[2:36:26] it's important it's a part of this
[2:36:28] restoration message that has been given
[2:36:31] to
[2:36:33] us we're passing it down to our children
[2:36:37] all of the nine spiritual gifts part of
[2:36:40] it it's right here in this
[2:36:43] assembly I call it forth today in
[2:36:46] whatever's inside of me I call it forth
[2:36:49] out of you the nine spiritual gifts
[2:36:52] let's stand together I what if you feel
[2:36:54] something inside of you
[2:36:58] glory
[2:36:59] glory use us
[2:37:02] Lord me say one more
[2:37:05] thing we have been beat and we have been
[2:37:08] battered because we say we hear this
[2:37:11] thought it's not about the
[2:37:14] emotion and I want to reiterate to you
[2:37:18] it is not about the
[2:37:21] emotion but I would like to remind you
[2:37:23] of a few
[2:37:25] things as I look back over this message
[2:37:28] of
[2:37:29] truth I want to remind you of a story
[2:37:32] where there were two ladies that went
[2:37:34] across a platform
[2:37:36] once and they were pronounced
[2:37:39] healed both of
[2:37:41] them those two ladies happen to be
[2:37:44] neighbors
[2:37:47] and when they went home neither one of
[2:37:49] them felt healed right but there was
[2:37:53] something on the inside of them that
[2:37:54] they believe the word of a
[2:37:57] prophet and they just kept saying I'm
[2:37:59] Healed I'm
[2:38:01] Healed and brother brandham describes it
[2:38:04] this way one day the one lady there was
[2:38:08] a coolness that came over
[2:38:11] her now may I ask what is coolness
[2:38:18] it seems to me that coolness is an
[2:38:22] emotion it's a feeling of some
[2:38:28] sort and that feeling preceded the
[2:38:33] [Music]
[2:38:37] angel might I remind you of many times
[2:38:40] when he was in the prayer line and he
[2:38:42] said to people you're sensing that warm
[2:38:46] feeling you're sensing that strange
[2:38:49] feeling HT it won't hurt
[2:38:53] you that's just the angel of the
[2:38:57] Lord the feeling preceded the
[2:39:01] angel so don't be afraid of
[2:39:04] feelings you can't live by
[2:39:07] them but when the feeling comes why
[2:39:10] don't you say I receive
[2:39:14] you whatever messenger you're sending
[2:39:17] Lord I receive
[2:39:19] it whatever you want to do with me I
[2:39:22] receive
[2:39:25] it let the Holy Ghost come down on
[2:39:29] me so let the presence of the Lord come
[2:39:32] down on you
[2:39:33] today as we begin to worship let his
[2:39:36] presence come down on you you're a
[2:39:38] people that have set under the sound of
[2:39:40] the word many of you for 20 30 40 50 60
[2:39:43] years you've sat under the sound of the
[2:39:45] the revealed word and you're of no
[2:39:47] shortage of the word of God there are
[2:39:50] many of you that before you got here you
[2:39:52] were beaten battered down and you were
[2:39:54] not allowed to express the feelings that
[2:39:58] you had on the inside but I want you to
[2:40:01] be able to express those feelings and
[2:40:03] today once again I want to tell you
[2:40:07] whatever you feel inside of you if the
[2:40:09] Lord has been dealing with you about a
[2:40:12] specific gift perhaps the gift of faith
[2:40:15] or the gift gift of of discerning of
[2:40:17] spirits we all need that one I'll take
[2:40:19] all nine of them as a matter of fact
[2:40:22] I'll take any of them I'll take any of
[2:40:25] them but if you feel it working in
[2:40:28] you say yes
[2:40:31] Lord yes Lord I am a part of a body that
[2:40:35] allows the nine spiritual gifts and we
[2:40:39] do all things decently and in order and
[2:40:41] we know that the word has preeminence in
[2:40:44] this house and we know that there are
[2:40:46] giftings in this place that that help to
[2:40:49] keep me in divine order and we want
[2:40:51] divine order in the house but we're not
[2:40:53] going to quench anything that the spirit
[2:40:56] of the Lord wants to do let him hover
[2:40:59] over you today let him hover over you as
