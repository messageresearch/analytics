[35:24] lord
[35:26] you are worthy of it
[35:28] all you are worthy of it all the lord
[35:35] reminded this morning
[35:37] that the bible said god made adam from
[35:40] the dust of the earth
[35:43] and god breathed into adam
[35:46] the ruach
[35:47] the ruach hakodesh the life and breath
[35:51] of god
[35:53] the holy spirit the holy ghost of god
[35:56] and adam became
[35:58] a living soul
[36:00] i was reminded that abram received the
[36:04] ruach of god the breath of god and and
[36:08] avram became avraham
[36:12] because of the addition of the breath of
[36:15] god to his life you are no longer who
[36:18] you were
[36:19] before your spirit was regenerated by
[36:22] the living spirit of christ the living
[36:26] spirit of god we are no longer just
[36:29] breathing oxygen from planet earth but
[36:33] we are drawing from the very zoe the
[36:36] very life of a living god it's your
[36:40] breath
[36:42] it's your breath
[36:44] so no wonder the psalmist said let
[36:47] everything that hath breath
[36:50] everything that god has created
[36:54] everything that god has built
[36:57] let everything that hath breath praise
[37:01] you the lord
[37:04] you know rocks have never breathed
[37:08] but jesus said i i can pray
[37:12] my father and he is able to raise up
[37:15] these stones
[37:17] like children of abraham
[37:19] that they would praise the lord if you
[37:22] should hold your peace
[37:25] they've never a rock on the ground has
[37:27] never had the breath of god in it
[37:30] but i love this
[37:32] i love the fact that yeshua jesus the
[37:35] creator he knew that all he had to do
[37:39] was speak
[37:40] and those rocks would have raised up
[37:43] with the breath of god
[37:45] and they would have also had to begin to
[37:48] give god praise
[37:51] so here we stand today determined that
[37:55] no rock is going to have to be raised up
[37:58] in my place
[38:00] but i'm going to praise the lord
[38:04] i'm going to use this breath
[38:07] use this life that god has given me to
[38:11] glorify his name
[38:18] amen
[38:19] [Music]

[1:10:41] we attended one of the longest weddings
[1:10:43] we've ever been to in our lives
[1:10:46] yesterday
[1:10:47] it was almost like an african reception
[1:10:50] because it just lasted into the wee
[1:10:53] hours of the night it felt like
[1:10:55] but we woke up this morning ready
[1:10:59] to be right back in the presence of the
[1:11:01] lord
[1:11:03] and what a beautiful day it was
[1:11:06] what a lovely day it was yesterday to
[1:11:09] worship god
[1:11:11] to feel the presence of the lord
[1:11:14] and his great seal
[1:11:17] as he come and solemnized our gathering
[1:11:20] and the vows
[1:11:21] that were made and we just
[1:11:24] are so happy for
[1:11:26] solomon and zion and we just believe
[1:11:29] that god will use them for his glory
[1:11:32] and uh they have enough advice
[1:11:35] and and enough charges
[1:11:38] and uh enough scripture spoken over them
[1:11:41] and blessings given to them
[1:11:43] they they can be very successful if they
[1:11:45] can just remember everything that you
[1:11:47] shared with them yesterday
[1:11:49] and uh what a wonderful time we had and
[1:11:52] greetings have come in for them from all
[1:11:55] over the world because the wedding was

[1:13:54] sunny
[1:13:59] you jamaica even call a resort a mission
[1:14:02] field can you
[1:14:03] but i think the lord can use them
[1:14:06] i think he can use them but they're
[1:14:08] there for lots of uh rest and relaxation
[1:14:12] and to get over all the stresses that
[1:14:14] come together when you're trying to uh
[1:14:17] plan a wedding it was a lovely reception
[1:14:21] the speeches were were really good and
[1:14:24] really special from from everyone the
[1:14:27] both fathers gave such wonderful
[1:14:30] summaries and uh observations about the
[1:14:33] young couple's lives
[1:14:35] and um solomon's sisters why they're
[1:14:39] they're almost comedians they did such
[1:14:41] an amazing job
[1:14:43] and even in the fun
[1:14:45] the presence of the lord was still there
[1:14:48] and we appreciated that and brother
[1:14:51] brother zig clar who pastors the church
[1:14:53] in edmonton
[1:14:55] and then brother stephen who's the
[1:14:57] assistant pastor out for brother andes
[1:14:59] we've known them for nearly 30 years
[1:15:04] and to be reacquainted like that
[1:15:07] was a real blessing and to be able to
[1:15:10] you know it's so nice when you can pick
[1:15:12] up where you left off
[1:15:14] and we just picked up where we left off
[1:15:16] and just went forward and uh we're
[1:15:18] looking forward to maybe more fellowship
[1:15:20] with them in the future
[1:15:22] and uh
[1:15:23] they that the elder cars had been
[1:15:27] uh away they had been on a cruise and
[1:15:30] they had been away from their home for

[1:15:38] clars solomon's parents they start a
[1:15:41] food festival they do catering and they
[1:15:44] start a food festival tomorrow in

[1:16:17] gift
[1:16:18] and i really enjoyed it and i really
[1:16:20] appreciate it and i i i refrained myself

[1:18:34] up and down and bones get sore
[1:18:37] but if you're able let's honor god's
[1:18:39] word this way
[1:18:41] let's go all the way back to the
[1:18:43] beginning is that all right
[1:18:45] let's go to genesis chapter one
[1:18:47] i love preaching from these verses
[1:18:51] for some of you this might feel a little
[1:18:53] bit like a re-run
[1:18:55] i i wonder if anyone has ever watched an
[1:18:58] episode of
[1:19:00] let's just say little house on the
[1:19:02] prairie more than once
[1:19:04] well my children growing up didn't have
[1:19:06] television but they had some videos
[1:19:09] allowed them and
[1:19:11] when they got stuck on something they
[1:19:13] would watch it until they could memorize
[1:19:16] the parts
[1:19:18] and they could tell you who said what
[1:19:20] next and i'm sure they're not the only
[1:19:23] ones that have ever watched something
[1:19:25] this series that's out now the chosen i
[1:19:28] have watched almost every episode two or
[1:19:31] three times
[1:19:33] the more i watch it the more i
[1:19:35] understand who's who
[1:19:38] it takes me a while i i didn't get it
[1:19:40] going through i couldn't remember faces
[1:19:42] to names but
[1:19:44] i've been so inspired by different parts
[1:19:47] of it and aspects of it
[1:19:49] until i've enjoyed watching it repeat
[1:19:53] and uh how many of you have ever read a
[1:19:55] book more than once
[1:19:57] sure
[1:19:58] i have to
[1:20:00] i have to read something one or two
[1:20:02] times sometime to get the full
[1:20:05] impact of it especially when someone can
[1:20:07] really write
[1:20:09] and i like to read something like that
[1:20:11] but it takes a little effort and a
[1:20:12] little time so if this uh feels like a
[1:20:16] rerun to some of you well uh okay that's
[1:20:19] all right
[1:20:20] but i'm very aware that we have a new
[1:20:23] congregation and we have
[1:20:25] many new ones among us now and we have
[1:20:28] many new ones streaming for the first
[1:20:30] time
[1:20:31] someone at the wedding yesterday from
[1:20:33] another place said brother shelley the
[1:20:35] best thing you ever did was open up your
[1:20:37] stream so that people could watch
[1:20:39] without having to go through the
[1:20:41] password and all of that it does offer
[1:20:44] people some some ability to be anonymous
[1:20:49] and it makes it easier it's just a more
[1:20:52] easy effort just to click and start
[1:20:54] watching
[1:20:55] and so may god let his word go forth
[1:20:58] today to those who haven't heard these
[1:21:00] thoughts
[1:21:02] may it be new and fresh and alive and
[1:21:04] catch their heart and may god take the
[1:21:07] rest of us drive it a little deeper than
[1:21:09] it's ever been before because we're
[1:21:11] getting ready for the rapture we're
[1:21:14] getting ready for the lord to come and
[1:21:16] get those that are his
[1:21:18] and he's dressing us in the revealed
[1:21:20] word of god
[1:21:22] this is the bridal garment amen
[1:21:24] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:21:28] and the earth period
[1:21:31] and the earth was without form
[1:21:35] and void
[1:21:36] and darkness
[1:21:38] was upon the face
[1:21:40] of the deep
[1:21:42] and the spirit of god
[1:21:45] moved upon the face
[1:21:49] of the waters
[1:21:51] i like the language of the king james
[1:21:54] there
[1:21:55] the spirit of god moved upon
[1:22:00] the face
[1:22:01] the surface
[1:22:03] of the waters i can almost see it
[1:22:06] when i read those words
[1:22:09] and it goes on and god said
[1:22:11] let there be light
[1:22:15] and guess what
[1:22:17] there was light
[1:22:19] because whatever god says it happens
[1:22:23] all you need is a word from god for your
[1:22:26] life
[1:22:27] and it happens
[1:22:29] and by the way he's still a walking
[1:22:31] talking god
[1:22:33] he didn't stop talking when the old
[1:22:35] testament prophets died he still talks
[1:22:38] today
[1:22:40] amen and even though we may not have a
[1:22:43] major word prophet in our land anymore
[1:22:47] we are thankful that there is a fivefold
[1:22:49] ministry
[1:22:50] and there are apostles prophets pastors
[1:22:53] teachers and evangelists after the order
[1:22:56] of ephesians they're with the body
[1:22:59] and when god speaks it happens
[1:23:02] may not happen when you want it to
[1:23:04] happen but he's always right on time
[1:23:08] and so god saw the light
[1:23:11] and it was
[1:23:13] good
[1:23:14] what's the hebrew word there
[1:23:16] tov
[1:23:17] toph
[1:23:19] it it doesn't just mean good
[1:23:21] it means complete
[1:23:23] it means whole
[1:23:26] it means doing what god created it to do
[1:23:30] so the light was good it was complete it
[1:23:33] was whole and it was manifesting the
[1:23:36] purpose of its creation isn't that
[1:23:38] powerful and god divided the light
[1:23:42] from the darkness
[1:23:44] and god called the light
[1:23:46] day and the darkness he called
[1:23:50] night
[1:23:51] and the evening
[1:23:54] and the morning
[1:23:55] were the first day
[1:23:58] now i think you might pay attention a
[1:24:00] little more if you if you stand for a
[1:24:02] few more moments and let me read this in
[1:24:04] the amplified if you will and then we'll
[1:24:06] have our seat
[1:24:08] same five verses
[1:24:10] in the beginning god prepared formed
[1:24:14] fashion and created the heavens and the
[1:24:18] earth
[1:24:19] the earth was without form
[1:24:22] and an empty waste
[1:24:25] and darkness was upon the face
[1:24:28] of the very great deep
[1:24:31] the spirit of god was moving
[1:24:34] hovering
[1:24:36] brooding
[1:24:37] over the face of the waters you're
[1:24:40] getting an image if you're listening
[1:24:42] and god said let there be light and
[1:24:46] there was light
[1:24:47] and god saw that the light was good
[1:24:50] suitable pleasant and he approved it
[1:24:54] and god
[1:24:56] separated the light from the darkness
[1:24:59] and god called the light day in the
[1:25:01] darkness he called night and there was
[1:25:04] evening and there was morning one day
[1:25:07] let's pray together oh father
[1:25:10] how we love to read
[1:25:12] these precious words
[1:25:15] of earth's creation
[1:25:18] we just come away every time
[1:25:21] in our hearts
[1:25:22] remembering what a mighty god what an
[1:25:26] awesome god what a supreme god what a
[1:25:29] sovereign god you are
[1:25:32] we stand in awe
[1:25:34] of who you are we bow our lives before
[1:25:38] you in reverential fear because we know
[1:25:42] that you are everything your word says
[1:25:44] that you are and you have chosen o
[1:25:48] precious papa you have chosen to
[1:25:52] condescend you came to this earth as a
[1:25:55] man to secure our salvation and
[1:25:59] redemption and once again you have
[1:26:02] chosen to condescend to fill people with
[1:26:06] your essence with your spirit with who
[1:26:09] you are and so we stand here today as a
[1:26:13] body as a bride as a company of sons we
[1:26:17] stand here today
[1:26:19] as your vessels as your temples as your
[1:26:24] reflection for once again you have
[1:26:26] chosen to inhabit even mortal flesh you
[1:26:30] live in us
[1:26:32] we are not carrying just a
[1:26:35] representative of who you are it's the
[1:26:37] very life you told us so
[1:26:40] jesus in your word we were told that
[1:26:44] that when you would come the father
[1:26:46] comes with you and that you would not
[1:26:49] leave us without a comforter but you
[1:26:51] would come and live inside of us we
[1:26:54] acknowledge
[1:26:56] that you have kept your word and you
[1:26:58] have inhabited the people by the power
[1:27:01] of the holy ghost and we give you glory
[1:27:04] and honor for that we rebuke the
[1:27:06] devourer we take authority over darkness
[1:27:10] we smite you in the mighty name of jesus
[1:27:13] and remove you from this place in the
[1:27:16] authority of the king of kings and the
[1:27:18] lord of lords we ask that the word of
[1:27:20] god be quickened to us and that we be
[1:27:23] anointed both to give it and to receive
[1:27:26] it in the mighty name of the lord jesus
[1:27:28] christ we pray amen and the church said
[1:27:33] you may be seated
[1:27:35] what a good god we serve
[1:27:38] i want to talk to you this morning and
[1:27:40] preach to you and teach you a little bit
[1:27:42] i want us to to talk about some things i
[1:27:46] want us to examine some things
[1:27:49] i recognize that even among church going
[1:27:52] folk
[1:27:52] even among people who have spent their
[1:27:56] entire lives in church
[1:27:59] brother billy mentioned yesterday at the
[1:28:01] reception and i mentioned in the
[1:28:03] ceremony that zion grace her mother was
[1:28:07] in labor with her in a watch night
[1:28:10] service at the old church in columbus
[1:28:13] and participated
[1:28:15] in her mother's belly in a jericho march
[1:28:18] that night and sister laurel began to go
[1:28:21] into labor and because she's such a
[1:28:23] dutiful servant she just kept playing
[1:28:25] the piano
[1:28:28] just playing right on just doing
[1:28:29] everything that she could
[1:28:31] in fact making us a little bit nervous
[1:28:34] but she was all right she had peace
[1:28:38] and you know you can't get any more uh
[1:28:42] you can't say about somebody that
[1:28:44] they've been in church all their life
[1:28:47] any more than you can a circumstance
[1:28:48] like that
[1:28:50] and and i'm old enough to remember that
[1:28:53] in the old days at the holiness church
[1:28:56] that i grew up in i want you to know
[1:28:58] those were real women
[1:29:02] i mean i don't know they hadn't had all
[1:29:04] this
[1:29:06] hybrid food that people eat today
[1:29:13] they didn't they just come to church
[1:29:14] they shouted all over the room
[1:29:17] praise god serve the lord went into
[1:29:20] labor and more than once i'm not
[1:29:22] exaggerating more than once
[1:29:25] we'd see a little commotion
[1:29:27] as the sisters would take a sister out
[1:29:29] big swell belly they would take her out
[1:29:31] to the sunday school room
[1:29:34] church never stopped
[1:29:36] preacher never stopped preaching
[1:29:38] saints never stopped worshiping and i
[1:29:41] hate to tell you this daddy never got up
[1:29:47] he just stayed on his pew hey man
[1:29:49] brother preach on brother he never got
[1:29:52] up
[1:29:53] in a few minutes mama come walking out
[1:29:55] i'm telling you the truth
[1:29:57] a few minutes mama come walking out with
[1:29:59] a baby and a blanket
[1:30:01] and she made her a little jericho march
[1:30:03] around the service yes sir
[1:30:06] daddy jumped up and run around to see
[1:30:08] his little baby and walk with her giving
[1:30:10] god praise
[1:30:12] brother those were the days
[1:30:15] anybody going to help me a little bit
[1:30:17] you don't remember it
[1:30:19] those were the days
[1:30:22] they weren't going to miss church to
[1:30:23] have a baby
[1:30:28] and just like brother billy said zion
[1:30:30] was right back not even 24 years 24
[1:30:33] hours old right back in service
[1:30:36] these are the ways of people who have
[1:30:39] sold out their lives
[1:30:43] to the kingdom of god don't tell me god
[1:30:46] can't help you
[1:30:48] don't tell me he can't strengthen you
[1:30:51] he will if you let him
[1:30:53] amen if you let your talk talk and your
[1:30:56] walk walk line up with the word
[1:30:59] god will honor your testimony
[1:31:02] oh my
[1:31:04] even those that have been in church
[1:31:06] though all their lives
[1:31:08] sometimes have an identity crisis
[1:31:12] and they fail to know who they are and
[1:31:16] they failed to understand
[1:31:18] why they were born
[1:31:21] if i were to take a little survey you
[1:31:23] better stay awake
[1:31:25] if i were to take a little survey here
[1:31:27] this morning and ask you do you know the
[1:31:29] reason
[1:31:31] that you were born
[1:31:32] do you know why you were born maybe you
[1:31:35] would say like the old song i was born
[1:31:38] to serve the lord and i agree with you
[1:31:40] 100
[1:31:41] you were born to serve the lord that's
[1:31:43] exactly right that's why we're here to
[1:31:45] reflect who he is
[1:31:47] to give him our all to lead our families
[1:31:50] in the ways of righteousness and truth
[1:31:53] amen to live a dedicated and sanctified
[1:31:56] life apart from the pleasures of this
[1:31:58] whole world and shine
[1:32:01] for jesus
[1:32:03] everywhere we go and all the time can
[1:32:06] anybody say amen but i think it's
[1:32:08] important sometime for a person to have
[1:32:10] a revelation to really begin to
[1:32:13] understand why
[1:32:15] you are here and who you really are i
[1:32:18] want to talk about this morning just a
[1:32:20] little bit i want to talk about who you
[1:32:22] really are i want you to understand just
[1:32:25] just you're scratching the surface but i
[1:32:28] want you to understand who you are and
[1:32:30] where you came from i want you to know
[1:32:33] your origin
[1:32:37] i want you to know you you're older than
[1:32:39] your birthday
[1:32:42] i want you to know you existed before
[1:32:45] you were ever born
[1:32:46] in the mind of god
[1:32:48] i'm not a mormon and i don't believe in
[1:32:50] the pre-existence of souls
[1:32:52] but i do believe that we pre-existed in
[1:32:55] the mind of god
[1:32:57] we were his thoughts
[1:32:59] we were among his attributes
[1:33:02] and we were there in a form that had the
[1:33:06] ability to praise him then
[1:33:12] i don't know what it looked like
[1:33:15] i don't understand it all but i know
[1:33:18] that the sons of god they danced and
[1:33:21] shouted before the lord in eternity's
[1:33:25] past
[1:33:27] maybe by some expression or maybe only
[1:33:30] in the thought processes of the living
[1:33:33] god but it blesses me to know that i was
[1:33:37] a praiser before i was ever born
[1:33:40] it blesses me to know that i
[1:33:42] acknowledged and worshiped the creator
[1:33:44] before i was ever expressed on the earth
[1:33:47] you see i've recognized who i am
[1:33:50] i've recognized where i come from and
[1:33:53] i've recognized what my duty what my
[1:33:56] commission what my mandate here is on
[1:33:59] planet earth and i want every one of you
[1:34:02] to be able to experience that for
[1:34:03] yourselves you can't catch it
[1:34:07] it's not contagious
[1:34:09] but you can understand that it's
[1:34:11] possible and in fact it's nearly
[1:34:14] necessary
[1:34:16] for you to understand that you are here
[1:34:18] for a purpose
[1:34:20] i think in the world sometime in the in
[1:34:23] the movement of
[1:34:25] of self-improvement and personal
[1:34:27] development i think sometimes they call
[1:34:30] it finding your why
[1:34:32] i can relate to that
[1:34:35] that doesn't offend me i want you to
[1:34:37] know your why
[1:34:39] i want you to know why you were born i
[1:34:42] want you to know why you were born now
[1:34:45] i want you to know why you're living in
[1:34:46] this age
[1:34:48] come on now i want you to know that god
[1:34:51] placed you here not just to be a husband
[1:34:54] not just to be a wife
[1:34:57] not just to be a hard worker
[1:34:59] but he placed you here for a purpose for
[1:35:02] a calling
[1:35:04] for a reason
[1:35:06] it's not just preachers that have
[1:35:07] commissions
[1:35:09] every true son of god is here on a
[1:35:12] mandate
[1:35:14] you are here on a commission
[1:35:17] you are here for a reason
[1:35:20] that's why our decisions matter
[1:35:24] that's why who we marry matters
[1:35:26] that's why what we name our children
[1:35:32] matters
[1:35:33] because we're not here to live our best
[1:35:35] life
[1:35:36] we're here to live his life
[1:35:38] we're here to express who he is
[1:35:40] we're not here to walk like the world
[1:35:42] and talk like the world and dress like
[1:35:45] the world and do what the world does
[1:35:48] we're called to be a separated holy
[1:35:50] peculiar nation
[1:35:52] and i know some people take that
[1:35:54] peculiar a little far
[1:35:57] you just plain out weird
[1:35:59] strange that's not what he's talking
[1:36:01] about you know i'm preaching to myself
[1:36:03] when i say that
[1:36:04] because i find myself to be one of the
[1:36:06] strangest people i've ever known
[1:36:10] somebody said i don't really understand
[1:36:12] you
[1:36:13] i don't want you to i don't expect you
[1:36:16] to
[1:36:17] because sometimes i don't even
[1:36:18] understand myself
[1:36:20] but i tell you what i am what i am
[1:36:24] by the grace of god
[1:36:26] you tell those people that talk about me
[1:36:28] and say he speaks in tongues too much
[1:36:30] you just go tell him that the first
[1:36:32] church age messenger said i speak in
[1:36:34] tongues more than ye all
[1:36:36] if that's the only accusation that
[1:36:38] somebody can bring against me
[1:36:42] he talks in tongues too much
[1:36:44] he dances too much he shouts too much he
[1:36:47] gets too excited i'll be all right
[1:36:50] i don't always understand myself but i
[1:36:52] know that i'm here for a reason
[1:36:55] let me tell you something else i know
[1:36:56] about me and you we're not going
[1:36:58] anywhere
[1:37:01] not by cancer
[1:37:04] not by heart disease not by covet
[1:37:08] not at the other end of a gun
[1:37:11] until he calls us
[1:37:17] yeah
[1:37:18] you know some leaders some some some
[1:37:20] very respected people in the
[1:37:23] in the charismatic and pentecostal faith
[1:37:25] world passed away particularly one
[1:37:28] pastor's wife
[1:37:29] passed away this week and i never met
[1:37:32] them but i met their son
[1:37:35] and uh he led worship in in a conference
[1:37:38] where i was speaking in canada and i
[1:37:40] enjoyed meeting them very much and this
[1:37:43] is a place where faith is really taught
[1:37:46] strong and and uh
[1:37:48] where they have believed that god could
[1:37:51] then would make their community a
[1:37:53] cancer-free zone and they were just
[1:37:56] believing for for great uh
[1:37:58] manifestations of god's power and i love
[1:38:01] that i'm not against that
[1:38:03] but but without
[1:38:05] even with all the prayer
[1:38:07] and even with all the intercession and
[1:38:09] even with all the positive words
[1:38:12] this woman passed away this week
[1:38:15] and i get so shocked sometime at how
[1:38:18] social media responds
[1:38:21] supposed to be believers
[1:38:24] and you know what they just ripped into
[1:38:26] the
[1:38:28] church ripped right into the church i so
[1:38:31] long for supposed to be friends of mine
[1:38:34] long discourses about when is the church
[1:38:37] going to pray the prayer of faith and
[1:38:40] when is the church going to realize that
[1:38:43] how many more do we have to lose and how
[1:38:46] many more is satan going to steal and
[1:38:48] how many more is he going to kill
[1:38:53] you know that makes me fighting mad
[1:38:55] spitting man
[1:38:58] i it takes everything i can do
[1:39:00] to keep to to keep from getting in the
[1:39:02] social media wars
[1:39:04] because i want to say wait a minute
[1:39:08] i'm not going to preach a god who's
[1:39:10] weaker than the devil he created
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] wished i had some help
[1:39:18] i'm not going to preach about a god who
[1:39:21] creates an enemy and lets him have more
[1:39:23] power
[1:39:25] authority than himself
[1:39:28] the devil will try the devil will try
[1:39:31] the devil will try he'll try to kill you
[1:39:34] he'll try to afflict you he'll try to
[1:39:37] bankrupt you but he cannot touch you
[1:39:41] unless god allows
[1:39:48] when i die
[1:39:49] if i die when i die no matter how i die
[1:39:55] i want you to know
[1:39:57] he called me
[1:40:02] if i go down lay down to go to sleep and
[1:40:05] don't wake up he called me if some
[1:40:08] vicious thing lays a hold on my body he
[1:40:11] called me
[1:40:12] if some madman comes to snuff me out he
[1:40:16] called me
[1:40:18] i don't believe the devil can kill a
[1:40:21] true son of god
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:26] i don't even believe he can give me a
[1:40:28] headache
[1:40:29] if god doesn't allow it
[1:40:32] and if god allows it guess what
[1:40:35] he supplies the healing i need
[1:40:39] oh i'm preaching
[1:40:41] and the grace i need
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:45] don't you blame the church
[1:40:47] and tell them they didn't pray enough
[1:40:50] oh if you'd only prayed more
[1:40:54] oh i'm just getting started
[1:40:58] i know i'm wading through deep water
[1:41:00] because the sweat's running down the
[1:41:01] middle of my back
[1:41:03] i know i'm getting into some deep water
[1:41:05] now
[1:41:06] i just i'm not going to buy that
[1:41:08] theology that's not bible theology i
[1:41:10] believe in the sovereignty of god
[1:41:13] i believe you're here because god wanted
[1:41:15] you here
[1:41:16] don't you tell me i just decided to come
[1:41:19] visit you did not decide
[1:41:21] you thought it was your idea
[1:41:25] you're here because for some reason
[1:41:28] god wanted you in this place
[1:41:30] you see i've got confidence in you
[1:41:33] i've got confidence in you that you've
[1:41:35] followed some nudge
[1:41:39] i've got confidence that god ordained
[1:41:42] for you and i to be gathered this way
[1:41:44] today
[1:41:45] and there's a reason for it and there's
[1:41:47] a purpose for it
[1:41:48] and we may never be gathered just like
[1:41:50] this again
[1:41:52] so we've got to make the most of this
[1:41:53] moment
[1:41:54] we've got to squeeze until we get
[1:41:56] everything out of this service that god
[1:41:59] wants for us today
[1:42:01] because tomorrow will be too late
[1:42:04] to get what god had for us
[1:42:06] today
[1:42:08] he's got an appointment with his
[1:42:09] children
[1:42:10] there's a season for his children and we
[1:42:14] want to stay up we want to keep up with
[1:42:16] what god's doing
[1:42:18] we want to bar are you with me
[1:42:20] i just felt somebody slipping
[1:42:22] we want to march to the drumbeat of
[1:42:24] heaven
[1:42:25] we want to move in synchronization with
[1:42:28] every frequency and every movement that
[1:42:31] takes place in the throne of god
[1:42:34] yes we want to live our lives as those
[1:42:37] led by the spirit of the lord you've got
[1:42:39] to know you've got to know you're not
[1:42:41] here because your daddy had a twinkle in
[1:42:44] his eye
[1:42:50] you're not here because a man seduced a
[1:42:52] woman
[1:42:55] are a woman seduced a man
[1:42:58] you're here right now in this age in
[1:43:02] this hour because god wanted you to live
[1:43:06] he didn't want you to live in the bible
[1:43:07] day over there he didn't want you to
[1:43:09] live in the ephesian church age
[1:43:11] you were not to be expressed in the
[1:43:13] philadelphia church smyrna and thyatira
[1:43:15] and sardisian
[1:43:17] you were to be born in the age of
[1:43:19] laodicea which is the last age which
[1:43:23] means we're closer to eternity
[1:43:25] oh we're so close to eternity now
[1:43:29] that just like tuesday night josh when
[1:43:31] the presence of the lord came
[1:43:33] unexpectedly
[1:43:34] you mean you didn't expect his presence
[1:43:36] to be no i expected him to be here but
[1:43:39] not like that
[1:43:40] when i stepped up here to this pulpit he
[1:43:43] began to pull me
[1:43:45] and i could feel a portion of who i was
[1:43:48] leaving my body
[1:43:50] and i want you to know to navigate that
[1:43:52] kind of of coexistence
[1:43:56] between heaven and earth
[1:43:59] between that realm and this realm
[1:44:02] i
[1:44:03] i'll never get used to it i'll never
[1:44:06] grow accustomed to it
[1:44:08] and i may never be any better at
[1:44:10] handling it than i am now
[1:44:12] but i repented the next day
[1:44:14] i spent the day with brother josh there
[1:44:16] alano
[1:44:17] and uh
[1:44:19] spent eight hours with him in fact that
[1:44:21] day
[1:44:22] and i repented to him and i said i've
[1:44:24] just felt so bad
[1:44:26] because i i i think there was something
[1:44:28] god wanted to do and
[1:44:30] and somehow i got my mind on
[1:44:33] on
[1:44:34] on people and
[1:44:36] and streamers and
[1:44:38] and and those who would be expecting
[1:44:40] some some scripture and
[1:44:43] and i know we need that and i know the
[1:44:45] prophet has given us an order and i know
[1:44:47] that he says no service is complete
[1:44:49] without the reading of a scripture to
[1:44:50] take them and all of it i understand all
[1:44:52] that
[1:44:53] but but somehow
[1:44:54] i felt that i i missed it but i as i
[1:44:58] reflected the next day i didn't know
[1:45:00] what i could have done different either
[1:45:02] but i just wasn't satisfied with how i
[1:45:04] responded i just wanted to fly i'll just
[1:45:06] be honest with you we don't live by
[1:45:09] feelings but i just really wanted to
[1:45:11] take wing
[1:45:12] i feel the pull
[1:45:14] i didn't didn't you post the words of
[1:45:16] that elias i feel the pull i hear the
[1:45:19] call
[1:45:20] i know his spirit is bidding me to give
[1:45:24] my all
[1:45:27] he speaks to me and i agree
[1:45:33] lord please come and take control
[1:45:36] i feel the pool
[1:45:38] how many of you love to feel the pull of
[1:45:40] the spirit
[1:45:41] the drawing of the holy ghost the
[1:45:43] presence of the lord that gives us life
[1:45:48] it seems perhaps that that was
[1:45:50] transferring somehow tangibly out of
[1:45:53] this place yesterday
[1:45:55] when we were assigning the marriage
[1:45:57] certificate and my kids were singing the
[1:46:00] blessing and that that anointing was
[1:46:03] going out and i had just a string of
[1:46:05] messages and private messages and texts
[1:46:08] that said the anointing was just filling
[1:46:11] the room where we were it was just
[1:46:13] filling the room brother clark said to
[1:46:16] me i've never been in a more lovely
[1:46:18] service in all my life where the
[1:46:20] presence of the lord came in a wedding
[1:46:22] like that he said it was just
[1:46:24] outstanding and it was indeed and we
[1:46:27] need him
[1:46:28] we need him
[1:46:30] the church sometimes condemns us and
[1:46:32] they say you're always talking about a
[1:46:35] feeling but you don't understand we're
[1:46:37] not living by feelings we're living by
[1:46:41] faith
[1:46:42] but he wants us
[1:46:44] to experience him
[1:46:46] in reality
[1:46:48] and in real now i'm so sick of religion
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:54] i'm so sick of church entity
[1:46:58] i want realness
[1:47:00] i want reality
[1:47:02] i want jesus christ the same
[1:47:05] yesterday today and forever i got to
[1:47:08] preach
[1:47:09] i've got to preach on i got to move on
[1:47:11] i've got to go on now when we get to
[1:47:14] genesis 1 3
[1:47:17] and god said let there be light
[1:47:20] what we're reading about
[1:47:22] is most likely the restoration
[1:47:26] of the prior creation
[1:47:28] now we don't have time to go into every
[1:47:30] aspect of this
[1:47:32] but yes
[1:47:34] i am one of those neanderthal christians
[1:47:37] who believes that there was a pre-adamic
[1:47:41] existence
[1:47:43] i'm one of those antiquated christians
[1:47:46] that believes that there was a gap
[1:47:49] in theology
[1:47:51] it's sometimes called the gap theory
[1:47:54] and i'm one of those so just so you'll
[1:47:56] know i'm an antique
[1:47:58] and i believe in the in the idea that
[1:48:00] there was a gap
[1:48:02] between genesis 1 1
[1:48:04] and genesis 1 2.
[1:48:06] i believe that when god made the earth
[1:48:10] he did not originally form it
[1:48:13] to be formless
[1:48:16] and void
[1:48:18] i have studied the nature of god
[1:48:20] throughout the writings of the prophets
[1:48:22] of the old testament
[1:48:24] and should i have time i can read you
[1:48:27] some of the comments that they make in
[1:48:29] scripture about the nature of god's
[1:48:32] creative ability and power and there is
[1:48:35] nothing in me
[1:48:37] that feels or sees in the word that god
[1:48:42] is in the business of creating something
[1:48:45] in darkness
[1:48:47] in void
[1:48:48] in waste
[1:48:50] in chaos
[1:48:52] i believe that the mind of god is the
[1:48:55] most ordered environment
[1:48:58] in all eternity
[1:49:02] there's no confusion
[1:49:05] god's never at an aha moment
[1:49:09] nothing has ever caught him by surprise
[1:49:12] do i have anybody to preach to
[1:49:14] he's always moving
[1:49:17] just as he thought he should
[1:49:20] everything planned and everything
[1:49:21] orderly and so what we read
[1:49:24] that is that in in
[1:49:26] in all likelihood there was something
[1:49:29] that took place
[1:49:30] and we know by scripture should we be
[1:49:32] able to get to it if not we'll close it
[1:49:34] up on tuesday night
[1:49:36] but we know that satan had this ambition
[1:49:40] he was no longer satisfied just to rule
[1:49:43] over the the baby creation of earth
[1:49:46] he realized i i can have more i can be
[1:49:50] more
[1:49:51] i will exalt my throne i'll get myself
[1:49:54] up above the throne of god
[1:49:56] he had great ambition and may i just
[1:49:59] remind you that even that
[1:50:01] did not take god by surprise
[1:50:06] did you know when judas was born god
[1:50:08] already knew what he was
[1:50:12] you know when judas's mother held him in
[1:50:14] her arms and loved him and nursed him
[1:50:16] and wooed him god already knew he was a
[1:50:18] betrayer
[1:50:22] did you know that when satan was created
[1:50:25] god already knew what would be in him
[1:50:27] how do you think it got there
[1:50:32] when god took eve out of adam don't you
[1:50:34] know he already knew what he would do
[1:50:39] where do you think that got in her how
[1:50:41] do you think that was ever in her in the
[1:50:43] first place
[1:50:46] it was in there because she was created
[1:50:49] thus
[1:50:50] judas was created thus
[1:50:53] cain was created thus
[1:50:56] we go right through the word
[1:50:59] we see the same manifestations today
[1:51:02] created us
[1:51:04] they're still twins in the earth
[1:51:08] there are still those being born who
[1:51:11] have already come
[1:51:13] with a prefix destiny
[1:51:16] so that they will when it's time to make
[1:51:19] a choice
[1:51:20] god saw by foreknowledge
[1:51:24] what their choice would be
[1:51:26] he did
[1:51:27] he didn't make their choice
[1:51:29] he allowed them a choice
[1:51:31] he saw their choice before they ever
[1:51:33] made their choice i'm just quoting new
[1:51:35] testament now he saw their i'm getting
[1:51:37] ahead
[1:51:38] saw their choice and based on their
[1:51:41] choice he fixed them prefixed them a
[1:51:43] destiny that's the very meaning of the
[1:51:45] word predestination having a prefix
[1:51:47] destiny
[1:51:48] so god already knows he already knows
[1:51:51] your uprisings and your downfallings
[1:51:53] he already knows where you're going to
[1:51:55] end up
[1:51:56] come on who you're going to end up with
[1:51:58] what's going on and he loves you
[1:52:00] oh this is incredible
[1:52:03] he loves you
[1:52:06] you know if we were to go back and dig
[1:52:08] under the blood and try to pull some
[1:52:09] things up there's some rotten things in
[1:52:11] this room
[1:52:13] none of it took god by surprise none of
[1:52:16] that sin took god by surprise oh he saw
[1:52:20] he saw your your predisposition
[1:52:25] he saw your generational stuff before
[1:52:27] you were ever born don't you think god
[1:52:29] saw it coming down through the
[1:52:30] bloodlines
[1:52:31] don't you think he knew that if
[1:52:33] addiction was coming down through your
[1:52:34] bloodline that it would touch your life
[1:52:36] in some way
[1:52:37] but he already made a plan to get you
[1:52:39] out
[1:52:40] i'm telling you right now he has already
[1:52:42] made a plan to get you out
[1:52:44] just because daddy wasn't granddad he
[1:52:46] wasn't great-granddad he wasn't
[1:52:48] great-great-granddaddy was
[1:52:50] does it mean you have to be
[1:52:53] because we are awakening to who we are
[1:52:56] and why we were born
[1:52:58] we do not come in our own authority and
[1:53:01] power we come in the power and the
[1:53:03] authority of the lord jesus christ
[1:53:06] king of all kings and lord of all lord
[1:53:09] are you here
[1:53:10] praise god so what we read in genesis 1
[1:53:14] verses 3 through 31 is really the
[1:53:17] restoration of the earth back
[1:53:21] to a similar original condition
[1:53:24] before it was made formless and void and
[1:53:27] submerged in darkness and water because
[1:53:30] of satan's rebellion
[1:53:32] so i want you to see an earth made
[1:53:34] perfect
[1:53:35] and i want you to see a created cherub
[1:53:38] who was commissioned
[1:53:40] to have authority over this newly
[1:53:42] created earth
[1:53:44] and lucifer the the old testament tells
[1:53:46] us lucifer walked among he walked around
[1:53:49] he walked in the midst of the earth
[1:53:51] and he had dominion
[1:53:54] he had been in heaven
[1:53:56] he had been something like a choir
[1:53:57] director or a music leader
[1:54:00] he was thus created that even the form
[1:54:02] of his body made music
[1:54:05] we're looking at hebrew
[1:54:06] in hebrew we discover that there were
[1:54:09] some sort of
[1:54:10] of pipes
[1:54:14] can you imagine having an organ in your
[1:54:17] body
[1:54:18] i don't mean a liver
[1:54:20] i mean a pipe organ
[1:54:22] in the hebrew it tells us that lucifer
[1:54:25] was so created that there was musical
[1:54:28] ability in his body
[1:54:32] so you people that were born with a
[1:54:33] groove
[1:54:40] nothing wrong with that
[1:54:42] music
[1:54:44] speaks
[1:54:45] moves some people
[1:54:47] in different ways than it does other
[1:54:49] people brother i can't be still
[1:54:52] you put a little holy ghost song on i
[1:54:54] can't be stealing
[1:54:56] i quit trying to be still because i feel
[1:54:58] it
[1:55:00] the church will try to church you the
[1:55:01] church will try to hold you back and the
[1:55:04] church will try to tell you don't dance
[1:55:05] like that don't jump like that don't
[1:55:07] holler amen like that don't wave a flag
[1:55:10] like that don't you just love how how we
[1:55:12] have worshiped police
[1:55:15] don't you just love how there's praise
[1:55:17] police i i just wish we didn't have them
[1:55:20] always trying to tell somebody else how
[1:55:22] how they can praise the lord and what's
[1:55:24] real praise and what's ordered praise
[1:55:26] and what's not praying you want to know
[1:55:28] what kind of praise god responds to the
[1:55:30] kindness mentioned in the book of psalms
[1:55:33] shout your praise speak your praise sing
[1:55:36] your praise do it standing do it
[1:55:39] kneeling do it laying down
[1:55:41] raise your hand clap your hand play
[1:55:44] instruments with your hands let
[1:55:46] everything that happen oh oh
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:51] let everything that i pray let
[1:55:54] everything that have breath let
[1:55:56] everything that happens
[1:55:58] praise the lord
[1:56:00] praise the lord
[1:56:02] praise the lord
[1:56:05] we are not ashamed
[1:56:07] we're not ashamed
[1:56:10] to praise the lord
[1:56:13] be seated
[1:56:15] hallelujah
[1:56:16] it's just simply not in the nature of
[1:56:18] god to create something incomplete
[1:56:22] and
[1:56:23] imperfect
[1:56:25] give me isaiah 45 18. whoo
[1:56:30] my my my
[1:56:32] my my my my my
[1:56:34] that was beginning to feel like a praise
[1:56:36] break
[1:56:37] [Music]
[1:56:39] i can do all that without the
[1:56:40] organ glory glory glory
[1:56:44] glory glory glory
[1:56:45] well what good did that do well if
[1:56:48] nothing else it got some of your blood
[1:56:50] running through your body
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:53] put a little color in your cheek some of
[1:56:55] you needed it
[1:56:57] get your heart pumping a little bit get
[1:56:59] you ready to hear a little more of god's
[1:57:00] word
[1:57:02] isaiah 45 18
[1:57:05] for thus saith the lord
[1:57:07] that created the heavens god himself
[1:57:12] that formed the earth
[1:57:14] and made it
[1:57:17] he hath established it
[1:57:20] he listen
[1:57:22] he created it read it for me
[1:57:25] not in vain
[1:57:28] not in void
[1:57:30] not in chaos
[1:57:33] not in darkness
[1:57:35] not without phone he formed it
[1:57:40] what does it say
[1:57:42] to be inhabited
[1:57:45] you couldn't inhabit the earth you read
[1:57:47] about in in genesis 1 2 there
[1:57:50] where it talks about darkness covering
[1:57:52] the face of the
[1:57:53] no land shown
[1:57:55] just water everywhere in the holy spirit
[1:57:57] hovering over and cooing after and
[1:57:59] drawing drawing
[1:58:01] oh i feel him
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:05] you couldn't have lived in an earth like
[1:58:06] that that earth was not inhabitable
[1:58:08] there was no land mass
[1:58:10] only darkness no light
[1:58:12] and if there was any light it was mixed
[1:58:14] the jewish people believed from the
[1:58:15] hebrew of that verse
[1:58:17] that in the beginning darkness and light
[1:58:19] was commingled in such a way that you
[1:58:21] couldn't see light but light was there
[1:58:22] all the time
[1:58:24] and in the hebrew when he calls let
[1:58:26] there be light the hebrew speaks of a
[1:58:29] separation that god was calling the
[1:58:31] light to come forward because god is
[1:58:33] light i don't know how it was i wasn't
[1:58:35] there
[1:58:36] but i know god drew the light out
[1:58:39] and it was good
[1:58:41] i know that he established he created it
[1:58:43] not in vain he formed it let's look at
[1:58:45] this in the amplified
[1:58:48] everybody's still here
[1:58:50] all right we're just getting ready to go
[1:58:51] into our number two in just a moment if
[1:58:53] you need a break take one
[1:58:54] isaiah 45 18 verse 18 in the amplified
[1:59:01] for thus says the lord
[1:59:04] who created the heavens
[1:59:06] god himself
[1:59:08] who formed the earth and made it
[1:59:10] who established it
[1:59:12] and did
[1:59:14] not
[1:59:15] create it
[1:59:16] to be
[1:59:17] a worthless
[1:59:19] waste
[1:59:20] there you go
[1:59:22] he formed it to be
[1:59:24] inhabited
[1:59:26] i am the lord
[1:59:28] and there is no one else so something
[1:59:31] happened
[1:59:33] now there are many people who believe
[1:59:35] who study the scripture who believe that
[1:59:37] peter
[1:59:39] was talking about
[1:59:41] this
[1:59:42] uh
[1:59:43] pre-or or
[1:59:45] a pre-adamic condition of the earth in
[1:59:48] ii peter there are some who believe that
[1:59:50] he was speaking about the flood in the
[1:59:53] days of noah but let's read it
[1:59:56] just for the record second peter 3
[1:59:59] verses 5 through 7
[2:00:02] there are many who study these things
[2:00:04] who believe that this was referring to
[2:00:06] the pre-adamic earth
[2:00:08] for if they willingly are ignorant of
[2:00:10] that word by the word of god
[2:00:13] the heavens were of old
[2:00:16] and the earth standing out of the water
[2:00:20] and in the water
[2:00:22] whereby the world
[2:00:24] that then was
[2:00:26] being overflowed with water
[2:00:28] perished
[2:00:30] but the heavens and the earth which are
[2:00:32] now
[2:00:33] by the same word are kept in store
[2:00:37] reserved unto fire against the day of
[2:00:40] judgment and perdition of ungodly men
[2:00:45] many scholars say that if this was not
[2:00:47] in in reference
[2:00:49] to the pre-adamic creation
[2:00:52] then it certainly could apply
[2:00:54] because the language in the greek is
[2:00:57] very carefully worded that makes it
[2:01:00] sound like more of a total annihilation
[2:01:04] than it does just the flooding of the
[2:01:07] earth nonetheless let's go to jeremiah 4
[2:01:10] quickly i pray that all of my scripture
[2:01:12] reading doesn't lose you i pray you'll
[2:01:15] stay with me because
[2:01:17] you say i thought you're going to tell
[2:01:18] me who i am i am
[2:01:20] i am going to tell you but but if you
[2:01:23] check out now if you leave us now you
[2:01:25] you won't you won't hear it
[2:01:27] jeremiah 4 23 and 27
[2:01:30] i behold the earth
[2:01:31] and lo it was without form and void and
[2:01:34] the heavens and they had no light
[2:01:37] i beheld the mountains and lo they
[2:01:39] trembled and all the hills moved lightly
[2:01:42] i beheld in low and there was no man
[2:01:45] and all the birds of the heavens were
[2:01:48] fled
[2:01:49] i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a
[2:01:52] wilderness and all the cities thereof
[2:01:56] were broken down at the presence of the
[2:01:59] lord and by his fierce anger did anyone
[2:02:03] hear the phrase all the cities
[2:02:11] and by his fierce anger
[2:02:15] for thus
[2:02:17] hath the lord said
[2:02:20] the whole land shall be desolate yet
[2:02:23] will i not make a full
[2:02:26] end
[2:02:27] now again here is jeremiah prophesying
[2:02:32] telling us of something that has already
[2:02:34] happened
[2:02:35] and there are many people who believe of
[2:02:37] course that he was referring to the
[2:02:40] flood but those who study the language
[2:02:43] deeply find out that the writing and the
[2:02:46] way that the sentences are structured it
[2:02:49] sounds like something older than noah's
[2:02:52] flood i'll let you decide i'll let you
[2:02:55] decide but i'm reading them because i
[2:02:57] think it's a good idea for you to be
[2:02:59] aware of the whole picture
[2:03:01] if this is a picture of what was then it
[2:03:04] is clear that in that original creation
[2:03:08] in the beginning god created the heavens
[2:03:10] and the earth in that original creation
[2:03:12] it's clear that it was inhabited
[2:03:18] by some kind of
[2:03:21] creation
[2:03:30] something human-like
[2:03:34] and that there were organized
[2:03:36] societies
[2:03:39] perhaps
[2:03:41] cities
[2:03:44] it baffles the mind of men
[2:03:48] i remember as a child in the holiness
[2:03:50] church
[2:03:52] the old preachers used to tell us
[2:03:53] dinosaurs didn't exist
[2:03:57] they preached it fervently it's a lie of
[2:03:59] the enemy it's it's an evolution lie it
[2:04:02] came from the pit of hell
[2:04:04] dinosaurs did not exist and all the
[2:04:06] people said amen
[2:04:10] then they start digging up these bones
[2:04:13] and the old preacher said they made them
[2:04:16] i'm not making fun
[2:04:19] brother we need we may not need that
[2:04:21] kind of preaching but we needed some of
[2:04:22] the preaching they did we need to hear
[2:04:25] some of what they had to say
[2:04:26] they could help us clean the church
[2:04:28] today couldn't they
[2:04:29] yeah they were preaching it all they
[2:04:30] knew all they knew they preached
[2:04:33] and they said oh no they said
[2:04:36] i don't believe adam wrote on the back
[2:04:38] of a dinosaur
[2:04:41] so he said they never existed well i
[2:04:43] want you to know they did clearly exist
[2:04:46] they're finding bones that no one has
[2:04:48] made and and i want you to allow me to
[2:04:51] present to you that it's my
[2:04:52] understanding of this study
[2:04:54] that these are some of the creatures
[2:04:56] that existed in the original earth as it
[2:04:59] was created before it was plunged into a
[2:05:02] chaotic condition
[2:05:04] so whatever lived whatever had society
[2:05:08] whatever formed cities
[2:05:11] they did it among these
[2:05:14] prehistoric creatures
[2:05:17] was it a million 30 million 50 billion i
[2:05:21] i i have no idea when it was
[2:05:24] the earth as we know it now is most
[2:05:27] likely slightly over 6 000 years old
[2:05:32] but that original earth
[2:05:35] and the gap between one and two
[2:05:38] we have no idea how long it was
[2:05:41] and we're not going to spend any time
[2:05:42] arguing or trying to figure it out
[2:05:46] i want to take you to ezekiel 28 for
[2:05:48] just a moment and i want you to stay
[2:05:49] with me
[2:05:51] i want you to see this creature i want
[2:05:53] you to hear this quickly
[2:05:54] i just wish there weren't so many verses
[2:05:56] to read but i want to read them because
[2:05:59] i want you to have reference if you need
[2:06:00] to go back to this later
[2:06:02] ezekiel 28 verse 11 moreover the word of
[2:06:05] the lord came unto me saying i'm going
[2:06:07] to verse all the way to verse 19. son of
[2:06:10] man take up a lamentation upon the king
[2:06:12] of tyre and say unto him thus saith the
[2:06:15] lord god thou seelest up the sum full of
[2:06:18] wisdom and perfect in beauty
[2:06:21] thou hast been in eden
[2:06:23] the garden of god
[2:06:25] every precious stone
[2:06:28] was thy covering
[2:06:33] i want you to know gaudy is not a new
[2:06:35] thing
[2:06:38] amen
[2:06:41] lucifer
[2:06:42] was a reflection
[2:06:45] of god's beauty
[2:06:47] for even in his covering
[2:06:49] the sardius topaz diamond barrel onyx
[2:06:53] jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle gold
[2:06:58] the workmanship of thy tabrets and of
[2:07:00] thy pipes
[2:07:02] was prepared in thee
[2:07:05] in the day
[2:07:07] that thou wast
[2:07:09] created
[2:07:10] that's your enemy
[2:07:13] it's your enemy he wasn't your enemy in
[2:07:14] that moment
[2:07:16] he was leading worship
[2:07:19] thou art the anointed cherub that
[2:07:22] covered we know this is not referring to
[2:07:24] an earthly king of tyre but an earthly
[2:07:26] king of tyre was being compared
[2:07:30] to this original cherub that covereth
[2:07:32] thou art the anointed cherub that
[2:07:34] covereth and i have set thee so that
[2:07:36] thou wasted upon the holy mountain of
[2:07:38] god thou hast walked up and down
[2:07:41] in the midst of the stones of fire
[2:07:44] thou was perfect in thy ways
[2:07:47] is anybody clear we're reading about the
[2:07:49] enemy
[2:07:50] in thy ways from the day that thou was
[2:07:52] created till iniquity
[2:07:55] was found in thee
[2:07:58] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[2:08:00] have filled the midst of thee with
[2:08:02] violence and thou has sinned and
[2:08:04] therefore i will cast the s profane out
[2:08:07] of the mountain of god i will destroy
[2:08:09] thee o covering cherub from the midst of
[2:08:12] the stones of fire
[2:08:14] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[2:08:16] beauty
[2:08:20] amen don't you try to tell me i'm
[2:08:22] supposed to call june
[2:08:24] pride month
[2:08:27] pride was the beginning of this problem
[2:08:31] pride is what was wrong with sodom and
[2:08:33] gomorrah in the first place it wasn't
[2:08:35] homosexuality first it was pride first
[2:08:40] that led to man worship and people
[2:08:43] worshiping their own body and their own
[2:08:45] image
[2:08:46] just like they do today
[2:08:48] so this is where it started this pride
[2:08:51] got in the heart lucifer was no longer
[2:08:53] my goodness he was the most beautiful
[2:08:55] thing that god created
[2:08:58] he had the most unique ability
[2:09:01] when he walked among the stones of fire
[2:09:03] his body sang praise
[2:09:07] can you imagine as he moved around the
[2:09:10] throne originally
[2:09:14] every part of his being was to the glory
[2:09:17] and the honor of god
[2:09:19] but one day he caught his reflection
[2:09:24] he caught his reflection
[2:09:26] he saw how beautiful he was
[2:09:29] and he went back to take another look
[2:09:30] and another look and another look and
[2:09:32] another look and another look at another
[2:09:34] look
[2:09:36] until finally he thought he was the most
[2:09:37] beautiful thing that there was and he
[2:09:39] was indeed that created to be such
[2:09:42] and he said i don't have to be the
[2:09:44] second man
[2:09:45] i don't have to be the third one in
[2:09:47] control i don't have to be somewhere
[2:09:48] down a long line of line of uh yes man
[2:09:51] no no no no no i i'm more beautiful than
[2:09:54] the rest of them
[2:09:56] he said uh he was he became corrupted
[2:09:59] thy heart was lifted up because of thy
[2:10:01] beauty thou has corrupted by thy wisdom
[2:10:04] by reason of thy brightness i will cast
[2:10:06] thee to the ground i will lay thee
[2:10:08] before kings that they may behold thee
[2:10:12] brother i'm living for that day
[2:10:14] revelation tells us the same scenario
[2:10:17] he's going to lay there and the kings of
[2:10:19] the earth are going to see his defeat
[2:10:22] all the eternals are going to see his
[2:10:25] defeat
[2:10:26] thou has to file thy sanctuaries
[2:10:29] by the multitude of thine iniquities by
[2:10:31] the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[2:10:33] will i bring forth a fire from the midst
[2:10:35] of thee it shall devour thee
[2:10:38] and i will bring thee to ashes upon the
[2:10:40] earth in the sight of all them that
[2:10:42] behold thee
[2:10:44] there's something you need to know
[2:10:46] if god didn't create it to be eternal
[2:10:51] if it was created
[2:10:53] with the absence of eternal life
[2:10:56] it cannot be eternal
[2:10:59] when the scripture talks about his utter
[2:11:01] destruction
[2:11:04] it means what it says
[2:11:06] the same bible says the soul that
[2:11:08] sinneth
[2:11:11] shall surely die
[2:11:13] hell is horrible place
[2:11:15] and it burns with the fire and at last
[2:11:18] we have no idea of knowing for how many
[2:11:20] millions or billions of years the
[2:11:22] torment might be
[2:11:24] but the flames are not the greatest part
[2:11:27] of of hell
[2:11:28] that is not the greatest torment we
[2:11:31] think it is
[2:11:33] because of how we feel about fire
[2:11:36] but the eternal part of the punishment
[2:11:38] is not the flame itself
[2:11:40] the most horrendous and eternal part of
[2:11:42] the punishment is eternal separation
[2:11:44] from the presence of god i want you to
[2:11:46] know even sinners can recognize the
[2:11:48] presence of god and that hour that hour
[2:11:52] that they no longer have any connection
[2:11:54] at all
[2:11:55] i spoke about those who move by music i
[2:11:58] want you to know that music is one of
[2:11:59] the ways that even sinners
[2:12:02] can connect to the presence of god but
[2:12:04] once you land in hell that that
[2:12:06] connection is over it's voided
[2:12:09] and you are eternally separated from the
[2:12:12] presence of god therefore the
[2:12:14] the punishment itself is an eternal
[2:12:17] doing
[2:12:19] but the created place
[2:12:22] it has a duration
[2:12:24] it has an expiration
[2:12:26] and so does your enemy now we're just
[2:12:28] preaching what the bible said
[2:12:30] you've got a problem with that i know
[2:12:32] your church don't teach it that way your
[2:12:33] preacher may not preach it that way i'm
[2:12:35] not here to do any of those those things
[2:12:37] i'm here to tell you what the bible's
[2:12:39] saying
[2:12:40] not church tradition what the bible said
[2:12:43] you don't want to go there
[2:12:44] you want to stay out of there
[2:12:46] one day your enemy has an end
[2:12:49] the only way something can live eternal
[2:12:54] is to have eternal life
[2:12:56] and lucifer doesn't have eternal life
[2:13:00] one of these days is going to burn up in
[2:13:02] his own wickedness
[2:13:03] yes the scripture said
[2:13:05] it shall devour there will be a fire
[2:13:08] being brought forth from the midst of
[2:13:10] thee it shall devour thee and i will
[2:13:14] bring thee to ashes upon the earth in
[2:13:17] the sight of all them that behold thee
[2:13:20] you just let the saints of god walk by
[2:13:25] you imagine that day
[2:13:28] when the saints of god will walk back to
[2:13:30] and fro and behold the pile of ashes
[2:13:34] anybody with me
[2:13:36] that used to be their arch enemy
[2:13:39] the one that used to give you the most
[2:13:40] trouble the one that used to torment
[2:13:42] your mind the one that tried to steal
[2:13:45] this from you and torment you and addict
[2:13:47] you and pull you here and pull you there
[2:13:50] and one day you'll walk past
[2:13:55] is this the pile of ashes
[2:13:58] that cause the nations to reel and rock
[2:14:05] is this the pile of ashes that destroyed
[2:14:08] churches
[2:14:10] that ruined nations
[2:14:15] no more
[2:14:16] no more
[2:14:18] god will ultimately deal with that devil
[2:14:21] your enemy
[2:14:23] and all they that know thee among the
[2:14:25] peoples shall be astonished at thee
[2:14:28] not because of your great glory anymore
[2:14:31] thou shalt be a terror and never shout
[2:14:34] thou be
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:43] nobody's with me
[2:14:46] nobody did not just read it out of the
[2:14:49] book
[2:14:50] does that not matter anymore
[2:14:53] matters
[2:14:54] now go to isaiah 14.
[2:14:57] by the time i get to my punch line
[2:14:59] you're going to be napping
[2:15:03] isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen
[2:15:06] from heaven
[2:15:08] oh lucifer
[2:15:10] sun in the morning
[2:15:12] how art thou cut down to the ground
[2:15:14] which did its weakened the nations
[2:15:16] for thou hast said in thine heart all
[2:15:18] the way to twenty for thou has said in
[2:15:19] thine heart i will ascend into heaven i
[2:15:22] will exalt my name above the stars of
[2:15:23] god i will sit also upon the mount of
[2:15:26] the congregation in the sides of the
[2:15:27] north i will ascend above the heights of
[2:15:30] the clouds i will be like the most high
[2:15:32] is anybody getting all those eyes
[2:15:37] you ever around anybody that talks like
[2:15:39] that
[2:15:43] i i i i i i i
[2:15:47] there's something wrong with that
[2:15:48] conversation
[2:15:51] i thought you'd help me a little better
[2:15:52] than that
[2:15:54] no i'm going to take a break let you
[2:15:55] think about it
[2:16:01] i will do this i will make my name i
[2:16:03] will i will ascend i will i will be like
[2:16:06] the most high god yet thou shall be
[2:16:08] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[2:16:10] pit
[2:16:11] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[2:16:13] upon thee and consider thee saying is
[2:16:16] this the man
[2:16:19] who
[2:16:20] is this the one that made the earth to
[2:16:22] tremble that did shake kingdoms
[2:16:25] anybody realizing what we're reading
[2:16:27] here that made the world as a wilderness
[2:16:29] and destroyed the cities thereof
[2:16:35] you see
[2:16:37] that open not the house of his prisoners
[2:16:40] all the kings of the nations even all of
[2:16:42] them lie in glory everyone in his own
[2:16:44] house
[2:16:45] but thou art cast out of thy grave like
[2:16:47] an abominable branch and as the ramen of
[2:16:50] those that are slain thrust through with
[2:16:51] a sword that go down to the stones of
[2:16:53] the pit as a carcass trodden underfoot
[2:16:55] my god my god he's going to deal with
[2:16:58] the enemy
[2:16:59] thou shalt not be joined with them in
[2:17:00] burial because those destroyed thy land
[2:17:03] and slain thy people the seed of evil
[2:17:04] doers shall never
[2:17:07] be renowned
[2:17:11] there'll be no memory
[2:17:14] there'll be no memory of them
[2:17:16] there'll be no memory of them do you
[2:17:17] understand
[2:17:19] i know these old songs tear jerking
[2:17:21] songs that have been written about
[2:17:23] getting to heaven and realizing your
[2:17:25] loved ones aren't there are you joking
[2:17:27] with me
[2:17:29] are you kidding with me

[2:17:33] circle that don't make it over there
[2:17:35] you'll never miss them
[2:17:39] i thought i'd give them more help with
[2:17:40] that you'll never miss them
[2:17:45] i can't imagine brothership you'll never
[2:17:47] know they existed
[2:17:49] amen
[2:17:50] what kind of heaven what kind of
[2:17:52] eternity would it be
[2:17:55] if every time you looked around and saw
[2:17:56] those you were familiar with realize
[2:17:58] mama wasn't there or daddy wasn't there
[2:18:01] or some of your maybe your husband
[2:18:02] wasn't there what kind of eternity would
[2:18:05] that be you'll never remember them
[2:18:07] anymore you'll never remember your enemy
[2:18:09] anymore you'll never remember those who
[2:18:11] persecuted you anymore you'll never
[2:18:13] remember their names are blotted out of
[2:18:15] the book of life it is as though they
[2:18:17] never existed
[2:18:19] in all of time and eternity you hear
[2:18:20] what i just said
[2:18:22] there is a book your name can never be
[2:18:24] blotted out of
[2:18:26] that is the lamb's book of lie
[2:18:29] but there is a book yes
[2:18:33] there is a book your name can be removed
[2:18:35] from
[2:18:36] and it is as though you never existed
[2:18:39] you have no memory there is no history
[2:18:42] of your birth it is though it is as
[2:18:44] though you never were and this is our
[2:18:46] enemy's destiny as well
[2:18:49] it's you the evildoers and the seed of
[2:18:51] the evil doers shall never be renowned
[2:18:53] let's read on thou shall not be joined
[2:18:56] excuse me is that it that's verse 20.
[2:18:58] all right great
[2:19:06] give me ephesians 6 12 in the amplified
[2:19:08] please you need to stand in stretch does
[2:19:11] anybody need a stretch break
[2:19:14] yes no
[2:19:16] maybe so
[2:19:18] aren't we used to being here at 112
[2:19:21] sam yes ma'am
[2:19:23] all right well we said but not when we
[2:19:25] have a a 12-hour wedding day
[2:19:30] that was yesterday that was yesterday
[2:19:33] it's a new day
[2:19:35] we made it here didn't we we got here
[2:19:38] didn't want to be anywhere else but here
[2:19:40] i didn't
[2:19:41] for we are not wrestling with flesh and
[2:19:43] blood contending only with physical
[2:19:45] opponents
[2:19:46] but against the deposit excuse me the
[2:19:48] devil
[2:19:49] i can't even see it
[2:19:51] despotism's against the powers
[2:19:54] against the master spirits who are
[2:19:57] the world rulers of this present
[2:19:59] darkness against the spirit forces of
[2:20:01] wickedness in the heavenly supernatural
[2:20:04] sphere we've got enemies
[2:20:07] we've got principalities and powers
[2:20:10] you believe that
[2:20:11] let me go and get this one in job 1
[2:20:13] 6-7 and you'll also read this in job 2-2
[2:20:17] because the common teaching of the
[2:20:19] church
[2:20:20] of yesteryear that was that's was this
[2:20:23] that satan
[2:20:24] was banished
[2:20:27] to hell
[2:20:30] i've heard great sermons about satan and
[2:20:34] how he's banished to hell and all of the
[2:20:36] demons were banished to hell but how
[2:20:39] many of you know that couldn't exactly
[2:20:41] be the reality of things
[2:20:44] because we're wrestling right now and
[2:20:46] fighting right now with principalities
[2:20:49] and powers and spirits of the air spirit
[2:20:52] spirits and in you know high wickedness
[2:20:55] and and heavenly supernatural spheres
[2:20:59] that that other realm that other
[2:21:02] dimension is is more real than the one
[2:21:05] we're living in right now
[2:21:07] job 1 6-7 said now there was a day when
[2:21:09] the sons of god came to present
[2:21:12] themselves before the lord
[2:21:14] and satan came
[2:21:16] also among them and the lord said unto
[2:21:19] satan which cometh thou
[2:21:21] then satan answered the lord and said
[2:21:23] from going to and fro in the earth and
[2:21:26] from walking up and down in it
[2:21:29] so i wanted to show you that satan was
[2:21:31] not banished to hell after he was thrown
[2:21:34] out no no he was not banished to hell he
[2:21:37] had access to continue to roam in fact
[2:21:39] we understand that he's built a throne
[2:21:41] in the second heaven
[2:21:44] he is the prince of what
[2:21:47] the power of the
[2:21:49] air
[2:21:50] he dwells just above the atmosphere of
[2:21:53] earth
[2:21:54] and that's why there's darkness there
[2:21:56] and if you don't believe that go to the
[2:21:57] book of daniel and you'll find out that
[2:22:00] daniel prayed a prayer in an angels
[2:22:02] breaking through
[2:22:04] but he has to come through that sphere
[2:22:06] of darkness
[2:22:07] he has to fight principalities and
[2:22:10] powers
[2:22:11] the bible said specifically he comes
[2:22:13] against the prince of persia and he
[2:22:15] would be a he would have been held up
[2:22:17] there indefinitely
[2:22:19] but michael
[2:22:21] [Music]
[2:22:23] a great warring angel came
[2:22:26] and escorted that angel kicked his
[2:22:29] enemies off and escorted that angel
[2:22:31] through the second heaven so that he
[2:22:33] could break through into the atmosphere
[2:22:34] of earth and stand there by daniel and
[2:22:36] giving the word of the lord your prayer
[2:22:38] was heard
[2:22:42] oh he don't hear me he don't hear me
[2:22:44] because he hadn't talked to me he heard
[2:22:46] you
[2:22:48] don't you get discouraged he heard you
[2:22:52] oh daniel your prayer was heard the
[2:22:56] moment you prayed it but i was delayed
[2:22:58] in getting the answer to you i had to
[2:23:00] fight the prince of persia where is he
[2:23:03] talking about he's talking about that
[2:23:04] spear that that uh place that we refer
[2:23:07] to as the second heaven remember the
[2:23:09] apostle said i knew a man and he was
[2:23:11] caught up where not to the second heaven
[2:23:14] but to the third heaven
[2:23:16] so that spiritual dimension of light
[2:23:19] that realm of god and that which is holy
[2:23:22] and
[2:23:23] spiritual is above the second heaven
[2:23:26] it's in the region we would call the
[2:23:27] third heaven and anytime a word is
[2:23:30] passed from here to there it has to go
[2:23:32] through the second heaven and anytime
[2:23:34] deliverance passes from there to here it
[2:23:37] has to go through the second heaven
[2:23:39] i want you to know it's the busiest
[2:23:41] dimension
[2:23:42] the busiest atmosphere
[2:23:44] and the busiest dimension is the one
[2:23:46] between here
[2:23:47] and the throne
[2:23:52] there's a lot of activity there
[2:23:54] you never give a praise you never
[2:23:57] offer a prayer you never make any move
[2:23:59] toward god reaching out for more
[2:24:01] deliverance
[2:24:02] that it doesn't cause a ripple through
[2:24:04] that atmosphere i'm telling you the
[2:24:06] enemy is watching you
[2:24:08] there's more than one eye watching you
[2:24:11] but the one that matters has got you on
[2:24:13] his radar too
[2:24:14] and he knows how to overcome all
[2:24:16] principalities and power
[2:24:18] amen are you still with me
[2:24:19] then i want to remind you of one verse
[2:24:21] and we're fixing to bring this home
[2:24:23] genesis 1 2. i want to i want to remind
[2:24:25] you of this one
[2:24:27] this is genesis 1 1 was in the beginning
[2:24:29] he created the heaven and earth now
[2:24:31] genesis 1 2 and the earth was without
[2:24:33] form what caused the earth to be without
[2:24:35] form it's what we read to you in isaiah
[2:24:37] and ezekiel
[2:24:38] it was satan deciding on lucifer we
[2:24:41] should call him this
[2:24:42] lucifer deciding i'm not no longer
[2:24:44] satisfied to dwell in this realm i'm
[2:24:47] exalting myself
[2:24:49] come on
[2:24:50] started working on the angels didn't he
[2:24:53] all right
[2:24:54] so then god said i'm taking this
[2:24:57] creation
[2:24:58] even as it is now
[2:25:00] and i'm putting it on the back burner
[2:25:03] just like a woman would be would be
[2:25:05] cooking something and getting a little
[2:25:06] fast and getting a little head of the
[2:25:08] rest of the meal
[2:25:09] and she would take that pot and put it
[2:25:11] back to another burner that's what god
[2:25:13] was doing he said i'm not done with this
[2:25:15] creation
[2:25:16] i'm not nearly finished with this how
[2:25:18] many of you know there was a plan of
[2:25:20] redemption that had to come forward
[2:25:22] but god had a reason for it all working
[2:25:24] this way
[2:25:25] he was not only populating the regions
[2:25:27] of light but populating the regions of
[2:25:29] the darkness
[2:25:30] and that's a subject for another time
[2:25:32] but god plunged the earth into chaos
[2:25:35] it went into darkness
[2:25:37] its form became formless
[2:25:41] its organization
[2:25:44] became
[2:25:45] chaos
[2:25:48] the earth was without form and void and
[2:25:50] darkness was upon the face of the deed
[2:25:51] but i want you to notice this
[2:25:53] and the spirit of god moved
[2:25:56] upon the face
[2:25:58] of the waters
[2:26:00] all that darkness all that chaos all
[2:26:02] that destruction underneath the water
[2:26:06] all that death
[2:26:07] underneath the water and what do you see
[2:26:10] you see the are you with me
[2:26:12] you see the gentle dove
[2:26:14] of the holy spirit
[2:26:16] i said are you with me
[2:26:21] he's just moving over the face
[2:26:24] of the waters all darkness
[2:26:26] the only light the only representation
[2:26:29] of good or god
[2:26:31] is that holy spirit
[2:26:33] brooding
[2:26:34] wooing
[2:26:35] cooing
[2:26:37] over the face
[2:26:39] of the waters would you give me the
[2:26:41] message what does it take to make a
[2:26:42] christian life
[2:26:46] i know they're visitors here
[2:26:48] i know we should call it short
[2:26:50] shorter for them
[2:26:52] but i'm not sure i can do that just now
[2:26:56] he said now i want you to notice in the
[2:26:57] beginning
[2:26:59] when god our father looked over this
[2:27:02] bleak earth
[2:27:04] and it wasn't nothing but one great big
[2:27:07] ball of water
[2:27:09] and god sent the holy spirit to the
[2:27:14] earth
[2:27:15] the logos
[2:27:17] that went out of god
[2:27:21] and what did it do
[2:27:23] it began to brood would you say the word
[2:27:25] brood with me brood
[2:27:27] have you ever used that word in your
[2:27:29] vocabulary
[2:27:32] my granny used to
[2:27:34] my granny used to use that word
[2:27:38] it refers we have it in the new
[2:27:39] testament
[2:27:41] jesus
[2:27:43] brooding
[2:27:44] he said how often i would have gathered
[2:27:46] you as a henwood or chicks but you would
[2:27:48] not
[2:27:49] you look at that in the original
[2:27:50] language it's talking about a hen
[2:27:52] brooding over her
[2:27:55] little ones
[2:27:56] i've heard my granny say don't mess with
[2:27:58] that hen
[2:28:01] she's got her brood underneath her
[2:28:04] her little hatchlings are there or she's
[2:28:06] brooding over her nest you leave her
[2:28:08] alone
[2:28:09] that's a mother guarding are you with me
[2:28:11] i'm going to say again are you with me
[2:28:15] i don't have time to tell this story but
[2:28:17] i'm telling it anyway
[2:28:19] brother r.c wetzel a great mentor and
[2:28:21] friend of mine
[2:28:23] who went to be with the lord now many
[2:28:24] years ago he told the story of being a
[2:28:26] child and the barn catching on fire
[2:28:29] remember me telling you
[2:28:30] and the barn caught on fire
[2:28:32] and the animals those that were able to
[2:28:34] get out survive but anything that wasn't
[2:28:36] able to get out of course it burned to
[2:28:38] the ground with the barn devastating to
[2:28:40] the family it was their livelihood it
[2:28:42] was their it was their winter feeding
[2:28:44] the food that would feed the animals in
[2:28:45] the winter was all lost in the barn it
[2:28:47] was a terrible terrible thing
[2:28:49] and when the when the fire had died down
[2:28:52] and the
[2:28:53] water was drying
[2:28:55] brother wetzel told the story of going
[2:28:56] out and he said the oddest thing i've
[2:28:58] ever seen in my life
[2:29:00] was laying right there in the doorway of
[2:29:03] the barn
[2:29:06] was a scorched hen
[2:29:10] no more than a pile of feathers
[2:29:14] and he said i thought to myself you dumb
[2:29:16] hen
[2:29:18] you dumb chicken
[2:29:20] why didn't you run a little
[2:29:22] farther
[2:29:24] why did you just lay down there and die
[2:29:28] he said i was just a boy and it just
[2:29:30] baffled me at the ignorance of that
[2:29:32] little bird
[2:29:34] if she'd had gone out a little further
[2:29:36] and beat her wings in the sand she might
[2:29:39] have been able to save her life
[2:29:42] but yet she just bowed down there in the
[2:29:44] doorway
[2:29:45] and died in the dirt
[2:29:47] he said i didn't really mean any
[2:29:49] disrespect
[2:29:50] but he said i just was so drawn to this
[2:29:53] picture he said i took the edge of my
[2:29:55] shoe
[2:29:56] and i kicked over the carcass of that
[2:29:58] little old mother hen and that old dried
[2:30:01] frame of bones and feathers rolled off
[2:30:04] and out from underneath her came a
[2:30:06] little brood of little chickens
[2:30:09] i must be getting old
[2:30:12] i must be getting old because that
[2:30:14] touches my
[2:30:16] heart i know old people love little baby
[2:30:19] animals i must be getting old
[2:30:22] i can see those little chickens
[2:30:25] running out from mama and he said oh my
[2:30:29] mama i'm so sorry i called you stupid
[2:30:36] i'm so sorry that i called you dumb
[2:30:40] i know exactly why you died right there
[2:30:44] you died gathering your little babies
[2:30:47] under your way you gave your life
[2:30:52] you're hearing me
[2:30:53] you gave your life for those little
[2:30:56] chickens there so i know what brooding
[2:30:58] means you're getting it now
[2:31:00] drawing and well here we go
[2:31:03] and god sent the holy spirit to the
[2:31:05] earth the logos that went out of god and
[2:31:09] it began to brood over the earth
[2:31:11] help me lord to hurry now
[2:31:13] now the word brood means
[2:31:15] to make love
[2:31:25] just like the dove
[2:31:27] to coo
[2:31:27] [Music]
[2:31:29] to call
[2:31:31] to draw
[2:31:33] are you here
[2:31:35] in the great holy spirit benjamin
[2:31:38] would you go and see if you can find a
[2:31:40] rag a towel anything my
[2:31:43] handkerchief is soaked through and
[2:31:46] i need something dry i'm wiping my sweat
[2:31:48] with a wet wet rag
[2:31:51] now the word brood means to make love or
[2:31:54] just like the dove to cool the great
[2:31:56] holy spirit over the earth is a mental
[2:31:58] picture we're going to make it like
[2:32:00] wings
[2:32:01] let's see it can you see it with me
[2:32:04] we're going to make the holy spirit like
[2:32:05] wing we're going to see him like a dove
[2:32:07] and we're going to see that great
[2:32:09] darkness far as you can see out there
[2:32:11] darkness darkness darkness and deep deep
[2:32:15] water nobody knows just how deep it is
[2:32:17] and underneath the surface of that water
[2:32:20] is whatever remains
[2:32:23] from god's original creation
[2:32:29] maybe down underneath that waters
[2:32:32] it's trees apple trees and
[2:32:34] peach trees and whatever i don't know
[2:32:36] what the original creation looked like i
[2:32:38] don't know what those societies look
[2:32:40] like
[2:32:42] i don't know what the greek i don't know
[2:32:44] but underneath there
[2:32:46] would be the big bodies of some
[2:32:48] dinosaurs or
[2:32:53] whatever was under there
[2:32:55] there's only one way it could have got
[2:32:56] there
[2:32:58] god had to create it
[2:33:00] and god created them the same way he
[2:33:02] creates now
[2:33:05] you're with me
[2:33:06] he doesn't create like a potter creates
[2:33:08] with his hands
[2:33:09] he creates like a creator creates he
[2:33:12] creates with his mouth i wish somebody
[2:33:14] was with me
[2:33:16] he creates with his mouth whatever was
[2:33:18] lying there underneath that water in
[2:33:20] that darkness in that chaos
[2:33:23] was what god had created with the power
[2:33:26] of the spoken word stay with me
[2:33:29] and whatever it was it was of such value
[2:33:31] to god
[2:33:33] that he sent the holy spirit to go down
[2:33:38] can you see it
[2:33:40] is that a dishcloth
[2:33:41] whatever we have thank you very much

[2:36:23] there
[2:36:24] began to come some petroleum
[2:36:27] moving across the earth
[2:36:30] and a little bit of this and that in a
[2:36:31] little easter lily comes up in the earth
[2:36:34] what brought it
[2:36:40] now what was the holy spirit brooding
[2:36:41] over
[2:36:42] the seed
[2:36:46] where did the seed come from
[2:36:52] the spoken word is the original seed
[2:36:56] everything that was in that original
[2:36:58] earth had come from the mouth of god
[2:37:01] so it was still lying under the surface
[2:37:04] of that dark water
[2:37:06] in seed form
[2:37:10] remember brother branham said every
[2:37:11] apple that's ever ever apple that's ever
[2:37:13] going to be in the earth was a part of
[2:37:14] that original creation he's not talking
[2:37:16] about adam's recreation he's talking
[2:37:19] about that original creation
[2:37:21] and the seed he said why in that little
[2:37:23] seed what's the potential of every other
[2:37:26] apple
[2:37:27] and every other tree
[2:37:30] and it lay there and it would have just
[2:37:31] drowned just lay there drowning
[2:37:33] had the holy spirit not come to brood
[2:37:35] over it and to woo it and call it forth
[2:37:38] and tell it what it was there for you're
[2:37:40] there you're there because you're part
[2:37:42] of the spoken creation of the father and

[2:37:47] little better good i'm wooing you i am
[2:37:50] calling you i am drawing you what was
[2:37:54] you drawing the seed
[2:37:56] what was he watching over his word
[2:38:04] [Music]
[2:38:09] he's jealous over his word
[2:38:12] glory be to god he wasn't even going to
[2:38:14] let satan destroy that
[2:38:16] i might let this thing slow down a
[2:38:18] little bit i may push the earth to the
[2:38:20] back burner a little bit i may slow this
[2:38:23] this whole process down a little bit but
[2:38:25] i'm not going to leave my word i'm not
[2:38:28] going to leave my seed unguarded under
[2:38:30] that dark water no no no no no i'll sin
[2:38:34] for my holy spirit
[2:38:36] [Applause]
[2:38:38] to make love over my word
[2:38:41] to coo and draw and brood
[2:38:47] over my word
[2:38:49] whoa
[2:38:51] come on
[2:38:52] come on
[2:38:54] let me hear you another minute
[2:38:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:38:59] [Applause]
[2:39:04] here come little easter lilia who
[2:39:06] brought it
[2:39:07] the holy spirit brooding
[2:39:12] then come along the dahlia
[2:39:15] the azalea
[2:39:16] [Music]
[2:39:18] oh i'm so glad he brought in southern
[2:39:20] vegetations
[2:39:25] do yankees even know what azaleas are
[2:39:28] i don't know i guess they do do you
[2:39:30] sister kathy did you know what the
[2:39:31] zeldas were
[2:39:33] ah but not like ours
[2:39:37] no
[2:39:39] they're not
[2:39:41] but all beautiful
[2:39:43] the azaleas and the other bushes begin
[2:39:46] they begin to draw up out of the hutaye
[2:39:51] they began to draw about
[2:39:53] the vegetation then came the vegetation
[2:39:56] the holy spirit's still brooding
[2:39:58] still calling the seeds of the original
[2:40:00] creation to come forth into
[2:40:02] manifestation i said still calling the
[2:40:05] seeds of the original creation that
[2:40:06] which came forth from the spoken mouth
[2:40:08] of god
[2:40:10] because the spoken word of god
[2:40:12] is the original seed
[2:40:14] somebody said what came first the
[2:40:16] chicken or the egg the chicken dummy
[2:40:19] because the chicken came forth from the
[2:40:21] spoken word of god and the seed was in
[2:40:23] her
[2:40:24] the egg was in there
[2:40:26] [Applause]
[2:40:29] somebody said what converts an apple
[2:40:30] seed or a tree with apple a tree with
[2:40:33] apples
[2:40:36] that's how it was in the original
[2:40:38] now we've just got what's left
[2:40:40] of that original creation notice god
[2:40:42] didn't call it all
[2:40:44] he didn't call the dinosaurs back
[2:40:47] he didn't call pre-adamic man or
[2:40:49] creature or beast or whatever it was he
[2:40:51] didn't call all that back
[2:40:53] although please remember i don't want to
[2:40:55] try to insert some strange doctrine here
[2:40:57] but please remember that there was an
[2:41:00] unusual creature in the garden
[2:41:03] that no one seemed to quite understand
[2:41:08] beast
[2:41:10] but very manlike
[2:41:16] just interesting to note
[2:41:18] some representation perhaps
[2:41:21] of some existence
[2:41:23] i know some of you are getting so
[2:41:25] nervous because you think you're you
[2:41:26] know this is some false doctrine or
[2:41:28] something we're removing oh no no no no
[2:41:31] no
[2:41:32] okay
[2:41:33] did i finish that
[2:41:34] no
[2:41:35] uh
[2:41:36] then the long came after the vegetation
[2:41:38] came the trees
[2:41:41] then the plant life
[2:41:46] let me just dry off the cord
[2:41:49] that's where we have our shorts and
[2:41:51] problems
[2:41:52] it's that cord in the back
[2:41:56] then after a while birds begin to fly
[2:41:58] from the dust of the earth
[2:42:00] the earth starts raising up
[2:42:05] dry land starts coming forth
[2:42:08] come on
[2:42:09] the holy spirit wooing these things
[2:42:12] begin to rise from the depths of the sea
[2:42:17] the birds begin to fly from the dust of
[2:42:19] the earth
[2:42:20] my wouldn't you have loved to have seen
[2:42:21] it
[2:42:23] the holy spirit brooding them together
[2:42:25] sent them into the air
[2:42:27] then along came the animal life
[2:42:30] the holy spirit brooding any animal that
[2:42:33] was in that original creation it came
[2:42:35] forth in the recreation
[2:42:37] now if you've got any problem with the
[2:42:39] fact that there was something living in
[2:42:41] the original earth
[2:42:42] you must also look at what god told adam
[2:42:45] when it come time to have babies
[2:42:48] he didn't say be fruitful and multiply
[2:42:50] and plenish the earth which would mean
[2:42:52] to fill it up
[2:42:53] he said be fruitful and multiply and
[2:42:55] what
[2:42:57] replenish repopulate refill the earth
[2:43:00] so something had already filled the
[2:43:02] earth
[2:43:03] anybody with me
[2:43:06] oh god he's a mastermind
[2:43:10] there's no mind like the mind of god
[2:43:15] he had all of this in his mind
[2:43:18] then along came the animal life the holy
[2:43:20] spirit brooding are you there
[2:43:23] so so let me ask you this question just
[2:43:25] what was the spirit of god doing as he
[2:43:27] moved over the surface of the water he
[2:43:29] was not only moving and brooding over
[2:43:31] the water it's clear that he was
[2:43:32] guarding something what could it be what
[2:43:35] was beneath the surface of the waters
[2:43:37] that god sent his own spirit to watch
[2:43:39] over for an undisclosed number of years
[2:43:42] we have no idea how long the spirit
[2:43:46] was guarding the seed
[2:43:48] we have no idea uh if i had time i don't
[2:43:51] have time i'll read it maybe later
[2:43:53] genesis 1 11 and 12 has a very similar
[2:43:56] uh oh let me read it come on folks
[2:44:00] and god said in the amplified let the
[2:44:02] earth put forth tender vegetation plants
[2:44:05] yielding seed and fruit trees there's
[2:44:07] your dahlias your azaleas and all this
[2:44:09] this plant life just like the prophet
[2:44:12] was preaching it
[2:44:13] and fruit trees yielding fruit whose
[2:44:15] seed is in itself
[2:44:18] here come a tree
[2:44:21] that unless it had seed in it it would
[2:44:23] die out
[2:44:24] but when god put the tree there he put
[2:44:26] all the seed in it so that it could
[2:44:28] reproduce itself
[2:44:30] spoken word is the
[2:44:32] let's see that again spoken word is
[2:44:37] oh my goodness i love this book
[2:44:40] this is life
[2:44:42] the seed is in itself each according to
[2:44:44] its kind upon the earth and it was so
[2:44:46] the earth brought forth vegetation
[2:44:47] plants yielding seeds
[2:44:49] seed according to their own kinds and
[2:44:51] tree trees bearing fruit in which was
[2:44:54] their seed
[2:44:56] each according to its kind and god saw
[2:44:58] that it was good suitable admirable and
[2:45:01] he approved it
[2:45:02] can i go to the fourth seal lord have
[2:45:04] mercy how will i stop
[2:45:07] 92
[2:45:08] paragraph 92 of the fourth seal i was
[2:45:11] talking to a person not long ago i was
[2:45:13] trying to discuss this is the clinker if
[2:45:15] any of you needed to hear it in the in
[2:45:17] the prophet's message here's the clinker
[2:45:18] are you ready to write this down
[2:45:20] you can write this address down this is
[2:45:22] in the message the fourth seal march the
[2:45:24] 21st 1963 in the grand city of
[2:45:27] jeffersonville
[2:45:28] and i'm doing that because this is a
[2:45:30] quote that i lose sometime i have to
[2:45:31] call brother greeley to find it for me
[2:45:33] again
[2:45:34] but i've put it in my notes here i think
[2:45:35] this is the one
[2:45:37] yeah this is the one
[2:45:39] now i lose it sometimes so i don't want
[2:45:40] you to lose it i may need to call you
[2:45:42] sometime and you remind me where it is
[2:45:44] i was talking to a person not long ago
[2:45:47] was trying to discuss with me and saying
[2:45:49] aren't you ashamed to say that god
[2:45:50] created the heavens and earth in three
[2:45:52] days or in six days i said that that's
[2:45:55] what the bible said
[2:45:57] all right let's go on
[2:45:59] said well we got evidence and can prove
[2:46:01] that the world is millions of years old
[2:46:03] i said that didn't have anything to do
[2:46:06] with it
[2:46:10] now my that's a scientific answer
[2:46:12] is that that didn't have anything to do
[2:46:13] with it
[2:46:16] he said in genesis 1 1 this is the
[2:46:18] prophet talking back to this gentleman
[2:46:20] he's speaking with he said in genesis 1
[2:46:21] 1 it said in the beginning god created
[2:46:24] the heavens and earth
[2:46:28] help me
[2:46:29] all you students of the message what
[2:46:31] said next period
[2:46:36] i'm not sure brother brandon believed
[2:46:38] things like period
[2:46:41] i'm not the only one who believes the
[2:46:43] gap theory
[2:46:45] period
[2:46:47] he said that's all see now the world was
[2:46:50] out form and void
[2:46:57] and i said
[2:46:59] i believe every seed was laying right
[2:47:03] there
[2:47:04] from some other civilization
[2:47:08] or something
[2:47:10] and as soon as the water lifted off and
[2:47:13] the light struck it
[2:47:15] up come the trees
[2:47:20] and everything
[2:47:23] isn't that good
[2:47:25] and the same thing with the human being
[2:47:27] is a type
[2:47:30] when all the mist had moved away and the
[2:47:33] revealed truth
[2:47:35] to that real seed laying there
[2:47:39] it's still
[2:47:41] germatized
[2:47:42] that's me he's talking about
[2:47:45] and the light of the gospel can strike
[2:47:48] it by true vindication
[2:47:51] of the word
[2:47:53] it'll live
[2:47:58] hallelujah
[2:47:59] [Applause]
[2:48:01] it doesn't matter what age you came in
[2:48:05] all it takes
[2:48:06] is for the light
[2:48:08] to strike the seed
[2:48:11] he said it's got life in it i'll believe
[2:48:14] it'll believe it'll believe outside of
[2:48:17] that it can't live
[2:48:18] it hasn't got no
[2:48:20] life in it so how many of you can at
[2:48:23] least say you hear brother venom saying
[2:48:26] that underneath that water
[2:48:28] let's go back and look at that part
[2:48:29] again
[2:48:31] i believe every seed was laying right
[2:48:33] there from some other civilization or
[2:48:34] something and as soon as the water
[2:48:36] lifted the spirit of god been guarding
[2:48:38] it all this time
[2:48:39] wooing
[2:48:40] brooding calling to it
[2:48:42] and when that light begin to shine
[2:48:45] it draws up
[2:48:48] oh
[2:48:49] my gosh
[2:48:52] let's praise god in here come on let's
[2:48:54] praise him
[2:48:59] [Applause]

[2:50:12] accordance
[2:50:27] come on come on
[2:50:32] is this the same bible they use over
[2:50:34] there is this the same bible
[2:50:38] how do people miss it
[2:50:41] according as he hath chosen us in him
[2:50:45] how do people miss that how does the
[2:50:47] church miss that how do denominations
[2:50:49] miss this
[2:50:51] it's it's like your nose on your face
[2:50:54] playing
[2:50:55] according as he had chosen us in him
[2:50:57] before the foundation of the world
[2:51:02] you didn't just get to be his
[2:51:05] you were his in his mind
[2:51:10] before the foundation of the world
[2:51:15] you know i used to pastor one of those
[2:51:17] pentecostal denominational churches
[2:51:19] right down the road there in phoenix
[2:51:20] city
[2:51:22] and i got called into conference one
[2:51:23] time for using that word predestination
[2:51:25] right there in the king james version of
[2:51:27] the new testament
[2:51:29] years ago i was 16 years old
[2:51:34] and i'm called on the spot for using a
[2:51:35] bible word and they said we don't like
[2:51:36] to use that word predestination
[2:51:39] and i said well what have you got
[2:51:40] against the word well it just causes
[2:51:42] people to believe all kinds you know
[2:51:43] there's that that thin line between
[2:51:45] hyper calvinism and calvinism and we're
[2:51:47] just you know that's not how we like to
[2:51:49] look at it we want to emphasize your
[2:51:50] choice we want people to make sure they
[2:51:52] understand that they have a choice and i
[2:51:53] said do you if you just read this
[2:51:55] carefully you'll find out that everyone
[2:51:57] has a choice
[2:51:58] but a big old sovereign god knew my
[2:52:00] choice before i made it
[2:52:02] he knew exactly what i was going to say
[2:52:05] he knew my yes hallelujah let me tell
[2:52:08] you church he knew your yes
[2:52:13] he didn't force you to say yes
[2:52:17] he knew your yes
[2:52:19] and because of your yes
[2:52:22] he chose you
[2:52:24] he elected you he predestinated you
[2:52:27] we were chosen in him before the
[2:52:29] foundation of the world that we should
[2:52:31] be holy and without blame and before him
[2:52:33] in love can i tell you that before
[2:52:35] genesis 1 1
[2:52:37] you were already chosen in christ
[2:52:40] that's the foundation of the world
[2:52:42] genesis 1 1.
[2:52:44] there it is that's where it's talked
[2:52:45] about before genesis 1 1 having
[2:52:48] predestinated us
[2:52:51] prefixed our destiny
[2:52:54] unto the adoption of children
[2:52:56] by jesus christ to himself according to
[2:53:00] the good pleasure of his will
[2:53:02] my this is a long service
[2:53:04] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[2:53:07] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[2:53:09] beloved lord of mercy you know how i
[2:53:11] love to preach on that verse
[2:53:14] oh i just want god to accept me
[2:53:22] i just wanna know that he loves me
[2:53:30] what's the word say
[2:53:32] give me the verse
[2:53:34] go back
[2:53:37] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[2:53:42] there's no praise for you
[2:53:45] you're wonderful
[2:53:47] but we're not praising you because you
[2:53:49] serve god
[2:53:50] it's the glory of his grace
[2:53:53] if anybody's serving him it's the glory
[2:53:55] of his grace
[2:53:56] wherein he hath done what
[2:53:59] made us
[2:54:01] anybody still with me made us
[2:54:04] made us accepted in the beloved
[2:54:09] you can quit your whining and wipe in
[2:54:11] your snout
[2:54:15] if the word if that seed was laying in
[2:54:17] you and the light is shine and quicken
[2:54:20] that word seed in you brother sister he
[2:54:22] has already accepted you
[2:54:25] hallelujah you're not waiting to be
[2:54:27] accepted he has already accepted you
[2:54:32] let's read on
[2:54:35] in whom we have redemption
[2:54:38] through the blood through his blood the
[2:54:40] forgiveness of sins according to the
[2:54:43] riches of his grace
[2:54:45] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[2:54:47] all wisdom and prudence
[2:54:49] having it made known having made known
[2:54:51] unto us the mystery of his will
[2:54:52] according to his good pleasure which he
[2:54:55] hath purposed in himself that in the
[2:54:58] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[2:55:00] might gather together in one all things
[2:55:03] in christ both which are in heaven and
[2:55:06] which are on the earth even in him
[2:55:09] beautiful in whom also we have obtained
[2:55:12] an inheritance
[2:55:14] being predestinated according to the
[2:55:15] purpose of him who worketh all things
[2:55:18] after the council of his own will
[2:55:21] the devil can't kill you
[2:55:23] god's got his own will in place
[2:55:27] that we should be to the praise of his
[2:55:29] glory who first trusted in christ isn't
[2:55:32] that a beautiful word
[2:55:34] isn't that a beautiful word
[2:55:36] i want to i want to ask you a question
[2:55:38] how did you get here
[2:55:48] your mama and your daddy came together
[2:55:49] in a sexual union
[2:55:52] your mom provided an egg your father
[2:55:55] provided what the what the greek word is
[2:55:57] sperma
[2:55:58] which is life or seed
[2:56:01] your father provided that and that seed
[2:56:04] fertilized that egg
[2:56:06] and an embryo was formed
[2:56:09] and that
[2:56:10] child carries dna and
[2:56:13] and it carries the stamp of both mother
[2:56:16] and father
[2:56:17] and we can't hardly wait for it to get
[2:56:19] here for us to see who
[2:56:21] it looks like
[2:56:23] is it gonna have daddy's ears is it
[2:56:25] gonna have mama's big nose is it gonna
[2:56:28] have
[2:56:30] whose disposition is it gonna have and
[2:56:32] everybody praise mamas please
[2:56:37] but there's something in you that your
[2:56:39] mama and your daddy
[2:56:42] didn't give you
[2:56:46] sex has never produced a human spirit
[2:56:51] can't do it
[2:56:53] no mom and daddy coming together in a
[2:56:55] physical union has ever produced a human
[2:56:57] spirit in your heart can't happen
[2:57:00] it happens for you just like it happened
[2:57:02] for adam
[2:57:04] unless god places a spirit in you
[2:57:11] so there is something about you
[2:57:13] that mama had nothing to do with and
[2:57:15] daddy had nothing to do with now i want
[2:57:16] to ask you how it got there
[2:57:21] without that spirit coming in without
[2:57:23] that breath coming in without that life
[2:57:25] coming in
[2:57:27] there's no soul
[2:57:33] somebody said what in the world are you
[2:57:34] saying exactly what the bible said and
[2:57:36] god breathed breath on him and man into
[2:57:39] him into his nostrils and man became
[2:57:41] what
[2:57:42] without a spirit without human breath or
[2:57:45] god breath without life coming in a gift
[2:57:48] of god then there's no soul created to
[2:57:51] connect you with both spirit and
[2:57:53] environment
[2:57:55] something has to stand between the
[2:57:56] spirit part of you and the flesh part of
[2:57:59] you
[2:58:01] and that's the human soul
[2:58:06] that creature whatever it was in the
[2:58:08] garden of eden that looked so much like
[2:58:10] a man that it that the enemy could press
[2:58:12] himself that satan could press himself
[2:58:15] into and use that
[2:58:17] it was absent of something important it
[2:58:20] had no soul
[2:58:22] it was created of god it had life but
[2:58:25] not god's breath
[2:58:28] so it had no soul
[2:58:31] very interesting isn't it
[2:58:33] now i want you to know that in order for
[2:58:36] you to have life
[2:58:38] it has to be given to you by god
[2:58:42] and it's hideous as miscarriage is as
[2:58:45] horrible as painful
[2:58:48] as heart wrenching as it can be
[2:58:51] god is a sovereign god
[2:58:55] there is no accident in him
[2:58:59] you may never know until you stand in
[2:59:01] the presence of god
[2:59:04] why that had to happen that way
[2:59:07] my sympathy my compassion my heart is
[2:59:10] with you
[2:59:11] but unless god should give that little
[2:59:13] baby spirit life
[2:59:17] then it is
[2:59:18] a body
[2:59:20] is that correct
[2:59:22] now
[2:59:23] that means that somebody had to make a
[2:59:26] decision
[2:59:28] of what went into your physical form as
[2:59:31] you were forming there in your in your
[2:59:33] mother's womb
[2:59:35] and i happen to believe that that part
[2:59:37] of who you are could have been expressed
[2:59:39] in any other age
[2:59:43] and i happen to believe that who you
[2:59:45] really are was hand-picked by god
[2:59:49] and placed in your body
[2:59:51] powerful
[2:59:52] the bible said god places the solitaire
[2:59:55] in families
[2:59:57] you are not born into the wrong family
[3:00:00] you may feel like the oddball or the odd
[3:00:03] bird or the black sheep or the stray cat
[3:00:06] or whatever you feel like but you're you
[3:00:08] were born into that family for a reason
[3:00:10] sometime only one chosen for the work of
[3:00:13] god only one chosen for eternal life
[3:00:16] and in other situations god raises up
[3:00:18] one solitaire in a family to be a light
[3:00:24] to be both encouragement and judgment
[3:00:28] to a family
[3:00:29] in that grace it's grace it's
[3:00:31] sovereignty it's a it's a powerful thing
[3:00:34] so i want you to know that makes you
[3:00:37] uh here expressed in this hour
[3:00:41] given to that little body forming in
[3:00:44] your mother's womb for a divine purpose
[3:00:48] and that seed that god gave you he
[3:00:50] placed that in you that seed is a part
[3:00:54] of him
[3:00:55] are you hearing what i'm saying
[3:00:58] that seed is an expression of his word
[3:01:01] and it is a part of who he is and what
[3:01:04] it did we say about the original seed
[3:01:06] the the spoken word is the original seed
[3:01:10] so there's a part of you there's a part
[3:01:12] of you right now there's a part of you
[3:01:14] here right now that came from the mouth
[3:01:16] of a living god
[3:01:18] do you know what that makes you it makes
[3:01:20] you a seed of god and where did the seed
[3:01:23] come from in the beginning
[3:01:29] musicians coming
[3:01:32] i want you to know why you came you came
[3:01:35] because you were spoken
[3:01:39] somebody said what i am what am i what
[3:01:41] am i what am i you're a word
[3:01:45] brother branham gives us a definition of
[3:01:47] a word he said a word
[3:01:50] is a thought
[3:01:52] expressed
[3:01:54] where did the bible say we originated
[3:01:57] help me now come on now this is what i
[3:01:59] don't want you to do
[3:02:01] we're really coming to the end i promise
[3:02:04] i do i do we're coming to the end
[3:02:06] but i don't want you to miss this in the
[3:02:08] end
[3:02:09] this is what we've been working toward
[3:02:11] so don't miss this
[3:02:13] sweet folks precious brothers and
[3:02:15] sisters don't miss this now
[3:02:17] i want you to be able to hear this
[3:02:22] a word is a thought expressed
[3:02:24] the bible tells us and the message is
[3:02:27] clear we existed in the mind of god as a
[3:02:29] thought
[3:02:31] chosen in him
[3:02:33] before the foundation of the world so
[3:02:35] you were first a thought i want you to
[3:02:37] look at your neighbor and say i was
[3:02:39] first a thought
[3:02:41] wasn't your daddy's thought
[3:02:43] wasn't your mama's thought you were
[3:02:45] first in the mind of god you were first
[3:02:47] a thought in the mind of god say it
[3:02:48] again
[3:02:52] do you know what you're saying
[3:02:55] it's a powerful thing to say it i was
[3:02:58] first a thought
[3:03:00] in the mind of god
[3:03:01] well i'm no longer just a thought
[3:03:05] i found a body god placed that seed that
[3:03:07] thought in a body i'm there he put me in
[3:03:09] he put me the real me in a body
[3:03:14] he chose a little body that was forming
[3:03:16] in the in the womb of a of a margaret
[3:03:18] jane shelley
[3:03:21] because of the contribution of a of a
[3:03:24] ralph shelley
[3:03:27] a little body forming there and god
[3:03:29] chose this is the time
[3:03:31] he's sovereign he can do it this is a
[3:03:33] time
[3:03:35] that stephen lamar shelley
[3:03:37] is going to be expressed in the earth so
[3:03:40] this is the body that i've chosen to put
[3:03:42] him in
[3:03:43] and he places me there and in that
[3:03:45] moment when i become a demonstration of
[3:03:47] god when i become reality and no longer
[3:03:51] just a thought of god the only way that
[3:03:53] transference can take place is i'm
[3:03:54] spoken there
[3:03:56] anybody with me so in that moment i
[3:03:58] became more than just the thought of god
[3:04:01] are you with me
[3:04:02] i became a word
[3:04:04] i want you to look at your neighbor and
[3:04:05] say i i was first a thought of god
[3:04:09] but i'm expressed i've been born i'm now
[3:04:12] in the earth tell them tell them tell
[3:04:13] them i know you feel silly tell them
[3:04:15] anyway
[3:04:16] and so now i'm not just a thought
[3:04:19] i am now a word
[3:04:22] i am now a word
[3:04:24] i am now a word
[3:04:26] you remember how jealous god was yes
[3:04:30] you remember how jealous god was
[3:04:32] over his word
[3:04:34] that he sent the holy ghost to woo over
[3:04:36] the darkness
[3:04:38] you remember how jealous he was over the
[3:04:41] original seed
[3:04:43] that came from the original creation
[3:04:46] he's just that jealous over you
[3:04:48] somebody ought to help me now he's just
[3:04:50] that jealous over you

[3:05:32] i want you to tell me what you were in
[3:05:34] the beginning
[3:05:35] and who you are now i was a thought
[3:05:38] in the mind of god are you just
[3:05:40] repeating that because i said it no sir
[3:05:43] okay
[3:05:44] i was a thought you were the mind of god
[3:05:46] in eternity past he thought about you he
[3:05:49] knew you
[3:05:50] he knew your mom and dad he knew your
[3:05:52] siblings he knew where they would live
[3:05:54] he knew the church your dad would pastor
[3:05:56] he knew the wife you would marry he knew
[3:05:58] the two children you would have he knew
[3:06:00] the grand babies that would follow you
[3:06:01] were all of that all of that
[3:06:04] was in his mind yes
[3:06:06] and because of i was a thought in his
[3:06:08] mind
[3:06:10] the lamb was slain from before the
[3:06:12] foundation of the world for you for me
[3:06:15] that's it so that i could become a word
[3:06:18] sent from god sent from god power
[3:06:20] manifested in the earth powerful and and
[3:06:22] and what was it making that that holy
[3:06:25] ghost brood over the water like that why
[3:06:28] did that take place what was going on
[3:06:29] there because there was seed seed
[3:06:32] in the water where'd that seed start
[3:06:35] from the mind of god
[3:06:37] then it became the word then it was
[3:06:39] spoken to spoken into the earth and even
[3:06:41] though lucifer had that great rebellion
[3:06:43] and a synonym and god plunged the earth
[3:06:45] into darkness and chaos and water it
[3:06:47] didn't change the fact that was still
[3:06:48] his word it was still his word was still
[3:06:50] laying under the water right yes so the
[3:06:52] holy spirit was brooding now all your
[3:06:54] life that's what was happening to you
[3:06:58] every party if you went to any parties i
[3:07:00] don't know your personal testimony very
[3:07:02] few
[3:07:03] you went to parties very few very few
[3:07:06] he was raised in a preacher's family and
[3:07:08] had his own conversion
[3:07:09] but every party you went to
[3:07:12] every every every shot you took
[3:07:16] that kind
[3:07:17] that kind too never took he was with you
[3:07:21] he saw it all he knew it all
[3:07:23] yeah knew all of still loved you he sure
[3:07:25] did couldn't divorce you
[3:07:28] couldn't couldn't cast you off
[3:07:30] couldn't get rid of you
[3:07:32] because you originated in his mind
[3:07:34] hallelujah all right you became word do
[3:07:37] you want to add anything
[3:07:40] are you the only one is brother greedy
[3:07:41] the only one in here that understands

[3:07:53] i know
[3:07:54] that before the foundation of the world
[3:07:57] my name was in the lamb's book of life
[3:07:59] it was it was brother it was how did it
[3:08:01] get there by his thoughts he thought you
[3:08:03] first and he wrote it down yes sir
[3:08:05] that's right that's all that matters
[3:08:07] that's all that matters to me too
[3:08:10] lord okay you started out as a thought
[3:08:13] that was way way back in eternity past
[3:08:15] these four generate before genesis 1 1
[3:08:18] before genesis 1 1 that's exactly right
[3:08:21] and then and then how many years ago has
[3:08:24] it been since you were born
[3:08:26] 27 27 years ago
[3:08:29] god expressed you as as always has
[3:08:32] thought but he expressed you into the
[3:08:34] earth yes sir placed who you really are
[3:08:37] in that little body that was forming in
[3:08:39] your mother's belly is that right i
[3:08:41] already knew that he already knew you
[3:08:43] already knew all right so that makes you

[3:11:04] in my life
[3:11:06] i want to stand and be all that you
[3:11:08] created me to be and purpose me to be
[3:11:11] so
[3:11:12] shall my
[3:11:14] word be
[3:11:16] that goeth forth out of my
[3:11:20] mouth let's stop a moment
[3:11:25] what was laying underneath that water
[3:11:28] the word
[3:11:30] seed
[3:11:32] from the word
[3:11:34] that had gone forth from his mouth how
[3:11:36] did it become a word it was once a
[3:11:38] thought
[3:11:40] when that thought became expressed then
[3:11:42] it became a word
[3:11:44] god spoke that word into the original
[3:11:46] creation
[3:11:48] and even though lucifer had rebelled
[3:11:51] and a great gap took place in the verses
[3:11:54] and everything was covered beneath the
[3:11:55] water
[3:11:57] and it's just laying there
[3:11:59] the great dove
[3:12:02] the precious dove is cooing calling to
[3:12:05] the seed
[3:12:07] guarding and protecting the seed
[3:12:15] with cocaine in your nose
[3:12:23] you could have left this earth
[3:12:26] with venereal disease in your body
[3:12:30] you could have left this earth
[3:12:32] there are testimonies in this room
[3:12:38] sleeping with so many you couldn't keep
[3:12:40] up with their names
[3:12:42] you could have left this earth
[3:12:47] strung out out of your mind you could
[3:12:49] have left this earth but god but god but
[3:12:52] god
[3:12:53] you weren't pleasing him
[3:12:55] you weren't pleasing him but you were
[3:12:57] still his thought
[3:13:00] you were pleasing him but you were still
[3:13:02] the expression of his word
[3:13:04] even living a dirty no good rotten sorry
[3:13:07] sinful life
[3:13:09] you still belong to him
[3:13:11] and he'd already given you a prefix
[3:13:13] destiny you were just living it just
[3:13:15] walking it out because redemption was
[3:13:17] coming i want you to know redemption was
[3:13:19] coming how many of you have come to find
[3:13:21] out redemption was coming your way
[3:13:23] hallelujah
[3:13:27] and if god would not let one seed here's
[3:13:29] the point if god would not let one seed
[3:13:33] be wasted
[3:13:35] one word of his mouth
[3:13:37] not wasted but the holy spirit wooing
[3:13:40] over all of it god guarding all that if
[3:13:42] god did that over the seat of an apple
[3:13:44] tree or a blade of grass or an azalea
[3:13:47] bush how much more has the holy ghost
[3:13:51] guarded your life and wooed over you and
[3:13:56] and protected you and cooed to you and
[3:13:58] called to you and even made love over
[3:14:01] your life
[3:14:02] when you thought it was ruins and no
[3:14:05] good and nothing good will ever come out
[3:14:07] of me and all that stuff
[3:14:09] let's finish it so shall my word be
[3:14:14] that goethe forth out of my mouth
[3:14:17] it shall not return unto me void
[3:14:20] but it shall oh my god here we talk
[3:14:26] shall not pass away jesus said
[3:14:28] now the prophet isaiah said it shall not
[3:14:31] return unto me void
[3:14:35] i didn't speak it to be void i didn't
[3:14:37] speak it to be dark i didn't speak it to
[3:14:39] be chaotic
[3:14:41] i spoke it to be complete and perfect
[3:14:43] but something changed a little bit
[3:14:45] something shifted a little bit and the
[3:14:47] earth went into darkness
[3:14:51] you didn't come here to be a sinner
[3:14:53] you didn't come here to live the life
[3:14:55] you lived
[3:14:56] you didn't come here to do the things
[3:14:58] you've done no no you didn't come here
[3:15:00] for that purpose
[3:15:02] but god allowed it
[3:15:04] oh yes but he didn't let you go out
[3:15:06] there by yourself
[3:15:07] [Music]
[3:15:10] amen
[3:15:11] you may not believe this kind of
[3:15:13] preaching but he sat with you on the bar
[3:15:15] stool
[3:15:16] somebody said i don't believe jesus to
[3:15:17] go nowhere like that i'm thank god that
[3:15:19] he does
[3:15:21] i thank god that he does
[3:15:25] he stood there in the waiting room of
[3:15:26] the abortion clinic
[3:15:30] he followed you
[3:15:32] he watched over you
[3:15:34] you're driving drunk out of your mind
[3:15:37] you could have easily gone out of this
[3:15:39] world
[3:15:40] some of you had to pay a price for your
[3:15:42] sin some of you had some hardship and
[3:15:44] some twisting and some broken bones and
[3:15:48] and you had to learn some lessons
[3:15:51] but oh how he watched over you in sin
[3:15:54] how he protected you even in sin how he
[3:15:56] wouldn't let you go too far even in sin
[3:15:59] because you were his thought you were
[3:16:01] his word
[3:16:04] and this is how he feels he's jealous
[3:16:05] about his word so shall my word be that
[3:16:08] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[3:16:10] return unto me void but it shall
[3:16:12] accomplish
