TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] podcast I'm Joshua Shelley and I am super excited about this uh it has something that has been in my heart for a long time to do and I'm super excited to start this off I took the idea to Hawk a couple weeks ago and told him that what I wanted to do with it and of course he jumped right on board I feel like this is a great way to get to so many different people young people and old people because I feel like everyone right now listens to podcasts and I think this is going to be something really big for us my goal is just to be able to interview different people in our church and hopefully some people from other churches if we can get them in different pastors and speakers to tell their stories their testimonies and their experiences and like I said I'm just super thrilled about this um I told Hawk that the first person of course I wanted to interview was not only my pastor Stephen Shelley but my dad there are so many different experiences that he has had through the years since he was a little child and I actually read a book um write the vision for the first time all the way through last night and found out so much more about it there was times where I was in tears and there was times where I was laughing and I'm just thrilled to be able to sit down with them and talk about all these experiences and different things uh there's so many that we're going to be able to go over and I can't wait so welcome to the podcast I'm happy to start this with you thank you so much Joshua I'm very excited I'm feeling a little bit emotional uh with your introduction there um that you finally read write the vision my testimony book that's going all over the world in the in the past uh nearly 30 years I'm very glad you finally got around to reading it I did uh Hawk told me it would be a good idea to go through that and to read it to find different questions and be able to find different things about you and so that's what I did and I was super super glad that I did because it has helped me a lot well I'm excited about the podcast I I have not been a big podcast listener I've listened to a few especially during covid I listened to some um but I know that it is appealing especially when when it's conversational and so I'm very excited that you have a burden to do this and I'm behind you 100 percent and I'm honored to be your first guest well I'm excited I think it really just started because like I listen to tons of podcasts all my friends listen to podcasts and I was like this would be such a good way not only to get to young people but also older people right and be able to share some really good experiences and talk about the Lord right well I love stories true stories true experiences about the Lord and I know that there will be many in our church and many of our speakers that come through that will enjoy sharing and there's not a lot of podcasts that are just focused around the message and the truth that's true that's true that's true the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what the message is yes sir um I guess we're going to Jump Right In I want to talk to you about the first experience you had when you were I believe 18 months old that's correct and I think we're just going to go from there what what was to just explain to me that experience and what that was about before I do that I want to say just a few things to you and and to everyone watching or listening to the podcast um I want to first of all say that as I share my experiences I do not feel that I am a special person or that I have some special office to fulfill I do believe that all of us have a special role and a special a special place in the kingdom of God I believe that God has called you to do things that he hasn't called me to do and so I don't want to deny the calling but I don't want it to come across in the course of our time together as though I'm trying to elevate myself I struggle and I've always struggled because before I was born there were prophetic words spoken to my family that I would have a gifted life and that I would see visions and that I would hear from the Lord and that there would be experiences that would mark my life and I'm very thankful I want you to know and I want the listener to know that I am humbled and thankful and grateful to God that he would have called me uh but it has not been an easy calling because it's so misunderstood and if you share the things that God says or that you see he allows you to see uh sometimes it comes across to people as though you're trying to say I'm way up here and everybody else is and you know that's just not it at all I want you to know that and I want everyone uh joining us today to know that I wanted to read a scripture about experiences and then I will indeed go right where you asked me to go but in the Old Testament the prophet Joel prophesied in Joel chapter 2 verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions so Joel was prophesying of an end time move of God we know that that end time move of God started in Acts chapter 2 when when the church was birthed but I personally do not believe that it is over in fact I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ has some of our best days just ahead and when I say just ahead I don't mean decades ahead I mean now in Acts 2 17 Peter quotes the prophecy that Joel gave and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughter shall prophesy your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams almost verbatim and Peter's message to those who were gathered that day was this is that this is that which the prophet Joel prophesied about and so I just want to say that I want to balance my perspective by saying um I don't I don't share what I share for someone to be in awe of my life but I share it because I want you to know that the promise is upon All Flesh it is God's desire to fill us with the Holy Ghost and to move Among Us with signs and wonders with dreams and Visions confirmations and vindications before I was born my mother was not a Believer my mother was raised in a in a nice home a beautiful family her father was retired military officer her mother was a housewife and a mom and my mother was the baby girl uh two older brothers and she was sort of spoiled that was her testimony anyway my mother was a beautiful young woman she was very popular in school and she met my father who was a handsome young man but they absolutely came from two incredibly different worlds uh she came from a little bit of affluence and um you know this military kind of background uh Baptist church on occasion and my father came from a Holy Roller family when he was 16 years old he was filled with the spirit of God and received a call to Ministry and the Lord spoke to him at a youth camp I believe it was in Forsyth Georgia which is not too far from here the Lord spoke through a servant of God and and told him that his desire for his life was that he would serve him in Ministry unfortunately my dad never never completely yielded to that call he got mixed in with the wrong crowd he was very talented musician and I didn't know that until last night I was reading the book and it said he got caught up in one of the services that he took mall to and they asked him to play the piano and Ma got scared and was saying when you say mo you mean my mother your your grandmother and she got scared I was like you're not going to leave me are you and I didn't know he played the piano or anything I actually forgot that that was even yeah yeah but she was eventually invited I don't think he told her from the start you know that his mother was an evangelist and that his family traveled all over the southern part of the United States and also the Eastern Seaboard preaching and singing and uh you know I mean everybody's proud of their family but I when I tell you that my dad could play the piano I'm telling you he he really played he was in in those years he was often compared to Jimmy Swaggart and Mickey Gilley and and Jerry Lee Lewis um but that pull of that music you know uh it it got out that he was very talented and and so it wasn't just church it was it was the the Moose Club and the Elk Lodge and the Shriners and the different societies uh my grandfather was uh was a supervisor in a cotton meal and they wanted my dad to come and play the piano and this grieved my grandmother because she knew that the gift that God had given him was for God it was to be used in the service of the Lord but anyway yes he he did eventually get my mother to a service and there was a local family I don't know if I would have called the name or not but they were they were very Pentecostal people stensons was their name they were singers and I think a lot of them are passed on but they got up and they began to sing and my my mom there were not me I don't think they were they might not have even been married yet if they were they had just been married newly married and uh so people began to shout and and they begin to speak in tongues and my mother literally had never been in a service like that in her life people were talking in tongues and running the aisles and and and women were shouting their hairpins out and my mother was terrified she told me I was holding on to the seat for dear life and [Music] um they they eventually I don't think she knew what was going to happen but my dad knew uh that that the Shelley family was going to be called to sing and so she grabbed a hold of my my dad whose name was Ralph and she said you are not leaving me you are not leaving me here but you know he had no choice they were called to to sing and anyway she made it through but she told some amazing Stories uh and and yeah she had some good stories you know many years later she also uh surrendered her life to the Lord and was baptized with the Holy Ghost but anyway in some of those Services there were prophetic people that God would speak to that he would show Visions just like Joel said just like Peter said in the book of Acts and but my mother was never regular to church um not not to the Pentecostal Church and so uh one Saturday night in the church that my grandmother was uh was pastoring at the time which in fact is really the church that we're in now um because I came my grandmother stepped aside as Pastor when she realized that that was not God's perfect will for her life according to the word she very soon after that was taken from us and I was voted in as Pastor so technically this nhrm is the church that was so was it always New Hope it was always New Hope it used to be called New Hope assembly prayer Center okay and uh many years ago the name was changed to New Hope Revival Center but prayer has still been an important part of what we do I know I'm going all the way around the world to tell this story so just interrupt me whenever whenever you need to but um anyway the church let me just tell you a little bit about the church the church itself started because my grandmother had a burden and her heart for North Columbus and North Columbus in those days I'll tell you the year was 1968 it was the year I was born that my grandmother heard the call to open a church a really she was told to open a prayer Center and that's why it was initially called New Hope assembly prayer Center she was told to assemble a prayer Center so it was called New Hope assembly prayer Center and it was in North Columbus and she was with a major Pentecostal denomination at that time she was ordained with a with a large Pentecostal denomination so she went to her denomination and she asked for permission to open a Mission Church in North Columbus which at the time was was a poor part of town now if you because you work in the public in in the rain gutter business with brother Greeley you know that North Columbus now is a very affluent part of Columbus part of Muskogee County the wealthier homes are there but in those days it was a lot of shanties and Shacks and the the denomination didn't want her to do it maybe because she was a woman but now they had ordained her to preach uh uh or maybe they didn't feel like I don't know what it was but it wounded her it really really hurt her hurt her because she had a great reputation uh uh in in this in the city for for praying for people and then being healed and so she thought that that the denomination would be right behind her well anyway they were not and her nephew Johnny Walker anybody watches this saying here's it my my no might have known Johnny he's been gone for years he was a preacher talented musician here in the area he went out and with his cousin James Williams I think and they found an old building on the side of the road Hamilton Road in Columbus that was initially used as a honky tonk really and if you're watching this overseas and you don't know what a honky tonk is it's it's worse than a bar okay it's a bar is is much classier than what we're thinking when we think of honky tonk we're talking about roof well it was called Mary's Place and it's because it was run by a woman who had one leg and uh she sat behind a Podium with a a shotgun and I've had many people tell me that they partied at Mary's place so this is this has been confirmed many times through the years um and she if if anybody got to causing too much Ruckus she'd just pull that shotgun out and shoot right through the roof I never knew that yeah Mary's place and I have a picture of the building in my office and and so my grandmother they took my granny and said well here this is only place well the problem is it had been a vacant for years all the windows busted out of it in fact Joshua this is just gross but uh it was being used as a as an outhouse the back part of of the of what would be the church building eventually the back part where the fellowship was uh there was a door that came in out of the woods and there were people living in shanties up in the woods coming into this building which was nicer than what they were living in and using it for an outhouse wow and so when my grandmother said yes that's it that's the building uh they it took a month to clean it up and they use shovels and they cleaned up human waste they cleaned up blood from the from the fights at Mary's place they replaced all the window panes and they called a prayer meeting and that's how our church started it started with prayer meetings and we're talking about a church that was heated with with uh pot-bellied hot uh hot excuse me pot-bellied uh wood stoves and they did get hot uh and it eventually in the first year or so had outhouses but but they were able to add Plumbing to it uh a couple years after the church started about about 69 or 70 they added indoor plumbing and my granny began to have services on Tuesday night so that it wouldn't affect the other churches and Saturday night because none of the churches were having church on Saturday night and then she and a few of the the locals would come on Sunday morning and have a service well in one of those Saturday night services the Holy Ghost fell and there were several women and men who prophesied and uh I believe it was a sister who went over to my grandmother and laid hands on her head and said to her the Lord would say unto you that the the child your daughter-in-law is carrying right now is chosen and I'm going to use him uh for the ministry and it went on uh one of the things that were spoken was that I would win more souls have more miracles than even my grandmother had seen in her in her days of being which is probably a lot it a lot you know I mean she's like from the corner of the book she traveled and like you said she traveled around maybe you'll maybe you'll have me back on sometime and I can tell big mama stories because uh you know how God used her was profound and and I said to you just before the podcast started when we were just chatting I I told you that when you were with my grandmother you knew you were with a great person not just not just a grandmother or or a sweet lady but you knew that you were in the presence of someone who had known who had really known the Lord and she did she certainly did and and so the prophecy went on well my mother wasn't a wasn't there she wasn't even a believer yet this prophecy said now my father I told you he had had a call he he he rejected the call could it be I don't know son I don't know I don't have the scripture could it be that because he refused the call it fell on me and and I'm now carrying the ministry that would have been his I kind of like to think that but I don't know if that's true or not I know God never makes a mistake I know that and I wish that my dad would have went on to yield to his to his call but he did not and so my grandmother was thrilled I mean she she told my mother she said Jane I don't know how you're going to feel about this because my mother she would not hesitate to tell you that that my granny was a Holy Roller that's what they called called them Holy Rollers and and in those days people would say they tell tales about Holy Rollers they'd say that they've put itching powder on people when they come for prayer and that's what made them respond the way they did you know they'd get excited and they said that was itching powder and they would tell that the Holy Rollers were swinging from the chandeliers well there were no chandeliers they were just naked light bulbs hanging down out of the ceiling and so people didn't understand Pentecost even in 1968 when I was born there were still people who did not understand Pentecost now I want to tell you and I really am going to share about the experience uh I want to tell you that I feel so blessed son because the Pentecostal church had um grown in the in the nation and it had it had got a little more popular and as it got popular uh the power of God seemed to begin to to dwindle a little bit as the people put more emphasis on patting the Pew and a stained glass windows and and fancier buildings and more programs the power of God seemed to dwindle but my grandmother wouldn't let that happen she was determined through prayer to to to maintain an atmosphere where people could be healed and delivered and set free and so I I come along now in a few years in the story and I saw demons cast out and the dead raised and when I tell you that I have seen Blind Eyes Open by the power of Jesus Christ I'm telling you the whole truth and nothing but the truth I've seen deaf ears unstopped and I've watched death mutes speak their first words because of the power of Jesus Christ and so my grandmother wanted to kind of keep that kind of an atmosphere and although she was doing God a service without being in his perfect will she did everything she knew to do and I'll tell you sometime how she even came to do that what happened in in her life that caused her to even pray that prayer and begin to do but so my mother heard heard this prophecy and my dad heard it and my dad had no problem believing it but my mother didn't know what to think about it and so the first time I had a spiritual experience I have never talked about the detail every little detail of that experience and as far as I know I've never really shared what was spoken to me but I will tell you this I was 18 months old and I was standing in my baby bed and somebody said well I don't believe that you can uh you know remember when you were 18 months old I I do I have memories of laying in the crib and looking up at the ceiling when I was younger than that Vivid memories I can describe right now my bedroom when I was a baby I know the furniture and and so I guess maybe part of the gift was a memory like that but I tell people you don't encounter God Supernatural God and and not remember it I don't care if you're 81 or 18 months old it's kind of hard to forget I think you're going to remember that and so I know again that it it confuses some people but let me tell you this Joshua I'm not here today and when I stand in that Pulpit up there I'm not up there either to convince anybody that what I have seen is real I can't do that I cannot make you believe that I saw anything or that I heard anything I can't make you believe that but that's not really my job my job is to testify to be a witness of what I've seen and what I've heard and what I know but it's up to you just like it is your siblings just like it is to every person connected to this podcast today they have to make up their own mind of whether these things are real and I'm I'm I'm telling you they're real he's so profoundly visited me in my in my baby bed standing up I was already I was already escaping my baby bed at 18 months old and um and getting into things I wasn't two years old and we took a family trip to Miami my my dad worked for the airlines and we took a trip to Miami and I distinctly remember not quite two but almost two crawling out of the bed that they are maybe like a playpen type thing they had for me there going into the bathroom crawling into the tub opening up the ice chest and eating almost a half of a summer sausage that was about that big now I remember doing that you say well you remember your your parents telling you I do I remember them telling me about it but I have memory of how hard it was to get over into that bathtub and get that thing open and eat almost half of a summer sausage they said that was about that long so I I was you know I was moving differently and already already you know uh walking around I walked before 12 months about 10 months is when I started walking so anyway my next experience if you want to hear about that that was 18 months there was one in the book about when you were like three years old is that the one you're going to yep yep my next experience changed my life forever I am here today because of what happened to me when I was three years old and next well tomorrow uh is is we're in the month of April soon and April 28th is my birthday I'll be 55 so that's been a long time ago since I was three 52 years but I remember it well we were living on Emerson Avenue in Columbus my parents I didn't know it at the time but my parents were already having problems and they divorced they divorced when I was five but I was three now and I can describe the the bedroom to you there was linoleum on the floor that sticky kind of linoleum you know that when you walk across it barefooted your feet stick to it there was a yellow ugly oval yellow shag looking rug with a fringe around it in the middle of the room I had a twin bed at the time I think I had Mickey Mouse uh bedspread and curtains and pillows I had a Mickey Mouse record player in the corner and uh I had a section in the corner of toys that I would later play church with uh and a small piano was given to me there was something that was funny in the book uh uh your granny had told I think it was a congregation or somebody she said uh Steve's got the most Sanctified teddy bears uh there is yeah because after this happened when I was three from that moment on I called myself a preacher that's right yeah I said she said that uh I was asleep one night on my stomach in the bed and something woke me up I heard something moving in the room I very slowly raised my head up and turned my shoulder in the in the bed and looked at the door because the noise was coming from the door and hovering above the floor several feet above the floor I saw the image of the Lord Jesus Christ uh it was so profound did you know right away that that's what it was I I I don't know exactly at what moment it hit me that that's who it was maybe maybe first my thought was an angel but it was it was it was soon it was uh uh not long that I realized if not immediately that it was the Lord Jesus Christ and it scared me nearly to death I can remember the feeling of the of the spit drying up in my mouth and my tongue feeling like it was it was swelling I was so afraid and I immediately turned my head back over and buried my face in the pillow now Joshua I heard the Lord when he landed I hate to say it that way when he touched the floor I heard the Lord touch down and I heard his sticky footprints as he walked across the floor through the years people have said well that couldn't have been a vision had to be more like a visitation because it was physical in the sense that I physically heard sticky feet step step step step across the floor and here's the thing that that's so vivid In My Memory when he got to the rug I knew it because I didn't hear the sticky Footprints anymore and then all of a sudden he stepped off the rug because the rug was in the middle of the room he stepped off the rug and brother when I knew he was almost to my bed I was shaking the whole bed was shaking now that's the truth and Joshua you know again you you can believe it the viewer the Lister can believe it or not believe it it's totally up to you but he touched me on the back of my neck and when he did he didn't have to say I believe he said first do not be afraid but he didn't have to say that because the minute I felt his hand on the back of my neck my fear subsided I was no longer afraid and I he could have carried me anywhere I would have gone with him that's the truth because I I was at perfect peace now I turned all the way over and looked looked up into his face that was brilliant uh lovely brilliant light coming off of his face I saw enough of the details to know that it was the Lord and but there was such a light coming from him and and almost like a Mist coming off of him and he sat down on the bed and he never took his hand off of me the whole time first it was the back of my neck and then it was my shoulder and then then my near my the top of my wrist while he was talking to me now my eyes were glued on him but there was no fear and he told me many things I don't know how long he was with me but he told me many things many of which I told my mother the next morning what was her reaction to that she did not know what to do with it she did not know what to do with it I'll tell you how that happened in a minute he told me that I would preach the gospel he told me that there would be Miracles with signs and wonders he told me that he would give me a people to lead well I now know that that's what I do as a pastor but I didn't know that then I'll give you a people to lead he he told me that my life would be hard and that it would be so hard that there would be people who would come to me through the years and say your testimony has helped me so much because if God particularly young people if God can help you through those difficult times I know he can get me through mine and that has happened just like God said it I mean just like Jesus spoke to me that that night it has happened that way he also told me that my parents were going to divorce and he told me that my life would be lonely but that he would always be with me did you tell did you tell your mother I did you told her that can you imagine looking at your young beautiful mother as a as a three or oh I mean as a fight just just just three years old and telling her that Jesus has appeared to you and that your he told you that your mommy and daddy were going to be divorced how did she take she sobbed she cried because she she knew that you know I probably had a good imagination I I don't know she never you know mentioned to me that I did but but she knew this wasn't me I I know in my heart and we have video somewhere of mother telling this uh or uh referring to it at one of my preaching anniversaries and uh she will I I think in that in that little talk she told that there were no words to describe what it felt like uh she didn't know what to do with it or what to think about it but she knew that I had not lied she knew that I had not told a lie and so so my life that from that moment was set on a on a on a course that I'm still on to this day so I never dreamed about being anything but what Jesus told me I was going to be a preacher and from that moment is that when you believe you were called to preach I believe that was my calling and there are strategically I'm leaving some things out but he said some things to me in that in that visitation I'm going to call it what I believe it was he said some things to me in that visitation again I know that in the days we're living in in social media Etc that I'm giving people an opportunity to to call it baloney and and to say whatever they want to say uh but I'm going to leave that with them uh there has to be something to it because I never ever dreamed desired wanted to be anything or to do anything else I wasn't looking for a meal ticket I wasn't looking to be paid I wasn't looking for a career in Ministry I was only Desiring to do to be obedient to what he had called me to do and again my mother was shook I didn't even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I didn't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost until I was seven years old and we're going to talk about that because that was in the book and I thought that was a pretty neat experience as well so when when uh when I turned five my mother's father I remember it vividly his name was Edwin Lamar Ellis and I'm named after him my name is Stephen Lamar uh he had heart trouble he had been when I was a little boy to uh Walter Reed hospital and had open heart surgery and had done very well for a few years we had gone to Panama City for a little family vacation we had gotten back that night my grandparents had gone into their apartment mother and I had gone because my dad was already gone I should have finished that but my dad was had already left yes he wasn't living with us at the time they were not divorced but he wasn't living with us at the time and I I can tell you right now I can relive the moment in the middle of the night about 2 A.M when the phone rang and my mother screamed the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard as she was hearing the news that her dad had died on the way to the hospital she loved him so much he was so strong and he had been so supportive of her with my dad leaving and just being Mom and I he was gone before we could ever get to the hospital he was DOA Dead on Arrival at the hospital shortly thereafter my dad came to tell my mother that he did not love her anymore and that they were going to be divorced now I was shattered even though even though I had this warning I was still shattered I didn't I didn't see my dad a whole lot he worked a lot and he hunted a lot and and I know hunting is important to certain people but it sure it sure took my dad away from me on on days that were important to a child my birthday Christmas Thanksgiving it sure took my dad away from me he was obsessed and I remember uh I remember the day Joshua that he came and told my mother then he asked to speak to me he sat me down on the bench of the picnic table and told me that he didn't love my mother anymore he still cared about me were his words I don't know if he used the word love but he still cared about me and that he uh but he had to go and I remember holding on to his leg and not letting him go I remember him walking up the driveway to his car and me still holding on step stepping on his foot and holding onto his leg and I remember that last moment it must have been difficult for him I'm not I'm not in any way trying to to to say that it wasn't painful for him but I remember the moment that he reached down and pushed me off of his leg and shut the door now that that's a pretty vivid rejection but even that it certainly affected my life but even that did not pull me off the course I knew that I was bound to serve the Lord I knew I was my mother remarried she married an abusive man he beat her multiple times put her in the hospital multiple times and life was hard and my mother would grab me up in the night and run with me and I remember her panting so loud from the from the blood loss hiding in the bushes I can show you the spot right now in Columbus the bushes that we were hiding in and when he found us and I remember thinking in my heart oh I have oh mother please don't be so loud but she was panting for breath from the beating and running and he heard her and you know drug us back into the house and and and there were many times I I saw him stand in the hallway of my room going into my room my mother against the wall and him put his back against the wall and take his feet and the full force of his feet uh pin my mother to the wall and kick her in the stomach multiple times me screaming at the top of my lungs and I saw my mother uh you know beat with a diamond ring and uh even her mother picked up and thrown across the living room floor because of anger and so times were hard and it was difficult he moved us away to an island off the coast of Georgia I was not allowed to go to church uh I don't know if he thought I would tell somebody what was going on this was her second husband I don't know why but I wasn't allowed to go to church and uh you know it just it's I'm almost reliving some of it now talking about it but but it was horrible and and I really feared when I knew that she was off work and he was off work and I was at school I really feared at times that I would come home and find her dead God's grace and mercy kept that from happening uh uh my dog was killed in an episode and it seemed at that time that I felt like everything I had ever loved was was destroyed uh by this bad relationship and yet there was something about that man that I couldn't hate uh because I I felt like he also had missed a call he had missed something in his life to serve the Lord and and so I couldn't hate him even though he was crazy and so abusive and one day Joshua my mother just before I was seven my mother come home from the bank and she said we're going to grab what we can and in the morning we're going to leave well I was I was elated I was so happy I thought oh I get to go home I get to be around my grandmother's especially my grandmother who went to church and and uh the Pentecostal Church and and I thought my life would just you know this this is a dream come true and the next morning we got what little bit we could I remember that I had just gotten a birthday present of a of a of a magic set and uh just a big box of little tricks that you could do for your friends and I you know maybe I wouldn't have even given that to my children but it was given to me and I liked it so much enjoyed it so much I remember a little tray that you could stick a coin in and and and make the coin disappear in the little slot in the tray you know that kind of thing it was it all all had a a trick behind it but I wasn't able my mother wouldn't let me take that because the box was so big so I remember leaving things behind I remember having to leave my Nerf ball behind because there wasn't enough room to get everything we needed necessities we left that morning we made it to McDonald's on the outskirts of Brunswick Georgia and my mother was very solemn we sat there eating the the breakfast the Egg McMuffin and my mother was so solemn and I said mother I'm so thankful I'm so glad to be going home I'm so thankful to be going home and and for you to be safe and out of this and uh I mean I'm was five but but you know I would think bright for my age that sounds pretty bragging doesn't it but uh I had a better grip on life than than than most five-year-olds I've been through enough at that point and I'm so excited and my mother said Steve I have to tell you something and I said what is it and she said I've decided to go back to Jerry that was his name and and I said mother if I can't go to church if I can't serve the Lord see even though I didn't have the Holy Ghost I'd had those two main spiritual encounters with the Lord and I had been in a few Services my grandmother said that when I preached my first sermon I had only been to church with her about a half a dozen times so so I had only been to church you know about six times but that presence son that presence of God that was in that church the peace that was in that church these were old hard Mill workers ladies that would come in with cotton batting in their hair where they had just got off work in the cotton meal and come to church still unpresentable you would think by today's standard many many men would go in that bath back bathroom of the old church and wash their faces and wash their hands their hands black where they had worked on those looms and just got off work and come to church and had to clean up in the bathroom at the church so they could come in service but do you think they would have missed the service those people wouldn't have missed a service for any reason they were so sincere and I longed to be in that presence and to feel what I felt when I was those few times with my with my granny praying around the altars we had a lot of God Encounters in my grandmother's home but I long to be in church and I said mother if I can't go to church I want to die I want to die I'm going to pray and ask Jesus to let me die I have nothing to live for if I can't be in church and serve God now what what means as a five-year-old boy that's got to be a pretty what made a five-year-old say that my experience with him that's how it really was you can say what you want to but you would never ever be able to convince me it wasn't real it didn't happen and and I just sobbed I mean I lay my head over on the on the table and I just sobbed and my mother didn't know what to say because she had a soul tie with this man who beat nearly beat the life out of her she was connected in a sick sick way and she couldn't get free and she didn't know what to say so we got in the vehicle and I thought we were heading back to the apartment for him to meet us there after work I thought we were going back and I remember thinking well I'll have my toys I'll have my you know I'll have my things and all of a sudden I looked up and read the sign and realized that we were not going back to Brunswick we were on our way to Columbus so I had not seen my grandmother in in but once in a couple of years now your dad's mom my dad's mom and and my mom's mom they flew me home one time but because my dad had had was working at Delta and and could and and they had us had a a caretaker whatever somebody watching over me help me I flew home One Time by myself at four years old nearly five can you imagine you couldn't do that today no I wouldn't want to I wouldn't I wouldn't have let you all do it and and visited with my family but but I was so glad I was so glad to see my Baptist granny my mother's mother and my Pentecostal granny my dad's mother and and the promise of being in service and uh do you want me to tell you about the Holy Ghost not or do you want to are you talking about when when God yes because that's a pretty cool story in my opinion because you're on your way to church and you told your granny that you weren't the Holy Ghost and she said do you want more than a new bike and you and in the book you said I thought about it for a minute and I said I sure do I was still five and then you said well actually I was seven by this time and then she said well do you want it more than a new pony and yeah and and uh but make sure when you tell the story tell the part about your grandfather too about how he thought there was something wrong with you okay all right I will um yeah I was I was just about to be seven or right at seven now we had been home a little while mother had gotten her job back at the bank and life was pretty good and I I've never told you this but uh in those two years there was a time uh we lived with her mother for a while my grandmother uh and then we bought them we we rented an apartment and she come and live with us so it was my mother and I and my and her mother my grandmother uh Miss Ellis and there was one time in that two-year period that Jerry came looking for us and took my mother off come there I I think I may be the one to open the door and I nearly passed out a knock come on the door of the apartment I opened the door and there he stood and and I have to tell you like I said I didn't hate him in fact I loved him I I guess that sounds crazy but I did I loved him I wasn't glad to see him because I knew that he was going to be on his best behavior he was going to promise my mother the world and you said that in the book you said before they even got married that he was the sweetest he treated her and it was almost like the dad that you never had he was a little younger a few years younger than than she was I don't remember how many years but he was good to us and and uh you know he would take me to the park and we flew Kites and really for a short period of time six months or so uh you know he did things with me that a dad would do with their son and and so this change this real real a person that that came out his anger uh sits I've never seen anybody since with this kind of anger uh in that moment it's only the grace of God I know that he didn't kill my mother or me because he was so angry he did not beat me by the way uh which is really kind of a miracle because I jumped on him you know maybe this isn't the place to talk about that but I mean I jumped on his back more than one time beating him in the head with both fists to try to get him to move the butcher knife from my mother's neck and so he could have easily uh hurt me but for some reason he didn't well he come there to the door in that two-year period from five to seven I don't remember exactly when it was and I asked my mother to go off and my my grandmother her little short mother said Jane you're crazy I'd never heard her talk to my mom like that you are crazy what you've been through I wouldn't drink a milkshake with that man but she went out on a date and uh and she told us before she left that she was thinking about uh going back to live with him and I told her then I'll never go with you I'll never go with you I'll stay with my memo we'll go somewhere we'll do whatever we have to do but I'll never go with you and I remember this she went out on that date she was going three or four hours my I remember getting down by my bed and praying and calling on the Lord and I remember my little Baptist granny coming down that long hallway to my bedroom in the apartment and standing there and praying with me and her I could see her chin quivering as she was so broken and we cried out for my mother's soul and for her life and when she come home that night what kind of time did you have had a had a wonderful time but I'm I'm I need to tell you all I'm not going back I'm not going back to him God had heard our prayer and she never did now uh so we our life settled down a little bit after that we were living in Columbus I was in school I was in a gifted program in school that was really challenging my my brain power and and I was feeling good and I was able to go to church and uh sometimes I to the Pentecostal church not to the Baptist Church the problem was if my mother was mad at me or if I did something wrong the way she punished me was not letting me go to church and and I don't know but that doesn't seem like the right way to punish a child that wants to go to church but but she it's all she could use on me because there's something you cared about that was all she could use on me because I didn't care anything about sports I didn't care anything about anything else except school and church I lived for it I loved school and lived for church well anyway you're right we're driving on the way to church that night again a Saturday night and my grandma I told my grandmother I want to be filled with a Holy Ghost I said to her big mama I don't think the Lord must want me to have the Holy Ghost she about wrecked the car she put that big old arm across the seat and and she said what do you mean he don't want you to have the Holy Ghost I tell you right now he does and she said here's the question it's you it's not him she didn't like it that I was insinuating that the Lord didn't want me to have it she knew where the problem was it was with me and she said uh if you do you want the Holy Ghost more than a new bicycle I had to think about it I had an old beat up raggedy bike and uh because mother was Raising Me On One income and uh yes ma'am I want it more than I want a new bike a new pony and she listed several things but I did because I wanted more of whatever that was I had experienced when I met the Lord at three I wanted more of it and uh I invited the Lord really I mean I I feel like that I feel like the experience that I had of of 18 months old I really believe that's between that and and and having the visitation of the Lord at three uh it's one I just give my heart to him and and so I feel like that was my the beginning of my born-again experience but I needed the Holy Ghost I wanted it him and so my granny said well you never know she said you may get it tonight if we pray you may get it tonight well we got to church and there was a group of of Italian people there I remember him very well beautiful singers and we had a church full and and I couldn't enjoy the congregational singing I couldn't enjoy the special singing because I felt so heavy I wanted the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't even know Joshua if I fully knew what he was what it meant you just knew you wanted I just knew I wanted him and so I got down by by the altar bench by the by the Pew there in the front of the church and I have the altar bench where God met me I have the ultra bench where my grandmother received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in 1950 but anyway I knelt there and and I began to pray and I felt my inner man I don't know how to describe it I could probably describe it better now than then leaving my body three times to make a long story shorter three times I felt like something on the inside of me being pulled out of my physical body and I remember being up at the like in the rafters of the church and looking down and seeing myself down there praying for the Holy Ghost I know this is wonderful you know and I began to hear off in the distance a language that I had never heard before and I wanted that language I knew somehow it was mine that I would speak that language sounds a little strange but I knew that was my language and I would speak that language but when I started focusing on that language instead of my desire for him I went back into my body I felt myself coming back down and I could for a few minutes recognize what was going on around me and then again he would pull me out three times I felt pulled out of my body and each time heard the language but it wasn't until I started kind of focusing on that language that I came back in so the Lord was teaching me and I didn't even know what what I was being taught until until later he was teaching me that it's not about speaking in tongues it's not about a feeling it is truly about him and each person has a you know is going to have their own unique way and and you know it's not like you said in the book too it's not just about speaking in the tongues each person will know when they have it yes by the knowing yes by the knowing and and and it won't be like mine my experience of receiving the Holy Ghost won't be like your experience of receiving the Holy Ghost and this is where we make a big mistake is we look at someone else's testimony and we think oh that's how I want it uh and and we focus on that and we miss it remind me to tell you about my grandmother receiving the Holy Ghost all right because it's kind of a story like that where she got to focusing on the wrong thing and it hindered her from getting it uh you should not hear somebody's testimony and they oh you know God must love them more than he loves me oh it's not about that okay I mean everybody's like I said everybody's gonna be completely different you see God knows you just like he knew me and he knew what it would take for a seven-year-old to get it to receive it to believe it to be able to yield to it and he knows at your age at everybody else's age who however old you are if you've not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to receive it like me but you need to receive him because it's the finishing of the born-again experience I truly believe and will be criticized for saying that you are not fully born again until you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to have that birth that comes by the Holy Ghost but don't ever think that because someone received it one way a a grander way or more exciting way that God loves them more than he loves you or or anything like that there's no truce to that at all but he filled me oh he filled me with the Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues that third time that I came down to myself I remember taking my hand and putting it up over my mouth and realizing it was my lips I had been speaking that language the whole time but I was unaware of it that was not to be the focus uh I do not believe that someone has the Holy Ghost because they talked in tongues I really don't I believe it can be counterfeited I believe it can be imitated and I don't think that we need to to to let that be our criteria we need to live a life surrender to the word of God and we can only do that when we have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost however there's no devil in hell and no preacher in the Pulpit that's going to talk me out of what God did for me he give me a such a knowing because I was your knowing that was mine that's what I needed and so the devil has said all kinds of things to me in my mind Through The Years you're a this and you're that and you're not this and you're not the other but I tell you what he doesn't tell me he doesn't tell me that I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if he did he knows what I would tell him you liar I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know and everybody's got to have that kind whatever it takes you've got to have that kind of faith and that kind of an experience so that you will not let the devil talk you out of it and so I ran I danced I jumped I rolled I shouted I probably beat my head on the wall I was wild I confess I'm not ashamed my life had been revolutionized as a seven-year-old boy and uh would never be the same and because of that I would not drink I would not smoke I wouldn't I wouldn't commit fornication so what I'm telling you is God filled me with a holy ghost at seven because he wanted to preserve my life I could have ended up because of the rejection of my father because of watching my mother suffer and the abuse and the bitterness that could have boiled in my life and the hatred that could have boiled in my life I could have become violent I could have been a drug addict I had seen enough drugs my mother had drugs my mother drank alcohol both husbands had problems I could have easily gone that way but because he filled me with this real Holy Ghost he gave me the strength and if there was a Temptation that came and they did come at times if there was a Temptation that came I just I just went back to what he had done for me Lord I could never betray you now I could never fail you now I've got to be true to what you did for me he claimed me when he filled me with the Holy Ghost he come to claim the call that he had placed on my life and I knew from I mean I knew from three I told every every person from three I'm a preacher but at seven I surrendered to the call and it was shortly thereafter shortly after receiving the holy ghost that I preached my first sermon now let me tell you real quick about my granny big mama it's what I called her her name was Mildred Shelley let me tell you real quick about her getting the Holy Ghost if we have time yeah oh yeah okay she was uh raised with with uh 15 brothers and sisters and her mother and father were sharecroppers and uh her dad died at an early age and her mother was was the one who kept the sharecrop contract in other words she continued to do the work of a man to keep her a children in a house with food to eat uh uh a a sharecropper was someone who lived in a small house on someone else's property and they worked the property and the the food the produce belonged to the owner but as part of the wages you got the place to live and you got food on the table and so my great-grandmother my great-grandmother Lizzy she couldn't afford to raise all these children some of them were grown by by the time her husband died and his name was Levy it was spelled Levi but they called him Levy and Wilkerson and and and by the time he passed away she had to plow the field and she carried 100 pound sacks of what they called Joanna fertilizer on her back and plowed the mules and plowed the horses in the field to keep food on the table and to keep a bed a roof over their head in the bed to sleep in and they didn't know anything about about serving the lord they were were Heathen people and uh I'll tell you another time how how my great granny got the whole how all these things happened to them but uh another another time together but let me tell you about about big mama how she got it they moved she grew up she married my grandfather they moved from from La lower Alabama up to Columbus Georgia because that's where the jobs were in the cotton Mills she worked in the cotton meal he worked at the cotton mill and everybody in Columbus Georgia at the time worked in the cotton mill either Hosiery meals or denim we had a big denim Factory here too and that's where people were coming they were leaving the farms and they were coming here to work in the cotton Mills and so they came and my grandmother knew very little about serving the lord but she began to cry for her family she wasn't even really born again but a burden began to fall on her for her family that were lost that didn't know nothing about Jesus and she began to learn from her neighbors things about the Lord she was sitting on her front porch after a shift at the cotton mill and she was eating popcorn and drinking sweet iced tea with milk in it and a little lady walked up on the porch her name was Sister Alice Flanagan her husband was Reverend b w Flanagan who pastored the Assembly of God Church in Columbus Trinity Temple now but in those days it was called Bellwood Assembly of God she walked up on the front porch she said my name is Sister Flanagan and I want to invite you to church and my grandmother burst out in tears how old would she have been well she was she had children so I guess she was in her early well let me think just a minute she was born in the in the late 30s of 45th 1950 this was 1950 when this happened about 1949 or 1950 so she was in in her late 20s is that right or early 30s late 20s early 30s I think or I think it would have been early 30s she burst out in tears and sister Flanagan said oh honey what did I do she said not a thing I just realized that you were the first person that has ever invited me to church that really gets me to be that old already have children and nobody ever invites you to church and she said I sure will come and sister Flanigan just went right down Neil Drive asking everybody to come to church and they came and the first night my granny went it was 49 because she was ordained in 50. so it had to be 1949. this was way back then really if you think about it that's a long time ago she went into church and she'd never seen anything like it in her life she was like my mother was when she went to the Pentecostal Church the first time they were dancing and singing and she said every one of them looked like they had a light bulb in their head because the light she said there was so much light coming out of them she'd never seen happy people all she ever knew was hard work and miserable people just getting by no joy in life and she said these were the happiest people she'd ever seen in all of her life and she said they begin to have a a worship singing shouting dancing and they begin to have what they called a Jericho March well she thought she was somebody you know my grand she was from the farm but had moved to the city she was just an old country girl at heart but she thought you know I've got a good job and I've got a nice house there on Neil drive and and and and and I don't know if I want to carry on like this or not she didn't even know what it all was they begin to have a Jericho March and March around the church clapping and they wanted her to go with him in the Jericho March well she didn't even know what it was but she said it couldn't couldn't hurt nothing marching around the church Clapping Your Hands saying praise the Lord every now and again she thought she could do that so she got up and started doing it and an old sister hit her on the shoulder and said you'll get it tonight and she said I didn't know what I would get she said I had no idea what they were talking about get what what am I going to get tonight and she said I just said well all right then and she said I just kept marching around with them and finally she said I looked down at the altar and there was my neighbor Mrs Havens Carter I grew up calling her my aunt Haven but she wasn't my aunt but that's how how close our families were and she lived right next door to my grandmother and she did hair ladies hair for her living had a little beauty shop in in the side of the house and my grandmother was so shocked because she knew Havens and she knew she wasn't a church-going girl yet and there she was on her knees my granny said in the altar she said she had her hands lifted up like this tears running down her face more beautiful than I had ever seen her she said and she was speaking the most beautiful language she said I have never heard a language like that and she said is that what they were telling me I would get tonight if it is I want to get it just like that she said I'd never seen her look so beautiful just kneeling down there reverently getting this encounter with God and she said I got to focus in on that I said Lord I guess I'm gonna have to stop and kneel down one of these turns uh and and and pray to get whatever that is that Havens has God I can't leave here without it well she did get the Holy Ghost but that was much further in the service and she didn't get it kneeling down in the altar looking beautiful like Havens My grandmother used to say Steve her there wasn't a wrinkle in her dress she was just sit just kneeling there like this just under the power of God she said but I didn't get it that way she said I they prayed for me to get the Holy Ghost and I ran and I hollered and I jumped and I rolled and I laughed and I screamed and God filled me with the Holy Ghost and Fire and changed her life 1949. by 1950 she had surrendered to whatever whatever she was going to do for the Lord and so my point in all that was you know you can't choose how you receive the Holy Ghost and and like we were saying earlier no two is going to be the same you know brother Branham a great servant of God a real genuine prophet of God who lived a generation ago he used to say any birth is a mess it doesn't matter whether it happens in a beautifully pink or sterile Hospital Suite or in a barnyard a birth is a mess there's going to be blood there's going to be there's going to be water there's going to be snotting there's going to be carrying on and and that's what we've got to have son we've got to have a birth a new birth you don't have to run you don't have to talk in tongues you don't have to roll in the floor you don't have to jump Shout shake feel chills you don't have to do any of that but what you have got to do is you've got to have a birth you've got to have the Holy Ghost and Fire because without the Holy Ghost you you can't hold on in the world we're living in today there's too many things pulling us lying to us all the time so my my family because of my granny getting the Holy Ghost in 1949 she took the spirit of God to her whole family and her whole family including her mother was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost one Christmas Eve night which I will certainly tell you sometime if you'll have me by I'd love to tell this and and that's another thing is like I feel like you know when it all comes down to people can say well you don't have the Holy Ghost this person doesn't have the Holy but that's not their place to judge we better not be uh he's the kind of Judge as long as you know in your heart that you are filled with the Holy Ghost I don't think anybody can really take that away from you no and if you are filled the proof is going to be there in your life for sure the fruits of the spirit are going to be there and and and and and the The Obedience to the word is going to be there you you will begin to rearrange your thoughts to line up with the word when you receive the Holy Ghost and your your time doesn't belong to you anymore when you truly receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost you realize that your priorities change they must and what you love changes that the old timers used to say this they'd say when I got saved the things I once loved I now hated and the things I once hated I now loved I remember them also saying when I was a boy Joshua they used to say why when I got saved I didn't quit Dancing because in some of those denominational churches you know if you you could dance and and you couldn't go to dances or anything of course you couldn't in the Pentecostal church either but dancing was sinning but I would hear them Old-Timers say God say stand up and say oh no when I got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost I didn't quit Dancing I just changed partners I wasn't dancing for the world no more I was dancing for Jesus that's right it was real it's real he is real do you remember the first sermon you preached I do I remember the first sermon I know you said in the book you had everything like lined out on index cards and then you ended up getting rid of them and just letting the Lord take over I I remember calling my granny I go back further than that I remember calling my big mama and saying to her big mama I believe the Lord has given me my sermon it was always understood from the time I was three that I was going to be a preacher and I introduced myself as such and when I went one time with my Baptist granny to the Baptist Church and the pastor brother book was his name and he shook the congregation's hand at the end of the service and I looked right up at him just a little boy I look right up at him and I said I really like that song we sung this morning when the role is Called Up Yonder and I said I'm a preacher and I may have your job one day just a little boy I just identified as a preacher well but God began to deal with my heart that the time was drawing near and I was only seven I had just received the Holy Ghost but God began to deal with me and I had a different set of circumstances because Granny had the church and she saw my life she knew what God had done she knew the prophecies um you know I guess I should talk about real quick I should probably mention the confirmation of of the ministry that God gave through the little sister in the colds of fire do you want me yeah I was going to go to that story next but yeah go ahead before I before I go to my first sermon I probably should tell this but uh because the old church was uh it did have electricity it did have electric lights but it didn't have electric heat and later it had gas heaters but when when I was little it had wood stoves a line of them down the side the right hand side of the sanctuary a row against the wall of wood stoves and they had cooked surfaces on them because they had been cook stoves and um so they would get so hot each one of them had its own uh you know chimney or smokestack coming out of the back of it and and and it went straight up the wall and then into the wall and then and then into a hallway and then out of the top of the of the so it didn't smoke up the church and many times we would go in even with the indoor plumbing and the toilets would be froze solid and we'd have to thaw them out to use them because this was a I mean it had been a honky tonk and then the outhouse and so it wasn't fancy and and it was fixed up you know it looked pretty in there as a church but it it was still very primitive still wood floor and and uh and anyway uh those cook stoves were along the walls and somebody had to put the wood in and keep them fed the problem is because they weren't wood heaters they were wood stoves that had been used for cooking they had a cooked surface some of them a little bit larger than others and that what that is son is you just put your pot right on the the surface of the cook stove and cook whatever you were cooking boiling potatoes or fried chicken or whatever you were doing and that was just there dangerous oh my goodness we would go to jail today if we had cook stoves in here for children to get to but but nobody knew I mean I don't guess they even knew back then there were no fire inspections or anything well anyway it was dangerous because the whole top of that stove got hot and the stove pipe would get so hot that you it would look like that white heat would make it look like you could look right through the stove pipe you've probably never seen anything like that and so I've seen many times the Saints shout dance worship God and get around there behind them stoves around those cook stoves and and visitors would go crazy because they they were afraid they were going to hurt themselves and even I at times as a kid would look up and think oh my because I've seen men grab those stove pipes lost in the spirit of God tears running down their face and lay their bare cheek up against the stovepipe and not be burned now that's Supernatural that is Supernatural that don't happen in the natural and I saw more than one occasion someone sit right down you know dancing around jumping praising the Lord crying and sit right down on that surface of that cook stove and not be burned I grew up with a supernatural childhood to to see those things and only be 55 these things were you know in most places they they weren't happening like that in in 68. I guess you never got tired of that feeling though to see that I've never ever got got used to it or or it's not common to me and I want that presence I want to be in that kind of an atmosphere every chance I get so this particular night I had I had actually spoken that night I had given a little something so it must have been right after the preaching right after I'd started preaching I may have gotten that a little out of order because my or either I was reading a scripture or something but my Bible was on the pulpit that night I remember that very well and there was a little sister in our church uh uh who was uh was a hard-working she had a lot of children she worked in the cotton mill her husband was sometimes in church sometimes out of church she had a hard life she got in the spirit and she danced around that church she danced over around that stove that hot stove she sat down on the cook stove and I ran because I loved her so much I ran to see if I could help her get up stand up and to see if her dress was I thought the whole back end of her dress would be burned out because she sat there so long when I got around there to her to try to help her up she stood up before I could touch her and there was not one scorched place on the back of her dress that's Supernatural that can't happen you can't sit on a hot stove and not be burned she was there was not a skirt there was no smell of smoke nothing but what she did next will be very difficult for some people to believe and I can't say I don't care I care whether or not people believe it but whether they choose to believe it or not again is up to them I was there when it happened and I know what happened she reached over and unlatched the door where you fed the wood and I I thought I mean at that point I didn't know people were watching I mean some were still worshiping but a lot of people watch it'd be hard not to watch once you realize that this what was going on and I saw this Joshua with my own eyes God is my witness she reached in to that hot stove into those hot red coals of Fire and took two heaping handfuls of of red hot coals out of that fire I can just feel people now saying oh I just thought but you know the Bible says that he gives us power over all the powers of the enemy and he talks about the signs that follow the Believers they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and it says if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them they shall take up the serpents and not be harmed and and and so forth and so to me this was an extension of that scripture she wasn't drinking poison but she was doing something extremely dangerous she was walking almost as though she were walking through the fire and not being burned she kept dancing and speaking in tongues carrying like this those two heaping handfuls of red hot colds she danced across the front of the church with those coats in her hand now I'm telling you people went crazy they did they worshiped God they ran they cried they pounded the floor they they we knew that we were in the presence of God we knew that something Supernatural was taking place no one wanted to miss what God was doing people were getting saved people backsliders were run into the altar I mean it was uh a lot going on I'm sure she danced across the front of the church and hesitated a moment because she was a very respectful little sister and she didn't just March up on the platform but she she just she just you know kind of made her way up onto the step she got up onto the platform and she danced over to the pulpit and she lay those burning hot coals of fire on my Bible and prophesied about my Ministry now it happened we didn't move those coals I just have to ask what they burned out on my Bible and and and not one page of that Bible was destroyed do you still have that rifle I do not have that Bible because that Bible was later buried in the pla in the foundation of the church in Columbus OH that you've told me that that's right I I wished I had it but it wasn't meant for me to have but we thought we would always be in Columbus I guess and not out here in the country and so that Bible is buried there in the floor uh in a box in the foundation in the slab I guess you should say of the church in Columbus but there was just a maybe just a little around the edges of the page you could see just a little discoloration not one word was unreadable not one page was burned through it just burned out that the coach just burned out on the Bible did it take like a long time it took quite a while it took the rest of the service before those coasts would turn gray and be burned out but by the time that was happening people were being healed I remember particularly a crippled man in a brace that was healed that night and many received the baptism of the Holy Ghost many received deliverances from demons the church just happened to be packed full that night and when I say Pack full 250 people or more maybe 300 people and that was just another confirmation that that my Ministry was going to be uh what God said it was going to be doesn't make me any more special than anybody else it just means that God because I was so young and look everybody didn't think that was a great idea for a seven-year-old to preach there were some people in the church who called me a novice and who said the Bible said a novice shouldn't shouldn't have a position in the church like that and here's what my granny said when I called her to tell her I wanted to preach she said well that's wonderful she said we're already having a service that Saturday night uh we're going to have some singers to sing you come and bring bring a message and then you preach for me Sunday morning and we're going to have a baptism in the afternoon and she didn't hesitate at all I started preparing my thoughts I wrote everything down on index cards and was ready to preach by a little Baptist granny came down the hallway and she said Steve do you want mammal to help you get your sermon I said I don't know mamaw but I think I'm supposed to get it from the Lord and she said well all right I'll do what I can and back down the hallway she went I heard her when she dropped down on her knees I heard her knees hit the floor I heard her begin to help him Lord oh help him Lord you give him what he needs to say I had it all wrote down and in fact I wrote down uh on the last card let us bow our head I had my altar call wrote down my grandmother got up in church that that Sunday because that night I don't even think I spoke that night I think it was a Sunday before I actually spoke she got up and she said now listen she said Steve has not had an ordinary life you people know how many of you here and know my grandson and everybody in the room knew me you have met in your life a couple of people who were there that day one of them particularly sister Lucy Huckabee she was in the service you see what always tell me walking out I was there and your dad preached his first message she's with the Lord now but she was very proud she sure was of me and love me very much and she was so happy to have been there at the beginning the first because she didn't come to our church she was in another church in Phoenix City but that morning she was drawn to be there and she was so happy to be there for that first sermon well anyway my granny got up she said you know him you know he's had an unusual life you know he doesn't he didn't grow up like a lot of other kids he hasn't gone into the world like a lot of people he's just seven years old she said from from before he was born God's hand was on him you heard the prophecy she pointed to the sister who gave the prophecy you've heard you've seen what God did you've seen how God used him to pray for the sick already and how God has healed them and she said I don't know what he will do I don't know what his sermon will be but she said I want you to know one thing his granny he'll be right here to back him up she said if he doesn't preach but five or ten minutes I'll be right here to back him up I think the book says you ended up preaching like 45 minutes 45 minutes uh but her such strong support because she was so respected so respected and her strong and staunched support for me could have been judged as a grandmother but people knew her better than that they knew that she didn't make provision for her family if they did wrong she called them out and so it meant something it paved the way now I was too short to see over the pulpit and so they took the altar that's down there at the office that my grandmother got the Holy Ghost on they took that altar bench and they took the piano stool and that's at our house and they put the piano stool on top of the altar bench and that was just the right height for me to see over and I and I preached I opened up my little bible I had an award Bible a gift and award Bible uh you used to could get them for four dollars and I don't know what they were even further back then just a little simple Bible that they give away in Sunday school was I didn't have a study Bible but I had all my index cards and I got up and I began to try to read those cards and Joshua there was an oil there was a warm sensation that came all over me it was just like somebody was pouring hot oil on my head and I could feel it as it come dripping down and I remembered in that moment I remembered one of the things that Jesus said to me when I was three years old in that visitation if you open your mouth remember if you open your mouth I will fill it and so I just yielded to that anointing that's what that oil was that was the everybody doesn't feel it that way I haven't always felt it that way I'm not putting anything in that but I did that day and I began to preach with an unction from the Lord I don't want to sound I'm sure that it was simple a must have been very simple we've actually played in church here at some of my anniversaries and things we've played a few excerpts of when I was about nine or ten really preaching yeah I remember that and and I've got one of the first on a cassette tape that we have used a little pieces of it and we'll dig those out because uh in in a couple of years I'll have a 50th anniversary of preaching 50 years I'll be I'll be 55 soon and in two years if Jesus dairies I'll be 57 and and we will have a an anniversary 50 years and we'll we'll try to bring some of those things out again but it was anointed it was him it God honored it there were people saved there were people filled with the Holy Ghost and we went to the to the creek and we baptized after the service and that night we came back and talked about church I thought we'd had church that morning that night you couldn't have put another person in the building the word had gotten all over Columbus there was no Facebook there was no Twitter there was no Instagram there was no cell phone there was no no way of getting out getting the word out it it had gone by the morning and now about six o'clock in the afternoon from 10 in the morning church out about one and now six o'clock and you couldn't have put another person on the floor they were it was that packed out I had to laugh because I was reading uh last night reading the book and uh your granny I guess you preached an hour and a half that's nice that's right she came up to you said it's now Steve that's a little long she did and I had to laugh because I was like what would she say now it depends well I do I do because I I do I do I do I can't deny it she said uh she said uh honey that was glorious she said that that service and all those people that got help from the Lord but she said the pre that that hour and a half she said that's a little bit too long um old brother Ward let me tell you this O Brother Ward he's gone on too he was a pastor here in town he used to come around and help me in the early days and be a blessing and he'd say little Stevie I want to tell you something yes sir brother Ward he'd say the the mind will only comprehend what the seat will endure so in other words after you're numb you can't pay attention as much that's funny I had never heard that yep um now how old were you when you ended up moving to Anderson well uh between then uh when I was because that's where you started your own your first church right right now I was in a I was preaching a Revival up in the valley when I was about 15. I preached now from from 7 to 15 I was still in school but I preached somewhere all the time and during summer I I took the tent I preached Under the Tent all up and down the East Coast all down through the through South through Florida Alabama Georgia Mississippi Louisiana South Carolina North Carolina Virginia West Virginia all the way up and did every summer was gone the whole summer preaching Under the Tent and preached for local churches and and anywhere we could drive I couldn't even drive I had to be carried to Revival my granny would carry me church friends would carry me and there were two sisters Who Loved Me they were related to your friend Taylor and they loved me they loved my Ministry they lived over in Phoenix City and they would carry me in their van they would they took me I cannot tell you the miles that those two Godly sisters two two grandmothers carried me from church to church to church to church to preach and they would sing with me we sang and we and I preached and because I had no way of getting around couldn't drive that young by the time I was 15 I had done I'd done a youth pastor a stent already at a church in Phoenix City I was preaching a Revival in the valley and driving back and I stopped in at shony's that night and I met some some old friends and their church was in trouble and they invited me to come and help them in their Church come and preach fill in and I became the interim pastor and was later voted in as Pastor so that was between the ages of 15 and 16. and then uh after that it would have been about 1985 86 I started traveling then after that and I ended up in South Carolina where I started the first church that I ever started on my own was in Anderson South Carolina and that's where I began to hear more of what we believe now that's what I was about to get to uh the church was doing good at first it's from According to the book yeah it was going good and then all of a sudden it started problems yes and that's when Brother Cleveland and sister started to come up let me tell you this I was in Evansville Indiana holding a Revival and we were fasting and praying and God had performed A great miracle there several Miracles but an outstanding Miracle where a young man was given his sight yeah and uh had lost his sight in a weedy weed eater accident and God had restored his side his whole family came to God came back to God or to God his God I think that was a backslider or whatever he said he came running deacon they ran what some of the family jumped over the Pew they didn't even getting wait to get out to come get saved and I thought that and that Revival was going so good and we thought that it would be because in those days Joshua if the god started moving a Revival that was scheduled to last three nights could last five weeks six weeks eight weeks Ten Weeks every night 12 weeks every night and so uh but we were fasting and praying in the daytime I had a couple of young Brothers with me and uh who were traveling with me playing music with me and uh we were considering putting the tent up again and doing some different things and and I received a word from the Lord and and the Word was I want you to go to Anderson South Carolina and there you will receive an end time message of Truth for the Bride of Jesus Christ that's pretty heavy working yeah and I remember in the book it said you and the guy you were with were like no we're not we're not going back especially those guys because they had one of them had come from there one of them lived right outside of Anderson in a place called Pickens and all of his old stomping grounds and and and party mates were there and he didn't want to ever go back to that area plus Anderson was known as a place where preachers die you know it was a rough religious town and it was very cruel to me too but anyway God had a purpose for me being there so I ended up in South Carolina we ended up starting a church God God began to bless it I still didn't know what this end time message means perhaps God was going to give me something to preach I didn't know what was coming uh I had had some experiences uh in the past where the Lord had spoken and I didn't know what it was going to end up being but I was preaching on the radio every day and a brother a sister Cleveland heard the sermon she fellowshipped with her husband in a church several hours away where they honored and respected and followed the ministry of of William Branham and uh she said to her husband I believe this man is preaching the message he must know something about brother Branham and I want you to hear him so the next day at lunch he'd come in early he heard the sermon he said Delane you're right that's it's what he's preaching they ended up asking for permission from their Pastor if they could come and visit our church because he they drove they've been driving for hours if they could come miss one service and and visit our church and check it out and see what was going on and they did and in that service I preached and brother Cleveland stood up and prophesied never met him before he stood up and prophesied and said you have been raised up as an embarrassment to the Pastors in this city and and this is what God is going to do and this is what God is going to confirm and and so God did outstanding things there and really if that had to shifted at some point I would have probably never wanted to leave there but but God ultimately wanted me home he wanted me back here and I don't know how much of that we want to get into today we can talk about it another time too but uh you know it changed my life he brought me some tapes Brother Cleveland came to several services and he brought me some tapes in a brown paper bag and they changed my life the spoken word is the Original Seed was the name of the sermon and it changed my life but for a long time I didn't listen to them because a deacon saw him give him to me and he came up to me and he said you don't want to listen to that they believed some strange things about a rattlesnake and you don't want nothing to do with that and he tried to discourage me he was a very well-meaning man he just didn't understand now before all this though didn't you weren't you telling your grandmother that there was something more and you kept going around to different meetings and stuff yes when I was an older teenager a younger teenager I guess you'd say yeah I heard the Lord in a prayer time I heard the Lord's talking to me about the coming of the spirit of Elijah and that the spirit of Elijah would forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ so I started preaching that from the Bible I preached about John the Baptist I preached about Elijah in the Bible how Elisha had a double portion how John the Baptist was fulfilling some of that Commission but that I really had this understanding from the Lord that there would be another installment of this Spirit of Elijah kind of ministry before the Lord came back and my gran I told my grandmother what the Lord had spoken and she allowed me to preach it in her church she did eventually warn me and she said I'm afraid honey that people are going to think you're pointing to yourself and I said myself I'm not in any way insinuating that I have that kind of a Ministry but she was concerned that that someone might think that along the way we went to hear tip preachers we traveled because I was on a search to find someone who seemed to have that forerunning anointing that spirit and power of Elijah on their Ministry and I saw I actually came into meetings where people claimed it yeah where people believed they were and and in fact were not and that was going around in in the all the way back 50s 60s 70s 80s you know people there that that was that was a thought but when I heard those tapes I didn't listen to them for a long time things started going pretty bad for me in South Carolina just kind of all of a sudden and uh one day I'm weeping in my office I mean weeping on my desk on on South Main Street Anderson South Carolina and the Lord spoke to me and said the answer to every one of your problems is in that bag of tapes in that brown paper bag I heard his voice and we should the Bible said his sheep know his voice and a stranger they will not follow so it's not boasting to say we can hear from the Lord the Bible said as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God and so God led me and when I heard those tapes I knew I didn't know anything about William Branham but I knew that that was that Ministry that was to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ it's not been an easy Journey I've not always been accepted among those precious people but I know that I know that I know that I know that God led me to that Ministry because there were questions that I had that needed to be answered and there were imbalances in my life that needed to be made right and I needed to understand what God was going to do in the end time now I personally do not believe that all these things ended when brother Branham died I believe that there is a people a bride being prepared right now to work the works of Jesus Christ uh the scripture is so clear can I read you a scripture go ahead I thought I would read this because sometimes people want to know uh what would you advise you know if you were to give it Vice to some young person or to someone who is starting out to serve the Lord you know how do how do you stay encouraged and how do you how do you pursue Christ how do you run after Jesus Hebrews 13 7-8 says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and you know what the next verse is verse 8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever one of brother branham's favorite Scriptures it is my favorite scripture now let me read that in the Amplified real quick it says remember your leaders and superiors in Authority for it was they who brought to you the word of God listen to this observe attentively and consider their manner of living the outcome of their well-spent lives and imitate their faith now it goes on but I want to stop there just by saying that would be a word of advice so much I have gained by studying the ministry of brother Branham and others but specifically brother Branham because uh I believe I was to be connected to that truth but but I have been blessed by reading the life of other great men of God generals of the faith and even women that God used and so I would say to to young people today stay in the word read the word hear the word you all have tools today that we didn't have you you don't even have to read it you can you can Mash play and listen to it and digest it you've got sermon tapes what we call tapes but now they're not on tape their messages on my phone I can listen to every sermon brother Branham preached I can be connected to my local church I can hear every sermon my pastor preaches you can hear every sermon your pastor preaches in church and on your app we are so blessed I mean really as a as a as a generation we are so blessed to be able when I first heard of brother branham's Ministry I wanted to have ever taste every sermon he ever preached do you know what that took it took thousands of dollars I spent it it took thousands of dollars and that wall right there and and come on around this way too it would it took that much wall space you still have them all done we have one copy of everything on cassette tape so like spoken word it's the Original Seed Sunday morning and Sunday night I think all together that's six cassettes yeah so one sermon took up that much wall space and now you there's a tiny tiny little what do you call that USB here no a chip oh I know what you're talking about tiny tiny little almost microscopic chip where you can have everyone nearly 1200 sermons on it so this generation this generation is blessed and they have no excuse not to not to dig in this word and and if I've ever been a blessing to you or to anybody out there the app is nhrm app on all the all the uh platforms you can download that app you can watch our service live and you can go back and archive you'll find something brother branham's sermons there brother Perry green sermons my sermons sermons of other ministers who have ministered in our church articles and quotations and all your television broadcasts all of the television broadcasts not all but many of them yeah you have access to so what I'm saying is stay in that word be a word nerd you got to if you're going to be a nerd be a word nerd get in this Bible and don't be satisfied to know what God did for for Stephen Shelley don't be satisfied to know what God did for William Branham you keep pursuing him staying in that word and praying and and Desiring an encounter with God for yourself don't just be satisfied to read what God did a generation ago what's God going to do in your generation I mean I I am I keep saying it I guess it's hitting me hard nearly 55. I'm going to serve God the rest of my life I am going to preach the gospel the rest of my life but I don't know how long that is your generation can carry this farther than than than my generation can but you're going to have to stay in the word and you're going to have to pursue a personal relationship with Jesus Christ not depending on your pastor's relationship or a prophet's relationship but we've all got to have a personal Encounter With Jesus Christ I mean I think we're starting to run out of time but we definitely you know want to get you back on here to finish your the rest of your life story That's mighty NASA how you came back here um I think I I really I think this is gonna be big for a lot of people to listen to I hope so it's like I said it was really something that was in my heart um but if you wouldn't mind praying over everybody and everybody watching and over everything I would I'll be glad to pray because I could feel that anointing building as we were talking there at the end somebody is watching this no doubt I'm not trying to be spiritual but somebody is watching this no doubt and you know that you have a call from God whether it's preaching or leading worship or writing or or social media evangela evangelization or Mission you know you know there's a call on your life and and I want you to to learn emulate the faith of those that have gone before you I want you to know how God used brother Branham I want you and your siblings and the young people of this church to be familiar with how God has moved in my life but I don't ever want anybody to be satisfied knowing that I want every person to know what it means for you to have an experience with him and God wants to use that call he wants to put his finger on it and pour His oil on it you've got to stay in that word you've got to stay in prayer and you've got to stay humble you know sometimes we promote ourselves we can't do that the holy spirit will open doors for us I've never had to ask people to preach even when I was depending as an evangelist on an offering to live I didn't call people and ask them to could I come and preach for you can I come and preach for you I'm passing through can I I didn't have to do that because the Lord said you open your mouth I'll fill it and he did the promoting and he did the door opening and now I can just be thankful to him so don't think you've got to promote yourself you let the Holy Spirit open the doors you do the praying and God will do the rest and maybe you're you're an elderly person and you think my life is behind me and there's nothing left that I can do that's not true either we need prayer warriors and we need those who have been through the fire to give their testimony that's what you're going to do on this and the older podcast the older people and middle-aged people in this church have been such a huge you know huge help to all the young people here I mean I can name off 10 or 15. I hope you'll have them I hope you'll have some of them on here even if if they have to you know we're work to get their thoughts together I hope you'll be patient with them and and let them share their testimony because there's there's prophetic power in a testimony we got to pray we have to pray Joshua father in the name of Jesus I want to thank you for this podcast I want to thank you for Joshua Lord thank you for the call of God on his life thank you for this burden that you've placed on his heart anoint him and give him courage and give him boldness and use him and use this podcast in Mighty ways to encourage your people Lord every person watching this right now I pray that your encouragement will be upon them I pray Lord that they will not be afraid young people will not be afraid to be word nerds I pray they'll not be afraid to be to be Eagles to study to pull to Feast to eat this word because we're Changed by what we eat I pray Lord you'll raise up a generation of Prayer Warriors Who Will Pray until the victory Comes Who Will Pray until something happens I pray Lord that every person touched by this broadcast I pray they will will ask for their own Holy Ghost experience that they won't be satisfied to hear about mine or Joshua's but they'll want their own and they'll cry out until they have been either filled or refilled with the Holy Ghost heal the sick stir our churches Lord in this hour we want to give you the best that we have we want to see Souls saved backsliders come home we ask for your help and leadership in all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen thank you for having me thank you for doing this with me I appreciate it thank you all for watching um I'm super excited to see where this podcast goes there will definitely be a part two coming out because there's a lot of stories and things I wanted to ask that I didn't get the time to but uh just be tuned and get ready I gonna have a lot more people come on to the podcast and talk I think our plan is to have one hopefully once a month or so for now possibly more it just depends but I'm super excited and thank you all for tuning in and watching this see you next time [Music] thank you
