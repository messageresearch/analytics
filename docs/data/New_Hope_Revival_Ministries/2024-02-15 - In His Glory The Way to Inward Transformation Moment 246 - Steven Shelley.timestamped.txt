[0:00] I tell you getting in the presence of
[0:02] the Lord will energize you it will
[0:06] satisfy you but most importantly it will
[0:11] change you now the Cherub beam stood on
[0:15] the right side of the house when the man
[0:18] went in and the cloud filled the inner
[0:22] Court which is the holy place then the
[0:26] glory of the Lord went up from the
[0:31] Cherub as soon as I was saying that I
[0:36] was carried momentarily in my mind so
[0:40] that I could hear Brother brandom
[0:42] telling in the tent
[0:45] Vision how that glory of the Lord went
[0:49] and left the platform and hung over that
[0:53] little room he called it we now know
[0:57] that it wasn't a little room but it was
[0:59] a t within a
[1:02] tent it was a small little structure
[1:05] there a stretch of canvas one time he
[1:08] called it a tent within a tent and the
[1:11] Lord said in that Vision just like he
[1:13] did in the scripture I will meet you in
[1:18] there that little tent represents a
[1:21] bridal chamber a nupal chamber a hoopa
[1:25] if you will a place where bridegroom and
[1:29] bride
[1:30] come together and they are no longer
[1:34] individuals and in that little holy
[1:37] place where the presence of God is to us
[1:40] it's like the holy of holies it's in
[1:43] there where we are most
[1:46] changed from glory to glory how many of
[1:50] you want to spend some time in there in
[1:53] the Holy presence in the cavod in the
[1:56] glory of the Lord in the bridal chamber
[1:59] God put those holy Cherry
[2:02] beams plac them at the going end of the
[2:06] garden and the Bible simply says we like
[2:09] to say they were there to keep Adam and
[2:12] Eve out that's not what the Bible says
[2:15] the Bible says they were placed there to
[2:20] guard the
[2:22] way they were place there to guard the
[2:26] way to the tree of life it does doesn't
[2:30] mean that no man will ever be allowed to
[2:32] get to the
[2:33] tree how many of you are glad you found
[2:36] your way but it means that it won't be
[2:39] just a happen stance or some halfhazard
[2:42] approach if you make it all the way to
[2:45] the tree of life and you receive the
[2:48] life of Jesus Christ into the innermost
[2:51] part of your being you're going to have
[2:54] to pass by the Cherub beams to get
[2:56] there so we know that the Cherub beams
[3:00] though they are Heavenly Creatures
[3:02] created to worship God and they are
[3:06] comparable even to the four living
[3:10] creatures that we read about in The Book
[3:13] of the
[3:14] Revelation they are directly somehow
[3:18] connected to the overcoming bride of
[3:21] Jesus Christ and so if cherubim's
[3:24] worship this bride is going to have to
[3:27] find her way into to the spirit of
[3:32] worship they're going to have to praise
[3:35] until the spirit of worship comes the
[3:39] anointing to worship comes and then
[3:42] worship until the glory comes and when
[3:46] the glory comes you stand under and in
[3:49] the glory because you want it to have
[3:51] its maximum effect in your life remember
[3:55] what he told us about that little room
[3:57] on the
[3:58] inside he said they'll go in one way and
[4:01] come out another
[4:03] way when God allowed me to revisit that
[4:06] place in the spirit he showed me that
[4:09] very thing happening people going in
[4:12] with their problems with their Hang-Ups
[4:15] not just physical deformity but also
[4:18] inward
[4:21] infirmity inner healing needed but when
[4:25] they came out the other side they had
[4:27] lost all of their intimidation ations
[4:30] they had lost all of their Hang-Ups and
[4:34] their warts and all the problems that
[4:36] they had had their inferiority complexes
[4:40] listen if you can get in the glory of
[4:43] the Lord and stay there long enough
[4:46] you'll lose all of your
[4:51] complexes you spend enough time in the
[4:54] glory of the
[4:56] Lord you'll lose your complexes
[5:01] I can't see a promise for the church to
[5:05] live in his presence but I can see a
[5:09] promise that the bride as she's changed
[5:13] from glory to glory will be able to
[5:20] live
[5:22] live in his
[5:28] presence
