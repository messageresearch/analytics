dehydration and we just want to remember him and his family to the lord and they're asking for prayer for some of the nurses and staff and other people that they have met along the way that are in such need of the lord we also want to remember sister flo today she's not with us she is experiencing some fatigue and just run down and we want to ask the lord to touch her and we want to remember all of the needs that we have seen through this week that the lord would just minister to every one of them loss of life and people are grieving and there's so many needs but my father knows how to take care of every one of them once again just reach your hand up to the lord father i want to thank you that you are full of grace and mercy and you are truth i thank you lord that as we come into your presence today and you have spoken to us that you are you are exactly what we need and i thank you lord that you are so willing to meet us at the point of our need and when we are down and we feel so downcast lord you're the lifter of our head when we're grieving lord you are the one who knows how to put bomb on that grief and to raise us up out of that place and return to joy and living once again i thank you lord that you're the healer of our bodies that at that calvary you defeated all of the demons that would try to take our health and i thank you lord that today you are health and strength for our brother curry lord we send your word to him and a sister anita to their family and all of these requests that they made known about hospital staff and others that they met along the way who are struggling lord but you are the helper oh my god you lift us up out of a dry place you lift us up out of sorrow you lift us up lord because that's who you are god we are here today and we're asking you to minister to our sister flo lord let your presence be upon her and strengthen her this day i ask you god that you will just go where she is and lift her up continue lord to strengthen sister pam hendrix lord lay your hand upon her life draw her to yourself lord i know that you use circumstances of our life to draw people to your very own self and god we want to be just yielded to your presence lord when we are tried we shall come forth as pure gold oh lord you invited this laodicean age to to be tried in the fire that she could come forth as gold oh may we yield to the fire lord may we yield to your fire may we yield to whatever you want to do in our lives lord the rest of this service as our pastor our brother comes to minister the word of the lord may our hearts be in tune with the frequency of heaven to hear what you desire to say strengthen his physical body lord let all of the pain and the things that he's experiencing in his body just pass from him lord and may be strengthened to do your work god we commit ourselves to you all that we are all that we have lord we are committed to you and to your work in the end time we give you glory and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen shout to the lord all the earth let us sing power and majesty praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh what a promise we have in the lord jesus christ thank you lord for the promise that we have in you hallelujah can you give him a clap offering today shout to god with the voice of triumph hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may have your seat today i remember hearing brother branham talk about sound waves and he said noah's message is still in the sound waves in the earth and if we could ever tap into it we could hear noah's message he talked about how the television signals go through the atmosphere and talked about if they could find something to tap into it as they did with television that's how you get your television signal and radio signal and so forth and these sounds are in the atmosphere and i'm making an assumption that before the service this song was practiced shout to the lord all the earth i had not been thinking about this song at all i did not hear them practicing the song but as i walked up through here and opened that back door i started singing it so it must have been in the atmosphere it must have been something that pleased the lord that's why i lingered on it because that sound in the atmosphere it's changing things whether we know it or not if our words whether positive or negative are changing things in the atmosphere when we're singing praise to the lord it's shifting things and i believe that there's shift in the atmosphere when we give praise and adoration to the spirit of the living god he is marvelous to us he is marvelous oh hallelujah i'm grateful for his grace in our lives he is he is mighty he is powerful he is working on our behalf even when we don't feel him he's working and i am grateful today that he is working on my behalf he is changing me into his image from glory to glory he's changing me because he wants me to come into his image he it's his desire that's what he desires is for me to come that's why we're still on the earth because he has a bride that is going to come into his image oh my let me get there quickly lord i don't want to be delaying this thing i don't want to be delaying it i want to see that the plan of god is fulfilled in this end time we're glad that you're here today we've come to give the lord praise and worship and we continue to do that as we give of our tithe and offering nathan will you come and michael brother michael will you come we let these two brothers come to you and let you give your tithe an offering we will receive the principal offering in just a moment separately if you've already written out an envelope with it already in that's fine they'll make sure it gets in the right place we'll let these brothers come to you can we sing that chorus majesty worship his majesty and continue worshiping the lord majesty worship his majesty [Music] on to jesus be all glory honor and praise [Music] authority [Music] flows from his throne unto his own his anthems rings so exalt lift up on high the name of jesus [Music] magnify come glorify christ jesus the king oh majesty [Music] worship his majesty [Music] he's jesus who died now glorified [Music] of all kings [Applause] he's jesus who died now glorified [Music] hallelujah we worship you lord we worship you hallelujah hallelujah [Music] we give you praise o lord thank you jesus thank you jesus david they tell me this is one of your co-workers ben ben we're glad that you're here with us today [Applause] sister rebecca it's good to see you and mariah with us today the lord bless you [Applause] so thankful for all of you home folks sister jeanette and the girls sister bonnie the lord bless you we've had a week where we did not gather together we had a marvelous time in the camp meeting brother brooks just given it everything he had to minister in song and in the word and how the lord met us here and the uh the song that the choir sang on sunday and how blessed we were by that and just letting it reverberate in our minds through the week that we are overcomers not we're gonna be we are you see friends we're a part of i am not i was and i'm going to be but we're a part of i am he's a part of us he's living in us and so that doesn't mean we're gonna be overcomers it means present tense we are overcomers well i didn't look like much of an overcomer this week [Music] it's irrelevant because he is i am and i am lives in me i am an overcomer and all of these trials that are put in my life to bring me forth as pure gold they're put there for a reason and god allows them to come whether they be big or whether they belittle because he is training us he is shaving off all of those things that don't need to be there and through it all i'm still an overcomer well i didn't overcome the trial that he put me through that's all right it'll come back around in a while he'll let you go through it again because you're going to overcome it you are you're going to see the present tense reality of overcoming something that in a pastime you may not have because it's a part of i am that is who he is in you and as we allow him to become more i am in our lives oh my friends it is becoming more of a reality every day that i was put on this earth not just to represent jesus christ but to be a living reality of jesus christ because he dwells in me hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord i am i am that's who he is and that's who i am because he dwells inside of me well i trust that you brought with you an offering to give on the principle of this mortgage we're so blessed to report that currently 134 19 655.19 has been given toward this effort and we just want to praise the lord [Music] he is so marvelous to us [Applause] we are seeing this debt reduced day by day by day you say well they're still adding interest yes i understand that but it's coming down by the grace of god we're seeing this settled so if you brought a principal offering with you today i'm going to ask that you bring it with you and come and drop it in the offering bag may i call on my son nathan once again to come and hold the offering bag and let you give to the lord the offering that you brought if you have it in your hand would you hold it let me pray over it father first of all i want to thank you that these people brought their tithe and offering into the house of the lord and they have given it and i want to bless them for their faithfulness to that now lord they have been so faithful to bring their uh offering for the principle of the mortgage and as as they're holding it in their hand i'm asking you lord that as they sow this seed in faith toward this uh mortgage god i pray that you will let there be great multiplication and that they would see it come back into their lives even as they're seeing it with their tithe and with their offering that they give week by week lord i thank you that you are causing this mortgage to be a gone in the name of the lord jesus christ this this news this debt that has hung over us for so many years i am asking you now lord that as we give that you would multiply it god and that the interest part would come down much more and that you will send in the wagon loads even as you have promised that we can do the work that you've called us to we give you glory and honor and praise for it is in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen praise the lord may the lord bless you as you come and give to the lord today how great is our god how great is his word how great is our god how great is our god how great [Music] he's the is one that ever was [Music] and he said i will lead you put your trust in me how great is our god how great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was heard he rolled back the water of the mighty red sea and he said i will lead you put your trust in me sing again how great is our god how great is his word he's the [Music] greatest ever was heard he wrote back the water of the mighty red sea and he said i will lead you will you stand and sing again as our pastor comes how great is [Music] how great is his word he's the greatest [Music] of the mighty red sea and he said i will leave sing it again [Music] how great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was heard he [Music] put your trust how many of you have your trust in the lord this morning yes he never fails he never fails you may be seated we're happy to see you in the house of the lord this morning and we have a good many out and god knows where they are they may be standing in need of our prayers this morning and so we want to faithfully lift them up to the lord and i know there are those who have doctors appointments coming up and test results sister tebow sister flo and maybe others but god sees all of that he knows all about it we just keep putting our trust in him and i'm so glad that you're here today i feel the presence of the lord i sure appreciated and enjoyed what brother greeley was sharing with him it seemed like everything he shared was just so good i chewed on it i appreciate the lord i appreciate him for giving us those nuggets and they may come back to you sometime this week when you need them he's good like that isn't he and we've had lots to chew on this week and uh it was a wonderful thing to hear some of the young people say last sunday night they said my i can't believe we're going to go a whole week without being in church it's one thing when the seniors say that because the they they have come through that way faithful and they're going to be here and we know that and we count on them but it's especially encouraging when young people uh say i i don't know about being out of service for a whole week but um i don't know about you but i needed this time and i'm here today feeling strong because of the goodness of the lord and because of some rest and we have had testimonies come in this week of what god has done for us during camp meeting and some who have already gone home have sent their testimonies back and we won't take time to share all of those this morning but they were significant and god met people here and he carried the saints home a lot of you were here when uh all of our friends from indiana left and drove home and they got in about little after four o'clock monday morning and they had to start shores at five and then worked that day but you know i heard from some of them uh monday evening and the strength of the lord was just carrying them they milked the cows with a lot of anointing on them at five o'clock monday morning and the strength of the lord was upon all of us i believe that i really do and god met needs there were some who said they received the baptism of the holy ghost and that's why we gather is so that people can have a personal experience with the lord i'm so happy about that stacy and i and benjamin and mariah took brother brooks and sister ruby to the airport on monday around lunchtime just before lunchtime and they were so encouraged and so blessed and to see them high after a hard-working week brother brooks gave a lot and they are in their 60s for those of you who have asked they are in their 60s and getting very close to 70 and uh pastoring two churches and sister ruby does most of the driving she's the chauffeur and gets him back and forth but uh they are hoping that they can do something to sort of minimalize those miles between the two places you can just imagine what a toll that takes and you're giving i want you to know that your giving made a tremendous difference in what we were able to give to brother brooks this year and i don't mind to tell you i think you might be interested to know of course we didn't have to split the honorarium just having one speaker here but i want you to know we were able to give him an extra thousand dollars that he has never received before and you did it that was your giving and uh [Music] every penny that you designated for special speaker every penny of it went to him and he was so grateful i know you think about a pastor having two churches and you think my he must really be making it but i wish that we were not streaming right now because i would be able to really tell you just how how hard it is but god is helping them and they're getting by but your giving has made a difference does it make you feel good to know that you sowed into such a life like that in the ministry like that and that it was needed and it was appreciated never taken for granted so thank you all all of the expenses of camp meeting were met because of your giving there was nothing left over there was no no uh extra expense that we had to figure out how we were going to pay out of our regular weekly finances so again to god be the glory one of the most successful times that we have had together financially and you say that doesn't matter well it matters to those of us who have to make it work day after day after day after day after day and it could not have happened without you i did not mention uh birthdays last sunday there was so much going on i didn't mention birthdays i let it slip my mind i did greet april as she was going through the the the getting ready to go through the food line or coming out i reached up and tapped her but uh we love you and and forgive us for not mentioning it in the service april had a birthday and i also wanted to mention that two of our streamers had birthdays this week and they're significant and since they're not here to frown i can tell you how old they are and i might get in trouble later but on friday of this week uh sister elfrida on friday we had two very special birthdays from streamers one is sister alfreda's sister lydia and uh she is a faithful streamer and a faithful supporter of this ministry and she turned 86 on friday and the strength of the lord is upon her he's upon her and he's helping her i want you to know that she believes in the power of prayer and when she has a need she sends it through sister elfrida and she get make sure that that we're helping her pray and you know the lord moves he moves sometimes he moves almost immediately once we all get to praying and i'm thankful but what about this one same day last friday is sister eurdis's birthday how many of you remember sister yordis from norway would you like to guess how how young she turned 96 96 and she's she may be streaming i can't see if she's streaming this morning but likely she is she has been streaming a lot lately and you know that's the grace of god to still be going strong doing the best you can at 96 and uh we've had wonderful times with sister yordis so god bless them both today is sister kate danes birthday so we send our happy birthday greetings and love to sister kate in florida and right beneath the camera there just dropping right down from the camera is uh luke jovich and today is his birthday and i don't have a i don't have a number down but it's his birthday anyway happy birthday luke and then on tuesday that little one is sitting right off of his right shoulder there he has a birthday caleb john has a birthday on tuesday how old are you going to be caleb six years old my that's pretty significant six years old then wednesday r.j and miss emily have a wedding anniversary so we want to say happy anniversary to them and then on thursday of this week our oldest daughter olivia has a birthday how old are you going to be 18. how did that ever happen god bless you happy birthday let's stand for the word let's thank god for these amazing gifted musicians who give so much of themselves for camp meeting and for every service on friday october uh the 29th we are going to have a youth banquet here and more information will be given and that is uh let me see if i've got that date right no yes yes friday october 29th i announced last sunday and i told the days and we had this little exchange and nobody nobody you hear me nobody said pastor what month but listen at how everyone approached me later in the week you didn't tell us what month and i didn't you're absolutely right but i blame you just like i blame myself if one person would have said one month then i would have remembered but it was my fault and i apologize for that and now we don't have to say next month this month friday october the 29th the banquet is for young people 13 years old and above and they those who are putting the banquet together are not inviting small children to this one event we don't ever have any event like that so that some of the young married couples can also come without their children so that means uh we need babysitters that's how quiet it gets we need oh papa's he's volunteering i don't know about mimi she's she paw paul's volunteering i'll tell you what just yours or all [Music] he said so that is uh and there are some times and some invitation cards or whatever then on saturday night all day saturday the young people will be fellowshipping together with a volleyball and a breakfast there's going to be a big breakfast here on saturday morning the 30th and then on saturday night the 30th is going to be a youth service everyone is invited regardless of your age regardless of your marital status everyone is invited to the youth service that night and then again sunday morning brother dwayne jackson is going to be coming from ruth north carolina he's going to give his testimony at the banquet he's going to be preaching the youth service on saturday night and preaching to all of us on sunday morning so i'm excited about it i believe the lord is going to bless our young people and it's something special that we can all do for them are you with me amen all right let's turn in our bibles to isaiah chapter 10 and verse 27 isaiah 10 verse 27 and if you ladies while i'm starting i don't know if you can do it at the same time or not but i just realized that i failed to mention to you all that on last the last document that's dated for that wednesday night did you all look at it there are a few scriptures and a few quotes that i highlighted and i said added so if you can find a way to get those thrown in there uh while you're sh i don't even know if you can do it at the same time or not that's on me and i'm sorry that i forgot to mention to you i highlighted it in yellow and and put uh added with today's date on there and if something happens that we can't get it again that's on me and not on you all isaiah chapter 10 and verse 27 and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing i want to read it again and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing let's look at that in the amplified before we pray in the amplified it reads a little differently and it shall be in that day that the burden of the assyrian now when you are reading about the assyrian in in the in the prophetic scriptures you will find that it is also a type of the antichrist or the antichrist spirit so when we're looking at this in the amplified we know specifically whose burden it is who is it that is uh putting this burden on the on the neck of god's people and it is the assyrian but it is a reference to antichrist it shall be in that day that the burden of the assyrian shall depart from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck the yoke shall be destroyed because of fatness now that word fatness is the original word for anointing which prevents it from going around your neck god is saying that he is going to so increase the anointing on his children in that day that their necks are going to swell with prosperity that fatness is oil it's not just talking about blubber it's talking about oil and his oil is going to be so mightily increased on their lives that their necks will be enlarged and there will the yoke that has bound them in the past will not be able to contain the oil of god on their neck which speaks of shoulders and government and authority in his people it's a pretty powerful promise isn't it lord jesus we come to you today knowing that you have not left us here for such a time as this without a strategy to overcome you have anointed us with oil fresh oil green oil that comes from the squeezing of the olive the freshest and the purest of the oil you saved the best for last you have strengthened us for standing for running for climbing for pressing in to the kingdom of god you have not left us starving you have not left us destitute you have not left us dry and dead and without spirit life but you have provided hallelujah you have provided everything we need to be anointed for such an hour for such a time for such a difficult season as the one we're walking in in the earth right now but we are well prepared because as our brother told us today the i am is in us we are a part of the i am and so all that he is all of that anointing and all of that fatness of the messiah the anointed one every bit of that has been poured out upon our heads and if we will depend on what you've gifted us if we will depend on what you have provided for us there is not one thing that we cannot overcome in this hour so today lord let your word talk to us as we study together for a few moments let it talk to us let it inspire us and instruct us let us be prepared to face whatever we have yet to face we know there's nothing new under the sun but we know that evil has increased and we know that freedom is diminishing and so we must look to you lord in this hour in ways that we have never looked to you before knowing that your grace is always sufficient for every trial that we face give us grace today to study your word and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the church said again amen you may be seated would you turn in your bible if you have it there because this is a portion of scripture that specifically describes the hour and the season and the church age that we are living in and though we're going to put it up here on the screen it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to be able to find it in your own printed bible and so if you have it i invite you to go to revelation chapter 3. we're going to look together for a few moments at the characteristics of the last church age and we are finishing up by the grace of god today or tuesday night one of the two on the anointing to overcome anything and i was blessed of the lord to be able to start the meeting off and then to sit back and watch god unfold himself to brother brooks i i was so blessed he had just a title just the title the theme of the camp meeting but i loved how every message that he brought laid on the on the one he just brought it just was lying upon line upon line upon line and i'm thankful for the blessing of being able to go back and hear some of it already this week i'm not quite finished but i intend to go back and hear every one of those messages again i assure you they're nothing but the truth if you believe that you can squeeze out an amen here revelation 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodicean's right these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god how many of you know that's the lord jesus christ the beginning of the creation of god he said i know thy works that thou art neither cold or hot i would thou art cold or hot put your finger there just a minute now if there should be anyone listening to this this morning or in the future that doesn't understand where we are on those seven churches of asia minor let me just remind you that there are several different applications of those words of instruction that are given to those churches first and foremost those seven churches of asia minor were literal contemporary churches of their day they existed in building and in congregation they existed with individual government but under the leadership of anointed pastors and apostles who would visit those churches and pour ministry and life into them in what was a very difficult time can you say amen i mean this was an hour where the church was being tried and men and women of god were being singled out for great persecution and so they needed an anointing in that hour to overcome the spirit of their age which was of course a part of the ephesian church age now every one of those churches has a name and to every one of those churches there was a sign an angel and every one of those angel messengers we can look at that with a literal application and we can say that god was speaking through the pastor to those churches no doubt at all and we see that there was great great difficulty in that time but we also know by revelation that those seven churches beginning with ephesus and ending with laodicea are not just instructions or descriptions of seven literal churches that existed all at the same time in the second temple period but they are also descriptive of church ages of history so literal church and also church ages periods of history where those particular descriptions of what was in the church literally in that hour also become descriptions of ages of history where all of the hindrances that those literal churches were going through in the same day as those ages would unfold we saw that that same prevalent spirit predominant spirit became the spirit of the age for instance if it was lukewarmness in the literal church then as that age unfolded in history the spirit of lukewarmness became predominant in that entire age now we we have we have some interpretations and understandings of how long these church ages lasted but we also know that they lapped over one another and so we may not be able we can give you what we have but we may not be able to pin it down to a definitive moment where one church age came to an end and another church age began now this is more more important than what a lot of people realize because in order to overcome in your age you've got to know what you're dealing with somebody said well lord knows i sure do know what i'm dealing with if anybody knows what they're dealing with i guess i do but you also have to see what has been given as the remedy to overcome it was given to those seven literal churches of asia minor in their day and it has been a sign to every one of those church ages now when we get to laodicea the seventh of those ages we see a culmination of all of the evil all of the darkness all of the wickedness that each of those church ages suffered now are dealt with now it has culminated or consummated into the last of the seven church ages and it has become the most wicked it has become the darkest it has become the most evil the description of that last day church age is very very sad that's what we're reading right now but it was in that last church age somewhere from pentecost all the way up to the rapture not sure uh every little specific date or moment or or just where laodicea ends and a bright age begin not knowing all of those details definitively we are able to recognize that with every evil that has culminated into the last church age god has also provided a way to escape a way to overcome the spirit of the age and those who overcome the spirit of the age of laodicea are in fact overcoming the spirit of all the other six church ages as well so if you can survive and then overcome in laodicea you've not just overcome the enemy and the predominant spirit in laodicea but you've gone all the way back to the beginning because all of them have marched against the church in this last church age but look what god did he said in that last church age i am going to provide the most light when it's the darkest it has ever been out there i'm going to make it shine brighter in my people than it has ever shown before are you with me now listen it's not always about yelling it's not always about shouting it's not always about spitting and sputtering sometimes it's about teaching just a moment making sure we understand what we're facing in this hour so if you read what the church of ephesus was dealing with and you go all the way through the list to laodicea you will understand that that spirit just gets darker darker darker darker as it comes up to the age that we're living in but oh listen church god did not leave us here groping in the darkness of the church ages no sir he provided a light he provided a word of deliverance and an overcoming anointing for his bride in this church h2 not just the first few but in all of them he has made a way to escape if you believe that i want you to say amen i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wort cold or hot i want you to be one or the other all right let's go on so then because thou art look warm now what does that mean it's not cold it's not hot it's kind of tipid or tepid it's room temperature i want you to know that there are people who can't drink cold water i like it cold i don't like it room temperature i can drink it but i can drink a whole lot more water if it's cold i know they say it's not good for me and you shouldn't do that and all that but i've i've just i've just experienced that if i've got to drink a lot if i've got to get a lot down i need a little coolness to it i can stand there and drink it a whole lot more when it's not lukewarm i immediately remember working in the in the fields digging sweet potatoes or whatever we were digging at the time with my grandparents we didn't have yetis didn't know what yetis were we didn't have those coolers that they have now that you can put a bag of ice in and have it for three days nothing like that we just had mason jars and uh big ones we had some big ones big old gallon jars and they would put water in it in the morning we didn't have ice maker either but they would use up their plastic butter tubs and containers like that and they would make ice and they would take an ice pick because you didn't you you know you didn't they didn't my grandparents didn't have ice trays that you could just flip out those beautiful little uh you know even little ice cubes no no no you just turned it out of a butter tub and then you went to work with it with an ice pick you know that is messy you have ice everywhere you got water everywhere you've got a genuine mess every jug was filled almost to the top and then some of those big old pieces of ice out of the butter tub were were put in in it and uh the lid was secured and a big old towel some big old fluffy towel was used to wrap around those jugs and off to the field we were sent for us it was fun we didn't quite realize that there was so much work involved it felt almost like a camping trip and here we go with our jugs of water and our towels and whatever else we had and you get out there and first break was always the best because you were sent out with leftover biscuit from breakfast they were still just a nice temperature you stopped you got a you got a bite or two of a biscuit and you drank cold water now the ice had melted some the the towel was now good and wet how many of you know what that come in handy for you lay that towel on the back of your neck and it starts cooling you down because by 11 o'clock in south alabama it was already very very hot even in early fall digging sweet potato time it was already very very hot and you needed the moisture of that jug sweating to lay that on the back of your neck then you have lunch at whatever time one o'clock or something like that you have lunch and if it was packed then you ate right out in the field if it wasn't you went back to the house but about three o'clock in the afternoon you'd have another water break and another bite of your biscuit if you if you kept any of that in a a rag or napkin or something you'd have another body of that and uh that water i don't care how many towels it was wrapped in ice is gone most of the sweating of the jug is gone and that water is hardly fit to drink but you're thirsty and you take a big old sip of it and it is lukewarm it it it's really getting toward warm no real coolness to it at all and if you're hot and you're sweaty and you work pretty hard you pour that down and you can't my i can hear my granddaddy now don't drink too much just enough to wet your whistle don't drink too much you know why because we would just guzzle it and as soon as that warm water would go down into our stomach as hot as we were our temperature so hot our skin so hot it would go down if we drank too much and hit that stomach and i want you to know within just a few seconds you could really feel sick what did it that luke warm water hitting your your belly with all that uh overheatedness you know that you're going through all around you you put that warm water on your belly and the next thing you know you're back to work and i this only happened to me a few times but it started churning just like you'd eaten something that you shouldn't eat so i have no problem understanding that the word that is used here is only used one time in greek only used one time in the old testament in the new testament and it doesn't mean i will politely turn my head and let this water dribble out of my mouth it doesn't mean that i will like a man would spit in a spittoon i will just just spit that water up the word is translated vomit and it means to expel what you have taken into your stomach with violent force so anybody that's a parent here you have experienced projectile vomiting everybody's hungry now you jesus is saying i can stand it if you're hot i can stand if you're cold but the problem with this church age is she's neither hot nor is she cold and when i take that in it so disturbs my system that all i want to do is vomit that out of my mouth and so jesus is saying to first the literal church in laodicea and more importantly for us to the entire church age that we are living in right now because you're not hot because you're not cold but because you exist in a lukewarm condition i will vomit you i will expel you from my mouth and i don't know about you but that doesn't sound like something i want jesus to do concerning my life he's saying i will push you out and i don't know exactly if you get it or not but we want to be as close to him in this last church age as we can possibly get and we want him drawing us but in this case he's not saying i'm going to draw you in your lukewarm condition in fact he's saying i'm going to push you away i'm going to vomit you out of my mouth are you with me now let's read on and catch the next verse so because thou sayest i am rich this is the first church age in history to say i am rich i am increased with goods i have need of nothing and you know not that you are wretched you are miserable you are poor you are blind you are naked i want you to know that's an indictment against the church of laodicea and against those who experience the laodicean church age their testimony is we are more prosperous than we have ever been stay with me church our buildings are larger our programs are more successful we even have coffee shops we have all the things that any other social club would have we have need of nothing we have more money for missions and we have more money for this and we are increased with goods we have everything that we've ever needed and jesus is saying you don't even know you testify i'm rich you don't even know you're poor you testify that you are increased with goods but you're wretched and you're miserable and you don't even know it this is not an indictment against the world or the secular life this isn't an indictment against the last day church the church of the last day the denominational system that prevails in the last hour now you may not know it but we are living in the last of the last days and this is the condition of the modern church just a moment i'll help myself amen brother this is the description of the modern church we have to have three services a day three services a sunday and we don't we even have to tell people hold back on your giving sometime i don't know if they do that or not because we are so rich and we have everything we need of this is jesus talking and he said you don't even know that you're wretched you are miserable you are poor you are blind you are naked i don't know about you but that doesn't sound like a commendation that doesn't sound like a trophy that's about to be handed out it sounds like an awful indictment against a religious bunch of people if you're with me say amen i sure wished you were if you're not i hope you'll get there in a moment and jesus said i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire if you want to be rich let me talk to you about your riches your riches needs to be gold that you've gotten from me gold that has been tried in the fire not filthy lucr come on now not not not turning the church into a business but if you want to have some riches here it needs to be gold that has been tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that you may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness i i want you to see how apropos it is that the last day church is the only church and the only church age that is rebuked for for being immodest and not only immodest naked you're just naked and i want you to know you may not agree but we're not just talking spiritually here we're talking to a church that has so lost its vision and so cast off restraint that they fill up their social media with bikinis my social media is filled up right now with precious young men that we watch grow up and and their date for the for the prom looking like hoochie i'm thinking to myself what kind of mom and daddy is going to send a warm-blooded young man off to a prom with a with a uh uh a young lady who looks like that she looks like she's just wallowed in out of the bedroom you can say amen or oh me there's nothing left to the imagination and this is the condition of the modern church she's not only spiritually naked and has not covered up her unrighteousness with his his righteousness but she has cast off restraint and there is such an out there such a a a spirit of immodesty that is prevailing in the last day church so much so that anybody who opposes that's made fun of are you with me anybody that stands to cover up their bodies in this hour is referred to as being legalistic but surely there's got to be something in between naked and a nun surely there can be a balance for godly people to have a godly testimony in the wicked hour that we're living in he said i've got some clothing to give you and we know what that clothing is the robe of his righteousness and i want to cover up your spiritual nakedness i'd like to help you with some of your natural nakedness too i believe he's saying and anoint your eyes with i save that thou mayest see did you know here's the problem they're all of these things and they can't see it they can't recognize it they don't even know it and jesus is saying i can give you some ointment for your eyes but when i do your eyes are going to pop open and you're going to see that instead of rich you're poor instead of increased in goods and prosperity you're really naked and blind and wretched and without hope i talk about an eye-opener this is an eye-opener and when a message like this comes to the modern church she hardly has the faith to receive such a message as this it's not prosperity it's not positive thinking are you with me it's not osteen enough and so the church of this hour has a hard time recognizing when a message comes like that to dress her and to open her eyes and to help her to recognize her real condition she usually puts up all of her her blocks and and and her barricades and her barriers and she says i don't want anything to do with that and it's a very sad reality in the hour we live in if you know that and believe that same man but he said as many as i love this is jesus jesus is love how many of you know he is love jesus loves the sinner how many of you know he loves the sinner oh yes and he's not ashamed to be seen with the sinner he's not ashamed to take the lowly path of those who are deprived to those who are depraved to those who have fallen and who have yielded themselves to sin but listen the same jesus says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten is this red letter in your bible look and see this is red letter if you've got a red letter edition this is the words of jesus this isn't the preacher talking this isn't an apostle talking this is the savior talking the one who so loved the church that he gave his life to redeem her no man ever paid such a price for the church as jesus did and if anybody has gained the right and the privilege to bring correction to that church that he died for jesus has and he said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and do what repent he's not talking to the sinner he's not talking to the unrelieved he's talking to his church so even the church of god needs to repent and recognize that we have stepped off the path even in this house we have the need to come back and say lord i have confused things along the way i've missed the path that you have chosen for me and so i'm going to be zealous not to labor my way into the kingdom but i'm going to be zealous to repent my way into the kingdom of god what a glorious privilege is given to us in repentance if you believe that's amen behold listen behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me can you help me to see can you help me to discover what door it is that jesus is knocking on in the reference here this is not knocking on our heart this is what the church has said the bible doesn't say he's knocking on the door of our heart this is jesus knocking on the door of his own church he's speaking to laodicea he's speaking to a church that has put him out and he said behold i stand at the door and not if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me he's talking to the church that has put him on the outside now is it true that by the spirit of conviction jesus knocks on our heart and calls us to repentance absolutely so but the church has taken this verse and casually placed it on the salvation experience because they don't want to deal with the reality of the context and the context is i have been shut out of my own church help me she's got all kinds of programs my name is on the door it's all about me they say and yet they have been without me so long that they don't even recognize i'm not in them i'm not with them anymore i'm standing on the outside of a locked door and i'm knocking to come into my church to sup with my own people to have fellowship with those who say they wear my name very very serious indictment and i know you already know this can we read on just a moment here is there another verse there's not another verse 21 i'm thinking yeah let's do 21. it should be in the original in the original document we had 21. give us just a moment to him that overcometh here he's talking about a church that's mistaken in her own identity she says i'm this and jesus says you're none of that you're something entirely different than what you have testified we're talking about a church where jesus says i'm actually knocking on the outside you want to find me you can't find me around the altar you can't find me in your revival meeting you can only find me at the door you put me out brother branham said it's jesus sitting in the corner just like he was in the end of his life in the gospels invited to a party invited to a gathering and yet he came in and there was no one to wash his feet come on there was no one to anoint his head or anoint his feet or welcome him to the party until this prostitute comes in think about it a fallen woman a woman who had a reputation of living with with all kinds of men and servicing all kinds of men and her reputation was well known and any money that she made was not made from from virtuous work it was made from prostitution and yet she comes in and she wants to worship the lord and as soon as she begins to break her heart open before the lord and wash his feet and anoint his feet and dry his feet with the hairs of her head which again is another story [Music] i know you're having a hard time don't have a hard time have a good time come on have an easy time get with me and let's see if we can go somewhere here's a modern church that could not even fulfill this kind of a thing because she's chopped her hair off she wanted to look so much like a man that she she's chopped her hair off so that she could look like a man and how in the world would that woman representing the church be able to dry his feet with her butch haircut it's absolutely impossible you can say amen oh me or we don't you know it's still the truth so far away here's a prostitute because in this hour even the ungodly all women they knew that it was a virtue for some the only virtue they had to keep uncut hair here's this woman not missing her opportunity to do what everybody in that party should have been doing all the guests there should have been honoring his presence and welcoming him there but she was the only one that saw the value in his presence she was so glad that she had this opportunity that she pressed in without an invitation she wasn't invited to this social event but she passed and saw him going in and she said i must go and worship him i've got to show my thanks giving my thankfulness and my gratitude to him and that is what she did and wasn't that a rebuke and here the disciples raised up don't you know don't you know they're all talking all over whispering all don't you know what kind of woman that is can they see what kind of woman he's going to ruin his sterling reputation by rubbing around with a woman like that oh she's touching his feet and jesus said i came in here and nobody bid me welcome nobody anointed my head nobody anointed my feet and this woman has unceasingly done these things since she arrived and jesus was putting greater value on her dedication to him than all of those that had invited him to the party to draw a crowd so they could have a higher esteem in the community they didn't really want him there listen the church of today the modern church of today would be better off if he wouldn't bother them at all they're using his name as a way to draw but they have unwelcomed his presence you don't have to say anything they've unwelcomed his presence so he's either in the corner with dirty feet or lucked out of the church altogether knocking on the door of his own house i don't know about you but i don't like the idea of somebody locking me out of my own house we once had a tenant in jerusalem who wanted to lock us out of our own house that is a tough feeling it's hard to get past that one you're really going to want to throw somebody out on their head when out of the goodness of your heart you're allowing someone to stay somewhere their time is up now it's time for them to go and they let you know i have no intention of leaving your home now that's that gets serious this happened to us not not just once in israel happened to us twice and both times the lord prevailed and made a way and so forth and we got the keys to our own house back i want you to know it's a pretty uh awful feeling to think you're being locked out of your own house and jesus is standing outside of his own church in this hour knocking to get in nothing could be a sadder picture than this and he immediately moves i hope you're with me he immediately moves from this very sad description of the last day church and speaks to the overcomer watch this to him that overcometh overcometh here's jesus locked out here's jesus shut out here here's a church that thinks she's this when in reality she's something else and then all of a sudden jesus has a message for those who overcome to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne this is the promise to the overcomers of laodicea let me ask you are there any overcomers here this morning is there anybody here that by the grace of god and by the anointing of the flying eagle you have every intention of being one of those who overcomes the spirit of this age and all the other ages culminated into this hour you plan to sit with him in his throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne this may be disputable but some have said that this is the greatest honor that is promised to the overcomer of any age so far that he saved the highest position of authority for those who overcome the darkest and the most evil of all ages for to them it is granted that they would sit with him in his throne even as he sat as he overcame and sat down with his father in his throne is there another verse there or are we at the end of that chapter he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that hath an ear would you read that with me he that hath an ear again he that hath an ear it's a powerful phrase and it's a repeated phrase and if you want to jot this down revelation 2 7 says he that hath an ear revelation 2 11 he that hath an ear revelation 2 17 he that hath an ear revelation 2 29 he that hath an ear revelation 3 6 he that hath an ear revelation 3 13 he that hath an ear revelation 3 22 he that hath an ear it sounds to me like that one of the keys to overcoming anything that the enemy launches against you is to have an ear to hear what the spirit says to the church i said it seems to me like that it's a key having an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to the church did you know everybody doesn't have that spiritual ear to discern what the spirit of the lord is saying to his church in the last days may god grant you in our grace to be one of those who has an ear to hear what the spirit is saying now in a message turn on the light if you'll show me that one please 1964. he said remember this is the seventh church age the laodicean church age according to revelation 3 they reject christ you can't change the continuity of the word this church age has rejected christ of every church age that was mentioned in the bible now here is a disputed fact in fact i've had someone here in the church dispute this when i have said it before in the past when i mention that laodicea is the worst of the age ages i've had someone raise up and say well i don't think it's any worse than any of the other ages we look back at those who were slaughtered and murdered and stood and so forth i'm just telling you what the scriptures is showing us here and what the message of the hour is showing us laodicea age was worst of all of them and here's why it turned him out it rejected him it put him on the outside so jesus is standing outside the modern church in the laodicean church age are you with me and then in the message turn on the light let's look at it 1964 turn on the light same message but a little bit a little bit uh closer to the beginning of the message he said but the thing is today the church grain don't want to mature it wants to stay like it was back in moody's time sankey finney knox calvin they were all right they were the light of the hour this is powerful this is the period of the reformers it's the age of the man and god was faithful in that church age to have a man like a moody a man like a finney a man like a knox a man like a calvin he said they were all right they were the light of the hour we could say they were the light of their hour but this is another hour this is another day now look at this this phrase this is the advancement of the gospel i'm telling you that's a powerful message the gospel the good news has come to a higher level there has been an advancement in the gospel why because it's coming to its maturity we could say based on that phrase that it's getting ready to produce a mature harvest he said so we can't live in what luther said to say i'm i'm lutheran but then you're only part of the way there we can't live in what luther said somebody said well i'm wesleyan you can't live only in what wesley said or some of the rest of them we're living in the light that's predicted or we could say prophesied for this day so what we do is we take the truth of luther and we take the truth of wesley and we take the truth of pentecost and we let it sit in the light that has been prophesied for this day and then we apply it to our life and when we do that it releases an anointing to overcome anything that the enemy would launch against you i am anointed to overcome anything not because i'm anything but because the one who anoints me see this is the hour where the yoke is destroyed this is the hour where god brings forth the people and he fills them with the fatness of his anointing yes it's the oil of his glory and it causes her neck her strength to be renewed is anybody with me the neck represents the strength of the man not not what some of you sisters say one who i'm one who's streaming right now particularly comes to mind who just recently said this to me and it just make made me laugh real good because we all know that we all know that the man is a is the head of that house but i just loved it how the little sister said this she said oh yes he's the head of the house but you know i'm the neck see how quiet it gets there's some big old necks in this house what was she saying what what are people saying when they say that let me mean it i just turn the head down the neck i just turned why this is bible somebody said what do you mean is bible i didn't say the bible says it's right but the bible tells us what a woman can do and how she can lead a man right this is not the neck i'm talking about this isn't the female neck or is it it's the bride's neck it's the strength of the lord it's the fatness of the lord one version said it's the prosperity of the lord upon her and it causes her neck to be so large that the yoke that oh my i like this that the yoke that once enslaved her can no longer contain her because of the blessing and the anointing and the oil of the lord the fatness of the lord that's being poured out on her is anybody with me all right good now it's time to refresh it's 12 57 we have just a little bit of time left i want us to look again at the summary i want us to look again at the summary of the end time for just a moment we looked at this just a few weeks ago it's questions and answers question number 392 the church age ending and has blacked out the bride is called we have already entered into the tribulation period question mark someone is assuming when you assume you venture without authority someone has been sitting in these anointed messages that brother branham has been preaching and he has placed them by that anointed word into heavenly places in christ jesus come on i've been there i've been sitting in my home when the prophet placed me in heavenly places in christ jesus by the word he was preaching i could feel myself being lifted up and strengthened and encouraged by the anointed word of god so someone has been under the influence of the message that brother branham has been preaching and they are assuming that by what he is saying we have already entered into the tribulation period now i want you to see what brother branham's answer is it's pretty emphatic no no no i wished that i could just have more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease now if we were really studying this and had all kinds of time and you were really pulling this morning we could take a moment here and we could balance out these different statements that the prophet made concerning the ending of laodicea and the beginning of a bright age and i can show you places where he seemed to indicate that the rapture would be the beginning of the bright age and i can show you places where he be where he seemed to indicate that once the message catches you out of the church not the bride out of the earth but once the message catches you out of the church the bright age has already began for you but we're not going to have the time to lay i have them or they're here but i'm not going to take the time to balance those out for you this morning when you might not yet be interested in hearing that but here he says when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease and he goes on laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for this is important if you have any interest in end time events this next statement is very important for three and a half years there is no more seven year tribulation ahead of us at the time of rapture there will only be three and a half years of tribulation left the week has been divided for us and the first part of that week has been fulfilled during the early ministry of the lord jesus christ so we are not looking for a seven year tribulation period now can anybody see the year can you can you look there and see the year 1964. it doesn't get any later than that except 65. so i don't care what you might read in other places or here in other places this is how brother branham was teaching the end time concerning the tribulation period if you go to the assembly of god or the church of god or the baptist or methodist or some other groups you will find them still preaching very strongly that there will be another seven year tribulation period and that's simply because they've missed the fact that the week was divided by the ministry of the lord jesus christ it has been fulfilled every bit of it is going to have its fulfillment but we're looking for the three and a half years left while israel is getting its prophecy now that's the ministry of who the two witnesses and the 144 thousand that are sealed for that purpose then tribulation sets in upon israel then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things that's pretty serious isn't it you really believe this one day you really believe the events are going to unfold like this oh i do i do i do i believe they're unfolding now i believe they're unfolding now it's an unpopular message but i believe they're unfolding now and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennium reign after that comes the white throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and new earth and the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together now i'm going to bring that quotation to you often any time that we start talking about end time events i want to bring that back in front of you because i want you always to have a reference for the order of things to come i hear people saying stupid things i hear people saying stupid things such as why it doesn't matter how all this is going to come it doesn't matter how at all i'm going to be there as long as i'm there i'm going to go jesus is going to be all right now this is a stupid statement to make it's how quiet it's going to get in here i'm not calling you stupid you know better that's what makes it so bad when people make statements like that then you're actually denying the word because the lord went to a whole lot of trouble to get you and i the revelation of jesus christ listen john paid a prize boiled in oil banished to patmos where he had to live under the threat of wild beasts and thieves that had been banished there for their punishment he could have been murdered at any time then he was boiled in oil first you know boiled in oil like a french fry who's ever heard of being fried in oil and having no effect on your body god was preserving him but it cost him something he's the only one of those disciples who went out into punishment like that and came back to live to tell about it and the greatest portion of his ministry took place after he had overcome the oil and after he had overcome the isle of patmos and he preserved this word god was speaking to him about end time events and he preserved this word for us in fact some of it had to be sealed up until a very special moment in time when god was going to lose that and then a generation ago god sent a prophet who could capture the mind of god and who could help us to understand what was underneath those things and as brother brooks preached while he was here the the understanding of every symbol every symbol in the book of revelation we now have understanding of what that represented what that type was what that symbol was how many of you know we're blessed oh people we're blessed to have heard what we have heard we are blessed and so look at all the sacrifices that were made to help you and i in the end time know what was going to unfold in our hour so don't tell me it doesn't matter don't tell me it doesn't matter how how you're baptized the bible says it does don't tell me it doesn't matter if god's one or god's three the bible said it does somebody said i don't think doctrine matters much at all i want you to know you're very very deceived if you make such a statement like that because without sound doctrine we are like ships without a sail we're just floating along on the sea of life but because god gave a revelation of jesus christ which is not just a doctrine it's an eternal truth come on now we need to know it we need to see it we need to be able to understand it as much as possible we need to prepare for it and we need to tell our family you're about to see some things unfold on planet earth don't be surprised this is how it's going to go so to say that having an understanding of the end not having an understanding of the end time is okay it's like saying i don't need a revelation of jesus christ because the revelation of jesus christ is who he is in this hour and at every hour to come it's what he was then what he is today jesus christ the same what yesterday today and forever so don't make statements like that because you've perhaps in the past been confused or bored some of you are bored with me but i don't have the i don't have the privilege of saying okay what does it matter no matter the board so let's just go in and not not worry with that we have to worry with it whether you have a near to hear it or not because it's our obligation to bring this to your attention because we know there's going to be overcomers in the last day and so he goes on time and eternity will blend together now i want to read a quotation before we go from the church age book and i'm not going to go into all of my explanations of what i how i feel about the church age book i'm just going to tell you that i've read these very very carefully and i believe them to be based right on the word so this is from the sardisian church age and it says see this this scripture by the way i mean this quotation by the way is directly referencing revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne see the bride is with him in the throne would you say in the throne in the throne and she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in the judgment with him there's a powerful statement coming here that is exactly what daniel saw now he goes on and this was in the uh i gave you this this morning so i don't know if you found it or not because i stopped there in the original but then i decided i wanted to go on and finish this paragraph and he quotes daniel 7 you should see it there 9-10 i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened and i've just read from daniel 7 verses 9 and 10 and then the quote continues see it is the same scene first he has spoken about the overcomers sitting with jesus in his throne then he takes us to daniel to the ancient of days then he ties the two together by saying see it is the same scene for the thousand thousands who are ministering to him are the bride this powerful truth churches weren't teaching any connection between the bride sitting with jesus in his throne and the ancient of days and those thousands times ten thousands of men of those who were ministering to him so brother branham is bringing us some revelation here he said for those who are ministering to him are the bride for who ministers to the husband but the wife and you won't worship the lord when you have an opportunity to help me you won't push in a little bit and raise your hands and really minister do you understand that when we worship the lord as we did this morning we are ministering to him and do you understand that this is going to be a part of our daily existence throughout the 1 000 years of millennium we are going to sit with him in his throne judging the nations and ministering to him with our praise somebody said that sounds like the most boring eternity i can imagine well that's because it's been too long since you've had a moment in the presence of the lord if you've had a moment in the presence of the lord you will understand that you become the beneficiary you are offering your praise to him and you are receiving the benefit you are receiving strength and the glory of the lord is strengthening your neck so that no yoke the devil forms against you will be able to bind you and hold you back and you're really ministering your own deliverance when you worship the lord and when you praise the lord you're really ministering your own deliverance that's why you'll see people refusing to praise him because they're not interested in deliverance they're not looking for deliverance they're looking for something else once people understand the significance of entering into the presence of the lord and pouring your praise on him you forget about what other people are doing [Music] i'm telling you they could be slapping you upside the head with a banner [Music] and you are so lost in what you're doing they could be turning cartwheels across the front and you're not sitting there saying look at that soulish manifestation look at them they're in the flesh you're so lost in your ministry to the lord did you know some people would rather minister up here than they would rather minister to the lord i want you to know my survival is not based on what i do up here my survival is based on what i do just me and him when i take that moment to minister my praise to him and brother branham said the same scene we read about in revelation 3 21 it's the same scene we read about in daniel chapter 7 verses 9 and 10 because nobody will be able to minister to the husband like the wife just a moment hallelujah in the smernian church age the quotation starts off character look at it a moment character is a victory not a gift do you know what that means do you know that means you're gonna have to fight to have character you're going to have to fight to have integrity the character and integrity of jesus is not just going to fall on you the inspiration that you can have it will fall on you and then you're going to have to fight hell are you willing to fight hell you're going to have to fight hell to press in because it's one thing what you do in the spotlight it's another thing what you do when there's nobody but you and him that's that's how we know a man has integrity by what he does when no one is looking or what a woman does when no one is looking and brother branham wanted to make sure that we understood that though we are going to have the attributes and character of jesus christ it's not going to fall on us like ripe cherries from a tree it's going to require a warfare but we have the victory are you with me character is a victory not a gift we're nearly done a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic we see that in the new age but power with character is fit to rule you want to be fit to rule that's what you're called to do you might as well win the victory you might as well press into his character he goes on and since he wants us to share even his throne hallelujah this is a powerful invitation don't want you just to spend a thousand years on your face before my throne but i am inviting you to share my throne to sit with me in my throne as overcomers even as i overcome and have sat down with my father he said he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him then we have to overcome are you listening then we have to overcome then we have to overcome i am an overcomer why because i'm a part of i am he told us that this morning he could have preached an hour on that because i'm a part of i am because i am told me who i am because i choose to get my identity from i am that's right that's what these young people were singing about up here i doubt very seriously they've all had a glory week where nothing ever bothered them and nothing ever come against them and nothing you know dared come in their presence because they're a bunch of overcomers i've got a feeling that the enemy has probably fought them any way that he possibly could because they were getting up here bragging on jesus and the devil can't stand for you to brag on jesus in fact he'll turn it around and say well you're just bragging on yourself well i'm going to tell you something there's not many in this room who who are that that sad that you think you can do it without him i want you to know most of the people in this room understand that if we are to overcome it is only because the overcomer lives inside of us hallelujah then we have to overcome to sit with him are you there and the little oh it's going to get quiet watch watch watch watch watch i i mean how could it get more quiet and the little temporary suffering we go through come on let's get the little cup out so that we can drag the prison bars i was preaching from the bible now i'm preaching from lady and the let's get the cup out and let's drag the bars and let's sing like the hound dog nobody knows the trouble i've seen [Music] it's true but don't stop there most people who like to live like that what they really mean is nobody understands nobody cares nobody suffers like me nobody's had the hard time i've had if anybody else had had hardship like i have it maybe give up a long time ago come on now but the song don't stop but nobody knows the trouble i've seen it goes on to say nobody knows but jesus who else do you need to know who else do you need on your boat who else do you need guiding your life and sustaining you with strength and power let me tell you something you can't tell jesus something that he doesn't already know about your suffering and your hardship and it's true it's true we don't all suffer the same way it's true we don't all go through the same things but we all must suffer and we all must be tested and here's the problem when you look at mine you think i could sail through that when i look at yours i might be tempted to think hmm i wish that was all i had to deal with come on help me but the truth is they're tailor-made by a sovereign god who knows exactly what it's going to take to get me in his image can't god can't get upset with nobody else and you better not get bitter toward him you better say lord you give and you take away blessed be your name she ain't what i thought she was he ain't what i expected whoa i feel like preaching now but you knew what i needed hallelujah you can look at your wife an entirely different way you can look at your husband in an entirely different way you didn't need a bed of ease you needed a her you needed a hymn oh i wish my children were more like so until you oh honey where are you getting that instagram unless you've lived with them you don't know what they go through you don't know what they go through he picks them out for us he knows what we need to be challenged into his image he knows what we need to be perfected in his likeness he knows what we need to come forth in his character i'm almost done if you'll get with me i will be i'm so glad that he's in charge and the little temporary suffering we go through now listen folks i'm telling you right now if you will take that attitude i challenge you in the name of jesus take that attitude if you will take that attitude and take it again and take it again and take it again and take it again your suffering will accomplish what it was sent to do you can graduate and go into something else your trial that has been sent to perfect you you can pass that you graduate from that you can go on to your next lesson if you try to maintain the attitude that says the little temporary suffering that i'm going through right now it's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes you ask me preacher how is that possible you choose what you look at and if you choose to look at your suffering you'll see the seriousness of your suffering if you choose to look at the glory that's going to be revealed yes it'll be like assistance to get you to the next place you're not the exception to the rule we are the bride we're the body of christ we're making our way to the kingdom he said in this little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through [Music] are you willing are you willing now this is the last quotation it's also from the church age book if you're skimming through the book you'll find there are sectional headings there and this one is under the heading the overcomer's throne i want you to listen carefully to it because it's a powerful piece of writing it's inspirational and it's very very helpful and it comes from the laodicean church age section of the book the last the last church age it starts off with revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh while i grant to sit with me and my throne even as i also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne you should be able to find that because i actually put the heading there for you that's right thank you i put the heading there the overcomers throne because i love the way it sounds say that with the overcomer's throne i like it didn't say the overcomers tomb didn't say the overcomers ultimate defeat it said the overcomer's throne god's got a way to get you there you believe that musicians would you slip this way but leave your hearing ears on would you please as you come now what are we to overcome is that a good question what are we to overcome he said that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how you see our overcoming will be based on our trial and since all of our trials are not the same we can't boil it down to say what we all will overcome but we can look at how we are to overcome powerful powerful he said a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition i don't know what that is exactly in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame listen he overcame the personal temptations of satan how how by the word and and the word only how are you going to overcome by the word and by the word only can you remember that when you're in the heat of the battle when you're in the thick of the fight can you remember that can somebody help me remember can i help you remember can we help each other remember that even our lord was tempted this way and he overcame every temptation every personal temptation of satan by the word and by the word only that's that's powerful for me in each of the three major trials that correspond exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word powerful he fell to the personal temptation of satan by read it out for me i know you're tired [Music] by failing to use the word she had the word she was a product of the spoken word she had the word [Music] but something brighter caught her eye and what we find out is it was actually the promise of what was already promised she could have every bit of that by staying with the word but satan twisted that truth threaded through the serpent some discrepancy of the truth and it glittered it shined it shimmered it caught her eye she gave up everything she had to overcome by she gave that up so that she could take a hold of a false promise that would lead her away from the very thing that she was created to possess a piece of the tree of life it's really rather simple she fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word do you know what it means to directly disobey it means to disobey intentionally to know exactly what you are doing you are not seduced you are not deceived you know exactly what you're doing she fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word he fell in direct disobedience to the word because he had to be her covering the new testament tells us that he was not deceived but jesus overcame how by the word are you still here i'll give that to you tuesday night i guess because i had a had a verse that goes right along with that but let's go on and right now let me say that this is the only way let me say this is the only way let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail i love this i know this is dull for some folks but i love this and i'm going to tell you why because you can't trust your feelings to tell you that you're overcoming you can't trust your feelings to tell you you're overcoming when you're up singing with the group i'm an overcomer you probably feel like an overcomer good you should but when you go out there in that world and you're fighting hell and the devil breathing his hot breath on your neck you may not feel like an overcomer so you better not pull the feeling up you can't say now devil i felt god this morning hear me i really felt the anointing on that song and i really felt like an overcomer the enemy's going to say how do you feel now and you're going to say well now that you mentioned it i i'm not feeling too good right now your hot breath is going down my neck and i i'm toe to toe with my enemy and i i'm not feeling much like an overcomer let me tell you something it's not by feeling we're gonna make make this thing it's not by motion hallelujah whoa i just want to see somebody sister ronda i just want to meet somebody who is in the thick of it i mean it feels like looks like smells like they're going down for the last time but they've got the loudest praise i just want to meet a paul and silas i just want to meet somebody who is really going through it but you'd never be able to know it by their praise you'd never know it by their tude they keep the right attitude they walk in the right spirit they overcome by their praise listen if paul and silas did it i can if those men and women the scriptures written about if they were able to go through what they went through and keep their praise on keep their victory keep victory in their step somebody said i just feel like a hypocrite when i do that you ought to feel like a child of god there's nothing about a hypocrite we're not talking about putting on we're talking about getting touch with the god who's more than enough when you praise him you're not saying i got it i got it i got everything i'm i'm the one i'm it's about me when you praise him you're saying and none of it's about me it's all about him it's all about him it's all about him amen we've got to go home right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it's the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because that word can't fail because that word can't fail because that word can't fail hallelujah that word can't fail he said now notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word i when i wrote a subtitle for this section i in my notes i wrote that phrase he constantly applied the word he constantly applied the word that is not a passive action that is not something you do passively that is something that you do actively it's an act of your will to apply the word it's an act of your will it's an act of your faith to apply the word he constantly applied the word ben did you know jesus constantly applied the word no matter what he was going through he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak we're nearly done hallelujah there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god in his own personal life contending with himself oh oh my oh my now now that really dismisses the argument of a lot of people no wonder he overcame he was jesus well i know why he overcame i know why it was so easy for him to apply the word he was the word as though he got some automatic pass because of the duality of his nature well i want you to know if that's the case we don't have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities the reason why we know that we have a high priest touched with the feeling of our infirmities is because god condescended into the body and personal life of a man and who who experienced everything you and i experience come on now so his ability to overcome was not based on the fact that he came from god because you came from god too hello his ability to overcome in all things was directly attached to the fact that he constantly constantly constantly consistently perseverantly or with perseverance applied the word he applied the word he applied the word in his own personal life contending with himself how is that possible because his flesh pulled in one direction and his spirit life pulled in another direction no wonder he said oh the flesh is weak my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak i know what is ahead of me but but oh if it be possible let this cup pass from me he was contending with himself there's never been a greater example of how god and man were in direct conflict with one another while living in the same body we can understand what paul was going through because we understand what jesus was going through we can understand what each other is facing because we understand what jesus was going through i'm hurrying it just don't look like it and his own that's what happened you locked me up for a week in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience you just take the word you just take the word you just do what the word says do you apply the word and you obey the word you speak the word you apply the word you obey the word you speak the word you apply the word you obey the word come on now he overcame because he constantly applied the word don't you think we already know this sure i know you know it but the knowing and the practicing it is where we struggle we w.e me and you this is where we struggle i did not fall he overcame by obedience to the word of god one more paragraph in this i knew this would be long he said now then oh sorry so so sorry in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by the by by obedience to the word of god it's actually two paragraphs i was in the wrong place in hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard and was heard not because he was god but because he feared god jesus had his prayers heard not because he was god but because he feared god the first few times brother isaiah brooks said i worship the word i felt it in here i felt some of us what do you worship do you worship i love it i think it's a powerful statement i think it's full of revelation i worship the word don't you get your bible in your mind the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i worship the words powerful powerful powerful we apply the word we speak the word we believe the word we obey the word we surrender to the word and in the fact that he feared it's why his prayer was heard would you move on though he were a son yet learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him oh my goodness what was he obedient to would you read the next four words the word of god and this is the last paragraph now then there will not be one person who will sit on the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word this is where rubber meets the road this is where your talkie talkie and your walkie walkie have to line up this is the most difficult part of worshiping the word when it comes down to having a choice whether to obey the truth or not we must choose every time every single time to obey the word come on any time we're put in a position where we obey man or the word we must always are you with me we must always obey the word there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to god none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne so now what does that do for man's common response i've got to pray more got to read more got to fast more all those things are true we should pray more it's the one thing we can never do too much of he said pray we should pray more read we should read more not true life romance or word read the word yes we should read more fast yes we should fast more but even if you pray more read more and fast more that's not enough what you've really got to do is believe more somebody said how could you put it in the believing because you'll never obey it unless you believe it when you believe it you are duty duty-bound there's something in your heart that wants to surrender to what you know is soul when you see by grace of by eyes of faith and grace what what living this word can accomplish in your life you're going to want to get it right none of these things will grant you the privilege of sitting on the throne let's finish it will be granted only to the word bride the word the word the word the word is all you talk about the word the word the word the word the word the word it's the word bride as the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne do you see anything wrong with that statement nor do i thank you sister bonnie i think it's good too i'm going to read it again then it will be granted only to the word bride as the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne now just one question before we stand how does one become a part of that word by joining the church within which church would you join and what would you do in a church like this who has no membership if you had to join the church to be a part of that word you couldn't even do it here well be baptized it's essential obedience to christ and water baptism is essential it's vitally important in your experience with the lord but that's not how you become a part of that word repent and be baptized no come down here to the altar and accept the lord as your savior and then you can believe well listen folks that's how you recognize who you are it's when you begin to surrender your life but the truth is if you are ever going to be a part of that word you always were you can't change your eternal destination by saying a little prayer now if you think i'm off the scripture you better you better open up your bible and i just suggest you go to the book of hebrews and read it until you believe it and when you're done that's right go right over there to ephesians and read all of that too and if you can see yourself in any of that you ought to be okay because we have to obey that's what you can do you can do what your part by saying yes the bible said repent and be baptized that's what you do the bible tells us to to prefer christ to to live in obedience all of these things are things that we can do because we are a part of that word but the bible says that we were elected chosen in christ before the foundation of the world by the time you got here he already knew everything there was to know about you [Music] you can't get good enough to become a part of that word the only way that you can realize you're a part of that word is to receive the truth that god brings to you you can't take somebody else's truth you can't even survive on the truth of another age but when god allows you to recognize the day that you are living in and the word that has been sent to that day that is the grace of god by his election by his foreknowledge he has predestinated us are you saying brother that i don't have a choice no what i'm saying is he knew your choice and chose you before you could even choose him you chose him because he chose you oh do you believe that's not the word i believe the bible said i have cho you have not chosen me but i have chosen you why would he do such a thing it's because he knew the only way that you would be able to overcome in this wicked laodicean church age was to know by grace that you are a part of that word and that word is constantly working in you as you surrender to it to make you come forth in the overcomers anointing you are anointed to overcome anything and everything the enemy would launch against you in this hour but it is not by your success your success is by depending on his success let's stand he said little children i ride unto you that you overcome it's a message of instruction even as i have overcome [Music] how did he overcome by constantly applying the word how did brother branham overcome by constantly applying the word how are you and i going to overcome by constantly applying the word i apologize for your weakened condition this morning i somehow have warned you out i assume that because we had not had a service this week you'd come into the house of the lord refreshed but i will carry that it's on me but i had to deliver what i feel like the lord had laid on my heart we must we must we must overcome we must receive that anointing to overcome i want us to sing we've been made more than conquerors i want us to sing it like people who recognize that even without fighting you've won the prize hallelujah even even in your own strength you couldn't do it but by yielding to him you've already won you've already won how do we how do we secure that by staying in touch with the spirit by fellowshipping and applying that word amen we've been made more than conquerors we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this life [Music] you're not too tired to sing i noticed thank you so much sing again we've been made [Music] whoa that sounds good [Music] we've been made [Music] sing it sing it one more time we've been made we've been made more than conquerors hallelujah [Music] overcomers in this life hallelujah we've been [Music] give me a verse please [Music] hold on we're getting stronger every day there's no reason for you to go straight don't go leaning on your understandings [Music] you don't have to worry anymore [Music] overcomers in this life hallelujah we've been made victorious through the blood through the blood of jesus christ [Music] when trouble comes knocking on your doors don't be afraid you know it's not like before [Music] don't you be leaning on your understanding just lean on him and we'll all say we've been made more than conquerors hallelujah overcomers in this life oh hallelujah we've been made victories whoo through the blood would you lift up your heart and your hands to him and sing again we've been made we've been made by the blood of the lamb by the word of god [Music] in this life you can get through this with his help we've been
