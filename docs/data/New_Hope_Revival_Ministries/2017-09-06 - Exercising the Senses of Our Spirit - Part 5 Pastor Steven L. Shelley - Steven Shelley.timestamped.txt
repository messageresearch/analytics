[0:00] I
[0:00] [Music]
[0:46] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:51] cry I want to welcome you to the program
[0:53] today as we do each and every week and I
[0:56] want to tell you what a privilege I
[0:58] consider it to be to be able to come
[1:01] into your home or wherever you're
[1:02] watching this program either on the
[1:05] television or perhaps you're streaming
[1:07] on the world wide web you might even be
[1:09] watching it as a podcast or on a DVD but
[1:12] however you're connected with us today I
[1:16] certainly want to tell you I considered
[1:18] a privilege to be able to declare to you
[1:20] the good news that Jesus Christ is the
[1:24] same yesterday and today and forever he
[1:27] changes not and what he was able to do
[1:30] what he performed two thousand years ago
[1:33] when he walked the shores of Galilee in
[1:35] his earthly body I'm glad to know that
[1:38] he's still able to do the very same
[1:40] thing today in fact great miracles signs
[1:44] and wonders demonstrations of God's
[1:47] saving power and healing power are
[1:50] breaking out all over the world as you
[1:53] view this program today there is a great
[1:55] stirring in the earth shiftings in the
[1:58] heavenly places God's pouring out his
[2:01] spirit and I believe that we're gearing
[2:03] up for the manifestation of many of the
[2:06] things you've heard us teaching about on
[2:08] this program over the past few years and
[2:11] I just pray that you'll be able to enter
[2:13] right into the study with us today we're
[2:16] in a series on exercising our spiritual
[2:20] senses we've been speaking a lot about
[2:22] Adam last week we were really talking
[2:25] about the the development of the human
[2:28] spirit and how that by the new birth are
[2:31] our fallen spirit is being regenerated
[2:36] we have that promise when we are born
[2:38] again but it requires development and
[2:41] the exercising of our spiritual senses
[2:45] and we showed it to your right in the
[2:46] scripture in fact we're going to go back
[2:48] and look at that real quick before we
[2:50] move on
[2:50] into what we want to share today so
[2:53] please contact our ministry if you have
[2:55] any prayer requests that you'd like for
[2:57] us to join in faith with you and pray
[2:59] believing God for the answer please send
[3:01] the men all of the contact information
[3:04] is given to you on the screen and we
[3:06] would consider it a great privilege to
[3:08] be able to stand with you in this hour
[3:10] in prayer so let's look right to the
[3:12] Word of God today shall we do that we
[3:15] were reading I think the last verse of
[3:17] scripture that we were looking at one of
[3:20] the last was Revelation chapter 30 verse
[3:22] 21 and all of this kind of came out
[3:25] though of another interesting verse of
[3:29] scripture that I've ministered on many
[3:31] times over the years from the book of
[3:33] Hebrews and I don't think it would be a
[3:35] bad idea if we just went back and read
[3:38] that again Hebrews chapter five verse
[3:40] eight and nine we're speaking about the
[3:43] Ministry of Mashiach the Messiah the
[3:45] Lord Jesus Christ and the Apostle is
[3:48] speaking here in verse eight though he
[3:51] were a son it's indisputable that he was
[3:55] the son of God though he were a son yet
[3:59] learned he obedience by the things which
[4:03] he suffered he learned that total walk
[4:07] of surrendered obedience by the things
[4:11] that he suffered while in his earthly
[4:13] body verse 9 says and being made perfect
[4:18] again a process the process of
[4:22] perfection being made perfect he became
[4:26] the author of eternal salvation unto all
[4:30] them that obey Him the point that we
[4:32] were making and we want to just sort of
[4:35] reshare that on today's broadcast is if
[4:38] this walk of obedience this place of
[4:42] surrendered surrendered life coming into
[4:46] oneness with the father as Jesus was
[4:49] able to say to those who were standing
[4:51] around when you've seen me you've seen
[4:53] the father if this was a process for the
[4:56] Lord Jesus Christ then I believe we are
[4:59] safe to see in the scripture that it is
[5:02] a process for you and I as well
[5:04] Romans 8 29 said for whom he did
[5:07] foreknow he also did predestinate to be
[5:10] conformed again the word conformed
[5:14] speaks of that molding that shaping that
[5:17] honing in to the image of his son of
[5:22] course the enemy is always there to say
[5:24] look you blew it you messed up you're
[5:26] starting from scratch but I want to tell
[5:28] you something that when we do fail and
[5:32] when we do allow the enemy to have
[5:34] access to our spiritual man to our inner
[5:37] being through temptation or whatever he
[5:40] he puts out in front of us if we yield
[5:42] and if we fail we need to come back
[5:45] quickly to the throne of grace we need
[5:48] to repent of what we have yielded to how
[5:51] we have allowed the enemy to operate in
[5:53] our lives we need to pick right up from
[5:56] where we left off and go on we need to
[5:58] press first Peter 1 and 2 we spoke about
[6:02] that elect according to the
[6:04] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[6:07] sanctification of the spirit now this is
[6:11] a part of what we're talking about
[6:13] exercising those those spiritual gifts
[6:18] that God is placed in our life those
[6:20] senses that we might sanctify our spirit
[6:25] man and listening how its worded here
[6:28] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[6:30] God the Father through sanctification of
[6:33] the spirit through the purification that
[6:36] word sanctification to purify to set
[6:39] apart and in this particular reference
[6:42] it also is the word holiness through
[6:45] holiness of the Spirit this is God
[6:49] releasing over our human spirit his
[6:53] holiness which sets us apart which
[6:56] purifies us which filters out all that
[7:00] the enemy is trying to to penetrate our
[7:04] spirit with from the realm of the soul
[7:06] and from the realm of the flesh
[7:09] according to the foreknowledge of God
[7:11] the Father through sanctification of the
[7:13] spirit to obedience again here's
[7:16] disobedience that God is
[7:18] calling us to and sprinkling of the
[7:20] blood of Jesus Christ now this conformed
[7:23] to his image what does that look like
[7:25] it's spiritual maturity it's what Peter
[7:28] talked about the stature of a perfect
[7:31] man and perfection is a spiritual
[7:34] process we are being made perfect I
[7:37] think one of the last things that we
[7:39] spoke about was the fact that the
[7:42] scripture says we are called to be
[7:45] partakers we are called to be partakers
[7:49] of the divine nature and I really
[7:52] believe that these are keys that God
[7:55] wants to use in our life in this hour to
[7:58] bring us to that place when we come
[8:00] short of what God is asking us to do we
[8:04] are forgiven through the blood of Jesus
[8:06] and then we can move again toward the
[8:08] goal and we read some of those
[8:10] scriptures about pressing toward the
[8:12] mark of the upward call in Christ Jesus
[8:16] and then revelation 321 to him that
[8:20] overcomes will I grant to sit with me in
[8:23] my throne even as I also overcame and
[8:26] then sat down with my father in his
[8:29] throne we talked about the scripture in
[8:32] Matthew 22 14 for many are called but
[8:35] few are chosen now just to review a
[8:38] moment we've been teaching that man was
[8:41] created to function on two levels of
[8:44] life the earthly life the earthly realm
[8:48] the atmosphere around us and the
[8:51] heavenly realm the spirit realm we we
[8:55] talked about Genesis 27 how that the
[8:58] Lord breathed how God Almighty breathed
[9:01] into the nostrils of Adam the breath of
[9:05] life in Hebrew that is lives and man
[9:09] became a living soul the plurality of
[9:13] this word lives means that by the breath
[9:16] of God Adam received both soul life and
[9:20] spirit life it's a very very interesting
[9:23] thing Adam was in great harmony because
[9:27] of this because he was made in the image
[9:30] and the likeness of the triune God
[9:32] odd because adam ins himself was a try
[9:35] Unity body soul and spirit we find that
[9:40] he was very much in connection with
[9:43] nature he was very connected with his
[9:47] earthly environment and with other
[9:49] living creatures are the creations that
[9:52] God had made and I want us to look at
[9:54] that for a little bit today in Genesis
[9:56] chapter 2 verses 19 through 20 at this
[10:01] we're not approaching this as only a
[10:04] historical fact or truth in the life of
[10:07] Adam we're looking at this to see if
[10:10] there's anything in this that would be a
[10:13] part of our inheritance for today and I
[10:16] believe it is I believe that this
[10:19] connection that Adam enjoyed with his
[10:21] environment is part of our inheritance
[10:24] as believers and as we come into that
[10:28] place of divine alignment with him where
[10:31] we communicate with our Creator as Adam
[10:34] did in the Garden of Eden and that
[10:37] wasn't flesh to spirit that wasn't sold
[10:40] to spirit how was it that Adam
[10:42] communicated with God in the cool of the
[10:44] day in the Garden of Eden he
[10:46] communicated spirit to spirit and as we
[10:49] begin to exercise the senses of our
[10:52] human spirit bringing us into tandem
[10:55] into connection with our Heavenly Father
[10:59] and with His Holy Spirit I believe we're
[11:02] going to be able to see a greater
[11:04] connection in our life so that we come
[11:07] to that place of walking in Dominion as
[11:09] Adam was called to walk in the original
[11:12] mandate what was God's original mandate
[11:16] for mankind it was that Adam have
[11:20] dominion over all the creations that God
[11:24] had made the fish in the sea the animals
[11:27] plant kingdom life all of these things
[11:31] he was to have dominion now let's look
[11:34] at Genesis 2 verses 19 and 20 and I like
[11:37] these verses and out of the ground the
[11:40] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[11:43] every fowl of the air
[11:45] and brought them unto Adam to see what
[11:49] he would call them now in that amazing
[11:53] the God of all creation who had made all
[11:56] of these magnificent diverse colorful
[12:00] wonderful creatures and yet he brought
[12:03] them he he rounded them up and brought
[12:07] them to Adam to see what Adam would name
[12:13] the animals how is it that God could
[12:16] trust Adam with such a task well let's
[12:20] read on and whatever or whatsoever Adam
[12:24] called every living creature that was
[12:28] the name thereof I want you to see the
[12:31] level of trust now most of you have
[12:34] created something in your life you've
[12:37] written something you've built something
[12:39] you've painted something you've made
[12:41] something and you know how protective we
[12:44] can be over what we create how
[12:47] protective we can be even you've had an
[12:49] idea on your job or something along
[12:52] those lines and you know how protective
[12:54] you feel it's an amazing thing to me
[12:57] that Almighty God would have released
[13:00] such a big responsibility to Adam how
[13:05] could he do that because he had total
[13:07] complete trust in Adam and he rightfully
[13:12] so because Adam and his creator were
[13:15] communicating with such oneness spirit
[13:19] to spirit that God knew everything there
[13:21] was about Adam he knew that place of
[13:25] intimacy that Adam was walking in with
[13:27] him and so it really it was the mind of
[13:31] God functioning through Adam in other
[13:35] words whatever God would have named the
[13:37] animal that's what Adam named the animal
[13:41] Adam was operating out of that place of
[13:44] relationship that he had with the
[13:46] Creator so much so that Adam was not
[13:50] thinking his own thoughts he was
[13:52] connected spirit to spirit to the
[13:55] Almighty Creator so he was thinking
[13:57] God's thoughts he
[13:59] wasn't speaking his words he wasn't
[14:01] pulling some name out of a hat making up
[14:05] some kind of strange word and calling an
[14:07] elephant an elephant and a lion a lion
[14:09] he literally was reading the mind of God
[14:14] he was speaking the mind of God what if
[14:18] i told you that i believe that is a part
[14:21] of the inheritance of the overcoming
[14:24] company in this hour i believe that god
[14:27] wants to bring us to a place where we
[14:30] are so transformed by the renewing of
[14:34] our mind and remember we told you last
[14:37] week that the mind and the spirit two
[14:41] different words describing the same part
[14:45] of man the spirit and the mind very very
[14:49] connected we spoke about it we gave you
[14:52] some understanding of that I hope and so
[14:55] it's our mind being transformed by
[14:59] renewal so our spirit is also being
[15:02] transformed by renewal by exercising
[15:07] what God has placed within us to bring
[15:11] us to that walk of obedience so that we
[15:15] live our lives not out of the flesh not
[15:18] out of the soul but out of the spirit so
[15:21] here was Adam looking at the animals
[15:23] thinking God's thoughts and calling them
[15:27] what God would have called them naming
[15:30] them what God would have named them and
[15:32] Adam gave names to all cattle and to the
[15:35] fowl of the air and to every beast of
[15:38] the field but for Adam there was not
[15:40] found a helpmeet for him so here is Adam
[15:44] everything has its pair everything has
[15:46] its companion but as of yet Adam had no
[15:50] companion so what did God do he reached
[15:53] inside of Adam because remember the
[15:56] scripture tells us that Adam was made
[15:58] originally both male and female there
[16:02] was a feminist part inside of Adam God
[16:06] reached in from Adam and pulled out his
[16:10] help meet and this is a beautiful
[16:13] type of what has happened with the with
[16:16] the crucifixion of Christ at Calvary it
[16:18] was like the father God was reaching
[16:20] inside of Jesus and pulling out his
[16:24] companion his bride there is a oneness
[16:28] there is a union there is a communion
[16:31] that is our inheritance and I will not
[16:35] be satisfied until i come personally
[16:38] into that place where my thoughts are so
[16:42] submitted I've won the victory in the
[16:46] realm of my flesh I've won the victory
[16:48] in the realm of my soul that's what I'm
[16:50] after so that my spirit man my mind has
[16:54] been so transformed and renewed by the
[16:56] power of God that I'm not thinking my
[16:58] thoughts it's not my will my desire but
[17:01] it's his will his desire and what's so
[17:04] powerful about that is if my words are
[17:08] laid aside and I begin to speak his
[17:10] words the words of God what do we know
[17:13] about the Word of God we know their life
[17:15] we know that in the words of God there
[17:19] is life and not only live there is
[17:22] creative life creative life the creative
[17:27] Word of God so that we're given dominion
[17:31] over everything every circumstance now
[17:35] we talked about Adam being very in tune
[17:37] with nature him being very in tune with
[17:40] his earthly environment I'm thinking
[17:43] about our Lord Jesus Christ in the boat
[17:46] asleep a storm comes up and he his
[17:50] disciples wake him up Master don't you
[17:52] care that we're going to perish and he
[17:55] gets up he puts his foot up on the bow
[17:57] of the boat he stretches forth his hands
[17:59] he says peace be still this is a
[18:02] beautiful example of God man here our
[18:07] Lord Jesus who was God yet in a fleshly
[18:10] body is tired it's making a journey
[18:12] across the the Sea of Galilee he is
[18:15] fallen asleep in the bow of the boat
[18:18] very a very display a very big display
[18:22] or a display of his humanity now he puts
[18:26] his foot on the bow the boat
[18:27] peace be still and guess what the winds
[18:30] and the waves obey his will what is that
[18:34] a display of not his humanity his
[18:37] divinity he is now displaying that He is
[18:41] God God in a fleshly body what if i told
[18:46] you again that i believe that is a part
[18:49] of our inheritance that God wants you
[18:53] and I functioning in that authority and
[18:56] in that Dominion where that we could
[18:59] literally speak by the power of the
[19:01] spoken word and calm the storm somebody
[19:06] said well I think that's just a
[19:08] grandiose thought and it's not likely to
[19:10] be carried out well I want you to know
[19:11] in token form it has already happened in
[19:14] the earth and is happening in the lives
[19:17] of believers who are going after it
[19:20] sometimes the the biggest part of why we
[19:23] don't see these things it's because
[19:26] people don't realize that it's available
[19:28] it's for them and they can go after it
[19:31] and I'm not going to be satisfied with a
[19:34] nominal Christian life I'm not going to
[19:37] be satisfied with just church anity I
[19:39] think I mentioned this in an earlier
[19:41] broadcast I don't believe God is a God
[19:44] who dangled the carrot before our nose
[19:47] knowing that we'll never be able to eat
[19:49] it I believe if we read it in the book
[19:51] as a divine promise for the end time all
[19:54] we have to do is look around and see if
[19:56] we're living in the generation of the
[19:58] end time and it doesn't take a very
[20:01] careful examination to see that the
[20:03] signs of the times are telling us that
[20:06] we're living in that last cycle we're
[20:08] living in that season at least in the
[20:11] season of the coming of the Lord and so
[20:15] these scriptures and promises that
[20:17] relate to this generation to this time
[20:19] then we certainly can claim them as our
[20:23] own and it is a process but we're
[20:26] pushing and we're leaning in and we're
[20:30] pressing forward until we see the
[20:32] fullness of this in our life now I've
[20:34] got a couple testimonies that I'd like
[20:37] to share with you about men of God
[20:41] who walked in at least a measure of this
[20:46] spirit to spirit communication and
[20:48] communion and oneness with God they
[20:51] became tokens of what is available for
[20:54] you and I I believe the men i'm going to
[20:56] speak about our we're firstfruits I
[20:59] believe they represent the fact to us
[21:01] that we can have this same kind of thing
[21:04] in our own life the same manifestation
[21:07] I'm familiar i've spent a mini year
[21:10] studying the ministry of a great healing
[21:12] evangelist profit that God mightily used
[21:15] in the 50s and 60s his name was William
[21:17] Branham and there's a couple testimonies
[21:20] from his life that stand out about how
[21:22] God used him to have communication and
[21:25] to have even dominion over the animal
[21:28] kingdom and he's telling a story here
[21:31] and I'm going to read it in his words
[21:33] it's it's uh it's Kentucky English but
[21:35] if you listen to this program you ought
[21:37] to be familiar with that anyway so I'm
[21:40] going to share it with you he said last
[21:41] summer my yard needed mowing real bad I
[21:44] couldn't get anybody in the morning I
[21:46] was home on a little vacation and two
[21:49] weeks I hadn't got out in the front yard
[21:51] with a little power motor put on my
[21:52] overalls and run out started mowing the
[21:55] yard and first thing you know a little
[21:57] old power motor somebody come in and I
[22:00] slip around back and change my clothes
[22:01] run in to pray for them then change
[22:04] again and go out and try to cut the
[22:06] grass again he said he'd been almost two
[22:08] weeks the grass had grown up so I got
[22:10] around behind the house where nobody
[22:12] could see me took off my shirt had my
[22:14] overalls and shoes on real hot and I was
[22:17] mowing I forgot about a little old
[22:19] Martin box that I had and that's a
[22:21] that's a kind of bird purple martin and
[22:24] there was a bunch of Hornets that had
[22:26] gone in that birdhouse and I'd forgotten
[22:29] about it and I hit against the fence and
[22:32] bumped that bird box and all of a sudden
[22:35] I was covered with Hornets you know what
[22:39] that is it's it's a flying insect like a
[22:42] wasp but but Hornets have very very
[22:46] powerful stingers in fact people have
[22:49] died and some of you will know that even
[22:51] in your different parts of the world
[22:53] that you
[22:54] can be attacked by Hornets and died
[22:56] there's a lot of poison in their sting
[22:59] he said I was just covered over with
[23:01] Hornets and I said I got to get out of
[23:04] here but I couldn't get away from him
[23:05] they were covering my body he said
[23:08] here's what I said now little Hornets I
[23:11] love you doesn't that sound silly
[23:13] doesn't that sound strange how did he
[23:17] know to say such a thing i believe it
[23:19] was thinking his thoughts i believe it
[23:21] was thinking God's thoughts I believe it
[23:24] was his mind was being renewed and he
[23:28] was beginning to think the thoughts of
[23:29] the Lord and he said little Hornets I
[23:31] love you and and I don't want you
[23:33] kissing me right now I want to go right
[23:35] on back to what I'm doing and I want you
[23:38] to go right back into your nest where
[23:39] you belong I'm God's servant and I've
[23:42] been praying for the sick and and I
[23:44] haven't had time to cut the grass so I'm
[23:46] out here cutting the grass I want you to
[23:48] go along now and get away from me I'm
[23:50] not scared of you because I just don't
[23:53] have time to do to fool with you right
[23:56] now go right back he said and I'm just
[23:59] gonna keep on mowing he said God is my
[24:02] judge every one of those Hornets just
[24:05] line right up one right after another
[24:07] and went right back in that box as
[24:09] pretty as you could see now I tell you I
[24:13] can see that there might be
[24:15] circumstances in life where that's the
[24:17] kind of gift we want operating in our
[24:19] life the Apostle Paul had that kind of
[24:23] gift we heard about his shipwreck we
[24:25] heard how the serpent came and got out
[24:28] of the fire bit his hand you know
[24:31] they're building a fire come out of the
[24:32] wood bit his hand and all of a sudden
[24:35] he's a thief and and and the the
[24:38] judgment of the gods are upon him and
[24:40] this serpent this poisonous Vipers bit
[24:43] him and the next thing you know the
[24:44] Bible said he just shook that serpent
[24:46] off in the fire and the same ones that
[24:49] had just called him a thief and a
[24:50] murderer now they called him a god how
[24:54] was he able to do that so that the
[24:56] poison didn't kill him because he was
[24:59] walking in the authority of Jesus Christ
[25:03] we need to come into that place of
[25:06] surrender listen this is
[25:08] something we we pull out of our pocket
[25:10] when we need it this is something we
[25:12] need to be walking in this is something
[25:14] we want to live in we want to function
[25:16] in not tuck away and pull it out every
[25:19] now and again in case if we get in a
[25:21] bind but I want to walk in that divine
[25:24] alignment where my spirit is
[25:26] communicating with his spirit and then
[25:29] brother branham tells another story that
[25:31] I like about a bool and and and how that
[25:36] the Lord used him there he said I I
[25:38] started across a field let's see if I i
[25:41] can get it just to the right place he
[25:44] said I was going over the hill to pray
[25:45] for a sick man he was a game warden at
[25:47] the time and we're supposed to take a
[25:49] gun but you wouldn't go to pray for a
[25:51] sick man with a gun in your in your
[25:53] holster so I took the gun and laid it a
[25:56] little truck and crossed over the field
[25:57] I was way out in the field and I forgot
[26:01] about the fact that in that field there
[26:03] was a bull that was known to be a killer
[26:06] he just killed an african-american man a
[26:10] colored man on the farm mr. Burke's just
[26:13] about three months before that and they
[26:16] had sold that bull up there to these
[26:18] people that had this particular kind of
[26:20] cattle and I've seen that bull in that
[26:22] field the variable that he knew had
[26:25] killed a man just a few months before
[26:27] but he forgot about it he said it was
[26:29] easier to cross the field to get to
[26:31] where he was going to pray and he said I
[26:33] got out in the middle of that field in
[26:35] about 30 yards from me this big old bull
[26:38] raised up his head and threw his horns
[26:40] down let out a big old bellow if you
[26:43] know what I'm talking about he said then
[26:45] Bighorns just shining up in the air and
[26:47] I looked to see if I could find a tree
[26:49] to climb up in but there was no tree and
[26:51] I knew that that bull could outrun me to
[26:54] the fence so I thought well this is it
[26:58] there's no telling what's going to
[27:00] happen to me and he said something
[27:04] happened all of a sudden he said I just
[27:07] began to to feel something and all of a
[27:10] sudden all the fear he said I had a rush
[27:12] of fear and then all of a sudden the
[27:14] fear just lifted and I wasn't scared of
[27:16] that bull he said I felt sorry that I
[27:19] had to stir
[27:20] of the bull there the bull was eating
[27:22] and minding his business I'd come
[27:23] traipsing through his field now he was
[27:26] all worked up pawing the ground letting
[27:29] out a bellow and he said I was in his
[27:31] field he was supposed to be out there
[27:33] laying around doing nothing and really I
[27:36] was bothering him now think about that
[27:38] he said Here Come this bull toward me as
[27:41] hard as he could come with his head down
[27:43] he was ready to pierce me right through
[27:46] with those horns but he said I wasn't
[27:48] any more afraid of that bull then I
[27:50] would be of any of these brothers and
[27:52] sisters sitting around here he ran
[27:53] within about five foot of me and stopped
[27:57] he looked at me so depleted and I said
[28:00] to him fellow I'm so sorry I disturbed
[28:03] you now you're God's creature and I'm
[28:05] God's servant now the Creator that made
[28:07] you made me and I'm his servant I'm on a
[28:09] journey across this hill to pray for a
[28:12] sick man and I'm so sorry that I
[28:14] disturbed you so now in the name of
[28:16] Jesus Christ your Creator go back and
[28:19] lay down and he said the bull looked at
[28:22] me a few minutes turned around walked
[28:25] over and laid down and I stood there
[28:27] with tears running down my eyes he was
[28:31] amazed at and listen it was the love of
[28:35] God dropped down into brother branham's
[28:38] heart the love of God and he began to
[28:41] love that creature those Hornets that
[28:43] bull like God who made them love them
[28:46] and I want you to know that when love is
[28:50] projected grace takes over when when we
[28:54] let love project from our lives God's
[28:57] divine love grace comes rushing in to
[29:01] meet the challenge perhaps some of you
[29:04] have heard of a of a man that was
[29:05] mightily used of God somewhat of a
[29:07] mystic in in Christianity many years ago

[29:13] england in 1905 his name was sadhu
[29:15] sundar Singh I know many of you who are
