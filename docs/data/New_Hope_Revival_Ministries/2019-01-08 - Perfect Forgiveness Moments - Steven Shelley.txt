TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there are memories that none of us want to relive there are places in our life that none of us want to walk through however we don't want to miss the opportunity to embrace that God used some of those situations to shape us in a way that he can use us Satan meant it I guarantee you we know Satan meant it to kill us he meant it to destroy us and he meant to lead us into enough sin that we would never be able to forgive ourselves and because we could never forgive ourselves we would never be able to really receive God's perfect forgiveness for her better think of that because that's really what the old devil is after he's still after that keeping you in a place where you can't let go and so here you are hearing the deep call feeling the pole and you're standing on the outside of the holy of holies and you're just about ready to step into a new dimension in the spirit that's promised for the bride of Jesus Christ you could call it many things the full manifestation of the spoken word the full manifestation of the third pool prophesy again you could call it the manifestation of the sons of God there are so many things that we could call it but your ride up right up to the edge and you're just about to step in you want to be able to go on in regardless of the howl of the enemy that only comes we're only gonna be able to step in when we truly know who we are and when we truly recognize not only is every bit of that forgiven it no longer disqualifies us in any way from being used in the kingdom of God because like Paul you didn't know what you were doing
