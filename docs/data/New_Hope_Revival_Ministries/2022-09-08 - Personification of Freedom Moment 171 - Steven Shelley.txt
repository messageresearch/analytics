Description:
If a man or woman has ever sought God, it’s because He sought them first.  By grace He reached way down and met us where we were.  Some He found in deepest sin and lawlessness.  But He loved us and reversed and erased the very things that brought a curse into our lives.  He protected us from sure death.  He hovered over us, stayed around us to convict and forgive.  We see our lives transformed by the power of the Living Word, and  by grace an mercy of God.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're not looking for revival somewhere we are revival [Music] we understand that no man has ever sought god at any time by his own mind if a man or woman has ever sought god it's because god was seeking after that man or woman he found you right where you were how many of you are glad you didn't have to come up to where he was he reached way below the bottom and met you in your sin found you right where you were some of you he found you in some mighty rough places but he found you nonetheless and he didn't just leave you he stayed with you and hovered around you and called your name and pulled on your heart whispered in your ear protected you from death the very reason some of you are here today is because god kept you from death that he might have time to redeem you and present you as that chaste virgin that the word is making us in this hour we're being purified by the word the very stain of sin is being erased and what the curse has brought into our lives we are now seeing it reversed by the living word the earth around us is living under the weight and the load of the curse but the bride of jesus christ is coming out from under that curse and the world is getting worldlier and sicker and in more trouble but the bride is becoming more like her bridegroom every day that we live there's only one thing that'll make you more like christ and that's the word we're not just faced with a dead letter but we have a living word and this living word is more than a sermon he is a person and his name is the lord jesus christ he has broken every chain and every fetter he has power to set every captive free he has blown the silver trumpet of the jubilee so that every slave who can hear the voice of the trumpet calling us to come higher telling us church is not the answer telling us religion is not the answer there's only one answer and that's a relationship with jesus christ not twice a week every single day of the week every single day of the month a close relationship with him i think it sometimes baffles minds to find out that you can have that kind of a walk with him where he walks with you and talks with you and deals with you every single day of your life but he does we're not looking for revival somewhere we are revival that's what the word says we are revival we are the personification of a people who were once enslaved but by the beautiful grace and mercy of god we have now been set free and we are saying amen may i be the personification of freedom may i be the demonstration of liberty and may i never waste may i never squander freedom
