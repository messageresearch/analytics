TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and there is indeed a part of us that is eternal hallelujah hallelujah we now have uh uh received a a seed that is Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever there is no end to that word in fact it continues to manifest itself and perform itself it's a living thing it's a living entity the word what we fellowship with is a printed page but we're not talking about the record we're talking about the Living Word and the Living Word is not a book it's not a tape it's not your pastor's sermon The Living Word is a person and he walks not only among us but he dwells in us he has chosen us as a throne the Ark of the Covenant is now in the inner being of the redeemed and The Mercy Seat is there and the glory of the Lord hangs over The Mercy Seat in us just like it did in the Tabernacle of the Wilderness all of that was teaching us to get us to the place where we could realize that we haven't received a substitute from God you know it's not like Hallmark he cared enough to send his very best but he came enough to be his very best in in US New Testament promises are not only to help us bless us and strengthen us but they are available to give us a taste of the divine nature of what it's like to live with deity in your skin it's about Authority God knew that if he put a portion of himself in you you would operate in the in the authority that he operated in it's adoption it has a beginning it has a process a Proving Ground and then it has an announcement this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him the father announcing when he speaks he's speaking on my behalf did you know that's what he's looking for in his wife that's what he's looking for in his bride a people who will recognize it's not by our strength or power it's by the authority of the divine nature that lives in Us by the genuine New Birth and when I said genuine New Birth we're talking about a holy ghost that goes beyond the flesh the Holy Ghost can fall on your flesh and give you a chill and give you a thrill and give you a quickening you can cry as you respond to what you feel because you just get so quickened that you can hardly control what's happening on your flesh but that's not the fullness of the new birth you see there's something on the inside that regenerated spirit that now has the divine nature upon it it was a fallen Spirit when you got here now by the New Birth the Divine Nature has fallen on it and it's now a regenerated spirit and I I hesitate to call it a regenerated human spirit because once you place the deity of God the Zoey the eternal life of God on it can you really technically call it a human spirit anymore it this life that you live isn't yours now you're living his life which is a Divine Life the divine nature is living in that it's now Eternal the body may pass the soul at some point May cease to function but that Spirit life in you is eternal you won't need five senses in that new body you'll have something a whole lot more than that not just a deposit of the divine nature but the very fullness of the life of God
