========================================

Description:
Have you ever asked yourself, “Am I doing this for His Name to be glorified, or am I moving in my own ambitions or man’s recognition?” 

Oh, what a price we pay for doing things our own way, yet nothing can be more rewarding when we move in Holy Ghost power, in divine authority of our heavenly Bridegroom.  We overcome when we move in the perfect will of God in His perfect timing, and no force of evil can stop us from accomplishing His will.  He keeps perfect record.
