========================================

Description:
Scripture defines for us the steps to the new birth.  When we first repent we come into relationship with God and are justified by the washing of the water of the Word. His Spirit continues to convict and give assurance, to guide us into all Truth, to move within us in sanctification and we receive the very Life of God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire. It comes by conviction, not with condemnation.  He is the Great Comforter and Advocate through whom we receive power and authority over all the powers of the enemy.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he comes to help us to understand where our hope is where our help comes from where our strength is [Music] how many of you know the holy ghost is not the third member or third person of a godhead but he is another demonstration of the same god the same spirit so you couldn't have jesus the fullness of god in body on the earth and the spirit of god loosened the earth at the same time jesus said i have to go so that he can come but then he said in chapter 14 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he was identifying to them by revelation i'm not sending someone else even though he said i'll send you another comforter it was the spirit of the father that was living in him that was going to come back on the believer and be all the comfort that they would ever need i want you to know today jesus is the only comfort that lasts that's enduring that is eternal so the spirit of god in you is not to condemn you and make you feel hopeless the spirit of god in us by the baptism of the holy ghost is there to cause us to be convinced that we can't do it by ourself but if we lean on him and depend on this relationship we have with him we can overcome all things we can't make it without him you say well you know i'm not sure if i have the holy ghost you've got to know you must know i wish you'd help me preach this morning you must know that you have the baptism of the holy ghost hope so is not enough i wished i did i wish that this is not enough you've got to know that you know that you know that you know that you know because we're facing things now and what we're facing now it doesn't even begin to compare with what we will face we need the helper in us we need the advocate in us we need the one who comes to convince us and to convict us we need him living in us the work of the holy ghost is not finished when we come to christ when we come to the new birth and he first deals with our heart and we pray and cry and repent and we come to justification and then the water washes us by the word and we come to sanctification and then we receive the baptism of the holy ghost he feels so good he feels so good in our life he gives us joy he gives us fire he gives us peace but i want you to know his work is not finished he continues to remain in us to convince us to convict us to guide us to lead us to show us the way when he the spirit of truth is come not only into the world but into the bride when he come into us by the baptism of the holy ghost he is there to guide us he is there to lead us he is there to direct us into all truth he's there to nudge us when we look at the wrong thing he's there to nudge us when we say the wrong thing he's there to nudge us when we think the wrong thing and he doesn't do it with condemnation if if it fills you with guilt and condemnation it's a trick of the accuser it's not the work of the holy spirit the trick of the accuser is to condemn us and make us feel like there is no hope the work of the holy spirit in us is to remind us i will give you power over all the powers of the enemy because i overcame the world you can also overcome he comes to help us to understand where our hope is where our help comes from where our strength is i want to tell you today no matter where you are there's nothing that you are struggling with in this hour that the wonderful spirit of god can't give you help and grace to overcome but you've got to lean on the advocate you've got to lean on the comforter and if you don't have him living on the inside of you by the baptism of the holy ghost you're missing out if he's not on board how many of you are glad you know that the holy ghost is on board he's on board you
