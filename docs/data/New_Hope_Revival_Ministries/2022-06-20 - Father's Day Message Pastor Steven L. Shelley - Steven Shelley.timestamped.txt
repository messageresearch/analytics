[44:16] don't give up the air conditioning
[44:18] but anyway
[44:19] so there are those who are suffering
[44:21] with a real cold
[44:23] and but because it runs some time with
[44:25] the fever and with similar symptoms to
[44:28] covid they there are people concerned
[44:30] about us because we're traveling next
[44:32] week a lot of us are going to be going
[44:35] to texas we don't want to take anything
[44:38] and i'm just a little selfish i really
[44:40] don't want to miss my son's wedding
[44:42] you know they could get another preacher
[44:44] but he can't get another dad so i want
[44:46] to be there and so i appreciate everyone
[44:49] who has taken precaution the main
[44:52] symptoms that sister
[44:53] joyce has complained about and when i
[44:56] say complain she's has not complained
[44:58] but what she has experienced has been an
[45:01] extreme headache
[45:03] and a sore throat and then the
[45:05] congestion the coughing and so forth and
[45:07] etc so there is a lot of that going
[45:09] around if you are here today and you are
[45:11] sick we love you and we thank you for
[45:14] coming
[45:15] we would be happy to lay hands on you
[45:17] and pray for you we are not afraid to do
[45:19] that but if you feel that you have a
[45:21] fever it would just be a great kind
[45:23] gesture for you to slip out i'll meet
[45:26] you in the vestibule and pray for you
[45:28] we're not afraid to pray for you but we
[45:30] really don't want anybody to to spread
[45:33] what's going on uh sister elfrida is not
[45:35] here this morning and uh we want to hold
[45:38] her up to the lord in prayer anna
[45:40] christina is not feeling well today
[45:42] just because someone is sick doesn't
[45:44] mean that they have coveted this is a
[45:46] very mild strain
[45:48] the problem is if you are vulnerable if
[45:51] you have already some pre-existing
[45:54] conditions it can still be serious and
[45:56] there are churches as large as happy
[45:58] valley who are not having in-person
[46:00] services today so there is an upsurge in
[46:04] new uh covid and they are quite amazed
[46:08] at how many of these people are double
[46:11] and triple vaccinated and it just proves
[46:14] that every time a virus changes it often
[46:18] outgrows any vaccination and so we have
[46:20] we do want to pray pray for our safety
[46:23] this week that god will help every one
[46:25] of us to be protected and i not only
[46:28] am not interested in having it i don't
[46:30] want to pass it to anyone who may not be
[46:33] able to weather the storm as as we have

[1:00:43] one that tells of grace that is greater
[1:00:46] than sin
[1:00:47] until you get to know someone and hear
[1:00:49] their story you don't know where they've
[1:00:52] been
[1:00:53] you don't know where the lord has
[1:00:54] brought them from
[1:00:55] there are amazing testimonies sitting
[1:00:58] here this morning
[1:00:59] amazing unbelievable testimonies of how
[1:01:03] grace has won
[1:01:05] how jesus has conquered all bondage
[1:01:08] how he's still the great emancipator and
[1:01:10] the great deliverer and his brother
[1:01:12] daniel prayed this morning the greatest
[1:01:15] papa
[1:01:16] the greatest father
[1:01:18] that anyone could ever dream of having
[1:01:22] and he never fails he is faithful we
[1:01:24] want to say happy father's day
[1:01:27] to not only all the fathers that are
[1:01:29] here this morning but also to the
[1:01:31] fathers that are streaming this service
[1:01:34] god bless you everyone
[1:01:42] so many times you are underappreciated
[1:01:46] and maligned
[1:01:48] in society
[1:01:51] most everyone is kind when they speak of
[1:01:54] mothers
[1:01:56] but if you would just think back over
[1:01:59] the past
[1:02:00] 40 years
[1:02:02] 50 years or more
[1:02:04] in public entertainment even
[1:02:06] you would think of dozens of examples
[1:02:10] where father is the stupid one
[1:02:15] he is he is the dummy
[1:02:17] and he's the one that's being led around
[1:02:19] by a bossy wife
[1:02:21] but i'm here to tell you that there are
[1:02:23] men of god
[1:02:25] in the world
[1:02:27] that are not dumb
[1:02:30] they may be a little underappreciated
[1:02:32] sometime
[1:02:33] they may check out a little more than
[1:02:34] we'd like for them to sometime
[1:02:37] but we are thankful that there are men
[1:02:39] of god who are serving their families
[1:02:41] with honor and with integrity can you
[1:02:43] say amen to that again
[1:02:46] god bless every one of you
[1:02:49] we are blessed
[1:02:51] we are blessed here
[1:02:53] to have some of those fathers and we
[1:02:56] have some amazing young fathers
[1:03:00] who are doing an incredible job raising
[1:03:03] their children
[1:03:04] and
[1:03:05] uh
[1:03:07] it brings me a special pleasure
[1:03:10] to watch these young dads
[1:03:13] with their children
[1:03:15] it really
[1:03:17] means something to me
[1:03:19] and it's not easy
[1:03:21] it's certainly not easy on mother
[1:03:23] but it's not always easy on father
[1:03:25] because he is out of the home
[1:03:27] and he comes home tired and sometimes
[1:03:30] the last thing that he wants is to play
[1:03:36] but tea party it is
[1:03:38] or wrestling it is
[1:03:40] i pray that that's the way it is at your
[1:03:42] house it is
[1:03:45] vitally
[1:03:46] vitally important
[1:03:49] my mother was both a mother and a father
[1:03:52] to me
[1:03:53] she was the best father that she could
[1:03:55] be
[1:03:56] but she wasn't the best father
[1:03:59] because she wasn't a father
[1:04:01] and so if you uh are a dad
[1:04:05] be there
[1:04:06] be available
[1:04:08] no matter the cost
[1:04:10] and always know that sleep will come
[1:04:15] it comes eventually
[1:04:17] it does come
[1:04:19] and things do slow down never i mean
[1:04:22] things do slow down
[1:04:24] we we uh
[1:04:26] lost
[1:04:27] the oldest father
[1:04:29] uh among us when we lost brother west
[1:04:33] and i miss him so terribly much all the
[1:04:36] time
[1:04:37] not just some of the time but all of the
[1:04:39] time but oh my
[1:04:41] as i thought of the song that was sung
[1:04:43] last week
[1:04:44] i think about wonderful days ahead of
[1:04:47] strolling over heaven
[1:04:49] with brother west
[1:04:50] brother richard was our oldest father
[1:04:53] but he is out of town and not here
[1:04:55] hasn't been with us for a bit
[1:04:57] and
[1:04:58] so we are looking for our oldest father

[1:05:04] from the church to let you know how much

[1:06:38] it's one thing when you
[1:06:40] serve your
[1:06:42] family your biological children
[1:06:45] but it's it's particularly special
[1:06:48] when you are willing to take someone's
[1:06:51] children and love them as your own
[1:06:54] and be there for them even when they're
[1:06:56] grown and i happen to know that brother

[1:08:08] want new people to come to the church
[1:08:10] but we don't particularly pray they'll
[1:08:12] be young the youngest dad right we
[1:08:25] since i don't know math
[1:08:28] i'm not bringing your zack
[1:08:31] you're coming to get it
[1:08:35] you will never be remembered again as
[1:08:36] the youngest father that's it this is
[1:08:38] your sunday
[1:08:40] happy father's day
[1:08:48] boy i just i don't i don't do good at
[1:08:50] this my granny used to do this so well
[1:08:54] i love to watch her do it it delighted
[1:08:56] her to be able to do it and uh so i do
[1:08:59] this in her honor every year
[1:09:02] uh then we go to
[1:09:04] uh the
[1:09:06] oh of the the dad who has the most
[1:09:10] uh children
[1:09:11] and
[1:09:13] we sometimes say biological sometimes we
[1:09:16] say
[1:09:17] present
[1:09:18] and uh because we
[1:09:21] recognize that stepdads
[1:09:24] can be godsent
[1:09:27] they absolutely can be god's sent
[1:09:30] and we want to honor them today without
[1:09:33] any prejudice
[1:09:34] because they carry some
[1:09:37] so uh
[1:09:38] we'll do it both ways brother robert
[1:09:42] uh all together you have how many
[1:09:45] biological children
[1:09:47] five biological children
[1:09:49] and then we add that
[1:09:52] how many more
[1:09:54] eight more
[1:09:57] and you're not amish
[1:10:02] that is a lot brother
[1:10:04] brother
[1:10:05] brother shane you have
[1:10:08] uh
[1:10:10] eight
[1:10:10] all together
[1:10:12] is that correct
[1:10:15] i
[1:10:16] think that
[1:10:17] we have to break this tie again at least
[1:10:20] for this sunday
[1:10:22] so brother robert will you come and let
[1:10:25] us honor you

[1:11:05] what's going on
[1:11:06] what's going on what's going on in here
[1:11:08] what's going on in here
[1:11:10] i see a smile
[1:11:15] we have one more since we had so many
[1:11:17] tiebreakers
[1:11:18] and this would be for the father who has
[1:11:21] unless you've already received one
[1:11:23] who had who has had the baptism of the
[1:11:25] holy ghost the longest
[1:11:30] besides me
[1:11:34] wow am i now that person
[1:11:39] 86
[1:11:42] brother reed
[1:11:45] 73 that's even before mine
[1:11:49] that's uh mine was 75 so that's a long
[1:11:52] time who else
[1:11:55] how who else uh anybody else want to put
[1:11:58] their year in
[1:12:02] how many years is that for you
[1:12:07] oh yeah yes you do because i just did
[1:12:12] help him help me help him
[1:12:17] other than
[1:12:24] did you need your toes
[1:12:26] yeah yeah
[1:12:27] other than brother reading myself has
[1:12:29] anyone had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:30] longer than 36 years
[1:12:34] and brother
[1:12:35] how many
[1:12:37] 42 years you already received one
[1:12:40] anybody else it's yours brother daniel
[1:12:46] god bless you love you
[1:12:47] happy father's day
[1:12:52] i think that's worth honoring too
[1:12:55] you know to and and
[1:12:57] we can say
[1:12:59] most of the time when we honor someone
[1:13:01] like that who's had the baptism of the
[1:13:03] holy ghost the longest and we could say
[1:13:04] that about these men
[1:13:06] is that they've been in church
[1:13:08] they didn't just get it and go out and
[1:13:10] do this and that and backslide and be
[1:13:12] gone for years and come back to god but
[1:13:14] these are men that that got the real
[1:13:16] deal
[1:13:17] they weren't perfect i'm sure i've
[1:13:19] certainly not been but they've stood the
[1:13:21] test of time
[1:13:23] and they should be honored you agree
[1:13:25] all right we have a present for every
[1:13:27] father if you'll come and that includes
[1:13:29] you that just received a gift card would
[1:13:31] you come and let us love on you just a
[1:13:34] minute and hand you a little present
[1:13:36] from the church now we were running a
[1:13:38] little slim
[1:13:40] on on options for this year
[1:13:43] and that's not a very particularly manly
[1:13:45] color but the reason why it's made that
[1:13:46] way is so you'll find it
[1:13:48] and it's pretty handy look
[1:13:52] you do it does both
[1:13:54] have you ever been on a job and needed
[1:13:56] the other
[1:13:57] a flathead or or a phillips

[1:28:53] 15 years thank you happy 15th wedding
[1:28:57] anniversary boy that seems like a long
[1:28:59] time
[1:29:00] brother hawk and sister mary beth
[1:29:06] you all share a wedding anniversary with
[1:29:08] brother branham and sister hope
[1:29:10] his first wife who went to be with the
[1:29:12] lord not too long into their marriage
[1:29:16] and they were
[1:29:17] married in 1934
[1:29:20] and also
[1:29:21] uh it is the i believe that is wednesday
[1:29:25] i might have that wrong that might have
[1:29:27] been friday but
[1:29:28] i believe that's right
[1:29:30] but it is also
[1:29:33] uh
[1:29:35] give me just a moment i i i don't want
[1:29:37] to speak out and be wrong
[1:29:40] again
[1:29:42] no that's right and it was on wednesday
[1:29:45] and it's also on wednesday that we
[1:29:48] remember the little story that he told
[1:29:51] about the resurrection of the little
[1:29:53] fish where god under inspiration spoke
[1:29:56] and said give him his life he spoke to
[1:29:59] that little fish i give you your life in
[1:30:01] the name of the lord jesus christ which
[1:30:04] speaks to us a lot of this coming hour
[1:30:07] this next season that we enter into
[1:30:10] where the power of the spoken creative
[1:30:12] word is among us
[1:30:14] and accomplishing all that needs to be
[1:30:16] accomplished to get the bride out of
[1:30:18] here we're looking forward to all that
[1:30:20] god has for us in that can you say amen
[1:30:24] and i just need to make a little uh
[1:30:27] quick a poll here
[1:30:29] and remind you that on
[1:30:32] uh tuesday june 28th
[1:30:36] there will not be a service here that's
[1:30:39] not this tuesday how many of you know
[1:30:41] what this tuesday means that means this
[1:30:43] next one that's coming up
[1:30:45] the day after tomorrow i say that
[1:30:48] because
[1:30:48] people still get confused on how many a
[1:30:51] couple is
[1:30:54] that's two
[1:30:56] three and more is several
[1:30:59] can we all agree on that when you say a
[1:31:02] couple of something you're talking about
[1:31:03] two that makes a couple
[1:31:05] hope there's no three couples around
[1:31:08] threesomes
[1:31:09] it's a couple two and when you say more
[1:31:11] than two it's several and when we say
[1:31:14] this tuesday we mean the very next one
[1:31:17] coming
[1:31:19] and when we say next tuesday we mean not
[1:31:21] this one
[1:31:23] but the one after this one oh we've been
[1:31:25] needing to have this conversation a long
[1:31:28] time
[1:31:29] to get us all on the right pay and you
[1:31:31] just happen to be here the sunday that
[1:31:33] we get this thing straightened out once
[1:31:35] and for all
[1:31:37] so this tuesday we will be having a
[1:31:39] service next tuesday the tuesday
[1:31:42] following this tuesday
[1:31:45] there will be no service and that date
[1:31:47] happens to be june 28th
[1:31:49] and there will be no service that
[1:31:51] following sunday july the 3rd well i've
[1:31:53] never heard of a church not having
[1:31:55] served now you
[1:31:56] have so we will put a sign on the door
[1:32:00] and we will let people know there'll be
[1:32:01] no service here there are dozens of
[1:32:04] ministries around the world that you can
[1:32:06] stream if you'd like to stream live we
[1:32:09] can give you our most recommended
[1:32:11] sources i am not afraid of you
[1:32:13] committing spiritual adultery with a
[1:32:16] pastor and listening to other preachers
[1:32:18] i think sometimes it can be very healthy
[1:32:22] and so we would we we don't have a
[1:32:24] problem with that under most
[1:32:25] circumstances
[1:32:26] and if you are at home and you're not
[1:32:28] streaming and you want to hear a brother
[1:32:31] branham's sermon you go right to the app

[1:32:36] if you don't have it shame on you
[1:32:39] and uh you can stream the service live
[1:32:42] if you look just a moment here
[1:32:44] there are people here streaming and
[1:32:47] uh and commenting
[1:32:49] right here on the
[1:32:51] on the app
[1:32:52] and you can also watch videos of
[1:32:54] previous services
[1:32:56] and you can hear some um some marvelous
[1:32:59] sermons here
[1:33:00] including uh some from brother perry
[1:33:03] green
[1:33:04] all of our service and the series are on
[1:33:07] here so there are there's plenty of
[1:33:10] spiritual things that we can do to feed
[1:33:12] on during those two services and i don't
[1:33:14] mean to say it flippantly i apologize to
[1:33:17] you that that's the way it is
[1:33:19] but so many of us are going to be in
[1:33:22] texas for the wedding and we've never
[1:33:24] had a situation like this where we had
[1:33:26] to do it this way before but we're just
[1:33:28] trusting that god will don't you care
[1:33:30] about those of us left behind absolutely

[1:33:36] pointing you in all these different
[1:33:37] directions to get the help that you need

[1:33:43] this coming sunday
[1:33:45] because there's quite a few people
[1:33:47] leaving early and then it dawned on me
[1:33:49] that they're making it part of their
[1:33:51] vacation
[1:33:53] and uh extending their stay either on on
[1:33:56] end before or after and some both
[1:34:00] and really
[1:34:02] as hard as it will be to miss them next

[1:34:09] vacation out all at one time
[1:34:12] so we can come back and have have
[1:34:14] everybody here

[1:34:19] hands of those don't be overwhelmed
[1:34:22] when you see all these hands but i would
[1:34:24] just like to see the hands of those who
[1:34:26] are leaving for texas or thereabouts
[1:34:30] before next sunday and you will not be
[1:34:32] with us hold up your hand just a minute
[1:34:34] all right well that's quite a few
[1:34:36] all right so you will not be with us

[1:35:17] and we want them to have safety on the
[1:35:19] road how many of you are driving let me
[1:35:21] see your hand you're driving to texas so
[1:35:23] this is a lot of folks that need to be
[1:35:25] remembered to the lord how many of you
[1:35:26] are flying hold up your hand okay
[1:35:29] so
[1:35:30] we want to pray for all those that are
[1:35:32] going that god will be with them
[1:35:34] and that god will just give us a
[1:35:37] wonderful time
[1:35:38] and
[1:35:39] we are very very thankful that the lord
[1:35:41] has done this for benjamin
[1:35:43] and that's a very special time for our
[1:35:45] family and we appreciate all your love
[1:35:48] i would like to ask one one small thing
[1:35:51] from you and that is
[1:35:53] sometimes when they have their showers
[1:35:55] their their bridal showers they mention
[1:35:58] in that uh
[1:36:00] bring a gift and bring something for the
[1:36:03] house some some staple is that what you
[1:36:05] still say
[1:36:07] state pantry goods or staple goods
[1:36:09] things that last
[1:36:11] that you need when you're starting out a
[1:36:13] home
[1:36:14] luke was there recently and he put up
[1:36:17] amazing shelves in their pantry but it
[1:36:20] is very empty
[1:36:22] and they did not do that for jenna
[1:36:24] shower
[1:36:25] and uh we know that there have some
[1:36:27] there are several that have asked can we
[1:36:30] do that and not only can you we would
[1:36:32] love it it would be a real blessing
[1:36:35] benjamin is not only our son but he is
[1:36:38] the worship leader he does a fabulous
[1:36:40] job
[1:36:41] and he gives of himself
[1:36:44] i remember the criticism that that he
[1:36:46] has gotten through the years for for uh
[1:36:50] putting everything in i tell you as a
[1:36:52] pastor i'll never criticize somebody for
[1:36:55] putting everything they got in
[1:36:57] and if that comes across a little showy
[1:37:00] to you well i don't think you're able to
[1:37:02] see perhaps the sincerity of his heart
[1:37:05] and i would so much rather him move
[1:37:08] about
[1:37:09] and put everything that he's got into
[1:37:12] worship than be like an icicle
[1:37:16] and not only can he lead us
[1:37:19] and and does he put his worship in but
[1:37:21] he has an amazing voice too
[1:37:23] and i'm thankful for that that's an
[1:37:25] important part of leading worship is to
[1:37:27] be able to carry a tune without a bucket
[1:37:30] because you don't always have a bucket
[1:37:33] and god is good to him and certainly is
[1:37:35] so if you'd like to do that beginning uh
[1:37:37] next sunday or you can start tuesday
[1:37:40] night or next sunday you can bring in
[1:37:43] canned goods or anything that you would
[1:37:45] like to pass on to them to help them get
[1:37:47] started in their pantry life
[1:37:50] huh
[1:37:52] lots of vegetables
[1:37:54] lots of cans butter beans and
[1:37:57] all the things that he eats
[1:37:59] have they learned to can have they
[1:38:01] learned to can chicken fingers yet
[1:38:06] would you all feed jenna
[1:38:09] just feed her
[1:38:10] bring bring what bring what she might
[1:38:12] would like to eat
[1:38:14] um
[1:38:15] but anything like that pastas or
[1:38:17] whatever you ladies nobody has to tell
[1:38:19] the ladies what to do they know how to
[1:38:20] do it but let's just do that it it came
[1:38:23] in my heart i
[1:38:25] i said it to my wife i know she felt a
[1:38:27] little you know you just don't don't
[1:38:29] want to it's our son and i know that but
[1:38:32] i said i'm not doing it because he's our
[1:38:34] son i'm doing it because he's a worship
[1:38:36] leader because he holds an office in the
[1:38:38] church and it'd just be a wonderful way
[1:38:40] to honor them and for those of you that
[1:38:43] don't know their their uh
[1:38:45] situation is such that
[1:38:48] they are staying around and i i just i'm
[1:38:50] so happy
[1:38:52] because it's so hard
[1:38:54] uh to transition there
[1:38:56] and then say goodbye and then be gone
[1:38:58] for a week or two weeks or however long
[1:39:00] people do for honeymoons now
[1:39:03] but they're doing a tremendous thing
[1:39:05] because there's so many friends and
[1:39:07] family members she has a huge family so
[1:39:10] many friends and family members coming
[1:39:12] in from out of town that they're
[1:39:13] actually staying in the area
[1:39:16] uh for the weekend even though their
[1:39:18] wedding is on thursday evening they're
[1:39:20] staying there for the weekend and when
[1:39:22] we start flying back then they're going
[1:39:24] to drive back
[1:39:26] god bless them
[1:39:28] with a friend in the church there who's
[1:39:30] who's really bearing the expense of
[1:39:33] getting the rest of her belongings here
[1:39:35] as a gift as a wedding gift and that is
[1:39:37] a real blessing they operate a
[1:39:39] professional company that does that kind
[1:39:41] of kind of thing
[1:39:43] and then they're going to be around with
[1:39:45] us for a couple of weeks
[1:39:47] uh before they actually go on honeymoon
[1:39:49] so those pantry items will be helpful
[1:39:52] when they come home
[1:39:54] because he needs to learn right away
[1:39:58] that dinner at mama's is by appointment
[1:40:03] because that uh that grocery bill needs
[1:40:05] to be shifting now
[1:40:07] this is a great time for us to start
[1:40:09] thinking about our future
[1:40:13] how many of you know that's not gonna
[1:40:14] work
[1:40:16] we're just gonna draw the line when the
[1:40:17] laundry basket comes that's where the
[1:40:20] line is gonna be drawn she's told him no
[1:40:23] more
[1:40:24] laundry
[1:40:26] and that's for somebody who changes
[1:40:28] clothes three times a day maybe four
[1:40:32] he wouldn't think of wearing a pair of
[1:40:33] jeans without washing them
[1:40:38] amen let's stand in that real spiritual
[1:40:41] way to start the sermon
[1:40:43] it is a truth
[1:40:45] and i wanted to mention that there might
[1:40:47] have been something else we needed to
[1:40:49] get in and then we'll all be gathered
[1:40:51] back
[1:40:53] here some of us will be here for tuesday
[1:40:55] night july the 5th a tuesday night
[1:40:58] service and then the following sunday
[1:41:00] everybody should be back from holiday
[1:41:02] and we want to welcome all of you that
[1:41:04] are streaming the service around the
[1:41:06] world
[1:41:08] some are local and some as far away as
[1:41:10] trinidad and israel and the netherlands
[1:41:12] and
[1:41:13] uh tucson and south africa and and ghana
[1:41:18] and kenya and canada
[1:41:20] and it goes on and on and god bless
[1:41:22] every one of you
[1:41:23] psalms 112 are you ready
[1:41:26] you got to be ready now because i know
[1:41:28] we've had a lot of things let's thank
[1:41:30] god for these musicians
[1:41:32] i wanted them to hear those
[1:41:34] announcements
[1:41:37] and this has been an odd service and
[1:41:39] taking so much time but
[1:41:41] we needed to do it
[1:41:44] psalms 112.
[1:41:46] i'm going to be reading in the amplified
[1:41:48] version of the bible and we're going to
[1:41:50] read 10 verses
[1:41:52] praise the lord
[1:41:54] hallelujah
[1:41:56] blessed happy fortunate to be envied
[1:42:00] is the man who fears
[1:42:03] reveres
[1:42:04] and worships the lord
[1:42:07] who delights greatly
[1:42:10] in his commandments does anybody know
[1:42:12] any men like that i do
[1:42:15] i do his spiritual offspring
[1:42:18] shall be mighty upon the earth and king
[1:42:22] james says his seed
[1:42:25] and remember that the word seed is both
[1:42:29] singular and plural
[1:42:31] the generation of the upright shall be
[1:42:34] blessed
[1:42:36] prosperity and welfare are in his house
[1:42:40] that's not a government a program of
[1:42:42] assistance there it's wellness
[1:42:45] and his righteousness
[1:42:48] endures
[1:42:50] forever
[1:42:51] it outlives him
[1:42:54] because it's not his righteousness
[1:42:56] it's the lord's
[1:42:58] imparted righteousness he leaves behind
[1:43:02] a legacy of righteousness for his seed
[1:43:05] that's pretty powerful isn't it
[1:43:08] light arises in the darkness for the
[1:43:11] upright gracious compassionate and just
[1:43:16] who are in right standing with god when
[1:43:19] you read the word upright
[1:43:21] this is what it means it means standing
[1:43:23] upright
[1:43:24] standing right with god
[1:43:28] it is well with the man who deals
[1:43:32] generously
[1:43:34] and lends
[1:43:36] now
[1:43:37] we get that and lends from from the
[1:43:40] hebrew expression that's used here
[1:43:45] and there are some people who believe
[1:43:47] that it's not christ-like
[1:43:50] to lend money to the brethren
[1:43:53] we should just give it well if you can
[1:43:55] give it give it
[1:43:57] but it is not against the word to lend
[1:44:00] to require interest is
[1:44:03] when it's
[1:44:04] unfair
[1:44:06] you see the difference
[1:44:08] if you need a little something extra if
[1:44:10] it's a large amount and you're saying
[1:44:12] i'd like to loan you this at a a cheaper
[1:44:16] interest rate than you could get at the
[1:44:17] bank but i have this money i can't lose
[1:44:20] it but i want to do this for you and
[1:44:22] you're doing it uh without usury
[1:44:26] you're doing it
[1:44:27] fairly
[1:44:28] and i want you to know it is absolutely
[1:44:31] a christ-like thing to do to be good to
[1:44:34] brothers and sisters
[1:44:36] amen you can't always just write a check
[1:44:39] sometimes you have to say in fact there
[1:44:42] are certain circumstances where it's a
[1:44:44] wiser decision to say i'm willing to
[1:44:47] loan you this money
[1:44:48] than it is to give it
[1:44:51] there are certain circumstances you're
[1:44:53] quiet already
[1:44:54] it is well with a man who deals
[1:44:57] generously and lends
[1:44:59] who conducts his affairs with justice
[1:45:04] he will not be moved forever the
[1:45:07] uncompromisingly righteous
[1:45:09] the upright in right standing with god
[1:45:13] shall be
[1:45:14] in everlasting
[1:45:16] remembrance
[1:45:17] he shall not be afraid of bad news
[1:45:22] evil tidings
[1:45:23] his heart is what
[1:45:26] firmly fixed how many of you know we've
[1:45:29] shown you in hebrew and greek where the
[1:45:32] heart and the mind are connected
[1:45:36] so his heart his mind is firmly fixed
[1:45:39] he's determined
[1:45:42] trusting
[1:45:43] leaning on and being confident
[1:45:47] in the lord it's powerful
[1:45:49] his heart is established
[1:45:53] and steady
[1:45:55] remember that the heart and the mind
[1:45:58] is the seat of the emotions
[1:46:01] so it's very important that our emotions
[1:46:04] are established
[1:46:06] and steady we're not all over the place
[1:46:10] he will not be afraid while he waits to
[1:46:13] see his desire established upon his
[1:46:17] adversaries
[1:46:19] he has distributed freely he has given
[1:46:22] to the poor and needy his righteousness
[1:46:26] uprightness and right standing with god
[1:46:30] endures forever his horn
[1:46:34] his authority shall be exalted in honor
[1:46:39] that's powerful
[1:46:40] word let's get that again
[1:46:43] his
[1:46:44] horn which is his authority shall be
[1:46:46] exalted in
[1:46:48] honor it's always right to honor the
[1:46:51] righteous man the godly man the man of
[1:46:54] integrity he should be honored not
[1:46:57] worshipped
[1:46:59] honored
[1:47:00] he has distributed freely all right go
[1:47:02] on to the next verse the wicked man will
[1:47:04] see it and be grieved
[1:47:07] and angered
[1:47:09] not only jealous
[1:47:11] but angered
[1:47:13] he will gnash his teeth
[1:47:15] and disappear in despair
[1:47:18] the desire of the wicked shall perish
[1:47:21] and come to nothing
[1:47:24] amen
[1:47:25] even though he gnashes his teeth against
[1:47:27] the righteous man the lord will preserve
[1:47:30] the righteousness of the godly
[1:47:32] hallelujah and the wicked shall perish
[1:47:35] and come to nothing you don't have to
[1:47:37] curse them
[1:47:39] they curse themselves
[1:47:41] you don't have to put something on them
[1:47:43] they're putting something on them
[1:47:44] themselves when they mistreat you
[1:47:48] they're already bringing a curse upon
[1:47:50] their own life come on now
[1:47:52] you you've been in the restaurant there
[1:47:54] when you started getting bad treatment
[1:47:56] for no reason
[1:47:58] you can see that other people are
[1:48:00] getting amazing service but from the
[1:48:03] same person you're getting
[1:48:05] anger almost
[1:48:07] you wonder why it's because the presence
[1:48:11] has shifted because you're there and
[1:48:13] those spirits will get stirred up
[1:48:16] because of who you are don't let it
[1:48:18] disturb your peace
[1:48:21] leave a big tip
[1:48:25] and a big smile
[1:48:27] and go out of there
[1:48:29] not cursing the restaurant or the server
[1:48:31] lord open their eyes and let them see
[1:48:34] that they can also have the blessing in
[1:48:36] favor of the lord
[1:48:37] we're way too quick to judge people
[1:48:40] when we ought to be releasing mercy to
[1:48:42] them i want you to say amen
[1:48:45] father we love you today we thank you
[1:48:47] for every upright and godly person in
[1:48:50] this house
[1:48:52] we especially pay tribute and honor
[1:48:54] every man of god under the sound of our
[1:48:57] voices
[1:48:59] we're not using the term man of god for
[1:49:02] pulpit ministry only but we're using
[1:49:05] that term for every man who has made the
[1:49:09] decision to follow the instruction of
[1:49:12] the lord
[1:49:13] may they be blessed today
[1:49:15] may they be honored and strengthened
[1:49:18] today
[1:49:19] may the holy spirit come and guide them
[1:49:22] and lead them and direct them
[1:49:25] if there are corrections to be made in
[1:49:27] their life send the word
[1:49:30] send the word lord to correct us
[1:49:34] wrap your arms around us and remind us o
[1:49:38] god that you are with us
[1:49:40] all the way even to the end
[1:49:44] we pray against every curse
[1:49:46] that might fall upon us by the wicked by
[1:49:50] the angry by the jealous by the
[1:49:52] resentful we thank you for raising up a
[1:49:55] standard we break every authority of
[1:49:57] every word curse and we come against all
[1:50:00] witchcraft against the saints of god
[1:50:04] and we thank you for your righteousness
[1:50:07] and your
[1:50:08] holiness your favor upon our lives
[1:50:13] we give you the glory and the honor and
[1:50:15] the praise for it's in the name of the
[1:50:17] lord jesus christ we pray and the saint
[1:50:19] said
[1:50:20] amen you may be seated i need just a
[1:50:22] little more in the monitor not in the
[1:50:24] house
[1:50:29] man who fears the lord
[1:50:32] this is not a
[1:50:35] cowering in the corner fear
[1:50:39] this is not fearing the white wigged one
[1:50:43] with hammer in his hand
[1:50:45] this fear the fear of the lord
[1:50:49] is reverential fear
[1:50:51] it's awe it's reverence
[1:50:54] it's standing
[1:50:56] in awe of the holiness
[1:50:59] and the authority of god
[1:51:02] and the bible said that a man who fears
[1:51:05] the lord who reverences the lord who
[1:51:07] worships the lord who delights greatly
[1:51:10] in the commandments of the lord that man
[1:51:13] is blessed
[1:51:15] what god blesses you
[1:51:18] should be careful about cursing
[1:51:20] is that right
[1:51:22] god said i'll bless those who bless you
[1:51:25] and i'll curse those who curse you you
[1:51:27] say he was speaking about israel well
[1:51:30] don't you know
[1:51:31] that you are the royal seed of abraham
[1:51:34] did you know that the promises of god
[1:51:36] made to the natural seed of abraham are
[1:51:38] yours by the covenant of grace
[1:51:42] you are grafted in i am grafted in
[1:51:46] and we have every right and when we hear
[1:51:49] a warning like we heard this morning
[1:51:51] from sister jaya's anointed song
[1:51:54] calling the sons of israel
[1:51:57] back to their god out from under the
[1:52:00] leadership of the queen of the land the
[1:52:03] jezebel spirit that rules our nation and
[1:52:06] that call of the spirit calling us back
[1:52:09] to come under submission to the god of
[1:52:12] israel that's not just to the jews
[1:52:14] that was the spirit of god calling you
[1:52:16] and i back to the god of our fathers
[1:52:19] come on
[1:52:21] all the way back to where we started
[1:52:23] this journey
[1:52:24] maybe we have grown and matured and we
[1:52:27] have experienced many things but
[1:52:30] sometimes we lose our first love and
[1:52:33] this is the way that god calls us back
[1:52:35] to that place of passion where when we
[1:52:38] say jesus i love you it's not just some
[1:52:41] words coming out of our mouth but
[1:52:43] there's passion in our voice
[1:52:45] and we're connected to that praise
[1:52:48] and i want to read psalms 128 verse 1
[1:52:52] through 6. i'm not going to spend all my
[1:52:54] time today on fathers or ungodly men but
[1:52:58] i want to i want to use some of the time
[1:53:00] because we have some men here who are
[1:53:03] are worthy of honor and they should
[1:53:06] receive some of this attention that
[1:53:09] they're getting this morning they should
[1:53:10] get it more often
[1:53:12] but we want to take a moment this is
[1:53:14] psalm 128 and the first six verses start
[1:53:18] off very similar to the other blessed
[1:53:21] happy fortunate to be envied is everyone
[1:53:27] genderless
[1:53:29] who fears
[1:53:30] reveres
[1:53:32] and worships the lord
[1:53:34] who walks in his ways
[1:53:41] what is the difference between saying i
[1:53:43] love the lord and loving the lord
[1:53:46] it's the one who walks in his
[1:53:50] ways
[1:53:51] if we say we love the lord and we don't
[1:53:54] keep the instructions of the lord we lie
[1:53:57] bible said the truth is not even in us
[1:54:00] we have some kind of superficial idea of
[1:54:03] what it means to love the lord because
[1:54:05] when you love him you want to obey him
[1:54:09] and when you love him you want to please
[1:54:11] him
[1:54:12] and when you love him you want to round
[1:54:14] your tithe up instead of rounding it
[1:54:16] down
[1:54:17] you want to go the extra mile
[1:54:22] a friend of ours who was a female
[1:54:26] missionary to china
[1:54:29] and she was used in many nations of the
[1:54:33] world
[1:54:34] and she was sent on many occasion
[1:54:38] to speak
[1:54:39] to rulers
[1:54:41] of nations including
[1:54:44] a divine appointment with the king of
[1:54:46] nepal
[1:54:48] and
[1:54:49] the the leader of ethiopia
[1:54:53] holly salasi
[1:54:54] she was sent
[1:54:56] uh
[1:54:57] in an unbelievable way
[1:55:00] a way that reminds you only of the book
[1:55:02] of acts can you imagine god speaking to
[1:55:05] someone and saying
[1:55:06] today i want you to fly
[1:55:09] to to ethiopia to the airport and i want
[1:55:13] you to check in the closest hotel and i
[1:55:15] want you to wait for further instruction
[1:55:18] i don't know many men that would pack a
[1:55:20] bag
[1:55:23] but i i know a woman who did
[1:55:26] and regardless of what you might say
[1:55:28] about that he was using her
[1:55:31] in a tremendous way
[1:55:33] and this woman never married
[1:55:36] she is with the lord now
[1:55:39] and i met her because
[1:55:41] god showed me a vision of her face
[1:55:44] i had never seen her before to my
[1:55:47] knowledge
[1:55:48] and god showed me a vision of her face
[1:55:51] she reminded me of my grandmother much
[1:55:53] younger
[1:55:54] different color hair
[1:55:56] but the same kind of beehive or french
[1:55:59] twist and
[1:56:01] similar in size
[1:56:06] i later found out similar in voice
[1:56:10] but god showed me only a picture of her
[1:56:12] face and he said i'm going to give you a
[1:56:15] word for her
[1:56:17] and i'm going to give her a word for you
[1:56:22] there was a mobile home that sat on this
[1:56:24] property right here where the church is
[1:56:26] sitting today
[1:56:28] and that mobile home served for some
[1:56:31] time
[1:56:32] as an office for myself
[1:56:35] and
[1:56:36] we used it for storage because we've
[1:56:38] always had a lack of storage problem and
[1:56:41] that's because we have a pastor who's a
[1:56:43] pack rat
[1:56:44] and i admit it
[1:56:46] and uh
[1:56:47] will not likely change but anyway
[1:56:50] um
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:52] it quickly became a place for refugees
[1:56:54] to stay and so we often have someone in
[1:56:58] there so i i never really got to use it
[1:57:00] for an office because i didn't want to
[1:57:03] disturb people you know there were
[1:57:04] people that would be in there and
[1:57:06] staying there and if i named names it
[1:57:08] would bring smiles to some of your faces
[1:57:10] and it would remind you that we've just
[1:57:12] been through it
[1:57:16] we've just been through it
[1:57:18] one of the men who lived there stole
[1:57:21] from us
[1:57:22] more than one of the men who lived there
[1:57:25] the one of the men who lived there stole
[1:57:27] from us
[1:57:28] and uh a lot
[1:57:31] and
[1:57:32] i called the police to him
[1:57:35] because that's what everybody said you
[1:57:36] have to do you must let people know or
[1:57:40] we'll never get this stuff back you've
[1:57:42] got to let the authorities know
[1:57:44] and so i did just that i called the
[1:57:46] police
[1:57:47] and then i rushed over here to tell him
[1:57:50] get out
[1:57:53] leave as fast as you can
[1:57:55] because i've called the police and
[1:57:57] they're on the way
[1:58:00] i knew he would be no good to any of us
[1:58:02] in jail
[1:58:04] i wasn't a ver i wasn't wasn't angry
[1:58:06] enough to to to let him go off
[1:58:09] and
[1:58:10] our little boys were playing that night
[1:58:12] they were involved in what was going on
[1:58:14] and uh they couldn't couldn't keep it
[1:58:16] from them i mean they were rushing
[1:58:18] around with us
[1:58:19] and benjamin and joshua and they're
[1:58:21] playing with their little cars and they
[1:58:22] said all right brother so-and-so get in
[1:58:24] the back of the police car here
[1:58:28] that's when you realize that ministers
[1:58:30] families know way too much
[1:58:34] but moving right along
[1:58:36] i was in the mobile home that day and
[1:58:39] and and for those of you that don't like
[1:58:41] where i'm going
[1:58:42] uh
[1:58:43] you need to know that there are people
[1:58:45] among us who actually ask me on occasion
[1:58:48] to tell more stories
[1:58:51] so i'm pleasing them today i'm telling a
[1:58:53] story
[1:58:54] i don't often remember to tell them
[1:58:56] but anyway i i had this in my mind
[1:59:00] who is this woman
[1:59:02] how will i ever find this woman
[1:59:05] i'm supposed to go and give her a word
[1:59:07] from the lord and she will have a word
[1:59:10] from the lord for me you see i believe
[1:59:12] in gifted people
[1:59:15] and i really like it when i can find
[1:59:17] someone gifted and also has integrity
[1:59:21] that's rare it's not rare to find gifted
[1:59:23] people but it's it's more rare to find
[1:59:25] gifted people with integrity you can say
[1:59:27] amen now
[1:59:29] anytime you want to
[1:59:31] and i was moving a box of old magazines
[1:59:35] from one closet to the next
[1:59:38] i just spent a lot of time just shifting
[1:59:40] my junk
[1:59:42] to keep it from going out the door
[1:59:46] and i had some antique nearly antique
[1:59:49] way back
[1:59:50] uh
[1:59:52] copies of charisma magazine
[1:59:56] which is a magazine for many years that
[1:59:58] has chronicled the pentecostal and
[2:00:00] charismatic happenings in the world and
[2:00:03] i i've read it i read it faithfully for
[2:00:05] years i haven't read one in a while now
[2:00:07] but i read it faithfully for years
[2:00:10] and i had some old copies that i had
[2:00:12] kept because somewhere in that magazine
[2:00:15] was something that was significant to me
[2:00:17] so i kept the whole magazine right
[2:00:20] even though i was told just clip what
[2:00:22] you want and throw the rest away i would
[2:00:24] keep the whole thing so as i'm moving
[2:00:26] this box the top magazine slides out
[2:00:30] onto the floor and the page opens the
[2:00:33] magazine opens and i go down to pick it
[2:00:36] up and there she is
[2:00:38] in the magazine
[2:00:41] it just shocked me
[2:00:44] well i just throwed myself right down in
[2:00:46] the floor
[2:00:48] and gave honor to god
[2:00:50] for showing me
[2:00:52] and then began the journey of how i
[2:00:54] would get to her
[2:00:56] now the reason why she was in that
[2:00:58] magazine is because her family had been
[2:01:00] hosting a pentecostal camp meeting for
[2:01:03] over 50 years
[2:01:05] and she had been living in israel
[2:01:08] for most of those years
[2:01:11] her brother who directed the camp had
[2:01:14] passed away and she had been invited to
[2:01:17] come back from israel and lead that camp
[2:01:21] that summer
[2:01:22] and so her picture
[2:01:24] was there as
[2:01:27] as director
[2:01:29] of this pentecostal camp
[2:01:31] and so i began to try to find out a
[2:01:34] little bit more about who she was
[2:01:37] and i found out she had written a book
[2:01:39] and i ordered the book
[2:01:41] and to my surprise as i'm sitting in the
[2:01:43] yard one day reading that book she
[2:01:46] begins to mention the sound of heaven
[2:01:50] on the voice of william branham when her
[2:01:53] and her family were in his meeting in
[2:01:55] richmond virginia
[2:01:57] and it so reminded me of what god had
[2:02:00] spoken to my heart about the first time
[2:02:02] that i heard the voice his voice and how
[2:02:05] i had known that god was using his voice
[2:02:09] to speak to my heart in a way that i'd
[2:02:11] never been spoken to before so it so
[2:02:13] captured and connected me to her that i
[2:02:16] began to make some phone calls and the
[2:02:18] story is too long to tell but the woman
[2:02:21] who answered the phone she began to to
[2:02:24] sort of prophesy to me on the phone
[2:02:27] i'm asking questions well when does the
[2:02:29] camp start and and who will be the
[2:02:32] speakers and she named only ladies
[2:02:36] and i said don't you all have any men
[2:02:38] preachers too and she just laughed at me
[2:02:41] like i'm just a
[2:02:42] nut
[2:02:43] oh
[2:02:44] she said sure we do but but but at the
[2:02:47] beginning there it's mostly ladies that
[2:02:49] are going to be speaking and i thought
[2:02:51] well i i would kind of be
[2:02:53] uncomfortable in in that kind of a
[2:02:55] situation i think to begin with i i've
[2:02:57] not been outside of my own circles in so
[2:03:00] long and i'm just kind of talking out
[2:03:03] loud and
[2:03:04] she said can i sing you a song
[2:03:08] i said uh well you know
[2:03:11] yes ma'am and she says let
[2:03:14] the river flow
[2:03:19] let
[2:03:20] the river flow
[2:03:26] holy spirit come
[2:03:30] come
[2:03:32] in
[2:03:33] power
[2:03:36] let the river
[2:03:40] flow let the river
[2:03:44] flow
[2:03:46] let
[2:03:48] the river
[2:03:51] flow
[2:03:54] and i was hooked
[2:03:57] my heart
[2:03:59] was hooked
[2:04:01] there was such an anointing
[2:04:03] that came across that telephone line
[2:04:06] i was hooked i didn't care what i was
[2:04:08] going to face
[2:04:09] when i got there i just knew that i
[2:04:10] needed to be there
[2:04:12] for those meetings
[2:04:14] she began to prophesy to me and she said
[2:04:19] the lord is going to do some things for
[2:04:22] you he's going to i don't want to say
[2:04:24] the things it doesn't matter i don't
[2:04:25] remember him all but she began to
[2:04:27] prophesy good things to me but here's
[2:04:29] where she really got me
[2:04:32] we had had a luncheon at the church a
[2:04:35] few services before and
[2:04:37] sister weems had
[2:04:38] decorated
[2:04:40] my place at the table
[2:04:43] with a little pot
[2:04:44] of my favorite flower
[2:04:48] pansies
[2:04:49] they're my favorite flower because they
[2:04:52] were my grandfather's favorite flower he
[2:04:54] loved them dearly
[2:04:56] and in my one of my first experiences in
[2:04:59] heaven
[2:05:00] i saw
[2:05:01] pansies there
[2:05:03] and i knew that my grandad had somehow
[2:05:06] connected to that flower because of its
[2:05:08] presence in eternity
[2:05:11] in fact when i saw those flowers there
[2:05:13] they had faces like a pansy does
[2:05:17] but very different these faces were
[2:05:19] faces
[2:05:21] and these faces followed me
[2:05:24] wherever i went
[2:05:26] i watched the flowers turn
[2:05:29] as i walked along the way now i'm
[2:05:31] telling you that will spook you
[2:05:33] you said you mean you're already having
[2:05:35] an
[2:05:36] experience uh
[2:05:37] like that and you're not already spooked
[2:05:39] no i wasn't it was quite common in those
[2:05:42] days but it really
[2:05:44] was a pleasant but but unusual feeling
[2:05:48] to watch everything so alive the blades
[2:05:51] of grass were so alive
[2:05:55] the flowers so alive as though they had
[2:05:58] personality
[2:06:00] as though they had passion
[2:06:02] you i tell you that will make a
[2:06:04] difference
[2:06:06] sister weems had had taken that little
[2:06:09] pot of pansies that she had potted and
[2:06:12] someone
[2:06:14] maybe not even her she placed it at my
[2:06:16] seat where i was eating
[2:06:18] but someone took it and placed it on the
[2:06:21] corner of my desk and i didn't even know
[2:06:23] it was there there are no windows in my
[2:06:25] office and so i rarely had anything
[2:06:27] living in there and this woman begins to
[2:06:31] prophesy to me and she said brother i
[2:06:34] don't want to offend you but i see you
[2:06:37] as a flower she might even be listening
[2:06:39] to this today
[2:06:42] i see you like a flower she said i know
[2:06:44] that's not what men like to think about
[2:06:46] themselves as but but i see you like a
[2:06:49] flower
[2:06:50] and she said frozen
[2:06:53] in the winter snow well no i didn't
[2:06:55] really want to think about myself as a
[2:06:57] flower
[2:06:58] and i didn't really want to think of
[2:06:59] myself as being frozen
[2:07:02] but she said no don't don't be offended
[2:07:04] she said because when the sun comes out
[2:07:08] i i see that little flower she said oh
[2:07:12] in fact
[2:07:13] just like that little pot of pansies on
[2:07:16] the corner of your desk there
[2:07:22] and so
[2:07:23] literally i'm on the phone like this
[2:07:25] reared back in my chair and i literally
[2:07:26] go
[2:07:32] and there they were
[2:07:34] she said just like that little pot of
[2:07:36] pansies there on the end of your your
[2:07:38] desk i see you like that all bowed over
[2:07:41] in the snow but when the s-o-n comes out
[2:07:44] and shines on you she said like those
[2:07:47] little flowers do in the winter she said
[2:07:48] i just see you turn in your face toward
[2:07:51] the sun
[2:07:53] she said can i sing for you again sure
[2:07:55] let the river flow
[2:07:57] this was the most unusual phone
[2:07:59] conversation i've ever had
[2:08:01] but god used it in a profound way
[2:08:05] my wife and i went and we didn't have
[2:08:07] the money to go and
[2:08:09] god used unusual circumstances to help
[2:08:12] us get there we we flew there and back
[2:08:15] round trip for 79
[2:08:19] when we went to rent a car we rented a
[2:08:21] car for less than 50 bucks for the
[2:08:24] several days we were going to be there
[2:08:25] he gave us favor
[2:08:28] he sent unusual people to our house who
[2:08:32] normally wouldn't have been in excited
[2:08:34] about me going to a place where there
[2:08:37] were so many women preachers but god
[2:08:39] used some people like that to come and
[2:08:41] bring money and lay it on my hand and
[2:08:44] say god wanted me to help you get there
[2:08:47] many many
[2:08:48] confirmations came along
[2:08:51] i told all of that
[2:08:54] to tell you something she said
[2:08:59] she was never married
[2:09:02] she met
[2:09:05] gwen shaw
[2:09:07] who was a missionary in hong kong at the
[2:09:11] time
[2:09:12] they met each other as young
[2:09:14] holiness girls pentecostal girls
[2:09:18] who had a passion and a burden
[2:09:21] for the nations
[2:09:23] she fell in love
[2:09:26] and
[2:09:27] he wrote her on the mission field
[2:09:31] and god began to call her to a higher
[2:09:34] walk with him
[2:09:36] and he began to express more of
[2:09:39] how he wanted their life to be and
[2:09:42] she couldn't see the picket fence and
[2:09:45] she couldn't see the
[2:09:46] the quiet life
[2:09:49] her heart had already been touched by
[2:09:51] china
[2:09:53] she had already been touched by the
[2:09:56] hungry people in the nations of the
[2:09:58] world
[2:09:59] not always needing a preacher but
[2:10:02] sometimes just needing somebody to walk
[2:10:04] it out with them
[2:10:07] she didn't know how she would ever
[2:10:08] settle in to a normal life
[2:10:11] once the nations had got in her blood
[2:10:14] i'm telling you
[2:10:16] it's contagious
[2:10:18] when you feel the pull of the nations
[2:10:20] it's hard not to go
[2:10:22] it's hard not to be a part of that
[2:10:25] and so
[2:10:26] uh
[2:10:27] you know he
[2:10:29] it broke her heart
[2:10:31] but their relationship ended
[2:10:34] and she dedicated the rest of her life
[2:10:37] short life
[2:10:39] only in her early 60s
[2:10:42] she dedicated that to the lord
[2:10:45] she said some things that i will never
[2:10:47] forget
[2:10:48] and one of the things that came to my
[2:10:50] mind as i was sharing that i don't even
[2:10:52] know why i'm sharing this
[2:10:54] but one of the things that came to my
[2:10:56] mind was she said you know
[2:10:58] i once had a love
[2:11:02] and i you may think i'm not qualified to
[2:11:04] speak about that
[2:11:06] because i'm never married
[2:11:09] but she said
[2:11:12] when you love someone
[2:11:16] you want to discover
[2:11:18] who they are
[2:11:21] you want to know what they like
[2:11:24] follow me you want to know what they
[2:11:26] don't like
[2:11:29] you want to know what they prefer
[2:11:31] you you don't just fall in love with the
[2:11:34] with the features of a face
[2:11:37] she said when you really love someone
[2:11:39] you find yourself loving the oddest
[2:11:41] things about them
[2:11:44] the way they stand
[2:11:47] the sound of their voice
[2:11:50] and she said when you
[2:11:52] really love the lord it behooves you to
[2:11:55] to want to discover what he loves
[2:12:00] what brings pleasure to his heart what
[2:12:03] makes him
[2:12:04] glad
[2:12:06] what blesses him we sing bless the lord
[2:12:09] o my soul what really blesses the lord
[2:12:13] what really causes him to delight
[2:12:16] and she said like you would uh someone
[2:12:19] in the earth that you loved uh a
[2:12:21] boyfriend or some girlfriend she she
[2:12:24] said you you would want to find out what
[2:12:27] kind of pie he likes
[2:12:30] because you'd have this desire to beg
[2:12:32] for him but you wouldn't want to bake
[2:12:33] him a cherry pie and find out that he
[2:12:36] couldn't stand cherry pie
[2:12:39] and everyone knew that but you
[2:12:42] so you'd have to spend time with him is
[2:12:44] anybody following me
[2:12:46] you'd have to spend time with him and
[2:12:48] and discover over a period of time what
[2:12:51] he likes and what he doesn't like she
[2:12:53] said that's the way it is with the lord
[2:12:55] if you really want to please god you've
[2:12:58] got to find out what causes him pleasure
[2:13:01] you've got to discover what he likes and
[2:13:03] what he doesn't like and you stay away
[2:13:05] from those things that the lord doesn't
[2:13:08] like and when you find that there's a
[2:13:10] particular thing that brings him
[2:13:13] pleasure and the life that's what you
[2:13:14] want to do over and over again anybody
[2:13:16] hearing me this morning
[2:13:18] this is not a message just for women
[2:13:22] this is a message for us men
[2:13:25] it behooves us to discover what god
[2:13:29] likes and i've just read you a scripture
[2:13:32] that tells us what god likes he likes a
[2:13:35] man of integrity
[2:13:37] he likes a man of worship
[2:13:40] he likes a man of passion
[2:13:42] he likes a giver
[2:13:45] he likes someone who's generous
[2:13:48] who's willing to lend to those who have
[2:13:51] me who's willing to give to those who
[2:13:54] are more most unfortunate among us a man
[2:13:58] of compassion
[2:14:02] you know the world has a crazy idea of
[2:14:05] what a man's man is
[2:14:06] [Music]
[2:14:09] crazy
[2:14:10] idea they think it's something like how
[2:14:13] many knives he has on his belt
[2:14:17] or how many fires he's ever started with
[2:14:19] two sticks
[2:14:21] but i want to tell you something god has
[2:14:23] a different idea of what manhood really
[2:14:26] is
[2:14:27] he's looking for men that will walk and
[2:14:30] whoa i feel him
[2:14:32] walk in his commandments if you don't
[2:14:34] ever open the book you can't know what
[2:14:36] his instructions are
[2:14:38] god give us a passion for the word
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:42] may we have strength to turn off netflix
[2:14:45] and get our faces in his book
[2:14:49] and discover what he wants from us in
[2:14:52] this hour like we sung last sunday there
[2:14:55] ain't no time for playing around
[2:14:58] it's lost or found it's hot or cold it's
[2:15:01] black or white
[2:15:03] it's choose the way of the lord or your
[2:15:06] own way but you can no longer do a
[2:15:09] little of both
[2:15:10] stand straddle the fence
[2:15:13] is anybody hearing me
[2:15:15] the lukewarmness that has gripped the
[2:15:17] church it must not be a part of the
[2:15:19] bride's life
[2:15:21] we weren't called to just be the church
[2:15:23] we're called to be the wife of the
[2:15:25] bridegroom the lord jesus christ
[2:15:29] so we need to discover what he likes
[2:15:32] i don't think it's a pie flavor we're
[2:15:33] going to find out about him but we're
[2:15:36] going to read the word and we're going
[2:15:38] to see that he likes men who handle
[2:15:40] their affairs
[2:15:42] with justice
[2:15:45] anybody listening am i getting too
[2:15:46] emotional
[2:15:48] this is a passionate subject for me
[2:15:51] men who don't cheat
[2:15:54] men who don't lie
[2:15:56] men who don't exaggerate
[2:15:59] and when they do they catch themselves
[2:16:01] and they say hey that might be a little
[2:16:02] bit of an exaggeration
[2:16:04] maybe the fish was this long
[2:16:07] instead of this long
[2:16:09] some things are too big
[2:16:11] to be an exaggeration
[2:16:13] they're just a lie
[2:16:15] anybody with me
[2:16:16] i didn't always go in here but here we
[2:16:18] are
[2:16:21] it's so important
[2:16:22] expecting somebody else to pay your way
[2:16:26] or to pay your families away
[2:16:29] when the bible tells us it's our
[2:16:31] responsibility as men i want you to know
[2:16:34] when i look around this room i see men
[2:16:36] who are not lazy
[2:16:38] and i see men who work
[2:16:41] not one job and more than one job
[2:16:44] to provide for their family
[2:16:47] instead of working one and allowing
[2:16:48] somebody else to bear the burden of
[2:16:50] taking care of their family they realize
[2:16:52] if one can't do it i'll have to get me
[2:16:54] another one
[2:16:56] and that doesn't mean that i can't be
[2:16:58] there for my children on top of all of
[2:17:00] the other
[2:17:03] i've still got to be there for my kids
[2:17:07] i want you to know the reason why some
[2:17:08] of these young men
[2:17:10] have grown up to be men like that is
[2:17:12] because it was the it was the behavior
[2:17:13] that was modeled for them they may not
[2:17:16] have had a father who was emotionally
[2:17:17] supportive but there are many people in
[2:17:19] this room who can say i had a dad that
[2:17:21] worked hard
[2:17:23] to provide for his family how many of
[2:17:25] you know that's valuable in this hour to
[2:17:28] have a dad who worked hard to provide
[2:17:31] for his family
[2:17:33] everything you see that your dad was
[2:17:35] lacking you have a grand and glorious
[2:17:38] opportunity to be what he was
[2:17:41] and so much more
[2:17:44] and god is calling us
[2:17:46] because we're not only casting we're not
[2:17:48] only responsible for our natural
[2:17:51] offspring but a man of righteousness and
[2:17:53] integrity who walks uprightly before the
[2:17:56] lord and follows the instructions of god
[2:17:58] he leaves in his wake spiritual seed
[2:18:02] he leaves behind him spiritual sons and
[2:18:05] daughters
[2:18:06] that he's also responsible for
[2:18:09] to walk upright and holy and set apart
[2:18:13] and sanctified and to remember that
[2:18:15] little things matter i want to tell you
[2:18:17] something i have told my family since
[2:18:19] day one details matter
[2:18:23] they matter
[2:18:25] they matter
[2:18:26] little details matter when you're
[2:18:27] telling something details matter
[2:18:30] when you're looking for something
[2:18:31] details matter
[2:18:33] it's important sometimes we we we have
[2:18:35] this tendency to cover up for ourselves
[2:18:39] [Music]
[2:18:41] we have a tendency to blame others for
[2:18:43] our own mistakes
[2:18:45] and i'm telling you god is raising up
[2:18:48] if you don't understand me if you think
[2:18:50] i'm here whooping me and i'm actually
[2:18:51] here raising them up god is raising up
[2:18:54] men who have no desire to cover up their
[2:18:58] sin who have no desire to cover up their
[2:19:00] shortcoming they just desire to bring
[2:19:02] all of that into the presence of the
[2:19:04] lord and see what god will do with it
[2:19:07] when you come to him bring it all
[2:19:10] somebody said but the lord said i can't
[2:19:11] ascend to the hill of the lord you come
[2:19:13] stand at the bottom of the hill and
[2:19:16] worship god
[2:19:17] with everything you have
[2:19:22] your warts
[2:19:24] your lack of integrity if you have it
[2:19:27] your anger issues
[2:19:29] your inferiorities your insecurities
[2:19:33] don't you let any of those things keep
[2:19:35] you from worshiping the lord
[2:19:37] if you can't worship on the holy heel
[2:19:39] you worship at the bottom of the holy
[2:19:41] hill and you say here i am lord
[2:19:44] with all my failures with all my sin
[2:19:48] with all my unbelief with all my
[2:19:51] hang-ups with all my slacknesses but i'm
[2:19:54] here to worship you and to call you holy
[2:19:59] and to call you god sovereign god
[2:20:03] sovereign
[2:20:05] god supreme
[2:20:07] the only true
[2:20:09] living god
[2:20:11] not three pieces of pie
[2:20:14] trying to function as one but one god
[2:20:19] functioning in three divine offices and
[2:20:22] many more expressions of who he is
[2:20:25] in the everyday life of the believer
[2:20:28] he's not looking for subjects
[2:20:31] he's looking for servants
[2:20:34] and there is a difference
[2:20:35] a subject will obey because his very
[2:20:39] life
[2:20:40] and substance depends on obeying the
[2:20:44] edict of the king
[2:20:46] but a servant
[2:20:48] a real son
[2:20:50] who chooses to be a servant
[2:20:54] he doesn't worship in fear
[2:20:56] he doesn't approach god afraid he
[2:21:00] approaches god with boldness knowing
[2:21:02] that there's a more perfect sacrifice
[2:21:05] that's crying out on his behalf you
[2:21:07] stand at the bottom of the hill and
[2:21:09] worship if that's all you can do until
[2:21:11] god cleanses your hand and purifies your
[2:21:13] heart and then you do like the scripture
[2:21:16] said get up
[2:21:18] don't stand at the bottom of the hill at
[2:21:20] cades barney forever there's a promised
[2:21:23] land jaya there's a promised land
[2:21:26] jennifer there's a promised land that
[2:21:29] we're supposed to take
[2:21:31] right now right here and now
[2:21:34] we're not calling heaven the promised
[2:21:36] land we're calling inheriting the
[2:21:38] promises of god now
[2:21:40] the promised land
[2:21:42] and god wants you to have that
[2:21:44] anybody with me
[2:21:46] psalms 128
[2:21:51] blessed happy fortunate to be envied
[2:21:54] is everyone who fears reveres and
[2:21:56] worships the lord it's 1 16
[2:21:59] who walks in his ways
[2:22:01] and lives accordingly to his
[2:22:04] commandments
[2:22:05] for you shall eat i want you to hear
[2:22:08] this
[2:22:10] for you
[2:22:11] shall eat
[2:22:13] the fruit
[2:22:14] of the labor
[2:22:16] of your hands
[2:22:24] you don't work
[2:22:26] you don't eat
[2:22:30] the bible said a man who doesn't provide
[2:22:32] for his own has denied the faith and is
[2:22:34] worse than an infidel
[2:22:37] i'm just telling what the scripture said
[2:22:39] you can't say you love god and be worse
[2:22:41] than an infidel
[2:22:44] when the infidel is that one who's a
[2:22:46] fool
[2:22:47] the bible calls him so
[2:22:49] you have a responsibility
[2:22:52] come on now
[2:22:54] and you learn that you learn that you
[2:22:56] you and maybe it wasn't modeled for you
[2:22:59] but you learn it
[2:23:01] you're not looking for the handout your
[2:23:03] real desire is let me get to the place
[2:23:05] where i can give somebody
[2:23:07] let me get to the place listen that that
[2:23:10] has been my own i've never this is the
[2:23:12] truth before god may he judge me in
[2:23:15] front of all of you i have never desired
[2:23:17] to be rich to be rich
[2:23:20] the only desire that i've ever had was
[2:23:23] to carry wealth to this extent i'm not
[2:23:25] there yet
[2:23:27] but i would love to carry wealth to this
[2:23:30] extent that i could write a check to
[2:23:32] meet a need and never have to consider
[2:23:37] what it would do to my next week
[2:23:39] or my next month
[2:23:41] god let it be so for some of us
[2:23:43] let it be so you know my granny used to
[2:23:46] say that god will only give you what he
[2:23:48] can trust you with
[2:23:51] and so i have recognized in my life that
[2:23:54] god can only trust me with a certain
[2:23:55] amount of things but i'm not satisfied
[2:23:57] with that i realize that i can keep
[2:24:00] proving my integrity and
[2:24:02] demonstrating my heart to him
[2:24:05] and he may absolutely bring me to the
[2:24:07] place
[2:24:08] that i would be able to do that just
[2:24:11] write a check just hear a need and meet
[2:24:13] that need and not have to worry about a
[2:24:15] bill to be paid come on now
[2:24:18] i can't tell you what it feels like to
[2:24:20] have come as far as i have come in the
[2:24:23] last few years to be able to say
[2:24:26] sometimes not every month but to be able
[2:24:29] to say by the 15th of the month that
[2:24:32] every bill that i owe for that month is
[2:24:34] already paid for by the 15th i dance a
[2:24:37] jig
[2:24:39] i dance a jig around my desk and i say
[2:24:42] thank you lord you have brought me so
[2:24:44] far
[2:24:44] i still carry credit card debt but i'm
[2:24:47] thankful that i'm not living
[2:24:49] on credit cards
[2:24:51] i'm thankful that god has brought us
[2:24:53] little by little by little by little by
[2:24:55] little out of that and i look forward to
[2:24:57] a day it may be in the last closing
[2:24:59] moments of my life or it may perhaps
[2:25:01] never be but i would very much like to
[2:25:03] be in that place where i could find the
[2:25:06] need and just meet it
[2:25:08] just meet that need and go on as quietly
[2:25:10] as possible not not even making a big
[2:25:12] to-do let me tell you something your
[2:25:14] works will praise you
[2:25:17] you don't have to praise yourself
[2:25:19] you don't have to be arrogant you don't
[2:25:21] have to brag on who you are
[2:25:23] i lost most friends in ministry close
[2:25:26] friends in ministry because uh uh their
[2:25:29] our fellowship was always one way
[2:25:33] i used to have a host of pastors call me
[2:25:35] every sunday night
[2:25:38] even after i was first married
[2:25:40] four or five pastors would call me every
[2:25:41] sunday night asked me how their servant
[2:25:43] how my service was and before i could
[2:25:45] answer
[2:25:48] would tell me for 20 minutes what
[2:25:50] happened in their service and how god
[2:25:52] used them
[2:25:55] it's hard to keep making those phone
[2:25:57] calls
[2:25:59] because i didn't want to push for my way
[2:26:01] i didn't want to push for my opportunity
[2:26:03] to testify
[2:26:04] because i realize if god does anything
[2:26:06] today it'll be him
[2:26:09] the best thing that you and i can do for
[2:26:11] god is show up and say yes
[2:26:13] just show up and say yes
[2:26:15] if we show up and say yes he can do the
[2:26:17] rest
[2:26:20] oh thank you ezekiel did you all hear
[2:26:22] zika clapping his hands for his preacher
[2:26:25] he's helping me
[2:26:26] for you shall eat the fruit of the labor
[2:26:28] of your hands happy blessed fortunate
[2:26:31] enviable
[2:26:33] shall you be and it shall be well with
[2:26:35] you oh there's so many things i want to
[2:26:38] see in my life that are not yet evident
[2:26:41] but i can tell you that it is a
[2:26:43] wonderful feeling as you know as many of
[2:26:45] you know to know that it's well with me
[2:26:48] it's well with you can you say it's well
[2:26:50] with me
[2:26:51] can you say it and mean it because you
[2:26:53] know that the the debt is settled
[2:26:56] there's no checking up to do on the
[2:26:58] account
[2:26:59] god has taken care of it
[2:27:02] it shall be well with you your wife
[2:27:09] shall be like a fruitful vine
[2:27:12] in the innermost parts of your house
[2:27:23] not at the bank
[2:27:27] not at the grocery
[2:27:28] store not here there and everywhere
[2:27:32] just just bear with me
[2:27:34] at your house
[2:27:39] i don't believe it's wrong for
[2:27:41] sisters to have some income i don't
[2:27:43] think it's wrong
[2:27:44] or sisters don't want to bless their
[2:27:46] family i can tell you that my wife
[2:27:48] who turned a passion into a business has
[2:27:51] been a great blessing
[2:27:53] five years ago or however long three
[2:27:55] year whatever it was i'd remember now
[2:27:56] honey night 2019 was it we
[2:27:59] 2015 what's been a long time no no our
[2:28:02] our cruise
[2:28:04] 2019 my dream go to alaska on a cruise
[2:28:06] always my dream you know what now i have
[2:28:08] another dream do it
[2:28:10] again you ever do it one time you won't
[2:28:13] do it again
[2:28:14] it was the most wonderful trip my wife
[2:28:15] paid for every penny of it
[2:28:17] out of her savings saving from her from
[2:28:20] her little job the bible tells us in
[2:28:22] proverbs of the virtuous woman that a
[2:28:24] woman is resourceful that way
[2:28:28] she does things in sales and mates so
[2:28:30] i'm not against that income but i'm
[2:28:32] telling you that it's it's it's a house
[2:28:34] in order
[2:28:35] when a young mother is at home with her
[2:28:37] children
[2:28:38] you don't have to i don't care if you
[2:28:39] get mad i'll be honest with you somebody
[2:28:41] were to get mad especially uh somebody
[2:28:43] that's not a part of this if you're a
[2:28:45] part of this group you know how i feel
[2:28:47] but if you're just hearing this on the
[2:28:48] internet you get offended and you're you
[2:28:50] you think i'm i'm a chauvinist or
[2:28:51] something no no no i'm telling you the
[2:28:53] highest honor
[2:28:54] that anybody could have as a woman would
[2:28:56] be the blessing that god would make a
[2:28:59] way for her to be home with her children
[2:29:02] to keep her home
[2:29:04] and to pour her life into her children
[2:29:06] that woman should be honored that woman
[2:29:08] should be highly praised
[2:29:11] and i'm so thankful that when god gave
[2:29:12] me a wife nearly 25 years ago he gave me
[2:29:16] a wife who said two things in her life i
[2:29:18] never want to be a preacher's wife and i
[2:29:19] never want to be a school teacher and
[2:29:21] she ended up being both she ended up
[2:29:23] being a pastor's wife and she ended up
[2:29:25] teaching our kids in school home school
[2:29:28] she only has one more to go mariah is
[2:29:31] the last one and when she's done
[2:29:34] well then we start on the grandchildren
[2:29:36] i guess i don't know
[2:29:39] we were going to have five if god would
[2:29:41] let us
[2:29:42] we were going to have five if god would
[2:29:44] let us but we
[2:29:45] she said to me one day honey if you
[2:29:46] really want to have five we will
[2:29:48] certainly try and put it in god's hands
[2:29:50] we almost did we came so close to just
[2:29:53] letting it be
[2:29:55] but we were getting older already
[2:29:58] it was nearly 30 when we married and she
[2:30:01] was just a few years behind us and
[2:30:03] we had benjamin right away nine months
[2:30:05] later
[2:30:07] and uh
[2:30:08] they were kind of close and
[2:30:10] along the way
[2:30:12] she said i i've been adding it up and
[2:30:14] if we have one now do you realize i'll
[2:30:16] be middle 60s
[2:30:18] nearly late 60s
[2:30:20] when when the last one graduates
[2:30:23] she said i just don't know if i have the
[2:30:24] patience
[2:30:26] for such as that
[2:30:28] we've just put it in god's hands is what
[2:30:30] we did we just totally put it in god's
[2:30:32] hands
[2:30:32] and it didn't happen but i thank god
[2:30:37] for a woman who was willing to do that i
[2:30:39] thank god
[2:30:41] for every sister in this church
[2:30:43] though you didn't want to do it you have
[2:30:45] dedicated your lives to educating your
[2:30:49] children at home and keeping them out
[2:30:51] from under the influence of this world
[2:30:54] and this secular education system and an
[2:30:57] hour when even the churches the
[2:30:59] christian schools are not so much better
[2:31:02] than the public school system
[2:31:05] because you've got same teachers same
[2:31:07] family same situations going on now
[2:31:09] it's a catch-all it really always was i
[2:31:12] ran a christian school in south carolina
[2:31:14] and i found myself feeling more like a
[2:31:16] truancy officer than the headmaster of a
[2:31:19] school because the calls that we got on
[2:31:21] a daily basis were from parents whose
[2:31:23] kids had been expelled
[2:31:28] and they wanted to fill up our school
[2:31:30] with children that had been expelled and
[2:31:32] i made a few exceptions and there's a
[2:31:34] there's a woman who comments on our
[2:31:37] stuff on facebook sometime who has
[2:31:39] thanked me again recently
[2:31:42] she said my son was one of those and you
[2:31:45] took a chance on him and he lives a good
[2:31:48] life with a good family today because
[2:31:50] you are willing to help him but there's
[2:31:52] no way in the world i could have done
[2:31:53] all of them i couldn't have taken them
[2:31:55] all in it would have overrun the
[2:31:56] atmosphere of our school and changed
[2:31:59] everything that we were doing thank god
[2:32:01] for the sacrifice that you mothers have
[2:32:03] make that's why these daddies sometimes
[2:32:05] have to work two jobs that's why these
[2:32:07] daddies sometimes have to moonlight is
[2:32:08] that what they call it and work extra
[2:32:10] hours and sell things
[2:32:13] and not have some things because they
[2:32:16] have to bear that responsibility and
[2:32:18] expense
[2:32:19] and in our nation homeschooling is very
[2:32:22] very expensive and they don't give us a
[2:32:25] deduction on taxes
[2:32:27] so we pay for other kids
[2:32:29] other parents kids to be educated in the
[2:32:31] public system and then we have to turn
[2:32:33] around and pay for our own but oh if
[2:32:35] that sounds like a complaint it is not a
[2:32:39] complaint i thank god that he's given us
[2:32:42] the blessing
[2:32:45] when i went to lewisville texas i don't
[2:32:47] know why i'm saying this when i went to
[2:32:49] lewisville texas to train at accelerated
[2:32:51] christian education dr lewis
[2:32:54] welcomed me i went for a conference
[2:32:56] three days before the school started
[2:32:58] and he's passed away now but he shook my
[2:33:01] hand and he said god sent you here
[2:33:04] baptist independent baptist
[2:33:06] and he said i want to talk to you
[2:33:08] privately for just a few minutes i never
[2:33:09] expected this kind of treatment
[2:33:11] and he said i want to ask you a question
[2:33:14] he said when god called those children
[2:33:16] of israel out of egypt and got them out
[2:33:18] there in the wilderness and they longed
[2:33:21] for the garlic and they longed for the
[2:33:23] cucumber and the leeks they longed to be
[2:33:26] back and have the food of egypt
[2:33:28] he said but one thing god was clear
[2:33:30] about
[2:33:31] he said you teach your children these
[2:33:34] commandments bind them like frontlets on
[2:33:37] your eyes
[2:33:38] come on now
[2:33:40] you teach your children and your
[2:33:42] children's children these commandments
[2:33:44] he said aren't you don't you see how
[2:33:46] things would have been different if they
[2:33:48] would have gotten their kids up every
[2:33:50] morning
[2:33:53] placed them on a school bus
[2:33:55] and sent them back down to egypt to be
[2:33:57] trained
[2:34:01] what a struggle
[2:34:03] those kids would have had trying to
[2:34:04] maintain the commandments of yahweh
[2:34:08] in the influence of that old world let
[2:34:10] me tell you something you'll you won't
[2:34:12] change my mind
[2:34:14] i want to thank god and when i honor the
[2:34:16] women for making the sacrifice i wonder
[2:34:18] i want the men to know they couldn't do
[2:34:19] it without you
[2:34:21] you should be praised here today you
[2:34:22] should be thanked and you should be
[2:34:24] celebrated and your kids may grumble and
[2:34:27] complain at times about it but one day
[2:34:28] they'll thank you one day they will
[2:34:31] thank you that they didn't have to be in
[2:34:32] that atmosphere anybody with me well
[2:34:34] i've got a real smart kid well i've got
[2:34:36] a real exceptional kid then you go to
[2:34:38] pray and you ask god to give you what
[2:34:40] you need to do what you need to do for
[2:34:41] them let the saints say amen
[2:34:44] okay go on your wife shall be a fruitful
[2:34:46] vine in the innermost parts of your
[2:34:48] house your children shall be like olive
[2:34:50] plants round about your table
[2:34:52] well i'm in israel
[2:34:54] and i have one of the greatest gods in
[2:34:56] all the world excuse me benny if you're
[2:34:58] watching you weren't guiding then
[2:35:02] but miriam fine v feinberg vamosh
[2:35:05] a friend of ours who lives in haradar
[2:35:08] just just up the hill from kyrie arim
[2:35:13] she guided us on our first journey
[2:35:15] through the land
[2:35:16] she's well known she's written all kinds
[2:35:18] of amazing books including a book about
[2:35:21] the foods of the bible and the times of
[2:35:22] jesus that's absolutely amazing and she
[2:35:25] has written a lot of the commentary for
[2:35:27] the brochures
[2:35:29] of of the of the tourism the national
[2:35:32] tourism board and you go to a biblical
[2:35:33] site she has written a lot of those
[2:35:35] brochures and she said come here pastor
[2:35:38] i think i had three children at the time
[2:35:41] and she said come here pastor i want to
[2:35:42] show you the scriptures in in in live i
[2:35:46] want you to see them alive and she took
[2:35:48] me to an olive tree and she said this
[2:35:51] olive tree it could be hundreds of years
[2:35:53] old we don't know how old it is but you
[2:35:54] can tell by the strength of the trunk
[2:35:57] and the
[2:35:58] the age of the tree but she said i want
[2:35:59] you to look at all these little tinder
[2:36:00] shoots
[2:36:01] and all the way around that old olive
[2:36:05] tree were these little tender shoots
[2:36:07] about this tall all the way around it
[2:36:09] and she said this is what olive trees do
[2:36:11] they branch out these these little and
[2:36:13] she said that's what the scripture is
[2:36:15] describing when it talks to you about
[2:36:17] being a fruitful vine and your children
[2:36:19] be being like little olive plants around
[2:36:22] your table it comes from the from the
[2:36:24] true uh behavior of the olive tree and
[2:36:28] i've never forgotten that behold thus
[2:36:30] shall the man be blessed who reverently
[2:36:36] reverently
[2:36:40] and worshipfully
[2:36:42] fears the lord
[2:36:44] may the lord bless you out of zion
[2:36:48] his sanctuary and may you see the
[2:36:50] prosperity of jerusalem all the days of
[2:36:53] your life yes may you see your
[2:36:56] children's children yes lord
[2:37:01] please lord
[2:37:03] peace
[2:37:04] be upon israel
[2:37:06] god said i want to bless these righteous
[2:37:09] upright men and i want them to have a
[2:37:12] good spread of children
[2:37:15] not 1.5
[2:37:20] but as many as they can afford to take
[2:37:22] care of
[2:37:25] there's no scripture in the bible that
[2:37:27] tells you to keep having them so the
[2:37:29] government can take care of them
[2:37:32] excuse me amen brother you got to say
[2:37:35] the tough stuff too
[2:37:37] but you have as many as you can afford
[2:37:40] to have and raise them all up to serve
[2:37:42] the lord because one of these days the
[2:37:44] last gentile part of the predestinated
[2:37:47] seed of god is going to be expressed in
[2:37:49] the earth
[2:37:52] if it hadn't already come it's coming
[2:37:54] you be obedient to the lord in that
[2:37:56] manner don't you let this society shame
[2:37:59] you
[2:38:04] you stand up for yourself megan
[2:38:06] jovich
[2:38:09] when you get down to walmart with your
[2:38:10] baseball team
[2:38:13] they don't want to treat you right you
[2:38:14] stand up for yourself
[2:38:16] i hear you do
[2:38:20] can you imagine pulling up with a buggy
[2:38:22] your kids with you i assume they were
[2:38:24] with you some of them anyway
[2:38:26] all of them were worthy you pull up
[2:38:28] to pay for your groceries and can you
[2:38:30] imagine the clerk telling you i'm not
[2:38:32] going to check you out
[2:38:34] because you're not elderly
[2:38:36] or what
[2:38:38] disabled or elderly i'm not going to
[2:38:40] check you out you go over there to the
[2:38:42] self-checkout
[2:38:44] she finds it very very hard
[2:38:47] as anybody would i find it hard to check
[2:38:49] out on self-checkout
[2:38:51] because the thing yells at me all the
[2:38:53] time
[2:38:56] your item back pick your item up put
[2:38:58] your item over there don't it
[2:39:00] i don't know how many times i've ever
[2:39:02] got in and got out well i don't go to
[2:39:04] walmart
[2:39:05] but home depot or anywhere else i don't
[2:39:07] know how many times i've ever got in and
[2:39:08] got out without having to have a clerk
[2:39:11] very few
[2:39:12] they all have to come help me so they
[2:39:14] see me coming i think and just stand
[2:39:16] there ready to help me but can you
[2:39:18] imagine them telling you something like
[2:39:20] that you're not disabled and you're not
[2:39:21] elderly you're able to go over there
[2:39:23] like that
[2:39:27] sisters have told me for years when they
[2:39:29] go in two or three children that
[2:39:30] sometimes people look at them and say
[2:39:32] even three children are all those
[2:39:34] children yours
[2:39:36] do you see what society does
[2:39:39] they want to dictate everybody's life
[2:39:42] but the children of god are not like the
[2:39:45] rest of the citizens of this world we've
[2:39:47] marched to another drumbeat all together
[2:39:51] we're hearing the commandments of our
[2:39:53] father and desiring to live by those
[2:39:55] commandments
[2:39:57] hallelujah if you have one god bless
[2:39:59] that one if you have a dozen god bless
[2:40:01] that dozen but raise every one of them
[2:40:03] to fear the lord
[2:40:06] and make sure you can handle helping
[2:40:08] mold them into citizens
[2:40:10] of the kingdom of god and good citizens
[2:40:13] on planet earth
[2:40:14] or stop with two
[2:40:17] behold
[2:40:19] that man shall be blessed yes may you
[2:40:21] see your children's children peace be
[2:40:22] upon israel now i'm going to hurry
[2:40:24] because we got to go here
[2:40:27] i really was going to preach in my
[2:40:28] regular
[2:40:29] sermon material but i didn't get there
[2:40:31] yet
[2:40:32] first corinthians 4 14 through 17 is
[2:40:34] everybody okay
[2:40:35] anybody mad
[2:40:38] would you say it if you were
[2:40:43] we'll get the oil out
[2:40:45] first corinthians 4
[2:40:47] 14-17
[2:40:49] amplified
[2:40:51] i do not write this to shame you
[2:40:55] but to warn and counsel you as my
[2:40:57] beloved children
[2:40:59] after although you should have
[2:41:01] thousand teachers
[2:41:03] guides to direct you in christ
[2:41:06] yet you do
[2:41:08] not have many fathers
[2:41:13] this is the condition of the world
[2:41:15] around us
[2:41:17] and this is the condition of the church
[2:41:19] world
[2:41:20] many teachers
[2:41:22] so many willing to teach you something
[2:41:24] they don't know
[2:41:27] but very few who are willing to be a
[2:41:31] father to the saints
[2:41:34] we need god to raise up
[2:41:37] men even among us who are not will who
[2:41:40] are willing to be more than a teacher by
[2:41:44] example but also a father
[2:41:49] to those who need a spiritual
[2:41:51] father
[2:41:53] i don't believe in looking to the pastor
[2:41:55] or leaders in the church as your natural
[2:41:57] father just because you don't have a
[2:41:59] relationship with your natural father
[2:42:01] i'm not encouraging you to do that
[2:42:04] especially sisters single sisters
[2:42:06] sometimes get that kind of thing in
[2:42:08] their mind and they're looking for a
[2:42:10] father figure i can't replace an earthly
[2:42:13] father whether you had one or not but i
[2:42:16] want to be a spiritual father to you
[2:42:19] i want to tell you the truth and more
[2:42:21] importantly than telling you the truth i
[2:42:23] want to live the truth in front of you
[2:42:26] because you will be an impression
[2:42:30] you will model what you see and what you
[2:42:33] hear
[2:42:34] we carry it on may god give us more
[2:42:37] fathers
[2:42:38] he said you you've got 10 000 teachers
[2:42:41] in christ yet you do not have many
[2:42:43] fathers for i became your father in
[2:42:45] christ jesus through the glad tidings of
[2:42:48] the gospel so i urge you
[2:42:52] i urge and implore you
[2:42:55] to be imitators of me
[2:42:59] what
[2:43:05] i'm not going to follow any man
[2:43:08] you do already
[2:43:11] everybody in this room is following a
[2:43:13] man
[2:43:14] one way or another
[2:43:17] there's always going to be somebody that
[2:43:19] has authority over your life whether
[2:43:21] it's your boss
[2:43:23] or your earthly dad
[2:43:24] or your spiritual leaders
[2:43:28] so it's just erroneous to say i'm not
[2:43:30] going to follow any man we do follow men
[2:43:32] we just have to follow the right man
[2:43:35] and that would be first and foremost the
[2:43:36] lord jesus christ and his word and those
[2:43:39] that he raises up before us
[2:43:42] may god make you if you're not sure may
[2:43:44] god help you to be sure
[2:43:46] if you're not sure who your pastor is
[2:43:48] you may god help you to be sure
[2:43:51] and i'll tell you like i've told people
[2:43:53] recently you don't have to go here
[2:43:59] you go where god sends you
[2:44:02] he's not going to send you anywhere
[2:44:04] where less of the gospel is being
[2:44:06] preached
[2:44:07] amen if he sends you somewhere he's
[2:44:09] going to send you where more of the
[2:44:11] gospel is being preached and modeled
[2:44:13] you're not going back into the
[2:44:15] denominational vomit that you came out
[2:44:17] of somebody ought to say man
[2:44:19] you're surely not going back into
[2:44:20] man-made systems but the first thing
[2:44:23] that god had to teach me in my early
[2:44:25] ministry was a hard lesson that i still
[2:44:28] struggle with today
[2:44:31] and that is i can't help everybody
[2:44:37] but god can
[2:44:39] and he's got a man somewhere that can
[2:44:41] help anybody that needs help pride
[2:44:46] this little lady back here and she may
[2:44:48] have known me longer than anybody in
[2:44:49] this room
[2:44:52] she stood
[2:44:54] on the street
[2:44:56] in downtown columbus
[2:44:58] with a son and a stepson i think i may
[2:45:00] be wrong is that right
[2:45:01] when i was preaching on the street at 17
[2:45:04] years old she was in the crowd
[2:45:08] i've made
[2:45:09] hundreds of mistakes
[2:45:12] and thousands of mistakes but what we do
[2:45:14] is we just keep going on the best we can
[2:45:17] for christ
[2:45:20] and we follow christ first
[2:45:23] and we get a revelation of who's
[2:45:25] supposed to help us on the journey and
[2:45:28] then we get behind that with everything
[2:45:29] we've got didn't you hear brother
[2:45:31] branham say that you need a revelation
[2:45:33] of who your pastor is then you stick
[2:45:35] with him
[2:45:36] because he's ordained to take you over
[2:45:38] this pastoral thing is a serious thing
[2:45:40] when you call somebody your pastor it's
[2:45:42] not just a term of endearment it's a
[2:45:44] spiritual responsibility and a spiritual
[2:45:47] relationship that you're forming with
[2:45:48] that person and we need some spiritual
[2:45:51] fathers and not just one pastor but we
[2:45:53] need you you know you've got a spiritual
[2:45:55] father in brother greeley
[2:45:57] he's there to help you if you need to be
[2:45:59] helped
[2:46:01] now i want to put some statistics up if
[2:46:03] you happen to catch those you might not
[2:46:04] have i want to get these out of the way
[2:46:08] i'm running close to my time
[2:46:12] 63 percent
[2:46:14] of youth suicides are from fatherless
[2:46:16] homes
[2:46:22] a less than good dad
[2:46:27] in home
[2:46:29] is better than no dad
[2:46:31] i didn't say an abusive dad
[2:46:35] i didn't say an abusive dad i didn't say
[2:46:38] a dad who takes his anger out on his
[2:46:40] wife and children
[2:46:42] but a dad who knows he's not perfect
[2:46:45] is better than a dad
[2:46:46] a home where there is no dad
[2:46:50] so it's easy sometime to get rid of the
[2:46:52] dad
[2:46:54] not realizing the penalty and the impact
[2:46:56] that it has
[2:46:58] on the family
[2:47:00] and we're also living in a society where
[2:47:02] there are men who are who are uh you
[2:47:05] know searing babies uh uh spawning
[2:47:08] babies
[2:47:09] but have no responsibility to those
[2:47:11] babies and if it wasn't for what they're
[2:47:13] calling now somebody's baby mama
[2:47:17] which is usually a grandmother
[2:47:20] because even the baby mama who brings
[2:47:22] them into the world is not present to be
[2:47:25] able to raise them so in many many many
[2:47:27] cases it falls on an older generation
[2:47:30] to take care of the children thank god
[2:47:33] for the grandmas
[2:47:36] but it shouldn't have to be such a way
[2:47:38] as that
[2:47:39] but that's the hour that we're living in
[2:47:41] 85
[2:47:43] of children that exhibit behavioral
[2:47:46] disorders are from fatherless homes
[2:47:49] 85
[2:47:52] 80
[2:47:53] of convicted rapists
[2:47:55] have grown up
[2:47:56] in fatherless homes 80
[2:48:01] 71
[2:48:02] of teenage school dropouts
[2:48:05] are from fatherless homes
[2:48:07] you tell me a father doesn't matter
[2:48:12] 75 percent of all youth and drug abuse
[2:48:14] sinners
[2:48:15] are from fatherless homes
[2:48:17] 70 percent of juveniles and state
[2:48:19] institutions
[2:48:21] come from fatherless homes
[2:48:23] 85 percent of youngsters in prison
[2:48:26] are from fatherless homes
[2:48:28] 70 of teen pregnancies
[2:48:31] are from fatherless homes
[2:48:34] isn't that
[2:48:35] hard to get your
[2:48:37] brain around
[2:48:39] so when we take a little extra time
[2:48:42] to honor a father
[2:48:45] it's not to say he's perfect
[2:48:48] it's not to say that he's without fault
[2:48:50] or mistake
[2:48:51] but it's to say if he chooses to stay
[2:48:59] your children are going to end up in a
[2:49:00] better situation
[2:49:02] with the father present than one absent
[2:49:05] anybody with me
[2:49:07] now brothers i want to tell you there
[2:49:09] are three common mistakes
[2:49:11] that we need to avoid
[2:49:13] if we want to be an example
[2:49:15] worth following there are many there are
[2:49:17] many
[2:49:18] but i want to give you these this
[2:49:20] morning a don't cover up your mistakes
[2:49:24] don't let your pride keep you from
[2:49:27] apologizing to your wife and children
[2:49:30] anybody with me on that men
[2:49:34] i don't i may be the only one being
[2:49:36] but i have had to backpedal
[2:49:39] i've had to set my family down and say i
[2:49:42] was
[2:49:43] wrong
[2:49:45] i didn't handle that right
[2:49:48] i wasn't looking at that right
[2:49:50] i have made a mistake
[2:49:53] or raise my voice when when the
[2:49:55] situation really didn't merit the
[2:49:58] exercise of that kind of volume
[2:50:01] i am not one who says that because a man
[2:50:04] raises his voice or a woman mother
[2:50:06] raises her voice that she's not a fit
[2:50:07] parent i don't say that at all i
[2:50:10] absolutely believe that there are
[2:50:12] situations and circumstances where it is
[2:50:14] vitally urgent and important to get
[2:50:17] someone's attention now
[2:50:22] so it will happen
[2:50:24] but there have been times that the
[2:50:26] situation did not merit that kind of
[2:50:29] outburst
[2:50:30] and i've had to set my children down and
[2:50:32] say i
[2:50:34] was wrong
[2:50:37] i am sorry
[2:50:39] i don't want to cover up my mistakes if
[2:50:41] you make a blunder in front of your
[2:50:43] children don't pretend like you didn't
[2:50:48] you say well they may not be old enough
[2:50:49] to understand it are you teaching them
[2:50:51] to say they're sorry when they do
[2:50:53] something that they shouldn't do or is
[2:50:56] that a part of your family it should be
[2:51:03] and it shouldn't just be as they get
[2:51:05] older i hope you're listening it
[2:51:07] shouldn't just be i'm sorry it should be
[2:51:09] why are you sorry
[2:51:11] what are you sorry for did you know a
[2:51:13] lot of times children get rebuked
[2:51:16] and disciplined for something and
[2:51:17] they're not totally aware of what
[2:51:20] they're being disciplined for that's not
[2:51:22] teaching
[2:51:23] that's not training
[2:51:25] they can get that from their boss
[2:51:27] they can get that from society but when
[2:51:30] daddy corrects them they need to be
[2:51:32] clear
[2:51:34] on why they're being corrected
[2:51:36] oh but that takes so long it does
[2:51:39] so you better factor that in
[2:51:42] when you're filling your quiver
[2:51:46] you want to factor that in
[2:51:49] especially if you're going to use
[2:51:50] physical correction
[2:51:53] that child needs to understand why you
[2:51:56] chose that for a punishment
[2:52:00] and let me remind you that public is not
[2:52:02] the place
[2:52:04] to execute that kind of discipline on
[2:52:06] your children
[2:52:09] or you'll be calling me
[2:52:11] from lockup
[2:52:13] there's a world out there that
[2:52:15] absolutely believes that it's okay for
[2:52:17] pedophiles to raise children
[2:52:20] but how dare you as a godly family swat
[2:52:23] yours on the rear end
[2:52:26] and let me remind you parents that god
[2:52:28] designed the body with a perfect spot
[2:52:37] he put extra pattern
[2:52:39] that's not their arm that's not their
[2:52:42] shoulder that's not their head that's
[2:52:45] not their face
[2:52:47] it's posterior pole to protoplasm
[2:52:51] it's putting it on the cushion
[2:52:55] doing it because you want to express the
[2:52:59] severity of a of a problem
[2:53:02] of a behavior
[2:53:04] not out of anger
[2:53:06] not out of anger
[2:53:09] real positive correction whether it's
[2:53:11] physical or not it doesn't come out of
[2:53:13] anger it has to come out of urgency and
[2:53:16] passion for the situation
[2:53:19] we've got to correct this now
[2:53:21] but we've got to do it calmly is
[2:53:23] everybody with me
[2:53:24] very very important don't snatch them
[2:53:32] they're not dogs with leashes
[2:53:36] they've got feelings
[2:53:38] real complicated feelings
[2:53:41] they don't have to be jerked and
[2:53:43] snatched
[2:53:45] to be disciplined
[2:53:46] will it happen yes
[2:53:50] will you grab them yes at times you will
[2:53:52] don't you look at me like that
[2:53:54] you will
[2:53:55] you say stand right here and i mean you
[2:53:57] better not leave
[2:54:00] will you grab an arm and pull it right
[2:54:02] back you certainly will but don't let
[2:54:04] that become your habit
[2:54:07] let me tell you something the goal in in
[2:54:10] training our children is to train them
[2:54:11] with our eye
[2:54:16] everybody with me
[2:54:17] just like him
[2:54:19] we want to come to a place with our
[2:54:20] small children that we train them with
[2:54:23] our eye
[2:54:26] and they know by the look
[2:54:31] and if that don't work mama's pinch
[2:54:37] i always told my mother mine's hanging
[2:54:38] down way before it should
[2:54:41] because of all them times you grabbed
[2:54:44] and mama didn't just do that oh no that
[2:54:46] would have been too easy she just kept
[2:54:48] on twisting
[2:54:53] till i was twisted in ways that i didn't
[2:54:55] know if i could untwist or not
[2:54:58] but she got my attention
[2:55:01] and i told you there was that one time
[2:55:04] when i saw a little little bruise that i
[2:55:07] was going to call the law
[2:55:09] only one time you all that knew my mom
[2:55:12] and you know
[2:55:13] she'd do it now she if she had the mind
[2:55:16] to do it she'd do it now if she wanted
[2:55:17] to
[2:55:20] she said well you just go right ahead
[2:55:21] let me get the phone
[2:55:24] because there's one thing for sure
[2:55:27] by the time it takes them to get here
[2:55:29] you will have had a reason to call them
[2:55:35] believe i changed my mind
[2:55:38] believe i won't call after all mom you
[2:55:40] convinced me
[2:55:43] don't cover up your mistakes brothers be
[2:55:46] real in front of your children i messed
[2:55:50] up
[2:55:51] i
[2:55:52] overreact did you know i overreacted
[2:55:55] doesn't mean that you are
[2:55:57] saying that what you said or did was
[2:56:00] wrong it means the way you handled the
[2:56:02] situation was wrong did you know you can
[2:56:04] be right in your motive to correct but
[2:56:08] wrong in your demonstration of that
[2:56:11] correction so sometimes you're not
[2:56:13] apologizing because you got corrected
[2:56:15] you needed it
[2:56:17] but i was not proper it was not right
[2:56:19] the way i don't cover don't cover up
[2:56:21] your mistakes
[2:56:26] b don't criticize others while the
[2:56:28] children are watching
[2:56:32] there's always something you can say
[2:56:33] about everybody
[2:56:36] right
[2:56:39] sometimes they deserve it even
[2:56:44] but your children should not be forced
[2:56:48] to deal with adult situations
[2:56:50] that they may not have the full brain
[2:56:52] processing power to be able to sort it
[2:56:55] out
[2:56:58] it reminds me of the story of brother
[2:57:00] branham
[2:57:02] when he was riding along there with
[2:57:03] brother greene and they were passing
[2:57:05] verde valley and
[2:57:07] and he began to speak about the
[2:57:09] what it what had been going on with the
[2:57:11] two tape brothers the two tape boys
[2:57:14] and brother branham was being quite
[2:57:16] critical
[2:57:17] because sometimes in leadership of
[2:57:19] ministry things have to be spoken quite
[2:57:22] clearly
[2:57:24] anybody understand what i mean
[2:57:26] brother greene brother branham knew
[2:57:28] exactly why he was sharing the
[2:57:29] seriousness of
[2:57:32] of these situations with brother green
[2:57:34] but it got a little overboard for
[2:57:35] brother green's comfort zone
[2:57:38] because he had always heard that brother
[2:57:40] branham never said a negative word about
[2:57:42] anybody
[2:57:43] which would be a gross exaggeration for
[2:57:45] most people on the planet
[2:57:49] yet you hear people say that but anyway
[2:57:51] but this was brother
[2:57:53] uh green's impression brother branham
[2:57:54] and brother branham is kind of getting a
[2:57:56] little
[2:57:57] coarse here and he's just really laying
[2:57:59] it on thick
[2:58:02] and brother green is just listing real
[2:58:04] careful not to say too much and
[2:58:06] they go on and do what they're going to
[2:58:08] do and they're coming back through the
[2:58:09] same area
[2:58:10] and they're getting back stopped at the
[2:58:12] same little gas stop and they're getting
[2:58:13] back in the car to finish the drive on
[2:58:16] down to tucson and ah brother green
[2:58:19] brother branham looks at us watching he
[2:58:20] said oh brother perry if we had a little
[2:58:22] more time we'd go over and see the boys
[2:58:28] brother green said i i just couldn't i
[2:58:30] just couldn't let that pass he said
[2:58:31] brother brandon what do you mean
[2:58:34] when we were passing through here on the
[2:58:36] way up you told me about all the sins
[2:58:38] and all the messes that those brothers
[2:58:40] were making
[2:58:41] and how they had done it all wrong and
[2:58:43] how it had brought reproach even on your
[2:58:45] ministry and what needed to be done to
[2:58:47] kind of straighten that out and now
[2:58:49] you're saying if we had time we'd go by
[2:58:51] and see the boys
[2:58:55] and he said i just don't understand that
[2:58:56] brother branham and brother branham said
[2:58:58] brother perry i'm surprised at you
[2:59:05] brother greene said this to me multiple
[2:59:07] times
[2:59:08] he said
[2:59:09] the nerve of him
[2:59:12] he said that's how i felt
[2:59:14] the nerve of him me i'm surprised that
[2:59:17] you
[2:59:19] you're the one that
[2:59:20] had so much to say about him
[2:59:22] and i'm the problem
[2:59:26] he said why they're still our brothers
[2:59:35] there may be something necessary
[2:59:39] there may be something true there may be
[2:59:42] some reason at times why something
[2:59:46] should be said to our children
[2:59:52] because we don't want to leave them
[2:59:54] clueless
[2:59:56] in a situation that they may have to
[2:59:58] face
[3:00:01] sometimes a family leaves the church
[3:00:03] we're afraid to tell our children they
[3:00:05] really ought to know
[3:00:09] you don't have to go into all the
[3:00:10] details but you might ought to let them
[3:00:13] know
[3:00:15] so they don't wonder
[3:00:18] but in most situations
[3:00:21] you should be very careful put the list
[3:00:23] up for me again would you
[3:00:25] you should be very careful that you're
[3:00:27] not criticizing other people
[3:00:30] while the children are watching and most
[3:00:32] importantly listening
[3:00:35] which means mom and daddy have to talk
[3:00:38] when they are so exhausted
[3:00:40] they can hardly stand up
[3:00:43] because that's way after the day is over
[3:00:45] and the children are in bed
[3:00:46] and you're both ready to sleep
[3:00:49] but there are things that need to be
[3:00:50] said in that kind of a private situation
[3:00:53] if you understand what i'm saying you
[3:00:54] can say amen
[3:00:55] and the last one see don't maintain a
[3:00:58] fake front be
[3:01:01] yourself
[3:01:03] fathers
[3:01:04] daddies men of integrity
[3:01:06] be yourself don't be a phony
[3:01:10] don't be somebody you're not
[3:01:13] don't get off a podcast and think you've
[3:01:15] got to be like somebody else
[3:01:18] you be who god has created you to be who
[3:01:21] god has built you to be who god has made
[3:01:23] you to be and be honest about that
[3:01:26] and don't don't deceive your children
[3:01:29] into thinking and whatever you do don't
[3:01:31] be one person at church
[3:01:35] and another person at home
[3:01:38] do i have just a few more minutes if you
[3:01:40] need to slip out you can
[3:01:42] i want you to go to job 1 5 i don't know
[3:01:44] what i was thinking that i would ever
[3:01:45] get back to my sermon
[3:01:49] and it was so
[3:01:51] when the days of their feasting were
[3:01:53] gone about that job sent and sanctified
[3:01:56] them
[3:01:57] and rose up early in the morning and
[3:01:59] offered burnt offerings according to the
[3:02:01] number of them all he's speaking about
[3:02:03] his children
[3:02:05] so this is job rising up early in the
[3:02:08] morning
[3:02:10] sanctifying his children
[3:02:13] now how does the father sanctify his
[3:02:16] family
[3:02:17] by bringing them apart in prayer by
[3:02:19] laying them on the altar before the lord
[3:02:23] setting them apart unto the lord and
[3:02:26] praying over them and the bible said
[3:02:28] that job even offered burnt offerings
[3:02:32] according to the number of his children
[3:02:35] so he not only sanctified them in prayer
[3:02:39] after they had been on this feast
[3:02:42] they lived in pagan land
[3:02:45] and they were influenced by the pagan
[3:02:47] feast
[3:02:49] and job wanted them to know that you may
[3:02:52] be living in the world but you shouldn't
[3:02:54] be a part of the world
[3:02:56] and so he went to god the day after it
[3:02:58] was over and he sanctified his children
[3:03:01] in prayer and he laid them on the altar
[3:03:03] before god and then for each of them he
[3:03:06] made a burnt offering unto the lord this
[3:03:08] is this is serious work
[3:03:12] he offered a special offering unto the
[3:03:14] lord for every one of his children for
[3:03:17] job said it may be that my sons have
[3:03:20] sinned and cursed god in their hearts
[3:03:25] why because of their participation in
[3:03:27] this pagan feasting that was going on in
[3:03:30] their neighbor in their land in their in
[3:03:32] their region it may be
[3:03:34] that my children have sinned and cursed
[3:03:37] god in their hearts and i want you to
[3:03:39] notice how dedicated job was to crying
[3:03:41] out to god for his children i hope
[3:03:43] you'll hear this brothers
[3:03:46] you can't leave all the praying to mama
[3:03:49] [Music]
[3:03:51] you can't leave all the teaching to mama
[3:03:53] i hope every one of you will recognize
[3:03:55] your responsibility to lay your children
[3:03:59] on the altar every single day i don't
[3:04:01] care if they've got children of their
[3:04:03] own
[3:04:05] they may even have grandchildren of
[3:04:07] their own god gave them to you for a
[3:04:10] reason and he wants you to be able to
[3:04:12] take that opportunity to go before god
[3:04:15] on their behalf i do i have to
[3:04:18] because i've learned like you've learned
[3:04:20] there's no limit to what can happen in a
[3:04:23] 24-hour period
[3:04:25] i can't afford to let days go by that
[3:04:28] i'm not laying my children on the altar
[3:04:30] before the lord
[3:04:31] and if it is in such a circumstance that
[3:04:34] you cannot teach your children and you
[3:04:36] have to send them out of the home to be
[3:04:39] educated don't you dare do it without
[3:04:41] anointing their head with oil and
[3:04:44] praying over their life that god will
[3:04:46] keep them and protect them and watch
[3:04:50] over them lest they fall victim to the
[3:04:54] influence of the society around them and
[3:04:56] job took it so serious he did it over
[3:04:58] and over and over again
[3:04:59] are you with me i know it's late
[3:05:02] job was aware of the potential impact
[3:05:04] the society around him was having on his
[3:05:06] children job knew that his children
[3:05:08] needed a priestly intercessor and job
[3:05:11] knew that it wasn't just the pastor's
[3:05:12] place
[3:05:16] job knew that as a father he had a
[3:05:18] responsibility to cry out to god jehovah
[3:05:21] for his own children
[3:05:23] we're living in a far worse condition
[3:05:25] today than the condition of life in
[3:05:27] job's day can anybody say man and if
[3:05:30] there was a fear of society having an
[3:05:32] influence on his children then how much
[3:05:34] more should we be concerned about
[3:05:36] society around us having an influence on
[3:05:39] our thank god i want to thank god for
[3:05:41] men in this house i want to thank god
[3:05:43] for daddies in this house that aren't
[3:05:45] afraid to bow their knee before the lord
[3:05:47] and call their wife's name before god
[3:05:50] and their children's name before the
[3:05:52] lord you're the man of integrity
[3:05:55] you're the hero
[3:05:58] not some crazy basketball player
[3:06:02] some a hollywood star
[3:06:05] some hero out there in the world who's
[3:06:07] done something good or hit a home run or
[3:06:11] kicked a field goal or or touchdown or
[3:06:14] whatever they do let me tell you
[3:06:15] something these are men
[3:06:18] fallen men unless they know jesus as
[3:06:20] their savior but if you've got a daddy
[3:06:21] that's calling your name before the lord
[3:06:24] if you've got a daddy like some of them
[3:06:25] in this house that are praying with
[3:06:27] their little girls or their little
[3:06:28] children before they go to bed at night
[3:06:30] they're having a prayer with them if
[3:06:32] you've got a daddy like that you've got
[3:06:33] something to be thankful for well come
[3:06:36] on now
[3:06:37] we we ought to celebrate
[3:06:40] so it's a it's it's a it's a must
[3:06:43] that every father in this place
[3:06:46] not only be celebrated for doing so but
[3:06:48] be called to accountability
[3:06:50] to be the priest in our own houses
[3:06:54] and they're out from under our roof
[3:06:56] all we can do is what job did
[3:06:59] we go and sanctify them before the lord
[3:07:02] we lay an offering before god on their
[3:07:04] behalf
[3:07:05] but when they're out from under our roof
[3:07:06] and authority
[3:07:11] benjamin said dad i i know better than
[3:07:14] to think that because i live up the hill
[3:07:15] you're still not going to tell me what
[3:07:16] ought to do
[3:07:18] i said you're right
[3:07:20] i'm still going to be there to be a
[3:07:22] voice in your life the longest day you
[3:07:25] live on planet earth or the longest day
[3:07:27] i live on planet earth i'm still going
[3:07:29] to have a voice i'm going to let you
[3:07:30] learn a few things that i didn't have
[3:07:32] the courage to teach you
[3:07:35] but i'm going to have a
[3:07:36] voice in your life just because they're
[3:07:39] out of our house doesn't mean we don't
[3:07:40] have a responsibility to lay something
[3:07:42] on the altar on their behalf
[3:07:45] and i'm closing
[3:07:47] i really am
[3:07:49] i want to give you four
[3:07:51] responsibilities very quickly not gonna
[3:07:53] elaborate on any of them much
[3:07:55] four responsibilities four priestly
[3:07:57] duties
[3:07:59] that every father needs to participate
[3:08:01] in
[3:08:02] in their family life number one
[3:08:04] intercessor
[3:08:06] that's what job was being an intercessor
[3:08:09] going to god for his children for his
[3:08:11] wife
[3:08:12] let me tell you something
[3:08:15] the best thing that a father could do
[3:08:17] for his wife a husband can do for his
[3:08:19] wife is pray for her
[3:08:22] call her name before the lord
[3:08:26] if she is not what you need her to be go
[3:08:28] to god
[3:08:30] cry out for her help
[3:08:33] she may be
[3:08:34] so so frustrated with her own self
[3:08:37] that she doesn't begin to know how to
[3:08:39] make any change in her life but if god
[3:08:42] is called if god is is implored if if
[3:08:45] you intercede to god he can step in and
[3:08:48] give her the strength to be what you
[3:08:50] need her to be
[3:08:52] mistreating her is not an option
[3:09:02] life and ministry of jesus shows us that
[3:09:04] intercession is an essential duty of
[3:09:05] every priest
[3:09:07] number two a father must be an
[3:09:08] instructor
[3:09:10] instructing is another essential of a
[3:09:12] priest
[3:09:13] central duty of a priest in the old
[3:09:14] testament times in addition to prophets
[3:09:17] priests also have served as the voice of
[3:09:20] god to the people
[3:09:21] there will be times that as a dad in
[3:09:23] your home
[3:09:25] you will be the voice of god to your
[3:09:28] family that is a huge responsibility may
[3:09:31] god strengthen you to be that if you
[3:09:33] have no children in your home then you
[3:09:35] but yet you're married and you have a
[3:09:37] wife you are
[3:09:39] at times the voice of god to your wife
[3:09:43] that's a serious
[3:09:45] serious responsibility
[3:09:49] number three we should be examples
[3:09:52] someone made the comment example is
[3:09:54] nobler than advice
[3:09:56] it's one thing to give advice it's
[3:09:58] another thing to lead by example may god
[3:10:00] help everyone wouldn't that be the
[3:10:01] desire of every dad in this house
[3:10:03] it's my desire
[3:10:05] as a dad and a spiritual dad to lead by
[3:10:08] example a leader
[3:10:09] jesus is not just our great high priest
[3:10:12] but he is also the ultimate model
[3:10:15] for all leadership
[3:10:17] it flows out of who he is
[3:10:20] two quotes
[3:10:21] one from a super sign
[3:10:23] you're going to wonder why i've chosen
[3:10:25] them this morning
[3:10:28] not one word is spoken about father's
[3:10:30] day
[3:10:31] he said it's predicted again malachi 4
[3:10:34] that it'll return again
[3:10:36] there will be a supersede rise up
[3:10:40] there's got to be something stand up
[3:10:42] that's got backbone
[3:10:44] and christian integrity
[3:10:46] certainly that will take this jezebel
[3:10:49] religion that's been pushed even into
[3:10:52] our pentecostal groups powerful isn't it
[3:10:54] jaya
[3:10:56] somebody will stand with christian
[3:10:59] spirit and fire with the holy ghost
[3:11:01] behind it to prove that it's right
[3:11:04] it's very likely he's referring to his
[3:11:06] own ministry but i want you to be
[3:11:08] reminded that in the beginning of this i
[3:11:11] told you the word seed
[3:11:13] is both singular and plural
[3:11:17] and i want to remind you that one man
[3:11:19] cannot be the voice
[3:11:22] to every person
[3:11:24] from generation to generation to
[3:11:26] generation
[3:11:27] and god is looking for men and women
[3:11:30] who will stand for righteousness with
[3:11:33] integrity and holiness in this hour with
[3:11:37] spirit and fire and without any
[3:11:39] compromise we are representing the
[3:11:41] message which is the revelation of jesus
[3:11:44] christ
[3:11:45] he said it shall be light in the evening
[3:11:47] time and he will restore the faith of
[3:11:50] the children back to the pentecostal
[3:11:52] fathers away from their dogmas and
[3:11:54] creeds it's got to come and it will come
[3:11:57] in the name of the lord it will come not
[3:12:01] only in his ministry
[3:12:03] but it must also be present in the
[3:12:05] bride's ministry can you say amen
[3:12:09] musicians are coming
[3:12:12] come with a song
[3:12:15] in the message and knoweth it not
[3:12:17] paragraph 287
[3:12:22] it starts with oh god
[3:12:28] oh god that's like the pulpit
[3:12:34] where is man
[3:12:36] man that's man
[3:12:38] that stands for a principle
[3:12:41] maybe i didn't give it all oh oh i see
[3:12:46] where is woman
[3:12:48] women
[3:12:49] that stands for a principle
[3:12:53] where is a church
[3:12:55] that stands for a principle
[3:12:58] i ain't got a nicholsworth can you
[3:13:00] understand that southern vernacular
[3:13:03] i ain't got a nickel's worth
[3:13:05] of time for a wishy-washy give-in
[3:13:08] compromising spirit
[3:13:12] a woman is a woman let her be a lady
[3:13:15] if a man is a man let him be a man
[3:13:18] if he's a president where is our john
[3:13:20] quincy adams is
[3:13:26] not being paraded through the public
[3:13:28] stumbling off of bicycles
[3:13:31] where is our john quincy adams's
[3:13:34] where is our abraham lincoln's men of
[3:13:38] principle
[3:13:40] where is our patrick henry said give me
[3:13:42] liberty
[3:13:43] or give me death
[3:13:45] where is a man that stands for what's
[3:13:47] right where is the man that's not afraid
[3:13:49] to speak out regardless
[3:13:52] the whole world's against him speak out
[3:13:55] for what's right
[3:13:58] and stand for it
[3:14:01] and die for it
[3:14:03] who sees the need for this kind of
[3:14:06] firmness in the land we're living in now
[3:14:08] the hour that we're living in where is
[3:14:10] our our arnold
[3:14:12] von wickards again today
[3:14:15] where is men of integrity
[3:14:18] that's the man who is credited for
[3:14:20] saving switzerland
[3:14:22] where is men of integrity where is men
[3:14:24] with spirit
[3:14:26] not spirits
[3:14:31] they're so wishy-washy and gumped up
[3:14:34] gummed up
[3:14:36] until they don't know where they stand
[3:14:39] if you looked around
[3:14:41] and saw our world this is what you'd see
[3:14:43] everywhere
[3:14:45] men who don't want to stand for anything
[3:14:47] and if you don't stand for something
[3:14:50] you'll fall for everything
[3:14:52] but there
[3:14:53] there is there will always be a people
[3:14:58] maybe in the minority
[3:15:00] but there will always be a people who
[3:15:02] stand
[3:15:04] for the instructions of god's word
[3:15:07] who upright themselves
[3:15:09] who allow the lord to clothe them in his
[3:15:13] righteousness
[3:15:14] and they will not be silenced in
[3:15:16] compromising times like the one we're
[3:15:19] living in i want you to look around
[3:15:22] we have no idea what we will face
[3:15:25] before the rapture of the church
[3:15:27] and i want you to look around this
[3:15:29] morning i want you to get to know one
[3:15:30] another
[3:15:31] and i want you to make very sure
[3:15:34] that these are the kind of men and women
[3:15:36] you would want to face the uncertain end
[3:15:38] times
[3:15:39] having around you
[3:15:43] you wouldn't want to face
[3:15:45] the uncertainty of the end times with
[3:15:48] men who have problems with authority
[3:15:53] because in those pressing moments
[3:15:57] in a life or death decision must be made
[3:15:59] i want you to know that
[3:16:01] every time you come to church there's
[3:16:03] somebody here
[3:16:06] that's ready to defend you
[3:16:09] if you need to be defended in the spirit
[3:16:13] and if you needed to be defended in the
[3:16:15] physical
[3:16:17] you are defended when you come to church
[3:16:19] here
[3:16:21] when someone comes in that we don't know
[3:16:23] we immediately begin to try to find out
[3:16:26] who that person is and if people are
[3:16:28] offended by that i don't really care
[3:16:31] but don't you want people to come we
[3:16:33] absolutely do
[3:16:35] but we want to know especially when men
[3:16:37] come in shifting and acting strange
[3:16:40] that we don't know
[3:16:42] we start asking who is that do you know
[3:16:44] that person can you find out who that is
[3:16:46] and why they're here and who knows them
[3:16:48] somebody said i just think that's
[3:16:49] fearful no it's actually a little bit
[3:16:52] practical
[3:16:53] and i want you to know that anytime
[3:16:55] you're in a service here there is more
[3:16:56] than one person who is ready to
[3:16:58] physically defend you
[3:17:00] if you needed to be physically defended
[3:17:05] and they are prepared to take out the
[3:17:08] threat
[3:17:09] before too much damage could be
[3:17:11] accomplished are you really bragging
[3:17:13] about that no not at all
[3:17:18] but it's a constitutional right
[3:17:21] one that i really believe is important
[3:17:25] for the hour that we're living in in
[3:17:26] this nation
[3:17:28] this would not apply to other nations
[3:17:31] because they're not in the position that
[3:17:32] we're in but we're in a very hostile
[3:17:35] environment right now where people are
[3:17:37] targeting churches as they did the one
[3:17:39] in vestavia hills this week 70 something
[3:17:41] year old man
[3:17:44] it's a serious hour so yes i want to
[3:17:46] know that i'm in a place that to the
[3:17:49] best of their ability they can offer me
[3:17:51] some some physical help
[3:17:53] some physical protection
[3:17:55] from whatever i'm but i also want to
[3:17:57] know that i'm in the trenches with
[3:17:59] people that i can trust spiritually
[3:18:04] you get to know one another then you
[3:18:06] make a decision about whether you're
[3:18:09] going to a church where you feel that
[3:18:10] you can really trust the people that you
[3:18:12] go to church with because i want to tell
[3:18:14] you something
[3:18:15] we've got to know that if there should
[3:18:17] ever come a time that we come down to
[3:18:19] not being able to buy or sell for even a
[3:18:22] short period of time before the rapture
[3:18:26] we would want to know that we go to
[3:18:27] church with people who are not selfish
[3:18:30] but who are willing who desire to
[3:18:32] provide for their families first that's
[3:18:33] your responsibility
[3:18:36] but who would be very very willing oh
[3:18:38] you're listening to me now
[3:18:39] i should have led with this
[3:18:42] but who would be very very willing to
[3:18:44] share their bread
[3:18:47] they wouldn't be wagging their finger at
[3:18:49] us and saying you should have prepared
[3:18:50] you should have prepared you should have
[3:18:51] prepared but would be willingness i want
[3:18:54] you to know i know for sure you've got
[3:18:56] to know for sure i know for sure
[3:18:59] you've got to know for sure that i go to
[3:19:01] church with people
[3:19:04] who if i were in
[3:19:06] a crisis
[3:19:07] one that we have
[3:19:10] do not see coming
[3:19:12] i feel so thankful and so confident
[3:19:16] that i'm surrounded in this little house
[3:19:18] by people who would have my best
[3:19:20] interest at heart
[3:19:21] and who would make sure that if there
[3:19:23] was a need in my family they would be
[3:19:25] more than willing to try to help meet
[3:19:27] that need and i want to do the same for
[3:19:29] yours
[3:19:31] because we don't know what the future
[3:19:32] holds
[3:19:35] we saw churches closed and edicts made
[3:19:38] and we were
[3:19:39] much more blessed in this area than many
[3:19:42] places in this country but we know
[3:19:44] people in canada who are still dealing
[3:19:46] with the charges and the fines and the
[3:19:48] crimes that have been lodged against
[3:19:50] them because they continued to have
[3:19:52] church some of them had service outside
[3:19:55] and were arrested and the fees the
[3:19:58] the legal fees are mounting up to be
[3:20:00] millions of dollars now that they're
[3:20:01] having to pay to defend themselves
[3:20:03] against their own government because the
[3:20:05] government come and made an edict
[3:20:08] that was not in the good interest of
[3:20:10] protecting someone's religious freedom
[3:20:13] those people are having to rally
[3:20:14] together
[3:20:17] they're having to give to one another
[3:20:18] they're trying to help each other it's
[3:20:20] vitally important for you to begin to
[3:20:22] recognize that there are men and women
[3:20:25] sitting around in this house that if we
[3:20:27] should go to hard times we could go
[3:20:29] there together
[3:20:32] with the assurance of knowing they
[3:20:33] wouldn't be fly by nights
[3:20:36] and when the going got tough they'd be
[3:20:38] here
[3:20:39] to help us get through it
[3:20:44] well you certainly are talking about the
[3:20:46] senior men what senior men
[3:20:52] our senior men most of them brother reed
[3:20:55] have gone by the way of the grave
[3:20:57] we've said goodbye to our granddaddies
[3:20:59] and our
[3:21:01] and our senior men
[3:21:04] we can't wait for
[3:21:06] these men to get old
[3:21:09] we have to begin to see the value in
[3:21:11] their life right now i want you to know
[3:21:13] there are men in this house right now
[3:21:17] that if i had to go into uncertain times
[3:21:19] tomorrow i would be so thrilled and so
[3:21:22] blessed and so confident to know
[3:21:24] there's some of them sitting on this
[3:21:26] platform today
[3:21:27] that i would not be afraid to go into
[3:21:29] the uncertainty of the end time with men
[3:21:32] like that in my
[3:21:33] in my corner on my team
[3:21:41] i know that not only do they
[3:21:43] pack
[3:21:45] but i know that if i was hungry
[3:21:48] they would share what they had
[3:21:50] and of course if they didn't i would
[3:21:52] remind them of all the years i fed them
[3:21:56] and now their children
[3:22:01] we are blessed
[3:22:03] we may not have a lot of older men in
[3:22:05] this house but we are blessed
[3:22:08] because we have men of integrity
[3:22:11] fathers who love their children
[3:22:14] men who are going to stand for the truth
[3:22:18] what a blessing it is
[3:22:20] let's stand together
[3:22:24] this must go down in the
[3:22:26] history books is one of the strangest
[3:22:29] sermons you've ever heard
[3:22:31] but may god use it somehow to speak to
[3:22:34] your heart and thank you all you
[3:22:36] precious people from around the world
[3:22:38] that are wishing me a happy father's day
[3:22:40] thank you so much

[3:22:45] was the day that i became a father
[3:22:47] that's a truth
[3:22:49] there's nothing in this world like it
[3:22:54] never dreamed that i would be so blessed
[3:22:57] but god allowed it to be
[3:23:01] he gave it to us
[3:23:03] he allowed it
[3:23:06] i
[3:23:07] did not
[3:23:08] know and discern and understand the love
[3:23:11] of an earthly father
[3:23:14] but i have to tell you
[3:23:17] i've had the best papa
[3:23:19] i've had the best father i've had the
[3:23:21] best daddy
