[50:31] not expensive asking the Lord to do that
[50:33] for them

[1:07:02] mother
[1:07:03] and we want to say happy birthday sister
[1:07:06] Wagner thank you for your faithful
[1:07:08] service to the Lord
[1:07:11] you know I know that sometimes we
[1:07:13] mention some of these Saints and you
[1:07:15] have not had the privilege of meeting
[1:07:17] them
[1:07:18] and uh but it's just necessary that we
[1:07:21] call their name from time to time do you
[1:07:23] know I was Sister hoyer's Pastor 31
[1:07:26] years
[1:07:28] that's a long time
[1:07:30] 31 years
[1:07:31] I won't even be able to attend this
[1:07:34] memorial service for her or take part in
[1:07:37] that in any way
[1:07:38] the family has decided to do a graveside
[1:07:42] service and I have no passport
[1:07:45] my passport renewal is not complete and
[1:07:49] it really really breaks my heart but it
[1:07:52] is it is just what it is
[1:07:55] we can't say that we believe in the
[1:07:57] sovereignty of God and then question it
[1:07:59] when it comes
[1:08:00] he has a reason for it but my heart is
[1:08:04] with the Hoyer family they are wonderful
[1:08:07] wonderful people sister Hoyer was a
[1:08:10] wonderful Saint I'm not going to speak
[1:08:11] about her this morning but I am going to
[1:08:14] share a few thoughts about her in in a
[1:08:16] coming an upcoming service so that her
[1:08:19] family can at least know our thoughts
[1:08:21] and our appreciation for their support
[1:08:24] they were we people
[1:08:27] brother and sister Hoyer both stood
[1:08:29] about about like that
[1:08:31] and uh they were here for our original
[1:08:34] camp meeting when we started and they
[1:08:37] stayed with us for many many many years
[1:08:41] I will say this quickly and I'll mention
[1:08:43] it again but I feel like I want to say
[1:08:45] this but brother Henry and sister Susie
[1:08:48] Peters
[1:08:49] those of you that don't know the Peters
[1:08:51] they came from I don't think it was
[1:08:54] Mennonite I think maybe it was hutterite
[1:08:57] they were precious saints of God and
[1:08:59] they heard the message
[1:09:01] and they came to the ministry of brother
[1:09:03] Branham and they were dear friends of
[1:09:05] the hoyers
[1:09:06] for those of you that don't know who the
[1:09:08] Peters are you will know them by their
[1:09:11] relatives
[1:09:12] they were the parents of of sister Carol
[1:09:16] Flint
[1:09:18] and I don't remember her newly married
[1:09:19] name I'm sorry
[1:09:21] she was fled to us for so many years and
[1:09:24] her husband Bruce went home to be with
[1:09:26] the Lord
[1:09:27] and Chad and I had the privilege of
[1:09:29] being in their home and and preaching in
[1:09:32] their home once upon a time when brother
[1:09:35] and sister Peters heard the word of the
[1:09:37] Lord and heard and recognized the
[1:09:38] prophet that God had sent to prepare a
[1:09:41] bride they shared the message of Truth
[1:09:43] with the hoyers
[1:09:44] and it's so thrilled them
[1:09:47] they were so changed they were so so uh
[1:09:51] their life was new
[1:09:53] and they have left a legacy of children
[1:09:55] and grandchildren who believe this
[1:09:57] message because of it but I'll never
[1:10:00] forget sitting with sister Hoyer
[1:10:01] multiple times in her saying saying to
[1:10:04] us we love the Peters
[1:10:08] God let them lead us to the ministry of
[1:10:12] brother Branham
[1:10:13] and then she said God used helmet and I
[1:10:17] to lead the Peters to your ministry
[1:10:20] brother Shelley and we were just as
[1:10:22] excited when we heard that God was still
[1:10:25] real and that he was still moving and
[1:10:27] that he was still the same yesterday
[1:10:29] today and forever as we were when we
[1:10:31] heard these truths that had been
[1:10:34] restored so this is all on my heart
[1:10:36] today God is a good god
[1:10:39] tomorrow January the second is the
[1:10:42] anniversary of meeting the high seas for
[1:10:45] the first time in 1992
[1:10:48] and so God let me be their Pastor a long
[1:10:51] time they were in the Show Low they were
[1:10:53] in Show Low Arizona in the White
[1:10:55] Mountains they were not going to attend
[1:10:57] the meeting at Brother Dean Hearts where
[1:10:59] I was preaching
[1:11:00] they were there for a holiday and they
[1:11:03] were there to say goodbye to the
[1:11:05] mountain cabin because it was going to
[1:11:07] be sold in the divorce they had already
[1:11:10] met with the attorney the papers were
[1:11:12] already drawn up and they were ready to
[1:11:14] sign and God put on their heart they
[1:11:17] heard about the meetings in the little
[1:11:19] town of Show Low and they were held in a
[1:11:21] honey house
[1:11:23] where where the where the zincas and I'm
[1:11:26] I've seen them last January for the last
[1:11:29] last time I saw them was last January in
[1:11:31] harmony brother Tom zinka and his wife
[1:11:35] were bee farmers
[1:11:37] and they emptied out the honey house and
[1:11:41] began to have Services there and invited
[1:11:43] me to come
[1:11:44] Tommy Rector was with me and he had been
[1:11:47] a bad boy
[1:11:48] and God had called him out about it
[1:11:52] and he was repentant
[1:11:54] and he had wired he he while being a bad
[1:11:58] boy he fell off a curb
[1:12:01] in a restaurant passed out his
[1:12:04] blood sugar was thrown off
[1:12:06] for whatever reason
[1:12:09] and uh
[1:12:11] he fell off of curb in Montgomery and
[1:12:13] broke his jaw
[1:12:15] and God started using that to deal with
[1:12:17] him about getting his life really
[1:12:19] straightened out
[1:12:21] he came and he
[1:12:24] he couldn't eat except through a straw
[1:12:28] he loved my mother's blueberry dump cake
[1:12:30] it's not very complicated is it you all
[1:12:32] know the recipe you just dump it all in
[1:12:35] he said that's what I regret more than
[1:12:38] anything about my broke jaw
[1:12:40] I thank God for using it to get my life
[1:12:42] straightened out but he said I just
[1:12:44] regret that I'm not going to be able to
[1:12:45] have any of moss blueberry dump cake
[1:12:47] this for lunch today she said don't
[1:12:49] worry about it she took a big old
[1:12:51] spoonful of it and put it in the blender
[1:12:53] and add a little bit of milk and made
[1:12:55] him a blueberry dump cake milkshake
[1:12:59] he knew I was scheduled to leave and I
[1:13:01] said why don't you just go with me
[1:13:03] and he said he would and we we shot off
[1:13:06] the Tucson neither one of us he knew the
[1:13:09] high seas and I didn't know them
[1:13:11] they'd been in service with me in the
[1:13:13] Tabernacle but I didn't know them
[1:13:16] so at the last minute he
[1:13:18] agreed that he would go with me and we
[1:13:21] got out there and God did some mighty
[1:13:23] powerful things some of you were in the
[1:13:24] services
[1:13:26] I was in the back study and
[1:13:29] while I was studying Tommy come and
[1:13:31] knocked on the door and he was pale as a
[1:13:33] ghost
[1:13:34] he had no color at all and he said
[1:13:36] brother Shelley I'm in the most awful
[1:13:39] fix I've ever been in I said what is it
[1:13:41] he said John and Ruth Anheuser out there
[1:13:44] and I can't face them
[1:13:47] I said well why can't you face them
[1:13:49] Tommy he said because I taught their son
[1:13:52] how to use drugs
[1:13:55] he he showed me marijuana and I showed
[1:13:58] him something a whole lot worse than
[1:14:00] that I showed him how to use a needle
[1:14:03] and he said I can't go out there and
[1:14:05] face them
[1:14:06] knowing that I'm the one and I'm
[1:14:08] responsible and believe me that mistake
[1:14:10] cost the high seas a lot of life
[1:14:13] and a lot of money
[1:14:16] he said I can't face him I said you get
[1:14:18] right back out there
[1:14:20] if if you claim that God has forgiven
[1:14:22] you of those sins you've got to go out
[1:14:24] there and make amends
[1:14:26] I got up and preached that night I don't
[1:14:28] even know what I preach we have it it's
[1:14:30] on tape we have it
[1:14:31] I got up and preached that night and
[1:14:33] sister heisey was sitting there and the
[1:14:35] Lord spoke to her and said ruthanne that
[1:14:38] is a man that you can trust
[1:14:40] you listen to him
[1:14:42] God not only turned their life around
[1:14:46] saved their marriage
[1:14:48] brought them some years later to Alabama
[1:14:51] we have buried them both they are now
[1:14:53] together again with the Lord
[1:14:57] and I'm so thankful for that
[1:14:59] these are things that God did 30 years
[1:15:02] ago he's still moving

[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:37] uh I want to read a scripture we're not
[1:16:40] preaching yet
[1:16:42] uh
[1:16:43] can you all be in here in about 10
[1:16:45] minutes can you make it snappy that I'm
[1:16:47] Gonna Let You Go head down then I don't
[1:16:49] want you to miss something
[1:16:51] I'm going to show something in a minute
[1:16:53] before I preach everybody okay
[1:16:55] we got you here we might as well keep
[1:16:58] you a while
[1:17:00] I want to read you you don't have to
[1:17:02] stand you can stand in a moment when we
[1:17:03] preach you stood over an hour
[1:17:07] I want to read you the
[1:17:09] psalm 123.
[1:17:12] this is the psalm for 2023.
[1:17:17] we've been reading these Psalms for
[1:17:19] quite a few years now
[1:17:21] and we are always amazed
[1:17:25] at how prophetic they are for the year
[1:17:29] there's a few things in in Psalm 122
[1:17:32] that I thought we're going to have a
[1:17:34] little bit of a different literal
[1:17:36] meaning than they did
[1:17:38] but that's okay
[1:17:40] we saw God do some amazing things that
[1:17:43] were outlined for us in Psalm 122 so
[1:17:48] we'll read four verses
[1:17:51] that's all there is to Psalm 123 and if
[1:17:53] you've got a pen you can mark it there
[1:17:55] that's the psalm for 2023.
[1:17:58] unto thee lift I up mine eyes
[1:18:03] oh thou that dwelleth in the heavens
[1:18:07] period
[1:18:09] back to verse 1.
[1:18:11] now you know what that means
[1:18:13] it means in 2023 I'm not going to get my
[1:18:17] eyes on my circumstances
[1:18:21] I'm not going to get my eyes on my
[1:18:23] problems I'm not going to get my eyes on
[1:18:26] my bills
[1:18:27] I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord
[1:18:30] it means I'm not going to look at people
[1:18:33] in 2023.
[1:18:36] they're going to fail us
[1:18:39] we're gonna fail one another we're gonna
[1:18:41] disappoint one another we're not going
[1:18:44] to be to one another always what we
[1:18:46] require
[1:18:48] you understand that
[1:18:50] and God is teaching us he's taught us
[1:18:52] this year more than any
[1:18:54] that we're not going to come to church
[1:18:56] and look at other people we're going to
[1:18:59] come and worship the Lord
[1:19:02] some of you people experience that
[1:19:04] living communally
[1:19:06] as God brought you here
[1:19:09] and there's nothing in the world to bump
[1:19:11] off the rough edges
[1:19:13] like living communally
[1:19:18] I don't know how the early Apostles did
[1:19:20] it they must have been more full of the
[1:19:22] Holy Ghost than we are
[1:19:24] but they lived communally
[1:19:27] and they bumped one another
[1:19:30] and they stepped on one another but we
[1:19:33] had to come to church and forget it
[1:19:38] we had to cut they had to come to church
[1:19:41] and focus on the Lord
[1:19:44] so 2023 is going to be a year again
[1:19:47] where it is vitally important to lift up
[1:19:51] your eyes and look at the one who sits
[1:19:54] above it all I want your undivided
[1:19:57] attention this morning
[1:19:59] number two behold
[1:20:02] as the eyes of servants look unto the
[1:20:05] hand of their masters and as the eyes of
[1:20:08] a maiden under the hand of her mistress
[1:20:11] so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God
[1:20:18] Hallelujah until that he have mercy upon
[1:20:22] us
[1:20:23] a butler a a a a a a
[1:20:30] servant of some kind
[1:20:32] a personal assistant of some kind
[1:20:38] what do you call that a chauffeur
[1:20:41] we're talking about Biblical times
[1:20:45] of course there weren't chauffeurs then
[1:20:47] I get it not personal assistance I get
[1:20:49] it I was trying to make it a little
[1:20:50] trying to show you both sides
[1:20:52] they depend on the one who hires them
[1:20:57] that's where their paycheck comes from
[1:21:01] uh a maid that is hired we don't do this
[1:21:04] so much in our society but a maid that's
[1:21:07] hired a ladies made
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] to serve her mistress
[1:21:12] she looks to her
[1:21:15] she's the one who makes sure she's paid
[1:21:18] she's the one that gives her her New
[1:21:20] Year's bonus
[1:21:22] God said through the psalmist here
[1:21:24] prophetically for this year this is
[1:21:27] going to be a year for you not to look
[1:21:29] to your employer hello
[1:21:33] as your source and supply
[1:21:36] and not to look at your Rich uncle
[1:21:40] as your source and Supply but to look
[1:21:44] unto the Lord our eyes wait upon the
[1:21:48] Lord Our God until that he have mercy
[1:21:51] upon us
[1:21:52] we are depending on
[1:21:56] 2023 how many of you understand the
[1:21:59] Simplicity of that
[1:22:01] verse 3 have mercy upon us O Lord have
[1:22:05] mercy upon us
[1:22:08] we've preached about double Grace
[1:22:12] here the psalmist is asking for double
[1:22:14] Mercy have mercy upon us O Lord have
[1:22:18] mercy
[1:22:20] so we're going to need the Lord's Mercy
[1:22:24] there's going to be some times this year
[1:22:26] that we're going to feel the squeeze
[1:22:30] we're going to feel the crunch you're
[1:22:33] not listening
[1:22:35] there's going to be some times this year
[1:22:38] that we feel the loss
[1:22:40] and the grief
[1:22:43] of losing things
[1:22:46] and people that we love
[1:22:49] but God will have mercy
[1:22:53] and again he will have mercy
[1:22:57] on us
[1:22:59] for we are exceedingly filled with
[1:23:03] contempt
[1:23:04] now in order to understand that you've
[1:23:06] got to catch the last verse
[1:23:09] our soul is exceedingly filled with the
[1:23:14] scorning
[1:23:16] of those that are at ease
[1:23:19] and with the contempt
[1:23:22] of the proud
[1:23:25] that word contempt is a mild form of
[1:23:30] hatred
[1:23:32] it is a disgust
[1:23:35] and I want you to know the way you live
[1:23:37] your life disgusts people
[1:23:41] now ten years ago that might have been
[1:23:43] too strong of a word but it's not too
[1:23:46] strong of a word now people are
[1:23:49] disgusted with real Christians
[1:23:53] they're disgusted with holiness
[1:23:56] they're disgusted with message believers
[1:24:00] they want you to blend in they don't
[1:24:02] want you to stand out
[1:24:04] they want you to blend in
[1:24:06] we're living in an hour where where a
[1:24:08] man would rather demand his rights
[1:24:12] than to allow his ex-wife to carry her
[1:24:15] child their children somewhere where
[1:24:18] they might get help
[1:24:20] and they might serve the Lord and they
[1:24:23] might have a different life let me tell
[1:24:25] you something that's the kind of
[1:24:27] contempt that we Garner
[1:24:32] our church even your pastor mentioned in
[1:24:36] legal proceedings right now
[1:24:39] because of someone wanting to change
[1:24:42] their life
[1:24:43] and make a better start
[1:24:45] and it shows the hour that we're living
[1:24:48] in let me tell you something if we loved
[1:24:50] our children if we loved our family we
[1:24:53] would want them to get all they can get
[1:24:56] from God
[1:24:57] but instead the world around us mocks
[1:25:01] that
[1:25:02] they took a little little line on the
[1:25:04] website that talks about uh the the the
[1:25:07] the prophecy of my birth and make it
[1:25:10] sound like we're some bunch of weirdos
[1:25:13] here
[1:25:14] that's the year that we're living in
[1:25:18] a year where our soul is going to be
[1:25:21] filled with the scorning mind will and
[1:25:23] emotions
[1:25:24] it's going to be having to deal with the
[1:25:27] scorning of those that are what
[1:25:30] at ease they don't even know the day and
[1:25:34] the hour that they're living in they
[1:25:36] don't even know how close they are to
[1:25:38] the end of all things
[1:25:40] and so to see someone making an effort
[1:25:43] to draw closer to the Lord it it
[1:25:46] disgusts them and fills them with
[1:25:49] contempt what we must make sure is that
[1:25:52] we keep that contempt out of our own
[1:25:54] heart
[1:25:56] we must not have contempt for one
[1:25:58] another anybody listening to me we must
[1:26:02] not have discussed toward one another
[1:26:06] aggravation can sometimes lead
[1:26:11] frustration can sometimes lead to
[1:26:14] contempt so God is saying you're going
[1:26:17] to face it and you're going to cry out
[1:26:20] not just for Mercy you're going to say
[1:26:22] Mercy Mercy
[1:26:24] but I want to assure you Hallelujah that
[1:26:28] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:26:32] Hear It Go hear the sermon go listen go
[1:26:35] get ready
[1:26:36] God is rich in Mercy
[1:26:39] and he's got plenty of Mercy for us when
[1:26:44] we're facing things and facing scoffers
[1:26:46] and facing circumstances so this is our
[1:26:51] year somebody said that sounds kind of
[1:26:53] Bleak it does not
[1:26:55] it would if you were out of the Ark of
[1:26:57] Safety
[1:27:00] but if you know where you stand and you
[1:27:02] know whose hands you're in
[1:27:04] you have nothing to worry about
[1:27:08] I want your attention
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:11] you have nothing to worry about
[1:27:14] now it doesn't get any more prophetic
[1:27:16] than that
[1:27:17] so you better hold on to that God's
[1:27:19] going to help us
[1:27:21] now I want to show you something now
[1:27:22] would you believe I took my marker out
[1:27:24] of something else I wanted to read does
[1:27:26] that ever happen to you you need a you
[1:27:29] need more markers
[1:27:33] give me just a moment
[1:27:35] I want to read now Matthew 5. these are
[1:27:37] sermonettes that was sermonette number
[1:27:39] one
[1:27:42] just make sure you're not a
[1:27:44] christianette
[1:27:47] Jimmy Swaggart used to say sermonettes
[1:27:50] are for christianettes who need
[1:27:52] bassinets
[1:27:57] the yovitches are four hours and 20
[1:27:59] minutes away and and that was uh 12 13
[1:28:02] that was about 10 minutes ago there are
[1:28:04] four hours and 10 minutes away and they
[1:28:06] want me to know that if I preach long
[1:28:07] enough they can catch the tail end of
[1:28:09] the service in person
[1:28:11] let me say you all are more enthusiastic
[1:28:14] than most of them sitting here this
[1:28:16] morning
[1:28:22] Ben is letting us know that the
[1:28:24] Southwest got back on track Friday and
[1:28:26] have only had a few cancellations Friday
[1:28:28] and Saturday so they're believing that
[1:28:31] everything looks good for their trip
[1:28:32] thank you for that report we'll ignore
[1:28:34] it and keep praying
[1:28:38] because we're living in an uncertain
[1:28:40] hour
[1:28:42] uh there's something I want to say but I
[1:28:45] won't say I can't I just won't yet but I
[1:28:47] would like to say it
[1:28:49] but I don't know I don't think we're
[1:28:51] nearly ready for it I don't think I'm
[1:28:53] ready for it
[1:28:55] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:28:58] and I want to read verse 17 and 18.
[1:29:02] think not
[1:29:06] 5 17 and 18.
[1:29:10] think not
[1:29:14] that I am come to destroy the law
[1:29:18] or the prophets
[1:29:20] so all of you hyper Grace
[1:29:23] people out there
[1:29:25] who don't believe there are any
[1:29:27] Commandments any instructions any
[1:29:30] statutes any ordinances that we must
[1:29:34] live by as Christian Believers and those
[1:29:36] of you who believe that the law was done
[1:29:39] away with in Christ
[1:29:41] you're wrong
[1:29:45] Jesus didn't say so
[1:29:47] Jesus did not come to take us back under
[1:29:50] the bondage of the law no sir
[1:29:53] there is no Temple
[1:29:58] you are now the temple
[1:30:00] so many ordinances and Commandments that
[1:30:03] speak of Temple worship
[1:30:05] cannot be fulfilled today
[1:30:08] but that's not the purpose of Jesus
[1:30:10] coming
[1:30:12] he didn't come to destroy the law or the
[1:30:14] prophets he said I am not come to
[1:30:16] destroy but to
[1:30:19] fulfill that word fulfill means to fill
[1:30:22] up
[1:30:23] one of the one of the other translations
[1:30:25] says to complete
[1:30:28] I came to complete the law
[1:30:32] so the finishing of the law is not
[1:30:34] destroying it the finishing of the law
[1:30:38] is fulfilling it
[1:30:40] everything the law was pointing to is
[1:30:43] found in Jesus if you get Jesus you have
[1:30:47] what the law was pointing to so you've
[1:30:51] got to be careful how you go back and
[1:30:53] take up the law when you now have Jesus
[1:30:57] because he is the Fulfillment of the law
[1:31:01] you say that's easy no
[1:31:04] it's not as easy as some think it is
[1:31:06] it's striking a very careful balance
[1:31:12] and there's not a lot of balance in a
[1:31:14] modern Christian life so we've got to
[1:31:17] keep our balance as brother Branham
[1:31:19] instructed brother Perry green keep your
[1:31:22] balance in the scriptures we have to do
[1:31:25] that
[1:31:25] then he said for verily I say unto you
[1:31:29] till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or
[1:31:34] one Tittle shall in no wise pass from
[1:31:38] the law till
[1:31:41] all be fulfilled
[1:31:44] and that means that everything will not
[1:31:46] be 100
[1:31:48] completed and finished until Heaven and
[1:31:51] Earth passes and we are one with him
[1:31:56] in eternity
[1:31:58] that's right that jock and Tittle are
[1:32:02] vowel marks
[1:32:04] in the Hebrew language and they change
[1:32:07] the meaning of the word and the
[1:32:10] pronunciation of the word by where the
[1:32:12] vowel Mark is placed in the word
[1:32:15] and so Jesus is saying he's not saying
[1:32:19] one word of the law he's saying
[1:32:22] something smaller than that not even a
[1:32:24] vowel mark
[1:32:25] not even a period let's say it like we
[1:32:28] could understand it not even a comma not
[1:32:31] even a semicolon is going to pass away
[1:32:36] or be forgotten until all be fulfilled
[1:32:41] but you all cut the lights and let me
[1:32:43] show you what I was talking about
[1:32:44] Tuesday night
[1:32:50] be the chosen Seed of Abraham
[1:32:54] you may be the people of the Covenants
[1:32:58] that will not bring you my salvation
[1:33:03] if you cannot accept
[1:33:05] that you are spiritually poor
[1:33:08] captive in the same way that a gentile
[1:33:11] woman and a Syrian leper recognize their
[1:33:15] need
[1:33:23] if you do not realize
[1:33:26] you need a year of the Lord's favor
[1:33:32] and I cannot save you
[1:33:47] who do you think you are this is what
[1:33:49] Hara talked about
[1:33:51] that he even called himself the Messiah
[1:33:53] are you claiming to be he's a messiah
[1:33:55] Messiah or are you merely claiming to
[1:33:57] speak for the Lord as a prophet
[1:34:05] yes
[1:34:09] you are a false prophet well that is
[1:34:13] quite a thing to say you
[1:34:16] read his friend you cannot be involved
[1:34:19] you know what the law of Moses we are
[1:34:21] all his friends Aaron we cannot say
[1:34:23] things like this please stand up at once
[1:34:25] Rabbi please Rafi come with Jesus in me
[1:34:28] we will leave and you can all continue
[1:34:30] this Rabbi Benjamin has asserted false
[1:34:32] prophecy and I cannot argue you said you
[1:34:34] saw the mirror he sang Only and safe he
[1:34:37] did not use those words it's what I
[1:34:39] meant you're not helping stop he he's
[1:34:41] saying we are not the holy ones chosen
[1:34:43] now he did not say that in words a book
[1:34:46] of Moses
[1:34:47] Prophet who presumes to speak a word in
[1:34:50] my name that I have not commanded him to
[1:34:52] speak
[1:34:53] that same Prophet shall die Rabbi
[1:34:56] Benjamin I beg of you
[1:34:59] Lazarus
[1:35:01] it's fine
[1:35:14] yes
[1:35:20] juices
[1:35:22] if you do not renounce your words
[1:35:25] we will have no choice but to follow the
[1:35:28] law of Moses
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:49] foreign
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:18] in
[1:36:21] [Applause]
[1:36:27] I am the law of Moses
[1:36:30] so if anyone asks you why they see a
[1:36:33] scroll
[1:36:35] or why they see shofars or why we blow
[1:36:38] silver trumpets
[1:36:39] or why we have a Passover meal or where
[1:36:42] we like why we lie to candelabra at
[1:36:44] Hanukkah
[1:36:45] or why we build Asuka
[1:36:47] simply because Jesus did not come to
[1:36:51] destroy the law he came to be the law
[1:36:54] he came to fulfill the law and all of
[1:36:59] these things keep pointing us
[1:37:06] that's why Messianic Jews continue to
[1:37:09] remember the Sabbath
[1:37:11] because the Sabbath points to the one
[1:37:13] who said I am
[1:37:15] I am the rest
[1:37:18] I am the rest these are dress rehearsals
[1:37:21] that point us to the reality of who
[1:37:24] Jesus is
[1:37:25] and to me the whole gospel the whole
[1:37:28] gospel has been summed up in that scene
[1:37:32] I am the law of Moses
[1:37:34] it would do us all very good to remember
[1:37:37] who he is
[1:37:38] he is the Fulfillment of all the verses
[1:37:40] that pointed to him
[1:37:43] brother Branham saw that and that's why
[1:37:45] he told us to keep our eyes on Jerusalem
[1:37:47] because it was God's time clock
[1:37:50] and whether you realize it or not we're
[1:37:52] just living as Gentile Nations who have
[1:37:55] been called in and we are very very
[1:37:58] blessed to have heard the call but it's
[1:38:01] about Israel
[1:38:03] yes
[1:38:04] this was God reaching out for his
[1:38:07] Covenant people
[1:38:09] and in doing so he decided I'm going to
[1:38:12] call out a people from among the
[1:38:14] Gentiles for my name and you got to be
[1:38:17] one of those somebody ought to give God
[1:38:19] praise
[1:38:21] he didn't have to do it
[1:38:23] he didn't have to do it
[1:38:27] he didn't have to do it but he did
[1:38:31] let's stand again
[1:38:34] foreign
[1:38:36] we could go home
[1:38:39] I want you to turn to
[1:38:42] on Tuesday night we read Hebrews chapter
[1:38:45] 2 verse 12 through 18.
[1:38:49] this morning I want to read Hebrews
[1:38:52] chapter 2 verse 6 through 11.
[1:38:56] thank you everyone who
[1:39:00] is streaming the service today
[1:39:04] and thank you to all of you who streamed
[1:39:07] Tuesday night or to those who have
[1:39:09] watched it in the archive and have
[1:39:12] reached out
[1:39:14] we've had an unusual amount of people
[1:39:18] much more than usual to reach out and
[1:39:21] say that they received particular help
[1:39:25] in the service on Tuesday night to God
[1:39:28] be the glory
[1:39:29] to God be the glory
[1:39:31] thank you thank every one of you staff
[1:39:33] members also and and those who are
[1:39:36] working to help help spread this truth
[1:39:39] because God is doing something
[1:39:42] 2023 is going to be one of the most
[1:39:45] Supernatural years that we have ever
[1:39:47] seen and we want to be right in the
[1:39:49] middle of all that God is doing he said
[1:39:51] I will restore I will
[1:39:55] restore it is a year of restoration and
[1:40:00] of reconciliation which is God coming
[1:40:04] back and putting that that missing part
[1:40:07] that extra part of what was stolen God
[1:40:10] says I'm not only going to give you back
[1:40:12] what the enemy was allowed to take from
[1:40:14] you but I'm going to give you the extra
[1:40:16] lump I'm going to give you the extra fat
[1:40:19] you're going to see my hand and that's
[1:40:22] not going to fall on
[1:40:25] that's not going to fall on us like ripe
[1:40:28] cherries from a tree you're going to
[1:40:30] have to get in line
[1:40:32] Lord was speaking just strange things
[1:40:35] sister Jeffrey just strange things
[1:40:39] one one thing that he spoke to me
[1:40:41] yesterday
[1:40:43] is he said sister said Jeffrey is going
[1:40:46] to have on that yellow dress
[1:40:50] I didn't know what yellow dress he was
[1:40:53] talking about
[1:40:55] and I said Lord I don't even know why
[1:40:57] you'd say that to me
[1:40:59] I'm not sure what that would even matter
[1:41:01] or mean and then I looked there on
[1:41:04] Facebook and saw the yellow dress I
[1:41:06] don't know if that's the same yellow
[1:41:08] dress or not but I saw you in a dress
[1:41:10] like that in the picture Under the Tent
[1:41:12] is that the same dress you had on the
[1:41:15] day it's not the same you've got a gold
[1:41:17] dress I guess and a yellow dress
[1:41:20] but I don't know why in the world
[1:41:21] something like that would come
[1:41:24] but it did
[1:41:27] so I know she's in the right place at
[1:41:29] the right time
[1:41:31] I hope you are
[1:41:35] Hebrews chapter 2 God arrests me and uh
[1:41:39] watch over my words
[1:41:43] verse 6 through 11.
[1:41:45] but one in a certain place testified
[1:41:48] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[1:41:53] of him or the son of man that thou
[1:41:56] visitest him
[1:41:58] thou mayest him a little lower than the
[1:42:02] Angels thou crownest Tim with glory and
[1:42:06] honor and did it set him over the works
[1:42:10] of thy hands
[1:42:12] thou has put all things in subjection
[1:42:16] under his feet
[1:42:19] for in that he put all in subjection
[1:42:22] under him he left nothing I want you to
[1:42:25] say nothing
[1:42:27] he left nothing that is not under him no
[1:42:31] disease
[1:42:33] no statistic
[1:42:35] no situation
[1:42:37] no circumstance
[1:42:41] nothing in history nothing in the
[1:42:45] present nothing in the future that is
[1:42:48] not under him
[1:42:50] you're all right if you've got him if
[1:42:53] you're holding on to him you're all
[1:42:55] right
[1:42:56] if you wanted the most Supernatural year
[1:42:58] of your life you better hear him
[1:43:02] we'd better make an effort because again
[1:43:05] it's not going to just fall on us we're
[1:43:08] going to have to stand and step up in
[1:43:10] line
[1:43:12] the Lord spoke to my heart again
[1:43:14] yesterday and uh just strange ways he
[1:43:17] said I want you to Mark online
[1:43:20] the first the last person to give online
[1:43:25] in 2022 and the first person to give
[1:43:29] online in 2023 and I want you to release
[1:43:33] a special blessing over them
[1:43:35] I thought Lord if I get up and say that
[1:43:38] I'll sound like a TV preacher
[1:43:42] I can't say something like that but I
[1:43:44] just did
[1:43:46] I asked him to guard my heart
[1:43:49] and so I'm going to do that
[1:43:52] I'm praying already this morning when I
[1:43:56] got up I looked to see who the last one
[1:43:58] was
[1:44:00] and who the first one was and we all can
[1:44:03] receive a Blessing by being faithful to
[1:44:05] him but God just for some reason he said
[1:44:07] Mark that
[1:44:09] and pray a special blessing over their
[1:44:12] lives maybe it's just confirmation to me
[1:44:16] that this is going to be a supernatural
[1:44:18] year where God does that that's
[1:44:20] Supernatural you can't arrange that
[1:44:23] nobody knows when they're giving they're
[1:44:25] going to be the last or the first nobody
[1:44:28] probably has that in their mind
[1:44:33] but God knows
[1:44:38] but now we see not yet all things
[1:44:42] put under him
[1:44:44] unbelief is still raging
[1:44:48] there's still wickedness in the land
[1:44:53] look at what he goes on to say
[1:44:55] potentially it's all there isn't it but
[1:44:59] we see Jesus
[1:45:01] who has made a little lower than the
[1:45:03] angels for the suffering of death crown
[1:45:06] with Glory and Honor that he by the
[1:45:10] grace of God should taste death
[1:45:13] what does it say
[1:45:16] for every man for it became him
[1:45:20] for it became him for whom are all
[1:45:25] things and by whom are all things in
[1:45:30] bringing
[1:45:34] he wasn't just coming to get one son
[1:45:37] he was coming coming to get many sons
[1:45:40] he wasn't just coming for a wave Chief
[1:45:42] offering he was coming for the rest of
[1:45:45] the Harvest as well
[1:45:47] maybe our Lord the Forerunner in that
[1:45:51] first fruits offering no doubt in the
[1:45:54] resurrection we know it's the truth
[1:45:56] we see brother Branham fulfilling that
[1:45:59] role as a wave Chief offering over his
[1:46:03] generation the first son to come to
[1:46:06] maturity and some people can't get past
[1:46:09] the fact that a son has already come to
[1:46:13] maturity and so they rally around the
[1:46:16] mature son from the past generation but
[1:46:19] God doesn't want you to lose sight of
[1:46:22] the reality that he didn't come to get
[1:46:25] one son
[1:46:26] he came to get many sons
[1:46:30] Hallelujah he came for all the Royal
[1:46:33] Seed of Abraham
[1:46:36] in bringing oh
[1:46:38] in bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:46:42] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:46:49] through sufferings
[1:46:51] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[1:46:56] who are sanctified
[1:47:00] or what
[1:47:02] isn't that what we were preaching here
[1:47:04] Tuesday night
[1:47:06] they're one
[1:47:08] he that does the sanctifying and he that
[1:47:11] is Sanctified joined together as one
[1:47:14] spirit
[1:47:15] they are all one
[1:47:17] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:47:21] call them
[1:47:26] you may be ashamed to be identified with
[1:47:29] me
[1:47:30] but he is not ashamed to be identified
[1:47:33] with you
[1:47:36] that means no matter what you've done
[1:47:40] no matter how unruly you have been
[1:47:43] no matter how out of the way you've been
[1:47:46] no matter how out of line you fail this
[1:47:49] week he is not ashamed
[1:47:52] to call you his own
[1:47:54] he is not ashamed because he that
[1:47:57] sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified
[1:48:00] are all
[1:48:01] of one may God add his Blessing to the
[1:48:05] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:48:06] this morning
[1:48:09] now I want you to go to Hebrews chapter
[1:48:11] 1.
[1:48:13] that was chapter 2.
[1:48:15] we read two we read 12 through 18
[1:48:19] Tuesday night we read 6 through 11 this
[1:48:22] morning and now we're going to read
[1:48:24] Hebrews 1 4 through 6. being made so
[1:48:29] much better
[1:48:30] than the angels
[1:48:33] as he hath by inheritance obtained
[1:48:38] a more excellent Name
[1:48:43] than they
[1:48:45] For unto which of the Angels said he had
[1:48:49] any time Thou Art my son
[1:48:53] this day have I begotten thee
[1:48:57] and again I will be to him a father
[1:49:00] and he shall be to me a son
[1:49:04] and again when he bringeth in the first
[1:49:08] begotten into the world he saith
[1:49:12] let all the angels of God worship Him
[1:49:19] verse 8.
[1:49:21] but unto the son he saith
[1:49:24] not to any of the Angels
[1:49:28] not to any of the four living creatures
[1:49:31] not to any of the Heavenly hosts of
[1:49:33] Heaven did he say anything like this
[1:49:38] he only said it to his son thy Throne o
[1:49:43] God is forever and ever a scepter of
[1:49:48] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[1:49:51] kingdom
[1:49:53] the father
[1:49:55] the eternal spirit of the father full of
[1:49:58] grace and truth has spoken
[1:50:02] to the condescended son
[1:50:05] who is the word made flesh don't be
[1:50:08] confused not to people
[1:50:11] only one person here two offices both
[1:50:16] God
[1:50:17] oh God
[1:50:18] is saying to God
[1:50:22] I didn't write this
[1:50:23] the first church each messenger wrote it
[1:50:26] but unto the son he saith thy Throne o
[1:50:30] God
[1:50:34] speaking to God
[1:50:36] thy Throne o God is forever and ever a
[1:50:40] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[1:50:43] of thy kingdom
[1:50:46] now I want you to know this is powerful
[1:50:48] language this morning the book of
[1:50:50] Hebrews is life to the bride
[1:50:53] you hear what I'm saying the book of
[1:50:55] Hebrews is life to the bride if you get
[1:50:58] a revelation of the book of Hebrews
[1:50:59] you'll get a revelation that you have
[1:51:02] already taken the promise
[1:51:05] so many are waiting to take the promise
[1:51:07] that they've already taken
[1:51:09] but they don't understand it because
[1:51:11] they haven't seen it in identification
[1:51:13] because they don't see the parallel
[1:51:16] between Hebrews and crossing over
[1:51:20] but Hebrews is our crossing over song
[1:51:23] it is the theme of our possessing the
[1:51:27] land and so let God speak to your heart
[1:51:30] from the book of Hebrews let God speak
[1:51:33] Revelation to your heart from the Hebrew
[1:51:36] series
[1:51:38] that brother Branham brought us because
[1:51:40] there is so much truth in that we have
[1:51:44] listened to some of those tapes in
[1:51:46] service as a congregation and there is
[1:51:50] so much life in that Hebrew series for
[1:51:53] you and I to take a hold of in this hour
[1:51:56] now I want to go back
[1:51:59] Hebrews chapter 4.
[1:52:04] we weren't there this morning already
[1:52:06] but we've been here
[1:52:08] and I want to get 14 through 16. well
[1:52:11] you're just reading scripture that's
[1:52:13] right
[1:52:14] would that hurt anybody's feelings
[1:52:17] seeing then
[1:52:19] that we have a great high priest
[1:52:25] that is passed into the heavens
[1:52:28] Jesus Yeshua the Son of God let us would
[1:52:34] you read that for me
[1:52:41] only a few of you can read
[1:52:44] can you all read
[1:52:46] how many of you can read in here let me
[1:52:48] see your hand
[1:52:49] let me hear you all read this let us
[1:52:55] oh it works so good when we do it
[1:52:57] together
[1:52:59] hold fast
[1:53:01] you can't Loosely embrace your
[1:53:05] profession
[1:53:07] you've got to grab a hold of their
[1:53:09] confession your profession you've got to
[1:53:12] hold to it
[1:53:15] no matter what's going on in your life
[1:53:17] no matter what Sands are sifting and
[1:53:20] shifting around you no matter what
[1:53:22] circumstances are bringing to your
[1:53:24] doorstep and dumping on your porch
[1:53:27] no matter how many boxes of rattlesnakes
[1:53:30] come with your name on it
[1:53:33] you can't listen to that you can't look
[1:53:36] to that you can't bemoan that
[1:53:39] you can't even talk about that
[1:53:43] because the more you talk about
[1:53:45] something the more you speak about
[1:53:47] something the bigger it becomes in your
[1:53:50] subconscious
[1:53:52] it becomes a block
[1:53:55] it becomes a reality the truth is a
[1:53:58] great portion of what we're saying about
[1:54:00] our problems aren't true anyway
[1:54:03] your back is not killing you
[1:54:09] it may make you feel like you'd rather
[1:54:11] die
[1:54:13] but your back is not killing you you are
[1:54:16] you may be hungry because I preached
[1:54:18] until two but you are not starving to
[1:54:21] death
[1:54:25] or we say it the hungrier we get oh I
[1:54:28] wish he'd shut up I'm so hungry okay
[1:54:30] don't say it
[1:54:32] don't think it
[1:54:34] when you think it you send signals to
[1:54:37] your body
[1:54:39] that says oh you're so hungry
[1:54:42] my look what you got waiting on you when
[1:54:44] you get home
[1:54:47] and you start salivating
[1:54:50] mouth all watery
[1:54:53] and you start anticipating all of that
[1:54:55] and you missed
[1:54:58] the word that was sent
[1:55:01] to get you through
[1:55:05] it's a truth
[1:55:07] it's the truth
[1:55:12] I'm going to hold that back but it's the
[1:55:14] truth
[1:55:17] we've got to consider that
[1:55:20] we have a great high priest that is
[1:55:22] passed into the heavens Jesus the son of
[1:55:25] God let us hold fast
[1:55:28] with everything that we've got hold on
[1:55:31] to our testimony
[1:55:33] hold on to our profession
[1:55:36] there is prophetic power
[1:55:39] in the testimony
[1:55:41] you don't have to feel guilty for
[1:55:43] reaching out for prayer support
[1:55:45] that's exactly what you should do
[1:55:48] if you want to reach to your pastor do
[1:55:51] it if you want to reach to someone else
[1:55:53] you have confidence in do it that's not
[1:55:55] complaining
[1:55:57] that's not doubting that's getting a
[1:56:00] little help for prayer prayer support
[1:56:03] that's not what I'm talking about but
[1:56:07] I'm talking about the way we talk about
[1:56:10] what's going on in our lives we we
[1:56:13] magnify it we we are creatures of
[1:56:16] exaggeration
[1:56:19] you don't just have to be a fisherman to
[1:56:21] be an exaggerator
[1:56:24] we just have a tendency to remember
[1:56:27] something bigger than it was and better
[1:56:29] than it was and how many times have you
[1:56:32] told somebody that was the best steak
[1:56:34] you ever ate in your life
[1:56:36] we have kings and queens of hyperbole
[1:56:39] around here
[1:56:43] and you've just got to come to realize
[1:56:45] that everybody don't like what you like
[1:56:49] and you know sometimes you go back the
[1:56:51] second time and guess what
[1:56:54] you realize that what nearly as good as
[1:56:56] you thought it was the first time
[1:56:58] it got magnified in your mind let me
[1:57:01] tell you something the more you talk
[1:57:03] about your problems the bigger they get
[1:57:05] the bigger they seem the harder to get
[1:57:08] over them it becomes
[1:57:10] we need to talk or talk about something
[1:57:12] all right we need to talk about our
[1:57:15] great high priest
[1:57:18] somebody ought to talk about our great
[1:57:20] High priests this morning that is passed
[1:57:23] into the heavens Jesus the son of God
[1:57:25] somebody ought to be busy holding on to
[1:57:28] your profession to your confession to
[1:57:31] your testimony
[1:57:33] amen for we do not have a high priest
[1:57:38] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:57:40] of our infirmities but was in
[1:57:45] uh-uh
[1:57:46] say it again all points
[1:57:52] All Points tempted as we are here is the
[1:57:56] Mighty Key
[1:57:58] yet
[1:57:59] without sin you said but that was Jesus
[1:58:04] yes but he was our example
[1:58:07] remember we reminded you Tuesday night
[1:58:09] he was 100 God
[1:58:13] and 100 man
[1:58:16] somebody said doesn't that make him 200
[1:58:18] percent no that's not God's mathematics
[1:58:22] he was both 100 God and 100 man there
[1:58:28] had never been another one like him
[1:58:32] there had never been a conception like
[1:58:34] his conception
[1:58:39] simarama said lied about it
[1:58:44] she was not she did not receive an
[1:58:46] Immaculate Conception
[1:58:49] she just wasn't a married woman she was
[1:58:51] a widow
[1:58:52] and she became pregnant with some man's
[1:58:55] baby
[1:58:56] and to keep her position as Queen in
[1:58:59] Babylon she she told this story
[1:59:03] she made it all spiritual
[1:59:06] and I think that's the part that vexes
[1:59:09] me the most it's the Christian world
[1:59:11] still celebrating a big old lie
[1:59:15] one that had nothing to do with the
[1:59:17] Virgin birth
[1:59:18] one that had nothing to do with a true
[1:59:21] son or a true God but all a fabricated
[1:59:24] lie when we have something so much more
[1:59:27] beautiful to celebrate here today we
[1:59:30] have a high priest who can be touched
[1:59:32] with the feeling of our infirmities who
[1:59:35] was at all points tempted even as we are
[1:59:39] just like we are yet without
[1:59:42] sin
[1:59:44] and I said to you Tuesday night
[1:59:46] everything we deal with on a personal or
[1:59:48] family level can be brought to the
[1:59:50] throne of grace and at this Throne or in
[1:59:53] this heavenly courtroom we can obtain
[1:59:55] mercy and we can find Grace to help in
[1:59:59] the time of need we must learn to come
[2:00:02] boldly before the throne of grace no
[2:00:04] shame no condemnation but filled with
[2:00:07] faith we are told that we have a high
[2:00:10] priest who is Jesus that is ever before
[2:00:13] the throne of grace on our behalf and
[2:00:17] look at what first John 1 9 says
[2:00:25] first John 1 9 if
[2:00:29] we confess our sins he is faithful
[2:00:40] go ahead
[2:00:47] all you got to do is confess it
[2:00:50] and he didn't say to the priest
[2:00:54] he tells us share our faults one with
[2:00:57] another he didn't tell us to confess our
[2:00:59] sins one to another
[2:01:02] you go tell the Lord
[2:01:07] you remember the couple that had young
[2:01:10] married couple that had committed
[2:01:11] adultery on one another is coming stood
[2:01:14] in that prayer line brother green was in
[2:01:17] the service brother Branham called out
[2:01:20] their sin
[2:01:23] he said what about you
[2:01:27] God begins to reveal that woman's sin
[2:01:30] and the Man Comes tearing down there
[2:01:32] gonna you know I don't know I don't know
[2:01:35] if he's going to snatch the woman out or
[2:01:36] if he's going to punch brother random
[2:01:40] I don't know who he was matter at
[2:01:42] he comes running down there and brother
[2:01:44] Brandon turned and said well what about
[2:01:46] you and your secretary the other night
[2:01:47] Friday night on the railroad track
[2:01:51] well what do you do about that
[2:01:54] brother random set now you going back
[2:01:56] here behind this curtain and you confess
[2:01:59] this to one another because you've
[2:02:01] sinned against one another
[2:02:04] you get back there behind that curtain
[2:02:06] and make that right and the Lord will
[2:02:08] forgive you
[2:02:11] we need a supernatural year like that
[2:02:16] we need so much of the Holy Ghost in
[2:02:19] here
[2:02:30] in the message
[2:02:31] if God be with us then where is all the
[2:02:34] Miracles
[2:02:37] December the 31st in the evening 1961
[2:02:40] you don't have this
[2:02:43] he said this is one thing I desire to do
[2:02:47] one of my desires is to see a church
[2:02:50] without spot or without wrinkle
[2:02:55] that the Holy Spirit brother Graham that
[2:02:58] has been the longing of my heart
[2:03:00] to see a church that's so filled with
[2:03:04] God until sin can't abide in it anywhere
[2:03:12] the spirit of God calling it right out
[2:03:16] wherever it is
[2:03:20] he said I want to see that
[2:03:24] that is a supernatural Church
[2:03:27] it should not be our desire this morning
[2:03:30] to see our brothers and sisters
[2:03:32] embarrassed
[2:03:35] amen that's not what brother random is
[2:03:37] talking about
[2:03:38] but it should be our desire that God by
[2:03:42] the word by the Holy Ghost by the
[2:03:45] supernatural presence of God be so real
[2:03:48] in this house that if you should come in
[2:03:51] here with an unconfessed sin God would
[2:03:55] immediately put his finger on your heart
[2:03:57] and you would have to repent you would
[2:04:00] be compelled you would be driven to say
[2:04:04] Lord let me make that right
[2:04:07] so much so that you would be afraid to
[2:04:11] come and praise
[2:04:14] I taught you Tuesday night come praise
[2:04:16] anyway that's right I mean it
[2:04:18] you praise anyway because you know who
[2:04:20] you are both he that sanctify us and he
[2:04:24] who is Sanctified is one
[2:04:27] so you know who you are but I want you
[2:04:29] to know you come up here raise your
[2:04:31] hands and get in that presence and let
[2:04:34] that Supernatural power of God come upon
[2:04:36] you and you'd say who shall Ascend the
[2:04:39] hill of the Lord
[2:04:40] but he that hath Clean Hands and a pure
[2:04:43] heart and you'd say Lord I confess my
[2:04:45] sin my unbelief in the attributes of my
[2:04:48] unbelief I confess that pornography I
[2:04:51] confess that I am confessed that
[2:04:53] encounter I confess that I lay that out
[2:04:55] before you Lord and this is what you
[2:04:58] need to know about it if we confess our
[2:05:01] sins we don't confess them so that we
[2:05:03] can get a license to go do it again we
[2:05:06] confess it so that we can be free from
[2:05:08] it
[2:05:09] [Applause]
[2:05:11] so we don't have to deal with that
[2:05:13] unbelief anymore
[2:05:15] come on
[2:05:17] because listen we're fixing to have to
[2:05:19] deal with many external pressures
[2:05:24] so we don't want to have to spend the
[2:05:26] rest of our year dealing with all the
[2:05:28] internal pressure
[2:05:29] we want to get the internal situation
[2:05:33] settled so that we can stand strong
[2:05:37] under the persecution or under the
[2:05:39] squeeze of our government and Under The
[2:05:42] Squeeze of violence and Under The
[2:05:44] Squeeze of threat and whatever else the
[2:05:47] bride will see before she gets out of
[2:05:50] here we don't want to have to deal with
[2:05:52] our internal issues all the time be
[2:05:55] burdened down trying to get over that
[2:05:59] you don't want to have to spend all your
[2:06:01] time trying to get over your jealousy
[2:06:05] you want to get all that settled
[2:06:08] so that you can be strong in in in the
[2:06:12] you know if you if you get weary
[2:06:15] if the horsemen in the footman wear you
[2:06:17] out what are you going to do when the
[2:06:19] Jordan swales
[2:06:21] come on you're going to need more of God
[2:06:23] when the swelling of the Jordan is
[2:06:25] around you isn't that what the scripture
[2:06:27] said God is faithful and just I want you
[2:06:30] to see that in fact I want you to read
[2:06:32] it to me he is
[2:06:35] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[2:06:39] he's faithful and just faithful speaks
[2:06:42] about his covenant-keeping nature
[2:06:45] he will be true to this Covenant that he
[2:06:48] made with us through the blood of the
[2:06:51] body of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:53] a covenant is a legal binding contract
[2:06:57] for either of the parties involved to
[2:07:00] fail to carry out their contracted
[2:07:03] details and requirements as outlined in
[2:07:05] the legal agreement it can render
[2:07:08] the remainder of the agreed terms both
[2:07:12] null and void
[2:07:15] I won't talk to you about that just a
[2:07:17] moment
[2:07:18] have you ever broke your Covenant with
[2:07:20] the Lord
[2:07:21] let me see you let me see you let me see
[2:07:24] you have you ever broke your Covenant
[2:07:26] with the Lord sure we have
[2:07:29] if you chose anything but his
[2:07:32] righteousness
[2:07:35] now doesn't it seem like them that the
[2:07:38] whole thing would be null and void
[2:07:40] legally it would be
[2:07:42] but God couldn't allow that to happen
[2:07:46] he wrote a fixed contract
[2:07:51] he rigged a contract
[2:07:55] he didn't write a contract that can be
[2:07:57] held to the standards of American law
[2:08:00] he wrote one bigger than that
[2:08:03] he said both He Who sanctifies
[2:08:06] and he who is Saint divide is one
[2:08:14] that means in the eyes of God you could
[2:08:17] no more null and void the contract than
[2:08:20] he could
[2:08:22] Man look
[2:08:25] because she is him
[2:08:29] because the bride is the blood of Christ
[2:08:34] that's what the word said
[2:08:36] she is the blood of Christ it's like
[2:08:40] Jesus saying here they're going to throw
[2:08:42] the law of Moses into him
[2:08:46] and he said I am
[2:08:51] he'd already told him on Mount Sonya I
[2:08:54] am that I am
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:08:59] I'm everything
[2:09:01] somebody said he's a to z that's not
[2:09:04] nearly big enough that confines him to
[2:09:06] the restraints of a language he's bigger
[2:09:09] than a language he's bigger than Hebrew
[2:09:11] he's bigger than English he's bigger
[2:09:13] than French he's bigger than Spanish
[2:09:16] oh he's from eternity to Eternity
[2:09:20] and even you're breaking your vow cannot
[2:09:25] know and void the contract
[2:09:28] because you have become one with the
[2:09:33] testator
[2:09:35] you have become one with him
[2:09:40] now if that makes you want to be
[2:09:42] spiritually lazy you're not hearing this
[2:09:44] with a revelation you're hearing it with
[2:09:46] a head knowledge when I hear this it
[2:09:49] doesn't make me want to see what I can
[2:09:50] do to be more like the world
[2:09:53] it doesn't make me want to pursue the
[2:09:55] things of life in the world anymore it
[2:09:57] makes me want to run to Jesus with
[2:09:59] everything I've got and say Lord oh papa
[2:10:04] look what you did
[2:10:07] you required so much of me and then you
[2:10:12] stepped out and became all that was
[2:10:15] required of me
[2:10:18] he who is joined in the Lord
[2:10:22] the Lord is one spirit
[2:10:25] with him
[2:10:26] why don't you say Amen
[2:10:30] somebody said you're getting a look here
[2:10:31] yeah
[2:10:33] yeah
[2:10:34] because I can't even mess this up
[2:10:42] when I do
[2:10:44] he sends Holy Spirit
[2:10:52] why do you think he needed three offices
[2:10:54] to finish this work
[2:10:57] why couldn't he have just done it all as
[2:10:59] a father
[2:11:02] seems to me like he could have just done
[2:11:03] it all as a father oh no
[2:11:05] then he couldn't have been a high priest
[2:11:09] foreign
[2:11:11] spirit in the heavenlies and been a high
[2:11:15] priest he had to come down here
[2:11:17] so he needed at least a second office
[2:11:20] anybody with me he had to come down here
[2:11:22] in flesh live among people just like him
[2:11:26] to be tempted even as they were tempted
[2:11:28] in all manner so that he could be a pure
[2:11:30] and perfect high priest and mediator and
[2:11:33] and recompense and Reconciliation and
[2:11:35] propitiation for their sin
[2:11:38] he became all of that
[2:11:40] and then he realized
[2:11:42] in the beginning that those who he had
[2:11:45] made Covenant with would fail him
[2:11:49] again and again and again
[2:11:52] everybody's on about Adam and Eve and
[2:11:54] their failure well I want you to know we
[2:11:57] don't have any guarantee that they
[2:11:59] didn't fail him again
[2:12:02] and we just read a book of failures you
[2:12:05] ever read this Bible
[2:12:07] it's a book full of crack pots
[2:12:11] it's a book full of murderers
[2:12:14] adulterers all all believers
[2:12:18] cheaters gamblers
[2:12:21] usurpers
[2:12:23] anybody here
[2:12:25] and yet God used every one of them
[2:12:28] he had a plan
[2:12:29] he had a purpose he did not look for
[2:12:33] Perfect People
[2:12:35] he needed the people that were not
[2:12:37] perfect so that he could sin the Holy
[2:12:39] Ghost into their lives and make them
[2:12:43] perfect
[2:12:47] yes so we need at least two father and
[2:12:52] son
[2:12:53] but he knew that you and I would mess up
[2:12:55] again
[2:12:57] and again and again and again so he said
[2:12:58] I'll tell you what I'll do I'll just put
[2:13:00] myself in them
[2:13:02] I loved him enough to come from the
[2:13:04] balconies of heaven and walk among them
[2:13:06] and bleed and die be tempted first and
[2:13:09] then bleed and die and resurrect on
[2:13:11] their behalf but I'll go one more than
[2:13:12] that because when I leave this world I
[2:13:15] know they're going to be tempted
[2:13:18] to trust me one minute and doubt me the
[2:13:21] next
[2:13:23] I know life is going to squeeze them
[2:13:25] here and shove them there and place them
[2:13:27] over Yonder so what I will do is I won't
[2:13:30] just be a God above them and I won't
[2:13:32] just be a god with them but I'll come
[2:13:34] right down and be a god living in them
[2:13:36] somebody help me
[2:13:39] somebody said well we know all of this
[2:13:41] yeah maybe
[2:13:43] maybe we do
[2:13:45] maybe we don't
[2:13:47] so this Covenant cannot be rendered null
[2:13:51] and void because of your failure
[2:13:54] because the holy spirit in you'll just
[2:13:56] start crying out on your behalf so you
[2:13:58] still have an intercessor
[2:14:00] you still have an intercessor
[2:14:04] the Holy Ghost just says oh oh papa
[2:14:08] look what a mess he made again
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:13] may I just remind you
[2:14:16] that to condemned him would be to
[2:14:19] condemn yourself
[2:14:23] to banish him would be to banished elf
[2:14:28] to cut him off would be to cut off
[2:14:30] yourself so the Holy Spirit somehow I
[2:14:33] don't think he's probably really
[2:14:34] screaming to the father Etc I don't want
[2:14:36] you get too confused in the process of
[2:14:38] me but but he but I
[2:14:40] I don't think that's too far off because
[2:14:43] sometimes I can't intercede for myself
[2:14:45] because I'm so low I'm so ashamed I'm so
[2:14:48] burdened I'm so weighted down by my own
[2:14:51] failure that I can't even call out to
[2:14:54] God on my behalf anybody ever been there
[2:14:56] you just want to sit numb
[2:15:00] so disappointed in your reaction that
[2:15:03] you can't even say immediately Lord help
[2:15:05] me
[2:15:06] anybody ever been there I'm the only one
[2:15:07] I can tell I'm the only one
[2:15:10] well don't worry
[2:15:11] because the Holy Ghost is already crying
[2:15:13] out on your behalf the holy spirit of
[2:15:16] God in you is already making
[2:15:18] intercession for you with groanings that
[2:15:20] cannot be uttered
[2:15:22] the spirit of God is already calling out
[2:15:24] on your behalf whether you realize it or
[2:15:26] not and he's probably got to Watchmen
[2:15:28] somewhere already crawling out in your
[2:15:31] on your behalf there are intercessors
[2:15:34] who cooperate with the Holy Spirit
[2:15:37] I'll show you Hebrews chapter 3
[2:15:40] . we're just covering one two three and
[2:15:43] four aren't we Hebrews chapter 3.
[2:15:49] verse one and two wherefore holy
[2:15:51] brethren
[2:15:53] holy
[2:15:56] holy
[2:15:59] is Joshua in here Joshua bring me this
[2:16:01] stew I'm sorry to do this to you
[2:16:08] when I turn is it up here
[2:16:10] when I turn a certain way I can't
[2:16:13] wherefore holy brethren
[2:16:16] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[2:16:19] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[2:16:25] our profession Christ Jesus thank you
[2:16:37] oh just a moment just give God praise
[2:16:40] it'll be all right Hallelujah
[2:16:43] Hallelujah
[2:16:46] Glory
[2:16:53] what's that I don't think that'll help
[2:16:55] me
[2:16:57] it's nerve
[2:17:03] any good
[2:17:13] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[2:17:18] Heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[2:17:21] and high priest of our profession Christ
[2:17:24] Jesus who was faithful to him that
[2:17:28] appointed him
[2:17:31] as also Moses was faithful
[2:17:34] in all his house
[2:17:37] holy Brethren I want you to look at the
[2:17:39] one next to you you're my holy Brethren
[2:17:41] I know it's plural but say it anyway
[2:17:49] you ought to turn to him and say
[2:17:51] sometimes you make me so mad
[2:17:55] I could knock your block off
[2:17:58] but you are my holy brethren
[2:18:06] sometimes I get so disappointed in you
[2:18:08] I'd like to trade you in
[2:18:11] but you are my holy brethren
[2:18:17] absolutely
[2:18:19] you are my holy Brethren and the reason
[2:18:23] you are holy
[2:18:27] it's not because you always
[2:18:31] kept the rules
[2:18:33] I don't like the way the modern Church
[2:18:35] talks about conviction as though there
[2:18:37] is none there better be some
[2:18:40] and they just call all conviction rules
[2:18:42] I don't like to do that I think the most
[2:18:45] awful spirit in the world is the is the
[2:18:48] spirit that's opposed I used to preach
[2:18:50] in the charismatics because they're
[2:18:52] always talking about the religious
[2:18:54] spirit well what they mean is Holiness
[2:18:56] people
[2:18:57] you skirt wearing people you know you
[2:19:00] women and you you're you're religious
[2:19:02] that's why you do it you're religious
[2:19:05] but you know the ugliest Spirit I've
[2:19:07] ever met was not the religious and I've
[2:19:09] met I've met a lot of religious people
[2:19:11] I've pastored so
[2:19:14] I've met a lot of religious people but
[2:19:16] the uglier Spirit to me was the one who
[2:19:19] religiously opposed the religious spirit
[2:19:22] that was about the filthiest spirit I
[2:19:24] ever saw
[2:19:26] they would religiously
[2:19:30] legislatively opposed pose the religious
[2:19:33] spirit
[2:19:34] so constant so consistent until it got
[2:19:38] ugly and what that will produce is a
[2:19:41] perversion that you don't want any part
[2:19:42] of
[2:19:43] so there's a difference between keeping
[2:19:46] rules and regulations and believing that
[2:19:49] that is the source of your salvation
[2:19:52] the Bible tells us that we are not saved
[2:19:55] by works lest any man should boast it is
[2:19:58] the gift of God it's by the grace and
[2:20:01] mercy of God that we are saved we
[2:20:04] understand that but we also know that
[2:20:06] our faith is demonstrated by the works
[2:20:10] that we do
[2:20:12] amen dead Faith produces dead works but
[2:20:17] living faith will produce living works
[2:20:20] So You Are Holy Because He Lives in You
[2:20:25] and I showed you that I've taught you
[2:20:27] that it's not your hair
[2:20:29] that makes you holy
[2:20:32] I believe a woman should have long hair
[2:20:34] it's a glory to her it's power and
[2:20:36] authority on her head
[2:20:40] I believe the spirit that causes a woman
[2:20:42] to want to do other than that when the
[2:20:44] New Testament teaches its importance
[2:20:46] there's something wrong
[2:20:49] much much bigger than a hair bob
[2:20:54] amen
[2:20:56] but you must not believe that that alone
[2:21:00] because there are women out there that
[2:21:03] will live all kinds of prostitutes
[2:21:06] who have long hair to attract men who
[2:21:09] like long hair
[2:21:10] so that hair in itself
[2:21:13] to every woman is not a covenant to
[2:21:16] Every Woman it is not a Nazarite vow to
[2:21:19] Every Woman it does not bring power on
[2:21:21] her head and give her Authority because
[2:21:24] of the Angels right it's only to those
[2:21:28] who have surrendered their lives to the
[2:21:30] Lord so it's not that that makes you
[2:21:32] holy
[2:21:34] it's because he lives in you
[2:21:37] I told you many times there was a a
[2:21:40] mountain full of ordinary bushes
[2:21:42] there wasn't a holy Bush on the mountain
[2:21:44] until the fire of God fell on it and
[2:21:47] then it become a holy Bush and the
[2:21:49] ground around it became Holy Ground come
[2:21:52] on Moses had made that trail many many
[2:21:55] times and that ground had never been
[2:21:57] Holy Ground and that bush had never been
[2:21:59] a holy Bush but you put God on it you
[2:22:02] put the Holiness of God on something and
[2:22:04] it becomes holy Brethren you put the
[2:22:07] Holiness of God on a church and they
[2:22:09] become holy brethren
[2:22:12] you put the Holiness of God on a church
[2:22:14] and they become Saints
[2:22:19] not in the Catholic sense in the New
[2:22:21] Testament biblical sins
[2:22:24] that word partakers let me see that
[2:22:26] verse again verse 1 wherefore holy
[2:22:29] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[2:22:32] calling partakers
[2:22:34] that word partaker in the Greek means
[2:22:37] sharing
[2:22:39] participating in
[2:22:42] as in a business agreement
[2:22:46] or contract
[2:22:51] you are partaking
[2:22:54] of the Heavenly calling
[2:22:57] you have been called
[2:23:00] with a high calling
[2:23:05] you may be living
[2:23:07] low beneath your calling
[2:23:10] but you have been called with a high and
[2:23:14] Heavenly calling and you have been made
[2:23:18] you have been made a participator A
[2:23:22] partaker in that Heavenly calling he did
[2:23:26] that on our behalf and that calling that
[2:23:29] word calling in the Greek is an
[2:23:31] invitation to experience a special
[2:23:34] privilege and responsibility
[2:23:37] an invitation
[2:23:40] how many of you are thankful for that
[2:23:45] now in the message hidden life with
[2:23:47] Christ Minneapolis Minnesota can I have
[2:23:50] a few more minutes
[2:23:52] it depends in paragraph 23 it depends
[2:23:57] on where your faith stands
[2:24:03] foreign
[2:24:07] how much Faith you got to have
[2:24:10] a measure
[2:24:14] to every man is given
[2:24:18] a measure
[2:24:21] somebody said I just wish my loved ones
[2:24:24] could have enough Faith to be saved
[2:24:25] doesn't take a lot of faith
[2:24:28] it just takes the measure that God gave
[2:24:30] you in the beginning that Faith just has
[2:24:32] to be turned in the right direction and
[2:24:34] you have to be willing to see your need
[2:24:37] and when you pray for your loved ones if
[2:24:39] you're praying for God to save them
[2:24:40] you're wasting breath I wouldn't pray
[2:24:42] such a prayer as that you're wasting
[2:24:44] your breath God saved my loved ones what
[2:24:46] would you like for him to do come again
[2:24:49] would you like for him to be born in a
[2:24:51] manger again would you like for him to
[2:24:53] die on a cross again would you is it
[2:24:56] necessary that he be resurrected from
[2:24:58] the dead again didn't he do it once and
[2:25:00] for all
[2:25:01] hasn't he done everything that he needs
[2:25:03] to do to save your loved ones so the
[2:25:06] problem is not God save my loved ones
[2:25:08] the problem is Lord let my loved ones
[2:25:10] see their need
[2:25:12] [Applause]
[2:25:13] if they can only see their need
[2:25:18] and I want to say something sometimes
[2:25:21] they can't see their need because we
[2:25:24] keep bailing them out
[2:25:30] we keep helping them out
[2:25:33] we keep getting guilted
[2:25:36] into helping them out
[2:25:39] when God is trying to squeeze them into
[2:25:42] seeing their need
[2:25:48] that is so good
[2:25:54] it is so true
[2:25:56] we think that we're doing them we think
[2:25:58] we're going to give them gifts and and
[2:26:01] make them want Jesus we think we're
[2:26:03] going to do this or that and the other
[2:26:04] and make them want Jesus that's not
[2:26:06] going to make them want Jesus
[2:26:09] they need to hit the brick wall
[2:26:15] it'll take that but I'm telling you for
[2:26:18] some people
[2:26:19] yeah
[2:26:21] that's the reason we don't pray whatever
[2:26:22] it takes save them
[2:26:24] you don't have to tell God how to get
[2:26:26] their attention he already knows how and
[2:26:29] he knows some all it will take is a
[2:26:31] brick wall boom
[2:26:33] and they'll say oh Jesus
[2:26:36] there was people all up and down that
[2:26:38] Highway last night where the when the
[2:26:39] cloud the fog Cloud dropped in in 20 or
[2:26:42] 30. I don't know I didn't get the total
[2:26:43] some people said 23 somebody said I
[2:26:45] counted 23 Vehicles ran into one another
[2:26:49] right out there in front of the
[2:26:50] apartments across from Shadowood
[2:26:54] 20 or 30 vehicles
[2:26:57] three people injured I think somebody
[2:26:59] said could have been could have been
[2:27:01] hundred
[2:27:03] I suspect that some of them had come
[2:27:05] from one party on their way to a next
[2:27:10] that blanket of fog dropped down and I
[2:27:12] don't doubt it because it was thick this
[2:27:14] morning when I got up
[2:27:15] when the sun was coming up it was still
[2:27:17] thick out there wasn't it but they said
[2:27:20] it was it was one minute not there in
[2:27:21] the next minute just dropped right down
[2:27:23] on top of them I suspect there were
[2:27:25] people in many of those cars upon impact
[2:27:27] calling on God
[2:27:31] I suspect many of them said Jesus Lord
[2:27:33] help us oh God
[2:27:37] no preacher to preach to them
[2:27:39] all it took was a little bit of trouble
[2:27:44] sometimes you absolutely need to pray
[2:27:47] Lord let them see their need
[2:27:52] in other words you will participate with
[2:27:55] God's covenant plan by getting out of
[2:27:57] God's way and letting God do what he
[2:27:59] needs to do you know the truth is we
[2:28:02] could save a lot of time with prayer
[2:28:03] requests around here
[2:28:06] foreign
[2:28:08] if we just let God be God
[2:28:12] I don't mean quit praying
[2:28:15] I mean pray the right way
[2:28:17] it depends on where your faith stands
[2:28:20] your salvation is good
[2:28:24] as long as
[2:28:27] I'm dying
[2:28:31] nobody loves me everybody hates me I
[2:28:35] think I'll eat worms I don't even belong
[2:28:37] in that church I don't even belong in my
[2:28:39] family
[2:28:40] I'm the black sheep
[2:28:45] you're you're not saved
[2:28:49] not according to that
[2:28:51] I don't mean to judge you I mean disturb
[2:28:54] you
[2:28:54] your salvation is good as long as your
[2:28:58] confession is good
[2:29:00] and how many of you know your confession
[2:29:02] is not to be based upon your performance
[2:29:06] your confession must be based upon your
[2:29:09] sacrifice
[2:29:10] [Applause]
[2:29:12] my lamb is good
[2:29:14] my love is good my lamb is good
[2:29:19] good my family
[2:29:22] my church don't want me but my lamb is
[2:29:25] good my boss don't want me but my lamb
[2:29:28] is good
[2:29:29] so my confession is going to be good
[2:29:34] it matters what you say because what you
[2:29:38] say is what you're thinking he said but
[2:29:40] when your confession drops I'm just you
[2:29:43] know okay maybe you don't believe
[2:29:45] but when your confession drops your
[2:29:48] salvation's gone
[2:29:51] now we know we don't lose our Redemption
[2:29:55] but we can absolutely bring ourselves
[2:29:58] out from under the blessing
[2:30:02] we can put ourselves under permissive
[2:30:04] will and out of perfect will and it
[2:30:06] Alters everything
[2:30:08] did you know your life is laid out in
[2:30:10] the mind of God as two paths
[2:30:15] perfect and permissive
[2:30:17] he's got a plan for both
[2:30:19] he's got a plan for doing it his way and
[2:30:22] a plan for doing it your way and if you
[2:30:24] choose to do it your way you drop down
[2:30:26] into that plan
[2:30:28] and you won't be blessed like you're
[2:30:29] blessed in his will
[2:30:31] there's a perfect plan there's a high
[2:30:33] calling come on if you want to if you
[2:30:36] want your 2023 to be more you know
[2:30:39] better but more prosperous more blessing
[2:30:42] than your 2022 come on up
[2:30:46] make a choice to get out of his
[2:30:48] permissive will and into his perfect
[2:30:50] will quit robbing God
[2:30:54] quit robbing god with your tide quit
[2:30:56] robbing god with your time quit robbing
[2:30:59] god with your affection come on up into
[2:31:02] that perfect life
[2:31:04] it's called the ascended life you can
[2:31:06] live a lower life that's permissive will
[2:31:08] or you can live a perfect life yes an
[2:31:11] ascended life that's perfect will I mean
[2:31:14] I said perfect I meant permissive down
[2:31:16] here perfect is up here and they run
[2:31:18] parallel and they're both in the mind of
[2:31:20] God so don't be confused
[2:31:22] they're both in the mind of God
[2:31:25] he sees you when you step away he
[2:31:27] doesn't panic he says I already got it
[2:31:30] covered
[2:31:34] it's covered
[2:31:35] he knows exactly what's going to happen
[2:31:37] he knows exactly what you're going to
[2:31:39] choose
[2:31:42] for he is a high priest are you with me
[2:31:44] for he is a high priest setting some of
[2:31:47] your word about me sitting down
[2:31:49] you're thinking that'll give me another
[2:31:50] three hours or more
[2:31:53] for he is a high priest setting
[2:31:56] setting at the right hand of God
[2:32:00] [Music]
[2:32:03] you don't even need me
[2:32:06] if we heard enough of these tapes
[2:32:09] you wouldn't even need me
[2:32:13] for he is a high priest
[2:32:16] sitting at the right hand of God to make
[2:32:18] intercessions and what are those
[2:32:20] intercessions based on
[2:32:22] some of us are in trouble
[2:32:26] because if the lamb is interceding
[2:32:29] before the father with what we've been
[2:32:32] saying
[2:32:33] [Music]
[2:32:34] no wonder we're not getting the full
[2:32:36] benefit
[2:32:44] he cannot pronounce something before the
[2:32:46] father that you're not pronouncing
[2:32:48] he cannot confess something that you're
[2:32:51] not confessing look brother bam didn't
[2:32:53] say this one time he said this dozens of
[2:32:55] times
[2:32:57] for he is a high priest at the right
[2:32:59] hand of God to make intercession on your
[2:33:01] confession that's what happens
[2:33:04] in the message at Thy word Lord I'll let
[2:33:07] down the net Johnson City New York
[2:33:11] December the 7th paragraph 47.
[2:33:14] brother Branham said for God can only
[2:33:18] save you as you testify
[2:33:23] the prophetic power
[2:33:25] of a testimony
[2:33:27] well I just get so aggravated at my
[2:33:30] church because they just don't have
[2:33:31] testimony Services all the time
[2:33:34] I just wished I could testify in church
[2:33:37] more
[2:33:39] we have abused the privilege
[2:33:44] I love testimonies
[2:33:47] but we have abused the privilege
[2:33:50] we spend most of our time telling how
[2:33:52] hard it is to testify
[2:33:56] I'm not a public speaker then sit down
[2:34:00] come on that's not the father don't you
[2:34:03] know you're what you testified to is
[2:34:06] what he testified
[2:34:11] and then the next phrase is if I were to
[2:34:13] give one last night we'd had to watch
[2:34:15] tonight's service and somebody said oh
[2:34:17] I'm so thankful to God this horrible
[2:34:20] year is over
[2:34:25] but I'm sheltered I'm clothed and I'm
[2:34:29] fed
[2:34:30] isn't that enough
[2:34:33] did you starve in 2022
[2:34:36] did you have to go naked in 2022
[2:34:42] did you have a roof over your head in
[2:34:44] 2022
[2:34:46] then then 2022 wasn't a year from hell
[2:34:51] 2022 was a year from heaven
[2:34:54] and you got exactly what you confessed
[2:34:59] Oh I thought that would really get us
[2:35:03] I thought that would bug us down
[2:35:09] it's sovereignty or it's not
[2:35:14] for God can only save you as you testify
[2:35:16] he can only heal you as you testify he
[2:35:19] is so it's not your testimony in here
[2:35:21] that's going to matter the most
[2:35:24] it's your testimony out there and it's
[2:35:27] your testimony before him
[2:35:32] well are we guilty of complaining to our
[2:35:34] sinner family
[2:35:36] do we get around our sinner family and
[2:35:38] tell them how horrible life is
[2:35:41] how hard it is to adjust
[2:35:45] if you do no wonder they don't want what
[2:35:48] you got because they got the same
[2:35:49] troubles you got what if you got this so
[2:35:52] much better than what they got
[2:35:56] you need to tell them whose hands you're
[2:35:58] in
[2:35:58] [Music]
[2:36:00] oh that's good
[2:36:02] he said he is sitting at the right hand
[2:36:04] of the father tonight to make
[2:36:05] intercession upon your profession it
[2:36:09] isn't how loud you cry how hard you beat
[2:36:11] the altar how many Good Deeds you do
[2:36:14] it's your
[2:36:18] it's your faith that saves you
[2:36:20] and it's not just your faith in the good
[2:36:22] time
[2:36:24] it's your faith in the hard time
[2:36:26] and he said if you'll confess with your
[2:36:30] lips
[2:36:32] coming from your heart
[2:36:35] he goes to work as a high priest sitting
[2:36:37] at the right hand of the father to make
[2:36:39] intercession upon your confession
[2:36:40] Hebrews 3 and 1. he cannot do one thing
[2:36:43] for you he cannot do one thing for you
[2:36:45] he cannot do one thing for you he cannot
[2:36:48] do one thing for you he cannot do one
[2:36:51] thing for you until first you believe it
[2:36:53] and accept it and confess it to be so
[2:36:55] you are a partaker you are a participant
[2:36:59] in this Covenant
[2:37:02] you must be an active participator in
[2:37:05] this Covenant we must believe it accept
[2:37:09] it and confess it to be so
[2:37:15] and the people today they'll go out and
[2:37:16] say well I felt better last night but
[2:37:18] today I'm so bad I just can't hardly
[2:37:21] stand it oh my
[2:37:22] God
[2:37:25] oh I wasn't coughing last night but I'm
[2:37:28] coughing today about to cough my head
[2:37:30] off
[2:37:34] you're gonna look mighty funny
[2:37:38] but today I'm so bad I just can't hardly
[2:37:41] stand it he said that's just exactly
[2:37:43] when you lose your confession and drop
[2:37:47] right down
[2:37:50] with his stripes with his stripes with
[2:37:54] his stripes with his stripes with his
[2:37:58] stripes we hear your symptoms with his
[2:38:00] stripes with his stripes I feel my
[2:38:04] symptoms with his stripes with his
[2:38:07] stripes
[2:38:09] you don't want to lose your confession
[2:38:10] you don't want to drop right down below
[2:38:13] faith
[2:38:16] let's go on
[2:38:18] no matter who you are how saintly how
[2:38:21] Godly you are you're a minister
[2:38:22] clergymen or you're a deacon or whatever
[2:38:25] you are or you've been a Christian for
[2:38:27] 50 years if you go out of here tomorrow
[2:38:29] and lose faith that you're a Christian
[2:38:31] and start telling people you're not a
[2:38:34] Christian anymore you're backslid you're
[2:38:36] gone
[2:38:38] only by your confession can you be saved
[2:38:43] that's the most powerful weapon that God
[2:38:45] put in the hand of a man
[2:38:46] is a committal and that's done in the
[2:38:49] heart and a confession that's done with
[2:38:51] the mouth and isn't that exactly what
[2:38:53] the Bible said with the heart with the
[2:38:55] heart confession is made
[2:38:57] with uh no what's it what's the
[2:38:59] scripture
[2:39:00] uh
[2:39:02] give me that scripture with a heart man
[2:39:06] believeth
[2:39:07] where the heart man believeth but with
[2:39:09] the mouth confession is made let's find
[2:39:11] that and read it
[2:39:13] I'm sorry
[2:39:15] with the heart man believeth that may
[2:39:18] not be right
[2:39:21] for with the heart
[2:39:24] for with the heart man believeth unto
[2:39:27] righteousness and with the mouth
[2:39:29] confession is made unto salvation your
[2:39:33] heart in your mouth have got to be in
[2:39:34] line don't they they will be out of the
[2:39:36] abundance out of the Overflow of the
[2:39:38] heart the mouth speaketh your mouth
[2:39:40] doesn't always say what your heart says
[2:39:42] it's only when the heart gets full
[2:39:45] if the heart gets full of bitterness
[2:39:47] guess what you're going to talk about
[2:39:48] bitterness if your heart gets full of
[2:39:51] jealousy you're going to say jealous
[2:39:52] words but if your heart gets full of the
[2:39:54] word of God in the truth and the and the
[2:39:56] plan of and message of Salvation and
[2:39:58] righteousness you're going to overflow
[2:40:00] with that and that's what the mouth is
[2:40:02] going to talk about for with the heart
[2:40:03] man believeth under righteousness and
[2:40:06] when the mouth confession is made unto
[2:40:08] salvation we've got to stop here soon
[2:40:12] now let's go back to our quote
[2:40:16] only by your confession can you be saved
[2:40:19] that's the most powerful uh weapon that
[2:40:22] God put in the hand of a man a man is a
[2:40:25] committal and a confession it'll do it
[2:40:26] every time if you'll believe it accept
[2:40:28] it on those basis and believe it and
[2:40:31] stay with it
[2:40:33] keep confessing it
[2:40:36] when you confess it you know what a lot
[2:40:38] of people look at symptoms they always
[2:40:40] go around and say well now I don't feel
[2:40:42] any better that doesn't have one thing
[2:40:45] to do with it it's what you believe not
[2:40:48] what you feel it's what you believe not
[2:40:53] what you feel didn't you read these
[2:40:54] quote yeah two years ago
[2:41:00] and if we'd got it all we wouldn't have
[2:41:03] to do any repeating would we but we
[2:41:05] don't get it all I don't get it all
[2:41:08] in the message right down here in Macon
[2:41:10] Georgia Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:41:13] today and forever
[2:41:15] paragraph six for he's the high priest
[2:41:18] of our confession Hebrews 3 or what we
[2:41:20] confess he's the high priest to make
[2:41:22] intercessions upon what we confess is
[2:41:24] the truth anything that was included oh
[2:41:27] my anything that was included in the
[2:41:30] atonement is the
[2:41:37] it's mine
[2:41:39] healing is mine wholeness is mine the
[2:41:44] victory is mine every part of the
[2:41:46] atonement is the personal property of
[2:41:48] every believer when a man gets saved or
[2:41:50] a woman boy or girl God gives them a
[2:41:52] checkbook as it was with Jesus name at
[2:41:54] the bottom of every check for anything
[2:41:56] Redemptive for anything Redemptive
[2:41:59] blessing for any Redemptive blessing
[2:42:02] that Jesus died for
[2:42:04] it's your personal property
[2:42:06] and look at that next line
[2:42:10] see what Factor Fear plays
[2:42:13] I'm afraid to ask big God told us to ask
[2:42:15] abundantly ask big
[2:42:19] we scratched the surface we ought to go
[2:42:21] deep right to the root of the thing
[2:42:22] don't be afraid to fill it out the
[2:42:24] prophet said the bank of heaven will
[2:42:26] recognize it
[2:42:28] oh that's good
[2:42:30] Jesus said whatsoever things you desire
[2:42:32] When you pray believe you receive it
[2:42:33] whatever you ask the father in my name
[2:42:35] that I will do the unlimited
[2:42:37] unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ in
[2:42:40] that promise do you know what's mine
[2:42:42] this morning do you know what's yours
[2:42:44] this morning the unlimited unsearchable
[2:42:46] Riches of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah are
[2:42:49] you with me that ought to answer some of
[2:42:51] your questions
[2:42:53] it's the word
[2:42:54] the unlimited unsearchable Riches of
[2:42:57] Jesus Christ in that promise
[2:43:02] Isaac Watts isn't he the one that wrote
[2:43:04] Joy to the World
[2:43:07] and he wrote that song when I surveyed
[2:43:09] the Wondrous Cross
[2:43:13] he wrote this hymn
[2:43:16] blood
[2:43:17] has a voice
[2:43:20] to pierce the skies
[2:43:22] Revenge
[2:43:24] the blood of Abel cries
[2:43:26] but the deer stream when Christ was
[2:43:29] slain
[2:43:30] speaks peace as loud
[2:43:34] from every vein
[2:43:36] pardon in peace from God on high behold
[2:43:41] he lays his Vengeance by and Rebels
[2:43:46] that deserved his sword become the
[2:43:49] favorites
[2:43:51] of the Lord
[2:43:55] I'm his favorite
[2:44:01] I'm going to read that line again pardon
[2:44:04] and peace from God on high behold he
[2:44:06] lays his Vengeance by and Rebels that
[2:44:09] deserved his sword become the favorites
[2:44:13] of the Lord
[2:44:14] one more one more refrain to Jesus let
[2:44:17] our Praises rise who gave his life a
[2:44:20] sacrifice now he appears before his God
[2:44:24] and for our pardon pleads his blood
[2:44:29] First Peter chapter 1. and we're going
[2:44:33] to close shortly
[2:44:34] First Peter chapter 1 verse 18 and 19
[2:44:37] for as much as ye know
[2:44:41] that ye were not redeemed
[2:44:45] with corruptable things
[2:44:49] as silver and gold did you know you
[2:44:51] could have all the silver and all the
[2:44:53] gold
[2:44:54] and be lost
[2:44:56] you can't buy your salvation with my
[2:44:59] money
[2:45:01] for as much as ye know that ye were not
[2:45:04] redeemed with corruptable things as
[2:45:07] silver and gold from your vain
[2:45:09] conversation received by tradition from
[2:45:12] your fathers verse 19 but with the
[2:45:16] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb
[2:45:20] without blemish and without spot look at
[2:45:24] what you were saved by look at what you
[2:45:26] were Redeemed by with the precious blood
[2:45:28] of Christ as of a lamb without blemish
[2:45:31] and without spot when we are invited to
[2:45:34] the throne of grace this is what we
[2:45:36] carry with us
[2:45:38] not our Good Deeds we carry the precious
[2:45:41] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[2:45:44] blemish and without spot are you still
[2:45:46] here good let me give you another quote
[2:45:49] and we might stop
[2:45:51] the future home of the Heavenly
[2:45:53] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[2:45:54] paragraph 145.
[2:45:57] you become
[2:45:59] a new person
[2:46:04] amen
[2:46:05] not just an old one patched up by
[2:46:08] joining Church
[2:46:10] are trying to turn a new page here we
[2:46:14] are
[2:46:14] New Year's Day
[2:46:18] but you are a complete brand new unit
[2:46:24] listen how brother bam describes this
[2:46:26] God takes the old man and burns him
[2:46:29] completely out
[2:46:34] what sins
[2:46:36] are you talking about
[2:46:39] I don't remember them anymore
[2:46:44] from The Book of Life they've all been
[2:46:47] torn out I don't remember them anymore
[2:46:54] and Satan says look at Shelley
[2:46:58] do you remember when do you remember
[2:47:00] when do you remember when and God says
[2:47:02] what sins are you talking about I don't
[2:47:07] remember them anymore
[2:47:10] from The Book of Life they've all been
[2:47:14] torn out I don't remember them anymore
[2:47:19] you're not just an old man patched up
[2:47:25] he turned over a new Leaf that ain't
[2:47:27] enough
[2:47:29] he made a New Year's resolution that
[2:47:32] ain't enough
[2:47:33] you're a complete brand new unit
[2:47:36] God takes the old man and burns him
[2:47:39] completely out with the Holy Ghost and
[2:47:42] Fire
[2:47:43] and comes himself
[2:47:45] sins down your representation
[2:47:53] yeah
[2:47:54] that's big
[2:47:58] that's what the Holy Ghost baptism is
[2:48:01] for
[2:48:02] he brings our representation to us
[2:48:07] next next phrase no man can come to me
[2:48:10] except my father has drawn him and all
[2:48:13] the father has given me will come to me
[2:48:15] you see it and the congregation says
[2:48:18] amen and he says same same plan same way
[2:48:24] the last paragraph 146 Satan was or will
[2:48:29] be taken from the earth just exactly
[2:48:31] like Satan was taken from you
[2:48:38] I had old Devils been running me around
[2:48:40] all week long
[2:48:44] that's not what I sing
[2:48:46] you know what I sing a lot around my
[2:48:48] house around my life in my office I had
[2:48:52] to tussle with the devil and I won
[2:48:55] you ever heard that old song
[2:48:57] I had to tussle about the television and
[2:49:02] I won
[2:49:09] I'm not gonna sing Satan's been running
[2:49:11] me around
[2:49:13] I'm gonna sing I've been running him
[2:49:15] around
[2:49:16] you know the devil has to work overtime
[2:49:19] to try to trick us
[2:49:24] he's working overtime
[2:49:28] you know where his distraction
[2:49:33] do you know this world would have been
[2:49:35] burned over a long time ago had it not
[2:49:37] been for you and I being here
[2:49:39] because the devil's pulling all the
[2:49:42] stops out trying to change you he can't
[2:49:44] get you you don't belong to him
[2:49:48] you never did belong to him and he will
[2:49:51] not give up he'll hear this message and
[2:49:53] won't give up
[2:49:54] he'll hear what I'm preaching today and
[2:49:56] won't give up he'll come at you all week
[2:49:59] long and you just tell him we may have a
[2:50:02] tussle devil but I'm going to win this
[2:50:04] thing
[2:50:05] cause I know Jesus is the victor
[2:50:09] [Applause]
[2:50:10] that's exactly like Satan was taken from
[2:50:13] you Satan cannot bother oh he contempt
[2:50:18] but that's all right because Jesus was
[2:50:20] in all manner but he cannot get a
[2:50:23] born-again Christian for God from the
[2:50:25] foundation of the world foresaw him and
[2:50:28] sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood
[2:50:32] and the blood and the blood

[2:53:55] ourselves lost every time we fail
[2:54:03] we hold on to him
[2:54:06] last last quote where musicians are
[2:54:08] coming
[2:54:10] 1955.
[2:54:15] paragraph 33.
[2:54:18] the message law
[2:54:22] this is so good
[2:54:36] now the blood
[2:54:39] could not be perfect
[2:54:41] by an animal
[2:54:44] but the blood in Christ was
[2:54:48] now I will never be perfect brother
[2:54:51] Branham
[2:54:52] and you will never be perfect
[2:54:56] I will never be perfect in your sight
[2:54:59] you will never be perfect in my sight
[2:55:03] brother brand I'm talking
[2:55:05] but let's lay that aside
[2:55:11] because none of that really matters
[2:55:13] whether you think I'm perfect or not or
[2:55:16] whether I think you're perfect or not
[2:55:17] whether I think you're worthy of this
[2:55:19] redemption or whether you think I'm
[2:55:20] worthy of this Redemption none of that
[2:55:22] really mattered it doesn't really matter
[2:55:23] does it somebody said it doesn't really
[2:55:25] matter
[2:55:26] what about in God's sight
[2:55:31] he said I look at you as a human I look
[2:55:33] at you as a brother but God looks at you
[2:55:35] through the blood of his son as a
[2:55:38] redeemed one Jesus said be ye therefore
[2:55:41] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[2:55:44] perfect and now not what you've done
[2:55:48] you have done nothing to Merit it
[2:55:51] but it's what Christ somebody needs to
[2:55:54] read that but it's what Christ did
[2:56:02] that stand
[2:56:04] and it
[2:56:06] reaches to the
[2:56:09] highest
[2:56:11] mountain

[3:01:36] praise God how many of you are thankful
[3:01:39] for the blood
[3:01:42] now why are you preaching this again you
[3:01:44] just preached this two years ago laid
[3:01:47] out just like this
[3:01:48] why would you preach this again well
[3:01:50] I'll tell you why
[3:01:52] because when the Lord said to me a few
[3:01:54] weeks ago
[3:01:56] that 2023 was going to be a supernatural
[3:01:58] year
[3:01:59] I mean you know we could really say
[3:02:01] every year it's a supernatural year when
[3:02:03] you serve a supernatural God
[3:02:07] but we're expecting
[3:02:09] manifestation of the BR of the
[3:02:12] supernatural
[3:02:13] and manifestation of the Breakthrough
[3:02:16] in many situations in our lives
[3:02:20] and you've got to have something to
[3:02:22] focus you've got to focus on him you've
[3:02:24] got to have something to pull for
[3:02:27] when I started doing that
[3:02:29] he spoke to my heart and he said
[3:02:32] that we should come boldly
[3:02:35] that this should be a season of coming
[3:02:37] boldly to the throne of grace
[3:02:41] making our petition known to him
[3:02:45] and when I hear that invitation
[3:02:48] I immediately begin to think of all the
[3:02:51] reasons why it would be dangerous
[3:02:53] for me to just March in
[3:02:56] stand behind stand before the throne and
[3:03:00] lay out all my my complaints so to speak
[3:03:05] and I know that many are struggling with
[3:03:08] your own lives
[3:03:10] and you know that it's right you know
[3:03:12] that the invitation is yours but you
[3:03:15] hesitate
[3:03:17] how many of you know that that minute
[3:03:19] second of hesitation sometimes can keep
[3:03:22] you out of the water
[3:03:23] when the angel comes and troubles the
[3:03:25] water just that one second it's like you
[3:03:28] you hesitate one minute and you
[3:03:29] paralyzed I remember teaching the
[3:03:31] children a little bit to drive
[3:03:33] and that one
[3:03:36] little half a second hesitation can make
[3:03:39] such a difference
[3:03:40] where if you just if you just I believe
[3:03:42] you should be careful you should make
[3:03:44] sure and if you don't know just wait
[3:03:46] till they're all all come by
[3:03:49] but that sometime you would you wouldn't
[3:03:51] think it but that little bit of
[3:03:52] hesitation where you pull up and you
[3:03:55] can really cause you to miss your chance
[3:03:57] to get in the traffic and you pull out
[3:03:59] then somebody has to slow down you get
[3:04:02] honked at mistreated
[3:04:04] and it's the same way spiritually
[3:04:06] if you when the when the invitation
[3:04:09] comes when God makes something real and
[3:04:11] you start feeling the pull toward it and
[3:04:13] then you and then you remember
[3:04:16] you remember that argument that we
[3:04:17] talked about Tuesday night that you had
[3:04:19] with your wife or you remember the
[3:04:21] trouble you had with your with your
[3:04:23] roommates
[3:04:25] or you remember that that encounter you
[3:04:27] had on your job with somebody
[3:04:30] or you remember that disrespect that
[3:04:32] your teenager showed you and your
[3:04:34] response it was less than adult
[3:04:38] and that hesitation can keep us
[3:04:41] from yielding and answering our
[3:04:44] invitation to stand before the throne
[3:04:46] and the only way I know to help us
[3:04:48] overcome that hesitation to where we
[3:04:50] take one moment and look over our lives
[3:04:52] when we're supposed to only be looking
[3:04:54] to the lamb one moment of looking over
[3:04:57] your mess when you're supposed to be
[3:04:59] looking at the lamb can keep you from
[3:05:01] the promise
[3:05:03] it can delay
[3:05:05] it can delay the promise so your first
[3:05:09] reaction now as a Believer because of
[3:05:11] this word that we're being grounded in
[3:05:14] and rooted in your first reaction is if
[3:05:17] the Lord says to you come closer to me
[3:05:18] this year
[3:05:20] I'm here
[3:05:22] I am
[3:05:24] show me what to do
[3:05:26] Speak Lord your servant hears
[3:05:30] just like Samuel said to the old priest
[3:05:32] I keep hearing my name called did you
[3:05:35] call me did you call me did you call me
[3:05:38] finally the answer said no but you you
[3:05:41] next time you hear that
[3:05:43] voice call your name Speak Lord for thy
[3:05:46] servant hear it without hesitation
[3:05:50] how many of you want to answer like that
[3:05:52] no hesitation and that's why we're
[3:05:54] rooting and grounding this again let's
[3:05:56] worship
[3:05:59] [Music]

[3:23:23] because of the atonement we claim every

[3:23:36] authentic
[3:23:38] you have given us
[3:23:41] children's rights

[3:23:57] by your Redemption
[3:24:01] Lord let our love for one another grow
[3:24:03] stronger this year
[3:24:06] may we be quicker to look over one
[3:24:08] another's faults
[3:24:10] may we be quicker to speak life into one
[3:24:13] another's lives
[3:24:16] and may we do what our Psalm of the Year
[3:24:19] says may we look to the Lord may we look
[3:24:21] to you
[3:24:23] may we cast up our eyes toward you Lord
[3:24:27] and may you show us
[3:24:29] mercy upon Mercy
[3:24:32] make us one in the body
[3:24:36] and we will give you praise and honor
[3:24:39] and Glory

[3:25:06] flow through you to someone else you're

[3:25:10] you're just not receiving if you're not
[3:25:12] giving
[3:25:16] part of receiving is to give part of
[3:25:18] receiving love is to give love you
[3:25:20] believe that
[3:25:30] sometimes it pulls us a little bit out
[3:25:32] of our comfort zone

[3:27:59] remember that there will be a service
[3:28:00] here Tuesday night at seven o'clock
[3:28:04] we want to say again to you Happy New
[3:28:06] Year
[3:28:07] may God bless you in this new year and
[3:28:10] prosper you in every way
[3:28:12] remember your commitment to him
[3:28:16] make him Lord of all
[3:28:18] [Music]

[3:28:22] go to Dada

[3:28:31] God bless you as you leave today
[3:28:34] we're a blessed people
[3:28:37] don't forget to tell Hawk happy birthday
[3:28:39] [Music]
[3:28:41] as you leave today
[3:28:45] I don't know what the visitation is like
[3:28:47] at the rehabilitation in Phoenix City
[3:28:49] now
[3:28:51] nine to seven
[3:28:53] mask
[3:28:55] they might make you wear a mask you do
[3:28:58] have to sign in
[3:29:01] but if you would like to go in now you
[3:29:04] may find her out of the room
[3:29:06] and they might tell you where she is and
[3:29:09] they might not
[3:29:11] so it is possible that you would miss
[3:29:13] her
[3:29:14] but a lot of the time if you go they
[3:29:17] will tell you where she is and you could
[3:29:19] even go and see her
[3:29:21] in some of her rehab
[3:29:24] you wouldn't want to be in the way or
[3:29:26] hinder but you could wave at her and say
[3:29:28] hello hello and smile and blow her a
[3:29:30] kiss and go out I feel like it would
[3:29:34] mean so much to her if she could see
[3:29:36] some of us even for just a moment
[3:29:39] you'll see our faces God has done a
[3:29:42] tremendous work
[3:29:44] and there they believe at the rehab that
[3:29:47] they're going to be able to help her get
[3:29:48] through this process
[3:29:51] anything that you can do for sister
[3:29:53] Weems for meribeth and her family would
[3:29:57] be greatly appreciated this has
[3:29:59] certainly been a difficult time for them
[3:30:03] even Mary Beth had to go to Atlanta
[3:30:05] yesterday to pick her up just to keep
[3:30:08] the process from bogging down again
[3:30:11] and to bring her to the rehab
[3:30:14] so if there's anything that you can do
[3:30:16] for those for sister Weems for Hawk for
[3:30:18] Maribeth if you had a meal you could
[3:30:20] prepare or some kindness that you could
[3:30:23] show to them I know God would bless you
[3:30:25] for it some of you have been doing that
[3:30:27] I know God would bless you let me thank
[3:30:30] those of you who came and helped us to
[3:30:33] move the things back in the blue room
[3:30:35] yesterday brother man thank you for what
[3:30:38] you've done to help us get repaired out
[3:30:40] there and fixed and for every person
[3:30:43] that worked to get us through those
[3:30:45] those difficult cold days when you go
[3:30:48] out of here today it will be very
[3:30:50] difficult for you to think about the
[3:30:51] fact we were in the 20s last Sunday
[3:30:55] this Alabama winner is all right
[3:30:58] I know some of you want some more cold
[3:31:00] it'll come it'll be here don't worry
[3:31:02] you'll get a little more of it
[3:31:04] but it don't have to be in the teens to
[3:31:06] meet your needs I hope
[3:31:09] you're dismissed to go it's good to have
[3:31:11] Gabriel sometimes known as gab or Gabe
[3:31:16] it's good to have him with us this
[3:31:17] weekend so wonderful to have sister
[3:31:20] nakisha and Naya here after quite a
[3:31:22] while
