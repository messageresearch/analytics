[0:00] guess where he chooses to dwell to be
[0:04] enthroned in our praises do you think
[0:16] maybe praise is part of the key to get
[0:22] to a place where you can move and rest
[0:24] and move in peace and move with a
[0:28] non-offending spirit have you ever
[0:31] thought about if we really praise the
[0:34] Lord with our life not with just our
[0:37] demonstration in church but but we need
[0:40] that but also our live if we praise Him
[0:43] if we lift him up if he really dwells in
[0:46] our praises if he really comes to sit
[0:49] where we have prepared praise for him
[0:52] will he not bring the peace we're
[0:54] looking for won't he bring the grace we
[0:57] need to get over whatever it is we're
[0:59] walking through he could sit anywhere
[1:02] that he wanted to sit he could dwell
[1:05] anywhere that he wanted to dwell but
[1:07] guess where he chooses to dwell to be
[1:11] enthroned in our praises when you praise
[1:17] the Lord you're giving him a place in
[1:20] your life you're inviting him to come
[1:24] and sit in the middle of your stuff
[1:29] there's some stuff here lard that you're
[1:33] not gonna like but I need your help in
[1:37] getting rid of that stuff so I'm going
[1:41] to bring you in and allow you to be
[1:44] enthroned in my praise
[1:46] I'm not praising because I'm worthy I'm
[1:49] praising you because you are worthy you
[1:54] are worthy my praise is not about me
[1:57] it's about you it's about who you are
[2:00] it's about giving you a place to dwell
[2:04] to abide to remain to stay to tarry to
[2:08] take your seat in my life
