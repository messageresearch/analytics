that goodness and mercy follow us all of the days of our lives and we can be shadowed by the presence of the lord tabernacled in your presence o lord hallelujah we give you praise lord hallelujah will you give the lord a shout of praise today hallelujah [Applause] the lord you may have your seats today i don't generally have you to sit down but i just want to you all have been praying so faithfully for us as we were gone and i just give you a quick update of what we know and uh we went up to be a a blessing to joyce's sister to try to take care of joyce's mother who is bedridden and had good days with her while we were up there i spoke last sunday morning for dad at his church and he on the way home there was a wreck on the way to his home and they turned them around wouldn't let them go up and so mom and dad went to have a little lunch while they were having lunch dad started to uh have some shakes and other kind of symptoms and by the time that he got home he was he was shaking and and breathing hard he sat down to take a nap and he uh just got all emotional and mom had to help him to settle down he settled down uh and and seemed to be breathing easier and when i went up the next day of course he was breathing very hard again and uh he had the knee operation and mom kept saying that his knee was hot so we checked and of course it was warm to the touch and then i touched his forehead it was warm he had a temperature and we got him in the hospital and all of this through the week that we were there all week with him and and he's on heavy doses of antibiotics just no person ought to have to go through it uh but we're believing the lord to bring him through that this knee is going to be okay that he's not going to have to have anything done with that need the infection we're decreeing that the infection is leaving his body he's having an awful time with the catheter and we're believing that that is going to be all right as well so uh on top of that last sunday afternoon dad's song leader we told you that his wife had just had open heart surgery and last sunday afternoon their son came to visit his mama and he had been to church at a large church not far away and they're having an outbreak of coronavirus and on monday he woke up with symptoms tuesday diagnosed with the he tested and found out that he had uh indeed the virus along with all of his family and so we're believing god to keep our sister who has just come through open-heart surgery that she will not be affected by this and of course they had to shut down their service this weekend because of uh increase so i think that we as a body need to be careful and pray and believe god to keep that thing away from us we're uh i already know that it isn't very far up the road i already know it i've got a call this week that it's just at a church up the road 30 minutes and uh so we need to pray and believe god that it stays away from here not that we're special but we want to stay under the cover of the blood of jesus christ keeping all the unbelief out of our life that's what i keep asking the lord lord i want all the unbelief out of my life don't want none of it i want to be believing the promises of god recognizing that the word that i am hearing is for me and that it is for my steadfast hope in the lord and i'm resting upon that so uh that is uh the update for daddy my mother-in-law uh is is about the same except for the the bedsore that she has is is weeping and now they're saying it's gonna have to be packed and it's one more thing that is put on my sister-in-law and so she's at the end of her wits and can't find help while she works and so she needs prayer my mother-in-law needs prayer my father-in-law and i know that you do too so how about by the raising of the hand you just say i need the lord to meet a need that i have all right let's stand together do you have some spoken ones yeah let's pray for brother curry who spent a lot of this week in the hospital he is out of the hospital and i'm expecting him to be in service tonight there but let's really hold him up to the lord in prayer and all the other needs that we've been praying for that god will undertake all right let's stand together he's all i need jesus is all i need he's all i need he's all i need jesus is all i need oh yes he's all i need he's all i need jesus i need will you lift your hands and say i worship him i worship him i work him in spirit and in truth [Music] [Music] in spirit [Music] our father as we come to you today what a blessing and what a privilege it is that we have to come to you our hearts delight in your presence o lord and i know that you have delight in me and in your people and lord you said we were created for your pleasure god i thank you that my life and my obedience in walking with you can bring you pleasure and joy lord we want to thank you that you have created us to be living epistles written and read of all men lord may our lives reflect the goodness of god lord i thank you that we can bring our needs to you you see our brother curry today oh god we're bringing him once again before you thanking you that you are the healer you are the one who can give new cells and create new body parts and strengthen us when we're weak and down we're believing you to do that for our brother god as we gather together with them tonight we're believing you lord for a mighty outpouring of the holy spirit and we're believing for one right here this morning lord a mighty outpouring of your spirit we know that the enemy fights and he he tries to wage war against us and he tries to keep our minds all in a muddle or a world but he's lost the battle already lord you already paid the price by the blood of the lamb the perfect sacrifice and we are we're just resting in that today lord as you go across this body and you saw all the hands that were raised lord out onto the stream and the needs that they have you already paid for the price of the need that they have and god we're just confessing and believing that you are handling the situation thy kingdom come and thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven oh god we're depending on you lord we're praying for those that are traveling on the roads today asking that you will give traveling mercies keep them safe lord let angels camp around them bring them home safely lord you see all of the the the goings and the comings and lord even in our minds the things that we face we know that you are god over it all and we're committing ourselves to you and in this immediate moment lord i am asking you that you will give us the grace to bring everything that is going on in our minds to to a place where we can set it aside and we can focus on you and what you want to say as our brother our pastor your servant would come and stand behind this desk i pray god that you would give him laser focus to be able to deliver the word of the lord to us today and may we be receptive vestals pulling on the word of the lord pulling on the gift that you have placed among us strengthen us now lord for your purposes get honor and glory out of this service we commit all these things into your

friends the half has not yet been told i tell you if you if you go and you listen to what we've been hearing and then you go and back it up with the the message of the hour you start listening to what brother branham is saying uh ha or said rather what he said 40 50 60 years ago uh the the the things that the bride is coming into her fruitfulness into her maturity and and i i was listening uh friday night and and saturday listening to the message oneness and to hear brother branham talk we did not have the ability to have oneness with god but he came in the form of a human being to die on the cross and give his blood to rid us of our guilt to rid us of our shame to rid us of our sin and unbelief so that he could come and live inside of us have oneness with him oh hallelujah that's my desire fully my desire is to come into full maturity of the lord jesus christ if you brought your tithing offering with you today we're going to give you opportunity to give to the lord brother michael will you come brother nathan will you come we let these brothers come to you i don't have a total here from this morning but it's tuesday this is the total all right 118 337 dollars and of course next weekend is the first sunday of the month so we're going to come together and and give our principal offering you pray this week and ask the lord what he would have you to give father as the people give today you see what is in their hearts you see what they're giving their tithe and their offering and i'm asking father that you would let the blessings of the lord rest upon their lives and i ask that you'll multiply and and give back o god and may what is given be multiplied for the purposes of the kingdom of god we'll give you glory and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen the lord bless you as you give to the lord today when the redeemed are gathering in this says gee i am thinking of the rapture in our blessing home on high with redeemed are

redeemed are gathering in saints will sing redemption story with their voices clear and strong when the redeemed are gathering it then the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song when

hallelujah you're wonderful lord you're wonderful jesus you deserve the highest praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] praise god [Applause] hallelujah oh we did that for the lord but i'd like to say take that you dirty devil you're defeated today [Music] he is defeated in the name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated he is uh fighting us in electronics i believe there's a demon that of electronics i'm gonna have to think of a name for him but i believe that that that's whatever it is it's uh uh trying to attack uh three things that are vital to what we needed this morning yesterday i worked for about an hour and uh on my laptop no problems never had a problem with it it's three years old and i put it in sleep mode and put it down and did some other things and came back to it and it wouldn't charge it wouldn't turn on it wouldn't do anything and hawk was available he came over here and helped me and we were with tech and we were with this and that and the other and uh i didn't put quite enough faith i wished i'd put i didn't take it serious enough i just said lord i know you could help me if you would i realize now that probably wasn't a faith-filled prayer was it lord i know you could if you would and so hawk asked me this morning if there had been a resurrection i said no but i just didn't put enough faith in it i know i just didn't didn't take it serious enough but that really threw me off on what i was preparing for tonight we get here and the drum brain is scrambled and we couldn't he couldn't get any settings he wasn't even sure if we'd be able to play this morning and we have got a solution back there for our for our projector computer and everything is working like a dream except for what i need this morning and they cannot get it pulled up and find it so those times that you didn't see words on the screen that's because they were working and they're trying but you know what god is good and you people just praised him anyway you clapped your hands and just shifted the atmosphere and i appreciate that so much and we just have to do that we just have to go on and give god praise and you know pastors get concerned knowing that so many are going to be missing but we're right at 70 this morning and i know there's all right at 25 regulars who are traveling who are not here this morning and so you know what that it just looks good to me i know there's a lot of empty seats but like i told them on the way to church this morning i said but the ones that are going to be here they're going to be good ones not that those who are missing aren't good they're good too very good but you know sometimes it's it's quality instead of quantity and i knew that those of you who would be here today would make up your you'd praise any way and you'd say amen anyway and you'd clap anyway and so that's what it takes to create an atmosphere the lord is here and we believe that god is going to do something today we believe he's going to move for us this evening in lagrange and we're just asking the lord we've had several reach out to say that they were going to be in the service and we're looking forward to that and let me give you the uh i texted zach last night and told him to expect a bunch of text because i was going to give his number today and everybody was going to call him and find out what the address was but he said he was prepared he has it and he's ready um so they're traveling home today and uh we want to ask god to bring them all the way and uh so if you need the address uh it's the pentecostal church of lagrange 82 chase road lagrange georgia 82 chase road lagrange georgia and you'll be able to find it and be with us in service there tonight if you have a desire to do that and then next friday night i was going to pull up a zip code so it would help you if you're putting it in your if you're putting it in your smartphone the zip code is 30241. 82 chase road to grange georgia 30241 and from the church it's 49 minutes from my house it was uh 55 minutes so if you were to leave from the church you would be at the church in lagrange in 49 minutes we're going to look to see some of you there brother curry has been in the hospital this week again and but god let him come home on thursday evening i believe it was and they're just wanting to stay on top of everything and we want them to do that until the miracle comes and we're still believing god we know that he is a creative god he is a healer he's a miracle worker and he can turn things around and uh all things are coming like they are for a reason we know the timing of everything you know as i sat here on the platform for a moment this morning i was able to see something that i hadn't seen before in the timing of the laptop going out i saw something and made a connection in this in my mind i believe by the spirit i made a connection i said well there's the timing that's why it happened the way it did and if we can do that and give god praise no matter what comes or goes then we're going to make it we're just going to make it and so anyway the drums sounded all right and we made it through and uh i see them toting computers around up there so they're trying to get something worked out but if worse comes to worse you can always go to the table this morning and follow along i like to have it up because people have written from all over the world and said you'll never know what it means to be able to see the scripture and the quote and the words but it just doesn't always happen that way and so anyway let's just make mention these things so we can get started here tomorrow i noticed would have been brother and sister heise's wedding anniversary and both of them are in the presence of the lord sister heichi left us this year and we want to remember the fact that god blessed their lives he gave them to us and we miss them we miss them when i am looking at memories you know every morning when i'm doing for uh facebook birthday greetings i usually check the memories real quick and you'd be surprised how many monday mornings sister heisi wrote on my wall pastor thank you for that message and i miss that i miss her i miss her amens i miss her reacting sometime out of place if you said anything that she just felt was sad she'd oh you just felt sorry for everybody didn't she and i miss her so much and uh so let's let's honor uh them in the memory of brother and sister hi c uh tuesday is sister rhonda shaw's birthday she is going to be 39 and a day or two beyond that and so we want to say happy birthday to sister rhonda god bless you she still blushes that's how we know she's only 39 and she still blushes and uh thursday i know you don't see gregory and samantha very often but uh we think of them they support the church i pray for them just like they were here on a regular basis but gregory's they just had an anniversary and gregory's birthday is coming up on thursday so if that should cross your mind would you pray for him pray for his family and also thursday would uh be the wedding anniversary of brother and sister weems and that is they were married in 1955 so that's a lot of years and brother williams has been with the lord a long time now but sister williams looks amazing this morning and so we want to say happy wedding anniversary to you we saw it we thought about you the lord is good there were prayer requests that came in that we didn't take time to mention this morning but some of them were urgent brother keith smith uh the widower of sister gladys he sent prayer requests in yesterday for for several and one that he asked to be confidential but it's urgent and we are uh believing that god will undertake uh leniel brother lenio yant sent me several notes yesterday especially while at the hospital he sent an inbox and he said pray brother shelly pray both lois and i have been diagnosed with covid they're getting up in years and uh there are uh as of last night there were over 70 who have been diagnosed in the happy valley church and uh that's a large church and there's a lot of visiting that goes on and we want to pray for them some of them will will come right through it and won't even won't even phase them but but others could possibly struggle a little bit because of their age and because of their conditions and we want to ask the lord to move he can move he the angel of the lord can step in there and any other group where those things are happening and we ask you as brother greeley mentioned just to watch your symptoms very carefully and if you feel like you are running a fever or you may have something that looks like that then you might want to to just do a little self-quarantine for a service or two and we would honor that and understand that and uh it's easier than than just saying all the seniors stay home i don't want to do that i need them i need their amens and sister flo and several others say when we were going through some of that would send me texts and say pastor i want to come to church sister flo said please let me come and so let's just use all the wisdom that we can muster and be careful with one another and i know god's gonna see us through you you you rushing me this morning already good good please don't i want to sing i claim the blood mayor bethel i have a source of strength when i am weak it takes me through when life is praising me [Music] i have a source of power from above i've been covered by his shield of love sing it with me i claim the blood there's life in it jesus said on calvary those precious blood states [Music] they were made there just for me for all my sin my sickness and my pain [Music] when i need healing when i need healing oh i just claim those precious bloodstains how many of you need to claim them this morning i do not know how others make it through [Music] who'll never go [Music] back to calgary as i do for there's a healing and a cleansing stream that still flows with a piece with a piece that oh my god's redeemed can't know are there any redeemed ones here this morning sing i claim the blood [Music] jesus share on calvary those

service on his phone isn't that wonderful i don't want to take time to go through all this because i i i'm on my ipad and to be honest with you i don't do too good on it but brother chuck if you're still listening you blessed my heart to know you were watching this service god bless you i love your family and uh i feel like i'm almost a part of your family and i i just appreciate the fact that you would join us and so many others from all over the world the writers are listening in south africa and uh sister miriam is watching and and sister george he's watching and so many uh here's

like uh probably blood will never lose its power to those of you who are watching on youtube and other places god bless you romans chapter 8 verse 15 says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that is coveted cancer whatever else the circumstances might be we are children of the most high god and we've received many many benefits of the spirit but we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption chiropractor asked me this week what i was preaching i started telling him the different works of the holy spirit he said i've never heard of that i said well you need to hear about it that's in the word too i said i'll bring you a list in here so you can look it up he said what's the spirit of adoption whoo that's a good one whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god praise the lord and if children then will you you say that heirs i want to know how many of you have never been left a thing in anybody's will hold up your hand look at there look at there that's just sad but here i want to tell you something you are an heir you are an heir of god and join heirs with jesus christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together are you still there for i reckon that the sufferings of this present age are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us let's say it this way which shall be revealed in me hallelujah glory shall be revealed in me for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for thee waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body [Music] lord jesus we thank you today for every promise you have given us in your word as we sit under the inspiration of your presence we can see ourselves in the word we see ourselves in the promise we recognize that what you have promised your bride you have promised us and we may look at it as a future event but we thank you for the understanding that what is to come is already working in the children of god to bring the sons of god into manifestation in their hour and so we bless the name of the lord we bless your name we honor you for your goodness that follows us that chases us down we honor you that you actively pursue us to bless us with goodness and with abundant mercies lord bless our time together in the word today and move among us in the meeting tonight and we'll give you honor glory and praise in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen all the people of god just added another hearty amen you may be seated now we're three sermons in to the spirit of adoption we are ready to move next sunday to the spirit of holiness and there is so much to say we probably won't get that in one service either but when i was reflecting about whether to do a little more in the spirit of adoption or move to the spirit of holiness i felt like that we should linger just another day in this spirit of adoption because it's actively working in us there's only one holy spirit so when we receive the earnest of the spirit these things begin to work in us when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost then there is an activation of everything that lays within us potentially it's now an awakened seed the spirit of truth begins to operate in us the spirit of life begins to operate in us and the spirit of adoption begins to operate in us followed by the spirit of holiness the spirit of supplication and the spirit of grace all of these things begin to manifest in our lives one holy ghost with many different ministries many different administrations and you might even say office before we started this series on the seven offices that the holy ghost holds in our life we talked about the purpose of the holy ghost coming and we talked about conviction and we we contrasted the difference between the spirit of conviction at work in our life and and condemnation condemnation will leave you hopeless you will feel like there's no way to ever get free there's no way to ever get your head above the wave you're just doomed to be who you are broken individual not ever quite measuring up but when the spirit of conviction when when the spirit of holiness that we'll talk about next week when it begins to be activated in our life it brings a conviction that is the spirit of god just putting his finger on different things in our life that we need to tune up i don't know what we do without the holy ghost because there are so many wild spirits loose in the earth today who would have ever thought if you would have ever told me 25 years ago that there would be believers of this message doing yoga i would have told you you're losing your mind but there are so many wild spirits that are loosed in the earth today and if we are not actively oh it got quiet it is certainly not a bad idea for you to stretch but you better do a little research i don't care if it's hot yoga goat yoga i don't care what kind of yoga it is it is not holy ghost yoga but you stretch and you exercise and you do that that's fine but you don't have to pick up the heathen ways of this world to do it my my my i didn't expect to kick back in here [Applause] maybe that was a streamer hanging up on me but it felt like it was a whole lot closer to this pulpit than the stream i want to tell you something i never dreamed such wildness would get in among god's people as it's operating among the people today and that's why we got to have we have to have the holy ghost i've watched through the years there are certain ways someone can twist their hair or pull their hair to one side or do something some sister with their hair not even realizing that in that you may be projecting a spirit you don't say anything i don't felt him now it grieves my heart to see holy ghost filled people with duck lips it does it grieves me when i see saints of god posing with duck lips for the whole world to see because it's some kind of fad or some kind of fashion and i want you to know i'm talking to everybody you say well i think i've seen one of yours i'm telling you that's why i'm preaching the whole truth this morning because i want all the folks of god all the children of god to take a little note i want all of us to check up on our payment we have the greatest resource i'm telling you we have the encyclopedia of what pleases god living on the inside of us he's here by the holy ghost and if you'll lean on him he will prompt you just a minute amen brother he will put a steering wheel right in your inner man and he will direct you everybody can fall into a fashion everybody can fall into a fad everybody can fall into the stream but i want you to know if you let the holy ghost establish that steering wheel look at me now i'm preaching i'm not reading anything that that steering wheel that the holy ghost will put in here he will direct you and lead you if you find yourself falling into something if you'll lean on him he'll pull you back to the middle of the road this is this is the greatest thing that could ever happen to a man or a woman in history is to have the holy ghost living inside of them operating in them as the spirit of life as the spirit of truth as the spirit of adoption i don't want to get too far ahead of myself and we are so blessed because when the holy ghost comes and does the inner work he takes out the hopelessness that condemnation brings he takes out the guilt that not knowing sometimes we just don't know and we feel guilty that we don't know you don't have to feel guilty you've got the holy ghost in you he'll quicken truth to you he'll let you know how you ought to be doing come on now just remember we have a message where brother branham talked about splits in the skirts i hadn't forgot that i hadn't forgot that because he felt like and so do i that sometimes a spirit can get in that amen brother why i didn't think i'd have any any hindrances here this morning when it come to preaching truth like that we have the holy ghost i know i know some out there in the charismatics and pentecostals or i know they can't stand that i know they can't they've got all kinds of names to call that but you know believers bride believers we want everything that god has for us and if he don't want us to have it we don't want it amen we don't want anything that's rooted and grounded in something that's going to trouble us when we lay down to sleep at night or our children when they lay down to sleep at night we want peace in our homes amen that's why we've got to be careful about that channel any channel that we open up into our home because the enemy will take advantage of that but i'm thankful so thankful to know that the holy ghost is abiding on the inside this great work of adoption is taking place in us we are not brought in from another family and adopted but we are a part of this family from before the foundation of the world and we are being schooled and tutored and trained and matured and taught so that we can have the same announcement that was pronounced over the lord jesus christ not just at the baptism that was the beginning of the adoption process but on the mount of transfiguration the voice said more than i'm pleased to dwell in my son hear ye him hear what he has to say and there is a voice of authority that's being established in the bride of jesus christ that demons will not be able to withstand i'm telling you the voice of god's authority in you by the holy ghost will rout every demon and every foul spirit amen brother he'll send it on its way we need to have that holy ghost oh don't get yourselves out of joint give god praise you ought to thank him you have a pastor you should you should there's a lot of shepherdless sheep and we need it i need it i'm thankful for those who speak into my life can i have jehovah jireh is that one of the ones you all were able to get it was the last one that we read here on or maybe we wanted to d we did get to it didn't we because it's from sioux falls south dakota and that's paragraph 34. and i want to just share this with you in the time that we have left i'm about to i hallelujah don't get worked up just let me get worked up whoa i don't know why i feel like i feel right now hallelujah i feel like i've been plugged in to an electrical current and that might not always feel pleasant but right now i'm i'm i'm reaching for breath here whoa glory what we have what a treasure oh what a treasure we have when we have the holy ghost we have time for a few hours to go into the adoption to show how god pulled his people out and his son jesus was adopted into the family after he was already his son born in the family he become adopted in the family also he was adopted taken out put a white robe on he was adopted into the same family he was born into if he proved to be a fine man until he was of age and correctly about his father's business he said god done the same thing to his son took him apart put him up on the mountain and there overshadowed him did you know the holy ghost in the word is overshadowing the bride in the hour that we're living in because he wants to come bursting forth out of the very cells of our body like happened to jesus on the mount of transfiguration the very god that was within him that spirit of truth that he was that which filled his being that which he received at his baptism it was fully activated that day as we mentioned last week and the very pores of his skin begin to emanate like turning on a a lamp but not a lamp just don't sound bright enough does it turning on the sun the bible said his his garments glistened like the sun there was so much light and transfiguring glory that was coming out of him when he reached his full adoption i'm telling you the presence was so real and there was such an overshadowing that took place until the the inner circle said let us just build some tabernacles here and never go down think about that how many of you would like to stand in a presence so profound and so powerful that you said i'll just stay right here if somebody will just bring me a little water and a soda cracker i'll never go down off of this mountain i don't ever want to lose or leave this presence now in pentecost they all made fun of this verse of scripture i heard them preach against it now look at these look at these denominational preachers and look how they wanted to build churches and that was in their mind mentality and mind and brother randa mentioned that one time like that but you know what he said he said why isn't that something they wanted to abide in that presence that they felt so you can look at everything couple different ways can't you you could see that as a negative thing they wanted to start a denominational church and that's what it would have ended up being we know what it would have ended up being but their desire was like like the desire of the rich young ruler that gets so so bashed about you know but there was really something going on in his life that's a whole lot more profound than what we get a hold of and this was so profound that this inner circle said we could just live the rest of our lives in this presence what has happened before our eyes what we have seen what we have experienced we will never ever be the same again and the prophet said here god done the same thing to his son took him apart put him up on the mountain and there overshadowed him and his garments glistened like the sun in its strength like that god was doing something powerful he goes on to say and a voice spoke from heaven said this is my beloved son hear ye him god placing his own son we're in that hour we're in the same hour for the bride where god is desiring to place his sons in their position oh never ever ever to be moved again once god places you in that in that place in that socket where he wants you you don't ever have to be moved again no matter what comes no matter who howls you found a place of assurance and a place of peace and a place of authority that when the enemy held you just how back greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world god placing his own son brother branham said that's right god still places his children in his church and the time of adoption is at hand and don't miss that last word separating because there's always a separating when god starts placing his sons there always is because he's not placing everybody he's placing his sons he's putting them in their position and that leaves some standing there rubbing their eyes trying to figure out what's going on why aren't they bothered why aren't they looking anymore at the circumstances of life around them why have they found an assurance that i don't know what to do i don't even know who they are anymore because nothing seems to bend them anymore they just keep marching on the glory see they're just rubbing their eyes trying to figure out it's a separating time all right in the message hear ye him do we have that 1956 i want to read this slow and i can i don't have to go on all day but is that one you don't have it's just after it's just after jehovah jireh okay yes that's it notice and this is a little lengthy so would you try to stay with all the attention that you have here on what the messenger is saying to us he said now notice now when this child become at a certain age if if it had have been a correct child had been zealous of the father's works had been stable always abounding in the works of the lord not tossed about with every wind and care listen now he's fixing to get personal not one day a presbyterian next day a methodist next day a nazarene next day a pilgrim holiness tossed about like a leaf on a troubled sea have you ever known anybody like that have you ever been anybody like that come on why don't we just be honest some of us didn't know what we were you know i got an explanation for that we were looking for who we were we were trying to figure out who we were we tried barnyard after barnyard after barnyard and none of them seemed to be conducive for an eagle so forgive us for our journey but one day he came flying over the barnyard where we were sitting and jehovah eagle let out a cry and like the old song said i recognize my father on that day i knew who i was on that day i just hopped right up on the fence post and waited for jehovah eagle to come down low enough that i could climb on his back and deliver me from all those worm-eaten chickens that i'd been fellowshipping with all my life i was not born to eat worms i was an eagle you were not born to eat worms you were you were born to eat the bloody meat it hasn't long been since it had fresh warm blood i know it's a little gory i don't i tell you when i think about it like that it don't make me gory i don't mind one bit to sink my whole head in that carcass i watched a little film this week of of serengeti they made another series of of uh nature films in the serengeti and tanzania now i want you to know them lions chad there they they'll put their whole head there they don't they're not worried about a man or table manners they don't have their hanky out they don't put on an apron first they just hang their whole head put it right up in the chest of that zebra whatever it is and they eat all they can hold i got pretty aggravated i have to be honest i got pretty aggravated one time when they sent a woman out to do the killing she goes out and takes down the zebra mighty woman of god she takes the zebra down and she starts to eat i would too she starts to eat this old husband of hers sorry husband he come out and ran her off growled at her like she was a villain villain or something and there she goes running off while he eats all the food i believe she was just going to take a snack and give him the rest but he had no patience for that let me tell you something there's something about getting a hold of the word of god and it starts moving in you and your cells start responding to it your emotions start responding to it you forget your table manner you'll put your head right in the middle of that carcass where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together come on now it's christ it's the living word and it gives the strength we need i'm not going to look at some of you people that are stuck in the mud you know who you are i'm so thankful for the feast tossed about like a leaf on a troubled sea if it was stable it's mine no matter where it was at set on christ his affections working with one single heart zealous of getting souls saved and not churchi the church's fusses then in the go ahead it didn't mean to interrupt your amens i got plenty of time to stop for an amen then in the old testament there come a day that his father brought his son out into the public as a witness put a robe on him and set him upon a place where all the city could see him and they had the law of adoption this father to his own son who had been born in his own family and now was of age and was a child worthy to take his place he adopted or placed his own son into position he said any bible reader knows that the placing of a son powerful any bible reader knows that he said then after that ceremony the son had a right his name was just as good on the check as his father's was let me tell you something we've made a few withdrawals here and there but there's coming an hour right around the corner where we're going to live by those withdrawals because what we have is going to come from him let me tell you something if you didn't learn anything from the shutdowns of 2020 and 2021 you you might learn the next round if you didn't already learn you may learn now i just heard just just this morning i heard that cases are rising in alberta and that they're already talking about the next step there and they're already talking about in many many states there is such a uh a number of uh arise in the numbers of the of the different variants uh in uh particularly in tennessee in missouri and in florida that even conservative governors are being pushed to try to figure out what to do to try to stop it and i guess you heard our governor blaming all the unvaccinated people for the problem god bless our governor and strengthen her and may she live long on this earth but she ain't right about everything we ought to go beyond that if you want to put the blame on somebody put the blame on the enemy because he's the one getting all the press come on now and so you may not have learned anything the first time it may take the second time but i want you to know you can see in what has happened how quickly life can change a job that you depended on gone restaurant owners flourishing gone no restaurant no and now with everything getting supposedly to get back in the groove and go on and they can't get anybody to work offering people money bonuses i mean has anybody ever heard of mcdonald's giving bonuses to get people to work there's always people that want to do jobs like that until the hour we're living in it just lets us see how how changing everything is how really fragile everything can be we are probably very soon coming to an hour where we are really going to appreciate the authority that comes when the sons are placed because our name on the check it's going to be withdrawals from the father's bank of eternity that's going to help us get through life until the rapture day so we're going to need to function in that authority and there's going to be such a pull among souls that are scattered around the world who need to be fed like little birds lifting up their heads trying to get a little piece of meat until we're going to not only need to make withdrawals from the father's bank account we're going to need supernatural travels we're going to need supernatural provision we're going to need absolutely supernatural intervention to be able to do the things we need to do hallelujah oh that sounds somebody said that just paints a dark picture you're seeing wrong you better change your glasses i don't see darkness i see a lot of light coming out of the bride i see sons getting ready to shine glory be to god with a spoken word in their mouth shifting things they don't even know the government doesn't even know the nations of the world don't even know who's changing things but things are changing so quickly they don't even know that the bride's doing a whole lot of it with her authority hallelujah speaking words of life and she [Music] he said that's where the church should be today the things that i do shall you also more than this shall you do for i go to my father are you still here we have a few more minutes then god always followed up every shadow and type with the antitype notice he took his own son before three witnesses i'd like for you to see how brother man he has he's just become a holy ghost theologian because he is now preaching in type and antitype my my my mind just think about it elementary school education and he has taking us to the type which is the the uh adoption process in the in the far east or middle east and now he is going to the antitype which is what makes it more real but it's not the full fulfillment an antitype is not the complete fulfillment of a type it's just another very powerful establishment of what the type is to reflect what the type is to speak about and so brother branham said and here is the antitype and he's exactly right he said then god always follows up every shadow and type with the antitype notice he took his own son before three witnesses peter james and john the inner circle hope faith and charity come on he took them before the translated the resurrected and god himself and there overshadowed him [Music] that was that was god gathering his witnesses just like the father in the adoption process took his son right down to the gate of the city so there would be lots of witnesses to see the celebration of the authority exchange all right and then he goes on and he said the bible said that his clothes glistened like the sun in its strength and then god said this is my beloved son hear ye him he said peter wanted to build three tabernacles he wanted all the sabbatarians and law keepers to have theirs he wanted all the rest of them to have theirs he wanted to break it up into denominations but god shut it up and said this is my beloved son hear ye him and when they looked they saw jesus only he didn't see three people they saw one person a triune god who had come to live in one person are you with me let's look into that just a moment now this is pretty powerful stuff here couldn't you have preached it without reading it i probably could have but it wouldn't have had the effect that this can have if you open your heart i'm not i'm not ashamed to say i can't bring it like this verse paragraph 41 he said let's look at moses moses represented the law no man can keep the law and no flesh is justified by the law i'm glad that it's not good works that we have done but it's by his grace and mercy that's brought me through how many of you know it's the truth by his foreknowledge that he foreknows us before the foundation of the world amen and then i couldn't be saved by the law he said you can't be saved by the law so if the law was weak and could not do god in due time sent his son made after the likeness of sinful by a woman born under the law that he might redeem us hello redeem sister audrey he didn't just say save us he said redeem us to take us all the way back to the father's original thoughts plan and design for our life hallelujah no wonder we sang sweet is the song sweet is the song i'm redeemed by his grace god in due time sent his son made after the likeness of sinful by a woman born under the law that he might redeem us from the curse of the law so moses god shut him off now why is he talking about moses because moses appeared here is jesus here's peter james and john and then here are two more who come from the heavenlies and manifest himself standing there on the mount of transfiguration moses representing the law and now in paragraph 42 there stood elijah he said what did elijah stand for elijah was the line of god's justice folks that's powerful talk there law and justice you may think it's the same thing but it's not the same thing law and justice now he said elijah was the lion of god's justice elijah was a stern prophet he set upon the hill under the will of god and they sent 50 men to him the captain of 50. elijah stood up and said if i be a man of god the fire fall from heaven and consume you and they went away they went the king sent another 50. elijah stands up if i be a man of god let fire fall from heaven and away win another 50. he was the line of god's justice interesting brother i never want judgment i want read it mercy rewrote my life let's have a sing along mercy rewrote my life should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy rewrote my life the law would have condemned me justice would have demanded my death but mercy stepped in come on brother isaiah brooks and get here to sing to us this year mercy stepped in is that what it's called mercy said mercy said no i'm not going to let you go i'm not going to let you slip away are you with me i'm not going to let you perish mercy is going to come to the rescue judgment listen the law has served its purpose justice serves his purpose but mercy is going to make the difference and by god's mercy he extends his grace it works together to bring us into the fullness of who god has created us to be brother branham said i want mercy god's justice would kill us everyone tonight he would demand it and we die of a shadow some people are dying because they refuse to step away from the shadow into the light the shadow serves its purpose just like the shack that we talked about tuesday night or sunday whenever it was without the shuck the seed would perish the shuck is necessary to insulate and to protect the seed but the shuck cannot inherit his life come on his life is not carried by the shock his life is only carried by the seed so the shuck serves his purpose you know people critics of this message they get upset because one time brother becomes preached away and he mentions mary being like a shuck and he wasn't calling her spiritually a shuck we know better than that because she received the holy ghost he was saying that she was like an incubator so don't get caught up in some little speaking like that and miss the whole thing because there's a whole lot listen don't you worry he might have made the slide like a man can make he might have missed a word or grabbed the wrong word or something like that but that's okay cause you're here you've got the holy ghost you've got some intelligence you know how to put it together in the word that's why listen you've got to take what you hear all the way back to the word anyway that's what the bride is commissioned and called to do and so don't you slip up with someone something like that don't let you let that throw you off just keep following the word but now as we see the law pass away and we see the justice of god pass away the sternness of his judgment pass away and then let's look over here this is my beloved son hear ye him what was it god's love god's love stood there represented in christ can anybody say amen to that oh how beautiful that is god's love represented in christ we've all sinned and come short of the glory but god's love is represented in his son he said hear ye him no matter what the law says and what this other says and what this says and what the church says hear ye him he's got a voice it's the voice of truth i'm not trying to turn this service into a musical [Music] i know how some of you feel about musicals but i can't help it i i i just i can't help it i i hear it i want to sing it i hear it i want to shout about it i hear it i want to do something about it i want to dance about it i'm sorry if that is no longer who you are but i want to be returned i tell you i want zeal and strength to worship him as i have in the past i don't want to worship him less don't turn the cameras well good you don't up here anyway but this little sister here that i'm not gonna call her name on the stream wouldn't want to do that to embarrass her anymore but um a relative of somebody who just spent some time with us and i'll just say it that way i pre i wasn't just watching you all but i'm a pastor and i watch everybody well i watch most everybody and sometimes if you watch everybody you'll be distracted but i was just and i want you to know you bless me little sister both of you really but i look back there in both of her hands and i'm so thankful not like this you know both of her hands were lifted up and she was singing the song and worshipping the lord i don't think i've ever been in a service with her in my life with her mom and dad with her dad i know for sure yes with her grandparents yes with all of her great aunts and uncles and cousins and and isis and yes all of them but i don't know if i've ever been in the service with her or not but i appreciated the fact you're in a new place and an odd place we admitted a strange place but you're coming here and because it's not about us it's not about who's it's it's a for a few moments folks it has to be about him and your your sincerity and worship blessed me i just wanted you to know that and yours does i can count on people i can count on people that no matter what's breaking down around us no matter what's going on around us there's some of you i can count on you're going to worship the lord regardless i don't ever i don't ever have to say oh my sister so-and-so has had a terrible week this week this has happened that's happened so when she comes in here today we'll have to drag her to worship i don't have that with most of the folks here in fact i can know that if they have fought hard all week long nine times out of ten they're gonna come in here with a louder praise they're gonna come in here with a higher hand lift it up hallelujah because they've learned they've let we've learned a thing or two through the years about giving god praise when it feels like there's no whoa i must be getting ready to be at the pentecostal church tonight because i feel pentecostal [Music] no matter what the law say no matter what the other says what this says what the church says hear ye him all other things will do what pass away they're all works and carnal man can't save himself no more than a leopard could lick his spots off no sir he said he can't do it god has to do it and it's the works of god by grace through foreknowledge that ordained you to eternal life and put your name on the lamb's book of life at the beginning and no man can come except my father draws him all that comes to me i'll give him everlasting life raise him up at the last day those who he has foreknew he has called those who he has called he has justified those who he has justified he have past tense already glorified in glory what you what you scared about [Music] what you scared about praise be to god what are you scared about god calls you your heart loves him as the heart h-a-r-t panted for the water book so my soul thirsts after thee oh god there it is and that was parkersburg west virginia do i have to yes i have time for another one do you have here ye him phoenix arizona paragraph 37 now you see jesus had proven to god don't let that throw you that's what this whole process of adoption was about he was proving himself the only difference is the father knew how it's going to turn out in that natural adoption process you know you could you could have a dude come on now your eldest son could be a dude well i'll give you an example of a son being a dud not the oldest son but you know that prodigal he turned out to be a dude until he got himself back to father's house so the father wasn't out there putting a signet ring on him when he was out there in the in the uh pigpen but when he saw him coming home he then said i'm gonna put some authority on him then he's not coming in here like a servant he's a son and i'm going to treat him like a son until he manifests who he is as a son that's trust that's real trust but you can have a son brother venom told us that in these some of these quotes you can have a son that that cares about himself he doesn't care about the things of god doesn't care about father's business you can get some kind of hippie musician to come along or something he don't care anything about running father's business all he wants to do is run from set to set long-haired hippie you know running from one guitar jam to the next thinking he's going to make his living starving musician you don't care anything about the inheritance that's waiting on i wish you'd help me he don't care nothing about that just let it all go i don't care i don't care anything about my heritage i don't care anything about my hard-working daddy i don't care anything about what he's trying to leave me i just want to be me and you've got the world screaming do your own thing be your own man follow your dream you can do whatever you want to do don't live somebody else's expectations of who you you go and do your own thing so no wonder so many duds get produced in an hour like this who don't care anything about what has been worked hard to provide for them you ought to say amen so it can't happen but here's one that proved himself i'm telling you the the type is clear the antitype is clearer we know what god has done we know what's been laid out here for us you see jesus had proven to god that he'd been the right kind of son and god took him up on the top of the mountain brought witnesses out there heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses and he clothed him in immortality [Music] now how could he be clothed in immortality and then go right down there to cross and die oh [Music] he didn't die that body that he was given to live in that's what died i want you to know jesus was never dead never never never never dead he lived he walked down through the corridors of the underworld come on leading captivity captive giving gifts unto men he knew exactly what the work was that had to be completed and finished all right he goes on and his garments when they looked up he was clothed in immortality and when they looked up they said his garments shine like the sun a supernatural something taken place his garments glistened like the sun in its middle of the day as wide as they could be god placed on him that robe of immortality showing that he had received him that's the thing that god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it that's why it's important to stay with the word that's why grandma's religion is only authentic if it's based on the word if it's not based on the word she missed it that doesn't mean she's lost it means she walked in what god let her see but don't you let that be your stopping place if he's calling you to more truth follow follow with everything you've got he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ he will place into the church all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanting his work done he sent into his he sent it into his son the son wanting the work done send it into the church at that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father in me and i in you and you and me you hear the words of jesus coming to pass you hear what jesus was talking about now it's made possible because the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost he said all that day at that day because the same power of god was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ the same power that rested in jesus christ rested in the placed sons in the body of christ paragraph 38 placing of a son take him out into a certain place have a ceremony before angels place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority he says let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this not on the very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak though hallelujah hallelujah there'll be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself it will create itself right there you talk about materialization you talk about the word of god being spoken and then cells and molecules beginning to move around obeying that word and creating recreating and creating i want you to know brother curry has lost things parts portions systems in his body that can never be replaced in the natural but if it could be the will of god god is more than able to create what needs to be created [Applause] it's coming it's coming this manifestation is coming i'm only saying it's coming because all we have seen of it thus far is a little here a little there and a little the other but that's enough that's enough that's not brother that's enough sister to keep me believing it's enough it's enough to cause me to believe that what god did a little here and a little there he is more more more and able hallelujah he's more than able to do it again beyond beyond what we could even think or even imagine if you believe that give god some praise hallelujah yes call it a carrot on a stick call it anything you want to but what i have seen god do is enough to make me keep believing for the manifestation of the moar hallelujah that's why there's a church of people down there in louisiana this morning believing god for a miracle that the doctor says is impossible sister karen pruitt's brain bleed is active again and she's been unconscious since monday and the doctors have said this is all we can do and it may possibly be i heard brother who would say this may possibly be it may possibly be that my life on this earth is about to change it could be that this about that she would cross over but refusing to camp around such an idea we continue to believe and know is there anybody in this room that believes jesus could walk into that room is there anybody in here that believes he could walk over there to a mobile home just a few miles from here and touch our brother i know he is i know he's able i know he's able i know he's able brother see if you're hearing this i won't apologize to you of what i'm saying about to say i won't apologize to you cause i don't want you to hear turn it off i don't want you to hear it but someone asked me recently said what are you gonna do if you have to say something in his funeral one day i said i will if they ask me i will if i if i outlive him that won't be hard because that could be ten years if jesus tears listen folks we're not sitting over here a bunch of dummies we know that there is a change of this body we know that death is a doorway we know that the saints of god stepped through that doorway we know that one day our work here on this earth is ended we know that one day we have to uh pass from this life into the next when he calls us but we just don't believe the devil gets to choose that day in that hour we believe that god chooses that day and that hour i'll tell you something else i believe i don't believe you have to be sick to cross that river i believe it ought to be among the sons of god that we go to sleep and we don't wake up i don't believe that it should be that we waste away i saw it i saw it with my own grandmother i saw how she lost weight but she didn't waste away i saw that laying in that casket she looked like somebody that had just had chicken and dumplings she didn't look like somebody uh emesiated and twisted up by death and by disease it didn't look like to me i though my heart was breaking because i didn't want to say goodbye but it didn't look to me like death had won a victory it looked to me like jesus had called and she had made the crossing and you're going to make it one day and i'm going to make it one day and brother steve curry's going to make it one day but you do not have to just sit down and settle that because the doctor said there's no more we can do here and no more we can do there oh king jesus oh i gotta go we have to oh king jesus what he can do what he can do what he can do he can walk in a room and everything changes any good yes there will be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers like that coming in the church now i know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness listen listen you can't have this in the divided people you can have this power in a divided people we must understand that we do not have to be unified in opinion we do not have to be unified in our fashion sense because some people have none they look at what they they put it together and they think whoa i am really styling and profiling somebody else looks at it and thinks my tornado blew through the bedroom and you just picked up the first thing you found brother branham said at the end of the day that don't matter he said i might have stripes dots my trousers he said that that's not what i'm after so we don't have to be unified and i'm going to tell you something i i'm just going to be honest with you i love fancy hairdos on sisters i'm just being honest i'm not gonna wear one i love it i love it i love it when the sister takes a little extra time why are you so quiet i love it i love going into whataburger with you when your curls is just right i love it because i believe it's a badge of god's glory i believe a woman's hair is given to her for a covering that's new testament teaching and if you want to get real specific first corinthians 11 says her long hair it's given her her covering so if for me it is not necessary that she put a rag on it for me it's not necessary that you cover it with a with a prayer covering aura or a veil or or whatever else somebody's getting into but it is important for her to have a covering and her husband is her covering spiritually if she has one and that long hair on her head is a testimony that she's living under submission to god's divine order doesn't mean she's walking afraid of her husband it means she's submitting to god's order for her life and when a sister takes a little time with that glory i believe there's power on a woman's head because of her long hair be honest somebody said how long is long what if your hair can't grow then god knows that he sees that he understands that and yours is just as beautiful as somebody else's who grow it's not that but there's power on a woman's head when she's willing to take god at his word now this is going out everywhere everybody's hearing this my email and inbox and everything will be just i i do i do i'm not going to tell you but everybody's not going to have the same uh you just get some of these young sisters i'll tell you they can do amazing things you get the pain girls and some of the rest of these uh uh charity i don't i don't know who all does it i'm never there they don't invite me when they do the wedding hairs but i love it sister flo i love seeing it i love seeing those sisters put that up do something with it and it'd be beautiful but everybody don't have the skill to do that everybody don't have the fashion sense to dress a certain way and look a certain way those things don't matter we may never be unified in in our our say for instance i might like to get my news off of newsmax and you may think that is just as bad as fox and you may choose we may never be unified in every part of what we do you may like vinyl of planking for your floor that may be what you can have but that's not what we wanted we are we had solid wood floor brother greeley put solid wood floor down they insurance company come in there and wanted us to use the the vinyl plate they told us it's in million dollar homes that didn't matter to us we weren't trying to be somebody we weren't we were just trying not to be beat out by the insurance company we wanted comparable to what we paid for already and you know what it took a while still not finished i mean it amazing when they can do the whole house except about five feet in the just right what you step into when you come into the house all the way to the fireplace it's not finished yet but it don't matter we're just learning love we we didn't want to settle and we didn't have to but everybody don't like the same thing some people like big windows and other women look at those big windows and they say i don't want that big window in my house something for me to have to clean we don't have to be alike in every like and dislike we don't have to see eye to eye on every little facet of life but when we come into this house we must be able everybody from the pastor down to lay aside everything that divides us our hurt feelings of the past our mistreatment of the past whatever has happened in the past when we come in here we must come unified to stand on that word because there'll be unbelievers among us there'll be meg believers among us there'll be newcomers that come along and they need to see god in the fullness of his power they don't need to just hear me talk about what he can do they need to stay and do it [Music] [Applause] and so you and i must come to a place and i'm telling you what it won't be by washing one another's feet that we get there it'll not be by having dinner necessarily one another will get there it'll only be by it's finding a place before god on our knees on our faces and laying it all before him and letting him give back to us what matters and keep what matters not in the economy of god's kingdom we got to get all that out we're not near there we got to get all of that out it all has to be out and you i can do mine you can do yours if you'll spend your time i'll spend my time you do your carpet time i'll do my carpet time and god will let us come together and stand on this word in oneness with him in oneness with the word in oneness with one another hallelujah hallelujah there will be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen like that say unto the mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said shall come to pass you can have what you've said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church the critics mouths will be shut listen that is talking about out there there should be no critics among us we shouldn't be critics of one another in no shape form or fashion you don't like my socks i'll never make you wear them you understand i hear people grumbling among i don't i don't hear it firsthand because a lot of people won't do that they'll send it there's people who know just who to grumble in front of just be honest because they don't get back people grumbling about this or that that's too loud that's not loud enough this i can't even sit during worship i can't do this i can't do that listen here's what you need to know we'll never please everybody and some of you are extremely difficult to please just ask your husband just ask your wife just ask somebody that loves you and so if you come in here with an attitude because of that you will set an atmosphere that's why i believe in being a church on time i believe people dragging in from here and there and all through the service i believe it sets an atmosphere you don't have to say well don't because you'll get in trouble i believe it creates an atmosphere that we need to improve upon i believe it shows something i believe the way people sit in church brother can make a difference i do i believe if people come into a church and slouch it creates an atmosphere of i don't care how many of you would do that in a job interview how many of you would go before someone who you wanted to hire you and you would slouch down in the chair until your neck was resting on the back of the chair and you and you just just acted like that like you could just hardly move what we don't understand is because of who we are we carry something because of who we are we carry something and everything we do the way we move the way we talk it says stuff it speaks didn't your mama ever tell you actions speak louder than words that's why i tell people that come into the house of god and trim their fingernails during the preaching i say that is disrespectful to the house of god do that before you come when people see you they see that you are not engaged they see that you are not putting your effort in and it's easier for them to take the same position come on somebody said well i don't think you ought to be wasting our time telling you that listen i am the watchman no matter how many times i resign between sunday to sunday i still have to get right up here and do my job if i was just harping and carrying on and i didn't think there was anything to it i would be afraid of what god might do to me but because i have watched these things for so many years now we were sitting at our table yes bless him lord he needs it bless pastor shelly we were sitting at our breakfast table this week and we were talking a little bit i was talking to this some of them about how these things came into the pentecostal church and what a change it made little things little things you realize that the pentecostal church has gone from an era we weren't talking about fear so i'll tell you what we were talking about we're talking about cutting bangs i remember when they came and asked the elders of the church if it was all right for them to cut their veins i know brother branham i know brother branham's daughters i know this i know that just like you do but i was there when they come and ask the elders could we start this was women with long hair never put scissors in there and they and they said can we come and start well i ain't going back after you leave here today you may go out here saying i'm never going back to that church but i want you to know before you go we love you you've tuned in we love you we're not trying to hurt anybody condemn anybody i'm telling you the problem is i've lived long enough now to see how things can creep creep and sometimes we preach on things that aren't aren't so relevant to us praying that we can see what is they come and they said we just need to do a little bit we just need to fix it they're just something and the elder said well i don't guess there'll be no islam i don't know i don't care there's no harm in that i get i don't get to be and so the next thing you know it got more and more and more and they didn't just fool with the front they started working on the back yes that's right it may not matter to you it matters to me and according to first corinthians chapter 11 it belongs it matters to god so be careful be careful be careful how you respond and so it got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and now it's just like the prophet said a woman that was going to wash jesus's feet with her hair from the pentecostal church today would beat her brains out because she wears the haircut of a man there's no separation at all and it didn't start that way it started by people thinking i don't have to do just like they're i can i can i can set a trend i can put baubles around my neck i can do this i can do that i don't have to be just like and the next thing you know it creates an undercurrent and an atmosphere that brings a people out of function and out of joint and i'm telling you we may never agree on all those things all right i recognize it we may not all agree on those things but what we need to understand is when we come into this house we don't bring our differences with us we come to stand on the word together how many of you would like to see a son of god raise up i'd like for it to be among you i'd like for to be in the pew how many of you like to see a son of god raise up speak the creative word of god and watch it materialize because the people were able to put their differences aside when they got in the presence of god and catch the inspiration of the hour and by the spoken word create a digestive system that can do what it was created to do by the creative spoken word of god take a tumor right out of a body [Music] you you you might not believe it i'm closing musicians coming you may not believe it but with my very own eyes i've seen people cough tumors out of their mouth i want to look at once you i want to make sure you know i'm not lying to you i've seen it myself cough up tumors and and spit them out in their hand i've seen growths fall off of people's bodies under a false message preaching a trinitarian doctrine baptizing people in titles but i saw those things in my life i saw blind eyes open and deaf ears unstopped and crippled i saw that little missy with a broken back who came into the tent meeting over there at 8 100 cooper creek road in a back brace the doctor said she'd wear it prob might have to wear it the rest of her life because the break was so bad and god came down under that tent and healed that little girl they took that brace off for her and she ran up cooper creek road i saw that boy in in evansville indiana where the weed eater had taken out his eyes and he was blind and he believed god and god recreated eyes and let him see and brought his whole family to god i've seen garter swallowed i've seen tumors in women's bellies disappear and their dresses you'd have thought they were pregnant i can give you names you'd have thought they were pregnant because their dress is tinted out just like that because they carry tumors some from their reproductive organs some from their stomach and i've seen god heal them and caused those tomb or no kicking not even jack coe style just holy ghost prayer and i've seen those tumors disappear brother richard and it would have been like somebody stuck a pen in a in a beach ball laying flat on the floor and their belly's sticking up like that and all of a sudden you may think this is vulgar i've seen women grab their underclothes to get out the door to the bathroom because the tumor got was gone and because their their underclothes were four or five sizes too big now with the tumor gone and they didn't want to walk down the aisle and lose their drawers now if you think that's i don't care right now how it sounded i tell you you'd like to see that too and dresses they'd have to hold her dress up like this because it was so big that now it hung and it'd be hanging down like this and then have to hold it and go out the door like this let me tell you something that's what god can do and i want to say again that was where's the rest of the musicians [Music] that was under a half truth it was holiness it was separated living but we didn't have the message of the hour we didn't have the godhead we didn't have the right order for baptism we didn't understand those things and yet god moved because people came together in faith come on now i saw the dead raised i know what god can do i know what he's able to do and i'm not looking for a show i'm not desiring a show i'm not even hoping for a show what i'm hoping is to see god's sons place so that we can see people transform i had a woman to write me this week i hope i don't offend this woman for saying this she said brother shelly my daughter's 11 years old and she tells me that she's a lesbian would you please pray would you pray for her i don't even know how to help her i don't even know what to say to her really i've said everything i know to say and i don't know what else to say to her but she's so mad at me because i won't let her dress like a boy and she's so mad at me because i won't let her call herself another name and she's so mad at me and she said i honestly wonder brother shelly if she might try to take my life because she is so angry with me my heart crumbles into a thousand pieces when i think of a mother's pain i know there's a heliwood i know there's an agenda out there that tells us we have to be accepting and tolerant and understanding of this and that and the other and and we should be more in the church it needs to be i understand all that but i want to tell you something you'll never sell that baloney you'll never sell that lie to the mother that reached out to me oh she sees as a girl that's about to make choices when she's old enough that will change her life and some that she may never be able to fight her way back through brother when i hear something like that i say oh god that you'll never talk that spirit off that girl you'll never counsel that spirit off that girl it's out to destroy her that devil didn't come to confuse her he came to kill her and you'll never talk him off you'll never push him back with an article there's only one thing that'll ever set that little girl free and that's a son of god being placed in his position to use the word of god against that devil most of us would be so afraid of offending and hurting her feelings and her running out of the church most people would be so afraid of how in the world you're going to handle a situation like that that they wouldn't even understand that what we do is like putting a bottle of their mouth we need a power of god let me tell you something that's worth laying down every axe that's worth burying every hatchet that's worth getting all of our opinions out of the way that's worth singing a song you don't like and enduring a worship leader you don't like and sitting under a pastor you don't like that's worth all of that if we could just get to a place where sons of god could be placed in this church among us i do not believe that everybody will chew the the meat the the meal that's been laid before you today i do not expect that they will i expect that there will be critics out there but we better stand on the word in here say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart my but believe what you said shall come to pass you can have what you've said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then critics mouse will be shut it'll be a short time jesus comes right off the mountain went straight to calvary he come right off the mountain went straight to calvary it'll be a short time it'll be a short time it'll be a short time it'll be a short time jesus come right off the mountain went straight to calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be here where's here where's here where the bride is that was 1960 five years later brother branham's off the scene that hero be where the bride is it won't just be phoenix arizona when he preached that message it'll be wherever the bride's gathered in his name let's stand let's stand whoa about seven pages we'll never get to god is good oh he's good i want to sing this i hope i can sing this tonight i want to sing i'm going to the enemy's camp i hope we can sing it this morning i'm going to try to sing it and help you and help me if you want to oh i don't guess i really need this do i let's sing that i'm going to the enemy's camp i'm going to take back what he stole from me how many of you are taking inventory of your heart this morning would you would you take inventory of your life this morning i want to say this to every one of you from the bottom of my heart i am not against you like some of you have come to believe i am for you i want to see your success in him i'm tired of battling spirits that i shouldn't have to battle in the house of god but i am for you i'm for your children i'm for your families i want to see them overcome i'm praying with you about your loved ones in other places i want to see revival break out in their lives even if it never breaks out in their churches may it break out in their homes and you get enough of them together and it'll come to the church you'll get enough people ready to come in and worship like some of you came in here today to worship well i'm not a flag waver then sit and twiddle your thumbs in jesus name but don't get your nose out of joint because somebody is just don't let those things just don't let those things just don't let those things just don't let them just don't let them i can't help myself then you're out of control that means you need the holy ghost you say i can't help myself you need the holy ghost you're out of control you're out of control there might be a pill that will help you for a while but it won't help you with that problem forever only the holy ghost will help you with that you're out of control if you cannot control yourself to get above to rise above to move above some of the things the enemy sends to distract you in a service if you don't make up your mind i didn't come to be seen or to see i came to lift up and magnify and glorify the name of jesus i came to put in my so be it to the word of god and if we can do that if we can do that you take inventory like i have like i am i found a place in me this week where fear was laying and i didn't know it oh i don't believe it i did i yes yes i didn't know it just play something i didn't know it was laying there like that i mean i know on occasion anybody can get afraid but i found a place in me a silly little place where fear was laying and i went after it i didn't say anything to my family they knew i'd been struggling some this week i don't like change any more than anybody else i like knowing where my handkerchiefs are and they knew i was just struggling i i let it somehow affect me you know you carry it it wouldn't bother you some of you wouldn't bother you you just all you could see is the nice floors i will i'd like to be like you but it just threw me kind of out of sorts and i was struggling to get through it but i didn't say anything to my family about this but i saw a little place where fear was laying in me and you know when god pointed it out to me he tried to show me i realized this morning he tried to show me a couple times this week when i was praying but i didn't get the message but where i was able to identify this morning is when we started singing the voice of truth and we came to that line surrounded by surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors shaking in their armor wishing they to have the strength to stay if that don't get you these weren't philistines these were the children of god these were israelites and now all they can do is stand there and tremble in their armor wishing that they could have been the one to run out and meet the challenge and i found a place i really put my finger on a place where i was afraid to meet a challenge and i gave it to god i gave it to god under the inspiration of the words of that song i gave it to god there's a voice of truth there's a voice of truth there's a voice of truth that says you can take inventory of your life right now and see if you need to go and get some things that belong to you see if you need to take back some things that belong to you that's what we're going to do i know you're playing soft cause that's what i ask you to do but i want to i want to sing this song now i'm going to the enemies cam well i'm going to the enemy's camp i'm going to take back what he stole from me i'm going to the enemy's camp to proclaim my victory i've got him under my feet under my feet under my feet is under my feet i'm claiming the victory clamp it out come on let's say well i'm going to the enemy's camp i'm gonna take back what he stole from me i'm going to the enemy's camp to proclaim my victory i've got him under my feet under my feet under my feet he's under my feet i'm claiming the victory [Music] well i'm going to the enemies camp to proclaim [Music] i've got him under my feet come on under my feet under my feet he's under my feet [Music] me well i'm going to the enemy's camp to proclaim my victory i've got him under my feet under my feet under my only you know what he's stolen from you but he's going to the end of his camp [Music] have you really got the enemy under your feet i'm asking you i'm waiting for your answer have you really got the enemy under your feet you can you're the only one that can put him there i can't put him there for you you can't put him there for me but the word has given you authority over that enemy the word has given you authority over that enemy and if you're taking inventory of your life right now and you recognize there's some missing stuff there are some things that have been stolen off your shelf i've been reading in the neighborhood watch around here where people are their security cameras are picking up people coming in their yard they're they're scouting it out at night two and three o'clock in the morning coming to see if they can come in to see if there's a way to get in and some of them have those cameras you speak speak through you know and you see them running off i don't like the thought of that but i know what you can you can certainly put some blood around your house you can certainly put the word of god around that you can certainly claim the victory over that you can believe god to try in his word in his name the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and are saying i'm not going to let fear get in my heart about that but there's an enemy one you can't pick up on the security camera who's lurching who's see seeking around roaming around seeking whom he may devour he's looking if he hasn't got your stuff yet he wants to take your joy he wants to take your victory he wants to take your vision he wants to take your desire not that he's going to do anything with it he just don't want you to have a desire for more of god and only you can find it's not my place i can lay it out there i can give examples but it's your place to find out what the enemy is pulling over on you and it's your place to take the name of jesus and the word of god and the blood that god created for redemption and apply those weapons against the lies of the enemy there's a voice of truth that says something else there's a voice of truth that says something else and we're not going to hold you any longer than this but i want to invite those of you who can take a quick inventory who can see that there are some missing things in your life things you've once had in christ things you once used and enjoyed and part of who you are in christ and the enemy has somehow buffeted you and he's been able to slip that out from under your nose it's true because if we're watching if we're watching the only way he can do it's right under our nose you know be nice if we think about him just slipping in at night but that's not really the way it works against the bride of christ i'm telling you he knows better than that sometimes he waits until we're vulnerable right till we got a wounded lick and then he comes right walking in the door that's right yes sir right up to us selling us a bill of goods and we're weak and we take that and we don't realize that it's just like sticking a a pen in something in a slow like you get a little i'll get in a minute a little tack in your tire not a big old nail but a little tack in your tire and it'll go and go it'll leak slow and slow and slow and slow you'll fill it up and it'll leak out again and i'll tell you the enemy knows how to work amen and he does it so that you'll get used to doing it you know you what you'll put off getting your tire fixed you'll you'll put more air in it some people would rather put more air in it a time and time again than to take it down there and get it fixed am i telling the truth there are people like that the enemy takes advantage of people like that you recognize something's leaking out but you won't do anything about it you'd rather just keep filling it up from time to time no no no no why don't you find the brad why don't you find the tack why don't you find the nail why don't you find the vulnerability in your life why don't you find the leaky place and say no more no more there's a voice of truth that tells me i can walk in victory that's right there's a voice of truth that says i can stand on the word and be what god has called me to be if you want to come i'm inviting you you don't have to come but if you want to come you're welcome to come and stand around the front of this church as we get ready to go home in a few moments or get ready to move to the next service let me invite all of you who can to be with us tonight at the pentecostal church in lagrange i've never ministered there before but brother curry has invited me to come many times tonight is the night that god has arranged us to be there we would like to have you come and worship with us help create an atmosphere for deliverance in that place needs to be met in that place consider yourself thoroughly invited but if you'd like to come and just say lord i need i need some i got some missing things some leaky areas of my life don't you look around to see who else is coming you come if you feel it if you feel it come you don't feel it then nobody would want you to just play along but if you feel like there's something that you need to deal with you can deal with it nobody's going to come far as i know nobody's going to come around this is not a prayer line this is just a time for you to say i want back i want to take back i want to take back what the enemy has stolen from me are you still with me church all right let us just go to the lord in prayer right now let's go to the lord in prayer every one of us right where you are they'll play something together it doesn't have to be bad it can be something else but let's just go to prayer every one of us and let's talk to the lord about it father we stand here today stirred by your word stirred by the truth that you have shown us today we're thankful for what you've spoken to us in the word and through the message of the hour and lord we recognize that the enemy has succeeded in some of our lives of stealing some victory some joy some peace he has come and he has slipped out some things that we need things that are constructive to create the right atmosphere for our family for our home for our spiritual life and so we come today saying lord we need grace to take it back the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy but your word says that you have come that we might have life and that we might have it more abundantly and we don't want to spend more time focusing on what the enemy does we want to spend more of our time focusing on the what the goodness of the lord is doing and what he's accomplishing so we ask right now for the wisdom of the lord to be upon each of us that we would be able to identify every area of our life where the enemy has taken something that we have once walked in we would like to get our eyes on some things that we have never walked in but until we until we can get back what we have had walked in in the past what you've given us in the past the victory that we've known the liberty the freedom that we've once known that driving passion that drives us to set ourselves under the word and to make every part of who we are come into obedience to that word until we get transfigured by it changed by it lord some of us have missed that it has been absent from our lives for some time now but we are asking you oh god to stir up a passion for the word for the message of the hour stir up a passion lord drive us to the tapes let there be something in us we just can't get enough of your word so that when we do come in here we are ready to receive everything you have for us we know the enemy is a thief we know he's sly we know he's a trickster but greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world so we say to that enemy give back take your filthy hands off every promise of god is yea and amen and we claim it personally in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ i want you to just give god thanks i want you to thank him in faith i want you to thank him believing that it's his desire to restore it's his desire to pour into you what the enemy tries to drain out of your life it's his desire to revive you and refill you and renew you so that your strength is renewed like the eagle and i know this song may not be everybody's cup of tea but i want us to sing it again because i want the enemy to know this isn't a passing moment for us we're going to pursue this we're going to pursue it in prayer this week we're going to pursue it in positioning our lives to get back what the enemy has stolen from us well i'm going to the enemy's cam i'm gonna take my what he stole from me well i'm going to the enemy's camp to proclaim my victory i've got him under my feet [Music] claiming [Music] i know you can

reach down your mighty hand heal the sick deliver the oppressed lord i pray for a mother whose heart is breaking today who's reached out on behalf of an 11 year old daughter who's confused and who is harassed by an enemy that wants to destroy her and we know lord you're the answer let the voice of truth shout to that girl let the voice of truth shout to that girl until she's awakened from that

we could be used every one of us let our sisters go with hugs and with prayer that they might be a blessing and let our young brothers and our brothers go and encourage the men who are standing there

missouri may god just grant them safety on these very very dangerous highways and i appreciate those of you who have been praying for them and there were some warnings and different things that came up from different individuals and we just took that to god in very sincere prayer and i know that to many of them took it very seriously and they uh were very careful and watchful and prayed together as a family that god would watch over them listen the enemy wants to throw a a cog in the wheel he wants to throw a wrench and he he really wants to hinder things may god give us great grace and wisdom i want you to sing with me a verse in a chorus of victory in jesus and when we finish the chorus consider yourself dismissed we don't normally take a lot of fellowship in the sanctuary but i
