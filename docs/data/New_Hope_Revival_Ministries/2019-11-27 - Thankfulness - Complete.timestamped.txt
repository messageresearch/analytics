[0:01] the Bible says in Psalm 100 make a
[0:05] joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands
[0:10] serve the Lord with gladness come before
[0:13] his presence with singing know ye that
[0:17] the Lord he is God it is he that hath
[0:21] made us and not we ourselves we are his
[0:25] people and the Sheep of his pasture
[0:28] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[0:32] and into his courts with praise be
[0:38] thankful unto Him and bless his name for
[0:43] the Lord is good
[0:45] his mercy is everlasting and his truth
[0:49] endureth to all generations what a
[0:54] timeless song
[0:56] the psalmist sung to the Lord and it is
[1:00] recorded for you and I it's a psalm that
[1:05] I go back to many times in my life not
[1:09] just when I'm entering into the house of
[1:11] the Lord but when I'm approaching God in
[1:15] prayer in my private devotion I want to
[1:19] always come in giving thanks I want to
[1:23] talk to you for just a few minutes today
[1:25] about giving thanks we're entering into
[1:30] the holiday season and that means so
[1:34] many different things for different
[1:35] people from Thanksgiving all the way to
[1:40] Hanukkah Christmas the new year it seems
[1:43] to be a period of a couple of months
[1:46] where people are getting together
[1:49] fellowshipping with family enjoying good
[1:53] food I want to encourage you don't leave
[1:56] the Lord out of your festivities take
[2:00] every opportunity that you can to be
[2:04] grateful I believe maybe it's a cliche
[2:08] that's being worn out a little bit in
[2:10] some circles but I believe that an added
[2:14] of gratitude determines your altitude I
[2:18] want to share with you a portion of
[2:21] Scripture that is a scripture often used
[2:25] to describe the end times it's in 2nd
[2:29] Timothy chapter 3 and verse 1 this know
[2:34] also that in the last days perilous
[2:38] times shall come
[2:41] that word perilous is fierce hard
[2:45] difficult times for men shall be lovers
[2:49] of their own selves covetous boasters
[2:53] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[2:59] unthankful which means ungrateful unholy
[3:05] which means opposing that which is
[3:08] sacred or having no reverence without
[3:12] natural affection which means
[3:15] hard-hearted unfeeling without regard
[3:18] for others trucebreakers false accusers
[3:22] incontinent which means having no
[3:26] self-control
[3:27] driven by appetites and passions fierce
[3:31] which means savage or brutal traitors
[3:38] heavy which means reckless rash
[3:42] headstrong high-minded which means
[3:46] conceited or puffed up
[3:48] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[3:51] god having a form of godliness but
[3:55] denying the power thereof from such turn
[3:59] away this is the Apostle Paul speaking
[4:03] to his spiritual son Timothy he is
[4:07] describing some dark spirits that will
[4:11] show up in the end time we have every
[4:16] reason to believe when we examine these
[4:18] verses of Scripture that Paul was not
[4:21] just speaking to Timothy about the
[4:23] atmosphere of the world in the end time
[4:27] but he was also describing spirits that
[4:30] would be launched against the Church of
[4:34] the Lord Jesus Christ some of these
[4:37] conditions or attributes that we just
[4:40] read to you are present in our churches
[4:44] around the world today
[4:47] fierce conceited heady highminded
[4:53] disrespectful or disobedient to parents
[4:55] on how having no reverence for God are
[5:01] the things of God but I find it's so
[5:04] amazing that tucked in all of those very
[5:07] serious problems is the word unthankful
[5:13] right in the midst of violence right in
[5:18] the midst of not having natural
[5:20] affection is unthankful it seems that
[5:26] we're living in a generation of
[5:28] ingratitude we take for granted so many
[5:33] of the blessings that we enjoy in our
[5:36] lives I live in the United States of
[5:39] America I don't know where you're
[5:41] watching this
[5:42] but in our nation we have lots of
[5:45] problems but we are so blessed to have
[5:50] the freedoms that we have to worship God
[5:54] according to the dictator of our heart
[5:56] and by the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[6:00] and I want to take time to be thankful
[6:03] to be grateful to God we have the
[6:07] opportunity in America that if we work
[6:10] hard we can earn enough money in most
[6:13] cases to pay our bills and have a pretty
[6:17] good life if that's what we choose but
[6:20] it's not just to America we owe our
[6:22] gratitude ultimately it's to God our
[6:26] Creator our Savior the one who cares so
[6:30] much for us if this is indeed a
[6:33] generation of ingratitude
[6:35] we need to know what that word means it
[6:38] means having a lack of proper
[6:41] appreciation it means not having enough
[6:45] thanks for something that you have
[6:47] received what it really means is that we
[6:51] are not valuing the blessings like we
[6:55] should we take our breath our health our
[6:58] strength the blessing on our home and
[7:01] family we take it for granted and Paul
[7:05] was warning his spiritual son Timothy
[7:08] that one of those dark spirits that
[7:12] would show up in the end time to rob the
[7:16] church of its power leaving the church
[7:20] with a structure of godliness a form of
[7:23] godliness
[7:24] we often say the right things but
[7:28] stripping the church of its real power I
[7:31] believe there is power in being thankful
[7:36] I believe there is power in praise I
[7:40] believe that one of the ways that we
[7:43] demonstrate our faith is when we are
[7:47] appraiser there are only two kinds of
[7:50] people in the world after all
[7:52] complainers and Prazeres I'd like to ask
[7:56] you the question which are you you say
[8:00] that's getting a little personal well
[8:02] I'm asking myself the same question in
[8:05] fact I'm making a list of the things
[8:08] that I need to be more thankful for we
[8:13] always have those items that are high on
[8:16] the list that we most often thank the
[8:19] Lord for but I made a list of things
[8:23] that I take for granted every single day
[8:26] of my life
[8:27] and I want to take some special time to
[8:30] stop and say Lord I want to thank you
[8:33] for what you are providing for me and I
[8:36] want to take an opportunity to stop
[8:39] looking over the blessings and give you
[8:42] praise in all things when we look at
[8:47] this we wonder is
[8:48] is being unthankful as serious as
[8:52] perhaps not having natural affection or
[8:58] being heady conceded high-minded well
[9:04] according to the Apostle it's right
[9:07] there in the list we don't know for sure
[9:11] that Paul was listing these attributes
[9:14] of sin of the spiritual environment and
[9:19] condition of the end time if he was
[9:22] listing them in the order of their
[9:24] importance but we have to remember how
[9:27] the Apostles and the patriarchs wrote
[9:32] the scripture the Bible tells us they
[9:35] did it as they were moved upon by the
[9:38] Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth some of
[9:42] the writers used to scribe they spoke
[9:45] under inspiration of the Holy Spirit and
[9:48] a scribe would write it down perhaps the
[9:51] Apostle Paul did his own writing because
[9:54] many of the epistles were written from
[9:57] prison where he was all alone in
[10:01] solitary confinement suffering and yet
[10:06] writing some of the most precious truths
[10:08] that we have in the entire Bible we
[10:12] don't know if Paul was making the list
[10:15] by putting first the things that were
[10:18] most important but what we do know is as
[10:20] the Spirit of God would bring one of
[10:24] these conditions or attributes to his
[10:27] mind he would write it down when I look
[10:32] at the list I notice that he has listed
[10:36] unthankful above unholy that word unholy
[10:42] remember it means opposing God are not
[10:45] showing a proper respect or reverence to
[10:50] the things of God the Bible tells us
[10:53] that having this sense of the holy and
[10:55] of holiness is vitally important in
[10:58] Hebrews 12 verse 14 follow
[11:02] with all men and holiness without which
[11:06] no man shall see the Lord so if the
[11:09] scripture is clear to tell us that
[11:12] without holiness we will not be able to
[11:15] see the Lord and if being unthankful is
[11:18] even listed above unholy I wonder what
[11:23] the judgment is I wonder what happens to
[11:26] those who cooperate with that spirit of
[11:30] ingratitude I challenge you today to
[11:34] move against that spirit in your life
[11:37] take more time to be thankful I'm not
[11:42] talking about just being cheesy I'm not
[11:44] talking about just words coming out of
[11:47] your mouth I'm talking about a lifestyle
[11:51] now in America we celebrate the holiday
[11:54] of Thanksgiving we think about the
[11:57] founding of America we think about the
[12:00] Pilgrims and the Indians etc but the
[12:04] truth is if they were celebrating
[12:06] something it's very likely that they
[12:08] were celebrating the Feast of
[12:10] Tabernacles because those early Puritans
[12:13] who came from Europe they understood the
[12:16] importance of remembering the Feast of
[12:19] the Bible but they had so much to be
[12:22] thankful for many years later our
[12:24] president declared and made a day of
[12:28] Thanksgiving as a national holiday a
[12:31] prophet brother branham from the last
[12:34] generation called it the only Christian
[12:36] holiday because it's one that is totally
[12:40] geared to giving God thanks now I know
[12:42] today that most people think of it more
[12:46] as turkey day but I want you to know
[12:49] it's much much more than a fine meal
[12:51] because a lot of us are blessed to enjoy
[12:53] fine food every day of the year it's a
[12:57] time to be grateful to express our
[13:01] thanks to God not only for the turkey
[13:04] and trimmings but for every good
[13:07] blessing every good and perfect gift
[13:11] that cometh down from above from the
[13:14] father of life
[13:15] I believe there is a strong trend to
[13:20] live a life of ingratitude and in order
[13:24] to break that cycle we're going to have
[13:26] to be praisers and not complainers
[13:30] we're warned in verse 5 that from such
[13:36] such as display these attributes we
[13:41] should turn away because it's a very
[13:45] serious thing to come under the the
[13:48] influence of any of these individual
[13:51] spirits and sometimes people who are
[13:55] under the influence of something
[13:57] negative or dark they come into
[14:00] agreement it seems like with something
[14:02] that's going on bad in someone else's
[14:05] life and sort of a coalition is formed
[14:08] and we have to be careful that we that
[14:10] we don't come under the influence of
[14:12] someone however none of us can take the
[14:16] moral high road in this situation
[14:18] because every one of us can certainly
[14:23] look at our lives and identify areas
[14:25] where we have just failed to take
[14:29] appropriate time to praise God to thank
[14:34] God to be grateful to God for all of his
[14:37] many blessings so I'm not going to focus
[14:40] on pulling myself away right now
[14:42] I'm gonna focus on asking the Lord to
[14:46] give me help grace to find those areas
[14:50] that I have never taken the moment to be
[14:55] thankful for and given him praise for
[14:58] and do it now it's not always convenient
[15:02] giving thanks are giving praise is not
[15:05] always convenient and it's not always
[15:08] based on our present circumstances the
[15:13] same apostle said in 1st Thessalonians
[15:15] chapter 5 verse 18 in the amplified
[15:18] bible thank God in everything no matter
[15:23] what the circumstances may be be
[15:25] thankful and give thanks for this is
[15:28] will of God for you who are in Christ
[15:30] Jesus
[15:31] the revealer and the mediator of that
[15:36] will being thankful is not a natural
[15:39] state of mind for most people it it
[15:42] takes a choice we make a choice to
[15:45] reflect on the good things in our life
[15:48] and we make a choice to give God praise
[15:51] what I find out is being thankful is
[15:55] often the product of maybe having lack
[16:00] maybe doing without something in your
[16:03] life and all of a sudden you began to
[16:06] see a change in that area and when you
[16:09] know what it means to have nothing and
[16:11] now you have something when you have
[16:14] been sick and now you're enjoying health
[16:17] or healing it gives you that motivation
[16:21] that you need to give God praise knowing
[16:25] what it feels like to be broke to have
[16:28] nothing will cause a person to be more
[16:31] grateful when they begin to have
[16:33] prosperity and blessing in their life
[16:36] when you're facing death the uncertainty
[16:40] of disease and all of a sudden there's a
[16:43] breakthrough oh my you're going to want
[16:47] to be thankful you're gonna want to be
[16:49] appraiser I want you to know that giving
[16:53] thanks and being appraiser is costly
[16:56] again it's usually because someone has
[16:59] been through a trial like Paul and Silas
[17:02] in the book of Acts beaten bleeding
[17:05] bruised but in the midnight hour they
[17:08] chose not to focus on their wounds but
[17:11] to focus on the one who had given them
[17:14] eternal life the Bible tells us in
[17:18] Ephesians 5:20 giving thanks always for
[17:22] all things unto God and the Father in
[17:27] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[17:30] everything every good day every pay
[17:33] raise every good doctor report every
[17:36] help every encouragement every big and
[17:38] little thing that blesses our life we
[17:42] an opportunity to give God praise and to
[17:45] be thankful for I want to share one more
[17:49] little portion with you today and it's
[17:51] found in the book of Habakkuk and it's
[17:55] in chapter 3 verse 17 through verse 19
[18:00] the best way if you're looking for the
[18:03] book of Habakkuk in your Bible is if you
[18:05] can find the book of Mathew which is the
[18:08] first book of the New Testament you just
[18:11] turn left and go back five books and you
[18:16] will have found a little small book of
[18:18] Habakkuk the Prophet that word our name
[18:22] Habakkuk means one who embraces or
[18:25] clings it can mean a wrestler I want you
[18:29] to listen at these verses
[18:30] although the fig tree shall not blossom
[18:34] neither shall fruit be in the vines the
[18:38] labor of the olives shall fail and the
[18:42] fields shall yield no meat the flock
[18:46] shall be cut off from the fold and there
[18:48] shall be no herd in the stalls
[18:51] verse 18 yet I will rejoice in the Lord
[18:58] I will joy in the God of my salvation
[19:03] the Lord God is my strength and he will
[19:08] make my feet like Hinds feet and he will
[19:14] make me to walk upon mine high places I
[19:19] absolutely love these verses of
[19:22] Scripture Habakkuk sprays his glorifying
[19:28] of the Lord his expression of thanks was
[19:32] not based on his present circumstances
[19:35] he was resting his faith on the
[19:39] character of God and that character of
[19:43] God is unchanging our circumstances will
[19:48] change our feelings will change but our
[19:52] God and his care
[19:54] after his sovereignty his faithfulness
[19:58] his love for his children it will never
[20:01] change and it caused Ibaka to have a
[20:06] sense of gratitude that was not affected
[20:12] by what was going on or what was to come
[20:16] Habakkuk was a prophet and he was given
[20:20] vision and instruction of a terrible
[20:23] captivity that was coming on God's
[20:27] people they were going into bondage and
[20:30] they were going to suffer yet again in
[20:34] fact Habakkuk saw the seriousness of
[20:38] that condition and he summarized it by
[20:42] saying the figs are not blossoming and
[20:45] the fruit on the vines and trees have
[20:48] failed to materialise and the olive
[20:50] trees are not giving any olives so there
[20:53] will be no oil the fields are barren and
[20:56] there's no produce for us to take and to
[20:59] feed our families the flocks have been
[21:01] cut off from the fold yet I will praise
[21:06] the Lord I will glory in the God of my
[21:12] salvation and come on that is giving
[21:16] thanks that is living in an attitude of
[21:20] gratitude matthew henry a great
[21:24] commentator of the scripture when he
[21:27] would give commentary on places in the
[21:32] scripture where someone was ignoring
[21:36] their circumstances and giving God
[21:39] praise yet or in the South we say anyhow
[21:44] anyways he called it joy he said that is
[21:49] not happiness that is joy and he said
[21:52] joy isn't a byproduct of an easy life it
[21:57] is a response to God's never changing
[22:01] character when our circumstances are
[22:05] changing even when they
[22:08] don't change immediately after prayer
[22:12] joy remains when we keep our hearts
[22:17] aligned with God
[22:20] and his faithfulness to us Habakkuk said
[22:24] all of these terrible things are going
[22:26] to surround us and yet I will give God
[22:30] praise because he is my strength and he
[22:34] will make my feet like Hinds feet Bible
[22:42] commentators believe that this word hind
[22:46] is referring to either a female deer or
[22:51] also describing a female mountain goat
[22:56] I've been in an Getty in Israel and I've
[23:00] watched these ibex these mountain goats
[23:04] I've watched them scale right up the
[23:08] side of a cliff and you're wondering in
[23:11] your mind how in the world are they
[23:14] holding on Hinds feet is an expression
[23:18] that's used to describe that little
[23:21] animals ability to place his hind feet
[23:26] the last two feet in exactly the same
[23:30] position that he has placed his front
[23:34] two feet what he's doing is he is
[23:38] cutting his unsure 'ti of his next step
[23:43] in half he knows that if this spot will
[23:48] support his front feet it will also
[23:53] support his back feet and so instead of
[23:56] making four different footsteps or
[23:59] footprints he takes those back feet and
[24:03] places them right in the sure fought
[24:07] sure-footed spot that he has chosen for
[24:11] the front feet and because of that he is
[24:15] able to climb in unbelievable
[24:18] circumstances I love
[24:22] what habakkuk acid surrounded by
[24:25] difficulty and what and lack and famine
[24:30] yet I will praise the Lord he will give
[24:36] me the Hinds feet so that no matter what
[24:39] the mountain is I'll be able to climb it
[24:43] if I keep my eyes on him this ability of
[24:48] behind enabled her to run swiftly up the
[24:51] rocky terrain to escape approaching
[24:55] predators very sure-footed I believe
[25:00] that those who demonstrate their
[25:04] Thanksgiving their gratitude to God with
[25:08] their praise I believe if we continue in
[25:11] a lifestyle of thanks living and not
[25:15] just Thanksgiving but it becomes a
[25:18] lifestyle I believe that no matter what
[25:21] surrounds us we can be sure footed in
[25:25] these unsettled and unsure times God
[25:31] doesn't always change your circumstances
[25:33] immediately when you pray and that can
[25:36] be so discouraging and so challenging
[25:39] sometimes our heartaches and our pains
[25:42] our griefs are still there but I want
[25:46] you to know that often the strength that
[25:48] we need is found in simply walking on
[25:52] pressing on depending on him and giving
[25:57] him praise in spite of what we feel what
[26:02] we see or what we are experiencing I
[26:05] guess I want to say to you today that
[26:09] disappointment does not necessarily have
[26:12] to lead you into despair we're going to
[26:16] be disappointed things are not always
[26:19] going to turn out the way that we would
[26:21] like for them to turn out maybe you plan
[26:24] for a special event and then something
[26:27] comes up at the last minute that spoils
[26:29] our sours a portion of that event and
[26:32] you're so disappointed but I will
[26:34] you know you can't let the
[26:36] disappointment get the best of you and
[26:38] push you into despair because no matter
[26:43] what we serve a great big God who
[26:48] deserves our praise who's worthy of our
[26:52] praise there's a little song that says
[26:55] give thanks with a grateful heart give
[27:01] thanks to the Holy One give thanks
[27:07] because he's given Jesus Christ his son
[27:15] and now let the weak say I am strong let
[27:22] the poor say I am rich because of what
[27:28] the Lord has done for us give thanks I
[27:37] want to leave that with you
[27:39] I didn't plan to sing it but I want to
[27:42] leave those words with you today thank
[27:44] you for spending this time with me my
[27:47] heart is overflowing
[27:49] I have circumstances in my life right
[27:52] now that are less than ideal but I have
[27:55] a God who's with me every step of the
[28:00] way god bless you give thanks
[28:11] you
