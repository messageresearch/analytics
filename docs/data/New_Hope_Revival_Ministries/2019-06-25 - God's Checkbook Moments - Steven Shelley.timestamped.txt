[0:00] god never said it was going to be easy
[0:04] but what he did say is if you'll do it
[0:08] you can have the father's checkbook
[0:13] [Music]
[0:26] the scripture has said if you abide in
[0:29] me and my words abide in you you can ask
[0:31] what you will and you can have it if you
[0:33] check your pocket you will find that you
[0:38] have been given a checkbook to withdraw
[0:44] from the bank of heaven everything that
[0:48] you have need of but I can't get over
[0:51] that man over there that brother over
[0:53] there he just fixes my soul I can't get
[0:55] over that sister over there
[0:56] she just fixes my soul you get high
[0:58] enough you'll get high enough in Jesus
[1:02] you'll get enough of the Holy Ghost and
[1:04] enough of the joy of the Lord you won't
[1:06] even know they exist
[1:08] you'll be so lost in your praise it
[1:14] won't even matter to you what somebody
[1:17] else is doing somebody said that's so
[1:20] easy to say it hard to do God never said
[1:22] it was going to be easy but what he did
[1:26] say is if you do it you can have the
[1:30] father's checkbook
[1:36] Maxon or since he's a God who can move
[1:41] the mountain what what looks like
[1:45] passable
[1:47] you can't get over it you can't get
[1:50] around it you can't get under it a
[1:52] mountain smack-dab you understand that
[1:55] kind of language smack-dab in the middle
[1:58] of your way and you have struggled
[2:01] against it and pressed against it and
[2:04] prayed about it and it has remained and
[2:07] then all of a sudden it's gone poof has
[2:13] that ever happened to any of you poof
[2:16] it's gone the obstacle is removed and
[2:20] the way has been made and here's what I
[2:23] have found out about covenant with God
[2:25] but about remaining in fellowship with
[2:27] him and abiding in him and letting his
[2:30] word abide in me there's so much about
[2:32] that that I still don't understand but
[2:36] from what I've learned I have learned
[2:38] this that if I will do that and I'll
[2:42] write out a check move the mountain and
[2:46] God looks down and says no it's not my
[2:49] purpose right now to move that mountain
[2:51] in your life here is what I have found
[2:54] out about the Lord he will make a way
[2:58] he'll make a way for me to get over that
[3:01] mountain
[3:03] but I didn't see before has God ever
[3:06] made a way for you to get over something
[3:09] that you couldn't get or Denny came just
[3:12] like that praise His name that's who is
[3:18] and that is the blessing and the benefit
[3:22] and the favor of recognizing what God
[3:25] has given to us a blank check and
[3:29] knowing that all I have to do is to obey
[3:34] to abide in him
