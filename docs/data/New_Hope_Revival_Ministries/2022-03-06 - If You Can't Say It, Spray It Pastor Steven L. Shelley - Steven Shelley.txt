leave lisa we're glad to see you again today the lord bless you the young lady there with you uh i just can't let that slide i mean it's just incredible they're here because they're friends with lisa she invited them to come but charity and some of the rest of them were looking around this morning and said we've seen those boys we've seen those boys that's jesse's family we've seen those boys so they came here this morning at lisa's invitation not knowing that this was jesse's church and that's his his half brothers stepbrothers half brothers his brothers his brothers isn't that incredible that's wonderful they didn't even know it [Applause] how wonderful my god does all things well doesn't he pairing a message for some time i don't know when but i worked on it yesterday and i'm looking for all those terms that we use through the years of those things that we know god does that are not coincidences you know sometimes we say it's his signature is on it and and uh sometimes we say it's a kiss of heaven or a divine connection or a god wink that's one that an author wrote about some years ago when god winks and when they came and told me that those boys were jesse's brothers i i felt like god was winking i thought god was saying i did that i put that together this morning amen praise the lord we're going to receive the tithe and offering today if you brought your tithe and offering with you i'm going to receive that first and then i'm going to make a few comments afterward before we receive the principal offering so if you brought your tithe and offering with you we're going to receive that first austin would you be willing to come and help us and stephen will you come we'll let these two brothers come to you for your tithe and your offering will you sing at calvary key of c years i spent infinity and pride caring not my lord was [Music] it crucified it was for me he died on calvary oh mercy there was great and grace was free there was multiplied to me there my burden soul found liberty at calvary [Music] i've given to jesus everything now i gladly own him as my king now my raptured soul can hold [Music] oh mercy there was great and grace was free pardon there was multiplied to me [Music] salvation's plan all the grace that brought it down to man oh the mighty god that god did [Music] there was multiplied to me bear my burden soul found liberty [Music] oh the grace that brought it down to man oh the mighty golf that god did spent at calvary [Music] overs [Music] grace was free hard and there was multiplied to me there my burden soul found liberty at calvary [Music] will you hold that up please my father i honor you for your grace and your love that you have given to us that you would provide for us that we could bring our tithe and our offering into the storehouse now lord i bless your people and i ask you lord that you would just let the bounty of heaven be upon them and i pray lord that you would multiply the tithe and offering for the purposes of the kingdom that your name may receive all glory and all honor for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen thank you stephen may i ask you a favor will you take that to the sound booth and let them empty it into one of the bank bags and bring it back so we have both of them here please i want to take a moment this morning because we're at the one year anniversary of when the lord dealt with us about getting the debt to this property paid off and so i want to just take a couple of moments to give you some information giving god all of the praise because he is the one who has helped us in this endeavor and he has i'm going to say he has put his kiss upon it uh because he has supplied this to be able to get rid of this debt when we started a year ago march the 7th of 2021 the mortgage on this property was standing at four hundred and seventy nine thousand two hundred and seventy nine dollars and thirty seven cents at that time every payment had two thousand forty seven dollars of interest and of course that fluctuates from month to month who wants to give away two thousand dollars to a bank nobody does but it was our mortgage and we had to pay it on tuesday night i gave a number somewhere around 299 000 because the interest had just hit the balance on the mortgage as of this uh as of three days ago the balance stood at two hundred and ninety four thousand seven hundred and sixty one dollars and forty cents because another forty five hundred dollar payment had been made on the balance of that loan and so i say god be praised hallelujah [Applause] the total that has been given uh designated as principal offering has been 180 696 dollars and 24 cents 180 696 24 and that is the goodness and the grace of god that is your faithfulness to give god has let it touch the hearts of those that are not able to be here on a regular basis to send in money to help us with this and we bless them and we bless you in the name of the lord now i told you that a year ago the interest on each payment was at two thousand forty seven dollars today the interest on the statement is one thousand four hundred and forty dollars so that is nearly six hundred dollars less per month [Applause] now i'm going to give a little bit more information than maybe some of you care about but i want you i want to be forthright with everything that we do because when we started this we stated yeah we stated specifically that the bills would have to be taken care of first we have kept our word that every dollar that you have designated to go to the principal has gone to the principle because that things are the way they are not every month was a full payment plus the more on top i might say let me let me restate this every month the interest has been paid and every dime that was given every penny went to the principle that you asked to go to the principal now the way that this ministry works is when you pay your tithe half of it goes to our pastor that is the way that he makes his living the other half of it is to pay the bills that are in this church i think i'd be safe to say it's near 25 000 a year that we are paying in israel between 23 and 25 000. all right okay and the dollar has gone down we know that and so that has to be taken care of the light bill has to be paid the water bill has to be paid the employees have to be paid all of this stuff is necessary so all of these bills have to be paid so if if the tithe goes down the offering goes down then we have to make sure all of the bills are paid first and then anything extra goes toward this principal payment but again as of this very moment every penny that you have given to and designated as to go on the principle it has gone to the principle let me put that in a little bit different terminology the payment is forty five hundred dollars that includes the principal and interest every month you pay 41. all right all right so that being said approximately 29 000 would be what is needed to pay the mortgage on this property per year that being said that means that somewhere around 155 000 extra do you understand what i'm saying the forty one hundred dollars is expedient that it is paid every month some of that is is is interest some of that is principle what you have given above and beyond the payment would be approximately a hundred and fifty five thousand dollars extra that has been given on the principle of the mortgage you understand that this is such a blessing this is such a blessing to me personally we're still stating that a hundred and eighty thousand dollars went to the principle of the mortgage there were times that out of that other half the interest had to be paid because there was a little bit lacking but every penny went to the principle that you designated i don't want to confuse you of what i'm trying to say but i want you to understand the payment has to be made first and so 155 000 extra dollars we want you to understand is that every penny given for the principle bond to the principle in addition to what everyone else has given we've not always been able to make a whole payment extra which would have meant if the if the interest is 1400 then the rest of that would have been the regular payment we've not always been able to do that from the church resources right okay standing here today the balance 294 761 000 294 761 dollars and 40 cents the interest has come down nearly 600 dollars per month this is a blessing this is wonderful this is the grace of god [Applause] now standing here today i understand that there's inflation gasoline prices are going up grocery prices are going up electricity bills are going up i understand all of this i'm very aware of it i see it month by month as i purchase materials for my business any of you other men that have businesses know exactly what is happening the prices of everything is going up but my god is still the provider he is still the one who gives me what i have god is my provider not my gutter business god is my provider whatever your job is that is not your provider god is your provider i'm saying all of this because i don't want you to end up not being able to pay your light bill your electricity your water whatever other bills that you have and so we continue this endeavor to pay off this mortgage but we want you to make sure that your family is taken care of and we want you to give with a cheerful heart to the lord we're not dragging it out of you we're not coercing you to give we're just simply saying god is faithful always faithful so austin and stephen i would like for both of you brothers to stand at the end of these aisles each with a offering bag please and i'm going to let the saints come of course so sorry but i don't want to have to get up there and bring the word and say it i'm going to say it now two mer two miraculous things with many miraculous things two come to mind every bit of that extra money was given during covet yeah when churches were closing yeah i i have people writing me right now saying the church that i attended for 30 years is no more our pastor doesn't even do a stream we have nothing after 30 years and i'm not talking about one church i'm talking about at least a dozen that i know of some of them are hoping to be able to open up but they had no money they had no reserve they had nothing and they're not most of those little churches are not sitting on 60 acres we're sitting on that god has given us something here and for those of you who don't know the the appraisal is a million dollars on this property so god has been very good to us and in better times it appraised for more than that but the the miracle is that when other many many places were not able to pay the light bill our light bill is from anywhere from a thousand dollars to in the summer sixteen hundred dollars a month for all the light bills that we're responsible to pay and when uh many other places were not able to pay the light bill god was letting us pay the light bill and this extra money was given so that to me is so miraculous and i feel so humbled and i know it was god and the faithfulness of his people and the other thing is not one car wash not one yard sale not one barbecue dinner plate sold and no coercion no it's mentioned once a month and we report regularly on what has come in during the week that is the grace of god nobody had to buy a broken down radio it's his grace [Applause] [Laughter] if you have your offering would you hold it in your hand please my father i want to thank you for the faithfulness of these people through the years they have given their tithe with a grateful heart for what you have blessed them with and they've also given offerings time after time after time lord we bring our offering today for the principle of the payment of the mortgage on this property the property that you have blessed us with and you have been faithful to allow us to keep it and keep the everything uh paid on it and we're grateful to you so now as your people hold their offering in their hand i want to bless them lord for their faithfulness and i want to pray bountiful blessing back into their lives lord when when all of the world is complaining about what prices are doing god i want there to be such blessing in their homes that there's rejoicing at all of the little ways and the big ways that you provide for us god you are faithful and we just want to praise you for your faithfulness and now we come with our offering to for the the mortgage on this property and we give it to you lord with thankfulness with gladness because you provide for us we give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen will you bring your offering to the lord today sing this little course i started living when i started giving to god well i started living when i started giving to god [Music] oh i started living when i started giving to god [Music] oh i started living when i started giving to god oh i started living when i started giving i started living when i started giving to god pressed down shaking together running over blessing me oh i started living when i started singing once again i started living when i started giving to god [Music] i started living when i started giving to god [Music] [Applause] pressed down shaking together running over his blessing me i started living when i started giving to god god would you stand with us how great is our god great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was heard he wrote back the water of the mighty red sea and he said i'll lead you put your trust put your mind right on him how great is our god how great [Music] he's the is one that ever was heard he wrote back the water of the mighty red sea [Music] and he said i'll lead you put your trust once again how great is our god [Music] he's the [Music] he roll greatest the water of the mighty red [Music] hallelujah you know he's wonderful and worthy to be praised this morning [Music] hallelujah he's wonderful wonderful and worthy [Applause] wonderful and worthy hallelujah amen let's get our bibles this morning we uh appreciate brother greeley so much he is the one who the lord spoke to there were others in the church that god was speaking to but god spoke to brother greeley so profoundly he took the burden he took the initiative and he started it and so we feel like that he deserved to have all the time he needed this morning to give us the update and what an anniversary it is hallelujah god has really done some amazing things and we're so thankful that we have not had to come and talk about jerusalem because the lord is meeting that need and taking care of that because of your faithfulness he's just a good god and i feel a little embarrassed just a little bit you know how you feel because our business is streamed now all over the world and so everybody knows us now and what we're involved in but it's okay it's all right because god is doing a wonderful thing he's taking care of it and we're so thankful for it maybe it will also give our brethren around the world the the understanding that that every church in america is not rich and paid for you know sometimes other places get that impression and so now they will certainly know that we have also had our struggles but god has been so so good the future looks bright because jesus is the light he is the light i want you to thank god for these musicians and everything that they do the they're just faithful to us [Applause] benjamin pulling double duty this morning on the on the drums and leading the worship but he does a fine job we get comments sometimes people write in and say i'm a drummer i could never lead a service from the drums so we thank god giving him the grace and the ability to do that when it's necessary and uh it would be i i so desired that he would play the piano and lead worship i thought it's a wonderful thing when you're able to do that but he would not do it he would not stick to lessons but from the time he was able to pick up two pencils he drummed so that kind of came natural we appreciate the musicians they come early one hour before the service and they give everything that god has sown into them they give it so faithfully and so readily for the service of the lord and they've got a great reward coming do you believe that uh let's see annika has a birthday is it today or when when is her exact birthday is it it is today and

that we got acquainted with at harmony and uh brother daniel miller and his uh wonderful folks his missionary friends and teams and they're in different places in the earth doing god's work today and i'm mentioning that because it's a joy and a privilege to be able to pray for them as they do the lord's work but brother daniel miller was with us and ministered to us and god used him here so we feel certainly feel a personal connection with him and he is in mexico this morning with his team doing the work of the lord let's ask god to give them many souls for their labor and to watch over them and protect them while they're there he will be ministering for us april 1st 2nd and 3rd i'm looking forward to what god's going to do for us that weekend aren't you amen first peter chapter 1 beginning in verse 2 we're going to read god's word today elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied this is peter's letter and he is greeting the church blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations i want you to know notice peter's instruction to the church keep rejoicing no matter what's going on no matter how heavy the manifold temptations of life can get keep on rejoicing don't let this season steal your joy keep right on keeping on are you with me all right let's read on that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen listen carefully whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice would you read it oh that's not how you do it with joy unspeakable and full of glory because you believe hallelujah he's not with you in a physical form peter is saying to the brethren you can't see him but you believe that he's real and so even in his absence you can rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory hallelujah joy unspeakable and full of glory let's pray together father how we thank you today that you are jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever you change not your word is forever settled in heaven and one more time we want to thank you

praise for it is in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen and the church said you may be seated today we want to welcome everyone streaming this service in the nations of the world i just took a quick glance just a few moments ago i haven't taken the time to look back but there were folks greeting us from many nations in the world and we send our love to every one of you and our prayers when we pray during the week we pray for those of you who have an opportunity to connect with us i'm thankful for the archive because there's so many people that tell us i rush home somebody wrote last week and said i i go through the mcdonald's i don't know if that's a good advice or not but i go through mcdonald's to get my big mac so i can get home and watch the archive and so we're just thankful that we have the technology to be able to do that i'm going to bring this morning the last message i think in the series on joy i might can squeeze a little tuesday night out but probably this is going to be it and i want to call it something it's it's it's corny a little bit i i'm sorry i apologize in advance it's a little bit on the corny side thank you sister beverly it's a little on the corny side but it came to me this way this morning i'd worked on it during the week and and i didn't know what to call it i just gonna call it joy unspeakable but i i was sitting at the dining room table this morning working on my notes and making a copy for those amazing girls young ladies who have such a job keeping up with the scriptures and the quotes for the sermon so i'm making a copy for them getting it ready pulling it out and i don't give them my sermon notes i just give them the scriptures and the quotes and i was doing that and all of a sudden um a thought came to my mind now i know you don't believe this about me but i have always had very big teeth i guess you've seen that very big teeth and so i went through school being called a lot of different things oh don't did you well we're family i i was called a lot of different names beaver was one of them you know because i have big front teeth don't feel sorry for me i made it i made it and when i was having dental work done some years ago he said you know we could change this i said oh no god give me big teeth let's make them big fix it big i don't i don't care and and he said we can make them as wide as driven snow i said they won't stay that way so i'm not going to take that i'm not gonna take that white color when they were working on them i i just it's just i had big teeth my daddy had big teeth and thank you sister beverly i appreciate that so they called me beaver and i was a little pudgy a little more sensitive about that and so i had friends that call me pillsbury doughboy yeah they were friends just think of what they could have said well i just played along with that and they'd come up in the hall and and put their finger right there and i just i'd give them a little pillsbury doughboy laugh it is what it is but because and then some would call me preacher and holy roller and all kinds of other things too but anyway uh because of those big teeth and and really a rather small mouth for quite large teeth i don't mean talking i'm a big mouth when i talk i'm talking about the physical structure of my mouth um i have a tendency to spray anybody else have that problem you can just see it going well that is a very a hard thing to deal with during covid so you're always trying to make sure and when i preach i'm just being honest when i preach i'll uh when i go home today i'll have little white spots on my black vest my computer will have to be clean my notes will have to be wiped off the pulpit has to be sanitized because i have a tendency to spray when i say thank you thank you thank you thank you everybody's feeling sorry for me i'm i'm just being who i am so i haven't thought of that in years but people used to always say to me when i was talking say it don't spray it has anybody ever had that said to you only me and brother that brother a few of us they'd say say it don't spray it and i just said i'm doing the best i can just wipe it off this morning i hadn't thought of that in years i've never said that to my wife told her what people would say i sat down this morning and all of a sudden i'm thinking well what would i call this i'll just call it joy unspeakable and full of glory and all of a sudden it came to me to use that and turn it around and so i'm going to call this for the record this morning if you can't say it spread it if you can't say it spread it and you won't forget this say it with me if you can't say it spread it it's joy unspeakable there is a joy that you can't describe there's a joy that you can't explain it's not based on our circumstances it is the gift of god it is the joy of the lord so i want to say to you church of the living god today if you can't say it don't be ashamed to spray it now i don't mean spit i'm not encouraging anybody to spit when they get happy that's not what i'm saying at all i'm basically saying let it out if you can't explain it don't try to contain it you will explode there is a joy that bubbles are any of you old enough to have sung the little pentecostal song we sang when we were young it's bubbling it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soul they're singing and laughing since jesus made me whole some folks don't understand it but i can't keep it quiet it's bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling day and it really is like an artesian well at times my little great-aunt used to sing a song that said i can't be still my heart would chill since i have found the blessed lord and he changed my stubborn will can anybody relate to that there is a joy that cannot be told it is a joy that cannot always be explained you can't even sometimes testify and make any sense because there's no explanation for it it seems in the natural no natural reason to feel the way you do but on the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside there's a little squirting spring that just keeps bubbling and you know what i want to thank god for that it may not be the most theological thought the most amazing theological thought that could be expressed today but i want to thank god for that little spurting of joy that bubbles up in my inner man when i'm sitting underneath the word of god there's something in that word that touches me in a place that nothing else can touch me it finds that sweet spot on the inside of my spirit man and it causes something to come rushing sometimes it's like a bubble sometimes it's like a squirt sometimes it's like a geyser but here is the point god wants you and i to live in this hour with a joy that is unspeakable and full of glory it is our strategy for overcoming it if you can't explain it find a way to give it an expression joshua i need a water if you'll get one for me i have finished mine up here and my lips are sticking together he's out i think he's doing something for me will you get it luke thank you so much i want us to look at the greek word just a moment for unspeakable you see it says whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing he rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory now we can't mourn until the bridegroom comes we weep because we long to be with him but we're not left here in this earth to mourn and groan and carry on all the time because we can't see him in physical form thank you so much and i appreciate you opening it so it's ready for me he's just fulfilled the scripture may god give him his blessing now that word unspeakable is a it's an unusual greek word and there are places in the bible that are translated in english unspeakable but they do not use the same greek word this particular well let me give you an example in second corinthians chapter 9 and verse 15 just stay with me a moment there is one little verse of scripture there that says thanks be to god our thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift that is a beautiful greek word and it means almost the same thing it means to to commemorate when words fail but in the scripture first peter 1 8 when it says joy unspeakable and full of glory the greek word is anakilitos and it means inexpressible indescribable to describe to commemorate words would fail this is a beautiful greek word which basically means unable to find expression in words it's not that it can't be expressed it just can't be expressed in words are you with me you ever been in a service where they said let's let's have a wave offering oh you don't have to tell them when we're in africa to wave have a wave offering because there's a joy that gets in them and there's a joy that gets on them and you don't have to tell them to take their handkerchiefs out or their scarves out when they begin to praise the lord they just automatically begin to give him a wave offering you know what i say that is i say when god begins to bless them that is joy unspeakable it can't be testified it can't be explained with mortal lips but it has found an expression now i know that there are we have had a variety of expressions around here through the years we have had people to get excited and get under the anointing and get under this uh the flow of god's glory and you might hear somebody say oh there's no words to define whoa it's a joy bubble come on now help me just a minute it's just a joy bubble it's letting out something that god is stirring on the inside of you that you just don't have language for and then when we were having so many visitors from among the charismatic circles we began to hear some other expressions as people would praise the lord and somebody would say show or somebody might say show and we might have a tendency if that's not our thing we may have a tendency to be a little critical of that well what does that mean it doesn't mean anything not in the natural you can't you cannot interpret that with english it's just a joy bubble it's just a gushing of joy unspeakable and full of glory it is your body your your spirit man and with your physical body reacting to what god is letting you experience on the inside of the inside don't you despise that don't you criticize that because if you don't find a way to let joy and praise express itself you will either explode you will dry up and blow away now i'm going to tell you something if if somebody told me to let out a little show or a little bit of whoa would help me from drying up i'd be finding me one how many of you remember jill marie evans anybody remember when aaron evans was here visiting us black brother came here during a new year's meeting it was part of stream's international great man wonderful friend in prison for for for taking a life he was in terrible shape a ruffian a hoodlum a murderer if you don't mind me saying something so plain and jesus showed up in his prison cell and he said i'm not a black man and i'm not a white man [Music] i'm the right man my name is jesus and you need to serve me and he said right there in that cell he gave god everything well we had the opportunity to travel with him some and we were doing a conference in in the tri-city washington and god was really blessing in those meetings and jill marie she could be so calm she could be so calm and then all of a sudden she would get one of those joy bubbles and she didn't say show hers could be a little more dangerous than that she'd say oh you might be preaching and she'd say how you ever heard that around here i have what does that mean well in the bible it says ho everyone that thirsteth it's a call to get somebody's attention but how many of you know in the urban dictionary how ho doesn't mean get everybody's attention so i happened to be there one night when she kind of got a rebuke for using that expression and i'm the only one that could step to her defense and remind her that her word was in the king james version of the bible i don't understand i can uh why can't you say hallelujah why can't you just say praise the lord why can't you just say amen people sometimes don't understand those expressions that we might make i've been in service one time when somebody went [Music] you thought a bunch of comanches had come through the place but i don't have a criticism because david found a joy that was so real that he began to take off his outer garments and dance before the lord in his inner tunic which we might call his underwear [Applause] i wouldn't encourage you to dance before the lord in here in your underwear but i'm not going to criticize somebody who has tasted a water from a well that they don't know how to contain i don't want to contain it i don't want to cap it up i don't want to silence my praise come on now i've got to let it out i got to praise god and praise god to praise and i got to let it out why wouldn't you want to praise him why wouldn't you want to do what the prophet said get in the spirit of what you're doing come on i mentioned the other day the preachers who can't get excited unless they're preaching something's a little out of balance [Applause] if praise and worship it's not something that speaks to you as a minister and you only get happy when your gift is being used something's a little out i'm not i'm not i'm not trying to judge but something's a little bit out of whack i don't care who's preaching i i don't care who's preaching i can't help myself when that word begins to go forth and dots begin to connect and piece pieces pieces of the puzzle start falling into place i cannot help myself [Applause] can't do it i find out when we have preachers here i have a hard time not distracting because i like to stand i do i like to get up sometime and let that man know i'm behind him and i appreciate but i'm not doing it for you to see me i'm not even necessarily doing it for him to see me although i believe it's a good idea to encourage the servant of the lord but i just can't help myself sometime there's something about truth i love truth jesus is truth truth is a person and i love truth i don't just carry on like this when you're with me [Applause] i was listening to the word yesterday sitting in my chair my house empty nobody there but me and i tell you what i got so happy listening to the preaching of the word that i jumped up out of my chair and i spun around in my living room and i said god i want to thank you that there's something in me lord jesus i want to thank you that through all the trials of life i have not lost that place in me where you can put your finger and bring me to life it's like resurrection life surging through us i think you're preaching this morning about getting out of order i am no such of a thing i'm preaching about a joy that you can't theologically explain you can't always put the words together to tell somebody what it is all you know how to do is somehow let it out and we preached a series here some many years ago now on nine davidic forms of praise and god is honored by all of it any mind with me he receives glory from all of those different expressions of praise just don't find your favorite and get stuck there because god is a god that likes praise anybody with me isn't that what he said he said i'm a jealous god he doesn't want you to be more excited over football or your favorite singer at a concert somewhere or your favorite sport whatever it is you travel around the world in soccer which they call football outside of this country you can be walking down the street in london not even knowing that there's a game going on and you can begin to hear a roar coming out of those pubs as those men don't seem to be able to help themselves because something that they care about something that they're passionate about is on and they're glued and when the other team scores [Music] like purim like purim when we mention haman when we mention mordecai or esther yay when something that you're passionate about is mentioned when something you're in love with is being edified or magnified or mentioned there should be a connection i'll tell you now i'm not saying anything deep right now but i'm feeling something as i talk there should be something that quickens that comes alive hallelujah and don't you be like they used to tell me i'm not emotional you can't expect me to jump you can't expect me to shout you can't expect me to say amen i'm not an emotional person then you're dead you're not even alive you're worse than a zombie say amen because we are all emotional creatures you just let somebody take your parking place and you see how emotional you really are so joshua wanted to run on friday to play uh nine holes of golf and he said dad you want to go with me and ride in the cart and i do that on occasion i've never hit a golf ball except a putt-putt ball i wouldn't know what to do i'd be embarrassed i think now to try because i see how serious they get and all i know is you've got to have some some loose hips to be able to play golf evidently because as i watched out over that it wasn't just joshua wiggling his you know i'm wondering if you got to hold your mouth a certain way there seems to be so much involved in it and then you take a few swings and miss the ball on purpose to practice there's a lot involved in that and so i was riding out there with him somebody said brother they heard i was with joshua goblin and said i just can't see you golfing no you can't cause i don't but i'm just out in nature you know and and spending some time with him but we come up there and uh we got close enough the way those golf that golf courses laid out we got close enough to a two two college guys over there playing golf and i could hear them i could hear their conversation i got good ears i didn't even have to try i could hear their and all of a sudden he screamed out uh uh uh blasphemy uh taking god's name in vain because he got a bad shot and joshua must have heard him because i looked i said now what's he wanna and i was loud they're always telling me you better people you know you they go come over here and whoop us well they're gonna have to they're gonna have to outrun me because i'm not gonna just stand there and let them whoop me i'm gonna get in the golf cart and run over them if i have to bowl them over i said now what has god got to do with it you're a lousy shot god didn't do it you ought not to be cursing god and joshua's looking his face is getting red yes he's getting his i don't understand but see he's very this guy this feller was very passionate about his golf game and he was very upset that it took a slice off in the other direction from the one it was so important to him that he just used god's name in vain and it's foul and it's dangerous and you know what i made sure it was dangerous i said lord you see that man i don't believe he don't know better i don't believe he doesn't know better i believe he knows better i believe his mom and daddy taught him not to use that name like that so lord i'm just asking you stay on his shoulder today i'm raising my hand over there on his shoulder today lord i pray that he will use all of his might to hit those balls and they'll fall at his feet i want you to show him the penalty of using your name in vain over something as stupid as a golf game well brother shelley you cursed him he better be glad i didn't pray his hair would fall out all i prayed was lord show this man that this is not worth cussing over but this shows you how people get so wrapped up in what they're doing but then they come to church [Applause] [Music] they're afraid to make any noise come on now and if they get a little squeezed out during worship when the word goes forth they're not only quiet they're asleep say amen who are you preaching at anybody that's guilty now listen here's what brother branham said in the laodicean church age if you'll just let me share that with these people here this morning it starts off it reminds me of those beautiful words first quote from this from this morning sheep he said it reminds me of those beautiful words of first peter 1 8 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory with them we rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him how many of you can say you felt this presence you know he's real we know him not as much as our limiting uh we know him now as much as our limiting senses can let us interesting isn't it but one day oh i feel a show coming out or a hulk coming out or oh whoa coming out he said but one day it will be face to face he said that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age i want you to listen to these words he said partial realization will be made perfect [Music] hallelujah aren't you looking for that day when your partial realization of who he is will be completed and it will be perfect realization completed realization hallelujah he said we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face hallelujah he said we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him jesus our savior divine he said isn't that wonderful we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization let me tell you something brother branham told us that this life is just the negative he said this isn't the positive this is the negative from which the positive strikes and one of these days we will have more than just the the negative we'll have more than just the burnt image of the real we will have complete realization and perfect realization of who he is because we will know him and we will see him what face to face but until then [Music] my heart will go on singing but until then with joy i'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city until the day he calls me home sing again but until then my heart will go on singing and until then with joy i'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city until the day god calls me home the things of earth will dim and lose their value as we recall they're borrowed for a while and things of earth that caused the heart to tremble remembered there you remember that trial do you remember that heartache that burden that unending valley had seen that caused your heart to tremble and almost caused you to lose your way if that should ever come to your mind on the other side of eternity give me the words back thank you it will only bring a smile no more trembling no more sorrow but only bring a smile but until then my heart will go on singing and until then with joy i'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city until the day god calls me home give us the other verse and let's read it this weary world with all its toil and struggle may take its toll of misery and strife the soul of man you want me to act like a presbyterian this morning but i can't do it i can't act like a graveyard dead man today because this soul of mine is like a waving eagle blessed be the name of the lord when it's released it's destined [Applause] hallelujah this is not your home you've got another eternal you've got an eternity waiting on you you've got another place of existence hallelujah this is only the dressing room church to get us dressed up and ready for the real life the real life is waiting on us over there oh the soul of man is like a waving eagle when it's released it's destined for the sky but until then my heart will go on singing and until then with joy i'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city until the day god calls me home would you give god praise before you seed it hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah give me patmos vision would you he said have you ever noticed how the world yes i read this recently guess what i'm going to read it again have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events their dances mm-hmm and they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wallflowers i only square danced once and i never did it again you know why because i was too good at it i enjoyed it too much only once and then i went and had to go to my teacher it was a unit it was a unit in physical ed only did it once i wasn't prepared to do it didn't know we were going to do it didn't know it's going to be a whole unit i got up there and had such a good time why because the last saturday night i'd been at the church the only dancing i'd ever done in my life was in pentecostal church so when i got up that music got to go and i just realized i was having too good of a time so the next day i had to go early and say to the coach i'm so sorry i'm not going to be able to take this unit can you give me something else to do to get my grade he said no way he said no way i can i said you have to he said absolutely not he said you outdanced everybody in the class i said i know that's why i can't do it he said i don't get you i don't know what you mean i said you know that i'm pentecostal you know where i come from and you know that that we worship god in dance and i just cannot use what little bit i know about groove over here for some song katie's get the gun i just can't do it i just cannot do it and he give me a hard time but he gave me another assignment and when he signed my annual that year he signed it to the best dancer i've ever known in my life and to a young man that has my respect more than any that i've ever known for standing for his convictions he said go for god that's the way he signed it i jo i enjoyed it and i knew that that was not something that i needed to be doing so i didn't do it because it was easy for me to get in the spirit of it when i was pastoring the assembly of god church over here in phoenix city they took me to a braves game and they walked up and down the aisles of that uh stadium selling beer and screaming at the top of them get your alcohol i i remember it very well ice cold alcohol and they lined up to get them a cold beer i said this is not the atmosphere i need to be in now i went many years later and they weren't walking up down the aisles saying get your alcohol get your alcohol get you but in those days they were walking them down the aisle saying come get your ice cold alcohol well i knew that was no environment for me to be in i saw people pounding people's heads because they got excited come on now abusing their families because they got excited over some you can't criticize them they're getting in the spirit of what they like but brother branham said here they enter into the spirit of it they don't they don't sit there like wall flowers old dried up sticks i'm sorry for you if you have to sit on the road with a dried up stick but don't you let that keep you from praising the lord you take your liberty when you get an opportunity to do it don't let somebody get your shout out if you do they'll never give it back come on now let's read on he said they enter right into the field of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate christians for getting into the spirit of god's word he said they call us fanatics and holy rollers he said there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and approval remember i told you in high school i'd walk out onto the pe field and the football players would drop and roll around on the ground singing holy roller holy roller holy roller but you know what i loved it i loved it i loved the idea that every one of them knew who i was and i didn't have to talk to none of them because they'd already heard and they all knew and as i've told you many many times they pulled me behind the locker and said my grandmother's in the hospital with a heart attack preacher will you pray very same ones how many of you know the name frank thomas anybody from sports know the name frank thomas i went to high school went to went to elementary school and junior high school with frank thomas and i remember the times that he would pull me behind the locker and say preacher will you pray for my family some of the same ones it would be holy roller holy roller holy roar in front of everybody but when they had a need my mom and dad are about to get a divorce preacher would you pray that god will do something i don't want my mom and daddy to be split up i don't want to finish growing up in a split home in a divorce how was that possible because i wasn't ashamed i was not ashamed of who i was don't you ever ever ever be ashamed of who you are in christ come on now and i wonder about people that can't have a praise when they get to god's house i wonder about how they shine when they're out of god's house because whatever holds you back from praising him in here is likely to try to hold you back when you're out there in the world and if the world ever needed a shine if they ever needed to see the light of the glorious gospel of jesus christ it's in this dark hour don't you ever be ashamed he said there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but here's what brother and told you to do about it but ignore that just ignore that you can't expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on just go on he said just go on he said and do what read it for me would you we're hurrying and if he didn't mean with all you got why in the world that he included here with the sports and the dance and the things of the world he meant with everything you've got let everything that hath breath praise the lord praise him praise him all ye people praise him with a shout out come on now praise him with the ten stringed instruments psalmist said hallelujah praise him with a loud noise make a joyful noise unto the lord and you know what else he said he also said praise him in [Music] him in the dance the dance was not listen dance was not for the devil it wasn't created for hell it wasn't created for the secular life dance was originated it originated in heaven before the throne of god the angels and the living creatures and those 24 elders and those who worshipped the lord they knew the atmosphere of worship and dance was included hell tried to hijack it to make it something lewd to make it something vulgar to make it something that edifies sin and sensuality and the charismatic church is doing a lot to promote that kind of thing sometime with their dance because they'll get up and dance in their services half-dressed and i'm telling you you may think i'm just a real fanatic but god is not honored when we can't use a little modesty when we come into the house of god you don't have to say amen you can call me legalistic you can say you're just one of them clothesline pre you can say whatever you want to say but once you discover what pleases god that's what you want to bring him when you praise him [Applause] you don't want to show your underneath garments when you come to praise the lord hello you want to come holy before him it's a worship is sacred dancing before the lord is sacred even running the aisle is sacred come on now he said they come in church they sit like dried sticks like wall flowers he said our spirit is clean it is fresh it's 107. it's real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full full whoop full of the joy of the lord if you're tanking full you can get it full this morning you can how do i fill my joy tank by praising him by lifting him up by honoring him hallelujah by singing for him by worshiping him he said the christian the christian ought to be just as i'm not saying anything other than that i want that to sink in the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures anybody believe that am i the only one that believes that if you're not going to give god all you've got just just hold on to it till you can do it till you can give god everything just hold on to it come on you mean you really i really do i really do i really really really do i believe god deserves everything everything we have everything we can use to praise him i still marvel at the at the at the crazy idea of forgive me for sounding so wild but i marvel at the crazy idea that i can do anything that blesses him even though i know who i am from the word and from the message i still marvel that god would be honored by my by my heart jump for joy and the fact that god would be honored by me jumping for joy by me clapping my hands by me raising my hands the god of all eternity receives from me when i worship him and bless it and i get so marveled in that i stand in awe of all of that and it makes me want to give him all i can and more he said full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of pleasure full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures both christians and the world are human both have emotions that i did i didn't finish telling you about those people that used to tell me i don't you don't never expect that out of me because i'm not an emotional person mama died and they asked me to preach the funeral i didn't know mama like they did but i went we're not emotional pastor we're not emotional we want you to know we're not emotional oh my [Music] goodness i'm not making fun of anybody's hurt it's a horrible thing to lose your loved one but don't come around tell me you're not emotional i've been in more than one where the people's emotion turned the casket over i was trying to think but i know at least three times twice or three i think three times i've seen them throw themselves over in the box like they were going to go with her until it just you know what a mess that is can you imagine how how you how you have to rush to try to put things back but then they say i'm not emotional don't say you're not emotional it just happens something that's that precious to you just hadn't struck you just yet because when you when you get in a precious place like that you'll find out who you really are and you may be emotional although you've called yourself all these years non-emotional you get in the real flow of the holy spirit you get where the power of god really is moving and you might find something coming out of you that you didn't even realize was inside of you because there is a joy unspeakable he said both christians and the world are human both have emotions he said the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh isn't that the truth now i looked up that word exuberant because this was a this was a a pretty big word hearing an important word and i looked it up because brother branham said that the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures so i looked it up for you so you can know what the prophet was talking about here in the book joyously unrestrained and enthusiastic that ain't it that ain't it it means unrestrained that means not held back enthusiastic how many of you know enthusiastic means enthusiastic with enthusiasm extreme i'm gonna finish i'm still on the definition extreme you all see how that brother daniel miller acted when he was here his eyes got big one minute i looked across here and he'd done bent over up one minute and bent over the next nearly down to the ground really just a carrying on up here in this pulpit and you know what i say go get it [Music] go get it [Music] give everything you got somebody said well i don't know if that's just right in the order of things or not let me tell you something there is a river streams thereof glad [Music] you get in that flow harabo you get in that flow of anointing in spirit life and you are no longer satisfied to stand there with it rushing across your feet and ankles no no no no no no one january i was in the in israel with my mother we were showing her around that was the first time she came the second time she came was when we were all there with as a family the last time but this was just for her and uh i we had gotten there with some cold weather it was snowing in jerusalem i've been there three times when it snows it is a sight to see it had been snowing in jerusalem and i have been in the dead sea when the water felt as hot as the air around it and so i thought i'm getting in the dead sea mother said well i'll put my feet in i said i'll i'm i'll never be satisfied just putting my feet in i want to get out there until i can feel that that salinity of that water just take over and start lifting me up i love that feeling it's quite a feeling you know they tell me they've got a place there in columbus where you can go for a salt salt experience like that when i'm not in the pulpit if you ask me i'll tell you something about the owners and how i know them but i won't tell it here it's too strange but i love that feeling well i did not expect the water to be cold it was cool outside i had on a jacket but i wasn't expecting the water to be that cold and i want you to know something it was cold now when we got down there to that beach where i've been with a lot of you nathan i remember being there with you and you get to that beach and there's usually quite a few people out there and secular israelis don't cover up religious ones do secular ones don't and them old grandpa hairy men like gorillas so you always tried to find a place where you could get where there wouldn't be a lot of people and of course we went in dressed in the orthodox and the religious jews they'll go in with their clothes on well we went in i mean i when we got down there i noticed there's nobody there not one i'd never been there before without one single person on the beach not one and i said we hit the jackpot i can't hardly wait to get in the water mother said well i might get in i'm not going out then if nobody's there and we went and she had her had her jean skirt on and i had my sweat pants on and we get in and i want you to know when i put my foot in that was the coldest water i had ever felt i don't know how in the world it was that cold i'd never felt that and i said oh no no no no no no i'll get my feet wet but that's all but you know what the longer i stood there the more i begin to remember what it feels like when you wait out you just start walking you can do it you just start walking and after a while you can't walk anymore cause your feet start lifting up and you better close your mouth and you better close your eyes because that's the worst tasting stuff you've ever tasted and it'll sting your eye you don't even have to relax and let yourself go you can just walk just keep walking out and all of a sudden your feet will not hit the bottom anymore and it's like you're walking on air i begin to remember what wonderful feeling weightlessness how wonderful that feels and all of a sudden my desire to experience that again was was more strong it was stronger than the fact that the water was so cold i could hardly stand there so i just kept walking with my teeth chattering in my mouth until my feet just lifted up and the next thing you know i am the only one as far as the eye can see enjoying the dead sea when the water was as frigid i cannot tell you how cold it was but this is how it is sometime i could not stand to just let that water run over my ankles i had there was something pulling me to experience again what i had experienced before don't you be satisfied ezekiel in the ankle deep water you get on out there and let it run up to your knees and when that is not deep enough let it rise to your thighs and before you know it you will find a river that cannot be crossed over you will find a river that is so powerful that all you can do is find these waters to swim in how many of you have ever experienced something like that in the spirit where you felt like you found waters to swim in let it be so i pray right now i'm not asking you lord to make fanatics out of these church people i'm not asking you to cause them to be out of order i'm not asking you to make them wild without any sense at all of what they're doing but i'm asking you lord to let every one of us who have such a desire to find that place in you where our desire to be lost in that presence of god is stronger than any reluctance that we might have and god give us the faith we need to keep wading in wait out a little deeper you stood and waited on the shoreline much too long wait out in the water be filled with the spirit wait out in the water with god's happy shouting throng wait out in the water just a little bit deeper you've stood and waited on the shoreline much too long wait out in the water be filled with the spirit wait out in the water with god's happy shouting throng we'll hurt you there's nothing in that river of spirit that will harm you in any way it'll give you life now i'm nearly closing i hadn't preached but whatever i've done i've enjoyed it be not afraid let me give them this one i'm going to skip these verses here we'll come back to them i guess i did squeeze the tuesday night i sang so much i sang so much while i'm preaching i squeezed a tuesday night out of these notes 1 162. he said that's what the church needs to diet needs the holy ghost and fire to get a church to move for the kingdom of god he said it'll walk then it won't stand still then he said a revival except christ the word believe it let it sink down below the fifth rib on the left side till it anchors down to the bottom of the heart hallelujah then floods of joy will spring up and joy unspeakable and full of glory don't you know brother shelly how expensive gas is don't you know what a political mess our country did don't you know there's poor ukrainian people under the bomb don't you know the political power of the world is nearly shifting in this hour don't you know people are still suffering with covet etc etc don't you know cancer rates are higher than ever before don't you know abortion is out of sight again i know all those things i know all those things but i will be no good to any of those perils unless i pray through to the power of the holy ghost which brings joy unspeakable and full of glory somebody's got to give them something more than what they get on the news [Music] somebody's got to carry jesus to them and this world is too smart for a dead dry religion [Applause] she will never satisfy with that anymore it'll have to be something that works it'll have to be something that can actually be felt because we're living in a sensory world now where people only react to something they can feel somebody said well that just leaves us out oh don't leave me out because when i found god i found something i can feel yes i had another song but i'll skip it he said and the holy spirit will make you sing fill my way every day with love as i walk with the heavenly dove it'll do something to you when we need it it'll just put energy puts energy in there it'll do something for you how many of you believe it will it'll do something for you uh planting the vine and where to plant it people don't believe in shouting the thing of it is they haven't got a spiritual joy and the joys of the waters of life can fall through there's a whole lot is the matter with the branham tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world had bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth he said that's what's the matter with our nation that's what's the matter with our churches they have no joy and the joy of the lord has departed as it was written one time in the scripture the hebrew word of ichabod which means the presence of the lord the presence of the lord hath departed how many of you know that's an awful thing the presence of the lord hath departed he said uh give me the rest he said that's over our churches because that we left off the original foundation and placed ourselves into creeds and denomination and permitted the things of the world to dry up our experience with god let me tell you about the modern church while the musicians are coming let me tell you what's happened the fire has gone out the joy of the lord is left and they have replaced it with a form of entertainment i'm sorry if i've upset anybody i'm sorry there is something wrong when a church has to have a smoke machine you see i'm old enough brother skip to remember when i was a boy and the glory of god would come down out there on highway 27 the building is gone but i can show you the spot there's a seven-day adventist church that sits across the road and just a little bit beyond that spot on highway 27 old hamilton road is where the old church and i can show it to you don't go nowhere yet we're nearly done wasn't much to look at this on the left is the church in south carolina i was pastoring when i heard the message but but this over here see this old when we left it it become a a place where they had jamborees and things again cloggers that little place all it ever knew was dancing it was a bar it was a it was a honky tonk before we had it it was called mary's place i know i've met people not too long ago i met a couple who said i remember when your granny used to have church out at mary's old place mary was a big old woman nothing wrong with that she was a big old woman and she sat on a stool with a shotgun and she ran a honky tonk you weren't never there brother shaw were you but you did hear stories about mary she was wild she wouldn't let no caring zone go on if there was any shooting done she did it first it's true and they would go out there and get drunk and dance all night and carry on in mary's old place the lord spoke to my grandmother and said there needs to be a pentecostal church out in that in that area and this was before she heard the message of truth and she had a desire to make sure there was and she didn't call it a church it never was called a church it was called a prayer center so when you look us up on the amazon smile and someone just asked us recently texted my wife and asked how to find us on amazon smile if you if you uh purchase something from amazon and most everybody does if you find us on amazon smile then the church gets a small portion of everything you purchase and we do not get to see what you purchase they don't show us what you purchase we have no access to your purchases but but ever every month or so we'll we might get 9 or dollars twelve dollars or something like that from an amazon a smile donation it goes right into the account sometimes it's a little more than that i don't even think it would be two hundred dollars a year but every penny helps and if you looked us up you would find us not under new hope revival ministries that's how we do business but you'd find us under the original charter and the original charter is new hope assembly prayer center and it never was really called a church my granny wanted a place where people could pray and where they could experience god and the other churches this is a truth you got a few more minutes thank you the other churches would would bring their demon possessed for us to pray for so they would get the deliverance that they needed and i've told you the stories of how we stood right on those steps i've got the bricks of some of those steps on my front porch i've got one brick sitting there and several in another place in my yard from those steps because the building is no longer there and we stood right on those steps and my grandmother's nephew said aunt mildred i don't believe in those foreign lights and what he meant by that is the balls of fire and pillar of fire was showing up in those days and hanging visibly over the building more than one time in my life i heard the the sound of a of a 18-weeter locking his brakes and skidding into the back parking lot behind the behind the church just as you passed the church there was another place that you could pull in and park if the front was full and the door would open up and some old truck driver rough looking truck driver would come in stumbling down to the altar throw itself on the altar and say somebody pray for me and those folks we would get down and pray for them just like we knew who they were we would get down and pray for them and god would touch them and save them and sometimes fill them with the holy ghost and when it was over they would stand and say do you know why i'm here we'd say no why because a fireball was hanging over this church as i was coming down highway 27. i remember one man's name his name was wayne and i remember him very very well and he came in like that that night and he said there was a ball of fire hanging over the church and i said my i wonder what that is about and all of a sudden an angel appeared in the middle of the highway with a sword over his head and said this is for you he said i don't know if you heard it over the music but i locked my brakes and slid into your gravel parking lot out there because i knew this was for me and the presence of god would become so real in that place at night when we would be having service and sometime on a sunday morning too we had saturday night sunday morning sunday night and tuesday night the glory of god would become so real in there that it would fill the house like a smoke and i've been standing on the pulpit looking back at the congregation and their faces disappear because the smoke of god's presence that holy holy holy holy presence that smokey cloud of god's glory just like the cloud that came down there in uh apostolic ark when vicky tidwell got the holy ghost i have a picture that was snapped and the holy ghost she said i've been in church all my life but i don't know whether or not i've got the holy ghost and we prayed over her that day and god filled her refilled her or filled her whichever it really was someone snapped a picture and she's standing in a smoke cloud you can't see anything but a long black hair hanging down the back some of you have seen it in my office same cloud same smoky presence of god do you have to see that no if you never see it again let me be a witness to you and tell you it's real but something is very wrong with the modern church when they have to pay to put in a smoke machine to set an ambiance to set an atmosphere when it used to be the spirit of god setting the atmosphere and they've got to put different colored lights on everything and make it look like some kind of a concert or some kind of production or some kind of entertainment light shining up on this and that the other let me tell you what god used to do for us nothing but but naked light bulbs hanging down not even a globe on them sometime but you've never been to a place more colorful than that because when the presence of god would flow and the power of god would move in that church colored lights would flash all over the building and people would say i saw flashes of amber i saw flashes of red i saw flashes of silver why because the presence of god somebody said i don't believe in that then don't read the book of revelation because there's a rainbow about his throne [Applause] you don't believe in that doesn't matter whether you do or not that's that's that's some of the things that we saw in that hour but the modern church has found a way to create an ambiance and an atmosphere for people to find some kind of a feeling that helps to satisfy them i'm not looking for that you can say amen or on me i'm not here to be critical not trying to be critical i'm just telling you what a substitute what a poor poor substitute for what we have seen and you say well some of us some of us would love to see that get your heart right let's get right let's let's get some of the world kicked out of our lives let's come back to him in holy consecration there's married people in this room that were filled with the holy ghost standing under right now this here today standing under a pillar of fire that hung visibly over the church in columbus we've seen the glory of god we've seen angels lined up and down the the walls but that's not why we come if we never saw anything like that again that's not the reason why we come we come because he's worthy we come because we want to praise him help me just a little bit but i will tell you this in closing i will give you this testimony he filled me with the holy ghost when i was seven years old i'm going to turn 54 next month i read it on my hospital bracelet last week 53 and it felt like a lie when i first looked at it i thought it could not be so sister alfreda's got a birthday coming up bigger than that a real milestone and she's the one that i saw her face it reacted like how can this be how did this happen how did these years come by the way they did well i'm so glad brother shelley you no longer believe the best is yet to but i do but i do i still believe nathan the best is yet to come i still believe it is yet to be seen around here what god wants to do with the people that are fully dedicated and fully consecrated to him i don't care if he comes in a pillar of light i don't care if it comes into smoke i don't care i don't care if any of those things happen but what i want to see happen is lives laid down at the feet of a living god i want to see people that god can use and step into you and use you for his glory and until we get to that place i want to see you experiencing a joy that is unspeakable and full of glory so within reason you don't have to worry about me stopping your praise in fact i'm going to be the one up here with as a cheerleader trying to get you to praise him more because that is how you find a place of and confidence in him play something there is a joy that can't be told it can't be explained it can only be experienced it finds a way of expression you may not understand somebody waving a flag you may not understand somebody waving their arms like a like waving an airplane into its slot you you may not understand somebody trembling like this in the presence of the lord you may be like those who come and said i don't know why they're all crying you may wonder why somebody's laughing right in church all these things may feel foreign to you but i want to tell you there's a joy that's unspeakable but full of glory you know what glory is it's the atmosphere of heaven fill this house with the atmosphere of heaven we are a needy people we need healing we need deliverance we need his help fill this house with the atmosphere of heaven we're going to stand on your word we're not going to compromise with your word we're going to declare it to the north and the south and the east and the west we're not running for emotion or looking for a feeling but neither are we going to deny the reality of his presence when it comes let's stand and worship him he became sin who knew no sin that we might become his righteousness he humbled himself and carried the cross let's do it love so

jesus messiah oh jesus messiah oh yes lord the lord of lords let's do one more and worship him stay in this atmosphere and we'll be gone in just a few moments i believe god's moving even as you worship him i believe if you'll give your need to him right now he'll help you he'll meet you right where you are draw him to you with your praise draw the spirit of god toward you by lifting him up and exalting him hallelujah hallelujah i felt like god was pushing out some stuff cleaning out a well cleaning out a they used to my granny used to talk about how the water would come out of the side of the hill and drop down in troughs that her daddy had made to fill up the wash tub and she'd talk about coming sometime there'd be no water in the wash tub because leaves and debris had got in those gutters it would drop down and she said her mama would say honey go get a stick and clean that gut around get all that out of there so the water can flow out of the side of the hill and fill up this wash pot i i felt like the lord was pushing some debris out of some of your lives as you worshipped him i felt a good response of faith as i laid my hands on some of you let the lord do that for you right now let him push all the cares and the worries and the troubles of what you're walking through right now let him push that away and let him fill you with joy that joy that comes from an artesian well let god allow just allow the holy ghost to to come and do what you need him to do in your life as you before we go here today let's sing something else hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in

lion lord let him roar forth your word of deliverance in the name of jesus fruit for his consecration [Music] fruit for his consecration as he follows your leadership in this hour [Music] behind would you just reach your hand toward our brother lord of fire shut up in his bones hallelujah the zeal of the lord consume him may the zeal of the lord consume him come on let the holy ghost rise let [Music] new authority in this house new authority [Music] go ahead holy ghost [Music] may he never settle [Music] i hear the lord saying i have given you authority in this house i have given you authority in this house and so many times i have met with you in quiet i have met with you in solace i have met with you alone i've moved in you and through you says the lord but i didn't just do it for you i did it because i was building something in you for this house i desired to release authority to you among these people and so the lord is calling to you today step up my son step into the fullness of what i have do not fear neither be afraid for i am cleansing you as i cleanse the prophet of old i will place a coal of fire on your lips so sayeth the lord and your words will no longer be your own words neither your thoughts your own thoughts and i will cause you to release an intercession in this house a deliverance like that of a lion says the lord a young lion shall roar in this house who shall not respond says the lord i will use you in ways that you have yet to understand i'm asking you now bring your devotion into this house bring your devotion into this place and let me use you as i have called and desired to use you saith the lord my word shall burn in your heart and shall come forth from your lips and my people will know freedom because i have called you to speak a word of freedom and deliverance to many that have not yet responded says the lord and i will use you beyond this house but the lord says i have called you for this place first and i have desired to use you here and now is the time be ready for my assignment in your life and i will go with you when you go i'm sending you saith the lord but i will also use you in this place with a new authority with a new confidence with a new boldness and i will cause those around you to see what i am doing in your life and they will honor me for living in you the way i do do not be afraid or try to interpret or explain it in your head for i am the lord who hath spoken and i will do it says the lord like jeremiah like jeremiah i shall put fire in your bones saith the lord in the name of jesus we agree with your word over our brother and we ask for fire shut up with his bones in the depths of who he is and lord let it come out in the right hour in the right season with the right authority to accomplish all that you have purpose to accomplish in the name of jesus nathan lord we pray for nathan today we thank you for his heart's consecration to you and he's asking lord to be raised up into a higher place a place lord that you've prepared i ask o god that there be a well opened up in his spirit man a joy that nothing would be able to stop it that nothing would be able to divert it but that it would flow up and out of him oh god not only for his own family but for this house oh god make him the leader you birthed him to be make him the leader and the example that you've called him
