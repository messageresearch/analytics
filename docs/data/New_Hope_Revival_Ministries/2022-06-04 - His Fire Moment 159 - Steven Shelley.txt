Description:
What differentiated the burning bush from all other bushes on the mountain?  It was the Fire of God and the Voice of God that made it holy.  God spoke out of that bush and gave Moses his commission.  Likewise, we are just ordinary people, but we become a holy people by His Holiness and His Righteousness.  Before the foundation of the world He had a people on His mind, a people who would become most special because of His choosing; a people who would follow the mandate of the Master and be separated from the world.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because it's not what you do that makes you holy [Music] can i talk to you a minute about the bush did you know there was a mountain full of bushes there was a mountain full of bushes one day moses was walking along the trail of that mountain and god came down and crawled into a bush and a voice spoke out of that bush and said take off your shoes moses unless your sandals because the ground that you are now standing on is holy ground i want to know what made it holy i i want to know what made that bush any different than any other bush on that ah mountain it is it was the god in the bush i want you to know that ordinarily if you look at our life compare it with somebody else's we're really in the natural in the physical no better than anybody else no more special not more intelligent or more talented or more gifted when god said i'm going to make you a holy people he meant i'm going to put myself on you i'm going to eventually live in you by the baptism of the holy ghost and that's what's going to make you holy i believe in coming out of the world i believe in mentally and emotionally checking out of this world and making sure that you have a different life than the world around you i believe in that i believe in that i believe that there are clear distinctions that god gives us in his word he said i want men to look like men and i want women to look like women and i want them to know the difference and i know we're living in an hour where there's a total confusion on the issue but god is not confused he just keeps doing it like he has always done it but i want you to understand that you could live like a monk in a little shack on the side of the mountain and eat cornbread and drink water the rest of your life and not be any more holy because it's not what you do that makes you holy that bush didn't do anything different than any other bush it did what it always did just stood there do i look like a bush [Music] it just stood there it just did what it had always done every day of its life and one day god said you're mine today you're my bush i created every bush on this mountain but today you're my bush i choose you didn't the word say you have not chosen me but i have chosen you says the lord so what he did he chose a bush he put himself in that bush he speaks out of that bush giving moses his commission and because god is standing there in that bush the ground becomes holy ground because god is there today you have become a holy people amen it is not our holiness it is not our righteousness it is not our uniform it's because before the foundation of the world god saw a people in his mind that would choose him even way over in wicked laodicea they would choose a different path to follow the mandate of the master come on and by that he allowed you to come in this hour and he because you've called on him he knew you would he saw you doing it before you did and he poured his righteousness on you just like he chose a bush not a special bush just a bush but it became the most special bush on that mountain because god crawled into it let me tell you in an upper room pillar of fire divided itself into all those little licks of fire and hung over their heads and what was it it wasn't emmanuel god with us anymore it was now god in us by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire he's now living in us
