[0:01] I want to read a scripture to you today
[0:05] it's found in the book of st. John
[0:07] chapter 16 beginning in verse 12 Jesus
[0:12] is speaking to his disciples and he says
[0:15] I have yet many things to say unto you
[0:18] but you cannot bear them now howbeit
[0:21] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[0:25] will guide you into all truth for he
[0:29] shall not speak of himself but
[0:31] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[0:34] speak and he will show you things to
[0:37] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[0:40] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[0:43] you all things that the father hath are
[0:46] mine therefore said I that he shall take
[0:49] of mine and shall show it unto you when
[0:52] the Spirit of Truth has come and I want
[0:55] to tell you that the Spirit of Truth has
[0:57] come by the power of the Holy Ghost and
[1:01] fire and I was just reading some things
[1:04] that brother Branham the precious
[1:06] prophet of God said concerning the Holy
[1:09] Ghost baptism he said when the Holy
[1:11] Ghost comes it is life it is god himself
[1:19] in you and I don't know if that blesses
[1:22] you or not but that blesses me because
[1:25] the true genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:28] Ghost in fire it's not just a sensation
[1:31] it's not just a feeling because feelings
[1:34] come and go sensations come and go when
[1:37] times are bad and when situations are
[1:40] rough well you don't always have a good
[1:43] feeling but the Holy Ghost is more than
[1:45] a feeling it is the very life of Jesus
[1:49] Christ living inside the believer I read
[1:53] where one of the saints asked brother
[1:55] Branham a question concerning what does
[1:58] it mean to be baptized into the body
[2:00] it's that the baptism in the name of the
[2:03] Lord Jesus Christ which we know is the
[2:05] right Christian baptism or is it the
[2:09] baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[2:12] Radames said we are baptized into the
[2:14] body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of
[2:18] the Holy Ghost by the baptism of the
[2:21] Holy Spirit in fact he said you can be
[2:24] baptized all kinds of different ways and
[2:27] still not be a part of the true body of
[2:31] Jesus Christ unless you receive the Holy
[2:34] Ghost baptism and remember that's not
[2:37] just on your flesh that's not just in
[2:39] the in the realm of the emotions but
[2:43] that is to the inside of the inside and
[2:46] when the Holy Ghost gets down into the
[2:49] inside of the inside the very nature of
[2:53] God is reflected brother Branham said he
[2:56] takes control and lives the life of
[3:00] Jesus Christ through us we realize that
[3:04] we've got to have the character of Jesus
[3:07] Christ living inside of us but what what
[3:11] what if you do feel something what if
[3:14] you do have a true experience with God I
[3:18] heard him say a genuine experience with
[3:21] God will punctuate every promise with an
[3:25] amen glory so when you have an
[3:28] experience with God a personal
[3:30] experience it makes every promise in the
[3:33] book personal the Holy Ghost of God is
[3:37] connecting you to the word to the life
[3:40] of Jesus Christ and making it very very
[3:44] personal he also said when the Holy
[3:46] Spirit comes he is the shepherd to feed
[3:49] you the Sheep food from his word we're
[3:53] not eating goat food today we're not
[3:55] eating the food of the Buzzard we're
[3:57] eating eagle food we're eating sheep
[4:00] food even the message of the hour
[4:02] preached a generation ago can become
[4:05] stale to us if we don't have a living
[4:09] continuing experience with the Holy
[4:12] Ghost don't you go another week don't go
[4:15] another day without knowing you can have
[4:18] a no soul you can have an experience
[4:20] with God that is so real that
[4:24] not only makes you feel good of course
[4:26] but it changes you from the inside out
[4:30] it's the completion of the new birth the
[4:32] Prophet taught us and every birth is a
[4:35] mess and I'm telling you it wouldn't
[4:38] hurt some of us starchy church people to
[4:41] go back to our roots and remember what
[4:44] it was like when our hearts were aflame
[4:47] with the power of the Holy Ghost and
[4:51] fire the real Pentecostal experience and
[4:56] a cost has become a denomination but the
[4:59] word Pentecost is not a curse word it's
[5:02] not a bad word it speaks of the life and
[5:06] the fire and the power of Jesus Christ
[5:08] and we need that today perhaps more in
[5:12] 2017 than we have ever needed it before
[5:15] God is still talking he's still speaking
[5:18] by his Spirit whatever he says today is
[5:22] going to line up with the message of the
[5:24] hour it's gonna fit the absolute Word of
[5:27] God but because the Holy Spirit is real
[5:30] and present and and and he is up-to-date
[5:34] he is now the Spirit of God is now he
[5:38] can take the Word of God this precious
[5:41] old book he can take the message of the
[5:43] hour given to us a generation ago and he
[5:46] can make it live by his Spirit until it
[5:50] becomes a personal experience to you and
[5:52] then every promise of God is punctuated
[5:55] by that experience a big old amen glory
[5:58] comes to the end of it and then one more
[6:02] thing I wanted to leave you with and
[6:04] that is that he told us that the
[6:08] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said a lot
[6:10] of things about the evidence of the Holy
[6:12] Ghost he said it was having a burden for
[6:15] the lost I'm just paraphrasing that and
[6:17] it was having all the attributes of
[6:21] Jesus Christ in you not just the
[6:23] speaking in tongues that that's just one
[6:25] of the things that the Holy Ghost can do
[6:27] you know that you can talk in tongues
[6:30] and not have the real genuine baptism of
[6:33] the Holy Ghost on the inside of the
[6:34] inside
[6:35] but once he comes there and takes over
[6:38] the control tower of your life I want
[6:41] you to know there are many F fruits and
[6:44] evidences brother branham mentioned a
[6:46] lot of different things but I like what
[6:48] he said here the evidence of the Holy
[6:50] Ghost is the fruit of it the fruit of
[6:53] the Spirit so here here it is in a
[6:57] nutshell precious Saints you can dance
[7:00] and jump and shout and speak in tongues
[7:02] and prophesy and see visions and by the
[7:05] way I believe in all of that all of that
[7:08] I believe in I believe God has a divine
[7:10] order of course but I believe in all of
[7:13] those manifestations of the Holy Ghost
[7:15] but you can do all that and still not
[7:18] have the genuine Holy Ghost down on the
[7:21] inside of the inside how do we know well
[7:24] one of the ways we know is by the fruit
[7:27] of the Spirit Galatians talks to us
[7:31] about the fruit of the Spirit I want you
[7:34] to know that we're needing some more of
[7:37] the fruit of the Spirit around the bride
[7:39] around those of us who who fellowship
[7:42] around the precious message of the hour
[7:44] we can have the gifts my we need some of
[7:48] that correction we need some of that to
[7:51] deal with the compromise that's creeping
[7:53] in the church so many of the churches
[7:56] who have believed this truth are really
[7:59] entering into a place of compromise and
[8:01] these days so we need the Lord to
[8:04] manifest himself through the gifts
[8:06] through the preaching of the word to
[8:07] help us stay on the straight and narrow
[8:09] the Prophet was having the experience
[8:12] stay in step little bride I just like to
[8:15] release that over you precious people
[8:17] whatever you do stay in step no matter
[8:20] what the enemy throws against you stay
[8:23] in step stay with the word and don't you
[8:27] settle for anything less than a real
[8:30] baptism of fire the baptism of the holy
[8:33] ghost I pray that those of you have
[8:36] never had the real Holy Ghost baptism
[8:38] that you'll tarry until you receive a
[8:40] power from God the witness of his word
[8:43] and I pray that some of you who
[8:46] had an experience with God receiving the
[8:49] Holy Ghost but but you you've become
[8:51] little lukewarm your fires died down a
[8:54] little bit it's possible you have to
[8:56] keep flaming of Fanning the flame you
[8:59] have to keep fellowshipping in the word
[9:01] and by the spirit and so if that's
[9:03] happened to you I pray God will give you
[9:05] a refilling there there's one feeling
[9:08] but many refilling he is life he is life
[9:13] I received that Holy Ghost baptism at
[9:16] the age of seven and that was a long
[9:18] time ago forty-two years ago and you
[9:22] know what he's still keeping me alive
[9:24] and he's come by the Spirit of Truth to
[9:27] lead us to the word and that's why we
[9:30] have the precious revelation of Jesus
[9:33] Christ today so again I just love every
[9:36] one of you and I want you to hold
[9:39] through the mark of God and press in
[9:41] with everything you have the Lord is
[9:43] soon coming to get his bride let's be
[9:46] ready let's make ourselves ready god
[9:49] bless you
[9:50] thank you for letting me greet you
[9:52] bye-bye
[9:56] [Music]
[10:05] you
