[0:00] and that word is constantly working in
[0:03] you as you surrender to it to make you
[0:06] come forth in the overcomers anointing
[0:15] and we take the truth of wesley and we
[0:18] take the truth of pentecost and we let
[0:21] it sit in the light that has been
[0:24] prophesied for this day
[0:26] and then we apply it to our life and
[0:30] when we do that it releases an anointing
[0:33] to overcome anything
[0:36] that the enemy would launch against you
[0:41] i am anointed to overcome anything
[0:48] not because i'm anything but because the
[0:50] one who anoints me
[0:52] see
[0:53] this is the hour where the yoke is
[0:56] destroyed
[0:58] this is the hour where god brings forth
[1:01] the people and he fills them with the
[1:04] fatness
[1:06] of his anointing
[1:08] yes
[1:10] it's the oil of his glory the yoke that
[1:14] once enslaved her
[1:17] can no longer contain her
[1:21] because of the blessing
[1:23] and the anointing and the oil of the
[1:26] lord the fatness of the lord that's
[1:29] being poured out on her how are you
[1:31] going to overcome by the word
[1:35] and by the word only
[1:37] can you remember that when you're in the
[1:38] heat of the battle when you're in the
[1:40] thick of the fight can you remember that
[1:42] can somebody help me remember can i help
[1:45] you remember can we help each other
[1:48] remember
[1:50] that even our lord was tempted this way
[1:54] and he overcame
[1:56] every temptation every personal
[1:59] temptation of satan by the word his
[2:02] ability to overcome in all things was
[2:05] directly attached to the fact that he
[2:08] constantly constantly constantly
[2:12] consistently
[2:14] applied the word
[2:16] he applied the word he applied the word
[2:18] in his own personal life contending with
[2:20] himself how's that possible because his
[2:23] flesh
[2:24] pulled in one direction
[2:26] and his spirit life pulled in another
[2:28] direction
[2:30] no wonder he said oh
[2:32] the flesh is weak
[2:36] my spirit is willing
[2:38] but my flesh is weak
[2:40] i know what is ahead of me but but oh if
[2:43] it be possible let this cup pass from me
[2:46] he was contending with himself there's
[2:48] never been a greater example of how god
[2:51] and man
[2:54] were in direct conflict with one another
[2:57] while living in the same body
[3:00] we can understand what paul was going
[3:02] through because we understand what jesus
[3:04] was going through
[3:06] we can understand what each other is
[3:08] facing because we understand what jesus
[3:10] was going through worship the word don't
[3:13] you get your bible in your mind
[3:16] [Music]
[3:20] the word
[3:21] [Music]
[3:22] in the beginning
[3:24] was the word
[3:25] and the word was with god and the word
[3:27] was god i worship the word powerful
[3:30] powerful
[3:31] powerful we apply the word we speak the
[3:33] word we believe the word we obey the
[3:35] word
[3:36] we surrender to the word and that word
[3:39] is constantly working in you as you
[3:41] surrender to it to make you come forth
[3:44] in the overcomers anointing you are
[3:47] anointed to overcome anything and
[3:50] everything the enemy would launch
[3:52] against you in this hour but it is not
[3:56] by your success
[3:58] your success is by depending
[4:02] on his success
