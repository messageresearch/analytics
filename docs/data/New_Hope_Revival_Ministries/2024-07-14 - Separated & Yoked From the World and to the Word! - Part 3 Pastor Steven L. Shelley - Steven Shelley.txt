us this week as we would deal for with uh insurance and so on and so forth in our home I would appreciate that so much I would like to report to you that before the fellowship meeting in August God willing there will be a large air conditioner installed in that building uh the the the gentleman that I've been talking to has agreed to install one unit he said it will cool the building down although it will strain it so we don't want to go too long with only one unit but he is willing to do that for us in time for the August fellowship meeting so I feel very blessed that will happen not this coming week but next week just before the fellowship meeting he said it will uh take about two days and and so that's very exciting but it also is a lot of work for me because I have to make preparation with uh electrical and getting a couple of concrete pads poured for the unit to sit on outside so if you're available this week later in the week there's going to be some work that's going to be done down there in preparation for that I'm thankful for all the Lord is providing for he is faithful to us amen although there's not been work going on down there uh I want you to know that it's constantly going through my head it has it has residence right now but it's it's how things get done um and and then with what is going on in our home and and traveling and so forth but God is faithful I'm grateful for his grace to us he is just so full of loving compassion to us he knows how to take care of us he knows what we can handle and when we've handled that he he sees that uh We've accomplished that then he sends another test for us because his ultimate goal for me and I hope for you is at the end of this journey for him to say Well done my good and faithful servant and then he's going to add something else to it hear ye him adopted Sons that's what I'm looking for friends to accomplish what he has called me in this earth to accomplish so that others can know that there is a people that is going to become just like Jesus amen Jonathan come on brother ellias brother Austin will you go to the people today we bless you in the name of the Lord as you give your tithe and offering for the for the work of the Lord keeping Covenant with him he has promised that he would pour out blessings that we would not have room enough to receive and that's what we base our lives on it was his promise we walk in his promise amen God bless you brother [Music] johnise as a look back on all of my days so many times so many ways I have been blessed and all I can say is God is still good sometimes the night brings sorrow and pain sometimes my tears flow like the rain but through it all he's never never changed and God is still good oh God is still good when the RS roll High my God is still good all through the night done all I can don't understand my God is still good oh clouds of Down May darken my way Showers of blessing they come any day you'll bring me through and I'll Stand and say God is to good there have been times I've let him down I made mistakes but still I found I Stumble and fall yet through it all my God is still good oh mercy still clows from the palm of his hands he'll give me Grace and he'll help me to stand I'll Stand and say my God is still good oh my God is still good when the waves roll God is still good oh through the night when I've done all I

have been times I've let him down i' made mistakes but still I found I may stumble and pull yet through it all my God it's still good well Mercy still flows from the palm of his hands he will give Grace and he'll help me to stand all those he knows how unworthy I am my God is still good oh my God is still good when the waves roll out God is still good all through the night when I've done all I

clouds of Doubt May darken my way Showers of blessing may come any day he'll bring me through and I'll Stand and say my God is still good hallu oh yes he is he is he is he is good he is good [Music] hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord amen well I started out traveling for the Lord many years years ago I've had a lot of Sorrow had a lot of grief and woe but when would stumble then would humble down and there would say I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now oh I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now got to make it to Heaven somehow how though the devil tempts me and he tries to turn me around he's offered everything that's God and name all the wealth I want and worldly Fame if I could still it wouldn't take nothing for my journey now there's nothing in this world that will ever take the place of God's law silver and gold could never buy a touch from above when my soul needs healing and I began to feel it his power I can say thank you Lord I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now oh I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now got to make it to Heaven somehow though the devil tempts me and he tries to turn me around he's offered everything that's got a name all the wealth I want and worldly Fame if I could still wouldn't take nothing for my journey now there's nothing in this world that could ever take the place God's love silver and gold could never buy his touch from [Music] above when Soul needs healing and I began to feel his power I can say thank you Lord I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now oh I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now got to make it to Heaven somehow though the devil tempts me and he tries to turn me around he's offered everything that's got and name all the wealth I want and worldly Fame if I good still wouldn't take nothing for my journey Now sing it again one more time come on I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now got to make it to Heaven somehow though the devil temps me and he tries to turn me around he's offered everything that's God and name all the wealth I want and worldly Fame if I could still I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now do you feel that way do you feel that way give the Lord a praise love you you may be seated I I realize that uh you know those who have spent most of their life north of the Mason Dixon line and they wouldn't quite understand without a little help the the the negative approach to the words I wouldn't take nothing that usually means negative you know it's it's it you know it's not worth anything I wouldn't take nothing for that you just have it it's just not but when the songwriter wrote it he wrote it about a testimony that someone had given and it means there is nothing that could buy the journey is so valuable the journey every Hill and every Valley and every pothole and every curve and every High Point and every low point the journey has been valuable because Jesus has always been the pr and when Jesus is the prize then whatever you experience in life it's worth it and one of these days you don't feel this way when you're in the midst of the trial but one of these days when you stand before him or fall before him you'll be able to say without any uh reservation it has been worth it all it has been worth it all to see him do you you believe that amen hasn't God been good to us already this morning the worship was just beautiful and you entered in in such a beautiful way and you may not have realized it but your worship was becoming intercession today for our nation and you know we need to be interceding for our nation and uh I'm going you're going to get tired of me adjusting this but I'm going to keep working with it till it's a new headset when we purchased it we purchased two so we wouldn't be without one they're a little pricey and so this one hasn't been worn and so it's got to get used to my fat head and so I'm adjusting and as I sweat it slides and and eventually you know I think I need one surgically implanted or something um but something's pulling it but anyway uh you could hear me without it but the streamers might not be able to so we want to make sure that that they can hear I'm hearing every day really it's the truth thank you so much from the streamers how blessed and how helped and how encouraged they are by being able to stream and I might just tell you that something transitioned and you didn't know it uh but we have doubled our internet speed and we have been able to do that really because we saved on other things we were able to double it without any more money involved so what we have is a is a miracle situation and Gregory brother Gregory May was able to help us put some of that together now the old companies are not happy with us they're not happy with us but we were able can you imagine imagine double the speed hul what do I say how do I describe that is it is it in terabytes or what is it in 250 megabytes upload and download and it's fiber optic dedicated line to Phoenix City so no one else is pulling on our line and it's not even available out here so we we pioneered it brought it to this area some years ago and now we have finally been able to negotiate it down double our Speed without any additional money and we're very thankful for that we got out from under a little maintenance agreement on our old phone system too and you know it's just always something happening and uh that that has to go on whether you know anything about it or not um if you're interested and why you know it never dawned on me I told brother gy it never dawned on me that we could do one at a time uh and and maybe you're wondering why well the money was only there for one but when God makes the way then then there'll be two sir and it just never occurred to me that that we could even do it that way but uh an old softball buddy of the boys some of you will know know him by his his uh softball name toothpick I've cheered for toothpick a time or two and uh go toothpick knock it out of here um and so toothpick has come through for us with his company and and brother gy has been working with him and he didn't hesitate to come put in one I mean his money but but you know some of the bigger outfits or they would just say that's too much trouble to come twice and do it all but God is good he he's got it all in his great big capable hands now let me just say this to you we've all known that uh the the life of former president Trump was in Jeopardy we've all known that there were many people he's a very controversial polar figure and there are people who love him too much and there are those who love him and there are those who hate him and there are many who would like to see him dead just like you know some others who have a call of God on their life the devil would like to kill them he'd like to kill you and at least three times I have seen president Trump uh in danger in the spirit and I have prayed for him I know you have the last time I had a burden for him I saw a bull's eye that had been painted right on his Temple and uh I I prayed seriously sincerely prayed for uh two two days at least maybe three and I felt good about it I felt like that that immediate threat had passed I've heard several people last night who were uh experts in the field and they say that he had turned I watched it I saw it you've seen it uh he turned to look at the big screen he likes to see how he looks he does and he turned to the big screen and just in time milliseconds he turned back and many experts said in those milliseconds of turning it went from what would have been his Temple to his ear and you know we we'll never know you you I can assure you we'll never know all that's involved the the original person that that the whole thing was attributed to was changed through the night night and I don't know if it really was or if the media just did that or not but by by by the morning it was someone entirely different than who they said it was initially who did the shooting and you can rest assured that that uh he has been spared many times over than that and and and I don't like there are many things that I don't like that he says or that he has done but I have to tell you that those were some of the best just like God said said I'm going to give this nation a reprieve and that's exactly what he did and coming out of the Obama years we needed some help in this nation so regardless of what you think about his personal opinions or whatever uh we had a very good four years and we've had a very hard four years now maybe you're wealthy enough that it hasn't affected you but it's affected me that's right it's affected me and I'm sure that it has the price of groceries you know and gas and and it's just really been a serious thing and it's really funny because uh people will say now that the president has nothing to do with that but those same people complained you know when someone else was President why don't he do something why don't he do something so anyway you know it's all it's all corrupt red and blue Republican and Democrat just corrupt but I would think that maybe a republican would be a a better shot than a you get it because they believe in having access to protect themselves so they've practiced a bit along the way that didn't go over too good but it's funny to me it's funny to me I believe that God did spare him I do I do I believe it could have been different the expert experts said that it could have easily taken him out it would have been an amazing shot shot it would have been an amazing shot had he not turned and uh first first report first notification shots have been fired at the Trump rally so we said okay somebody's there acting crazy and then the next notification said that they thought that President Trump had been shot I appreciate his courage I appreciate the fact that he likes his shoes there must be some nice shoes he said three times wait wait wait I want my shoes let me get my shoes I need my kicks I want to go to the hospital with my shoes on and I don't know what the rest of the rest of the folks were doing but I admire those brave men and two Brave women did you know there was one of the women who put herself in direct line of fire to protect him I appreciate that woman I don't think that I don't don't think that that should be her career of choice I'll be totally honest with you but she chose that and she certainly has done the duty she wasn't hiding behind anybody she was on the front side of that and so anyway I didn't want to say too much about it except that I believe that the tone of the worship shifted and it became intercession for for this nation and for and for our pres former president and for our president now if if it would have been him I would have been equally grieved and I would have thought how horrible that someone would do that to a poor old man in his condition he's on his way to to Eternity uh anyway living on a borrowed moment and I would have said the same thing how terrible that is it's it's like what has happened Through The Years in Russia and places like that this nation was never founded on that kind of violence and we're just believing that uh that it caused something to move that will that will bless this nation and help us in the future the only hope is Jesus if your hope is in any candidate you're in trouble you're in trouble well I'm glad our hope is in the Lord aren't you Tuesday is your birthday did you know that Michaela and you're going to be 14 did you know that that's that's a lot and we want to wish you a happy birthday this coming Tuesday God bless [Applause] you is Elisha back there Elisha did you know you have a birthday coming up are you going to be eight that's a lot eight that's new beginning so you're just starting over and that's on Wednesday Let's uh wish Elisha a happy [Applause] birthday on Thursday of this week brother and sister Waller some faithful streamers of ours are going to have a wedding anniversary so we want to say God bless you all and we hope you have a wonderful wedding anniversary and we look forward to seeing you again soon and brother Ryder has a birthday I don't know how many but it it's uh it's two or three anyway on Friday long long time friend of the ministry in South Africa and he's planning to be here with his family for camp meeting this year and so we want to send him a very happy birthday on Friday God bless you brother let's get ready for the word would you stand uh Kate asked for the weekend off he was asked to come and play the piano for a set of Youth meetings back to school meetings in uh Manchester Tennessee where Brother David Siler is is the pastor and uh he wanted to do that and we miss him uh but we appreciate his gift and talent and God has been using him there and we're thankful for that and young people need to see young people they do they need to see young people setting an example of giving it all for the Lord do you agree with that we we we've got it it's the the the young people are not the leaders of tomorrow or or the Church of tomorrow like the old-timers used to say they're the Church of today that is the truth that's the Church of today and so they need to be prayed over constantly consistently I hope you uh help me to do that because they need it young married couples too they're still young and they need lots of prayer and lots of support I I think I'll I'll let that be for the music would you give these musicians and singers a a hand of thank you you God bless [Applause] you God bless you every one of you isn't the Lord good to us amen would you turn in your Bible this morning I am a little unsure where I wanted to to start in my scripture reading but I'll go to 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and I will read King James and I will let you to be seated then if you promise to to give the same attention to the Amplified uh I won't make you stand that long but we are doing this morning part three uh of a sermon series called separated and yolked separated and yolked we could say loosed and then bound bound to something else loosed from something and connected to something else and the Lord as I Was preparing this the first for the first service the spirit of the Lord said well it's from the world to the word we're being separated from the world so that we can be yolked to the word there is a yoke that you and I want to wear it's the one offered to us by by the Lord Jesus in Matthew chap 11 that's the Yoke that we want to wear in this hour of folks this is real I don't know if you are experiencing God every day I experience him every day I'm in the word every day I'm in serious prayer every day my relationship with Jesus Christ is not for Sunday and Tuesday only I I want you to know that I'm not boasting I just want you to know that uh it's not out of sight out of mind for me you are are in my heart you are on my prayer list and uh I wrestle for you sometime when you don't know you're being wrestled for I'm not saying that for your appreciation I'm saying that that I take this position very serious it's not just the preaching that I want to do but I want to I want to war for you when necessary you can make it I want to tell you oh yes you can and it just depends on you I appreciate what the Lord spoke through Benjamin I believe it's just like that you got one more chance before you spiral and and now we don't believe you know we're not T I don't think in any way the spirit of God was talking about passing that place of of of no return you know I I truly believe that God will go the extra mile for those that are his uh this this concept of sending away your day of Grace I believe that applies more to the church than it does the bride I heard what Jesus said when he said all that the father hath given me what did he say will come I won't lose any of them and so I believe that what the spirit of the Lord was saying is you're about to to find that slippery slope of spiral and and you you pay a price when you're in that cycle brother have you ever been there you just you know you just spend around without a without a head and uh dizzy you know you can be dizzy spiritually and and I think the Lord was saying I'm giving you an opportunity and and I was standing there praying when he said that Lord help us to get our feet on the solid rock it's Jesus he's our Solid Rock and he's what we have to keep ourselves connected to abiding in are you with me uh I hope so 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14 be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers now I want you to know this isn't just in marriage it's not it is it is in marriage it's a sin it's wrong it's unbelief it's dangerous to enter into a love relationship with someone who is not a Spirit-filled believer I'll be honest not only that they ought to believe what you believe because it will certainly help things out but it also means in business it means in close relationship because we can be yolked many ways other than just marriage be you not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness I I want to say this I know you're standing but I want to say this that remember that the concept of the Yoke we preached this already because of the anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed the concept of the yoke is that heavy timber that's laid on the shoulder of The Oxen and I want you to know that oxen are known for their stubbornness and and you don't want to be yoked up tied up with an ox that won't follow the instructions of the man driving the cart if you've got one Ox going one way and one another way that's what the the word here is then you're certainly not going to accomplish anything no righteousness in that just confusion uh Babylonian confusion will prevail when you get hooked up uh yolked up with someone who is not as light as you are who is not walking in the life that you're walking in and so see that it's one pulling one way and one pulling the next and you know that can happen in a Christian marriage when both are not fully submitted but it definitely will be there in a situation where one is not a Believer for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with with Darkness are you following and what Concord hath Christ with bile or what part ha he that believeth with an Infidel good question it's a question Paul is saying what in the world back please okay what part he hath that believeth with an Infidel Christ and bile or or or someone who believes with someone who doesn't believe and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols so even churches have to be careful who they link up with even churches because you're supposed to make sure you stay clear of idolatry and paganism so even churches have to be careful for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God ha said I will dwell where in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people this is a covenant it's a vow isn't it it certainly is wherefore come out wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you now that is pretty straight talk because it tells us that we are not only judged by what we participate in but we are also judged by what we touch just let that sink in touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord all Mighty may God help us today in his word you may be seated but I would very much like to share this with you in the Amplified do not be unequally yolked with unbelievers do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them inconsistent with live your faith you know faith is not our decoration faith is our foundation faith is not optional it's not like Cosmetics it's not like something you add on or lay off but faith is our foundation and our faith in Jesus Christ should dictate every decision that we make in life for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God even the timing in our life should be ordered of the Lord because we as we've learned here in seasons and cycles of seed and harvest we've learned that if you do the wrong thing in the wrong season it's not good and even if you do the right thing in the wrong season it's not good so not only is the thing you're doing important but what season you do it in is equally important recently someone was a a friend a part of this ministry long distance to us was instructed of the Lord to do a particular thing that was going to be a bit spontaneous and a bit sacrificial and he needed to know the timing and the Lord directed him to a verse of scripture in the New Testament where Paul was saying I need to be in Jerusalem before such and such and the Lord took that verse which God has done for me before somebody said isn't that lifting it out of context not really because God can take a verse of scripture directed to someone else H and then by Rama by by a by an inspired moment he can take that same verse lift it off the page and even perhaps slightly out of context it was dealing with Paul but he can lift it up a little bit and use that to help direct your steps God's used the Bible that's what you really mean when you say I'm using my Bible for a road map God will use a Bible story or a Bible character to speak to you in your life in in the present time he can't do that for a lot of people because they don't ever open the book but if you open the book God can direct your eyes and he can direct your fingers and and uh I think you know sometime people say I just open the Bible up and start reading nothing wrong with that God knows how to put you in the right place I just believe it like that all right he goes on uh to say you you don't want to come you know do not make mism alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them inconsistent with your faith for what partnership have right living and right standing with god with iniquity and lawlessness so I think that even speaks to us about our business we should hire people we should we should employ people who can walk in the same kind of a with God in faith that we're walking in and we should never feel forced by the world standards or really anything else other than the leadership of the lord we should know that we are joining oursel because listen let me tell you something one aen one aen in the tribe can can cause the blessings of God to dry up and one Jonah on the boat can C the whole boat to rock so you want to know who you're boating with you want to know who you're who you're tenting with don't you this is just just practical Christianity for what partnership hath right living and right standing with god with iniquity and lawlessness or how can light have fellowship with Darkness somebody said well I have to work with people that aren't Believers that's right and you have to get along with them but you're not making an alliance with them you're not yoking yourself to them you're not bowing down to their Pro their uh you know pronoun requests or whatever you you're you're just being who you are a light in the darkness but when you are joined with someone then your souls begin to line up and join up and the soul is made up of the mind and the will and the emotions and if you want trouble you get your mind lined up with somebody who doesn't even try to have the mind of Christ you you get your emotions connected to someone who is still reeling and rocking from all the cares of Life listen folks Christians have as many problems as unbelievers but Believers have somebody to go to is't that good news and so we're not saying that Believers we don't have any junk or we don't have any scars but I'm telling you something healing it's hard for deep healing to come when you're dealing with an alliance that's not biblical God didn't start it he didn't build it in the first place how can light have fellowship with with Darkness now in verse 15 he said what Harmony can there be between Christ and bile the devil or or what has has a believer in common with an unbeliever how many of you have ever found that out even in your family you have to you have to really scramble to find something to talk about sometime because you're not interested in the same stuff and have you ever found yourself pretending to be interested in something not ugly things but a little pretend of of interest because you just want to keep the conversation moving and but really you could care less they don't understand saying what agreement can there be between a temple of God and and one filled with Idols for we are the Temple of the Living God even as God said I dwell in and with and among them and will walk in and with and among them and I will be their God and they shall be my people powerful references were given to you there at the end of that in the amplif so come out from among unbelievers and separate sever yourselves from them says the Lord remember you you you've got to be in the world but not of the world you don't have to laugh at their filthy joke you don't have to be a religious fanatic you don't have to praise the Lord every sentence but you don't have to laugh at their junk you don't have to tap your your foot to their music you don't have to wag your head to what they're listening to you have to watch yourself and you'll be singing along and you don't want to do that because you've got to have a testimony that screams that life real life only comes from Jesus so come out from among them come out from among unbelievers and separate sever yourselves from them says the Lord and touch not any unclean thing and I will receive you kindly and treat you with favor you you can't ask God to bless that's what he has cursed you you're putting God in a terrible place you can't ask him to bless what he cursed you can ask him to help you get through the the consequences of your poor decisions and he will but you can't really ask for his favor right when there was no favor to be there in the beginning I I tell you God doesn't treat one one way and one another way he he he tries to be uh uh equal and fair and and you can't expect God to bless a covenant that that is with an unbeliever that God didn't bless in the beginning the same way let's look let's use the example of marriage you can't even expect God to bless a marriage like described here in the same manner that he's going to bless a marriage where two Believers have come together I'm sorry I didn't write the book I'm just telling you what the book said so really you're praying Lord let it be the best it can be but it has to be according to your word oh my don't shoot the mailman please and I will be a father to you and you shall be my sons and daughters says the Lord Almighty that's the message we have to keep giving to our young people this is life this is for life I I I shed some tears sister Teresa this weekend I shed some tears they weren't sad tears they were happy tears for Josiah and for Jennifer because I I counsel them both at different times in their lives and you and others here I I'm not saying I've done anything but I'm just saying I've heard at times I don't want to embarrass him maybe I'm glad he's not here right now he's just streaming maybe he's sleeping go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep but anyway I I I stood with him in several places I I had a a a a real strong memory of standing with him out there on the little porch coming out my office door and he sat on my couch and and and tears in his eyes and and he said I just don't think there'll ever be anybody for me and that breaks your heart I know it must have broke his mama's heart to hear something like that and and what did you say to him every time we all said the same thing just hold on just hold on what you don't want is the wrong one and in those dark seasons when we didn't always know where he was or what he was involved in our prayers were always hold him Lord don't let him make a mistake now that will cheat him out of what you've got for him in the future and Jennifer came here broken and scarred by Life by University life you understand never uh being able to forgive herself for for what she had walked through and she didn't think you know that that that she could be wanted and uh it's just a it's just really chokes me in a good way to see that God can get Beauty so you young people hold on on God can get Beauty out of ashes and he can bring healing out of heartbreak and and this was our attitude and I know it was mostly yours Josiah got the little family this this weekend he got the little family that he that he wanted and maybe now that he sees it's just not uh press a button pop them out maybe he'll let the Lord guide him in how many are to come it's not a Coca-Cola machine you you need the full picture how many of you remember it just kind of changes your mind a little bit it it calms you down just a tad when you see the whole shabang but anyway I I'm thankful that they waited I'm thankful that God cleaned them up and gave them to each other and uh of course they weren't teenagers but who cares who cares they they you you know I was told as a child and couldn't have believed it then but they say if you you know if you marry too early and then later if you married in alive you wouldn't even marry the same person because you're you are not look looking for the same things but God knows and and I think everybody ought to take hope I don't think you ought to feel like that your your chance has expired I think you ought to wait wait on the right one it would be foolish for you to yoke yourself up with someone who is not a Believer I don't care how cute he is I don't care how smashing she is she's going to droop and drop like everybody else and he oh let's get and he is too when that when that big strong chest of a man slides down to his waist it's a dadbod VIN whether he's a dad or not so you better be looking beyond the badger skin brother and you better find the character that is there isn't that right so God's pretty pretty clear here King James and Amplified come out from among them separate yourselves say at the Lord don't touch the unclean thing and I will receive you and I not only receive you but I'll give you relationship like you've never known before I'll be a papa to you you'll be my sons and daughters we we'll have more than and a covenant and a vow we'll have a relationship we'll have a love affair how many of you know that's a pretty good deal that God is is offering to us we look at some of these scriptures and and and it stirs our heart to believe that God knows exactly what he's talking about in the message Oneness brother bandam said here we are in the end time coming from the East and the West W North and South what are we doing we're getting ready we're getting ready for that rapture we we're not preaching a social gospel here we're not preaching a social justice message here the church is doing that the church is fulfilling their purpose the church is feeding the hungry you help when you can particularly those of the household of faith people criticize me for that but I'm telling you the message came to separate us from the passion of of social justice out there and what the church gets all beat up about in this hour you better focus on getting ready for that Rapture split bit second he's you know he's trying to rassle his straw hair he's tightening up his red tie he's about to slip out to give a speech AR rousing speech in a community that's already known to favor him in every way he's expecting to ramble through at least an hour without notes with everyone hanging on every word and and unless he had some kind of warning only seconds only seconds he just hears the sound and reaches for his ear my point in that is he expected to to go home and eat a snack and go to bed with his shoes I think beside his bed so could watch over them he had no idea how close he was to Eternity it just suddenly it went from a shot in the C to now the president has been hit I want you to know uh those who have lived through some of those days announced off of that uh uh Hill in Dallas the president has been shot years later his brother shot and uh the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr a shock went all over the world we could be dealing with that kind of shock today he better know he better know I'm using him as an example he better know that he's fixing things up with God and you and I better not only know we're fixing things up with God we better know we're Rapture Ready remember we're not going to be judged in Rapture by what's only abounding in our lives but we're going to be judged by what's put there the seed that is within us and I want you to know everything we need to make the Rapture is in us right now because we've receive the word of God that's what it takes to get out of here but that seed is watered and at different times it blooms and produces fruit in our life and we want to live a fruitful life for him but we want to know that we are ready and the people started gathering in the 60s from the North and the South and the East and the West they gathered to Rally around a word that they discerned was sent to help prepare them for the Rapture I believe that the message of the revelation of Jesus Christ that he has sent to us is not for everyone I don't believe it was sent for the church at large I believe it was sent to an elected number I don't know the number I know there's some in the East and the and the and the west and the North and the South I know some have light skin and some have dark skin and some have un between in between skin some from one continent and some from another continent it's not about one Church it's about those who have received a real unveiling of Jesus Christ I don't even agree with those who say that's not possible without acknowledging the ministry of brother brandham I don't even believe that because I believe God is obligated to reveal himself to you as his seed wherever you are for me he happened to use the ministry of brother brandham and I think you're going to have to come under the influence of somebody who's got it that's right to see the importance of it and the most ideal way would be to hear it for yourself but if it doesn't happen that way I'm not going to support those who stand and say you've got to belong to a particular church and you've got to you know have so many years under your belt with the ministry of the Prophet to be ready it's not a man's Ministry that dresses us for the rapture it's the revealing of the word it's the word revealed that's what our wedding garment is and again I think the best way and the easiest way I is to hear it through the messenger but if it doesn't happen that way I believe God is able to send an angel to the deepest parts of the Orient I believe God is able now listen I can't help but have any testimony than that because I believe what I believe today because God was working on me way before I knew there was a to be a prophet or or or what his ministry was God started talking in my heart why do you think that is I believe it's cuz I was his and was getting me ready to hear what was to come so don't let it hang up in one man from a generation ago you you you will find that feeding on that once you hear it once you know what it is feeding on that is what's going to help you be ready no doubt I just want to make sure I say it in so many different ways that the critics will just have a harder time misunderstanding I'm so glad for how I heard it amen and I thought it was all perfect and I thought that most anybody who knew about it would have to be perfect I couldn't imagine how they could be anything but perfect sitting under such a perfect word boy did I find out was my honeymoon shortlived I found out that some of the rottenest gathered around this and when it started throwing me I had to go to God about it and he said well wouldn't it be that way hasn't it always been that way hasn't truth always drawn a mixed crowd and that word just continues to separate us from the make believer and from the unbeliever how many of you identify as a Believer a believer of the Lord Jesus Christ he said now getting ready for that Rapture getting ready for holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every till every fiber is filled with holy GH the Holy Ghost what if you can't quote what message it was from what if you can't remember the title what if you don't remember the paragraph number or the year that's not what it's about what if you can't recite uh this or that in order what if you can't get the virtues in order what if you can't from memory give us the names of the church ages and The Messengers I don't think that's the big deal what I think is the biggest deal is that we hold steady under the influence of this revealed word until every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost and Jesus said when he the Holy Ghost has come he will lead you guide you and direct you into all Truth by by all truth he said then she'll go up when when when every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost he separating you from church anity so that he can join you up to himself amen we're waiting for holding steady a moment until every fiber every cell is filled up with the Life of Christ through the infilling and refilling of the Holy Ghost then she'll go up he said oh my calling his people together not to a particular Tabernacle or unto a man only but calling is people together to himself in the true Oneness I'm slowing it down with himself because it's his one Holy Spirit by one Spirit are we all individually powerful I like this way powerful by one Spirit are we all individually baptized into one body collectively not one Church body one church family but the collectively the body of Jesus Christ there there's there's an African portion of the body of Jesus Christ a European portion Asian portion of the body of Christ and yet we're all one and Jesus Christ listen not just waiting on the Great Escape but Jesus Christ living with his spirit in our flesh our body serving the church if you think you need a title there it is servant servant of the church servant of Jesus Jesus Christ you get under that inspiration and you won't look for the janitor to pick up the piece of trash you'll do it because you'll see that a part of your ministry is ultimately serving Christ and in order to do that we also serve his church body his people our brothers and sisters doing and then doing the same things he did as a as an ins sign to the world that we're in the last days getting ready for the Rapture oh I love him don't you do you this morning if you do shout Amen in the message God's only provided place of worship inport he said if I taught you a Methodist message it would take no effect on on you this is bride time bride time the pressure that falls on the local church in this hour even the message Associated church is to be like other churches if we were more like other churches our families would come if we were more like other churches we could invite our neighbor if we were more like other churches we could have our coworkers ERS to come I'm so sorry for your grief and I'm sorry that you're looking for something just like all the others and and I just advise you find a flavor that you can swallow but because this is we we're never going to be able to go anywhere by only bringing a Methodist message when this is now bride time if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect does that mean that it wasn't true no the message of Moses was true the message of Noah was true the message of Jesus of course is always true and Timeless but some of the preaching of these Messengers was directed specific L to an age we can look back and say now we know that even in that we take something because all scripture is inspired and given to us for for help but you can't take that message of Moses and make it work in another age are you following me so you can't take Luther's message of justification and think think you're going to feed the bride with only that or Wesley's message of sanctification you can't just feed the bride with that or Pentecostals message of restoration of gifts tongue talking you can't feed the bride with just that in fact we have a harder responsibility than any other age because we have to take the truth of every age and use it in our day while leaving behind the fanaticism of man-made religion that followed those messages and whether they're willing to admit it or not that same Spirit has formed itself around the ministry of brother brandham trying to make it another flavor or another denomination come on now another organization and God can't move in that we leave behind the error of all of the other days we bring forward the truth and we thank God for the grace that was upon men like Luther to keep his head above the fanaticism that surrounded his own message you understand you had to do the same for William brandom because there were nuts nuts nuts that followed him real Bonafide nuts believing all kinds of nutsy things and he had to keep his head above all that you know Becky called and she said Daddy they're doing it again I'm over at the house of some of the leaders you know of the church and they're doing it again they're doing it again you know what they were doing at least we've never had to worry about that so much around here sometimes they've gathered to say what kind of a devil I was but I don't think they've gathered too many times to say that I was God they they were gathered that Sunday afternoon to talk about how brother brandom had to be Jesus Christ you know he really did have to be Jesus Christ so do you it's his life in us but that's not what they were saying she said Dad I can't take anymore they're added again he said I'm coming to get you Becky I'm not even going to slow down just I'm going to open the door you jump in and we'll tear out of there why was it so urgent because he didn't want to be a part or that influence upon his family wonder what he'd say if he could hear some of them talking now he didn't want them under that so every messenger who brought a a a message that that that shifted really the whole church ages they had to make sure they didn't get under the influence of some of those nuts you and night today we have to watch especially as we go out among them we've been you know pretty isolated here through the years and it's been okay it's really been okay and I know some of you long for Fellowship outside the local body and that's okay but you just got to be careful that you don't get under the influence of nuts cuz they're out there you got to know that the message is right for the season you're not going back and trying to force something that's already established on the bride you may remind them you may go back and bring it forward but but you you got to you got to move on you know you've got to you've got to make sure you're in the right timing because we're getting ready for Rapture because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed are you with me let me make sure that means you can't water a bride seed with the Methodist message you can't water the bride seed with a Baptist message or a Pentecostal message or even a bromite message the bride sees through that stuff she doesn't want that that's not what she's looking for so when you're sitting there and they say to you that every word that he spoke everything that came out of his mouth was thus sayth the Lord you ought to have a sirene going off on your head you ought not to be standing up saying Amen to that you ought to have that Holy sirene that says woo wooo nuts you you you can't because that's more denominational than it is revelational you can't feed the bride you can't water the bride's seed with a denominational message or one that hangs only in a man and there's no checks and balances other than the tapes there's got to be checks and balances and that is the absolute scripture that's right I'm on it and I'm going to stay on it because it's going to be a it's going to be a separating factor in this uh uh uh very end of the end so you you've got to get the right water for the right seed it won't grow in any other condition it must be the conditions that grows it now you can take a chicken egg next paragraph and put it in an incubator which should be under a hin but it'll hatch anyhow put it under a pup it would hatch it's the Warmness the condition that makes it hatch so it has to be under condition it has to be in the right you can make these quotes in the wrong atmosphere and the Egg won't hatch it's not just the seed it's not just the egg it's also the atmosphere it's also the condition you got to be in the right condition and in the right atmosphere so that the water can come and fall on the seed you could take a good live egg and put it under a dead hen it won't hatch why because there's no warmth there you can put a bride seed in a denominational church and it won't hatch they've tried it oh yes they've tried it they've tried to slip from here and and and and find their way to UPC or something like that and and they found out they just can't hang with it they've even come back and told me one re not too too long ago came back and said I I was okay I got I made it through Christmas it was hideous it was horrible it was terrible but I made it through Christmas all the carryings on inside the church but I made it but then the pastor announced one Sunday I'm going to teach on the Book of Revelation he said I knew I was ruined then because once God opens your eyes to How This Book of Revelation has come alive in our day you could never go over to 7-Day Adventist and get all that satisfied hello takes the condition the condition has to be right now notice uh paragraph 11 and this was from this morning charity paragraph 11 of the of the message Divine love Sovereign Grace Prince Prince Albert Saskatchewan Canada uh uh paragraph 11 now no notice Abraham just an ordinary Man by but God by election Sovereign Grace called Abraham when there's many young men in the land in that day I want you to think about that it could have been any young man instead of singing Father Abraham we could have been singing father Josiah or father Steven or or or father somebody else but it was Abraham it was Abra that God chose among all the others he did it by election by Sovereign Grace even though there were many young men that could have had the call there was probably some more capable of doing the job as the world would think than Abraham was but look at that God he's not looking at what Seminary did he graduate from what cemetery did he hang out in how many DDS does he have after his name uh or or pothole digs you know phds H how many of them does he have behind his name no no no God knows the heart he said that's it are you with me we should study to show ourselves approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed but we shouldn't expect the denominations to educate a preacher of this truth sometimes you wonder how God takes the foolish things to confound the wise but God knows the heart of man men usually well you know you people when you're selecting your pastors you usually slip the guy in great big seven-footer with curly hair and so forth the Hollywood type sometimes God don't even choose that type you want something that'll be a mixer that'll go to the card party with you and set in the games and a mixer uhoh man wants mixers but God wants separators he wants to separate you from that stuff not to punish you but so that he can join you to the word just a minute hey am man because you can't have one foot in Christ and one foot in the world you see the little girl who stands in the mirror and sneaks the makeup out of her purse that she bought at Walmart and puts that on her eyes so that she can see herself in the mirror she's already already struggling there's already something a drift in the heart that's right sometimes we seasoned Believers we don't help them because we reach back into the world and pick up little do dads and shiny shiny shinies sparklies we want the little white stripe on our toenail we know we wouldn't paint them pink and all other crazy colors no holy ghost sister would do something like that but they'll just go get the little white stripe painted on the tip because there's something listen it's the same spirit that makes the teenager go in and try the manicure on their eyes that's what brother brandom called it he didn't say mascara Same Spirit Same Spirit that makes a Godly woman want a shorter skirt so that she can show off her bicycle Bridges underneath same kind of spirit that makes us reach out cuz we want to be we want to be different but we want to be as you know we want to oh was quiet remember shiny shiny shiny God wants separators the the church World wants mixers hello that same woman will go to all kinds of degrees to get her strap pined so that you don't see it but she likes to wear those Bloomer things those bicycle shorts and whatever else you call them down way past her knee with her you know miniskirt on I said to them when they begin to ask me they don't ask me anymore but when they begin to ask me I said now you've got to decide is that outer garment or undergarment if it's undergarment you said that's for modesty if that's undergarment for modesty then brother random said a woman ought not to let her undergarments show and I agree with him see it's not those big things it it's those little shiny shiny shiny it's those little things that the enemy will use to try to pull us back in that direction I I even said you know uh we were wearing uh and I've got one I don't wear to preach but Ben Benjamin gave me a a rubber a bracelet a rubber band type thing you put it's not really a bracelet but you wear it on your wrist so I guess you would call it that and and what does it say on it God can't fail I don't want to take their testimony but that's for a reason Cade bought me a a a pen I should have wore a tie tack that sat on it he had made for us God can't fail because in all that we were going through they were going through we were going through with Elana's birth a as God be to move there for us a notification came in or something like that from your email because you had ordered some things like that and it and the and the message came from God can't fail so right about the time he needed to to to to breathe he looks down and and the note of God can't fail God what a reminder and we had some blue and white ones that we wore to remember to pray for Israel nothing wrong with that but what happens is then you then folks are not satisfied with that it's not shiny shiny shiny I'm just telling you not condemning anybody not directing this Truth at anybody I'm just saying be on your guard then your underarms will be showing and the next thing and it just goes on and be on guard you say these things don't matter I want you to know they may not matter to the church but those getting ready for the Rapture they they are not going to be mixers they're not going to be legalists they're not going to be Fanatics either but they are going to be separators they're not going to do all kinds of crazy things with their hair people do today make it all different colors and twist it all up it's a glory it's not for your convenience God didn't give these sisters that hair for their convenience I pray for them when they when they have to go through the weariness of doing something with it I know it's not easy especially if you didn't grow up learning how to deal with it so it's not for your convenience it's a glory on your head as a Nazarite vow we mentioned last Sunday it says something to this old world so be careful what you do with it because it's preaching your life story at Walmart amen and people aren't stupid and they can look at your face and see if you're old enough to have gray hair they're not dumb you're not fooling anybody you're not even fooling yourself Miss miers man wants mixers but God wants separator that's what the trouble today you can't mix the world with Christ it just won't work that's what's a matter with so-called Christian church today you're trying to carry water on both shoulders God wants separators he doesn't want fanatics he didn't want somebody to kick the TV out one week and bring it back in with cable the next week that's fanaticism he wants somebody a full enough of the Holy Ghost to know to discern the will of God for your house for your family you sit your children down in front of some of that slop they make for them today whether it's on your phone or over on the TV you're mixing them you're conf refusing them woo it's a good thing I well no I better not say that had a anyway brother gy will handle all this you'll straighten me all out and straighten you out too you know Divine love Sovereign Grace paragraph 20 he said you know the trouble of it is we don't want to separate ourselves we don't like to do that but God wants us to separate we want mixers God want separat her and you have come out sometime and and you have to come out sometime and stand alone if you ever walk with God that's a problem even in a church this size if somebody feels Justified because they see somebody else doing it that's a dumbest I'm gonna be honest with you folks that's pretty dumb that sounds like a backslider to me who's always looking at somebody else's family looking over there on your Pew to see what you do so they can justify and do it more your eyes aren't to be on each other in this house you're to treat everybody the same whether they keep the standard or not you're to love everybody without judgment and believe that God will do the work no I Don't Preach at every service because it's not necessary but when God drives it home to my heart I want you to hear what you need to hear for That season for that hour so that we don't become too attached to the glistening Delights of Egypt a man's love and commitment is not and and vow is not to be judged by The Bling that he buys for his wife it's his character that we're looking for preach on brother the faith of Abraham let me get this one out now God said then Abraham in order to walk with me you've got to separate yourself from the rest of them God Demands a total separation but you want to bring a lot of the world along with you when you come in and receive the Holy Ghost you say well I was taught to be this and I was taught the days of Miracles has pass you better leave that thing behind or sometimes they come here well I was taught that there was not to be any kind of tongues without interpreter and I was taught this and I was taught that and I was taught the other thank God for your teaching just thank God for your teaching but don't judge us that's right you better leave that thing behind as long as that holds with you it'd be like Abraham started out with lot and his father there's trouble in the camp and God never did bless Abraham until he separated himself and done what God told him to do and you'll never receive the holy ghost in the fullness you'll never walk in the spirit of God until you totally separate your things from unbelief get away from the world come out of the world I know you think I'm crazy he said but if I am just let me alone I'm happy this way I'd rather be like this in the way I was see I looked at my sacrifice one time and then separation the world wants mixers and he goes back to that curly hair Pastor type thing uh get up on the the pull pit and say Amen real amen amen you know permit you to look at television all night Wednesday night too let you out early so we can see some of the television programs that you ought not to see Hello won't say nothing when you're reading old true story magazines and filth out on the street going to your office and Pinups hanging around well he's a good fer anyhow CZ he pays good God wants you to separate that's what's the matter with the church go in the church and have a little flower sermon about some politician that's up to run and I hope you all vote for him and afraid if he says anything the deacons H the deacons will throw him out I know Pastors in this message afraid of the deacons well brother they might as well throw me out to begin with cuz I believe in preaching the gospel just throw the axe to the root of the tree God wants separators what does the church want mix mix mixers let's go to Revelation 18 and I'll take another 10 or 15 minutes here I think you I think we read this and after these things I saw another Angel come down to heaven have from Heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird wow that's a strong word he goes on for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornications with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies that false religious system has greased the palms of other nations like Kuba like many others and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people yes that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues God was saying I'm going to judge her and you don't want to be joined with her you don't want your name on the role of that system when the judgments come for her sins have reached under heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double under her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled to the double to her double how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow Oh therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her that's serious business this is a false system that still affects the church world today and will even greater in the future but will receive the recompense of her behavior her her iniquities will not be forgotten God said and to his elect church he said get out of her if you're baptized in titles you you you've been joined to that system come and take the name of Christ and cancel your old vow call the church and say get my name off the [Music] book I'm not even coming back for Christmas dinner I'm done I'm finished no condemnation in my heart but God has set this bird free I'm no longer in the cage Hallelujah God's only provided place of worship paragraph 90 well that's the way it is in this age we're living in and I'm trying to hurry cuz I ask for a few more minutes uh you've got to find what's God's way of doing it for this age that's what Martin Luther found that's what John Wesley found that's what the Pentecostals found in their age God's age and time to do it now the Pentecostals that brother when I believe is one of his eyes was out a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California the old isusa Street he was laughed at because he was and I hope it's not offensive to say it this way a negro he was black skinned and mo and made fun of a patch on one eye how could God do anything new and fresh and beautiful and world shaking with a man like that but that's exactly the kind of man that God was looking for one who would sell out the him he was made fun of but he brought a message for that age just little body of fellow could hardly sign his name but the Lord revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gives and they come no matter what said it come it did it came but everybody's got in the atmosphere of it and seen it was that age and seen God vindicating that those people could speak with tongues and so forth it happened but then when he went and pinned it down this is the only evidence look what happened it killed it killed it all of it real all of it for today all of it right but you can't pin it down and add your Doctrine and when they started saying if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost it wasn't their Holy Ghost to give and take and decide who had and who didn't have it killed it it denominated it they come along now the same thing like I said a moment ago if you don't believe that he couldn't make mistakes if you don't believe that everything he said was thus sayith the Lord then they're trying to put you out well the reality is you didn't put some of us in and you can't put some of us out you've added your Creed to what he said just like they added the Creed it's got to be by the one evidence of tongues that's not what God was saying that's what they were saying killed it but it goes on that did it then they started separating this and making denominations and one's coming on a cloud and the other one's coming in a bush and oh my there it goes that's what denominations does God is not an author of denomination because denomination is Babylon and he's not the author of confusion we see her all you don't have to be even intellectual to see that aren't you glad we can all get it it's Babylon see tradition think of it sincere people now still because they believe that there still needs to be one sincere place place where God meets notice verse two Worship in that place that I have chosen the sacrifice of course where they worshiped over the sacrifice the place that I chose not what you choose what men choose but what I have chosen you Worship in that place there shows theirs then only one place others in vain it must not be of your choice but it must be his choice and now see if this doesn't sound like the modern Church well I don't have to go to church or you're so narrow-minded why why do you drive all the way down there you'll even fuss at women about preaching and women bobbing their hair and Men about these other things why you're so narrow-minded they say things like that all right you don't have to take God's way about it you go on out and do what they do what they do that at you go out where they do that at and you'll find out it's the scripture so in vain do they worship me the scripture said so Jesus spoke of the same thing didn't he see we're almost almost done that every little jot everything you must be faithful in it's always the little the little the little fox that spoils the vine sometimes you leave it's not the big things you do it's the little things that you leave uhoh you didn't respond enough to that it's not the big things you do sometimes it's the little things you leave undone God help us please remember a chain is only as strong as it's the blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have a right to enter in do all God said if it's said for a woman to have long hair you say a man told me not long ago I don't PR preach a closed L and religion I said then you're not preaching the gospel he said God laid it out there he said what to do and you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing what little thing little insignificant Jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little things and do the little things and a woman to let her hair grow by it's just something she can do it's something she can do and she won't even do that just the little things he said oh teach us the great things how can you teach the great things when you won't do the simple common thing because you see your motive and your objective is wrong it's your love to God lord I don't care what you want me to do I don't care what you want me to do I'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it last paragraph it's his choosing the place that I have chosen that's where you worship with your sacrifice how many of you know where that place is it's a place that God has chosen to put his name and he only puts his name on the full counsel of his word so if not the whole counsil of God if the whole Council of God is not being preached they may paint his name on the door but God said it's no more than a den of devils it may say Church of God it may say Assembly of God it may say you know whatever it may say it's not the sign on the door then you'll remember I think I skipped ahead that Sunday and I and I read in Deuteronomy where he said destroy all the places where the Nations you are dispossessing serve their God it's separating it's separating it's separating he said in paragraph 48 God's only provided place of worship the thing I want to speak about this morning is that God has only one place that the worshipper can meet God only one place Through the Ages many have sought for this secret place of God through all the ages ever job wanted to know even job wanted to know where he lived at if I could only go to his house and knock at his door job wanted to find God's dwelling place because there's their God and his family is wor their God and his family worship together and and and then the last Deuteronomy 16:2 and this will this will finish us for today Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd in the place in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there does it mean the same anywhere else hello you must observe it in the place where the Lord has chosen to place his name same message God's only provided Place paragraph 131 notice in here he said seven days shall you eat this unleavened bread now bread is typed Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just a word here and their denomination would have you believe it but the word of God is perfect it's God himself oh please listen to this if there would be anybody here this that replace their Bible with the spoken word book hear this not just a word here and there as a denomination would have you believe but the word of God is perfect it's God himself in letter form called a seed and the right kind of unadulterated faith in that word word will bring the seed to its life you you can't be joined to Christ the word if you're still joined to some form of man-made religion if you're still joined to the world one with the world you can't possibly become one with the word until you severed yourself from one and wrap your arms around I'm telling you folks I'm telling you young people hear what we're saying to you this morning it's very clear looking out across this house that some of you need a big attitude adjustment and there's nothing to do it like the word you don't want to be in that tail spin you want to make make a decision today to throw yourself on the Rock of Ages because there's one thing for sure I know you don't want the Rock of Ages to fall on you if you're going to be any falling done you fall on him it'll break it'll hurt but let me tell you something he'll pick you up and make you stronger than you ever were before you can't intellectualize your way to God and you can't reason your way to truth hello you can't question your way to Revelation if you want revelation musicians are coming if you want revelation from the word you've got to sit in his presence you've got to be willing to build a condition uh around you so that his presence can come and here's why some people need to get the television out of their house here's why some need to do that because the atmosphere that you're creating with that is not the kind of atmosphere where the word is going to jump alive in your spirit and the problem is we don't want to turn the thing off old people will turn it on first thing in the morning and let it run until midnight and all that stuff I tell you about an hour of Fox News is all that anybody could possibly stand because after that they just repeat it over and over the same thing the same clip the same story all day long it get it'll get under your skin you you should uh uh get re turn that thing off get rid of it if you have strength to do so and create an atmosphere so that when you sit down and begin to read the word of God begins to Spring forth alive in your heart you can't whip the Devil with a headline but you can whip him with the revelation of the word you believe that let's stand believe we're not being separated from that to dangle unconnected praise God we're being separated from that so that we can be joined with the Lord what a privilege it is to be invited to become one with him if you believe that say Amen let's come and worship let's get ready and let's worship him for a few moments together this morning he is worthy he's worthy of Our Praise Hallelujah blessed I love you Lord oh your mercy never fails me and all my days I've been held in your hands from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head I will sing of the goodness of
