========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope a lord [Music] hello I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah it's just a wonderful privilege to be able to come to you again at this time I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm also representing today brother Eric Erickson and the staff of the gospel channel we're just thankful for the partnership that God has given us with them anything that we can do to be a blessing to them we want to and anything that we can do to be a blessing to you and that excites us very much we're thankful for all the feedback that you've been giving us and can I just invite you to keep it up and maybe even increase it because it's such an encouragement to us to hear from you we sit here in front of this camera believing in faith that someone is on the other end and when we hear from a warm body it's exciting it lets us know that the message is getting out and that what we do is not in vain and we just greet you all we are thankful to hear from you we're praying over your prayer requests we take that serious I feel like it's a privilege that the Lord would give us this opportunity to pray for you on the other side of the pond and around the world we had a prayer request come in this week from Rome Italy so we're thankful that the gospel channel is reaching even into Italy so let us know where you're watching and if the program is a blessing to you let us know and either way we'd be more than happy to pray for your prayer requests and we invite you as believers to help us pray for the gospel channel that God will continue to meet their needs financially and spiritually so that they can continue to be there for you when you need them and we want to be there for you as well I know that you can imagine the terrible expense large Vence of bringing the gospel channel to you whether it's directly by satellite or through your cable provider or the the Sky box or however it is that you're watching the program it is expensive and we want you to continue to pray and give and partner with the gospel channel and I have a desire a prayer request that I'm laying before the Lord I want to see the doors open for the gospel channel to even expand their outreach and there are a couple of other satellites I'm asking the Lord for a couple of the regions of the world that I would like to know that we're having an impact and so join us in that if you will I want to share a portion of Scripture with you today and we've been focusing on for some time now the Word of God it's so precious I'm so thankful I'm thankful to the men that God used down through the ages the Holy Spirit moved upon them they spoke and wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and in many cases there were faithful scribes you know armor bearers we call them sometime who traveled with the Apostles even the prophets of the Old Testament and in many cases they acted ascribes the man of God would be moved upon by the Holy Spirit and he would actually speak dictate for instance in the case of the Apostle Paul letters would be dictated and even many many theologians and those who study the scriptures believe that Moses also would have used to scribe and he would speak under the inspiration of the Lord and a faithful servant would write it down and record it I'm thankful I have to be honest with you I'm thankful for every person that was used throughout history to help preserve for us the written record of God's Word and then we think about those who sacrifice their lives their families live to translate the scriptures to bring them from the original languages and even out of the Greek so that we could read them in a language that we could understand how many of you are thankful that we have the Word of God in our native tongues I know many of you watching this program English is your native language but for some of you English is not your first language second language may be or it's your third language but but even in other languages throughout Africa and India and parts of Asia where there are not only numerous languages but dialects aren't we grateful that God has allowed his word to be translated in those languages some of the translations are not perfect but the Word of God that they're touching is perfect and we have it you know there was a time that we had all of these and I still have mine you know the the the printed record the study Bibles of all the different languages and the different study methods and well I would almost be ashamed to tell you how many copies of the Bible itself I have and now we're living in such an hour that we can have it on our computer we can even have it in the palm of our hand not one translation but hundreds of translations available god is good this is a good time to focus our lives and build our lives around the Word of God because it's so readily available and let me remind you that the letter itself the written record of God's Word if it's read and we we seek to understand it only from a natural perspective without allowing the Holy Spirit to make it a revelation to us it can get kind of dry and dusty there are many more pieces of literature articles to read maybe you're interested in science maybe you're interested in the latest gossip of the royal family there's so many things that can catch our attention and we can get wrapped up in them and and if the Bible has only been sort of a book to us it may not take a high priority on our list it may be in fact one of the last things we get around to so I encourage you again and I'll probably encourage you the next time we're together to allow the Holy Spirit approach God in prayer and allow the Holy Spirit to take this written record of God's Word and make it more than just another book on your shelf or on your coffee table in your lounge area let God make it a living reality we have this written record of God's Word so that we can know that it is possible for you and I to have a personal intimate close relationship with Jesus Christ there there doesn't have to be a middleman in our relationship with him I don't know about you but I'm thankful for leaders I'm thankful for pastors in fact I believe in the fivefold ministry that we read about in the book of Ephesians I believe that there must be even today men of God who function in the office of apostle prophet pastor teacher and evangelist and how blessed we are to sit under these anointed ministries functioning in their individual God assigned offices and blessing us in different levels and different dimensions for instance those who have the gift of teaching I need to be taught those who have the calling or office of a pastor to to bring the Sheep into Shepherd and disciple them we need pastors we need those fiery evangelists who can travel the the hills and dales the highways and byways presenting the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ I've been following the Lord most of my life and yet I still enjoyed the ministry of an evangelist sometimes I hear a word of the Lord presented in an in a in an evangelistic style I want to be born again all over again I want to accept the Lord into my life all over again so we need that and we need the prophetic element we need the the prophetic office of the fivefold ministry to take the Word of God and help us to discern the present times and seasons of the Lord did you know that that there are herbs and flows there are times and seasons in the things of God there are certain seasons and moments in fact I'm thinking now of the two Greek words that are used in the New Testament for time one is Chronos time and that is kept by the calendar by the watch it's the natural sense of time and then Kairos time that is it's different than natural time you can't tell Kai hero's time on the calendar not even the Hebrew calendar maybe that's a closer way of beginning to discern those things but but it's spiritual times and seasons in other words there are different moments in our life where there are heightened seasons of spiritual activity where God desires to focus on a particular truth every thing recorded in God's Word is true it is yay and a man heaven and earth will pass away but not one shot not one tittle not one vowel mark of the scripture will ever pass away until all things are fulfilled this is the confidence we can have in God's Word but there are those moments when God emphasizes certain truths for certain periods of time or seasons in your life those of you who have been part of a local congregation or church there are themes and you can pick them up in the spirit I don't just mean the pastor preaching on a series but if he's spirit led that's exactly many times how God introduces us to those Kairos moments with him is by an emphasis in the preaching of our leaders of our pastor what is God saying the day what is he focusing on right now what would be of the most benefit in my life and the life of my family these are things that we sometimes have to be sensitive to so that we can discover God's heart for us as his children right now and then we need the Apostolic we need the administrative gift of being able to put things in order because this is a chaotic world and even the business of the kingdom of God and don't be offended when I say business I'm not talking about in in in a sense of monetary business I'm talking about the work of the kingdom what must we do that we might work the works of God today how God desires for us to do the work of the kingdom in 2018 it's going to be different than it was in the time of the earthly ministry of our Lord in Galilee the approach is going to be different and the tools that we have to use are going to be different but of course the truth of the kingdom is ageless it's exactly the same truth today the kingdom of God is within the hearts of men so we need the fivefold ministry we definitely do but I want you to remember that God wants to meet with you he wants to reveal himself his love for you to you as an individual and I'm telling you when you begin to realize that there is a living God on the other end of your prayer it makes a huge difference in how you feel and how you walk before him we're not just praying to a God who has no ability to hear an answer or a God who cannot speak we're praying to a living God who hears who cares and who understands no matter what you're going through right now watching this broke program I want you to know that there is a God who knows exactly how you feel you may feel extremely alone you may feel like there's no one on this planet that you can really pour your heart out to and tell how you feel well I have good news for you the Lord Jesus Christ stands as as intercessor as high priest he desires for us to unburden ourselves on him where did you get such an idea like that brother Shelly from God's Word he said casting all of your cares on me for I care for you I don't know about you but that gives me a tremendous sense of peace today to know that the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua my Messiah cares about me and he knows he already knows when I'm having a bad Monday or a difficult Wednesday he knows all about it but he desires that I would come to him and share it's the kind of relationship that is so powerful when a husband and a wife can come together in that kind of relationship it's how God intended it to be that we could tell our companion our spouse exactly how we feel with fear of being condemned judged or misunderstood let me tell you that there are many marriages on the planet that have not yet even after many years developed that kind of openness and that's a shame because I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ desires to bring healing and strength into marriages so that you can experience that safety there there's no feeling like the safety of a real God ordained relationship especially when it's in the confines of marriage he wants us to look to him in a very similar manner the Bible tells us he is not only our Savior our Lord our elder brother are soon coming King but to a remnant of people that God is calling to the deeper truths of his word he has also revealed himself as our bridegroom if Jesus Yeshua is our bridegroom then what does that make us it makes us a part of his bride we can gain so much strength and so much truth by taking the time to lean on our beloved we do that by learning of him and we learn of him through his word let me invite you to the scripture today hebrews chapter 4 verse 11 and 12 well I've already read verse 12 probably more than once in these broadcasts that we've been doing in partnership with the gospel channel but I like it so much I think I'm going to read it again but to mix it up a little bit we'll start in verse 11 it says let us labor therefore to enter into at rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the Word of God again this is the written record of his word but when we approach it in the spirit it becomes the revelation of his Living Word and so the Living Word of God as introduced by the written word of God is quite a powerful tool you might even say a weapon in fact it can get into the inside of the inside of the inside of what makes us tick of who we really are in fact I know of nothing else that can get into that fine line of the inner man between the soul and the spirit that's a very important place for the Word of God to be effective because we want to know what is this leadership I'm making decisions but am I making decisions from his Spirit that now reigns in and over my human spirit or am i doing this with another dimension of Who I am my soul our soul is made up of our mind our capacity to think our intellect our will which God has given to us as a gift and our emotions and remember emotions are not our enemy we just have to be able to control our thoughts and our emotion and to bring them into subjection to the truth of God's Word about our lives as individuals so this word of God it's a powerful force when it is alive to us and in us then it can even become alive through us and that's where ministry comes in particularly the ministry of reconciliation the Apostle says here that the Word of God has two edges it's sharp on both edges of the blade I remember the old-timers and the Pentecostal church that I grew up in they would say about the Word of God it's two-edged they would say it cuts going in and it cuts coming out I want you to know that's not a bad thing it kind of sounds a little scary this word of God cutting on the way in and cutting on the way out but friend if you're where I am in my life then I know your desire is the same as mine and that is I desire that God showed me by his word the very thing in my life that is not like him so that it can be extracted the Word of God is sharper than a surgeon's scalpel he has the ability by the Holy Spirit to come right into the inside as we said a moment ago of the insight helping us to determine is this the Holy Spirit leading me am i making decisions by the spirit or am i making decisions by my soul by my own opinion by my own mind my own self-will and my own unrestrained emotions sometimes we can look to counselors to give us the answer we can seek the advice of friends but they can only do so much they can only give us their opinion perhaps it's an educated opinion but it's still just an opinion but there is something that can give us more than an opinion someone said well isn't God's Word God's opinion well yes I guess we could say on a base level that the opinion of God is revealed in his word but listen this is more than the opinion of God this is God on a written page how do we know that because the Bible tells us so this is the Avenue it is the vehicle that leads us to that relationship that we were talking about a moment ago with the Living Word let me read verse 11 to you again in the amplified version of the Bible it says let us therefore be zealous I want you to know zealous is to have zeal to have passion it's not to be passive our relationship with both the written record of God's Word and most importantly the Living Word the life of Jesus Christ inside of us it cannot be a passive relationship it has to be an active passionate life relationship it has to be something that we actively pursue and according to the Apostles speaking to the Hebrew believers we've got to be zealous let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves now that speaks about some physical determination it speaks about as King James translates it work labor and strive diligently to enter that rest the rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves this is so precious to me that my god your God desires to invite you to enter into a place of rest a place where we have full dependence on him and full confidence that whatever we commit into his hands he's not going to fumble and he's not going to lose he's going to hold on to it and he's going to work in it always for our good what God is doing in our in our life what you sense God doing in your life right now it may not always feel good especially the things that sometimes God allows and in themselves those things may not be good but the scripture promises they are given or allowed for our good there is a work going on in the bride of Jesus Christ the sons of God around the world right now that is unprecedented because of its of its scope its vast I believe God is making up his remnant bride in in all the nations of the earth and though we are not connected together by some denominational hierarchy or some great organization maybe even we're not connected by some amazing app we are connected by the same Holy Spirit and what I so love about my journeys around the world in over 65 countries I love the fact that what I have often found when I travel is the same truths that God is emphasizing in one place he's often emphasizing them in another place maybe not always in the mainstream church but somewhere in that place we find a group of people that God has been dealing with in a very similar way bless the Lord that's the work of God that's the work of the king of God and he is doing it sovereignly by his spirit in multiple places at one time only God could pull that off without some sort of structure to pull us all together to make sure we all believe the same thing I want you to know man has tried to organize God man has tried to organize the church we've gone way beyond the simple structure that's outlined in the scripture for the function of the church the Bible gives us some beautiful examples I spoke about one a moment ago the fivefold ministry that's a part of God's order for his New Testament church we read about deacons bishops leaders we read about church order and sometimes even a little bit of discipline if there's a member of the church community that is openly in sin and leading others astray there are simple guidelines in the New Testament for how the true Church of Jesus Christ should operate but have you ever considered how far man has gone way beyond the boundaries and perimeters of Scripture to try to improve I guess in some ways the church is like any other company it seems that they're always trying to come out with a new and improved version you know what I believe I believe that if we as the Church of Jesus Christ could just get back to the simplicity of the scripture and to the simple structure of the book of Acts oftentimes we have Matthew Mark Luke John the four Gospels followed by the book of Acts and oftentimes they call that book the Acts of the Apostles well I want you to know that the Apostles were great men of God but they would have been empty men they would have been helpless men without the power of the life of Jesus Christ that was now living inside of them because of what happened on the day of Pentecost and so therefore we could say that the book of Acts that follows the four Gospels is not indeed the Acts of the Apostles but rather the acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles and I believe if we could just bring the church back to how things were done then I mean not III want you to understand that I don't mean that we should ignore the tools that we have today or that we should ignore the fact that we're living 2,000 years after many things have been wonderfully updated for us we have streaming of our services or so that we can reach more than our local congregation we have YouTube by the way you can find new hope revival ministries on YouTube and you can go back and watch any of these programs that you've missed and a lot of other videos of songs and teaching and interviews and things that I know would be a blessing to you so look for us on youtube and also subscribe and know that wasn't a commercial because I'm not selling anything but I just felt comfortable to mention it to you thank God we have all these tools I've even seen God work through something as silly as social media Facebook Instagram Twitter God can use these things so I'm not saying that we should go back and and and forget all those modern things that it can be a blessing to the kingdom of God and just live exactly like it was in the book of Acts that's not what I mean but what I mean is we should uncomplicated really we should we get in fact I I was telling our congregation last night that I'm being bombarded with all of these emails because I'm on a an email list of pastors and so you know for for 1499 there they want to sell me the most wonderful sermon outlines for Easter that I've ever read before so that we can have the best Easter Sunday service at our church than we've ever had and it goes on and on and on one one email wanted to send a subscription wanted me to subscribe to learning how to get people to give their biggest offering on Easter Sunday and I want you to know that's way out of my league I'm so not interested in any of that furthermore Jesus is not about Easter Sunday the resurrection is not a day the resurrection is a person we should shift our focus from some of these things that are what I call trappings of Christianity they have nothing to do with the simplicity of God's Word we ought to go back to the simplicity of the scripture and the church structure is outlined in the Bible and my I believe we could see some things take place if instead of making more programs we actually uncomplicated things a bit and just prayed sought the face of God with fasting and sincerity and waited on the wind of God to blow through our little church community I tell you that would transform us in a whole maybe faster if not faster than I guarantee you in a more biblical way than some of the approaches of the church today I didn't mean to get off on that in fact sometimes we call those bunny trails but it is the truth we want to see God do in our lives what he was doing through the apostles and we ought to consider some of the truths outlined in the scripture that get overlooked for instance maybe we should go to acts 2:38 and find out the Apostolic for for baptism and if God honored it in acts 2:38 and honored it in that in the whole entirety of the book the book of Acts the acts of the Holy Spirit we saw God adding to the church daily we saw God filling people with the Holy Ghost not by the dozens by the thousands so maybe if we examined our foundation a little bit in the way we're doing things today uncomplicated distressed some things maybe we could see the power of God operating among us as we have read about in God's Word okay enough of that we'll move on what I wanted to share about this Hebrews 411 is this is this sense of being zealous exerting ourselves striving diligently to enter that place of rest he said here the rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves that no man may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience into which those in the wilderness fell and he goes on for the word of god speaks is alive for the word that god speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective this is the verse i bread to you several times it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life soul and the immortal spirit and of joints and marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart again the amplified bible tremendously amplifies makes very clear the the power of god's word but that verse 11 is what i want to talk about it presents to us a paradox because most of us know that rest in its general definition is to do nothing I mean that's what we think of when we think of rest and yet the Bible says again it's a paradox we should therefore labor work exert ourselves be zealous to enter into that rest again what a paradox let's work to rest if you want to get into rest you've got to work I know and you do too that if there's such a paradox presented for us in God's words there's a reason for it there's a truth that we need to grab ahold of really it is connected to what I was sharing a moment ago about simplifying the way we do things because the striving the labor the effort the exertion that the Apostle is talking about here is not just doing works for the sake of doing works it's not just being busy about the kingdom of God so that we can look busy or be busy wear ourselves out or as the expression goes burn our candle on both ends I want you to know their ministers pastors church workers across the world that are in exhaustion many are past what we have come to call the burnout in fact the suicide statistics for pastors is huge all across the world because the stress and the complication of getting it all done is wearing people out I believe there's a truth here for not only leaders I believe there's a truth here for every seeker of God for every person watching this program who desires to be in that place of close and intimate fellowship with Jesus Christ I believe there's a secret for us here this statement in Hebrews 4:11 it sounds contradictory at the very least it's a paradox and we can also see from this verse that whatever this labor is that we have to do it's spoken about here the rider is associating this labor with unbelief I don't know how you feel about unbelief but I believe that by definition unbelief is sin and all of the other things that we often categorize as sin are really the attributes of unbelief if we truly believed that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him then wouldn't we seek his face and so if we're not seeking after God and please understand we can only seek him when he is drawing us the scripture is clear but if we know that that's what we're supposed to do and we say we believe God's Word and we're not doing it isn't there a measure of unbelief it's the same way when we hear the church saying Jesus is coming soon Jesus is coming soon but I wonder how many people really believe we're living in the days of the coming of the Lord for if we truly believe that we're living in the days of the coming of the Lord wouldn't we also live a life that testified of our faith I think we would do things differently if we believe that the coming of the Lord was imminent so what keeps us from doing it it's that element of unbelief so I believe that the Apostle here is connecting the labor that we must do to enter interest with that huge element of unbelief and when we continue to read a lot of this begins to sort of unfold for us I believe the Apostle is saying we must labor so that we do not experience this unbelief we must labor so that we do not fall into unbelief as our fathers did and the fathers that are being spoken about here were the children of Israel in the wilderness there's a interesting version of the Bible the complete Jewish Bible by dr. David Stern and I like to look at it I like to read it I like to use it in study and he translates a portion of verse 11 this way so that no one will fall short because of the same kind of disobedience God is inspiring the Apostle to write this letter to the Hebrew believers reminding them of their forefathers in the wilderness who were not able to enter into the rest now in their father's case the rest was the promised land it was Canaan and the problem with Canaan was there were inhabitants in the land and there was going to be a whole process involved in displacing the inhabitants of the land so that indeed the children of Israel could take full possession of what God was giving to them now remember there was no stealing going on here they were given that land by Almighty God the Creator but the thing is he didn't just hand it over to them in a basket and say here it is it's easy it's yours in fact there was labor involved and the Bible is telling us here in Hebrews and we'll read it in just a moment that many of our fathers were not able to enter into the Promised Land the place of rest and it all boiled down to one thing unbelief so Paul is right if indeed Paul is the author of this book and I believe he is then he is writing to the Hebrew believers we must not make the same mistake as dr. David Stern says in the complete Jewish Bible here so that no one will fall short because of the same kind of disobedience did you know that unbelief is disobedience when we fail to take God at His Word we're walking in unbelief and therefore this unbelief manifests itself in our lives as disobedience we cannot obey a word that we do not fully believe it's nearly impossible and then I also want you to notice as we study this that entrance is emphasized in this verse of scripture the way we get in the entrance to a home is usually by the door if you lock yourself out sometimes it's by the window but there are ways to get in and hopefully there are ways to get out especially in in an emergency situation and you know that in a commercial building or public building we have to make sure that the entrances are never blocked that there is an easy way to come in and an even easier way to get out in case of an emergency in fact in our church here in Alabama we have one door that is just not my favorite door I don't like the way it has to swing but the fire marshal has determined that it has to swing a certain way because it is adjacent to an to a door that leads outside of the building it's so close this door out of the sanctuary into the back hall is so close to an exit that it has to swing away from the exit door so that people can can easily get right out through the door that goes outside and when I'm trying to go back down the hall that door swings the wrong way and literally you have to step out of the way of the door to be able to go down the hall but I understand the principle and the importance of being able to get out so here in verse eleven we not only hear unbelief emphasized as being one of the reasons why they couldn't go in but we hear the entrance the way to get in being emphasized and the Apostle is clear he says the way to get in is to labor now I'm going to have to study to figure out what this labor is about what kind of work is involved that will get me over there to rest because I'm tired we might say I'm looking for the promised land and in this situation we're not talking about heaven the end of our life or thank God we have a promised land thank God we have a Canaan land promised thank God we have an eternity and an eternal home that is prepared for us by our Father who loves us so much but I believe that the Scriptures also talking about a place of trust a place of dependency a place of spiritual rest I don't know about you but I need that I need that greater place of dependency on him it's easy sometime to develop a little confidence in your ability to get it done and you know the Lord will test us in that sometime he'll allow us to walk through some situations where we begin to doubt greatly our ability to get it done and that's not because God wants to strip us down it's because he wants to bring us into a closer relationship and a greater dependency on him he must be our source his life is my source for living I'm not just existing by the natural breath that comes in and out of my lungs but as a believer filled with the Holy Ghost his life becomes my source for living and so the Apostle is trying to instruct us by using the past as an example and using something that we're all familiar with labor work to find a place of entrance into a spiritual rest now one day that spiritual rest will take us to a place of eternal rest I certainly believe that with all my heart in the time that we have left today I want us to just quickly look at what I believe is a further explanation and understanding of the verses that we just read in Hebrews 4 and in order to do that we'll go back a chapter let's look at Hebrews chapter 3 and the next time we're together we'll go a little bit further into this study but in Hebrews chapter 3 verses 8 through 14 and I encourage you to read in your own time all of Hebrews chapter 3 and all of Hebrews chapter 4 because a parallel is being drawn between the journeying of the children of Israel into the Promised Land through the wilderness and also to the life of a spirit-filled New Testament believer a parallel is being drawn in the entirety of those two chapters verse 8 harden not your heart your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness again the Apostle King us back to our fathers journeying in the wilderness verse nine when your father's tempted to me proved me and saw my works 40 years let's not forget that the children of Israel were supernaturally fed and supernaturally led for 40 long years and yet they tempted God in the wilderness with their unbelief in fact the complete Jewish Bible that we mentioned a moment ago instead of using the word in the day of provocation it talks about the bitter quarrel it says that your father's tempted me in the bitter quarrel verse 10 wherefore I was grieved with that generation this is not something we want to hear that God would be grieved with us we want to bring him joy we want to bless him bless his name bless his kingdom with our with our lives by serving him and loving him worshiping him we don't want to be guilty of grieving the Lord but that generation they grieved the Lord and they where for I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and have not known my ways you see the Apostle is speaking in the way that God was speaking to the children of Israel he saw beyond their behavior he saw beyond their actions God was seeing their heart that's another thing that the Word of God has power and anointing to do is to discern the intent the motive of what we call our heart not the blood pump but that internal part of who we are and God was looking at their heart and he said they have not known my ways even though the instruction the Torah the law of God was given to them God said they didn't know my ways they may have been able to recite some of my laws they may have even been able to obey some of my loss but they have not known my ways verse 11 so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest I'm telling you this is serious business God just said because you didn't know my ways I'm not going to allow you to enter into this rest your mind you're my children you're my chosen I have fed you I have led you I provided manna when you needed bread I provided quail when you needed me I opened up the way through the Red Sea I turned the bitter water sweet I sent the pillar of fire to lead you and to also keep you warm in the night and I sent the pillar of cloud to lead you and to keep you in shade in the daytime protecting you from the desert heat but I'm not gonna let you enter into my rest even though you're mine even though I've done all those things for you I'm not going to let you enter into my rest verse 12 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God so here Paul is saying we've got to look at the example of our forefathers and whatever we do children we must not follow their example in this manner verse 13 he said but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made here's the verse I've used with you before for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end so we're blessed of God to have this example of how you can be the chosen of God and God working for you providing for you leading you and yet he said to our fathers in the wilderness but you can't go into the promised land what happened they had to die in the wilderness and another generation arose after them that were willing and able to take God at His Word they found the key they found that place that was necessary for entrance into the rest that had been promised to them and this is what we're going to look at when we're together again we're going to look at what can we do as individuals to find entrance to labor to go in to that promised place of rest I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate your attention today and that you would take your time to study God's Word with me I love this word and I believe the more we love the word the more we will love the Living Word Jesus Christ and the more we will experience his love through his word if you've ever doubted God's love for you dig a little deeper in the storehouse of God's Word and you will discover the great love wherewith our Father has loved us lord I ask you right now in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah that you would take this moment Lord to move in the life of those watching this program right now you are our healer you are our provider and we look to you as our
