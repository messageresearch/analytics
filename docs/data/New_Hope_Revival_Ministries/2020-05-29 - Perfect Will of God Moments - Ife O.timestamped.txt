[0:00] even though we have a pre-planned design
[0:03] there are times that we're right on the
[0:05] mark there are times that we are not
[0:07] right on the
[0:15] i mark you to know many of us have
[0:17] individual promises that have been given
[0:19] to us
[0:20] that are because of our destiny
[0:23] because of the call that is on our life
[0:26] we have promises that are directly
[0:28] connected
[0:29] to the destiny to the plan to the path
[0:32] that is set before us and so we're all
[0:35] working toward
[0:37] an ultimate promise but we're all
[0:40] moving toward spiritual promises
[0:43] that pertain to our lives even though we
[0:45] have a pre-planned design
[0:48] there are times that we're right on the
[0:50] mark there are times that we are not
[0:52] right on the mark there are no variables
[0:56] concerning our election now listen if
[0:58] our choices
[1:00] and levels of surrender can have
[1:03] significant
[1:04] impact on our growth and our
[1:07] fruitfulness
[1:08] in a particular season it is essential
[1:11] that we discover the perfect will of god
[1:14] in all things i want you to say in all
[1:18] things
[1:19] you can have his acceptable will which
[1:21] can be permissive
[1:23] and not have his perfect will but the
[1:26] writer tells us it's possible
[1:28] to have his good acceptable
[1:31] and perfect will how many of you want to
[1:34] live in that
[1:35] god help us to live in the good
[1:39] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:42] that word perfect here is is translated
[1:45] from a greek word that means having the
[1:48] highest standard
[1:50] how many of you believe that what god
[1:53] has written
[1:54] in that book is based on his original
[1:57] thoughts about you
[1:58] and that is the highest standard of his
[2:02] will substituting what god will allow
[2:06] instead of what he prefers can cause
[2:09] someone to think
[2:11] or to make it seem like they have fallen
[2:15] short of reaching the promise
[2:18] so it becomes easy to throw in the towel
[2:22] with an i blew it attitude if the enemy
[2:25] can make it look like i have failed
[2:27] again
[2:29] then i may end up making another bad
[2:32] spiritual
[2:33] decision and another and another and
[2:36] another
[2:36] and another and i've been doing all of
[2:38] that based on what
[2:40] seemed to be the case
[2:43] i want you to know that finding yourself
[2:46] in the permissive will of god
[2:48] does not mean
[2:51] that you have come short
[2:55] of reaching the promise
[2:58] [Music]
[3:00] the enemy will make it seem impossible
[3:04] for you to have the promise and
[3:06] spiritually
[3:08] we make some bad decisions in a series
[3:10] of bad decisions
[3:11] and then people start losing confidence
[3:14] and they start pulling away and going in
[3:15] all kinds of different directions
[3:17] and doing all kinds of things and it's
[3:18] all based on a perception that is not
[3:20] the truth
[3:21] it's not what the word said it's a lie
[3:24] so i realize that if the enemy
[3:26] can cause you to feel that you have come
[3:29] so
[3:30] short of the promise that you can hardly
[3:33] get your eye
[3:34] on the end he doesn't have to do
[3:36] anything else to you
[3:37] the little bride of jesus christ she may
[3:40] have wondered she may have gone around
[3:42] the mountain a time or two
[3:43] she may have allowed her decision to
[3:45] force her into the permissive will of
[3:47] god
[3:48] but i want you to know it can end
[3:53] living in the permissive will can end
[3:55] another trip around the mountain can
[3:57] end you can choose to come to kadesh
[4:01] barnea
[4:01] today let the word
[4:05] set it straight in your life let the
[4:08] word
[4:09] correct the imbalance in your life let
[4:11] the word correct the timing in your life
[4:14] i don't care what it seems like but
[4:16] don't you
[4:17] ever think that you have
[4:21] changed your election
[4:24] or your predestination
[4:27] or your justification
[4:31] if god has settled it it is
[4:34] set out it may seem
[4:38] you have fallen short but you don't have
[4:41] to fall short
[4:43] because you have believed
