TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and remind you of what a great joy it is for us to be able to come to you week after week on this great gospel network and declare to you the Word of God sometimes we're teaching a little bit and other times we get a little excited and do a little preaching but I pray that something has been said that has encouraged you along the way and perhaps that's why you've tuned in again today if you have been watching the program and it has been a blessing to you why don't you consider sending us an email or making contact with our ministry here in Alabama in the United States of America and let us know that you have been blessed and that becomes a great encouragement to us to know that our labor in the Lord is not in vain and that something is being accomplished to help further the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah I appreciate the contact that we've had with many of you in the nations of the world and you have let us know that you have learned a lot from the program and it's always interesting for me to read the different principles the different things that minister to different people and in all the different places all across Europe and Scandinavia the Middle East and and through portions of Asia and wherever you're watching by the World Wide Web you may be watching this anywhere in the world or by podcasts it's just a great joy to know that there are so many of you out there that are hungry for more of the Word of God and that's why this particular series has been so special for me as we have been teaching now for quite a while on the process of spiritual adoption and we're gonna look at some more of that today and I trust that you'll be blessed and we'd like to pray with you about your prayer requests if you'll send them in then I promise to be faithful to help lift those needs up before the Lord and we'll just believe that God will answer prayer and that he'll give the increase and provide the miracle and then you'll want to send another email to let us know what the Lord has done amen so let's look to the Word of God today we were talking the last time we were together about three very important milestones I guess we could call them in the life of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ and how these three milestones speak of the process of growing of coming to maturity we believe that the universal call to the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is to to come up higher as John heard it in Revelation chapter 4 there is an open door there is an opportunity available there is an invitation that is being made in this hour for you and I to come to a place of greater stability a place of deeper intimacy and relationship and eventually come to a place of full adoption all of creation is groaning the scripture says for the manifestation the apocalypsis the unveiling of the sons of God the mature sons of God not the infants not those who are in adolescence or puberty only but those who have come all the way up to that Greek word Hill's thesis it talks about the placing of a mature son and I believe that this is the time for that I believe this is the spiritual season where many are going to begin to supersede where they have been in Christ and come into a deeper more fulfilling relationship with him we've talked about in this series already the inadequacy of religion religion is not adequate it's not enough to keep us pushing into Christ we need more than that we need relationship and we're even calling for the body of Christ to become more relational where we're believing that God wants to bring unity between brothers and sisters in Christ and we need to we're not talking about compromising with the Word of God the Word of God is right and it is yay and a man but we're talking about how so many times we have allowed the littlest of things to divide us to isolate us to keep us from growing together and I'm persuaded that we can learn from each other what God has deposited in your life may be exactly what somebody else is needing in this season and vice versa and so it is a body ministry and we need one another as we grow in the Grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ we know that this Christian journey is it has a beginning and then there is a process there is a a journey and then there is a time of celebration when when it is when it has to become evident when we have the evidence that we can prove who we are in Christ because we have stepped into a place of authority whereby we are able to work the works of God and I believe that that's where we're headed and I pray that you will dig in and that you will spend time before the Lord as he broods over you by the Holy Spirit changing you quickening you drawing you to himself so we talked about in the life of Jesus when he was 8 years old he was excuse me when he was 8 days old he was circumcised and then a few days after his mother had finished her time of purification the Bible said he was taken to the temple in jerusalem where Simeon and Anna I believe Simeon was prophetic and and of course the scripture says that Anna was a prophetess and these were some of those who had been looking for the salvation of Israel and then we talked about a time when Yeshua the Lord Jesus was 12 years old at Pesach time Passover his parents brought in back to the temple as they came every year but we find him now in the temple at 12 years old and they they think that he's with them when they leave Jerusalem to go back to Nazareth but he has stayed behind and it's actually three days before they see him again he has been been spending his time in the temple both asking questions and teaching with the supernatural wisdom of God the scholars the rabbi's those who are learning and who were learning in the law and when he is questioned about his behavior why did you upset us this way and and stay behind and we didn't know it his response was don't you understand that I must be about my father's business and when we read that it reminds us that in that second temple period culture at the age of 12 years old a young man was accepted into the business of the family he became what we would call an apprentice and his father and others would take special time to train him and equip him so that eventually he would be able to take over the family business as we went off the air last week we talked about the fact that he would be even granted some authority in business his father would celebrate the fact that he was 12 years old and would speak to the merchants in the in the town and would let them know they're going to be times that my son will come to pick up supplies or to drop things off and I want you to treat him with the same respect that you would treat me with so it's it's just an interesting thing however at 12 years old that young man certainly didn't have the necessary maturity level to to conduct all of the business to make to make huge decisions no he would have to continue to grow up at the age of approximately thirty there would be another very important ceremony that would be a public declaration of his level of maturity that we'll talk about later in the Jewish faith a teenager is celebrated when they come to this place of maturity and accountability in either a bar mitzvah or a bat mitzvah depending on whether or not it's for a young man or for a young lady and so we can really say that Yeshua had what would be similar to a bar mitzvah a an experience of coming to this place where he was an apprentice of his father not Joseph only his earthly father the carpenter but he was in the temple conducting the business of his Heavenly Father I really love that I love reading it and being reminded of some of these interesting things in the life of the Messiah now that word that we've talked about and I I pronounced a little differently some time trying to get it off of my tongue but but it it comes from the word helos and and adding to that the word thesis and it means the placing of a mature son and this is referring to a time as we said a moment ago when around the age of 30 at this time the father of the young man would take him into a public forum usually at the gate of the city and he would lay his hand on the head of his son and openly proclaim this is my beloved son this is the son that I love and I am pleased with him and then he would go on to say one historian tells us he would go on to say I bestow upon him now all of my riches and power and authority and this was like what we would call the power of attorney a transfer of authority so that he might act on my behalf in all of my affairs now that certainly didn't happen at eight days old and that certainly didn't happen at 12 years old but approximately at the age of thirty what would be considered scripturally full adoption the the the season of placing the mature son in the position in which he was born four and that's what we're after in the body of Christ we understand that we have been spiritually circumcised the scripture speaks about the circumcision of the heart the cutting away of the old flesh the beginning of the process of new birth we have been sanctified by and cleansed by the washing of the water of the word we have received the baptism of the holy spirit I hope with the the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit and and the evidence is that God is he is in us he testifies of those things by his Spirit but we're still learning and we're still growing and we know more as adults we understand more as adults than we did as teenagers and when we were teenagers we understood more than we did when we were toddlers and this is in the natural process of Aging but this is also in the spiritual process we grow in grace the Apostle said from faith to faith from strength to strength from glory to glory from from one place to the next place in Christ from one level of understanding to the next level of understanding even our wisdom increases specifically with age but but wisdom is a spiritual gift and you can be old and not wise and so it's not just wisdom that comes with years of experience but as men and women of God we want to have the supernatural manifestation of wisdom he is wisdom Jesus Yeshua is wisdom to have him means that we have a part of his wisdom and we want to yield to that and this word knowledge that we talk about we want more knowledge not a head knowledge but a heart knowledge a revelation of truth the knowledge of truth can sustain us only so far it can keep us for only so long but a revelation of truth is something that will sustain us and give us an anchor in all kinds of stormy weather we want that truth to drop from our head to our heart and I've been following the Lord a long time but I'm asking God every day for revelation knowledge for for revelation of his word and you've heard me say before you can read the Bible but it's not how much of God's Word you go through it's how much of God's Word goes through you how much of God's Word are you able to spiritually digest why is that important because it's only what we have understanding of that we are able to apply and to appropriate if you have no understanding of a particular spiritual truth then you cannot you cannot apply that truth in your personal life you can't appropriate or put in action that truth and neither can you impart it to others and that's part of what our calling is as mature sons of God we're coming to that place we're not boasting that we're there we're not saying already we've come to the full measure of adoption but we're saying we're going to keep pressing on we're going to like we say in the south of the United States we're going to keep on keeping on great man of God a prophet from the last generation William Branham said you have gone as far with God as you're ever gonna go until we're willing to pay a greater price and he said we need to keep our eyes on Calvary and keep pressing toward Jesus Christ and that's what we must do in this hour we must keep pressing in to Christ until we come to that place that the Apostle Paul was travailing in prayer in birthing prayer prayer that Christ be formed in us that's what we want the fullness of Christ to be formed in us to come to that place where we can be trusted of our Father with all of the riches of heaven the very divine nature of God all of the blessings and provision that heaven holds we want to be able to to appropriate that in the earth the power of the spoken word has been given to the body of Christ we want to know how to use that with wisdom we want we want God our Father to be able to trust us so that we can use that not for personal gain not for public show but everything we do we want to do it to further the kingdom of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ in the earth when we have been talking about adoption we started this series many weeks ago by reading the the five places in the New Testament where the word adoption is used and that's the word that means the placing of mature sons Romans 8:15 Romans 8:23 Romans nine three through five and maybe I'll read that I don't believe I read Romans nine maybe three through five four I would wish that myself were a curse from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever a man that was the only reference I think where the word adoption appears in the New Testament that we read this time it appears to be specifically speaking to to the Jewish people to the Israelites to the kinsmen of the Apostle Paul I like that because he is explaining to the Jewish people even though you are the people of God the Covenant people of God you also need spiritual adoption as Yeshua remember we've been teaching on that though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered though the Jewish people are the elect and chosen of the Lord they must also come to this place of spiritual adoption as well as the Gentiles and the Apostle was teaching that in Galatians 4 5 which we've read already to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons or the placing of the mature sons of God and so let me just do a little bit of a review we talked about the different words the the Technion and the TEC known which is a child which was growing up but which is still under parental care which was like the the puberty level hence john 1 and verse 12 he says to them gave he the power to become as many as received him remember it says to as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God that is techn own that is adolescent to as many as received him to them gave he the power to become as adolescents as teenagers in Christ those who would have celebrated their Bar Mitzvah their their announcement of limited Authority and so we don't want to stop there you know we could say okay he's given us power to be teenager so that's that's the best the kingdom has know we're going to continue to learn from life experience and from spiritual experience we're going to continue to learn how to grow up in Christ and I like oftentimes the Apostle Paul said things like this little children I would love to teach you I would love to give you the strong meat I'd love to give you something to cut your eye teeth on but you still want the milk I'm unable to give you I'm unable to share with you the things that I would like to share with you because you're so easily offended because you're so steeped in your religious doctrines and practices that you're not open to a now word a Rhema word of the Lord and I want to speak to the body of Christ as the Apostle Paul spoke to his kindred and to those believers in his time we don't want to be so rigid and so steeped in man's tradition and in church anity that we miss what God wants to reveal to us from his word by his Spirit in this hour we want to go from truth to truth as well from level to level I remember one of the prophets of the Old Testament was talking about being poured from one vessel to another and I used to do a teaching on the process of winemaking in in the Bible days in the time of the Bible and how that in in making the wine it was it would stay for so long in one type our design of vessel until that vessel had accomplished all that it could accomplish for the for the product for the wine of the juice initially and then it would be poured into another vessel and another vessel eventually it would be poured into a vessel that it could be sealed in and when it was sealed in that's when the pressure would build up and that's when the great process of fermentation would be released and that's when we get real wine we get a breaking down of the sugars and we get a real lovely taste of wine or we would have if if people use that process today I'm sure it's a lot more modernized now than it was in the time of the but we're like that juice first we have to be crushed the grapes are crushed underfoot we have to be crushed and like Gethsemane means the Olive Press the place of the pressing dude to release the oil and and Yeshua in Gethsemane was in the press and he was being pressed and you and I also have to go through that and then there's a step where we are where the little pieces of the grape skin and so forth are are strained off and drained off and the least the Bible calls it in King James the Lee's are left behind the dregs are left behind and only the pure liquid is poured into the next vessel so what we're seeing is that everything we go through every trial every Valley every low place and every high place every victory every what seems like sometime defeat is a part of our maturing process now you may not yet be to the place today that you can look back and say it was worth it all it was worth it all every heartache every tear every trial every moment of deep rejection but I'm telling you you will as a believer in Christ come to a place and I don't think it will necessarily have to be when you stand in the kingdom when you come to heaven that you're going to express that I believe that there will be a place of maturity on this side on this side of the of the great curtain of the great veil that you will be able to say it was worth it all and I don't want to say this boasting or bragging because I know I have more trials to go through more tests more hardship perhaps more persecution to go through to come to the place that the father can trust me with all things I recognize that but I can tell you that I've come through enough and I've seen the benefit of the hardship in my life that I could sing today I could testify to you today you has thus far from from this day backward I could say it has been worth it all it has been worth it all and I'm able to recognize by revelation that every low point of my life I had some unusual circumstances growing up God was with me he visited me at an early age but my parents divorced when I was five years old and I saw a lot of heartache and and I had rejection and I dealt with a lot of different things growing up and coming along but every bit of that was for my good so that I could come to a place that I would be able to reflect the pure love of Jesus Christ I want to be there I want to come to that place where I can speak and it is not me but it is the Word of God flowing out of my life I want to be able to lay hands on the sick and not maybe so and hoping that they'll recover but I want to see again what God has promised the miraculous power of God delivering and setting captives free I want to see those hard cases bound by sin and alcohol and drugs and illicit sexuality and all kinds of seeds of wickedness I want to see people ultimately set free from the gutter most to the uttermost like the apostles I want to see that and I believe that we're about to enter into a season where we're going to see the hand of God moving among us like we have never seen it before and that's why we want to hurry up and and come to that place of maturity we can't speed it up necessarily but I do believe the faster we learn the lesson that God is trying to teach us right now the quicker we can get to the next one well how do we control that I believe we control it by yielding yielding to the pressure if you were the clay in the Potters hand today and you are spiritually speaking a schewe the Lord Jesus is our potter and he's applying the pressure and shaping and molding us into his image and then we're going into the fire then we're going into the care and we're going to be cured we're going to be hardened and then we're going to be a vessel of Honor for the master and one of these days if not already we're going to be able to say it's worth it all so keep pressing into Christ don't allow your circumstances to make you better but allow God to use them to make you better father I ask you right now to release your grace for whoever is needing extra grace in this season because of the pressure of their life release extra grace and help us to learn this lesson quickly so that we can move on to the next one and find that place of maturity in you in the wonderful name of Jesus Yeshua we pray amen thank you for watching the Eagles cry I hope you've heard something that will interest you enough that you'll tune in again next week god bless you bye bye for now [Music] you [Music]
