TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but there is an alloted portion of word for every age now we know that there was an allotted portion of the word for the last age we're sure of that and for what God did a generation ago there was certainly a portion of word laid aside for that age that was the closing Twilight hours of leod deia and now we are beginning to stretch ourselves out of the church ages toward the Millennium can you say Amen we we know we know we're still encumbered by church anity we know that we are still weed down by the lukewarmness of leod deia but there is something that happens to the believer when he or she begins to Feast on the word there is a a stimulation that Revelation brings that causes him or her to take a bite out of the age to come and and what a privilege it is to live over here still in Satan's Eden so to speak and be able to reach Beyond the Veil into Millennial Authority and take a bite oh hallelujah it's like the grapes that were brought back on the poles out of the land of promise Those Grapes of eshcol they were able to get get a sampling of what it was about to be like when they took the promised land and so the richness of this word of the hour the richness of what God does Even in our age in our generation in our time is he takes that which is yet to come to full reality he brings it back toward us we reach toward it we're not exactly pulling it in to time but we are we are reaching toward it we're meeting somewhere and it causes a stimulation that that brother brandom said it's none other than the Fulfillment of the scripture we are made to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we never physically have to leave the house we never physically have to leave this realm but spiritually we're lifted up into the word and it feeds us us and it strengthens us and it sustains us it quickens us so there was a great portion of the word that was laid aside for the last Church age but even in the lap over even in the stretching period God will emphasize for us today certain aspects of the word that was laid up for the last age it's all the word it's it's all right it's all good it's all helpful beneficial all true but he'll come by the anointing that's why we need an encounter with the anointing we need the the original logos among us we need that inspiration that will take a portion of that word laid up for every age bring it right into us right into us even this morning if you've got a heart to believe if you've got faith to receive it he'll bring the word right here to you today he'll update that word in your heart it'll no longer just be something you've heard it will become a part of you it'll digest in your inner being and you'll not walk out of here knowing a revelation you'll walk out of here being a revelation a revelation is not just a knowledge that we gain a revelation is a trans in who we are a revelation will transform us from the struggles of Leo deia from the battles of the pest house from the Mind Battle of Satan into a kingdom that says I know what the word said and the word is talking about me when you and I can get to a place where we realize that when we read the book we're reading in our story we're reading what is sent to us it's for us and when we eat that word that word becomes a part of who we are and then we begin to be like even like Christ in the sense in the sense that the word was fleshing out the word was becoming flesh
