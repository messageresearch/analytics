TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] you [Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry welcome to the program today we are still involved in a long study on the spiritual process of adoption or perhaps it would be better to call it the process of spiritual adoption that but the adoption is spiritual and so is the process and I've had a wonderful time examining the scriptures with you and teaching you some of the truth that God has made real to me we want to thank you for contacting our ministry by email or however is convenient for you many of you have let us know that the program is a blessing and that you're learning and that God is using the the scriptures and the teaching to speak to your heart to cause you to develop in your walk and that is a real blessing that's why we're here that's why we come and you'll notice that we're not coming asking for finances where we're not asking anything of you except that you would just be willing to open up your heart let the Lord speak to you and also search the Scriptures to see if these things be true and pray for the network's pray for the Christian networks that you are viewing this program on that God will bless them and supply their need according to his riches in glory and if you are a praying person and you would help to pray for our ministry and for the Eagles cry that God would supply our need and help us to continue to come then that would be a great blessing as well most importantly we'd like to pray with you about your prayer request so if you'd send them to us we would be happy to join our faith with your faith and believe God for a miracle let's get right back into the study and see what the Lord has for us this week okay we are talking about the last time we were together we were mentioning that there are three Greek words that are translated in english in the New Testament as sons one was speech more or less about infancy now I failed to mention that there's also a Greek word called breath O's that is used to refer to a babe a baby so really we could say there are four stages but we've chosen the three most important and that is infancy then adolescence or puberty and then maturity or adulthood but for instance we read about the babe leaping in the womb of Elizabeth when Mary the mother of our Lord came and gave salutation the Bible said the babe left in the womb and that word is breakfast and it it simply means a baby it can also mean a fetus it can also mean a baby that is not yet born so sometimes you'll see that word also translated in the New Testament but more more often it's the three the one that refers to infancy the one that refers to to puberty or the teenage years and the one that refers to adulthood now when we look at these words we see that there is a pattern that's revealed in the scripture from the life of the Lord Jesus Yeshua the Messiah and we can see his maturity don't forget Hebrews 5 8 through 10 though he were a son yet learn to obedience by the things which he suffered and you can go on and read about him being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all of them who obey Him look at that very carefully because it's very important for us to note that as it was in the Hebrew culture the three stages of development we can see that indicated in the life of the Lord Jesus through the scripture let's look at that for just a moment what is the first what is the first major milestone in the life of a Jewish person in in biblical times it would have been circumcision that took place on the eighth day now we often in the Christian Church we have something that we call a baby dedication where the baby is brought and in the Protestant church we don't baptize or sprinkle the baby but we pray for the baby and we pray for the parents and the grandparents and the supporting family members that God will help them to help the child as he grows and develops but remember that it was a commandment of God that the male children be circumcised the foreskin of of the male member was to be cut off and that was to be an external mark it was to be an outward mark of the Covenant that this son this child was marked by the Covenant or a son of the commandment and somebody said well did that happen in the life of Yeshua it absolutely did in Luke chapter 2 beginning in verse 21 and I'd like to take time if you don't mind to read that because perhaps some of you have never read it before remember that the Eagles cry is going to many nations of the world where some people may not be as familiar with with things that we often just assume that everyone has read or encountered themselves individually Luke 2 and verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus or we say in Hebrew Yeshua now it's very clear and I know people who don't realize I've had people say that they didn't realize that Yeshua was circumcised on the eighth day as the commandment was given in the scripture and we have it right here in the Book of Luke and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called Yahshua which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification this was the the appointed days of cleansing and purification for a woman who had given birth who had just given birth there was a time period that was set aside for her purification and so that everything was was all right when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord so as soon as that period of time pass they made the journey from Nazareth all the way to Jerusalem and as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons which we understand from Second Temple period study that this was the poor version of the offering and it was all that Miriam our Mary and Joseph Joseph had to bring verse 25 and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel waiting for the promised Redemption that would be brought in the coming of moshiach the one who was ordained of God prophesied by the prophets to bring Redemption and salvation and the Holy Ghost was upon him upon Simeon and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Messiah the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple led by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took key him up in his arms and blessed God and said he didn't bless the baby he blessed God and said Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation I love Simeon I love what God did for Simeon he he gave him a promise that he was going to see the mushy och he was going to see the coming of the Lord salvation and he waited patiently and one day the Spirit of the Lord led Simeon to the temple and there he found in the court he found Yosef and Miriam he found them with this little baby he held the baby in his arms and immediately the Holy Spirit of God that was in Simeon bore witness with the spirit of god that was even in that little child Yeshua and he recognized this is the promise this is the coming how many thousands of people over the years in the life in the lifetime of Jesus and in the in the two thousand years that have followed have come in contact with him in one way or another but were not able to recognize who he was and yet simeon by the Holy Spirit knew that salvation had come to the household of Israel and he was holding it in his arms I love that I love what God was doing this witness in this testimony for Simeon mine eyes in verse 30 have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel do you hear do you hear that even Simeon recognized that Yeshua was both Messiah and glory to the chosen house of Israel but he was also come as a light to the Gentiles I love the revelation that this old man had and Joseph and his mother verse 33 marveled at those things which were spoken of he now Joseph and Mary had had an angelic visitation to announce the significance of this child the details of his conception and even what his name should be and yet when they encountered Simeon they were amazed at the declarations that came out of his mouth concerning the little child that they had carried in their arms up to the Temple in Jerusalem verse 34 and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary Miriam his mother behold this child is set for the fall and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yay verse 35 listen carefully yay a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed this was a prophecy concerning the end of his life this was a prophecy concerning the heartache that Miriam would experience as her own son that she loved so much and that such profound words of promise had been spoken over his little life this was a prophecy from Simeon from the Holy Spirit through Simeon to mother and daddy to say there's going to be suffering there's going to be heartache many will reject him many will not receive him many will despise him and so this was both a glorious day and also a sad day verse 36 continues with another very special character a very special lady and there was one Anna who was a prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher she was of a great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about four score and four years now you think about that 84 years which departed not from the temple but served God with fastings and prayers night and day this must have been a precious woman Anna dedicated to God who had been a widow most of her life but had not remarried but at chosen rather to serve God with fasting and prayers in the temple and she coming in I don't believe it was accident all the hundreds of people that were bringing their babies up to Jerusalem all of the activity that was going on in and around the temple courtyard I believe that it was a divine appointment that had Anna there that day and at the right place at the right time to meet Mary and Joseph and perhaps she saw what was going on when Simeon had the baby in his arms and she coming in that instant gay thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him this was one of the first major milestones in this growth this development of the ministry that had been given to the Lord Jesus Christ he was just a little baby at this point but after being circumcised and and his mother passing the days of her purification now she has brought him to Jerusalem to offer him to the Lord and to fulfill what the law had required of the male the firstborn male child and encountered encountered that day was a Simeon and Anna and this was like an announcement I'm telling you Simeon didn't whisper and Anna wasn't whispering this was an announced to those who would listen that God has kept his word that he has been faithful to do exactly what it is that he said he would do then in in the Hebrew culture there was a second milestone on the way to full manhood our full maturity and that is what we would call a Bar Mitzvah which means an accountable son a son accountable or a son of the Commandant the Mitzvah which jesus also publicly celebrated in the temple at the age of 12 years old now this marks a time when a son was able to become an apprentice for his father in the family business now we know from the scripture that Yosef was a carpenter so at about the age of 12 a son was able to step up into a position of being an apprentice to learn the trade of his father this is why Jesus gave the declaration that he gave in Luke chapter 2 and and I'm going to read it I think I have time to read it to you Luke two verses 41 through 52 continuing on from where we were now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of pesach or Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child Yeshua Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not it they didn't recognize that he had stayed behind somebody said now how could this happen with a 12 year old child well look at the next verse but they supposing him to have been in the company meaning in the crowd of relatives that were all making their way the pilgrims who had made their way up to Jerusalem for for the for the feast of Pesach or the feast of unleavened bread pass over time now they're making their way back and they would they would go the children would go from from little group to group and among cousins and relatives and so forth and they just assume that he was somewhere in the line coming along with the crowd but when they recognized that he wasn't there after they had gone a whole day's journey they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances but verse 44 verse 45 and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him what's happened to him they must have been concerned about him at this point and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple can you imagine three days he was missing they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions now these were not medical doctors these were the learning of the law these were were the officials are the chief rabbis and here was this 12 year old boy sitting there talking to them and asking them questions and he must have not just been asking questions there must have been something else to it because verse 47 said and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers so he wasn't just asking he was also giving profound answers to the questions of the rabbis and verse 48 and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto Him son why has thou dust dealt with us behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing I'd say that's to put it mildly wouldn't you she probably scolded him quite proper what are you doing you supposed to be with us and you've been missing and we were worried sick about you verse 49 listen and his response this speaks to us of the Hebrew custom of a child who had reach the age of 12 becoming an apprentice this speaks of that and he said unto them how is it that she sought me whiskey not that I must be about my father's business now he's 12 years old he's reached this age whereby he can be trained now as an apprentice for his father now I don't think he was there in the temple that those three days learning how to be a carpenter like Joseph do you know he wasn't talking about his earthly father he was talking about his Heavenly Father how is it that you sought me so whisked you not don't you wish don't you know don't you understand that I must be busy doing the business of my father and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he whipped down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart she knew there was something unusual going on with this boy and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God in man after these first two milestones in his life we read that he increased with wisdom and in favour and in stature also physical form and in favor with God and man we could say that this would have been very similar to what Jewish young people celebrate today about the same time called a Bar Mitzvah for a son or a bat mitzvah for a daughter a time of reaching an age of accountability circumcision says that a son is marked as a son of the Covenant a son of the commandment but here we have Bar Mitzvah or in this in this regard it was the age that a before there was a really a Bar Mitzvah this was Jesus coming at twelve which was the known age for a son to take on the apprenticeship of the profession of his father and I believe Jesus learned carpentry from joseph i do but i don't believe that's what this is talking about he was teaching from the wisdom of god he was doing the business of his father he was practicing the purpose for which he was born and I love that I love those developments we've got the infancy eight days old and a little bit beyond now we've got 12 years old he's in the temple baffling the teachers finally there is the third step or milestone that we call Hafeez heeya and that is the combination of the two Greek words Huell fisa which was celebrated around the age of 30 and it marks the accepted age of maturity in Second Temple period time this occurred in the life of Jesus at the beginning of his ministry when he was baptized by John as we read that was the beginning of this Hugh officia process I believe that it consummated it began at his baptism in the Jordan River but i believe the consummation of and what does that word mean again if you combine Hughes and thesis what does that word mean it means the placing of a watt maturer son no longer just a little baby being circumcised or presented at the temple no longer a 12 year old boy baffling the minds of the teachers while he comes to worship God at Passover or Pesach but now there is an announcement that has been made in the Jordan River as we read in both this program and the last this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell that was the beginning of this Hugh officia and you know the pronunciation is a little bit difficult but it's not important whether or not you and I can pronounce the Greek exactly like it it should be it is important that we get the message that we get the concept that Jesus now has come to that place that we read about in Hebrews chapter 5 he's learning obedience by the things that he has suffered that word that we've talked about means son placement the placing of a son not just any age of a son but amateur son and that indicates a time when a male child reached what was considered to be the age of full maturity there was quite a celebration at 12 and it was also a public celebration and the neighbors were told the Sun is old enough now he's going to learn the trade of his father he's going to be doing some business on my behalf we after doing a lot of research we find out that among the merchants they were told my son is 12 but he's an apprentice he's can come and pick up some supplies he can do some things but of course a twelve-year-old is not as mature as someone would hopefully be at the age of 30 so he had some level of maturity and some level of authority at 12 but he didn't come to that full measure where we often say it would be like his name on the check would be the same as his father's name now they didn't write checks in those days but you understand at 30 he would if he had proven himself remember we talked about the scripture that speaks of tutors and governors if he had proven himself he would now have the authority to conduct full business now we're going to start getting into some interesting things I appreciate you listening to this study today father we just ask that you would continue to reveal yourself to us from your word we love reading today of the three milestones major milestones in your life for including the Transfiguration which was sort of like the ceiling of the placing of amateur son father we want that in our own lives and we ask you for grace to come to maturity in the wonderful name of Jesus Yeshua we pray amen thank you for watching the Eagles cry you got to hear the rest of this tune in again next time bye bye for now [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you
