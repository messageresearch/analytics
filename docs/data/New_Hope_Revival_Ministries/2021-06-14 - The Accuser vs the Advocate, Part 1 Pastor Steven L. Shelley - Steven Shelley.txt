today what god's doing in me is for eternity thank you jesus what god's doing in me is for eternity what god's making of me is for eternity it's not just for today or even tomorrow for this shall pass

that don't get tired don't get tired of praising him hallelujah he's wonderful and he's worthy of all praise hallelujah you may be seated you've been standing a long time you're going to be sitting a long time now but you might as well take a break here for just a moment we welcome you into the house of the lord this morning we welcome all of you who are streaming this service on various platforms in fact our website is open today so that anyone who goes to the website and logs on they will be bypassing the login system and they will come straight into the service which is a great blessing to many people and we are streaming also on youtube live and also on facebook live and the people are appreciating it so that makes us feel good and we're getting greetings i think one of the things i miss the most about uh using the login system uh and not having it this morning is not being able to see where people are streaming in from so if you are watching the service on youtube or facebook would you just type your country in there so that we will know where you are and i saw someone just a moment ago said i'm watching in cameroon so we want to say god bless you i'm going to have to say it in english because i can't say it in french but god bless you in cameroon and i saw where one person posted a moment ago and said what a sweet atmosphere i can feel it even online that's an answer to our prayer that's what we pray [Applause] when we prepare for the service that's what we're praying is that somehow the presence of the lord will reach through the technology otherwise it would just be a dry viewing experience but we want you to be able to sense the presence of the lord how many of you know he's been here this morning already and we know that he's not going to leave us now we want to just keep our minds focused on him for another moment so i've never really asked for permission to call brother richard paw paul but i called him that all day long yesterday and i don't know what he thinks about a 53 year old man calling him papa he couldn't possibly be my papaw but i hear it a lot i hear pawpaw and mimi and so now we know why we call her mimi i didn't realize that it was one of the pain girls who named her mimi zoe was it zoe and so she's just me me well today is paw paw brother richard me me sister elita's wedding anniversary i believe it's 41 years is that right could we just all say happy anniversary to them god bless you 41 years that's a lot i mean that's a lot 41 years and i understand that today would also be maw's wedding anniversary is that right and so we just want to say someone remembered enough to pass the word to us of course they called you by your first name and i didn't know who they're talking about i do know your first name but i said well who is that so we want to say happy anniversary to you too it was a special day for you and i know you remember it so god bless you god bless you as far as buddy the dog goes i i don't know that i've ever had three people three separate people text me uh in one single morning about a dog that was sick but that will show you how much that dog means to ian and how concerned those who love him so much were and i said well if maul would have had my number she might have been number four to text me because buddy is a part of their lives and we all choked up a little bit this morning when we were praying for him and we we pray that god will help ian now i i uh quietly called the dog the horse because it's one of the biggest dogs i've ever seen but ian has kind of grown into him but when he when he first got him it looked a little overwhelming it looked like ian could have could have ridden him to church if he didn't need it away but may the lord help them this morning uh we we think of it we can't help but but to think that they're hurting and we'd like for the lord to make a way to heal the dog he's a healer we were praying for sister megan's automobile have you ever prayed for yours oh you're too spiritual to pray for your vehicle well you better have a good mechanic then cause you're gonna need it boy i lay my hands i've laid my hands on a vehicle many many many times and if i had time this morning i'd go back there in my file cabinet and i'd pull out an old copy of only believe magazine and i would read you the story of how a dear dear friend of mine brother gerald cleveland met brother branham in the restaurant one night coming back from jeffersonville and met him there in the restaurant and he said to him brother branham we're having a lot of trouble here with the studebaker and he said we got a long way to go on some very bad roads and he said we need you to pray and brother branham told him it'll be all right just kind of bowed his head with a little little prayer it'll be all right and i want you to know the lord did miraculous things i've heard brother cleveland tell it many times it got him all the way from jeffersonville indiana to anderson south carolina and pulled in the driveway before they ever had another problem with it that was late at night they drove all night had to go to work the next morning that was the goodness of god if god can do that for a studebaker oh that although that's a pretty nice looking vehicle when you look back at them now not to say anything about your sister megan it looks like a little bug you know that just like you like it but if god can heal the studebaker he can heal little sister megan when i see her drive up in that vehicle it reminds me of those little children's books that we used to have where the little where the little bugs and insects were driving around in these tiny little little automobiles she just looks so cute driving up in there i'm not trying to be funny i mean it i'm glad i'm glad that she has that it suits her very well may god make a way for her to to have it running uh on tuesday of this week is nora's birthday is nora in here is she down between the seat somewhere there's nora happy birthday nora it's coming it's on tuesday she's smiling at you she's clapping for herself [Applause] god bless her and thursday night is uh michael's dinner to celebrate him and we had a nice time yesterday celebrating david as he gets ready and i know the sisters had a good time celebrating stephanie we have two couples sorry if you all could always be that helpful but somebody pray i can reboot who was y'all celebrating yesterday crystalline i know they had a wonderful time when the they get together like that and then on friday of this week is michael's birthday is that right so we get to celebrate the night before your birthday so we want to say happy birthday to you michael god's given you a real special birthday present even though i can't always remember her name it's she's a special girl and then i want to say to my father-in-law who's having a birthday this coming saturday streaming this service this morning how he would love to be here with us but kovit has closed the borders for a long time now it seems so we wish him a very happy birthday and we look forward to a day that he can get across that border again or we can get across the border to him one way or the other god's got all these things in his hands doesn't he now are you rested enough to stand again would you stand i want you to sing just a moment of this chorus holy spirit thou art welcome in this place and we're going to go right to the word of god see what the lord has for us and i know we've already we're already hour and eight minutes into the service but that's all right what we have experienced this morning is of great value to be in the presence of the lord like that oh holy spirit thou art well come in this place holy spirit thou art well come in

this place he really is he really is not just this place but in this place in this place in this house would you give god thanks for these musicians for the leading of the worship [Applause] for everything they've given to us turn in your bibles this morning to revelation chapter 12. beginning in verse 9. we welcome you again those of you who are joining us from many different places god bless you last sunday our service was viewed in 20 different nations and what a blessing it is to a little congregation like this to know that we've been given an opportunity to be able to reach out in that manner and we give the glory and the honor to the lord jesus christ may i say as you're pulling the scripture and getting ready to put it up for us revelation 12 verse 9 and 10 and then i'm going to read romans 8 33 and 34 that we had our second graduation service here on friday night and it was a very special evening all together brother carrie i've gone back now three times and watched the girl's song on on stream and it was a blessing to me every one of those times there was an anointing there was an anointing on on it and i enjoyed it so very much and you know sometimes you can take a song and it can be a good song but you can make it like drag you know it just kind of drags there was such a an uplift in that song and the harmony was so sweet and i appreciated it so much and i was so thankful that i uh could go back and watch it over and over and i thought zion and solomon sang so wonderful together and with i don't know if i've ever heard zion sing out like that and uh so good i wasn't the only one that noticed that so so i just would like to say there's no excuse for us not to have one special song every service there's plenty of singers here if you're waiting on us to ask you to sing you may never sing again because sometimes we're just focused on everything else what we've the song leaders trying to get his songs together and i'm trying to get birthdays together and sermon together and we may not just do it but i believe if you've got a gift you don't have to think you're a good singer but if you know you've got a gift to bless people you ought to step right up and say i've got a song whenever you can use me i'm talking to somebody whenever you can use me i've got a song and brother greeley will make a note of it if you go to him he will he'll make a note of it and we can have it i wouldn't if i actually sat here and thought if it wasn't running a little bit late and i wouldn't just scare them clean to death on a spur of a moment i'd ask them to come and sing both of those songs but i hope you all will run through it again and be ready because i sure would like to hear both of you sing it again you're still going to be here a little while and so maybe you'll do that for us in another service verse 9 of revelation 12 and i heard a loud voice excuse me you're right as usual girls you're right and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night he is a faithful adversary he has been a consistent accuser of the brethren so you don't ever have to worry about him getting slack he is always on the job now if you'll give me romans 8 verse 33 and 34 and then we'll read that together and then move on in this service this morning who shall lay anything anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify it it's between you and your god come on now you go to him and he is the justifier who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth and now the next verse who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god and we know that is the right hand of power and authority who also maketh intercession for us i want to read it again who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us now i want to speak to you today on the accuser versus the advocate we have an accuser i told you he was consistent and on the job but thanks be to god we also have an advocate and he is faithful and always on the job hallelujah and the accuser he can only play make-believe with you he can only bother you if you allow him to that's right but i want you to know what the advocate has done on our behalf is more than we can express when we get in his presence if we start reflecting on what he has done for us it will absolutely overwhelm who we are and we will just spend i don't know how much time sometimes the time slips away so fast when you get in that place of worship may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated the accuser versus the advocate satan is relentless in his accusations against the body of christ he has particularly turned his target his attention on the bride the prophet of god has told us about thousands times ten thousands of demonic spirits that have been loosed they've not been loosed against the nations of the earth they've not been loosed against an apostate church but they have been turned on the bride of jesus christ sometimes you feel the swirl sometimes you feel the repercussions of the attacks of the enemy in the bride of christ we may have it pretty good here in the united states of america where it comes to our freedom where it comes to our ability to be in church and to worship god according to to the dictates of our heart we know many of our brethren we're particularly thinking this morning about the saints of god in nigeria who are being murdered by the thousands even as we speak nigerian christians are being slaughtered as they gather to the house of god on sunday then they are mowed down and we have such a freedom such a privilege nobody tried to stop you physically coming in except that old dragon he'd be the only one thank god the government wasn't standing out there in the driveway when you arrived the doors had been unlocked for you to come in there was no big padlock on the door like there is in churches in ontario ontario canada even right now as we speak but you know we are still under a great assault and we are still under a great attack it's that greatest battle ever fought that brother branham preached about it's the assault of the mind it is the warfare of the mind it may not have the same physical ramifications or repercussions but i want you to know it'll wear you out it will weary your flesh it will discourage your soul it will even pull your spirit into a bent place and so you cannot you cannot get slack you cannot get lazy in this warfare against that lying accuser the devil you have to know who you are you have to know whose you are you have to value the price that has been paid on your behalf i was reading this morning about seven o'clock in a message book where brother branham was talking about god's blood i want you to know i don't ever get tired of hearing about that blood it wasn't the chemistry it wasn't the color it wasn't the in the natural makeup of that blood it was the life cell of god that was in that blood i tuned in just a moment last night was by myself a little while while they were volleyballing i can only take so much of the heat like that and uh i'd had it i just had had enough and so i was at home by myself and i just tuned in to a little uh archive of a service that was in virginia a week or two ago and brother joe green was preaching and uh his dad brother henry greene was a dear friend of mine and a great encouragement to me in the early days of beginning to preach this truth and brother joe is i don't mean now anything negative but he is bald-headed he i guess he shaves what little bit of hair he has off i don't really know but it is a polished head he has and his son nate is a friend of mine and he's just as just as polished as his dad and nate was a i guess kind of a seemingly a little bit late baby i may be wrong about that but i remember when he was just a little boy how much energy he had well now he's married and he has a little son whose name is charlie and charlie was i think premature and he went through a lot we followed it in prayer he went through a lot he spent a long time in the in the intensive care and god just brought him through it was just wonderful how the lord brought him through and he's loved i want you to know that little fellows loved and charlie happened to be in that service too and so did nate and brother uh green he said come up here nate and they're both large men now they didn't used to be but they're both large men now both shiny bald head dressed kind of similar and here come charlie they handed him up there and i want you to know he don't have much hair on his head either and and it's a sight to see it it's like an older and then a younger and then a younger and they all look alike there'd be no way in the world that any of the three of them could deny each other i loved what brother joe said after that he said it you see it's my genes that are expressed in nate and in charlie that's how it works he said you know nate is built a little bit more like my dad he said than i am but he said i'm working on that i'm ex i'm expanding too and it was it's genes its dna that causes there to be such a strong family resemblance in the green family i got excited before the punchline i was already shouting hallelujah before the punchline came because this is what the bride has been called to do we are to be the expression of the very dna of the very genes of a living god that was the life that was in that blood and that life is now in you it has fallen on you you approached him in faith you obeyed him in repentance he sanctified you by the washing of the water of the word to follow your justification and then baptized you with that zoy life god's own life if you remember that you have all the ammunition you need to shut down the accuser amen but in a weak moment when you don't feel the strength maybe you don't feel like you carry the gene of god maybe you're not feeling like a glorious overcomer we get that way sometime then you still have no excuse to lose because we have an advocate hallelujah we have one to stand up on our behalf even when we cannot stand up for ourselves he's always there to stand up on our behalf my what a blessed people we are so i can't spend all my time focusing on my accuser i've got to focus on the advocate the one who's stepping up for me hallelujah you know that old accuser he's like a prosecutor always easy very easy to find fault points the finger of blame accuses us with guilt and he's going for the death penalty i want you to know if satan could kill you [Music] you'd already be dead you've been on his radar since way before you had a new birth he was standing around in the heavenly places when you were a thought in the mind of god he heard some of the discussions that went on among the heavenly hosts and you might have even been in the conversation so you've been on his radar way before you had a new birth before you were ever expressed in the spirit of christ in this hour he already knew your choice he already knew your destination he already knew your struggles because he was there feeding he was there doing everything that he possibly could all along the way to intensify those things that you were vulnerable to he magnifies constantly our vulnerabilities we all have them help me preach we all have those tender spots and the enemy's always there he's he's just really something i hope i'm not smiling i don't want to smile when i say he's something because you can't express that meaning great really something he's not something he's something he really is he is twisted he's twisted and uh he is the father of lies john chapter 8 verse 40 44 excuse me let's read that ye are of your father the devil who he's not talking to the rank sinners here he's talking to the religious here you're of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning oh we're not going to break that down and cause a disturbance this morning but he was a this is jesus talking he was a murderer from the beginning it was already in him when he was created it was already in judas when judas was created it was already in the devil when he was created as lucifer certainly was jesus said he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth no truth in him any truth that he ever peddles and he will occasionally pedal a little bit of truth he has to borrow it how do we know that because he when he tells lies he hooks he places him those lies hooks elements of truth you know the garden of eden you know he didn't come in there and tell her everything opposite of what she had been told he just put a little hook in there that would that would be enough truth that she would consider it but a big enough lie to cause her to give everything to yield everything to a diabolical a plot or plan that was about to make a lot of death and a lot of destruction but yet was a very part a big part a huge part of the plan of god for my redemption for your redemption he said you you were of your of your father the devil a murderer from the beginning and he abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it how many of you have ever told him when he was praying when you were rebuking or resisting somebody said i get confused with them pentecostals because sometimes they're praying to jesus and sometimes they're talking to the devil at the same time we do it i know i'm not the only one that'll pray a while and rebuke the devil a while i guess you need to be a little more uh careful about the salutation and and make sure you're changing gears and okay now i'm talking to you devil and all that but i got a feeling he knows he knows he knows what you're doing you're telling him you're of the father of all you're a filthy liar i've told him that recently you're a filthy liar and the father of all eyes he'll tell you it'll never change he'll tell you it'll never be any different than it is right now he'll tell you she'll never be any different he'll tell you he'll never be any different he doesn't get to make that choice the devil doesn't decide who changes and who doesn't change it's a holy ghost that changes men's lives and women's lives for the glory of god he'll tell you that situation you're in he'll depress you in your marriage because everything is not just like you would like for it to be and he will depress you he'll make you think you're the only one struggling he'll make you think he'll he'll make ever you'll look around in everybody's marriage oh my they just look so purty they're just kissing each other good morning and kissing each other good night and kissing each other at breakfast kissing each other lunch never have a crossword he'll make you think you're the only one that huffs and puffs stomps her foot shuts the door vehemently you know it's been a long time and i hope it will be but you all laugh because i've told you the story when when my wife and i first got married she'd just tell me sometime when i was really putting it right she would just say she would just say talk to the hand i'd say come here and bring me that hand but thanks be to god we didn't kill each other you know we realized that the enemy is not happy if you have one healthy relationship in your life the devil is not happy he wants all of them to be messed up he wants all of them to be out of whack come on because he wants to turn around and tell you what are the benefits of serving god your marriage is no happier than somebody else is out there in the world that's a dirty lie because the only way a marriage can be successful is to be with jesus to do it with him if you try to do it without him it'll be a mess i'm thinking about these working on their second and getting ready to put that one's already put away working on the third and some are already already got their eyes on the fourth i'm going to tell you something you better get your eyes in the mirror you better find out what's wrong with you you know we think it's got to be the other one all the time all the time it's got to be the other one and when you're working on a trophy collection like that and stacking them side by side you better make sure you got some of your uh you know stuff arranged even a godly marriage with jesus christ between the husband and the wife it can be rough it can be rocky at times you know when you're in the in a little bit of a strife or there's a little something going on like that you would almost advise some young couple not to do it but once uh once that little yes i said it look at me like that but when everything's settled you want everybody to have that bliss when everything's good between you and your wife you want the whole world to feel that so just don't give advice when you're having troubles at home because listen god can rescue all of that it's the accuser that gets in the middle it's the enemy that try he does listen i told you a moment ago and i got to move on he would kill you if he could i don't buy that doctrine i'm sorry that's not a doctrine i believe i do not believe that the enemy has power to kill me whenever he gets ready to kill me when you find out if you do if if i'm if i leave before you do and you found out i'm dead don't you let nobody say if it was this afternoon and i'm gone don't you let anybody say the devil did it i don't belong to him i belong to the advocate i belong to the savior i belong to the messiah i don't serve a god whose enemy is stronger than he is i serve a god that knows how to deal with the enemy the only reason why we struggle the way we we do is because we forget who's standing up for us when you can stand up for yourself in the power of his might do it when you can stand up and quote scripture to the enemy and tell him it's written and tell him who your god is and tell him who you are do it but in that weak moment when you don't even feel like a christian if perhaps you don't even feel like you're a part of god's economy don't you you still have no excuse to lose it's in that moment that you have to say holy ghost holy ghost are you listening holy ghost i need you to stand up jesus my advocate i need you to stand up brother shelly are you going to mismix the two are you going to call both jesus and the holy ghost the advocate i am are you going to call both jesus and the holy ghost the comforter i am do you know why because the word is the same [Music] the greek word is parakletos it's the same word the same word that calls jesus your advocate is the same word that calls the holy ghost your comforter it's not two different words because it's not two different spirits it's the same manifest it's a different manifestation of the same spirit anybody with me now that's you ought to get settled on that that's something to help us that's something to help us now his old sly tactic boy this makes me i hate to say it in the pulpit this makes me mad enough to spit when i think about this was that offensive he first he entices us to sin to think to choose to move forward based on our unbelief if he can get you in a moment of doubt if he can get you in a place where unbelief is screaming at you then he is there just like this to entice you as long as you're standing still even when there's a little unbelief creeping in you may still be all right because you may recognize it by the help of the helper same word by the way advocate comforter helper you may recognize it by his help and you may be able to do something on your own but if you don't then his purpose in this enticement is to get you to make a move out of your unbelief you see we spoke last sunday and we talked about the fact that brother branham had a revelation of sin that the pentecostals didn't have in his day he saw that you're not going to get anywhere if all you're doing is preaching on drinking and smoking and cussing and running with those who do and all this kind of stuff you're never going to get to the root of where the problem lies he said these are the attributes of sin these are the outworkings of sin but the root are you with me the foundation of all sin is unbelief and if you can deal with the unbelief you have power to pull down the attributes of sin to say i will not smoke my life away i will not drink my life away i will not be impure sexually but i will stand before god with both clean hands and a pure heart you can do that when you start dealing with the root of the behaviors these are the behaviors that go with sin but it's the unbelief and if the enemy can get you to make a move if you can he can get you to make a choice if he can get you to make a decision that comes out of unbelief he is setting up a paradigm wake up folks you sleep this afternoon get a good nap don't get it now if he can get you to to move to step forward with that unbelief in your heart then everything you do will be cursed if you're building on a foundation of unbelief you're going to build a house that the enemy can huff and puff and blow it right over but if you're building on the foundation of faith the solid rock the lord jesus christ you're going to build a house for god that no weapon formed against it will be able to prosper no floods will be able to drown it no fire will be able to burn it no tornado would be able to blow it away it's built on the foundation of faith it's on the solid rock of jesus christ but if you start building on unbelief i don't care how pretty it looks i don't care how successful you look i don't care how many raises you get that's not favor one little blow and it's all gone but you build your life on solid rock faith in jesus christ and i want you to know you may you may bend a little but every time you do your roots will go down deeper and deeper and deeper on that rock so whatever you do don't move out of your unbelief don't make a decision don't choose a job please don't choose a companion don't choose a vacation plan on your unbelief because if you do you'll bring yourself into a very vulnerable position and god doesn't want us living in that kind of a place he wants us to be solid in him so every time we move out of unbelief or choose out of unbelief we're going to get in trouble then if and when we do if we do and we do some time we do make decisions based on our little feelings and any feeling that will take you away from christ is unbelief it's based on unbelief in fact any emotion that will take you away from christ it's based on unbelief you've got to dig that out by the root somebody said you can't tell me how to feel i tell you what i can tell you by the word you can tear down those thoughts i want you to know you can't be hurt unless you choose to be i'm not trying to be ugly i've been hurt i know what it feels like but you may you have to make a choice and you can also choose the duration you can choose how long it lasts you can just say i'm gonna wait on nobody i'm gonna wait on nobody ain't gonna wait on nobody i'm getting out of there i'm pulling myself up i've got the advocate i've got the holy ghost on board i got the comforter on board i got the advocate on board i got the helper on board got the savior on board i'm coming up out of this i'll give you a quote in a minute i'll show you what he said in a minute you got to get out of the cellar you got to get out of the basement you've got to make a choice to get up and if you can't get up by yourself let me tell you the good news he lives in you hallelujah he knows how to fly you up the stairs that you can't climb he knows how to soar you to the top of the mountain that you can crawl up on your own he's for us hallelujah and you don't have to get in his good graces by holding your mouth just right come on you're his you're bought with a price his word has said it but if he can get you to make a decision based on your unbelief and choose the attributes of sin whatever they look like in your life guess what he does then somebody said well i guess he just rolls over and leaves you alone or he just runs off like a dog with us are you listening maybe he just tucks his tail between his legs and runs off ah you think that's what he does no he jumps on your back he led you he deceived you he he magnified your vulnerability until you made a choice to cooperate with unbelief and it took an attribute it took an overflow whatever it was because lying find out that there's a great temptation these days for even christian people to lie you've got to fight that devil you've got to win because there's not supposed to be a lie in you he's the father of all lies the truth will hurt sometime but i tell you what it better come out of your mouth or you better be quiet because if the enemy can get a hook in you like that you will live in an augmented reality the holy ghost spoke to me just recently driving alone in my automobile when i was in prayer and he showed me that in this hour there are those who step out of reality into an augmented reality into a place of cr of their own creation they didn't have to do it by their self totally because they've got a devil and they start living in an alternate reality they tell every story out of that alternate reality they they face every situation in that place of reality and when you boil it all down it's not about anybody else it's about themselves and when somebody is like that it is a deception and you will not get help until you recognize that you are addicted to that deception i tell you it hit me so hard we become addicted to our version of what's happening to us and you know we become dependent on that kind of aversion of what's happening to us there's a there's a truth speaker who lives in you by the power of the holy ghost in every way the devil is a liar and the father of all eyes the holy ghost in you is truth and he is a truth speaker and if you will listen to him instead of your accuser if you will cooperate with your advocate instead of with your accuser the holy ghost will provide you with the weapons you need to defeat the enemy it's in our power because he's placed it there brother branham said the enemy has no power the only thing he has is what we release if you've been given authority and you release that authority the enemy's there and he will operate illegitimately in a stolen authority come on now he will he always wants to hijack god's great purpose and plan in your life and you can lay down and let him if you want to or you can make a decision today today that you have the advocate on board that's why you need to know you've got the holy ghost not so you can talk in tongues not so you can have a feeling a feeling they're cheap i love to feel the presence of god don't you misunderstand me but feelings are cheap i could get a pretty good feeling with a pretty good bowl of ice cream but that don't give me the power i need to whoop the devil come on now maybe yours is cake brother carries his pastry we had that little little conversation yesterday in the ice cream line he's kind of fond of that more than a cookie i i like a cookie with my ice cream [Laughter] let me tell you something the enemy knows exactly how to push you to prod you into an entirely dif listen hollywood knows hollywood knows about alternative reality they know about augmented reality they know how they know how to create things to keep you wondering about which reality you're watching which version you're watching because it just repeats and repeats and repeats and you don't know how to follow it you don't even know what what what realm it's in or what kind of reality is being played i see it as another way that the enemy wants to bog you down he has no power over you if you don't release it to him he has no authority over you unless you release it to him now what that means is you got to gather your stuff your weapons that are given to you you got to gather them up you've got to listen you've got to take care of your tools [Applause] i was thinking about brother richard when i said that because we've had conversations in the past i'm glad ben's nodding we've had a conversation in the past about how frustrating it is to miss your tools because somebody borrowed them and i want you to know that when they borrowed them david i believe it was david david let's preach on david you got to borrow something ben's glad i'm off to be in a minute david got to borrow something to brother greeley's because he's so good to return it until he didn't epic fail on that brother you better get that back brother richard used to say i i know i had it i saw it and then i didn't he said well they'll just come they'll just come it's been a long time since we had this conversation zach is guilty too wherever he is he said they'll just come get it and then i'll look for it i won't be able to find it i'll tell you what's worse than that it's when you're up in the woods somewhere and find it that'll really get you you know you ain't been up there nailing nails in a tree 75 nails in a tree you know you had better things to do with your time than that but one of them youngins you were so proud of borrowed your beautiful shiny craftsman hammer and left it up in the woods to rust you better take care of your tools you better take care of your power you better take care of the authority that god's given you you better sharpen your sword you better watch your confession because every bit of this are tools that we've been given to defeat the enemy are you with me so that old devil i gotta hurry that old devil he'll entice you he'll get you to move and make a decision based on your unbelief and then instead of leaving you alone and say hey i got one more in my column he will jump on your back that slimy slow-footed imp he will climb on your back and hold on your your neck becomes his harness his reigns and he will hold on to you with everything that he has to weigh you down to shame you to guilt you to condemn you and he will even confuse you so that you think it's the spirit of god dealing with you and you will sometimes misunderstand the condemnation of the enemy for the convicting of the holy spirit you got to get your voices distinguished you and i have got to know who's talking to us and quite often both are if you think the devil talks in your ear well i can do a lot better than that i wasn't practicing if you think that's how he comes i used to say it like this one i've preached back in the 10 days i used to say if you think the devil will come to you like he does on the can of deviled ham with horns and a pitchfork and that's what you're looking for to know who he is you're never going to recognize the devil he transforms himself into an angel of light he has even been known to appear in a form that looked like the lord jesus christ several of our early apostolic fathers had visitations from a christ-like being who was not jesus christ but but uh none other than the devil who had transformed himself into an angel of life to deceive you've got to not just know the sound of his voice so i tell you he can throw his voice how many of you believe he's the best ventriloquist that's ever lived you just believe if you don't believe that just go out in the world and hear him talk he'll talk to you in a v in a in a body of a waitress he'll talk to you in the body of a cashier he'll talk to you by someone pushing a cart next to yours in walmart i'm going to tell you something you better be careful the way you drive i've been telling my sons and i hope you'll pray for them both of them are are driving today and joshua would have been driving at three o'clock this morning and his mother and i just felt like that wasn't going to work him by itself and so we we said don't you just stay right there and you come home later today benjamin is in salt lake city are gone already now driving to washington estate and then they will be driving from washington state to texas this week to be home for next weekend i want you to pray for them if you think of it please while they're on the road i've told them both be careful how you treat other drivers be as courteous as you can even if they make you mad and i don't get mad often just every time i get in the car i see the way people do and i'm just wondering who gave them their license i think they got it in a crackerjack box they surely didn't get it at the department of motor vehicle but you react just right and you get a bullet you read of a precious child killed in a road rage accident because somebody shot into the vehicle and you say uh that is you know that happens out there i guess some people that i guess that man in the in the marriott parking lot wouldn't have thought it would have happened to him i guess those people across the river in downtown columbus this weekend they wouldn't have thought somebody would have come along and shot them the one that he shot saturday in columbus downtown i don't think he probably was expecting to get shot they caught him finally after shooting people on both sides of the river none of them have passed away but all of them were shot the motive hasn't come out i don't know what it will be they're just calling him a serial shooter but i want you to know there are people around you all the time in this world that are on the last millimeter of their fuse i tell them i tell them please be careful i don't care if they cut you off and run you in the ditch you do the best you can to pull yourself out of the ditch and go on to the best of your ability unless you're in my vehicle during my vehicle stay out of the ditch at all possible stab the ditch that's the world that we live in and the enemy is always looking for ways to get over on you after he has enticed us and he flops on our back weighing us down to condemn us he will encourage us to do it and then we do it and he calls us a loser because we yielded to his voice did what he said you know i'm telling you the truth i want you to know the health department will come along every now and again and they will condemn a dilapidated house they stamp a mark they put a put a sign on it with a nail it on the door hang it on the fence and they say this is this is dilapidated and we are declaring this unfit for occupancy that's the enemy's goal if that is condemning a house that's exactly what the enemy wants to do he wants to cause you to feel like that you are unfit for occupancy but he doesn't get to choose who lives in your house you get to choose now if you're on your phone instead of listening to me put it down before i come and get it if i need help beth will come with me he will absolutely try to decide who lives in your house condemn you and say you're not even fit for jesus to come in hell you're not fit for the holy ghost look what you thought look what you did look what you chose yeah you chose exactly what he talked you into choosing i'm not making an excuse for you you've got to discern oh i'm so confused brother shelly i'm so confused i don't know who's talking to me i i don't recognize let me tell you something you will not be confused if you fill your life with the word of god you will recognize what god says you will recognize what god thinks you will recognize how god moves because he reveals himself he reveals himself in his word you don't ever have to be deceived by any other voice if you are familiar with what he thinks what he says how he operates it's revealed to us in the word it's revealed to us in the message of the hour you can say amen his goal is to condemn you to declare you unfit for use god can't even use you he'll whisper in your ears you've failed too many times god won't forgive you you're unworthy he'll never use you again but i'm telling you again john 8 44 he's the liar and the father of it could i have the quote how can i overcome i got to hurry how can i overcome good good question isn't it good good sermon how can i overcome 1963 paragraph 104 he said look temptation was for him you know that 1963 paragraph 104 it should be there i see you're looking hard for it i'll just i'll just take a water break and if we don't find it that's all right we'll just read on for years we just had to read them with no no way for you to read them i like to put them there because i've had many people say it helps them especially if there's any stumbling in the in the expression at all then it's kind of if there's an extra uh or a pause or something then sometimes it helps us a lot to be able to see it in print but i'm going to read on look temptation was for him you know what excuse me you know that the bible said he was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin if you want that scripture reference you can jot this down it's hebrews 4 15 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin oh my what a high priest what an advocate what a comforter what a helper hallelujah all point tempted as we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking oh my i don't know if there's any pentecostal ears here but by denomination but if there is you're gonna you're gonna choke i just know what the bible said i may not be all that smart but i know what all means there may be some words i have to look up but all ain't one of them i know what all means all means all right but the band said by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything i just kind of cause i just i just cannot stand for someone to to to pull down the lord or to or to bring him down and make him look carnal well i want you to know your religious spirit is blinding you from seeing what has been accomplished in your life because that's exactly what the father did came all the way down not to live like a superhero not to live in the body of an angel not to live in a theophany body he came all the way down bless his holy name to live in a physical earthly body tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin so that you and i can understand that it is not uncommon to man to be tempted by all of these things but you don't have to yield to unbelief he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir paragraph 105 overcome means to recognize listen to what overcome means overcome means is it straight overcome you always might as well help me one way if you're not going to help me another right overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks how are you going to overcome the enemy if you can't recognize him when he comes huh we've got to recognize him he said a lot of people said there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that i'm hurrying this is me and fast forward don't you believe that that's a there is a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody else a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's the devil then the same time you recognize him you know that he's the devil he's against you then to overcome you must recognize whoop you must recognize that the god in you hello i wish you all could see this somehow i missed it you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's already in you the one that's in you that the one that's in you has already overcome him watch this and by his grace you are more than a match for him somebody say by his grace without it he'll clobber you without it the devil will tie you in a knot like a pretzel without it he'll defeat you eleven dozen different ways but with the grace of god you are more than a match that's just what the bible said this isn't brother brandon i'm just thinking of something to say the bible said greater greater [Music] is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh thank you jesus thank you jesus now give me the scripture please first john chapter 2 verse 1. first john chapter 2 verse 1. my little children these things right eye unto you that ye sin not and if any man's sin we have an advocate with the father here is his name jesus christ the righteous hallelujah the amplified says my little children i write you these things so that you may not violate god's law and sin but if anyone should sin we have an advocate one who will intercede for us with the father it is jesus christ the all righteous upright just who conforms to the father's will in every purpose thought and action we have an advocate we have an accuser we have an adversary but we have an advocate in a message called what is the holy ghost paragraph 134 we have this and it's powerful to hear he said the body of christ is one spirit where every member from pentecost to this time drinks of the same new wine the same holy ghost bringing forth the same results how do we do it by one spirit let me ask you all the question do you see the document there with the with today's date or you don't you don't have it at all all right it's god's open door the holy spirit he said what is it it's god's open door he said it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's rest it's peace it's goodness it's healing it's life he's talking about the holy ghost he's talking about the holy ghost it's god's open door the holy spirit what is it it's god's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's rest it's peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it's god's open door it's god's open door to christ he said god provided that he raised jesus up from the dead and those that are dead in christ will god bring with him at the resurrection grieve not the holy spirit whereby you were sealed into christ until the day of your redemption phew how many believes it i believe it how many of you believe he's a sign he's a seal he's a comforter he's an advocate he's assurance he's rest he's peace he's goodness he's healing he's life whoa he is hallelujah we're nearly done let me read hebrews chapter two number two this is the hebrew series paragraph 172 through 174 man always feared death christ became sin made low to take death upon himself and he's not ashamed to be called our brother for he was tempted just like we are tempted and he can be the right kind of intercessor we have an adversary we have an accuser but we have an intercessor we have an advocate hallelujah whoa you just have to forgive me if you need to because he stood the same kind of temptation that you stand he took your place knowing that you couldn't take it yourself i want you to know that the devil would not succeed in anything if he killed you your death would make only a difference to those who loved you to those who cared for you and most of us face the reality it's a harsh reality but most of us have faced the reality that if we died tonight the sun would come up in the morning just like it did this morning it would set tomorrow evening just like it was set this evening and in the great scheme of things you and i are passing on wouldn't make much of a difference so the devil rather than to just kill you he'd like to if he could but he knows that he's a little bit limited in his power to do that so what he really wants to do is torment your mind i wish you'd help me so that you live way down here below who you are in christ i'm not stopping until i get to that quote so you might as well just hold on another minute or two he said he took your place knowing that you can couldn't take it yourself he said so don't you see brother sister the whole thing is grace whoa hallelujah oh some people say well when i listen to that brother branham you know it just seemed like he's all about works seem like he's always telling the women how to dress somebody ought to tell them how it is a fact that most of them around us are insane because they'll go right to town in their underwear now if that's not insanity i don't know what it is go right in the public in their underwear and you know it's true so if he did spend a little bit of time telling people then god bless him but he wasn't hanging anybody's salvation on that he knew that it was not our works that saves us but our works do demonstrate our faith this is how we show faith by how we work by how we live by how we behave you know it's right but he's clear here so don't misunderstand he said the whole thing is grace all of its grace it's not what you do anyhow it's what he's already done for you does that sound does that sound like a legalistic preacher to you not to me not to be it's what he's already done for you he said now you can't do one thing to merit your salvation lord have mercy i wish you tell somebody you can't do one thing to deserve it on my best day i've never deserved him whoa on the day i slept maybe i was sick somewhere years ago somewhere along the way and slept all day didn't have time to be bad but even on that day i didn't deserve him no siree you can't do one thing to merit your salvation your salvation is a gift christ became sin that you might become righteous and he's the right kind of a chief captain of our salvation because he suffered just like we suffered he's been tempted just like we're tempted and he's not ashamed to be called our brother hallelujah because because he knows what we go through he knows what we go through with old blessed be his name for verily he took not on him the form of angels but he took on the seed of abraham oh i'm i've got to hurry here he said oh my he didn't become an angel he become the seed of abraham and we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and her heirs oh i guess i'm yelling or not we are heirs according to the promise see he never took on the form of an angel never become an angel he become a man he become the seed of abraham he took the sting of death in his own flesh so that when you die you don't have to feel the sting of death he took it in his own flesh to reconcile us back to god whoo and now sets there that's what i want you to hear again sets there for an intercessor my how could we reject you don't you tell me you've got two intercessors you've got jesus the advocate and the holy ghost no no no no same spirit oh what jesus accomplished for you uh with you and uh outside of you is glorious but that same jesus i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you same jesus same spirit same spirit same spirit whoa what he's doing on in on the inside of you is so great he's the right kind of intercessor now let me do this quickly oh 119. i've got a few minutes thank you the greek word paracletos is translated advocate here in 1st john the scripture we read that jesus is our advocate let me give you the reference again first john 2 1. i'm leaning a little bit i'm sorry i'm leaning i do that sometime toward the end not because i'm about to pass out or anything like that but i strain my sciatica and uh friday night i i strained it somehow i don't know what i did exactly i certainly wasn't preaching hard but somehow i strained it and i was having a real struggle and in worship i could feel it so i just sat down just a minute not to sit down on worship but to just rest because i knew i had to stand here so please forgive me if i lean just a little bit it's not because i want to be casual about this this is serious business this morning isn't it it's not some sloppy business so forgive me please he said now he's not ashamed to be called our brother hallelujah he took on abraham no excuse me the greek word parakletos translated advocate here in 1st john the address one more time 2-1 is also same word paraquatos translated comforter same word four times in reference to the holy ghost the same word is used to describe jesus the advocate and the holy ghost our comforter i don't know if that helps you at all but that helped me i thought here's another proof there's another it's not another spirit it's not a counterfeit it's not a it's not a duplicate of it's the same spirit the same spirit that was in christ the very same spirit that was in christ is now in you he did say that didn't he somebody ought to read the book of john somebody ought to read the book of john it's there for you let me give you an example john 14 16 he said and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever that word comforter is the exact same word for advocate it's paraquitos it's the same word used to describe the work that jesus does in our life that was john 14 16. in john 14 26 which one of the girls was it that was weeping because they couldn't write it all down abby i would i tell you that's a treasure that's a real moment to remember we heard that at the graduation she just crawled up in her daddy's arms very sad you could hardly understand her she was so broken and she just finally got it out what was wrong with her she just couldn't write it all down in church she was making notes like she'd been encouraged to do but she just couldn't write it all down i don't know anybody that could honey i'll be honest although i see some of these notebooks and and see people writing the whole time but i don't believe they get it all to you if they just ask me i'd give them a copy this is not copyrighted material i'd be glad to share it john 14 26 is the next one write that down abby you got a pen but the covener which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name wow now we're getting another office of god involved here same spirit he shall teach you all things here is another identifying ministry of the holy ghost he's a teacher aren't you glad oh i really appreciate this you that are maybe less than 50 you don't know how to appreciate this but i do and bring all things to your remembrance i know this is about promises and and so forth but i need that i need to remember who i am and what has been said about me because of whose i am whatsoever i have said unto you so that word comforter there is the same paracletos that is translated advocate in first john and one and two more john 15 26 just go home and read john 14 john 15 and john 16. read all three chapters this is powerful powerful truth here verse 26 of 15 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father so it must be the father spirit i thought it was jesus's spirit i thought it was the holy spirit hmm you know how you're supposed to respond to that the word amen amen amen it's all three it is a spirit that proceeded from the father it is the spirit of jesus christ it is the holy spirit working in our life there are three very distinct operations of god and the god had no doubt about it but there's only one spirit only one holy spirit only one eternal spirit thank you jesus it helps me a lot and the last one is john 16 7. nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you necessary that i go away for if i go not away here's the key here's the key jesus is saying there can't be two permanent demonstrations of god in the earth at the same time that's not the plan of god we're still in this and this was the introduction of the church ages here they're about to enter into the church age period and during that church age period god was going to operate the same god but in very distinct ways and jesus is telling you here i'd love to stay with you oh my i'm enjoying myself here and believe me they wanted him to stay but i'll tell you the truth it's necessary it's expedient it's to your benefit that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you don't forget he also says i will come to you how can that be said because he is the same are you still with me do we have any of the other quotes the comforter do we have that one i want to read two more and close oh that's good pastor just do more we can give you a few more minutes good paragraph 147 of the comforter what is it god's word anchored in your flesh that gives you eternal life that gives you the resurrection power to bring you from the things of the world from blind traditions of man to walk i like this phrase i wish you wish you could see it to walk in the sunlight s-o-n not s-u-n to walk in the s-o-n light of the health of god the sunlight of the health of god i don't know about you but i want to get in that sunlight i'm not a s-u-n worshiper but i am an s-o-n worshiper and i want to turn my face right toward the s-o-n and get underneath god's health that's wholeness that's completion fullness now listen to this lord thank you so much to walk in the sunlight of the health of god and look at this next phrase here that's what the comforter does this is what i wanted to read i can i don't have to read two now i can stop a one because i wanted to get to this one it lifts you out of that cellared condition is that even a word it is now because god's kentucky gentleman just made it a word i love it i know i didn't have to look it up i knew exactly what it meant that's what's so wonderful about this kind of a ministry it's not so far above our heads that we have to try to figure out what he meant oh aren't you glad i know it's beneath some of you your fine education i had a woman throw a book at me one time she said i couldn't follow that babbling she said how in the world would you ever expect me to follow that stammering and stuttering and and i can't even follow his thought i said well you really should be careful i'm not going to be religious here but you really should be careful that's kind of an awful thing to say and i said but don't worry about it sis there's enough of us bumpkins that god loved so much to give us a truth in a language and in a vocabulary that we can understand hallelujah so he said god that comforter listen what the comforter does it lifts us out of that cellared condition you know what that's like hanging around in those dank spaces you know what it's like to be hanging around down in that that uh oh i'm gonna i thought come to my mind i'm gonna i'm gonna dismiss it you get out of here you know how the spiders creep they just build their webs damp smell dark one old light bulb hanging down from the ceiling we used to have to keep all kind of flashlights and batteries to get down now we just told our phone you get down there by yourself and the door slams and you wonder what kind of hank has locked you in the old basement i know you go over to billy brother billy and sister laurels you don't have that kind of basement it's up against a bank and there's a lot of light down there i'm talking about a real one i'm talking about a real canadian basement except they fix theirs up until they're living spaces it's a wonderful place it's extension of their home but i've been in some that was not an extension of anybody's home it was just a place where all gasoline smelled like gasoline because the old weed eaters had been tucked under there and the old lawn mowers tucked under there and all had drains in the bottom because the water would seep in and had to drain out you down there in that cellar you couldn't live like that long in that dark and in that terrible environment but oh i have good news for i'm gonna i'm you pray that i can just finish this in english hallelujah i want to tell you you have a comforter who's come to lift you out of that cellared condition stuck in a dirty dank damp ugly spiderweb basement and bring you right up oh hallelujah right out of the cellar right out of the basement praise god right into the presence of god what a comforter who cares about an accuser you have a comforter you have an advocate you have a teacher you have a helper you have the seed of god in you he said it breathes [Music] who would choose to live in the basement of accusation hallelujah when you can be lifted up out of that place filled with the peace and the joy of the holy ghost who is our seal who is our hope who is our healer who is our strength come on lifts you up into the presence of god gives you an experience with god that's a personal one and you can scream with job of old i know i know my redeemer limit i know my redeemer living how do i know because he delivered me up out of the cellar and he brought me up hallelujah whoa he didn't just lead me to the kitchen he didn't just lead me to the living room or the parlor but he led me all the way into the place of intimacy that's the message for the bride he took you all the way into the bedroom because there was a oneness that god longed to have let the musicians make their way this way please he longed to have fellowship with you behind that closed door behind the veil of his flesh oh yes i'm going to do the last one because it's short hello i've been preaching my battery low in my in my pooter here questions and answers on the holy ghost paragraph 43 that little that little booklet i don't know if you have it or not how many of you have the holy ghost booklet you ought to read it again you ought to read it again i remember reading it one time and feeling just just my my impression was my that's that's really simple i wasn't i wasn't saying that in a critical way but i just don't mind that you know he's just really saying the things that we know about the holy ghost but boy i've read it recently i went through it again recently and i i saw layers and it's the sermons uh what is the holy ghost what is the holy ghost given for uh questions and answers on the holy ghost what else is in that little booklet i don't know if we have any extra ones here but you could get it online you can read this holy ghost series online from 59 i think it is yes but in the one on questions yeah december of 59 this is from questions and answers on the holy ghost which is 12 19 december 19th of 59. i love this it's short he said and we find out that the holy ghost is god himself in you lord of mercy i've heard people try to explain it didn't make no sense it made no sense at all and when they when they had gone on for two hours or trying to make it easy it was more mysterious than it had ever had to be in the beginning and i finally told one brother i said if you don't quit talking about the mystery of the trinity nobody's going to even think that they can believe god or know god there is no scripture that says there's a deep mystery of the trinity the only reason why it's mysterious is it was man-made it was a roman catholic creed it had nothing to do with the scripture at all if i'm stepping on your toes i'm sorry bring your steel boots next time because it really gets my goat sometime when i think about that when when preachers are so confused in in trying to explain it and then the only way they know how to end it is just to finally say but it's the mystery of the trinity so don't expect to ever understand it i don't believe that if you do you're alone i don't believe that here's what i believe we find out the holy ghost is god himself in you god was above you in the pillar of fire with moses god was with you in jesus christ now god is in you in the holy ghost no three gods no three gods one god working in three offices no mystery no mystery a beautiful i want you to know the most amazing i don't want to call it a plot because sometimes i say that and people think of you know like uh plotting wrong but when i say it i mean like you're watching a film and it has a story line there is no greater storyline than god's redemption plan i mean he could have sat on the throne for the whole thing and watched it all roll away but instead he chose to come down and actively play a role what a role he played help me what a role he played died on the cross suffered oh felt it all suffered died shed blood for you and i that we wouldn't have to live down in the cellar sometimes when i hear people talking about the struggles of life i wonder if people hear them would they ever want to be a christian i don't mean we should deny the realities of of depression i've lived it you're gonna have a hard time coming talking to me about how depression works because i've lived it but i've chosen and i choose today and by god's grace i'll choose tomorrow to know that i've got somebody with me i've got somebody with me that chose to help me get out he helped me he helped me how many of you has ever helped you how many of god ever helped you get out of the basement how many of you the lord's ever lifted you up out of that place of despair oh yes oh yeah so yes oh yes oh yes sir yes oh yes i almost i almost yeah i guess you could save this i guess i could save it but i'm not going to i just always say with this this two hours with me on sunday morning it's a whole lot shorter than an hour and a half on sunday morning an hour and a half on sunday night that'd be three hours so three minus two is you're saving a whole hour i'm giving you this veteran daylight savings time to come to church here on sunday morning huh how many of you have ever read the book the pilgrim's progress i almost gave this to the girls but i didn't because the wording the language of it you know i thought you might even want to see it but in his book and and i i was my wife and i were in england many times and one time we were there they took us to the is it bedford they took us to the village where john bunyan lived and they took us to the prison they showed us the door the door of the prison where john bunyan was how he was mistreated what he went through and how he wrote this amazing classic that some people still have never taken the time to read called the pilgrims progress and they've got even they've even got uh you know when i say more modern they've got easier to read versions of it now they've even got children's versions don't they kids version children that that just kind of i think maybe this is maybe this is too commercial i don't have any for sale so i guess i can say it they even made it a board game for young ones to play to show them well oh my goodness if you're going to play apples and cart apple apples and ladders shoots and ladders if you're going to play shoots and ladders then surely you could play this game because this is a real journey we're talking about he describes in his book a battle between the accuser apollon and christian the main character and it took place in the valley of humiliation i know that a lot of us would very much like to fast forward past the valley of humiliation but there's only one way to get to the celestial city and that's to follow the path anybody want to help me one of apollon's ploys is to recite a laundry list of christians sins i don't know if you remember this from the book but listen to this thou didst faint at first setting out when thou wast almost choked in the gulf of despond anybody ever spent time in the gulf of this bond or in the valley of despair or in the valley of humiliation thou didst attempt wrong ways to be rid of thy burden whereas thou shouldst have stayed till thy prince had taken it off thou didst sinfully sleep and lose thy choice thing thou wast also persuaded to go back at the sight of the lions and when thou talkest on thy journey and of what thou hast heard and seen thou art inwardly desirous of vain glory in all that thou sayest or doest this was the laundry list of accusations against poor old christian who had been through a whole lot if you've read the book one more time who's read read it you think you've read it all the way through i want you to hear what christian responded to the accuser it was full of humility and faith he said all this is true if you want a fool with the devil [Music] just be humble he does not know what to do with humility with faith that is robed with humility he just said yes yes yes yes accuser all that you have accused me of is true and much more which thou has left out you don't you haven't told me anything i didn't know i did all that i did everything you said and i'm just wondering why you didn't name all the other things i've done i've done way more than that but the prince of whom i serve but the prince whom i serve and honor is merciful and ready to forgive but besides these infirmities possessed me in thy country for there i suck them in and i have groaned under them been sorry for them and have obtained pardon from my prince at the mention of christ's forgiveness the accuser flies into a rage satan the accuser cannot abide the fact that his accusations are overcome by the grace of god in jesus christ hallelujah let the advocate meet your accuser let him answer on your behalf and if you are forced to answer you could just say yes so many times i have failed him many more than what you have whispered in my ear today but i have repented i have owned my mistakes and sins and i have repented of them and now the blood of jesus speaks on my behalf i want you to know the advocate will shut down the accuser any time you call him up and allow him to take preeminence in your life if you believe that would you stand to your feet i won't you're not clapping for me but i would like for you to clap your hands for the lord jesus christ i would like for you to give thanks to god that he has placed such a marvelous advocate a marvelous comforter to live on the inside of you would you praise him with me right now [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] lord would you raise somebody up out of the cellar would you lift somebody up today out of the basement oh advocate oh comforter teacher helper would you lift somebody up would you deliver somebody from the valley of despair from the pond of despond would you deliver us [Applause] whoa hallelujah lord jesus can we trade our spiders to stand in the presence of the heavenly host can we get rid of the darkness get rid of them moldiness damp stench of the cellar and get up there where the s-o-n light is shining the health of god down over i'm go i'll tell you what i'm about to fly hallelujah if i had any strength i would fly hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lord do it where's ben you're the worship leader brother can you come and lead us in something oh hallelujah i'm sorry i i think i forgot to tell the ladies that there was a document there you all look every time you come in because i failed you i failed to send you a text and tell you i'd put a new one in and it'll always be under today's date and if i don't get to it today i'll get to it the next time we come together hallelujah aren't we blessed aren't we blessed hallelujah whoa if i i don't have much right now i got to get a breath or a break or i'd sing i can if i have to because i sure caught being off guard i'm sorry ben hallelujah is this going to help us oh spread the tidings round wherever man is [Music] the holy ghost from heaven [Music] has come the long long night has passed the morning breaks at last and hush the dreadful well and fury of the blast [Music] [Music] wherever [Music] [Music] and it swings [Music] brings the comforter [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] a child [Music] [Music] [Music] found [Music] he goes from heaven [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] once again [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yes lord yes yes lord i thank you [Music] i thank you lord whatever your need is today wherever you are in this building he is the comforter he is still the same god today as he was yesterday and if you have received the baptism of the holy ghost and you're in a battle today he is the same god today as he was the day that you received the initial baptism of the holy ghost and he's here as your comforter as your advocate he is here the one to help you to strengthen you to guide you to pull you up out of your basement up out of your cellar up about of your deep dark hole he is here today to do exactly that for you as you reach out in faith and say lord i know i can't pick myself up but i am reaching out in faith knowing that you are the one who saved me out of my darkness and you put my name on the lamb's book of life and i refuse to be accused one more moment i refuse it and i'm calling out to you lord come and be the advocate that i need at this moment i reach out in faith i reach out in expectation that you're going to pull me up out of that place now lord i thank you that we can look to you the one who started this work in us and you knew that there were going to be valleys of humiliation you knew that there were going to be sellers dark places in our life and god you are the one who ordained these things you are the one david told us in the psalms that you were the one that had these things picked out for us and so god we come to you asking you for the strength that we need at this moment you promised lord when there were when we as men had no strength left lord you showed us in the word that even young men get weak young men lose their strength but oh when the holy spirit the comforter comes and he just puts something on the inside then we'll rise up with wings like eagles and we'll come up out of that place oh holy spirit living god we call on you today to infuse us once again with that same holy spirit that raised up jesus christ from the dead infuse us one more time o lord to come up out of our valley up out of our basement up out of the cellar where we've been oh god i honor you i give you praise i bless you jesus because you are our comfort our strength our advocate oh hallelujah hallelujah we worship you jesus hallelujah if you've asked him then just begin to worship him and thank him for who he is you may not you may not feel one ounce different at this very moment but i believe that if you just start worshiping the lord and saying thank you lord that you are who you said you are i believe that god will minister to you even this moment hallelujah lord i give you praise i give you adoration mighty god for your great and marvelous hallelujah hallelujah we worship you lord we worship you lord great and mighty great and mighty great and mighty great and mighty are you o lord you have never failed us you have never
