Description:
We are expecting a new installment of God’s Word to transform us.  Not new Truth, but we must discover what the Spirit of God is highlighting for this hour.  Now the ‘Living Word’ is looking for a body to live in, a Bride to dwell in.  He is looking for true intimacy in a people who will posture to hear His heartbeat.  They are being prepared as forerunners for the final manifestation Christ in the earth, the Bride’s Revival, time for true intimacy in the tent.    

There will be no revival, no true full force revival in the Bride until we love Him more than we love ourselves, until we love the Word more than we love this world.  But it’s coming!
