Description:
74  We see that the astronomers are predicting, sometime in this early part or the first part of the month, beginning on the second or the fifth, or somewhere along this month, the Indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces. And the American newspapers make fun of it. I do not believe the world’s going to blow to pieces, but I do say it’s wrong to make fun of it. Because, something’s fixing to happen one of these days, something similar to that, when the five planets, Mars, Jupiter and Venus, and—and so forth, comes into their—their…They never have did it. Oh, they claim maybe twenty-five thousand years ago, but who was back there to know it?

75  I predict that this has a spiritual application. I believe it’s the coming in of the issue of God, that the great revelations of the Word will be opened during this time. Remember, they claim it was three stars came into their orbits when Jesus was born. And this is five, and five is grace, the number of grace. Three is the number of perfection. Five is the number of grace, J-e-s-u-s, g-r-a-c-e, f-a-i-t-h, so forth. Number of grace! God ever sends His power to the church, it’ll be His grace, it won’t be the obedience of the people. And Isaiah said, in the 40th chapter, how to “cry to Jerusalem, that her warfare was over,” yet she was guilty of idolatry, but it was God’s grace that was sending it. God sends anything to us, it’ll be His grace and not our merits. So, it may mean something. I predict that there’ll be a change. I don’t know what it’ll be, but I believe it’s fixing to happen. We’re on the…right on the eve of it now.

76  And if any man hungers, let him come to Christ. If any man is thirsty, let him come to Christ. He quenches the thirst. He is the Satisfier of all of our thirst and hunger.

you learn to have a praise life oh it just strengthens the union that you have with him you may be seated you look beautiful today it's so wonderful to see you in the house of the Lord and it's wonderful to feel his presence today amen and for those of you that were concerned they they caught the Tiger yeah the storm that came to troop County just a county over there fell through last night in LaGrange and uh Disturbed The Wild Animal Safari Park and two tigers were loose and they got one right away but while we were getting ready to start the service they caught the last tiger so they got the tiger by the tail forgive me I forgive me I had to say it please forgive me I should have stepped over there to say it right but they caught the tiger by the tail and everyone can be at rest today I wasn't really worried too much about it but anyway did any of you see those big hailstones that fell in the Grange last night huge some of them bigger like a like a size of a baseball and if you saw I saw some photos this morning of of vehicles I mean destroyed big big windshields knocked out and and dents maybe 40 50 dance since in the hood about that big around because the hill was so heavy and you know what we God was so good to us I can't help but think uh I don't know did it rain in the night did the wind blow did anything happen I don't know I don't know it's it's like my granny told my granddaddy you've heard me tell it she'd get up in the middle of the night and he'd say Mildred there's a tornado coming it's going to get us it's going to blow us away she'd say oh honey go back to bed she said go back to sleep she said if if it's your time to go it doesn't matter whether you're on top of the bed or under the bed you're going so she said you might as well sleep she said we're resting in Jesus amen and I wasn't worried about you not being in church today I knew you'd come on anyway this there's no safer place to be than in God's presence with his people and you can bring his presence right there in your home and be safe and we all have so much to be thankful for is the anniversaries of the terrible uh tornadoes just passed you know some weeks ago the awful uh remembrances that we have the memories we have every year of of just how how close they were and how protected we are and any way we could just take all day today to say how many times God has has protected us and kept us and anyway we are glad to see you in the house of the Lord we're missing some today but we trust that all is well and we made it home safely yesterday afternoon about 4 15 when we were trying to Route our way home it kept warning us that we were going to maybe we should reroute because there were very strong thunderstorms around the Dothan area yesterday that had had done great damage in Mississippi some of you know that there was a whole stretch of towns wiped out in Mississippi Friday evening and my wife said well what should we do I said well we we just don't want to waste that 20 minutes to go around why don't we just go right through and just believe that the Lord and you know what we never saw anything but a few raindrops we just drove right through I don't know what happened to the awful storms that that Maps was warning us about but you know he takes care of us he takes care of his children we're going to get to the word in a moment but before we do let me also thank you for your prayers for me I came all winter long without any sickness went all the way through the winter it was in my home my wife had it three different times my children had it they had pink eye they had strep throat they had everything and I came all the way through all winter long without anything until this week I woke up not well not feeling well on Tuesday and then on Wednesday uh pretty pretty rough I decided that if I was going to be here for Sunday and and being that's one phone call I did not want to make I did not want to call Brother Greely and say well and uh so I went to the to the Urgent Care and your prayers is what brought me through I know that but the doctor there a real Precious doctor was really glad to meet her and to make her acquaintance and she told me that she almost came here to Smith Station this was her second choice and she almost came here to to practice and because of a friend of hers in Auburn who had invited her but anyway I had an opportunity to talk to her about some pretty serious things in the Lord he just opened the door and I realized that there was more than one reason for being there she's I said I've got to have this knocked out by Sunday and she said do you mind shots and I said well I've never ran and got in line for one but uh whatever it takes or a steroid shot in one hip and an antibiotic a shot in the hip and five prescriptions and lots of prayer or I wouldn't be standing here today God is good he cleared the infection in my eye and uh have a little coughing spells from time to time that's okay and I and as far as feeling I feel like I could run a marathon that is the goodness of the Lord that's his grace you said what's all that medicine in you no it's all the good exercise I've been getting 247 miles I've walked since February the 14th and you know that's for me a miracle a miracle and most of it I won't say all of it but most of it pain-free and uh it has been because the Lord was inspiring it and he gave the strength to do it and uh I'm believing to be able to do as much as possible to keep some of that up however let me say that walking down my road and walking around the loop here won't be near as much as my three miles of undisturbed beach that I've walked on almost every day for five and a half weeks I'm going to miss it I had many many many encounters on that beach over these last five and a half weeks and I'm so thankful for it and you'll hear more about some of it as time goes on God even sending us to people there were many days I walked that three miles and never saw but two or three people also walking and there were times that the Lord would send me to someone and as I walked there one day two young men from Clemson University walked over to me and they said we are Christians and we have committed two hours a day of our spring break to witness for Christ and they said we want to know if in three words two or three words can you describe your life and I said I'm very blessed and they said well what made you what would make you say that do you consider yourself a spiritual person I said well I guess I don't really think of my I mean you know but yes and and he said for how long I said since I was 18 months old and he said well you mean you remember 18 months old I said absolutely you have an encounter like I had at 18 months old and you'll remember it too I was quiet I let them do some of their talking and at the end of it they said this has just been as much for us as anything because you've been crying I said well they said well could we pray for you and I said absolutely I'm I'm really kind of struggling in my uh feeling today allergies or something I'm not sure what it is so I just put my hands right up in the air and I said just pray for me and they begin to pray and they did very well and when we got through I thought oh I'm not missing my chance I said fellas could I pray for you all and they said yes absolutely and I began to pray and speak into their lives and we begin to have wonderful a wonderful uh encounter you know that's just we we you and I are just light bearers we're just carrying the Light of Christ and to be honest with you these two young men don't know what we know but they had some light they they had met the Lord there's no doubt in my mind and I pointed them in the right direction to help them find everything they need to make a Rapture and let's just pray for them so anyway thank you for your prayers for us God is good and didn't brother Greeley do an out absolutely outstanding job wonderful job preaching service after service the word of the Lord and just what we needed in the right moment and there's a lot of preparation that's being made in the spirit and the the word was clear and the worship was outstanding and the atmosphere that you created was commendable and and uh anyway we're just marching on no no lurches here no no backlashes just pressing right through and believing that God is going to meet with us next weekend there are quite a few people who are traveling to be with us here Saturday night and and Sunday and uh we're going to be arranging a couple of things this week 11 o'clock on Saturday we will have fellowship with some burgers and and some youth activity on the campground for Saturday for some of those who were traveling and fellowship for the rest of us and then that night at six o'clock there will be a service and then Sunday we will we'll just let God do all that he wants to do and when he's finally finished finished we'll have lunch together outside and we'll just make it a fellowship weekend and we'll do that every other weekend or now and it helps those who stream at least some of

little of this it was in my heart as we prepare for the word today I want us to sing there shall be light or there has been light in the evening time when the light began to shine as promised in this evening time when once again the son of man would be revealed all that has happened in our day no matter what the world may say bringing light to truth that once was concealed give me just a little more volume there shall be light in the evening time there shall be light here to lead the bride to that marriage supper in the sky where the bride parade in white sit at a table spread for miles and the Lambs shall wipe the tears from her eyes [Music] now a prophet came in our day because the bride had lost her way in a world so full of darkness and sin but when she heard that eagle cry back to the word defended [Music] eyes all the doctrines of the end but there has been light there has been light in this evening time there has been light here to leave the bride to that marriage supper in the sky where the pride parade in white City spread more miles and the lamb [Music] foreign listen one last time for a prophet came in our day because the bride had lost her way in a world so full of Darkness and sin but here's what we did when she heard God's Eagle cry back to the word leave it behind all the doctrines of men there has been light in the evening time there has been light here to lead the bride Hallelujah to that marriage supper [Music] we'll sit at a table and the lamp shall wipe the tears from her eyes think about this and the lamb shall wipe the tears from her eyes [Music] [Applause] don't we have something to be thankful for let's remain standing I'm going to have to spray you'll just have to forgive me I I've got a a smorgasbord for you this morning but it's not not connected have you ever had a disconnected one well you have if you've ever been to one because you'll get a little Mexican and a little little Seafood maybe if you eat it in a little a little Chinese you know they like to appeal to all audiences well I may not appeal to any but I didn't come this morning to be appealing I came to be accurate and I want you to know we're living in a time right now this is an hour to be living somebody said I wished I wasn't living now I there's no other time that I'd rather be alive in right now right now we're we're we're in the culmination and the consummation of the ages right now that little bride that the prophet talked about is emerging really emerging she's been building all these years but she's beginning to come out from behind the hiding post she's about to begin to to expose who she is Mrs Jesus Christ NADA NADA it certainly won't be a a worldwide Revival that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a third seal Revival the kind brother Branham talked about the bride has never had this kind of Revival he describes it to us in many places he said missing limbs would be restored oh man you're not going to get quiet already are you he also said there will be ananiasis and sapphiras laying around and a few of them he said it so how do we know you say well I thought all that had already come and gone no we hadn't seen those ananiasis since the fire is like we haven't seen the missing limbs restored like like has been promised for this great last manifestation of of the bridegroom in the bride but there are many things that are converging in this hour that help us to know the hour we're living in so I wanted to to continue from where I was uh when I was with you a few weeks or two Sundays ago and came home for the weekend and I will get to that if time will permit that's still my desire but I I want to share a few things with you that I think will be a blessing to you but it's going to be a little a little discombobulated in the sense that we're going to see a little clip of a video and then we're going to hear a little clip of an audio and then I'm are you okay with that these are the things that I would have been sharing to you over the last last five and a half weeks had I been here maybe on Tuesday nights and so I've got to get some of it in today because we're going into Passover time and I want to do a little bit of teaching for those of you who are not really familiar with why it is such an important event it's not important in in in historical context only it's important because our lamb because our Passover Lamb has come and he fulfilled that Feast to the letter dying at the very hour that the priest would have been killing the Lambs in Jerusalem and our Lord died at the very hour just a few miles from where the priests were killing the Lambs for the Passover sacrifice and their G and you know brother Branham describes it so beautifully he he talks about how that veil was rent from top to bottom and the Earth shook as the scripture declare and it was midnight in the middle of the day and he talks about all those things uh the veil being opened up and then he says one of the saddest things that kind of reminds me of the theme of the song that they were singing this morning he said and then the priest the religious men of the day took out needle and thread and began to mend the veil again and once again in our day we have seen that happen are you okay with that we have seen God come and unveil himself in his word and we have seen religious men around this message take out needle and thread and start sewing up the veil again to make sure that the people stand on the outside in some kind of reverence when the invitation was never to stand on the outside the invitation was always to come on the inside oh let us therefore now come boldly before the throne of grace so this is going to be a little odd so let me read a verse I didn't even and yeah David David Senna Texas said people don't relate I guess today to to Smorgasbord like they would a charcuterie board so I'm going to bring you this morning a charcuterie board and I don't know why but when I said that I thought of Emily brother just made me think of your sister uh when I thought of charcuterie because she likes all all things pretty and laid out and she's quite a foodie and uh so it made me think of her when that when I read that um I didn't even have these verses for you all up there and uh so someone is asking did you mean every other weekend or every other month I meant every other month every other month we have our fellowship meetings Okay so that is taken care of I want you to turn to two verses of scripture First Genesis chapter one you all don't have it but you can pull it Genesis chapter 1 uh beginning in verse 14. through verse 19. and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years so let's let's rehearse that just a moment let them be for number one for signs see not only to give light but but their next most important responsibility is for signs and then for seasons and then for days and years so that we might be able to divide time it's very important to have these lights the sun and the moon the stars the planets the galaxies because they help us to discern the dividing of time now we have to have the Holy Ghost to be able to discern the dividing of spiritual seasons and the interpretation of spiritual signs it requires the Holy Ghost but the sun and the moon and the stars and the planets are given to help us to divide time all right the next verse and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was Soul so actually to give light was mentioned after the spiritual aspect of being a sign and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good and as you said Tove in Hebrew it was Tov and the evening and the morning were the fourth day just bow your head a moment father I am calling on you now uh feeling just a little bit nervous only because I I like to be able to to follow a little bit of a flow and yet I know that some of the things we're going to talk about in the beginning will be a little disjointed but I ask that you would come Lord and honor your your word today you you have laid on my heart to sort of set us a spiritual scene for where we are moving and I'm going to need your help to do it so we pray that no Spirit would be able to pull our attention away or distract us from what you might want to say to us today we pray that no physical infirmity in my body or in the bodies of the people would would prevent them from being able to focus and hear what you would say and we pray for the opening up of our human spirit so that you might be able to speak directly to who we are and we rebuke the Devourer in the name of Jesus we take authority over him and we declare that he has no legal rights he has no legal rights not in this house and not in our lives and we give you the glory and the honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen God bless you and God bless all of you precious folks who are sending messages from all over the world that you are watching and thank you for every one of you who have welcomed me back and I know that you've been blessed during this time and uh I don't want to begin to name the the Nations here but they are many God is good let me give you one more verse and this is in the New Testament and this is in the Book of Luke also you don't have it there chapter 21 and verse 25. and and I'm reading this because I want to just call your attention to to the planetary parade that has been happening this week um it is an alignment of planets and there are various thoughts and and disagreeing concepts of interpretations um there are those who study science who tell us that it has no significant impact on the earth at all well brother Branham tells us differently he tells us that it marks something spiritually when these planets come together as they I I didn't even know about this until the other night uh we were eating it seems to me like we were having dinner and we were close enough to the sunset that we went out yes we walked across the street I was trying to think of where we were we walked across the street toward the beach access and we looked toward the sunset and just as the sun was going down I saw the Moon the Crescent of the moon was above the sun in alignment with the sun and I was able to make out four planets and it wasn't yet dark the sun just just going down by the Horizon and I said you know this is this is significant this is a significant thing to be able to see four so you a lot of you know that I uh when I'm sitting out here at volleyball with the kids I often take out my my sky watch app and show the kids a point that you can point it in any direction at any Star it'll tell you what the star is if it's a light and you don't know what to light you you point it it'll tell you if it's a planet so I was able to identify and I wasn't getting Mercury but I was getting all the other planets and I learned that it had not it was not quite time yet that was early in the week it wasn't quite time for you to be able to get all five but tomorrow uh night is the peak and so if you were to be able to be somewhere around sunset tomorrow evening and it was clear you would be able to see the moon and and five stars brother Branham calls that five the number of grace we'll play that for you in a moment in almost perfect alignment and they are within 50 degrees of sky space of one another which is an interesting thing because sometimes the planets will pass close to one another but it's very rare for them to be within 50 degrees of sky space so that you could measure out the sky like if you took a protractor and laid it on the horizon you're able within 50 degrees to make out all five planets and the moon uh in in I believe it was June of 2022 these five planets showed up but they were in a far more a broad amount of uh sky space or or uh degrees of space and so I'll give you some statistics in just a moment these things happen all the time and I rarely mention them I get emails from people I get I get videos from people I get people talking about these things every time there is an eclipse every time there is any kind of alignment it's not uncommon that there would be two or three planets aligned at any time uh but I I just unless I feel it unless unless something in my spirit just kind of grinds I don't even mention it to you and you don't mention it to me and unless you're the one one of the ones who have sent me something because if it's not significant for us we just let it pass but when I saw that that evening and I don't remember exactly what evening it was I could look and see something in my spirit spoke and said this is marking something this time well that really got me to start thinking and praying a little bit and as I went to bed that night I prayed Lord if there's something that you want to to do if you're calling my attention to something I'm going to need some help because this is not my area of expertise and so the next morning I woke up and the brother Ron in the Philippines had posted an article that he had found about the five uh of planets coming together in alignment I thanked him for posting and I and I acknowledge to him that with a naked eye that's another thing that makes this small amount this small degree of of of area in space 50 degrees it's another thing that makes it so amazing is that you're able to identify those five planets with the naked eye you don't have to have telescope or any kind of of something that would give you a greater ability to view and I thanked him for posting and I told him I was able to view four of the planets that night with naked eye not even expecting to be able to do that and over the course of the next few days the Lord began to kind of churn in me something and uh I'll just share it with you without interpretation I'll let you begin to ponder on it in your heart and see if it's something that we should even be noticing but for me I I am to notice it because he said to me in my spirit I'm marking something this time something in the spirit is being marked during the alignment of these five planets and I'll show you something in a moment that might might give you a reason to believe that Luke chapter 21 are you still awake and verse 25 Luke 21 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory I don't I don't know if you realize or not but but a a great fulfillment of this verse has already happened the son of man has already made himself known in a cloud with power and great Authority but there's going to yet be a physical fulfillment of this verse of scripture what I love about prophetic verse is that that it comes in phases of of fulfillment when I look at the seals we just celebrated the 60th anniversary of the preaching of the seals one of the things I love about the seals is is how they come around it wasn't just once and for all but brother Branham said these writers continue to ride and as they continue to ride we can recognize through the years that these Spirits begin to rise ebb and fall and things happen and shift geopolitically in the Earth because of what's going on and the truth we would have never known had it not been opened up for us under those seals are you following that it's a blessing to know that it just didn't ride and fall off the edge of the Earth but that spirit continues to ride and so we still see the effects of of all of those Horsemen we still are seeing the effects of them even in the hour that we're living in right now just like we see the the evils and the weaknesses of the church ages all culminated into laodicea everything that was wrong about all the other Church ages is still wrong with the church it just culminated in laodicea but remember what the Lord said he said in the same manner that all of the evils of every age gather together in the last Church age so did the overcoming portion Hallelujah Church age we can still take some of that in this hour it's just building and building and building and building until it came to the anointing of the flying eagle and the Flying Eagle he gets high enough up there that he gets to look down and see it all and whether you realize it or not the bride has been anointed not just the prophet the bride has been Anointed with that flying eagle anointing and we can get up above our circumstances sometime in the spirit and see what we need to see how many of you believe the higher you get the more the more different things look things begin to look different when you get up to Heaven's Vantage Point amen this is not a time for sleeping [Music] I hope you get to take you a big Sunday afternoon nap if you're so so inclined but you're not going to use my time for that use your time okay let's go on and finish this verse and they shall see the son of man coming in cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth and I now are we there are we yet to a place where we should be able to lift up our heads because our Redemption draweth not I'm asking you a question we certainly are the key is keeping your head lifted up you're not to walk around with the Fallen countenance you're not to walk around like some bunch of beat up wounded broken sad messed up twisted up I almost said something else I'm glad I caught myself God is good no we're not talking listen the church is in the worst shape she's ever been in you can say Amen but the bride is moving into the best shape of her existence oh Hallelujah she's recognizing who she is she's about decided that she's going to start talking to some of these circumstances she's going to start speaking the word into some of these problems that she's been hiding from in the past amen all right here we go and and when these things begin to come to pass look up lift up your head for your Redemption drawing nigh and he spoke to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth so you see and know of your own cells that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I say unto you this generation the generation that sees the coming to pass of all these things shall not pass away till all be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now what I wanted to bring to your attention is that tomorrow evening March 28 excuse me that would be Tuesday then on the evening of March 28th five planets Jupiter Mercury Venus Uranus and Mars will gather within a small 50 degree Sky sector that's the word I should have been using you you can start your observation soon after Sunset and it and and there's instructions it will tell you how to move up and look up and how many degrees if you've got some way of doing that and I I wanted to know how common this kind of a thing is and there are there are many times that there there will be what they call a mini planetary alignment three planets and sometimes there will be what they call a small planetary alignment four planets but a large planetary alignment is when five or six planets come together at the same time and uh just to give you a little bit of information here only one more time this year will there be such an event and that is on June the 17th a large morning alignment of mercury Uranus Jupiter Neptune and Saturn but it will be within a 95 degree Sky sector where what's happening this week is in a 50 degree meaning they're much closer and easier to observe by the naked eye now watch this the next time that these naked eye planets will come together in an unusual measure they will come together in 2014. in nine degrees of one another how many of you know that's pretty close somebody said well the Rapture will be and we won't have to worry about I'm just telling you what scientists are predicting that in 2040 those five planets will come together so close that it'll be a circle of nine degrees in the sky and about every 100 years six or more planets will line up and appear together within a small area of the sky so it is not as common as you might think for there to be five planets come together as these planets will do this week now one of the times that they came together was in February of 1962. in February the 4th of 1962 these five planets came together and they began to predict everywhere that the world was coming to an end anybody heard that and uh they they were telling it everywhere that that likely on February the 4th of 1962 the world was coming to an end because the planets were going to be so closely aligned almost as never before how many of you'd like to hear what brother Branham said about that can we play that clip of February the 4th 1962 brother Branham is in Jeffersonville he is preaching the communion message there and there are three paragraphs we also have it on the screen we also I gave those quotes also and they they probably pulled it in so if you'll take just a moment to see if you see those they had today's date on them and then we could see them as we hear them because I don't know how clear the audio is and that's paragraph 74 and 75 and I also gave you 76 in printed form I think it's interesting how brother Branham took this he he he he was stirred and I hope you can hear it in his voice [Music] you remember the claim it was three stars hanging to the orbit when Jesus five and five is great the number of great three is the number perfect five is the number of Grace and so forth it was another Warfare was over yet she was about it 'll be his grace amen so I think I made in the eve of it now if a man yes If any man is thirsty let him come to Christ he quenches The Thirst he is he is the satisfier of all our thirst and hunger would you permit me this could I play that again let's look at it again I I feel like I'm boring somebody why are you all laughing in the sound booth in English this time she don't know her password to her Facebook and you all were playing that on Facebook I learned you something brother Brandon's voice is everywhere praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God I don't know why I feel it you see in this paragraph here brother man said in the early part of the first part of the month beginning on the second or the fifth or somewhere along this month he he doesn't even seem to realize that on the very day he's speaking is the day that it culminated you see now like what was happening all week you you could have seen it all week if you'd been in the right place they're saying that that that on the 28th it will be the culmination brother banham is not even realizing that he is speaking on the very day that all these planets made their combination and would have been easier to view by the naked eye he just remembers that it's it's about now now is about the time God doesn't make mistakes to me it's just another little sign there all right and it was Indian astronomers around this month the Indian astronomers predict the world to go to pieces the World's Gonna cost yeah one of these days holding over here remember the stars came into when Jesus Jesus died and five is great and so forth [Music] Warfare was over here she was guilty Hallelujah God said so it may mean something I predict that there will be a change I don't know why it'll be happy we're on the Earth If any man is thirsty let him come to Christ he quenches The Thirst he is the satisfier of all our thirst and hunger I want you to notice that this is February of 1962 before the year is over before the year of 62 is over brother Branham is at sunset and a few months after that March of the next year the seals are preached remember that the the Angels Came months before the seals were preached so the visitation of the Angels took place within just a few months after brother random talking about the alignment of these planets and what did that visitation do and the Revelation that followed it opened up the word it became an entirely new book to a prophet and it became a new book to a people can anybody say Amen so how many of you would say that something spiritual came out of that a moment of those planets coming into alignment like that five together brother man said I wouldn't make fun of that he's pretty emphatic wasn't he I wouldn't make fun of that he said I don't think you ought to do that and then he said I I predict that this has a spiritual application I believe that it is the coming in of the issue of God that the great Revelations of the word will be open during this time how many of you believe that a few months later that is indeed exactly what God did now why are you bringing that out because I all I know is that there is yet something that has to open up from all that Revelation that God has given us we're looking to see the manifestation of that bride so in Union with the Messiah that whatever he says she announces that in the earth and the full manifestation of the sons of God becomes a reality how many of you believe that's when cancer leaves the bride body you mean you really believe there's going to be a people walking around yes I do for a quick short work I believe there's going to be a bride here on the earth fully manifesting the character and the nature and the authority of Jesus Christ I believe it's going to push the schisms and the isms in the other direction I believe it's going to silence many of the religious scoffers I believe it's going to be a revelation and an application and a and a fulfillment and a demonstration of the power and authority of the spoken word did you know brother Branham said in that day that bride will have thus saith the Lord or she will hold her peace does that sound like a broken down uh a wounded sick sickness torn weary bride dragging to church every Sunday can hardly get one foot in front of another or does that sound like a people who will come forth with deliverance and victory with the high praises of God in their mouth we're not celebrating our wounds we're not celebrating our weaknesses we're celebrating our God because he's the one that's given us the victory by the revealing of his word so much to thank him for we can say like no other people have been able to say we can look right at the Devil and say you have no legal rights yeah you're a squatter you have no legal rights I have repented and the grace of God is what's bringing me the help I need because my obedience can't always be there how many of you know when my obedience doesn't measure up his grace always extends Beyond that's no excuse not to live a Sanctified life help me preach a little that's no excuse not to live a life above sin the weslians were called to that if the last Church age was called To Live above sin surely the bride of Christ is called to live above sin as well if you believe that say Amen so just a few months later after those five planets were aligned the way they they were in a very in a very small uh Specter of sector of space then this great visitation took place you know there's this whole thing brother green used to talk about because there were these cosmonauts who were who were in a in a Space Capsule and they were flying over the Arizona desert and and they had they were they were Communists and they were atheists and they had this experience where they looked out the window and they saw these angels and and they said we we we don't know what it was but we know what we saw and we want to tell the world about it and brother green he believed that he had a revelation I I'm not making a Doctrine on any of this but he believed he had a doctrine that what they saw were those seven angels he believed that those Seven Angels were still somewhere in the atmosphere and that God let those atheists communists look out the window and see them and have to say there is something bigger than than science there is something bigger than communism in government there is something bigger than being an atheist or an agnostic and uh he believed that somehow God had allowed those angels that's why brother Brandon was not Disturbed when there was a a little I mean brother green was not Disturbed when there was a little conflict of dates you know about the cloud and whether Brother band was actually out there that day and was he citing the gun and was he in Texas or was he there and is that the cloud and all the all the controversy and brother green said I never got caught up in any of that because he said I I one time brother Brandon was talking about it and he said it could have been a day before it could have been a day or two after and he said I just always took it that way and he said in fact I I believe those angels somehow are still somewhere over that part of the earth somewhere out there in the heavenlies he said I believe there's something to it he said you don't ever know maybe one of these days we might be down there and look up in the sky and see them there now somebody said that's just too much for me to believe well I know but we serve a supernatural God we are called to be a supernatural people we're living in a supernatural hour 60 years 60 years the truth of the seals has been preached week after week in churches all across the world the truth of the Seven Seals is greatly established and yet we've got some things that brother Branham said about that seventh seal that we have not yet fully come to understand the bride has to she's got to get it it's not going to be from a preacher somewhere it's got to come from the word it's got to come from the message it's got to come from what he's already said you believe that don't you we're not looking for a new message we're not looking for a new messenger but we are looking for more understanding of what we've already heard and if you're not you're dead you're not only stagnant you're dead if you're not asking God quite regularly in your life give me more Revelation give me more understanding of the word now I can't tell you the the steps I made asking God up and down that beach Lord I want more understanding I want more revelation of your word and I want you to give me an understanding heart got to have it I realize I can't go forward in this hour without more Revelation and understanding of what your word is to be accomplishing in your people in this hour I want to discover what God's word is supposed to be producing in us and I want to yield myself to it I want to yield myself to it so that my opinion no longer matters so that my mind and my will and my emotion is surrendered to the perfect leadership of the Holy Spirit how many of you want his perfect leadership in your life some can't live today in the in the day in the now excuse me because they're living in the past they can't believe that God continues to update himself come on you see they refuse to acknowledge some of the things that brother Branham says concerning that seventh seal he said I did not understand it I could not make it out it went by me in an unknown tongue I'm just telling you what he said for all these years they've said say what he said say what he said say what he said I'm telling you what he said could it be could it be that there's enough hunger in the bride could it be that that if there's enough hunger in The Bride for such a time as this that God will come to US 60 years later and give us understanding of what we have already heard so that we cannot just understand it but manifest it I I I have to believe I have to believe I have to believe the voice that said I'm marking something this time 60 years and and then to show you the prophetic hour that we're living in let me show you this video from CBN this is Josh Alano yosway sent this to me but uh I'd already read the article but I hadn't seen the video I tried to get away from this but I did a Tuesday night not too many months ago about the red heifers remember you would you like to have an update on the red heifers watch this and I know this man this is Christmas undisclosed location in Israel plans include moving them sometime soon to a visitor's center in Silo where the Tabernacle of the Lord once stood for nearly 400 years the Book of Numbers explains that ashes of the red heifer are used to purify priests for their service in the temple now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded saying speak to the children of Israel that they bring you a red heifer without blemish in which there is no defect and on which a yoke has never come you shall give it to Eliezer the priest that he may Take It Outside the camp and it shall be slaughtered before him it's awful shall be burned for the water of purification it is for purifying from sin these red heifers are now between one and a half to two years old to replicate the ceremony mentioned in the Bible they need to be at least three years old and within their time span they cannot have a blemish or anything that would disqualify them for the ceremony even one white or black hair according to those working on the project the ceremony of the red heiferate needs to be performed on the Mount of Olives and in a place that would have looked directly into where the temple stood the land I'm standing on bought 12 years ago fits both of those standards it's had to be exactly at the front of place that the priest that made this ceremony can see the holy of the Holy Place Rabbi Yitzhak Mamo owns the land here on the Mount of Olives and we hope that in a year and a half from today we can make here in this area the ceremony of the red heifer that actually will be the first step to the temple Mamo says the ceremony needs priests who have not been defiled by touching anything down said the temple Institute actually had nine pure priests they didn't born in hospital okay they born at home because they are placed so anyway they don't go to any cemetery and the parents keep them in a situation that they will not get to any cemetery and not going to other any problematic place and up here and they are waiting so we have the priest we have the red effort we have the land and we have everything ready we just need to wait another one and a half year so we believe that it's very likely that the ceremony would happen somewhere in the area of Passover 2024 out to possibility of Xavier 2024 somewhere in that timeline the cows would be old enough and it would be the proper timeline for that ceremony Byron Stinson of Bernay Israel helped find the red heifers in the U.S he says these would be the first in two thousand years and that the process toward a third Jewish temple began when the Jewish people started their return to the promised land from the four corners of the world culminating with Israel becoming a nation and then in 1948 and one day they were reborn as a nation and nobody said that could happen and then you could move forward and Israel continues to be this strong nation and all of these prophecies start fulfilling there's so many now have been fulfill it's just incredible the evidence of what God is doing with Jerusalem as the center of that and the temple is the center of Jerusalem and so how can it happen and how will it happen I don't think anyone really knows for sure Stinson believes the temple is meant to be a house of prayer for all nations you know in the Bible it says when Solomon built the first temple he said this is a house of worship for all nations that's what the temple is and I think a lot of people think it's just the Jewish temple but that's not true is for all the nations of the earth since and says they plan to invite everyone to the red heifer ceremony that may take place in Passover 2024. everything is in place now that the red heifers as long as they stay pure of one of them stays pure then we have everything in place including the priests mama says according to the Jewish age maimonides there were nine red heifers from Moses to the second temple it's not his way to write but suddenly he said the tent will made the Messiah we know that the Messiah will make the tent maybe we have the through Village to be one of these people that helps the Messiah to do it so we're waiting so Chris Mitchell CBN News the Mount of Olives Jerusalem yeah go ahead [Applause] somebody said I don't understand why that has anything to do with us brother Branham explained that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and what house will you build me and so this certainly couldn't apply to the bride don't forget folks brother Branham tells us the temp the Jews will rebuild the Temple tells us they will so it's going to be how many of you believe that let me ask you does anybody believe Los Angeles is going to the bottom of the ocean why why do you believe that because the Vindicated prophet of God Said So It lines up with the word it's been confirmed for many many years hasn't yet come to pass so it has to come to pass that same Prophet said the Jews will rebuild the Temple on the Temple mount how many of you believe that he that's exactly what the scripture tells us because remember Ezekiel prophesies about a temple that's larger than the Temple Mount that's the millennial Temple and then John talks about measuring the temple that he saw in the spirit and how that is transposed over the Earth so we've got the scripture we've got the prophets who have prophesied we've got that little unction in our heart we hear brother Brandon crying out watch Jerusalem watch Israel watch the Jews see what they're doing you've got that witness and anybody who has ever stood on that Temple mount it was my privilege to show brother green who had spent his whole life studying Israel and did not know that the foundation stone of the Ark of the Covenant was sitting on top of the Temple Mount and it was my honor to show him in the last years of his life and to stand with him there and show him the stone that was used in the in the in the temple and probably was there the day the the the veil was rent in Twain and he cried like a little bitty baby and he said I've known all my life that this was going to be and that God was going to let these Jews rebuild this temple one of these days he will not see it with his natural eye he has gone to to live in another place but you and I may actually be able to we may actually see it coming to pass physically and and and so a non-priest let's go over this nine priests studying at the temple Institute where brother Greely and I have been we've met the directors of the of the Institute my father-in-law was with me we have talked with them we've discussed all of the Holy ephods all of the instruments and implements are ready all everything that needs to happen is in place now we know there are non-priest born at home not in a hospital never been around the Dead and now there are heifers within a year and a half of being ready so that makes this a very exciting time prophetically because there are some things that have to take place before the mercies of God return to the Jews the Gentile numbers are finished something's got to bring the rest of the remnant Gentiles in what about a Revival in the bride what about a move in the bride of Christ what about dismantling the accuser putting his accusations down getting them under the blood repenting cleaning up our lives getting filled with the Holy Ghost getting ready to go home and then there's one more that was two of the three the Third then I'll preach for two hours I'm nearly done not preaching we're at Passover time and we don't celebrate Passover in the sense of keeping Passover it's it's near near to Impossible it's nigh to impossible to do it and totally unnecessary to do it in the way that the Jews are doing it just to be completely honest with you Jesus has fulfilled for us the Passover but it is such a beautiful picture of God's meticulous nature and how he is determined to fulfill everything that he has spoken and so when we spend a little time next weekend in one of the services spending a little time on on what Passover really means and how Jesus fulfilled Passover and what brother Branham had to say about Passover and he had a whole lot more to say about Passover and about the sacrificial lamb and about the resurrection of the Lamb than he ever did about something they like to call Easter all right you know what I mean eggs and bunnies and new frogs and new Bonnets and all the things that brother Branham said that people get caught up in that have nothing to do with the scripture help me a little bit even naming it you know even even the King James translators of the Bible choosing the name of a pagan goddess instead of the of the word that was actually in the original was pesach which is Passover and the and the King James translators under the great influence of the Roman Catholic system we now know they decided to to rename it because they didn't want the New Testament to sound too Jewish interesting isn't it so I try not to even use that word but not because I I think it's wrong to celebrate the resurrection but the resurrection is not a day it's not one Sunday out of 52 what is the resurrection the resurrection is him the resurrection is a person Jesus said I am the resurrection and the lie and we don't celebrate Jesus with an Easter egg or with an Easter Bunny or with an Easter basket or with a New Dress everyone trying to outdo one another on that's not what we're doing we're celebrating the resurrection of Christ every day but keeping that in mind there's something very interesting about this Passover I think the Lord drew me to it did you all know that brother Branham was born during Passover he was not only born which we've mentioned many times through the years he was not only born during Passover but he was born on the first full day of Passover now anybody who knows anything about the Jewish Day knows that it doesn't begin at six a.m in the morning does it it begins when Sunset the day before and so Passover in the year of uh that brother Brandon was born 1909 it began in the evening on April the 5th and brother Brandon was born the next day on April the 6th the first full day of Passover Passover in 1909 went from April the 5th to April the 13th on the Gregorian calendar it's always from Nissan 15 to Nissan 22 on the Hebrew calendar but it's never the same rarely the same on the Gregorian calendar because the Hebrew calendar is a lunar moon calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar that operates on the Sun how many of you understand that but this year this year just a few days after our meetings Passover will begin in 2023 and it will be exactly the days that Passover was the Year brother Branham was born 1909. it will begin on Monday evening the first full day will be Tuesday and it will go exactly from April the 5th to April the 13th it did it in 1909 and it's doing it again in 2023 and the Lord spoke to my heart he said I want you to mark that now why he didn't say so that's what I'm doing this morning I'm marking it I'm marking it I'm marking that five planets are aligning in a 50 degree sector of the sky and that this Tuesday is the culmination of that I want to mark that I'm marking the fact that we are perhaps two years away from the first red heifer ceremony in 2000 years and I am marking the fact that we are about to enter a week of Passover celebrating Jesus his broken body you know a lot of people in the church fail to understand that we would have no communion if it weren't for Passover it was Passover that he was talking about when he was meeting with his disciples what the church likes to call Palm Sunday there would have been no Palm Sunday had there not been a need to get to Jerusalem so that he could celebrate the Passover with his disciples and he's actually going through the Seder of the Passover when he says to them this cup this cup of redemption not the first cup the cup of redemption this is my blood shed for you he was literally taking what we call matzah which was unleavened bread like we use in communion he was literally breaking in the Seder in the Passover he's breaking this unleavened bread and he's giving it to them take eat this is my body which is broken for you take drink this cup this is my blood this is the Covenant in the New Testament this is the updating not the replacing of an old Covenant but the updating of an old Covenant and then he said this do you foreign if we were to get technical and I'm closing there is no scripture that tells us to celebrate his birth there is no scripture that tells us to celebrate his resurrection we do it and we should and we should remember that he was born because if he hadn't been born he couldn't die we do it practically but he did tell us the scripture does tell us to remember his death this do ye in remembrance of me as oft as she eat it you eat it in remembrance of me and this you do until I come because one of these days I'm going to sit down with you in the New Kingdom come on brother man I'm talking about in this quote The Nearness of the kingdom of God I'm going to sit down with you in the New Kingdom and I'm going to drink this cup I'm not going to drink it again until I drink it with you in the New Kingdom he's prophesying of the marriage supper of the Lamb so I I just you know I I thought I would take a few minutes and and then preach but I'm doing I'm really done for today I don't think this is going to hurt any of us I would very much like for us to consider the season that we're living in what if we are approaching a time that God is going to answer prayer this little bride is cried out we want to Manifest this word we want to live a life that that is more in alignment with the truth that has changed us we want the flesh battle to come to an end we want all jealousies to be gone and resentments to be gone and during this season of Passover is when we search our lives for living if there's any Prejudice in me show me Lord if there's racism in me show me Lord if I'm carrying something against somebody show me Lord you see the more we search the more we dig the more we prepare ourselves before him the closer he draws us it's not our obedience that gets the job done it's his grace that's the balance but it behooves us it calls us to want to be closer to him that's one of the things that makes the the Fulfillment of the Feast of east of Bibles so beautiful it's because God gives us another way of connecting to him it's not a bunny it was a lamb when we begin to study these things 30 30 years ago when we begin to teach the church 30 years ago the details of how Christ fulfilled the Passover there was never another communion service after that that I didn't I didn't remember I didn't feel more connected to communion than I had ever felt before because God used the Fulfillment of the biblical Feast to give me another way of connecting to him and understanding the language that he was speaking you see this seder of the second temple period this particular meal that had been celebrated in every Jewish Home for a number of years by the time Jesus was born it had a particular order and it was set and there's not to be a lot of additional uh paraphrasing and interpretation and Jesus just like he did that day in the in the in the temple in the in the synagogue of Nazareth he gets up and reads the scripture and then he said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears so here he is the last passover with his disciples and he begins to to go off script he begins to talk a little differently about the bread this is my body this is my blood and it connects us it connected the disciples to the Passover I promise you that the next Passover was was different than any they had ever celebrated before because they now saw the real meaning of what they had done mindlessly the Jews have mindlessly repeated these these things over and over again without understanding but you and I have been given an understanding that the lamb has come he has fulfilled every without blemish without spot you heard them talking about the examination of these red heifers if if in the next year and a half to two years one black hair appears one white hair appears that and they can't pluck it you say I would just be easy to pluck that one hair out they can't do that they're Bound by their own law and code if one little hair goes awry then that particular animal is no longer worthy for the red heifer sacrifice or offering red heifer offering and so it reminds us in this season as we're searching Our Own Heart Lord if if there be any wicked way in me if there's any resentment in me if there's any jealousy in me if there's anything in me that's not lining up with your word it seems like this is a prophetic season planets are lining up red heifers have been discovered again we're closer than we've been in 2000 years to seeing that become a reality and here we are at a Passover season that runs exactly consecutively with the one that brother Branham was born under and it causes us to just perhaps have this longing in our heart to understand everything that you have for us to understand Lord we're we're just just common men and women we can't get it all figured out but we come to you and we surrender our hearts we surrender Our Lives Before You Why Don't We Stand Together why don't we have the musicians to come and I I won't make any apologies for for this even though it's quite odd it's just what we need maybe I'm going to trust that and hope that that I didn't miss him oh that's nice sister Joyce you just said 30 I know she didn't do it for me to read it she didn't see it later but 30 years ago on their anniversary is when they visited here was that like the first time you were here 30 years ago for Passover they came 30 years ago for Passover meetings with us and it was on their wedding anniversary which which I was supposed to mention sister Doris's birthdays today would you all say happy birthday to Sister Doris Carter's birthdays today would you all say happy birthday to Carter [Applause] Tuesday brother and sister Greely will celebrate how many years of wedded bliss 32 years of marriage outstanding and on the same day our sister Greta Christensen in Norway has a birthday so we send her our love from Alabama we remember them and loved them fondly God bless you why don't we just talk to the Lord for just a moment it's the the musicians are getting a song and Benjamin's getting ready to lead us in worship all I all I want us to do is to make sure that the enemy has nothing that he can hold over our lives why don't I give you just why don't I give you just one little quote here Hallelujah I'm not always this scattered sometimes I'm worse thank you Jesus in the message expectation you should find that Austin may take you a minute it's in my notes paragraph 32 brother Branham said I I said well that's up to them I don't know but I I said you never know no matter how much you scream how loud you scream how much you pray that Devil's got a legal right to stay right there and he will stay there too that's right he's got a right to stay there not only that but if you supposed to have done something and didn't do it he has a legal right of Disobedience so don't tell me because of the other quote your obedience doesn't matter it matters wouldn't it be wonderful if we could keep all the scriptures in Balance wouldn't it be wonderful we could keep all the quotes in balance not go too far off on anything but just walk right in the middle of the word it would be beautiful he said so that's what it is calming that person you find out just where the cause is then you know where to start for the Cure see it's unconfessed sin many times so you watch what you say stopping this one out and stomping that one out see that's right faith will move but not when he's got a legal right Satan knows what his rights is what he hasn't got a right to that's right clean yourself up before God and come before him how pure and holy ask then see and now search your life out he swore by himself the next one now by faith my brethren and my mother right move right into this blood cell with the Lord Jesus Now by faith my brethren and my mother move right into this blood cell with the Lord Jesus where all those Redemptive blessings are yours you're everyone Christians I presume and then if you are Christians you have a right a legal right for everything that Christ died for it's your possession you own it it's yours now the only thing that you can do is like Abraham after he had endured a fight he obtained the promise Satan just don't don't just let you take it easy you've got to have faith you've got to believe it somebody read the last one then one of my favorites gifts 1956. paragraph 83 will you believe all over the building at this time is that the things he did when he was here on Earth then his healing never changes it's him do you believe now then then believe let us pray our heavenly father may all superstitions leave the people that devil tries to keep them in darkness and truly they're designed to be the Seed of Abraham and I ask that you go and send away this evil or give me the spirit of power Satan I wish to speak to you hey you see you're exposed your time is nearly over and all your condemnation at that day I stand here as God's servant you're not afraid of me but you are of him but I represent in him in his death burial and Resurrection these people represent him you believe that and you got your demons all bound into these people and you think you can hold them but you're just a bluff you're stripped of every privilege you have you have no legal right Jesus stripped you of every Power you had at Calvary you're nothing but a bluff and you ain't bluffing us no longer Jesus is here and you're you are rebuked thou Spirit of Doubt come out of this people in the name of Jesus Christ leave this people and go out of this building and may every one of them be healed in Jesus Christ's name if you're ever going to believe you'll believe right now rise and be healed give God praise and glory and be healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how many of you can receive that right now lift up your hands to the Lord and receive what he has for you receive him right now we receive healing if healing is what you need if you need to be delivered from oppression receive that right now if you're overly nervous or anxious battling depression in your mind the spirit of God wants to come and make himself the same yesterday and today and forever the best thing for you and I to do now in the time remaining is to

let me just say this to you when you're when you're standing up here don't use your time to say let brother Shelley speak to me or let brother Greeley speak to me or let some let them come and pray for me don't use your time that way okay God will hear you sometimes he'll honor you if that's your request but don't use your time for that you you don't need a word you just need to give it to him and sometimes there's so many doing that at one time there'd be no way to do it you don't need us for that you need us for other things but when you get in God's presence he's the one one of the sermons I preached that got me put out of the message was Two's Company Three's a Crowd and I preached 25 30 years ago and that's when they'd give me the boot that you can't go in that place of intimacy with you and brother Branham and Jesus you can't go in that Oneness with you and your pastor in Jesus Scott or your Apostle or whatever they have today are your five full prophet in Jesus or your evangelist indeed it's you and him and to be honest with you there's something in our nature sometime that we would rather have three than to face him than it just to be us have you ever had to go somewhere you want to take somebody with you to make it less awkward so sometimes people will cling to brother Branham because they don't really want to face Jesus on their own or they'll cling to their Pastor because they don't really want to have to have Jesus speak directly to them but let me tell you something the whole purpose of of God revealing himself through this message was so that you could have Oneness with Jesus Christ Oneness with him Union with him this invisible Union uh is invisible in bond but it's going to be visible in manifestation it's going to manifest itself in a visible way it's going to demonstrate itself in a visible way the sick are going to be healed the the oppressed are going to be set free the bride is going to appreciate the authority that God has given brother random said you may not have the power but you have the authority and the reason why you don't have both is because Jesus has the power and you've got to have him you've got a fellowship with him in that power you've got to be one with him in that power you can't leave him out of the equation it's not you and your Authority it's you and Jesus how many of you know that you've got to fall in love with him it's wonderful when you respect your pastors your leaders or those spiritual men that God has sent to help you it's right it's right to do it it's right to honor them it's right to appreciate them respects is a very important part of of the truth that God's delivered to us in this day brother bran I'm preaching often on showing respects but don't you get to a place where you are more connected to your leader Earthly than to Jesus Christ when you come up here you come up here knowing that he's going to meet you here and he's going to help you I'd like to hear the church
